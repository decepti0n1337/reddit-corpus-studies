I wish they scaled based on the location you used to launch them.

---
---
Did they say anything about updates for the series x version?
---
Sup Ram. You finished with the run yet?
---
Fingers crossed for the Anti Material Rifle/Service Rifle/Assault Carbine/Watts 1000/2000 Laser weapons/Desert Eagle/P90/FAL/Trail Carbine/.357 Revolver and Reinforced Combat Armor MK1/2 for Fractured Steel!
---

---
I honestly did NOT expect Steel Dawn to arrive so quickly - i was honestly under the impression it wouldn't be implemented until early October, this is a huge surprise.
---
I'm going to assume Patch 22 will be implemented on: September 15th/22nd since both are on a Tuesday.
---
Man I'm glad Bethesda is ramping up, this is really good news. However I'm not naive to the fact some of those features will likely be delayed for a week (Like the Windego event for example) truth is I'm ok with that. At least they're being transparent/keeping us in the know.
---
Can't wait!
---
Well if i didn't have that i'd be long gone! lol ...
---
Yea same here. The settlers at Foundation already reference that they came from there to settle in Appalachia. It‚Äôs possible they could make an expedition quest there
---
Don't worry, they will.

Instigating 3 star power fist.
---
I finished it legitimately like 2 weeks ago what's the issue with it
---
Armor always supersedes clothing in NW so you can easily see that a) you *HAVE* armor b) what kind of armor you have and d) that the armor has broken (if you last long enough to actually break armor)
---
Maybe power armor displays further out? Possibly putting something out down the road, when it should have been a release item. That's just sad.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, bought the game a short while after it released and have finished all of the main content, most of the side missions, and have gotten everything I‚Äôve wanted for my character/camp. Grinding daily challenges and leveling up a battle pass is *not* fallout. Ive had the game deleted for about 2 months now, but all of this sounds so promising that I‚Äôd love to hop in and play it all. The question is if any of this will become true. They‚Äôre way too good at making things sound nice, but when it releases (if it ever does) is a broken mess that‚Äôs just barely enjoyable even without the bugs
---
After all of these botched updates I can't not be skeptical about anything on this list. If we get even the new brotherhood of steel quests this YEAR I'll consider it a win. Everything else is pretty much just a lie so that players won't quit the game.
---
Again, I'll be the first person to congratulate Bethesda if they prove me wrong, but I can't be optimistic and naive anymore.
---
If our cap limit is 30 how were they able to buy 50k worth of your stuff?  Was it the same person?
---
My friend has 3 in her camp. For the rad shower, a lot of water pumps, missel and laser turrents and more. Apperantly one didn‚Äôt power everything she had.
---
 Nothing just making bad jokes, as usual.
---
I feel ya, thanks for staying. Your optimism is definently helpful and needed in this world
---

---
I've seen several people ask about this , but this game barely runs good on current gen. I would rather them leave the graphics alone so the game might actually run at 60 fps on the new consoles.
---
We should be able to make preserved food, but the fridge should also stop food spoilage. There's so much potential for food that gets ignored in 76

Happend to me once! Still dont know to this day if i fucked up or the gameüòÇ im almoast sure i put it in the right place..

Ive got 4 just sitting in my inventory : (

Or they could do what iOS does with test flight and just have bogus entitlements I.e. it‚Äôs funny money so everybody could like buy FO1 or have a gazillion atoms with no bearing on your real accounts. They‚Äôd have to like wipe out the PTS each time though as I‚Äôd imagine people could grow attached or accustomed to it. But at least they could then test these things with way more eyes.
---
We should be able to but I‚Äôve checked time and time again since the patch release and nothing yet.
---
Wow, this has really affected you, hasn't nazi?
---
I guess attacking people for no reason isn't a good idea, now is it cunt?
---
Why do you hate black people so much? Could you at least answer that?
---
I‚Äôm over 3000 hours in, 5 characters. All characters were rifleman for the longest time, as soon as I switched to commando never looked back.
---
My bloodied fixer in stealth does 563 damage per shot without adrenaline. Enough said. And for those people complaining about going through tons of ammo, I call BS. Barely noticed using extra ammo. You only need to shoot something till it‚Äôs dead, and commando has way better damage per second. Simply tap the trigger a few times and almost any enemy goes down.
---
I guess I don't have them but they drop pretty frequently for me so if I get them I'll hit you up.
---
I agree with this, and it's been true of past dev panels as well.  The devs genuinely sound like they hear our concerns and have a number of ideas of their own, good ideas, of what they want to accomplish.
---
But it also feels like something gets in the way.  To speculate *what* requires trying to read between the lines.  I do tend to think that the devs are sometimes at odds with Bethesda itself, who have different (read: greedy) plans for the game, which is one reason why they insist that fans need to make their support and concerns known, almost so they can have the ammo or backing to go back to their superiors and prove why it has to be done, because it's not going to get done otherwise.
---
You should try ark lol

Omg a few more mods for the 50. Cal would be nice too üò≠

Got it, love it,  never take it off, my way of letting peeps know I've been here since .....

No idea on the word but you‚Äôll need to wait a few more days for more letters to be revealed if you eat to launch legitimately.

You‚Äôll use the word as a keyword cypher.

&gt; Bunker sounds kinda contradictory to the point they were making
---
Contrast that with 
---
&gt;Fallout shelter is a door on camp can make instanced camps inside ur camp
---
(whatever kind of grammar that is supposed to be) from above. I haven't watched the stream, so just judging from this abstract I'd figure bunker it is. :-/ On the plus side, instanced underground cell that we could expand in whatever direction with a lot of leeway could allow for awesome builds.
---
Any one character can only hold 30k caps. If you are at 29,999 and someone buys something from your vendor for 500 caps, you only get 1 cap. The rest go into Tod Howard‚Äôs trunk......
---
If you have 5 characters you could technically have 150k caps at your disposal.
---
I tried snapping a photo of one that happened, soon as i got into position it disappeared &gt;:X
---
I was actually thinking the perk load outs was a sooner than later upgrade. My fault for getting that impression, but still disappointing.
---
Bring the mats and I can slap on those excavator calibrated shocks for you. PC: orias
---
That‚Äôs dumb, I wanted to have like 100k caps on me üòÇ
---
It's totally worth twenty bones.
---
Only one vending machine needs to be powered, all it does is add the map marker!
---
Buy bulk from trainyard vendors. It's not like there's anything useful to get with caps anymore anyways. Most day one players have everything they want so caps are basically throw away at this point.
---
progress transfers between the two launchers, yes. but purchased atoms and 1st membership does not. in-game earned atoms and things bought in the atomic shop will stay.
---
Fuck yeah i am. I'm shocked to be quite honest - i didn't think Steel Dawn would've been implemented until October. 
---
Truth is I'm actually fine with Fractured Steel being pushed back until January next year - gives Bethesda more time to test/add more things. 
---
I mean Wastelanders was well worth the wait, right? Here's hoping Fractured Steel comes out on January 5th (A day after my birthday - plus it's on a Tuesday, so it'd be a no brainer)
---
Can't wait to see your box camp
---
Ah, Yes.  The PS port of the game is completely different than the other versions with the 2d sprites and all that
---
All of this sounds great but based on how they‚Äôve implemented new features it could very much be yet another train wreck of bugs. I recommend managing expectations.
---
much appreciatedüòò
---
That wold be sick anything for camps with more technology wold be cool really.
---
Ermehgerd!
---
Sandman first then covert operative. It‚Äôs buggy now so they may have attempted to patch it
---
Yeah the Nuka girl one is so much better!
---
I hope they open vault 51 as well. I haven‚Äôt bothered reading or listening to anything in there because there‚Äôs not enough time :(
---
Reminder: double sided walls exist in the game files, but are yet to be enabled. They've been there for months if not since launch
---
I mean this is by far the tamest ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù game I‚Äôve ever played. There‚Äôs no full loot, raiding or harsh penalty for dying. Junk and a few caps is the worst you can lose. It makes such a negligible difference killing a wanted person or being wanted. There‚Äôs nothing to worry about
---
It sucked. Laggy, confusing, took to long to grind stuff
---
The fuck are you talking about.
---
No. Didn‚Äôt make it into game even though patch notes said it did
---
Do you recall their GT?
---
Posting cause I had to google it as well.

---
Horde mode in there where before the match you can wager scrip / caps / gold and if you lose you gotta pay up
---
True, I thought Steel Dawn would at least be mid October. Also, I didn't know Fractured Steel was moved to January. Whatever, Wastelanders was well worth the wait.
---
Plasma takes too long to get to the target
---
Yeah, I enjoy the game but lately all the limits (caps, scrip, bullion, weight, etc) and bugs are beginning to take a toll. Been slowly weaning off, playing other games.
---
My hope is we see what happened to eso and Fallout Shelter where the game started out fun but slow and then Bethesda finally decided the game was worth investing. 
---
I do need to remind myself that covid has done a lot, while they can work at home it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a comparable work environment, especially with relaying info. Overall, I think this will be a great game. I just hope the devs are allowed to just start working on their schedule rather than management‚Äôs
---
Make the ammo spinner part allow ammo to be deposited like scrip machine and terminal can be for purchases.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be mad at this but it would mess up the ammo trading thing 
---
My main ammo is fusion cores , I trade shells for fusion core to 1 friend who a shotgun build , and 45 to another friend
---
Phoenix in Watoga has it.
---
There was too many things broken about it and nobody was doing it so they took it down. It would make no sense to spend resources fixing something nobody is doing. Other than very small minority.
---
Fair enough. Wouldn‚Äôt be my cup of tea, that‚Äôs for sure.
---
This quest used to accept any Wendigo, now it has to be the Wendigo cave Wendigo... the rewards are ass and its not worth delving in that cave every day!
---
No problem, I'll send you my GT if you ever wanna play
---
Ok, yes there are a ton of things they need to fix. But don't you think it's great how fast they have responded to this problem. Don¬¥t you think it¬¥s great for them to respond this quickly to something a large group cares about. Why not feel empowered for that and then take it to the next level and get the same people with you to demand fixes for whatever you are unhappy about.
---
Make the ammo spinner part allow ammo to be deposited like scrip machine and terminal can be for purchases
---
As an avid member of the building community I very happy to hear that you are actively looking for a way to restore this ability.
---
One of the other changes to the camp building system in patch 21 that really limits building in the game is the removal of the ability to hang wall from roofs. I have built several camps that would not be possible without this mechanic. This is a very commonly used tool throughout the building community. Will you be making any changes that will allow to a wall to the bottom of another wall or to the bottom of a roof again?
---
The caps you have on your person is limited to 30,000, but the duped chrismas presents also gave you a range of caps so if a person has idk anywhere from 100 to 500 chrismas presents on there person they can buy out your shops, have u donated steel to the brotherhood of steel and received there care package type deal?
---
That's how the player character fits in power armor also
---
Jesus Christ, in terms of perk loadouts, Bethesda just needs to give the guy that made the mod for it forever ago a couple hundred dollars for his work and port it over to the main game.
---
Why? They already own it.
---
&gt; On perk loadouts:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; That's a ways out, I gotta warn everybody.
---
What's the liklihood they'll do something better - than the mods that already exist?
---
In which case, just as soon they focus on other things....
---
you're welcome bro :D
---
Industrial water purifiers and sell tatos. With green thumb you harvest two for one and with hard bargain maxed you get 2 caps per tato.
---
1 tato = 4 caps. You can plant a shit load at you camp, they don‚Äôt take up much budget. Even if you only sell 150 a day that‚Äôs 600 caps a day 4200 a week.......
---
I just don't like the newer fallout games, I'm sorry you can't really change that. Boss steel bros killing mutants and ghouls is here to stay, don't worry.
---
Yup all the essentials, and I play for the PVP and greifing so your camp building clout is trash to me üëå
---
Yah glitched had it happen a few time  I try running still happend went in to white spring and stoped
---
No, there‚Äôs already too many rifles. It would be pointless
---
That what I‚Äôm hoping , the possibilities are endless with fallout 76 
---
We could do dungeons in hospital, power pants , school. , mines  etc etc  the map is full of potentially dungeons locations
---
It might have been the naked super mutant, i haven't had that glitch in a really long time, like im talking from beta lol. I have had moments where those names super mutants move around like weeping angels. Like they're un Killarney, sat still and devoid of AI but you turn around and they're in a different spot. It's terrifying.
---
Maybe it's a pre fab bunker?  Not sure why this is so cool? I see glitching with the vendors in the future.
---
People complained it was too difficult and didnt want to put the work in.
---
I don't understand the people who said it was laggy or buggy.  Ran that thing 3+ times a night for months and it was the best damn content this game ever had.  Can count on 1 hand the amount of issues i had.
---
Every single person i personally met who said "it sucks i dont like it" completely changed their minds after we took them through it.  
---
People went in there on launch day not realizing it was progression content and didn't know what to do so it got a bad reputation.
---
Season passes should be criticized at every turn.
---
I was really hoping for an intelligence check to help with her collar!
---
Yah I don‚Äôt remember them making any comments about that in the actual video(now that I‚Äôve watched it). The way they described it was an alternative to increasing build budgets for the foreseeable future, which if we‚Äôre not able to develop our camp interiors anymore, then we‚Äôd still need a future build space increase.
---
The only real description of the mechanic I heard was it being a door that creates an instanced interior. Idk, personally feels like if it was a bunker they would have been more clear on that.
---
Is this on PS4? Cause I saw a camp just like this last night when I got on to buy three things from player vendors.
---
(The guy that had this camp I think I bought two bloodied weapons from him, a double barreled shotgun and assaultron blade.)
---
But it! Even with the problems it's still fun for $20
---
Yes but be careful. I did this and inadvertently did a standing pose and got shot dead seconds later.
---
Sorry I actually enjoyed it
---
Whoop whoop,
---
Still less creepy than most guided meditation videos on YouTube though. I like him, the creepyness is part of the experience.
---
Who goes on a junk run wtf just play the game lmao
---
Character locked so you have to be a herbivore and be addicted to chems to be able to use.
---
And if you get shot while emoting, it automatically loses a finger.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
yes, i'm joking
---
&gt; I disagree with the removal of this bug. As a level 20 getting suprised by a level 50 scorchbeast, scared into a Hornwright Shelter until it got bored and left, then sneaking away to almost run into a level 50 sheepsquatch is still one of my best experiences with this game.
---
Perhaps;  but as they mentioned, there would still be minimum levels.
---
On the other hand - having an item you need to get for a quest - in an area populated with level 60 enemies because of other players passing through - it's just frustration.
---
I use the Aligned Sniper Barrel, it fixes the whole inaccuracy problem, i dont have any other mods actually unlocked yet but im gonna check them out when i gain some bullion
---
Not ncr, they didn‚Äôt create those outfits. And they won‚Äôt form for dozens of years
---
Yes but it's hard to tell friend from foe in that mode!
---
Unaware of the reward for fucking rank five?  No, even money is on some troll.
---
lol
---
You give me hope
---
I‚Äôd love to see white springs be taken over by the enclave but based off recent trends from bethesda placing factions they will more then likely wind up in the mire or forest
---
Probably like Home Plate in Fallout 4.
---
Damn 20 mins in and you haven't had some scream at you in the comments for complaining about the game. Congrats dude.
---
Saving this to try out later.
---
BUT WHAT ABOUT INTERIOR WALLS?!?!??
---
Oh god.
---
Yeah not being able to scrap or get rid of the SS armor is a huge pain, i had alot chest/leg pieces taking up my stash space for DAYS. Should be able to scrap for a small chance at a legendary module? Maybe have a legendary perk for it that gives you a greater chance.
---
The lumber place south of Vault 76 had some lead pipes today which gives a bit of concrete.
---
Found 4 bags on New gorge bridge near truck with waste barrels. Take rad-x
---
Marked
---
Oh cool. I'll check it out then
---
Lol you're delusional if you think they will *ever* put outfits or camp items in the game to *earn by playing*. 
---
They'll be on the atom store. Fractured Steel bundle, 1500 atoms.
---
Lol,,, this would allow us to do that, AND WHY ARE WE YELING?
---
Yup had it happen bout a month ago near a place known for mutants had to run quite aways to stop the attacks which i couldnt see any attacker vats got no targets
---
You‚Äôre right I would t wish that on my enemies
---
Funny thing, I had an immortal mongrel today. I couldn't hit or target it, but it could attack and damage me. Ran around for 5 minutes trying to shake it, then tried luring it into some ghouls (it killed them and they couldn't hit it either). Finally jumped off a short cliff and ran some more, finally losing it.
---
It's affecting the whole server, the lag is ruining my walks into the wastes!
---
No unfortunately, it‚Äôs has a few mods for its pistol form but it can be a riffle or an auto pistol
---
No thanks. Put them in the game to be earned by actually playing.
---
Nice thanks for the bullet points!! Some exciting stuff there.
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Is there a visual bug that cause the arc not to show but still deal damage or were arcs never supposed to deal damage?
---
Bugs? No way, those are just features
---
What I mean by it is that some of the challenges require to take a picture of 10 radstags or cook ten dishes while wearing a chef hat
---
Agreed, basically how online games work. I'm not sure how they're going to improve armor much from where it is now though. There's a few things they can do, but they went big with regular armor all ready, not much left that would be worth a grind for. Weapons they could just add higher level versions of the ones already in game, with corresponding base damage increase. I just hope they lay off new gauss weapons until they fix them.
---
yall are a bit dramatic

Ask your doctor If Med-tek Vitalift is the right medication for you.

If erections last longer than five hours please contact your local health care provider. May contain trace amounts of strontium 19.

Yah donated, was just junk inside.  So those duped presents are full of caps?
---
It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve had the will to build a good house.
---
I‚Äôm currently living out of a steep bungalow with my items in a red rocket station.
---
Yes, that was me! I was still loading up my vendors when you came.
---
U need a fixer plan?
---
Skip the mic in game and instead use text mod (world chat, party chat, area chat and whispers, even trade channel).
---
While you‚Äôre at it, get the perk manager mod too (12 save slots to make your life easy, craft weapons, craft armor, repair, pick/hack, melee, rifle, heavy, etc, etc, it just makes your life easy to quickly swap perk load outs)
---
Those two are pretty mandatory for a fun experience. The rest of the mods are optional, but there are some other good ones.
---
Also, no you don‚Äôt get banned for using these. Bethesda always intended for fo76 to be moddable since before release.
---
Caps, junk, plans, alchol
---
You could buy 5.56 which generally sells for 1 caps. It‚Äôs pretty light. I have a mule with 175k on him.
---
Not to mention learning mods from scrapping as well. Start early and it won't be such a grind later.
---
I bet you‚Äôre fun at parties.

not sure, where you're looking at...

You don‚Äôt have to have a reason you don‚Äôt like the games. That‚Äôs fine. There‚Äôs no need to make up something or make false claims. 
---
You don‚Äôt enjoy them. That‚Äôs it.
---
I have close to 4k requisitions . Waiting for them to drop legendarys
---
Yes! That would be awesome.
---
I understand why but I think they‚Äôd still be useless unless they add in OP effects and damage buffs
---
That no exploit as a result of the ammo converter matters since the ammo factory exploit makes all the ammo people want. Do you even fallout?
---
Ah ok.  They‚Äôd have to have quite a few caps in each present.  Think I missed those so don‚Äôt know much about them
---
I unlocked it yesterday by scrapping chainsaws. There‚Äôs one that spawns consistently at the ranger station.

Ah an amazing suggestion that we all wish would‚Äôve been taught to us when we were low level.

Same. Can't wait to see a few Brotherhood NPC patrols around Appalachia next month
---
I wonder if Russell Dorsey will play a major role in both of the Brotherhood updates. Wouldn't be surprised in the slightest.
---
Yeah truthfully Fractured Steel being Winter 2020 was wayyyy to optimistic for us to think of. January seems like a perfect timeframe. Gives Bethesda enough time to do things.
---
Alright give me a bit going to do a dailey on red dead to keep up the weekly challenge
---
Jesus.I'm hundreds of drops in, no plan yet.
---
You lucky bastard.

You on PC?  I‚Äôm currently using a b/e/w lever rifle.
---
I kinda fell into that trap too, the daily challenge grind has actually burned me out from the golf and scrip grind, but I'm enjoying Nuclear Winter more than I have any right to, I hate Pvp, but this PvP feels fair so I'm almost always reaching the top 15!

No it can‚Äôt

Range from anywhere from 50 to 1000 per present

Yeah np just let me know when your on

What is so hard to understand? Luck is used for Better Criticals, Psychopath, etc. for Commando which are perks for criticals. I realize I made a mistake and actually meant Agility instead of saying Perception.
---
I read somewhere on here that that quest can be completed in a private world. Something about having to be the first person in the instance will let it work.
---
Ok now thats just disappointing. Smoke grenades would be fantastic for my stealth commando. Even if they don‚Äôt do much combat wise i would love to have them for roleplaying purposes. since my vats commando is based somewhat on the punisher.
---
Sex dolls. It‚Äôs a very very rare plan. It require 30 stable flux of each. 50 legendary modules. 10,000 gold.
---
Now you know why people really want the limits raised.
---
I personally can live with the graphics, but yes, server stability and performance need to take precedent before any graphics updates can occur. The next gens will hopefully give them the ability to do so, and even allow for greater updates that require improved system requirements.
---
I love that gun I used to grab it and a bunch of rounds head to that spot in the beginning with all the Deathclaws that quarry or whatever. I'd climb up the mine belt or onto a side of the quarry out of reach and snipe all the Deathclaws lol.
---
I feel pretty secure in my beliefs. You've just spent a fair few hours trying to convince a stranger their opinions are wrong.

I just really want Beth to do better.

That‚Äôs only true if that machine has product assigned. If it‚Äôs powered but empty and the other three are full but unpowered, your camp doesn‚Äôt appear on the map to non-teammates.

woh woh woh, I know I'm 2 months late to the party here, but there's a fridge? I swear I looked through the items and didn't see one. I would love a place to store food/plants so they don't go bad.
---
Sorry but why not just delay things right now and avoid having them delayed within the week they are meant to be release if they ain‚Äôt finished?
---
Yes that one needs to be powered, but it's unlikely that they all even get emptied as its easy to fill them with plans and ammo.
---
I found that the hunting rifle sucks for sniper build. Even with.50 receiver it‚Äôs just too weak and slow to deal out much damage before the target runs for cover. 
---
I switched to a scoped auto combat rifle with all commando perks. Much better. Almost too easy.

You can tap the trigger and get a few quick rounds off almost like a 2 shot...

This. Partly why I quit. It's purely annoying having the main story have you go through a place that normally is fine but turns into hell because some random high level player skipped in the general vicinity and turned everyone into monsters that will chew you up. Poor game design right there.
---
I doubt it but I hope the PA Displays will have multiple poses. Either way finally, I‚Äôve been waiting for PA displays since the Excavator Bone skin came out
---
Does the ammo converter even work yet?
---
One of the first ones I used got me a dragon. I thought I was so badass. I had a gun that could, supposedly, do like 500 damage in one shot.
---
After a few minutes I realized it was trash. Nothing but extra scap when they drop. I will they become something decent.
---
And now apparently, is floating too üôÑ 
---
 üêúüêùüêûüï∑ü¶Ç
---
Have you followed the game at all?
---
I always pass by Sacrament when I'm near Crater. Gotta keep my Flamer fed.
---
I thought the same, it's terrifying and unnecessary! The sound of a legendary enemy healing, combined with VATS targeting? ü§®
---
Ah small world eh? 
---
I thought it was a very cool camp, discovered I could set a camp thing on that pylon months ago but never built there cause the bog is scorched territory, didn‚Äôt wanna deal with scorched beasts. Ha ha
---
(Loving that Bloodied DB Shotgun with faster fire rate btw, I‚Äôve been running around killing stuff while listening to Music from Doom having fun with it since I got it. I‚Äôd love to get one of these with faster reload...)
---
Gamepass on both PC and Xbox. This also means lots of new players to entice with atom shop bundles.
---
I‚Äôm a shotgun build when I want to be ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You place a fallout 1st tent in a specific location and all the scorched spawn in a tight group right in front of the noise maker. Just mow them down with an explosive weapon.
---
Like the huge Watoga Underground?
---
It took you 2 hours at lvl 150?
---
We can only hope :|
---
Crafting Flamers gives you 50 fuel. When crafting the weapon to get ammo is more economically viable than just crafting the ammo then you know there's something wrong with how expensive the ammo is.
---
OMG I didn‚Äôt realize people were doing that on purpose, I thought the event was bugged‚Äî it‚Äôs done that every time I‚Äôve played over the past month or so
---
You're right... the SFE link on the chatmod page is out of date.
---
&gt; What are your opinions on the idea
---
My guess:  It relates to the bunkers.
---
It becomes a programmable way to let people enter or not.  Perhaps it even lets you permanently prevent people from getting in.
---
Rank 83 tbh
---
i love how in the trailer they‚Äôre showing off endgame guns for something you can do once. waaaay before you even able to get the gauss shotgun. indeed a waste
---
Violator and Reorganizer
---
I wear it all the time and i wish just one thing i got that was rare... Was actually rare.
---
Placement isn't too hard but if you mess it up and they spawn in you can't fix it. Can't wait for Bethesda to fix it. Can't let people get a bunch of easy exp.
---
Candle wax dripped onto dryer lint also works really well as a firestarter.  Saw this on an ask reddit thread a few years ago.
---
Nope with a but... it is a bad quality fallout in my opinion, but it can be enjoyed somehow.
---
Done my first few days ago and everything was dead when I got there. Private server so I was only one playing. Not to excited to try again.
---
Don‚Äôt share names on this sub, it‚Äôll get you banned for ‚Äúwitch hunting‚Äù.
---
The provisions and then the beret. Don‚Äôt know when the berets coming out yet, but everybody gets it, not just people who donated
---
TY, will give that a try!
---
Maybe 1 1/2? Never tried it before. Took my time checking everything out!
---
10 down votes? What¬¥s up, this is great news, we can come together for so many things, if we work together. I Can't see a reason why anyone would find this news a bad thing.
---
Not everyone has an uberleet build and gear or wants to rush things
---
I hope they bring an Enclave DLC to do what they‚Äôre doing with Atlas and the BoS. Isn‚Äôt Fallout 1 practically happening during the same time? (I remember reading about how The Master fell into the FEV while Fallout 76 happened. I just feel like there‚Äôs so many things you can do and it‚Äôs just a floor of vendors and 3 floors of nothing but nice scenery
---
I want to build a bunker so bad :( FREE STATES!
---
Pam: A fang banger ankle biter. Vamp limb damage vats 33% gauss rifle. Leggy, with a hell of a smack.
---
Ahhhh ok  I was under the impression we would get it when the challenge was done.
---
Not encouraging or using one tho
---
I saw the warning about not naming/shaming players and just reporting them, so I assumed it would be the same for praising them as well, so just to be safe I didn't.  
---
Thank you for the heads up confirmation though.
---
Ah gotcha lol. Yah, I prefer just looking up the lore online if I‚Äôm curious haha
---
Were you on a private server then?
---
Yeah me too
---
I would also like this, I wanna be able to click on someone‚Äôs name and click ‚ÄúSee on map‚Äù or something so I can look at their dot to find out what their level is. That way I don‚Äôt waste caps traveling to some dude‚Äôs camp in the forest selling 20 non legendary weapons or something.
---
She looks like Barrack Obama.
---
5 scrip is 5 scrip.
---
Yeah, been there done that. Makes me hesitant to even post here. Hell, can‚Äôt even reliably post images here.
---
Pleased with what I heard.
---
Love my daily Decon shower, lots of outdoor lighting ( just a preference), Junk extractor thingy, a couple of free water purifiers for the passers-by, two private water purifiers, and 4 vendors. Hey, don't judge! Lol
---
I'd have to see them hopefully they are like the walls the enclave used when they occupied project purity in 3
---
Super excited for all the new features, as long as they are implemented without messing up anything to much.
---
I could be wrong, but going by all the posts here on the sub, the beret is coming Tuesday. But that's according to the numerous posts here on the sub.
---
If your on PS4 my friend and I are about to play we will launch 3 nukes and run encrypted if you‚Äôd like to join
---
Tbh I just want a viable chainsaw with mods that actually work...doesnt have to have perks just let us have legendary versions and the ability to get LVL 50 versions with increased stats
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/422724/update-on-replacing-walls-in-c-a-m-p?language%255B%255D=en
---
Doesn‚Äôt really take an ‚Äúuberleet‚Äù build to finish quickly. Fun word though!
---
I've bought weirder shit lol
---
Oh...I did not see anything posted...sorry all
---
Can we can you dadooooo?
---
My sides lol
---
Lol you definitely did. This game is just a bugfest. I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm surprised it happened. Even when I fast traveled to Drop site V9 after launching there was a glitched out Scorchbeast just chilling there. I was messing around and kept bashing it and all of a sudden there was a weird noise and it vanished. Maybe that had something to do with the nuke changing location who knows ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
I think it would be pretty cool to stay some sort of questline where you track down any surviving members of the original patrons there, and try to get them to come back. Maybe you find some sort of protocol/directive holotape on a robot that malfunctioned when it was supposed to be removing the residents like all the other robots were. You then use this holotape to create some sort of clean slate program that resets all the robots up until the next New Years where the program no longer works and the robots try and ‚Äúrefurbish‚Äú again. It can be some kind of yearly event like where you have to create another program to reset the robots again. Just an idea though.
---
Run armor that's broken
---
Just like how the Wendigo quest was was coming this month? Doubt.
---
I don‚Äôt understand the second point, what does that mean?
---
The unlockable rewards for reaching the target donations will always be given some days later. The official release notes give the dates of the rewards
---
No armor or anything that gives DR. That includes perks etc also that affect DR. You can use passive damage reduction effects which do not increase DR like Lone Wanderer. You can use armor pieces if you break them (as broken armor don't give DR). Chinese Stealth suit is really good when broken.
---
Nice run!  I love doing junk runs.  Not only is it relaxing, but it stocks me up for plenty of weapons and armor crafting, repairs, etc.  Thanks for sharing this.  :)
---
A super weapon to aniahlate people who use emojis is reddit posts
---
August 11th in the atomic shop will be the beret
---
Thank you I knew there was a way and I couldn‚Äôt remember it. Doing it this way does it always hit for 3 sneak attack?
---
Clevercolt72517 gonna jump on a private real quick to shut off my shops tho
---
When you put something down near a world object it can be removed. Like a small tree or a bush or a rock. Sometimes they come back!11!!1
---
The couple of ghouls I saw before the cut off were dead too!
---
Where did you see that ? On fallout.com?
---
I sure hope so, Glow in the Dark Planets on one side and Glow in the Dark Stars on the other.. Getting the Captain Cosmos feel going

And,  no you cannot buy them yet. I am disappointed too btw
---
Cries in PC
---
I am on PS4!
---
Everyone goes on junk runs....most efficent way of getting materials and making ammo etc.
---
oh, 2hr way too much  
---
Me and my friend with shitty builds for first time launched nuke in like 30-40 minutes, lvls were &lt; 100  
---
Now, 150+ &amp; 200+ lvls - 20 mins max for silo+sbq altogether  
---
just in case - if you have hacker &amp; lockpicker perks, you may skip one step in the silo, just open the door and hack the terminal to open the next door(I'm pretty sure there is a video on youtube)  
---
But yeah, disconnects sucks
---
Bethesda is your ISP?
---
Unless you log back in within a few **seconds**, you'll get a new world, not the old one.
---
You can keep the halloween candy to eat or you can put it into the machine.
---
You will be able to build bigger underground camps but they will be instanced (like most indoor game areas)
---
Look at you, assuming I have friends lol.
---
I didn‚Äôt try to convince you that your opinions were wrong. I demonstrated that your supporting evidence was flawed and biased, and that you were incapable of presenting a specific example for debate. 
---
No one can prove an opinion right or wrong. That‚Äôs not how it works.
---
That‚Äôs the kind of word combo that can blow up in your face.
---
If you do it on a private server and your by your self, it becomes PvE and you get attacked by feral ghouls.
---
Gotcha, thank you for elaborating.
---

Randomly assigned ally from foe!

Works as pre war food for challenges.
---
I'll wait 4 u on private
---
I don't know if I'm just lucky or whatnot, but on PS4 all I get is an occasional frame stutter, and even that isn't often. Almost never disconnect.
---
Though I did have the same intercom issue when wastelanders dropped. 
---
One thing though. I find it hard to believe that you've played all the other Fallout and Elder scrolls games and you think 76 is the buggiest. 
---
To be fair, New Vegas was an absolute buggy piece of trash for a good long while. And not even "oops, gotta reload" bugs. 
---
Game breaking, can't finish the main quest, companions are gone forever, save file corrupt type bugs.
---
I actually have a video of me wiping out a max level death claw pretty quick with a chainsaw. The problem is it needs to be repaired to 200% to be somewhat viable and as the condition goes down so does the damage. One or two high level enemies are about it.
---
I was
---
I got fallout 1st when I started so I assumed it was a 1st reward like the scrap box.
---
Holy shit yes!
---
Me too - I haven‚Äôt missed a single challenge and get at least 3-4 bonus 10k xp daily.
---
Due to COVID pandemic nature is healing, even wasteland becomes so clear, so trees are starting to grow
---
Yeah the fridge should stop food from spoiling for a day or so
---
Seriously, like I said, it was pristine grass when I built. There were no trees there before.
---
They won‚Äôt let the event fail, guaranteed to just move the total to the finish near the end......
---
I knew it! The abominations from Mothership Zeta *ARE* canon!
---
It really is. Whenever I finish doing all the decent quests for the first time In the fallout games the first thing I do is look up on Google the vault locations and explore them lol
---
I keep my vending machines themed. 
---
- Stims &amp; Chems
---
- Plans
---
- Weapons and Armor and Ammo
---
- Tchotchkes and Baubles and Curios
---
I also price my wares very low. So it‚Äôs not uncommon for me to come home and one machine or neither is completely empty. 
---
And since I run a Decon Shower (30), an Acid Collector (10) and eight Industrial Water Purifiers (8x10), I‚Äôm already over 100 Power. So there‚Äôs no reason not to chain the four vending machines together.
---
I ran into graham at charleston station and he had them.  Forgot how much they were, but wasn‚Äôt crazy... maybe 100-200 range?!?
---
Shit's WAY too strong. Middle school boys make it hard to breathe sometimes.
---
"Request" for a specific type of supply...  "crap im out ballistic fiber"
---
Modding will likely be changes to Private Servers only like the ENB mods or Randy Savage Deathclaws in Fallout 4.  The only thing I could see transferred over to the Public Servers is Legendary Modifications where we change the legendary bonuses on our equipment to what we want instead of rely on the RNG gods.  Any cosmetic mod like Horse Power Armor would make more sense as an Atomic Shop purchase.
---
What are double walls? Or double wallpapers?
---
I'm not sure why you're still going here - you're very much okay with the substandard writing of Bethesda, so I'm not sure what we have to talk about.
---
Oh yeah there's no reason not to as while the vending machines take power, they don't use up a power charge, so they're free to plug in apart from the camp budget cost of the wire!
---
The events of fallout 1 take place like 80+ years after the bombs fell but I do think the master fell into the fev vat around this time. Fallout 76 takes place 25 years after the bombs fell so I don‚Äôt know exactly what the enclave is doing right now
---
Ok thanks, tbh, search on reddit never works right for me...
---
I haven't tried the text mod but that also requires other people having it. I. My experience a lot of people are shy of modding.
---
Perk manager is practically required.
---
I also recommend better health bars (shows %) event pop ups (making it more obvious when an event is starting) save everything (let's you type in amounts instead of using the slider) and I forget the name but one that shows your camp budget.
---
I'm low level and now I can use the bow more often thanks
---
If they don't revery the hanging wall change, then we still cant make courtyards and free standing walls.
---
Still fucks over some of us.
---
It's more likely an actual vertibird flown by the BOS.
---
Yah for the daily challenge.  If you actually have the ammo I need though, I‚Äôll buy 1, 2, then clean you out ;)
---
I would like to see Boston before FO4 takes place. Maybe introduce some of the visual story characters from their. Like the skeletons and stuff. I think that would be so freaking cool
---
I accidentally took an addictol the other day. It sucked but on a positive I changed around my addictions to better suit my build.
---
Yeah sure do. It‚Äôs a name I‚Äôve seen a ton.
---
Too small of a part of the community they shouldn‚Äôt waste their time on
---
So did you have people on it with you and the entire server crashed or did it boot you and not acknowledge the nuke launch?
---
Uh.... Ive been on reddit so long that I cant tell if this is sarcastic or genuine.
---

This is what I do for a bolt action pipe rifle build with a machete side arm

Nope, monthy like menstration

LOL, this my friend is called genuine optimism!

Lights, water purifiers, Bethesda servers.

It'S! SaTUrDaYyyyyyyYayYYYY! *shoots meatloaf*
---
By myself, private server. Got it to launch, got a pic after it landed as proof! Lol ‚ÄúServer disconnected‚Äù logged right back on, maybe I was too late??
---
Some materials are harder to come by or are used in greater quantities. Normal game play is likely not going to provide you with all the materials you need.
---
I personally like to go on junk runs every once in a while to stock up supplies. Most significantly, one lead run can usually give me enough ammo to play for quite a few days without having to worry about stopping what I'm doing to craft ammo.
---
I named my Medic's pump-action "The Hippocratic Oath"

What is it lol

Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
Uncle atom making his monthly visit.
---
Can confirm, I definitely never wear it. Still, I‚Äôd prefer it not come back. That was a limited time offer, so it‚Äôs a legacy piece imo. Will I be angry and feel betrayed or some shit if they bring it back? Of course not.
---
Yup, still seems very valuable
---
THIS.
---
What is this if I may ask?
---
Remove all restrictions, let us clip anything into anything! Let things hover! My Tinkerer's Piano is a work of art and Bethesda shall not take it from me!
---
Usually private servers last 5mins after. At least that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre supposed to do specifically cause of problems like yours. That blast zone should remain for awhile though. Shame it didn‚Äôt work that way. Only suggestion I have is to find someone else with 1st membership that you can play with so that if one of you disconnects the other can rejoin and the server won‚Äôt reset
---
I need an emote for ‚Äústop running noob I‚Äôm only here for your junk and 10 caps‚Äù
---
I can power all, plus turrets, with just one.
---
I think you may need to recalculate just how much energy  you're using.
---
Focus camera on highlighted player! Doesn't work if they're  not a friend or team mate and they're sneaking.
---
Oh, dont do that... come on Its Bethesda, thats what they do. They say they love us and theyll never do it again, but we both know what they really wanna do is f@ck our hooch of a coworker theyre always staring at when we go to work parties. We deserve better, someone who treats us right.
---
I get ghost punched a lot after doing Encrypted.
---
I feel like they probably don‚Äôt want wallpaper on the outside of buildings and are trying to figure out how to give us interior-only double-sided walls.
---
Did what now? They haven't actually done anything yet
---
Well I'm starting a Cult in the fo76 community all about deathclaws and I'm trying to expand it and I need more pastor vestments for the people I do have in the cult. I also want people to try and expand to diffrent platforms like Ps4 and Pc but it's kinda difficult.
---
A good cap sink is going around buying all the junk items you need to donate, sunk a full 8000 getting steel
---
It can be easily true. Being aware of all the issues with the game doesn't magically fix them. It's obvious that the devs don't get enough resources to work on all the issues...
---
Thanks
---
So why do you play the game if you feel this way? why are you taking the time of your Saturday night to post this? And why can't you rejoice that someone got their way?
---
Focus on perks that reduce incoming attacks. Blocker, serendipity etc. lots of stealth. It‚Äôs viable. Harder, but viable.
---
Yeah, they will never come out with a bunch of cosmetic rewards for progressing through a seasonal reward track.
---
5.56 is a pretty cheap ammo so it's probably not efficient to do a conversion. I'd just use the ammo factory for 5.56 or vendor hop and get it off players for 1 cap per ammo.
---
For Lead, grab an excavator and head to lucky hole mine. One run of that got me about 1000 lead scrap to turn into ammo.
---
Anything mechanical and deals damage does
---
Given their uncharacteristic quick response, and not one but two. I'm optimistic.
---
No probs, enjoy!!
---
Once a Scorched fell through the map and was beating the absolute brakes off of my ass through the floor.
---
When did they promise it? All I have ever seen is "it is coming in the future"
---
This problem should be addressed soon. Events will be changed so that as long as u participate you will be reward. Thats what I heard.
---
Maybe there is a Level Req for them.  I was under 20 when I made my trek.  I'll try again.  Thank you!
---
I still wear it. But just in Nuclear Winter.
---
What is up? Am i saying something wrong?  im just happy we got these quick responses and i thought the building community coming together was amazing. what is there to dislike?
---
Hmm sounds a little too good..
---
I don't care about that, what I'm asking is your opinion on people that do this.
---
For the record it aint me downvoting, its got me optimistic too... im just sitting on the toilet right now posting random comments on FO76 boards
---
The writing quality of Bethesda is approximate quality to Black Isles. The main difference is the quantity.
---
Every time you share your opinion, I‚Äôll do the same.  Is that a problem for you?
---
Will see. They might mean well but who knows what stupid route they will take to fix this. It definitely won't be to simply add double sided interior walls
---
Also, it probably won't be any time soon.
---
And, it will break something else.
---
Possibly a new dupe method
---
Yes
---
Wasn't there power armor displays in fo4? Why is it a pain to add to Fo76? Does it need tweeking?
---
I have 300+ for free in my vendor and no one has taken them, not worth it
---
Wow they throw you like 5 things that you can earn meanwhile there are fucking 500 things that you need to buy.
---
1 hour and moders didnt delete ur hate post. rule number 4?? hello?? 
---
yeah.. only haters are welcome here.
---
p.s.: sorry for ur bad experience. It doesnt happen to just anyone but u definitely r not alone. good luck!
---
In all honesty I have never launched a nuke... but how long does it take to get to the nuke area? I have never seen a sbq die before 7 mins were gone not to mention the 2 mins for the nuke to land.
---
I have one of each. Just need the chest to finish my T65
---
Or ultra light which is even better!
---
Agreed
---
Someone likes to take video games to *seriously*
---
I think you need:
---
^minecraft
---
^or
---
^sims
---
Just wait till a real nuke lands on your camp.
---
They are not adding double sided walls anytime soon, they are in fact going to make it so that we can do it the old way.
---
I am 3 months into my 12 months, and honestly don't know if I will be playing this game in another 3 months.
---
You don‚Äôt need an uberleet build to complete in a reasonable amount of time. My first attempt was 30 minutes with practically no legendary gear at level 60
---
It doesn't take long at all to get to the event, if that's what you mean.  Which is part of why I don't understand this complaint.  I've heard of sbq dying in &lt;1 minute, but never seen it.
---
You can slap it on the long rectangle one
---
I‚Äôd pay 1K script to be able to choose the weapon w random rolls, 10k to choose 1 of the rolls and 50k for 2  of the stars and 100k for 3 stars of your choice on the weapon you want.
---
Most likely because  they will have to make sure the mods don't effect non private servers and need a way to easily flag mods that can be used in private servers without any anti cheat triggering.
---
plz explain
---
fair enough! here¬¥s for hope
---
Nah, I just don't know who you're trying to fool. No one thinks Beth can write to a level comparable to just about any other RPG developer.
---
Dump the legendaries.  Problem solved.
---
Weird, every time I joined a battle like that, she flew during the whole battle, I would've been pissed off if I was on my unarmed fighter!
---
Where exactly did you hear this? As i have never heard or seen this mentioned anywhere before. Kinda thinking that is just some hearsay..
---
Well the thing is that this is an online game killstealong is going to be a thing. Once more the SBQ was meant to be fought with a large group. A 1v1 fight is not possible unless your using exsploites or cheats.
---
All that said I think people who instant kill any legendary enemies are dicks. The blackwater mine event is annoying as while you can get some nice people who will make sure everybody tags the legendary. You always run the risk of getting a dick who comes in and one shot it.
---
Ok good. I was wondering if there were some super op weapons/builds that I have never heard about.
---
This is crazy but I'm very thankful for this post getting more than 100 upvotes getting onto the hot posts section and I appreciate you guys helping in getting this post noticed!
---
I'm gonna guess on Tuesday when they update Atomic Shop
---
Yeah they changed it some time early last year. Supply drops are considered "owned" by the one calling them in and looting ones that aren't yours is considered stealing, so you get a bounty.
---
They didn't have wallpaper at all in FO4.
---
I look forward to come back when this new storylines and areas come out. I had over a hundred hours of playtime before I ran out of stuff to do and I had a blast throughout.
---
Ok thats possible
---
I'll be on in 5 minutes my gt is MRmicloven8 I think I can make DGs for the cause.
---
Ive never taken mine off, don't you know that's how the aliens alter your brainwaves?
---
I agree it's rude in radiation rumble, for example during Uranium Fever, but with sbq some player has to initiate it.  In my example, if I hadn't bothered to, no one else would have even gotten a chance at rewards.
---
"Tyson's fist" for a Bloodied Swing speed + strength Boxing Glove!
---
Running what I call a Reaver (unarmed unyielding + bloody/vampire), and this is very appealing to me. Need more info.
---
What do you mean?
---
The quest "An Ounce of Prevention" is bugged. I cannot get passed the part where I need to analyze the sample. I put the sample in the centrifuge, and then I put the fuse in. Went to the terminal and tried to analyze, but it gives an error saying I need to load the centrifuge. Tried relogging (quit to desktop as well) and changing worlds numerous times to reset the quest objective, but each time ends with the same error at the terminal. In fact, each time I relog, I'm able to put the fuse in, but the sample is already in the centrifuge. Bethesda says it's a known issue and to do what I did to resolve the issue, but it doesn't work. Just started playing the game and I'm already stuck because of this bug. I will likely have to create a new character and hope the same thing doesn't happen :(
---
&gt;A 1v1 fight is not possible unless your using exsploites or cheats.
---
That complete bs. I solo Queen and Encryptid event all the time without any cheats or exploits. Everything in this game can be soloed legit. Even the upcoming new colossal boss.
---
I accidentally built two and couldn't get myself to scrap it so I just keep it around
---
2 hours! Back when i was level 80 i could do it in 20 minutes
---
Yes, sad to say but I've become very cynical whenever they promise anything. IF any of these features make it into the game it won't be for a veeery long time.
---
When I donated supplies, I was expecting to get bos paint plans but nope.
---
Sure do!
---
Sadly not fixed with May update. Same problem on Xbox one.
---
Didn‚Äôt they make it form where anyone can pick one up when called in to one the person who called it can be the one to take the stuff, honestly stupid
---
I have a similar thing [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
Glad someone else can get some use out of it!
---
I... had never thought of this. You've changed my life.
---
Interfacing with this appliance is frustrating in all aspects pre/post patch. It's like the bank turning you away because the roll of quarters you wanted in cash was short a few coins...
---
r/fallout is a circle jerk over New Vegas, which I find nearly unplayable and plain bad on the terms it's supposed to be good -- role-playing and story -- and awful on game world and game play. At best it's mediocre, but they've elevated it to godhood.
---
Htf are perk loadouts a ways off?? Any experienced Fallout modder could probably whip something up in a week. Gah, it's infuriating.
---
Thank you!
---
I did the mama dolces thing and I cant figure it out at all and I dont even know where to put the code. oof
---
I love playing it every day (admittedly play it way too much), but think that all the score challenges should be achievable over a week instead of daily and separated by 7 tiers once one tier of challenges (which would be equivalent to a days worth of score challenges) is complete, you move on to the next tier.
---
Now you made go an look it up on the LR game board.  19 cosmetic paint jobs  as season rewards (I think I missed some of the ghillie paints) and 6 unique camp items.   Sure it would be nice if there were more, but let's stick to the facts when discussing this.  
---
As far as things that "you need to buy", what would those be?  As far as I know, nothing "needs" to be bought from the atom shop.  There are plenty of in game plans that can be earned or bought with in game caps to decorate you camp with.
---
I would say yes, but also ask why? You may as well play on a private server.
---
Yeah it is not the most intuitive thing to find - I‚Äôll pm you so as not to add any spoilers here ...
---
If you don't have 1st.
---
This would have been a much better quest! Clowns are already terrifying, so why not up the fear factor by unleashing Clown Gollum on Appalachia?
---
Best way to make money tbh. Gonna do it again once instanced camps come out.
---
It‚Äôs interesting that you feel you have the authority to speak for the entire fan base.
---
Tell me, why don‚Äôt we hear the same ‚ÄòBethesda can‚Äôt write‚Äô comments about Skyrim?
---
Two situations I've done it:
---
1.  Laziness.  Could I have wired it - for 1?  Yes.  But I just had two seperate networks.
---
2.  Current base has 11 industrial water purifiers.  So, yeah.
---
We do.
---
&gt;Expansion will be very similar to Wastelanders as a structure.
---
Another faction to grind rep for...
---
^hello ^darkness ^my ^old ^friend
---
Funny thing is they said that once a week all of Bethesda plays it in that interview from today.
---
HAHAHAHA
---
Did you read the post? Learning mods was mentioned.
---
Gotta find a different outlet or game.. from what Im taking away from Quakecon is that the focus is on ESO and Quake and probably developing the nextgen Elder Scrolls and Fallouts. To me it makes alot of sense that theyre not putting a good amount of effort into 76 becuase eventually theyre going to abandon it. I love the game, but what company is going to invest in something that wont make them as much money as another thing would?.. its sad, cuz like you mentioned this community is gold.
---
Bethesda *always* finds a way
---
Just switch to a different weapon and then back again
---
it would probably work like the bunker just appear to work horizontally (even though its still a completely different setpiece.) I am interested to see how the exterior will effect it tho.
---
Plus the reward is crap for all the effort.
---
Well the deathclaw disciples are a small group/cult who look up to deathclaw for they are fierce predators of the wasteland that can tear through flesh in seconds. Do would you like to join and spread the word.
---
several time i've seen the event pop up, and as soon as i could fast travel, the pop up saying it was over came up.
---
personally, i don't get it on any level.  like, not just the not sharing part, but also the whole "get gud until press button god" mentality.  the game is meant to be fun and challenging, so have fun and challenge yourself.
---
i'm not saying shoot your build in the foot, but how is one shotting the biggest beefiest nastiest thing in the game... fun?  what does that mean about all the rest of the content?  do the the one shotters just wander the wasteland sneezing on enemies so their mere presence doesn't kill them?
---
Hazmat suit is da wae
---
Like into a gauss rifle?
---
Enjoy it mate. Find a high spot with a view, build your camp and enjoy.
---
Trying to attain the highest possible damage is in and of itself fun, imo.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
For accurate up to date info, as they're using data mined info.
---
The official page isn't updated very often!
---
Not that I‚Äôve seen. Not anywhere near the Fallout griping. Isolated whining at best. 
---
I enjoy the content Bethesda has provided. And the fact that Skyrim has sold so many copies is a testament to how many people enjoy the game.  
---
Explain to me how a role-playing game can sell 20 million copies but have ‚Äòbad writing‚Äô.
---
I totally did that!
---
Thanks!
---
You are being sarcastic right? This game would have looked great 10 years ago.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt hold your breath. Communication throughout the lifespan of this game has been terrible, and often only sparked by outrage. ITV‚Äôs ignore issues that the player base has been yelling about for months, and they can‚Äôt even be relied on as release calendars when release dates slip so frequently. The devs don‚Äôt want more exposure as a lot of what they‚Äôre promising is still so vague, and more exposure means more accountability for those issues they‚Äôve been trying to ignore for the past year or so. 
---
In short, from their perspective anyway, there‚Äôs a lot to lose and little to gain from this suggestion. It being hard to understand what they‚Äôre actually doing vs what the articles say they‚Äôre doing? I feel like that‚Äôs very much by design.
---
People keep screaming botched updates but never had any issues with updated.
---
I think adding a ton of more emotes would be something i actually spend my money on. Also emotes to send basic messages to your party to give them more commands to organize your parties activities without need a mic.
---
yeah i still get the issue even when relogging afterwards
---
It would be nice if the berets had atleast an effect.. like a 2% more yield when scrapping junk or items. Or a boost to Scrapper perk
---
I'm on now. Shoot it.
---
‚Äú...again‚Äù
---
Dont relog. The issue usually only occurs when logging in for the first time
---
Maybe your computer is old but all my settings are at the highest so it looks great.
---
Right now two shot and explosive guns are shit, great at tagging multiple enemies but not for actually dealing damage at all!
---
It's not about the reuse of assets as in certain models or textures. I'm talking whole cloth copy and paste with little to no addition.
---
You watch. Past history has shown that this is precisely what Bethesda will do. If it isn't the GNR CC, it'll likely be a Fallout 4 destination. Forget about going back to the DC ruins or the Big MT.
---
I'd be more than happy to be proven wrong but this is Bethesda we're talking about. This is a pretty safe prediction.
---
*cough cough* COMBAT ZONE *cough cough*
---
Or... it‚Äôs a bug/mistake
---
I'd be willing to bet they are doing one vault first to judge popularity and build off that.
---
and it never did before. literally everytime i relaunch my game this happens.
---
You and me both....
---
People actually want this?
---
Well that's strange. Look a lot harder, because Beth's writing quality had been dropping since Oblivion.
---
on ps4 here.... and somehow this latest patch broke either my router or my lan cable.  seriously.  i have tried ALL of my online games.... and they work fine with the hardwired connection.  overwatch, elder scrolls online, conan, soulcalibur, ALL OF THEM!
---
but about 10 mins into fallout 76... "lan cable disconnected" errors.  and once they pop up, i can't get logged back in at all.  i can go and play other games fine, but fallout 76 won't work.
---
but get this.... over wi-fi?  THE GAME WORKS FINE??!!??  played for hours, not a single error.  restart the game with the cable plugged back in.... nope.  same issues.
---
the breadth of problems this game has.... never ceases to amaze me.  and before anyone asks, i have done extended playing and testing, this is happening, i'm not making it up, and it is utterly dumbfounding me.
---
Yes.. so like I said. Swap your weapons when you first log in. And dont relog if possible
---
Honestly I got some bugs on the other games too but I fixed most of them with the console, Im pretty sure its impossible here
---
&gt;I keep wondering how the hell are they going to handle modding in a game like this, it seems like there would be a lot of compatibility issues unless modding is only allowed on FO1st private worlds and everyone must have the same mods installed.
---
Isolate chacter to private only so once 1st runs out you can't access that chacter.  Just like every other game.
---
This was actually my build and though they called me a "trap camp master" the title was a bit misleading because most of my builds (and most of the builds in the stream) are more games than traps. I have however built several traps that I had become well known for (primarily the deathclaw maze) and while I make a lot of camp builds that are meant to be crazy and unexpected (but done in good humour) I often share the trap camp moniker with people that have more malevolent intentions.
---
I would say that while there are people that use trap camps to be a nuisance/steal junk there also are many more of us that just want to make games, mazes, puzzles and other types of builds as a kind of player encounter. "Traps" are one of the few player interactive elements we have in the camp, so builds often revolve around these as they're functionally able to do the most.
---
I am yet to see one in the wild, saw a dead one in Watoga though :(
---
Oh my, in ESO you get all the Crowns at the same time.
---
Ok, ill do that. does it happen to you to?
---
Thanks for a well-written and insightful post.
---
Content priority and the need for balance. Mod makers do not have to deal with either.
---
If I recall this only occurred for my friend when he had his flashlight on.
---
  
---
Dave
---
That‚Äôs not an answer to my question:
---
*How can a role-playing game sell 20 million copies but have ‚Äòbad writing‚Äô.*
---
No
---
I remember saying exactly that to a friend about that mine that is now going to have the new event.  Place sure looked empty.  Too empty.  Just like the inside of the whitespring and all the in accessible rooms.
---
Can you have motion assist and a jetpack at the same time?
---
Welcome to the game, you must be new.
---
Ok thanks, i was in an argument with a friend and i was decently sure they weren‚Äôt legacy.
---
Yep. Same weapon too
---
I sure am lol
---
i suppose that's why i'll never be an accountant.  the hard numbers don't impress me.  i want to play.
---
[Here are the drops.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3o7ar/fortifying_atlas_donors_provisions_drop_list_and/)
---
Nope just costly because they are fun and awesome.
---
good job!
---
There is a 'health/condition' indicator bar when you are looking at the item in any menu. It looks like a little health bar and says ' CND '
---
Agreed. Maybe since they said there is "drama" in the Brotherhood l, Fractured Steel will literally mean the BoS in Appalachia had a "Civil War" of sorts, possibly introducing an early form of the Outcasts.
---
I enjoy min/maxing, idk.  Not all the time though.  I want 1 sbq fight where I instakill it.  The other thing would be less bullets used.
---
I have been playing for a few months after quitting right after it first came out. The game today is nothing like the game that was released. The camp budget, stash space and npcs have all been increased. 
---
The party system for joining randos is awesome and the events are finally worthwhile and possible without having 100 people in your friends list to find one available to help.
---
Idk the times. That's just what i use to keep track of what's close, so I can eat it before it spoils
---
I actually like her a lot. She adds so much personality to the radio. Brought a smile on my face when I head it
---
Easily. Mainstream audiences don't value writing in RPGs. The majority of AAA successes have pretty bad, gamey writing.
---
More simplistic writing is valued for big hits.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
At the same stand point I‚Äôm not sure how anyone can take the endgame seriously all the weapons you wouldn‚Äôt want for your build are the broken weapons that melt the sbq...the sad thing is Bethesda hasn‚Äôt done anything to address them in years
---
Yes I did read the post. I must have missed that part. My response was in no way meant as an attack on you or your post.
---
RIP the arena we already had well before Wastelanders at Pleasant Valley.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs great looking on pc, but on my PS4 it is a 20 fps ‚Äúwelcome to 2008‚Äù experience.
---
I would love it if they just let you convert from your stash box. And the ‚Äòfix‚Äô makes it easier to make a mistake and buy instead of sell, and the original one atleast only had an option is you actually had that specific ammo.
---
Na been playing since it came out
---
Enclave fags are mad thats why.
---
Looting or just lockpicking an unopened one? Because I swear I occasionally come across just a random crate with that flare and that's got stuff in it with no bounty for taking it.
---
I have 3 in mine, think I have 12 of the big water purifiers and 10 of the ground ones, plus some turrets and my vendors
---
Yooooooo but don't make them atom shop items or if they are, make them free.
---
I have 2 because 1 looks a little thin, 2 next to eachother looks a but bulkier and makes for an interesting centerpiece when decorated. (Also im literally just powering 1 single vendor and thats it) :)
---
Noob question:  legacy...?
---
I‚Äôm in love with all of this except the allies, where‚Äôs my truly evil ally Bethesda :^(
---
Patch notes say he is bugged right now
---
Let's not even mention that I've only ever had to do that qyest once...
---
In other words, you‚Äôre smarter and wiser than the fan base, and you get to judge the quality of writing with more authority than them. 
---
Got it.
---
Definitely some details would be nice....such as
---
.WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
---
Yup.  Quarenteen
---
There was definitely something more planned to be there because of all the locked resort rooms and a large locked room in the hotel itself. 
---
If I remember right, there was a cut enclave event that involved making a new president, something similar to Nuclear Winter making a new overseer, that was based out of the large locked room. It also may have involved the ballot printers around the map.
---
What the fuck did I expect. This is the same group represented by Tom Howard. The man who said the shitty settlement build ‚Äújust works‚Äù. No a matter of fact it doesn‚Äôt.
---
You think when we say ‚Äúgive us more budget‚Äù it means we want two sided walls gone. One when the walls are placed it creates two walls worth of thickness and budget. What exactly was the problem.
---
At this point we need receipts of how people used this to cheat or glitch the game. 
---
You are proving to me the this current team is incompetent and lacks any brain cells to not fix what isn‚Äôt broken.
---
The modding community has take the hot garbage pile that is fallout 4 (and it‚Äôs over priced, shitty DLCs) and made an actual game.
---
If the enemy is in the middle of an "animation", your VATS shots are very likely to not register at all. 
---
I find most of the times that Scorchbeasts don't take any damage if they are landing or doing that "green fog/plague attack" thingy, so I have to wait until they are done and then I can start shooting again, and this always works for me.
---
Don't know what causes it, but knowing this at least you can't prevent yourself for wasting ammo.
---
I thought they said they would be doing that, but not right away.  I could see the ammo converter being an exception.  It was so low in the season that it should really be given away free once the season is over.  Either add the plans for it to the leveled lists or put it up as a freebie in the Atom Store immediately so that new players can get it.  Other stuff should be put up for sale in the store no earlier than during Season 3.
---
Si
---
Yea I seen the tweet thread and understand. I don't have an issue with one myself. But it's almost poetic them sharing a "Trap Camp" as they put it in the midst of all the stuff going on with the camp community. Surely one can see the irony.
---
Congrats on the reshare though! I hope you're not catching too much grief.
---
Unobtainable items, such as explosive energy weapons. Previously available, then removed from drops, but still exist if you already had them.
---
YOOOOOOOOOOOO I will be sticking around then. 
---
The seasons grind has been killing me.
---
If I see any of you start simping for Purveyor Murmrgh... I‚Äôm gonna be right there with ya, buckaroos.
---
It's a known bug. Supposedly was fixed last patch but it only made it worse. So sit tight and hold on
---
No problem! I use them in my displays too.
---
its a bug where only one person on the server can do it.  What platform are you on? You need to complete it on a private server
---
Market trends aren't a meritocracy. The best and strongest ideas often don't sell the most copies. 
---
You'll get it.
---
maybe i just suck at this game, but past the starting levels i have had 0% trouble keeping myself in stock of the ammo i need.  could be my weapon choices though.
---
ammosmith, super duper, and keeping an eye out for the scrap.
---
.44, .5mm, shotgun, and .50 balls fyi.
---
Perk loadouts seem like the kind of feature a single dev should be able to knock out in a day if they had to...
---
Xbox. I'm not buying fallout 1st just to get a private server.
---
I don't even care if they buff the atoms or instead make each wood scrap count and keep the atoms the same.  One of the things needs to change.
---
 It's the last challenge I have left in that tab aside from the repeatable and it makes me rage that I cant move on to clearing out "combat"
---
I use a gauss minigun, so I never find any ammo and it's expensive to craft. :(
---
&gt;Mod support update or progress? Working on it. Codenamed "Heavy Lift" for the body building lead on it. And is a big effort as well thus the name. Won't be drag and drop like previous FO/TES games due to client-server architecture. But still working on it. No timetable.
---
That sounds to me like they're never releasing a creation kit tool and the mods will have to be released/sold via the Atomic Shop, like CC is for Fallout 4.
---
It makes some sense since you don't want say cheat mods affecting the public game but at the same time, say good bye to game-changing mods for private servers too without having to pay for it.
---
It'll be modding, for those that can afford it.
---
This is awesome, I don‚Äôt have to stop playing Fo76 now because they are adding a feature where players will be able to ‚Äúleave Appalachia‚Äù.    
---
       
---
I always like it when there is an official way.
---
Stimpaks are easier to get once you're higher level so to those of us with enough caps to travel around the map looking at shops, they're of no value.
---
Lower level players may need them more but don't have caps to waste traveling between all the camps out there.
---
You're better off using the scrapper perk if you're high enough level to get it, then scrap weapons and armor (not clothing) to get more scrap; and actually loot everything you see.  If it's not stuck to the background, it's for your pockets. Then bulk a bunch of scrap to sell to the traders and robot vendors.  Keep all lead.  Don't wipe out your scrap completely though.
---
You could vendor those stimpaks to get faster return as well.  Vendor alcohol too.
---
You're unlikely to have much for people to buy until you're high level.  Keep putting ammo in but make sure it's priced well.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna drain all my stats for 25 perception, I‚Äôm just gonna max out all commandos, max adrenaline, and maybe some other stuff
---
I agree, I‚Äôve said it before but I‚Äôd love some Vault 76 stuff. One example would be a Vault 76 version of the Courier Duster
---
Damn hippies....
---
Unless they're working on a next console version of 76, I read somewhere earlier that next gen owners that owned Bethesda titles would be eligible for a free upgrade from current to next gen
---
Go to atlas and talk to the guy, he'll tell you what he is looking for. Unlike other events this one is always on, and you can give him stuff at any time
---
Ah gotcha, I just took that as mid-September
---
All vendors share the cap pool of 1400. Which resets 20 hours after you first sell something to them. If you buy something from a vendor it will put a small portion of the cost to the pool, slightly refreshing it.
---
Yeah dude I‚Äôm like level 73 and know what the prices should be. But it‚Äôs like dead rn
---
I cant tell if this is sarcasm. some of these perks would be very overpowered.
---
lol  sorry i would help but im on PS4.  Im sure someone will see this and add you.  or try server hopping to see if you can get a server where someone hasnt done it recently.
---
Had that happen with my junkies gauss shotgun. 2 hits to kill a stupid firefly at the path to enlightenment. 1st hit took it's health down by 50%
---
The spread sheet that someone made has it ending on 9/7/20.
---
Hey if there as expensive as there are on the pts they better be overpowered
---
Yes, I would much rather get some ammo points instead of 3 missiles ever again
---
It should filter into the concrete goal since it'll prolly be near impossible to complete
---
As far as ive seen, most of the legendary perks really look like they are worth it.
---
*Bloodied Explosive enters the chat*
---
All good ideas!
---
No, that‚Äôs okay. The ***Gamer God***^tm has spoken. 
---
He knows better than Interplay and Bethesda about whether or not Nuka-Cola Bottlecaps would be valid currency in the fictional universe they created or now own.
---
*He sees all.*
---
*He knows all.*
---
***Bow before his wisdom.***
---
I see wish lists like this and I think about one of the things that was taught early on at management training in my first dev job;
---
If you have a project that is consistently, say, 20% behind on a project, the plan to get back on track can NEVER be "We'll work at 120% for the next phase and catch up."  You just finished collecting hard data saying that your team in fact works at 80% of the desired capacity.  That's the amount of work you're going to keep getting with that team.  Putting together a new plan that says they'll work at 120% means you're just going to be even further behind the next milestone.
---
Since you're too lazy to use the [subreddit's search function](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/search/?q=enforcer&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on) 
---
Basically, the crippling effect will no longer proc correctly with explosive and gauss shotguns. This greatly affects me, a gauss shotgun build user.
---
I HAVE to know what game from a AAA dev from the last 5 years you've played that you thought looked uglier. Not saying this game can't look good but it can sure look fugly lol
---
Damn...
---
Honestly, I was in a rough patch for a couple years, did some soul searching, and realized that I never really smiled unless I was doing something to make someone else happy. Then I figured out all I wanted was to help others and make their day better, the world is a dick sometimes, but we don't have to be
---
munition factoryÔºåof course
---
You literally had to go into the legendary run board and redeem it.
---
I hope so. 
---
I'm going to download FO76edit later tonight and do a little datamining to have a look myself.
---
I was the same way up until a few months ago, Resolute Veteran and all. Literally couldn't even go higher than Toxic Valley or Ash Heap without ending up shooting foam and being made of paper without it. I finally had enough and just went for the Black Market approach cause even with Fasnacht getting me a full set of perfect roll 3* Unyielding Combat Armor (I don't play Bloodied so I didn't want it) I couldn't find anyone willing to trade me a single Explosive Radium or even an Explosive Fixer. Now my luck is still terrible, but at least I can launch a nuke.
---
I like the sounds of all of this, but Bethesda has hurt us before... I am so excited for all of this tho.
---
I bet I'm not going  to miss much after I block you.
---
\+40% Damage from Sneaking? +30 Special? I'll admit most are crap, but there's good ones.
---
I still wear it.
---
you could always just farm the modus vendors.  seen oodles of it for sale there.
---
tried doing the whole gauss rifle thing in this game, the charge up sucked deathclaw balls.  wasn't bad in previous games, but the addition of lag and the multitude of bugs led me to split the difference and become a black powder fanatic.
---
If you're doing commando 15 perception is a must. That's as high as any special can go. The other 10 is from armor/ mutations etc.
---
Issues with recent updates (just recent ones I can think of)
---
\- Adrenaline perk not working
---
\- SBQ not able to get crippled
---
\- fast travel not working
---
\- lag near meat piles
---
\- colossal problem wasn't released when they said it would be
---
\- deep pocketed mods for SS not available even though the update says they were
---
etc.. No issues? someone is delusional...
---
I mean, based on past performance you'd have to be crazy to think they're not gonna fuck it up.
---
The way I see it there's a lot of cool stuff you can do and build with camps but they also made a mistake with the last patch and haven't given camps a lot of love and attention. These two things aren't mutually exclusive, so I hoped with the stream that people would find new and unexpected stuff they could build with the current system while still advocating for changes/revisions. The tweet came across weird and without a lot of context though.  
---
Feedback has mostly been positive but people will always have lots of different opinons about things. I'd recommend checking out the Creative Camp Building stream if you want to see what it was about.
---
You can find Russell at ATLAS, there are boxes stationed around you can donate directly to. As far as meat week, assuming it's like last time, it's a public event that will take place every hour
---
I did it in 29 minutes at 59 armed only with a nocturnal rolling pin
---
I was very surprised when fallout 4 and 76 both came out and there was no option to duel wield single handed weapons
---
I'm having this issue as well. I had hoped I wouldn't run into this again but here I am. üòï
---
Meat Week has not begun yet if I recall correctly.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs a part of Steel Dawn. It‚Äôs one of my favorite items in Fallout 4, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll bring it back, either as an Atomic Shop item or as an endgame quest reward.
---
Meh, the party hat goes best with it anyway ;-P
---
Desert eagle in .44 would be cool.
---
100% i‚Äôd just try gamepass for a month. It‚Äôs cheaper and you can see if you like it. If not, tons of other games to play on gamepass.
---
If you haven‚Äôt played it yet, you should try outer world. The makers of fallout new vegas made it and it has a similar vibe but in space. It‚Äôs also on gamepass.
---
I like how it makes them your loading screens. Really encourages you to take cool pics.
---
Yeah well if they nerf bloodied builds the forums will be up in arms. They'll spew fourth a wave of toxic salt the likes of which would exceed even the salt wave of the double wall fix
---
&gt;!It should totally be fking nerfed tho!&lt;
---
wow that sucks, only 1400.. anyways thanks for clearing thinks up
---
Any instanced interior addition would have to be separate from your existing open world camp. More than likely a hatch or doorway leading into the instanced interior. There would be no feasible way to extrapolate your open world camp *as* an instanced interior. I'm guessing curent open world build limits would stand as is and the instanced interior would be an addition to, not a replacement of. Too many permutations of crazy camp builds to reconfigure the open world space as the instanced interior. For instance,  just because one person happens to build a perfect enclosed space that would possibly work as an instanced interior, there are possibly hundreds of other random thrown together camp combinations that could never come close to functioning as an instanced interior. By nature, it would have to be a separate load in space, led into by a special door or some such. This is where you could possibly have greater build budget and more options.
---
Another issue is, you are constantly rewarded legendaries and you get them endlessly from events. Is it really good gameplay design to not let players use those  rewards in a meaningful way instead of having to deal with constant limitations? They should make it so there is an alternative to scrip. That's why i suggested a chance at legendary modules or something from scrapping.
---
At the very least legendary from events can be sold to a vendor. However that doesn't fix longer play sessions where you want to play more than a hour or 2 and your completely out of caps/scrips/etc.
---
They should allow limited scrips for items, reduced amounts after daily limit runs out.
---
I could totally see Dwight putting a chicken coop in the office.
---
Thanks for keeping us in the loop on your weapons
---
Gauss minigun is much better then the rifle.  Also imI use 5000+ rounds per irl day.  I could never farm that much if it and I would go broke.  Crafting it is semi manageable.
---
Exactly reminds me of fun times
---
ok thanks alot man. ur awesome
---
Yea allot. Bu compared to months ago this all is nothing
---
Who you thinks making all those drugs the blood eagles are using?
---
Takes alot of power
---
You could, but it‚Äôs going to make it a little difficult to tell me how the crappy event rewards next year are the same as the year before.
---
Cheers mate. I hope your future is better than your past.
---
I have a sort of similar issue with my headphones.  Wired headphones work fine.  My bluetooth headphones or other wireless headphones (regardless of communications protocol) will work fine right up to where I enter a server, then it's The Sound of Silence.  
---
I think somehow this application gets screwed up on how to communicate and is trying to manage the entire stack by itself rather than letting the Operating System handle communications - which is one of the many features an Operating System was written to do so coders don't have to code their own drivers with each and every application they write.  I wish I could talk to the guys who wrote this to find out what the hell is going on here, there are more bugs in this game than in Northern Manitoba in the summer.  And if you've never been there, that's the OTHER function of your ice scraper - to scrape a half inch thick layer of bugs off your windshield every couple of miles.

Oh, that sneak perk does sound really good tbh
---
Besides wastelanders

---
Literally I have 4 running and its just because I forgot that I stored one and then built a new one and then found the one on stored and then the cycle repeated.....
---
Thanks Boba, very cool
---
God I hope so. If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm totally building an armoury to ‚Äúdisplay‚Äù all the weapons and PA currently wasting space in my stash.
---
I just server hop and hit the gym at the prison courtyard and swipe the weights. Lots of lead.
---
&gt; Shout out to this other person's guide where I looked up most of the locations while planning my route 
---
Wait, so you're going to take these people's work and you're not going to even bother to credit them by name?
---
Bit of a dick move dude.
---
I mean compared to months and months ago

The cap economy is inflated enough already. If there want a daily limit, it would be insanely easy to hit the 30k cap within minutes.

EVERYTHING
---
If you side with the raiders you can visit her in the space station interior at the least. üôÉ
---
Thanks all! I should have just gone there as intuition told me, but thought it should be showing up somehow in the map like other events
---
Me too! I put one of the bobblehead displays by his desk... Angela's corner has cats, Creed has a guitar, and Meredith's desk is the Chemistry bench... Lol! I had too much time on my hands!
---
Yo are you having trouble loading textures alot. Its making me seriously consider getting a ssd
---
That would be game dev issue. Also happy cake day
---
Done in the fashion of FO4‚Äôs Vault Tech Workshop it could work ok.
---
There's an easy fix they can do even with the current UI for it.
---
Assign each ammo type a value for a single unit.  Like 1pt for a single 10mm round.  Then add a "convert all" option for the ammo types.  Bam, it takes all the ammo of that type in your inventory out and gives you the equivalent amount in points.
---
This really is not that hard, Bethesda.
---
It looks great on my PC on the highest settings. No idea what anyone else is complaining about.
---
Unfortunately, I think you're completely right, fo76 has taken a backseat focus at Bethesda since launch, I don't expect the game to change, I expect it to be the same piece of shit In a year from now but I'm okay with that. 
---
Unfortunately, adding to your other point, it's more than what game I play, I do as you said need another outlet but that's a story for another day. I just thought I'd share my most recent experience in hopes that it may bring someone with similar circumstances a different point of view.
---
isn't laser grid walls a enclave thing?
---
So you have killed her by yourself with no 15+ states  involving unyielding or broken bloodied build?
---
&gt;- Adrenaline perk not working
---
Don't use the perk so never deal with consequences. 
---
&gt;SBQ not able to get crippled
---
Easy to kill as long as people don't stagger her in air.
---
&gt;- fast travel not working
---
Fast travel always works for me.
---
&gt;- lag near meat piles
---
Never have this problem.  Even with the massive meat piles from events like Line In the Sand or Radiation Rumble 
---
&gt; colossal problem wasn't released when they said it would be
---
That isn't a bug with the update.  That is Bethesda listening to the players scream for a year to delay content if it isn't ready and Bethesda listening to players. 
---
&gt;- deep pocketed mods for SS not available even though the update says they were
---
Chest shows up but not limbs.
---
And the option to emote directly to team mates only!
---
ü•≥
---
OMG, if somebody actually emptied my plans vendor it would be the greatest day of my FO76 life.
---
Yesterday I crafted a SS chest piece that was unyielding ap refresh and I took a poop. Both were awesome!!!!!
---
There was a lot of content teased during last summers presentation, including multiple vault raids, perk load outs and Wastelanders. Only one of those have materialized in earnest.
---
Everyone needs to take all this with a grain of salt and a wait and see approach. Because so far this game has sailed very troubled waters. Half of this will be bugged on release/create new bugs and the other half will be pushed back and still have bugs.
---
It was mentioned a while ago in a inside the vaults. Its going to be a part of part two of the events being overhauled.
---
Yes, mine kept pulling my bow out
---
Good point
---
Yes every single time. It seems for me to only do that with heavy weapons. I carry a fixer a 10 mm pistol and an ultracite gatling Lazer. It will switch just fine between the fixer and pistol but the ugl no dice.
---
Didn't watch the quake con stuff and don't care to.    I'm at the point where I take  everything that Bethesda says  with a grain of salt so there is really no point.
---
.Bethesda, if you have new content, then let's see it. Otherwise shut up. The less you say, the better, because we have reached a point where nobody believes  anything you say anymore.
---
I‚Äôve thought about using it but don‚Äôt want to risk getting one-shotted while in photomode. I put my weapon away, go into third person and zoom my view out as far as possible. It‚Äôs not a perfect tactic, but it helps a little.
---
Happened on a server I was on about 3 nights ago. It landed *just east* of the fence marking the "you can't go further that way" line in the far SE corner of the world. Frustrating.
---
Would be so much better if we could have arena battles there with creatures, our friends, and or pvp.
---
Yep, my textures is a mix of original Fallout games and Fo3 graphics overhaul mod. It‚Äôs like some areas of the map are for ‚Äúretro‚Äù gaming and others want to keep everything with a little touch of nostalgia. To put it simply, yeah, a lot of problems with texture loadings.
---
I price mine at 10% Base Value, and I don‚Äôt have any taxidermy plans in there. I try to stick with just good plans, as well.
---
When I played an hour or so ago, I tried switching weapons and it went to fists. I had to manually equip from the pipboy.
---
do you suffer from a lack of things to turn into scrip?
---
A lot of people just playing on consoles, there‚Äôs a big difference.
---
Very cool! Thank you!
---
Yeah well no wonder it looks ugly to them
---
Because they're also implementing the Legendary Perk system, which likely is all tied together. But yes, in the meantime, that mod is a must-have for PC players.
---
Myself included
---
Just ran across this myself
---
Not so much a weapon but I would love to be able to dual wield handguns.
---
Spooky, I hate to disappoint but I'm not here to satisfy your demands.
---
What kind of sadist tells people to use Reddit's search function?
---
type reddit into google then ask your question if you want reddit answers
---
It IS great looking on PC
---
The game got nerfed about a year ago in terms of difficulty, and this sounds like more of the same.
---
Inadvertantly wandering into the wrong zone and getting smacked down by a Deathclaw is part of the Fallout experience.
---
it's only started happening since last update. Hopefully they fix it quick cos i want all my loots
---
Yes, we did
---
I want one of those arrow things listed under challenges and the season run. Makes it feel like we're really working together for it! But this info is super helpful.
---
They also need to address the fact that I‚Äôve somehow got an Owlet permanently wedged in my floor, and I can‚Äôt remove it without deconstructing my entire house.
---
And I believe you
---
I literally have plans at 10 each. Stims at 10. Ammo of all Kinds at 1. All food is 2 each. They are as low as I can go with still being able to make a profit
---
Screenshot or it didn't happen
---
&gt;s it really good gameplay design to not let players use those rewards in a meaningful way instead of having to deal with constant limitations?
---
Drop them on the ground or give them to other players.  That is practically use for them. I'd argue to allow us to scrap them but idiots would scrap ones they didn't want and would blame Bethesda. 
---
I genuinely do not understand this hording mentality.    Without giving a shit I will regularly hit 900+ script. I will buy nine 3 star range weapons, script those I can and then drop the rest or sell them to an NPC and move on.
---
Ghoulish! It's a 9 in Endurance I think.
---
I did and it bugs me all the more
---
üíÄ
---
Thanks for keeping us in the loop on your armor. And poop schedule, an often overlooked detail.
---
You can buy them for 5-12K. They sell fast.
---
Maybe he use to live on Arrakis, old habits are hard to break.
---
Hope life is going well for you brother. You have the complete right attitude! I can really resonate with that, I grew up being a supportive figure and after I lost that I found myself not knowing what to do, helping strangers has certainly been an eye opener and made me realise it's not only just helping those I care about that makes me smile, it's just helping.
---
Agreed I don‚Äôt get their obsession with it, it was a let down when it was new. I expected so much more coming from 3
---
Too much work
---
I mean that by I take the stuff that‚Äôs worth more like for instance I found 50 cap legendarys at a vendor that I know can go for a few hundred. Like a 3 Star is worth a lot. The most expensive normal things I have are usually less than 10 caps
---
You may be okay with throwing away your time, and effort; however, I am not. Even after all the time I have spent playing I have very little to show for it. It's frustrating that I can't get a decent legendary seemingly ever to drop for me. RNGesus has been particularly spiteful to all of my characters.
---
You will be missing those moments, when game have somewhat challenge, at high lvl it becomes too easy.
---
Yup. It's even got categories/channels, with Global, Europe, Local, and I think Clan. I usually stay in Global and turn EU and Clan off (extremely rare that someone talks on Local).
---
The kids who spam NE1 GOT EVNETS LIKE P.P RAD RUM SQB OR ENCRIPTD??? every five minutes have started to go away so that's a good thing.
---
Wut

I might be able to get you some. It'll cost 2 eyebots and your left leg though.
---
Edit: Todd says it'll cost the 2 eyebots, your left leg, a fixer plan and TSE Gatling Plasma and he'll give you a provision that has chance to drop a skin that makes you look like paladin Danses cousin.
---
Thank you!!
---
Where's the secret room?? üòÆ
---
I mean, I linked directly to it. It's a pretty commonly linked guide here, imo. Their guide shows where everything is without a path in mind. It's a lot more in depth than what I did. Here's the original post in case you hadn't seen it.

havent tried the fusion cores one, can anyone confirm it works?

I get ya. I wish it produced more than firt. But, I LOVE it anyway.

The chickens actually have feathers and are super cute, and make cute noises, and they even lay eggs (that we can't have....).

Could it be more? Yes. But that coop is my favorite thing in the run so far.
---
Well regardless of what settings you got the games mesh count and textures and lighting and animations are low tier

The Sun Gun from Fallout 2 would really complete solar builds.

At least we could have sex in fallout (except sheepsquatch)

Bulk scrap in a tinkers workbench and then scrap it, it will count for the challenge

Thank you brother, you too! As my great grandfather used to say 'Tiocfaidh √°r l√°' (the context was definitely different then however...)
---
i'm confident bethesda dev labs look more like a mad scientist's lair than an actual dev studio.
---
so much of this game is just haphazardly bolted together i'd think even elsa lanchester's corpse is recoiling in terror from it.
---
I have killed her with and without bloodied build. Also, there is even solo kill videos from people using no legendary items. And bloodied is not broken.
---
There is no enclave until after the chosen one destroys the oil rig. Which is decades away.
---
Yeah, it's hard to loot anything when your FPS is so fucked up.
---
It‚Äôs an older reference, but it checks out.
---
yeah no thanks lol.  i'd never be able to use a gun that burns through that much ammo, that often.  would seem like too much of a waste of my efforts.
---
Infinitely better since I had the realization, it's nice to hear someone else had it too, if only we could all want to help. I hope your road to common smiles isn't quite as long as mine was!
---
People buy waters ?
---
They dont need to make it a plan. If you cant manage to hit rank 5 on Score you probably dont play this game enough anyway.
---
I wish I could get a bf in Fo76 lol
---
I always thought the fighting arena would be an awesome PvP arena, or say a horde event that is round based and the quality of your rewards depended on how long you can stay alive/how many rounds you complete
---
No you sell it to vendors
---
Yeah it was cool for the first day then it got old and annoying
---
I have like 8 large purifiers and use the purified water to dilute chems and sell those.

Had some guy level 212 yesterday or day before try to get me to fight with him for the workshop I had taken. I‚Äôm level 250+ so I wasn‚Äôt worried but he tried and tried. Followed outside of the workshop area (I walk outside that bubble as soon as I am done as I don‚Äôt PvP). Then he started the tour workshop is being taken over thing and I still wouldn‚Äôt bite...like dude what do you need a written note saying take it if you want it lol. Eventually he left and didn‚Äôt even take it and it sat there till I signed out. Was really funny watching him try and me just stand there and give him the ok and ??? Emote
---
It does feel like the updates after Wastelanders are what started goofing things up a little bit.
---
There are way to many toxic assholes for that to be viable.
---
I have like eight large purifiers that are unlocked and free for all. Plus I use it to dilute down all my chems for sale. I seem to need two. How do you not need more can one??
---
Do you even purify bro?
---
I also play a lot.  It's not too bad.
---
Yes, I just sold all my purified water in my vendor. Not always fast seller but there‚Äôs people who will need it.
---
Depending on what it is. Some items have no
---
value and are just a stash box hog
---
What's the point? Why give 250 concrete? WIIFM?
---
Bloddie can be if combined with unyeilding. You can reach 30+ in stats which makes damage insane. Also I will have to check out what you say on solo killing her as I think it might be possible with a good build and utems but without legendarys or glitches or spam I don't believe it.
---
It‚Äôs a great XP farming spot
---
Only on console

they changed the quest in the patch. its now only says you need the ghoul. but they never tested teh analyze stage that still requires all three.

and let me guess those weapons and armor will be have to be purchased by some currency that is limited daily and cant be traded
---
My suggestion: Go to the Fire Breathers now, just south of there at Charleston Fire Department. Try every time you join a game to complete ‚ÄúOunce of Preservation‚Äù. Do the original story now, come back to Overseer‚Äôs stuff later.
---
Don't use explosive weapons close quarters. The rest is easy.

I was happy to find out that she used to be a Blood Eagle at the least, I feel like we should be allowed to have any of the faction peeps as companions that just sit inside interiors un-utilized, minus Meg and Paige of course. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The presents which were duped to hell and back.

#1 &amp; #3 could be problematic if the player chooses not to renew their FO1st. #2 would have to have a fail-safe that put the items back into the original character‚Äôs inventory if the membership expired.

Enclave existed before the Great War happened they were the shadow organization of the American government and they were called the enclave even then
---
wait have there been fo1st discounts in the past?
---
Why exclude sheepy?
---
I‚Äôm gonna say yes, but I think the collective minds of the wasteland hope to papa Todd that they fix the server stability issues unlike last years ‚Äúproblems‚Äù
---
You definitely can use these but pick up a dense chest mod and maybe a couple of points of fireproof
---
Serendipity didn't proc sneak..... What does this mean?
---
As the other person commented, Ghoulish, 9 Endurance. So long as you have no rad resist, the constant +5 Rads of the storm will heal you (mostly) for more damage than you take. 
---
This enables what is know as **The Nuke Run** AKA ‚Äúholy fuck that guy has two fucking nukes run!‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs very fun. 
---
Surprisingly, to my knowledge damage resist has little to no effect in the storm *but* stimpacks can be used within it without them canceling. So you need one stim to get there, one to get back.
---
That's the only one who had it in the game :)
---
Yes!  Another currency!  Sweet!
---
I used to have the uncle Sam greeting but it disappeared one day
---
Before I could put down a resource collector, and then build a nice shack around it because I could put the flooring down beside it and then literally place flooring that covered the bottom half of the collector, but it looked nice and it was safe from mobs generally. Now i cant place the flooring so it goes through the collector anymore. It also allowed me to build like treehouse type structures between spots. A lot of that ability is gone now. Just sucks.
---
Just learn how to play defensively or 1 shot them before they kill you. I sometimes play in T65 PA and can tank 4 ghouls slapping me which helps on the dying part
---
I feel bad for them. Such a tiny cage :(
---
Got another smoke kid?
---
Yes.
---
Wait I thought the brotherhood needed the cork to make there power armor cosplay and bullets
---
I hope papa Todd does us well haha
---
The perk serendipity gives a chance to dodge damage.  "Proc" means for it to work, it didn't work in example, so then he started sneaking.
---
I honestly don't see how any of this is relevant though? Like the concern is marketing. The year 2 roadmap, which is what initially said when all of this content is coming, came out in May. In about mid-March Bethesda described how nearly all of their employees were working from home. A full month seems like enough time to be able to gauge - okay, our productivity is at this level and we can release this by this date.
---
Even regardless of that, they released the roadmap. Like if BGS needs to delay some stuff on it that is fine, but then say that. I am merely saying it is odd they really didn't say much of anything despite that fact that their most up to date public statements are a shit load of stuff is right around the corner.
---
Yes I have mentioned COVID complications in my videos. Nothing wrong with content coming out later due to a global pandemic and I have cut them quite a bit of slack, especially earlier on, with responses and updates due to the COVID outbreak
---
It‚Äôs just a bed and a rug
---
From the tricentennial bundle? I heard they ditched that or something awhile back IIRC
---
I would not advise expecting Starfield until 2021, and likely the fall of 2021 at best.
---
Having 30+ stats does not increase your ranged damage. Only melee.

Doesn't work on fusion core plant sorry to ruin your plans for fallout domination

I feel like this is sarcastic but your welcome

---
Don‚Äôt worry next is to take over crater then foundation and finally the enclave bunker! Then take all the sweet gold of vault 79. But my plans have been ruined!
---
I've just been in the habit of looting anything and everything since I started playing. It's something I've done in every Fallout game I've played, even 1 and 2, as I could just sell it all for caps.
---
I know it's very likely not going to happen, but the boyfriend and I would love it if one of the weapons was the shoulder mounted machine gun like from new vegas.
---
Mini vault?
---
Good guide. I'll definitely make use of it. I bought 1 month of 1st on the first of the month, and I want to load up that scrap box as much as I can in that time.
---
That's great to hear, never stop dreaming of a better life. I fear it took me longer than it should have, I was always 'nice' per say but it was always for selfish reasons. Don't get me wrong this isn't some 'oh my God I done bad,I learn error of my ways' it's more of I'm becoming comfortable around people again and realising not everyone is so 'dodgy' I suppose it still started off  as a selfish reason but it quickly evolved into so much more than that, seeing the delight and just general awe at some players really set me aback and made me think, we're all human and sometimes we all just need someone to come along and give us that push.
---
Ahh yes, they were all turned off. Thanks. "It just works"
---
Spunk Jet
---
Was actually thinking of this when converting my ammo today. Heck could even do it the same way as legendary weapon scrapper to save time making a new UI. And also agree terminal should only be used to buy ammo.
---
Thanks! Load 'er up!
---
The only sad thing is that you know what to do and where to push, but some, may just fall instead of diving in
---
Me too, I loved using that. We weren't supposed to have it for free so they took it away. I'm not from the US but it made me feel patriotic in-game. Like I was preserving whatever America was pre-war in some small way by saluting people like that.
---
I bank 5000 across all character slots regularly and do shopping sprees.
---
Probably not; Most of these things were renamed to regular ATX after being SCORE initially. We'll hopefully see the next season next PTS (which I hope we see next week)
---
With the wastelanders update they also did a ‚Äúgraphics and lighting‚Äù update, since then everything has been super shiny/glossy and the game is 3x the strain on systems.
---
Np! I actually wasn't aware of it either until recently tbch üòÖ  Such a good perk; it procs for anything you craft - even Boiled Water, Chems, Flux, and Fusion Cores!
---
Serendipity and ricochet lvl 3 (luck)
---
Blocker lvl 3 (my opinion)
---
Quite the opposite, there's almost no demand for them. Nothing sucks more than seeing a camp with 800 plans, saying to yourself "I know it's going to be mounted heads, but I have to check anyway" and then finding out that it is, indeed, 800 fucking mounted heads. I leave people like that a nice steaming pile of raw fertilizer.
---
Completely agree. All the work has been done, why not make a daily quest or team event?
---
Multiple fusion generators usually means they have 10+ industrial water collectors(BTW fast way to earn caps). or in my case used to, and don't want to lose the resources if I have to recreate in the future.
---
You travel to atlas if you wanna throw junk away. Meet week events should pop up on the map
---
That‚Äôs where double walls were clutch. It could cut down the vast open areas and  you could have a huge house and plenty of decorations.
---
Big bummer, just bought the game for a friend cause it's on sale, now we're going to have to wait to progress until this is fixed
---
I find the storage limit the most frustrating. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd have to pay for just a scrap box. Especially when it‚Äôs a large part of the game and scrapping the hell out of weapons and armour is the main way to learn how to mod them.
---
Not atom shop items
---
And as soon as they add any specialty effects to headgear, there will be an uproar. Because that‚Äôs the ‚Äòexcuse‚Äô they used to nerf the Free Radicals Masks.
---
You'll need at least 50 radiation resistance, ideally 80-100 otherwise you'll die by rads a lot. Poison will kill you from one hit, but with only 1 piece of poison resistance you'll take very little damage, 1-2 pieces with poison resistance is necessary. Try to get your armour and energy resistance to 300, you can have higher but once you hit 300 your reducing the damage you take significantly. Fireproof is a must. Combined with dense you'll almost never take explosive damage, though dense only amplifies fireproof, fireproof level 3 will reduce most explosive damage you take to 0, besides from an explosive laser. Serendipity is broken, best perk for bloodied.
---
For damage, nerd rage lvl 3, bloody mess lvl 3, tenderiser lvl 1, adrenaline lvl 1, strange in numbers, and radicool.
---
Since you'll have at least 20 agility you'll want sneak lvl 3, and escape artist and if you can one piece of harder to detect armour to get the max 90% sneak bonus. Remember, sneak is capped, agility is not, if you have 25 agility with 90% sneak bonus you basically have almost 50 agility towards sneak, and escape artist will work most of the time because it's based on your sneaking modifier, though if you break line of sight from all enemies it'll work nearly every time. And you can run without automatically being detected, though you'll want to sneak once you get close to your next target, because you don't get sneak modifiers while running.
---
Edit: oh and as someone mentioned, blocker level 3, it reduces melee damage by a huge amount. And I forgot ghoulish, any level.
---
Maybe they could place a hand car like they did in fallout 3 at the train tunnel in the middle of Harpers Ferry and Tanagra Town where the two train tracks meet. This could possibly go to the capital wasteland.
---
I get it. More stuff = more data = more server load. You pay for a large part of the server. But even though I mainly build camps I still care more about camp items and fun outfits.
---
Obviously you havent seen my 20 water purifiers and 100 work lamps shining a beacon into space to the Zetan mothership. 
---
Otherwise you would understand why I have 3 fusion generators
---
Huh?
---
I always thought that not being able to even get 1 lead from a cannonball but I get 1 lead from a tin can was kinda dumb fallout logic.
---
Ghoulish can't be all. I have been playing with a new character/build for that and I struggle getting past picking up cases.
---
 "No definitive plans for extra character slots, but they're exploring ways where players wouldn't even need a separate character (Perk loadouts, etc.) "
---
Too bad.  I like having the different CAMP locations and builds.  All five of mine basically have forever-homes now.  Would be willing to pay for additional slots (on the same account) and for the ability to rename existing ones.
---
But that requires chems, I stock pile water and always try to keep atleast 500 on me incase I dont have much time in a day. Any excess I have goes to low level players and friends who need calls
---
Funny thing is I bought all 3 of the blood samples from someone's vendor. Somehow they ended up losing their quest item tag and I recognized them as a prime candidate for my collection, and they can even be put in a display case. I wonder if they'd still work to complete the quest, not that I'd want to risk losing them though... Who knew blood samples would end up being a legacy item.
---
Thankfully this is for the Wastelanders quest line, so in the meantime you can at least do the main quest of the game.
---
Damn that and the windmill missed both because of work
---
Basically, the way a silencer(suppressor) works is by capturing escaping gasses and forcing them to release much more slowly. On most revolvers the cylinder holding the bullet doesn't seal tight with the barrel when they line up, so you lose gas early on, before the bullet even enters the barrel, making a silencer mostly useless.
---
There are a couple of revolvers specially made to push the cylinder and bullet forward to create a seal with the barrel, so that they can be silenced, but it's generally not worth the effort when you could just be using an automatic. Probably the most well known one is the [Nagant 1895](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagant_M1895).
---
Or you know just take the most duped plans, e.g. fixer, and give it out to everyone via a supper easy one time mission. That would be a better way to screw duppers
---
Are you honestly surprised?
---
I hope that Bethesda get on this and fix it asap. It's a trivial fix. It shouldn't take over a month for the next patch to release it but I fear that's exactly what is going to happen.
---
Why is the power armor glitch still a thing?
---
They will come back eventually I‚Äôm sure!
---
A broken Chinese stealth suit will make your game easier. Live in the shadows man.
---
It's certainly impolite to not share
---
This is back again?
---
Always thought the responders were a bit uptight
---
Pistols really just need the 5.56 and 12/14mm added back in as top tier weapons. Hell, we wouldn't even need a new ammo type for the 5.56.
---
No you can't. it breaks both questlines. you can't progress in either of them. It's SUPER gamebreaking. It breaks all the main quests.
---
The power generator windmill?
---
Even if you did all the work for it?
---
This is why I've described my experience with 76 as "Stockholm Syndrome" to everyone that asks my how I can possibly be playing the game.
---
Yes. It's still buggy but really fun despite that. I've been playing over 1400 hours so I'd say I easily got my money's worth (at full price).
---
That's strange. How does it break the main quest line if it didn't even exist when the game first came out?
---
And that YOUR problem....u r the complainer...that's ur job to properly complain and give details about ur complaint. .not my job to research ur complain...and u call me lazy
---
Don't know a fix but i'm curious what platform you're on.
---
I'm on PC and have been slowly progressing another character through the story to do the score level up challenges and completed that quest yesterday without issue (though i too did notice the wolf/mole rat and fuse changes)
---
Just wondering if it's a platform issue or something else is broken, which lets face it with this game can be a long list...
---
Depending on the house i build i may have two just to not see all those ugly wires.
---
The community meltdown would be awesome.
---
Having an interface you don't like doesn't make something broken.
---
It would be cool if they did an updated version of it.  I hate the tiny BOS suit booties on it.
---
Ah one problem I‚Äôve been having with lucky hole mine though is ever since wastelanders dropped Lucky Hole Mine doesn‚Äôt respawn every day for me, It‚Äôs always 2 or 3 days now, I don‚Äôt know why. (Good source of lead though, get over 1500 lead in one trip with a full set of excavators.)
---
Lol yah I always see those camps with the mounted heads plans.  Don‚Äôt even want them..
---
It's always worked?  Are people that fucking eager to shit on this game that  they don't even understand the basics of what they're bitching about?  People didn't like the console interface, the fucking thing has worked perfectly fine since it was released otherwise.
---
Am i missing something? Why trade expensive 5.56, when you can produce 180 . 50 per click, not counting super-duper. Its cheapest ammo to craft in bulk numbers
---
?
---
There‚Äôs really not that many extra cosmetics..
---
I am surprised. Because i know exactly whats wrong, they changed the quest objective, but didnt bother to edit the quest requirements for the analyze stage, its a simple ass scripting bug. Literally a SINGLE PLAYTHROUGH OF THE QUEST would have caught this bug.
---
I defend Bethesda all the time, but this is horrible laziness. Whoever redid this quest literally deserves to be fired and i dont say that lightly. It would literally taken them less than 5 minutes to test this sort of thing.
---
It's SUCH a rookie mistake, and its utterly game breaking since its the gate keeper quest to basically the rest of the game. Amateur rookie modders know to play through their content first. This bug is so obvious so and so consistent and so gamebreaking. They deserve to be fired. Maybe im just angry right now but damn.
---
Never mind, I misread lol
---
I dilute chems too. If you farm ghouls you get tons of chems, mainly rad-x and rad away
---
There‚Äôs a flare smoke that comes out of it
---
Not always
---
I feel bad for the frog we have trapped in a jar in our camp lol
---
First day of winter is December 21, I wouldn‚Äôt of expected it in the first 10 days.
---
Ok, all good. I thought you meant to pull my leg there. ;-)
---
How dare you insult the ds1 pvp.
---
Then I would have nothing to sell at my vendor for 1 cap each.
---
surprice surprice
---
So far they've ticked one of the two boxes that could make the Shelters perfect in my opinion.  First is that you access them by just slapping a special door on any building, all they have to reveal now is that the interior is 100% customizable blank cell and not just some default interior.
---
Thanks! Yeah this sb was just floating back and forth.. nothing registered until I ads
---
Yup. I experimented today both using and not using teslas in the same events and for me, its the tesla thats causing this new frame rate drop - every time.  Having hundreds of meat piles was not a problem for me before patch 21.
---
That voice box not being voiced by Michael Dorn was a missed opportunity to have him back on another game!
---
I've done a lot of testing on this and I think it might actually be ash piles or goo piles combined with meat piles.  from what I understand this patch fixed an exploit people were using to get multiple legendaries out of ash piles somehow by using them as a container.  somehow now if there's too many ash piles combined with meat piles it seems like frame rate drops to a crawl.  What's weird is when I updated video drivers and did a fresh install of the game the problem went away.  I wish I had done those interventions one at a time so I could tell which one actually worked.  I'm suspecting the fresh install of the game was the actual fix.  Usually when the patches mess up something that's the first thing I try.  Regardless I'm getting really tired of patches fixing a very mild or non problem while creating a major problem.  If you are on PC try a fresh install of the game preferably on a solid state drive and make sure all of your drivers including DirectX are up-to-date.  If you are on console I think you're just going to have to wait until Bethesda realizes their fix screwed something up dot-dot-dot again
---
I'm on PS4.
---
You have 3 minutes before the nuke even lands lol. I've killed over a thousand Queens, I can one shot her but I get her to half life after regen and leave her to everyone else while I stand there tanking so everyone else can get rewards. It only takes a minute or two longer but I have launched one nuke in the last year and no one would launch for me if I instakilled Queen.
---
aesthetic
---
he didnt restock for me sadly
---
Not seeing any kind of Flare smoke anywhere. What the heck,
---
Or flag everyone who turns in amounts that seem ungodly.
---
I never got gud
---
Will do. Thank you!
---
This is such great news! This is what I was hoping for yesterday haha.
---
Best case scenario, after finishing the legendary run atoms get put back into the daily and weekly challenges. 
---
But since making good decisions like that isn‚Äôt in Bethesda‚Äôs set of skills... Another idea I had was any score points earned after reaching level 100 get banked and you get use them next season. That would be super helpful and make me dread the next season a little less.
---
Black Flame. That's all you need.
---
That's unfortunate. Thought maybe they acknowledged their initial marketing campaign
---
You have to take everything they say with a grain of salt. I think that is pretty clear at this point.
---
I read it as he reset on his previous timer (10:00am Sundays for me) and then again on the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Monday timer

Every plan I have is 0 caps (recipes), 1 cap or 5 caps (jetpacks, power armor plans, etc).  I can't keep it stocked.
---
Use the ffr version
---
Touch√©
---
Thanks for the vote of confidence! Not taking orders or selling at this point, but if you dm me a place to ship I'll send one! Just let me know if you want super soft body, fuzzy, both, etc. I need to pick up some grey for my step sister and I'm thinking of copying the eyes so I can cast them in the right violet for Wise or gitd green for a glowing mothman also
---
Dude, we still today get lovely things like obviously broken UV maps (see the Legendary Run Blood Eagle suppressor) and things that literally get their delay announced in the notes of the patch itself when it was stated coming with it mere days earlier (Colossal Problem). Not to mention the sheer wait just for perk loadouts.
---
Heavy sniper rifle not based from the hunting rifle.
---
Radikool, nerd rage, the nighttime sniper boosting one are three that I would recommend you put some points into. 
---
I would also recommend you try dropping sneak, with four pieces unyielding armour and low health the diminishing returns from 3 points in sneak aren't worth it -1 maybe, but three will probably not make much difference.
---
But there is no reason to not run with all mutations. Get them, run with a team, use stranger in numbers, class freak and starched genes.
---
For some reason whenever i logged in, the game tried using FUSION FUCKING CORES as ammo for ANY weapon i had out when logging in. I fixed this by dropping all my FUSION FUCKING CORES and picking them back up.
---
Keep your team out of my power pants!
---
That was me today, the low level player doing NW just to get the 10 minutes in, got on a team of nice guys, levels in the hundreds, they on team chat, me doing emotes because I didn't have the mic plugged in. We all got one shot by hackers at the end. Good times.
---
Nice doggo
---
I have my eye on journey to the savage planet: currently ¬£15 on the PlayStation store.
---
Not identical but sounds worth it
---
Yeah the first part is true cuz when I did it that was impossible now I‚Äôm thinking why was it so hard? Luckily my first attempt at it I got 3 star sentinels but sold it for 2k
---
'BigDickXD2005' - I understand exactly what you're talking about.
---
And the ultimate is when said player does his tea bagging on the way out.
---
I wonder why did Bethesda even decide to add pvp in the core game to begin with. Sure, making separate game modes like nuclear winter specifically for pvp can be fun but it has no reason to exist in adventure mode other than making it a griefer‚Äôs heaven
---
Aside from the reasons you mentioned, I don‚Äôt think pvp makes any sense lore-wise. We are vault dwellers that lived together for years, why do we suddenly attack each other?
---
And second of all, and I think this is the biggest turn off for pvp no matter how much effort Bethesda is going to put into balancing it and promoting it, is the terrible performance of the game. The game is already too clunky in pve with freezes and frame drops every damn second, I even have trouble fighting ghouls because of this. So why should or would I engage in a fight with a real player where my reaction speed and aiming capabilities matter a lot of the game itself is going to hold me back from performing my best? I just don‚Äôt understand why should I go through the trouble and deal with the issues for pvp, if I wanted an online shooter experience there‚Äôs plenty of games that do it better than 76
---
cus you cant complete the main quest quest to get vaccinated that continues the main quest? how would you progress if you dont beat this quest? the main quest is this quest. so much is dependent on this quest.
---
Mod support, please. This game needs so much fixing.
---
hey i found a fix for me, I dropped and picked back up all my fusion cores and gatling lasers.
---
We're on PC. Definitely will have to tinker with this.
---
The BoS ain't rewarding you with shit.  It's just some crazy dude donating his plans, booze and explosives to you for your useless steel because he's a BoS fanboi.
---
Everything goes down in 3 seconds or less (except SBQ and encryptid), extremely fun build, don‚Äôt get detected or you could easily die. Nerd rage and serendipity are a must, swap serendipity for dodgy if you use power armor.
---
I replied to a couple of the threads on this and shared my research which is pointing to ash piles being the problem.  unsubstantiated rumors have it that there was an exploit involving ash piles where you could get multiple legendaries from one.  This patch changed something and now it seems like events where there's multiple piles especially ash have framerate issues.  What I can't tell is what role meet piles and goo piles play in this situation as I originally thought it was meat piles that were causing the issue.  the more I played with things the more I found the issue was by far the worst during events where ash piles were prevalent.  I attempted to troubleshoot the issue by doing a fresh install of the game on a solid state drive I also updated my graphics driver and DirectX at the same time (poor troubleshooting form I know).  Following these changes the issue has completely gone away for me.  You can test this theory by getting close to an ash pile and then trying to spin your character around and seeing if frame rate drops even with one ash pile.  I found I could not replicate the problems with meat piles but a single ash pile gave me a few FPS drop.  Obviously bigger events slowed things to a crawl like is being reported.  Regardless the issue is based on a change made it to one of the loot piles, and appears to have been a fix to a minor problem that caused a major problem.  
---
If you are on PC I strongly suggest a fresh install on a solid state drive followed by a clean install of graphics drivers and an update of DirectX.  If you are on console I am not familiar with what your options are and I do not have any suggestions.
---
Shoot early, shoot often, put your fluxes in your stash.
---
What makes it magic?
---
It would be cool if there was a unique weapon for each cryptid. Poisonous Snallygaster Tooth Dagger, Grafton Sludge Launcher, Flatwoods Alien Rifle, Mothman Sonic Cannon, Wendigo Claw Hand, etc. (Sheepsquatch already has a few things, daggers and a staff I think)
---
Not stupid. Just not fun for me. I've gone full melee before (my heavy gunner started as a melee and got really, really terrifyingly OP before I stopped), but just don't enjoy the gameplay. Same goes for my wife and friend, for the most part (friend enjoys, but only when they're already OP). I figure others might feel the same, but as mentioned, ammo is rough at low level. So I provide.
---
One of the reasons they switched to seasons was because they were giving away too many free atoms to begin with,  they're not going to finish the season by throwing even more atoms at people.
---
Just because the season is over for you does not mean you deserve more free shit.  You unlocked everything that you were intended to unlock, you just did it sooner than expected.  
---
No one forced you to turn the game into an "awful grind" instead of just slowly unlocking everything over the remainder of the season, that was on you.
---
Very interesting thought. For #1&amp;3 how about if players simply couldn't add anything new until the correct weight limit was reached again? And for #2 a similar concept except instead of weight limit correction players simply couldn't add anything more but could still withdraw? 
---
I like your thinking.
---
Come on man, quit being lazy. Just earn some atoms if you want the mask so bad. 
---
You'll get a sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
That would require not being AFK.
---
In actuality, chicken poop truly is an amazing fertiliser. In the game, fucking useless.... In real life, I'd kill to have chicken poopy üêî üí© spawning regularly....
---
Too bad. Did he restock for you the previous week(s)? If he is still bugged for some players, when the patch notes sounded so optimistic, I'm officially out of words.
---
&gt;Wow, this has really affected you, hasn't nazi?
---
Not really. I'm not the one following you around. And you know damned well I'm not the bigot here.
---
Yeah im on pc
---
Yeah I wanted to fight Nuclear Dan.
---
Remove the mirror entirely and then place it again.  If you place the mirror normally and then try to move it it will always sink into the wall for whatever reason.  You have to store it and then place it again.
---
And they sell them for like 400 caps each, it's ridiculous
---
#WORKSHOP-PERMANENCE
---
You're welcome. Here's hoping that it's the same restock date for everyone.
---
Its annoying to see so many bases there. Ruins the golf course for me
---
As a player who bought the coat when it was available, I would also like to see it become available again so other people can get it. It‚Äôs a pretty sweet coat.
---
(And no, I don‚Äôt care if it makes you people feel special for having a coat nobody else can get... I hate that kinda ‚ÄúLimited item‚Äù BS.)
---
He did on sunday at 2pm CET, then after the patch he had the gold again. So i guess he will restoc for me on monday, i hope lmao.
---
I thought getting vaccinated was part of Wastelanders. The main quest of the game leads up to the Enclave bunker and dropping nukes. Wastelanders ends with the raid on Vault 79. I just don't remember them being related to each other, especially since the bunker and nukes were in the game before Wastelanders was even added.
---
That‚Äôs weird, maybe it‚Äôs behind a tree or it‚Äôs bugged. It sucks that it doesn‚Äôt get marked with a quest marker like the nuclear keycard cargobot does
---
But if I may ask, why do you need it anyways? Unless you‚Äôre a pretty new player, the supplies you get from the government supply drop is not worth it at all
---
This is such a hazzle, after tried it out once i removed it and keep dumping my ammo i dont use at stratigic places where mostly low lvl players Will pass by. I need my finger in good condition when it is time again to clear out my stash!!
---
The more i read about this game in this sub, the more tedious looks. Sounds like a job lol
---
Dont you know? There is a bug in F76 that makes that guns that fire +100 RPM or shotguns (on vats only) and they do CRAZY damage. 
---
In order to get a gun to do this it has to have one of the following legendary effects:
---
1* Instigating, Junkies, Stalkers
---
2* +33%vats, 50%limb, bashing damage
---
3* (armor) reduce damage while blocking 15%
---
Angry turtle has a video on the matter that is very useful but I'll try to explain it. The enemy is detecting far to many hits on the same spot in very little time. This causes the damage calculations to get fucked up and the enemies die. We are expecting a fix on this any time now since it is kind of broken, but until then have fun doing this.
---
Click on them in the atom shop.  Once it has a check mark, it should show up.
---
Thank your for this, it's extremely uplifting however it also showcases that many other are suffering, I hope that they can all get the treatment they need, unfortunately the world is a very cruel and subjective place. I just hope that those in need manage to find their own path, as difficult it may seem, it's possible to overcome almost anything with enough determination.
---
Jesus Christ it's a fucking wall decoration clipping, not exactly the kind of bug that requires a dissertation on how much Bethesda sucks.  Report it to somewhere that matters instead of crying to reddit and it's something that should be easy enough to fix.
---
Fucking drama queens...
---
Perfect Map for a modified nuclear winter.
---
I carry a second backpack (fridge) for raw flux. Since I don't use vats, I have only three points in luck. Class freak (1) and starched genes. Start at full health when I fight packs of ghouls. Then as I receive damage the more I give out. Now if going up against a mirelurke Queen or super behemoth. I get my rads high, (radi cool) and do a running power attack. (1-3) hits.  It has become too easy, I use my other characters more. Gunslinger, heavy weapon, and a ghoul build.
---
yeah im not like great at these games haha.  ima proud filthy casual but i dont know where things like gum spawns or certain creatures etc, so ill look those up )sitting around, notf playing tho) and then try to grind out the gold dailies w/ all their boring fast travel but alrady spent too much time looking for legendaries and by then im alrayd too sloppy drunk and just want pizzza roolls!!!!!   but sreiously this game is great and a huge pain int he ass! both are true lol
---
did u know there is a recipie for perproni rools in the agme?  its probaly that treasure of apalchia that evryrone keeps talking about!

Yep, future tech broke my camp. Had to rebuild my entire main building from scratch because of a floating object error. I wish I had read this thread first, but, you know... I assumed it was safe.

Man I wish if Bethesda directly sells the scrapbox in the atom shop without the need to subscribe to 1st. I don‚Äôt care how much they decide to sell it for, if it means I‚Äôm going to have it permanently without the need of renewing a membership then I‚Äôll still buy it regardless of the cost

If this was a thing I'd have a couple thousand legendaries.

* Range of around 300 with little discernible ballistic drop.

* Only wieldable in PA!
---
* Benefits from heavy weapon and explosive perks.

I swear there have been times when the crate just never appeared. Flat, open area and no matter how long I searched I couldn't find any smoke at all.

If you're not going to use it or sell it, get rid of it. If you have too many of common materials, bulk them at a tinkerer's bench and sell them. Save the rare mats. If you have too many food/drink items, get rid of them. That stuff is everywhere.

People would still spend a lot of ammo on SBQ and the upcoming vault event, plus spent on just a basic event.   
---
This idea of ammo tokens would not replace the crafting/finding, just to help with inventory management since sometimes we get this HEAVY ammo, and you have to drop it every single time.
---
I don‚Äôt use heavies. Does the Gauss Minigun charge before firing?
---
It's because of that interesting storyline that it's abandoned in the first place and will likely never become any sort of hub, it's why there are dumpsters full of skeletons in the back from the last people that tried.

Even IF you tried to rationalize that "all" it would take is clearing out the many military grade robots protecting the place there's the slight issue of the questionably stable AI in  the basement that might not like that idea.
---
Usul?
---
I keep basically only top tier weapons and armor.  I‚Äôve currently got five armor pieces in my stash and 3 weapons. If you don‚Äôt have fallout first, you should make sure that you aren‚Äôt hoarding too much junk. I‚Äôm constantly in a struggle to use or sell all of my chems, make sure you aren‚Äôt boarding too many chems you simply can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt use. Unless you are going to religiously use booze, don‚Äôt keep it. Don‚Äôt make gunpowder until you are going to use it to make ammo. If you have too many plans in your stash, don‚Äôt be afraid to just throw them away... sometimes it just happens.
---
I have 4 characters all constantly around 30k caps. I will frequently go to low level player vendors and buy out their stock to help them with caps. I will then scrap everything and give them the scrap back.

Its fun and helpful.

Actually they should‚Äôve expanded it to where you could bet on matches too! Think of the possibilities! Fisto vs Mole miner Supervisor...Who wouldn‚Äôt pay to see that?

Marksmen Carbine from New Vegas, preferably as a skin for the handmade. (Basically an AR15.)

Or the .45 Auto Pistol. (Colt 1911.)
---
Having the Deliverer being added as a weapon like the fixer would be awesome too.

(Get the plans to craft non legendary Deliverers with a base effect, having the plan unlocked also adds deliverers to the legendary weapon loot pool.)

Yes mate. Im with you. Just from here get your dailies and weeklies done and you'll finish.

The vault suit will reset when you exit the vault and the grainy face is a design option that you can change, also what platform do you play on
---
Well that or even just another type of vendor
---
No, some of these need to be in the base game. If they add a shared box only for fo1sters it‚Äôs just gone all bullshit and it‚Äôs turning into a pay to win fortnite battle pass mobile time gated clone
---
At Comic-con in Niagara Falls last year, Meredith, Creed and Oscar were doing autographs.
---
I'm not willing to fork over that much for an autograph....
---
But I made eye contact with Creed as he was getting ready and he gave me a head nod back as if to say "That's a guy who sprouts mung beans in his desk"....
---
Hands down, smallest interaction ever, but still my favourite of all time.
---
Here's my thought on it, having just purchased it two weeks ago:
---
Its a very fun game id you like fallout. Im having a blast just running and exploring with my wife, very worth the purchase. Some quests are ok but the game isn't nearly as lively as previous titles.
---
Overral, its nothing special but its multiplayer fallout. Very fun with a friend.
---
Personally i think &lt;lv30, &gt;lv120 and fresh level 50s are the worst of the community. Always the people contesting, following me around waiting for me to have low health and post scrapping
---
TSE Handmade "Pain Train"

AAE Prime Gatling Plasma "Queen-X"

---
to be fair thwey did release a statement re: the the doublewall thing
---
Idk I‚Äôm 120 ish and there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd waste my time ganking someone .... unless they claimed the lead factory..... then you‚Äôre ass is mine tbh
---
Healing factor mutation is a must for me. Combine with sneak perk and you are auto healing as soon as you start to crouch / get out of sight.  won't have to worry about farming meds nearly as often
---
Well, it‚Äôs garbage anyway, and I‚Äôm done with it.
---
Wow. Only three weapons? So when you get a badass three-star, but it's not really for your build, you sell it in camp, or to Legendary Exchange?
---
you have to get vaccinated to get the firebreathers to lead to the top of the world to lead to ect.  ect. 
---
it's an OG questline quest, its just the gate keeper early game quest for both questlines. Thus being super gamebreaking.
---
I keep only one backup gun (main a Fixer, stash a HM) and two backup Responder outfits (so paranoid I'll scrap it that I bought two when I saw the being vendor'd). My ammo. Some repairs kits off the Queen and my meds. I sit at about 250lbs stash.
---
Sadly I have 1st. So scraps not an issue. But neither is my capacity.
---
Careful you don't cut yourself on all that edge.
---
Why the lead factory? I get 150 lead just by doing a quick scavenger run through 4 locations
---
I keep about 10 guns total (including what I carry on me)
---
Think of your character and stash as one pool of inventory somewhat. For example perks that get your aid and food down 90 percent mean you want to keep all that on your person.
---
When it comes to junk I keep 50-100 of everything at all times and when my stash is getting full I bulk everything down to that amount and sell it at the station
---
My DCG is the proctologist
---
I absolutely know where youre coming from, but from a different perspective. I walked in on my friend in a situation like that. After a very long night jumping from hospital ward to ward, and a week long stay, she made it through the first phase of her battle. The whole event shook me up greatly, more than id like to admit, and i suffer my own issues after it.
---
But finding a place in this community, running events, helping new peeps, and just bs-ing around the wastes, I feel happy and comfortable again. I forget about my worries, fears, and flashbacks. I focus on the game, and having a good time with the people that love Fallout as much as I do. 
---
Yea the game has problems (im looking at you assassins lead pipe from SBQ), but its the community that makes it. Thank you to them, and you, for being what makes this game awesome. Keep exploring the wasteland of Appalachia, I know i will be.
---
I mean basically if it‚Äôs not bloodied or junkies... or like a magic weapon.... it‚Äôs not very good. Like weapons can be cool, to think about or whatever ... but like ultimately if I got a two shot rifle it‚Äôs gonna be worse than my bloodied or junkies so...üò≠üò≠
---
Only thing I put into mine is missiles, otherwise i only dump ammo if i am that stingy on stach space
---
Thanks a million. Glad I haven‚Äôt been entirely wasting my time.
---
Yeah but I don‚Äôt wanna have to do lead runs. It‚Äôs a lot easier to just use the ammo factory or lead factory and gain a free fast travel point.
---
Hell, have a raider there give you a bounty to go out and capture critters with a syringe gun to bring back alive.
---
I don‚Äôt know what your problem is but it has never worked for me. I have multiple friends who play on Xbox with me and it has never worked for any of them. So when I see something saying it is going to be used more i am asking about it.
---
The biggest choice you had in Fo4 was painting the Diamond City wall Yellow.
---
And still no text chat right? :/
---
We utilized the chicken manure in our compost from our back yard chickens
---
Your absolutely right. Im calling it now, when the BOS update drops, the game is going to be very unstable. All these fanbois need to lower their expectations considerably or they are going to be very dissapointed.
---
I'm pretty confident that was an unmentioned feature in patch 21 to prevent players from being able to access a previous "God mode" exploit.
---
Nope
---
Has anyone had to move one of there camps that had double walls and the double walls stay? I want to move my camp but really don‚Äôt want to lose my double walls.
---
What platform?
---
Yeah.....
---
But easily the most fun, interesting, and compelling part of the community. 
---
I'd say my top 10 76 experiences ever almost exclusively revolve around meeting random amazing role players, or tagging along with them. 
---
Some of my favourites:
---
A group of three people role playing well equipped tourists visiting post apocalyptic WV. There was a love triangle going on.... My presence caused further tension in that love triangle as one guy proclaimed his undying love for me as he rushed to revive me......
---
Or the time I came upon two guys standing in the road between their two camps.... They were arguing about where their property lines ended. One was getting miffed about a tree his neighbour refused to trim that was blocking his view.... Then they had a fist fight. 
---
Or the guy dressed as a Firebreather.... Who was running around with a flame thrower, then making fire engine siren noises and calling for hoses and pump numbers and such. After we killed a gaggle of ghouls he ran up to me and said "Good thing you got here quick Jackson (not my name) that blaze could have gotten out of hand fast" then ran off making siren noises. 
---
I've ran into people role playing more seriously, which has been great and all, but the crazier wastelanders always stand out.
---
I‚Äôm in the completely opposite boat, I loath NW so much that I‚Äôm so goddamn happy to be back in adventure mode after I finish the daily NW challenge.
---
(I‚Äôve had 5 offensive matches so far since I started playing it aggressively rather than bush camping a few days ago where I get marine armor, purple weapons, tons of stimpacks, and then I die to some BS or get one shot my an explosive. All 5 situations I had the better weapons and armor and still lost... The game mode is horribly unbalanced. After about a half hour in NW and I start hating the game mode and everyone who plays it.)
---
I am so glad that the only mounted thing I have usually is beaver, and I list it for 69 caps because I‚Äôm twelve years old.
---
"They want to phase out enemy level spikes"
---
So no more getting clapped by a level 60 charred feral ghoul? Hallelujah!
---
Tuesday.
---
Just did it on xbox, worked. Thought it odd, played when it came out on the ps4 when you had to get all of them.
---
My  problem is you and your friends are full of shit.  
---
The ammo converter has ALWAYS worked.  It's working was NEVER an issue to begin with, people just didn't like HOW it worked because it used a clunky but otherwise perfectly functional interface.
---
Can't wait
---
I agree with you. its funny because most of the people in this thread making comments like yours are getting downvoted and I dont understand why. What your saying is objectively true and based on prior updates with this game. All these fanbois are going to be very upset when this content drops and turns this game into a bug infested mess even worse than it is now. Not to mention half the shit is going to be broken in some way or another.
---
I can‚Äôt wait to try these buggy, hacked together features as they are slowly released and never fixed over the next 4 years.
---
It should drop one in that area. You may have to wait a few minutes for delivery.
---
glad i finally decided to make a new character a couple weeks ago for the foundation achievement. would be so ticked if i couldn't progress because of this broken quest.
---
HAWT
---
I don't get that at all. My current main is like 134.... I get low levels at my workshops alot lately for the complete events challenges.... 
---
Seems slimy to kill them. I just let them run the event, I'll help if they get in trouble. 
---
They need the loot and experience more than me.
---
I'm just going to try and make it to 80 and buy the rest
---
PvP died the day they took slap damage away from PvP. Now the PvP elements are sort of ghosts of its former self an hopes. Some PvP communities exist but it's far from the core game.
---
And to add to this, they often seem to let the community down in practice, this latest patch being a prime example (many fixes simply don‚Äôt exist and a main quest required for both Wastelanders and the OG story was broken, let alone the camp debacle of 2020). They can say they plan x, y, and z. End result will be g, p, and q. It‚Äôs good to have hope and a bit of optimism, it is not good to rely on these feelings as experience says things often change
---
Awesome, ill have to keep an eye out, thanks for the help. Gotta get cap farming
---
Disappointment 2.0.
---
Just the ammo to my knowledge
---
I can totally get behind that, because I am also 12 years old.
---
Sometimes I get mounted plans if I do the stings &amp; things daily, but I sell them for 1 cap. Newbies always seem to pick them up and there's never more than one in there at a time.
---
Yes. Well, if Bethesda doesn‚Äôt try and fix anything else. If nothing else you can spend atoms.
---
I mean I‚Äôve got 6200 ish atoms so I could but I‚Äôm a hoarder
---
I can't even sell the few legit copies of mine for 0, 2, or 5 caps.
---
I've taken to dropping them off to newbies coming out of the vault to get rid of them.
---
Who the hell is buying them for the 500+ caps they're asking for them?
---
Bro I am the edge
---
Yep. Can't do this optional thing and it's bothering me honestly. I don't want to miss out on anything.
---
Try and find a good Tesla rifle.quad is really good for pvp..slot of those guys get ready before they attack.nuka quantum psycho etc.you can combat it but will lose 75 percent of the time
---
Are there any other rewards? Or just the hat.
---
Did you look at the tinkers workbench. Thats where the grenades and land mines normally are made.
---
No one buys them, they just leave them in there so their camp has hundreds of plans listed which suckers people into visiting their vendors. 
---
Source: I am that sucker.
---
&gt;The biggest choice you had in Fo4 was painting the Diamond City wall Yellow.
---
Yeah except this objectively isn't true.
---
Platform?   If xb1 dm GT. I just hit 83
---
Why sadly? Is 1st not worth signing up to?
---
Do you have 1st?I have like 7k saved as well I dont find anything in the store I want aside random junk on sale.lol.would really like skins for guns but idk
---
Ding ding. This. I am also a bloodied, and while people are running around like chickens without heads because they are too good to hold pylons, or because they didn‚Äôt pay attention to the instructions and think they can shoot and damage her even with the cloak on, my bloodied butt is taking those three pylons alone.
---
And sometimes I don‚Äôt even get a hit on it because by time I hit that last pylon and find where the thing is, they‚Äôve killed it. üôÑ
---
LFG?
---
I‚Äôm on XBOX, live just outside Clarksburg and plans make up most of my sales inventory. I never know what to sell them for. So sometimes I‚Äôm probably giving away rare ones for 30 caps, and sometimes I‚Äôm trying to steal caps from newbies by trying to sell them Atomic Roller Balls that don‚Äôt yet do anything.
---
No I don‚Äôt have fo1st and haven‚Äôt bought any atoms. It‚Äôs pretty rare I find anything I like in the store. None of the cool power armor skins that don‚Äôt change the model are able to go on my t-65, and I don‚Äôt wanna change the model cause I love how the t-65 looks. Also I use heavy guns and there are never really any skins for heavy guns in the atom shop.
---
What I tend to do is tag her while she is cloaked, die and respawn then grab the pylons, that was I still get loot from it
---
Do you have a build list from like Nuke dragon or something?
---
X to Doubt
---
I've had too many people show up at my Defend events and attack me. I ain't trusting nobody.
---
It's only barely worth it. Other than scrap and arguably the tent, it's not great.
---
Yeah I use cow normally but chickens great too!!
---
Some advice: if you are keeping a weapon or piece of armor for sentimental reasons, strip it down to the bare configuration (that is, get rid of any weight-adding mods), and mod all your armor pieces with the ultra-light mod.
---
Hahaha i had a weird problem relating to those. One of them kept following me around but had nothing inside of it. All of a sudden one dropped from the sky near me and I searched it but there was nothing. I left and a few moments later it happened again, and again, and again
---
So do you sell legendaries from your camp vendor, or exchange them for script?
---
If you sell them, for how much? I see good legendaries for sale sometimes for like 6,7,8 thousand caps. I try and keep my prices low, like 7,8,9 **hundred** caps each, or lower. I have some three star legendaries for sale at 400-500 caps. But even still, they don't sell fast enough and I'm stuck with them in my vending machine taking up stash weight.
---
It can.
---
I am in Savage Divide along the river/creek heading away from Pleasant Valley. Something always spawns at my camp. Most times, it's Radstag. Sometimes it's just the blue frogs, chickens, possums, etc.
---
Occasionally, but not very often, it's Super Mutants or Scorched who come to fuck my shit up.
---
I stopped having turrets or defense because they'd just draw enemies in.
---
Everything will always come back, and when they do they are usually on sale.
---
There are better ways to make money than selling waters.
---
Me neither, its shallow and almost obligatory feeling, which is odd because most games that have PvP do it either as a separate mode/purely optional setting and not part of the normal experience, or fully dedicate to the PvP.
---
Just started working on a new character as well and hit this problem......
---
The reason I am making this character is because apparently my NW character is bugged and certain cards are not working or will not work with each other.  This game is just one bug right after another lol. How the hell do these people even have jobs???  
---
Every patch is just more broken shit on top of more broken shit.  NW on PC is just bugs and hackers almost every match and nothing is done about them. Just had two of my friends quit tonight over it. I have this feeling I'm about to be right behind them.
---
It takes 20 treasury notes to be able to convert to 200 gold bullion and smiley is supposed to reset on Monday's as well now to be able trade caps for gold bullion every monday after 8pm/est.
---
if your character was in the beta you didn't retroactively unlock the stuff they did at the start. if it's not from beta i'm not sure.
---
*laughs with pack rat 3*
---
Probably bugged to be honest xd
---
The only way to run an lmg is to prime it. Yes you need flux, but you get 172 rounds with ammosmith 2 (+96 more if super duper procs) for the mat cost of 24 regular rounds plus one fluorescent flux.
---
5mm is already cheap as shit to craft, especially with ammosmith and super duper.
---
I've just been bloodied for a year and a half.
---
Bethesda doesn't own the servers - they lease them from Amazon.
---
Sucks cause I'm trying to run a radiation damage build AKA hardmode. The gamma gun actually lends itself to bloodieds but only gets me so far and the radium rifle just sucks eggs even with VATS, so essentially I have to abandon my build and break out a backup weapon to even try and stand a chance. Really lame for a Fallout game to do that to you.
---
If it‚Äôs something that might actually sell like junkies or instigating or double shot I‚Äôll put it up for like 400-1000 depending on weapon type. Everything else I just scrip. Honestly I don‚Äôt know how to price bloodied, cuz it‚Äôs basically the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and I‚Äôve seen good bloodied one stars sell for over 10k, but I feel like most people who have 10k caps to spare have bloodied weapons already if they want them so.... it‚Äôs kinda weird. I‚Äôd say err on the side of selling things for less than they are worth, cuz it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs difficult to hit money cap. I just buy a serum plan and max boil lion every week and I make that up easily with casual play a few days a week.
---
I don't have any idea, but... Kids are assholes. Raider kids doubly so.
---
Oh you poor thing, all that sand in your vagina would make anyone cranky. Maybe go wash it out before you start lashing out at people.
---
Your English is fine. But I‚Äôve been trying any I do not believe there is a way to do that.
---
No luck here
---
Honestly I‚Äôm just paranoid I‚Äôm going to accidentally somehow run out of power.
---
Usually just wave and that seems to work, but I like to build in workshops and have had people wave setting me at ease and after I'm knee deep into fighting waves of ghouls they mow me down with a mini gun.
---
These guys are worse than the griefers. At least I know what they are there for. I hate liars.
---
I never use turrets because they take a disgusting amount of camp budget and I like to actually decorate my camp so it feels lived in instead of having turrets but barely any decor.
---
Well I've discovered my error, I actually was looking at a tinker bench (where grenades are made) all along, not a chemistry station like I thought. Turns out the HalluciGen grenades are indeed made at a chemistry station for some reason.
---
First, thanks :), second, o man that sucks :( i hope some glitcher who reads this find a way to do it. This is such a bummer.
---
It puts u at the next level with the same amount of xp
---
Pole hooks. Walking Cane. Anything Assassin's.
---
I've been getting rolling pins all night.
---
Ultracite gatling laser is better than the normal Gatling laser but ultracite laser rifle is weaker than a normal laser rifle. Considering normal laser rifles are already bad, I‚Äôd say no
---
Thanks for the tip but i have no treasury notes at all, not even in my inventory. Also its not that i've used the weekly limit on smiley before hes just not there.
---
Is there a glitch? I rarely use the jetpack in combat, and when I do it more to get away from it.
---
Gee, I wish there was a value assign to ammo or any item in the game that informs you of the relative worth that they can use. /s
---
How can you say you‚Äôve added the deep pockets for the secret service armor when they aren‚Äôt even there! Doesn‚Äôt anyone actually check? And seriously what a number you did on the already terrible ammo converter. Now it‚Äôs just a shitty guessing game if you have enough for the year you‚Äôve selected. But worst of all, once you get into it you can‚Äôt get out of the ammo screen! There‚Äôs no exit and I hit back about million times. Come on guys!!
---
I got a bloodied walking cane... big depress
---
Hopefully not delayed. Mischief night in late Nov to Dec wouldn't feel right lol
---
I see a lot of teddy bears doing weird thing when I'm loading
---
Unless you feel like making mules, you do *not* need four PA sets and multiple sets of backup armor. Also you're carrying way too many weapons. Try to keep it to 3-5, at most.
---
Have you finished wastelands?
---
Assassins is ass imo, ppl I know who pvp use tse's and quad tesla.
---
I've been doing my own testing on Xbox and I agree with you. It's definitely related to ash and goo piles. I've also noticed if you turn your pip boy light off the frame rate/lag/white dots settle out a little bit.
---
Interestingly I was on a private server and jumped to Sunny Top Ski Base and got a massive drop in frame rate yet it was only Super Mutants with lasers and I was using Melee.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
They consistently spawn in the little forrest near where the SBQ fights happen. If it's not up, came back like 15 min later.
---
Youre welcome. Hmm that is odd. I have not seen that. May be a visual bug, I am not 100% sure as I have never encountered that on my characters not being able to see the notes, just at times in pop boy not being able to see caps, badge counts, etc before until they did this recent patch. So, you do not see Smiley at all when you enter Wayward then go toward bar turn left go upstairs and he isnt in the side room for you, at least that you can see?
---
Ha, and here i am purposefully looking for one, and not getting anything xD
---
Gotta love RNG
---
I'm with ya on the whole PVP part, I use pacifist when I play so I don't initiate any type of combat (mutations set it off sometimes from a smack) and if I claim a workshop in public server, I leave as soon as it's done claiming and do my event elsewhere. I play for the Fallout aspect, not the PVP part. If I want to get attacked by griefers or tryhards, or attack people, I'll go play GTA or Red Dead where I'm 99.9% gonna get killed üòÇ
---
That's also part of it. I wanted to build some ridiculous stuff (that I've since pared down again) and turrets ate too much budget.
---
IMO, the loot pool is already way too diluted when you consider all the available weapons plus 13 (give or take) legendary effects, half of which are useless. They need to remove the useless legendary effects (like assassin), tweak others to be more viable, and either remove or buff the bullshit filler weapons like the lead pipe, sickle, etc.
---
Also, give us legendary chainsaws, bring back legendary rippers, and while they're at it bring back the bug that caused V fast melee weapons to do more damage if they were over-repaired. Shredding hordes of ghouls with a bloody handy blade was some of the most fun I've ever had in this game.
---
If you really want to add something, I want a gauss version of the FIDO.
---
50 is the camp budget, if you got 55.....your....lucky?
---
This! I struggle using words to describe how I feel but this is a great example, thank you for taking care of those who need your help the most, it's all well and good to be there for someone but it's another thing entirely when things reach too far, thank you for sticking with those  need help and I think an extra thank you is in order for sticking around, I feel many people fail to understand mental illness (however that may be anecdotal) it's those that put themselves through the insufferable actions of people like myself that truly make the biggest difference to those in need, even without knowing it, it's people like you that define the person i'd like to become and I can't be anything but grateful for that.
---
Damn, I'd of given it to you if on Xbox, I sent it back to hell through the scrip machine.
---
Everything eats too much budget tbqh. I love building but it feels like I have a noose around my neck whenever I start a new build lol.
---
Depends on who your asking
---
Huh, as someone who hasn't played this has my attention.
---
No smiley isnt there
---
Yeah my rifle build hates my brotherhood rifle for some reason. It would rather me be unarmed than switch to it. I haven't found a fix that works
---
The xp requirement for each level also increases slightly!
---
Um... no. Im gonna feel real stupid if thats the reason because I thought of that and looked it up and couldnt find anything
---
Awesome, that's what I hoped it would be.
---
Thanks for this summary appreciated :) 
---
Dumb question what are Ops?
---
I definitely agree with that üëç
---
i tried and went to a random and attacked and it regenerated. then i picked a lock and had a bounty attacked a wall and it regenerated as well i‚Äôm level 75
---
Ah yes thanks for adding on I forgot that part
---
So, you're saying you really liked my comment!?! :)
---
 Also;"Hai, Kazuma desu".
---
Here's a fun game I like to play.  We guess who deletes your post first, you or the mod I just submitted a report to for breaking Rule 4.
---
Take all the perks mentioned here. Get at least one or two armor pieces with poison resistance. Most importantly, get in the habit of stashing your junk at every opportunity, because you will die a lot until you get everything dialed in and get a feel for running at such low health.
---
Also, don't feel compelled to run at 19% HP all the time. I typically run at just under 30%, which is still enough to stealth kill anything in 1 or 2 shots, but you don't have to worry about a random overpowered gutsy catching you off guard.
---
I think they mean waterwheel, we have a windmill type generator already
---
Absolutely. I'm not big on PVP so it's extra useless for me. I'd rather a Tesla or TSE. It really sucks when I get something Assassin's that has decent other options on it.
---
I also got two Bloodied Fixers in a row at Murrmurr-gherd's, but they weren't the magic Bloodied Fixers. But they weren't Assassin's Fixers, so... Win some, lose some I guess.
---
Even the Queen is glossy af. So weird
---
No worries, i'm on PC anyway.
---
And I bet they would'nt be as fucking annoying as the collectrons. ERROR!! EVERYONE APPEARS TO HAVE DIED!!! THIS. IS. TERRIBLE!!! REBOOTING!! CHEERLEVELS DROPPING TO CATASTROPHIC LEVELS!! SHAKE YOUR BELLY LIKE A BOWL OF JELLY.
---
You do need to finish the main wastelanders questline..  I don't want to go into specifics because I don't want to give any spoilers, but finishing that storyline will give you access to getting Treasury notes and gold. Until then you are locked out.
---
why should tenderizer be at one?
---
why have one when you can have two for twice the price?
---
If you enjoy explore kill loot build gameplay in F4, you will love F76
---
Yeah you gotta Finnish that first for him to show up
---
Your welcome!
---
"When I shoot at people they shoot back and i die" Dude I almost died myself from laughter! This was funny
---
Absolutely! I pared down my buildings so I could decorate more. I have all these cool items and wallpapers... And you can use a fraction of them at any given time.
---
Imagine if they gave nuclear keycards üòç
---
Those set pieces were fucking awesome.
---
I was also wondering this same thing. I just hit 77 today. I'm probably going to just buy the last 10 levels with the atoms earned and then move on to other games.
---
I just like to make a nice open home with decor around that makes it feel like I actually live there rather than just stop by to scrap and repair etc.
---
You should probably learn the difference between my using harsh language and your going straight for a sexist personal attack and then doubling down on it.  I gave you a fair enough warning, the mods always catch up in the end though.
---
Dual wielding pistols and shields please.
---
Pipe pistol
---
Unfortunately, neither of those seem to be the case. I have long since left the vault, changed my armor, and changed my weapons. Still everything on me remains silver and shiny. In regards to the grainy face, I went into the character editor and completely reset my character. He looked normal when I finished in the editor, but as soon as I exited the grainy face was back.
---
It's rare enough that you can trade it for pretty much any of the legacies that were duped to hell during the last wave, or any rare outfit, or a shit load of flux.
---
I traded one for a croc backpack plan, the treasure hunter plans, and the insurgent plans 5:1
---
oh, i‚Äôm not sure then in that case
---
No. Same shit rewards.
---
Looking for group
---
You're adorable when you're angry. Don't attack at people if you can't take it. You probably whine when people kill you after they find you lockpicking their camp.
---
Ofc it is a dev room item, what else did you expect from an item that has cut content on its name? xD
---
Ooohhhhh ok, yeah I don't know many abbreviations for this game or Reddit in general, my apologies üòÇ
---
Finally, someone with guts to help!
---
If anything it is a very good thing to show us that they are playing the game. this is a step in the right direction to get the ball rolling. They should make a monthly/quarterly gaming stream and record all the bugs they interact with. In the beginning of the stream they say the progress they have made on previously found bugs and what any holdups are for them and at the end they talk about new bugs found.
---
If you haven't......wait till you get a Troubleshooter's Knife.

It's a sign. Leave with your pride while you still can. XD
---
Baaaa
---
How about "the ammo converter is a badly designed piece of shit", then? And yes, it is objectively that. Made even worse with the "fixed" version because now you have to go check beforehand how much of each kind of unwanted ammo you have lurking in your inventory before you even use the machine, unless you enjoy rolling the dice and seeing the "transaction failed" screen a lot. Because there's no reason we should ever see a "transaction failed" screen, because that was something they actually did right with the first version and then broke with the revamp. Do you really want to sit there behind your screen and pedantically defend this ridiculous thing? "mmmm, just because you don't like it and most people don't like it and it was clearly designed by someone who has never actually played a video game, doesn't mean it's BROKEN"
---
Well, congratulations. This is technically true. I hope you feel like a champion for pointing that out, hero.
---
Same, it's my go-to outfit along with a Field Scribe Hat and Plague Doctor Mask. It was the only time I have bought anything after purchasing the main game. And while "pissed" might be an overstatement, I would feel more than a little betrayed.
---
Someone posted that it just moves you to the next level and given that amount of Score. I got 4 levels to boost myself. I'm close to getting my 2nd Park Card pack x2 which is beneficial to my other char who is 33.    
---
I doubt I'll spend more b/c the only other thing that's interesting to me is that awesome Raider gas mask at 92.
---
Go take a nap.
---
You'll get the achievement rewards AFTER the collection dates pass. That gives late arrivals a chance to donate regardless of whether or not the total has been reached, otherwise some people who only get a few days a week to play would be losing out on public rewards.
---
I mean I figured as much, just wanted to be sure as i'd never actually seen one before - that and being on PC it could be a "legit" as a legendary wedding ring is.
---
Ok so I found the solution to my problem, one Bethesda was obviously not aware of, so I share.
---
I bought a Razer Blade 15 (please don't judge) with a screen running at 300 Hz. And that's the problem. As soon as I set the refresh rate to 60 Hz, the game was displayed correctly.
---
14 Water Purifiers and 1 Resource Extractor lol
---
That only helps with armor and weapons I believe.
---
Welcome to the Hotel Appalachia 
---
Such a lovely place
---
In all seriousness, you can't go back once you do it.
---
Yeah. I made a few bases like that hoping my camp would kill the spawn. It did not.
---
Same Bethesda different cycle
---
Sometimes I wish I played on PC
---
Not often... But sometimes
---
How about a perk card that reduces the cost for ammo crafting?
---
Not surprised by this.  Far too many MMOs release content where the later rewards in their progression system are not released when the progression system goes live.  The devs think they still have time to add the missing rewards and then they reduce the amount of time they have to implement their missing rewards by adding double SCORE weekends and more daily challenges due to player feedback.
---
Thats exactly what jumped into my mind.
---
Ah, sucks. I'll have to find somewhere else for a new build. I don't use turrets, too much budget. And Daguerre is useless at defending the camp.
---
i might have count wrong, a lot of lights to quantify :P
---
The insurgent outfit and the treasure outfit I actually have a friend that sells them since he had the plan. The üêä backpack sounds tempting
---
I would say in the first instance it was probably assumed that the United States would have the epidemic far more under controlled this many months in that it does. Austin TX is in the state with one of the biggest epidemics. Several counties in TX haven't had ICU beds for weeks, which has led to huge upticks of death, that is no doubt affecting employees with direct family, friends, etc.
---
Efficiency and speed increase, likely at a compounding rate, the more time they spend at home, but this gets counterbalanced by things like mental health from isolation, loss of creative 'energy' lost over a zoom window, and the unpredicted extent of the loss of life couldn't be projected on March.
---
BGS released a roadmap giving quarterly updates you're talking about starting FALL (22 SEPT-21 DEC).
---
We just got beginning of Atlas content &amp; after you have asked over a long period of time for Bethesda to iterate on the material in a PTS, you are now complaining that dungeon from BGS Austin (who were the team in the stream the other day continuing working up to launch to ensure a+ work when up on live servers) isn't being released fast enough.
---
There is no real incentive to exploit in pts so weird stuff that players do live, like CAMP bug or duping, don't occur. Unknown unknowns, that break the code.
---
By patching the event in last Tuesday, engineers can see how merging the code base worked (as you reported the other day things broke, in instance areas like the mine for example). Well now, they can fix those problems, and start reasonably speculating what happens to those problems when the patch update activating 'Colossal Problem' launches.
---
You would have more of an idea of the way those processes work - the way that they interact and the way that they can massively influence development time - if you knew more about computer science. MVP (most viable product) thing means you could get some really lame Steel Dawn next month. Dot on September 22nd. Or you could get something in October, November, which could be better because some feature they really wanted to get working but couldn't get working in a month might be working for a later release data.
---
You also try to do a lot of building upon old things that BGS have said, which I would also suggest when Pete Hines says "You know nothing about Starfield" and Todd Howard says "I'd prefer to announce things when they're done" maybe the marketing style of the company circa 2018 is gone. 
---
Thanks for your time
---
The chainsaw and drill used to be AMAZING. But then they added the improved repair kits and took away the added damage from repairing weapons with Weapon Artisan (it would do like 35? damage I think) you could kill damn near everything instantaneously.
---
Damn.are you on console?I dont really get on much
---
There's a camp budget and a separate light budget as well as a turret budget other then using glitches which carry a risk of ban theres no way to place more if the limits are reached
---
Yeah I play on ps4. I‚Äôm only on to do my challenges. I‚Äôll probably do some of the events and the new content that comes out but I‚Äôll almost certainly not do much of the next season at all.
---
It‚Äôs actually sad how it went from top pick to bottom because of a nerf and then it was forgot about.
---
The Lord is tryna tell you something
---
Locked doors
---
I never take mine off for long. It's the battle coat and either the Enclave officer or the armored skull gas mask.
---
I've had a character made that I meticulously molded to look like Ash Williams years ago, then the chainsaw nerf happened and a shotgun build didn't feel right.
---
He is a gaming dream I will never realize.
---
My FO1 was attached to my Verizon bill and when I switched from Verizon to AT&amp;T it Microsoft wouldnt let me create a new payment option to keep my FO1 option open. I had to go onto the web page and request to talk to someone. I chose the live chat feature and spoke with someone for about 30 min back and forth and they decided there was a problem due to it being a subscription and they sent me to a specialist. They said the specialist would contact me back in 48-72 hours via email. A week went by and I contacted them again with my reference number and they had to send me to the "specialist" again. Later that day they just canceled my old subscription and let me create a new payment option and start it back up again. 
---
TLDR: talk to a live person with Microsoft and wait a week, they should fix it.
---
Who in their right mind would use armor made out of corks? Just use the materials straight from the tanks lying around.
---
At least I don't have to do his lousy quest anymore.  The recent patch just changed his bugged quest so I have to talk to him twice instead of just once to get his rewards without having to hunt down his target.  Ward should join up with a Raider group again since Rocksy never forces players to kill her target.
---
This is sad... I researched legendary perk cards and found one that makes light weight mini nukes every 40min. But still no buff to the fat man it‚Äôs self.
---
I saw someone in the comment section looking for a gf i think üòÅ
---
I did√†
---
Things that could be classified under ‚Äúyou need to buy
---
1. Collectron
---
2. Raider collectron
---
3. Any other collectron variant (not the recolored basic collectron)
---
Collectrons are nice
---
You can get to work in a car that's missing a wheel and has no brakes,  if you try hard enough, but that doesn't make the car NOT a janky, busted piece of crap and it doesn't make you NOT an unhelpful person to point out that yes, it technically can still serve the purpose for which it was designed so you can't call it "broken".
---
 I do understand this, that is against the rules, but itself bethesda show off camps on their streams   
---
which¬†evidently shows a budget camp glitch.  
---
What I am looking for is not a glitch to abuse mechanics of the game or have any advantage against PvE or PvP, it's just to create a piece of "art" it doesn't modify absolutely nothing around the world except the fact that people will be able to see something different.   
---
Thanks anyways for the answer.
---
Dude... How easy do you want the game to be? Enjoy the challenge! There will be a day when you will only die because you fell from a high altitude fooling around with a jetpack.
---
Seriously, enjoy the challenge. Great satisfaction will come from success.
---
I think theres more places with laser walls but there do seem to be alot of the laser grids in the enclave questlines
---
I have around 40 water purifiers, all unlocked. There for people to take water from and me to put into npc vendors should I need to finish out my daily caps.
---
Same reason why on my junkies build the first roll for my plasma caster was bloodied... which my bloodied had to roll 27 times to get.
---
RNFuckingG
---
I don't really have a horse in that race since I'm not a very creative Builder, but to be fair the statement they released did essentially amount to: oh sorry we didn't know you liked double sided walls. We'll consider possibly thinking about maybe finding a way to add that at some point in the distant future...
---
Lmao maybe I should do that
---
Yes, but they aren't very well advertised. You need to read the weekly atomic shop update &amp; for some reason they aren't in the fallout 1st section.
---
On a side note, I just got 80 atoms earlier for the 7600 items built in camps or workshops, I have no life üòå
---
Okay awesome. Thanks!
---
How will I know it's a secret room? üòÇ
---
I think I figured out the reason also: True love.
---
When you ally really loves you, she will follow you to hell and back!
---
I often feel I'm the only one who cares about PvE and PvP balance. Bloodied, Junkies + magic bug, explosive legacies, etc all dwarfing the power of pretty much anything else, or things like energy weapon damage being too low due to a broken energy resist calculation. I really hope they fix these combat balance bugs - I want to run around with a laser rifle as a main gun, and want rifleman and other builds to be better for PvP.
---
i donated 40k steel and I have enough booze to dont give a sh!t about fortyfying Atlas and rewards. The BoS will come anyway:) The only thing i am interested in is 50% off sale and only if I can pay 25 scrip for legendary modules.
---
My standard camp build pulls over 90 power. Resource extractor, lights, 4 venders, water purifiers, heavy laser turrets, even more lights, power garage door, depending on the build maybe a powered keypad door, ad the decon arch. I move around a lot, if I‚Äôm at a double resource location add another extractor and I‚Äôm over 100 and need that second generator.
---
What happened with it? Is that the cripple perk? My friend is a shotgun build and I'd like to let her know if it is indeed broken.
---
4 caps*
---
I just built my base over a lead extractor.  I actually finally have more then i can use.
---
Two patches ago they removed the ability for a team to get sucked into PVP due to one ne'erdo'ell. It made teams way better, and people less afraid to team up without possibility of being griefed anymore.
---
If you want PVP there's a whole separate mode for that
---
If you're on Xbox hit me up. I also play it on PC occasionally. I'll send ya the GT and we'll roll. Be warned though I got a 2 year old daughter that loves to randomly come up to me and roar like a dinosaur in my face. I love it. But... I've found others don't lol
---
Ammo factory.I have 10.
---
Needs power.
---
Just server hop
---
Lol
---
If you make your own
---
Finally got a good drop from here last night even if its not worth it for my current build.  I've only killed her like a dozen times now and im level 80.
---
You can laugh about your mistake, they talking about bos provisions reward for donation. They weight 1lb each
---
I also bought it during such a sale sometime ... last year maybe? I don't even remember when. Morbid curiosity tempted me too much, like, *how bad can it really be??* And while pretty much each and every bug is infuriating at the very least - it still manages to provide that exploration/scavenging experience quite well, so if you like that, you'll enjoy FO76. The multiplayer aspect can actually be rather minimal if that's the playstyle you prefer, I can count on one hand how many times I've actually interacted with others, and even that was just to get me over some very specific issues.
---
Is this a normal thing?   
---
I'm new to the game, first time this has happened.
---
Congrats.  You made me literally LOL.
---
Yeah, it just means that specific server is going down for maintenance.
---
Ive got some t45 and t51 plans ibsede those boxes
---
Oh!   
---
Cool :)   
---
wondering if the Xbox registered the button click to go to your ‚ÄúAid‚Äù tab in the Pip-Boy, or is the server lagging. It‚Äôs definitely gotten worse in the last update.
---
I have that too and I just don‚Äôt go back to my base very often tbh
---
XD I'm level 10 lol.
---
Yeah, no problem! Have fun.
---
And when you use it it automatically turns Pacifist on for 10 minutes.
---
Then the next easiest ways to reduce camp budget o know are 1) use prefab atom shop buildings and build inside them or 2) if not patched get the plan for circus trailer place 1 trailer add a door (the red circus trailer doos) store the door place a 2nd trailer add another door same as i just mentioned store that door then delete the 2nd trailer if done right deleting the 2nd trailer removes a huge budget ammount repeat untill desired budget is removed the catch to this is you have to build your camp in 1 single build session because the removed budget is readded on your next login and if you go over the "default budget" you cant place anything else untill you delete items to be under that budget this includes using your vendor machines display cases and fermentation bench and again option 2 is only if it hasn't been patched which i am not sure if it has or hasn't been hope this helps you some.
---
I remember this happing to me a couple times on roses quest line. No way I was taking down that shack of high level super mutants and didn't how else to progress. So I just messaged some random high level players for help and it only took a few minutes for someone to come help. That moment rite there is what got me hooked on 76.
---
I had to hold off a good 20+ levels when I got the Forging a Legend quest for the Mistress chain. I was only level 20 something and that building was always full of level 62 glowing ghouls. 
---
Needless to say, when I finally got around to going back at level 45, with my 3 star exploding handmade... I got my revenge!
---
I don't want to remove the level spikes personally, for the same reason. Nothing gets the blood pumping quite like meandering through a building clearing out weak level 22 scorched only to turn a corner and have a level 42 breathing down your neck! Run forest run!
---
Because 5% is a nice buff, it's easy to share so if you have 4 people fighting Queen she takes 20% more damage, and it only goes up 1% after lvl 1 which isn't worth a perk point.
---
Got some t45 t51 plans from them, but was like 13k steel, underwhelming
---
I thought I had enough but the decon shower would turn off my resource extractor or my water purifiers. Now that wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal because I turn the shower off when I‚Äôm done, but no one else in the wasteland knows how to flip that bloody switch back to the off position. Same thing with my garage door. I‚Äôm up in the Toxic Valley, leaving doors open is how you get super mutants.
---
a rollin pin?
---
Expedition ideas:
---
Shady Sands (Started in 2098)
---
Tribe Ridden New Vegas
---
New York
---
The Pitt
---
Capital Wasteland
---
Denver
---
Any National Park (Zion if you want to get really crazy)
---
Texas
---
New Orleans
---
Flagstaff (Mentioned in game and later Legion‚Äôs Capital)
---
Chicago (Enclave??)
---
Miami
---
Cuba
---
Northwest, either Portland or Seattle
---
There have been several fixes posted here in the last few days.
---
If you have FO1st try to analyze it before putting the fuse in
---
If not try putting the fuse in then hopping servers then analyzing (Bethesda‚Äôs fix idea)
---
It‚Äôs rumored to be caused because only the first person in a server can complete it..
---
Finally just search here and Bethesda‚Äôs forums for;  Ounce and read the other threads
---
But. I do suck at PVP. Also why I don't play NW and keep pacifist mode on lol
---
Why would you hoard the aid packages though. They've got crap rewards
---
You might want to go back and read the previous years teasers and then compare them with what we ended up getting.
---
These PR events are all about building as much hype as possible but very rarely does any of it come to fruition.
---
I‚Äôd be up for revisiting FO4. I played it so differently than how I play 76. I‚Äôd definitely miss dragging corpses though, especially at the steel mill furnace.
---
Thanks for sharing this interview that Bethesda should have featured. Bethesda NL!? Talk about burying the lead.  Can somebody check if Todd Howard dropped an interview with Bethesda Tuvalu please?
---
Just build your base at a acid extractor, go to lucky hole every once in a while with Excavator armor. You get xp for the smelting and way more lead than wasting time picking up a workshop. You also get xp and steel from luckyhole when killing everything in it.
---
They also join the protest in Grafton.
---
I have a Bloody/Explosive/25% VATs Combat Rifle that I got from Murmur months ago. I don‚Äôt play bloodied and I could never decide what I could possibly want to trade for that near-god roll, so it‚Äôs been sitting in my stash.
---
When I started rolling SS chest armor, I swear I‚Äôd get Unyielding about one in five tries. I have a 3* Unyielding SS (+1 End/improved Sneak) chest also sitting in my stash because, again, not Bloody.
---
I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm just going to start keeping whatever else Unyielding shit I roll or find, because clearly the whole damn FO universe just wants us all playing bloodied builds.
---
**GIVE. ME. THE PLASTIC.**
---
I'm on Xbox One, and I had no problems getting my 1rst yearly subscription. I hate it for you that you can't get it. The immediate rewards and weekly discounts are worth the investment. Do try and get the yearly instead of the monthly subscription. It's less expensive in the long run.
---
nerd rage, and adrenaline are your best friends stay with 25 health or something like that
---
Thought it was only me got two in the same drop cycle.
---
I don't really care for the token idea, but if they made it just like the vendors but with points, that would be fine with me. Just sell it the ammo you want and buy the ammo you need. They could even put a daily limit, i don't even care. 
---
But this interface is terrible and it's even more annoying now. I use .308 but not enough so i want to discard some but not all of it. I want to buy .45 and .556 but i don't always remember how much of each i need. It would be nice to see what I have, and it would be nice if it would access my stash too.
---
As for future seasons, they should just give it away at a low rank again, but reskinned. So if you're new, you still get the thing, but if you're not new, you can have some variation and a new reward.
---
Heh. Level 214 here and have not yet launch my nuke. 
---
Soon (tm)
---
It does help me to know that glitch, but it doesnt work with the lighting budget that i strugling with. Thanks a lot anyways.
---
I've got 2 fixers since up date all 1/star. Zealots and assassins.
---
My 13 water purifiers haha
---
I can be your gf lol
---
Just bought it and it's my first Fallout experience, I'm loving it so far. Exploration, resource management and camp building are all great. Some bugs here and there but nothing game breaking. For a solo experience I think it's great.
---
26... that‚Äôs the number of posts here in the last few days about this ...
---
Why not just go to the search bar and type in: ounce 
---
Far quicker than creating yet another post on the topic
---
I still wear it too
---
I want bigger versions of Unarmed weapons that can be used in PA. Having a viable PA melee build would be fun as hell.
---
Can you imagine her companion quest line?
---
Final reward is not just a unique legendary but a note with her real name on it.
---
Just got New Vegas on my pc cause it was 3 bucks and I thought itd be great to get back into that one again.
---
Sorry, I searched it on Google and basically found 0 direct answers. I just joined this reddit to ask this, basically. Also, I got the quest unstuck after hopping through various servers for some time.
---
In Skyrim it usually happened when you fast travelled muszƒô conversation.
---
I really hope we get a proper fallout game on Texas, but I‚Äôd settle for an expedition
---
Plot twist your FO76 character becomes the master
---
Google should bring up Bethesda‚Äôs suggested fix.. at least it did for me 
---
Anyway apologies I just got pissed off that this was the 4th post on the same topic I read in the past 15 minutes..if you search in the search bar you‚Äôll find several suggestions
---
Leaving fertilizer...love this!
---
I have so many of them just sitting in my bags,  I rarely go close enough to a tower to use them,  and even then,  most of the drops aren't worth the effort
---
Not really. I do a similar junk run in maybe an hour or two which sets me up with enough materials for repairs and ammo for a week of playing as a heavy gunner. Just did it this afternoon. It‚Äôs actually kind of relaxing.
---
no pvp changes?
---
Why is it exactly a big surprise if you couldn't do that either in 3/NV?
---
A bunch players will find where you spawn and just keep killing you when you spawn.
---
I got a legendary rolling pin a few weeks ago.
---
It should really be something like a mix of a horse race and a gladiator fight. One person fights another person, or some sort of enemy, and then you‚Äôll be able to bet caps on either side of the fight.
---
Yes but we literally go through a quest that implies all enclave have been wiped out. That‚Äôs why Whitesprings is empty of human life.
---
I wonder if they have a problem with people spectating, anyone with power armor could faze through a barrier. Even just as simple as letting us bet and not letting us spectate would be better than anything
---
Expect a Creation Club style shop for mods across all platforms.
---
And the same as why my first roll in the gauss mini gun was bloodied. I‚Äôm a full health no power armor heavy gunner. I have a good friend that would love my bloodied roll but can‚Äôt trade it. So now it sits on a heavy weapon stand in my camp to taunt him when he visits. I did finally get a nice 3* anti armor gauss mini gun that works for my build, though.
---
Yes but that‚Äôs just the Appalachian branch of the enclave they are based on a Poseidon energy oil rig in the Pacific Ocean and at mariposa ( sorry if the spelling is off it‚Äôs late for me lol) and Chicago at this time do another group could be sent from one of those places
---
My savior! (maybe it was you, if you're on PS4)
---
I've got a level 76 I played last year, during the heyday of Whitesprings getting nuked non stop that *never* saw a decent drop.
---
Everything my 'main' got was trash and I all but gave up trying to find something actually usable.
---
So when I rolled up my alt last month I wasn't even worried about legendaries. I scripped what I couldn't use and just moved on figuring I'd burn out long before seeing any of the vaunted god tier stuff.
---
Then it happened. I made a normal trip to the train station and hit my stash to grab all the stars I'd collected. Turned the corner to exchange them and was greeted with a vault tec duffle...
---
My jaw locked open when I saw it. My alt had just hit 46 and was primarily using an automatic handmade and here I was hovering over an unclaimed 3 star handmade!
---
Then I saw it. The 2nd star was Exploding damage!! I was stunned. 
---
I was now holding the most powerful weapon I'd encountered on 2 characters. A level 45 handmade with +30 damage to scorched, exploding bullets and 90% weight reduction!
---
It positively reinvigorated my alt, propelling him to level 55 in a single day! I went from being timid and having to be careful to just bounding all over the map as a brute and having a blast with my new toy! 
---
I'll never be able to properly thank my benefactor so yea, just know you're 'donations' are certainly appreciated.
---
If you have it- the fasnacht collecteron gives honey, honeycomb, and royal jelly.
---
Ps4, my bad edited my post to include the platform.
---
Yeah, massively wasted opportunity.
---
Plus they need to make it so most of your gear gets stashed for the duration, because I found I was just able to put on my power armour and haul out a big gun right in front of the guards in the locker room and that was it for any sense of immersion... But then Bethesda would probably break it so all your stuff was deleted
---
How Bethesda could fuck it up:
---
The door leads to nothingness - the character gets stuck between worlds and cannot move or log out. Any items assigned to vendors become free for any player to take. It also causes the Scourge queen to spawn and kill your allies. Finally, your computer explodes.
---
So I‚Äôm not going crazy when I can hear her talking in the middle of Scorched Earth.
---
huh TIL, thanks
---
For ammo needs invest in 2 perk cards ammo Smith which maxes at tier 2 under agility and super duper tier 3 under luck ammo smith tier 2 is 80% more ammo per batch and super duper tier 3 is i believe 30% chance on craft to double whatever you craft
---
Ok look. I know this lore bro. The Appalachian branch was wiped. And we are in Appalachia which means there are no enclave during fallout 76. 
---
The latest expedition is after 2242 when the enclave Oil rig is blown up, they move east to form what would be the Enclave in Fallout 3. The year is 2102 in Fallout 76.  
---
140 years after the current year of Fallout 76. 
---
The only way we‚Äôll see the enclave again is if they retcon the lore.
---
You are going to die alot more, get use to it.
---
I can't get either of those two as I can't complete missions and I haven't got any new ones
---
- 3 star pool cue from one of the only 3 star enemies I found
---
- 3 star pipe revolver
---
- nocturnal broadsider
---
What platform are you on pc ps4 xbox?
---
Why did they remove it from energy weapons?
---
It was coming last month June :/
---
It doesn't seem to happen if I start a conversation and then exit out and immediately fast travel, and it doesn't happen if I fast travel while she's going on about whatever. Basically I can't find a way to be in conversation when I fast travel.
---
It is possible that if you can initiate fast travel while there are enemies around so it starts doing it's 15 second countdown thing, and then you enter conversation, that this could trigger it, but I haven't been able to get those things to coincide at my CAMP. Even my camp is being attacked at the time, I seem to be able to fast travel away immediately.
---
This bug seems to happen after the ally says certain things, but I can't be sure. Maybe I'm missing some other variable.
---
But what will I do with it?
---
People have reported her being there several times.
---
Beautiful, for steel server hoping at Top of the world and taking the hanging tin cans at the first destroyed house down the hill from the main area, on the big watch post with the wall and flamethrowers and the building with the vendor and Belehop.
---
Buy something fancy
---
You can level up by doing more than just missions. Explore the regions that are suited for you level. You level more quickly from killing than questing
---
It may require the romance related dialogue options. It does seem to happen after she says something lovey-dovey, but only some of the comments.
---
If it was during the "I don't believe in fate" soliloquy, she would be fast traveling with me almost every time I went anywhere.
---
Darn. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Seemed like a no brainer addition that would actually make one handed weapons used a lot more and on power with big guns.
---
Ra-ra? You mean Walmart brand tiny Tina?
---
One is from the brotherhood questline
---
You get the ultracite power armor and the ultracite, it would just say power armor chassis in your inventory and you‚Äôd have to pop it out to see what it is. Im pretty sure t‚Äôs the BOS quests, if you go on on the computer at the top of fort defiance(the insane asylum) you can download all the plans and craft it yourself
---
All I want is for them to allow junk decorations in the shelter
---
I stated with Xbox gamepass and it hasn‚Äôt been hard at all really, I just stayed in the starter area around Morgantown/Flatwoods doing quests to level up until I was ready to move onto the toxic valley and take on super mutants etc.
---
Without more details its sounds like you might‚Äôve pushed into an area that‚Äôs too high level for you and your gear isn‚Äôt ready
---
The fact they are structuring BoS like Wastelanders is really off putting, I hate the fact you can be buddies with everyone. Factions should be a serious choice with greater rewards. Hell faction exclusive character perks, bonuses and exclusive gear should be a thing.
---
PC
---
Yeah because they scheduled at the end Of the year and 3 months into 2021 ( winter will begin on December until March 2021 )
---
Super Mutants like to hand around Slocums Joes and when Im walking by there, they attack me. I can't find ayn quests in Morganstown
---
The Combat Zone did what Fallout 4 did best. Take an interesting location and make it a shooting gallery.
---
My friend was on their level 28.  A level 218 decided to be a dick and force PVP via workshop.
---
My friend couldn‚Äôt get out of the area to avoid it and when they went back in to get their stuff,  which had not been looted,  the cockwaffle killed them again.
---
Congratulation you killed a character that had literally zero chance.  What a powerful individual you are.
---
Yeah, happened to me too before the patch.. I hope they're in the PS4 album somehow
---
Shame you're not on ps4 I'd offer my help hanging out but gl on your wastelanders adventures
---
Mort you will be rough at first but they will get better as you go along making your camp holo education tapes. I mean NW YouTube videos
---
overdrive is craftable, 
---
day tripper is just a search and hope (i think)
---
check the whitespring pharmacist bot
---
Add a Molotov cocktail in the bag too.
---
My idea was to have one of the vaults breached early by super mutants and you answer the distress call of a survivor who was turned into a ghoul.  You go in there and have to fight unique tough super mutants which ends up the boss being a level 150 5 star super mutant behemoth who is irradiated and super powered from the reactor (kind of like Godzilla).
---
Add me to that list bro, leaving the game doesn‚Äôt seem to help, this is kind of disappointing, like I new the game wasn‚Äôt great but even basic game mechanics are broken
---
Well,  it‚Äôs a video game so,  ‚Äúlive fast, die often‚Äù.
---
Yeah I know the lore also the enclave was around before the Great War they moved as many members to the oil rig right before and during the Great War at some point in fallout 2 the group on the oil rig go to mariposa after loosing the oil rig they move East to Chicago and the capital wasteland for the events of fallout 3 in fallout 76 the group that made up the enclave was high ranking member that were transferred or already in West Virginia as the bombs fell they were eventually killed off by in fighting and some by modus. Now what I am trying to say is that like the bos who didn‚Äôt have any contact with groups until 50+ years after the bombs fell in the first games lore had to be retconned to make since for them being in 76 so yes the enclave would have to have some retconning for it to make since the thing that makes the retconning ok by me is that they are putting this lore in at a point that both factions have a blank slate that would not conflict with established lore from fallout 1 on. I‚Äôm not trying to argue the lore it just seems like your saying none exist at all when they do just not in West Virginia at this time period but will come back at some point hopefully in later dlc
---
Nah mang, you ain't shit if you don't kill it in pvp and have a good camp. Git gud
---
I can confirm, my mate has been sat there for days, says he's sick of giving his steel, unfortunately it's the only patch that awards Todd Points so he may be here for a few days.
---
I got a 3 star walking cane. Anti armor and faster swing speed. With barbed mod it was doing as much damage as my gutter (unique vamp assaultron blade) so I've kept it
---
Lol you got downvoted for that.
---
Whitespring is an excellent source of plastic. Golf balls, golf clubs, life preservers, shopping baskets, pool balls and cues... People always mention the high schools but I can walk outta there with a good 250 if I bother with picking up balls on the green.
---
Your assuming it'll come with a door
---
I forgot about the existence of the golf balls
---
It happened for me with wanderer. Followed me to project paradise.
---
Not in romance with her though
---
I can't kill anything without ammo. And the melee wepaons always seem to stall giving enemies time to reduce my health
---
Idk why
---
He got a nice doggo on his profile pic, thats all
---
Usually per group of ghouls 1 is a junky that drops, but thats not consistent tbh better bet is server changing and looking at med player vendors.
---
I just miss the place anywhere mod
---
Idk about other consoles but VATs doesn't work on players except with a few select weapons, he was either using one of those or actually hitting you
---
I use a bear arm and a perfect storm and melt people without VATs
---
the only part of what you said that was hitting the nail on the head is the builds but you have that off too, PvP builds don't have strong back, thru hiker, or any weight reduction or QoL cards, it's all about focusing on damage and your weapon specialization.
---
Moral of the story, do some research on builds and think about your character and get good
---
You on Xbox? What's your Gt?
---
What level are you? For starters you should visit the Wayward pub to start doing a couple of quests, and also go down to Flatwoods to start the Responder quests. Loot all the buildings down there, the enemies can easily be beaten by a machete you can craft at the overseers camp across the road from the Wayward
---
Daytripper has set spawn in the Winding Palace employee only area. This junkie knows ;)
---
Can occasionally be bought from the Doc vendor at WS
---
That's weird there was an empty supply drop right by my camp when I got back and it wasnt far from where the search area was :/ I never found my supply drop
---
They‚Äôve acknowledged it which is good, it means they‚Äôre aware, and it‚Äôll take time to fix it. There‚Äôs lots of other quests you can do in the meantime while they work it out. Not every bug is a quick fix. 
---
Just keep trying it and keep an eye out for updates.
---
I missed the whole holiday gifts thing, so when I started playing again just before Wastelanders and saw these mounted plans that I didn‚Äôt know for sale I wanted them but not enough to pay 500 or more caps. Then one day someone dropped a bag in front of me it‚Äôs all these plans . So many copies of each one, at the time I didn‚Äôt know about/ understand the duping so I put them in my venders. I sell all my plans for 10% of value and I couldn‚Äôt give those things away. I eventually learned enough to realize that they were duped and finally just dropped them in a lake. I have a couple of mounted radstag head and antler plans for sale and that‚Äôs it, all my other plans are hopefully ones that someone wants. Now seeing how many of these plans are out there I don‚Äôt see how anyone is getting the crazy caps they‚Äôve got them listed for.
---
I have found that if I slow down the fast travel process...like take 2-3 seconds between button pushes, it seems to work much more efficiently.
---
Do you remember any dialogue you may have had previous to this happening?
---
I went to see him last night (Saturday 2200 BST) and was stocked up.
---
Joo (Yes in finnish)
---
Perhaps the power of the Axe deodorant is taking your breath away?
---
Ok, that was pretty bad. I'll show myself out...
---
*Duct tapes 4 heads together.*
---
What about the drill?
---
I've seen her there before and she was nekkid
---
The other mobs spawn inside the SBQ so you can get them on the platform with you so you do have to keep something of an eye out.
---
Sofia is a known gamer so i need 2 to power her 10900k and her sli 2080 ti's.
---
Wait for it to become a reclaim event.
---
That hides the map marker (they can't fast travel) as well as setting the event to 1 wave. This minimizes your vulnerability time.
---
I have a axe that the game seens to like to stall out for whatever reason. I'm level 11. Lvl 1 and 6 Scorched can kill me because none of the melee weapons work!
---
Fuck no I don't play with you hard hats. Pc
---
Check the fallout wiki, it states pretty clearly you have to finish wastelanders in order to unlock gold bullion and treasury notes.
---
I still check the wiki regularly myself, and I've been playing for a while. I've noticed a lot of things aren't explicitly explained in game so it helps to have an outside source.
---
I get what your saying. But compared to before wastelanders. You couldn't take a step without ceasing or lagging. And they really only did small things for the game that would last a day or two. All I'm saying is they are doing better than they were. They're still a bunch of uneducated morons that deserves 5 billion kicks to the nuts every time they do something stupid. So every day basically.
---
They will probably give it a destructible door you can place, then it gets broken and your character gets trapped in there forever.
---
Sadly no... the event at morgantown airport where you fight of waves of scorched maybe...
---
Because that was only meant for people that got the Tricentennial Edition of the game, and a bug allowed everyone to have it.
---
That explains why you're flapping your jowels cuz you'd get clubbed like a baby seal if you were on Xbox, bye orphan
---
Their argument is basically just "kids play this game and may see them and strip Clubs are immoral and disgusting but EVERYTHING else in the game is alright." Kids can see much worse on TV or outside depending where they live and just because they are against doesn't mean their being forced to go to one. It's just mind blowing to me.
---
Literally no one is gonna care when they release the next elder scrolls. Literally not one person. Fallout 76 is just a super casual time waster. It doesn‚Äôt need to be great. I‚Äôm sorry the game is crashing for you. That really sucks.
---
Hahaha
---
I posted a similar idea a while back
---
Funny you say that, because both my radium rifle and gamma gun worked like usual on him with VATS. Considering how wildly different those guns are besides doing radiation damage, I doubt I managed to use specifically two VATS friendly weapons on accident.
---
As for QoL cards, that isn't true. You can have QoL cards and PvP focused: it's called switching them out before you go to PvP because you will essentially never have an unexpected PvP encounter in these guys' positions, they go out of their way to find it. I myself do it all the time, switching to certain perks when I craft or need to carry a lot of something home.
---
Saying get good invalidates your points either way.
---
Nobody even said that. Try reading.
---
&gt;Am I the only person to play who hasn't encountered this bug
---
&gt;&gt;Nah
---
Mad cuz no hacked guns
---
If I want a workshop that‚Äôs outside the forest, level 5 or 5000, I will have a go at you and claim it in the most efficient manner possible, which includes keeping you out until I fully own the workshop. If you‚Äôre sub level 100 then I‚Äôll leave your junk alone, but if you‚Äôre above level 100 and you die with junk on you, then that‚Äôs entirely on you.
---
You can get same stuff in fallout 4 ü•±
---
Old news like your positive aids test
---
You said you played 120 hours since the update and haven‚Äôt encountered the bug..... so what the fuck is the point of that statement unless to say that because you haven‚Äôt had it it probably isn‚Äôt a big deal.
---
You can only kill them if they attempt to contest the workshop or if they shoot you first.
---
Haven't seen it personally, but imagine every1 bringing there companion to the queen fight
---
wheels on the bus go "oh fml, oh fml"
---
Idk just in case I need to power more stuff. I also used to be farming water with industrial purifiers and it‚Äôs a waste to scrap a generator
---
Depends on how you play, really isnt much choice in terms if variety.. pick a weapon then choose low health or full health
---
Obvious that some people wont encounter the bug over a long gaming period. DUH.
---
Well, Raiders gotta steal a living somehow...
---
It does suck, ive only played for maybe 6 or 7 hours today, which isn't usual for me but still and it crashed 5 times in that frame of playing, besides I took breaks getting off to eat and do other stuff I had to do. It'd be nice to understand why, is it the game? Has anyone else had mire crashes lately?
---
Enjoy dinky QE Tesla :^)
---
Happened to me but she was still happy enough to get me the gun during the vault raid, so I think it's just a dialogue hiccup.
---
Bloodied is the best for damage but if you‚Äôre not a fan of low health you can do a junkies build
---
E Tesla's are trash ü•±
---
First off, bruh momentum. Secondly, be glad I don‚Äôt know where to find you because I would gladly nuke your camp.
---
It‚Äôs probably ‚Äústalling‚Äù because your action points (AP) are running out, maybe because you‚Äôre sprinting a lot or carrying too much weight. I recommend switching to a lighter and faster weapon that‚Äôll use less AP, walking when you see an enemy, and making sure you‚Äôre not overencumbered (too much weight). If you‚Äôre overencumbered you need to go to a camp (yours or the overseers), go to the crafting table and ‚Äúscrap all‚Äù, including weapons you don‚Äôt use, and dumping the scrap in the stash box.
---
Pc seems to just be buggy. I play on ps4 and I rarely have much issue. Maybe other pc users can give you some tips about it.
---
launch nukes using "nuked flora map" kill queen (get stable flux from her/event) and loot plants for crimson. 
---
alternatively. server hop to find nuke zones, also loot and kill enemies for that lovely radioactive mass
---
Flatwoods church tower
---
Haha beam splitter 50cal go brrr
---
Im late but honestly i love the helmet, just hate the paint.
---
yes, please!
---
I understand where you're coming from, but I would personally enjoy a system that allows me to place a hatch and then prompts me to choose an interior layout. Or perhaps make it a modular system, starting with a 1 room generic bunker. Now \*that\* would be my ideal vision of this update.
---
I think it‚Äôs just public teams that don‚Äôt allow building on each other‚Äôs camps.
---
Is that a fusion core in your pockets?
---
Is the playerbase for ESO really that gigantic?... maybe im missing out, anybody play ESO? Worth trying?
---
How old your system and how much space do you have left this happened a lot to me for apex but I barely had space left so I bought a 2tb extended drive and it hasn‚Äôt crashed sense
---
ty! cx
---
Where is the employees only area?
---
High hp the trick is to sit as high as you can hp wise while I. Nerd rage high ho is king for bloodied
---
It's the funnies because it is the highest DPS in the game and the only build where you can actually die (the case is too easy otherwise).  
---
Any tip? Yes. Use de grocer backpack mod (you'll need reputation lvl and gold bullion for that) and always carry some toxic goo (West Tek) so you can adjust your rads on the go
---
No, it's "Big Grahm".
---
Not passively. Have a bunch of purifiers running non stop at your camp, collect the bounty every time you stop by and drop in stash until full. 
---
Within 30 minutes you have enough to sell for 500+ caps with very little effort or time away from other things.
---
Lifegiver has magic properties
---
I think overdrive is craft able and some people just buy the other drugs from a trading subreddit if they‚Äôre lazy to find them
---
I didnt really like ESO but thats just me. My friends dont play these kinds of games anymore because they have a lot of bugs and bad rep. Id say its worth trying if you dont buy it. If a friend has it or something id say try it, you might like it.
---
It might be that I don't have a lot of space, MW takes up a lot of space along with a couple other games. I might have to just get a external hard drive
---
I am on PS4 and will gladly team up!
---
I understand *how* to get it, but based off of how much ammo I use, I think I would use more ammo than I would make if I tried that.  Basic 2mm ec is very strong and the jump to ultracite is only a ~12% damage increase.
---
What would you do in the scenario where you have material to repair one out of two broken pieces. Knowing this game, it'd probably crash trying to figure out which one to repair.
---
No sorry. Only thing I remember is I fast travelled direct to a public event.
---
Also her chair is on a stage, she often teleports to it when she wants to play it, as their is no stairs.
---
Maybe not having access direct access to their furniture might contribute?
---
If you are familiar with Guided Meditation public event there, enter the main building from the side towards the back (past the Side Meditation area in the event). You will then see a door a little way on the left that has an Employee Only sign. Go in there an in the first couple of rooms on the left you will find it on low tables (one table has DRUGS spelled out with wooden blocks) or on the floor near those low tables. Green bottle of pills
---
Gamma does radiant damage so it is in fact one of the weapons and in PvP if you use VATs it "works" but the damage number you see don't actually affect the player
---
It is pretty buggy even besides that, load screens seem to take a while sometimes and the game gets kinda large after a nuke drops but I think thats normal. Loading my camp seems to take forever now though, or it spawns me like super far away from my camp when traveling to it for some reason
---
Yea I‚Äôve had the problem as well and I hated having to delete games to download a game then keep on going on a deleting cycle so I got that drive it was pretty cheap for 2tb I got mines from amazon
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I‚Äôve had it spawn me in strange places as well
---
Nah it's the wasteland not a safe space
---
Was wondering if i were the only one. So many places and terminal but only 2 min to roam? I don‚Äôt even try
---
"Finally someone with guts..." 
---
*unsheathes knife
---
Mine started doing that after patch 20, did a full reinstall and it hasn't crashed since.
---
Best NPC in any fallout game ever.
---
Honestly the ammo converter is pretty easy to use on PC, even the first iteration of it. Get your cursor to the top of the screen and use the arrows to navigate and spam the spacebar when you're selling the ammo. I can easily go through a few thousand of each round in a few minutes.
---
üñï
---
I‚Äôm really excited for the fallout shelters! It would be really cool to have your own shelter to make your own
---
&gt;Mod support is coming and being actively worked on, they're evaluating the structure of how it'll work compared to FO4 - "stay tuned."
---
Can we please get a mod to remove the need for food and water? And also a mod for increased spawn rates for ammo and weapons? **Please**
---
Still works with private teams.
---
&gt; Even then, that instance will likely require fallout 1st.
---
I couldn't imagine the outrage of charging money to first pay for mods and then force people to pay for Fallout 1st.
---
They haven't even launched PTS testing of patch 22 and consdering how disappointing were previous additions that got postponed after waves of negative feedback on PTS forums, I won't be so sure about Daily ops release with patch 22. Most likely it'll be yet another disaster/unbalanced and unrewarding bugged to the core grindfest and will be scheduled to a later date, maybe even next year.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be a dick and hate on the game. I played it since beta for 1900h+ and enjoyed the hell out of it overcoming all sorts of game-breaking bugs and stuff. But with all beth's recent major fuck-ups with dupe-fixing, season challenges' autocompletes, new content postponing, god-awful design of legendary perk system, total mess with the latest patch, old bugs returning each patch with a bunch of new ones and plethora of other issues that still persist from the earliest days (even from beta) it's kinda hard to keep a positive view on this game's future and to believe yet another promise from the devs.
---
"waaah put markers on everything I don't want to think when I'm playing a game!!"
---
Billings Homestead.
---
Outside the forrest?  Yes.  Useful for much?  Not terribly.
---
No this douche was purely being a PK'ing prick and using the junk bag as bait.
---
They need to bring back survival,  these asshats can go back there.
---
Need a Rolling Pin Mod that lets us slam Hot Slocum's Joe dounuts at our enemies for explosive and melee damage that hurts you and the enemy and sets both on fire.
---
Ultracite does 30% more to scorched. Ultracite 2mm is also quite a bit heavier than normal. Best way to keep it fed is buying flux but I don't think it's worth it.
---
The patch notes that were put out  ***on the day the patch dropped***\- THOSE notes said it was delayed a couple of weeks.  And that was the only time they said it. Up until then they were putting out misleading articles were they would talk about path 21  and, in the same article would talk about how Colossal problem was up and running on the test server. 
---
Everybody keeps saying "it was in the patch notes, you should have known"  and that's really not true.  Before the patch was released, there had been numerous articles put out  and they all contain misleading information.
---
yep
---
Do we get the hat and if so how do I craft it
---
shouts 3 star rad stag who phased out of reality
---
Sure whats your username!
---
Dude! I should have modeled it after Mort
---
‚ÄúHey this is Mort, and um, so you get these guns and stuff, then you kill people, it‚Äôs lots of fun.‚Äù
---
The game is already too easy as is. Putting a marker on dead bodies doesnt need to happen
---
PostOnYou 
---
If you don‚Äôt mind I‚Äôd rather not have to plug in a mic
---
Not sure, I think I do prefer the bare bones approach the mod took.
---
 Well, She seems to be pretty popular so maybe she‚Äôll return!
---
Thats fine i dont like using mine when i play
---
The executive suite totally doesn‚Äôt have two claim machines with some very interesting objects within.
---
i can‚Äôt believe i pay 50 cents a day for this but i do kind of enjoy it. it‚Äôs just lame as shit once you go scrap you can‚Äôt go back.
---
For sure, just join my world or invite me
---
The stuff they have would be shown AT quake con.
---
My ally followed me from my camp to vault 76, didn‚Äôt follow me to the collision course event I then went to though. However, the government supply air drop reward from that event DID follow me. The next 3 fast travels I did, the air drop crate spawned behind me, until I finally went back to my camp and it stayed there...
---
Searching for junk while listening to Uranium Fever is why I play everyday.
---
maybe it‚Äôs something with the VPN? completely remove it and then try. i‚Äôm just talking out my ass you don‚Äôt gotta but I‚Äôd try it.
---
Oh, yeah...good point, you‚Äôve convinced me. A lot of thought going into walking all over place searching for an indistinguishable few flies, if you‚Äôre lucky. Seems way more fun than actually enjoying the core gameplay loop.
---
Slap things before they slap you back and panic when they get too close
---
If your asking can u launch the game twice on two seperate tv‚Äôs and consoles.  Yes. On pc I believe u can open two on the same pc and flip flop backwards and forwards
---
Speaking of which, some high levels aren‚Äôt very intelligent either. I contested my friend‚Äôs workshop just by crouching in a bush. Someone that was **level 96** hopped right over my head and continued on looking for me.
---
I also think of drama when the BoS will see how many nukes are launched daily by crazy vault dwellers lol.
---
I know it‚Äôs not the answer you want to hear... but as a (hopefully temporary) solution you can pull out your camera to find it. If it‚Äôs within the frame it will say so in the top right corner, meaning you‚Äôll only need to search a small area to find &amp; loot it (once you find it on the camera.)
---
There is one blocking the elevator in Fort Defiance (Former BOS base)
---
As well as one blocking Paladin Taggerdy's door. 
---
There are a few in the Mistress of Mysteries bunker.
---
Should be the location of a "global auction house" imo
---
Good call, thx for the tip.
---
As long as you use 2 accounts, then yes.
---
None of this will be locked behind a fo1st sub? Mmmmmmm
---
Well better than the god damn corpse disappearing out of thin air cause that definitely needs fixing
---
Or just sell 2 serums....
---
It's a sad state the glitching of meat pile, yes.
---
Thankfully on PC we can get a mod that makes those shit piles glow.
---
&gt; a main quest required for both Wastelanders and the original story was broken
---
Which one? This is first I'm hearing about it.
---
Well when u figure it out make sure u tell everyone and then we can all take our ally‚Äôs to the SBQ event and lag the server so bad it‚Äôs like running through treacle!
---
Look. Get out of my head.
---
Actually I'm just glad I didn't have to slaughter an entire faction to get it.. This time.
---
Gotta wait until whenever they decide to give it to us. but the steel was completed it‚Äôll happen.
---
Its why my friends have trust issues with me when we go into whitesprings üòâ
---
I have a tendency to blow cars and busses up, usually when they are near, in or on them.
---
Can't help It, they make lovely explosions
---
this. run leader of the pack every time you see it until you get all unyielding armor. 5 pieces of unyielding gives you +90 special points. mutations are easy to farm at emmet mountain disposal. you can free fast travel to radiation rumble and then leave the event. multiple toxic pools outside the mine will mutate you quickly. you can only get one mutation per server without serums so you'll have to server hop. if you get a mutation you dont like or get too many rads you can go inside to the rad shower to remove. each time you server hop you can kill the  ~10 disposal employees who are high level, well-equiped and don't fight back. once you get to lv 35 you can get starched genes and keep mutations.
---
I was powering ammo factories but got rid of them because I was annoyed by the sound (and because I heard it was getting people banned)
---
u/H4kk3 earned an upvote for posting a link to the recent patch notes.  Apparently, the quest used to require 3 samples, and it was just changed to only require one on 8/4/2020.  Hopefully they release a patch for the patch soon, so we can all continue.  
---
I am experiencing this issue on XBOX.  I returned with the fuse and blood sample, and tried in the following order:  
---
1. Insert Blood Sample  
---
2. Replace T Fuse  
---
3. Attempted to Analyse the Blood Sample.  
---
The terminal gives an error message that the sample is not in the centrifuge.    
---
Exited the game twice and re-cleared the hospital each time.  It seems like the blood sample and fuse are already in place, and all I need to do is tell the terminal to analyse the sample.
---
I find it interesting to see some responses say the solution is to insert the blood first, then the fuse, because that was the order I originally tried.  I guess it can get stuck no matter which order you choose.
---
I know that this game is just a mess of glitches but my NW experience has not been nearly as bad as what you have come to face. Seems like every bug known to man has hit you in NW but mine are usually fine aside from a crash once in a while.
---
If you dont want to be ANOTHER stealth commando build go heavy weaps and make a low health junkie build instead, my fave build so far.
---
‚ÄúIt just works...‚Äù the wise and all seeing Todd Howard.
---
I dont mean to rant. I just really love this game and franchise and hate to see all the neglect this game gets in regard to bugs.
---
I just got one :) my brother and I launched a nuke on a spawn spot of the Monorail Elevator. Hid in our survival tents and minigunned away.
---
Fair play! Im lvl 162 and still haven‚Äôt launched a nuke.
---
I'm kind of torn on this idea actually. 
---
Part of the appeal initially, to me, was the fact that the wasteland was devoid of human life. Aside from a small group of vault dwellers. 
---
In May of 2019 when I first played, it was really immersive finally getting to WS and seeing it for the first time. The mystery of how it was so pristine and then the bizarre juxtaposition of strolling through the clean hallways surrounded by bots stuck in logic loops. 
---
To see another person would've spoiled this. 
---
So I'm torn, between wanting to maintain that 'isolated and alone' aspect of discovering it versus allowing the world to change with the arrival of new settlers.
---
I heard that they will be reverting the patch to get rid of the double sided wall paper exploit
---
Ill probably just sonate 2 staxks and call it good....
---
Same here and that is why when you go to my camp you will see him decked out in the mistress of mystery regalia including the eye of ra for a bit of bling. Wish they would let me put underpants on his head as well for good measure.
---
Would be real shitty if somebody joined my team and spammed strobe lights around my base
---
The difficulty should exist in killing a legendary enemy, not having to find its corpse because it inevitably rag dolls through a wall. It punishes the player for succeeding.
---
I got everything ready and was just waiting for some friends to do it with and someone in a team i joined for the bonuses solo'd it and i got both the quest completion and the achievment lol.
---
The difference is night and day!
---
My friend has been camped on the Lead/Junk nodes for months now and gets a fairly steady supply of lead from it. 
---
I take my excavator to Lucky Hole once, spend 15 minutes collecting ore and get back to camp with over 600 lead scrap.
---
When he saw those numbers he realized he was isolating himself out in the boonies for no real reason.
---
I can double his daily output with a single trip through the prison and silos as well. Plus I'm not having to remember to check back at camp to empty the extractor every few minutes either. 
---
Acid is the only node worth camping over, in my opinion.
---
Quad Ass head actually deals more damage than a bloodied when.
---
Dang was looking for some teammates, mine kinda stopped playing. I'm on pc tho :/
---
Are you talking the munitions factory?
---
Like always, they will find a way ...
---
An honorable rogue is a rarity.
---
Outside the forest? No, I don‚Äôt think so somehow. Its one of the most western workshops in the game. If anything that workshop is the one that‚Äôs deepest in the forest. I have little to no use for it except gold.
---
one reasion they pk you is the challage for killing players, they want the atom.
---
Literally any melee weapon. Until they buff the Shish, then anything but that. Fix my bby
---
I'm just now hitting the 50's with my alt, haven't even started Enclave missions.
---
Selling water like this from level 1 will have me easily able to afford all the serums I want by the time I do. ;p
---
Why Cuba wtf how we get there swimming?
---
&gt; This game needs so much fixing.
---
~~And maybe a few cheat mods~~
---
This is one of the biggest reasons I quit this game. Shouldn‚Äôt feel like an obligation almost.
---
Promises. To weaken the protests after patch 21. Nothing else.
---
Make it to where modded characters can't interact with non-modded characters? Regulating it to private servers screws over those who don't want to pay 100 a year or 13 a month for them .
---
I imagine nexus mods for fallout 4 could mostly be ported over to 76 pretty easily. Clothing emote and camp mods will be the first. Weapons and armor surely to follow (along with their paint jobs). May see some camp budget mods. Server side mods like changing PvP rules or hiding players on the map could happen.
---
The most likely scenario is Bethesda allows servers with mods to exist outside of the 76 ecosystem. You won't get XP or the likes on a modded server. But I imagine they'll let you use your atom store stuff.
---
I‚Äôm smack dab in the middle of everyone on this one. I think the negative initial reaction to 76 was stupid. It was a bunch of New Vegas fanbois trying to diss the game simply because Bethesda made it. They wanted to promote the new Outer Worlds game they were salivating over and I think hoped OW would take over as spiritual successor to the old fallout spirit. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I loved New Vegas. Obsidian did good with that one.  But I couldn‚Äôt stand Outer Worlds. 76 is a *far* better and more beautiful game than OW, which is movement-restricted, washed out, and essentially a story and loreless plagerization of the Bioshock franchise‚Äôs artwork.
---
However, despite the fact that I give the initial point to Bethesda, I think the 76 fanbois are *just as crazy* as the Obsidian ones. They loudly shout down any criticism of Bethesda. And there‚Äôs a lot to criticize about how Bethesda implements new content, *all.the.bugs*, zero investment in basic UI QoL improvements, and a monetization scheme that is so greedy it has become gross. To force that monetization Bethesda also uses time gating they to turn us all into mice paying to push a button for some cheese. This is harmful to people‚Äôs real lives and is painful to be a part of supporting (so much shame!)
---
Ultimately, fallout 76 didn‚Äôt deserve the negative criticisms it got early on the base game was solid. It does deserve criticism now though. They have cash coming out their ears but apparently cannot pay designers, writers, ui experts, not devs so they just keep reskinning shit and releasing broken garbage as if that‚Äôs okay to do. 
---
That‚Äôs all down the road for you though. The base game really is solid. It‚Äôs the biggest Fallout world too. It plays like a fallout game, and even adds some technical improvements like better lighting effects etc. Also it has some of the social qualities of an mmo without the life suck that MMOs have.
---
I‚Äôd go ahead and buy it but decide for yourself whether you want to pay for the monthly sub too.
---
Vats is broken
---
Just an FYI
---
Who knows you might find a Frag moulded into a suit of power armour in the next few days. Kinda makes vented legs useless
---
I was bored and dumb and placed like 8 at one of my old camps
---
&gt; Isolate chacter to private only so once 1st runs out you can't access that chacter.
---
Oh god please no. Or make private servers free to those who want to play with mods but can't afford Fallout 1st
---
Sophia wears mine - thought it might help with her headaches
---
1st subscribers enjoy this ability. They will drop loot on their private server from a main account. Leave and come back to the private server to pick said items on the alt acct. It's unlikely youll be able to do this with a public server as servers are random. You can join through a friend.
---
It should, no more fucking 40mm, missiles and nukes messing up my weight limit.
---
I have mine an area with acid/fertilizer. I just check back at my camp every once in a while, pick up 10 acid and whenever I need lead I go to the mine. 20 minutes later and some button mashing i can craft as much ammo as I need.
---
I got 4, they're there for my water farming.
---
If they give us a BoS collectron I'm buying it, building it, and nuking my own base.
---
*puke emote*
---
&gt; The most likely scenario is Bethesda allows servers with mods to exist outside of the 76 ecosystem. 
---
True. I hope they have some way to scan your account and see if your playing with mods or not and then they just toss you into a mod-only server. 
---
&gt;Server side mods like changing PvP rules or hiding players on the map could happen.
---
Hmm? What about a mod that removes hunger and thirst?
---
Always.
---
I wanna fuck with the engine
---
Test what is broken and test guns that couldn't exist normally
---
I got a quad laser rifle, actually had some really good rills but since the LR is trash it's meh at best.
---
Lots of fun for pissing away fusion cells though.
---
I bought the plans for 500c on PC a few days ago.
---
FO needs its veteran maelstrom arena. Everything is too easy  once your build is complete. 
---
It would never be as involved as ESO, because fallout has way simpler mechanics, but adding some difficult content would be great for the game.
---
Build multiple vendors, pretty simple
---
Just place multiple vendors? 
---
Then on one add guns, on another add armor,  on another add plans etc etc? 
---
A bit more descriptive in your post?
---
More the fact that the way I built my camp the water purifiers are nowhere near main building so I dont want to have wires or conduit running all the way across my camp
---
Scorched Earth, Path to Enlightenment, and Uranium Fever. Just because I like them and they are fun
---
Well I did that but it still shows the same thing.
---
Also the roof of the red rocket in flatwoods can span one. The church can spawn three.
---
yep. you‚Äôre a pve‚Äôr, right?
---
Hunger &amp; thirst penalties are going away in the next update, anyway. There'll be mods to reimplement them, and probably make food/water extremely scarce. Definitely going to be mods that not only eliminate the daily currency limits, but eliminate the grind altogether and let you craft specific legendary effects on specific weapons. And make rare plans/outfits guaranteed drops from their events, or from vendors. Personally, I've got a few notes on what I'd like to do with weapon balance in a mod: like changing the Lever Rifle to use .44 rounds, buffing pistols, buffing the range on shotguns, etc. 
---
I'm 99% positive you're going to need Fallout 1st in order to run a modded world, and all mods are going to have to be hosted on Bethesda's site for security reasons. And 100% certain that copying our characters into modded worlds will be a one-way trip. So I expect a lot of mods in general that give you more control over the world, and less dependence on other players for certain things since you'd only be able to play with friends that share the exact same modlist.
---
For you it will. For others it won‚Äôt.
---
Tbh I think Bethesda has an update coming that removes hunger and thirst. I think I remember reading somewhere they don't want to penalize players anymore but instead focus on what food and drink do as a buff.
---
But with modding it comes down to what Bethesda does. But the modding ability is limitless. 
---
If Bethesda sells servers where they control the server and you have to manually install mods or install from a list of certified mods they approve of, you'll be much more limited. However if you can rent your own server from a random server provider and code it yourself the sky is the limit. I've seen some amazing servers for games like GTAV. Zombie servers police servers end of the world ones...
---
I think the modding community has tons of potential. How much or little Bethesda allows will change that dynamic.
---
For you it will,  but for others it won‚Äôt. 
---
Label them so you know too.
---
Im sure they are going to release other "skins" for the Ammo Converter and put em up in the store for Free or paid, but eventually, everyone will have one. So yeah this is a great idea, give us points instead of ammo and that will make things so much easier and I'll have a reason to go to the machine every once in a while.
---
Not really. It shows what's on sale on all of them.
---
At thw top you'll see items in that vendor and then items in other vendors. If you hover over an item it says at the bottom if the item is in that vendor or in other vendor
---
Spins up much like any other minigun.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for also. I‚Äôd like to build it how I want. I have a feeling it‚Äôll be a pre fab though.
---
Any info or word on a fix?
---
My airship homie.
---
I think they meant in terms of content, like new weapons/gear, choice and consequences, allies - sucks that they‚Äôre not major allies though.
---
There's some really good advice in here, but if you can ask questions as they pop up it might be more helpful.
---
Are you playing on Xbox? If so I am free to help whenever I'm playing. Gamertag is CensorErikii
---
Laser muskets aren't in the game anymore, strictly speaking. I know the plan but when I craft it the mats get eaten and nothing else happens. Its also not normally obtainable, I picked it up from a player vendor. The original copies all came from the dev rooms.
---
Shotgunner, actually, is very strong! If you run them with a Gauss Shotgun! That's mostly because the GS is pants on head. It's so strong that you don't need to equip shotgun cards if you dont want to. By comparison Pump, Combat and Double are all pretty awful even with shotgun cards.
---
Just a note on legacy plasma guns. The rifles and pistols never dropped as explosive, for a while they only dropped 1*. Any explosive plasma rifles/pistols are hacked. It just wanted to clarify, since it seemed like they were being roped in to the pile there.
---
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Who knows
---
Where did you read that hunger and thirst are being removed?
---
A revamped dungeon system for Fallout 76 coming soon.
---
It's still up to them to decide what goes on the server, how it runs and what tier they opted for.
---
Junkie's isn't the be-all end-all for full health builds. Get yourself a slow, powerful weapon with the Instigating legendary for clearing out areas of mobs. Get yourself a fast weapon with Furious for bosses. Get a Vampire's shotgun or automatic weapon to regen health faster than you can lose it. Get a weapon that really takes advantage of Quad, like a Tesla Rifle.
---
As someone whose last name is Maxson it‚Äôs not Maxon it‚Äôs Maxson!!! It‚Äôs a common mistake but it drives me nuts. It‚Äôs ok though.
---
An alien themed daily op/expedition would actually be fucking cool wont lie
---
Because we all know what Power Armor looks like, so is it worth lagging these struggling servers even more? That being said, it was announced at the Q+A that this is coming üòê
---
If it means we get content quicker and its cheaper for Bethesda I don't care. ESO has been very successful since starting to theme certain expansions or updates around older locations. I'd absolutely hop back in game right away if we headed out to GNR Plaza or Raven Rock or The Pitt. Hell, send us South near the Mojave. There are lots of locations in Fallout I would love to see again, not only for nostalgia, just because we can see these places in the time period of 76. See things in a new light.
---
I guarantee next time you won't see the repeatable XP score
---
What is wrong with adding a pvp public team?  It won't affect the rest of you as you could either not join it or immediately leave a group that changed to that option.  I can think of several ways to grief (which I won't do) that the public team system made easier.
---
NW is not the same as proper open world or workshop pvp and also I play on pc, as far as I know it is still filled with hackers.
---
Mothership Zeta would be really good as public event where Dwellers who choose to participate on the event get abducted and have to go through sort of a ‚Äúprison escape‚Äù game together.
---
I didn't realize it was such a problem.  I'm 289 or so, and I still like to play "Mysterious Stranger" and help people defend.   I don't show up with junk on me, of course, but just wave and set about killing things.....try to leave a little health on enemies for them to kill or mop up after they get a hit, but if they look like they're getting overwhelmed, it's kill everything.  It would be disappointing to show up to help and get killed for it.
---
We could help repair Codsworth and help defend him in Sanctuary Hills whilst he prepares dinner for Nate and Nora.
---
In the words of Valve: Soon^TM
---
excellent advice ....    reclaim is so much faster than defend
---
No, only thing we need is a bank to transfer items safe between characters.
---
As long as it‚Äôs not gold bullion exclusive...
---
The devs said in an interview a few months ago that they were getting rid of them.
---
I think it makes sense lore-wise. Post-apocalyptic wasteland, whats going to stop any group of vault dwellers from doing what they want. Now there's different factions to join (although, the faction system is off imo and id rather karma than rep) which are "warring" so it makes sense to have some that have gone full on raider and attack fellow vault dwellers that haven't. At least thats how I see it.
---
Same. I got my gold around 4 pm est on Saturday.
---
Thanks. Really hope they do it eventually
---
tactical emp maybe
---
Doesn't make sense that there isn't an option for at least friends to build in your camp while in a public team.  Currently you have to disband the public team and lose all the bonuses then reform as a private team to build stuff.
---
They have been adding item that are discounted just for fallout 1st for a few weeks.
---
Same! Finally bit the bullet and bought it, and now I can‚Äôt even do the main quest line
---
It's already been talked about.  
---
They're going to turn using food and water into a buff, instead of *not* using feed and water being a nerf.
---
Yeah, no joke.  So sick of seeing 95% hit on VATS and three of them not hitting at all.  At close range.
---
Probably like Fallout 4.
---
My guess is:
---
Full Mod Support on Xbox One/Series X
---
Asset-Free Mod Support on PS4/PS5
---
Might want to get a friend in that world first, no guarantee you will end up in the same one in public servers and even some FO1st members have had trouble recently in getting back into the same world.
---
This has been my biggest disappointment in the game tbh. I loved my power armor display building in FO4
---
Hey, nice to see a real gun lover.   :)    Thanks for info.
---
Haha, fairly certain it's the second one. I've just been there so it definitely still exists
---
https://massivelyop.com/2020/05/28/fallout-76-interview-bethsoft-on-one-wasteland-text-chat-and-other-radioactive-topics/
---
"Another big change for One Wasteland is the removal of¬†Fallout 76‚Äôs¬†negative survival elements. As it stands right now, if you don‚Äôt eat or drink for a while in the game, you‚Äôll find yourself struggling on with a heavy debuff. But in One Wasteland, there will be no penalties, only bonuses for those who take the time to quaff and scarf all they find. ‚ÄúWe want the flavor of survival without the drudgery,‚Äù Gardiner said."
---
Precious bodily fluids!
---
The fighting bit was cool but trying to look for small items was a pain
---
Again, they should publish this so non1st players can consider the additional benefits and maybe subscribe. I dont understand why they wouldn't...
---
Yeah that makes sense (and at this point Bethesda won't waste any chance to earn more money) but i swear to god if they want to force me to pay for mods once again, this game is dead for me. For good.
---
I had two scorchbeast corpses come with me to the Watoga train station after Scorched Earth. Not sure if it it‚Äôs a related bug or not.
---
He reset when they dropped the update last Tuesday. So you could buy 300 bullion twice this week if you bought it before the patch.
---
Yeah I agree, I competed it the other day and literally bored AF now. Doing XP runs is only entertaining for so long.
---
I just log in and do the 3 dailies to get gold then a quick whitesprings, west tek and huntersville run and log off.
---
To a degree. I work with AWS servers professionally. I'm pretty sure servers actually powered by hamster wheels isn't an available option.
---
Yes it already switched to concrete
---
Shame they wouldn't protect anything as that level 6 scorch with a 10mm will keep smiling gyour camp from miles away
---
You can still get the gun at the end, so don't worry.
---
Bring a gamma gun round for times you die to get your nerd rage back quickly
---
Not the best choice of words on my part, sorry.
---
A guy practically saved my life on my first build when I was relying on Perfect Storm and could not keep up with 10 mm.   He had a ton in vending for free.   I'm still thankful.
---
Likewise leading to the rather unsurprising insinuation that what they have on their server hardware is running rather poorly.
---
Hamsters may very well be the software engineerd
---
YouTube NoRespawns. He has several videos showing how to do it. You use the half floor pieces attached to stairs and position them so the midpoint is over the corner you want to place the pillar. The pillar snaps to the middle of the half floor and that is above the corner you want. I suggest looking for norespawns video because he shows how to do it MUCH better than I explained it.
---
Yes it's ignoring lots of things, but not the point I was making, it's showing how they sacrificed them self for everybody. Also the commander was pleading with BoS members not to leave and join the responders. We can cherry pic all day, point is the BoS is not just bad, some time they are good sometimes they are bad. And morally grey decisions damned if you do or damned if you don't is one of the things that has made fallout great.
---
This is what I was trying to say,  but my morning brain hadn‚Äôt kicked in! 
---
Listen to this post OP.
---
I used mine with a Prime Receiver for a while, but it's just so cost inefficient. It's not that drastic a difference in damage compared to the Tesla one, and I can carry 40% more normal, much cheaper to craft/find ammo.
---
It's an exploit currently.
---
Great list!     
---
Feeling stupid, but not sure what "private worlds stay active" means.   Are you saying farm a private world, log out to adventure for 10 minutes, log back in and it will be refreshed?   What guarantee is there that you'll end up in that refreshed private world?
---
Same here. I get unyielding SS rolls really often. It‚Äôs the rolling pin and pitchfork of armor, but actually useful. I got three quickly and finally said ok let‚Äôs try it.
---
Nice! Congrats! What level?
---
Wow, no kidding.   What a picture!
---
It‚Äôs right supposed to be next to Hornwright Air Purifier right?
---
Yeah I'm not holding my breath. I just hope they do pull through with them. I'm not giving them any of my money until I see the actual content.
---
I have never done a junk run for anything other than lead and acid, my inability to drop my excess steel results in me carrying 3k steel and then justifying it by trading half of it for lead 2 steel to 1 lead then finding acid and making stupid amounts of ammo
---
I have around 100k ammo on me and it's only gonna go up üòÖ
---
Do you really mean a Mini Fault, or the Chinese Bunker?
---
&gt; Tbh I think Bethesda has an update coming that removes hunger and thirst.
---
Oh thank god. More time to explore without worrying about eating all the time.
---
I think it's purpose will be to collect Energy Ammunition and weapns like Fusion Cells, Laser Pistols, Plasma Cartridges, Flamer Feul etc. Kinda like how the Raider Collectron collects Ballistic Ammo and Ballistic weapons pretty much the opposite
---
It was late, I was tired, couldn‚Äôt think of what it was actually called
---
Learn to sneak fire while moving backwards diagonally when shooting high health enemies (impostor sheepsquatch, sheepsquatch, scorchbeast) to maintain stealth. If you don‚Äôt play sneak invest in Serendipity and blocker, if you‚Äôre power armor and no vats you might want Dodgy. Got as much dmg perks as you can and nothing outside event boss won‚Äôt go down in a few hits.
---
If I'm not too late, no, I do not think you should buy the game.  While it is true it has been improved since launch, it simply turned from flaming dogshit into regular dogshit.  It still runs badly, it is still very buggy, and to top it off is the diarrhea that is in-game microtransactions where the most gullible and money-laden get all the cool shit.  You'd be better off spending time and/or money on another endeavor.
---
Disappointing. Zero new information, literally nothing that's not been discussed, promised or leaked alread.
---
How about the weapons work, as well as the basic game mechanics.
---
They can't do this with the currency limit and I doubt they will remove that
---
Literally got two rolling pins while doing sbq
---
I haven't been donating as I eat through steel too quick to bother but I've been making it a point to stop there and drop any known plans or ammo I'm not using, for any low levels giving their all for it.
---
I tried blocking my ally's way to the console, and tried making it impossible for her to leave it with furniture surrounding her; I wondered if fast traveling while she was mid teleport could trigger this effect, but wasn't able to determine. 
---
There were several occasions on her way back to my CAMP where she got hung up on something and I saw her teleport, but she only teleported a couple of feet past the obstacle, not back to CAMP or to her console.
---
I can only suggest things as a sniper build, I don't play melee.  Marsupial is important.  Bird Bones or gear that lessens fall damage is also useful.  Use cover to your advantage and stay high up out of reach, rooftops are your friends.  You can also jump up on some trees.  A stealth build adds even more damage but you have to have patience.   Don't forget a suppressor on your weapon.  Unyielding is overrated for Bloodied ranged if you can manage your weight properly.  I find AP refresh and one piece of Chameleon to be of more use.  If you are in tight quarters with nowhere high to jump the Chinese Stealth Suit is great.  Just remember to use cover and don't be afraid to run away until they stop looking for you.  Escape Artist is useful here as well.  If you play smart you don't really need to put points into Stealth.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôll give you the plans to make it!
---
Due to an issue, dates have reverted to pre war and everyone was captured and executed for: Theft, looting, murder, property damage, trespassing, trespassing on government property, use of nuclear weapons, use of chemical weapons, use of chems, knowing too much, building without permission, creation and distribution of weapons without a permit, harming the local wildlife, and trampling the flowers.
---
What I know it's one of the bigger mmo's in terms of player numbers.
---
I have been playing it for 6 and a half years now, the game has its ups and downs, but the amount of content is staggering. 
---
In terms of pve content there is a lot, there are 5  chapters (main stories). There are smaller dlc named zone dlc, some of these tie into their respective chapter, some don't.
---
The base game itself is imo very solid and the chapters only add upon that.
---
PVP is divided between three activities:
---
Cyrodill
---
Battlegrounds
---
Dueling
---
Cyrodill is supposed to be a war like pvp experience, capture keeps and fortresses with your alliance, Cyrodill also has the Imperial city. Which is divided into multiple sections and includes an entire sewer to explore.
---
Battlegrounds is s classic arena experience, objective based team games. It's fun, but you gotta have decent pvp build.
---
Dueling is just inviting random people in pve areas to a fight, pretty straightforward.
---
The game has its issues, there are more often than not performance issues, especially Cyrodill and while Zenimax is trying their best to fix this it has been a very slow progress,
---
All in all it is one of the best MMO's I played, and while it ain't perfect, I love it. A steady stream of content made sure I haven't been left without anything to do for the last six and halve years.
---
Same, dropped off lots of excess stuff there. Might skip the concrete segment after all..
---
Ballistic Fiber items would be nice.
---
That's quite strange, hmmmm.
---
I'm glad you made it, and I like the direction your coping skills took.  (heart)
---
Dang, I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
The Enclave is coming. Wonder what‚Äôs taking them so long...  
---
*Somewhere in Kansas*  
---
Enclave General: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making great time to Whitesprings. A few more days and we‚Äôll be in Appalachia.‚Äù
---
Enclave Soldier: ‚ÄúAre you sure about this Vault Dweller tagging along with us? Dude seems...off.‚Äù
---
General: ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? He‚Äôs great. Look, he even has a little Vault Boy puppet. How bad could he be?‚Äù
---
Aww, a little baby is trying to feed off of Mama
---
I'd rather it switch back the daily/weekly atom challenges. I dread what they're going to do with the challenges during the downtime.
---
#Disappointment.
---
Jump often while attacking horde enemies while sneaking (they will think you‚Äôre in the air and fire upwards when you land), that‚Äôs one way to avoid too many caution shots towards your direction, keep moving while shooting. Escape artist is a must perk for sneaking in case you‚Äôre ever in danger just stand up and sneak again and you‚Äôre back to caution. Bufftats, stimpaks, and stealthboy are recommended as your hotkey.
---
It‚Äôs like what, 50 miles off the coast of Florida? People can move between the two places by a small raft, in history involuntarily.
---
Fusion cores maybe. Possibly occasional power armor pieces. Im guessing anything typically associated with BOS ie power armor related items, energy weapons, heavy weapons and their ammo
---
I had the same problem, and for some reason I did this exact order and it magically worked
---
Quit the entire game and start it up again
---
Interact with the terminal and read all of the diary entries and other selections except for the blood analysis.
---
Insert the T fuse into the fuse box
---
Go back to the terminal and analyze the blood.
---
I've had that happen a few times too. I think that after a Scorchbeast dies it triggers an instance of the Scorchbeast specifically for each player, since it's physics behavior, a.k.a. falling out of the sky and bouncing is specific to each player. This is why I can find the Scorchbeast body in one location but my team mates will find it in separate locations. This also happens with deceased creatures like Wendigo.
---
In that way it maybe spawning the Scorchbeast corpse in the same way as an NPC or something, And that process gets stuck and repeats a few times occasionally.
---
It's fantastic.   I've played 3, 4 and LV.....all several times each.   This game is definitely Fallout.   Buggy, but still Fallout.
---
4 vendors and 9 industrial water purifiers (tried for 10) for the moment
---
Once a week...for 5 minutes. 
---
‚ÄúEveryone logged on?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYup‚Äù
---
‚ÄúRight, everyone may now log off‚Äù
---
Considering that every single time I‚Äôve done that challenge that damned Mirelurk King has killed me. No matter how stealthy I am, how much I try to avoid him he finds me and boom I‚Äôm dead. No it‚Äôs not worth it.
---
Its funny I had the idea about those expeditions a few months ago so I'm interested in that part
---
I want legendary chainsaws and drills and perks for power-tools too.  
---
I first saw the drill and got super excited only to be told by a friend that they don't work like I want them to. I tried but like... as a rifleman my spear does more damage.
---
I got a card yesterday from the quest chain.
---
You only need to activate event at the terminal or do you need to do something else before?
---
(Did the event a couple of times by now but never started it). Ty
---
Cork scrap
---
There‚Äôs always Fallout Brotherhood of Steel lol
---
if I you had gold, I'd prefer you shoved it up your own ass and leave me alone
---
The only time i needed more than one was for my mountain top/bunker camp. I needed one for the building on top and one for the bunker part inside seneca rocks because i could'nt glitch cables thru.
---
It would be fun as hell to try those new weapons but I don't want to hype too much
---
how many ammo types do you find between stash boxes that you don't need?
---
the worst part about dumb people is that they think they're smart, so I suggest you don't bother replying because nothing good came out of it
---
Its been a while since I did the quest but Im pretty sure what you get from the quest is an already crafted recall keycard and all you need to do is to use the terminal at the Pylon site. The first step sends out the server wide alert that the event is starting. Wait for a bit for players to turn up then when you are satified do the second step which is to recall the robot. Then get ready for a pretty tough battle. Make sure there is plenty of high level players on the server. Youll know if you just pay attention to the events. if plenty of people are turning up to them then you should get a good turn up
---
Were there only vendor NPCs or something before Wastelanders? Did you not have NPCs handing out quests or anything?
---
I can't imagine the game without Rose &amp; Overseer right now, yeah would feel lonely
---
CD Projekt Red was smart enough to just hire the best modders they found since Witcher 1, and were humble enough to even say, "They knew the game better than we did."
---
Wish Bethesda would take a page from that.
---
yeah it's called "trail and error" and it's a build where you do whatever you want

---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been running it for 200 odd levels now. Its pretty solid
---
Ty
---
BoS related stuff
---
so power armour, heavy weapons and ammo and energy weapons/ammo
---
they did a stream yesterday where they said they were gonna do powe armour displays
---
A semi-auto heavy sniper rifle that requires strength perks and PA to use.
---
(I'd love the Anti-materiel Rifle, but that would be most likely a perception-based weapon which is already predominant.)
---
it was easier than running wiring around the whole camp. one inside to run interior lights and stuff, then one sitting outside just running the 10 large water purifiers
---
I always assumed the STASH did that?
---
Cork scrap will be legacy after the corkpocalypse ...the end is near
---
What a guy
---
graphical updates
---
pretty sure you need a private server to mod on anyways, so enjoy paying a subscription just to get mods
---
There's a large group of new players who don't have the capital to buy serum recipes.
---
Wouldn't you have to look on the map to know if it's just a regular rad storm or over connected to a nuke zone?
---
what a load of shit
---
it's super easy to get food and drink, but they're removing it?
---
Only so much nuclear material in the world bro
---
I mean rad storms are rather small and if you see a large area covered in a green cloud plus the smoke plume of the mushroom cloud I think you can tell the difference without opening up the map.
---
it took me a long time to realize why you see camps with multiple water purifiers; collected water is resold to vendor-bots at 4 caps each, 25 water = 100 caps from the vendor, free money
---
It would be nice to see all those, but I always wondered, how the rest of the world looks like...
---
Same amount of 150mil, except cork which requires, 200mil.
---
Congrats on the Fixer plan! I'm still trying to get one, but no drop yet and no luck finding one in any vendors on Xbox. Let the grind continue.
---
Schadenfreude my friend. Rightfully earned in this case.
---
Yeah, you're right it is lazy but this is how Bethesda has been with this game even prior to its launch.
---
It goes to show that Bethesda doesn't do QA or even play their own game. It must be like a coding sweat shop. You're told what to fix and you do exactly that and nothing more.
---
The sad truth of it all was that it was an unnecessary fix. While there was a bug with that quest that affected a tiny fraction of the community, no on asked for the quest to be dumbed down to having just one sample instead of three.
---
Well, I hope that you at least appreciate that most of the complaints and negativity towards Bethesda is based on fact and they're deserving of such criticism.
---
22 industrial water purifiers(?), 4 missile turrets, and a searchlight; I need three reactors.
---
Private worlds stay active for a few minutes after you log out. It‚Äôs so you can get back to a workshop if you disconnect. You should have around five minutes.
---
Bloodied to ungodly amounts of damage. The game is clearly not balanced around the builds or idea of it. 
---
Do NOT be to scared to attack and hide (I know saying that will piss off a lot of people). You do so much damage and a decent amount of damage resistance is all you need. Most bloodied player dispute who good there build is can kill a hoard of max level super mutants easily. So don't think you need to concern yourself hiding away form combat.
---
You also shouldn't be at 20% (or whatever percentage you pick) health all of the time. There is no issue in being at 50% or 75% health if you need to. You should change the amount of rads you have to the situation. If you say keep dying to the SBQ for example, remove some rads. If you are not dying at all, increase your rads.
---
Don't feel that 1 star bloodied is not good. Like I said before, the game is not balanced around bloodied. You'll find the game is actually pretty easy and holds no real challenge after you get used to low health.
---
Pick perks that avoid damage first like serndipity (can't spell xD) before perks like nerd rage. Though try to have both as it isn't difficult to do so.
---
If you don't like playing bloodied and decide against it, keep adrenal reaction because honestly the extra damage out ways  the loss of 50hp to a point that its a joke.
---
That's not passive.
---
Thanks!. I hope you get one soon!
---
tbh except bugs and delays, we got almost everything exciting that they promised.
---
You can already build junk extractors if your camp is over a junk pile.
---
I have two accounts, both my Fallout76Custom.ini &amp; Fallout76Custom2.ini are still there and intact. 
---
I shall check the in game settings for any alterations by the patch but I run on an old gtx 750ti so would notice any changes to my minimal display settings, the game is fine except for this ash pile issue.
---
thanks
---
don‚Äôt buy this shit
---
So someone dropped me 200+ plans on my level 1 alt.  I inboxed and let them know it was my alt so I didn't want to take it (they were happy to unload all the plans either way, we all feel this) anyway one plan was the fixer and my husband was so happy!  We've been grinding for that or Stimpack diffuser plans.
---
No problem. It‚Äôs how a lot of people and myself transfer items between characters.
---
I‚Äôve thought about this before, and i think it‚Äôd work in a private server. But in a public server, all of that data still has to go to the Bethesda server and ping back out to the other 15 people in your game. So you wouldn‚Äôt save anything. Bethesda would need to add that blueprint permanently to the build menu for everyone, to be able to load it quicker. 
---
At the end of the day, the server crashes we experience are because people are already glitching camp budget and doing things they shouldn‚Äôt. The servers already can‚Äôt take the capacity of what‚Äôs on them
---
I have a bloodied gauss and a 90%RW minigun
---
Sorry the idea here is a bit of a joke xD No one who is giving you grief at level 15 cares if you want to do PvP. They just want to kill you to feel like a big man, you telling them you don't want to is only going to encourage it.
---
Still kind of hilarious that there's a building team setting and you can't actually build with your team. Classic bethesda.
---
Circus trailer was patched, sorry to say.
---
yup
---
I was thinking about a gaus weapon to be fair. I have the UGL as a scorchbeast Queen weapon
---
switched the audio device on the computer the game is running on to Steam Streaming something
---
Same for the SQueen guys.  I didn't drop the nuke but I was in a big group for the queen, almost everyone was over level 200, and killed the queen in about 10 seconds.  I've done the queen prob a hundred times, no 2 fights have been the same but omg, poor guy who launched didn't even get a hit in.  He arrived, she was done and he did the ??? emote.  : ( Thankfully someone else dropped 2 more so he was able to get those.  Still sucks.
---
You're probably being ganked for the very reason of tagging kills rather than actually contributing to the event and actually getting rid of them.
---
In general I use a Two Shot Auto Grenade Launcher as sidearm for my Bloodied explosive unarmed melee build. This beast shreds like hell. And for fights in buildings or small areas a Bloodied Handmade. Low Vats cost and good dmg output.
---
Side note, anyone have any actual tips for this event?  It's soooooo overwhelming for me. I honestly hate this event the lasers give me a migraine.
---
4 missile turrets will use up the output of one fusion generator all by themselves.
---
Any idea what there worth now?
---
Your "how Bethesda could fuck it up" section is charmingly optimistic. 
---
You could end up in Apocrypha. The Deep Ones could use it as a portal to invade Earth. It could lead to nowhere. It could sink so far into the ground that it becomes inaccessible. It could port you 1,000 feet into the sky. They could get it working fine on this side, but then once you're in the instance they could have forgotten to add a return door, and disabled fast travel, leaving us all trapped in our own individual caves until the patch three months later. You could place the door but a Brahmin spawns instead. The door could act as a black hole, consuming Appalachia. The instanced interior could spawn on top of the normal map, and crash the server. They could implement it perfectly but somehow break VATS even more than it is now. Fifty level 90 yao-guai could burst out whenever you go near it, forcing you to rebuild your entire camp because you couldn't get near enough to delete it. They could accidentally put the code for a nuke in the door, destroying your entire camp and generating a nuke zone whenever you place one. 
---
Or it could work as intended, I guess. I'm not hugely excited about it to be honest - generating an instanced interior would take some of the fun out of it for me.
---
Why not a bank?  Like I can deposit my scrip in a bank or my extra caps.  The limits are super weird.
---
Easy farming, also can benefit everyone if using explosive weapons to get a tag on basically every Scorched.
---
No, no. Mods are client side, most of what you listed would never be allowed. Just see Nexusmods for currently working mods, cosmetic stuff only mostly.
---
6k-12k caps
---
It's all about XP now this game, at least till the end of the Legendary run.
---
I've got one if you want it make me an offer
---
Well you could just trade like a normal person, if you spend some time hopping servers and checking player vendors you will surely find very valuable stuff and then just trade that to items you need.
---
I honestly would LOVE a companion overhaul and the ability to recruit the random settlers, and raiders to our faction of choice.  
---
Also someone needs to make a mod so I can stick my bears on my bed!
---
Not sure, but I have caps, plans, and lots of ammo I can barter for a trade!
---
There is plenty of scope to farm materials. Is every event going to ruined in the name of farming?
---
I carry a vampires explosive 10mm for those hard to reach places
---
Tis a dream. If they dropped an expansion similar to ESO's Morrowind. Like hey let's go to New Vegas or even like California.
---
Do you have any shotgun shells
---
&gt; pretty sure you need a private server to mod on anyways, 
---
They could just make it to where players with mods enabled can't interact with those who don't.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a fair and well articulated point. What if Bethesda had prefabs for just magazines and bobble head stands and even a selection of common used prefab displays? You‚Äôd have to still collect all of the items required to make them (all Grognak mags/Nuka bottles etc.). But once you had them, you could craft it into a single item whereby you could no longer take the magazines/bobble heads/item off it. It just becomes a single unit within the CAMP budget?
---
Could put the console on a small platform high up? 
---
Was also thinking if you destroy the console with a flamethrower trap, what would happen to the ally
---
Yup , they stated that Fractured Steel will be shipped with several patch just like Legendary Run so perhaps Expeditions things pushed back
---
Commenting for later
---
Yeeeeees now we‚Äôre talking. For example, the reward for collecting all 20 bobbleheads is that you unlock a plan for the display, which displays all 20 but consumes one of each. That‚Äôs a brilliant idea dude
---
Sometimes the aesthetic is what they're after
---
I hope they don't. I've got it and I like that it's kind of limited. 
---
But they will definitely bring it back at some point.
---
Once I roll a bloodied gauss shotgun I will respec my character to get some shotgun perks. I use my rifle with no perks at all, more of a starter weapon so I can lure enemies to where I want to fight
---
Yeah but my problem with a shotgun is its a close range weapon. And if I'm close range enough to use a shotgun efficiently then I may aswell use my DCG
---
It's good that you've had the courage to open up about this. This isn't the sort of thing people should feel stigmatised talking about. 
---
If you haven't already done so, I'd seriously look into professional help. It might also take a few goes to find the right person that works for you.
---
While it's fantastic that you're feel happier by helping others in the game and you get some enjoyment with the game, just be careful that you're not just doing this to fill that black hole of sadness and despair. If your satisfaction from helping others fades or the game is cancelled you're left with nothing to deal with that emptiness and pain.
---
You're a good person. I hope thing work out for you in the long run, I really do.
---
I tried putting the wanderer chair in the roof to keep her from playing the guitar all the time. She would just teleport up there then fall all when finished.
---
Surely someone must have surplus budget to try out a flamethrower trap?
---
I'm guessing it won't affect anything other than their behavior.
---
True, I havent used a gauss shotgun, but i have seen someone using one at decent range and it was mowing stuff down ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
America itself!
---
legendary perks more important i guess
---
But he's right. Pre-patch you could have engaged whole squad for glorious 1vsMany; now it is virtually impossible. 
---
Yesterday I took a workshop
---
from three PA armoured dudes and only the og owner could fight; others were just jumping around, trying to tag me, and I couldn't. Something is very buggy with the current implementation.
---
it speeds the event up so you can get to doing other things
---
59-60-61, I got tons of XP and I was almost level 60 when I entered the missile silo
---
The text mod isn't sadly deficient as a replacement for voice chat. In the over a year I've been using it I've never seen someone with the mod on the same server as I am.
---
The mod is ok if you want to just chat like it's an in-game discord or for trading but utterly useless otherwise.
---
Its just like the trial firework mine. Its totally a feature, not a bug. Just like fast travel.
---
Bethesda is a small team in the the gaming world. But even then their team is spilt between around 3/4 divisions, Austin being the smallest. 
---
Given the nature of business and the pure will 76's community has to hand over their money. I doubt testing their patches are done well. I mean it make no sense for a small team to do so if everyone is already spending their money on them.
---
What was weird is when you entered as a slave equiped with a t-60 and a 50. Machinegun, they should have made us go with almost no equippement.
---
It's not ruined, it's actually better now.
---
The selection on Nexusmods is only so limited *because* mod support hasn't been implemented yet; they can only add clientside mods like texture packs or UI replacers, and none that might impact the gameplay. 
---
Once official mod support is implemented, we'll be able to use mods that add new content or change the game mechanics, although I don't expect super advanced stuff like script extenders will ever be supported.
---
The mod is ok if you just want to chat or do trading (really the best reason for the mod). 
---
It's horrible as a voice chat replacement because almost no one uses it for that.
---
I mean the nuke doesn't really mean anything, you're high level and I presume you already beat the Queen
---
they're removing the *penalties*. Presumably, the buffs from consumables and the Well Fed/Well Hydrated benefits will stay.
---
Why? Because it's fun, gives massive amount of XP.
---
If you are salty because you are missing out, get an auto combat shotgun, and you are all set.
---
I agree with energy wep ammo.
---
Second function... Idk
---
Sure man, I just added you
---
There are ones that randomly drop, they have a different name though
---
I always get god roll black powder weapons.
---
I am just a bit disappointed that we couldn't kill the Queen, it took a lot of Stimpaks (for myself and to revive others) and ammo but I'm still happy
---
You do us a favor to not watch 30 minutes lol
---
Yes, you get to look around and also hide better.
---
You can pa glitch through almost anything.
---
That‚Äôs my specialty man. Are you on Xbox? Could probably hook you up... but yeah, bloodied, mutations, speed, and damage reduction are key priorities
---
Best weapons and lots of stims. If the sounds and visuals are overwhelming you then Im not too sure what you can do to counter that. I often take the headset off because the noise annoys me. Its always going to be a tough chaotic battle. Just run around, take out what bots you can, try and get a shot on the Imposter when its vulnerable. usually theres more than enough players to take it down so dont feel too bad if you hang back a bit and pick of the stray bots. The loot you get off the Imposter itself isnt all that special. Its the event drop itself that everyone really turns up for (the fixer plan). If you take a pylon then you are probably going to want to stay out of the battle as much as possible because the pylons themselves cause damage. Keep using a stimpack or some other health restorer (water or food, nuka quantums etc work well too) and keep an eye on your health bar.
---
I am on Xbox, no mic though
---
I've decided to go with a  B,10%WA, 90%RW handmade
---
Nice!! I did mine around 50. Was so tough. I think I died like 15 times hahaha. But now its easy peasy. You'll get the hang of the run and get better. :)
---
Yeah. Laser muskets have never been released into the game... never been obtainable by means other than dev room rats. 
---
Also I agree, gauss shotguns are actually broken. And I said plasmas because that‚Äôs what Bethesda said lol
---
So it's just about the next treat the Legendary run dishes out?
---
It's mindless.
---
Well its probably all the same number because its easier to have 1 texture that you only recolor
---
The "fuck up" scenario is one I'd be VERY surprised that Bethesda would do, I mean even by their recycling lazy standards that's poor.
---
The way I expect it to happen is somewhat akin to a combination between the Vault Tec DLC for Fallout 4 and the Wastelander's Raider quest you do with Weasel where she blows out walls to increase the area you can access. I'd expect it to be a massive resource sink where you have to do a bunch of quests, sink in a lot of junk and maybe caps/bullion expanding out the small area you'd start with.
---
I honestly don't see them going the void route. They're too precious about the "realism" of the game and keep removing things that are glitches but otherwise good features to be had in the game e.g. double-sided walls.
---
Oh, thats a relief!
---
TY! I generally only go if 3-5 other people are doing it.  I always play with my husband, and we've played it about 24 times, won it about half the time.  Last night we had only people under level 50 so it was absolute fucking chaos.  I have tons of stims, lots of good weapons, but it's just so much happening.  I do mute while doing the event unless someone is speaking on an open channel.  I am prob going to make some better power armor for the event too.  I probably should grab some better troubleshooter legendaries, I have 1 gun and 1 mr. Handy buzz saw which I don't use for this.
---
How is shooting fish in a barrel fun? There is no threat, no skill, no point. I have all the gear and materials I need. What I'd like is engaging opportunities to use them.
---
Yeah thats rough too. I think Ive been lucky. Ive never seen the SBQ go down super quickly at any SBQ's Ive attended. Theyve always lasted a decent enough time for everyone to get the damage requirement including the nuke dropper. Unfortunately theres always going to be the selfish element in any game. I honestly dont think the Legendary Run has helped there. Its made everyone super competitive for xp
---
Good one for all situations.
---
10\10, worth it!  If I had Reddit awards you'd get them all. I needed this comment today.  üíú
---
Bought one yesterday for 7.5k caps. Typically in the 8-9k at vendors but never had enough money.
---
Yeaaah,  it's all ruined.
---
I'm gonna make my own Line in the Sand with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget Line in the Sand.
---
So you're in good company then.
---
Yeah I'll keep it non auto and just use that to get attention and kill stuff I can't reach
---
Yeah fella done scorched earth many a time.
---
Ha. I have a teddy bear sitting at a grill drinking a beer and smoking a cigarette as one of mine.
---
Not really because on public teams people could easily grief
---
I'm casual as shit and am like 70 or so basically in line with Zorbo. Lost a week or two at the start to a new kid am will still finish.
---
You hard core peeps gonna be bored shitless for weeks now. Well done btw it must also feel good to be finished.
---
Every single time.
---
I knew what what was waiting for me so I took The Last Word and my Excavator power armor. Unfortunately I didn't think it was going to be that long and I ended up hitting robots with an Assaultron blade I picked up on one of them, but then it broke and I had to pick up another one. Ah good times, now I won't do this alone again. I made it, but it was kind of a pain in the fusion core.
---
There‚Äôs a day tripper spawn behind the building at the green country lodge near Flatwoods, it has a trolley with cans and a mini grill with hotdogs on right next to it
---
If you can manage it a set or at least a few pieces of troubleshooters armor is probably helpful too. I dont usually have too many problems but Im also usually taking at least one pylon and as such I avoid a lot of the battle. only taking out a few bots  here and there. I struggle to keep my health up otherwise. Ideally its one of the few events where I actually dont mind if some heavt hitters end it quickly. I know opinions will differ there and Im ok with that. But for me since I frequently take 2 or 3 pylons, the sooner its over the better. iI could care less about the imposter. Im there for the event loot and Ok with missing out on a 1* nocturnal wood left leg.
---
I just wish Radstorms created Nuked flora and let enemies drop fluids and masses. I'd be seeking them out instead of sheltering from them. 
---
I miss the glory days of WS getting nuked every minute. I've been trying to gather flux to build a decon shower on my alt for literally 2 weeks now, but these days the only spot getting nuked is the fissure and then everyone fights outside the zone so no luck farming there.
---
Seriously? How is everyone getting their flux these days? I spent literally 16 hours straight playing yesterday, and 12 hours solid the day before and nukes were going off every 10 minutes or so... but always sent to the bog. Nowhere else. 
---
Since the bog is lackluster on flux and fluids... how are people getting them these days?
---
It may never have affected you before but it's an old bug that hasn't properly been fixed.
---
Just need to work with it. I found that it usually goes away after a few days or so.
---
Thanks for info
---
Good point. Really doesn't make sense, especially when the assets are already there.  
---
They skim over some small and simple details that would make their *customers* very satisfied with their purchases. Hell, I'd buy more Pipboy skins if they came with unique light colours too!
---
That‚Äôs fine. If you DM me your name, I‚Äôm playing rn and could give you some bloody melee
---
So one of the better events is ruined so you can rush to something inferior?
---
What do they mean, mods are coming? Mods have been here for over a year?
---
Oh they mean official mods that they will charge money for. Right. Gotcha.
---
Put 1 mini nuke in there for 50 caps it will never sell and your camp will always be visible *taps head meme*
---
Im sold.. Looks like im heading back into Tamriel once i finish grinding the Wasteland
---
Still cool to have her fight alongside you somewhere in the world
---
Always run with a shotgun with the enforce perk if your running with an unarmed build. Scorchbeast you can shoot one time and cripple and force them to land, and shotgun shells are super easy to come by. If your running around with an automatic rifle might as well just run a bloody commando build and keep the unarmed weapons as your side weapon.
---
Could be something like "Hornwright Industrial Mining Company Model 1 Patent number 294688" ?
---
The color mods are in the game. The atom shop skins change the appearance of the armor, but have no effect on anything else. If you want red lights for the communist skin, you need to get the red lamp mod for whichever PA you‚Äôre using. The skins don‚Äôt come with mods. The skins are purely cosmetic.
---
Doesnt that just add HP to yourself?
---
Then you're good. I was just really happy to do it for the first time, especially after all these waves of robots. If you're an Enclave officer you can use a terminal to spawn a Cargobot and visit this website, [Nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/) to know the code of all three silos for the week.
---
That's what's mind boggling. Some of the most simple yet desired things are flat out ignored while they push out things no one wants.
---
It's a lot of fun. This time she got fixated on one of those drones carrying the nuclear key card and chased trying to shoot it down, but eventually she gave up due to attacking ghouls.
---
When she was fighting her way through Summersville, I went into stealth mode and just observed as she went from cover to cover killing everybody in town in the way back to Summersville lake.
---
I hope that becomes a thing, why buy skins if you cant show them off?
---
Fuck the cheat mods. I want them unofficial patches for this buggy game!!!
---
Sigh unzips
---
There are no headlamp mods for Excavator, Ultracite, Strangler Heart and T-65.
---
Pole hooks. If you‚Äôre on Xbox a BSS pole hook would be highly appreciated for a melee character. I got wiped (not just inventory, entire account including atoms *the day after they took money for s subscription I couldn‚Äôt use*) and I need to start over.
---
If not, the BSS pole hook and BSS super sledge have very little difference. There‚Äôs only a difference of 1750 base damage and 1850 to the pole hook and super sledge (running at my usual 19% health as shown in the PipBoy with five pieces of Unyielding).
---
I actually spend a good chunk of my time helping new people and farming stuff to give new people stuff but go off i guess
---
Try 'Hawke's Refuge' just on the south of the 'Berkeley Springs', you will see ants, bloodbugs, and two or three bloatflies instantly on the fast travel point
---
The best part is you don't have to go to the dead north, it's also near every other stuffs you need as well, the only bad part is you will miss the wendigo daily and the honeybeasts I guess
---
You will be hated by everyone who sees your low HP full of rads as it continues, even your family will give up on you soon enough, u wont even realize that and after some time, it ll be too late to fix that
---
fo76 doesnt requiere a lot of skill unless u want to solo sbq
---
And a Clear All Stored ghost camp budget function.
---
I'm going to try. It should also work with "buying ammo at 1c on player shops", right?
---
The last 4 times I've gone someone has tried to do it (I think), put their tent in the wrong spot and then they leave it there and nobody is able to trigger it.  Not sure if its intentional because of salty people like OP or they just big dumb dumbs.
---
Yes you move up exactly the same amount of xp, that being said if you in the higher levels it may seem like less because the cap to level is higher.  I am currently buying the 150 atom levels, since you break even, and trying to grind.
---
Wow. You pretty much need to get rid of all your armour, PA and weapons.
---
On my person I keep 1-3 weapons that I use at most and 1 set of armour and 2 sets of PA (Excavator for mining + combat one). In my mind, at best you should only have 1 utility weapon and 1 alt armour set, if that. Even the backup gear isn't necessary if it's taking up too much space. You won't use it often enough to warrant the space usage.
---
Same too with aid items. You should practically have zero except maybe for the rarest of chems.
---
Also be mindful of how much junk and ammo you have. Only keep larger amounts of high value high usage junk. By larger, I mean like 100-150 at most. The rest should be 50-100 or even less for really low value junk like bone or glass. 
---
Gunpowder is a big one too. Best to convert that to ammo asap. More efficient in terms of weight to have ammo vs the raw components to make ammo.
---
Just take all the stuff inside em and they‚Äôll disappear
---
Good idea.
---
it will be a miracle if 10% of this is implemented successfully
---
Those USSA troopers obviously don't fuck around...
---
Doing the event normally offers no threat, requires no skill and has the exact same point.....xp and rewards.  Unless you are level 30 or something your build has to be pretty bad for scorched to be a threat.
---
bffr 44 hits hard and fast and weighs lite with the short scope it can tag faraways easy, ammo is not hard to manage
---
Prob Tuesday when atomic shop updates
---
completing the event 'scorched earth' can give you one of each or just a random mixture of them
---
Having public teams has helped mitigate things a bit though. As long as a team mate gets a shot in on a legendary, usually you will be able to loot it (assuming the corpse doesnt just vaporise like they often do). I stopped caring about legendaries. If i can get a shot great. Otherwise maybe ill pick up some unexpected ones from team mate's kills
---
What do you expect bethesda know that most of their player base doesn't care for pvp. Why would they put effort into somthing only a small part of the player play?
---
Yes, I spawn in on top of 2 glowing mole miners and 2 can glowing mole rats. I also have 3-5 glowing radstags as I cross the road the the train station.
---
Interior ceilings...
---
so remove the MMO part from the MMO? what a dumb little shit you are
---
what makes you think, even for a goddamn second they won't try to charge people? what if they make it Workshop only mods that you have to pay for? or even atom only mods
---
you guys are all out here pretending you're modding an single player game when you have actual limitations put in place by Bethesda that'll stop you
---
the game wasn't even meant to be modded, they might say  they wanted it, but it would have been in already
---
I'm fucking telling you, you'll need a private server to mod
---
Thanks for giving me flashbacks to the days of logging in to unloaded weapons. Just a minor annoyance that only got me killed a handful of times.
---
yes
---
Do you play with friends or people you trust?  If so drop a bag with your stuff you like but don't use often and move it to an alt character.  I made a character for my legendaries to display and stow.
---
they did a stream yesterday where they said they were gonna add those shitty displays you petty naggy cunts want
---
Bethesda still wont patch the quest so people dong get robbed of their nuke. Thatd be another rage quit for me.
---
Granted it's not Dark Souls but being Bloodied at least requires an awareness of where your enemies are.
---
Check in trees and under water.  Not even kidding mine got stuck in a tree last time I dropped one.  üòÜü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I've yet to experience this oddly enough. And I got to every RR event.
---
I have like 180 of them and I need to use them.  I try to drop best flatwoods so lover levels can grab some loot too.
---
I just swap it to 10mm steal the ammo if I can then report them
---
No,  seriously just don't.
---
It's not the money, it's not worth the time.
---
yeah it's a reference to the fact that they just used one texture for all of them like a normal company would
---
Are they hackers? No. Are they exploiting a glitch? Yes.
---
It would be less of a issue if this quest wasn't directly blocking a currency. A currency that is required to get some of the best end game gear, which also takes a while to get enough if you were trying to get one of these sets.
---
This is just gonna make this timegate even more horrid for those that are now stopped because of a bug. People say it works on Private Worlds, but why would I have to reward Bethesda for something they could of prevented, had they tested their changes before bringing them to the live game. Whilst I know we aren't entitled anything, I do hope bethesda gives players some compensation for this unfortunate bug, even if it is just 100 Bullion.
---
cavalry revolver
---
I was thinking you could dig out the size of your shelter and even find caves and add walls like the vault dlc from fallout 4.
---
Definitely seems to be the case
---
Same, but I'm also selling toilet paper, and silly notes for 30k caps.  No one drops by my camp to buy, ever.  : (
---
I know they arent hackers just reddit made sure I had to use 18 characters for the title and I just put that
---
Must be nice not worrying about ammo
---
Yes, but that was/is based in the whitesprings bunker underground, not the resort above ground. (FYI you can still glitch into the presidential suite down there. Worth doing sometime when you‚Äôre bored.)
---
Perhaps you'd sooner the enemies died automatically, deposited all their materials to your stash and gave you double XP for simply witnessing the event?
---
Ohhh thanks so what does Ops stand for?
---
I‚Äôm a low level and I farm water, I max out the 1400 caps every day within an hour just farming 10 large purifiers at a workshop, haven‚Äôt gotten to that point yet
---
Dude they just said recently they're working on it.
---
It's a non-trivial thing to sort out because it'd hit performance hard to have to dynamically render 7-9 different models (5 armour pieces + hat + maybe a backpack and underarmour + the stand itself) PER stand.
---
I don't worry about ammo. Gauss shotgun is very efficient
---
Judging by the counter arguments I fear so.
---
I've not experienced this lag y'all keep talking about
---
It used to be so much worse, caps were maxed at 200 each per faction and you spent about 200 caps just to travel to sell to them all.
---
True
---
I need a solo build legendary perk
---
It‚Äôs not meant to be the only weapon you use and it‚Äôs intentionally so costly  with ammo. It needs to have a drawback due to the incredible performance of the weapon. But to your point, I traded a weapon or two on the market for a big pile of stable crimson.
---
STeel cork and anything else we need to collect
---
I should have read the patch notes. I been furiously getting annoyed about not being able to snap things into locations
---
It's hard to make good &amp; interesting camps without this
---
It's worse than that. All they care about minimising time spent getting XP, not just for the legendary run but also in prep for legendary perks later one in the year.
---
Why do you think that people are PISSED that they can't cripple the SBQ and finish the fight in a few minutes rather than 10-15 as it currently stands and what a lot of people might expect from an end-game level boss fight.
---
It drains your AP quickly if you push down the jetpack button (space bar or whatever if you're on console) even if you have 30+ agi.
---
&gt;petty naggy cunts want
---
? Just build a shack or don't build a balcony you knaggy cunt.
---
If you want ammo neither the converter nor ammo factory are the quickest.
---
Best way is trading sub, you get 10k of whatever ammo in about 5 mins for 7 to 8k caps usually, caps are not much use for anything else late game:-)
---
Do you have private? I'd just run whitesprings alone.
---
I'd like to be able to join events without being driven into a slide show by the ash piles.
---
Your turn!
---
after 1k hours of playing it doesnt require anything. it all depends on ur gear and if u use legal cheats as v.a.t.s. 
---
Dark Souls yeah.. it is all about ur skill
---
You will definitely get $20 worth of Fallout enjoyment out of 76. I prefer Fallout 3 and 4, but it would be a mistake to miss this chapter.
---
Fusion and plasma ammo at a bare minimum. Probably some heavy ammo too. Some tech-based junk like circuit board.
---
I'd like to see the occasional energy weapon or fusion or plasma core but I think that'd be less likely.
---
Burn!
---
Ammo and scorched heads
---
I‚Äôm sure an awful lot of people have mistaken FO76 for Minecraft
---
&gt; A smart way to deal with this problem would be to have some sort of blueprint to prefab mechanic. The idea is to set multiple objects as a blueprint to lock in as one single set prefab. This would mean that once you‚Äôve locked it in as a prefab, you could no longer interact with the individual items within that prefab. It‚Äôd use one unit (or much lower amount) vs multiple units within the CAMP budget. 
---
The effort to do that would be insane and unpractical. It'd be more likely that Bethesda might make a few pre-stacked models and you just have to stick with that. 
---
The problem will more likely be solved by modders doing all that work because Bethesda cbf doing proper work on simple things right now, let one something that isn't game-critical.
---
I can make 8K 5.56 in about 15 mins and convert it into anything I want for free üòÇüëç
---
My camp has 12 large water purifiers and 10 small water purifiers. I‚Äôm a bit of a magpie and like shiny stuff, so I have electric signs and whatnot too.
---
This has (apparently) been in the game since beta.
---
All I want want from legendary perks is the capability to clear away the cards cluttering my deck.
---
I don't think modding will work the way you think it would.
---
It'll be like CC, absolutely controlled by Bethesda and sold back to us. The only free modding we'll ever get is what we currently have on PC, which are mostly UI mods and cosmetic mods that only you can see.
---
Is the tracker working for you? I‚Äôm looking at it and it says we‚Äôve donated no concrete, but surely that isn‚Äôt correct.
---
If events can be exploited for fast XP farming it will be. The whole game now is a bull rush for XP, people no longer play the game as much as play the numbers.
---
I really do wish that the damage stacked up, so each charge is around 94 and 20 charges is 1880 damage, but almost guaranteed to irradiate you to death
---
Bethesda hates the Enclave sorry
---
i hope they save chicago for an enclave dlc
---
I'd like it if they made it so that only the person who put the keycard in can trigger the recall.
---
I agree with your sentiment but it will never happen, this game is now a full on race for XP above anything else. Every event is just a massive onslaught of fire power to end it as fast as possible.
---
Pretty boring.
---
So longer and much more effort than simply buying it for caps then :-) Buying for caps is essentially free, they are given freely/so easy to come by and not used for anything else really. :-)
---
Awesome! I‚Äôll probably be on around 5pm (pst). What‚Äôs your PSN I‚Äôll send ya an invite if you‚Äôre playing.
---
I go to all the defense public events I see. I‚Äôve had quite a few people hide from me and/or take a super wary stance despite me emote gesticulating like a 14 year old girl.
---
It relates to the duper‚Äôs. HMC....Hammer Must Crush. 1294688 is how many they suspended pending the ‚Äòinvestigation‚Äô. Once done the final equation is what u see. Hammer Must Crush 1.  The rest all reinstated with a ‚Äòwarning‚Äô
---
Not if you don‚Äôt use a ridiculously OP build and weapon with 382837193828847393728372928387387283 damage per second... ^/s
---
&gt;Like if we pre ordered the game shouldnt we automatically get fallout 1st for free? 
---
Why? You paid for what you got at launch. Why would they give you free shit as big as Fallout 1st?
---
It's even worse because you had the whole beta to know that you were a sucker for pre-ordering. It wasn't like Bethesda was hiding how much of a mess the game was at launch. You should have done the smart thing a bunch of people did at that time and cancelled their preorder. 
---
You don't get a prize for being loyal/stupid for sticking with the preorder and later on with the rest of the game up until now. 
---
Anyhow, we got that prize. It was the mountain scout armour. That was your loyalty thank you gift.
---
Anti armour
---
They manually updating it
---
When the atom shop resets
---
Hey, I‚Äôd be all on board for locations from Fallout 3, absolutely. Fallout 4 is just too recent for me to be interested in seeing that area again.
---
Actually Fed76 says quad is the best effect to have on an assaultron head, even more so than bloodied apparently. It gains damage the more you charge it, and being quad it‚Äôll let you charge it up four times as much, so a quad assaultron head basically has quad damage.
---
üòÇ
---
They said yesterday if you tuned into quakecon. They said a lot actually about camp stuff
---
Cork. Steel concrete etc
---
That amount of times I turn myself to goo is hilarious
---
I also use a bloody handmade, but full auto.  I use it infrequently enough that I hardly ever use more ammo than I pick up.  I also put three points into PER for +30% damage, and swap that for glow sight or lockpocking as needed.
---
I'm grinding to the the gauss minigun is the shotgun better?
---
Wouldn't it be preferable for new players to experience the event how it was intended?
---
Absolutely agree! I never pass up the opportunity to tag along with anyone who wants company on that quest. The photo opportunities are too good. :)
---
Iam using a TSE Gatling Gun with PA and it does make enough damage.
---
Why?  That‚Äôs what lots of people grind who would just blast through the daily‚Äôs. Yesterday took me 30 minutes including the ten spent in NW over two games.
---
Can we call that an event? A box we run up to and click a button  few times.... :-)
---
You kinda sound like Lancelot from Fate Grand Order who is constantly sad because his daughter hates him... ha ha
---
I think this emote is called "text chat" and yes, we need it
---
More time to farm XP as that is all this game is about now, the atmosphere and lore has gone out the window, this is not Fallout 4.
---
I get the repairs because everyone has to maintain their gear.
---
But why do you need enough junk to do weapon and armor crafting?
---
Are you still leveling and are below like 50 or so?  Do you sell the armor to vendors.
---
I just don't understand why you'd need to craft weapons and armor enough to need to do junk runs specifically for it?
---
Keep in mind I'm not hating or mad or whatever, I'm just genuinely curious as to why and what you're crafting all that armor and weapons?
---
Yes, much more powerful and way less ammo used, if you get magic effect on it or on your armour already then itll also 1 shot most things at sniper rifle distances in VATS :-)
---
Same thing happened to my wife.
---
I wish I still had my Fallout 76 Beta hat. I lost it when the full game came out and asked for an atom refund instead
---
I love the gatling gun but it's not a top tier weapon. It's just an efficient one.
---
Your suggest mod is to use Power Armour and get the Stabliized perk. I assume you already have the heavy weapon perks, Bloody Mess, One Gun Army and Adrenaline.
---
Also if you want to boost damage go the low health damage package with Adrenal Reaction and Nerd Rage as well as damage boosting chems.
---
However, don't expect it to perform like higher tier weapons like the Ultracite Gatling or Gauss Mini.
---
ULR have a faster fire rate, so with a legendary effect that works specifically on fire rate (Vampires) ULR‚Äôs can be better than normal
---
I would love to explore Canada!! maybe we are transported to Vancouver to fight Chinese troops as part of the annexation of Canada!!
---
Are mods still coming?
---
It's been a long time since mods were announced "for the future" and since then the game has changed a lot.  It started out as more of a classic fallout experience and has become a more heavily monetized mmo style.  I don't see it happening.
---
Ah sorry man
---
I‚Äôve got one playing drums on a saucepan
---
Ah sweet cheers
---
What's a magic affect? Grinding for the bullion is kicking my ass I've been trying to get the secret service armor and then I'm gonna have to grind more the mini gun plans and the mods
---
Doesn't help, tried it, lag just stays there only jumping to different location released me from the lag
---
Too much of a performance hit. It's not cheap (in terms of server load) to dynamically load in like 6-7 models. Per stand.
---
My friend does but neither of us can launch yet. 
---
I just came back after a year and was focused on the Wastelanders/ally missions and I'm just now getting to Belly of the Beast.
---
I heard they nerfed WS and that's why it's not nuked anymore but that was just removing the respawing legendaries right? The old mobs will still swarm I suspect and be good farming for fluids/masses.
---
Can we just take a second to ponder how stupid the idea of fighting with other players over workshops is? 
---
Say the ammo factory for example, you need ammo, you get into an hour long fight with some dude that already owns it, he logs off or rage quits and the workshop is yours for the taking. However... you definitely used way more ammo taking the workshop from some other player than you would ever get back from it. 
---
I just don‚Äôt see how this PVP workshop system is worth it. Seems the only way to benefit from workshops is to take them in a private world where nobody can mess with you, then go AFK or something.
---
Nah man, we just gonna run all up in this beotch and click on shit till it fails, bruh.
---
Don't you know how online gaming works!
---
So they just haven‚Äôt updated it yet 2 days into the concrete run? That seems a little odd...
---
If that's the case I wont feel as bad for not getting all the items cause I havent had time, but to be fair the only things I would really want from the season is the space wallpaper and the gatling gun skin
---
Yes thats right
---
Have you got a two shot explosive mini gun?
---
Well you can have a garden inside a house....so there's that
---
Yet they‚Äôre in the game already, you can mod miner helmets to do different colours.
---
That does work , Is it good with the atx greenhouse ? I would pay if it did
---
&gt; They‚Äôve acknowledged it which is good, it means they‚Äôre aware, and it‚Äôll take time to fix it. 
---
You say time to fix as if it's a difficult problem to solve. It's trivial. You just remove the conditions in the code looking for the other items. It's a day's work including testing (which they never do anyhow) max. Heck, you could just revert the change. That takes even less time!
---
&gt; There‚Äôs lots of other quests you can do in the meantime while they work it out. 
---
This is even more galling. 
---
If it were a side quest or small event, whatever. It's a critical quest you need to do in order to progress in the main quest.
---
It's such a smooth-brained response.
---
Bethesda should have this hotfixed asap. Not by next patch. Days at most.
---
I, a normal citizen and totally not part of the BOS, will take some of this 100% real cake... also maybe you got some secret power armor plans you might have laying around?
---
The Ammo Converter is what happens when you task engineers/programmers to design UIs. The Ammo Converter is prime example of why you just DON'T do this.
---
In my opinion there a waste of gold, i bought them, added them to my base and was disapointed with what you could plant in them, if you could plant flower's id put them back in!! now all my goard and corn is planted around the edge of camp.
---
Did you buy the account or something?
---
Just not sure how you could fail to remember having every PA. 
---
Regardless, as others have stated the Ultracite one is a gift for finishing Belly of the Beast. If you have it, you should also have the ability to craft them.
---
They "nerfed" whitesprings in the sense that they slowed down spawns, the spawn reset, and amount of legendaries. It does "okay" in gathering flux materials. Id almost imagine its still the best spot for flux materials.
---
Ah ok ! , Might have to skip out on this one then , I was thinking ss helmet or this
---
In real life you‚Äôd be much more scared of the guy with a chainsaw than the guy with a sledgehammer for a reason.
---
There is that i guess
---
Lol no way?! I just sold one at my vendor for 225 caps...
---
Ive seen this regularly. Sometimes you see soldiers, a soldier and a scientist and a couple of ex vault dwellers pondering life. There are a few other nocs too, some of whom you can interact with - such as a couple debating whether to g to crater or foundation. You can help them decide.
---
They are all new random encounters that arrived with Wastelanders. 
---
This spot is also pretty good for finding the scavenger merchant that sells the clothes, including the rarer stuff like hunters long coat that the Charleston vendor bot sells.
---
They‚Äôve been in since wastelanders. It‚Äôs a random encounter but they don‚Äôt talk back
---
&gt; "Fallout Shelters" is the new CAMP instancing feature, they're experimenting with reducing the limitations of building, not just the budget but where to place your items. "You can go nuts"
---
They do this and I'll resub to FO1st.
---
It's been 3 months since Wastelanders so why still make it this hard after this long?
---
Thanks for the offer but I'm PS4. My goal for the week now is getting to the point I can start launching my own again.
---
Just my two pennies worth, as above a garden in your house is cool, but if id thought about it more i would of gone straight for the ss armour.
---
Is this todays shop?... I am in need of this... I was hopin theyd release the red varient
---
From what the info i have gathered the minigun eats your ammo and you'lll spend a lot of time either buying or grinding the mats to make 2mm ec. 
---
During a queen fight if i use more than 300 rounds i'd be surprised. 
---
Minigun is more reliable though. You aim your gun and pull the trigger and bullets hit your target. With the shotgun it does what it wants. It is a strong independent woman. Once you get used to the wacky antics of the shotgun though it's wizard.
---
I'm alternating between a B33250 Black Powder Pistol and a BE25 10mm SMG. I have a B3315R M79 grenade launcher for *certain event* as well.
---
Honestly, whatever you feel like - especially if it has decent range when modded. If you use VATS and it lacks range, go for the +33% VATS chance for that second star. If consuming heaps ammo bothers you, then go for a hard hitter with a low fire rate cos it's only for the purpose of tagging enemies anyway.
---
Ammo rare???
---
You must be low levelled. Ammo is far from rare. 
---
Bug issues aside, if you're finding that you're needing to drop a ton of ammo into a single enemy, they're too high levelled for you to take on and maybe consider working on your build or getting a better weapon before continuing.
---
legit the best idea bethesda ever had
---
I get the limits are to make you play the game longer but there's a difference in making the game twice as long (like most games) to making it take 10x as long
---
Super Mutant Tears
---
They last an hour IIRC. I don‚Äôt use the often
---
&gt;I'm sure they did it like they did because they fear more exploits.
---
This is exactly why they did it like it is. The simpler version would use containers, but containers are notoriously easy to exploit for duping (due to the crappy, spaghetti code engine this game was shoehorned into). So they designed it without containers.
---
That's not necessarily a bad thing but the UI they stuck us with in the terminal of the device would get a first year design student kicked out of class, it's that bad. It's what happens when you have engineers design UI.
---
It‚Äôs pretty cool, though might have the tiniest fire I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
it's not like the fish happens every single time you do the event. Even when i've tried to make it happen it sometimes doesn't
---
Then don't expect mods to really exist
---
one hour, same as bobbleheads
---
I still haven‚Äôt spend the gold i have yet , But i am considering getting the ss
---
Yeah. I'm gonna use a  B,10%WA, 90%RW handmade
---
*Shoves power armor plans under the table* Noooooo. no power armor secret plans here, just  clearly this 100% real cake with no strings or serums attached.
---
and i get where you‚Äòre coming from too, but i can only excuse myself by being german. we swear as much as the irish. no hard feelings, hopefully. :) but i‚Äòve noticed that beth is more willing to listen when people are riled up, just speaking from experience.
---
Usually an hour unless you have the perk to boost it.
---
Never used mags personally. Never found the need for it as you can do plenty fine without them.
---
Nah it's just a screenshot from the video. I'm also waiting for it to come back.
---
You took the words straight out of my mouth! I run a BE Gatling with power armor (all the propper perks of course) and typically 1 shot most creatures, minus larger ones or lengendary.
---
Best described/demonstrated here:
---
https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
If I had to guess... hornewright mining company
---
I am on ps4 so maybe I did help you. Unfortunately there will never be a way to know for sure.
---
When people returned, why didn't they go in the resort? It seems like such an obvious place to go.
---
*sigh
---
Oh well... looks like im gunna have to wait a little bit longer to bring communist freedom to the wasteland
---
^^ this is very true. One optimistic way of looking at it would be that bethesda hires modders from the fo4 community. Meaning that there might actually be a day when there are competent and knowledgeable people working on the game.
---
But the cynical and realistic way of looking at it is that bethesda is going to make even more money off our poor asses. Just like what you said :/
---
What time and effort? Legendaries are handed to you in this game. You get script from everything. 0*10 is still 0.
---
I dont know if anyone else has managed to do this, but you can clip dirt tiles into each other after placing plants so you can have all of your crops on a single tile.
---
I had the issue right after the patch but it seemed to have cleared up for me yesterday. I did a bugged line in the sand and there are ash and meat piles but no lag. I didn't get a chance to do uranium fever which had been there worst for me.
---
This is really, really promising: imagine drinking Nukashine and being transported to weird alien structures. Also fallout shelters, who knows what kind of stuff will players be able to build without several of the limitations
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be difficult to give us Appalachia + DC + Boston in an almost contiguous map.
---
This seems good !
---
they might have been cocky bloodied builds
---
I keep hearing this but nothing is written on screen when in camera mode - is this in a setting? (PC)?
---
Since his gun is aa stabilzed wont add a ton. Maybe an extra 12% damage
---
Thank You kind sir your cake was most enjoyable. I, a normal citizen and totally not a member of the BOS, will casually be on my way. *Gestures toward his shoe then bends down to tie it, leaving a fold labeled "Top Secret Coordinates To Alien Crash Site" on the floor* Have a nice day.
---
The only weapons in my stash are my 'old faithfuls' that I journeyed with for 10 levels or more. Except now they're not 'in' my stash as they are on my walls. 
---
I scrip anything I'm not going to immediately start using unless it's something I can't use level wise but will upon reaching that level. 
---
I don't have any armor in my stash, unless it's a higher level piece I'm waiting to transition to. I'll store legendaries but once I hit 800lbs I go sell it all. 
---
No weapons, no armor and only select meds like Stims and Radaway. No mods and all ores smelted as soon as I get them. 
---
Yet my stash stays hovering around 703lbs just from all the junk. Even after bulking! I ended up just selling all my bulk coal and asbestos yesterday as I realized I had no use for the 100+ of each I  was storing for no reason. 
---
That said, seeing that 843 loose screws still warms my heart after my main struggled so mightily to amass them.
---
I mean if you winnin... you winnin son
---
Yes same, I thought it was weird it only asked for ghoul sample when it should be 3 different ones...
---
You and me both, I like to go to vendors that got 200 odd plans. So that when I do spend caps on fast travel, I hope to find at least 1 plan that is decently priced. It was all worth it as long as I find 1 plan, I didn't know.
---
90% of the time this just results in me looking at 300 Mounted Tick plans.
---
Yep who cares man kill em. No honor in the wasteland to be spared
---
Ounce of prevention quest still broken!!!!!!
---
I mean you‚Äôll likely never see them again. Kill them take their stuff, jump servers.
---
*Tosses a fork on the ground to have a reason to bend over* OH , CLUMSY ME ! *Bends over, picking up the fork and the folder labeled* *"Top Secret Coordinates To Alien Crash Site".* Glad you enjoyed the cake, have a nice day !
---
&gt; \^ this is very true. One optimistic way of looking at it would be that bethesda hires modders from the fo4 community. 
---
Oh no, I guarantee that'll be the case. 
---
It's not even an optimistic view. Why would Bethesda waste its own resources when it can leverage someone else's work and get their cut for practically nothing? Of course they're going to do that. The majority of CC right now was built that way. I except nothing but the same.
---
Though I probably have a somewhat biased perspective, I don't think you could earnestly say that Bethesda's profiteering is a cynical point of view. We've all seen the evidence of it. It's just a statement of fact.
---
I get where he was coming from,he created the BoS to safeguard technology from misuse and nuking America would certainly seem like misuse.But I‚Äôd much rather nuke a piece of worthless land than send my own men to die.But for Maxson the safeguard technology cause of the Brotherhood is apparently worth more than the lives of his subordinates.That‚Äôs my problem with him and the brotherhood,they are blinded by their codex and moral values.
---
That‚Äôs what I like about Maxson from F4,he don‚Äôt give a shit.He does what seems right to him,he makes his soldiers fight not for the Brotherhood‚Äôs values,but for the brotherhood itself.
---
Seeing how people here complain about vats not working with guns in PVP I think you are fine
---
You guys finished already? Man im only at lvl 64, doubting if its even possible for me to reach the end...
---
Well I‚Äôve leveled up 275 times since wastelanders came out, and this is the first time I‚Äôve ever encountered them. I‚Äôve seen plenty of scavengers and others(can‚Äôt remember which ones) just never ‚Äúsoldier‚Äù.. I figured it had something to do with the newest update.
---
Lol.
---
I guess not, sorry. I will check it later and reply.
---
This happens with my lever action sometimes. What's funny is that sometimes when it comes back it will have a magazine size of 999.
---
They already said they are probably going to remove the penalty for hunger and thrust themselves
---
That doesn't take longer than a trade. Trading involves putting up an ad, waiting for someone to respond, working out a price, adding them, waiting for them to join your world etc. etc. When l can make my own without needing anyone else. I have it set up on an alt account just in case, but I have tested it and if you place the machines on platforms you can move your camp then delete the blueprinted platforms and the ammo machines will not take up camp budget. Try it yourself. Many many people have told me that even though it's recently become massively popular, this glitch has been around since beta so I highly doubt it's going to suddenly get patched. Maybe do some research. üòÇ
---
Bloody Mess is 3 perk ranks for +15% damage boost. A 12% boost for a single card is a bargain.
---
I mean besides the cake and cookies last time we also have a kickers bunker with AC unlike the brotherhood who decided on an insane asylum.
---
You have to have the actual camera. Not picture mode
---
That wasn't his plan though, they less contact before the mission and it was taggerty choice  to go down into the mine. Maxson wanted them to use nukes.
---
I tend to waste all my caps on buying sprees when I do that so sure, a lot more fun at first but the day after.. My walk of shame is actually walking around again instead of being able to fast travel
---
I mean it seems superflous to use vats for melee anyhow but if it helps, who cares.
---
Yeah, that has happened a lot.
---
I'm wondering if its bugged. You have to wait, but ive waited 10 minutes +. Nevee takes that long
---
Those fixes might work, but why should the player reward Bethesda by subscribing to FO1st, for a bug they could have easily identified and fixed before releasing the patch? 
---
No hate towards you, as you are trying to help people with these issues. I appreciate the effort though.
---
Always make sure the sheepsquatch is in your range when taking the last pylon. (Assuming you‚Äôre tanking all 3 pylons and provided the card)
---
I don't need to try it, I literally see an ad in trading sub saying 10k 2mm for 8k caps, I post my IGN and it's done in 5 mins,  usually less. That lasts me for months, it's something I dont even think about for weeks and weeks until I notice I'm low, again topped in in 5 to 10 mins...try it :-)
---
I mean I do like the unofficial patches, but them themselves end up adding bugs in as well.
---
Hunting these is the true endgame lol. So far I've found them at Flatwoods as others have said, Mosstown in the building nearest the fissure, Morgantown at Super Duper Mart and ETA PSI house and US-13c Bivouac. Fasnacht bots will also collect them if you have one.
---
These are made in the chemistry bench under grenades.
---
I don't have anything close to a powerful build, and I've lost legendary corpses. Fighting a mob on a hillside with vegetation at night is almost guaranteed lost loot for me.
---
&gt; Is every event going to ruined in the name of farming?
---
Pretty much, yeah.
---
At least Line in the Sand completes correctly. Radiation Rumble is worse, because if people use it for nothing but farming, the event actually fails.
---
That 12 is with 3 points of stabilzed
---
Zoom in
---
I have 20k 10mm I got just from resetting the machines ü§£üëç I turned it into 4k flamer fuel. But hey if you still want to buy ammo I got you bro I'll sell you all the ammo you need üòâüòÜ
---
Are double walls being able to be built a glitch that they fixed or a feature they broke?
---
Operation
---
Can give you tons of plans for Ultracite armour- for free just tag me: leszekw83 on xbox
---
Also if we could press up or down on the d pad to cycle through each player vendor.
---
I said IF you have FO1st ..
---
IF you don‚Äôt just server hop and try to analyse the blood BEFORE adding the fuse. It will probably work.. if not try Bethesda‚Äôs suggested fix but the analyse then fuse worked for me.
---
Some believe it does more than that, allowing you to regen health back faster at times.
---
Because you need to hard work and crafting for 5 minutes of pew pew pew ;)
---
They should do it like the freighters in No Man's Sky.
---
Marginally improved poop remains poop
---
If you on PC I'll buy it, no problem, we both win.
---
I just like the Raiders style, I dont need to act like a dick bag myself :-)
---
I need grave stakes or something similar for every one of these tin bastards I bag n tag.
---
Damn. I get it not being purified water. For 500 Atoms though you think it would at least be boiled water
---
You'd be rewarding Bethesda for being lazy, if we did. They could have easily found this bug had they tried to do the quest ONCE after changing the requirements.
---
Oh crap. You're right. My bad. I have no idea why I thought Stabilized was 1 rank.
---
I renounce and reject my prior comment.
---
A full set of Troubleshooter's and preferably a rapid fire Vampire's weapon makes you able to tank all three pylons, the lasers and bombs which makes the Impostor Sheepsquatch die in a few seconds (it's quite squishy once the shield is down)
---
I dont recall that being the case. Taggerty suggested using nukes and Maxson freaked out about it. Mason was also about working with and training the locals but Taggerty, and other members, were somewhat elitist due to their military background and experience.
---
Better lose that raider tag son, meg would be ashamed üòπ
---
P.s, craft then scrap low level flamers, each one gives you 100 fuel, only burns up easy to come by mats...
---
thanks for that I know its only lead and steal but its the principle!!111 :)
---
Doesn't help that much
---
You sure it's not a subtle dig at the players like Arethra Franklin's song "Chain chain chain. Chain of fools" :)
---
I‚Äôm lvl 110 and still do junk runs, mostly to creat upgrades for the weapons I do get. Especially the new grass weapons and armour....I went through about 10000 materials items to craft till I got something I wanted. I also give back and will build armour and either drop it while out in the world ...like a Easter egg hunt...or sell it for cheep for leveling players
---
I was under the impression that Arthur Maxson, in 76, didnt sacrifice his people needlessly. Maxaon believed, perhaps too much, in his men and women while under estimating the threat.
---
I know right! And the red shift skin is based off the excavator PA but there are no headlamp mods for it!
---
That also crossed my mind haha
---
I had about 5 unclaimed levels of perks when I logged in yesterday. Used three to get super duper. Yeah, it rocks!
---
Ounce of Prevention got simplified down to require only a ghoul blood sample. In turn the terminal will no longer allow you to analyze the sample essentially locking you out of wastelanders and the rest of the original questline
---
Pretty sure they did have power armor OP, it was everywhere in the cave. Or are you referring to t60?
---
You have to completely respect your special and get many perks, it cost me over 40 levels to get the build I want.
---
Nevermind your right about the nukes. But it was her idea to venture into the caverns with a tiny squad. I guess youd rather trust someone who's gone through army training rather than some random person. Especially just after the bombs fell.
---
Yeah. It's an annoying issue.
---
I'd much rather it prioritised highlighting the event over people or even the location. Who wants to select a player over an event in that instance?
---
Telsa weapons and their ash piles reduce my game to a stuttering slide show, I just fast travel away or restart the game.
---
Ahh ok üëå
---
tefuq you mean frowned upon, just fucking kill the player with anything u got
---
I've been bloodied since day one. I lucked out and got one shot explosive bloodied quad ammo. I got it at lol 75 (now 217.) It hits like a bloody (pun) freight train. like everyone is saying "you are going to die a lot.". I also carry 10k bullets mines setup for sniping. 
---
(XBOX) shcurti
---
hit me up anytime I would love to help you out.
---
Not exactly try equipping power armor and it takes you to below the screen on the ammo converter,  people don't realize that the problem is the power armor and can just exit it.
---
Not an event just a holding place until something new arrives.
---
Yea i suppose. I think I really enjoy Arthur sr as a character in this bc he is such an idealist. I hope we can interact with him with dialogue even if it is through a radio.
---
Ok some of them did, not all of them tho
---
BoS is a mod. So you have to craft the armor first then mod it. 
---
BoS is for combat armor. So build some combat armor.
---
My only issues is the occasional crash.
---
They announced it yesterday.
---
I like the balloon mod they stand above everything and easy to see.
---
So you won't *have* to eat but the messages that you're "famished" or "thirsty" will still come up?
---
I just want a fully modifiable .223 pistol üëç
---
Use the s.p.e.c.i.a.l card Curator and the magazine effect will last twice as long

Worked the same way for me too thank you very much!!
---
Wall of text warning. TLDR at the bottom:
---
Outside of the raider sects, the three surviving factions were all leaning on each other to survive. If one fell, they all fell.
---
The Responders:  
---
Traded medical supplies and information to the BoS to weapons and ammunition.  
---
The Free States:  
---
Designed and began to put out early warning Scorched detection grids.  
---
The BoS:  
---
Fought as the main line of defense at the source.
---
The raiders went after the Responders any chance they got. Dumbass Rose ended up getting captured. David assumed her dead. Retaliated by wiping out the main Responders base by blowing the Charleston dam and wiping them out. Leaving only a few surviving groups. The largest left was at Morgantown Airport with no resupply from Charleston.  
---
This affected the BoS's medical supplies as the Responders became less willing to give of what they had left, and the BoS became increasingly aggressive in obtaining their supplies, causing high tension between them two factions.
---
David programed a Miss Nanny with a personality of Rose. Shortly after, they captured a Responder trying to make it to the Free States with information vital to programming their detection grid. He was tortured and killed.
---
With medical supplies dwindling, BoS began falling like dominoes and having to tighten up in the Bog, leaving Free States territory unprotected. The infection within Harpers Ferry spread like a wildfire through The Mire. When the Free Sates fell, so did the detection grid they were working on. Leaving the last surviving faction, the BoS, with Scorched on two sides.
---
With the Responders and Free States now extinct, and the BoS in retreat to Fort Defiance, the Scorched of the Forrest and The Mire flooded into the Savage Divide, wiping out the raider sects as they went. Sans the Diehards, who fled West Virginia to escape Davids stupidity.
---
In one final push to try stop the source, all that was left of the BoS still able to walk and carry a weapon, went into the Bog to triangulate the source and wipe it out. By the time they found it was the Glass Caverns, there were barely any soldiers left alive.  
---
They were hemorrhaging bodies the entire way to the back of the cavern. Taggerdy, and the couple of people left with her, fell there. And with them the last of humanity in West Virginia.
---
TLDR:  
---
Blame the raiders for the fall of Appalachia to the Scorched.
---
Whelp I'll just downvote myself then :)
---
I think they're were referring to how the game has quest markers on pretty much everything.
---
But that has nothing to do with this at all.
---
Was so hopeful one day we'd get raids back but this m instead it'll be a single mission. C'est la vie
---
I agree that there does feel like there should be a quest or SOMETHING at the Whitesprings (specifically in the hotel area)... but there was also something incredible about wandering through this hotel - perfectly preserved but empty. With giant empty rooms... I got lost a few times when I first stumbled across the Whitesprings in my early days. I liked discovering the story of the place, and I felt heartbroken for the people who had lived there and were getting kicked out. I'm definitely very torn on the idea of the Whitesprings. I would love to see more done with it but I would hate to lose that original feeling of just exploring a large, abandoned area and there being a MYSTERY of why it was empty.
---
Quit it‚Äôs a bad game
---
Hold my cosmo
---
So, does anyone have an idea of how long the reset timers are without server hopping? I suspect that it‚Äôs around 2.5 to 3 hours of actively playing in real-time, but I haven‚Äôt been able to really sit and rest it without getting sidetracked by other players or IRL events. This is based off of seeing certain items respawn after I‚Äôve spent around that amount of time playing, but there may have been some server hopping going on (i.e. going from a private world to adventure). 
---
If one stays on a server, is there any data out there that tells us how long it take for items to respawn on that server?
---
I got mini gun first but I would‚Äôve went with the shotgun being it‚Äôs a millions time better
---
They said it's been a nightmare for devs and it's going to take a while, basically.
---
Im pretty sure the BOS Armours are paints/modifications for the Combat armour, if you dont have the plans the vendor in Harpers Ferry should sell them
---
I‚Äôm so fussed on the one wasteland. Does that mean I can no longer help lower levels run through higher level zones? And does that also mean that my junk runs in the forest will now lvl up to me?
---
Totally unrealistic of bethesda to think we can donate 150 million concrete which is harder to come by than steel then next week put the volume of cork up again there out of there tiny minds
---
Get as many %dmg reduction perks in your build, they will save your life.  
---
Other than that, you don't have to be afraid since you mostly will one shot most enemies most of the times, be fast and kill them before they see you.
---
You will
---
It's more of a catch-22 then ironic
---
They haven‚Äôt explained more
---
None of the suggested fixes work for me however:
---
I try to analyze first, nothing;
---
I try to put the fuse in, server hop, analyze, nothing;
---
Besides, everytime I server hop, it puts the T-Fuse back in to my inventory. None of the fixes work. 
---
It's a gamebreaking mess, that is stopping new players from reaching the Bullion grind for end game gear. Gear that BETHESDA decided to timegate like some f2p mobile game.
---
Had they actually tried to not be lazy and tried the quest once before releasing it, they could have delayed the "fix".
---
In the Ash Heap, I came across a hole  that normally spews flames. Hurts if you get to close. Probably know what I'm talking about.
---
Well, this one was special. It was sprewing out O's. I shit you not. A nice perfect sphere of white letter O's as particles hosing out of the ground tanking my FPS any time it was on screen.
---
Just... wut?
---
It's not teslas it's meatpiles.  We have tested this on private servers with all of our group using no energy weapons and you still get the insane lag and fps drop with enough meatpiles.  Please stop spreading this.
---
If you're still looking for one I'm on PC and have one I was going to use but never seem to actually use. PM me if you want it. I won't be on for about an hour and a half from now though
---
u/LadyDevann 
---
Just letting you know how large of an issue this is and that it's affecting every platform.
---
Yesnt
---
If they are adding instanced camps I better get a way to fast travel inside.. Really not looking for two loading screens every time I wanna use my camp otherwise I feel like most people will just put the usefull stuff outside and the instanced part will become a ghost shanty they only visit to take pictures for reddit.
---
You just have to find a server where it hasn‚Äôt been done yet, or just do other quests until they post the hotfix
---
I have 2, 1 wasn‚Äôt enough for what I had, max turrets, max lights, 4 vending machines 2 extractor 10 water pumps
---
[for reference](https://imgur.com/a/bHvi5y5)
---
Its classed as a higher tier ammo type, harder to find, less to craft at once, and unavailable in ammo factories, your best bet is to claim the steel yard and place the Lead extractor alongside the steel ones, and try and make use of any other lead extractors at workshops and a camp if your near one
---
Prove it.
---
Because people are finishing the season really early and so you are more likely to buy ranks Is what I think they we getting at.
---
Think it's modeled after the converted munitions plant which doesn't make 2mm either.

That happened to me yesterday but for some reason while running towards her I suddenly got the Legend pop up. Others stopped dead in their tracks so I'm assuming they did as well.
---
I use a vampires explosive as my main weapon but i am a full health power armor build. It‚Äôs really efficient with ammo and with the exception of encrypted I can‚Äôt remember the last time I died.
---
The amount of times I have to take 2 or 3 pylons when I join one of these without my usual crew is ridiculous. You need the pylons, man.
---
Monthly period!
---
Actually, it is quite complicated to use pvp melee *without* vats, as the hit detection is, well, abysmal. If you're chasing people through workshops, they are probably jumping a lot while you are running; good vats timing is crucial, as the AP bar (at least for me) drains extremely fast.

Fuck the raiders: all my homies hate the rich

You can unlock mods by crafting and scrapping weapons and armor. I spent a lot of caps on plans for certain weapons solely just to build and scrap them for mods. It‚Äôs cheaper in the long run than buying mods and mod plans from vendors and easier than doing events or farming spawn locations for the plans
---
For the stuff at the end?  I wouldn‚Äôt spend atoms on that. I just do daily and weekly. Not all the nw events and play a bit at weekends I‚Äôm rank 80 so not sure how much of a difference it really makes.
---
They are a mod for combat armor. Need a piece of combat armor first.
---
Bethesda: "Woah woah, slow down....this is a game?"
---
I'm a new player with only a couple ranks into this board game. Should I worry about getting as many ranks as possible right now or not worry about it? Are subsequent 'seasons' similar, when does the next one start?
---
Yeah I tried bow for five seconds over the weekend. I put away the Fixer and HM I have and went full Katniss....
---
Took on three ticks, used five arrows at painfully medium range, only got two arrows back and promptly left the bow in a bag near Foundation without even so much as a single Mocking Jay whistle.
---
Utter garbage weapon. I wouldn't bother to experiment any further as I could see how I'd go in a a full blown shit fight.
---
I think there is plenty of that stuff already
---
You think 3 months is a long time?
---
Funny thing, that statement from ItsFuzed, who is/was big into handmade VATS :))
---
My anecdotal is that in events with no ash piles I get normal play and no lag, if there are ash piles my game becomes a slide show.
---
Just my experience.
---
Side note here, the target always hangs by the furthest pylon when not aggro - so usually grab that one last
---
I can dk the same thing selling assault rifles from super mutants.  Usually faster than 30 min tbh.
---
The cake is a lie...
---
&gt;Please stop spreading this.
---
It is true for me regardless of you and your team. I play on PC is that the issue?
---
My ally's nickname is 'SAlly cos this game is so god damn laggy üòÇ
---
I'd rather have something that isn't used for anything else :)
---
Thank you for sharing your story. It must've been hard to live through it and still difficult to talk about it. I'm glad you found that motivation to keep you going. Your life is just as valuable and important as others' because of the positive impacts you can and will have on people around you. Be it in real life or virtual ones. Keep on playing!!!
---
Whatever you do don't feed them your atoms and cash. You'll buy better atom store content than the board pays out imo. 
---
I'd play casually if I was you, don't go too crazy as in all honesty the majority isn't worth it.
---
Don't quote me on it but we have a couple weeks left I believe. 3 or 4? It's based on Zorbos ship location which is about five places into the last green segment of the board. You could easily clear all of the first section (red?) at a minimum as it takes less SCORE per tile.
---
If you need a bit more lead sludge works and hornwright estate have lead weights
---
This 'event' is a material sink pure and simple, the 'rewards' are secondary.
---
We tried a lot of stuff on Friday, we did lots of events like LITS, RR, guided meditation etc. With no energy weapons and with teslas and lasers and plasmas and each time the lag and frame drop did not occur until the piles accumulated.   
---
We also tried all standing in a circle (4 of us) and fired auto ffr teslas at the ground and no one got any significant frame loss.
---
Which platform are you on?  PC?
---
Victory
---
idk we are all on xbox with mostly the same hardware specs except the different between a one x and a one s so it would make sense that all of our games are behaving the same.
---
8pm for the dailies, every Monday for Smuley
---
You know, I seldom agree with Narathi. But time...
---
Deactivate all mods, delete the String-dir, and to a scan &amp; repair.
---
I assumed they used the terminal interface to cut down on dupers.
---
This could have been an amazing questline for a game. One where everything failed and you had to go back into the vault.
---
I'll just wait, I tried it roughly 30 times. Guess I'll just hope they give some Bullion after not being able to grind it.
---
Sorry for venting to you mate, I know there isn't much you can do. Thank you for the effort though.
---
It‚Äôs the weekend. And since is manual, you won‚Äôt get an update until Monday unfortunately.
---
Thank you, but what Timezone are you referring to? I‚Äôm on AWST time.
---
Don‚Äôt waste your time. I expended countless fusion and plasma cores for a 1-star piece of garbage. Fight took 15 minutes with several random people. Also since it‚Äôs not an event, everytime you snag another player with a bullet you get the ‚Äúinitiate combat‚Äù warning. I saw a second one yesterday, kept walking.
---
I hate that damn thing.
---
I have 400 grenade launcher ammos and it fails whenever I try to do the bulk. The Converter sucks.
---
Hmm, maybe the regen is % based so it gives more each time it regens because you have a bigger health bar?
---
I have one on top of my garage mostly for decoration but it powers some lights and stuff. Then another one powering my water purifiers and shops. It's overkill but they look a lot nicer than any other generator.

Once I built my bloodied gauss minigun I set out to stock up on flux before using it, I farmed it conventionally, but more importantly I visited every high level players camp who had junk for sale, sometimes you‚Äôll find someone selling 2 sometimes 5 occasionally someone will be selling 50 crimson flux. Once I had 200 I started using the gun, but I still only whip it out in queen fights / comparable fights. That way I‚Äôve been able to stay near 150-200 flux at all times.
---
Someone on ps4 who can help me with this?

I you're doing heavy weapons outside PA (and why not), Formula P is pretty great, actually.

I‚Äôve seen some great videos of people using bows and doing excellent damage .. but I just can‚Äôt get it to work for me in VATs .. tried all th3 suggested methods.. fully charge the bow first, in out in VATS nothing seems to get me consistent kills in VATs.
---
Ditched it for now and going shotgun
---
It also needs an Exit option so if you have spent 10 minutes selling spare ammo you don't have to spend another 10 backing up through every step you made to quit. That's crazy and very bad user interface design.

Can someone help me with the revive quest? pS4

Weasel and Biv should be companions, it's a total injustice that they're not.

There is!  Long press the back button.. same as every terminal in the game :)
---
VATS gives you a "leaping" attack at a certain distance from your enemy, give or take 5-10 feet. Youll close the gap if you attack within that distance.. lock on with VATS then hit the attack button once that 95% pops up. I use it to PA Sprint Jump into the most concentrated parts of the battle and use VATS to lock on then air smash targets to land. I was hoping there would be  legendary perk that would increase the distance... but oh well, the Devs all have boners for bloodied builds.

Lol he kept linking his YouTube account with 400 subs like that meant anything to anyone haha

As a herbivore they are excellent .. all your daily food in one place

2800 hours playing this sometimes frustrating, often broken, but compelling game and I didn't know? Thank you! ü§ì

Ah your a herbivore, can you tell me the upsides to it ?
---
Oh nice! 
---
Need it only once, only for the pathfinder quest :/
---
Pvp is good for you.  It can make you better at the game.  There are ways to prepare and most important stash you junk before pvp.
---
I did both, using two characters.
---
Raiders, in my opinion, have a better storyline and the best ally rewards (the Gauss Minigun).
---
Though, I would recommend alternating quests until you get to the mutual decision point, so you get the Chinese Stealthsuit from the settlers.
---
Since you can ultimately grind for ally rep on both sides, it‚Äôs your choice.
---
Actually some online games have two or more difficulties or modes to offer.
---
in fo76 it could be a mode for players like u with markers, easy to kill mobs, a f\*\*\*ing simulator of two buttons aka V.A.T.S. and whatever makes a n000b happy.
---
and a survival mode with no markers, no autoaim, difficult pve, some real challenges like if u die u cant spawn at the same place and u cant ft withing 5 mins or so. but of course we should have a 3\* loot for 3\* legendary.
---
As for now is a f\*\*king arcade. I like the game a lot but I wish it could be more challenging like survival mode of fo new vegas.
---
lets see if i got more downvotes than anyone else.
---
Most common camp/weapon/armor plans i sell for less than 20 caps. Very rarely do I sell plans for more than 100.
---
Just quickly claim the workshop and move on. Why would you hang around?
---
This doesn't require any materials to do, so it might be slow, but its automated and free. You just empty the ammo maker occasionally, then convert when you have a few minutes.
---
Did exactly this, both me and my friend. Didnt work, still just "error". Both on PC, one steam and one game pass edition
---
Ease of use!

Corn soup &amp; Razorgrain soup from your tiles

Then add brain fungus soup and cranberry relish

That gives you more AP refresh, xp &amp; health regen etc.
---
Then you can just sell all the meat which gives you a decent income from the vendors
---
Those prices sound generally quite expensive, except for the serums. Do you make many sales off those other plans or mods?
---
If I was on I'd give you a hand but I won't be on until tomorrow arvo. Holler if you don't get any hits I'll let you rez me.
---
Every plan I sell for 10 caps. I don't care what it is. They FLY out of my vendors.
---
May not seem like much but when someone buys all 40+ of what I have because it's such a deal? Makes good bank quickly.
---
Knowledge is power.
---
I've been avoiding Radiation Rumble some the update because of the meatpiles.
---
I keep hitting max caps
---
Accept the people who like to use workshops as ways to auto PvP aren‚Äôt interested in fair PvP.
---
We usually hold on to the ore til the end to milk the mobs but now we just get the ore in as quick as possible and end it for the event rewards.
---
Yeah it is...
---
Aren't light weight mini nukes grenades though? I saw a clip of them being a grenade.
---
The weight isn't that much of a problem with Ordnance Express ( That's why I got so many but moved them to alt not to take a perk slot) but it's not worth equipping with Fat Man being trash...
---
Did you actually craft it? They absolutely are different. The preview image is bugged.
---
Ah ok thanks, im gonna try this
---
LOL wow!!
---
It‚Äôs really accurate. I am rank 17 in NW and I think I have only successfully killed someone a handful of times. Usually I get a few shots in and then they go frog legs so I can‚Äôt get a bead on them and one of their buddies snipes me.
---
What level are you?
---
No any ranks. So they'd take it away so you're most likely to get behind and buy ranks.
---
Like I said I think that's what they're saying. I don't think they'll take it away.
---
Base off what I know you won‚Äôt really get 1000 gold from the settlers, but you can from the raiders, base off your build, if you use shotguns or like farming/base design, work with the setters, if you like making ammo at your base like at the converted ammo factory, or heavy weapons go for the raiders. Now I can be wrong with everything, because I don‚Äôt play much and most of this is from memory but I thinks this is the basic of everything I think. :)
---
I sold a radiation barrel plan at my camp for 10 caps, and a crocolosses backpack plan for 10 caps, the rad barrel is worth 10k and probably similar for the backpack, but i was just soam listing every plan i had for 10 caps and they got added, lol
---
I think is cool that you can put them upstairs, so you can make some cool kind of balcony
---
ouch
---
Check this video,out.. https://youtu.be/XvMSO23MeS4 it will get you started
---
I just left my house so no, but good to know they actually are different!
---
Since the patch there's a 50/50 chance when I fast travel to any event (full or empty) that the game shuts off and throws me all the way back to the console start screen.
---
Thanks !
---
Also useful if your camp location is on rocky ground, or mixed so that often plants won't place. 
---
Good if you want to pop some fences around your crops as they snap to the sides, as you would expect.
---
They are a replacement for both foundations (concrete and wood) and upper floors, so that provides some flexibility on where you plant. 
---
You can put a plant in place then switch the tile to a normal floor and the plant remains. I did this with a mutfruit to get a bush covering an awkward corner where nothing else would place. 
---
I've read that it's possible to place a pot in the same position and then swap the tile for a normal one so you end up with a potted plant. Haven't tried that myself yet.
---
No, no, you don't understand! Brotherhood bad! /s
---
Typically sell whatever i dont need/have excess of. That's mostly meds, magazines, grenades, and bobble heads all for 5c-10c individual. When i sell legendaries, I'll sell them for 25% of the suggested price.
---
Auto pvp?
---
This speaks to their need to hire some actual software developers and not just bodies to throw at the Creation Engine, because in the scheme of engineering problems, perk loadouts should be absolutely trivial.
---
If they can't get perk loadouts working, there's zero chance of them ever solving their deep seated technical problems with their current staff.
---
I only did Settler but I have a feeling that Raider is the best option for the final quest. I got to a point where I couldn't enter one of the rooms which clearly was setup for Ra Ra to enter.
---
I have a feeling that that is the room that has the unique plasma weapon is.
---
Unless you get it on a shotgun, then you have a "magic shotgun".
---
Doesn't work I'm afraid. Neither does the food processor from sunshine meadows
---
Number 2 made laugh. No surprise here tho. Internet is still treated as a luxury in the US when it clearly should be a utility. So now greedy telecoms nickel and dime everyone for shit connections. I'm all for capitalism but it needs to be watched carefully, otherwise we get 1megabit uploads for 40+GB uploads.
---
Oddly, I have tried selling plans for 10 caps and the selling rate didn‚Äôt go up very much.  Players are simply not impoverished.  If you have 20 thousand caps, the difference between 50 caps for 5 plans you don‚Äôt know and 500 caps isn‚Äôt really much.  And very few people want to buy plans to resell them.  At least that was my experience when selling stuff for very low amounts.  I might try it again soon.
---
If I don‚Äôt get to ride in a vertibird with a minigun like fallout 4 I will be extremely dissapointed
---
Thanks.
---
Thank you.
---
I've done this event at least 6 times, started it once and no fixer plans :(
---
After two years, I finally made a bloodied build last week.
---
It's all down hill from here guys. . .
---
Same, seems almost everytime i go to this event its me and me alone who is actually bothering to tame the pylons, and no one gets you up when you go down either, you have to die, respawn then go and collect all 3 pylons alone again
---
I like to run a low level character ( below 20 ) and pvp and take on high level characters at workshops.  
---
    It's a good challenge. No transferred gear just what I come upon.  It's a lot of fun.
---
Bethesda makes me extremely disappointed...
---
First they removed the daily/weekly atoms and replaced them with extremely disappointing battle-pass filled with so much wortless garbage and skins that don't work properly.
---
It‚Äôs to avoid a PvP ambush while claiming a workshop.
---
Its not really. Theres enough random junk scattered everywhere that finding the majority of the resources you need as a casual player are pretty easy to find. 
---
Farming large amounts of materials is more necessary for those of us who spend 4+ hours a day playing and enjoy doing the big fights over and over again.
---
Even then, the only REAL difficult materials for farming are your fluxes, which you often get as rewards for said boss fights. 
---
Most of these locations are near areas you already need to visit if you are doing all of your daily quests. The small spots will generally take less than 5 minutes to hit up for the materials listed (and can offer up small bonuses), and the larger areas tend to have higher level enemies, making it a good spot to farm not just the materials in question, but do and legendary weapons. 
---
For instance, yesterday I completed all of my SCORE challenges for the day in approximately 45 minutes. Spent another half an hour picking up lead for ammunition (not because I needed it, I just didnt have anything else to do at the time) and then I took a break until some friends came online. 
---
Then we spent like 4 hours just wandering around the map, not fast travelling and seeing what random encounters we came across. In that 4 hours of just random dicking around I was able to pick up as much, I'd not more lead than I did whilst specifically farming for it. 
---
In addition to being an accidentally efficient use of my time, it was fun as hell and we are planning the same for tonight. With matching cowboy outfits.
---
So before I do the quest of the raid can I work up and get good rep for both or what?
---
Just don't sell water for 20 caps a bottle, that always makes me laugh
---
\+1!
---
Yup.  The only way I'd believe this is if they said they'd made at least a dozen strategic hires of experienced developers, designers and project managers from outside the company, or handed the project to a different studio entirely.
---
I‚Äôm ashamed for both of us, you for making this post and me for reading it
---
Probably gonna go with the Raiders thanks for letting me know :)
---
After 2000 hours in-game, I‚Äôve never had anyone ambush me. It takes 30 seconds to claim a workshop.
---
It's bugged just like Jen's dialog in the settler storyline
---
My one friend and I will never start encryptid but when we see it pop up we both agree that one of us will take the pylons and one of us will kill the robots
---
That's a little harsh. She's at least Target brand Tiny Tina
---
Raiders, better story line by far. Make sure you do all quests for both sides up until you're forced to pick.
---
This happens on PC as well, maybe not as often, tho
---
You get rep by completing their quests and doing the dailies. Obviously, the one you complete the raid with gives you the most, but you can get to cooperative at least with the other one...which is enough to unlock the backpack mods.
---
Admittedly, every time I get a run on my vendors, it's low levels. And that's who my target is. I don't know if you recall the struggle to make and keep caps at lower levels, but I do. Fast traveling as a low level will nearly wipe you out. I'm not going to prey upon anyone trying to make their way out there in the wastes. Shit's already bad enough without me price gouging!
---
Higher levels aren't going to buy anyone's plans if they're ridiculously priced. Higher levels 1) already have the plans or 2) will use Google to find the plans themselves and/or buy cheaper from someone else.
---
I sell 5.56 (1c) and bloodied guns (real ones... Not just ones that say 'Bloody' and have shit traits). My vendor is always empty and my pockets full. 
---
My advice is *tailor your machines*. Don't just stock shit because you have space. Shit *is* shit. That's my business motto. I have one vendor and it churns over.
---
So if I went with raiders I wouldnt be able to get the Stealth suit and stuff?
---
The crazy thing is how much modders are able to get done without access to the source code.  They have to work with only what's provided, and can't get new code feature support.  Hell, they're even fixing engine bugs, some of which persist through multiple Bethesda games, in FO4 and Skyrim through script extender plugins.
---
Raiders always got the best storyline all the evidence is in fo4 with Nuka-World one of the best dlcs imo
---
The institute
---
people who make their entire gameplay dependent on the dailies and SCORE rewards are kinda weird in my eyes, but everyone‚Äòs in this game for different reasons and i hear ya. bethesda is only catering to a small portion of the fanbase lately and it sucks.
---
You dont???
---
You welcome man, just check here once in a while to make sure my info isn‚Äôt wrong or anything, don‚Äôt need you to be disappointed in anything, buts it fallout 76 so you will at some point
---
My allies tend to irritate me so I'd end up giving them offence nicknames like 'Wanky McMumbleshit the third'
---
Been dissapointed had this game since launch and just finally got back into it
---
You complete me.
---
Its actually an outfit now
---
I agree. My low level has max out scrip but my high level knows all the new plans for weapons
---
That's true. I don't think Bethesda have even acknowledged it so the bug should stick around for a while
---
Ye I made a post about it, I was pretty hyped.
---
I‚Äôm not, what‚Äôs the point in making stuff up that will never happen?
---
The stealth suit is available during the third settler quest, I believe. If you don‚Äôt do the raid until you complete all the other quests for both sides, you can still get the Stealth Suit (for free), if you don‚Äôt it‚Äôll cost you 4000 gold.
---
That's probably some kind of debug text like when you see "test1" in a text box or something. You know a game's fucked when that shows up in such a ridiculous quantity!
---
There are actually a lot of 100+ level players who buy basic camp plans.  Not everyone likes to do the parts of the game which grant them.
---
Only useful when I unload a clip into someone and the game decides to just let then live with the one sliver of health
---
That makes sense, I also wondered where the additional Ultracite armour came from.
---
Lol YESSSS. I typically hide away and then run away when the events done.
---
Sounding like Worf.
---
A bank would completely defy the point of a cap to begin with
---
So your saying do all the quests that get each faction ready for the raid to get max out of each before I decide?
---
I'm hoping it's intentional
---
I like the indicator on the map in RDR2 that shows where the bodies you've killed are laying. That way you can easily find them and loot them, and when you clear out what they have, they disappear off the map. 
---
Just give me little indicators and I'll be happy. Especially since West Virginia is awash in brambles and weeds that are as tall as your character.
---
It and the BoS banner are coming on Aug 11
---
Because its broken and does too much damage
---
Ive got a level 50 fixer if anyone wants to buy it just make an offer
---
I hope so as I'm a shotgun build.
---
82 lol
---
In the picture you could see The Deep, so I think we are going to go there.
---
I used to sell 5.56mm, but the boom/bust cycle didn‚Äôt suit me.  I also sold it at 1 cap each.  It was a good way to get rid of my excess steel and I found getting lead was really easy.
---
The problem I found was that people tended to buy it in mass quantity.  I would find it took up too much room in my stash and then suddenly it was all gone and I had to deal with the big influx of caps.
---
Very good item to sell for most people.  I wonder if EC rounds are selling well because of the Gauss weapons?
---
From 6caps for most plans to 550caps for any legendary stuff I put on. I'm not after keeping the stuff I put up for long so I price to sell. Cba with trying to get 1000's.
---
But I don't wanna wait
---
The socially acceptable thing to do is share.
---
It's usually the same camps that sell Mini Nuke for 100
---
I've seen a datamine with image of a concrete Igloo shaped construction, so basically a concrete skinned greenhouse/glasshouse/biodome (whatever Bethesda called it in the green bundle). I assumed that was the shelter.
---
How about a third: being able to fast travel directly into the shelter, avoiding an unnecessary loading screen.
---
Take out allllll the junk from your stash that can be scrapped down to components. Then, take that junk to workbench and "scrap all junk." This breaks everything down into its components and THEN put it in your stash. Never throw whole pieces of junk into your stash. Always scrap it and then store it.
---
And really, get rid of the weapons you never use and the armor you never use. It's taking up valuable space, as you can plainly see.
---
Sell legendaries that you will never use or turn them in for scrip.
---
I was in a team with my brother, both had pacifist on, took maybe 3 minigun clips. Also we dropped both out survival tents for respawn
---
Every Perk Pack gives me the same cards. I have six copies of the same card that I never wanted.
---
Quad assaultron heads with full charges and pistol perks can one shot SB‚Äôs in the air so they aren‚Äôt complete crap
---
I add to this to say that when you encounter a consumable, choose "eat" or "drink" rather than "take." This keeps the thirst/hunger bars full without taking on the weight of the consumable.
---
Huh... worst I get is when lighting bugs out and everything tastes purple.
---
I'm wondering if this is bugged. 
---
Many people are stating they can't find the drops.
---
A what?
---
Just anything new and cool like this at this point would be cool but this would be sick. Giving the community a reason to work together rather than just those public team bonuses and making player trading much easier if people could just setup shop in the city instead of having to fast travel from camp to camp
---
1. Likely
---
2. Yes
---
3. Either as both are situational. Fireproof is good against SB/SBQ and if you're sloppy with robot legendaries. Lifegiver is a flat boost but you only ever need to rely on it if you're being sloppy, otherwise it's just dead weight.
---
4. As far as I can recall, T-65 is a flat better choice in terms of DR but I don't think it matters too much if you picked the other.
---
5. No
---
Serendipity, Ricochet, and Dodgy all level 3's are a must anymore.  If you are running a jet pack chest, you must have lvl 3 fire proof, lvl 3 blocker is great vs ghouls/animals other wise you can skimp on it.  I mostly do in your face hulk/wolverine unarmed so I need the survivability when I only have 40 hps most of the time.  Radicool is another must for the extra str.  Here is my suggested base build, just add in what ever weapon spec on top of it.  I spec for damage resistance first, since you die a lot without it and you can one shot most mobs already more dmg isn't needed.

---
I believe that I just saw that in a YouTube video about the update.
---
Love these posts. Keep up the positive vibes amigo.
---
Eh it was more "double walls were being used to bog down servers to make exploits doable and server performance more abysmal. We will try to make it possible in the future" also there are other ways to make double walls just take more finessing.
---
Stop hating on our new vibe.
---
whats the fire rate on the mini gun? Bashing damage is a magic effect but you have to test it.  some guns are harder to trigger then others.
---
Might be shocking to find out, but people play games in diverse and unique ways.
---
I wondered why my top hat looked like someone went crazy with glistening highlighting powder.
---
I always go to pickets fort for a wood run ... loads in there
---
Foundation. But I reached ally status with both about a month and a half ago.
---
The whole "ally" thing is pointless except to make you keep grinding
---
I'm guessing it has to do with the Atlas challenge, I think one of the rewards is a fatigue outfit. So if they added it in last patch for that, maybe it accidentally replaced the old one.
---
I hate it when people do that. I'm usually just hanging around waiting for people to show. There'll be like 2 or 3 of us and some dummy will run in there and start it. I've failed it a few times because of that. By the time people show it's too late.
---
YES.
---
I am so god damned tired of building the same workshop over and over and over again. 
---
Although I do have it down to a science...I'd prefer to not have to do it again.
---
thanks m8 :)
---
i use 2 star fireproof and i am immune to scorchneast queen scream.  also maxed rejuventaed is good for the 50 plus health and ap regen for my since i use dodgy to absorb damage
---
For LTS, this game needs full new maps, I hope this expeditions thing gets really popular and encourages them to later add full on new locations.
---
My recurring drop is Instigating Minigun
---
I always felt that place was supposed to be a player hud area
---
Thanks will try it Out :)
---
Well I mean if he launched a nuke it wouldve just made their lvl 20 rifles even more useless so
---
Super mutants that use laser weapons are an excellent source of plastic. Make sure you have scrapper when you scrap their weapons.
---
I had a penta barrel on a 25ffr  and it was like 149.
---
Craft a stash box or two on the perimeter and stash your junk.
---
I quit playing back when Nuclear Winter released because me and my friends ran out of things to do, but I'm thinking of returning, is it worth it?
---
I heard they removed one of the game modes, the "hardcore" mode where you couldn't really fast travel and PVP was always on, is it true it's gone? We had the most fun with that.
---
All my plans are 10, all recipes are 5. Anything like prime mods, plans from Queen or mounted heads are 0.
---
Never thought to sell serums I'm always broke on this game (max out at around 8k) so these could help at 300 a pop
---
The idea was to have something to invest in that truly is of the players. Not just another faction who we barely interact with, and having a player based faction in Fallout canon is such an awesome concept.
---
Play any MMO and it's just as tedious, only in different ways
---
F76 Capital Wasteland anyone?
---
Helvetia isn't bad for a wood run too.
---
use blocker too.   honestly PA doesnt matter.   watch angry turtles videos on the best pa part 2.  basically just wearing any PA reduces inckming damage 50 percent.  check out his chart at the end.  there is a 10 percent difference in acutal dr from excavator and stranglers in practice.  even though Bethesdas number are way different.  i roll with my excavator armor everwhere except whe  i need a jetpak.  beacuse i use kinetic dynamo on my chest to refill the ap for my dodgy perk.  and blocker. and action boy.  i pretty much never die unless i get to many rads
---
I'm thinking it might be best to redeem it all on 3* weapons or Armor and then trade them over using a mule or risk it with a private world
---
Totally agree. All the NW effort should have been used to build up Adventure mode. These companies need to stop spreading their resources so thin and choose 1 direction and put the time and money there.

---
Bash damage is extremely useful to tag  legendaries. Bash damage doing nearly no damage is very handy for not killing one star legendaries.
---
Yes im one of them people that call people over
---
Im currently level 83 on the legendary run.
---
The sad part is we only desire this so much because first the camp is so lack luster and we can barely customize out of what Bethesda gave us and the story is not near as personal and intriguing as the other fallouts because everything you said had an impact. Its understandable here how its less personal because its multiplayer but what if they added servers for like raiders or settlers where they have more reach depending on the one you sided with or something like that ya know. I know thats to much to ask for but one can dream.
---
the new guy with the red berret is wearing it right? maybe thats a factor
---
AND GAMBLING OMFG PUT THE CASINO IN IT THE REAL GREENBRIER HAS A CASINO, YOU HAVE SLOT MACHINE ASSETS ALREADY (IN THE LOBBY IN NW) AHHHH GAMBLING PLZZZ BETH
---
yeah i always got blocked equipped ! things always change in this game so its hard to know what's the best options sometimes hehe
---
Also fun!
---
I'd say go with fireproof, since you can boost hp with chems and food more easily.
---
I'm not even sure if there is any food or chem that specifically reduces damage from explosions.
---
Additionally, demolition expert buffs gauss weapons, as it's inherently explosive, so you're going to want that explosion resistance for using the minigun up close.
---
Any time!
---
Yeah this would be useful, people showing up in my workshops makes me nervous and has me pull out my auto grenade launcher every time, lol.
---
 Stranger things have happened
---
I had that glitch but my character looked far more demented and deformed ... truly the stuff of nightmares
---
I was actually considering asking high level players what they do. I am 79 now and about to do the final quests and stuff, and i know there is not really endgame content, but i just see high levels farming legendaries and starting scorch beast queen fights.. Sounds kinda boring to me?
---
got a bloodied/ffr/bash damage...black powder...godammit
---
upvoted for taking it like a man.
---
SS
---
Oh! it's the bum bum bus.
---
I think he's make a joke, lol.  We've been dealing with shit since launch we were promised and still not seen
---
I'm not sure why, but "Reclamation" being the name of a Vault 76 dweller city just sounds *amazing* to me.
---
But if you want to go full heavy and never die watch Angry Turtles video on full health heavy. As you can see I'm a huge angry turtle fan. LOL. I followed it to a T  and I only die when I'm over radiated And then get all your weapons Furious or go Junkies and you'll be putting out good damage.
---
Paint it next time.
---
I had it painted with the vault-tec paint job.

---
Can you get banned for unknowingly opening dupes presents ?
---
I use the officer fatigues and it still underarmor
---
Then how did u drop it?
---
hate-train bandwagoners &amp; obsidian cultist are like government leftist - giving misleading information &amp; always active with their black propaganda
---
I am pretty high level (390 on my main) so I have most things I want, ergo try to keep my prices low:  
---
1. Any Plan 5-10 caps, except fasnacht plants, those are 200 (and I will probably drop that soon)
---
2. Weapon Mods 5
---
3. Serums 250-275 (violet or crimson flux ones cost a bit more because I usually use those fluxes for weapons instead)
---
4. Except a QFFRMS Tesla I have posted on my wall as trade only (also, why does no one DM me about this weapon?), I do 250-500/star for weapons.   
---
Once per day I put out a good role weapon/armour for very reasonable price. For example, BFFR Railway, AAE Railway,  BFFR Gatling Gun - 3k, JFFR Light Machine Gun 5K. Right now, BFFRMS Flamer for less than 2k.  
---
Funny thing is, people complain no one puts up good weapons in their vendor, I put one good one up a day (at a good price I think?) and I sell one of those possibly once every 2 weeks.
---
5. Any ammo: 1 cap
---
6. Bobbleheads and comics are 50-100
---
Hamsters are cute tho so in a way it's good
---
Tbh if I get close to 30,000 caps I go on a heavy spending spree ... now I kinda feel broke at 8000 :(
---
I was spam dropping lots of grenades.
---
It's a bug Bethesda is looking into
---
To get the defend event a few minutes after you take it.
---
I had the same thing with cat house. MAD was the only outcome, especially after I reached the top of the stairs having the jump on you just to fall through that same set of stairs giving my sneak attack away.
---
Why?
---
Brotherhood fatigues (the blue camo) are now an outfit. All the special stat bonuses are removed (sorry flux). However they forgot to change the weight of the fatigues from 1 to .1 in the process.
---
For the score daily
---
Unless there is something different with this weapon it will destroy itself if painted.
---
You blew through the one game mechanic that slows you down from doing stupid shit.
---
It's gone.
---
so i still need to get the other ones for the quest?
---
Are you still able to get into that specific server? The bag might still be there if no one came across it.. it seems to take quite a while for bags to disappear sometimes.. not sure if it would still be there after you leave the server though
---
You only have to take the workshop, not defend it.
---
She never lands!!
---
No, claiming a workshop is not an event. Defending it after you claim it is.
---
JuiceHead covered that as well, who in the past has been pretty outspokenly supportive of them, and he basically said that was worth nothing. Not that they wouldn‚Äôt do it, but there‚Äôs just been a precedent of ‚Äúwe‚Äôll look into it‚Äù written by someone as politically Neutral as possible so they can‚Äôt technically get in trouble if it doesn‚Äôt happen.
---
Hearing those devs actually tell us what they want to happen vs what they are actively working on was a good step, especially since those guys definitely didn‚Äôt have a poker face
---
It‚Äôs the sort of thing that would be highly visible to users, and get a huge amount of use by players. Which is why we want it. 
---
But it‚Äôs also why it‚Äôs got a lot of business risk attached. It‚Äôs not like that one screen of an app that one person uses every twenty years, so if QA finds it broken, just write a ticket to the backlog and knock off early.
---
And if your studio already has a reputation for shaky initial deliveries, that you want to change, that risk is higher.
---
And if your app code is weirdly coupled and a bit of a rats nest, where one small change can have significant second or third order effects, that risk is even higher.
---
So now you‚Äôre looking to ameliorate that risk.
---
So first you‚Äôre going to have to spec out what perk load out screens do. There‚Äôs going to be prior art, sure. But you want to have a good rough draft on a ticket, so that your dev(s) can start up something ASAP. You need stakeholder agreement and buy in, and someone has to think about how this will tie in to existing systems. Probably at least a couple of days work from someone at a Lead or Architect level.
---
Now you have some (rough) requirements! 
---
 So you go to UX. After all, players are going to be looking at this screen a lot.
---
Let‚Äôs say they‚Äôre running a Lean system, and you have the ability to get your stakeholders together 3 days a week. You can probably knock out a prototype using two artists over a 2 week sprint. 
---
At the same time you‚Äôve got a couple of devs trying to build the thing. They put together a rough load out on day one. Except if you select Luck cards it CTD‚Äôs. And the wireframes aren‚Äôt ready yet (because UX are in parallel) so it looks like rubbish.
---
So they fix that bug on day two, and then a Producer somewhere reads the requirements and suggests a change. We‚Äôre Agile, it‚Äôs cool, but it means another day of work. 
---
Then UX provide the wireframes, and they have some stuff not in the requirements. So you sit down to hash out what the new stuff is, where it came from, and if it needs to go in. Then you make the changes.
---
Then your unit tests fail and you don‚Äôt see why for half a day. The fix involves some significant refactoring of old spaghetti code, so you need to work out what that touched so you can tell QA of likely problem areas when they do test it.
---
Then UX provide the final designs, and you have to make some minor changes. That means more refactoring. More failed tests. More builds that won‚Äôt compile.
---
Then someone from QA reads the requirements and asks if you‚Äôve thought about case (x). You have not. More refactoring.
---
But eventually (generously lets say in ten working days) you have a build that looks good! 
---
So you give it to QA for functional testing. They figure out in the first four hours that if you open the load out screen while in Power Armor on PC (but not Xbox, and not while out of PA), the client CTD‚Äôs. They carry on while you start making a fix, even though the fix could have an impact, because resource and time are tight and someone committed to a release schedule.
---
You fix this defect. It means rewriting a method in a file someone who last worked here in 2014 wrote, which is called in who knows how many other places. By now you‚Äôre just hoping it works.
---
It does!
---
QA teat it on PC, then on devices in serial, because there aren‚Äôt enough testers to go around and everyone else is already doing overtime on other tickets. That means a week or two of back and forth and logged defects and discussions on priority and if a thing is a bug or not, and if it needs to be fixed pre-release.
---
But it all looks good, so now it goes to PTS.
---
Someone on PTS discovers that opening the load out screen in building mode while on a full public team with an x4 bonus on PS4 somehow causes camp items to duplicate. Your frustrated scream reverberates through the Alps. Forum posts ask why no-one tested this crap.
---
You pull the perk loadout screen from the release, and start retesting/fixing in a frenzy. Find the bug. Fix the bug. But a VP‚Äôs teenager played in PTS and had an idea that the VP wants added in pre-release. And it needs design work. So you go back to the top of this post and start again.
---
Half a day? Ha!
---
I remember back in Fallout 4 I used the RU556 assault rifle mod, the bash damage on it was broken though so it would one shot most stuff. Gotta say, it was fun to run up to people in the middle of a fire fight and wack them with my gun to kill them during the settlement ambush kit. 
---
Bash damage in 76 is a joke though, I feel like it should stagger stuff or at least knock them down long enough to reload.
---
He said it was atom shop painted; it would have destroyed itself and not be in the bag
---
it's even worse because it was probably destroyed, then.
---
it was probably duped, though. not saying it makes the situation any less bad, just that even in March those were highly duped.
---
No. BE flamers are special. They get destroyed of you drop them. Because of the dupe glitch
---
RemindMe! 12 hours "Read this!"
---
Again, why?
---
There are easier and quicker events, without the need to hang around a PvP zone.
---
I just want that skull gas mask at 92. Fireplace is cool though! Just not as worried about missing out on it
---
O dang.. I did not know that... I know it now though! Thanks for that one
---
So. It can be any gun with said effects? As long as it has a fire rate of 200 or above?
---
  And any shotgun with bashing damage will one shot most enemies?
---
  Can someone please make me a list of the specific guns and builds that qualify and what the effects would need to be please? I have a mule account that us completely stocked on weapons as nd I dont want to mistakenly script one. 
---
  It would be greatly appreciated.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the BOS camps in the bog, you can get almost 30 ballistic fibre by hitting those up. And as a junk hunter I find that ballistic fibre is one of the hardest to find.
---
This game will forever be an enigma to me
---
Is it legendary?
---
Amazing ! Never seen a camp this cool before !
---
Well... except for Johnny trying to double-cross you and kill you. Liu begging you for assisted suicide. Rara's mentally disturbed behavior. And every generic raider NPC endlessly berating, insulting and  posturing at you ad nauseam. The negativity gets old. Fast.
---
I do agree that that the Crater Raiders story flow and interactions with the player and eachother is a *lot* more fleshed out than the Spruce Knob Settlers.  
---
But after the Vault 79 raid, both sides fall into the generic. They just have names.
---
One plus for the Settlers, they have quirky Penny and her kitty, and Jenn with her refurbished Liberator. Seeing her reunited with her mother is also wholesome.
---
It's nice to have your crops inside, protected from anything that would destroy them, and you can lock the door, if you're selfish with your crops.
---
Bethesda already released a breakdown of when we should expect the rewards. Pretty sure the beret will be in the atomic shop on Tuesday
---
I‚Äôm sorry but no.  Heck getting that for 29K was a steal in and of itself.  Now that fire damage is a thing the BE flamer is BIS.
---
I've always thought a player city would be neat, but at the same time the biggest advantage would be to have access to all the player vending machines in one location and I can't help but feel that'd be a detriment. Having a shared world where you can build up your camp and visit other camps is one of the great strengths of 76 and player vending ties it all together nearly with giving us a reason to do all this. I somewhat think a convenient whitesprings type location for player vendors would just take that away.
---
I checked after I wrote the comment and nah it‚Äôs not legendary, it‚Äôs probably not worth anything so I might as well keep it
---
It got destroyed because you painted it not because of some special status.
---
Such fun making a new character and knowing all the things from the previous playthrough. I got to level 90 on my new character before I knew it. Remember the spots, the good loot areas. Wow, enjoyed my second playthrough way way better. Especially with the legendary runs and such. Games came a long way since the beta days.
---
Berets are lame anyway. What are you French? LOL JK
---
Probably SS unless you want solar‚Äôs full set buff. I believe solar also guarantees you 3*‚Äôs when crafting but someone else may want to corroborate that. So it would take less work to finish.
---
It's not as efficient as other was of tagging. You have to run up to the enemy before tagging it, bashing breaks weapons faster and seeing someone run up to a legendary may make people assuming you're going to kill it for yourself. Plus bashing doesn't do enough damage to some enemies for your damage to count towards the kill. That's a good point though but it's very situational
---
No one ever bothers me at the Berkeley mine or at the Charlestown landfill. They're both near my camp. I claim and defend+ within 10 mins after I log on. Why are you arguing? Works fine for me.
---
Survival is gone largely due to how broken it was.  Nuclear Winter is much more active and actually depends on some skill as you can‚Äôt just spawn camp with legacy weapons.
---
You sure? My BE gatling plasma also gets destroyed of I drop it. I still have that one left,
---
That knife fight took so long... It was like watching two old men fight to the death. 
---
(Also in my experience melee doesn‚Äôt work well in vats.)
---
The naming of the Radiers is a misnomer are in fact the remnants of the original inhabitants with the Settlers being completely new to the area. Think of them more as 'Returners' and the Settlers as 'Newcomers' and the more nuanced distrust of the two factions makes more sense. The true 'Raiders' of the post Wastelanders era are the Blood Eagles who have taken on the mantle of a semi-nomadic, aggressive, shoot first ask questions later tribe.
---
when your lifestyle is built on raiding and killing anyone who resists, I would imagine there‚Äôs gonna be some negativity lol
---
I‚Äôm not talking about the factions part, I‚Äôm talking about the vault dwellers attacking each other. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an explanation of why some vault dwellers went rogue and decided to attack their fellow vault dwellers because the game made as if all residents of vault 76 were friendly to each other which makes sense since they have been living together for years. 
---
But if we are talking about factions, then yeah it could make sense post wastelanders release because you could join the raiders and raiders shoot anyone on sight, so a vault dwellers becoming a raider is possible. But pre wastelanders and raiders, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a lore reason of why would a vault dweller attack a fellow vault dweller
---
I saw turtle measuring stealth effects by getting in front of an enemy (I can't remember what,) swapping things around, and noting the bracket changes. The larger the bracket around "hidden," the better your stealth.
---
I've been meaning to do that, because they supposedly fixed shadowed but I feel like my stealth was better with polymer.
---
If people don't shot from the fence or a tent its ok as the queen needs to be able to target and find a path to you on the ground before she lands. Also don't shoot continually, if she staggers in the air she can't land.
---
this game has so much potential
---
But why Tuesday? What is their logic behind that. "Like hey you all put in work for this, lets make you wait even longer for that 100k+ steel you donated for nothing" because the BOS Donor Provisions are whack and we all know thag
---
Gonna be a lot tougher because they were giving those extra dailies to make up for the autocomplete bug. They sound like they think they fixed it so goodbye to those extras.
---
Yes things with atom shop paint jobs get destroyed.  I can drop my BE gatling plasma and pick it up again so I have no idea why yours would be destroyed.
---
It... is... BETA...
---
Because fans develop their own expectations without paying attention to what's already been stated by the developer. I unserstand the game started as a dumpster fire and still has it's issues, but it's about time the community understands that it some issues it needs to iron out before throwing so much shade at the developer.
---
Sounds like the devs have a lot of clear plans for this year. Survival is no longer a thing, but they‚Äôre doubling down on more larger quest lines for players who like the story driven rpg
---
Why on God's green flat Earth do so many people put an "s" on the end of Whitespring?
---
#and it sure won‚Äôt be you here in a minute
---
Maybe your extra score adds on to the next season so you get a head start ? Could be a possibility that it‚Äôs banked and as soon as the next season start you will instantly jump ahead :)
---
Then yeah the free loot in them can be useful to you but you‚Äôll still get the same loot if you play the game normally, chasing after these is a waste of time
---
I find the build is a strange combination of tanky as heck, then you die. Honestly, it is quite fun.  
---
Am bloody heavy/melee and regularly facetank the queen. Then a scorched hits me with a hunting rifle from 30000ft and: dead. So, expect to die but take a lot of baddies with you.
---
I installed that a couple days ago and enjoyed the broken bash damage haha. Most games that incorporate bashing usually add a lot of stagger or a lot of damage. For example, the zombies in L4D are incredibly weak, but bashing them makes it worthwhile as it helps free up breating space or if you need to reload, on the flipside you have halo where melee is incredibly useful and powerful.
---
It just seems useless, just like the perks that supposedly aid bashing
---
I have around 1200 of them lol, I never used them
---
SS has a jetpack, and the Thorn armor has the sneak and melee bonus, so maybe get the healing factor mutation and pick one of those?
---
That‚Äôs fine, just trying to clarify. Since someone was complaining about ambushed.
---
Nah I opened about 40k I got from trades
---
Oh. That is kinda Weird of mind gets destroyed but not yours
---
I've recently learned that a full chameleon set is better than the CSS, bar the fact you can't move. but that can be mitigated, somewhat, with 22 agility and all the relevant perks and mods, such as sneak, escape artist, shadowed and muffled.
---
that armor piece has nothing to do with you becoming invisible for a second after you crouch, that's one of the effects of the escape artist perk.
---
the 3rd legendary effect on the piece is called HTD, "harder to detect while sneaking", or just sneak. it doesn't stack (I've had lengthy arguments on the topic in the past and can prove it) but does help your ability to sneak. apparently it's the equivalent to 1 shadowed armor piece, like the sneak bonus from fixers.
---
a single HTD piece is not going to perform better than the CSS, though. just like a single shadowed armor piece wouldn't. you need a full chameleon or unyielding set to best the CSS, with HTD on one of the pieces.
---
shadowed works outside and in broad daylight, by the way. not just in "dark areas" like the description would have you believe. same with HTD and the fixer bonus.
---
Shotgun shells rare? They drop from practically every scorched ghoul and mole miner.
---
I move lots of higher end junk in my vendors and make decent profit doing so. Black titanium, screws, springs, gear, acid, aluminum, lead, ballistic fibre all sells pretty well. I mostly collect that junk while farming legendaries so even if an area has no legendary mobs I can still profit from my run. But as you said, I‚Äôm at lvl 190 now, and need far less junk for myself so more and more just go into the vendors. Heck I‚Äôm even running out of stuff to spend caps on, pretty much serum recipes and the odd weapon/armour mod for stuff I‚Äôll never use.
---
That's a great legendary combination, although exploding bullets can be hazardous to you if used carelessly. There are few necessary mods other than increased magazine capacity, barrel length (accuracy), and fire rate. I use the gatling much of the time when not against a big bad, since it doesn't drink ammo like a 50 cal. Lucky Hole Mine usually has a gatling to scrap for mods unlocks.
---
I get pipe weapons with bloodied and instagating and all the good shit. 
---
Then when I get a good gun it's some assassin's, exterminator shit
---
Oh I know this. I finally get fed up waiting, especially when there‚Äôs 12 mins left and she still hasn‚Äôt landed because everyone is trigger happy, and just start unloading my gatling while she hovers. I had this happen the other day and we finally took her out with 2 seconds on the timer.
---
If by ‚Äúbroken‚Äù you mean ‚Äúso overpowered almost nothing can break through it in PvP broken‚Äù yes.
---
No idea. Maybe trying to release events rewards in sets of 2, since I think concrete ends Tuesday. Or could be something internal that they need to check. They had posted a calendar of when to expect the rewards somewhere, so seems like they had a reason for it other than just not being ready.
---
Aha ! So that‚Äôs why my friend constantly wants us to do guided meditation and line in the sand all the damn time ! 
---
Does that get you more score ? Or just xp?
---
I was having issues on patch day with line in the sand, but that went away yesterday. I ran it with huge piles on the ground and no frame issues.
---
Yeah, give them a few more years and I'm sure they will hammer out the dents.
---
I got a Tse pipe rifle lvl 10 once. My friends and I have passed it around for new characters when doing both sides of the heist or starting mule characters.
---
I play on ps4 and and only had 2 run ins with griefers and that was when I was low level first starting out. Community's been fantastic and helpful.
---
If you ever need someone to play with hmu
---
Psn is Daddy_Dani_
---
Do you have decent sneak skills, a bunch of Stealth Boys or a Chinese stealth suit you can wear? I‚Äôve done that mission at level 30. Fire up the monitor and hide in the back corner behind the elevator. The robots rarely (it CAN happen) go through that corridor. If you can get your hands on a Marsupial serum even better, jump on top if you see one coming.
---
The Ammo Converter is such a huge disappointment to me. So many things wrong with it,
---
To start with, the exchange rates are absolutely terrrible. But that's not the worst part, I could live with the bad exchange rates if the interface wasn't so horribly designed. Even the recent change they made is pretty useless. Why can't we just use a slider to determine how much we want to sell all in one go? Even if the slider went up in increments that divide evenly into the minumum number of bullets required for 1 ammo point. Also, you can't see how much ammo of each type you have while you are using it. And lastly, the thing is way too big. It would be nice if it was the size of one of the camp terminals.
---
They really need to re-visit the entire design of the thing. The concept was such a good idea, but they completely missed the mark.
---
The Crater Raiders are the remains of the Diehards that fled West Virginia to escape the insanity David caused by wiping out the Responders. Which led to the fall of the Free States and BoS.
---
As a sect of the Raider factions, the Diehards were the more... sane ones. But having Meg leading them is not a step upward from when Margie McClintock was in control.
---
They're putting it in when the new Atomic Shop Update is released. My guess is because they're going to be adding it to the Atomic Shop and any players who didn't earn it will likely be able to purchase it.
---
All plans except fixer or bear arms 0-33 caps.
---
Beers that don‚Äôt have added effects 1 cap
---
Beer with added effects eg Rad Ant 2 caps
---
All ammo 1 cap
---
Non-spoiling foods 2-30 caps 
---
My main sells the food and beer out of my pizza place camp
---
My alt sells plans and ammo
---
Yikes. It's gone
---
Yeh and put it right into your stash and never use it..
---
All perks can‚Äôt be good and it seems these always get a higher rng chance.
---
How many stars though?
---
I will defend my workshop, it's not because I like to troll, it's because i like to -defend my workshop- this pops up in the screen, my workshop is under attack, stop the attackers, if I kill you 5 times, that's my weekly for 5 events done, or whatever the weekly was, and, I am, defending, my workshop =), feel free to take any other one, i wont be defending workshops i dont have, and no, it's not about the trolling and auto pvp, it's about  defending my workshop, lol thank you for reading
---
well that's just silly
---
Not if you think about it once player hit the 800 weight limit per stash it be annoying to share it with 2nd character
---
I find that so funny
---
I sell all my items at 1/10 cap value unless it‚Äôs items Bethesda undervalued like legendaries, certain rare plans, or junk items. Any higher and I don‚Äôt sell enough for it to be worth my time or the inventory space that stuff fills up
---
I believe‚Äúordinance express‚Äù effects all explosives. Missles as well have reduced weight with this perk
---
I wasn't nagging
---
guy askes what people wanted
---
I said I'd want some regular beams going straight up to support a balcony
---
you're really not good at this whole "thinking" bit, huh
---
This, I have around 25-30k caps on four different characters üòÇ
---
When I tried to chat, they said something about their boss. But no dialogue opened
---
I still cringe at my first time doing this event. My GF and I had just finished the wolf quests and got our cards and we were all excited. We didn't know we could start the event and thought we had to wait for the icon to pop in the map. One night it did, we raced over, a bunch of players were standing around, and we were like, "I guess they don't have cards." I ran to the terminal and thought I was activating the event with my card. Only later did I realize I still had my card, and only later still after seeing a post like this did I realize I stole someone's event and he/she was waiting with others to start the event after running the clock down.
---
Perhaps, and this is just a guess here... Maybe it's because that's when they update the Atomic Shop
---
It was definitely interesting...
---
Also, happy Cake Day!
---
Radcooldude55YT
---
They tried to remove arcing... this is what they left behind lol
---
Serums 300, camp plans 10, weapon plans 10-150, armor mods 250, weapons and armor 500-5000.
---
I have jumped on the roof and blasted down on em, tried three times now and im out of stimpaks and ammo...
---
Anything melee with stalkers attached to it.
---
I‚Äôd like to change the mutant hound dog models into paradigm‚Äôs dog XD
---
What is this you speak of, i barely started main quest and i have 300 hours since wastelanders.
---
That's it basically. If you're anything like me camp building is massive in the endgame. Finding the perfect spot and making the perfect camp. And it's going to be even better later this year with instanced interiors and less restrictions. But usually it's sbq and dailies. But I just do events instead of dailies for treasury notes
---
This is how I do my dailies if there isn‚Äôt a hoard event active. I just find someone‚Äôs workshop that needs to defended and my event is done in a few minutes .
---
I really dont suggest it till they actually fix the game. Dont give Bethesda your money and tell them they are doing it right.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm not comfortable giving out someone else‚Äôs GT on reddit.
---
If you have a full Unyielding set the sneak card is redundant.
---
I actually did that too the other day for the first time. I didn't realize you could.
---
It‚Äôs automatically a ‚Äúwaste‚Äù if it‚Äôs only used once for a main quest? What kind of spoiled baby logic is that? It was a fun and interesting quest in my opinion. That‚Äôs not a waste to me. Find a better word, ungrateful little brat.
---
This is a great summary. Thank you!
---
Happy cake day!
---
You need to do Becket‚Äôs ally quest.  I was also surprised by this with over 300 hours in game.
---
HTD doesn't stack with other HTD pieces? Or it doesn't stack with anything?
---
It's really hard to do when my FPS is shot to hell.
---
The "endgame" is grinding out your dream set of gear
---
Exactly. When I did this event a second time, my game crashed in the middle of me looting the meat piles.
---
But do you have coffee?
---
Can you really not wait until Tuesday without throwing a temper tantrum over a beret?
---
Sounds like you played a game until you were ready for a new one.
---
I got a 1* executioner's rolling pin from SBQ last night and a 1* Hunter's sickle from her the previous night. I got better loot from the event itself.
---
...every player earned it
---
This is the first time it has been so bad for me.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Morganstown high school, back gymnasium has tons of bowling pins, plastic plates, and golf balls. 
---
Watoga high school, I picked up exactly 100 million plastic forks along with 5 paint cans. 
---
Also right out side of top of the world, there are weights and can chimes toward the secret raider hideout. As well as several goodies in the hideout itself.
---
I'm powering my other fusion generator
---
If you‚Äôve been playing for a long time there used to be a bug where your power armor would dupe itself if you got out in heavy lag. That‚Äôs a possibility.
---
Xbox.
---
K. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Went and found it again. It was a mixture of circles and O's this time instead of all O's. But this is it.
---

---
New radio song suggestion : Chain, chain chain... Chain of Fools...
---
It's a no brainer if you remember that Bethesda will always go with the cheapest and laziest option. 
---
The Atomic Shop is an existing platform that makes it trivial to distribute the beret to all players and why put in extra effort to make a separate update to the Atomic Shop when there is one coming several days after the event ended.
---
In this instance, the cheap and lazy option also happens to be the best one. See absolutely no problem with Bethesda doing this. Not having the beret for a few days means dick all.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs a bug
---
She gone
---
My bad, I misread the patch notes. I thought they had said every player who participates.
---
Are you using a combat shotgun? Mine is broken since the new patch. I can bash for more damage than I can shoot. Pump works fine though.
---
I used to need 4 fusion generators when I ran my water camp that had 34 industrial purifiers, that shit aint cheap bro! lol
---
I live that when it started all I spotted was posts about how we will never complete this run. Now it's posts about needing more to do. This community is never happy, just play. Or don't.
---
Thank you all so much for the birthday wishes! Not gonna lie the best part about this game is the people who play it. I was an original beta tester on the ps4 and have been playing since and haven‚Äôt really met any rude players. Most people banded together to try to change the game for the better and that‚Äôs awesome to see.
---
T65 is slightly better, against a lvl 95 behemoth there is a 3 point damage difference from its heavy hit between the sh and t65. So the difference is very small. I always recommend the sh if you can get the mods for it since it gives a slight amount of damage. Its almost nothing but its the only pa with an effect haba
---
HTD doesn't stack with other HTD pieces. you only need one for the full benefit.
---
supposedly it's intended to stack, and it's bugged.
---
They are indeed missing.  Supposedly, they are in the files (along with every other missing mod for the SecServ armor), but someone failed to inform Regs of this.
---
If Vault 76 is inoperable we could be gathering the materials to make it operable again
---
Boys if anyone is still here, I had 20 ammo factories at my camp, moved camp and sure enough I had invisible budget taken, BUT;
---
I re-placed 20 ammo factories at my new camp and changed server, the invisible budget is gone after changing server.
---
I don‚Äôt quite get why the don‚Äôt just enable them using a hotfix.
---
The 20 ammo factories under my camp.
---
Well, the idea that people aren't going to trade caps/items between their characters through the use of a friend or drop-trading, etc... is kind of asinine in its own right.
---
If there's a will, there's a way.
---
As long as it's happening, I don't see the harm in finding a way to make it less of a hassle.  The alternative being that we make literally everything in the game untradeable so people can't trade it to their alts.  Does that sound more reasonable?  Doesn't to me.
---
They could make a thing out of it, too.  Kind of like they're setting up this BoS event, they could have one for establishing some sort of new site that you can visit to transfer things at.
---
I like the idea of creating new content through storyboarding and making global events that everyone feels like they're a part of.  It makes the game feel more alive and immersive even if it's a completely one-sided resource dump for low budget cosmetic items ( not saying I don't like cosmetic items for rewards, just not skimpy ones that required little to no effort ).  At least the double dailies/bonus challenges will be worth it.
---
this comment deserves it's own post, people don't realise the work that goes into seemingly simple feautres. Whoever downvoted is just throwing their toys out of the pram
---
I think it'd let that happen organically, through the load balancing, and they wouldn't need to create a separate server mode.
---
A turret in the Burrows.
---
It doesn't move, and there is ample cover to get away from it, so it's a good fixed spot for judging stealth.
---
Honest, at first I thought you meant you had been nice to your wife but she told you you were bad üòÇ
---
ah yes, super hard to take something else out, put the item in, switch to character 2, fast travel to camp, take out item
---
right
---
you're a great example of the kind of person who'd enjoy F76
---
Tbh, I could care less about the SoL junk pole anyway. I only really wanted the beret
---
Solar would be quicker/easier to complete but SS is the better armor.
---
Ya, the FO4 Vault Tech workshop gave you tons of space.  I made a pretty massive vault, then populated it completely with Piper clones (I used the Synth workshop mods to make synth clones of her lol). Piiippperr? Piper? Piper!!!
---
I lost points too and I wanted to scream.
---
Read the post in a little more detail -- it's not about that.  Doing PvP is actually broken -- we've been trying to run PvP events but because of the mechanics it is almost impossible.  When everybody resets every time you die, it's unviable for anything more than just random picking fights.
---
Agents live by rules
---
As I understand it, Chameleon is primarily a visual effect versus other players, not something that PvE takes into account when judging stealth.
---
Yep, this would definitely fix the problem. That was me last night. Had a good scorched earth server and figured I would kick off an encryptid after. 1 min into waiting for everyone to show up a level 40 wanders in and starts the event ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I figured, well I guess it's you and me bud üòÇ Tanked all 3 pylons, (as a bloodied, so we're not all bad) and ate shit for a few minutes (please don't revive me if I'm still holding the pylons, might as well keep her vulnerable as long as possible) Thankfully this gave everyone enough time to show up so all good. I don't really blame the newer players, it does clearly say to start the event in the upper right of the screen, of course it also says to activate the pylons but I don't think a lot of people are reading the instructions at that point. I did score a sweet fedora, but more importantly a 3* bloodied shovel!
---
be nice to get a new sniper rifle, haven't had one added since Far Harbour
---
Sounds like somebody is triggered.  Does this talk about emotions?  Or is this talking about trying to make something work to improve PvP and PvE together?  We've been trying to run coordinated PvP events, and the system we have now just doesn't support it.  You respawn and everything is reset (to all but the one player you aggro'd unless you seek revenge).  It just isn't usable for anything other than 1v1 fights.  And that gets boring.
---
What if its executioners and  has a ffr of 227 and it doesn't have bashing but +1 perception. Would that qualify?
---
it's not. it does.
---
no, I just checked it. I dont have any tse miniguns
---
Only the meatpiles disappear after looting, ash and goo piles are not.
---
I hadn't considered workshops.  I'd be fine with people who have PvP disabled also being unable to claim a workshop.
---
The point I've made above is I want to make PvP actually better on Adventure.  I think this would go a LONG way to doing that.  We've been trying to coordinate PvP team events, and it just doesn't work well at all because of the way it's setup.
---
Yeah.
---
It's a dangerous thing.  On one hand, painting with an Atomic Shop skin prevents you from accidentally scripping or selling it.  On the other, if you drop it, it's *gone*.
---
Almost two years later and there's still no way of simply *locking* gear from being traded or dropped.
---
Yes, they stack.
---
People accuse me of hacking because my health regens so quickly, but spamming a few quantums real quick is actually all I'm doing.
---
I think the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù on both counts.
---
With Bethesda's history a hotfix probably would cause more issues.
---
its Bethesda! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lol.   its crazy how they can  add something  promote it and it doesnt exsist.
---
Cole seems to forgotten about it.
---
Why do you hope it‚Äôs intentional? It‚Äôs not like the BoS underarmor is OP.
---
Thinking the exact same thing.
---
Maybe even Anchorage, although I suspect that they‚Äôre going to save that one for a separate game.
---
if you're on PC, save my stuff does that.
---
I can 100% understand this.
---
Those Floater Grenades really pile up, and unless you want to just lob them blindly, there's nothing you can do but drop them, and heaven forbid you drop one extra time. :\\
---
Ammo for 1c. Magazines, tokens, claim tickets, etc. for 37c. Biv brews 5c. Ore 10c. Recipes for 25c, camp plans for 50c, armor and weapon plans 100c. Legendaries are median price based on Fed76 price range.
---
Sometimes the stuff sits for a while, but I like to sell stuff like magazines, ore, and recipes for people doing those challenges, because it's not long before someone comes and clears it all out at once.
---
Ballistic bock is a good seller, too.
---
I like it as an outfit so I'd like to be able to keep it as one
---
The same mechanic shows up for Floater Grenades, though.
---
I don't think shadowed and muffled are in the files though.
---
Thought of that, but the main reason I'm not suggesting it that it will change the tutorial/beginning of a new players experience in Fallout 76. Such a change could have changes I can't think of.
---
I thought it was a turret, but I couldn't remember. Thanks, that'll help with my own testing.
---
You are a hero!
---
So you also have alot of presents?:)
---
Yes. Keep a friend who also has FO1st in your private server. I make my boyfriend do this for me when I'm transferring stuff. I'm not risking any chance of losing the aid and weapons I'm transferring!
---
I play 76, but what is NW?
---
I remember getting on that bus in my noob days. I'm still wary of those fuckers.
---
Lol, I honestly had no idea this would be that controversial of a suggestion. And if you want to project your angst about Fallout not being Interplay-ey enough for you anymore or the fact that there isn‚Äôt a mode where you have to relieve your bodily functions or you die of dysentery on the Appalachian Trail, then by all means...keep trying to rage type it into existence, seems to be working.
---
I think mostly everyone would agree more immersion and simulation of apocalyptic challenges would be good. But trying to find a glitched out pile of meat soup that shit out a .50 cal mini gun is equally not realistic and and not fun, I find.
---
I have a heck of a time getting caps... do you mostly get them by selling scrap out of your vendors?
---
You mean bitcaps.
---
No it isn't. It's intended.
---
The Xmas gifts give better rewards than these damn Atlas Provisions.
---
No. But it did look good with the SS armor over the top.
---
Fortnite mode
---
Have you tried blowing up the resource collector with a flamethrower trap, building through it, then repairing it?
---
I used lights to write 'twat' on a wall by Beckett's bar. Totally worth the budget.
---
That‚Äôs a fair point, maybe they could make a BoS Officer outfit or something...
---
Super Hitachi, even the bext camp over gets off.
---
Restart the game
---
But that would create a solution a design problem they intended
---
That's why people want the plan, because it drops as legendary when you learn the plan!
---
That reminds me of what Settler Forager always says üòÇ
---
I agree with you there. The BoS Officer underarmor is dope, especially if you‚Äôre going for a melee build. Although the SS underarmor is now the best for melee - it offers 4 strength, 2 perception and 2 endurance iirc. It could be 4,2,4.
---
His is different. He has redish pants where the brotherhood fatigues are full blue camo
---
Shared account storage for most stuff. And ability to at least move SS equipment between characters.
---
Because this game is still designed like a 2000s Era game
---
I should‚Äôve said, I‚Äôve dropped all my loot trying to see if getting killed would break me out of photo mode. It did not. Any other suggestions? I know I can get the boot back but this is fucking annoying.
---
Right but I was talking purely cosmetic. Tbh I had no idea about those buffs ha.
---
Also, I should clarify that I‚Äôm only suggesting a marker for where a legendary item is. Not filling the screen with a sea of icons to let me know where all 40k mole miner masks are.
---
[Weapon Damage](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) I recommend this website.
---
What does purple taste like?
---
Have a friend pick up your look, so you can restart. If not i believe your screwed ive had a similar glitch before except it was with a terminal menu instead.
---
Of course we do
---
Final word blows it away. Pun intended. AA, as long as your target has armor, is +28.8% damage. TS, as long as you hit both shots, is +25% damage. TS also degrades durability of the weapon faster
---
That is fake propaganda from the guys who chose a Asylum as their base and got their ass handled to them  
---
(This message is brought to you by the Enclave)
---
I've had very little success with my vendor.
---
I'm surprised actually, that the game has been out for this long, and yet there are precious few online resources to help with the pricing of various items.
---
Too many water purifiers. I needed two. Really.
---
Kill everything in one area beside one enemy(a super mutant lvl 68 maybe as it's a common enemy) and try approaching it with and without the chameleon piece equipped. You'll see chameleon is just a visual for pvp. In pve all you need is to reach sneak 90(sneak perk lvl 3 + 1 piece harder to detect,a fixer,or thorn set. 75+15). Really high agility,like 30+,can have the same result.
---
Yes, yes, those fucking Raiders, always up to no good! \*shifty eyes\*
---
And on top of that TS has a nasty accuracy and recoil penalty.
---
I mean they are pretty rare. I'm level 170 and only found one once. Maybe twice. Thats pretty rare. 
---
The buff is also kinda lame!
---
That's partly the reason I rush over to the Queen and have my Fixer ready so I know I can get a hit in just in case
---
The best way to do this if you're one of these players is to wait until she mutates then go ahead
---
How better to commemorate our time in the game than a completely nonfunctional and forgotten cosmetic? It literally sums up the entire game from launch until now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Certainly would, I see a lot of people selling .50 for way more than 5.56. The conversion is 0.7 .50 for every 5.56 round in the converter.
---
Y Tho?
---
You'll get continuously wrecked by those no-lifers that have marsupial and bird bones mutations along with a triple legendary assassin's explosive automatic handmade that has 90% weight reduction.
---
Except Operation Touchdown wasn't Maxson's idea? The BoS used it as their last resort to defeat the scorched after losing contact with Maxson and Lost Hills and the Free States and Responders got wiped out
---
I think the buff should be more. I've only found 4 total. 
---
I found 2 the day I posted this and only 2 since
---
Nuclear Winter
---
I saw somewhere that based on damage and enemy's resistance to damage, two shot is about a 25%dmg increase while AA is about 30%. I use a tse gat plasma with a beam splitter so the beam splitter adds a ton of beams, 1 shot is 4 projectiles in this instance. I got lucky with it being an explosive as the explosive effect gives each projectile splash damage.   Imo AA is great for faster fire rate or explosive if you're not spraying mobs, ts if you don't aim much firing into crowds of enemies as it suffers from accuracy, both projectiles need to hit the target for the damage increase. I use either really
---
Absofuckinlutely get those flux into your stash asapüòÇ
---
This isn't for pvp. It's for adventure mode gameplay
---
Cranberry cobbler all the way heh
---
Next month? Uh, I doubt it.
---
"Chose an asylum for a base and got their ass handed to them" like heroes. üòÅ Unlike the Enclave Elites who died fighting over sugar bombs in their mommy's basement. üòú
---
Ad Victoriam
---
...wtf?
---
of course it's not gonna work, you're moving. chameleon/invisibility does affect pve.
---
sneak is also not as simple as that. nobody knows exactly how much HTD, fixer or thorn adds. supposedly the bonus it's equivalent to one shadowed piece, but nobody reversed the executable to confirm it.
---
case in point, HTD does not stack. although it could be bugged, but still.
---
Well, he discovered how to not hate life in the wasteland!
---
Like orange
---
haha
---
It certainly wouldn't have been as interesting if the Enclave didn't release the Scorched Plague in the first place. \*Dr. Evil pinky finger\*
---
This about happened this morning to me, but I was using the gauss rifle. Downed the guy and went to headshot him but I was a bit too close and put myself at about 5% health.
---
Hey keep your FACTS out of my shitpost against the Brotherhood

-signed by the propaganda department of the enclave
---
you mean roger. arthur was the elder in fallout 4. and he was an asshole.
---
It doesn‚Äôt really matter from a reward standpoint. Just get both factions to the decision point and pick the one that best fits your characters background and story. You can get both to ally in quick fashion by doing random encounters.
---
Nocturnal, bash damage Plasma Caster.
---
If you feel it costs a lot to buy and craft a card idk if you are ready to do the event
---
Sorry, didn't realize this was a shitpost
---
Nuclear Winter, its essentially a Battle Royale
---
Assaultron heads no longer give circuits.
---
That being said I agree that other players shouldn't be able to start it, maybe if they are in your party or something
---
Haha you're right. I messed up!
---
What were you waiting for?
---
My other 2 fusion generators. ;)
---
Overly oxidized grape drink.
---
Level 280, over 2200hrs in. My ‚Äúgoal‚Äù for a lot of this time has been building the best base I‚Äôve ever seen in this game. That‚Äôs kept me busy learning new building techniques, learning new plans, etc. There‚Äôs so much that comes with that goal that playing has been a blast from beginning til now. Seeing reactions from other players and giving tours of my camp daily has been pretty fun. I don‚Äôt care much about min/maxing or having the best gear, just care about being strong enough to solo most events. Rarely do silos or scorched earth as there‚Äôs not many building plans to learn there.
---
Prepare to die, mutie.

taggerdy: "we wanna use nukes"

I sold my ultracite power armor a few weeks ago. I had the liberty prime shadow skin on it and renamed it "Ultra" so i could easily find it and use it when swapping out PAs. So someone wanted it and bought it for 10k, so I removed the skin and handed over the pieces, then dropped the frame. Sold and done. 
---
A couple days ago I startes missing it, mostly because it was the only PA that had a jetpack for me. Lo and behold, I went into a public word late at night and was clearing out my stash box, and there it was. Ultra sitting there under apparel. 
---
I oulled it out and looked it over. Shadow liberty prime skin, jetpack on the torso mod, full ultracite PA. 
---
Damn dupers.....
---
For more people to join. He just happend to be the first one to join
---
well that sounds like a personal problem.
---
Yeah but it's almost like, don't be wearing unyielding when you craft. Rolled 40 left arms and 10 torso, in one go. Not one piece of unyielding. Oh my poor stash, won't be doing that again
---
Bahaha I love the clumsy moments of the game.
---
i have problems with fast travel in general. have to point minimum 3,4 times to ft
---
Add me and I‚Äôll sell you one nukakayla91
---
Did you pay a lot for those plans? Cause both grafton vendors sell the arms, legs, and torso for under 90c each
---
Yeah, this patch is an absolute shit show
---
But I don‚Äôt disagree with you that the person who loaded the card should be the one to kick it off.
---
I've tried to solo it but no luck. I'm a bloodied build so having all 3 pylons on me is dangerous.
---
No. Just like gifts and miner pails didn‚Äôt disappear.
---
Stay at the terminal yourself, that way you block others from using it
---
my guess is energy ammo and crappy energy weapons. kinda like how the raider one gives us ballistic ammo and crappy guns.
---
maybe a secondary option that gathers "tech" related junk, like circuit boards, batteries, magnets and shit.
---
Solar. With how Dr works in this game you are better off with the extra healing effect
---
It was visually tested and I agree that htd doesn't stack,that's why 1 piece is enough.
---
I went from  1 chameleon to a thorn set and did see an improvement.
---
Also standing invisible is quite useless,specially in crowded events with many enemies coming from all sides.
---
Bloodied is damn hard with the pylons tanking your health.
---
I run a full set of TS armor and a Vampire Gauss Mini. I can solo her in under 2 mins.
---
I think a lot of people are underestimating the value of this.
---
You can't cook a lot of things with purified water, you need boiled.
---
Having a lot of these placed will save you the time of spam collecting out of water sources or dealing with extra rads.
---
It definitely has its place as a convenience CAMP tool.
---
Same
---
Yet another thread blaming player's for Bethesda's broken game mechanic.
---
I‚Äôve seen them all over map him and another one is always with him. It‚Äôs nothing new. Maybe it was a Easter egg for bos idk
---
Perks? Mutations?
---
What perks and armor do you have?
---
Two shot does more damage but the vats accuracy can be a bit random
---
AA does less Damage but vats accuracy has no penalty 
---
Even against the queen the two shot will do more damage
---
I recently mentioned it too, Vault 8 was also of control and founded Vault City, we, who are the best in America can do something better and more incredible
---
I run a bloodied weapon and 1 shot almost everything. Bashing is the only way I can tag at events like Uranium Fever
---
My last Line In The Sand event the scorched spawned right next to the machine in a big group and one guy with explosive 50 cal destroyed them before I could kill one. Thankfully he couldn't down the Legendary SB right away so I got some shots on.
---
Lmao. I have a pic very similar to this I‚Äôll put in this thread next time it shows on my loading screen.
---
"just...why"
---
It's Roger in this, Arthur isn't around until 190 years later. And the reason he's an idealist, is because being a Captain in the US Army is still very fresh in his mind. He saw the atrocities at Mariposa and wanted to prevent anything like that form happening again. In the years leading up to the war, he also viewed that the government had failed it's people, and that now it was their duty to form a new order to preserve civilization. Unfortunately, 58 years later he would die from cancer.
---
I can't imagine what it's like trying to get stuff done in a game studio right now. A shut down, having to work from home? Not everyone on your team is going to have the ability to do their work from home. Stuff being delayed isn't an issue for me, either. Updates having bugs, all that, seems like it was bound to continue to happen with everything going on.
---
I've got the raider punk so I'd call him Moochy Mcwon'tShutup
---
Well according to the notes from the  OP they want to do a bit of ‚Äúfan service‚Äù so perhaps we could see the regular Sniper Rifle, Anti-Material Rifle or the (prototype/M72?) Gauss Rifle from FO3/NV, which also looks a million times better than the FO4/76 model Gauss Rifle. I guess they could also dig even deeper like they did for Gauss Minigun and add the Pulse Rifle with perhaps some sniper rifle barrel modification
---
I ended up leaving and losing my loot. Thanks for the reply. Have a great day dude.
---
HTD is not the same as chameleon. you can have any legendary armor prefix drop with HTD.
---
I also never argued whether it was useful. but saying that "chameleon is purely visual and pvp only" is flat out wrong.
---
and unlike HTD, chameleon does stack by the way. with a full set you can stand in the middle of any group of enemies without being detected. its usefulness is debatable considering that yes, you can't move. but it does work.
---
Maggie is a tragic story. She tried to do what was right in a very difficult situation.
---
Thorpe and the original Raider gangs were closer to Blood Eagles in their mentality, very much not like the DieHards.
---
Use the terminal yourself and don‚Äôt exit it, that way you block others from using it
---
If it was intended they would have no reason to look into it
---
Nop
---
Yes and no, I sell the scrap mentioned above, plus higher end legendary gear (mostly bloodied/junkies/furious/AA). I have pretty good gear all around so for me I need end game stuff or at least something I can trade for it, so anything really good goes into the vault for trades and anything decent goes to the vendor and anything else goes for scrip. I don‚Äôt sell gear everyday but not everyone has 3-7k caps to drop on a weapon.
---
You know those two tower looking things on the bottom of the map, they look like two giant antenna tower things. Well I used to go all the way to the top and jump off and survive. 
---
I had goat legs, and bird bones. Max health obviously and the perk ‚ÄúLife giver‚Äù
---
It was a funny little gag to do with my friends. I‚Äôd lie and say if you drank boiled water right before you jumped off you would survive. When my friends saw that I survive they would jump after me. Obviously I‚Äôd revive them. 
---
#1 prankster here.
---
Would be nice. Instead of Sand Adobes, we get log cabin with a Vault-Tec flair. High 50's tech combined with homey cabin town. Would love that aesthetic.
---
The drop chance is about 5%. I did it 35 times until I got the plan. Unlucky me :'(
---
Yes, just switched my build up to all those but gun fu, need to steal another point to make that happen haha.  It is really good!
---
Right, it's annoying you basically have to sit at the computer(Which blocks the ability to see the map btw) so you have no idea how many people are there but there's an overenthusiastic low level(Or new player that hasn't seen it yet) trying to start it up!
---
Me neither
---
I agree, and he‚Äôs letting the devs know not ‚Äú you‚Äù, which is actually something we should all do.
---
I own two accounts, dropped first months ago and quit playing again.  
---
This game needs less atom shop bs and more major overhauls without bugs PLUS a serious commitment to stopping cheaters cold.
---
But why?
---
I‚Äôve met 4 since launch. Which is pretty okay.
---
Do you have two armor pieces with 50% fall damage reduced perks? That‚Äôs the only way to completely negate fall damage. Other combinations of goat legs, one perk, and/or bird bones only reduce fall damage (sometimes a lot or completely) but it‚Äôs not guaranteed to negate completely.
---
I have a full set of troubleshooters armor that I use only for this event and AWOL armaments. Not strictly necessary but does wonders for survivability.
---
Yeah, I was originally super stoked and kept going into camera mode trying to obtain a picture of this clown clothes wearing creature
---
Mhm... It broke my heart when I found her holotape...
---
Thanks :)
---
Have no perks that make my get les fall damage, my armor is full unyielding and one chameleon and don‚Äôt have any star that reduces fall damage my mutations are adrenal reaction

---
I'll help if your still on? This one is fun.
---
^this
---
How many ppl can be in 1 lobby like 25? What if they knocked it down to 15 or 20 per lobby? Surely that would give ppl a good boost to camp budget.
---
Many times, victory can be measured with the smallest things. It sounds like you are getting there. I wish I had something a bit more useful to say for you, but keep at it. Ad Victoriam.
---
Ever had a grape flavored anything? Does that taste like any grapes you ever ate? No, that is actually purple flavor.
---
Certain food can completely heal you for more than the 3 pylons damage you.
---
Well is sure won't change idea after testing myself how useless chameleon is on a fresh lvl 5 character without sneak perks,   so we can can just stop talking as we're both hitting a wall.
---
I see more players in power armor w heavy weapons than stealth commandos. On Xbox at least. Being bloodied in power armor is really nice you hardly ever die and still have that high damage
---
The Blackwater Bandits, also a tragic story,
---
Because I also want to use that workshop. Fusion cores, I can get from any of the three power plants so I will go for one that‚Äôs not already occupied. Ammo, well. The ammo factory is the only reliable way to farm pre-made ammo, discounting the ammunition factory blueprint glitch. Hemlock holes is the best workshop for acid, because I like sitting idle while I browse Reddit for five minutes, and it keeps producing even while I kill cave crickets. What else do I take... Oh yeah. I also take the workshop that produces rad free food, *unless* it‚Äôs already been taken by someone who‚Äôs sub level 50.
---
Yes but without communication you have no idea if your teammates showed up or anyone for that matter.
---
I'm a bit confused on the whole limit reset thing? What does that mean and why does 250+ burnt books matter? Lol. I'm still getting used to the game and loot run paths like this are super fucking helpful.
---

I saw one the other day that looked like a literal dollhouse. Like open on one side with a ton of floors that were all themed differently. Even had a big sign with those rare (at least I can‚Äôt find them) lighted letters, ‚ÄúThe Dollhouse.‚Äù I thought it was super cool. I spent a good half an hour just chilling out and taking in the scenery.
---
I rarely get that. But I guess when It does happen I won't mind too much
---
So? Just wait until timer is down to whatever you think is reasonable and start it. 
---
Or pop out of the terminal, check map and immediately block the terminal again.
---
Start at full health and by the time you grab the last pylon your a bloodied build again, and smoke that mama-jama.
---
Was this last week on Flatwoods? I did this with a guy and downed him with a supersledge finally, then went to execute... point blank with a gauss shotgun.
---
I almost choked from laughing so hard.
---
A med clinic. Rad shower, chems and foods, etc.
---
I did jump of there and didn‚Äôt die but I don‚Äôt have any perks active
---
Same here. I claim them daily and don‚Äôt even think about pvp. It rarely happens. Even when o see another player, I just wave and it‚Äôs usually a friendly interaction. I practice new building techniques there a lot so I‚Äôll usually start by building underground. That makes it harder for others to find me if they are wanting to pvp. And if they are trying to contest and attempt to go underground, I‚Äôve got them right at the stairs.
---
The hell, did they add explosive shotguns to NW? I've never taken damage from my own weapons, aside from missles and grenades.
---
May introduce the other side: robotic expert, basher, awareness, last laugh, and overly generous
---
Are you in console? I'm on xbox maybe I can go through my inventory see if I have anything that will help you out
---
They won't because there needs to be undesirable shitty effects as to muddy the loot pull.
---
Interesting, I had watched a YouTube video on it and they said the drop chance was 80%
---
Rad Zone runs will be a chore, also look out for bear traps now they're a real hazard.
---
I just sell scrip for like, 350 max. Then I sell the good weapons for around 1000-6000 depending on the rolls. Like, bloodied weapons will SELL. But if it‚Äôs something stupid like a bone hammer it‚Äôll go for like 300-600. Other than that I sell scrip armor for even less. And the harder to obtain resources like glowing mass for 125-150 and fluids for 125-150. Inert flux for 10 and purified water for 5 because flux is much better due to its reduced weight and slight disease resistance. I also sell stable flux for 150 minimum (but that‚Äôs usually the price anyway). Some random stuff like barbs, proboscis, glands, and stingers for people trying to do that tadpole daily. Some ammo, all at 1 cap except for .45 and 5.56 because they‚Äôre in high demand at 2 caps each. Sometimes some bulk junk if anybody needs it (price depends on junk type). Also hardened mass for 50 each. That‚Äôs about it.
---
I've done this myself, was so proud I won the fight only to off myself i just sat there shaking my head
---
Serendipity can proc making you take 0 fall damage, maybe that
---
Good point. I just can't wave as people show up. I could probably live without that.
---
We have heard this kind of bullshit over and over and things are the same.  I don't want to hear about what's  going to happen.  Fix it or don't fix it. Don't babble about how you are going to fix it in some far off distant future.  The damn game has been out for over   a year.  We have reached the point where it should just be running right  Instead we are getting more empty promises.
---
Now i am curious what your base looks like :3
---
I love building, but just not big enough of a budget and stash size without Fallout 1st.
---
I am currently collecting all the rare/clean junk items and outfits and have a bunch of display cases, but always run out of space somehow.
---
Also still really mad at the recent C.A.M.P. change from this patch. I havent even gotten to the point where i could use the workarounds i saw in building tutorial videos ;_;
---
Got some pics of your camp?

1 run through riding shotgun nets you all the caps you need for the day plus a bit extra. anyone level 30+ can do it. Takes 10 minutes at most and saves camp budget.
---
I'm good, literally just after this post RNGesus smiled on me and handed me an explosive junkie 50 cal. It's no bloodied but good enough for me.
---
you're free to do so. I'm simply pointing out that you're wrong. it's up to you to consider it, or not.
---
I've been playing sneak since the game was first released and still learning about it. last week I got told by someone who swore by chameleon.
---
so I replaced my unyielding/HTD set with a chameleon/HTD one and went for a spin. and lo and behold, enemies were having a much harder time spotting me. even the CSS didn't compare.
---
granted, I couldn't move an inch without getting detected. but still. another thing to consider is that a couple weeks back I got in an argument with someone who swore HTD stacked, because he had been playing without the sneak perk for 50 levels and thus it was **impossible** that it didn't.
---
he ended up blocking me when I posted video proof that it in fact did not. placebo is one hell of a drug.
---
Go for a fire station. With a pole, garage doors, squad bay, etc.
---
You know I have to hand it to the challenges on the Legendary Run that everybody complains about. For a game mode which I avoided like the plague I have actually gotten an appreciation for it and the players I've watched after my always certain death. Had a hilarious encounter with a player that spawned in the exact same spot. I raced over to a crate and managed to get a machete as he desperately tried to punch me to death. I managed to hack him to death first. Still chuckle about it to this day.
---
The server remembers the last 180 world items you picked up, and won't spawn items you've picked up until they drop off the list. The number is contested, but it's generally considered to be 180-250ish items, I think.
---
Yes but I did put it out of my perks to test it
---
?? I usually always end up with over screen full of different ammo's.
---
[Here‚Äôs a walkthrough from 2 months ago.](https://youtu.be/w29Bz12ZL5E) Some stuff has changed (floor types, wallpaper, entire underground storage room, etc.) but it‚Äôs basically the same layout as now. It‚Äôs 2x max budget with an old glitch, but there are still build budget glitches floating around...
---
Do something else until beth fix it eventually
---
Then I wouldn‚Äôt complain.
---
There is somewhat of a solution to this. Using a cryolator. Don‚Äôt know what kind it was someone was using since I didn‚Äôt see them, but it made the fight much easier considering how slow she was in the air.
---
Who told you we died :P ? We are fine and dandy, recruiting people to join us in our Air Conditioned "mommy's basement" while we have access to nukes and other weapons of mass destruction, along with a very neat set of prototype power armor
---
Enclave&gt;BoS
---
This was one of my favourite areas, reminded me of the great underground sections in fallout 3.  Haven‚Äôt done the area yet, it‚Äôs next in my list.
---
I'm a fairly new player (just hit 35) so I'm not really too worried about junk runs yet. That said, I want to use energy weapons, but I haven't come across an abundance of them in the wild (to scrap for mod unlocks). Creating them myself is rough because some of the materials are in short supply (mainly fiber optics, nuclear material, and crystal).  
---
Is there a good place for those or perhaps the guns themselves? Or should I give up on until I'm a higher level?
---
My fav is killing a 3 star scorch queen and being rewarded a one star rolling pin or board. 
---
The loot tables are so messed up in this title.
---
Ah. I see... So making the last 250 items burnt books and then server hopping should make all the other junk I've picked up spawn again? Is that how it works? Sorry for the questions. The way the community breaks down the game and figures things out blows my mind.
---
3, 6, 9 ... well waddaya know?
---
Imagine the loot pool without mob effects, bash dmg and +AGI/PER. I'm dribbling just thinking about it
---
solar or thorn
---
while the DR/ER of SS is higher, it slowly becomes more useless the higher you raise those stats because of diminishing returns.  the saving grace of it is the jetpack
---
thorn gives you a boost to sneak which may be looking into to help keep you hidden/caution longer
---
solar's self heal is great since it is the only passive heal that works in combat (bloodied regen got fixed)  once you hit the point of diminish return it really helps out more than small boost the extra dr/er gives
---
Yes I‚Äôve seen this she slows down and literally almost freezes in the air. It‚Äôs always a good time when someone shows up with a cryolator.
---
Damn.only explosive heavy I ever got was a berserker. Lol hope it does you good
---
The only explanation I can think of is, you might have armor that reduces Falling damage by 50%
---
Maybe you have two of those pieces?
---
Sometimes when mine registers damage it‚Äôll be a large drop then the health will spike back up. Really annoying because I‚Äôll one hit something for 900 dmg which is enough to kill anything that‚Äôs not a sb or sbq and immediately look to the next one to find 3 seconds later a lvl 5 ghoul in the penitentiary swiping at me with 1 health left
---
Mommy Modus told me that. The AC is nice though I must admit. Tell me... We can keep it between us. The cakes a lie right?
---
Didn‚Äôt even realize it was s‚Äôposed to have a mask...
---
Now I gotta look into it,Lol
---
I had something similar happen, but I wiped a team of three. I got two, and the last was trying to melee me. And then I down both them and myself with the gauss rifle.
---
Who needs challenging, well-designed boss fights and good A.I. when you could have wonky looting instead?  
---
So hardcore.
---
Yea i wouldn't normally make the mistake of confusing them. To be completely honest I had just woken up and was perusing the subreddit while being very sleepy.
---
Yeah I usually sell my excess legendaries for mad cheap in my vendors and label the vendor ‚Äúcheap scrip‚Äù
---
I'd kill for the game to give me the option to tell Rose/Meg that David was a clown and they are his clown circus.
---
Croc backpack plan is worth well over the 30k cap limit these days.
---
Same. I either use explosive splash damage or swap to a low damage gun like a tesla to bring attention to the mob so I don't obstruct line of sight
---
They can be very helpful in certian tasks. Like for example if you want to learn the Radium Riffle mods (cringe) there is a magazine that reduces cost. If you want to walk away from Line in the Sand with 5k in steal, G&amp;B5 is your friend. Better criticals magazine rocks the queen if your playing solo. 
---
The are very specific but very helpful in various situations.
---
Nope, but they really should sell a recolor of it on the Atom Shop. I'm surprised they didn't last Fasnacht.
---
Does mt. Blair give any good ores. It just says ore [1]
---
Yh was thinking about the brother hood of steel questline. Is what it is...
---
You are running without power armor which means you aren't maximize the damage.  And you can't.
---
The only reason we don‚Äôt wear it is because the Brotherhood isn‚Äôt really around so it‚Äôs kind of pointless. When the Brotherhood comes back damn right I‚Äôm going to want to tout my exclusive Elder‚Äôs coat in front of all the initiates ;)
---
Crouch.
---
Just crouch.
---
It "should." My notes at the end of the run before the edit point out it didn't for me when I went back to check some of the later items, but if I do the run from start to finish all the items spawn. Yeah, there's people much smarter than I doing all that lol. I just took stuff I learned from different places and applied it.
---
I‚Äôve been selling plans at 10% of the listed price, so if the game says it‚Äôs 250c I price it at 25c. Outfits I sell at the listed price. All ammo at 1c and even then I don‚Äôt move it too much.
---
I love the Bow. I am confused though as VATS says 95% chance to hit and It misses over and over. Can you test that and fix it? Side note.. If you could actually add what is stated in the patch notes like SS armor mods and the drops you said where added (they are not).
---
Thanks! Please dont break more stuff this time. Also add some content... Its getting real stale.
---
I loved the custom ammo u could make in fonv
---
The amount of bash weapons I've had from the queen can confirm this
---
Agreed.
---
I'm also simply pointing out that you're wrong and,as you said, none of us have any proof beside our personal testing. That guy may have had really high agilty which would taint any test.
---
What are you selling?  Location is also very important.
---
I remember doing that once, I was fighting a guy and after I downed him I didn‚Äôt realize how low my health was and ended up killing my self. Good times.
---
Happens to me also all the time, I do a thumbs down and wack them on the head 1 time üòÇ
---
Have you gone into the silo and made your way to the launch control room?
---
That's always fun! Usually I just switch weapons to avoid getting too close, then get a lag spike and die anyways lmao
---
And as they said, this has been an unprecedented year. Many devs can‚Äôt even get a stable connection to play the game. While there‚Äôs always been bugs, Bethesda jumped on a lot of those after launch to make sure the game ran well. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs exactly fair to say ‚Äúlook at what Bethesda has done during a pandemic,‚Äù and then claim that they will never live up to anything they‚Äôre claiming because we‚Äôve seen the company at its worse.
---
And to clarify, I also work in a field that has seen little trouble transitioning to working at home. Communication alone was practically next to null for a full month for us. Wastelanders was the last update we saw that wasn‚Äôt greatly affected by the virus and that was concerned the revival of f76.
---
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with being hopeful and lenient when most people‚Äôs lives have been completely turned around.
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
I cant, the elevator at site alpha requires the hand scan but its rejecting me
---
I have cushioned legs (50% damage reduction each) and another armor piece that reduces falling damage and bird bones.  I still die. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Gonna have to put it to the test later. I'm in dire need of screws and acid lol. Thanks for your help, bro. You're one of the ones that make this shitty game a pleasure to play.
---
if you fast travel to someone's camp are you going to wait for another load screen to go in to their shelter to look at their collection items?
---
I need more coffee
---
Ah yes. It happens to us all.
---
YouTube
---
Siiick burrrns
---
&gt;FOMO is valuable as a means of double dipping.
---
This is true, but in Bethesda‚Äôs case they don‚Äôt want to endorse the idea that you won‚Äôt buy something just so you can buy it later (i.e. a terrible business practice from a profit perspective). Push the FOMO so many people buy it and become afraid of letting it slip by without a chance to obtain in the future. If they stick by that, then people learn to respect that business model and hopefully won‚Äôt miss out next time.
---
And it has a private lift to club, the only golf club in the wasteland.
---
tried, nobody has the info I'm looking for but thank you :D
---
it also cost me a month to grind up to raider and 750 bullion
---
It would help with reducing the server/system load.
---
That could be it for me, I'm going to have to bite the bullet and perform a full Fallout76 re install, maybe something broke with the last patch.
---
It would make the gauss minigun even more op.
---
Are you a general in the enclave?
---
The harpers ferry vendor has those advanced power connectors if you‚Äôre not having luck with grahm or watoga
---
Bank would be awesome. How is there not an atm of sorts in whitespring. You could even pay a transaction fee of 10% like vending
---
the SS jetpack is game changing
---
you become that after you beat the training camp stuff and get that enclave outfit, yeah?
---
This is not new, I have been dealing with for months. I feel your pain. I'm just glad others are feeling mine because I thought I was alone in this.
---
You don't need a top tier weapon for 98 percent of   situations.   Using an Ultracite Gatling or Gauss minigun for everyday use against common enemies is impractical and a waste of ammo.
---
im bloodied and always in the stealth suit;)
---
And you have a code piece for Alpha?
---
It‚Äôs been a while since I did my initial run, but I think you have to have a code piece on you to get in the first time?  Not sure though. 
---
Perhaps someone else with more recent experience can help.  It may also be worth checking
---
Yep PC, I'm thinking that is my problem, Bethesda must be having a hard time getting these patched in sync between platforms. I'll need to do a full re install I think. üòí
---
We don‚Äôt call him Slick for nothin‚Äô!
---
I just love that area as a whole. Never know who you might meet or what you might find. It‚Äôs also fun running around inside the various buildings there, grabbing all the clothing hangers and golf outfits!
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
Gt- WarmCrescent867. I‚Äôll be on shortly if you wanna play. Cheers.
---
Lmao you know it‚Äôs someone who has shit vending traffic that downvoted this.
---
Can‚Äôt remember. Do you have access to look for vertibirds and silo codes?
---
Nerd Rage, best stealth perks, lots of agility, Thorn armor is good but Unyielding is better (Unyielding Thorn is the best), Bloodied Fixer is ideal, Adrenal Reaction (like you said). I also recommend most of the other mutations offset by 3 star Class Freak, then join a team and equip Strange in Numbers perk. You can also craft a bunch of Ballistic Bock and equip Party Boy perk if you're in the mood. Oh, and as always, Bloody Mess. You will one-shot just about everything except boss legendaries.
---
I wouldn't mind a 10% charge just for ease of use but knowing them, it'll be a Fallout 1st or extra cost per month
---
You can youtube or if you're on xbox put a post. It would prob be easier to have some one run you through it once and you'll be a pro!
---
That would be nice to, maybe a mauve pillar of transcendence for every meat pile?
---
I sides raiders so I could screw them over. 
---
Got a pretty.good chuckles seeing those entitled asshats get pissed off and do nothing. 
---
Also the questline is better.
---
&gt;But the will definitely bring it back at some point.
---
I sure hope not. Exclusive items are the only thing that really keep my interest in this game nowadays with the permanent content being relatively lackluster and repetitive.
---
I had that on one character. Turn off the game and when you restart make sure you do the t fuse first and then go to the computer
---
Buff it buff it buff it!
---
Or, as a Hispanic man once put it at some sort of sports conference:
---
"Sometimes, maybe good sometimes maybe shit"
---
I'll see if I can get anybody, thank you :D
---
Definitely would be fallout first feature lmao. They create ‚ÄúFallout first+‚Äù
---
Rank two of one of the science perk cards reduces the materials required to make energy weapons. Makes them cheaper to build.
---
Yes!
---
[Nuke codes](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
Hear, hear!
---
Screw the mini gun. The ArmCo machine was the deciding factor.
---
yeah I did that whole thing and have everything I need, 8 pieces of the code and a keycard.
---
Plans: 9c
---
Ammo: 1c
---
Plasma/Fusion Cores (90% or better): 40c
---
Legendary Weapons/Armor: 50% of the low Fed76 estimate
---
junk: if I have room free, else I dump it in the bag
---
unlocked water purifiers and ammo machine set to shot gun
---
I keep a few other things in the vendor at a absurd rate just so that I light up all the categories.
---
I want to see that bashing weapon perk become a legit viable thing instead of throw away garbage.
---
I check the atom shop weekly, but it still shows an empty space where it should be... I doubt it will ever surface.
---
yeah I have 8 of the code pieces for alpha.
---
You have to be a general. Follow abbies bunker questlune, eventually you'll get 'one of us'and then the 'officer on deck ' where you have to do commendations for MODUS.
---
The only issue I can thing of is the fire rate not being close to 200. Either that or you‚Äôre on a private server and magic isn‚Äôt procing as easy.
---
Gauss shotgun was added with Wastelanders expansion, often found in orange crates. I die to it often
---
Yeah, its all through Bethesda so your character should be good, I think the only thing that doesn't transfer are your atoms.
---
I think you can keep your character but think your atoms Will not transfer. Note: not sure about this
---
I can post proof if you want, like I did with the HTD guy. just not now, in a couple days.
---
agility is also a crucial part of sneak so I'm not sure what you're talking about.
---
This is for your problem with the elevator, beyond that, once you get in the silo, it's just combat
---
I'd love it. I'd actually keep a bash weapon for stuff like whitespings etc
---
Hell no, I dont want hacked items on xbox. Maybe ps4 and xbox 1 but no one wants the console games to become full of impossible items like handmades with splitters that shoot mini nukes
---
You say that, but you don't consider how much the nukes in Fo76 aren't realistic due gameplay reasons. Lorewise going with nukes would've mean if they fail, Appalachia would've became a lifeless waste where the schorched could've grown unbothered because nobody else would've a chance to go there and stop them.
---
Odd. If you‚Äôve unlocked the war room and listened to the pictures on the wall of how to drop a nuke the handprint should work because you would be a general. Wish I could help.
---
oh yeah I did those, I'm on the I Am Become Death one, it says "Launch a nuke from any silo [Decrypted launch code required]
---
Wait, can you explain this to me?
---
run maxed blocker.. Ignoring 45% incoming melee damage is huge in this game..
---
I rarely get any pole hooks that are more than a 1* in events. I'm not getting "good" pole hooks but I'll keep that in mind when I need stuff to stock the machines.
---
yeah maybe it got screwed up or something, and you did help because now I realize maybe I didnt mess up. thank you
---
Nukacrypt.com has the weekly silo codes. They are deciphered. I would say your problem with that silo is that it‚Äôs still in cool down mode. Try another server or another silo.
---
True but it happened twice in a row, on two different words, this morning, which pushed me over the edge!
---
Refine your build to be as effective as possible, by trimming our perks and gear and mutations and even your food selections. Get them to the point that they‚Äôre practically a NPC. 
---
Then make a totally different character and try a different approach. I went from a Heavy Gunner/Shotgunner Full Health build (get into close-to-medium range and unleash Hell in large chunks) to a Junkie‚Äôs Melee Sprinter (Leroy Jenkins FTW) to a Bloodied Stealth Sniper (Silent Death from Afar). 
---
And then I made my Chef and his restaurant!  Started getting into building my camp in creative ways. 
---
There‚Äôs a lot of options.
---
I have been look into but I‚Äôm afraid about my carry weight maybe
---
Np. Hope you get it figured out.
---
Now that I think about it, wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if we had the Vertibot landing pads or something like that for our camp and it can fly us places, maybe not like fast travel, it will take time to fly, but not like going on foot, could be a bullion reward
---
A church dedicated to the Overseer
---
Ahahaha. I had match where I was down on my knees waiting for death. Accepted it, and was just hoping a teammate could scurry by and save my ass. I ended up dying, but before that happened my killer jumped down off the building ledge... and into the storm, and immediately died. Was amazing.
---
alright, I have the code I'll try another silo, do I go to the Sites or to the portapotty thing
---
But if anything helps I‚Äôll keep blocker
---
I think once they‚Äôre confident duping loopholes are closed they‚Äôll consider releasing 4 &amp; 5 Star legendaries to make the duped ones useless.
---
Check your Missile Status Holotape, if you have one. If the silo is still on cool down you can‚Äôt get in.
---
Interesting, I was able to go right into the elevator after I finished commendations. I'm sure you just wanna launch it lol. Maybe go back and talk to MODUS again
---
Haha, oof
---
An angry woman...it all make sense now.
---
tried that, not sure what's happening but it sure isnt fun.
---
I've never, ever encountered anything similar to that on PC. I'm guessing there are as I've seen many people mentioning this but have yet to encounter any, or see any videos of anything as absurd as what you just mentioned haha. Please share if you've got a vid or two. 
---
They're not as common as you think, at least from my personal experience.
---
Do whatever you want,nothing you can do can truly change my idea.
---
Search for ‚Äúfallout 76 where to farm all the things‚Äù it‚Äôs a great document that has lots of loot locations
---
Its one of the pr√©fixe that makes shotgun do crazy damages in VATS
---
They're already useless, but no they won't become more useless.
---
You don‚Äôt need fallout 1st. 
---
Build is personal preference. 
---
You do not need power armor, though I usually use in nuke zones.
---
Always keep your tent near and get ready to 1 tap super mutants and charred ghouls.
---
there was 0 time on each silo, have no idea what that means, did have the tape though
---
Lol ran it with my buddy, just the two of us started it grabbed the pylons between me and him we killed it in about 15 seconds, the best part about it, was when other people showed up after it was dead, imma 238 and he is a 120 something but I provided him with his current load out, so hes pretty set, so after I ran a silo and killed the queen in about 5 mins
---
I'm a veteran player and don't have the capital to buy serum recipes
---
I have one, it says there is 0 time on each, what does that mean?
---

---
You better ask Bethesda support to be sure because thier system is a mess...
---
I have too Bethesda accounts. I bought Fallout 76 on both of them... On "account A" I bought the game directly from Bethesda site and I launch it via Beth launcher. On "account B" I bought the game from Steam and I launch it via Steam.
---
If I use my "account B" login and password in the Beth laucnher it shows me like I didn't own the game.
---
If I use my "account B" login and password ingame it says something like "free trial is over, go buy our game". Yet if I login properly via steam it is working fine.
---
Xbox?
---
This is my favorite. The Overseer sees all
---
This reads like the "Missed Encounters" section of Craigslist.
---
get lost lol
---
Since when did they try to remove the arcing from Tesla rifles?
---
Yeah and it‚Äôs very sad because I definitely would have liked to have had a new mask in the game. There isn‚Äôt many
---
Curious what your display case items are
---
Yeah it‚Äôs supposed to have one but it‚Äôs blank in the atom shop.
---
It should mean that the silo is ready to start constructing a new missile.  Does it say that for all three silos?
---
AGI/PER arent that bad as a 3rd star
---
No idea why they haven't included it, but at this point it feels pointless, just like most new C.A.M.P. items because I already hit a wall with the ridiculously small budget.  I have nowhere to put it and I am not one of these people who enjoys tearing down and rebuilding the same camp over and over and over.
---
How much acid do you need? I have tons.
---
Yeah. I definitely would have liked the game more if Bethesda actually took there time with it and not rushed it so then it could be released
---
Wait you can fly from wade to top of the world with a jetpack?
---
Hell yes so I play on my pc without having to start all over
---
Lmao this was me. I am still on my grind for the gauss weapons in adventure mode so I had no idea that I would get blown up from executing you at close range. Also laughed pretty hard when it happened (while being salty at the same time for having to play another game to get my 10 minutes of survival time in NW). Good fight my dude!
---
I got it for my handmade for a month and then it stopped.  Game is voodoo.
---
SS is still the better armor
---
yeah uh suddenly I can go in, thank you
---
Like the other commenter said, pack a low damage weapon. I use a vampire's 10mm pistol. It's lightweight, easy to find ammo, low ap cost, and the health regen stacks well with the low damage per shot.
---
I think i speak for every power armour user when I say they shoudnt cause its cool
---
Less than 100 unfortunately lol. I am currently a bum ass dude. But I'm on PlayStation 4.
---
Should be an option the from the candy machine. /u/ladydevann
---
Yeah that‚Äôs easy. I‚Äôll do that first. Just added the livestream link
---
I've never noticed this. Even when i'm at scorched earth and there's like 10 people in PA and me in my asylum outfit. So maybe there is something to disable it.
---

---
If you have woodchucker, just travel to vault 76, and run downhill to the lumberyard. If you finish that run with less than 500 wood scraps, you weren't trying.
---
iBlackHandx 
---
Let me know if you want help. I'll be on for about another hour
---
I had the same problem. If you only kill a few at a time you can loot them before they vanish. The others usually aren't far away by the time you finish the first few.
---
Here's a broadsider minigun 
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/A1NzLi4
---
Everything is personal preference but I feel like there is nothing more satisfying that being in power armor that took ages to buy the mods and have a heavy gun and just mow down waves of enemies. What platform are you going to be on?
---
I saw a few nice camps adding to the things already in place, like building around a boat to make a mini marina.
---
Do you have the rank of general in enclave?
---
Not that I am aware of.  IIRC, both are considered torso mods, so its either/or.
---
Pretending to be something you clearly aren't..... Sad.
---
Hahaha yea I recognize your name! Adventure mode gauss weapon won‚Äôt do that tho! Hope we‚Äôll meet again in another match haha.
---
Agreed. Apparently this one is a type of balaclava..
---
Think about those with bad eyesight.  Or any disability.  We need to make games more accessible for everyone
---
Even with the bugs, the patches set to fix something small and break something big, the disappointing content after big promises and some mechanics that are less than intuitive; the state the game is in now is still quite a bit of fun for me. It feels like I'm playing fallout 4 and a good bit of the NPCs are played by real people.  I never thought I'd enjoy this game because I didn't when it launched.  But currently after the wastelanders update and a lot of back and forth of changes and updates, I do not regret my decision to purchase and play.  If you are a fallout fan this game is close enough to fallout 4 that you will like it even if you're not a big MMO player.
---
one of the most disheartening things about this game is the cold hard fact that 99% of the time, anywhere you look, your view is interrupted by at least 1 graphical glitch. Especially since the graphics in this game (glitches aside obviously) are really flipping beautiful. I guess it makes the 1% of time when it works just that much better :/
---
Had that happen as a game finsher the other night (also by cat house oddly ) finished 1 and 2
---
i have grown used to the soothing sounds of my big metal boots as they stomp around the wasteland. my minigun in hand for any creature who dates to be louder then my stomps
---
Long loading screen
---
I will be on PC 
---
That sounds so cool heavy gun
---
I did it at least 10x more when it first came out and never got it to drop. Ended up trading for one a few months ago and wouldn't you know, stupid plan dropped the next time I did the event.
---
Cool!  Maybe it was right at the borderline on the timer is something. 
---
Or it could just be a glitch. 
---
Enjoy your run!
---
That's ridiculous.. But photos are very easily edited. I can't find any videos or actual gameplay footage of these weapons. Do you know of any?
---
Go into the actual silo and fight your way through the dungeon. It tells you what to do.
---
sure, got into the silo but I cant fight all those robots and also I'm a complete noob so idk how to do this
---
Of course.
---
Oooh gotchu, ty
---
at least, when reaching the allied status it should be free.
---
They called survival beta too and never actually released the finished product.  Lame excuse to release broken garbage. They sure are cashing in on every ones cosmetic purchases for nuclear winter though.
---
Ah shit. I'm on PC and Xbox, but I have thousands and thousands I'd gladly share.
---
I try to be as loud as possible, I have an explosive .50 cal and I love to just dump bullets in anything I see while running around. It's glorious
---
Bow/Crossbow are definitely niche. Had a Bloodied FFRFR crossbow that still was just too slow for anything other than long-range sniping. If a group got me, I was dead.   
---
Also, the bow was simply not useful at queen fights.  
---
Your pistol/grenade may work. The 10MM bloodied and kitted out is actually a decent weapon, but you have to take a lot of shots to finish off the baddies. Brightside: 10MM ammo is cheap and plentiful. If you parlayed yourself into a group role of healer or some such, you could just use this build to tag everything and then keep people moving. Might be a great deal of fun.  
---
1H melee, sneak or tanky?  If sneak a bloodied hatchet will kill nearly anything front sneak in a hit, gauntlets are same. Tanky? Am a big believer in vampire/ss bowie knife or equivalent. You'll be nearly indestructible until your weapon breaks...
---
I've seen enough videos to know they are very real, but no I dont have any links. People on PC have been able to use dev console commands to spawn in anything they want, including clothing with legendary effects etc. It's straight up broken
---
alright cool will do, once I gather the courage
---
thank you very much, you were super helpful! :D
---
This game needs more patient vets like you lol.
---
I do and guess it doesnt matter anymore, I'm in the silo now
---
The problem is that Bethesda haven't fixed magic weapons yet so people take advantage of them to grief others. But they have more important things to take care of like working on a new boss that will probably be released buggy as well and will never get fixed.
---
It's much appreciated, brother. There's a tiny bit of fun in the grind anyway. Thanks for the offer. I would have gladly accepted.
---
Usually don‚Äôt encounter PvP, and I do this. If you have an issue with death, store your junk before you go claim. Even when I‚Äôve claimed *from* people, they usually don‚Äôt contest.
---
If there's less than two minutes left, with 5+ high level people all standing around, I'm starting it. Other than that, don't mind waiting
---
I pretty much played with the default keys on this game because reassigning them has caused me all sorts of problems.  For example when I reassigned the push-to-talk button the button I assigned it to did nothing and the button it used to be did nothing.  For some reason if a button is used in building mode and in gameplay reassigning it seems to not work in both modes sometimes.  I have decided I'm just going to have to get used to the default key assignments.
---
Here is my bloody commando build.  You can swap the perks out for Rifleman which I do from time to time.

---
Thank you üëçüèΩ
---
Earlier i made the largest set of PA i could. Obviously they all share same frame but some skins and armors cause it to be bulkier or taller.
---
&gt;They know people struggle with the awful camp building system - so why would they improve the building mechanics when they can sell a solution.
---
Building problems into the game and then selling you a solution has  been their standard practice since the game's launch, and it grows steadily worse, in my opinion. 
---
The earliest example was the refrigerator.    Tired of your food rotting fast but don't want to sink three points into luck to preserver food?  Bethesda has a solution- for a fee. 
---
Then Fallout First pulled the same stunt with stash limitations. 
---
And yes I think you are right about walls and prefabs.
---
If you haven't tried it yet, go to the monorail and run along the top of it. The length of track behind Bog Town is fun, there's a small stretch starting at Foundation. 
---
If you [take over the workshop at Bog Town](https://i.redd.it/6wxuawx1gx351.png), you can build yourself a tower to fly off from to get over to it, and run down it for a good distance flying to some of the other pylons. I take over the workshops sometimes and build a little jetpack course to play around and practice at sometimes. 
---
I might have to look into building a springboard!
---
There was never a legit way to get it but some people still have it even after all the patches
---
Maybe it's been addressed in the updates and that's why we can't find any videos? I'm sure people would be reporting these guys left right and center, and that they'd be uploading videos too.
---
Either way can't really agree with not having cross save due to this reason.. Doesn't seem to be too much of a problem on PC.
---
Maybe someone will see this post and share some footage, but until then I'll still hope for cross save, maybe I'll be able to get a few more hours in.
---
60% of base damage probably. so no perks or mutations.
---
Are you talking about the Monorail Elevator?  I have two arms at 50% off fall damage. So that is 100%. I don't die now leaping of things like a crazy lady. I am having way too much fun with these legendary armours.
---
Use a tesla
---
Nice
---
I‚Äôll land on the monorail elevator next, just got to the top of the world from Wade.
---
Bash damage needs an overall buff. When my heavy gunner with max strength and power armor can't smash a fucking radroach in one hit with a 50 cal, nevermind just stepping on it, something is wrong.
---
I dont think thats how terminals work.  Pretty sure if someone is using a terminal you can still use it remotely with your pipboy
---
Saw that on pc yesterday. In Whitesprings.
---
Well too bad for them, I had my hands on a pretty nice bloodied ultracite laser rifle and, oh boy, does it suck. Worst damages on a sup mutant than a non bloodied lever rifle. They were clearly not prepared to face the "curse of the buggy mess".
---
No, consoles shouldn‚Äôt be exposed to inventory steal hacks, impossible weapons, and people spawning in whatever they want like assets from fallout 4
---
You're racist. How do you live with yourself?
---
I mean instead of ruining the economy for all console players if you really want why not connect your PC to your tv and play with a controller? You have the option
---
‚ÄúRemotely with your pip boy‚Äù what are you even talking about. 
---
How about you actually try what I said with a friend before you come up with any more crazy stories xD
---
The stock isn't really negotiable on an AR-10 platform though. The alternative is having the buffer tube hanging out of the back looking silly as hell with the longer barrel.  
---
The shit part is using the charging handle animation, they could have tweaked the mag and few minor details to make it an AR-18 and suddenly stockless becomes an option.
---
Can also use interactive Fallout 76 map.
---
 Three times by the SAME GUY in different matches. All three times he downed us both with his jumping gauss spam and he had to be rescued by his teammates lol.
---
I've never experienced this effect. I hear them running around but the world doesn't "shake".
---
I use a lever rifle with 2 ranks of Gun Fu and it's working for sure. Damage increases on my second target.
---
Until some guy comes along and flattens it with an explosive gatling plasma, some guy did that to me, I know a better way, selling marine tactical masks
---
F
---
‚úåüèª
---
Wow so i cant complete the story now? Great
---
Many workshops can be defended with a sniper rifle from a position outside of the zone.
---
  If someone else shows up, they have to help clear the critters before they can take the workshop.
---
When the critters are gone, you get credit for completing the defend event.  And, since you were outside the zone, cannot be PvPed.
---
When the event ends, move on to your next location.
---
+karma
---
I'd be happy if they at least let us share gold bullion crafted items. Can't sell it, which means I can't store it unless if I want to use it.
---
Chameleon armor and hiding. I did this quest around the level 20 - 30 mark. No shots fired. Just hiding.
---
Remember when they had separate open world PVP servers? I'm guessing they didn't have enough players using it to justify keeping them open. Everyone should get what they want within reason but if the company finds it isn't profitable, they're not spending any time on it
---
I just saw that. Do you have AP refresh armor, or how are you keeping your AP refreshed so fast?
---
Not really my wish to ruin the economy or fun for anyone, only pressing as I've yet to see any hard evidence of what you're sharing. In the end, beth should really get a grasp on these things considering how many atoms some people spend + there's a subscription service now. 
---
My graphic card and TV don't support each other, and steam link is too laggy.. 
---
Also want to experience f76 in all it's 4k hdr glory, i love the colourful and vibrant scenery. Maybe I'll just ditch pc and start a new char on consoles someday, or wait till I afford a better graphic card.
---
Its an issue related to fullscreen, many titles have that.
---
They need to reduce the durability damage by a lot. I really want to use the shredder, but the minigun breaks after just a couple kills because it's considered bash damage.
---
only if you like the jetpack gimmick.  from a defence standpoint solar and its heal ability beat it because of diminishing returns of the resist stats.  
---
wow that 1 less hp damage from DR sure does outweight the 4/s heal in combat /s
---
Yes, they do.  Purple, tactical (red), bright, and vault boy.
---
Can be hard to find, but they do exist.
---
1 cap for all types of ammo, 5 caps for all plans that are decorations/camp items, 10 caps for plans for weapons or chems, 20 caps for plans for rare weapons five caps for mods.  Legendary weapons and armor go for a few hundred caps per * if they are not any good.  If they are decent then I kind of look around and see what the market is and drop it by about a hundred.  Everything else either 1, 5, 10 or 20 caps depending what it is.  I try not to have much of anything in the super high price ranges except for maybe a few legendaries that I don't actually want to sell that I have priced in the multiple thousands.  I usually just put things that I'm trying to get rid of into a container at the train station but every once in awhile I'll throw in a few 0 cap items in a vending machine if I'm too lazy to truck them to the train station and I have the space. I try to set my personal cap level at about 20K because I don't want to accidentally max out if someone goes on a buying spree.  I'm honestly gotten to a point in the game where there's not much left for me to buy.  I usually end up buying junk and bulk junk because I can store an infinite amount of it in my scrap bin.  Everything else just takes up space that I don't have for items that I really don't need.  I will by flux if someone selling it because I don't generally use power armor and having to suit up to go into the rad zone to farm flux is kind of a pain for me.
---
Except, he's not letting the "devs" know anything, he's making a public statement, on a public forum, posted as a "Discussion". There's no specific detail on what should be fixed, just a general statement of "there's not enough endgame content", which is opinion not fact as plenty of people have been at the endgame for months and still find ways to enjoy and amuse themselves with the content available to them. 
---
The devs will know when people stop playing. It's called a unique player count. They can see how many players there are at any given time on each platform so there is quite literally no need to treat the subreddit like an airport and announce your departure. 
---
No-one is preventing the OP from posting, but to try and dress it up as "he's letting the devs know" is trying to make a silk purse from a sow's ear.
---
I would agree, if we didn't already have a history of delays and slippage before Covid-19.
---
This is \*awesome\*!  Thank you for sharing!
---
That's some game of thrones shit when you think about it haha.
---
So where do you get ss and the jetpack mod at
---
The last time I used my key-card, like someone else had recommended, was after a successful SBQ.
---
Popped the card in, and hopped back onto the terminal and stayed on it.
---
After 30secs, exited out and spun around to see how many people were nearby, and hopped back on. There only 1 other person there.
---
During that 30secs, one guy walked up to me from behind and kept shooting at me, but I ignored him.
---
Waited another 30secs, and did the same thing.
---
This time, there was like 5 people, so I initiated.
---
Yeah. To be honest it makes me very sad for this game because if Bethesda can‚Äôt fix something so small as making a mask available it makes me wonder on how they deal with way bigger issues
---
If vats was actually working as intended,the SB would die instantly.
---
So...is it broken?
---
On an unrelated note, I love your name brother üòéü§ò
---
Yeah, some people don't understand that new players just don't know what it's about. To them they just join a public event and do an objective xD I confess, when I was a noob I did that too because I didn't know it would start an event, I learned my lesson once xD I never joined events that required higher lvl than mine tho.
---
I said cross save not crossplay. It means you save on pc, switch on your ps or xbox and you have the same character waiting for you. 
---
There can't be inventory steal hacks or people spawning assets, and I'm still waiting for someone to show me these impossible weapons in action
---
That'd be great, as long as it goes public if the owner leaves the server. I've seen one Encrypted nearly time out, so I was forced to trigger it.
---
When starting a new character you don't  bunch of improved repair kits lying around.  Let's say someone has a level 400 hundred character with a ton of improved repair kits.  They are used to fixing everything with one click of a button.  And lets say they  decide they want to try out a new build on a new character. Suddenly they find themselves in  a situation where their gear is constantly breaking and they have have hardly any junk at all. 
---
Good with salt means sinking three points into luck that could be better spent elsewhere.  And there's way more useful mods for the backpack.
---
Update 21 is what I heard. Too many inadvertent pvp engagements apparently. So enjoy the neon chain signs all over the map
---
He is right it can be started from your pip boy, project paradise too. I have been in both events and had people start them with out getting near the terminals, while me or a friend is on/blocking the terminals.
---
Nice pun
---
All unyielding armor other than two pieces of fall damage reduced armors. Action boy, bird bones. But that‚Äôs about it. I just time my boosts just right
---
I think its somehow random.. after i tried some stuff people where sharing it worked for me with this very last one.
---
Just try them all out
---
I'd recommend throwing points into strength, intelligence, agility, and perception to make yourself fairly versatile and then decide where you want to specialize later. Strength is always good to have because it increases the amount of junk and weapons and armor you can carry. It's not just for melee or anything like that.
---
Power armor is NOT a must and in fact, many end game non-power armor builds are stronger than end game power armor builds. 
---
You will NOT lose out for not having Fallout 1st starting out. I would recommend giving the game a month or so of play and if you're still enjoying it, then go ahead and get a Fallout 1st subscription. What Fallout 1st does is it gives you a portable tent you can place in the game world (not really that important) and gives you unlimited junk stash space. Having unlimited junk stash space is not something a new player really needs. It's very unlikely you will be hitting the junk storage cap when doing the main quest, wastelanders questlines, and grinding to level 50.
---
Stop being a pansy.
---
Even if it‚Äôs not cross play you‚Äôd still have the problem of assets and items coming over from PC. I‚Äôll link a video to the weapons when I find it
---
I‚Äôll have to try that and if it works, I‚Äôll stand corrected. 
---
Alltho I imagine not many people know this, so blocking the terminal should still be a good idea.
---
How?
---
Nope, you can't. I once was able to use the terminal remotely on my pipboy but it was a quest terminal and I had to jump around to be able to press it. So normally if someone's at the terminal you cannot use it.
---
if that's true that really sucks...
---
NeEdEd To KnOw WhEtHeR oThErS wErE eXpErIeNcInG tHiS.
---
So thanks for the sarcasm
---
1 effect that works better, and you‚Äôre still losing out on dps. So no, it is not better just because it works better in 1 instance
---
Nuclear winter has separate perks and you dont bring anything in. Everyone starts with nothing, just like any battle royale
---
On PC there's a setting for that. Can't remember what it was.
---
If we got back the atom challenges after completing the legendary run, while I hate that they were removed in the first place, I'd grind harder.
---
I'm not exactly sure if either of my jetpack users have bird bones, might have to look into that. Jet packs are a hell of a lot of fun.
---
This- and make sure you got plenty of stims üòÇ
---
Any clue how good weightless and the mutation is in comparison?
---
Slippage is just a Bethesda trait. Most players haven‚Äôt complained about that in the past and with mods didn‚Äôt really mind - which will probably once again not be a complaint after mods are released.
---
I think time has made people forget how quickly Bethesda worked to clean up this game before covid though. And to be clear, I was railing on Bethesda before this interview happened. I just think we‚Äôre seeing the poor condition rn and convincing ourselves it‚Äôs always been like this, because there has always been bugs to an extent
---
Perk wise, I'd recommend at least 11 in Luck. 3 for Serendipity, 3 for Bloody Mess, and 5 for the 2 mutation perks.   
---
Agility at 5 for Adrenaline.   
---
Intelligence at 3 for Nerd Rage (although I have mine almost maxed for Demolition Expert, if you use an explosive weapon, and either Makeshift Warrior or Gunsmith for the extra weapon durability).   
---
Charisma at 4 for Lone Wanderer (if solo) or Inspirational/Strange in numbers (if in a team).   
---
Endurance at 1 for Radicool, possibly higher if you want perks like Good Doggy or Fireproof.   
---
Perception at 15, assuming you're using a rifle. 9 points for the 3 damage cards (commando or rifleman), 3 for Glow Sights, and 3 for Tank Killer.   
---
Strength at 3 for Blocker (or higher if you plan on doing melee/heavy guns instead of Perception for rifles).
---
You haven't been playing fallout 76 forming right? Lol
---
I miss Jerry.
---
At vault 79 after you do the wastelanders quest into the vault. They require gold to purchase, have to have the chest first then the jetpack is a mod for the chest
---
Well that terminal is part of a quest so it probably would still work.  Its been a long time since I did the same mission with a friend but originally I believe thats how it worked.
---
I decided against it since I use voice chat but that's a good point. I'll try it out.
---
Console players commenting about pc hacked items ruining the economy have no idea what they're actually talking about. There is no console commands to spawn in whatever we want, there was one hack that allowed stuff to be stolen, one time. It was patched and players got their stuff back. Nothing like that has resurfaced since. 
---
There are still some hacked weapons, but they are extremely uncommon, so rare to the point that I have only ever seen reports of them here on reddit. I have 5 characters and over 1000 hours put into this game, and never once have I seen a hacked item of any kind. Most players don't use them for fear of ban or crashing their own game immediately. 
---
Cross save and cross play for Adventure mode would be a wonderful addition. I have faimly that plays on console and it would nice to play with them. Any console player that just immediately screams and reeees about hacked weapons is an idiot.
---
Always
---
Yeah, he is actually since Bethesda has tons of fake accounts on this sub and posts constantly. 
---
You get far more attention here than on the officially ignored forums. 
---
Of course you know this, being a 1 post , 200 day old account... so stop acting and just relay the information to your supervisor. 
---
K.  
---
Thanx
---
Isnt 36% where rank 1 caps? Maybe its still bugged and only applying the first rank
---
Maybe renting the rooms will be how we get that internal camp zone.
---
How do you know assets would be carried over? You're saying furniture weapons etc that are loaded on a pcs hard drive are carried over in a small mb save file?
---
You need to load the assets in the game directory for them to be loaded in the game, and consoles don't let you access said directory. Otherwise there wouldn't be a need for cross save for these things, they'd just load them in..
---
yea it works most of the time but every once in awhile some starts it while my team is on the terminals :(
---
I meant a quest like a main one, never was able to use other terminals in side/misc quests. If it works, it works inconsistently then.
---
Much agreed. I have different way to hold the controller for that event.
---
No worries man. If you ever find your way into PC, you're welcome to visit my Communism-themed store. Everything is free. Sometimes it's just Handmades and Vodka, but usually there's 50-60 plans, tons of purified water, fresh crops, some random 2/3* weapons and armor.. depends on if someone decides to wipe me out in one spree. 
---
Surprisingly though, that has only happened once in the several months I've been running the shop.
---
Actually magic effect is suposed to be easier to get on a private server. High latency makes magic effect not work.
---
Interesting.  Ive been trying to search it but im not coming up with anything either.  Can't play at the moment to test it out either.  Now I'm really curious
---
Hopefully a better Survival mode comes back then lol
---
Will try :)
---
I won my first game of NW by letting a Scorchbeast finish off the other guy. I took potshots, but I don‚Äôt think I even hit him.
---
That was a good laugh.
---
Why should it be?
---
Even if you did all the work to spawn it?
---
Another interesting note I made was once I got the frame rate drop to occur any subsequent area I traveled to seem to have a lower frame rate even if no ash piles existed in that area.  This was especially bad if I was sprinting between areas or jumping off of something into a new area.  However since the problem has disappeared for me (and like I said I'm not sure why because I made several changes at once) I can't really test these theories anymore.  The interesting thing about the problem is it clearly is a cross-platform problem on both consoles and PC, but PC seems to have ways to fix it related to drivers and hardware optimization.  To me that is counterintuitive because an issue that persists across platforms would seem to me to be an issue that wouldn't be fixed by fresh drivers on one system.  The only thing I can think is that when they made their change they tested it on a system with the latest drivers and therefore did not notice the problem.  I'm really only guessing at this point but I can assure you that what you guys are seeing is a legitimate problem that has been reported multiple times.  my hope is that the Bethesda will test this on multiple platforms before declaring it fixed.
---
It's just this game's mechanics that's slightly annoying, when people can block anything interactable. Lemme know if you test it üôÇ
---
I hate competitive pvp, but honestly I really like nuclear winter. I turn auto-team off and enjoy stalking around avoiding other players as much as possible, I‚Äôve gotten top ten multiple times and even won once, my only kill being the final guy who was distracted by a scorchbeast lol
---
This is the only other option I could think of, just to use it for queen fights.  I'm just not sure how I feel about losing 20 lbs of stash space.
---
Well, that's not really doing it justice. I am fairly confident I have spent more time playing Fallout 76 ùë°‚Ñéùëéùëõ ùëéùëõùë¶ ùëúùë°‚Ñéùëíùëü ùëîùëéùëöùëí ùëñùëõ ùëöùë¶ 32 ùë¶ùëíùëéùëüùë† ùëúùëì ùëôùëñùëìùëí (although when I was about 12 I put in the hours on Monster Rancher 2 via PS1). Intensely unpopular opinion: this is my favorite game of the Fallout franchise. I'm just out of things to do &amp; like a great many others am left wanting more &amp; see the vast margin potential for improvement.
---
I‚Äôm saying that you can load them on PC, blueprint them in your camp or a workshop, and then use that blueprint on consoles. If by some miracle that doesn‚Äôt work then you can still place them at you camp on PC and they‚Äôll be there when you load into a console game. Here‚Äôs the link the weapons https://youtu.be/QtH-l9_o6f8
---
Maybe idiot is a bit harsh, as I understand these people just don't want their game ruined, but I agree with you totally on everything else!
---
I doubt bethesda really pays attention to anyone misinformed anyway, I'm just hoping this garners enough attention so that I can start playing regularly again.
---
Now what are the chances you two would be here to laugh about it in Reddit too, huh?    :)
---
I am not 100% sure how it works. When I started doing project paradise, some people who had been doing it longer then I had told me people could started it from there pip boy even if you are on the terminal, but never said how.
---
I have since seen it happen 30 or more time in project paradise/encrypted, while me team block the terminals.
---
I've been playing for about a year and a half and have yet to even see a rolling pin. I'm starting to feel left out lol
---
Doesn't look like you need it much.
---
This sort of thing is what I figured.  I think I'm just going to keep using normal ammo because mine is bloody, but I use it at full health and am just now starting to use it at low health and it's doing so much more damage.  I think I'm good with just that.
---
Ya, they do. Or they did. I use that Gauss shotgun a lot since acquiring it after going through all the grinding for the foundation and stuff. I have downed my self a few times and even died. If you are too close you get splash damage.
---
The problem with NW is cheaters on Pc.
---
Its very much this.  Always craft in the nude.
---
My thought exactly.
---
Now kiss
---
I like the idea of getting rewarded for some ammo points, but what if instead of that POS Ammo Convertor, they just refit all of the Ammo Machines at the Train Stations to actually accept those points? As it is currently, there's a ton of those things already scattered throughout the world and I'm not really sure how much use to anyone they really are. But, since they appear to have made the Ammo Convertor even worse than it was(I wound up in the mini-game "Escape the Ammo Conversion Menu" last night for about 5 minutes) instead of using that machine, make all of those other machines that are already availible have some actual use, and then STOP GIVING ME FREAKING MISSLES!!!
---
You can open any doors you locked and if you go into an area someone else had locked they can shut the door manually just as easy. Last time someone tried to lock me in somewhere I quickly exit the game to title screen and rejoined. I also do that when I am in a cave/building and am ready to leave but do not wanna go all the way back the way I came (especially if I am overburdened).
---
It's always been "base" damage, everything is
---
I feel that. I'm jusst glad that rhe forceful stock on weapons accounts for this and adds the most durability compared to other stocks
---
#killbos is my political affiliation. I think I'll nuke Ft Defiance and ATLAS today.
---
Serendipity perk? That would give you a 50% shot at not dying.
---
We need cap sinks, having more places on the map you can layover in to cut down fast travel costs is not going to help.  I mean, I think I‚Äôve seen 60 caps max traveling to one of them, and doing the quests they give you end up walking out with more caps than you started, so I think the cap sink is fine.
---
More XP, the high level ghouls and scorched can give out about 200 - 290 XP each and if line in the sand is set up so they all spawn in the middle it‚Äôs about 3000 XP per wave :-)
---
Yup i did a while ago. All about that new vegas now
---
I have a ninja. Shes got 2h, 1h and crossbow/bow. I have a lot of fun playing.
---
What I most remember from launch is fortnightly patches while the game was on its knees, so I think we'll have to agree to disagree on the 'worked quickly' bit. I mean, compared to the now monthly patches it was certainly a faster pace, but still leisurely by any other standard.
---
That is sooooo how it's gonna be from now on. Whatever the fuck part of that system that does the "guessing" as to what I actually want vs what I'm gonna get, is no longer getting any help from me!
---
What buffs does it need? The damage output is fine and it has the benefit of being able to heal npcs with the right perks during events.
---
Same.  What sucks is that it doesn't even work properly in borderless window.  What's the point of having two monitors if you can't even use them correctly.  It's still nice to have the wiki up though.
---
Spot on from a fellow mele bloodied.  I can take down SBQ when on the deck but die to the mob straight after üòÇ
---
Put a PA in front of the computer.
---
I make my entire gameplay dependent on having fun stuff for my camp, which unfortunately right now means I want that fireplace secret door.
---
that's good to know, may just be another shotgun thing.
---
I am sorry. I see people post almost the literal same thing here all the time. Would love to hear some suggestions as to how I can more effectively shout into the abyss. I've already quit so what's step 2?
---
Just learn the reload glitch, and get some fireworks and you'll be golden
---
This guy lol, patience is virtue.
---
I don't normally use it, but was just testing things and it def doesn't work for shotguns.
---
Perhaps it is a bit harsh at first glance, but I frequently see the same mentality and response from console players when discussing crossplay/cross save. 
---
Most of them simply assume that PC players run around with nothing but hacked inventories 1 shotting everything and selling all of these hacked items. Well if we all have all the best hacked stuff because we could all spawn it into our inventories, why would it be for sale to begin with? Why would Bethesda just let us all run rampant through the game's content with ridiculously hacked equipment? The answer is we don't, because none of that stuff is true . 
---
They just see these reports of players claiming hacked weapons and think, boy I'm glad I play on console. When really thanks to mods, playing on PC is 10000x better in terms of qol improvements. In fact with mod support coming in the future, I have no doubt it will be PC modders that create the very qol improvement mods that console players will download.
---
As person who hates PvP in almost any game I can say that Nuclear Winter can actually be pretty fun. I don't play it that much but i can say it's really well balanced. If you don't come across a hacker, it's really enjoyable. No bloodies or junkies or legendary items, even specials don't matter and perks are unique to that game mode. I had my bad experience with griefers and toxicity, but  it's a problem in every game. In adventure mode I just go with pacifist mode and mute people who start being mean and block griefers.
---
Get cheaters on consoles as well.
---
not really. Game is easy enough as it is without giving bloodied even MORE damage output
---
1st is to grind and hoard scrap resources IMO. As for builds I would recommend heavy weapons with power armor first, then you can roll other characters to try other things if you want to. I've got 5 characters, 3 are fully developed already.
---
Lucky 38.
---
I hate to admit how many times I have blown my self up with a Furious Combat Shotgun (my favorite weapon). Especially with charred ferals. They swarm you and the reaction is to just shoot them as fast as possible and by that time they right in your face. And as I furiously fire at them, I am furiously killing myself.
---
But I haven't blown my self up with the Gauss Shotgun. Yet.
---
Sure thing, I'll take your comments and pass them on directly.
---
"*Hi Todd, a dumbass thinks I work for Bethesda because I choose not to spend all my time on Reddit posting garbage and whining about things and only recently took the time to set an account up. Hope this helps "fix the game" because he's clearly too smart for us and has figured out the secret code and practices we at Bethesda use to trawl through Reddit*"
---
That cover it off nicely enough for you? I'm sure Todd will be overjoyed at this feedback and it will magically make all your woes be resolved in no time at all.
---
Have a Joy Joy day, friend.
---
So it would be better to invest in different characters then re spec
---
i this game literally ruined my character build, when i wear power armour i either move really slowly (togglerun is on and im not encumbered) and/or i cant even shoot my minigun
---
Honestly though, you can't both be bloodied and a tank. The two don't make sense, you need to be at high health in order to be a tank, it's not just about resistances.
---
Thank you very much for the information and I will do what you suggest give it a try first
---
If you thinking buying repair kits is necessary, go for it. I don‚Äôt see anyone using a fridge to actually preserve food though. 
---
1) food is everywhere so I don‚Äôt understand storing it. 
---
2) it would take up a lot of valuable stash space. 
---
But hey, I won‚Äôt tell you how to play if you think you need a fridge to achieve that competitive advantage lol
---
And use that field medic, or whatever it's called, perk in charisma to boost the effectiveness of your stims. I can hold all 3 as a bloodied, still a beat down, but I sure notice when I don't have that card equipped
---
That's not how it works, blueprints don't save illegal assets into bethesdas servers! They'd just come off as empty space or maybe glitch out his whole camp/blueprint. Again, you can't upload assets into save files or bethesdas servers. If anyone could do that, you'd probably see random creations everywhere. 
---
Regarding the weapons, that's just insane.. Again though I've never seen any of these though, I'm pretty sure beth is heavy on the bans regarding these, and I'm not 100% sure they'd make it into the console version.. No one working with bethesda or that has any experience with them has confirmed this, and although I understand your paranoia, I think you need to do some more research on console vs pc architecture
---
I would but it's too late for me. I used to play on PS4, bought the game on Steam and now my Steam account has way much more than the Ps4 one. I still have the Ps4 disc as a souvenir, but don't have the consoles anymore.
---
I mean, if video proof wouldn't change your mind, then I'm inclined to agree. but I urge you to look into sneak because your notions are woefully misguided.
---
Ok, fair enough, fair enough. Yes, the cake is a lie, its actually a experiment, its filled with serums and other FEV to test on unsuspected people. But keep it between us
---
The silo was probably on cool down, someone had probably recently launched a nuke, if it happens again just jump server
---
If I'm a new player and am doing encryptid for the first time and *no one* is starting the event for some reason, you better believe I'm not going to think, "they must all be too stupid, let's get this going."  I don't have to know why, I don't have to understand, I just have to realize there's probably some good reason.  It's not that hard people.
---
I always just wait. I‚Äôll only butt in if there‚Äôs like 5-10 seconds left because they may have left to go to the bathroom or get something to drink or something. 
---
Yeah out of the 11 times I‚Äôve done it I‚Äôd say 5-6 times no one bothered with the pylons and I had to be the conduit for 2-3 of them and use a bunch of stimpaks and my vampire UGL.
---

---
although some people do like an actual visual guide
---
Yes, IMO. If you only play one character you will be able to unlock many playstyles through perks but I prefer having alts. I'm an altaholic in every game I play.

Strange issue. I live in China (PS4) and don‚Äôt have issues with or without VPN, except for lag without VPN. I generally use the UU vpn box though as it is faster

Getting a rolling pin from the SBQ is a rite of passage.

I never said any such thing.
---
&gt;I have a feeling that that is the room that has the unique plasma weapon is, cause I couldn't find it no matter how hard I tried with the Settlers.
---
You are correct.
---
lucky 38?
---
Dayum
---
The problem with the mutation is that it jerks when you shoot. You're visible for a split second.
---
holy smokes this shot looks really cool lol
---
Then I don‚Äôt know your point. You either think they are needed for starting a new character or you don‚Äôt. I won‚Äôt tell someone how to spend their atoms, but it‚Äôs certainly not p2w not necessary.
---
You do get the splash damages in adventure mode, but the endurance perk fireproof helps a lot with that
---
If you get the game if you wanna play add me on discord because I just got back into and looking for people to play but I can try to show you a few things
---
I have been using the mine/UF method, and it's still annoying and slow, but it does work. I'm trying to get some T-60 armor plans, and they are 6900 without perks/chems, which is just ridiculous. Thanks for the writeup!
---
Sometimes I bash lvl 3 ghouls or whatever that I don't feel like gracing with my holy cannonfire.
---
honestly the game is pretty good about introducing the new content. i came back from only playing the beta a few weeks ago and had no real trouble. theres 2 factions now and a new currency, gold bullion. the two factions can sell you stuff when you get the gold bullion, and they have dailies which will award you gold bullion. everything else is pretty much the same.
---
Collectrons are nice.  But I guess I am getting hung up on my interpretation of the word *need*, because I don't think collectrons are needed to play this game.
---
I‚Äôve dropped a nuke 3 times to spawn the SBQ and every time I‚Äôm either alone until like 8 mins remain or there‚Äôs like 2-3 people that join. I‚Äôve only succeeded once from my own nuke. I can get her down to half health by myself after she fully heals but then there‚Äôs like 3 mins left.
---
PA sucks if you compare to legendary armours. Do not take away our only fun factor...
---
team responders I see
---
Space Program
---
I personally know people that saved prydwens to their inventories and can still place them as they please. They can do that with other items too and just Bc Bethesda doesn‚Äôt acknowledge something doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist. Most of the things they do in their patches arnt even in the notes and they love to downplay when there‚Äôs serious issues with the game. It doesn‚Äôt really matter how you feel or if you think everyone saying how much of a bad idea it would be in the comments is wrong and paranoid though because they‚Äôll never add cross platform saving to 76
---
I go in fully expecting this to happen. And last night I was not disappointedüòÇ. They were level 40 so I do understand. But this would be an easy fix. It's funny though, people sure don't seem have problem reading the objective to start the event, but the one that says activate the pylons? Nahü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks so much for this. Trying it out right now...
---
No, I know how much damage my weapons been doing before and I saw clearly it was "more than a half more" damage added. Straight x1,6 multiplicate.
---

Some other good shots that were taken while trying to get the perfect one.
---
Dlc Space vaults
---
Don‚Äôt know much about that perk have not had a chance to play since the update.
---
Tbh I can understand your frustration if you've been dealing with this for quite some time, fortunately this is one of the rare times I'm speaking on reddit so my tolerance for this stuff is still quite high.
---
Maybe console only players would benefit the most from cross save, they'd see for themselves that it's not the crazy lawless land they make it up to be.
---
I think people forget that fake reporting is a very, very real thing in gaming. I've met gamers that say they report people who destroy them online claiming they are using hacks just to "get back" at them for ruining their session..
---
Any new good heavy weapons? When I was finished playing I was a heavy weapon user.
---
Besides buying daily gold and making gold purchases, why would you ever go back after reaching allied?
---
It was fair exchange - you get 60% more damage, but you sacrifice 5 stars perk card. Now it's not really worth it that much...
---
scorched head, super mutant head, restored desk fan, etc. just uncommon things I think someone might find interesting
---
Awww, that's pretty funny but I was expecting 6 foot wide O's
---
A recommendation, Install the Perk Loadout Manager and the required SFE mod as well.
---
It's not that important early on when you don't have many perk cards, but later on, it makes swapping between perk card builds easy.
---
I think that‚Äôs a bit of tunnel vision on just Bethesda, personally. Rockstar constantly released new content without fixing bugs from previous updates, Ubisoft claimed developed ‚Äúthe most adaptive‚Äù AI yet never fixed it so players couldn‚Äôt just walk circles around an enemy on not get hit, the Witcher was buggy all the time. And these are all companies that have game engines built for online and/or open world content that are usually less flexible and more streamlined than Fallout‚Äôs. 
---
Not saying it wasn‚Äôt buggy, but game patches anymore then biweekly would‚Äôve have wasted dev time to keep shutting servers down to apply the fixes and removed ppl from the game constantly. 
---
For comparison, just look at the state of CoD rn. They‚Äôre constantly releasing content and players are being booted weekly for 40-50gb uploads. 
---
All I‚Äôm saying is I think we‚Äôre looking at how other game companies(the good and bad ones) through rose-tinted glasses when we‚Äôre analyzing f76 today
---
Prydwens? Seriously? Lol
---
I have to see this! Get a video!
---
The Prydwens are on console or pc?
---
Awesome thanks
---
Neither did I, but some people don't pay attention or there are no other players except one. It's you who pay attention and good for you, but some people don't think much playing a game. Or they don't know what's going on and think it's a quest popped up. There can be 100 reasons. I mean some people just don't understand how it works yet. there's a voice/text chat for those reasons. some people are smart, some are not so much.
---
PC, I‚Äôll link a video in a sec
---
Log out, log in. Solves many bugs.
---
I've never ever noticed that before. Maybe because I'm always in third person?
---
Awesome I will look at both mods
---
Text chat? Pts?
---
Um... nuclear winter is a battle royale. You don‚Äôt bring any adventure mode weapons, armor or perks into the mode. 
---
So no...no bloodied players.
---
Why don‚Äôt you just log in and see what it is all about?
---
"I want to see more alleys, less oops"

What is your take on the fan boy collecting resources for ‚Äúthe return of the BoS‚Äù at ATLAS based on the garbled message?
---
What if the message isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwe‚Äôre the BoS and here comes the cavalry to save the day‚Äù but ‚Äúwe killed the remaining BoS we‚Äôre coming to take your remaining supplies, suckers.‚Äù
---
The message is missing so much content it could be a threat.
---
I know right?  I just started building my rep wtih both so I moved my tent out front of crater and moved my camp 2 caps south of Foundation.  I wanted to start water farming anyways. know not everyone has 1st but it helps.
---
Hopefully Ballistic Fiber/Military ammo bags!
---
Maybe energy cells?
---
I believe there's a text chat on consoles. there's voice chat on all platforms
---
Missed the point. Sometimes you‚Äôre not looking for DPS, you‚Äôre looking to Tag and Tank
---
New gauss mini gun from the raiders once you max rep with them.
---
Not sure what you're doing wrong but the Concentrated Fire perk, maxed, will get that percentage to 80% with the 2nd shot &amp; maxed at 95% for each shot after that.
---
thanks for the update...
---
Unarmed weapons are the highest melee damage, especially after adding mutations. I tried out several builds and have stuck with unarmed/bloodied/sneak for over 100 levels.
---
I don't think mines/grenades are useful at all as part of a thought out build in my experience and from what I see others doing.
---
That whole video is why cross platform anything wouldn‚Äôt go so well
---
How is getting oneshot by an invisible asshole 300 levels above me good for me?
---
What‚Äôs your Perception?
---
I have both set and I think solar more worth it but more expensive. Cause you need to buy 13 vault steel and 1 legendary module to craft one piece. While ss required 1 legendary module and cheaper to make.
---
Couple things I‚Äôve learned along the way....  I do not play bloodied. 
---
Max out STR.  Glow sight, martial artist, barbarian. 
---
Get the Healing factor and twisted muscles mutations.
---
For weapons, I use a Vampire switchblade for general purpose, then switch to  ‚Äôspecialty‚Äô weapons as needed:
---
FSS Ghouls Slayers switchblade.  This one melts the WS golf clubhouse mob.  1 hits L42s and 2-3 hits 62s.  Also performed admirably at radiation rumble, even against the deathclaws.
---
Mutant slayer switchblade.
---
FSS hunter combat knife.  Highest I‚Äôve taken out with this one has been a L91 glowing deathclaw.
---
 Zealots machete.  1 hits any under L68.
---
Each weights less than a pound, and does an amazing job taking out the respective enemies in very few  hits per (without power attacks or dmg boosting foods.)
---
I do carry a vampire SMG for tagging at events lie uranium fever, and a AA for use against that fly but dont land
---
Fashnacht brought out some sick camps. Im ps4 but ive seen that house youre talking about as well. 3 floors each side all diff themes
---
*kith
---
For t60 plans you should farm the distant thunder event and treasure maps for the bog area, or player vendors can be pretty cheap too.
---
Which takes flux
---
Holy fuck that thing looks wild.
---
That's unfortunate.  If I build my pc in the new xbox 1x case does it count as a console?
---
Ok
---
I havent tried since the update but; you can normally put 2-3 plants per half segment of block. 
---
But, if you use the blue print trick of Blueprinting 2 crops with 5ish feet of distance in between, you can stack them on top of each other, delete the outlier and continue this method. 
---
I have 8 of each tato, corn and mutfruit all lined up neatly and stuffed inside of 1 half segment each.
---
My first character was stealth sniper. It's ammo efficient since I'm not spending a clip to kill 1 enemy.
---
Melee is useful early on when you don't have much ammo or crafting materials.
---
I used the machete (crafting higher level ones as I leveled up) for quite a while. Shooting them with a hunting rifle, and if that didn't kill them, hiding behind cover until the enemy came close then whacked them.
---
I would recommend getting the Pharma per under luck as your first one. % chance to find extra meds is nice. I had this as my first perk, and never really had to worry about running low on stimpacks.
---
Yea I have that on, strength barbarian, bandolier, blocker, per rifleman, tank killer, exp rifleman, mast rifleman, concentrated fire, end fireproof, charisma hard bargain 1, intel scrapper, gunsmith, agility action boy, covert ops, sneak, escape artist, adrenaline, luck bloody mess, tormentor, starched genes
---
Ah ok this seems good
---
14 due to junkies weapons
---
Thanks! I didn‚Äôt know they could drop. Good to know. I do try to look at player vendors, mostly I know everything so fer
---
I raise you this jump with same location but with a jetpack to launch you even higher before you start to fall.
---
No damage taken. two others with me and with GL, BB and armors took half damage an one died.
---
I actually had no idea this was how battle royal games were played. I've never played one. But that does make it sound more fair
---
This is too cool! thank you, the abandon bog town is 13 bags though (so far that I've found)
---
Shark Week!
---
How can people cheat? Can you give some examples of what they do?
---
Mine is too.
---
It's pretty cool, you can also get a gauss shotgun from the settlers at max rep.
---
Tried setting up a boosting session on psnprofiles but didn‚Äôt seem to work or wouldn‚Äôt let me
---
So then, what's the big deal? Are you trying to one-shot through VATS?     
---
What's your Perception at? A low PER would explain less VATS accuracy. Also, how far are you when to start getting 50% on a stationary target?
---
No one uses Solar. SS is objectively the best armor in the game
---
So there arent only other players in the match you have to kill? I thought it would just be the players you had to worry about attacking you
---
It should work fine.
---
I started my character through the Bethesda launcher on a free weekend.  I was able to link my account and pick that character up again when the game was included on Game Pass.
---
For some reason the MS storefront doesn't have the current QuakeCon discount, so I bought the Raiders and Settlers content bundle on the Bethesda store, despite not having access to play through the Besthesda launcher.  As expected it worked fine when I fired the game up through the MS launcher, since the upgrade applies to the account.
---
Atoms are the only sticking point, those aren't unified.
---
There's no prydwen in that video though.. He's just saying there was an plasted an image of a prydwen over the gameplay..
---
I totally agree that cross platform would be terrible.
---
However, cross save can't introduce these problems.
---
So what happens to all the stuff in my inventory when I go into this mode then? Is it just like, locked? Do you drop and lose stuff when killed?
---
You‚Äôre quite welcome
---
Because I don't like going in blind lol
---
Have to be standing right next to and enemie for it to be higher then 50 but anywhere from pry 5 feet away is 50

Do a bow build with tomahawk and hatchet back up. Call it hunter
---
Your build in NW is drawn from your perk point structure from Adventure mode, you acquire cards in NW by winning matches or the time you survive. You're not carrying over your established perks from your Adventure mode build, but your NW build is based around the distribution of your perk points from Adventure.
---
For instance, suppose you have 15 in Strength in Adventure - you *could* assign 15 points worth of Strength cards in NW - but you only have the 7 slots(S.P.E.C.I.A.L ) to fill them up with. You'd have 5 slots for your NW build occupied by LVL 3 Strength Cards. Then you'd have 2 other slots remaining for intelligence, agility, luck, or whatever other cards you wanted to work in based on your other S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats and the points governing those stats.  
---
You can change those cards up at the beginning of the match, but not afterward.
---
You don't go in with any of your weapons or armor or mutations, despite the disparity in levels among the combatants on a server, everyone starts with the same equipment - just not the same perks. You can acquire mutations during the match. You can launch nukes. You have to find your armor, weapons, stimpacks, etc in crates scattered across the map. 
---
I mostly play it like a hide n' seek simulator, not a big PVP fan either, but it's fun to hide and let other players go right past you. I've largely avoided it until the Legendary Run, but it's one of the few challenges that I actually look forward to, unless it's tracking down 10 creatures for 250 SCORE, that was utter BS.
---
I mean that‚Äôs proof enough that it happened, it‚Äôs hard to find good videos from 6 months ago w hacked items in them, I‚Äôll see if I can find footage in a bit Ik someone has some. But at the very least cross save has the potential to let some very nasty weapons onto the consoles and lots of things that shouldn‚Äôt be there
---
Here‚Äôs a video https://youtu.be/x5w615PH21A
---
??[this is what I do most matches](https://youtu.be/-Td1gP3wHOE)
---
From my looting, I can surmise that the BOS lost because their power armor troops went into battle armed only with pre-war money.
---
The perk reduces explosion and fire damage by a percentage so it can safe you from your own explosions a lot as well. It's also just nice to have as it reduces the scorched beast sonic attack damage as well.
---
One more tip, pretty much for everyone and not just PC players.
---
Whenever you are at an overseer stash, where you get holotapes from her telling you what she was doing in the area, check them. Even if you already got the holotape, they retock with boiled water, but I and many others tend to dump stuff we don't want into them. I tend to swing by the overseer's camp next to Wayward and dump off unused ammo, plans, and if I have any, low level weapons.
---
People also do it to random containers near train stations.
---
Also learn what dropped items look like (paper bags, or currently, the duffel bags).
---
Many high level players dump lots of stuff they don't want, but is very useful for others.
---
A cryolator does wonders for this fight. I bring one to help control how much damage it does.
---
SKILLS
---
Encryptid was how I finished that achievement. Scorched Earth helped a little too.
---
I might be available is it on NW or adventure
---
I do encryptid only once a day and its obviously noobs that start it prematurely. I dont mind randos starting it when they're aware that there are enough people there though. That being said I usually tank all the pylons everytime because I'm not wasting time in hopes that someone else does. I hit the Imposter when its stealth then I'm onto tanking while they beat it to death.
---
I think your timeline is a tad off. The BOS engaged Operation Touchdown, and thought it worked, but there are terminal entries showing it didn‚Äôt. They had a final stand at Fort Defiance; sending out the message ‚ÄúDefiance has fallen‚Äù, which Free States members heard prior to being overwhelmed, since Abby mentions it in her recorded messages. I think, given the Responders distance from the Bog, they were the last to fall.

---
Ss is not objectively best for full hp.  objectively, it has 1 gimmick (jetpack) and has extra resist stat that is __useless__.
---
&gt;No one uses Solar.
---
Myself and quite a few others use armor type, closest thing to God mode you can get in the game.
---
U know what nevermind this game doesnt make any since just 1 shot a enemie that said 0% chance to hit
---
All the stims
---
There is a black skin for the Mini gun and a gold skin for the 50cal. Might be others if someone wants to jump in...?

I‚Äôm glad I got to shoot David in the face. Now can I shoot Rose and melt her into scrap?
---
Do you have any mutations?
---
(Todd face)
---
Still more armed than us in ww1, mr garibaldi, am i right?
---
Yeah... I run bloodied and stopped using those because of this.
---
Also, for some reason, it was auto using radaway or rad-x.
---
I would occasionally get the message that it wore off, even though I didn't manually use it.
---
Nothing good can come from mixing the different economies between platforms.
---
The only one I‚Äôve ever seen in the atomic shop was the .50 skin, and it was in the shop like a week after I traded my be90 .50 for a bffr50 minigun and be lmg so I didn‚Äôt buy it.
---
Why should effect me though? It make my game screen shake as you run about.

Marsupial and speed demon
---
Thanks, I hope so, will go look for it.
---
yea, hang back and play "medic"
---
I wish they would give us menu items to activate/disable this as well as the in power armor head bob. The aoe should only be for explosive vents landings.
---
irl?
---
How is he wrong I have 3 characters stuck on different quests that can‚Äôt progress including this garbage and yeah almost every quest is buggy or glitchy as hell
---
Yeah I'm sure people messing around with the  system files can do stuff like this on pc, but you need this stuff saved on your pc dude. You can't, ever, have an item in your inventory that isn't in the game, load your char on another pc and expect it to load. It just doesn't work that way! Prydwen is prob 200mb in it's own, and there's always a limit to save files. 
---
Regarding weapons it really isn't much of a problem, as I said before I've never encountered these, most people get banned after using them and some of the people that say that they have encountered them are making it up because, you know, the Internet and its ways. 
---
You should try the pc version sometimes, stuff like this seriously never happens.
---
Fallout 2nd just for transferring stuff
---
K bye.
---
Well judging by the answers so far the game is populated by selfish obnoxious players who love anything that negatively affect others.
---
That wasn‚Äôt in the patch notes, and it still does the chaining effect - the particles are missing though, and it seems to properly chain more often.

Honestly? I never use a sidearm. I keep a good stock of tomahawks to tag the pesky ones, but 9/10 if I can‚Äôt reach it with Marsupial, strange in numbers, and a jet pack? I don‚Äôt even care, not worth the effort. 
---
Got a set of Vampire Knuckles, and a Bloody Power Fist, with tons of tomahawks. I don‚Äôt really use any other weapons.
---
there is so many bugs to fix and mechanics to repair so i doubt they would implement  different modes. And there is a main requierment: a very big online.
---
DLC Space Jam
---
This sounds generally right except the mods

It's getting to the point where it's hardly worth the ammo üòÇ

Bethesda: "it is free, caps aren't atoms"
---
I'm not talking about the sounds of Power Armor foot falls, just that my world screen literally moves about as you run by me in power armor. Make me sick and it affects my aim.
---
Which is why I want the next SCORE event to have a SCORE vendor instead of a SCOREboard.  A SCORE vendor allows us to ignore the rewards we don't like, get the rewards we want immediately, and get as many Legendary Scrip, Gold Bullion, Fireworks, and Lunchboxes as we want.  Atoms would need a challenge like earning 20,000 SCORE gives 150 Atoms.  This would allow players to work as hard as they want for the rewards they want or as little as they want.
---
So earning 500,000 SCORE would give 3750 Atoms and the choice of getting all the main rewards and 300,000 SCORE worth of Legendary Scrip, Gold Bullion, Fireworks, and Lunchboxes or 500,000 SCORE worth of Fireworks and 3750 Atoms if that is their choice..
---
Think there may be a few mini gun skins actually. Not seen an LMG one though which is stupid, like not having a fixer skin
---
Should have kept the 50 cal!
---
Again, I'm not talking about the sound of power armor.
---
Ahhh I use sheepsquatch quills as my throwable
---
Thanks for the share! Damn they even got it loaded into a public server... How do I never see these things? 
---
Kinda Makes me itch for steel dawn this fall.
---
the tricentennial content was a download code in your physical copy, so it was dlc, not on-disc. the disc is just a basic edition disc. if you get the digital edition that includes the wastelanders cosmetics, there will be no issues and you will lose no content by playing the digital version.
---
all that said, i feel that buying the gane again over the sound of the disc in your machine isnt wise as that'a a minor issue, and you'd be better off just buying the cosmetics bundles and saving your money. i can tell you with confidence selling your disc secondhand will get you barely anything.
---
Yeah I know, I always carried like 500 40mm grenades on me and 100 nukes just for the fun of those 2 weapons :D
---
(looks at red rocket gas pump, trucks, fuel silo)
---
Bethesda: "No!"
---
Do you have any reason for saying that? Other than everybody uses it?
---
As the other guy said Dr has sever diminishing returns after the 350 mark. So the extra Dr is really not that helpful.
---
Solar grants you, and your team mates, a pretty solid passive healing effect
---
I guess ss let's you use a jetpack? But by doing so you lose dense and there for might have to use and extra 3 points for fire proof (since you can use dense).
---
(gnome chuckle)
---
Shit I just use mine at the queen.  Thanks for the heads up.  üíú
---
people claim to quit the game constantly, it means nothing. if you're cancelling 1st or quitting the game, then just do it. they'll pay more attention to player numbers than reddit complaints.
---
As do I, I'll often say similar to them if I have the time. 
---
I guess it depends what you actually want to happen. If you have specific ideas, then there is the option to mark your post as a suggestion which, as I understand it, are most likely to be looked at by the Bethesda staff who do actually take the time to look over and respond to posts.
---
If all you actually want is "more endgame content" then, based on the roadmap, that's stuff that's already being worked on (the BoS content and the seasons) but it takes time, (especially when you're Bethesda and 90% of what you release is buggy as hell because you're using a ludicrous game engine originally built about 15 or 2 years ago and just has loads of more modern things patched on to it).
---
I can't speak for anyone by myself, but I tend to play relatively regularly for a few weeks at a time. I play a lot of different games so I rarely get burnt out. At any point if I've not played in a week or two, I cancel my FO1st then sign up again when I decide I want to play again. Basically the same thing I do for ESO. Sign up for ESO plus when I want to play, cancel it when I lose interest and move to something else.
---
I think a lot of this issue is perspective. Historically, a game would have a set amount of content and a finite shelf life (there are exceptions obviously, games that people replay time and time again). With the advent of DLC, and now the Live Service model that so many companies equate to making more money (it's hard to argue with this, you can see an Ubisoft release from their investor call a year or two ago where they talk about making the games "live services" with ongoing content drops and daily/weekly missions along with limited time rewards, resulted in people playing their games for substantially longer, and spending more on MTX, it's why they include it in so many games, even ones where it makes no real sense) we're becoming conditioned to think that games should be perpetual and provide never-ending content and that's not really viable. Even MMOs rely on you running and re-running the same raids and events again and again, with bigger content drops every year or so. The endgame isn't endless, it lasts as long as it holds your interest.
---
I guess, if I was offering advice, it would be find a game you enjoy and play it. When it stops being fun, retire it and play something else. Nothing is stopping you coming back when they do their next big release. If you think you have an idea that may help the devs, by all means reach out using whatever channel you feel will work, but be specific and constructive in that feedback. 
---
I've not played 76 in a couple of days, been more focused on the Avengers beta, the trial of UFC 4 and, having just reinstalled it, Shadow of War (I really need to finish the second DLC). I'll probably be on tonight for a wee bit to drop off some Concrete as I have an over abundance of it, I'll run a few dailies and then play something else. 
---
I don't have any real answers for you, just consider when you see all those "people post almost the literal same thing" if you want to be added noise that most users throw a snide comment at, downvote then move on, or do you have something more substantial to say that you think can actually make a difference? If so, find a channel that works and try to raise it to people who can actually take it on board. 
---
Phew, that was far longer than I expected it to be when I started.  I should actually get back to work (unfortunately? fortunately? depends who you ask I suppose, not for Bethesda).
---
it would make the grind for rep a bit more worth it.
---
Creatures occasionally spawn, but you don‚Äôt really have to worry about them. I sometimes never even see them in a match. They die pretty quickly, even the scorchbeast, since you can find powerful weapons. Other players and where you are on the shrinking map are the only thing you need to worry about
---
It works, but sometimes it doesn't display the correct damage numbers.

*cries in having to pay for a BSS pole hook*
---
Use power armor with Emergency protocols and transcend
---
If you‚Äôre on a regular team, not a public, you can
---
Um.... You can.
---
Hell, I never said anything about quitting the game, they got me hooked on the legendary run rewards! I‚Äôm at 90, I can‚Äôt quit now for God‚Äôs sake. 
---
How much do you think numbers of people playing affect them?
---
You come to the mode having absolutely nothing but underarmor and an outfit you can add to favourite in atom shop. All your stuff is like stashed somewhere. It's classic battle royale mode, you come empty handed and find stuff as you progress. when you're killed you drop everything you found while you were alive. When you return to adventure mode all your stuff is back as it was in your inventory, so no worries about that. You can also participate in random teams or solo.
---
If they‚Äôre on your private team, they can ignore locks and traps. They can also build anything not from the atomic shop
---
Unarmed with all the drugs and bloodied.  Someone told me they can 3 shot sbq, sounds believable, tbh.
---
Erm, try googling before you post, only been in since, like, as long as I can remember.....
---
As long as you think it does.
---
That guy did an awesome right up! Thanks for sharing! I always tell people that solar or thorn (and sh) are the best choice. But they get so caught up in those higher numbers lol
---
Yeah, random griefers would put down 999 glitched ammo factory, and permanently brake your camp budget.
---
Standard teammembers can build at your camp.
---
Well, everything is nuclear powered and gas in the real world has a shelf life of a year and a half so Bethesda is off the hook there.
---
I'm not sad about it, you're sad about it! Raiders are too tough to care!
---
Mutations/ Diseases? Some can have a huge effect on accuracy.
---
Yes. Bethesda are already looking into the possibility of adding double wallpaper walls. We‚Äôve had a hundred posts about this since Tuesday. They know they pissed everyone off.
---
and you can team up with friends too! make a team before you enter any game mode and you'll be able to go to NW together
---
Takes too much work to get the encrypted started ü§™
---
Thanks for the link. I had no idea they did a Q&amp;A this time. Sidetracked I guess.
---
... quills are throwables? I just scrap them for bone, I didn‚Äôt even realize.
---
Ah.  Unfortunately not.  No text chat for me, which really sucks cause I don't like talking to people, but I want to communicate.
---
Either really, but think for boosting adventure is best.
---
It‚Äôs not even just that it‚Äôs that the game is nearly unplayable now the frame rate drops for no reason plus certain weapons don‚Äôt even work
---
Go to Ohio River Adventures and pick up the life preservers. Same place as the unmarked Raider rep quest to bring mirelurk products.
---
Not possible/obtainable.
---
You once asked why the raiders were hostile to you. maybe you should have googled that.
---
Awesome, awesome post. Thanks a ton!
---
Speed demon/marsupial, and currently just shell shock
---
as they are? not much.
---
if the amount of people who threaten to quit actually did? probably a decent amount. if people arent playing, they arent buying atoms or 1st, and then zenimax isnt making money.
---
hell, i actually like the game. im just tired of the "all bark no bite" from the people who dont.

---
No.
---
Missiles, grenade rounds, arrows and crossbow bolts all have good returns on the ammo converter and are basically useless to everyone. You can often find them dropped by other players even.
---
u/EMG943 Yeah so my camps next to this and for what it‚Äôs worth still not fixed. Three months later.
---
Dude! Thanks for the heads up. Gonna have to get back to running a few of those and find that plan, I had no idea
---
Better yet, make scrap weightless and make that 400 weight for actual items
---
Ghoul colossus xD That actually sounds like a nice idea. I always enjoy visiting Whitesprings
---
I took a break from 76 for a while and missed this whole Fashnacht thing but sometimes I see masks lying around or things purchased from the atom shop. What was it, exactly?
---
Tesla Rifles are completely broken they leave chain codes imprinted all over the place I‚Äôll send you a photo but also Explosive Laser rifles are glitched and have been buggy and some heavy weapons like non explosive Gatling lasers and plasmas have cause game crashes
---
Go to settings, turn off the action. If you are on Xbox I can find it and tell you which setting it is.
---
In game
---
as a general rule, whenever someone posts a link and says "watch and share this", it pretty much guarentees that i will never watch it, at all, ever. even if its a good video.
---
Yeah they are quite good
---
The point wasn‚Äôt the video it was trying to bring awareness that a majority of pvp related guns have been toyed with to the point they actually don‚Äôt work, I actually really don‚Äôt care if you watch this video or not
---
In that cases, I‚Äôve got nothing. Sorry.

You can. Just invite them to a private team.

Even the drill

Wait what how do you make a private team what
---
Good stuff....thx
---
Have you flown over the edge of the map yet? Good fun. You're going so fast the game can't stop you in time, so you go a few feet over the line and they freeze you in place at whatever height you passed the border in. Queue mothman dance with your team in the clouds ü•≥
---
You've been downvoted hard, so as a general rule for posting next time: This is how fallout fanboiiis react when attack Todd. [https://youtu.be/-GC5rAX0xHg?t=14](https://youtu.be/-GC5rAX0xHg?t=14)

I apologize I didn‚Äôt know it was already a thing I just couldn‚Äôt find anywhere that it was possible, my bad

After about 5 tries doing this eventually worked. Still very annoying but thank you!

My screen shakes when players run past me wearing Power armor and persists for a few second when they have past by, everyone runs in this game so in events my world screen is never stable.
---
Visually this affects me in the manner of motion sickness, this is not nice.
---
Thanks for your understanding.
---
(sigh)
---
Damn, I only thought there were public teams. Thank you !
---
I move around frequently, but I always do:
---
Free food and water, accessible rad shower, tower with springboards on top for as jetpack users to fly to useful locations, and an underground area for people to safely sleep, play instruments, craft and chill without risk of PVE attacks
---
Thanks I'll go look for that setting, hope it is available for PC.
---
MVP! Thank you!
---
I figure...excavator for carry weight, T-51b because its the most damage resistance (I think), X1 because it looks cool and for rad zones, ultracite because...I dunno...I like it. 
---
Which is recommended to keep and why? 
---
Also, isn't there a new type of PA in the new update? What about that one? Worth keeping?
---
Sad thing is I havent gotten the chance to play some of the older fallouts all the way through but I definitely will just because of this
---
You character should transfer yes
---
You're welcome! I don't know what you play on but there's a button to press while looking at someone to invite to team or trade with them. Won't have an option if they're already teamed up though.
---
cool thx
---
cool thx...good stuff

I run a PvP discord with around 100 members for xbox. I'm also bad at checking reddit. I'll drop an invite link.

"Our House" plays

This does not work.  Multiple people can use the terminal.
---
Right now I have my camp at the cave where you can put an acid extractor and other than acid damage its pretty chill and havent seen one enemy there

No. Console players don‚Äôt want PC hacked gear in our servers.

Proves your points invalid, so, thank you.
---
I have actually blocked sofia's console by placing a wall decoration (the bar sign that lists the beer from the atom shop). This prevented her from using the console. However, it caused her  to glitch and form an endless loop where she would try to use the console, disappear for a few seconds, reappear standing in front of the console and trying again.
---
Just out of curiosity what mods would u put on a handmade 4 vats
---
lol No.
---
Which unwanted ammo could be broken down and then remake ammo u want that the tinker workbench
---
I can do that or jump from any height but that's because I have two pieces of armor with 50% fall reduction on so I have 100% no fall damage
---
:(
---
Why *shouldn‚Äôt* it be, at least once your Allied?  What‚Äôs the harm with that?
---
Cushioned stinks i swapped out my acrobats for it thinking it was the same its not. I died on my first test and ditched them.
---
When it was first offered, 4 months ago, they said they were looking into it. 
---
A few days ago they replied to a similar post that they would ‚Äúcheck to see where we‚Äôre at‚Äù with it.
---
Like every bug/fix, we just have to wait and see.
---
I like the idea of expeditions outside of Appalachia. Lots of potential with that one.
---
(whitesprings manager Mr Handy): "Donations... from (ugh) you... oh... well... scraps of junk, not real money... i'd expect nothing else, please leave..."
---
If it‚Äôs part of the game mechanics it‚Äôs valid. In NW they changed VATS so you can only use it for mobs. If they didn‚Äôt want you to use it for PVP in adventure they would‚Äôve done the same.
---
Not available (yet?), but you can get a similar effect with the Raider Waster underarmour and sturdy leather armour. Although differently coloured.
---
I would feel better about donating to Whitesprings and the Enclave, rather than the BOS. I delivered steel, he gave me a couple grenades and some booze.
---
You may be hitting the Damage Cap on the enemies you‚Äôre attacking. I face the same issue whenever I‚Äôm in the forest as it seems you can do enough damage to the level 1-20‚Äôs there that it doesn‚Äôt let you do damage at all.
---
Same. Trying to do a horde event is an almost guaranteed disconnect
---
Pump shotguns seem to work the best, any pump shut gun with 33 vats, bashing damage, or limb damage, any one of these is going to work
---
For heavy guns the energy weapons dont work as well but they still do, but the best heavy guns are minigun and lmg they need to have one of the effects as I mentioned above, but you also have to mod them to make their fire rate go over 200
---
I have had a super mutant flying through the air like a frisbee.slowly spinning.i followed him until he hit a hill and finally stopped.
---
It's funny bc how empty the servers r u would likely see him next game
---
BOS Jumpsuit is ultra rare? I've thrown out so many :\\
---
The idea is to hide, NOT shoot.
---
Me and alot of ppl have been having problems with this quest for about 5 days. Bethesda put on there website they know there's a problem and they're working on it.. it sucks tho cuz it's taking forever but all we can do is wait at this point üò≠üò≠
---
This is what I was looking for, thank you
---
Nope, u need 33 vats, limb damage or bashing
---
Or 
---
A piece of armor that has limb damage protection on it
---
Unlike the shotguns for heaven weapons you need over 200 fire rate plus one of those attributes
---
yeah I may swap it to custom fitted so I can run longer.
---
Haha sounds like some good fun! I usually always get stuck mid air when trying to cross the barrier, but one time I was able to make it past and land on the ground in the out of bounds area west of deathclaw island. Ended up walking west all the way to the border of the actual map. Nothing out there but ground, grass, and trees. Eventually the ground becomes not solid anymore and you fall the it
---
I actually use thorn and love it. Lvl 416 full heath sneak.
---
 My next set will be solar to test the differences.
---
Just to get clarification.
---
Both Scout Masks show a drop rate of 0.15% in your list, yet the last datamining (for the masks, around January/February) showed 0.02%. 
---
Where did your 0.15% come from?
---
Yeah. One of the rarest items on the game. I wonder if you are thinking of other BoS items
---
(Todd face)  ...
---
.... (same same, but different)
---
Two pieces of Fall Damage enchantments will make you immune to fall damage.
---
You know like every update you get to your smart Phone subtly slows it down.
---
Reason being you will go out and buy a new one.
---
Maybe the developers are doing something similar. with this game
---
Shutting down servers.
---
Overloading the few servers that are left.
---
Game breaking update,after update.
---
planned obsoletion.
---
players get frustrated and move on to other things.
---
Bethesda  then get to justify binning 76 , and moving on to more lucrative projects.
---
Last update totally bricked my PS4.
---
Weird how i had no problems until that update.
---
Then i get an error message during the update, telling me the game was corrupted.
---
Maybe it is all about the money.And the game isn't bringing it in.
---
Just craft flamers.  When you do they are full of fuel.  Keep the fuel scrap the weapon, repeat
---
Boom shaka laka!
---
This owns, lol! :)
---
ü§î hmmm wondering if this new costume that person is wearing is an under armor and eventually will be sold in the atom shop.
---
Would make sense why they changed the brotherhood fatigues from underarmor to costume, if it was still underarmor no-one would buy the atom shop alternative
---
So that would make shotguns useless on bigger enemies then, also how would bloody builds be hitting for like 10k a bullet. I can melt a SB in .5 second with my mini gun.
---
My figures are datamined. I can try and reconcile if you have the source. My guess is that they missed the "use all" calc at the end that makes all the outfits drop
---
I think the all cammo is just available in game now and the red pants with the red logo are gonna be event rewards
---
It's fun as hell and I have met some of my best gaming friends in it - give it a try!
---
isn't that only available in the atomic store, and not available anymore?
---
The jumpsuits like the nuka cola, whitespring etc
---
I see this happening a lot during the event Path to Enlightment where when I shoot a firelfy I sometimes need to shoot it 3-4 times before it finally dies. It's really annoying.
---
I understand Aligned is the thing for vats.
---
What platform are you on? I'm on Xbox and haven't noticed it yet.  But if I start noticing it since you mentioned it, darn you to heck!
---
I wont spoil it for you but the queen gets easier too.
---
If you are launching on the queen you are end game or close enough.  Now you are doing what the rest of us do...   grind for better gear.   
---
One tip I can give is double check your perk load out.   Get rid of any QOL stuff you don‚Äôt need day to day.   Add damage and defense perks to improve your damage and survivability.
---
This sounds fun, really good idea I'm surprised it hasn't been done
---
Use vats, problem solved.
---
This is why I don‚Äôt use shotguns. Bugged or whatever, it‚Äôs not worth using 5 rounds to kill a lvl 5 scorched.
---
Now my FE and QE Combat Shotguns just eat up stash space.
---
Nuka cola is atomic shop I think. Whitespring jumpsuit dropped from mischief night so not too rare. BoS, forest camo and white powder are rare. There are also other common jumpsuits such as mechanic, vault etc
---
I‚Äôm a magician, but I only use those when I‚Äôm alone or if the queen has been going for 15+ minutes.  I have plenty of other weapons to use that won‚Äôt ruin everyone else‚Äôs time.
---
What do you want us to do about it?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can just stay on the terminal and wait
---
(Whispers , It just works )
---
What platform are you on?  If Xbox drop an lfg that says join off profile and your server will max out quickly.
---
Autoaim, oneshot kills (even behind walls), s√∫per speed, infiniteammo, flying over or under the map... months ago cheaters were fun, seen a naked guy with a bunny head bombing all the map with an autogrenade launcher while flying... nowdays cheaters are pretty boring, and is always the same people. On PC at least
---
Will I get to see Nuka World, Nevada etc.? (potentially) Well then... color me excited.
---
They patched your exploit bro
---
I throw them on just threw one of the long sites on as well
---
Thank you. Even though you helped me, you also ruined that whole idea for me. :D 
---
I wasn't too sure about it before but you are right, buying the game again is not the smartest idea. It's just for comfort... And I wasn't too much into the cosmetic stuff either so I might stick with my disk and save all the money for better stuff in the future. ;)
---
Then you are using a hacked weapon sir.
---
Wow, take it easy. Try to have more confidence in yourself
---
the internet
---
Yeah but all honesty I doubt they‚Äôll fix it
---
I only tried once yet but I removed all the lock picking, hacking, etc perks and used those to deal more damage with heavy weapons and all
---
Yeah, imagine having to look in a videogame in 2020 instead of mindlessly clicking on markers. You can't force me to use my brain Bethesda!
---
Sounds way too good to be true
---
Same with high rate of fire heavies and even some autos.
---
(whispers: toss a cap to your whisper... deacon liked that)
---
Nope I always run vats with a shotgun build.
---
(Whispers Did you hear about the ranger ? With the big iron on this hip ?)
---
I mean, in a way, yes. If these systems weren't put in place, there likely wouldn't be as big of a problem for some people. These systems are specifically designed to be addictive.
---
? I'm on Xbox so no hacks but the gun seems broken for sure.
---
Whatever you want to do, but if you agree with the sentiment and have FO1st active at the moment, maybe consider following suit.
---
Try cycling your systems power by completely turning it off and then unplugging the power cord for 10 seconds. Worked for me on for the same glitch.
---
For briefcases or is it a daily challenge? Lol
---
I start the event at the terminal and wait for about 2 minutes for other players to get together. Only once, there was a level 40-ish player who touched the terminal and started the event without enough time while waiting for other players. He or she was attacked by a horde of robots and assaultron and burned, often going down, but I didn't help it. Am I ruthless?
---
People just wanna finish the challenge and be done with it lol
---
Yeah I've gone back to heavybfor now but gauss shotty is fun until I try to fight higher lvl stuff.
---
I highly recommend against it, some might be a bit mischievous and place down a ammo factory. You can't remove them and they take up quite a bit of your camp budget.
---
It was patched like may 2019ish, used to be able to drop it to other players but now when you drop one it will just vanish. So the only way to get one now is to already have one.
---
It's one of the better items imo.
---
The best thing is you can change the dirt to regular floor and planted crops will remain. You can then slide the whitesprings pots in and you now have indoor potted plants you can pick. I used this and the blueprint glitch to have 2 tatos in a pot in my kitchen.
---
(Sound came as a whisper from their lips)

Daily challenge is survive 1 minute in the storm.

Oh my god this sounds amazing , im gonna buy this immediately

&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
( He was looking for texas red right ? )
---
You unfortunately opened up Pandora‚Äôs box and let out all the ‚ÄúI sell these for way way less and your ripping people off‚Äù posts. 
---
Your prices are fine. Just remember that some plans have high face value but are so common that they are not worth it. Almost any base weapon plan is in that category. I typically sell plans for half of face value. Rare plans can be listed for much higher.
---
they are not good for flying sb. while i could 1 shoot everyth my record with a 80lvl SB is 4 shot  withing a very close range. speaking of tagging enemies is very handy. i used it for the line in the sand (without vats and perks) and everytime got 2.5k+ xp for a wave.
---
I think my most expensive thing ( wich is mostly plans) is 100 caps I sell most of my plans from 10-75 caps.
---
I have the same weapon, and in VATS it either hits and does massive damage or it misses. At least the first shot. Then after that, it‚Äôs pretty consistent. I added one rank of Gun Fu, and while occasionally the ‚Äòquick headspin‚Äô is disorienting, it makes chaining through groups easy. 
---
Try adding in Skeet Shooter as well. That helped me.
---
First time I played low level I legitimately had trouble finding the pylons. It was the first time I'd been to the area and with the shitstorm of robots and the sheepsqatch bbq'ing everyone I must have resembled a headless chicken running in circles.
---
I am but no idea how long
---
I see, since I can't find the post and your mining is newer, I take the newer data :)
---
(Twenty one, would be the ranger?)
---
That‚Äôs the first step.   Second step is to move points around to maximize effectiveness.   These are the tough choices.   No right or wrong choices but tough ones.   When you hear of people complaining about leveling to swap points this is likely the reasons.

Mine kills the 95 behemoth at solomon pond in 3 shots, with vats.
---
Just got the same issue...
---
Wait what really?
---
you just have to kill candy man
---
I saw this happening too before I knew the challenge. I thought "The Happening" was occurring on NW
---
Unless you're a melee user, as they need the drugs!
---
( now the morning had passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
---
I've done it three times, still haven't gotten it, does it have to be 1 consecutive minute?  I guess I'll have to find stimpacks and then run in.
---
I managed to resolve this issue. It was a matter of out of date drivers. I had many issues installing the official AMD drivers, but I was able to get it working with the BootCampDrivers setup. I followed these steps:
---
1) Download latest drivers from https://www.bootcampdrivers.com/ (Downloads --&gt; Windows 10 --&gt; latest year drivers)
---
2) Follow [this installation guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmBWGdIGke8&amp;feature=youtu.be) exactly. The final step I did was install the Mac fan control software and I stopped there.
---
3) Enjoy Fallout 76 without all the shiny silver graphics!
---
dont wanna dissuade you from the cosmetics bundles themselves, as i bought them myself. that's totally up to you. but yeah, unless you're buying it for a different platform i dont see the point of buying a game twice outside the disc being flatout broken.
---
Yea it‚Äôs saddening, if you wanna use the minigun I reccomend using the perk that allows you to craft more ammo in one go and then using prime reciever and ammo
---
Nuka Shine Shaman Shanty, think of the Ayuasca "Cult" Camps in Ca, Az, NM, Co, etc...
---
If they were anything like me they were laughing their ass off too (dying to stuff like that is hilarious. One of the funnest parts of GTA for me are all my epic failures &lt;-and I kinda suck at gaming so there's a lot).
---
Same thing happened to me! Usually I dislike the gauss shotgun as it close to over powered but used it here the other day, clad in wood armor I downed a guy in marine armor, went to him to kill him and instantly died leaving him downed, no kill for me
---
Im level 110, most embarassing moment Ive had in NW, lol

---
Hey, you were kind enough to finish them off. So sick of being killed in NW only for them to leave me there waiting to die. Finish me damnit.
---
Yeah I think it's that way for everyone when they start out, that's why I don't get too upset
---
I use all of the perks in combat, the only few I have that aren't made for combat are the one I can't replace because I didn't get any other good perk. Example: I won't use the perk that increases shotguns damages because I don't use shotguns. I think I did a good job with my points until level 50.
---
why we should pay for ft anyway?
---
So, that bloodied + limb damage combat shotgun I have stashed should work now?
---
What about instigating explosive? Also magic? Antiarmor + limb damage? Magic too?
---
I was going to sell them all. Too heavy, they take too much space.
---
I use that type of mod on one of my characters for the durability. I never bash, I just don't have the resources to repair my guns too often.
---
Caps sink
---
yup.gif
---
I really want this now.
---
yeah, whatever.
---
I went in with 5 stimpaks and wood armor.  Didn't get it, but got close.  I think you need radaway and stronger armor, as well as stimpaks.  Maybe some rad-x.
---
After so much time in the storm the health damage comes on too fast for the stimpaks to keep up with it.
---
Or use perks to give you an advantage like Ghoulish.
---
Helps if you find yourself a HazMat suit
---
They really should un atomic shop lock the weapons and armor, rng already sucks so much with rolling stuff, out of the 100s I‚Äôve rolled I‚Äôve gotten 1 bloodied weapon and so many zealots, mutant slayers and nocturnal. Shits ridiculous.
---
Use the Armco to make 5.56, trade the 5.56 in to the Ammo Converter, use the Ammo Converter to produce 2mm.
---
That's pretty much the only way to generate 2mm.
---
I agree with you on that I'm not a fan of the new system either but I'm sure they would never change it even if a big chunk of the community asked for it.
---
The only reason I can understand is to make the game "longer" by making us pay whenever we want to teleport. But tbh it's just really annoying for low levels because they don't have a lot of caps.
---
Sounds like you are on the ball then.   Like you said,  it‚Äôs based on luck and the perk packs you get.   Over time you can tune.
---
Ha ha. Actually I put a list of the illegitimate ones in an appendix so that people can make the decision themselves depending on their views of that stuff
---
Plus it‚Äôs the same reason some games that choose no vehicles and smaller maps can feel as large as a game like gta. The easier transit it, the smaller the world feels.
---
People don't know how to read apperently. Take my upvote.
---
it doesnt make them any money, so they dont really have a big incentive to fix it. it probably just got pushed down because of the other 857 pressing issues this game has.
---
Bashing was my idea of a shotgun build: carrying just a shotgun and a hunting rifle, and bashing ghouls before blasting them.
---
Needless to say, he became a heavy gunner.
---
it gets to the point though where you cannot get rid of caps quick enough though.
---
I finally completed it on fourth try.  Looks like partial time is counted.
---
Aye I know but we are pal
---
Yeah it doesn't seem to be cumulative.
---
Hey! Now you got my attention! Nice work compiling my good sir!
---
This is fucking priceless. 
---
Ramm, maybe you should upload this to r/murderedbywords
---
Although that might be a little too cruel.
---
Just did the queen again and got an aa rolling pin from her and an assassins shiskebab for the event üòÇ like come on now
---
As an apparel collector I thank you, I don't include under armors myself though
---
11th
---
Yeah. Makes sense. Kind of a different class
---
RIP
---
anyone donated concrete? for same reward from a crate i have decided not to.
---
If you‚Äôre not looking for dps then you‚Äôd want a weapon with a high damage per shot, meaning once again, the normal laser rifle wins
---
There‚Äôs a few locations which have existing buildings that you can place your camp in, you can make a really cool little compound with walls and the like, my camp has two houses surrounded by those concrete walls.
---
Just be sure to only let friends you trust in your private teams. There are griefers who will build random stuff or glitched things which can't be removed, or even just players who want to steal from your locked resource collectors. I'm not saying it's rampant, but it is a possibility.
---
Let's just hope I get some great perks before I die, I always get the same cards and most of the time they are dog shit.
---
It can happen, and it is an honest mistake (the game TELLS YOU WITH A MARKER to call the robot).
---
If you use the card, be ready to fight by yourself. Be the hero. Stimpacks and tactics can do miracles.
---
(something somthing outlaw on the ground)
---
I just finished mine with one match pretty easy. So glad I don't have to go back until tomorrow.
---
FO76 is a prequel, and this is a Lost Hills BoS detachment sent to Appalachia- they couldn't have murdered the HQ. Besides, NCR is the one that takes the credit for killing the remaining BoS.
---
Wooby's armor
---
They should extend the maximum caps and stash capacity too.
---
All good, learn something new everyday. üëç Only downside is you won't get a public team bonus.
---
I think you want animal friend and wasteland whisperer. It takes a decent amount of points in charisma
---
(When he tryed to challenge the ranger with the big iron on his hip )
---
Rank 3 animal friend is all you need, but the king needs to be a random encounter spawn, and must spawn alone. Server hop at Cranberry Glade, there's a random event right where you spawn in. Another random event will happen slightly NE of there in the open bog area. If you can place a survival tent there it makes checking both locations really easy.
---
Good luck finding a mirelurk king though, they're much rarer than a deathclaw or sloth.
---
Huh
---
This could‚Äôve been a cool way to earn some nice rewards like legendaries or bullion or caps or anything really.
---
It‚Äôs all set up perfectly
---
I started selling just about everything for 10 caps.  It's like an old school dollar store (back when everything was actually a dollar).  I know people are snapping it up to resell for a profit.  Good for them.  I can't be fuckin bothered with the commerce side of things.  I'm just trying to get a little something for stuff I'd just drop otherwise.  I need the stash space.  I want to snoop around, shoot shit and do quests, not research what is sought-after merch and tinker with prices.  When I have too much of the relevant scrap, I'll build some guns at low level and put the sweet mods on them, and hunt down noobs fresh out the vault and drop them.  The only thing I buy from vendors is the occasional mod plan that I just can't wait to have (suppressor mods for various rifle types, for example), so I don't need a hoard of caps on hand.  Just enough for the occasional fast travel splurge when I'm too lazy to trek across the map for some quest.
---
Aye, it's part of the Raider Waster bundle. It does come back periodically during sales.
---
You still don't see a lot of the responder set or the leather coats.
---
So disappointed he's not been freed
---
Thanks!! I got the tent set up and got my hopping game on.
---
I really want the raider waster outfit....I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever coming back...
---
Reminds me of Earthworm Jim.  "CoW LaUnChEd!"
---
Wasteland whisperer isn't required for sending any creatures to your camp, even though it should technically be required for a mirelurk. Your charisma is also not important, all you need is 3 points for rank 3 of Animal Friend.
---
There's a lot of wrong info about taming pets online but I've sent dozens of them to my camp so I'm absolutely certain about all of this.
---
I was lucky and found power armor and used about 3 or 4 stimpacks. Got it in one go
---
It's weird. I had missions for Gramps but then they just disappeared from my mission log. I did the other Ally quests no problem but Gramps won't provide any story or daily quest now. Just tells me to hush haha.
---
None are rare anymore. All are mass duped.
---
Ive got one thats smoking a cigar with an army helmet on and playing cards
---
I'm pretty sure I scripped a pump with bash damage
---
exactly, caps are pointless
---
I know when I was looking into it a couple months ago the video I was looking into showed a high charisma build with both 3* animal friend and wasteland whisperer. But that's dope. Good to know I'm gonna have to try this more
---
I have 4 x lvl 40 radtoads spawn in my camp. I have turrets set up in strategic places up high and they mostly finish off the toads by the time I've loaded in. As I was technically there, the toads are lootable so I arrive to scrap and fresh food!
---
I hope you have better luck than me, I've tamed dozens of pets and never seen a mirelurk king yet. You'll know you've found a tamable creature if it's passive and wont attack you.
---
If I was rich you ward have got an award üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Can you build inside the houses at all?
---
I‚Äôve thought the exact same thing for weeks now. They can‚Äôt be so daft as to really be THIS out of touch with their player base. They ruin everything we like and ‚Äúfix‚Äù things that break 12 others. 
---
Case and point, the ammo converter. It sucked, we all hated it, they promise a fix. It sucks the same exact amount now, but completely differently. No WAY they were finalizing that thing and everyone was like ‚Äúoh yea, this is way better, based on the complaints and suggestions, this is exactly what they‚Äôre looking for‚Äù
---
They‚Äôre just trying to get us to go away so they can finally stop working on this game they gave up on a year ago.
---
does that random hazmat suit help?
---
Yeah it's super easy to tame stuff, and just 3 points of charisma isn't a bad thing to have. Lets you swap in Hard Bargain, Inspirational and Animal Friend as needed, plus it's enough to share one perk with a group.
---
it is
---
Bought a responder's uniform and a leather coat for a combined 2k at a camp a few days ago. 
---
Both are ultra rare rewards from their specific map areas.
---
Keeping that spirit of capitalism alive! What are they gonna do, fight without a dime like some dirty commie?
---
I picked it up a couple of months back, when it came back around. It will likely resurface again. They're aware that the Atomic Store items can be recycled to increase sales. 
---
Limited availability and time sensitive sales will drive people to buy atoms when, if the items were available all the time, they would be less likely to as they can earn them in game or wait for their FO1st atoms if they subscribe. 
---
Best advice I can offer is keep an eye on the store when it updates every week and if they're running daily sales, make a point of logging in to check if it's appeared.
---
Does the thorn armor come with legendary effects, like unyielding or vanguard?
---
When did you last buy from him? IIRC it was mentioned that Smiley reset for everyone this week with the patch, so if you bought from him last Saturday you could buy from him again this week after the patch.
---
Ok now I see where its coming from. My pump shotty has been way too good because of this. Are there any magic pistols?
---
Always check the server for players, too. I drop roughly 6 to nine queens a day. General good rule of thumb is at least four other players over lvl 150 or a looking for group post announcing a queen. It usually draws people in on the server. Since Game Pass opened FO, theres a certain
---
Rap ton of people low level right now.
---
Tl;DR You seem to be more worried about making money then quality. You should go work for Beth.
---
I must have the mirelurk king! I have a boathouse camp and it would be its perfect habitat lol
---
I hope luck is on my side for once.. before i was looking to tame i found a mirelurk king on its own before im certain of that.
---
Only do it with folks you know and trust. I‚Äôve had dipshits hide small letters all over my camp to make you hit camp budget.
---
Yeah,  given the game state now, it probably shouldn‚Äôt be the highest thing on the list. However I would have thought given how glitchy enemies are post death that they‚Äôd have least implemented a way to make sure your efforts don‚Äôt go unrewarded in the meantime if the former is too large a task.
---
I bought from him last Saturday as well. Figured it would've reset this coming Monday.
---
Lol, thank you kindly
---
That Forest Camo was my very first rare outfit and outfit I wore tirelessly. I got it fairly early on too, sometime within the first weeks of release. I didn't even know it was rare and I almost got rid of it multiple times &amp; even had many trade offers. 
---
!I still stand by wearing armor over mechanic jumpsuits!
---
Highly recommend it. The splash dmg reduction is just a little extra gravy, it makes fighting scorchbeasts a breeze.
---
Killed a ghoul bear the other day, hadn't seen one before (seen plenty of other bears but not as a ghoul)  so I went and took a picture. Poof, he instantly disappeared. Annoying to no end.
---
Hmmm i just had pacify on some creatures.. but they didnt spawn alone.. group of 2 yao guis fighting a sloth
---
I dont think its worth sweating realism in a game with nuclear dragons yo..
---
I never ever (in 1300+ hours playtime) saw somebody running around in the longshoreman outfit.
---
sell purified water and u will have easy 1400 caps from bot, place ur camp somehre to extract lead, acid or copper. U can sell this type of junk in ur vendors. Or place ur camp close to SupMut and visit them frequently to loot caps and gun powder. Alternatively sell gunpowder. Play in public teams and u will have a small bonus when someone completes a quest. Sell everything cheap and u will have ur stash empty but filled with caps.
---
There's no need. Hopefully they have learned their lesson.
---
I just checked, I bought gold from Smiley after the patch and he's not letting me buy any today.
---
I say lower the stash limit back down to 400 for japes
---
It's a public event, not private. If you want a private event, do it on your own server.
---
Nobody cares if you spent a few measly caps (totally worthless btw) to buy a keycard.
---
Tips from a veteran flux farmer:
---
1: Morgantown will provide more stabilizing agents (High Radiation Fluids, Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass) than almost anywhere else on the map. Also a good source of cobalt flux (make sure to get both the airport and the train yard)
---
2: Familiarize yourself with what plants &amp; fungi you are looking for:
---
( [Crimson](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_crimson_flux) )
---
( [Violet](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_violet_flux) )
---
( [Fluorescent](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_fluorescent_flux) )
---
( [Cobalt](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_cobalt_flux) )
---
( [Yellowcake](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_yellowcake_flux) )
---
3: Look on Mappalachia and find the best concentration of the flux you want (most of the best locations have very sparse creature spawns) Remember, that no part of your nuke zone can be within the green zone on ( [this map](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/3/37/FO76-nuke-protected-zone.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190216194951) )
---
( [Crimson](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/4/41/Mappalachia_fluxes_crimson.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190626173804) ): I usually drop the nuke in between Firebase Hancock &amp; Sparse Sundew Grove (southern edge of the map)
---
( [Violet](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/5/5e/Mappalachia_fluxes_violet.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190626174016) ): I usually drop the nuke so that the left edge just misses the Hemlock Holes Maintenance workshop.
---
( [Fluorescent](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/e/eb/Mappalachia_fluxes_fluorescent.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190626173841) ): I don't use much of this, but it looks like the best area would be either between Eastern Regional Penitentiary, Morgantown Airport, and Grafton Dam (triangular area) or between Morgantown Station, Gorge Junkyard, and Wilson Brothers Auto Repair.
---
( [Cobalt](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/75/Mappalachia_fluxes_cobalt.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190626173721) ): I get more than I need from nuking Morgantown regularly, but it looks like the best location is just south of Foundation, centered on Spruce Knob Lake, or midway between Lake Eloise and Relay Tower EL-B1-02.
---
( [Yellowcake](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/e/ec/Mappalachia_fluxes_yellowcake.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190626174137) ): Wow, this stuff is *Super* common. There is a huge area that is very dense with it, from (approximately) Big Bend West to R&amp;G Station &amp; the southern edge of the map to Hwy 62 (northern edge)
---
4: The actual farming. Remember that flux spoils (becomes inert). Farm your stabilizing agents first (they don't spoil).
---
4a: Nuke Morgantown.  You probably want to do this in a group, unless you can one shot 6-10 Bloated Glowing Ones in rapid succession at a time. Teammates get loot from each others kills if they are in close proximity to each other when they happen, so loot will be plentiful.
---
4b: Remember that you need one of each stabilizing agent per 10 raw flux to make one stable flux.  I try to get 20-50 of each before moving to flux farming.
---
4c: Don't forget to gather the Cobalt Flux in Morgantown. You can get close to 200 with the right perks.
---
4d: Perks. Don't forget that Green Thumb works on flux. Flux spoils like food (Good With Salt helps with this) It can take upwards of 45 minutes to completely scour a nuke zone for flux.  Use Green Thumb and Good with Salt to maximize your take away.
---
5: Processing.  The only Perk that I've found to have *Any* effect on the making of Stable Flux is Super Duper. I highly recommend that you use it, in all of your crafting.
---
Edit: Formatting

Not necessarily if families that were inducted into the vault already had children who were school-aged already.  Like, A 14 year old kid would've been 40 when Reclaimation Day rolled around. At least, that's the backstory of one of my characters Fergis Failout who went into the vault with his parents.
---
Yep!! Thats what I was thinking
---
actually thinking that was a clever reply is part of why you're such a big fucking loser
---
One more question for you, if i have a tamed animal at my camp already can i tame a new one? Found a snallygaster and tamed it.. but i actually want the mirelurk king. Do i need to kill the snally first?
---
Quad assautron heads can pull big money with the right second/third effects.
---
One would assume that those people had families that came in with them. So there‚Äôd be a variety of ages inside. 
---
I also wouldn‚Äôt sweat the realism too much. The Overseer was a recent college grad going into the vault, so she‚Äôd be in her late 40‚Äôs but looks positively geriatric when you meet her. Meanwhile, Duchess, who was a drug kingpin for years before the war and has now survived another 26 years in a wasteland looks like she‚Äôs 30.
---
I don't know but I blueprinted the whole map and it's now mine.
---
They do like causing trouble in the neighborhood.
---
Damn, I didn't even KNOW you could send a snally to your camp. It actually gave you the option to send it to your camp?
---
If you have a pet already sending a new one to your camp will just automatically replace the old one.
---
They drop pretty regularly, if you're on Xbox and looking, pretty sure I have some in my vendor.
---
Yeah that's an encounter without anything you can tame, there's a dead baby sloth nearby too.
---
And not being able to think of or do anything clever in your life is why no one cares what you think
---
I‚Äôm not sure all are. That‚Äôs why I asked. Saw a lot of red asylum but very little if any firemans/camo Juno suit
---
I found a fix!!! Join someone's private server and u will be able to do it no problem!!
---
Yeah it had that option; tame&gt;send to camp ! So he's a good fill in for the mirelurk king for now.
---
Thanks for all the info my friend!
---
I‚Äôve just managed to do it.  First attempt was a failure, only lasted about 30 seconds with no armour, and just 1 stimpack.
---
But on my second attempt, I was lucky enough to find Power Armor, and 2 stimpacks.  Started a timer on my phone to see how long I‚Äôd been in there, and on the 1 minute mark, got the reward. Died, about 5 seconds after that though.
---
Wasn‚Äôt sure if my failed attempt would have still counted in the next match, but no, it didn‚Äôt.  I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs cumulative within the same match, but not between matches.
---
That one ranked up is a must if using anything explosive... I can't tell you how many times I killed myself when I got my first explosive until I got that card maxed out... quite funny but aggravating too... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£
---
How did you do it?
---
my original main used to wear it. Picked it up in the first few days on the game without realising the vendor/outfit was rare.
---
People do have it though. I kept the rare vendor at lost home yesterday and 2 people bought it and immediately put it on. I've bought and sold about 10 in the last few weeks. Got one in my vendor right meow for 6k
---
I would keep a snallygaster in a heartbeat. I've never, ever seen one of those at another camp before. That must be some extreme luck finding one.
---
Why not both?
---
So what  if I have an assassins minigun that the fire rate is 209 and it has limb damage?
---
  Is that one?
---
There is a pink skin for the bat in the Atomic shop...
---
Thanks! Ill give up on the search for now than! It's only lvl 16 tho..
---
I just took 4508 steel out of my scrapbox and i am not overencumbered. still got 30 carry weight left. And i already had 187 carry weight.
---
So. You're speaking nonsense tbh
---
Like. proper nonsense. 200 steel is 7 carry weight
---
That's gonna work, just make sure when you shoot him in the same spot, find an enemy with big healthbars like sloths , murelurk queens you should see their health bar get decimated
---
How where you able to? I tried to make a marco to left click spam and it never works I want it to gather stuff from corpses without me spamming left click or swinging melee weapon with sapm with G Hub and it never works.
---
I'm not complaining about the fact that it may be difficult. I don't really need caps, I just don't understand why we have to spend caps to use fast travel.
---
I've never had a pet higher than level 21. For some reason even higher level ones seem to get their level reduced.
---
Fun fact - pump action shotguns only do three bash damage, even with the perk.
---
Heavy guns are mostly good for enemies with large health, shotguns more for one shotting things with small health
---
I want to be able to drop the instance door in a public workshop, go in, and be back inside my home camp instanced interior.
---
Or donate the materials to modus, so he can finish that one room that‚Äôs been under construction the whole game
---
Here‚Äôs hoping. But it was hilarious!
---
Wait, is *this* why I had to completely store and then place my rad shower again when it wasn't functioning properly for me? First I tried to just scrap and replace the wire, but the game would not focus on the wire at all.
---
It makes sense that there wouldn't be much oil since the global petroleum shortage brought the war that ended it all.
---
ft to some place and back. it resolves the problem (could be fixed with this update). 3* legendary? just loot him now! Legendary robots love to disappear after explosion. What really sucked not a very long time ago was a legendary SB turning in a goo.
---
There a stash box right next to the guy
---
max 1000 caps!!11!!
---
free wooby
---
Pretty sure auto-stim is broken right now. Hasn‚Äôt worked for me since the patch
---
I only remember the vendor NPCs when I first started playing. I was excited to see Raiders when I came back to the game, even if they murdered me lol
---
I think most of my quests started with listening to a holotape. I could be wrong lol
---
I‚Äôll join you. Lets build something weird. Psn: alphaboomer
---
elaborate
---
See, this is great.  But it's a whole ton of work for what amounts to a really pitiful reward.  I'm already hitting +350 damage per shot... on a minigun and gets crits in excess of 700.  The extra damage helps a bit on sbq, but not really on anything else.
---
Still not getting my point, but you do you.
---
Yeah Raiders suck!
---
All of them are Magic yes, and Bloodied/Limb is possibly the best roll possible right now, especially as a combat shotgun, with the VATS accuracy bug
---
Just remember that on shotguns, it only works in VATS
---
On a side note, I was so happy to find a B/50/25 combat shotgun for 2.5k caps just when the VATS accuracy bug has been revealed
---
Have more then 110hp, you can't be 1 shot. Ez.
---
One time I was hiding in a bush face up against a tree.  A fellow wookie came and hid in my bush, right behind me, gun basically pointed at the back of my head.  Somehow the blind bastard never realized I was there after 2 and a half minutes. Right as the circle was closing in behind us I frog legged backwards, landed behind him inside the storm and blasted him in the ass and downed him.  Laughed my ass off before a squad of 4 took me out.
---
Hopefully that inspired him to be just a little more observant.
---
It actually reset this past Monday, so it would have been available to you anytime this week. It still reset last week Saturday so I was able to buy it on August 1st (Saturday), again on August 3rd (Monday), but it‚Äôs not available for me again until tomorrow
---
Bethesda make 1 cap max pls
---
Yup, the exact situation I'm in with Secret Service armour
---
I went in with 1 stim and 1 stim extra and got it.  I did it right at the start.
---
I was really looking for an lmg, and I had used the .50 for a while so I was wanting to try something new. The lmg and my be flamer are the weapons I use now.
---
doc, this is heavy

I keep this saved just for that.

Has only happened once for me, i just assumed they were making room for a friend.
---
Thank you for the offer. Mattie_1S1K sold my one last night!
---
Does flux still spoil faster outside a nuke zone or was that always a myth?
---
All the time. I wish that when there is an event in a location it would make that the primary option. I've also had trouble a lot lately just getting the fast travel to work. Both to events and anywhere else. Where I have to tell it to move me there, click okay to pay the caps, then it doesn't move me. Sometimes I have to try 3-4 times to fast travel.
---
That Smiley dude can‚Äôt be trusted. He reminds me of Smokey and the bandit. (Oh lord, i‚Äôm getting old)
---
Just hit 77. I feel ya
---
part of the game mechanic. it makes u have a deal with a vendor bot in particular and use trade mechanic in general. It is a some kind of push or kick in ass to make u part of it.
---
Yeah outfits have been massed dupped so dont fall for an outfit for alot of caps. like longshoreman(use to be rarest) i have gotten for 1.5k many times so just got to keep looking around to find them
---
I would love to see the additions you suggest.  My camps tend to look like they belong naturally in the world...so a random encounter has you scratch your head, ‚ÄúIs this a place I haven‚Äôt encountered yet or a player camp?‚Äù   The Flea was a no-brainer purchase.
---
(adds a cosmetic broken down corvega, but it takes just enough camp budget so you have to choose between it and garage)
---
Upvote upvote upvote
---
I've had 5 two shot or trouble shooters combat or double barrel shotguns drop in the last week all magic with +33vats, been selling them for 2-5k one sat for over a month at 6k
---
I need an "oh shit sorry my Tesla clipped you" and middle finger emotes
---
Yeah I remember a guy off this sub posted his findings with taming and he was able to find and tame a level 95 scorched deathclaw and upon relogging it had turned into a level 21.
---
no cap limit but every 24 hours you lose all caps
---
We‚Äôre gonna see a lot more of these over the next couple of weeks too.
---
(Mannequin laughter)
---
After a number of tries I managed to do it with a stim pack and stimpack extra - also had as many DR and rad resist cards as I could play.
---
Okay than. I did server hop after will it still make it to my camp? Im on a private server now hoping itnwill make it alive.
---
(slams super mutant fist): "Chally is Moo Moo!"
---
I made my character look old for that very reason.  It's safe to assume that since was the lone (or one of very few) vault that was sincerely intended to serve the function of rebuilding civilization, candidates were selected for physical hardiness as well as skills.  And maybe a family history of longevity.
---
Also, who's saying they only recruited accomplished professionals?  They could have thrown in some promising young people.  Hopefully they used a test a little more advanced than G.O.A.T. haha.
---
And don't forget the sage words of Dr. Strangelove:  "And since ze males vould be required to do prodigious service alonk zees lines, ze females vould heif to be selected for zeir sexual characteristics, vich vould heif to be uff a ... highly stimulating nature..."
---
You want to grind to get a full secret service set. I personally like having weight reduction on my armor. Rad resistance won't hurt since it's one thing that serendipity can't dodge
---
Invest in SS. For now id recommend Forest scout, the mods are really expensive tho.
---
private blood...
---
So stupid.  There has to be something in the code for it where you could make it not arc to other players unless they're engaged in pvp already.  Something like IF(pvp=false), THEN(arc=false).   Or simply, IF(playercontrolledcharacter) (THEN)don'ttarget(unless)pvp=true  
---
btw, I DON'T know code, but I hope my point got across.
---
If someone in your group is one shoting everything you don't get loot right?   need a tag like everything else i thought?  How do respawns work for getting fixing material? (I thought angryturtle said new people joining server can respawn stuff)  I seem to not get any material when I farm an already nuked zone, then once in a while I'll get lucky and mobs drop 2-4 of the materials each, I have no clue why it seems to be feast or famine.
---
Not for the reasons you‚Äôve said but because the rewards, for me, are worthless.
---
Guys its concrete now and the event site mentions we only provided a very small percentage ...  4.6m could this resource be the most difficult one to hamster?
---
Especially given that it is a Fasnacht character, it should be available.
---
I'm too drunk, but the fasnacht helmet? father face with the armor, better than combat failure.
---
[edit: SS helmet is Super Shit too]
---
Ah yes, the true Fallout 76 experience...
---
Unfortunately no, even though it is a Fasnacht character named Waggis and he was even in this year's march. üòî
---
god
---
you just keep hammering that "I'm a pathetic dumb little nerd" hammer right on the had, dontcha?
---
4.6 million in a day. Only 141.1 to go. Imagine how much cork is going to miss by!!!
---
Scrap and stash your junk before you hit the button. Remove your armor if you can't afford to repair any damage you take. 
---
Do those 2 things and there's literally no consquense for dying...  If someone jumps you, move to another workshop and stay crouched while you're there.
---
I started where I knew there were a few boxes near the edge of the map. I was lucky enough to find a Box with an extra stim pack so I went in the fire till I was almost dead.  Stepped out of the fire for a few seconds used my extra stim pack and went back in for the rest of the duration.
---
Not sure how you can be a dumb nerd... but you kind of just proved my point
---
Huh? I didn't need anything else then what I had already the computer jus kept saying error after I loaded the sample.. but after joining a private server I went straight in, put the fuse in, and the computer finally worked!!
---
Honestly, I'm expecting this next year when the enclave follows the BoS from the west coast. The expansions have been mirroring the main quest line in terms of factions. Vault, responders, raiders, BoS, enclave became overseer, foundation, crater, atlas..
---
I expect to see the whitespring open those conference rooms in 2021.
---
I'm a non-PA user and I don't like gear which only works when you're at low health or some other bad effect.    
---
I've heard that Instigating and Two-Shot weapons are good. It depends on what you're playstyle is without PA. My main for instance is a Stealth Sniper VATS and one armor piece has the Chameleon effect. I also have Fix it Good, Weapon Artisan, and Gun Nut all maxed out. When I repair things, I made sure the first two are equipped so I get max return on mats.    
---
If you're not melee avoid gear with melee effects. I think Robot Armor gives equal protection all around but I'm sure you could find out more on the Fallout wiki and then choose the effects that best suit you.
---
In your illegitimate list, Pioneer Scout Possum stuff is obtainable via the [Pioneer Scout Possum vendor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Possum_vending_machine).
---
36% is where the Rank 1 card starts, so knowing Bethesda they probably "fixed" whatever they broke an hour before the update went live and then didn't turn on the level modifier.
---
I remove people who don‚Äôt mute their mic.
---
what does your setup look like?
---
When I tame something I usually fast travel to another zone then log out, play a round of NW and then do stuff far away from my camp for a while. Can't say that helps for sure but I've read that not being in the same area as the pet will keep stuff from spawning around it while it moves to your camp.
---
I definitely need a drunken one for after sunday brunch one lmao
---
If you are on a team, your teammates' kills are lootable (see 4a) you just won't get xp.
---
I couldn't find it there. Got a screenshot?
---
Imagine lurking the subreddit of a broken game all day, commenting some bullshit on every other post, and  thinking the loser is anyone but you üòÇ
---
Haha dang you got me
---
If I need to make room for a friend.  I will remove myself and start a new team,  that way everyone is in a team
---
Good info.    
---
However, it wasn't until the last few days when someone nuked Grafton and another area that isn't Whitesprings or The SBQ area. I managed to get enough to craft the flux needed to make the Secret Service Underarmor Shielded Lining. I was VERY lucky.    
---
B/c of fewer other mats needed to stabilize them, I ended up with around 250 Inert Flux which I kept some for hydration. I don't know what else I can use what Stable Fluxes I do have but I am keeping them.    
---
I wish BGS would have made the changes in enemies look visually different instead of name changes, HP, and drops.
---
That‚Äôs not me, ha ha I barely ever go on mic.
---
I tried to explain how if it was supper easy all the die hard players would run out of stuff to do. But nobody wanted to hear that. Got a lot of down votes.
---
That‚Äôs a good way to do it. I figured it was just because I was low level
---
Much obliged!
---
**text chat mod is alive and active.** I wish i could get everyone to use it, and i really dont understand why one would choose not to. i've gotten more good weapons from trading, free stuff, etc. its a goldmine for trade and assistance.
---
Someone told me it you're in a group you can look enemies that anyone kills in your group. It's only the higher enemies like the SBQ, Sheepsquatch, etc. where you have to do X damage to be able to get loot from it.    
---
I could be wrong on some of it and I know there are people who know more than me on this.
---
I need to learn it then lol
---
I remove people who do not share cards
---
thats obvious: he hates everything bigger than him. why should a teddy bear else carry around a camping seat?   
---
gnomes are next.
---
Main reason I brought it up. Overseer in-game says she'd rebuild Sutton first.
---
So what are they not being traded on the subs if they‚Äôre so heavily duped.
---
It is hard to hit things when you got the shakes
---
Ok I‚Äôll add you now
---
Yeah you can, though in some places there‚Äôs a bug where items you place down pop up a floor above of where you place them (or the roof if there‚Äôs only one floor) you can circumvent this by placing the item on a small rug anywhere outside, then selecting and placing the rug where you want the item to be in the house, as the rug will carry the item with it and even have a outline so you can place it properly.
---
Where do you buy spots? I didn‚Äôt get on yesterday so I want to advance the one spot I missed
---
Unfortunately after this latest patch, this method doesn't work anymore. Is there still a workaround?
---
76 is an MMO at its core.    
---
MMOs are designed to be a time sink. Too much time given for little reward. You don't own anything in the game despite paying for the game or anything extra like items bought with Atoms. Should BGS decide to cancel 76 or they go bankrupt (among other things) it's all data and you'll lose all of it.    
---
Time is what you've given up and you cannot get it back. If anything, make your time the most efficient when you do play. I've almost completely given up on Seasons. I knew weeks ago I wasn't going to hit 100 and I'm not going to try. The rewards are bad considering the many things they could have come up with.
---
Nice one! I can see that being funny when I come to do it üòä
---
[a week or so ago someone posted a really good emote that would be part of the Follow Me tree that was a "Legendary Over Here"](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i0hc59/i_made_a_example_of_what_a_legendary_over_here/) emote..
---
I thought it was pretty good
---
Crimson for Ultracite 2mm EC (Gauss), Violet for Ultracite .50/5mm/almost any regular bullet, Cobalt (?) for Ultracite shotgun, Yellowcake(?) for Ultracite Fusion/Plasma Cores. Most PA mods require fluxes, Many underarmor mods, too.
---
how can you tell when shotguns in vats are bugged, most one shot anything shy of a 95 behemoth
---
Because that 'person' was *unbearable* and tried to *claw* his way to the top of the mob using his *bare* hands. 
---
Sorry, I like puns so *bear* with me.
---
... (Todd face)
---
I take offense to ‚Äòbest and brightest‚Äô. I got into the Vault by dumb luck. An assigned member of Security crashed his car on the way to the Vault and I was the first ‚Äòqualified‚Äô replacement they ran into before they sealed the door. R.L. McCoy is in his early 50s. (Full bio somewhere on reddit).
---
Where is Sandra's house? I'm losing my mind searching for it.
---
Well the story I wrote for my 76 character is she was born in the vault.
---
She is in no way a talented engineer or anything like that, not like the rest of the vault. Yet it‚Äôs fallen to her to be one of the people fixing everything outside the vault... She‚Äôs basically a monumental f*ck up that can‚Äôt do anything right. 
---
(Another annoyed dweller asking her what she‚Äôs doing and her usual response is ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM DOING MY BEST.‚Äù)
---
A dude removed someone from my team the other day.  Was just me and him and someone joined and he removed him a little later.  I assumed it was for not sharing cards but I dunno.
---
I run 1chameleon, 1auto-stim and 1troubleshooters on all my toons.. the 4th and 5th vary according to whatever seems like the best thing Ive got at any given time...
---
mixed types also.. I care more about the effects than the type as long as its max level...
---
Something I do that makes farming this stuff much easier is wait a while after a nuke drops so everyone else gets their killing in first. The nuke zones last long enough that stuff will eventually respawn and then you're not fighting with other people for the kills.
---
I would love a motorcycle - like the ones in fallout 4
---
Do you have to survive for a minute all during one match, or can it be over multiple matches? I've done it like 5 times and still haven't gotten the challenge complete.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm not sure just wondered what the causes could be
---
Shhhh!!!!   It‚Äôll end up at the top of the list of patch items that none of the players want!
---
In my mind - the tough part here is most of us want to feel progression;  their characters getting stronger.  
---
But - I think there is an answer to this.  Forgetting real geography here - let's pretend the world was surrounded by an ocean, and there were islands out there.  You could take a ferry to this area with a different rule set (as you explain it) with more difficult loot.
---
There is no ‚Äúpoint to get,‚Äù you‚Äôre simply wrong
---
Any "survive for x minutes " requires 1 minute increments
---
Garbage take, had to dig up this dead post just to let ya know Johnny Guitar&gt; ain‚Äôt that a kick in the dick

Bender?
---
Underarmors are largely under appreciated.    
---
The Vault Suit Treatetd Lining gives  a +1 to END and Luck. IMO, permanent bonuses to stats from a base layer are always a plus no matter the build.    
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fallout\_76\_underarmors](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fallout_76_underarmors)    
---
IMO, all characters should pursue some level of an underarmor that can be upgraded and focus on the best they can at the time.    
---
I got the SS Underarmor over a week ago and 2 days ago finally got the Flux needed to craft the Shielded Lining for it which is the best for that UA. Outfits provide no tangible benefit for me. When the armors are so mixed up then covering that up with one is ok at times. No one really cares what you have. They care what they have.
---
Right but u can wear under armour and an outfit. I have the ss one atm. Had marine before
---
Yea I was curious when that happened too.  Only thing I can think of.
---
Biggest value for ss is the innate RR and jet pack, if you're into that.
---
Who?
---
The remodeling is done, they are waiting on the state building inspector
---
Im sure theyll have one in the near future
---
I like keeping info like this on games I like. Thanks for this.
---
She put something out saying she‚Äôs working on compiling quakecon info.
---
It has to be one full minute. Just gather a few stims and you can do it easily.
---
FO76 youtuber more popular than captainoob or angryturtle.

Fallout New Vegas-style ‚Äòtrade balance‚Äô screen.  Why the f don‚Äôt we still have that on ALL transactions?
---
I never have it on me unstabilized for long enough to find out.
---
What annoyed me is how she keeps acting tough and threatening me. Unless you a level 50 major gutsy, I eat Handys like you for breakfast.
---
She was in holidays she made a vid 2 days ago?
---
That's your prerogative, but don't think many will change their build so they can share a perk. I for one will not do that.
---
Aren't all of the vehicles using fusion and those are all coolant pumps and what not?
---
It‚Äôs a little frustrating but I guess it‚Äôs not a huge deal since I usually only jump into groups to get dailies done. I really haven‚Äôt been playing much otherwise
---
It's not your personal terminal - everyone gets the same quest marker in that ***public*** event - so it is, in fact, anyone's call. Doing what you're ~~asking~~ demanding would be a ***courtesy***.  
---
I would just be grateful that someone is paying attention to at least one of the objectives.
---
oh
---
That sounds great theres just one problem with that... Attention Citizens, Nuclear Strike Imanant...
---
I wear it on my main with the yellow slicker hat. You can buy it from the travelling responder bot like the hunters long coat. I don't see many grey fisherman's overalls though
---
The loading time and the lag is a joke since that last update for me. Also just died falling through the world floor and then it crashed. Good times, was fine till the update, basically unplayable at the moment
---
Traveling Pharmacy 3 or Chemist backpack, iirc. I use Cgemist backpack &amp; Thru Hiker 3, so it might be Thru Hiker.
---
Adios. Buh byeee
---
Ss is better than all the rest people already had. And they grind SS. So I‚Äôm going to say yep
---
Since the BOS are returning and we are getting BOS Collectron (potentially) - A military installation.
---
Alternatively: courthouse (use the flag poles from tadpole challenges on the background of the court room), school, car mechanic (now with the new atom shop item), church, museum (art museum and/or use display cases), clinic, grocery store (put non perishable food items in display cases).
---
No. DR after 350 has diminishing returns. It wouldn't be useful
---
I really love how Bethesda's shit writing has retroactively tarnished the founder of one of the most important and ever-present factions in the franchise.
---
Working on her only fans page
---
I hope they do a big event for it. Like the Settlers want to fix the robot issue so we have to help them fight ally he robots to make repairs to open up the resort.
---
It could be like the Vault events where only groups can go in.
---
meh
---
Also, please be courteous of others camps. Nukes Destroy Camps!
---
If it‚Äôs on pc should be able to log in with your same toons.
---
Aw crud. I just got hit with it too. I'm on PS4. I guess I'll just focus on the Wastelanders questline until this gets fixed. I was actually pretty impressed by how far the game has come but dang, this sucks :/
---
I cant enter the Flatwoods in any direction to have my newbie quests and xp.. that's insane, everythime it crashes the game !
---
Tesla rifles are still causing players to crash?
---
Like those Skyrim guards that talk smack to you after watching you *shout a dragon out of the sky*.
---
You think you can take me? Go ahead on.
---
It's on PC, apologies, i forgot to specify my platform. I tried googling but i got no info from it whatsoever.
---
Very useful, thank you.
---
If it‚Äôs pc to pc it should be fine. Only cross platform u can‚Äôt do
---
all day? going down the new page takes what, 5 minutes?
---
Enable pacifist in settings and nobody can hurt u and u can‚Äôt hurt them
---
Cobalt... you already have the best place, Morgantown. 
---
While the area near foundation might net you more flux, the terrain there is just awful and makes for a slow collection.
---
I've done Morgantown for the full 2 hours once. Once is all it takes to find out that you don't need that many stabilizing agents. It took me 3 days to harvest enough flux to use it up.
---
I just did this quest on my new character today (about 2 hours ago).  I was informed that they put out a silent hotfix for this quest already (and the one for Lou).  These quests should work as intended now.
---
I like the damage numbers as well, but I always consider them very subjective
---
Whenever I play by myself I make a public team. If people join that‚Äôs great. If not I don‚Äôt care. I mainly use the public team for the 4x experience. And to have multiple free fast travel spots. The players, their camp, or their tent. 
---
The ONLY time I ever kick somebody out of the team is if my gf or my friend joins my server. I kick out the lowest level player to make room.  
---
Most people kick out low levels because they much rather have a high level player that Will share a perk that benefits everybody. 
---
Even if we aren‚Äôt holding hands and going on missions together, I rather have a level 100+ on my team, than somebody under level 30
---
I understand you guys want to join a team to get the benefits and extra experience and rank up easier. 
---
So you‚Äôre better off making your own team that way you won‚Äôt get kicked out.
---
How do you know it‚Äôs less than 20 people? And how do you know they‚Äôre without power armor and/or proper gear?
---
Two solutions,  a) Make it un-nukable b) just do what foundation and crater does, just wear radiation suits. Also I'm assuming most of the city will be robots, considering the only NPCs from Vault 76 is the Overseer and security. And a guy named James. And most of us will just be running everywhere, we'll need those robots and James to look after things.
---
Charleston. While I like your thoughts on all of the suggestions you gave, to me, Charleston makes even more sense. It's geographic location between the forest and ash heap makes it a logical place to go in the main progression once you finish with Flatwoods and morgantown. It's fairly centrally located in the map and, lore wise it's the former seat of the government which, in my mind, is what Reclamation should become - the new central government of Appalachia.
---
All new factions have representatives including vendors in their own little areas. Development quests can include rebuilding the dam and reclaiming the capital building.
---
Otherwise, I agree that player vendors should remain in camps but I support everything else you suggest.
---
I have Piper's Outfit and Cap despite the character isn't born yet. üòÜ  
---
I have all of the Guille paints for everything so that's what's on my main char's armor.  
---
I have the blood eagle outfit and a few others which I put on occasionally. I'm ont one into grinding for hours upon hours for a TINY chance at getting something.
---
I've seen the glassed caverns, doesn't look like an army down there
---
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
---
It depends, does the new set have a jetpack?
---
Okay that makes a lot of sense
---
I'm rocking a Protective Vault 51 Jumpsuit Str+1, End+1, Int+2, Lck+1...perfect for the xp hungry Legendary Run.
---
I also have the SS underarmour for when this madness ends (or rather pauses). 
---
...not that anyone will ever see under my Enclave Officers outfit.
---
all those bugs, i feel so at home. its all exactly the same stuff i fight with on PC,
---
Good question
---
I‚Äôve been looking for Urban Scout Underarmor for ages, wasn‚Äôt sure it existed until now.
---
I see you get downvoted yet bethesda is struggling to release some legendary perks for over 6 months now....and they dream about shelters and such.
---
I suddenly got the Recipe for Ultracite .45 and another when I never saw plans for them. My main has used a max level Fixer and a Two Shot 3 star Combat Rifle. I never had those recepies before but may I didn't look as I sort by Craftable when I make ammo.
---
I donated 40k steel and had pretty everything I wanted from these crates. Concrete is way harder to farm so I doubt we will able to satisfy Dorsye¬¥s hunger.
---
Roger Maxson didn‚Äôt give orders to go down there. They lost communications with the western brotherhood before they all died. It was taggerdys decision to go down there and fight the scorched.
---
They have power armor, there‚Äôs tons of dead BOS laying around in 51b, and there‚Äôs way more than 20 dead BOS scattered throughout Appalachia. So you‚Äôre blaming Maxson when you should be blaming taggerdy
---
You make a good point...
---
You mean like solar or thorn?
---
One main thing I would suggest is, having main or event quests, where the former vault 76 residents secure support from each of the in-game factions (crater, foundation,BoS) these could be something like:
---
**Event examples:**
---
**-BoS** the event would be initiated after talking to a BoS NPC, who is responsible for guarding their base, he promises to put a good word in for the vault dwellers if they proofed to him, that they are as valuable as they say they are, some version of his dialogue would play on the speakers ( the event would need a few hours of cooldown), then the first stage of the event would be to gather bait from wildlife which will spawn in the area outside of any BoS defences (similar to project paradise but not as long). after the initial wave of wildlife has been killed the vault dwellers will then need to interact with trees in the area to throw bait in them, this will then trigger a wave of floaters to appear which need to be defeated after their death a super mutant behemoth scream will be heard along with normal super mutants chanting as if they are angry (something along the lines of "they kill pets, we kill them"/ "why humans do this"), the event concludes with this wave being defeated (the behemoth should be buffed up as it's supposed to be the "boss" of the event, maybe make it a three star legendary as well) to end the event there will be another broadcast with the guards admittance of the fact that they need the vault dwellers too and that they will follow up on their promise
---
generally the event should essentially be the vault dwellers luring enemys to their doorstep, that the BoS would not be able to defeat on their own and then defeating them, thus asserting their position as needed. (I know this may be a bit malicious for some characters, that's part of why I put it as an event instead of a main quest.)
---
**-Foundation** this one will take place on an outpost which would need to be added, just so it doesn't interrupt daily gameplay for others. It will initiate on a timer/randomly and the set up is an emergency call of said outpost as their defenses are down and the walls are damaged, initially they will ask for help with repairs, the first stage is one where players need to simply carry supply crates towards the damaged walls and turrets (they should be some bigger ones like there are at some workshops instead of the small common ones), next there would be attacks of blood eagles and a broadcast, that they must've sabotaged the defenses and that the vault dwellers need to protect the repairmen (those would be NPCs in power armor, probably excavator for the industrial look) after the first wave the walls will come up and after the second the turrets, that'll lead to the final wave with multiple "heavy gunner" blood eagles who are also legendary, after those are defeated, the event will end after any of the participants talks to the outposts supervisor, who will then again assure their support for the vault dwellers

**-Crater** this one would also start at random or on a timer, the set up is a call for help from the raiders due to supply shortages, with this one there could be multiple locations (could be blood eagle/ mutant camps or other random locations, I'd also suggest to include the burrows as I think the location needs to be spotlighted more). When entering the event are one will hear meg explain that crater needs supplies and that anyone capable in the area should help them clear the location, some raider NPCs will also be there and "help" the players though I think most of them should die during the event, the first stage is straightforward, the area will need to be cleared from any hostiles (they will spawn specifically for the event and then in higher numbers/levels to not have it be too easy, legendary enemys also should be included) after the initial hostiles are dealt with there will be a collection phase with crates spawning around the location, they should be collected in an event wide pool with no drop-off as to not interrupt the flow of the event, the rewards will also depend on what milestone for collected crates is reached, after the first collection some kind of location specific boss should appear (for example scorchbeast for bog, sheepsquatsh for divide, deathclaw for any caves, wendigo for burrows) the appearance should be scripted as such one of the raider NPCs is killed by its entrance (this one should just be spawned right before the appearance, as it might otherwise not work out if he dies during the first phase) after killing the boss meg will be pleased and announce her support for the dwellers as they can get shit done.
---
**Main quest examples:**
---
**-Foundation/Crater** tensions are rising between the raiders of crater and the settlers of foundation, so the overseer (or potential reclamation/city76 major) will ask the player to keep the peace once again, now they will first talk to both factions and there should be additional options for those who have max reputation for either of them, the base-line ones would be getting enough supplies for the raiders to leave foundation alone or helping foundation to reinforce defenses so the raiders won't be able to go any further with their robbing, both of these options would secure support from either of the factions but not both until the next option comes available, which is when the player has max reputation with crater the option to persuade them not to attack foundation but to set-up trade relations instead should pop-up which would involve a diplomatic expedition to foundation where meg and paige meet, during this meeting the situation should escalate to meg holding paige at gun point, so the player needs to negotiate and prevent further hostilities (there could also be an option to kill paige but that's hard to implement as not all characters of either faction are in an instanced interior, might be able to "replace" him/make him a puppet to meg though), the option for those with max settler reputation would lead to the same thing, a diplomatic mission which offers to establish trade which then goes a bit wrong. Those with high rep for both will obviously have both options to choose and may have some extra dialogue/an easier time during negotiation) the negotiation parts of both sides of the quests will still be possible after doing one of the base-line options as a "more permanent solution" but it should be available immediately for those who have the reputation already and this is also when the vault dwellers come into play as they can serve as neutral trading grounds for them (also a canon reason to allow both raider and settler traders in the player city)
---
**-BoS** I am not too familiar with the goals of the branch of the BoS we will be seeing so this will be short, I assume it could also be a negotiation or "fetch" mission related to tech, where the BoS will be persuaded to start a technology trade by the player fetching and showing off some kind of impressive "old-world" tech, during negotiations this would obviously be presented to the BoS as the only option to safe-guard any of it/ have some control over who has access as they will be made to believe that those kinds of things will need to go through them before distribution.
---
I hope you like my ideas and I welcome any feedback, I was actually thinking of making a similar post sharing some of my ideas, so this thread is here at a perfect time.
---
As to where I think the city should be located, I think sutton would be best as it would automatically involve the overseers support, you could have the pre-war conversion style on the already existent buildings and for example put the shops there but then add to those in the more post-war construction kind of style by having walkways and entirely new shacks added between their roofs, so you would have all the other commodities there, you could be able to look down into the marked which would feel a bit cramped but because of that also busy and have different colored lights in different shops, so it would look truly amazing during the night, this would also allow the player shops to be right beside each other in an alley way as to not have them be unfair location wise.
---
Yes, this would be so nice I lose so many legendaries in bushs and crap and sucks.
---
While I don‚Äôt want to see the event fail, it will be very interesting if it does. 
---
Considering how many people claimed it would complete no matter what we did, if it does fail, that would prove them wrong.
---
And that would be a satisfying alternate reward to the banner.
---
I think that that comes with the Prime Receiver plan.
---
https://imgur.com/a/bB53v0d
---
It's also the first three items listed on the wiki's vendor list.
---
while youre waiting for this to be implemented.. use a prosnap camera
---
Yup, that much cork and concrete is hugely optimistic, even if there were actual GOOD rewards for the event.  I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôll make plastic either, but cloth and leather shouldn‚Äôt be too bad.
---
I‚Äôve been a 1st member since the start, and across all characters I barely have 5k cork or concrete.  Steel falls in your lap constantly, but those?  You have to hunt for it.
---
I think if you link your game pass to [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net), it should be fine.  
---
If you are buying it to n steam, also link your steam to bethesda.
---
I hope it does fail. Bethesda deserves backlash. People not giving a shit about this poorly implemented event would be a at least a start
---
Yeah, duping. I only sell high value plans, rest are just dropped.
---
Far fewer items scrap to give concrete compared to steel that is so easy to get hold of.
---
I've found because large supplies are now highly sought and many of my runs come back empty handed. Still I've managed 500 and working in my 3rd delivery between earning score.
---
&gt; I have a heck of a time getting caps... 
---
I cook &amp; sell all meat.  Using butcher's perk (double meat) and then the luck perk to double up on crafting 30% of the time.   
---
Load it all up on mule characters who then sell 1400/worth a day.
---
maybe only have a sales board kind of deal, where you can check out some of the trades of each player, they'd need to choose lets say 3 items to be shown there, so you could look at those when shopping there with other vendors and then get interested in the players stock instead of just being able to get all the items there, I think that could even help traffic but there should be a way where you "mark" those you are interested in and then get pointed towards the players camp who is selling it, so you don't need to check the name and search for it as that would be kind of tedious.
---
‚ÄúConstructive comment! could have just not replied, saved us both time.‚Äù
---
Not expecting anyone to change their build. If they have insufficient charisma I would understand, but i don't have time for explanations. If they cannot bring at least one card to the table I need to make room for someone who can.
---
I've been contemplating making a lower level one and turning off Demo Expert for the event.  Of course when people don't share nice, I just use my bloodied and say eff em!
---
Sounds good. Should be able to grab from the vendor
---
I have never seen weights in the prison yard, cos theyve always been stolen before I get there!
---
Yeah, she even says that she'd rebuild sutton first, so she could initiate the whole thing
---
It funny, but your camp world require more server load than the stashbox does, and the stashbox requires more than an identical camp that lacks one.
---
Once something had been moved from the world into your inventory, it's just a value inside a parameter.  Everyone has two of these for inventory and stash.
---
The stashbox itself, however, is another object with permanence the game has to track and render in 4 dimensions (XYZ and interact). It also carries with it another set of values and parameters for inventory that non-1st players don't have.
---
Aesthetic camps have more permanent objects to track, and each object carries it's own server load.
---
Depends. 
---
One of my camps is near an assault spawn, and that character hit max rep fast.
---
I've tried to build nearborgers but not as successful.
---
Well, my game pass is tied to my xbox account (it's game pass ultimate, it includes game pass for xbox and game pass for pc which is where i'm playing the game currently), and my xbox account is tied to my [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) account which is where i'll be buying the game tomorrow..
---
Nope, F*ck this challenge and to Hell with Nuclear Winter. Skipping it today.
---
TLDR: doesnt work
---
I encountered the bug 3 days ago, tried it again after switching servers, after restarting the game and today after rebooting the pc. I also tried colecting the other samples, but it wont let me(watched a youtube video to get the locations, but pressing space to colect samples didnt do anything). Now I'm waiting on a fix.....
---
It's a good post, for sure. However, at this point we have too much evidence of features/bug fixes being implemented with no thought put into how they should work or their side-effects, as well as an insane amount of regression, that most of this post is simply irrelevant to beth--they are not following 90% of whats in this post.
---
Thanks! I see the mix up. I have the skirt accidentally on the illegitimate list. It's the Pioneer Scout Possum Uniform one that is illegitimate
---
My guess was the bookcase in the mysteries mansion.

I equipped ghoulish and stayed alive for like 4 minutes. I may have to use this in the future. Thanks!

---
Fixed and thanks for feedback
---
Yeah I bought the SS PA helmet like an idiot an idiot so I'm looking for a combo of armor to use in the mean time
---
I would love cross play, since the PC market is soooo much cheaper than xbox. Kids be asking for your 401k for garbage, and pc I see giveaways, so id love that

I'm over lvl 400 and i adore having low levels on my teams! Gives me a chance to spoil them and help if needed!
---
Will there be updates made to this list at all?
---
Lol sounds like a mob threat.
---
Between her, Juicehead and Angry Turtle she is the easiest to listen to, and well organised. Turtle does alot of useful research but the heavy accent is difficult at times and close captioning on Youtube sucks. Juicehead has useful info but a hell of a lot of speculation and he just kinds grates on me.
---
I appreciate the help, but I said I was aware of what the key was used for, I'm asking about the crypt note
---
Only certain effects make them bugged.  I have a Fancy Shotgun with limb damage and you can tell the damage is bugged on shotguns when the damage numbers are all weird and different.  The shotgun I was using is a BE25 Pump and when it's not dealing bugged damage the numbers are all uniform.
---
Whitesprings only gets cleaned up when the Enclave returns to finish you filthy muties! &lt;3
---
Yea, what concerns me about this is that not only are we likely to fail the concrete donation, but also some of the others like the cork and plastic ones. I guess that means no banner and no extra score weekends/week.
---
This right here.
---
I barely have 250 Concrete between 3 characters.  It's just not something I find unless I'm building a CAMP, and then I make a quick detour to the Monorail Elevator.
---
If *Russell Dorsey* was willing to take 200 or so, maybe I could help.  But no, he demands no less than 250.  So screw him.
---
I went with the Settlers, only because Many A True Nerd went with Raiders though. This way I got to experience both sets of quests.
---
I could see that, though the note specifies it's a crypt door
---
Quick correction on the flux uses.  Violet is for ultracite fusion cores, not yellowcake.
---
Oh good!
---
Not true, their use is filling up your inventory with garbage
---
That's awesome. I love roleplaying like that.
---
Well I said they would auto complete. I‚Äôve not donated a thing. And won‚Äôt not because I think they will give us the reward or not but because I couldn‚Äôt care less if they do. The only reward worth having is the purveyor sale.
---
I heard that there was supposed to be, but it was cut.
---
This was happening to me earlier in Project Paradise, I was in the sludge area and the molerats kept spawning and dying instantly,l thought I was going crazy and someone was hiding away just 1shotting them as they spawned.
---
We will see if we see.
---
Good advice. I'm a fairly high level and I keep it on pretty much all the time unless I'm actually looking to PvP. It's a pain hitting/getting hit by someone during an event especially. Plus I'm a junk collector boi so I can't bare to lose *my preciousssss* if I die.
---
That is the kind of stuff I am talking about.  I am someone who really wanted to like this game, was hoping they would improve on it and eventually it would become something great.  But patch 21 just really rubbed me the wrong way and left me with the feeling that they aren't even trying anymore.
---
Yeah I was afraid of that possibility
---
Isn't there a mansion with a mausoleum on the property? I think I'll be exploring the cemeteries and mansions today.
---
They probably just ran out of time or whatever.  Idk.

I hate how juice refuses to just take a stance on anything. He always says this new shitty development is "odd" when the word you're looking for is shitty lol

Do you have a ballpark of what a 2\* set would run me in caps/trade?
---
Oh I didn't hear about that... Now I wonder if it was me going to a private server that fixed it or it was already fixed by Bethesda lol.. either way I'm just super glad it worked!!
---
What IF they added the old type of power armor? The fallout 3 an new Vegas type that slaps on to each limb and didn't require a fusion core or a power armor chassis? Then have legendary variants drop in game or craft it. Only difference to actual power armor is it weighs a more than any other set of armor and sneak can't work with it well but it receives both regular armor mods like deep pocketed and power armor mods like more carry capacity on the legs. All the perks also works with it like serendipity and heavy weapon perks gain benefits from it too.
---
There may be, if we knew who owned the Overlook Cabin then maybe we could check his house?
---
What's your IG name, so we can avoid you?
---
After day 1. If concrete completes u know there‚Äôs a chance that there‚Äôs been. Help shall we say. Hope there is for the players that need a dbl score weekend. Although to my mind the majority will be the duper‚Äôs that lost two weeks being suspended and I‚Äôm not sure they deserve any help
---
It‚Äôs battle royals and very unbalanced, after a long wait in the lobby your luck in finding something useful in the first minute dictates the rest of your play session. I‚Äôve seen several times a single-digit level found a 50 cal and mowed down a team of high levels wielding pipes and assaultron heads. It‚Äôs more fair than ‚Äòsurvival‚Äô which was a shit show of duped items and nothing else. But it relies solely on luck and is not fun if you‚Äôre into reliable fps pvp battles. For that you should stick to COD, BF, CS, etc. Cheating is sometimes an issue especially on PC but it exits in all pvp games.
---
Yea but un nuckable targets seem kinda wack, i agree with the radiation suit theory if the target were un nuckable people would nuke just close enough to catch the closest spawns.
---
I've done a lot of Line in the Sand recently, and tons of meat/ash/goo piles are formed with no lag. So it's not just the meat piles.
---
Yup. That's the plan. Next update will be meat week and wendigo collosus. Whichever is first
---
I just realized that I spat out "other commodities" without explaining, so I want to elaborate on some things I have been thinking about, they could add service "vendors" like barbers or doctors on the "upper level" which would do the same as in FA4 for example, though the barbers would mostly be for flair, in addition I was thinking of "photo booths" where you can enter a location with your team and have different settings to take photos in, a shooting range would be nice as well (maybe also instanced but not sure) where you have dummys which actually show your damage and dps, while you can configure their resistances for testing (this would make many things easier and help test out that weapon you just bought in the marked) other than that I have a concept for a caps sink and an actual currency backed by the gold which isn't just literally gold itself, they could add 76caps/VaultCaps(VCs) which are nuka cola caps which had a vault gear stanced on them, their value would be much higher than that of regular caps and would be accepted by faction vendors in stead of them, there should be a place (which also includes the stanceing machines) where you can freely exchange them, just so you can get rid of some caps when you are close to the cap, without actually wasting them. These caps could then be used as a secondary currency for normal purchases as well as special uses (a casino in the player city?) but I wouldn't want to lock things behind them too much as they are supposed to be a general currency, not an annoying lump of gold I can only exchange for plans
---
He stays neutral, he just wants to inform people.
---
Other things to check are negative effects of any addictions and the modded hit chance of your weapons. Otherwise, no idea.  
---
I'm a rifle build and have an assortment of rifles to use. Autos have lower hit, but still should be above 50% at medium ranges, though would need to double check in game at what ranges are specific hit chances.
---
Because everyone realized it's not worth it
---
PS4
---
Lets empty this clip from a bloodied shotgun into a level 5 scorched, then have to bash it to finish it off.
---
Ive done lots of line in the sand with no ash or goo piles and it still happens so who knows
---
*I can still hear you sayin you would never break the chain*
---
I have a junkies shotgun with 33% vats, is it double magic?
---
I might have to cop her onlyfans üëÄ
---
I think plastic will be easier. I can get 200 a server from the hs. It‚Äôs just not a commonly occurring item like steel is.
---
Awesome. Looking forward to it. Good luck.
---
No lol only one effect is needed and applies
---
Unless it has ss stats with a full set buff
---
Nice! This could help out new players a lot
---
I believe that's how we get an unkillable raging grahm
---
My thoughts exactly. Apparently if you leave after collecting the t fuse and sample, without placing either, then rejoin and place the blood first then the fuse apparently it‚Äôs worked for a few people in this thread.
---
Excellent RP concept! Stories like this make the game.
---
Appalachian missed connections.
---
Right on, same here. I have a main character that is a lvl 166 now so I drop stims when I see someone low level. Between all my characters I‚Äôm in the 300‚Äôs lol
---
Thanks a bunch this is an awesome list
---
You can claim it from the atomic shop on the 10th. [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7ck87LOpAKn6x3pVy5OPBZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-august-2020-updates](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7ck87LOpAKn6x3pVy5OPBZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-august-2020-updates)
---
Anybody looking for a fix take this advice and read the top comments in the thread
---
Yeah that's what I thought at first but it was happening in every location and the bodies of the radstags where just dead in piles with the venison n them where they spawned and then at the end no alpha spawned? It just completed the event, I never had to kill anything, just fill the troughs... It was super weird!
---
The next set would be Marine armor
---
Hurt your feelings, meatshield?
---
Pc Xbox or ps4?
---
Unlikely, the old power armor IS the new power armor, they just changed the mechanics so PA felt differently than just walking around in leather armor. We may see the return of old armor types though. Expeditions was mentioned to be partly fan service for people who wanted to see regions we had previously explored as well as new ones that got lost in between old locations.
---
Yeah the workarounds on pc still need to be found. Or I guess wait till it‚Äôs patched but that could be a couple months
---
I have no problems listening to any of them. The trio add up to probably the best source of unbiased YouTube information. They are obviously ans of the game but not Fanboys/girls and are willing to criticise when needed...which is too often. 
---
AT - Best for weapon/armour/perks. Does sometime feel like it's a little to heavily Endgame focused but he's open about it and does critise OP items such as the Magic weapons. 
---
JH - aggregates much of the generic news and views in to a single package. Very occasionally does take hearsay a little to much as gospel, although ironically is very critical of Reddit. 
---
IS - More about all-level gameplay + news. Whilst she mentions Reddit I seem to get a 'it's Reddit but I've doubled checked it' vibe.

I think a wasteland can drive anyone mad, thats why I can see it that way. I'm sure with that amount of vault dwellers, theres bound to be some that want to rule the wasteland or whatever. Hell, we can even blame it on chems. Even though theres no written lore, I think pvp makes sense in this game. Needs a buttload of work, but without that the wasteland is much too safe and not all that threatening. Everybody knows the most dangerous enemy in a pa wasteland is another human.
---
accuracy is ass on two shot.. anti armor alllll day yo
---
Did you leave and restart the game in between collecting the fuse/sample and placing them?
---
I definitely agree that the fact that it has to be exact increments of 250 is stupid. It should have been just donate however much you feel like
---
Both of those items released bugged and you could claim them free from the atom shop. If I had to guess they may have attempted to fix them and remove them from players that got them free and thus created a new bug.  
---
edit: spelling error
---
Tbh I hate when people sell plans, most like all high levels ha E everything ammo is goo 556,45, fuel,and bloodied and junkies weapons and u yielding armor
---
I literally shot 2 people today because they came sheltering in my bush and both times we both had a very delayed reaction
---
Bloody heavy wep user you'll want uny with ap regen as second perk, that way dodgy is always available third perk if you don't need the weight reduction would best be cavalier or sentinal (75% chance to avoid 15%damage (per piece) while running or standing still respectively)
---
Which is 60% ..... of the base damage...
---
If this armor is just a middleman between you and the ss I‚Äôd probably suggest Combat armor with the BoS mod or marine armor. Just depends on how concerned you are with dads early on. Unyielding is your best bet, from there I‚Äôd suggest just get the legendary effects you prefer. I like some limb protection so I can jump around more often personally
---
better hope he doesnt have more than 5.9 braincells and just fast travels to 76

Yep, you're right. Sorry!

He's running... That's why I went to go give him a care package.
---
I think its obvious that Charleston is off the table. Its too big and plays too important role in many quests. It has to be smaller more concentrated location without some big story/quest attached like suggested Sutton.
---
Dang, Thanks!

And this is why the community is fantastic!
---
Farming west tek gives a bunch of plastic too because of scrapper + laser rifles and super sledges
---
No problem!
---
Hard to disagree with that.
---
When all the evidence points towards it.
---
I don't think this is the case.  So I would be able to transfer items from my Xbox character to PC pool if so?
---
Where*
---
Still it's just a idea that merges both non power armor and power armor together as un-powered powered armor so that you get benefits from both archetypes in mods and perks.
---
Also...its supposed to be 10% increase, per kill, to 60% for 30 seconds...not 60% off the bat
---
Poor guy must've been body slammed on his head as a baby
---
i saw the falling scorch for the first time today, when did that start?

It needs to fail. This event sucks.

Just as I thought, you wont put **your** beef where your mouth runs.

The FO4 version of the PA display is even in the game already in the Garrahan Mining HQ

+1 for flying Brahmin

+1 for your username being a "The State" reference.

Those fires in the Ash Heap have done that since launch, they aren't O's thats just how the particle effect looks (so this is unrelated to the 'Chain' bug OP is experiencing). It looks strange because the VFX are incorrectly white instead of grey/black (or the fires are using incorrect VFX entirely).
---
flatwood, south of the church and the workshop west of charleston fire dept are the first things on my mind.
---
I spent 2 hours server hopping and farming concrete, got to 524, its just not easy to farm. Like other comments, I agree that this is one of them we can't/won't complete.
---
Lmfao. Best thread ive read this week
---
Its thru hiker
---
Interesting. Never heard or noticed that they are bugged. At some Infos I can work with thanks. No problem my spelling isn't better in general haha
---
I donated 500 concrete from my fo1st stash box. And it pretty much wiped me out. I have had the stash since March of this year. Guess I don‚Äôt pick up much concrete.
---
I havnt fooled with it much in 76 because it‚Äôs so weak every time I use it, but the missle launcher and fat man were my favorite weapons in fallout 4
---
How is perk load outs even going to solve the issue of needing multiple characters? That's only useful if the loadouts you plan on using match the exact same special stats. Never mind that having multiple characters allows for more thematic rping by joining specific factions. Surprised they haven't just went the ESO route and just charged us atoms to unlock additional slots tbh.
---
I concur.
---
Have you tried bibliophile?
---
You're the first person to ever get my username. That's one of my favorite skits from the show.

not what if, when will
---
grindy mcgrinderson when it does

I hope they bring back pauldrons, I feel like they're missing
---
Patch 22 will work as well as old people fuck drunk.
---
I did this event like 100 and have only gotten reciepes and arnor plans. Granted im level 225 and have the other generaters but I want the windmill so ive been gei ding this event Nd cant seen to get any generater plans
---
There is a concrete extractor location directly east of the Gorge Junkyard where I have my camp. Also directly west of that across the street is a steel extractor location
---
Not confirmed, just relaying second hand info so I could be wrong.
---
Was Ghoulish alone enough to keep you alive or did you still need Stimpaks? I really don't want use 6 Level-Ups to move enough points to Endurance so I can equip the card and then 6 more to move them back.
---
Because they don't want players to grind everything at once because they want people to play everyday getting everything
---
Yeah just that card
---
Nah we're gonna be making them autoaxes soon, cutting millions of pieces of steel for the B.O.S.
---
Unfortunately it does not include consoles to PC or vice versa.
---
I think a fixer is best.  Full auto probably better than semi auto.
---
Where can one easily farm concrete? Can you just server hop Monorail elevator to collect the concrete?
---
I'm curious if they'd even be willing to let that happen.  They could play off one missed event as a bad estimate, but multiple makes it look like either they have no idea how to run an event like this, they have no insight into what loot is out there in their own game, or that they don't have enough active players.
---
The last one they should really be worried about, because it could get media traction.
---
good.
---
My second time on nukashine I ended up in the big at level 11- ran all the way back to Whitespring. Wild, terrifying and so exciting
---
Nice. Guess I'm going back in for one more shot. Thank you very much!
---
Theres the armco from max raider rep and gold
---
Or the workshop one thats an exploit
---
Probably. In the first of four days for concrete we only raised under 5M.  150M is impossible at this point.
---
I don't have all of the data to be able to math it out, but I'm pretty sure when people claim the Bog town base they're making it impossible for the 13 world bags to respawn because they're within visible range.  
---
You get 7 scrap per bag so 91 vs what seems like 1 scrap per minute x3 extractors.  Why would I want to harvest 180 an hour when I could get something closer to 2,700/ hour?
---
How many servers are there? Could we even mine the scrap through four entire days? I feel like they wanted us to fail and I really wanted that banner.
---
I "farm" the Charleston bot for his rare outfits to stock my store. I rarely see these outfits in other player vendors and they still sell through enough to keep me selling them.

\*Thith week
---
Fantastic! Thank you so much!
---
No, it‚Äôs a ‚Äòhack‚Äô.
---
There is a ammo thing you get from the raiders for bullion... but I suspect what you are seeing is an exploit involving blueprints and the ammo factory
---
Not the workshop one. It‚Äôs just like any other resource producer
---
It‚Äôs a bug, I‚Äôm not risking it cause it‚Äôs such a major exploit and could possibly get you banned, but you go munitions factory and blueprint the wire attached to the ammo producer and then you can place that blueprint at your camp I believe (I‚Äôve looked it up once, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs still how it‚Äôs done)
---
STILL NOT BEEN FIXED

Could be. I saw a guy at Tyler county dirt track had like 21
---
Hey man, late to the party. I'm available for charity.
---
This chap was Lv2 and ended up in the Divide on the Mire border
---
I do not believe so.  I may have one if you are on Xbox
---
The only ammo producer that isnt an exploit, requires you to have max raider rep, and you buy the plan for gold bullion at the crater
---
This is it :   https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/8/81/ArmCo_ammunition_construction_appliance.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20200601231057
---
Fill team off and go directly into it. Or use stimpaks / the ghoulish perk and go directly into it.
---
Seems like this is one to skip if your only interest is the SCORE, you'd probably be better off just looking for a Line in the Sand.
---
Wait, Tank Killer doesn‚Äôt work with auto rifles in adventure mode??
---
Nope. You can‚Äôt transfer it. I‚Äôm not sure if someone can build at your camp but my guess is no
---
I want to plan a heist and steal the corvega from under Nuka World
---
Can't go wrong with The Fixer combat rifle variant. Getting the plans from the Encryptid event will add it to the legendary loot pool so you can potentially get three legendary perks in addition to its' innate stealth bonus and stealth movement speed buff.
---
Yes that‚Äôs an exploit
---
Depends on the weapon. I used a lvl 50 hunting rifle with a .50 receiver and and the anti-armor did more than the two-shot.
---
With a standard receiver, two shot did more.
---
For a .50 cal machine gun it's the same idea. If you have a prime receiver, anti-armor does more damage.
---
People are putting their tents on the spawn point, which causes the mass scorched drops.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that plan dropped once for everyone‚Äôs first time completing the event.
---
It would explain why the Sleezy Heart Bed is kid-sized.
---
Yo, join us at [https://discord.gg/aXrVxE](https://discord.gg/aXrVxE) , we are a big Enclave group who plays daily (basically you'll have people to play with daily, on any platform, ps4/pc/xbox) and yeah, i assume you will enjoy it here. Best of luck to you, wastelander
---
I didn't learn it until after the event was over, so I got one everytime I did it.
---
Naw, I just won't be witchhunted
---
In the short term, just shop players. Get a full set, and then improve individual pieces w SS or regular as you find/buy them.
---
Good attributes are plus to endurance, intelligence and perception. I find at least one piece of poison resist, and some rad resist to be useful.
---
Great armor has AP refresh or Sentinel; god armor has both.
---
&gt; Have you tried bibliophile?
---
Are you asking if I am one, or if they threaten my sexuality?
---
That skit is also one of my favorites (right up there with Antonio, the sexy foreign exchange student and of course $240 worth of pudding). The mental image of Ken Marino eating protein powder right out of the jar with a spoon never fails to make me laugh.
---
Good call
---
Apparently it does and was broken for a while, from what I can gather (after reading that post) but people are all contradicting each other and most evidence is anecdotal. But considering the frequent SBQ staggers, it's safe to assume that it affects the auto Handmades and Fixers out there üòê
---
Well if they survive they‚Äôll be a lot stronger!
---
damn lol thanks
---
I would love to join the pc version only reason I got it on ps4 was because friends wanted to play. They got bored and I stayed but I have invested way to much time to move to pc from fresh
---
Do you NOT share cards when you can, and if so why?
---
Best bet is to open a support ticket
---
Fuck, I love seeing the community like this. Y'all are both good people.
---
If you didn't learn it, it could drop again....but it's also not supposed to be tradeable so it was kind of pointless to not learn it lol.
---
Lol. I guess I‚Äôve learned something new yet again.
---
I hope he enjoys the trip, like no sarcasm, really hope he has a good time
---
The depth of this game can‚Äôt compete internally against fallout 5 or star field. They got your money already they will continue to flatten out this game because they only want virtual doll houses and any activity of anything tied to rng with no odds.
---
Bro the flies.  Or if you just turn up the volume you hear them. Makes me wanna ralph.
---
The Monorail is a good spot as well as the large brick building at the Abandoned Bog Town. The Bog Town is also a great workshop to take over for concrete as it has three extractors for it
---
I have found if I go up to the extractor by way of the two steps on one side it SOMETIMES wont burn me. But not everytime.
---
Can you survive 1 minute without any stimpacks or no?
---
I didn't realize it worked that way until I kept getting them.  I just can't remember if I dropped them or not.  I have 100s of Fasnacht plans on a mule because I don't know if they are worth anything.
---
Theres a way to fling yourself across the map in less than 10 seconds that doesnt involve the jetpack. It can crash your game though lol. Its just fun to do for shits and giggles.
---
NW is the best.
---
Waiting for the laying down emote to come back to the shop for this
---
Settlers if you're a shotgun build Raiders if youre a rifle build.  If neither of those interest you the Raiders have an ammo machine Settlers have a grenade that grows plants
---
I like how raider gangs are so different. Some are flat out assholes (76 raiders as you described). Some are nothing more than edgy drug addicted teenagers (generic raiders). Some are extremely violent and sadistic and loving killing people in cruel and unthinkable ways (Disciples). And some just act like post-apocalyptic furries (Pack).
---
The fixer and the handmade are great. You need to get the fixer plans from encrypted though. So if you can only get a handmade for now that‚Äôs a great choice. They have lower damage then the gauss rifle pictured. But they make up for it in ammo capacity and a much faster fire rate. I tend to use my handmade for free aim since it has much less kick back then the fixer.
---
I only have 249 concrete. I dont go around picking up everything I see. I find it tedious. 
---
And I dont have much cork neither. So il take a pass at donating either of them.
---
Cloth and plastic, sure.
---
Also, dont be a public team leader when taking a workshop. If you are a public team leader, you will always show up on the map with a big marker even if you are crouched.
---
‚ÄúAnother one from downtown‚Äù
---
I don't think its bad estimates or lack of active players the problem comes down to rewards... those provisions are a joke and all the rewards were spread about by dupers a long time ago.
---
If there was some new or rare plans or a better new loot table I'd be more likely to part with my junk but because the rewards are so crappy after the 2500 steel I gave I don't plan on donating another single thing the rest of the event. A lot of those I play with feel the same.
---
They go out of their way to make changes that leave only daily‚Äôs and events as the choice for engagement with this game. If you find anything interesting that doesn‚Äôt have their direct control they will nerf. 
---
No one cared when they nerfed punji boards. Some people were actually happy. Now it‚Äôs the doll house makers turn to feel it with the nerfs to camp building.
---
Well, The storm damage is pretty low early in the game and some people have been looting Arktos Pahrma in the storm by using Ghoulish perk. 
---
This challenge is a suicide mission in my opinion üòÇ
---
I personally run a bloodied rifleman build. Gauss rifle is nuts, I do 2.7k damage when in sneak.
---
Next best, explosive lever action. Then handmade rifle, then combat rifle.
---
Can I donate my infinite fo 1st box to broken cosmetics? No
---
I have a feeling it will drop again during Meat Week as you will be able to get the Chally beer stein from that event. I‚Äôm assuming it will drop off the bat like it did during fashnacht.
---
You need 3 Charisma to share a 1 pointer. Impossible when the build has only 1 point in it.
---
Yeth. Yeth it ith
---
It grants the full amount of SCORE needed for whatever level you're on, so it's much more efficient to wait until the end and buy the higher levels.
---
There was a visual bug on PTS which caused the chain lightning to not show when outdoors. A lot of people didn't realize it was a visual bug, and thought Tesla rifles were nerfed to no longer chain.
---
So, no, Bethesda doesn't seem to be planning on removing the chain lightning. On the contrary, the latest update fixed the damage desync bug which had been affecting the chain lightning since release.
---
NV was about the story and it was more rpgish.
---
Enough to reverse the duping ban-wave.
---
Have the state inspector robot show up then.  They fail of course.  So we help them get back into spec.  Solved.
---
Concrete and Cork were always going to be tough. As I couldn't care less about the BOS, I don't feel the need to contribute my hard won resources towards the goal.
---
Just playing NW is a suicide mission for me so the challenge is definitely keeping in line.
---
Oh, I never figured out the most recent mechanic.  As long as I go loot crazy on the open world (not boxes), then the concrete will respawn without a timegate?
---
Sorry I'm on xbox, but good luck!
---
Literally the rarest item in the game lol
---
I only have 300hrs or so and it's happened to me a few times. 
---
It also turns out I'm terrible at PVP.
---
Idk why you were downvoted, you arw right. Things like the red asylum, b2525, responders fireman were all mass duped. I know someone personally who has several hundred of each (he was banned, but his account got brought back and he still had all his items) and he just sells and trades them to suckers who happen not to have one. Soooo many people and getting severley lowballed rn because they think they are still rare when they really aren't. I know one duper, but he is part of a whole discord group who all do the same thing, posing on market reddit as legitimate traders when they are really just taking advantage of people. Rip to the people in market reddit unaware that there are a SHIT ton of long time dupers in there posing as legit traders.
---
It would be nice to at least be able to give allies at our camp better weapons than revolvers and pipe pistols.
---
Find at least one stimpack. Go in. Let it get down to 20% or so. Get out. Stim yourself. Go back in. Should be pretty close. May need one more stim
---
I'm awful as well - being an old fart, I don't have the hand-eye coordination of these young kids today.
---
Now that's an ebic Reddit moment üò©üí¶
---
Huh....I'll have to look into the info on it.
---
Just curious but how come the red and teal Fuzzy Mining helmets are considered illegitimate if you can get them from Camden Park?
---
More than it did but less than it should. Slug buster is a pretty decent weapon.
---
I agree with the post, disagree with the title.
---
Those are just my thoughts, but a survival mode could be just what this game needs to bring in some new players and really open a new chapter
---
Energy weapons work with the aa prefix but iirc only base damage is impacted. So it works, just not as well as ballistic.
---
Pretty good ideas, but BGS will never implement it.
---
Can you build a floor piece with stairs so you can jump on top of the extractor?
---
I run a bloodied sniper gauss build . I can do upto 5k damage on queen with crit shots

---
This can also be used for commando builds with a Bffr The Fixer
---
i played with a 2 shot grenade launcher for fun and it was inaccurate af.
---
50 caps when you die.
---
Even if they just brought stock survival mode back, and implemented different mechanics over time, but god damn is the normal game so boring. I need smth to spice it up until rust comes to XB1!
---
Ahh thank you for this! Now for another day of grinding endlessly for the Forest &amp; Urban Scout masks lol \*\*big sigh\*\*
---
I think it‚Äôs long enough. Not everyone has that much time
---
You'd assume I'd be award for the event, or at least faschnat since like someone else said one of the robots wear it.
---
That‚Äôs what I figured. Thanks for the reply!
---
True, and I have had that build, but not my problem.
---
Yep. That‚Äôs what I figured lol
---
I had a similar issue, where I spent a (thankfully) lower number of points and received...
---
Nothing!  :D
---
Were they also going make ultralight available as well?
---
I think it's multiple things all coming together, but the rewards are certainly part of it.  I handed in 250 steel and received a couple beers, and I was done. 
---
Even if the rewards were good, I don't get concrete for scrapping every trash weapon I pick up though.  I don't think they put enough thought into the numbers for some of the materials, unless they're really counting on exploiters covering it and even then, how much concrete or cork are they really sitting on.  And, going back to the point of rewards, why would they give a shit to turn it in?
---
This event is pretty half-assed in every way.  The totals don't seem to have been thought out.  The rewards certainly weren't thought out.  There's nothing going on in-game other than the handins.  There are no special events happening on the map. Nothing's evolving.  There's nothing to DO.   It's just one stationary NPC and a collection box.
---
I'm half glad it's not because I've had one for years and I love throwing it on with my pink shit and following people lol
---
Plus you misread the question "when you can"
---
Truly sorry, I didn‚Äôt know him, I had just randomly met him during the SBQ. I‚Äôm sorry you were had an unpleasant experience, a presume you googled him and found this?
---
Heck, you didn‚Äôt need to go that far. Just head down to Watoga underground.
---
That was me at a low level when I first got the MIRV grenade with that perk that increases explosion radius. I blew my ass into the ceiling about 10 times before getting that perk!
---
Damn, I actually wanted the banner

Ok thanks
---
It's really easy to do but for some reason mine just makes 10mm
---
Checking in... Sunday and I just bought the game to try and give them another chance... and lookie here.. Bethesda being Bethesda.
---
Agreed, it‚Äôs literally the only reward I wanted out of all of them
---
Not since the new update. It's now been fixed to Monday.
---
Bold of you to assume I don't run with pacifist on already.
---
That's weird.  Maybe it's locked for players that already had the quest when patch 21 kicked in.  I logged on this morning and got the quest.  Went and killed a feral ghoul and was able to take his blood sample just fine.  Went and got the T fuse as well.  I was then able to finish the quest right afterwards.
---
Laughs in jetpack noises
---
‚ÄúUnintended feature‚Äù of FO1st.
---
Two questions:
---
1. Why is Morgantown so good for the masses and the fluids as opposed to other locations since they drop from enemies?
---
2. Nuking Morgantown can somewhat screw new players who don‚Äôt know enough to avoid a nuke zone. Do you have any alternative locations?
---
This appears to be missing NW seasonal rewards, e.g. the beanie, the glowing skeleton costume, the ghile suit, etc.
---
Search this subreddit for things like "tips for new players"
---
Did the same 1 week ago. Was subbed for a while, but now with my base budget already at max, with only atom bought items. So there no need for the monthly allowance.
---
Got thousands of resources stashed. I will miss that tent. But I won't be buying back into the membership till a serious content drop comes out. Like that "One appalacia" or if they reduce the monthly cost. Till then I'll just grind away with the rest of you.
---
i know you can dress your allies.  You cant give them guns?
---
Thanks bruh
---
Just a hunch, but I‚Äôm betting that the instanced interior camps will be in the Whitespring where there are currently locked hand scan doors. I‚Äôm imagining a future update where you can get a cabin or room in the resort as a separate cell to decorate. 
---
If we could get a mix of NPCs running the bunker and Whitespring, I think the Enclave would be back in business...
---
I genuinely hope the fallout tv show thats potentially happening covers the scorched war and we get to see first hand the death of west Virginia, such a great story, uncovering what happened in a dead wasteland really added to the atmosphere as well.
---
You mean bullion?
---
for real tho
---
Could be cool. But I suppose the tv show will be its own story. More introductory.
---
Any chance you're on PC? I gave a two shot shotgun, shells, stims, water, and a couple other low level legendarys to a level 7 the other day. Wonder if that was you haha.
---
No txt chat for consoles either sadly
---
Ooooooh fuckyes, i‚Äôll check em out rn thank you.
---
I don't even have 250 concrete.  Like others have pointed out, there are far less options for concrete generation and you're not going to have much unless you have been specifically farming it for a long time
---
I swear I saw people saying they message others on consoles. maybe not in-game chat, some kind of inner chat or whatever it's called
---
Karma is a bitch served with a shell üòÇüòÇ
---
No prob!
---
It‚Äôs not worth it if you are bloodied imo.   I stopped using it.
---
There's a quest that unlocks it at Garrahan Mining Headquarters.
---
He did have a point on the scorchbeasts - nukes would do way more damage than they would in game. Of course, he also didn‚Äôt realize just how many scorched their were or how dire the situation was. Though he was definitely stupid not to advise them to ask for help, or, at least, not push harder for them to.
---
Also, I doubt weapon leveling is a thing in lore.
---
I had the same problem i had to change my house
---

Click on the sign outside the rusty pick its a sandwich board that starts the mission btw if you have someone give you an excavator then wear it and just scan it inside ghram mining company to finish the mission otherwise craft it equip it then scan it
---
Oh well yea we have PS messages and Xbox chat, I can't speak for Xbox chat but PlayStation chat is about as broken as 76 lol
---
I‚Äôm on console üò´üò´
---
Read the sign about the PA at the mining HQ.
---
If on xbox I can guide u later
---
Appreciate the tip guys, I'll just have to give er' a trial run and see if I notice the difference too much.  Maybe I'll use the quad for pve
---
I'm so happy there's none for pc xD
---
Just keep an eye on the patch notes each time they come out
---
Whatever theyve broken with stealth and vats, wont be something a hotfix can solve
---
Instead of scrap, i want to donate junk...... The Brotherhood needs 100,000 Gnomes
---
You are comparing one of the worst effect combos (tse) to the absolute best one (b25). Agi is worthless on heavy gun.
---
Have to attach a terminal to it and select the ammo you want.
---
I'd rather see them add legendary power armor parts instead of re-introducing an old system which they thought to be "bad"
---
Pretty sure this was a ploy to get all the duped junk out of the game. Most dupers didn't dupe concrete, cork, or really anything other than ammo and weapon components. I kinda hope the event fails just as a glaring beacon of how out of touch Beth is with the player base.
---
Edit: To be clear, thank your local duper for your new beret.
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets)
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
yeah, Sorry, just wanted to vent because it was a little frustrating losing two workshops to him. Didn't mean for you to delete your post
---
Thats way better than just going to flatwoods.
---
I'm using the one it came with
---
Isn't rust on consoles?
---
Problem with their numbers are that only Steel seems to be the one that you can get without really intentionally farming junk. Concrete pretty much requires competition between players over static spawns of the junk, and resource nodes that we compete over from workshops.
---
Watch internet historian fall of 76, it‚Äôs all in there
---
I think the scorched story is a good introduction, what happened, the major factions all get set up, they shouldn't mention the enclave, and its fairly close to the nukes as well.
---
It‚Äôs coming to consoles, but not yet sadly.
---
Do you have any test results to share?
---
Would be cool to see the military truck from 3 and new Vegas.
---
This has happened to me. And I don't launch nukes often so it takes me like 30+ minutes to go through the silo. I launch the nuke, fast travel back to my base so I can get out my heavy gun I use for the sbq and switch my perks and fast traveled to the event. At this point the event started 30 seconds to a minute ago and i fast traveled over there to find the queen with a sliver of health left. Couldn't even get enough damage in to get my reward. I don't even think i've launched a nuke since then. If bethesda had their priorities straight they would have done implemented being able to loot event legendary whether you got in a shot or not. Haven't they mentioned this in the past? I coulda swore they said they was going to do something like this but it seems like it was forever ago and just another empty promise
---
Is this the hack or the one from the raiders?
---
Thanks. I decided not to include the seasonal stuff. Only items that are permanently in the game
---
50-150 for all plans
---
I walk like I'm over encumbered but I'm not and I can't use vats. I can still fast travel. Lmk what else you want to know.
---
That was a steam issue and actually for once didn‚Äôt seem to involve Bethesda.
---
If you really like thorn armor it might be worth keeping your uny set till you roll thorn uny peices
---
Thanks for sharing
---
Remove all the outside stairs before moving.
---
Cool didn't know tse was so bad
---
I would suggest NW, thats where I got mine completed at.
---
It's 2020, people still play this garbage?
---
Awesome!
---
I donated like 25k steel. From 2 characters with first, I‚Äôve been able to rustle up 750 concrete. I might get one more lot done by the 11th, maybe 2 if work isn‚Äôt carnage.
---
Doubt it‚Äôs going to be enough though, especially given that‚Äôs the weekend volume!

A flamer also works pretty well!
---
Hey. Good question. The ones you get from Camden park are just called "Mr. Fuzzy Mining helmet" and come in three colours: pink, yellow, green.
---
There are also items called Mr Fuzzy Red Hard Hat and Mr Fuzzy Teal Hard Hat which are not legitimate.
---
Is the latter what you mean?
---
the game is still buggy, if you want to give it another try buy it for 20‚Ç¨ not the deluxe edition
---
no you can't use you char you had on your ps4 
---
I love it, but after reaching level 103 it became a bit boring
---
Submitted a ticket this last night, no response.
---
Not yet at least. Though it would be pretty cool.
---
Yes. Definitely worth it. 
---
Also don‚Äôt bother with the wastelanders deluxe edition. It just adds a few outfits and cosmetics.
---
You have to showup to the items "poetry reading" with a sign that says  "We love you and are proud of your life choices" Then you should be able to place the item.
---
Morgantown has a lot of enemy spawns, on a short respawn timer. Shorter than white springs. I have not found anything comparable in yield.
---
I don't even bother with water sales. A single radiation rumble or line in the sand and I cap the vendors.
---
If those don't pop while I'm on, my normal XP route usually does the trick.
---
Yeah I hope you're right, until then it's on my casting couch room desk
---
It does work.
---
Because you only need concrete for camp building/repair. The only time I stock up is when I‚Äôm planning on a brick dwelling.
---
Honestly they dont need specific perks they just need to be add to the two-handed and one-handed perks
---
Visual glitch that occurs if you go to adventure from nuclear winter.  That larger zone doesn‚Äôt actually exist.
---
Ive seen that happen a few times before. Not sure if that means you'll get irradiated in the outer blast zone.
---
Oh, [I saw one like that](https://i.imgur.com/2tbtvyF.png) at Whitespring.
---
Shit I didn't realize until later that fucked me up:
---
Unlike previous Fallout games, weapons and armor are levelled.  You can't equip stuff that's above your current level.  When you get plans for crafting armor pieces and weaponry, you will be able to craft higher level versions as you level up.  When you're low level you level up quickly, so **don't invest your hard-earned junk slapping mods on everything and repairing stuff**.  Levels 1-10, just hoard junk.  You'll find weapons and armor to replace your gear as it degrades.  After level 10 or 15, start modding your gear.  Most mods will reduce the durability of the item and/or increase the resources needed to repair it.  If you're lucky enough to find the mod plans to upgrade your leather or metal armor, resist the urge to improve your armor rating until you figure out what is required to repair that shit.  I found this out the hard way - my improved metal armor sucked up my screws trying to keep it repaired, so I switched to leather, and the improved leather required ballistic material which was even harder to come by.  Just struggle through with your naff gear until you have A) the really worthwhile plans for mods, and B) the reaources to keep improved gear repaired.

Better to save your scrap to make the level 10 version when you hit level 10, than modding the level 5 version.  You're gonna level really fast early on.  Later, it's worth modding your shit.
---
You have the Bloody Chef outfit there. That is effectively seasonal.
---
I miss my cage armor üò¢
---
Stop cheating bro
---
I would welcome this. But then, adding versions that are a higher level than 20 as well as legendary versions will be needed.
---
Huh. Suppose that makes sense since it‚Äôs supposed to be a low level area, and they probably expect players to be moving through it pretty quickly.
---
Good to know.
---
Not cheating. I was planning to take over Appalachia
---
Yeah I thought that's the case as well, but wasn't sure, thanks for clarification!
---
That's more than understandable, jobs, family, all that jazz comes first. So just keep in mind it's mostly cosmetic minus the caps, gold, and scrip. And that's all easy to obtain in game at your own pace (more or less). If you really want them you can just pay, as I near the end I keep calculating how many atoms will just finish this off. I dont need that fireplace, but I want it and if comes down to it (and it wont) I'll buy it.
---
You and the Plan Collectors are awesome. Keep doing it, it‚Äôs all greatly appreciated!
---
I see what you are saying. I have chosen to include events that come/go (Fasnacht, meat week, mischief night) but (so far) not the seasonal nuclear winter ones. 
---
I guess if they come back, I will probably include
---
Sorry I misread OP and your comment.  I thought it was Xbox account to PC.  I'm not sure why they don't allow it.
---
I found a little "island" in the Cranberry bog and built [a little town](https://imgur.com/a/YCR2ARB) there. It's got a motel, garage, ammo shop, and a mini Slocum's Joe.
---
We also need an Enclave Collectron. Someone to give two fingers to the Brotherhood as they pass your CAMP.
---
I feel you haha. Just bought the game and I'm really enjoying it, wish there were some pvp activities outside Nuclear Winter but exploration, crafting and camping are all great.
---
I also just met a dude yesterday who gave me 25 stimpaks after asking me if I was a new player. Couldn't respond because I didn't have a mic set up, but trusted me and gave them anyway.
---
Despite bugs and this sub being pretty negative (can't blame them) I'm having a blast and the community is great.
---
I'm sorry.  I would be super upset if that happened.  The load times kill your ability to make it down in time.  I still haven't launched a nuke.  I've watched people do it on YouTube and I don't think I can do it.
---
i had 5000 concrete and only had 1st for 2 months so imagine those who have had it much longer will have way more. Same goes for steel. I had 100k of it. Cork. I don't think we'll do it. BUT i imagine it'll get done.
---
Every time I launch a nuke I'm afraid this will happen. I don't have enough carry weight to carry the gun I use on the SBQ and collect steel so I have to take a second to place my tent and grab it. Every time I'm so scared they're gonna absolutely obliterate her and I can't get a hit in
---
IMO this was an unrealistic number, even if there wasn't the widespread displeasure with the current situation.  The cork one is ludicrous. For example my stash had 55k steel in it, and I was surprised(I'm a hoarder) to see I had only 1.2K concrete &amp; 700 cork.
---
Whomever came up with the numbers either screwed up or doesn't play the game.
---
Happened to me a lot last month, but not recently. *shrug*
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
I had 19,000+ steel. I donated maybe 3000 for the hell of it. (I also farmed all that back and then some last night.)
---
I have 650 cork... Unless we're donating 10 concrete and 10 cork at a whack, I don't see it happening. Not at 250.
---
Decided to buy the bundle because I wanted the car. Junk walls don‚Äôt fit in my current camp, but they‚Äôll be incredibly useful later on if I decide to move.
---
Actually after reading some comments I think the coolest way to implement this would be to add a "Tool Maniac" perk line for damage (either three ones as it is with rifleman etc. or one 5 point one like it is for explosives and then maybe have the percentage sit above 60% more like the 100% it was originally as the tool dmg numbers are usually really low) that includes things like the chainsaw, buzz blade, ripper, drill, shovel and the like. That would also open up possibilities for other power tools to be added like large drills or jack-hammers
---
#theresamodforthat
---
Is that true?!
---
Maybe try out Conan Exile if you like building/Survival/pvp it's not perfect but f76 is so full of exploits that new players would be turned off fast. I don't know if there are enough hours in day to make such a mode feasible or remotely enjoyable for a new player in f76.
---
If you land near the Pioneers Camp, you should find boxes with Rad-X, Med-X and Buffout. Use them together and you'll last longer than a minute. Also, arrange your perk cards so that Radiation is a positive.
---
Jumped into Encrypted as a pylon and the group killed the boss, I thought I might have a hit or two on the boss but nothing to loot.
---
I‚Äôm thinking the pylon-players should get a legendary for being brave enough to volunteer.
---
I used to work at AWS... on tech docs. I don't think that was an option either.
---
maybe they also signed off
---
Does it also work for all mutations?
---
There was when you spawned in, they could have left seconds after you logged in. Have you built somewhere popular?
---
Bwahahahaha 
---
^sorry
---
Concrete is easy at nodes, cork however...
---
its entirely possible that the server you loaded you in on, which is not necessarily the server you were on last time, has or recently had a camp set up in the zone of where your camp was
---
well after 1 day the website shows 4.75mil donated concrete.  I'm doing my part by not giving them any :P
---
I actually use a bloodied black powder rifle and am having fun with it, I recommend giving it a try in case you are specced for rifles
---
I'd rather not skip this part of the quest but I'd also like to start to get bullion so... ugh
---
Is there actually loot outside of the safe zone?
---
I never ended up anywhere exciting. I woke up on top of a Red Rocket somewhere, and on top of Slocums Joe, and in the midst of a group of Yao Guai at Colonel Kelly Monument.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 sorry
---
Its damage output is not fine lol
---
I'll have to give them a try
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs possible, but 6 server jumps just to find one that isn‚Äôt occupied seems a bit much to me üòÖ
---
Check out angry turtles youtube Channel
---
Lunchboxes stack with the Cranberry relish and the sleeping XP. Only other way is the perk in charisma called inspirational which adds 15%, increasing your intelligence will also increase your experience gain. Join a building team to get the bonus int. Herbivore mutation will double the effect of the relish to 20%
---
What are the other rolls on them?
---
The only reason I have my Tesla is for when this happens. However ever since I've gotten it, it hasn't happened
---
Nah, the RNG is too much. I managed to make an unyielding chest piece with nice stats just for the jetpack but it took so many tries I didn't bother making the limbs. I also made like 100 weapons and they're all crap before giving up on the whole legendary crafting cuz it's such a waste of time and inventory space. I also wasn't able to play at all when I was grinding it cuz I had to wait for scrip reset to be able to move.
---
I won't be grinding it anymore but I'll make one every now and then if I have space/modules but at this point I'm so exhausted by the RNG that I don't even farm daily scrip anymore and just turn in what I find during dailies and log off to play something else.
---
Ideally this would also to be able to hold them even more accountable for their shit game, but they don‚Äôt care
---
agreed thats a bit excessive, one of the drawbacks to not being able to select an open world server
---
Bffr by a land slide
---
The 250 minimum is a big problem. I had 100+ for an age before I finally found a good stash, and then I was stuck at 200+ for more time.
---
Imo Minimum donations should be equivalent to 1 bulked which would allow far more lower level players to contribute. Its also become obvious high levels are chasing the same Bags and Gnomes which are already in limited supply.
---
I noticed that. I put a few hundred adhesive, plastic, acid and nuclear material in my vendor for 1-3 caps each and it didn't even take 5 minutes for a level 500 dude to buy them all.
---
I definitely agree, that would look great, much more value for the donation than what you get from consuming it
---
25% if your on a team with another mutant
---
Nope. Sad.
---
Careful for what you wish
---
The exploit. I'm honestly surprised it's so easy it seems intentional
---
I'm using the slowest original xbox one and it's still working fine after the patch... just a shot in the dark but are you running it in 4k or the upscaled 4k? You could try tweaking the xbox video settings and see if that changes anything (it wouldn't be a real fix, I guess just a test for the hell of it?). Haven't heard of anyone else running into this, seems really weird... all that stuff should have fixed it.
---
Where do you get the gauss shotgun?
---
I remember when I got the card it told me to put it in, and I didn't know what would happen so I did. Little did I know how obliterated I was about to get.
---
Vry sad. So there is no reason why I shouldnt put my T-60 chest piece on my T-51b set?
---
No, I'm on xbox. Unfortunately my PC stutters too much for FO76.
---
I would like there to be a version of the gauss-rifle, which is craftable with legendary modules, as it feels kind of unfair to rifleman, just as it is with the missing assaultrifle.
---
Other than that I'd mainly love to just see the chainsaw get some love, like higher level versions and legendarys, maybe some other whacky weapons like a large power drill or jack-hammer
---
Dew it!!!!
---
I was unaware this gun was primed my bad he never mentioned it
---
Food processor does make a blueprint but you cant place it anywhere. Says the item is floating no matter what you do.
---
The game wants to make a blueprint from the fusion core generator but the game gets stuck in an endless thinking process.  Tried many things but couldn't get it to work
---
What if we kept our selfs Rad clean?
---
If you are building new ones, they reset to 10mm. If you have more than one attached, you need to attach a terminal from power connectors and choose it from there, if you want to choose a new one again or you add another to the chain, you have to remove the terminal and then add it again.
---
Haven't really played much since posting this. First event I do after coming back and I get the pattern for it. Guess I just needed to complain and then have someone willing to make me some before the game finally conceded it to me, lol.
---
Limit fast traveling. 
---
Don‚Äôt rush. 
---
Take time to explore .
---
Upgrade and repair broken gear at workbenches using scrap. 
---
Scrap weapons and armor at workbenches to learn mod plans. 
---
Have fun.
---
This would actually be a pretty cool buff for pistol builds, they should probably add it as a perk though
---
Did u try on a private server? If not try it that's what worked for me, if u did try someone else's private server, my guess is u gotta find a server that someone hasn't done it on yet.. good luck to u
---
I tried not to use power armor for as long as I could... then I realized how fucking amazing it is and have never looked back
---
Inventory management is so intense in this game... and power armor has helped me enjoy the game a lot more. The jetpack has been a blast too.
---
That was a steam issue... not a Bethesda issue
---
this is the game's engine giving up on itself lmfao
---
pretty sure we wont collect enough. for same rewards no no no. i guess players with 1st already did the legendary run so there is nothing to be amazed about
---
Dunno but now I have Faith No More in my head.
---
Yikes. So you *have* to find a stimpak.
---
This game needs an unofficialfo76patch mod. Modders generally fix bethesda games, without them we get this. We are lucky we have the perk loadout mod.
---
" No definitive plans for extra character slots, but they're exploring ways where players wouldn't even need a separate character (Perk loadouts, etc.) "
---
How about an ACCOUNT WIDE STASH BOX?
---
Have fun with it and try not to pay attention to the people here relentlessly complaining about every tiny aspect of the game they don‚Äôt like ;)
---
Tell that to people who got their weekly or daily score challenges auto finished for them. A few on my friends list are in need of that bonus score reward.
---
I saw this first time on last double exp weekend on Guided Meditation. Other guy complained today about similar thing on Project Paradise. Look like hack to me - encountered similar behavior in multiplayer some shooters long time ago.
---
there is no use for concrete. 1k will be enough for any of ur needs. I have more ultracite or fiber ballistic
---
Majority of them. If it‚Äôs a number or % buff it usually will. Stuff like marsupial where it just grants you a new skill doesn‚Äôt get buffed
---
Tried both.  Even tried 720p and no change.  Gonna uninstall and reinstall on more time but beyond that I have no idea.
---
I have been removed for sharing a perk card that the leader didn‚Äôt want. At least I assume it was the reason.
---
Where is your camp? Also do you have fallout 1st?
---
If everyone spent all their time farming concrete, I still don't think there's enough concrete in the game to reach that goal. Steel is everywhere. There are only about 300 concrete total in world.
---
you wanna be charging more for that nuke material =0
---
I can agree, I also desperately hope that we do in fact get an actual dug out bunker interior option, as I want an underground bunker, not a fully constructed pre-war basement
---
I can confirm that Brain Bombs OR Brain Fungus soup stacks with Lunchboxes, Cranberry Relish and Berry Mentats.  You can't use two brain foods at the same time.  I also haven't found any other chems that affect XP and will stack with those mentioned above.  X-Cell doesn't.
---
Also use Inspirational, Well Rested/Lover's Embrace, Herbivore, Herd Mentality, Public Building teams, Unyielding Bonuses, Lunchboxes and +1I gear to boost XP.
---
#O
---
What a strange coincidence then haha
---
Yeah it's worth it, theres actually ALOT of content coming this year + the new year.
---
Marsupial does get buffed with it, you do jump slightly higher
---
I have no idea how valuable it is, it just clogged up my tiny stash and I wanted it gone but feel free to give me tips on what you deem to be a good price for the next time \^\^
---
Sugar, water, purple.
---
You can keep yo Sunny D.
---
Man I really didn't like how that one worked too much, it was just so huge, though it does make sense for a vault I would rather have something much much smaller
---
I've had that happen a few times now and was curious what that was about.
---
It's not really worth it imo. Main benefit of thorn is the extra stealth,but do you really need it with unyielding? No you don't you're already almost invisible.
---
Go for uny SS instead.
---
i‚Äôm surprised nobody else mentioned this, mess around on the nukes and dragons build planner (mainly just with the perks) so you know all of the options for a build
---
Kind of off topic but yeah I hate SWTOR. it‚Äôs amazing how much better KotOR 1 and 2 were
---
I love how wholesome this is. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
AT did a video testing it, I haven't watched it but if your interested here is a link
---
https://youtu.be/xXNvNX9h9JU
---
Thats typical guerilla tactic, dont finish him but let him scream for help. Ive someone shows up without looking out for enemies, he's fucked 2
---
This is fantastic! I hoard all apparel in case everything is rare. Now I can safely get rid of a few common pieces. Nice work.
---
I have tomorrow and Tuesday off, so I'll grind a bit and collect what I can. If the total on beth's website gets closer to 150m I'll donate my stockpile...otherwise I'll keep it for myself.
---
Yep and I don‚Äôt begrudge them that at all. Personally. Touch wood I‚Äôll make it. Just saying the majority who could use it would be the ones suspended.
---
I had bought a diffuser randomly from someone's vendor.
---
Stimpack, not the plan.
---
You might want to keep an eye out for that if you can.
---
Haven't seen too many successful PP events with more than 1 surviving friendly.
---
To be honest, I doubt that Bethesda would waste that asset since they took the time to make it. If I were to guess, they would probably put it in the atom shop at some point if the event fails.
---
1) try sniping them.  They are easy targets because they don‚Äôt bother hiding. 
---
2) they cannot jump constinuously. They only get 1 big jump, then a medium jump, and then a 3 second cool down.
---
3) if you think it‚Äôs so OP buy it with 10 overseer tickets.
---
Melee are always a good choice. Deathclaw gauntlets, sledgehammers. The heavy hitters.
---
I'm pretty sure in my session today,cranberry relish was only giving me 10%, despite being herbivore.
---
I have Uny SS, Thorn and BOS.  Honestly, in terms of stealth I don't see much difference.  Once your Agility gets into the 30's you are already at pretty much ninja status.  I don't even run sneak any more.
---
I've got plenty of diffusers. Do you just need some?
---
I can't remember what the challenge is
---
The easiest way is to take antacids.  No, I'm just kidding.  The easiest way is to build a platform above the ground, close to the extractor, then build one intersecting the extractor and build a floor partially above it.
---
1. Hard to snipe when you are face to face.
---
2. They can definitely jump continuously as I just had a guy in power Armor jump at least 7 times while fighting me and my teammate
---
The construction robots seem to have been reassigned to rebuilding the broken perimeter fences.
---
I once saw a 3 star glowing grahm.
---
I had one and tried to make it work. The problem was that it takes forever to charge the 40 shots and once charged if you switch to another weapon and then switch back you need to charge again.
---
It's been stashed on my alt character for some time now in case either I am missing something or Bethesda changes the way it works.
---
Hm odd I‚Äôll have to test that as I haven‚Äôt noticed any buff from it. 
---
Either way, og comment still stands that some mutations don‚Äôt get boosted.
---
Go in third person, you kinda land during your jump. The only one I know that doesn't get a buff is speed demons movement speed cause that's already the cap.
---
Conrete, like coal is one of those things you never think about until you're out and then you got to build a defensive wall or foundation and BAM. Then you open the wiki and remember there is a few bags on the bridge and then you forget about it for a few more months.
---
I would be surprised if we got concrete and cork. Nobody duped concrete and cork cause thats like duping dirty water.
---
I only use for distance up close with Explosive Weapons but it‚Äôs like five damage.
---
I really hope perk loadouts will come faster
---
I use frog legs personally to help traverse the map. He is right tho, you only get a couple of big hops before you have to stop jumping to gain jump stamina.
---
They can't. That was nerfed way back. The original beta release did let them jump waaaay more. Now you can get 2-3 good jumps before you have to let ap up. My guess is drugs and AP perk cards were at play. The meta building for NW is often over looked
---
I'm out of the loop, whats so powerful about Teslas?
---
Have you tried outer worlds
---
In your head, rent-free. ;-)
---
it's not as readily available as other junk so you should be charging probably no more than 10. if you charge more people will pay. I overpay for junk often but i wont OVERpay for junk ya feel me?
---
I wouldn't say consistent but I have gotten more so post patch
---
Has Mappalachia been updated since it was first posted over a year ago? Wastelanders has changed parts of the map, I would assume that will affect some ares for flux farming. Nothing major I'd assume, but who knows.
---
If you can find someone to make one for you, I would suggest a fixer modded to use 38 ammo (but I think that only becomes an option at level 20)
---
i would add only one thing. not to glitch kill(r\_pe) in one shot it, let everyone tag it !  
---
happens so many times. poor thing just never have chance after deactivating cloak
---
I played a match when i was going for the ghillie, was killed by "AreYouMoistBK" and my name is Black_Knight_7 and i go by BK to my friends and after i died i laughed for a straight minute. It was cosmically perfect
---
You still have to be very close when they kill the enemies, otherwise you won't be able to loot it.
---
I have a bloodied one that does about 300 damage while my bloodied mole miner gauntlet hits at around 1000. I have never been more disappointed in a weapon.
---
I use it with friendly fire with 2 perk points, is it much better at 3? Because healing the scavengers is near impossible without a weapon that can't keep the glowing ones away from me.
---
New players can server hop or go to the SW rooftop corner of Poseidon energy and get the free hazmat suit. 
---
I nuked before on a server with over 5 low levels in the blast zone in Morgan town. They tried to get in and keept dying but I swear it spawned more for me  I got 28 high radiation fluids in a single run.
---
Bethesda will finish the event for us. Not to worry....
---
Better get some lottery tickets while you‚Äôre on a hot streak, congrats.
---
I would like to know more. Please.
---
Good point.
---
Usually it means you're bait or they are otherwise engaged.  The only time I execute someone ASAP is if they are an actual threat if they stay in the game, their team is executing my team, or I realize I screwed and want to take their teammate with me lol
---
Especially the drill.
---
Someone did a massive write up on one handed weapons explaining theyre trash
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Nice reference link!
---
Too many gnomes for one teddy bear to take on lol
---
damn
---
I've donated 8k so far.  But at the number after day 1, I'm not so sure either.
---
I think I'm missing something here. 
---
&gt; give away valuable scrap to be given the privilege of emptying out your inventory (after the pop ups disappear) afterwards.
---
You lost me after valuable scrap. What pops up? Why emptying inventory?
---
Pre Patch no crashes, post patch 2-3 a day.
---
That is an exploit
---
That kind of character concept needs to change every dialogue option with [attack] at the end to ‚ÄúThis....is my boomstick!‚Äù
---
What that other person said. Try and get a fixer at 20. then there's lever actions at 25. also handmades are nice. Hunting rifles are good but like you said. Slow to reload. just carry two with you. open up an engagement with your hunting rifle and if they get too slow swap.
---
Are you on xbone?
---
Yeah but it should have been base game like a whole hell of a lot of things
---
Well done!!
---
Try donating a few thousand at once and you‚Äôll see the pop ups. Then try opening the reward crates (can‚Äôt remember what they are actually called) and you‚Äôll see what I mean
---
It's probably a clause in a contract some where with the goal of retaining players and future purchases on said platform. Sony/Xbox not wanting to lose their cut of atom profits if players switched to steam.
---
Or nailguns and rivetguns.
---
Oh, I didn't know this was a thing! I have now turned it on. Thank you!
---
Try building a springboard trap (you have two, build the bottom one) a few floors up in a workshop or in your camp. You can use it to fling yourself clear across the map if you time your boosts just right.
---
If you time the burst well even without any fall damage protection you will survive, unscratched if lucky enough.
---
I've tried it in the PTS so that if I didn't like it I could spend those 2000 bullions on something else, jumping down from the top of the monorail elevator naked, with only the  jetpacked chest piece, and after a couple of tries I was able to time the jetpack well enough to not get a single HP of damage.
---
Of course, any jetpack shenanigan without full fall resistance will be much easier for full health build since we have a much bigger pool of HP that we can sacrifice. On the other hand, although I haven't tried it, I guess Bloodieds can try to hijack the fall to purposefully get into a downed state, and then use perk or some life saving armor piece, to get a boost from Revenant.
---
I have 1st and though I collect some stuff at some point I don‚Äôt worry as much about it.  That said 6k of steel was easy to part with and will donate 2k concrete dropping me down to a couple hundred.  My house is fixed at the moment with the silly 2 sided wallpaper build I did so not going to change it for a while.
---
I got a 3* Bloodied Tesla followed by a 2* Instigating Fixer. First time I received a fixer from purveyor. Stuff has been a lot better than normal. Last week I got a 3*Vampire Tesla and I don't even use Teslas or Fixers, lol. Well, I want a Bloodied FF Fixer but a Bloodied FF handmade would do.
---
at least 20k. but i'd hold out for close to max caps or trade.
---
I don't they'll make anything that is better than SS stat wise.
---
But I bet we'll have new set bonuses in the future,like I don't know "a set that lets critical freeze enemies". Those may even come out as the best if the bonuses are good. I already went for thorn instead of SS.
---
Played it more than any other game I have bought in last few years, and still playing it...
---
I doubt they'll let it fail. It most likely is automatic. 
---
Otherwise they have to look at why people aren't participating and thats too much to ask of bethesda.
---
That's a great idea! it would make these perks a niche allowing melee and limited ranged weapons while also being really interesting for role-play/character backstory and such
---
Don‚Äôt suppose you play on PS4?   I‚Äôve never seen a vendor sell cool stuff to display, and I love it.   I keep accidentally scrapping the severed limbs with the ‚Äòscrap all‚Äô when I‚Äôm overencumbered.
---
Bloodied lever, great range, crit bar fills quickly, easy on vats, hits hard and you are not going to use a ton of ammo.
---
Pretty easy to get it to hit at 4000 damage.
---
Challenge is use 3 diffusers.  Project paradise is the event I believe that the recipe drops
---
Wha
---
Yeah I think I get what you mean I guess I just set the price that way because I just had a lot of it laying around while I don't use it for much other than my sweet vintage nukashine
---
No other fellow cliff jumpers here?
---
I have 3 of them on xbox
---
I have 3 diffusers you can use!
---
Oh shit really? Didn‚Äôt know I could sell them
---
Automatron* fyi
---
As long as you aren't a mutie or a commie your alright by me!
---
Real fine chune bout 70 squid
---
Is it worth getting a full set of uny with ap regen or just a couple pieces
---
Cool I am about to log on
---
Yeah had spot with sheepsquach spawns, deathclaw horse, and other high lvl crap. I recommend making a air base with one latter up so they distroy the latter and not the whole base
---
I run herbivore and pop relish and brain bombs all the time. The boosts come from being on teams too. Also, the XP gained is what to watch because of the strange in numbers/class freak visual glitch issues. All that said, things still seem to work fine. 25% boost in XP from relish and +7.5 INT with Brain bombs
---
Don't when we don't hit the goals I'm sure the prizes will be for sale in the Atomic Shop.
---
Especially since they‚Äôve already got the construction type of protectrons, they‚Äôve obviously got relevant code to accommodate such things.  They could even put a construction collectron in the atom store that gathers nails/rivets/rail spikes etc.     
---
Cash grab using recycled IP for them, content for us.   Everyone wins.
---
He still resets on Saturday for me.
---
Edit: according to another post it sounds like he reset with the patch, so you should buy now before he should reset tomorrow.
---
cool! just lmk. I'll send you a friend request
---
Yeah and I think all of them have to survive for it to drop
---
Maybe we could have something with events, where they effect what faction is in control of whitesprings, and end whoever has the most control will permanently own it after the event? Like crater vs foundation.
---
I wouldn't even care if they re-used the rail spikes for the nails tbh but this would really be a cool "weapons" class
---
Switchblade, dagger, Machete, and swords.
---
Do the collision course event at Morgantown airport.  Some nice low level weapons in the container at the end, as well as from the scorched you have to kill.
---
You alos occasionally get a low level legendary scorched. 
---
For rifles, the BoS Combat Rifle is a good choice, but you‚Äôll have to find it in a vendor or ask a higher level to make on for you.
---
Dont poopoo those 38 autos the super mutants carry.  Those can be quite hazardous to an opponents health.
---
Absolutely! It has issues like all games but an open world that has plenty to do. The only drawback is when your stashbox is full, you have a lot of legendary items you can't trade in yet, and you can't fast travel. I love to stay busy going all over that map scrapping for building materials and finding the toughest enemies but the lull can be a drag. During the first 100 -200 levels you shouldn't have problems like this with all the quests to do.
---
I started playing on Xbox and then went to Bethesda and then Steam. The only thing that didn‚Äôt come along was the Atoms - from Xbox to Pc.
---
Damn wish you were on pc. I have 20 of them selling for 250caps a piece
---
i'lll come build you one for free
---
Im on PS4 so I cant help directly, but if you join a private team with someone they can build a shower for you in your camp even if you dont have the plans for it. Dwcon showers have crazy high material costs though.
---
Skyrim is my All-Time fav!!!! Still play it a lot too.
---
Interesting. Some stuff is just badly documented or not obvious enough. To me at least. I never thought that it might be possible to share specific cards. I always thought these cards were just random stuff...
---
Tonight I will check that and share, too.
---
No. You cannot jump continuously. This was changed months ago. And power armor is pretty terrible in NW...
---
And why are you getting face to face with other players? Sounds like you need to adjust your play style.
---
No, they will keep ignoring it. All we got was a comment that they are looking into it an they never spoke about it or acknowledged it again.
---
Been camped on an acid node for about 180 levels - I hear The sound, and get the screen shake, but  I‚Äôm not sure it really does damage - or if it does, its negligible.
---
Teddy is the boss and they are his goons
---
How did you manage to do the food processor? I've tried for ages! Do you do both the machine and terminal?
---
Believe me when I say efficiency is my middle name. Which is exactly why having to try and fast travel to the same place 5 times in a row, or wasting 8 ultracite 2mm ultracite rounds on a target that should go down in 1-2, or waiting 20 long seconds for the weapon wheel to respond, not wasting stims on myself when my health wouldn‚Äôt be that low to begin with if all these things worked properly makes this an impossible uphill battle. I counted at least 5 isolated incidents of broken mechanics in the short 15 minutes that I played. They should hire me for quality control at this point. Will work for atoms and score points so long as they take our concerns seriously. And I guess I‚Äôll use this atoms and score points to buy things that I‚Äôll then need to stress test lol
---
I don't think god roll and cryolator can exist in the same sentence.
---
I‚Äôve literally never had one and just wanna melt shit lol
---
I'm pretty sure they have the cooldown after launch for the entire server, did you try jumping servers?
---
If you‚Äôre low keel you probably don‚Äôt have materials to craft/repair it. It requires a lot of stable flux which you would not have at a low level.
---
Oohh you mean on any server?
---
You can switch characters but each character has a cooldown to launch of a couple of hours. It's always been this way. At least for well over a year that I've been doing regular queen runs.
---
The exception to this is if you launch before and after the code reset. Maybe then you can launch 3 before and after. I have never tried, I just swap characters. Quest to be able to launch takes about an hour or so to do on any character.
---
yea, I too have clicked on my share of runescape coal veins. I think there were some missed opportunities for a totally novel online experience. Instead they chose to emulate other MMOs mechanics. I understand that blockbusters tend to follow this pattern, but it is rarely an improvement.
---
That's what I'm talking about, when I switch servers it still has a cool down now. Wasn't like this a week ago , before patch
---
Two shot is not a great prefix anymore. 
---
Also- this post is against sub rules
---
I found them at a camp store!
---
I gave up on farming these. With the current Fortify Atlas challenge up, I found most of the locations already looted on public servers. With 4.65 million of 200 million after 1 day with only 2 days more to go its rather unlikely that we will reach the goal anyway.
---
Silos have always hd a cool down
---
I take the same attitude I take to all games "they work until they dont"
---
Not a bug. There is both a cool down on the silo itself and a personal silo cool down each is 2 or 3 hours.
---
Examples...
---
You nuke from Charlie and then nobody can nuke from Charlie on that server till the silo cool down is done.
---
You nuke from Charlie on 1 server and server hop to another and you still can not nuke from Charlie again till your personal cool down is over even if nobody else has used that silo recently on the new server.
---
I'd LOVE one that explodes when damaged. Just picture it, a bunch of molerats gnawing on it then **BOOM** they're dead.
---
YOURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR 2-Headed BULLS
---
Aim up a tiny amount then. I don‚Äôt get why this is conplained about so much.
---
I usually log in, then setup at Abandoned Bog Town. And even with 120 concrete per hour, that's still insanely low for the 250 minimum turn in.
---
The best way to get high radiation fluids, hardened mass and glowing mass is to find a mineral vein in the nuke zone that has turned into ultracite - not the ultracite near the fissures, but persistent mineral veins that become ultracite when nuked. Upon mining this vein the first time, the player receives the ultracite as normal, but the vein remains. Each time the player touches the vein, a gang of scorched will spawn and come to the vein, and can be farmed for fluids and masses.
---
awesome! so glad you were able to get them!
---
I'm shocked. I have found 4 forest and traded 3 of them lol. I have a harder time finding blue. All I'm missing is red now lol
---
There‚Äôs a hidden RadResist and Damage Reduction per piece but other than that no.
---
Bethesda already struggles to deal with exploits on individual platforms. I doubt they could handle anything cross platform. 
---
This is aside from the fact that most console players wouldn't likely support any cross-anything with PC just due to all the exploits.
---
Last night I was bush camping in my ghillie suit while my last remaining team mate died from the storm (they had AFK'd at their camp for some reason). I was debating on where to go next when all of a sudden I get shot and downed so quick I couldn't do nothing about it. Turns out this guy had creeped up behind me without me hearing him at all...scared the shit out of me.
---
I think you're thinking of something else. Before we would launch 3 nukes on 1 server, hop servers, and do 3 more hop, repeat. We have been able to do this for a while, until last patch. I get cool downs in the server you're in, but when we hop, the cool down is still there. Since last patch, none of us have been able to do more than 3 launches per 2 hours, any server. Monday, my one friend launched 6 nukes, for example, on 2 different servers, same character.
---
they always been around
---
no no no
---
DUNK IT!
---
Sadly no. I really want to give the old settler forager a minigun so he can mow stuff down.
---
Really bro? I def want to pay you for it if you will let me. Yeah after looking at the Crafting cost, I don't have the mats, so someone building it for me is my only route I guess.
---
No. I'm not. Server cool down has always existed. As well as individual character cooldown. I don't know why, but it's not new. Swap characters (and servers) and it will work fine. Tested last night. Although I wasn't 'testing' since it's always been this way.
---
But thats for a full matching set?
---
How do you rejoin the same server?
---
I keep seeing different answers. But to me, I can only launch 3 nukes. Then I hop server and assuming nobody else has launched a nuke, I can use the 3 silos again. 
---
I can confirm because two nights ago we were farming the queen. So we would hit all 3 silos. Then server hop and immediately do it again. Since I have over 20 nuclear keycards I was the one who kept launching them.
---
The Responders had the Fire Breathers and were this close to developing the inoculation to the Scorched plague. The Free States were setting up a detection system and had lures to bring down the Scorchbeasts to kill them. The Brotherhood was holding the front lines and waged a war to the death against these things right down to their nest. And what did the Raiders do in all this?
---
They killed everyone who was trying to do anything.
---
It'd be one thing to say "they did what they had to, they survived". But they didn't. They're all dead.
---
CLOWNS.
---
no no
---
I‚Äôll buy yer mom fella
---
Na, PC.
---
Where do I get the Plans?
---
Honestly, I'm gonna go back on what I said. Its too expensive for a scout set, If you're planning on going to SS anyway. With mods and rarity of decent pieces. I probably spent close to 20k for everything with good not great effects on them. If I were you I'd just hop around camps and buy cheap like under 1k per a piece bolstering or unyielding items. Mix and match. It's fine with a outfit to cover it up lol
---
For the time being atleast until you get all the ss. Either way unfortunately you're gonna die being bloodied, I recently switched to a full health build, definitely dieing 20x less, but also doing 2x less damage soo yeahhhh.
---
Yeah same question
---
Thank you very much! I collect clothing and this is very helpful.
---
Damn I could do with one of those especially at 250 caps. Much cheaper than radaway at a low level
---

---
With this build you will take basically zero damage from anything minus radiation and poison I literally get punched in the face by the scorchbeast and it doesn't do a thing
---
The Super Duper Mart at Watoga has it, you may need to server jump a few times
---
Yep, I agree, they are great.
---
Monday, for example, my friend launched 6 nukes total, by server hopping. After patch, can't launch. Same with other friends. Idk, maybe certain people were bugged to be able to do that? Cause we have been doing it like this for awhile tbh. Unless we are killing the queen too fast now. Idk. I know silo cool downs but never encountered a personal cool down on any server.
---
I like it quite a bit myself.  I'm a little anxious about fully committing to a junkies or bloodied build, and I've always found plasma weapons pretty iconic of fallout so it's been the main on this toon since forever.  I'd be using the GP on my big guns dude if they didn't have such terrible hit reg issues ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I only have one piece and find it enough, but I see people often going for more
---
Edit* but I also don't use a jetpack or vats
---
I'm no where near high enough level to go there yet
---
People who (purposely) do crappy things shouldn't be excused because they were given the opportunity to do so. While I agree they should only allow the person with the recall card to start the event, I totally disagree with blaming Bethesda for how selfishly certain players act.
---
PvP is barely even a thing in this game dont worry about it
---
You don't even have to leave. Click on someone in your world and find someone who's joinable, and join their game from their profile. It will kick you out and have you rejoin immediately. I'm on xbox so I don't know if it works differently for ps4 and pc.
---
I'm still trying to figure out how they came to the completion number, knowing damn well those resources are either not abundant, or not commonly sought. I do like the overall reward for the weekly turn in, but the provisions make me feel like Dorsey might be an alcoholic.
---
Too bad they made this for the brotherhood of cringe and not an actual good faction. A shame really. I have no use for the 40k concrete in my scrapbox.
---
Today I haven't had time to play yet so no legendary rng update but I did take a healthy poop
---
Bethesda has a dark side for sure! Lol
---
I've never been able to re-place a camp with this error. :-(
---
Most guns and armor take more resources to repairs them the higher the level.
---
Does, for example, "events in the Forest" also include workshop events?
---
See, this is what I'm talking about and others are saying that it's always been like this. Monday itself we were able to launch 6 back to back on different servers, 1 person doing them. Now, we all have personal cool downs. And it has to have been a thing before cause it's mulitple friends from other friend groups as well that have tried to do a nuke on another server and then the cool down pops up and one of us has to go launch it for them
---
You get one from every sbq kill, so I'm sure most high levels are loaded with them, if not just dropping them
---
Must be deafening
---
Lol I get downvoted for asking for help...
---
I have the plans now but I can‚Äôt craft it cuz I don‚Äôt have the materials can someone help with it
---
I always get myself with the m79 grenade launcher. The low point of aim and third person view have cost me many stimpaks.
---
I was starting to get worried after not hearing from you. Thanks for this critical update.
---
Hey Moneybags, not everyone can afford, or even wants, Fallout First. Victim blaming never looks good, bruh.
---
Not suprising.  
---
I donated 60k steel;  basically wiping out my scrap box.  As of today - I'm back up to 40k steel.
---
Concrete?  I have 1600.
---
With the system there is today - no interest in donating any.
---
Still no news about pets. I‚Äôm afraid they scrapped them.
---
Depends on if you are going to play bloodied. If so, bffr by a fair bit. If not tse.
---
Wouldn't it be cool if they added mods for our stashes?im just saying...
---
It happens sometimes, I ran into once
---
Oh no.  Only instances I have heard of with this is if you have used the camp module skin from thr legendary run reward.  It is bugged at the moment.  No idea why the havent removed it.
---
Hey. It doesn't. I put a list of the events that count in the "appendix: events" tab so you can see exactly which ones to do
---
The method I'm about to tell you worked for me. I'm on xbox by the way. You must do it in this order though.
---
1. Exit to main menu and Reload. 
---
2. Quit the entire game and start it up again.
---
3. Interact with the terminal and read all of the dairy entries and other sections execpt for the blood sample.
---
4. Insert the t fuse in the fuse box.
---
5. Go back to the terminal and analyze blood sample.
---
Was working fine before and after patch for me. 25% with herbivore and strange in numbers.
---
Sure would have helped if concrete extractors harvested more than about 45 concrete every half hour. They've set up the game in a way that the very mechanics of the game, like timegates, try to make the player avoid long sessions, yet long session farming of concrete on a server is really the only way to get enough concrete to donate. I just don't think this event was very well thought through. Kind of like how forcing Ward to stay in his cabin forever now wasn't well thought out because NPCs half way across Foundation are still programmed and trying to have conversations with him.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me as well there were 4 of us just sitting by the rocks til time ran out. Then the event completed. Didn‚Äôt get much tokens though. But did get the rewards.
---
&gt; I think plastic will be easier. I can get 200 a server from the hs. It‚Äôs just not a commonly occurring item like steel is.
---
Maybe I'm in a minority using shotguns - but plastic is a coveted resource for me.  Prior to farming West-tek, it was a big problem.  Not as big of a deal now - but still not something I'm parting over large quantities of.
---
To play devil's advocate, did the nuke we drop actually accomplish anything either, if the BoS could've done it before us? If the goal was to collapse the caverns and obliterate the nest, then it fails: all we do is piss off big mamma jamma who climbs out unscathed and begins melting face.
---
Realistically, the SBQ wouldn't just fly back and forth idly and "let us" kill her as we do in Scorched Earth (hell, if she simply doesn't even land‚Äîwhich, why would she?‚Äîsome groups can't even kill her in time) and instead flies off to some other place on the Eastern seaboard to make a new nest in a place without the inoculation, then all we've actually done is drop a nuke on a place that was spared from them in the first place.
---
In that case, the BoS would've looked a lot like us, standing idly around V9 in PA, watching the queen fly off.
---
Thanks for this. Actually making another one with these spikes. Going to be selling it.
---
Another commentor above said he was farming queens and did 3 hopped and then did 3 more. And mulitple other friends, and in some of the discords I'm in, there's a bunch of us who queen farm and have been able to get around a personal cool down, I suppose. So maybe it only affected certain people but not all until recently? Because I can say for a fact I've launched 6 nukes in 2 servers way before the cool down was up. Guess I'll have to make my mules un fat and start doing that. Kinda stupid though.
---
Depends on what you are doing.
---
My build is melee/rifle.  (15 STR, 13PER).    I have glowsight3 equipped, as well as the +armor penetration perk (name escapes me right now).
---
For my example, I‚Äôll use a L40 glowing mole miner as the target.  Earlier today, on top of the building that covers the blackwater mine entrance, did not use vats:
---
Scoped suppressors explosive lever action, hardened receiver, 3\* - hip firing,  about 130 dmg.  Scoped sneak attack, about 250.
---
Swaped to a 3\* AA fixer.  Hip firing that, it did about 85.
---
However, scoped/sneak attack, the fixer outdamaged the explosive supressor - about 460 on the L40 mole miners.
---
to that end, with that smalll sample, if you are in sneak/not detected, then the fixer may be/is better - but if you have been detected/not sneaking, then the leve action may be/is better
---
a 15% block effect (on armor) makes all weapons bugged, sorry I have one so I just assume every heavy gun and shotgun user is taking advantage right now
---
The trick with the fire is related to when you do it. The first wave of fire is tame, the second ring closing is a step up (stronger DOT), etc. Also the longer you're in the fire it stages up, you'll hear an audible fire whirlwind sound which indicates you're now taking more damage per tick.
---
No worries. And welcome to the wastelands
---
Oh, that filter is awful sorry to say.
---
Workshops have concrete mining spots that you can have while owning the workshop. Go to private world and have couple going on at a time or all of them.  That way no one will try and take it from you
---
Idk, I've heard different things from others as well, and my friend group, and all we do is nuke launches and until recently this cool down started affecting us so maybe it only affected certain people and now it's everyone? Cause we have done nukes back to back, on other servers. That's all we do in the game now.
---
Secret service looks cool, has good rad resistance, and has a jet pack. That‚Äôs the only reason I grinded for it - my combat armor I had before had about the same effectiveness (except for rad resistance)
---
200mil Cork is never happening lol
---
Early game I really like Pipe Revolver Rifles as they benefit from Rifleman and Gunslinger perks, which really gives you a nice head start on the damage side and firerate is still okay. Also its easy to get all the weapon mods as you can unlock them with as all pipe gun types via scrapping. You also only need gunsmith 1-2 to fully mod them. If you get all the damage perks the Pipe Revolver Rifle is even endgame viable.
---
I am using that skin....
---
aye. I'm good for it. Send me your GT
---
I'll be on in a little bit. I'll take ya there.
---
I still remember playing fallout 4 and having followers with us and I made the mistake of giving him explosives to hold onto so I was not over weight. I was  in a bunker and went to shoot a rad roach at my feet and he used a mini nuke on it and blew us both up. My body smacked the ceiling.
---
Dunno. Never heard of that. It's always been this way. Like always. I've launched thousands (edit: maybe? Definitely hundreds 3-12 a day for months so maybe that's hyperbolic. Dunno, over 5k hours, I haven't kept track in a long time) of queens. And have been in the 'end game content' loop of killing queens for at least a year. It was well know amongst all of the folks who walked me through my first silo and has never changed.
---
But I have not tried to launch on the same char after the first three in a long long time because it has always been that way. Every once in a while I would hop off and maybe inadvertently run a silo and forget I was the last one to run that one and get the error msg for that character.
---
All I can say is it's not new. I don't know the reason for it though. I'd much rather hop on the same character. :-)
---
found lots of blue. they sold so fast. way more popular than green. i have like 6 of those left. 
---
I had to trade for my red
---
Try checking the nuke silo status holo you got from modus
---
Thanks! I didn't notice the tabs :)
---
Really u can get all the flux types you need between Whitespring and the SBQ area, and if your fighting the queen in the nuke zone all of the mobs have much better chances of dropping the stabilizing matts. Just nuke dead center to ensure everyone fights in the nuke zone. 
---
South of whitespring has plenty of cobalt flux and plenty of mobs dropping the other matts. 
---
Nuking those other regions largely just costs the server a boss fight, once the next boss is finally released I imagine it will replace Whitespring once and for all for farming.
---
If u pick a Beverly popular spot next to a resource or just a flat area people will build there as well
---
Power Armor is awesome in NW. Run up, pull the fusion core, drop a mine between its feet. Hide in a bush and light up the player that falls for it. Rinse and repeat if you have more mines
---
It can't be changed without breaking the camp down can it?
---
25% on relish here
---
oh, it‚Äôll be a junk grind but i believe in us! üëåüèªthere are a few known locations where you can find 6-9 bags at once. there‚Äôs also the concrete extractor in workshops too. good luck and happy hunting! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
*Groovy!*
---
Don't worry, it will look really bad for Bethesda if we don't reach a goal, so they'll fudge the numbers.
---
fixer plan is a drop from an event called encryptid. Lever action you cannot buy until 25 (apparently there's a plan out near the lighthouse) and handmade plans are available at 15 i believe. 
---
if you go to the trade forum you could always ask someone to make you a modded gun for a price. I would have done it free thats why i asked what platform you were on.
---
Hahahaha that's brilliant! Reminds me of dogmeat setting off frag clusters every damn time and just staring at the bright flash and blood spray that used to be my legs :') ohh I miss companions
---
Definitely a theme.
---
At the beginning i thought it was unintentional.
---
At this point it is starting to feel like "Planned obsoletion"
---
Game breaking updates.
---
Every up date sees more and more players give up on it.
---
i agree, but its still good to know where to get some concrete in short order.
---
I have a Two-Shot Explo LMG. Don't really need and its up for trading in a few communities rn
---
They gon need a whole lotta fudge
---
Concrete and cork are gonna be a struggle to get close,  glass I think will be hard but doable.  All the rest look easy to knock out
---
Let's hope so.
---
I find them pretty annoying on console because aiming with the controller is already a nightmare, not sure about PC
---
Fetchez la vache!
---
It got nerfed to hell
---
Got plenty of keycards, thanks. Good caps sink. 
---
The event actually starts when you insert the keycard. Again, everyone gets the same quest objective to activate it.  And again, it is ***courteous*** to wait for the person who started the event to activate it, but it shouldn't be expected.  It's honestly pretty silly to get bent out of shape when someone else follows the objective "too soon".
---
Bog Town Workshop has three concrete nodes and the middle floor of the tall building west of it has 7 bags of cement.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs really not hard at all to figure out, but people are stubborn and selfish.
---
Plus all the mats you keep having to use. It all adds up over time.
---
No, neither do I. As of earlier when i checked we were only on 4.65 million out of 150million in 2 out of 4 days
---
#realtalk
---
Hard to do. They only tools they left themselves with is flat damage reduction and nuke zone rated radiation protection. They can add set bonuses, but that's going to be a tough sell after the hassle of getting a set of SS rolled to spec. With the diminishing returns they've boxed themselves in, unless they rebalance and get rid of that.
---
Honestly?  I think it‚Äôs more fuel for the ‚Äúnobody working on this game plays this game‚Äù fire.  It should have been an order of magnitude less for concrete and cork and it still would have been a challenge.
---
I'm with this guy. I'm 1500+ in and have never heard of or notices this, but if I do now........ü§¨
---
Yeah I did the rookie mistake of listing 18k of it and it was bought in one transaction. Thankfully I ended up sitting at like 29k caps, but I only sell whatever I'm down by basically, like a few thousand at a time.
---
People say it doesn't sell but I've totally done well from it. If I play public it generally goes within a day or two.
---
I used to use shotgun, but idk if a lot of ppl use them now unless they‚Äôre the broken legendaries.
---
I don‚Äôt spend much time going after plastics, but it‚Äôs usually up there with leather and cloth for me.
---
I guess a better way of saying it is: it‚Äôll be easier, but people may be less-inclined to donate it since it‚Äôs easier to sell
---
Dupped items aren't nearly as common on Xbox as people keep making them out to be.  
---
I regularly sell out of the plans people continuously claim have no value now, and cant remember the last time I saw a good weapon roll for sell at any cost.
---
When i find a grenade launcher I just bunny hop and shoot downwards, one or two shot kills others very easily, it makes the game super dumb but apparently the dev thinks this adds to the realism they put so much work into.
---
Good post and info but I'm going to disagree with Morgantown being the best nuke site for ingredients, the ghouls are too spread out which forces you to waste a lot of time running from one area to the next, also the station is too far away to be useful for scripping legendaries. Whitespring is more compact, has a very straightforward route with a huge amount of ghouls and the station is super close. 
---
The number of ghouls/scorched available on either site and the cool down period is kind of irrelevant if you relog, i can't remember how many Morgantown offers but just the inside area of Whitespring gives you around 80. I've run it dozens of times and the compactness of the area makes it very efficient, by the time you complete one lap, dump your scrip and relog it's time to run it again. 6 laps per nuke is easy and the amount of mass available is ridiculous, we only count high rad fluids as they're rarer and 100 per nuke is standard, up to 150 some nights.
---
We've tried both areas repeatedly and Whitesprings wins no contest.
---
Nah it's RNG mate- I've gotten two paints in like 30 data, plus the odd junk legendary armor etc. It's finnicky on how often it wants to pay out.
---
I wish. I've spent so much extra on this game I just don't want to start fresh on PC after starting on Xbox.
---
VATs is broken, Bethesda has admitted as much.
---
*** I can be right up their face with 95% chance to hit yet I'm spending 4 to 5 ammo just to hit it.
---
Nope, unfortunately
---
I thought I saw ultralight arms and legs
---
I use all three except for the one that‚Äôs supposed to hang. I don‚Äôt use the tall one. Hanging one is still broken as far as I‚Äôm aware
---
Well there goes the rest of my day
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a shame.
---
Poseidon workshop has concrete too.
---
Not that it'll be doing it as I don't give a fuck about the event. But still, I use it for when I'm gonna go to town on my reserves.
---
This isn't true. You get one and only one the first time you kill her, it will never drop for you again.
---
Last few days I played on Xbox were like ghost towns, couldn't even get a full build group, and barely any regular events spawning.
---
They really need a better means for people to spawn the various events, well actually they need a lot of improvement on a lot of issues.
---
Give us the Highwayman!
---
Bethesda will do it for us.
---
Really guys? This has been a thing for friggin ages.... Then again I go on Reddit instead of doing my job so maybe yall have lives....
---
Anyways yes the future tec CAMP module be tainted.
---
I think that sometimes the blocked out areas persist after a player leaves the server.  I have that issue too, since I'm on a popular garbage node.
---
Laughs in not having to grind because of power armor jetpacks
---
I guess so.
---
Am Herbivore. Prior to the patch, I recall Cranberry Cobbler (+5% XP normally) was only giving me +10% XP, which was weird because it meant Strange in Numbers or something else wasn't working properly with Herbivore on it, but now it's giving (or showing) 13%.
---
I will try this on ps4 and update o.o fantastic idea as I've noticed this too i believe
---
You need 36 bags to make one donation. As stated already there are a handful of places that have 6-9 bags. Abandoned Bogtown, R&amp;G etc. a solid hop of these locations almost nets you one donation. We just need another 580k more donations to finish it in 3 days.
---
that would be awesome
---
I run with a full stack that spams SBQs. One of us will burn a server then move on to the next, with the next player in the group doing silos. Lather rinse repeat. The dual cooldowns have always been there (silo and individual player) as far as I know. The thing that sucks about the player cooldown is that unlike the silo, there's no way to track it.
---
It‚Äôs been like this for a long time. Each silo had a personal cool down as well as the lobby cools down.
---
Do you really get more high rad fluids etc. in Morgantown than white springs? I am not disagreeing with you I am just curious if you‚Äôve compared them. Because I, probably like you , have a gauss minigun that spits lead and eats crimson flux.
---
Do all types of mineral veins turn into ultracite veins? And after you harvest it, do you have to wait for a while before you can harvest it again?
---
Yep farm the queen all the time it‚Äôs always been this way ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
---
Yep, there are some ledges that I can reach that my teammate can't whenever I forget to share Strange in Numbers to boost their Marsupial too.
---
Sometimes the jump height is obnoxious though haha. Dudes I just wanna get over this little step to enter the train station, not land on the roof.
---
My favorite is when they gooify and go somewhere you cant access, but you'd still see it
---
Or a drug lol
---
&gt;I remember once with Dogmeat I was in a building with those robots you had to kill and I was doing stealth trying to take them out 1 at a time because if there were more than 1 attacking me I would get killed.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;For somereason Dogmeat did not come into the building with me and a few minutes later after I had taken 3 robots out here comes dogmeat but he came from upstairs and broght every robot with him.  
---
&gt; He litterlly walked through the entire house gathering the robots with him as he went and walked right to where I was hiding in the kitchen.
---
Another option for ps4 is to join a team, close the app by holding the ps button, then start the game up again. You'll be given the option to join the same team.
---
No it‚Äôs per piece. Can mix and match. Except for excavator and strangler.
---
If your referring to play vendors I'd agree for the most part... go browse some trading groups...
---
Why cork it seems like one of the most random useless things. Stick to something easier like lead, aluminum, acid, oil, stuff that seems logical that the brotherhood would want to have around.
---
You can make fusion cores with 1 of each stable flux type. But it's cheaper to sell the stable fluxes and just buy fusion cores from other players.
---
Its fine. My friend did that I'll just tell him NOT to do that.
---
I just figured they remove levelled weapons and armour in favour of a baseline
---
the main difference being inthe perks and SPECIAL points, but I'd guess you'd run into the area's highest level enemy
---
Elder Scrolls online basically has you doing less damage as you level up and makes up for it with better gear, and later on champion points, that way a lvl 1 and a lvl 50 player are somewhat equal in PvP until you go into the CP
---
I bet it's like a percentage type of deal? you have better gear, but fight a higher level enemy, dealing the same percentage of damage against it
---
I forget does scrapper work on Bulked items?
---
I'm pretty sure t60 is the cheapest to repair.
---
My Morgantown critters look after me as it is.... Plus if you're nuking M-Town it's generally in private so as to not startle the new kids... You get like a few mins to come back too on private before it disappears...... 
---
And I don't trust that my shit will still be there as when does anything work flawlessly or reliably? 
---
Ooorrrrrr just fight the Queen which is how I've been getting Flux for ages now. 
---
Collect forty flowers, four high rads and all the other shit etc or simply smack a bitch for the same amount- which ends also much faster and everyone can have a jolly time. Pop a few lunch boxes, look at the tents and wierd costumes people run with-- defs more fun!!
---
BoS demands Hornwright Bunker Keycards!
---
You still get the score and rewards, it just doesn‚Äôt show the bar going up on the bottom of your screen
---
In the past we get these challenges at the end of the event.
---
Not sure. 
---
No. You can spawn another wave as soon as you are done with the preceding. Last nuke I farmed 25 hardened mass
---
I think this is how everyone feels. Lots donating a ton of steel, saw how disappointing the provisions were and aren‚Äôt going to bother with the harder to farm resources.
---
this helps more then you know thank you.  normally i have to drop a nuke in a private go kill for a bit wait then come back.  if this works then it will be a lot easier to get that stuff.
---
The tall one makes a nice interior wall.
---
I never used the ceiling out-of-frame glitch, do not really for me.
---
The perk adrenaline is unnecessary when you run a bloodied build.  I used to use it. But after it stopped working I realized
---
Ty I will use that as my main then.
---
Hey that's bro, your the type of player that keeps noobs from walking away from the game. A++ good sir!
---
And you're on pc? If so it seems very random.
---
When you say relog, do you do it in a private server?
---
For sure. And for everyone else, there is the bomber jacket. Same idea, but not exclusive.
---
Here's some I found on a Junk Scavenging guide earlier. Spread it around and hopefully we can start making a dent. Not work I compiled myself:  
---
2nd floor of multi-story building near workshop controls at Abandoned Bog Town workshopüì∑ (13 bag of cement (7)) (sneaking hides you from the world map)  
---
Top of elevator at Monorail Elevator (10 bag of cement (7))  Around chemistry station (near Vendor Bot Wallace) at Harpers Ferry (8 bag of cement (7), 2 garden gnome (3))  
---
Behind house at Clancy Manor (8 bag of cement (7))  
---
South of elevator to Site Charlie, just around back of building (8 bag of cement (7))

Balcony, and garden, at The General's Steakhouse (3 bag of cement (7), 8 garden gnome (3))  
---
 At Monongah Power Substation MZ-03 (6 bag of cement (7))

But you may aswell just spend daily scrip as you get it unless you are saving up for the sale.
---
Just need a partner s all.
---
Just ignore it, the whole thing is a boring waste of time and resources, with a useless rewards that people will soon forget about.
---
They've spent the time to create these rewards, so even if the community fails, they will end up in the atom store if you really wanted them.
---
Nooooo, yeah that's the bug with the skin.  Crazy they didn't temp remove it until a fix.
---
I don't know all of them, but the fireman outfits (firebreather, responder, and Halloween ones) hide your backpack.
---
As does the science scribe outfit, and the traveling leather coat.
---
Okay thanks.
---
What perks and cards do you have set up right now?  I can't give adequate advice without seeing more of your build.
---
Oh, yeah, that makes sense. It is a action point hog for sure.
---
Yes also I've also had it re give me rewards a few times also. From weekly and daily tasks
---
PA was stealth buffed i think in patch 20. It definitely seems like they added the power armor % mitigation back.
---
Well that‚Äôs stupid
---
Idk either, üò™ we are all confused by this and now it's becoming a bigger confusion because of what we were doing the week prior on same characters. Maybe it's come and gone, like broken a few times and then gets fixed? Idk, I know we haven't run maybe thousands, but definitely hundreds of nukes, and this problem occured also Durning Fasnacht , along with terminals not even working in the silos, and then after fasnacht it went away and we went to doing tons of nukes again. I'm more confused than ever now, saddly.
---
Kill mole miners to get the black titanium you need.   You can also get it by building and extractor at Gorge Junkyard.  
---
For the other crafting materials just loot and scrap everything you can find until you have enough of the materials.  There are guides on this sub reddit.   
---
It took me awhile when I was at your level to get it made.   The screws  took awhile to get.
---
its not the handmade, its vats.   
---
i swapped from handmade to combat rifle to fixer and now back to handmade and with every weapon, it might from time to time take way more shots than it should with 95% accuracy. i got used to it and since ammu is quite cheap and easy to craft, i can live very well with it.  
---
what do you mean with maxing out rifle perks? classic commando is 3 times level 3 commando (regular, expert, master), tank killer 3 and concentrated fire 3 - at least, thats what i know as "classic" and i run it for about 120 levels now and it works out great.
---
If you are on xbox i may have some excess steel to use towards your spikes.
---
Afraid jot üòî feel for you there.
---
The difficulty of the real method has not changed
---
Are you going melee, commando, etc?
---
Longshoreman outfit
---
You can talk to her, won‚Äôt spoil anything, but she‚Äôll tell you to do the Scorched main quest
---
I also believe the event will self complete in the nick of time. I have a hard time believing the majority of the community is really grinding this event for the same ‚Äúholiday gifts‚Äù rewards. Just not enough to peak my interest
---
Union one works as well
---
There's one way to track it, saddly, and painfully. You get thru a nuke and then it tells you you're cool down when you get to the end. Which, I wish they would tell you when you first enter. We've had cool downs happen before Durning events, but we were doing back to back nukes so maybe it was just broken for a short while? Idk. I'm more confused now than ever
---
Nope. only those two give a set bonus. sadly the T65 does not come with one despite the high gold cost for the armor and mods
---
Post your build from nukes and dragons. Rifleman is great, though. I use it and hardly have to make ammo, by comparison. VATS is still bugged, so there‚Äôs still wasted ammo but probably not as much.
---
I hope they do for the score rewards at least.
---
I have a bloodied melee all mutations which is fun
---
Honestly, your comment has nothing to do with this post or what is shown in the video.
---
I'm not looking for a gift. There is no reason to have to pay for fallout 1st except for atoms everything else should have been offered since launch...
---
Don't believe me, go to Google and look at the old comments on why people dont like the game. Look at new ones talking about why if you buy a game should you have to pay to have a private server. There is no reason why they should be asking for more money when they havent done anything to take more money from me. Oh cool they added wastelanders, oh they are buggy and broken, well thats a dlc I wouldve never paid for. Oh you added atlas wait you broke more game stuff, great another dlc I wouldn't of wanted to pay for. You act like this game has great reviews when it doesnt. The best its ever gotten is from steam, which i dont understand.
---
I'm not asking for a handout, ive been telling people a map add on might help bring player but at the same time with all the bugs id be afraid of what a dlc(a real dlc) would do to this game. There are so many bugs to list it wouldn't even be funny but if you want to find some, there are plenty listed in Google comments.
---
Yeah I'm only on tier 71
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing for a couple hours now. Managed the get about 4 donations from it
---
I don't remember exactly when but they said a date we would get the stuff.
---
Im sure if you looked you'd find the info
---
Bloodied/junkies handmade or fixer.

At the next SBQ fight you're in charge of pyrotechnics.
---
Also, there's some soccer riots that need your assistance.
---
Raiders but you dont see a ton of fire station builds
---
You'll be fine.  I'm mid 50's because I didn't start it when it started.  The fewer atoms I have to spend the better.
---
Only if you learn it
---
Source: Me. I have like 15 mounted queen heads and 20+ decon showers because I didn't learn the plan.
---
It would be cool if they could implement such a feature and figure out a way to keep people from griefing with it. Because if they just let people place it where they want... goodbye to whatever junk you were carrying lol
---
Yup, many bugs going on here. The vanishing legendary corpse, the glitched damage doing no damage, or the HP rubber-banding. VATS 95%. The lag on weapon inspect screen.
---
They need that much cork for all of the wine they're giving us.
---
You did kinda help him so...
---
Then they pass a fist through your face... damn raiders
---
I'm guessing it will be in the Atomic Shop on Tuesday
---
Yeah most players will have these plans, and the endgame for people with 1st, is to collect and hoard junk, so I can't see people wasting all their concrete for a BOS banner.
---
Still, for new players that missed out on the holiday event, it's a good way to catch up I guess.
---
Yeah I didnt start straight away. I'm mostly in it for script, bullion and caps
---
There are some skins I was hoping for.
---
They nerfed the spawn rate in WS almost a year ago. In Morgantown, you can make a loop and they will be respawned before you get back to the beginning.
---
Edit: a word
---
Yeah of course, same here.
---
yes, but actually no. 
---
in most cases, it just lowers weight by getting rid of two plastic. you can then sell the bulks to NPC vendors to clear some space and get some caps.
---
It's absolutely worth $20. Go into the game with a "play until you're bored" mindset and you'll enjoy it, not the same mindset as with other online games where you intend to spend hundreds, if not thousands of hours.
---
Do not, under any circumstance, pay for the monthly subscription option. Bethesda needs to learn this isn't a good thing to have for games like this. You're throwing money away for greedy monetization.
---
The locked rooms packed to the brim with bloated glowing ones from the amount of times we‚Äôve nuked it
---
I'm running an all-mutations Pipe Gunslinger build and it's little different in principle to your normal builds. The low strength can be a killer early one, but most others downsides are manageable.
---
The boost when you finally get the Starched Genes perk feels so welcome after a long, long time at strength 1.
---
omg yes that rlly sucks
---
It was nice at a low level when I needed to reload it also still works as bashing does in skyrim so timing is key as to when to bash to get the stagger
---
as there is an achievment/trophy for killing a wanted player and there are atom rewards for doing so with the fact he did something to get wanted, i wouldnt feel bad about that.   
---
happend to me too as a noob. at around level 20 i picked something up at a workshop and got wanted. fact learned: aha, red writing means stealing, i get wanted. then i hid somewhere, got bored and just kept on playing until a lvl 90ish guy came up, one shooted me and i saw my first death. thats were i learned, i only lose my junk and keep everything else. so, in the end, i learned a lot from getting shot.  
---
conclusion: he should thank you :D
---
Best workshop for it imo is abandoned bog town. A whole lot of concrete bags around the workshop area and building, 3 concrete extractors for the workshop and about 5 globes in the building.
---
yes. that seems more doable. if you select people still in your server, there's no 'join' selection except for potentially 'join party' inam aware of that little trick with joining teams, but the use in which you recommended, i didn't think of that at all
---
For the first circle....no.
---
That's why I threw in the part about a radius around your CAMP placement.   
---
People already grief with their camp placements and I feel more people would use it for good than bad if given the option.
---
Presents. Presents everywhere.
---
Still doesn't work until they're meat piles.
---
Don't get me wrong, I've been able to jump servers and drop nukes right away even after having dropped a bunch in the previous server on a few occasions. I imagine *that* is the bug and the two-hour player cooldown is intended behavior.
---
I really enjoy melee, unarmed (power fist/deathclaw guantlet) but I'm open to most ideas
---
Bingo
---
I cleared over 200 in one nuke on Morgantown. Did you get the airport? And the train yard? Nearly 50 scorched spawns just there with a respawn timer of &lt;10 mins. Then there's &gt;30 ghouls.
---
Should have took his junk. No honor in the wasteland. Dog eat dog world
---
I figured that would be really good especially with adrenal reaction but I enjoy melee and I dunno if bloody melee is the best idea. I'm def open to the idea of bloody tho. Just getting ideas and feedback from y'all for now.
---
Yea the low str hurts and I'm working on getting the perk that reduces negative mutation effects
---
Communist Spy Outfit
---
This also happens in Skyrim with dragons, This really do be a Bethesda moment
---
kind of rude to low health builds...
---
Union just changes the looks of your backpack.
---
Thanks where‚Äôs gorge junkyard
---
Very cool! üòÄ
---
Only for Aluminum and Lead (50%). For everything else, all you save is just the weight of the two Plastic used in the bulking process.
---
It would be even nicer when we fall they can pick up our Legendaries and keep fighting, oh wait...
---
You're a legend, thanks mate!
---
Atomshop item. Its a communist themed outfit. Can't remember name.
---
ESO has better reviews than 76 as well if that helps too. Most of the bad reviews are pretty old too so they probably fixed most of the problems anyway
---
acctualy there are plenty of teddy "Scenes" in game, gotta find em all!
---
It was part of the a Communist bundle
---
Yep, Im starting my T-65 grind and realized it will cost me 9k gold for that. Thats 40-45 days. Lol.
---
You‚Äôre welcome.
---
True dat.
---
Kinda a nice way to have them feel emerged in the game.
---
But imho, still lazy gameplay on Bethesda part to pass it off as ‚Äúnew‚Äù content event.
---
No worries mate üëçüèª
---
The only time I personally successfully complete this event is when I bring the cyro.
---
It happens to me when I am wearing my PA
---
The real glitches still work.
---
How do you know people aren‚Äôt going away or canceling their first? Do you have a secret FO1st active user count page that Bethesda isn‚Äôt sharing with the rest of us? Are you the company accountant?Are you just making shit up to shout into the digital wind?
---
I think I know which one it is.
---
That‚Äôs a good question.
---
REMOVED: RULE TEN lol who's trading here? üòÇ

Just move it, all items will be packed up with you

If you truly want to delete everything it‚Äôs one by one.

I think I blasted the legendary corpse into neverland with the gauss shotty but apart from that ya lol. I‚Äôm glad someone noticed man. Was starting to think it was just me. My friend follows me on YouTube which is just these fo76 vids now, we hadn‚Äôt even talked yet today and he texted me 5 minutes after I threw the towel and posted that vid with ‚Äúdude, I counted 8 wiffs in vats on that one ghoul in the golf club‚Äù
---
Edit: ah it was the explosive handmade that got rid of the legendary corpse. And yea, come to think of it, the corpses turning to helium filled balloons should have been addressed by now. I guess I‚Äôm just used to it
---
thank you for the offer but I'm on pc
---
Cool. I'm on the right track then. I always run bloodied and an slowly gathering the cards for a better PA build with every level up. I have Stabalized maxxed and am about halfway though all three of the Heavy Gunner cards.
---
Type Ounce into the search bar there were 26 threads this morning about it!
---
I‚Äôm no veteran or high lvl, but I have the same feeling. Tried switching between commando and rifleman for a while, but now its just rifleman (lvl 103). It‚Äôs fun with automatic rifles, but for every 5 mins of battle I must farm ammo for like 1 hour. Rifleman feels more ¬´allround¬ª to me.
---
That and it is a cheep insulation and sound proofing for a building.
---
just move it to another location (can be 1meter away) It will be blueprinted completly o partly. Than u can brake blueprints and use some created items in ur new camp o scrap them all one by one.
---
Yup I started killing time and collected them and sold a few I have left. I love how a story is told based on how skeletons are skeletons and mannequins are placed, the bears are just as good in this game
---
Place your camp module at the new location. All of your build objects will become stored. Some may be blueprinted, and unless you want to use the blueprint you‚Äôll have to ‚Äòbreak apart‚Äô the blueprint. 
---
Then, start building again. If you place down an item that was stored (or was an equivalent item), then you don‚Äôt get any XP but you do save materials. If the item is stored, you‚Äôll see a number in brackets to the right of the item name. 
---
Once you‚Äôve finished, or if you need more camp space, check the Stored tab for pieces you don‚Äôt need. You can delete/scrap them directly from that tab. 
---
Equip Contractor if you have it, to save on materials when building.
---
Transfer them to new characters
---
And another with someone asking for the personal counter to be added to the silo tape:

I LOVE YOU. I WISH I HAD GOLD TO GIVE YOU. PLEASE TAKE MY UNDYING GRATITUDE AS A CONSOLATION.

the ncr doesn't kill the remaining BoS, keep dreaming
---
I had this happen too, but just out on the bog during Scorched Earth. It was right by some FO1st player's shelter thing so I thought the Chain artefacts had something to do with that, but maybe not.
---
Edit: specifically the Chain part; no crash and I have no idea if anyone in the Scorchbeast Queen fight was using Tesla rifles but I guess it's probably likely

Welcome to the club - 10 Nuke Zones respawns gains you a medalian, if its automatically respawning without allowing any user input you get to be a member of the Platinum club...very exclusive and if you qualify I shall see you at the AGM after patch 22
---
: ) my husband has been holding off launching one for 1.5 years so I can catch up in the questline.  I'm trying to suffer through the wastelanders quest line so I can finish that up.
---
100+ million from the most common materials are totally doable, this is a bit overkill. We could get 150m nuclear waste faster than this.
---
Don't apologise. You don't know until you find out
---
actually they should fix it. by joining the sbq event u will be placed in a nuked zone and with low RR u r doomed. It is so funny when u spawn again (in the same spot) it is not possible to run out of zone so u r doomed again. Of course u can got there without joining event directly but it would be nice to get this issue resolved.
---
there really ought to be a delete all function or some kind of remote retrieval system if something falls through the terrain.
---
nothing like having to rebuild a whole camp just cause a few bits of collision weren't working.
---
I'm pretty curious about the ghoul slayers aspect, trying to roll a better Secret Service leg and i have a few good rolls with ghoul slayer that might be worth keeping
---
Well, I guess bloodied does have a downside.
---
I need to launch my own nuke,
---
I need Cobalt flux but everyone just nukes Site Prime
---
When I tried to farm these yesterday most of them were already looted. Server hops did help sometimes, but as servers have a very long global respawn timeout for loose items, getting these can be very hard.
---
Finished the tadpole quests on 3 alts in row and I did archer, athlete and hunter. I think its less boring.
---
How does that work?
---
The silos aren't hard they're just tedious and boring af though I'd imagine would be good ammo runs for melee builds or one shot builds
---
Sickleman is out there somewhere... one day I'll find him and make him pay
---
I only finally launched one a couple weeks ago. Been playing since beta lol. I iust asked for help here and boom got a dude that pretty much finished it for me. Great community if you need a hand.
---
On Xbox and the same thing happened to me. Just handful of live guys and bots prior to the boss area. I had to Google to see if it was a bug or if anyone else had experienced this issue. Apparently I'm not the only one. Pretty underwhelming.
---
Honestly well worth great....shotüòâüòÇ
---
Bethesda patch notes are nothing but a list of things they are working on. Some are complete and some are still being worked on. 
---
Remember, FO76 is a magical unicorn made out of snowflakes and wishes. You seriously can not expect 76 to be held to the same standard as every other multi-player game, can you? Do you think Bethesda is some AAA studio or something?
---
when the same people constantly post daily about how 76 is trash, and always know the newest updates arent good, thats a pretty good hint that they havent actually quit the game.
---
when you bash the bashing
---
How do I claim? Because I have spawned there at least oh I don‚Äôt know....45, 55 thousand???!!??
---
Just sounds like another version of the Welcome Mat...a traptastic idea.
---
By moving your Camp builder you can already change the general area of fast travel arrival as its generally a few floor squares North of the kit.
---
Its still hidden in a sense. Its just looks like a part of the outfit instead.
---
Did you sign up for it and give out payment information?
---
Do you mean you want to know if you‚Äôre going to be billed again?
---
Vs enclave. Screw those other two. I wana be enclave. And I'm pissed that all these other factions are overshadowing enclave. The enclave to me is like my faction.
---
Honestly, I don't care for your opinion.
---
There are actually non-decayed cars in the game, but I don't think they will just give us the plans or just add it to the atom shop though, at least they do looks super cool and pretty
---
I had a bash at bashing bash damage. I just couldn't keep being bashful
---
Fusion cores are for PA right? I haven't used it since the early weeks of the game.
---
Thank you üôèüôè
---
They're probably on someones hard drive at Bethesda.
---
Okay okay okay, that makes sense then. Cause we have been able to do this often between updates, and then one update, can't do it at all and it has a cool down. But up til last week, we were hopping and doing it. So I guess that makes more sense now
---
It's all done to take up more of your time and yet give you 'rewards' you think you've earned that significantly effect your character.  
---
Last I checked, enemies don't die b/c of what your char is wearing.
---
I watched one one of captainoobs weapon showcases, he couldn't even 1 shot a radroach either
---
I have a pokey fist for this. It's good to let the brain melt for a bit
---
Thank you man for showing me these, yeah as someone else below said, they have been able to drop nukes hop and do it on a few occasions, but that itself could be the bug and the personal cool down is the intended way. Cause there have been past updates where we can't server hop and do it and then there's updates where we can do it. So I guess it's just a bug that is "fixed" right now
---
accounts.microsoft.com
---
That says it all, really
---
Yeah I bought 1 month of it around wastelanders and I‚Äôve keep getting atoms and stuff but it doesn‚Äôt appear in subscriptions
---
I agree, hopefully they're also working on that cx
---
This. If it has a Jetpack, Rollar Blades, Jet Boots or any other type of improved mobility or QoL ability, I will grind for it, and I doubt I am alone in the sentiment.
---
I just spin around and run like hell haha
---
That is not going to happen, even if now all players go for concrete farming. When you looted the bags of cement nobody else on the server can loot them again for like 2 hours as there is a global respawn timer for loose items per server. So when more people do this on public servers, its very likely that you find most of the locations already looted. I experiences this already yesterday when I tried to farm bags of cement.
---
the dildo bat from saints row 3
---
Silos aren't hard, they're just boring. Removing the glitched ceiling tiles doesn't affect normal runs at all.
---
I pop in to my Chinese Stealth and can waltz through virtually untouched. A good melee weapon takes down any annoying bots and a silence gun for turrets.
---
I actually liked bashing in skyrim despite having my attack blocked immediately after, but bashing in fallout out is just balls
---
I do this quite a bit. I handed over quite a bit of supplies and notes to a few people last night. It gives me a break from the grind, and helps out new characters
---
Bloodied dildo bat with faster swing speed
---
So that's how item spawning works, TIL
---
They decided not to give it to us, since too many people kept asking.
---
There are no drops, only available from Whitespring Bunker.
---
I have seen longshoreman several times but never saw anyone wearing the western outfit
---
You can't get them from the queen anymore but they come up as misc in the vendor menu so look for players that have alot of misc items they usually sell serums for 500 each but some people put some at 1000
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Oh ok I was told by multiple people the Queen drops them with a small chance
---
Yeah just did it on a private server with an alt, didn't work on a public one
---
Well with Bethesda 'fixed' and 'bug' are sometimes interchangeable. =P
---
I have never personally looked up 'why' or even any official documentation on the cooldown. I couldn't find anything other than some of these refit posts I linked to when I looked. It seems like a somewhat arbitrary cooldown on the characters. Although I guess it would stop me from just jumping servers and chain nuking somewhere to grief or something like that.
---
At a minimum I do wish that post to get the personal cooldown in the silo tape had gotten more traction. It has been annoying when I have run through only to find out I have 45 min left on my personal cooldown and someone else has to pop down to launch.
---
VATs broke when Wastelanders dropped.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm looking for the recipes so I can sell them to make some caps
---
Go see Davenport and he'll tell you that you need a camera. That should give you a miscellaneous quest to find a camera with a map marker to its location. Or just check your personal terminal in your camp
---
This works on xbox as well. It's how I get rewards from Encrypted if I'm unlucky enough to get the cant respawn glitch at the end
---
Check your subscriptions at the [Microsoft website](https://account.microsoft.com).
---
If they don't it will be a first time in a mmo.
---
now u can use pa to get through a closed door so instead of nuking in 10 min u will do it in 12 but it is not so hard to run silo how it was supposed.
---
We regularly remove people if someone we know wants to join. I'd say this is relatively rare though as its normally only something to do if someone is solo and can't get more folks in another public group.
---
This as well as someone sharing a bad perk are the only reasons I'd imagine being the norm. Maybe if there is a big level gap, but I never mind if a lower level person is in the group personally.
---
yes but now it's 1 every 2 minutes for me.The game is unplayable
---
Power armor? Chinese stealth suit? Hazmat suit? Rad x and radaway diluted? What‚Äôs the issue? Low health builds can utilize any of those and be just fine in a nuke zone.
---
FYI, it‚Äôs just ‚Äòaccount‚Äô, but that does redirect you anyways
---
What about canned meat and nuka cramberry?
---
Poorly. Some people have studied it, but it‚Äôs basically just diminishing return based on your DR and the enemies lvl
---
Charleston capital building, artkos pharma and even nuke runs/sbq help too. I was just level 104 when I wanted to switch builds and now 144 in about a week tops
---
I've been here since beta. I was one of the ones laughing my arse off paying less than half price weeks after launch. I know the history of the game &amp; all the screw ups.
---
Bethesda didn't deliver. Not even close. However you don't get to retroactively demand value when you had all the info you needed to know that you're a sucker for doing so.
---
Not asking for a handout? What do you think free Fallout 1st is?
---
Bethesda owes you nothing. Well, they owe us a lot of bug fixes &amp; content not to be consistently late but we both know that's never happening.
---
I have to say, I love the Commie robot.  I don‚Äôt mind his proselytizing at all.  Plus, he gets me as many ball-peen hammers as I could ever dream of needing.
---
Lol do what you will, I am invincible to your puny threats.
---
She used to a while back.  Not anymore though.
---
yes, because it has its own backpack as part of the outfit. hence the one you equip is hidden.
---
If your on pc I sell mine for 350. So far have adrenal, marsupial, and speed demon
---
Basically for chems they get overwritten by the type.  A psycho type will go over another. A mentat will go over another, etc. with food it's a little less clear but in general if it gives a particular stat boost another one will overwrite it. Canned meat will overwrite relish for example as they both give xp and any of the int ones will overwrite.
---
If you are herbivore the best is to use cranberry relish and brain bombs and berry mentats.
---
Angry turtle on YouTube did a breakdown of the best for combat stacking recently. Go check him out for more details.
---
Edit: oh and the lunchboxes are like their own thing. They stack with everything just like the double/triple xp weekend bonuses do. So the food above plus a double cap weekend and 4 lunchboxes will have you hitting the 4K cap per kill for most super mutants if you are wearing full unyielding/int gear and 15 int.
---
It‚Äôs just a soft cap
---
For PA and also as ammo for gatling lasers, which are a pretty good weapon type if you're into heavies.
---
Nah Xbox nd I aldready got the ones i need just looking to mass produce to sell
---
It is not the cheapest and hasn't been for a few months now.
---
Like a doormat fast travel
---
i beat the whole game with  non legendary hunt rifle. only for the last mission i used AA gauss rifle. slow or not u can oneshot everything and it is good to switch to commando build whenever u r set up and ready.
---
Oh. I might need to look up some farming tips. I thought Wes Tek was go to. 
---
A week of playing for how long. A couple of hours a night?
---
My game wouldn‚Äôt let me have more then like 286
---
Fantastic resource. Thank you, Robopop!
---
Stealth suit ftw
---
It does. I‚Äôm tired of it. Got a recommendation for something else? .....I don‚Äôt say that to get you to feel sorry for me. I know so many of you have had difficult lives. Some far, far harder than mine.
---
I picked up paints yesterday and a scribe outfit today. Before that I always got a handful of ammo. It's all just luck.
---
If you're on PC I'll buy all your plastic!  Both because I want the plastic and because I want to screw over the BoS.  Screw those guys.  ;)
---
I'd say mod after lvl 50, but that is me.
---
Junkies?
---
I‚Äôm a PC player and would happily drop the 250 caps for it!!
---
As soon as guys show up with explosive energies the whole game goes to shit
---
Its not dead...its just theres so much already out there its highly doubtful at lvl 73 you have anything worthwhile
---
Stimps come very easy...maybe sell something harder to come across
---
 Dell XPS 8930  &lt; There's your problem.
---
I honestly don't see the event failing. Either Bethesda will reduce the number to a more manageable target or outright cheat &amp; boost it.
---
Don't worry, it'll be fine.
---
Baby mega sloth????
---
For me at also depends on how long the grind is gonna take. If the set is marginally better than SS but is gonna take twice as long to grind out what I want for it, then not likely. If it offers something fairly unique, or far better usability, then definitely.
---
I feel like I‚Äôm talking to a glitched npc here...
---
Depends on where you are now and why you wanna switch too. Rifleman go commando easy. Melee to commando, harder, but you may have many of your special and perks allocated the same depending on your play style. I have both and the agility, charisma and luck perks would be almost identical between the two, so I‚Äôd just need to shift special from strength to perception  (15 level ups) and get the right perks (another 20 or so assuming I hadn‚Äôt gotten any from perk packs). But if your two builds are really different it may take longer.
---
yheeeee, he can craft it now, thanks for your FAST reply. ut helped us out alot. spared a lot of stress and time. many thanks!!!!!!
---
It worked for me on a private server but not a public one, you PS4?
---
Fallout 1st....or better manage your stash.
---
I'm still confused about the s'mores recipe, which calls for Graham. The bastard won't make me any!
---
Yes! Excellent ideas!!!
---
Also has a rear sovereign teddy bear that can spawn in the dog house for those that want to collect all teddy bears.
---
What do you mean fallout 1st?
---
Happy hack, oops, cake day!
---
The Explorer outfit hides the backpack, too. It's a random world spawn.
---
Fallout 1st is a subscription which gets you an unlimited stash box for junk.
---
Oh right, thanks
---
A once yearly parade event. Very easy. However everyone in any server was on it. Rare Masks, Legendaries for just completing it (my 3* Two Shot Fixer, TSE Minigun, Junkies GatLaz, etc) changed my whole build.
---
It was fun lowkey and you saw the best of everyones camps because player vending came back just as the event came.
---
So many legacy weapons were traded for the rare masks
---
Welcome to 76. No you can't get more stash. You can get unlimited storage for scrap exclusively if you pay for fallout 1st which helps a lot but isn't worth it for most people. You could make a second character to hold stuff if you have someone you trust to transfer it
---
Any of the weapons added to new vegas with the gun runners arsenal. Loved running around with a nika-cola sign
---
This is also due to the two shot feature on your rifle.  Two shot does that in vats, not sure if it‚Äôs a bug or an intended feature but it‚Äôs been around for a while.  Coupled with the VATs bugs, it‚Äôs a lil frustrating.  Personally I find handmades best suited for commando over rifleman.  I‚Äôd go lever or gauss if you want rifleman.  If you have all the cards use your handmade with a powerful auto receiver at queen fights and switch back to rifleman with a lever etc.
---
Works on a plasma rifle with the beam splitter too, not sure if a lot of people knew this but I just found out the other day and have been having a blast with some magic plasma damage. It‚Äôs affected by rifleman perks though not shotgunner for anyone interested in doing this. My quad plasma rifle has the limb damage that causes the magic.
---
Blackjack tables
---
Ok, I was just going off the same thing sound/screen shake
---
Take your time and explore region by region , until one waistland comes out each zone has its own normal level range
---
What kind of armor works well for that? I‚Äôm getting tired of searching for unyielding pieces. (Don‚Äôt mean to keep picking your brain)
---
Take mods off the weapons you don't use. Gets rid of some PAs. Get someone you trust to move chems and aid and anything you haven't used in 2 weeks to another character. I just did it and it freed up so much. Some stuff you don't wanna get rid of but can't afford. And yeah fo1st unfortunately.
---
Always scrap your junk, don't stick loot straight in your stash :-)
---
Good for you bud. I hope Bethesda gets the message.
---
No problem glad I could help. Enjoy the wasteland!
---
Welcome to the beginning of the true fo76. For the rest of eternity you will manage that 800lbs. Is this better to keep than that? Do I need 100 bones? Why do stimpacks weigh so much?  These are the questions you will lament over while trying to snag an extra xp nap. Your only salvation is to become a wasteland millionaire and buy FO1st. But even then, the gains will be fleeting and you will soon be back to asking the same questions during the rad storms.
---
What special do you need for that card?
---
Literally said it out loud in my best professor voice and my wife stared at me like I just yelled some sort of nonsensical phrase. 
---
She's never seen Futurama.
---
And the (also B.O.S.) Scientist outfit adds a breathing gas bottle &amp; valve to your backpack, sticking out from the top of it. Which, depending on the backpack skin you're using, can look quite cool.
---
Event reward from encrypted.
---
Bout 6 hours a day, I'm off work from a surgery so I've been burning myself out of the game lol I wasn't really focused on farming tho I would do a couple farn spots and launch a nuke then just hang around doing events and stuff
---
go through your junk and make sure everything is scrapped. if in doubt just take everything out and scrap all at a workbench.
---
Dump missiles and nukes. And fusion cores unless they're close to full or full. 
---
Check for mods. They can add up when you have a lot. Get rid of excess aid. sell it in your vendor. 
---
Then go through your junk and see what you have. For common stuff try keeping 30-50 of each. for uncommon. a bit more. For rare. whatever. 
---
Use this to find junk when you need it  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) 
---
see what legendaries you have. sell or scrap stuff you don't want to use.
---
Nice try Bethesda, we know this post is you!
---
There is a small cabin on top of cliff just south, slightly east of the crater. 3 bags near tinker workbench.
---
One bag will drop down below ground but pops back up.
---
Also at Clancy Manor make sure to grab all the crystal decanters which have 1 cork.
---
Try Windows key / left shift / left ctrl / B (all four together); it's supposed to restart the graphics driver I think.
---
Heya hades, pacifichero45 here ;)
---
Thats a good point. I want to switch from my unarmed build (has high agility for the agility based defense perk) to a heavy guns/explosives build. I plan on using the m-whatever grenade launcher and grenades. Which i know isnt the strongest but i made a new character to play around with it and it was fun. Mostly i will use the build for pve item farming in order to open my new player store: Pants-On-My-Thighs Johnson's Budgrt Mart.
---
I never really thought about it but...the WV enclave may have influenced the west coast to a huge degree. After they killed themselves with their little civil war in their little enclave the west coast most likely went "Yeah no more mutants in our ranks".
---
Got ya. Usually i can play max 3 hours a day if that. But i would focus 100% on farming.
---
With Junkies, you don‚Äôt need to have specific armor. Gives you a lot more freedom.
---
Just got a junkies one hours ago and i love it. Very ammo efficient and one shots most enemies. One of my favourite guns atm. Very underrated
---
I agree on both accounts. Even watching the livestream during QuakeCon At Home, they sounded like college students working on a project. But I digress.   
---
It will be interesting to see if we can indeed fail a week, or if it auto-completes and they say, "Yay, you guys did it!". The Brotherhood emblem is something I've asked for since the early run of the game. Heck, even a flag similar to the waving type would be awesome. Even when we unlock these items, doesn't it become available in the Atom Shop for purchase anyhow?
---
Is it worth putting my scrap in bulk if I can?
---
Is it worth making like bulk wood etc
---
I claim a workshop then start farming cork for the next level
---
Only bulk that saves space is aluminum and lead. Only reason to bull any other material is to sell it to npc venders who only accept bull junk.
---
Ores take up weight in misc. I usually smelt them, need acid though, at the Chem workbench. Then, I can sell what I don't need.
---
I don't need to dream about something that's already been written and canonized, the hell are you on about? West coast BoS - the original, is dead and gone, finished.
---
I actually reinstalled FO4 and found it to be unplayable because the environments in FO76 are soooooo much better!
---
Enclave production vendors
---
Been happening before Patch 21
---
Modus vendors should sell plans for x01 mods
---
It‚Äôs been for a while. You still can get their loot if you press the button quickly
---
Ha!  Every once in awhile I see a post on here that jogs my memory waaay back to B.E.T.A., and I realize that Bethesda‚Äôs pretty bad at saying they‚Äôre going to do something ‚Äòsoon‚Äô and never doing it.
---
Yeah I have a few of the random spawns. I know a lot of my rare ones dont hide it. I know the scribe outfit hides it for sure. I'm trying to gather up a few *a e s t h e t i c a l l y* pleasing ones.
---
ah mk thx
---
alright cool, I'll check again.
---
I already know that, its pretty clever. But that's not what I'm talking about.
---
This was different. They dropped already dead, ragdoll physics and everything, then disappeared. No meatpile, no lootable corpse. Just vanished as they hit the ground. None of us could even tag one.
---
That part was amazing!
---
Should be in the production part.
---
If they would just fix the chainsaw it could be utterly devastating. Maybe one day lol
---
Nah, it's not a new bug. It comes and goes like a hundred of other bugs. Just switch servers and hope for the best.
---
Thank you for this, I'll check it out.
---
Shaq Week
---
If you can, yes. Can turn 200lbs of junk into 160-180, but 2nd mule character is usually best bet for excess chems or legendaries you dont want to scrip/sell but dont use right now
---
Both only do base damage
---
If you're on PS4, I have some spare plans available
---
It‚Äôs a rare drop...about 1 in 20 chance
---
Thaq week*
---
What‚Äôs the exploit?
---
I get that. There are so many grinds in this game that you really have to pick your battles.
---
The people that duped a bunch of each junk where you at?
---
How many perk cards each one is sharing. If you go to your perk cards, you will see an option to share cards. I believe its 4 Charisma per card to share.
---
I just started back up after over a year of not playing, can you please explain what this does?
---
So they build an event with unrealistic expectations and shitty participation rewards, then put the desirable reward in the atom shop for money later because the game as a whole couldn't meet their unreasonable goal? Seems shitty to me.
---
When I looked at the event and saw the numbers they wanted per reward, I KNEW it was impossible. The only way this event would have succeeded is if we knew 2 months ago what was needed AND everyone has 1st AND the rewards are rewarding.
---
Hehe, are you talking about the new game Fallout dungeons?
---
Yeah... I have endless steel and cloth but concrete, cork, and plastic I either use or just never find. I hope we get the rewards regardless like everyone seems to think but I'm doubting it.
---
Wasn't the remodelling a cover story for the bunker, or something?
---
Dunno, and i wouldnt spread the information if i did
---
Should be relatively simple then, not too many specials to move around. I actually regularly switch between unarmed, one handed, two handed and heavy on my strength toon. That means they aren‚Äôt as optimised for heavy as they could be but it‚Äôs still functional.
---
I'm gonna do the 250, prolly just 1 time, just to make sure I've been a part of ,but concrete is tough. Copper will be a bit easier
---
This is just my guess as to what will happen. They have not stated anything about this at the moment.
---
East of vault 76.
---
Yes, and Gatling Lasers.
---
What about the wall racks not aligning to walls/prefabs?
---
So is there anything out there comparable in appearance to either the Engineer or Drifter or Enclave Officer costume?
---
Thank you! We're currently re-installing it so if it happens again we will try that
---
Before getting to hi level and ammosmith+super duper I literally used any weapon I had ammo for. Jack of all trades.
---
Also yeah scrounger, the one for med ( free drugs to boost your DMG) and food. Had those till level 70
---
And shotguns kinda suck. Got me quad explosive double barr and it needs 5 hits to kill super mutant. Meanwhile my exploding 1 star minigun kills them in 6 shots
---
I get 3k steel from Line in the Sand or 1k from Uranium Fever.
---
I had accumulated less than 200 concrete on my over level 300 character.
---
At 7 concrete per bag that is 36 bags of concrete for 1 turn in.  THIRTY SIX.  And they don't drop, you have to get them from world spawn.
---
Scorched occasionally drop pipes which scrap to ONE concrete.
---
LMAO!
---
Always be alert for play vendors too! I've been playing since beta, just started floating around and alot of  folks have various items. I find serums for anywhere between 75 and 500 caps...  You never know!
---
If only you knew, bashing damage is the single strongest legendary effect in the game if it‚Äôs on any weapon with fire rate over 200 or any shotgun.
---
Not even joking. Bashing damage is the reason the scorchbeast Queen dies in 30 seconds sometimes.
---
the camera lists whats in the frame in the upper right of the screen.. you can find the corpse with it as long as it hasnt sunk under the map
---
3 per point. so you need 6 points for a rank 2 perk card
---
Sometimes ill get stuck aiming down sights until I reload. Hope this helps
---
Awesome. Thanks
---
I hoard like nobody‚Äôs business. I still only had ~2500 concrete to give. I have about the same in cork. I took some workshops today to farm some more up, but even that didn‚Äôt get me back up to 250 to be able to donate again.
---
I wasnt sure on Charisma cost
---
I don't think they'll care as an organization.  Nothing so far has really made them show any shame.
---
Okay found a working method for Xbox players, after collecting the t fuse and the blood sample force quit after re entering the med centre, then relaunch and read everything on the terminal but do not accidentally press the analyze blood option until you put the t fuse in first. Then put sample in centrifuge (only press a 1 time) wait 5-10 seconds you‚Äôll get a checkpoint. Then open the terminal and only press the analyze blood option. If you make any mistakes immediately force quit.
---
I had that happen with the Blueridge Backpack plan. I spent probably months running it as often as I could. It was the last item of theirs I didnt have and it would not drop. Saw it at a players camp so I bought it and it dropped the very next damn time I played. Ive since ended up with about 3 of them. This game trolls its players Im sure of it
---
It would need a no build zone around it.  That way if people place traps you will be safe.  Also have it placeable on ground only.  Stop players removing the floor over a cliff edge.
---
But this would be difficult to do.  Players would find a way around it.
---
There are already mods out on PC on Nexus. I‚Äôve ported some of the body/clothes mods myself easily (all you need are ba2 files, no esp file support in 76)
---
Luckily it's not just bash damage but as soon as that's patched bash legendary weapons go back to being scrip
---
"doesn't play the game"
---
I think that's a given.
---
So if someone with a first account shows up to the event, it happens? I dont have 1st anymore, but I'm trying to figure out how having a subscription would bug out general gameplay, that's kinda weird.
---
Area resets are more like 10 minutes than 2 hours.
---
Definitely not that high
---
Every choice is made to force players out of the game and into the atom shop. Every single choice. By allowing terrible ui/aoe choices means that there is no one there who plays the game. No employees at Bethesda plays fallout 76.
---
It's gotten much worse since 21.
---
I feel like it used to be just in a few spots, and now it seems like any zone that has a bunch of players around theres a ghoul, super mutant, something that is in god-mode.
---
Automatic rifles seem completely unnecessary to me. If you want to use rifleman and not have to worry about ammo use a lever rifle. I have a bloody one and it does more damage than a handmade and I never need to farm or craft ammo. I got the ArmCo ammo machine from raider rep and not only does it cover what I use but I always end up with more than I need, which sells well. Even without the ammo machine you'll never be hurting for ammo.
---
I do carry a handmade (non-automatic) for times when I need to be able to fire of a bunch of rounds quickly, like ghoul swarms.
---
will do, wish some of them would understand reasonable pricing though lol
---
One does not make money on serums for a while. For me it takes roughly 44 serum sales to break even on a particular mutation. This is from buying the recipe for 17.5k and selling the serums for 400 a piece and does not include the time or caps investment for the stable flux. The major benefit of serums is that you can sell them to other players for less than the npcs buy them. This creates a market for players buying the serums and lets you gain money beyond the 1400 cap vender limit.
---
Honestly I have the habit of hoarding in the beginning but after that I just collect junk as I need it so I think I have about 5 concrete to offer but I'm not really a fan of giving up my junk especially to people as greedy as the BOS
---
&gt;!Just in case you don't know, it's an in-game handheld(by character) camera item(..weapon?) we are talking about, which you will have to do a quest to get it btw!&lt;
---
If you already have it just not quite familiar to it, the range of name showing is quite short, felt like around only 7 meters actually, but have no idea about the console version though, but that's how it works on PC
---
Patch 21 broke the quest but reportedly the quest works fine IF your the first one to do the quest on that server you are on. If someone else already did that quest on that server you are on than you won't be able to advance the quest so people are having better success completing the quest on a Private Server through their Fallout 1st subscription.
---
I was thinking about the feasibility of a vampires/medic auto grenade launcher.  Then just spam the hell out of the area around the collossus.  
---
But hell would freeze over before explosive guns are worth having.

I'll be on tomorrow. Just stop by my camp ign icorndawg
---
Lol they don‚Äôt even play their own game.
---
Most important thing other than have fun: scrap and store your junk constantly. If you die you drop any junk you have but that's it. Dying means nothing if you have no junk
---
Aren't the mannequins alive and tied to the old ones?  What if gnomes are too?
---
No camp rebuilds, I no longer feel the drive to get that sweet fireplace door that shouldn't be grindwalled behind logging in every day for 10 weeks

Asking as I've never had this so I actually didn't know you can spawn in it..
---
I didn't know that, thanks for that info.
---
It‚Äôs nearby a ‚Äúnon-marked‚Äù experimental farm that has a bunch of fertilizer. For some reason one of the builder bots are friendly but legendary and you can kill
---
I'd give 50/50 odds there isn't even a tracker on the back end for turn-ins.
---
Got cha. I've got 3
---
You mistyped "when"
---
Much appreciated! You are a hero among the 76ers
---
Yeah it really needs some kind of pre warning that makes it clear that you are about to start an event that has a high level of difficulty, specially since the questline is often encountered and completed well below lvl 50. I think i was in the late lvl 20s to 30s when I did it. I had knowledge from reddit about what happenes next. The vast majority of players wouldnt have that
---
 I run a very similar build. Just, unyielding instead of PA.
---
For perception, I have a problem with energy dmg. I use refractor 2 and glow sight 1. 
---
For endurance, if you're bloodied, i use lifegiver radicool, adamantium, etc.
---
Lifegiver is the ' extra health' and it SEEMINGLY helps quite a bit. You also dont always have to have power patcher equipped. First aid 1 or 2 is sufficient for most encounters
---
I removed someone for being an ass and then he stole my workshop that was fun
---
&gt; doesn't play the game.
---
looks like you might've found the problem...
---
Not a bad camp, and good use of the glitches.. But i know my camp would be 10x better with double the budget, glitches like underground basements and buying a bunch of camp items from the atom store as well.. Wish they woukd hurry up the camp building improvements already.
---
Yes then everyone can have Orbital Strike Miniguns on console!
---
No argument that is a great game!
---
I‚Äôve tried everything multiple times... does not work...
---
You know, i honestly have no idea where or how to even donate these materials. Nothing pops up in game for me.
---
Fireproof will help, yes. Fear sadly cannot be resisted  but if you fight against a wall reduces the chances of running into dangers (like the falling rocks or excavator drills on the edges of the map). Bloodied seems to do best (sorry to be bearer of bad news there) and vampire heavy is highly suggested to not die constantly
---
Atom shop would be major egg on their face.  I‚Äôd wager it shows up as an early S2 reward.
---
It's only visual from what I can see (open map/legendary run and you'll see your actual score is higher than shown in-game)
---
Every time I fast travel to my base I clip through about 60-90 in-game feet of earth, crashing to my death if not in power armor. From down there in the bowels of Hell, I can then travel to my base at the correct spawn point, but the first few times I tried going home after a successful scavenging mission were extremely frustrating, since the place my dropped loot is at isn't accessable in normal game play.    
---
    
---
I realize I'm late to the discussion, but has anybody else encountered *this* fast travel bug? It only started up about 3 weeks ago.
---
:/
---
If there were more fast travel points this wouldn't be an issue.
---
Also, people are gonna amass near the easiest spot. If your CAMP is at a frequent location you're gonna server hunt. Anything near WS, Foundation etc is fair game.
---
In theory, I would like this. This game is a grind and it would be nice not to feel locked to one version of it without throwing the time spent away if you wanted to switch.
---
In practice, I see very little possibility that Bethesda would be able to implement this smoothly, certainly not on the first few iterations at the very least.
---
Lol I agree. If I come across any, I'll let you know. I dont run PA for any build, but it wouldn't be x 01 if I did, so you can have em all
---
Here is the trick for the hanging cabinet: hang the wall cabinet on the wall at the height you want. It will go in backwards and be on the exterior now. Go outside and place a shelf below the cabinet. Now blueprint the shelf and cabinet together. Now store them away and go back inside. Pull up the blueprint and the cabinet will now snap into place appropriately with the shelf being slightly off of the wall. Now just scrap the shelf.
---
I‚Äôm finding that the ammo converter helps quite a bit now that they increased the amount of points it stores. I still have an issue with hoarding fusion cores.
---
Time to break out the gatling laser for a while...
---
I left the terminal so I could actually see how many players were turning up. The timer had only ticked down 2 mins at most when the other player took it upon themselves to jump down through the roof to start it. To be fair I was about to start it anyway since a good showing rolled up quickly but players were still loading in and more came after it started. The event never runs long when Ive done it. I think another half minute to minute wouldve been better for starting but it is what it is I guess
---
That‚Äôs what I do. I make sure I have plenty of diluted radaway and my stealth suit in my inventory at all times. Then when the nuke drops I can just pop them on and go to town. No biggie at all.
---
Did the individual rewards change?
---
oh really? thanks
---
I actually think it would of been cool is the resource drive was to build a settlement for Appalachia locals. Like a thing to rebuild Flatwoods as a new settlement. Make it so you can have instance interiors so people could actually move in and furnish homes. Limit what they can do though because for crafting, cooking etc their should be communal spaces.  
---
They really need to invest on the social life in this game and encouraging people to interact better with each other. Private Teams are handy for grinding but little else. Making a "roleplay" public team doesn't count either
---
I have been running a bloodied build similar to [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f9635a8&amp;w=s52s92ss2sg2se2pd1pk1pl1pp2em1eh2eu0cu2ir2aj2ar2an2ao0lt1lu2la2&amp;m=051c249fe8gh7b3d6i&amp;n=Unarmed%20hybrid), I have made some adjustments for what you want to do. It works really well, use unarmed for though enemys and rifles for mobbing or anything annoying which flys or is too far away you can also fall back to it during some events if you can't handle to stay close range. 
---
A good thing to do is to always pop a nuka-cola (either normal or cherry is fine) when going in, so you have constant regen, as the auto-regen glitch was fixed. If you want to play in a team reduce tenderizer in favor of strange in numbers.
---
(I mainly got charisma on three for hard bargain and intelligence on 5 for crafting)
---
Why would you sell fuel, that shit is sacred!
---
Every game I have works. I think it has to do with the servers, not my pc.
---
I built the sunshine meadows food processing factory up using a fusion generator and a turret tower just outside the door next to the junk pile and had Grahm attack me 2-3 times with no provocation and then he would just randomly decide he didn‚Äôt need to attack me and then left.  No clue what that was all about.
---
For sure. I have no use for quite a few items. You're on my friends list after this morning,  so I'll be arouns
---
I am a bit confused, as starched genes does not change the effect of mutations at all, it just ensures you can't get new ones/loose any. I think you meant the "class freak" perk which reduces the negatives?
---
3) Granted you need to have enought SPECIAL to actually equip it
---
Unyielding build? backpack? Mah Carry Weight!
---
Sadly, that did not work either :(
---
Agreed, one of my biggest gripes with the game currently
---
My buddy and I both are sitting on about 100 weight of 2 stars and such that we cant sell..even over 2 days
---
Yea, I feel the same way about them. I use a Tesla on my main (despite the poor damage) because of how it looks (and also because it is good at tagging stuff during events). However, I need to rely on other weapons when I need to dish out serious damage.
---
do you mean to say this is too far a departure? or literally? I must have missed the leak if so ;D
---
I might try it. Right now I'm rocking the treasure hunter with the plague doc mask and the yellow slicker. Sadly the treasure doesnt hide the backpack but oh well
---
Yes. In the glory hole. If I‚Äôm lucky enough just right outside of it. Either way it‚Äôs to far to quickly get away. Especially when it pulls the over encumbered bullshit and you just walk reeeeeaaaaalllll ssssssslllllllooooowwww
---
Lol, as we all know this was only going to work if all 1st emptied all their resources, and why would they want that? I'm thinking really hard...
---
It's really low on purpose to make you geek like you need to play tomorrow as that makes the game have a steady playerbase
---
In all seriousness, nuke excursions require a lot of prep for me... Also, the SBQ is just a bullet sponge with so/so rewards for me at this point (1300 hours in game).
---
I dont use discord so much..
---
If you're on xbox, lemme know. I try to play daily and am willing to link up with anyone, any level, as long as I'm on.
---
See, this is exactly why I stopped drinking gorilla nectar
---
I'll look forward to it :D
---
I had 1500 concrete and I pick up everything! I donated 500.
---
This sounds like a lot of fun.. I‚Äôll have to make sure I stay on long enough to see it this year
---
Yes but I found a way after losing numerous legendary ones. So if one is like that go over bash it, it will stand up. Then just Keep bashing and hitting the pick up button right when you kill it you have less then a second to grab gear. I‚Äôve done this now 7 times. I lost probably 5 before that. But wasn‚Äôt allowing it to happen anymore
---
Yeah like In the beginning of the game I as fine cause I barely found legendaries but now that enemies are higher levels and o game and I do scorched earth events I have too many legendaries
---
its only 10 minutes for enemy respawn not loose item respawn ... at least thats how it works for me
---
I'd just like it if the robots would stop dropping dead when I walked past them like I have some sort of static-electric-plague. It's creepy!  
---
But really, I do love farming the ghouls but I would love to see something more become of Whitesprings and all the inaccessible areas. Good ideas!
---
Todds curse on the fallout first subscription 
---
Making you stay or say bye bye to infinite junk storage
---
Ouf, that is one terrible and frustrating bug,
---
I run full health build so I die maybe once a week and don't see any of the bugs related to that.
---
- YK42b Pulse Rifle
---
- Pancor Jackhammer
---
- Vindicator Minigun
---
- Needler Pistol (Myron, Myron, baby Myron)
---
Trade a weapon or armor for a bunch of presents.
---
Put on these clown shoes, clown shoes. That‚Äôs what I get from Bethesda with every decision they make. Game won‚Äôt last into 2021 at this rate. Got a world indoors and players are deleting this game.
---
Yup after a couple times I said screw this and bash until they die and grab quick. Got actually really good loot from them then too. Today got a instigating 3 star gat plasma for a 3 star explosive furious black powder rifle among other things
---
Na man you need AA for that extra penitation
---
Yeah I know, my best bet has been selling at my personal vendor for nothing above 600 caps, unless its 3 star god rolls, but ya know.
---
I usually just post 2 star armor and weapons there for like 299 C, and 399 C. Just cause I want the less weight in my stash. Wish I could sell for scrip or sumn though.
---
If you're on PC I can give you an instigating pipe revolver rifle lvl 20
---
I'd recommend replacing Full Charge with something else, as fusion cores are easy to come by and last a long time. That being said, Power User is still useful especially if you use a gatling laser, as it doubles the magazine to a max of 999 shots.
---
Same for Power Patcher. PA has considerably more durability than regular armor, and you'll go long periods of time without needing to repair them. If you join in on Scorchbeast Queen fights a lot, then you'll never even need materials for repairs.
---
Stabilized and the STR heavy weapons perks are a great choice. If you wish to use mutations, you might want to consider Starched Genes.
---
Quick Hands and Lock and Load is amazing for weapons with low magazine sizes, but you should be able to take care of most enemies before even needing to reload.
---
I suggest keeping the 3 perception for lockpicking, you never know when you might need it.
---
Bloody Mess is worth ranking up fully.
---
Of course, all of this comes down to your playstyle. If it works for you, then it works.
---
Also, for the Queen, I've heard that staggering her while she's in the air (with perks like One Gun Army) prevents her from landing, which greatly extends the fight.
---
Concrete is hard man. My wife's been farming it all day and barely managed 500.
---
*unlimited*
---
I find the rare trader but she usually has recipes or junk. One time had clothes but nothing rare
---
I thought it is this for a full Lvl 5 perk card. 1st kill activates it, then 10% for the 2nd kill, 20% for the 3rd kill and so on up to the 7th kill which is 60% and then 60% for all other kills after that with the 30 second timer resetting after each kill.
---
I feel like they set us up to fail. Less work for them.
---
But you can get outside of area that will show you on the map, and cars will be blowing outside as you get in their draw distance, other than that I haven't found anything interesting
---
Probs to your wife that‚Äôs a lot for concrete!
---
Yeah I get those quite often at white springs, standing gormless with 1HP , but I had a new one today where I was farming acid, came across a level 42 glowing snally, and it was    invincible it could run around and damage me but I couldn't damage it at all?
---
Rare trader also spawns below the grove sometimes but in a unmarked area. So I always check there everyday now
---
What do you mean by god roll?  I am new üòÅ
---
I think if you could mark a foundation as the arrival that it could work because then even if it's some how floating in the middle of nowhere your at least standing on it and can just fast travel away
---
It works only on armour and weapons
---
Tbh Tesla was only good for the Stealth Boy PvP scene before cola nut, the ability to not only hit a ‚Äústealth‚Äù target but also to track and stagger rendering any sent. ass armor user helpless. Plus the only armor that provides high enough resistance to energy is leather but that‚Äôs super weak to ballistic
---
They are either making room for a friend, or kicking you because you're not sharing a perk that benefits them, or if you're not mutated maybe they want the full buff from Strange in Numbers. 
---
Also, people are dicks. If someone kicks you just find or start another team.
---
Next donation event, I swear,  is gonna have like 250,000,000 Screws!
---
Throw on armourer L2+, it cuts the V94 steel down to 10 per craft and lowers all the other assorted junk
---
I'm not looking at doing a bloodied build, doesn't exactly fit the idea I had for this char (a mix between a BoS Knight/ Paladin and Scribe), though may try it with my second char (if there is enough wiggle room leftover. Current plan is ally with Raiders, using a bow/ crossbow and either Marine or Heavy Combat armors)
---
Does Refractor and Rad Resistance combine with the equipped PA's bonuses?
---
As for Power Patcher, it has (to me at least) been very useful. In the 65 lvls since getting the Ultracite, I have only repaired it twice (though not sure how well it would work with an inferior set like T- 60, as I had just gotten the Knight paint scheme). But will try with maxed out First Aid
---
I‚Äôve not tried it with other backpacks, but the imposter sheepsquatch outfit almost fully hid the baby moth man skin. It looked pretty good IMO.
---
Well if we don't get it we tried man. The cosmetic stuff was the only stuff I really even wanted. The extra event stuff I could take it or leave it.
---
In my case the timer had only ticked down 2 minutes and players were still rolling in. There was a good number already waiting but there was no need to start it quite so soon. I wouldve preferred to let everyone load in properly. Usually when Ive started it players give me a thumbs up emote when they think its good to start and I oblige. Another 30 seconds at most and I was going to launch it.
---
What system are you on bud?
---
Brotherhood of Steel Forward Operating Base (FOB).
---
The rewards are such shit, I stopped donating. I have 0 interest and I am sure others feel the same.
---
Why? It is quite easy for high-level character even if it never played NW, just open all the packs, equip perk card for hacking, perk card for finding meds. Spawn, find terminal, get tons of stimpacks from it, search containers and you have around 8 stimpacks already to last you 2-3 minutes in fire
---
Wow, so brave.
---
If they're legendary you better loot them right away or you wont have access to their loot.
---
I never got meat piles either.
---
Like most weapons it has some uses (pvp, tagging monsters in a rush fight for xp) but it isn't always the best for general use. I know some people that swear by them for pvp. I have never found much use for them other than quads for tagging stuff for xp
---
RIP to those of us who don‚Äôt have 1st and struggle with stash space, and don‚Äôt keep more than ~150/200 of most of the meh junk. Another ‚Äúwtf were they thinking‚Äù moment for Bethesda and FO76.
---
Yeah I was running it with the ghillie backpack and ghillie ss Helm. I liked it. Just wanted the plague doc mask since they last had it. Trying out with diff stuff for sure.
---
You don't really need Scrounger if you run Lucky Hole mine for lead. I'd put some of those points into Bloody Mess 3 (great perk for damage). And I tend to run Batteries Included instead of Power User or Full Charge. Just make a habit of holding a power plant workshop here and there and you'll be swimming in fusion cores. Power user doubles fusion cores use, but holding ten times the fusion cores gives you ten times the use! I also don't care for Suppressor. You'd get more mileage out of Squad Maneuvers there for the speed boost. If you're not planning on running a bloodied build, I recommend points in Traveling Pharmacy and Chem Friend instead of Lead Belly to really abuse the Psychobuff for the 25% damage bonus. Lead Belly will be counteracted by the fact that you'll be carrying around tons of Radaway.
---
Two Shot is pretty average since it was nerfed. 
---
You could even argue that Mutants is better because it's a straight up 10% damage buff.
---
My Vampire's +40% Bash with the Shredder mod one shots lots of enemies with bash damage. It probably helps that I'm in need rage / adrenal reaction territory. I should try putting points in increasing bash damage just to see what happens.
---
Event reward
---
Filthy Casuals not to your liking?
---
A lot of is remember when the limit was zero
---
This only works for some junk. For oil I think it makes it heavier.
---
I'm a first member and I don't even think we should be able to place our tents in a public server. It takes real estate away from ppl who don't pay for it, and cant place their camps. Then there's the 10 ppl in power armor on top of a floating one at the scorched beast queen fight. Bro your in power armor and not doing shit for damage! Now she doesn't wanna land and I can't claw her face off with my dcg!
---
Fo1st
---
Go to Atlas there are containers around the outside
---
I can't count the number of times I've taken the wrong chem mid-combat because my buddy next to me is running and my pip boy is shaking but my mouse is not
---
From the comments I can tell you likely do not have a Fallout 1st subscription.  My recommendation to you is to bulk &amp; sell *most* of your junk.  My Personal Rule of Thumb:  Only keep 100-150 of every type of junk except for the junk you use to craft ammo/repair your gear.  So, for me, I kept all my lead, steel, aluminum, screws, and plastic.  I sold everything else, keeping a minimum of 100 pc. of each.
---
Settler Wanderer can spawn there too. I found her just going by there on my alt, still haven‚Äôt gotten her on my level 335 main.
---
^I‚Äôm ^not ^mad ^at ^all
---
Can confirm, whenever I farm for flux i change my unyielding equipment to chinese stralth suit
---
Haven't dropped from queen in a long time. Buy from enclave or other players.
---
I've used them but with official support there'd likely be more if a flood of mod creators porting more over.
---
If you need a buddy to play alongside/ help you out my gamertag is Jttiger18
---
So basically, you're not finding the corpse because it has 100% sunk under the map.
---
Just solo'd a silo for my first nuke ever, used lots of ammo but it wasn't hard; just time consuming.
---
Right now I don't run a GatLas unless it's my Zealot's during SBQ (though been trying my luck to get an Anti- Armor GatLas/ UltraGatLas)
---
As for mutations, not really planning on getting any (specially this char).
---
Never heard that about One Gun Army (been a bit on the fence about the perk anyway)
---
there's a dozen ways something like this could be implemented, and should have been implemented already.
---
easiest solution?  foundation tile.  make it an optional camp piece.  have it coded that nothing else could be placed on that tile.
---
I have changed a bunch and still have a couple hundred levels left to burn. It will really depend on how frequently you want to swap and how far of a swap it is. Str/agi based builds are the most versatile I think. But it's tough to go from str to pet as a main stat. But it's really no big deal if you aren't swapping every week.
---
I personally max int every time there is a dbl do and then move it all back. I generally get enough levels to cover any points I used. Of course this on my main. On all of my alts I generally had a targeted build so I might be less thrilled if I was going to swap one of those. I went back and forth on whether to have characters with each build I wanted or swap builds on my main. In reality if you play long enough you can just do both. =P
---
Another item on this has to do with how effective your grinding is. Make sure you use xp boosts to make this process easier.
---
I definitely agree, especially the banner for me. I really enjoy trying to implement items from all events into my CAMP to help give it character. I‚Äôve gotten a pumpkin from the Mischief Night, the mug, flag, and confetti. Then the fireflies from the Legendary Run. I‚Äôve also already got a spot picked out for the Mounted Colossus Heads when a Colossal Problem finally gets released.
---
who gives a fuck, event is trash, rewards are trash.
---
Field Scribe (Red not Green) hides the backpack as well, being that it has its own.
---
I have donated about 1.5k concrete.  I donated 5k steel.  Even running all 3 workshops, plus scavenger bots and find every bag I can I don't see me getting to 5k for concrete
---
I've repaired my x01 armor once in the last month and a half. Most of it rarely breaks. Get fix it good and you'll never worry about it.
---
One thing they nailed perfectly is the joy of exploration. 
---
Which is good, cause I've been hoofing it on foot more often because of the fast travel bug.
---
like im going to donate my junk for this trash event
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure bethesda doesn‚Äôt want to have to go through all the inappropriate paint jobs people would be sending their way.
---
Thank you I've been afraid to move my camp!
---
I'm taking myself serious enough I guess so no, not for me. This is more for those who feel the big groups are too big.
---
Refractor stacks at least. Not too familiar with rad resistance.
---
I fought bloodied for the first two years, so I totally understand.
---
I primarily only run low health for adrenal reaction. I only have 1 bloodied weapon that I almost never use unless we're all getting wiped too often.
---
Also, even first aid 2 is sufficient for what I've found. Save 1 point here and there, with various lvl 2 perks.
---
Sorry. Good luck :)
---
I‚Äôm so glad I busted my hump to take the 3x workshop in bog town to get 250 donated and get: a bottle of wine, a cryo grenade and a floater grenade. Well worth the effort.
---
Now THAT is what I'm really looking forward to. I wanna kill a wendigo colossus so bad. Haven't even seen one in a nuke zone yet. But soooooon.
---
Lots of good things. Most people who are complaining are end game folks. Lots of fun stuff on the way to the end game. End game content is definitely just grinding with friends.
---
Literally the greatest game of all time...
---
Yeah that is true. But it cost 150 scrip. 100 scrolled for vault steel and 50 for a module reason why it expensive. SS required 1 module. Which is why the V94 is kinda more expensive. Unless people save up on alot of scrips or get lucky rolls. 
---
People are kinda restrain to making one v94 armor piece a day with the scrip vendor limit. While SS armor you can roll 3 day.
---
There are a couple of good posts on here about how to tweak your ini settings to get this game to run smoother.  Just search the subreddit for 'ini tweaks' or something similar.
---
Then there's the ini settings for the [truly desperate](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yv9gs/how_to_play_fallout_76_on_a_potato_pc/).
---
of my varied arsenal, it is the gun I pick when against 15 anglers or 10 ghouls.  
---
It absolutely shreds at line in the sand, and has the benefit of being just shy of a OHKO if I am not sneaking, so I can tag with impunity without hogging all the xp for myself.  At 3 targets hit/shot it is wildly effective at hordes
---
I had the graphics just outright disappear today, all I had was a black screen, and my hud, I still had sound and according to my jetpack noises I was still ingame.
---
Yea it realy is bashing power of
---
6 strenth grognacks axe &lt; bashing power of elven sword level 15 blocking
---
6 strength Grognacks axe&lt; to bashing damage of a dwarven sword level 15 block
---
Hope that helps in any way to explain it
---
This
---
Like, a 3 star executioners +1 strength,  faster swing speed melee weapon is along god roll lines
---
:)
---
Depending on your build all the stars matter, but that's an example.
---
Good grief is player kills right? Just do NW and murder everyone
---
Xbox one
---
No problem shoot me a message if you still having issues.  Right now it is concrete I think. You need 250 on your character to donate and there are no scrap box near by unless a FO 1st camp is up near it.
---
"GT" usually = Xbox

There's one that has bow plans, one that has drugs recipes, one that has a single recipe and then the apparel trader. I have found the good one more times than the others. Recently it seems to be every 4 or 5 times i check she's there.
---
Also, like for stealth sniper or something, like instigating, +perception vats crit or something is also god roll
---
What does the community get for filling the quota for each resource?   Measly gifts with plans and alcohol isnt at all worth me spending any of my resources on... whatever this is.  I havent looked into it and am far to casual to care unless I know the reward will be worth it.

Or sell historical cloths, if you can find one of the plans, then you can convert one crystal scrap into 15 to 20 caps

show me the proof?

yeah, kill 20 players
---
I killed my first SBQ this past week, and I didn't get a drop for it. Is there something else I should have done beforehand? I definitely got hits on her, because there was loot available.
---
It's rule 10, but you might be safe since it's a giveaway? 
---
I guess what I mean is don't delete your post, but don't be surprised if a mod takes it down.
---
Drop them on the floor if they ain‚Äôt selling.
---
if it sunk under the map you cant see it.. otherwise the camera will find it or any chunks of it as the case may be...
---
i‚Äôll take them. you on xbox?
---
No it's not harder.
---
If no ones buying at 5 a piece and you don't want them just give them away. Drop them on the picnic table outside wayward or something?
---
Okay, I never actually went through the mine much (as I abused the hell out of the ammo converter for my .50) and still have over 1,000 lead from how many times I ran Lode Bearing and Breach and Clear. But I am fine with getting rid of Scrounger. Plus, seems Super Duper price a lot more than you would think, specially when crafting Plasma Cores (got around 12 in stash and 4 on char)
---
Hmm, I'll try changing out Full Charge and Power User, see how I like it. 
---
As for Suppressor, I mostly use it for SBQ, but this char has been a solo char (though have helped any lower levels when they need it) 
---
As for using chems, I've never really used them with this char (except Buffout and Grape Mentats occasionally)
---
oh I forgot about that
---
Damn thanks dude!
---
I have found the bow one the chems one and junk one and once I found a outfit one but it wasn‚Äôt nothing special but I still bought all clothes she had

Camden park!
---
Sell them for 1 cap each or drop them in the blue suitcase at the whitesprings station.
---
I‚Äôm glad someone has noticed how good this place is
---
Is it literally just a banner?  No petty side plans for a poster or a paintjob or something?
---
Drop them on the ground or throw them in a random container in the world. Id say roughly 90% of players have 90% of the plans, so unless you can find some new players, they are just taking up space in your inventory.
---
Can "Super Duper" proc of weapon crafting?
---
Although I personally just suck at pvp in this game in general with its jankiness, but I only need that and stand at the center of a nuke zone when it drops.. Good luck in your endeavors to murder 20 people.
---
And corpses, sometimes it takes ages to become a meat pile.

Bumpty

If you're trying to conserve ammo rifleman is better. Full auto is a must for tanky creatures though at the end game. Well if you want to contribute any real dps in fights anyway. You can also just pull the trigger for a single shot or two. But if you are sweating ammo usage just swap to a lever. :-)
---
container at the overseers camp or the suitcase in the morgantown train station are good dumping places for unwanted crap if you want someone else to have a chance at getting them..
---
otherwise throw them on the floor and log off...
---
Okay, it should be a given then that Rad Resistance stacks as well, since it is the same concept, so I'll try that with the Lifegiver perks.
---
Very rare but has been happening to me since wastelanders. Happened twice so not bad just confusing lol
---
I haven't used laser weapons much. I asked and can't get 100% clarification on what perks affect them.
---
you dont have too... its just a farm route
---
Thanks, I'll probably need it! :)
---
The Brotherhood needs you to donate 500,00 toilet paper
---
When you get to a really high lvl the map feels small
---
Can‚Äôt forget those knock back physics on torso shots with the slo mo VATS cam!üòÇüòÇ
---
Oh man it is an extremely enjoyable fight. I‚Äôve managed to kill a few of them. One of them I did solo as a Heavy Gunner right after they buffed him a lot more and holy crap was it difficult. Still managed to take him down but it was a good 20 minutes of fighting. I really want to try and solo the Event when it comes out so right before they delayed it I‚Äôd spent a lot of time collecting supplies and ammo for it.
---
Stealth commando and move before he shoots you. Captnoob did a video on it. Seems pretty easy.
---
All good questions though. Since they are 'tuning' it no telling if what works now will make it into what's on prod.
---
Ultracite fusion cores are cheap to make. 2 empty fusion cores and 1 flux make 3 ultracite cores.
---
I've got a quad ffr and was originally lamenting the drop in damage with the automatic barrel. 
---
Only now am I appreciating the way this thing shreds.
---
It's like killing a damn Genji, best thing is to keep your distance, they can land headshots on you much easier the closer they are
---
Rng assuming you don't have all the plans. I think you may not get those if you already have them. I usually get junk too. Have turned in tons and tons of them from silo runs. I'd definitely peg the odds of getting anything that's not random junk around .1-1%
---
If it's the big one they are cheating
---
For when you actually do a run of Lucky, has a map with the ore spots.

---
Have still yet to find any street light plans. This gas station is looking good!
---
Well done!
---
Who said they was looking into it? I just heard it on e few youtube videos that it was intentional.
---
Use the prosnap camera
---
It wasn't me but I had a very similar experience a few weeks ago. Never forget.
---
Running all mutations doesn't really matter as long as you use class freak. And with stranger in numbers and public groups it really makes no sense not to just use them all. The negatives are tiny. 
---
In short pick any build you want and make sure you use class freak.
---
I‚Äôm down to play with you on xbox. i have zero friends who play 76 :(
---
That's assumption makes no sense.
---
I don‚Äôt know how they thought people would have so much concrete on top of the fact that most of the playerbase has the ‚Äúrare‚Äù rewards already anyway. Concrete won‚Äôt get finished and Bethesda will finish it themselves
---
Trade you some for the neon light plans lol
---
Won‚Äôt let me PM. Not sure why.
---
I fear I missed my chance üòÖüò∞
---
I think it's probably that skin for the camp thing. Read online it screws things up.
---
I don't have any Heavy Weapons or PA perks.  
---
I've never used them that gear.
---
I like the gatling more since it's more efficient but honestly just keep both
---
Bear Arms and keep both?
---
For my heavy gun build, Gatling is a general use, weapon, sips ammo and will work fine in most situations.
---
I use more rapid heavy guns in events or when I need to kill things fast.
---
Thanks, I've done Lucky once a while ago, (with Excavator PA) but always good to have a reference map (still can't find one for the Lode Bearing quest though)
---
I like by bloodied limb damage endurance thank you very much
---
If ya have FO1st,set em In a container,&amp; transfer em to a new alt/mule...
---
If not,drop em at Wayward,overseers camp or right In front of Vault 76 for the next new person to come along.
---
Yes, apart from the SBQ we only run nukes in private servers, otherwise competition from other players makes it frustrating
---
Pretty sure i just need some perks. Maybe a total of 50 levels. 
---
Off topic: Do you think trying to spec for PA is a good choice? Or would i be spreading myself too thin?
---
You need to go to a trading sub. And real money trading is not allowed. Bethesda can and will ban you for it and they actually do take RMT seriously. Especially posting your PSN is a good way to have someone screen cap report you to get you banned.
---
Also, as others have noted TSE is pretty trash now a days.
---
Do player kills in NW definitely count for that trophy? Not that it helps me greatly because I suck at that too but at least it might be eventually achievable lol
---
I loved my Gatling gun when there was that glitch if you where in third person it shot super fast but since they patch I don‚Äôt use it as much but I still love it and I have both bloodied Gatling and mini and enjoy both. So I would keep both
---
I haven't donated a thing to this 'event', and I don't plan to.  With maybe 40 pounds of stash/carry weight available in total, I wouldn't be able to carry enough for even one turn in.  I have every plan on that reward list anyway, so it's all just useless shat to drop on the ground to keep from going overweight again.  All this amounts to is just another timekiller grind to keep people distracted between actual new content that never happens or gets delayed over and over, of which there hasn't been any in over 4 months, so subbers don't cancel and leave.
---
Something similar has occurred to me.
---
I'm thinking it might be related to some of the other fast travel bugs.
---
I've had times where I clicked on Vault 76, and it asks me if I want to spend caps going there, even though it should be free.
---
I'm thinking the game thought I clicked somewhere else.
---
Have also encounter that same issue going somewhere nearby, and it asks if I want to spend 30 caps going there.
---
Ex: going from Enclave Bunker to Whitesprings Station.
---
I think it depends how much damage you do. I dont get the mounted head nearly as much. Seems like I only get it when I do a lot of damage. You said you can loot her body, so you should be getting at least 1k. You get the flux too right? On a good fight, i probably do somewhere  around 30kish idk what the threshold is if there even is one
---
Happened to me today. The strange thing is it put me in the middle of the woods. There were no marked locations nearby...
---
These bugs have gotten worse since the last update IMO.
---
And if there IS a tracker, 50/50 odds that it doesn't actually work...
---
I like an Instigating Hunting Rifle that has been modded with the .50 Refined Receiver. .50 Cal is not very findable in the world, but, is the easiest to craft.
---
Too bad there aren't any legendary BOS Recon Sniper Rifles!
---
Because MODUS can run everything himself, except for the tasks you‚Äôre required to do.
---
I know you meant souvenir teddy bear... but sovereign teddy bear sounds like a fun NPC like Fuzzy Brenda.
---
Hah that is the same picture I've been using as my character icon for a while now!
---
1) hide grass for console
---
2) auto area loot
---
Or 3) sparkle loot piles/ change loot meat piles to atom shop loot bags
---
Yeah I have first since end of last year and I always picked up everything. But even so I think I only got like 1k if that of concrete. I might donate one time just to donate it
---
I only plan on switching this once. However, down the line... Who knows. Im str/agI now and i believe my next build is the same main stats. Im doing explosives and heavy guns. Havent really messed with a build. Going to after work.
---
My exp farming skills are minimal since i havent done it. Going to watch a youtube video or two before I really settle in and grind.
---
PA lends itself to heavy guns because of the stabilised perk. I don‚Äôt PA myself so I‚Äôd ask someone with experience in that area.
---
Scout mask 0.15??? Lol no wonder i haven‚Äôt gotten it
---
Not all the bodies turn to flies very quickly. I have encountered some that never do, while all the rest already have turned to flies. It also is a fucking pain trying to find even the sound of flies when your furious explosive .50 cal machine gun has knocked it clear through the woods.
---
Really? Well then I happily stand corrected. We haven't bothered with morgantown in ages so I'm obviously out of touch, good info is always appreciated. Thanks
---
I guess the legendary count will be much lower though, that's a shame.
---
I seriously just drop them half the time anymore. I went to whitesprings one night and there was all these dropped bags. I looked through them and one had 400 large gifts. I didn‚Äôt play much during Christmas so I didn‚Äôt do Christmas gifts and I didn‚Äôt know ppl duped on the game. So from those gifts I got every mounted plan. I carried them and tried to sell them and I said screw it and dropped them all. I try and keep some rarer ones like fixer and stuff but rest I drop on ground and walk away
---
While I agree with the Vertibird buffs
---
I dont think they should have Atomic shop paints
---
I turned off teams, did the same thing and some how made it to the last 3 people with only a sliver of health.  Nearly half the folks in that match spawned on the edge!
---
Oh I just do a macro of me spamming left click and then tweaking the ms speed between each click and assign it to one of the side buttons. But when clicking said button ingame it either does nothing or does one click if I'm lucky.
---
Xbox
---
Fought it once with 3 others. Took over an hour and we only killed it cause someone dropped a second nuke on him. I stealth suited and literally went through every gun I had, 90% of my ammo. Only tip I learned, when the vocal sac on his neck inflates he‚Äôs about to fear attack, which sends your running out of your control. When you see the sac inflate, focus all shots there to stop the attack.
---
why fucking cares, concrete is pointless trash.
---
Quad ffr would be very nice.
---
Sounds like they‚Äôre preparing for winter...
---
Glad to see I'm not the only person that sucks at PvP! :)
---
how do we get the rewards?
---
what? did the concrete hurt you?
---
That is good info about the vocal sac.
---
I get the impression the devs have long realised it was a boondoggle.
---
Phill swift here for radaway patches just peel an stick for that less than glowing shine
---
I think it would be sweet if we could fix up the actual game world too
---
Like really that bench is overturned I can‚Äôt just stand it back up etc etc
---
Goto nukakrypt. Co.
---
[https://nukacrypt.com/](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
Verify game files, reinstall, run updates. Rinse and repeat.
---
I had this when I was rebuilding my camp. I just scrapped it and waited 24 hours and rebuilt the bot and then it gave me the option to change parameters.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/ is the best place to get the codes
---
Bashing was actually super useful to me early on.
---
Weapons like the Mistress of Mystery pistol that had effects like 'do X amount of extra damage on robots' were super useful to me because that damage was applied whether you shot the robot or pistol whipped them. Which means with a high enough sneak, even at early levels, i could go through places like sugar grove on bash damage alone.
---
wrong
---
I've only been playing for a few weeks so I can't give that clarity. Best I can say is that so far, the info on the following wiki (includes info on perks for weapons) has seemed accurate:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki
---
The use of slope roofs is so creative in that fuel island.  Well done!
---
a car like that doesn't belong in a garage, it needs to roam free in your backyard
---
I just don't see it as a viable weapon in general.  For fun, sure.
---
We all start out with the thought of only switching once. ;-)
---
AngryTurtle on YouTube recently did some great videos on the best items for xo farming. While do farming, if you aren't bloodied, I'd suggest snagging some unyielding armor (preferably with +1 int) and just using a bloodied or instigating lever action for farming. Skipping looting is another key for speed xp farming. Just run and gun. Turtle seems to love his heavy gunner/nostealth setups, I generally just run and stealth speed kill. Any bloody or instigating lever with adrenal reaction and some minor dmg perks will generally one or two shot anything in the head. 
---
Also, kill super mutant locations for best xp
---
You know this is not a bug but a passive aggressive move by the devs ... all so Todd can get that 1 cap from you when you fast travel to the bunker to not die from rads.. it's his way t-baging you... do rads cause paranoia?
---
Idk mang was thinking the same thing today, like how long is it still gonna b in beta.... I try not to think abt it too much or else i am tempted to critique this game mode on so many levels. *Is it rly that hard to expand the pvp in this game?*
---
I had a thought also earlier why maybe they dont cross over pve adventure characters into the nw mode... Cuz they know it isn't balanced, or ppl will run bloodied everywhere and see just how unbalanced it is. Idk, still would just like to see that crossover anyway, instead of two lvl 30s trying to pick fights with me at the rusty dick
---
&gt; The new instanced interiors should be buildable dungeon vaults. Which essentially means being able to CREATE MOB SPAWNS.
---
Baby steps. Let's see how instanced CAMP interiors launch first.
---
Also, that's so easily abusable. People already make trap camps with the stuff out currently.
---
I doubt they'll do this donating style community event again. Nest to no one want to donate and the community at large has decided that the BoS rewards are shit. Mostly because everyone will get them thus why should they donate their junk.
---
If a whitesprings community event happened, they'd likely to make it something like kill x million ghouls.
---
I'm going for the 5mm and using it but thanks
---
but I'm on gauss shotgun so don't need too many
---
Yes TO KRISPY 4 U
---
It‚Äôs spec gear and consumable base.  A lvl 50 in theory can wreck a poorly geared level 1500
---
We‚Äôre almost halfway through the concrete challenge and at less than 4% complete so I don‚Äôt like our odds.
---
After lvl 50 leveling up just gives you more perks.  Lvl 500 has just put in more time and is more likely to have higher end gear that gives them more hp, defense, power etc.  Lvl 100 can still win depending on the  playstyles of the two.
