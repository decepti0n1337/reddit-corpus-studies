Do the excavator Armor quest
---
---
---
That’s fallout baby! If you keep playing launching a nuke will be like a walk in the park.
---
Omg! I play with my husband and dad too! Lol I've had this idea for a long time. But I figured it would be too hard to implement.  It would be awesome though. Basically all we do in the game anymore is build stuff. Lol right now I'm building a Christmas village.  :)
---
People downvoting what would likely happen
---
I feel like this is a troll post, but could you imagine?  SBQ with five different power armors screaming at each other with American and Chinese nationalist nonsense and a sixth endlessly looping a clownhorror jingle.  I wouldn’t be able to stand it.
---

---
I hope they chill out with the talking armor, unlikely because it’s obviously popular, or give innocent bystanders an option to mute it.
---
Hopefully for free
---
I'd buy it instantly.
---
Perfect retort to someone giving me thumbs down / throw up emote for having FO 1st
---
You mean Idiocracy? Or does it have another name in other regions? I'm in the US.
---
I’ve found out that starting a new character has fixed my achievements
---
Block people on your friends list for the session.
---
I always have a high-level creature spawn in the garden area near the gazebo.  I've had the following spawn there: glowing deathclaw, grafton monster, honey beast, glowing deathskull radscorpion, glowing wolf, glowing Yao Guai.
---
Tenderizer is broken, and has been for a while btw. Change that perk ASAP
---
Your opinion gets downvoted
---
I'd wear it
---
***Expert Mode***
---
Any pics?
---
I did and when I loaded up my last save today I lost the blueprints and it won't let me craft it but I do have 3 of the pieces left.
---
yeah I know your feeling just wanted to mention that there's atleast a way to 'fix' the bars other than waiting for stuff to get destroyed
---
though I would appreciate if Bethesda gave us an option to simply repair damaged parts or as you suggested abolishes the camp damage system after all (except turrets)
---
This is how I assumed the camp system worked before i played.
---
is nearly impossible
---
That’s a funny picture, in fact the only times someone could kill the queen before i got there was because of some melee dudes with meat hooks. I’ve seen players using explosive gat plasma but it was impossible to tell what the prefix was. Could be a stalkers explosive or something else.
---
Brilliant!!! Call it the “Team Build” option. All other team members would have to agree to participate, but when they do, the compound would gain 1/4 build space from a solo CAMP, for a total of 2X the build space for a team of 4. It would be awesome! And the server wouldn’t be as taxed. A win win for all!
---
I did my first nuke launch last night right by my camp and run into it to get the trophy.
---
we had many of those convenience mods since weeks after launch....still Bethesda unable to provide them one year after launch
---
Lol who sells them for 300-1000? I'll up them all they sell for 30k plus it's as rare as the red nurse..
---
I noticed my turrets and water purifiers heal themselves. Now I’d they’d just apply that to everything.... :)
---
You shouldn't have random people on your friends list. It's intended for friends lol
---
Each player keeps their stash of 800, and scrap boxes would be personal too.
---
Really? wow I’d grab it for sure if I bump into another one. The prices I’ve seen definitely aren’t that crazy.
---
So you've never looked at scorched through a scope?
---
What did the sun mask look like?
---
Isn't the Marine armor helmet not supposed to exist in normal play? Weren't they taken from the Dev room?
---
Pc has access to it by unauthorized actions. Not because Bethesda allowed all users to loot it.
---
Yes but PC is allowed to keep it caused it Supposidly exists in the world
---
They’re cut from the game, so I don’t think you’ve ever seen a live one.
---
But maybe we should still get it in the game.
---
&gt; that's the idea of expert, not just in washout but across all 3 missions. expert is not made to be an easy walk in the park.
---
who said i wanted it to be a walk in the park?
---
i want it to stop being a fucking rng clown fiesta rng for the error codes rng for the hacking at the seed banks rng for the fucking pump codes
---
the main problem is the rng clown fiesta and the delay doesn't help
---
We’re far more likely to get this as a Fallout 1st “feature” (re; something that should be in the *actual base game*) than for it to be included in the game for free.
---
Definitely needs to happen
---
It IS in the game. If you manage to find the new  location of the devroom, it's yours. But you'll also be banned for accessing it in its new location.
---
&gt;rng for the fucking pump codes
---
if only there was a map that i mentioned in my last comment that is in a certain 2 man raid guide that was posted to this sub, that shows all possible spawnpoints of the codes.
---
&gt; rng for the error codes
---
error codes are the easy part, the game literally tells you what to do, in and out sub 2 min
---
&gt;rng for the hacking
---
have you never hacked a terminal in a fallout game before, like ever?
---
[removed]
---
Just shows that having money and playing a game doesn't mean you don't enjoy literal shit.
---
That means rocket launchers and fat men not an explosive legendary effect
---
Yes it does. It just means heavy guns that aren’t the grenade launchers fat man or missile launcher
---
Okay thank you, I didn’t know if it counted as a explosive heavy weapon
---
You mean the whole game...lol
---
&gt; if only there was a map that i mentioned in my last comment that is in a certain 2 man raid guide that was posted to this sub, that shows all possible spawnpoints of the codes.
---
there are a LOT of spawn points for all the codes
---
i use the map and we mostly know where to look for each code but its still stupid that sometimes i can find both beta and gamma in 10 seconds and otherwise it takes me forever to find them
---
&gt;error codes are the easy part, the game literally tells you what to do, in and out sub 2 min
---
yeah great except the error codes are randomized so you have to check what they mean every time 
---
&gt;have you never hacked a terminal in a fallout game before, like ever?
---
yeah i hacked one before its time consuming and rng based
---
How do you get the imposter event?
---
It’s a limited pool of RNG and you can prepare accordingly. Focus your energy on improving your tactics instead of lamenting your failures.
---
Specially if they open their hand when they are done...Signifying the load went everywhere
---
No shit? I swear I saw a hooker down in Flatwoods
---
You can't take items from the dev room anymore even if you enter its cell.
---
Power armor, like enemies, spawns in at your level if you are the first player to come through. You can change servers if it's too high a level until you get a set at your own level. If you have fallout 1st it will help.
---
I managed to find one there but he got killed by super mutants before I could do anything. So sad...
---
Yeah, I love my AAE .50 cal. So much fun!
---
Another thing is that some legendaries seem to just disappear. And the whole 3 star legendary 1 star equipment is a problem too.
---
4-star enemy?  
---
I’m doubtful.
---
It would most likely be too OP, and would probably ruin the game. The current system is fine, and it actually makes you work to change your character.
---
3 and New Vegas had it for plain Nuka Cola, 4 expanded it to allow chilling the various flavors.
---
In fallout 3 there was a piece of furniture that you could buy for your home that turned the drinks cold
---
And you got any pics of the President suit?
---
I was farming Charleston building and it was certainly a 4* Ghoul.
---
"Fuck this guy in particular" -The RNG probably
---
On the bright side, the Helmets are still pretty damn valuable
---
Even as both a F1st member and the author of a related post a few months ago (T.E.N.T.), I have to disagree. That would create too much of a gap between the standard player and F1st for my comfort. 
---
If they made the standard version (even if it didn’t have a Scrapbox) free via a quest line to everyone, and then added just a scrap weapons/armor function to the Scrapbox (not an actual station; no gear repairs/mods), I would support that.

Didn't realize this was such a rare thing.. I was just picking off ghouls in Charleston building and this one came running around the corner. If I would've known it was a sight to see I would've uploaded it to my YouTube channel for the clicks.
---
Have you tried nuka-cola grape? Not only will it take away some rads (not as many as radaway) it also doesn’t spoil, and it’s grapelicious
---
I haven't found the travelling one yet, but I got the leather coat from someone's vendor for 2500. I didn't realize how much people buy it for, and I almost didn't get it.
---
I’m on PS4, I didn’t pay too much attention to clothing until recently. The price is literally all over the place. The pink nurse dress my toon is wearing was found in a vending machine for 50 caps, then i also saw it in others camps for 5000.
---
With the current structure of the game I dont see how this could be without essentially holding 4 slots for the players in the event one logs in. Meaning you'd take up your own spot and three more for your teammates on any server you joined. With the limited numbers of players per world I don't see this becoming a thing. 
---
That said, it is a good idea.
---
Sure there isnt some kind of bug? I def did plenty of damage.
---
*&lt;articulates arms wildly&gt;*
---
*Item duplication, man.*
---
Hmm I guess that could be. But damn it looked like a 4 star. Regardless I'm pissed I got 1 star melee junk for my rifleman.
---
Wut, I did it solo at level 45. It's tedious, but doable.
---
What build did you use?
---
i added you
---
Oh, yeah, no doubt the 1* drop sucked. I feel your pain man, happens all the time. It's especially irritating when it's some bullet spongy thing like a sheepsquatch and you get 1* crap after all that ammo fired.
---
I will give you a good weapon. Let me know when you are on.
---
Yeah this is why I wanted my 1 year sub refunded. Also, I could put that £99 into buying new games.
---
76 has gone on the backburner for me until they get new content and quests.
---
If you have any duplicates I’ll buy one off you for a few K caps.
---
Yeah I know how it goes. Was just hopeful for something amazing with that kill.
---
That’s it? Wow 😯
---
Someone got lucky. Assuming it’s the white helmet.
---
Did you just say you wanted the coat for 300 caps? Its worth thousands
---
I'm on now, but I don't really have anything I can give you in return.
---
These are free what’s your gamer tag
---
Ah wasn’t able to add you. 
---
Handle here is same as ign
---
How do you grind for it?
---
I’ll buy some, I only have like 2 total stimpaks...
---
If you want the Helmet you grind leader of the pack event that's where I got the Helmet 3 times
---
Call me a purist but that’s all I drink
---
Instanced, I think it would be good if some camp elements took up a different world space. Made a similar suggestion to the game about craftable bunkers in the Camp, where you just would drop a concrete bunker in your camp and once out of camp mode, the bunker would open into a separate craftable instance area. Just my opinion.
---
Thanks!
---
I do, but I don’t have one.
---
If the meshes and textures are in the files then I'll post them here tomorrow.
---
Add me
---
Then if you want to get the outfit for I think it's fly swatter
---
No problem
---
I hardly ever see that event trigger. :(
---
Rule 10 in 3...2...1...
---
Just when I think there is no one brave enough to make a post that can rival most of the for sale ads on Craigslist, here you are.  Bravo good man.
---
As a Nuka grenade user I endorse this message.
---
Same to can also just grind any event in the forest and or toxic valley to try and get the outfit leader of the pack is u think only for the Helmet i think because I've gotten it 3 times from that event.
---
PC or console? Also how much you looking for??

---
That build is a guide to give you direction. As you progress in the game and come into your own play style definitely mix it up into what works best for you. Most importantly, have fun
---
I really hope so. It was a blast!
---
Thanks again. You're a life saver. ❤
---
Caps were still backed by water in the original Fallouts. But bottle caps wouldn't make much sense because there weren't any water merchants, no clean water source in the area anyway. So Appalachia is only this way because of the Whitesprings promotion in the lore. If the only clean place in the wasteland only took bottlecaps, everyone would switch to that system pretty quick
---
Way back when, there was some data mining of the Presidential assets.  Information from back then along with Dev comments indicated it was a planned PVP event focusing on all the Election Terminals, allowing the winner to rig the vote and become President for a term.  The President got the executive suite, new PA skins, and the Gauss rifle.
---
Interesting. I'll keep my eyes peeled for more.
---
No problem. As you set your perk cards those weapons will become more powerful for you
---
The events in 76 happen way before any water merchants even started back in California
---
Getting one mask (let alone all 4) is literally almost impossible given the drop rate was so low.  I've never seen anyone in game with the Jester mask, but this guy (and his friend on the same swrver) have all four. Yes, my mind went to cheating immediately and as per everyones comments here for good reason. 
---
I'm not starting a witch hunt, of course I didn't show their names.
---
Right but the Whitesprings promotional event only happened in WV in the lore. The cap was still backed by water merchants in the grand scheme of the lore. They didn't have to retcon that
---
You can complete it with three codes.
---
At the beginning expert looks borderline impossible but it's just a matter of coordinating the roles and memorize the runs.
---
Well that's my fucking answer
---
The one thing I don’t have... :(
---
&gt;If there are repairmen like in 3/NV they could repair to 200%.
---
I ain't about to pay 5k caps to repair my armor to full condition. I promise you the prices woukd be ludicrously expensive.
---
I had this happen quite a bit , I’ve found when people clear out and the game has less to process that it will then let you respawn , super annoying when all you want to do is get back in the fight
---
They rare masks had like a 0.03% drop rate, and immediately after Fasnacht ended there were less than 5 players who got a rare mask. It's impossible for this guy and his friend to have gotten all four legit.
---
My friend u gave me a leg at flatwoods thanx
---
One of my first characters was a melee build, had a one star furious grognaks axe from way back, my first level 50. Just got a 3star AntiArmor/swingspeed/one other i forget shishkabob and i feel like its gonna be so much butter i mean better
---
Are you sure your not confusing it for the Hunter Long Coat ([Roaming Responder Vendor Bot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26mx2DsjuV0)) or the Drifter Outfit (not rare)
---
If you ever accidentally scrap any of that armor before it’s replaced which can happen easily reach out to me I will remake it for you
---
If you’re on Xbox I may have ran to your house today a few minutes before a nuke went off there. I died by the shed trying to escape lol
---
Yeah I’m wearing the hunters long coat now, earlier in this thread the OP said he saw the Leather coat and some buddies vendor multiple times between 300 and 1000 caps. That’s what I was talking about, scroll up to previous comments
---
Yes. From the corpse itself
---
I'll let you know. So far it's seriously good. I'm not quite as tanky as with the T-60, so I'll have to make some play style changes to avoid being crushed.
---
I have one patrolling my base in Flatwoods :)
---
  
---
Hugs only though.
---
This i agree with. or, at least, when we build the nuka cola existing "vending" machine, we should be able to add nuka cola to it.
---
yeah... she's always empty for me... but I get a legendary from the quest completion.
---
thats awesome! ive got to get that the pacify perk and get on to my camp too. does it take up a lot of the budget? 
---
also does it just find its way to your camp or?
---
I did that too on the nuclear one.  Two shot explosive killing everything before we can touch them.  Now if it was your every day horde with no loot.  I have no issues, but when people are there for loot.  Then it's no longer great.
---
Yeah
---
You realize that of they changed it to the enemies dropping the same star item as they are themselves, then we would see a lot fewer 2\* and 3\* enemies to keep the loot balance in the game. We would not get more good stuff, just fewer high star enemies.
---
Don't take your buyer's regret out on me. I just asked you a fucking question.
---
Not much budget from what I can tell. You can build to maximum budget and still tame successfully, so its not a huge issue.
---
When you tame, it'll have a tag change on mouse over showing owned by you, after which it will run to the "edge" of the local area (each fast travel point is a local area, per se), where they will idle until disappearing. At that point there's a time where you have to wait for it to show up. This can sometimes be hours, but sometimes a few minutes. I usually end up getting into a building binge so I don't notice the time too much.
---
Eventually it shows up at your base leashed to your CAMP module, so have that somewhere that they can walk around.
---
You xbox cuz if so I'm down for a run with you
---
That’s how it currently works. 
---
If you don’t have any friends, then it’s 100% private. 
---
Or yo can just appear ‘offline’ and then I don’t think they can join if you don’t show in their list.
---
Never seen it confirmed by actual controlled testing. Just heard anecdotal assumptions.
---
Shut up theyll charge us or tack it on to first :/
---
I’m sorry i didnt mean to say shut up but i just think that theyll either charge us for this or tack it on to fallout first:/
---
Sucks you have to take that step.
---
Anything else? Like a weapon or something?
---
I'm in the minority, but I love them (not meltdown so much though).
---
I find them to be a challenge, and encourage team work. They are not terribly difficult once you figure out what you're suppose to be doing. Though getting to that point can take a lot of trial and error unless you have someone with you who is willing to teach you
---
Or like another outfit?
---
Anything in particular?
---
I disagree, 2-3* enemies are still a rarity just not as rare as most items or enemies. If they were to reduce the chance to find 2-3* enemies that would be kind of stupid imo. Like I said 2-3* enemies are still a rather rare occurrence. If anything the community would get a little more excited to find 2-3* enemies because they would know they'd get a guaranteed 2-3* item. Plus, 2-3* weapons and armor aren't always good so making 2-3* even more rare would make the occurence less then exciting if they spent all that time hunting a 3*, to only get a  3*hunters walking cane.
---
Im looking for well rare outfits like the responder Fireman uniform or like a Traveling Leather Coat or leather coat or maybe a tattered field jacket.
---
The spiltter on an explosive for sure. And yes it dose function like it dose on a laser
---
If you got the agility I find Mr sandman/covert op a really overpowered combo. Your in the night as much as the day, I have a TSE Bolt Action Rifle I can get to well close to 2000 damage per shot at night. I haven't pulled it out in a while so not sure if they patched that little gem yet and its only reaching that because bolt action is broken but with sandman/covert your hitting for X3.75 on a sneak and it's nothing to be sniffed at imo. I don't think non automatic works well without sneak either, to slow for more then one or 2 enemies at a time.
---
I find them on robobrains pretty regularly.
---
I think a lot of players have their theories, but in practice, I'm pretty sure that Murmrgh's pool is truly random.  You might get a Bloodied, followed by 10 unwanted prefixes.
---
Full respec is something i’d enjoy, or they can level tier it, from levels 50-75 you grind out for 1 perk or point swap, then from 75-125 you can do two of each, assuming you are enabled by this to play and grind levels harder, then 125-200 3 of each and 200+ swap out five points and or pick whatever perks you havent taken or maxed out yet? And maybe you could bank those points and three levels later you are a completely different character?
---
I sometimes notice a higher frequency of prefixes legendary drops in the world at times, but never been consistent. IF that is accurate with drops, I've never noticed that to affect what the purveyor gives. I think when it happens, it's purely coincidental.
---
what I wrote applies to both, and Fallout 1st didn't exist at launch so it's basically a second atomic shop
---
Only rare outfits I have is 2 red asylum
---
Yeah ill take it if you want to trade for it
---
Sad for us. We've lost a once great developer to bankers and non-gamers.
---
I dont know if we'll ever see one like it again.
---
Responder Fireman Helmet for Red Asylum Worker Uniform
---
For delberts....the list is on his terminal in his home
---
Camp budgets will be increased for Fallout 1st members on private servers. They said this. 
---
Instanced camps sound good though.
---
Ooh. Savage Gabe.
---
I 100% guarantee you that this will be sold in the Atom Shop someday. Probably with Wastelanders.
---
That’s an uneven trade bud. Red asylum is worth more.
---
And then they created perks that serve as QOL enhancements, so they are an automatic drain on your build.
---
ooooh I promise you that respecs are coming, and they aren't going to be paid for with Caps.
---
Not sure if all those on the list are in game recipes....I am still gathering recipes , lol. Stay filthy!
---
I'm nearly convinced that the only people that really get any enjoyment out of the game are hacking and exploiting trolls. Especially on PC.
---
I agree and disagree. With the current way things are, having Legendaries with different numbers of stars seems kinda pointless. I think if you are gonna have a system of 1-3 stars, then they should drop a legendary that corresponds to it. However, I don't know if it's a real challenge killing a 3 * as opposed to a 1 *. It's not like it takes more resources or time to kill. I think they should scale the difficulty with more stars and then it would be worth it.
---
Cool. I’ll hop on 76 more often now 👍🏾
---
I can get behind that! More challenge the higher star it is. I just want a 3* item to drop from a 3* enemy. If I gotta put more bullets into the sucker that's a higher star to get that item I'm all for it as long as I get the item "advertised" i guess? Lol
---
The game has cultivated a pretty friendly and productive playerbase. Let's *not* tempt fate...
---
Lol exactly. I am torn when I get a 1* from a 3* because it's so disappointing but then I don't feel like I did anything special to earn a 3*
---
Youre gonna pay anywhere from 5k to 20k in caps just the heads up
---
Thank you for the heads up
---
Oddly enough, being on a game’s specific subbreddit just to throw shade comes off as petty. Weird.
---
Vim&gt; sunset sarsaparilla
---
The queen and sometimes a legendary deathclaw spawns in the abandoned waste dump where Blackwell was hiding out. They pack a bit more of a punch than a normal deathclaw but still not as scary as the ones in FO4.
---
I agree. I want a challenge in order to get that 3* item. Gives me some motive to hunt the bastards
---
You said it yourself. You wasted levels on all sorts of stupid perks. That's a personal problem. I've played since beta, and my build wasn't all that different from 50 till now. I've made a fair bit of tweaks to optimize, but it was plenty serviceable.
---
You don't need to grind for 10+ hours. Play and make changes organically. While you're at it, stop blaming the game for your poor choices.
---
I like to get my health down to a sliver..unyielding pieces..eat a luck adding good..and do three teabags before i enter the trade menu..  When it works i blame that. When i get absolute shit i always say..ah shoulda done an extra teabag.
---
Yes, it does. Which is why I’m glad they are implementing a fix for this. 
---
And to be honest, it’s not really a big deal if a random friend joins in.
---
They're drops from area bosses, enemies with a crown next to their name. One Violent Night spawns them constantly, one with each mob.
---
Seems foolproof to me lmao. Will have to try that next time. Is it copyrighted?
---
i'm playing the drums and some guy runs outside and waits by the spawn point to kill all the ghouls and the wendingo. i stopped doing this event altogether.
---
Don't play those instruments, fella. The best teamwork is when everyone understands what to do to maximize rewards. For that one it means taking as much time as possible. For most everything else, please don't one shot the legendaries. Everyone wins.
---
I encourage a routine..kinda like shooting a freethrow..if it wotks out..your routine is good luck. If it doesnt..it gives you somethin to try different next time. Idk. I went 4 days ago with like 600 scrip..got 4 good ass weapons in a row..then everyday after that its been poop mcscoop.
---
Honestly though..im like 98% sure its random as balls..im leavin wiggle room there incase someone cracks the code..that way you cant say i lied lol
---
Today my partner scripted and got two explosives back to back with no bash damage and on appropriate weapons. We normally hop around but decided to stick it out as we also heard this theory. We visited West Tek, General Steakhouse and Robco, each had a legendary, we both got 2 or 3 star drops at each of these places, nothing amazing mostly armor. Every daily gave us a bonus legendary. We did Heart of The Swamp and the Leather Coat (no backpack) dropped for me. I had a really nice furious Grognacks 3* drop from a horde event though only level 20. We had someone come in and do 3 queen's and one of them dropped the ultracite emergency protocols for him.
---
I think it may be placebo - it feels luckier, so it must be, right? But it's working for now and spices it up a little when you think the odds are in your favour.
---
&gt;I think this is a good idea, and could be added as a private world feature, or as a clan/pack/guild/gang expansion, but I don’t know how it would work logistically if the camp wasn’t persistent in the world, kinda like a workshop.  I don’t work on the game, I just play it.  
---
It could just be a regular camp with a regular budget that is persistent across 4 players. 2/4 of the people I used to play with only built basic camps because they had to and for the most part all four of us used mine.
---
Some might consider it activism since I'm protesting a once beloved game studio who has sunk so low that now the only people who play their games are easily impressed schmucks who don't mind buying a physical copy and the disc being cardboard with a download code, among other things.
---
Come on Frank. You're going to get to the point where standard is a breeze. Much like AA, it gets better
---
What the hell
---
You'll be able to put the next one you naturally find in the world into the wall as normal. Buying from vendors doesn't work, you need to get it from the appropriate containers.
---
FO76 is not a game for the light of heart.  It has serious issues/glitches, and the story-line from an adventure standpoint is meh.  If you really enjoyed FO4, more especially the independent crafting aspect where you can level as much as you want, FO76 will be a success for you.
---
I've deleted the game multiple times and restarted out of frustration for my character and inability to fight off enemies.  There is much more to FO76 under the hood.  YouTubers such as CaotainOob,; sites such as nukes and dragons/fallout builds show that the gem of FO76 comes after you peel back the onion.  You need to get past the hype and dig in if you are going to get the most out of it.  If you are looking for game but only willing to dig surface deep, FO76 will disappoint.

Wrong &lt;  friend

One time when I was at the Grafton Dam, there were like 4 or 5 Mad Dog Malones that I could kill. He's multiplying!
---
yikes
---
Does the syringer ever have a level? The level section is missing on mine.
---
I've modded mine with bleedout that is fun to use with delay.
---
I forgot that, will do, thanks.
---
my go to weapon with friendly fire... people or bots or friendly creatures need a top up? hit it with it a few times! 40% swing speed? yep hit quick more health less downtime! tired of those bots in the vault raid crawling loosing you 30 40+ seconds? you got it! hit the shit outa them until you slap that plating back onto them! 
---
no one seems to understand that this weapon is great for a support build with friendly fire! chainsaw dosnt work with fire upgrade and i dont think the flaming pitchfork does either. the shishlabab is an undersung hero of the friendly fire support build. if you play with friendly fire you MUST pick one of these up. save on fuel and hit people (even if youre in pacifist)
---
Interesting, thanks for the advice.
---
You meant can't\* I'm guessing, and that's true.
---
Best if furious n explosive. My two shots aint good enuff
---
Keeping it 1000%. 20 seconds into a terminal is really... unfortunate
---
It's playable. That's about as nice as I can put it. If you are a diehard fan, and don't mind an overly monetized game that is bug ridden, and crashes at literally the worst times, then you may enjoy it. I have trouble keeping interested in it now unless I'm playing with friends, but that's mainly because I've been playing since launch, and am burnt out. There is supposed to be a major update......soon? Eventually? That will add more shit to do. It's not the worst game of 2019, but it's nothing compared to literally any other Fallout game.
---
Caps for scrip seems an obvious fix to be honest, I wonder if they are even thinking about that one.
---
LOL, not been playing since launch but true, I don't do many challenges for the Atoms, I'm a bit lazy 😎
---
Again the substation just north of Watoga. On PS4 it still spawns. Setup your camp just outside the station and point all your turrets at it. Just tag it before the turrets clean it up and just keep hopping servers. I'd say bout 1 in 10 is legendary and you get to see the variants.  The chameleon deathclaw are pretty badass.

Pouring one out for you homie
---
Try doing Encryptid naked, sometimes you get better results on Murmur. Sometimes.
---
Serums for 1400 caps ?! They are high As F and need to share
---
They are all over on PC right now. I legitimately bought mine from an outfit trader for 20k a piece.
---
I ran it all solo too
---
its not really a daily.  Its more like a repeatable,
---
It activates every time you loot a NEW piece of tech data when the quest is not active,  If you loot multiple pieces before you turn in the original (the one that activated the quest), the other pieces do not count, adn cannot be turned in.  Drop them or sell the to a bot vendor,
---
The one that will be acceptd is marked with a diamond,  get rid of the rest
---
The last mass dupe wave did what they wanted it to, it crashed the market for these things, which is objectively not bad. Not when people are charging irl money for this shit.
---
bos vendor has it if you wanna purchase em
---
That 4 star legendary might have been the one that killed Epstein.
---
Where is that?
---
My camp is at the substation just north of Watoga. A deathclaw spaens in with every player who visits, up to 6 times an hour I've observed. About 1/20 are legendary, one star.
---
there is one in whitesprings shops, and one in watoga at the superduper mart
---
I have a Furious Explosive Minigun for the big battles like the Queen. Anti-Armor is plenty good for my daily runs.
---
Thanks
---
Vote with your caps. As in, don’t buy anything from them.
---
Not sure I still sell ammo for 1cap &amp; serums for 275caps &amp; it makes me enough caps.
---
I am seeing more lower levels &amp; they normally sell for ridiculous prices.
---
Yah. I m still seeking the better weapon for my secondary weapon. My first character is souped up already
---
I’ll pour two out.
---
Honestly haven’t successfully launched one yet bc of shit like that.
---
It does it to mine as well dives me nuts so now i don't have any defenses at my camp which is fine i live in the forest..
---
Just remember, a duo completed this week’s mission along with every other on expert. You can’t blame RNG.
---
No wifi until tomorrow. But I day yes to that.
---
Yea. My serums and still at 250. And whatever ammo besides ultracite is 1 cap, but I may be the minority.....lol
---
i enjoy them (also minority) as is. (rewards/challenge/grind)
---
 the one thing i would do is fix dicso's/ give a reconnect timer of some sort.  it really sucks to make it near the end room for one person to crash out.
---
Oh i didnt not a thing.
---
Come see me anytime.
---
Oh these were all high levels like high 300 and above
---
I’m in the forest and I have spawns who will attack. Mostly mongrels and super mutants. So I need defenses. But I’m glad I’m camped there.
---
yeah for sure, just send me a message on psn whenever you wanna play
---
I've played since March/April and I've put like 900 hours into the game. It is still buggy, let me say that first and foremost, but it's leagues on from where it was. I actually crashed today for the first time in what feels like forever.
---
I think the quests are weak, and the dailies repetitive but I love the map, I love the areas on the map and I like the variation of enemies
---
The trading and community are what sell it for me. There are little ecosystems going on and you don't even know it. 
---
The guy you buy ammo from? Turns out he has 5 little grinders working under him for what sounds like an in game wage.
---
That guy with the serums, knows a guy who knows a guy, who has that one piece of armor you've been looking for BUT that guy only wants apparel, it's all cool though, the guy you sell your weapons to know also knows a guy who has that one piece of apparel the other guy wants and before you know it everyone has something and you are sitting around feel like your in Oceans 12 and what you did was practically day light robbery the bargain you just got.
---
The community itself is second to none I think. We have alot of negativity and I get it the frustration people have with the game but those in game on the server will and do help, when you go down fighting that mutant on your own chances are if someone is around they will revive you, they'll help you take that mutant out and they'll give you a thumbs up and wave as they go off into the sunset.
---
I have 1st. It's a bonus and I think the scrapbox should be for everyone once you get it you feel like you can't go without it and I dunno it feels like it should just be a part of the base game. I wouldn't event feel like 1st was losing something if they gave it away free anyway. I will say when I didn't have the box I spent most of my game managing my weight, when I got 1st it took that element away and now I have much more fun just farming legendaries and getting xp.
---
If you like socialising with people and rng I'd honestly say buy it. I haven't looked back even through all the ups and downs I've witnessed.
---
The worst bugs for me are the 'floor ghouls', VATS exiting even though enemy is alive, in view and you still have ap, exiting a bench and it automatically puts you back into it and whatever the issue is with staggering at the minute. I get stuck in a staggering loop until I die if I get staggered once. Not everytime I'm staggered I'll just add but I've died twice since the last update from it. Thankfully I'm not afflicted by disappearing bodies or blowing bodies through the map though I know that is a major issue for people.
---
Also in terms of locations there are so many hidden gems, I don't want to give any away just incase but I assure there are alot of little touches and locations not marked that are just interesting and different to look at. Actually just a teeny tiny one, random safe in small lake, swim to safe, safe full of ultimate apocalyptic necessity: toilet roll. This one has always stuck with me, I feel like we'd miss toilet roll more then we'd know in the wasteland.
---
This was long so probably quicker to have looked at those videos 😅.
---
for sure, just send me a psn message whenever you want to play if i’m not playing 76 and i’ll hop on
---
Ultracite ammo should be more because of the ultracite but i wouldnt think more than 2 or 3 caps, maybe im wrong
---
I think it starts by reading a poster. There should be a walkthrough available somewhere, but I don’t remember.
---
Hope it helps!
---
Yeesh! I've had 20k 556 in my vendor for the last 3 days and sold only 6k 1 for 1. I usually trade always in 556 and was starting to worry the market was taking a down turn. On a normal day I'd easily trade through 40k or so to see 20k just sitting been selling in 500s was worrying. Maybe I shouldn't with those prices 😅.
---
Lay off the nukashine 😉
---
It can't just be on private servers, what happens when you roll back to adventure with your over budget camp?
---
Teabags?
---
I yea anything with colbat or violet I charge 3 and the more available flux is 2. Do not sell much but that is my pricing when I do.
---
I would love the opportunity to have an underground bunker camp that was instanced.
---
With the right people, this event means 1300 caps in meds and drugs, five legendary items and tons of xp. But when I see a level 452 wielding a dcg and low energy, I know it's time to load the bloodied lever action to show him what one-shooting means. 
---
Most of the time, people do the right thing. Two 10mm rounds to the leg is enough.
---
I heard about this, and didn’t believe it until it happened to me. They were shooting a mole rat and after it was dead they started shooting every which way, I thought there was something else but then remembered hearing about the gitch
---
Is Wastelanders still not out? Jesus.
---
My turrets were shooting my scrapbot today.
---
If and when they do this it will go to Fallout1st memebers
---
I still play almost every day since launch. So I remember from when it was really bad, to actually really fun, to kinda mediocre. It's a roller coaster but I know the game will continue adding content and so I'm actually pretty happy with my purchase
---
great info thanks!!!
---
Their turn off names option doesn't even work, lets fix that first.
---
Only if they bring back the old pacifist mode.
---
Purveyour is that.

$24 is cheap dude. I got it when it was $80 (I'm from Canada) I don't regret the money I spent on it cause I love it. So for $24 it's absolutely worth it
---
I wouldnt bother a drop of a random non legendary weapon from the list of weapons I still need to break to learn something.
---
After learning all mods for a certain weapon, it could stop drop from quest reward, replaced by food/meds or caps.
---
That should be better.
---
Yea nut dunks
---
You can craft nuka dark already
---
Ok, not sure then
---
You can craft nuka dark?
---
I carry a Furious FFR Vats 10mm Pistol as my sidearm for clearing out low levels.
---
It was delayed to the next quarter but they gave some teaser images this week
---
3 screens? Dude that's some serious hardware.
---
I have the vegetarian mutation and I survive with soup, only soup for hungry and thirst - it's a great combination.
---
Thank you Mr West Tek skelletal
---
Some people just sell for ridiculous prices. Found someone the other day selling 50 plans I didn’t have (I have most plans in the game by now, so these were either expensive/rare) for 9 caps per plan. They also had some good unyielding armor I made 6k profit per piece, so people who have good deals are still out there. Sometimes you just gotta go on a bargain hunt
---
I honestly wouldn't mind. I don't like wasting ammo in a 3* and get rewarded with a 1* item.
---
I still hate that guy for ruining my perfectly preserved pie market.
---
The one in the Emmett Mountain Disposal is almost always legendary when I come across it.
---
I really liked my affrfr assault rifle but then i got an aa50 fixer and vats is a big part of my sneaky sniper build so that’s my new favorite. Besides that combat rifles r cool
---
I have a similar issue (xBox)
---
If I start the game, no headset, no issues.  
---
If I start the game, no headset, plug in headset, no issues.
---
If I start the game with headset, no issues.
---
If at anytime, I have my headset plugged in and then I unplug my headset, there is a roughly 50/50 chance my TV sound gets messed up as if it can go back from the surround sound in  my headphones to the basic TV speakers and screws up the channels.  My headset has surround sound, my TV does not.
---
Two solutions: Restart FO76, or plug in headset again and just use it.
---
That being said, maybe your headphones are better than your TV and you have a similar problem to me.
---
You want a The Fixer, a bloodied one. After there's Handmades or Lever Actions. Hunting Rifles are kinda meh, they're THE sniper rifle but the reloading action makes it a poor choice on a game that has you kill many enemies as quickly as possible.
---
This. This is what needs to happen.
---
AA50?
---
Anti armor with 50% extra vats critical damage. Super fun! Plus the fixer doesn’t use much ap per shot in vats anyways so I build up to that critical shot easily
---
Lol thats what i was doing the last couple of days and ran in to those vendors. I normally find good deals with higher level players but that threw me for a loop.
---
The only thing that's different is the NPCs are replaced with actual people, did you not interact with NPCs and join factions in other fallout games?
---
I wish hunting rifles has something to make up for the reload speed, because it used to be my strongest weapon, as I was going for a Vault Survivalist, wearing minimal armor and avoid using anything that isn’t leather and heavy. That was until the lever action rifle I had could then do more damage and had a faster reloading speed, making my hunting rifle useless. I love the hunting rifle but hate how long it takes to reload.
---
Forced Exponential Virus
---
The game simply needs to go back to 4's Survival difficulty combat, you DIE there from things that are simply a scratch in here, it puts caution and fear on the player, making every decision count unlike this place where everything is a teddy bear.
---
Prices have seemed to be getting higher. I try to keep my items at decent price to move inventory.
---
Zing!
---
Yea, I’m on Xbox. Waveface Wes 
---
I don’t have a mic tho, sorry!
---
I remember seeing some level 900 guy wear it months back
---
Thanks. I’m aware of what teabagging is in the regular world. 
---
I’m sorry but I’m a very literal person (mild autism) and I was thinking it had something to do with the game. Woosh on me, I suppose.
---
I wish a “realism” mode was in the game, where mutations would be more subtle and potentially more negative than positive, enemy’s were more deadly but so were you, just not to the extent that most players are now were they literally one shot anything and everything. Make encounters more risky like you said, maybe add a temperature system or something like in Skyrim. Just make the game more immersive, you know?
---
Pretty sure when crafting, it prioritizes stash over scrap box. It sucks.
---
Hahaha i definately dont recommend real world teabagging to better the odds of the pureveyor..however..im not saying that it deginately wont work.  Further testing is needed
---
Hopefully the third times a charm, I’ve had to type this message 3 times from my Reddit crashing. You probably mistook these two masks, because they’re similar, especially if you’re colorblind.
---

---
S’all good!
---
I play with my dad, I would love if we could build a camp together.
---
Yes... happens regularly on PC
---
:( can’t sleep... grabbed me some pajamas went to sleep at neighbor’s camp
---
No I am confident it was the sun mask, although it was probably hacked in
---
Is it really iconic though?  When people think of Fallout, the Shiskebob isn't what tends to come to mind.
---
Then immediately i’ll have everything i ever need 😂
---
Those are pretty rare to find to be honest. I am a deathclaw Hunter and I like to do regular runs around the mire region to find all the deathclaw so I can find. If you want to go deathclaw hunting, go to the top of the red rocket Mountain. That there is a guaranteed deathclaw spawn just like deathclaw Island spawn. After that Head East Far East all the way to that small little Shack towards the end of the east side of the mire. It will be east of the honey bee spawn. Occasionally I deathclaw will spawn west of gulper swamp. Then head down south to the big maw because that will be your new reference point. A little bit north of that until the West we going to come across with looks like a tree house but it is not there is usually two to three wendigo spawns that spawn directly on there on the trees so watch out. So kill those real quick but to the west of that tree house that's not marked on the map you'll find a porta potty and there's usually a fight going on there sometimes I deathclaw does spawn there or sheep squash or even other things too because it is a random location. After that go ahead and pay the caps and go directly to the abandoned waste dump and kill the two there. Then go ahead and fast travel to tenagra town and you will occasionally find one or two deathclaws there. Go ahead and head south of that 2 the robco Research Center or whatever it is called and go a little bit south of that and you will find an albino creature usually an albino deathclaw. Oh yeah I almost forgot, that little radio station North of the robco back in the mire, you will find a big bus there hanging up on the tree if you go a little bit north of that on the road you'll find it a possible deathclaw as well being bought by usually super mutants or scorched. But the Thunder Mountain Power relay station down at the very far side in cranberry bog is usually where you'll find another high-end deathclaw. I make these runs regularly and usually come across quite a few. Claus. Oh yeah I almost forgot one last one. If you go just a little bit West of the purveyor you will have to travel up and over this little Hill and you will find a possible deathclaw spawn.
---
I’ve seen so many people asking for nerfs. Why would they make it easier?
---
Thanks :( I don't even know how it happened but it was gone after I did a stash cleanout so I'm assuming I was selling on auto pilot, like a moron :(
---
Don't know about consoles but I don't expect those weapons to go below 50k on pc, only if he's kind enough to accept caps that is
---
I feel like something is broken with the turrets. I've been leveling a new character, and will take one of the workshops near Flatwoods. I forget the name, but it's not the factory. Anyway, while defending it, between waves, all of the turrets will just go HAM on the scarecrow until the next wave starts. They even keep going once the event is done. Here I am, walking away from what sounds like a war, but it's just a lone scarecrow getting demolished.
---
A whole buck for lunch?
---
I have every kind of lever and an IE fixer, always choose the IE lever. Was testing a bloodied crossbow the other day though, without chems and food buffs or unyielding armor +2k headshots.
---
Have you tried checking the vendors on your server?
---
I noticed less people are nuking as well.
---
The chef is lookin beefy💪💪
---
Yes, I've searched high and low. No dice
---
would love to be able to accept ammo or caps
---
Damn :( shit luck. Maybe just keep an eye on player vendors and see if you can find one for cheap- sometimes people don’t know what they have and sell low.
---
Just people being greedy
---
Mouse and Gamepad at the same time. Best of both worlds.
---
I wish I could get this but every legendary I get is either a heavy weapon, pistol, or melee, even from the purveyor. I have a zealots .50 something receiver and it’s okay but out preformed by the Sole Survivor lever action I got.
---
I've seen serums lately as low as one hundred a piece in more than one vendor.
---
I rebuild every 5-10 logins or so lol
---
That’s me
---
😂
---
Hey you visited my camp the other day and said you liked it, I was going to say something but I couldn't find my mic. I have a berserker build and it is very challenging but quite fun alternative play style, though looking to mix it up a bit at lv 130. I'm going to take your suggestion into consideration. I don't use broken armor but I do want to try your charisma card combos. I already run Rev and savior and it does make a difference, I can only imagine the effect if you use all life saving. Another good combination to top off dodgy ap drain is cola nut and rejuvenated, you hot key a nuca whatever (I prefer cherry) to top off your thirst and you gain quite a hefty ap bonus while you stay well hydrated. You can stay well fed as well but it only provides an hp boost which can fluctuate and effect nerd rage and adrenal potential negatively, if you play that way.
---
Games an already unpopular game that stopped content updates for the rest of the year, activities are at an all time low
---
Well now what I see is a scrap kit, which I guess is not a repair kit. I bought whatever was on the page Bethesda sent me to in the Atomic Shop, they really send me to a page of scrap kits when the link clicked said buy REPAIR kits?
---
Flamer barrel. You're welcome.
---
I've got a better idea, report the scum &amp; get them banned
---
My camp is on a spawn point, sometimes even with a nest and a few dead brahmin. Only a few times so far, today it was a 3 star, damn good fight high level.
---
should git gud. on novice its way to easy
---
Try some unusual, themed or intricate builds that take quite some time to make.
---
I've made; hunters cabin on the top of a mountain, Alice in wonderland underground bar, Museum/Visitors Centre of Appalachia, Mothman Themed Escape Room/House, Waterfall Treehouse, Halloween Haunted House/Maze and now working on a Santa's workshop for Christmas.
---
i'm normaly a Bloody commando build, but yesterday i find a Bloody crits do 50% crits fills faster Huntinhrifle for 5k in a vendor and went out to Test it. did 3800 Damage per shoot on Ghouls and like 5k w. critical hits. I never got seen from any mob so no Problem w. reload speed.
---
That's right
---
It's more then one,  it's the couriers
---
Have no idea what kind of a player you are but why would anyone want to sell you dupe method for no reason? You been asking around for dupe methods havent you?
---
 wheres that at?
---
I have been playing since early release with 200 stash. Both my brother and I. I've never met anyone who's done a raid let alone has a full set of armor on xbox. I've been posting in the casuals discord and even lfg on xbox and no one ever responds to do the raids. Mind you I also dont think I've ever seen project paradise or encryptid successfully complete either.
---
It plays just fine. 
---
Saving grace and hidden gems -- a massive open world full of locations and secrets and around 70 hours plus of gameplay. Plus the CAMP building and trading is pretty fun. It's basically all about the camp for me -- building my home, getting new plans for it, moving it to a new location etc. That's kind of the good role-play aspect -- you're trying to carve out your own place in this hostile world.
---
Performance is fine for me. Sometimes stutters a bit, mostly doesn't. 
---
Only a few comfort-of-living features are behind the subscription, and not worth the money (in my opinion anyway).  
---
Plenty of cool and creepy areas.
---
It's a great game, one of my favorites from the past few years. Just really like the world and atmosphere and setting off in a direction to see what you'll find and what trouble you'll get into never really gets old.
---
I don’t think that’s dupe. But after the scratchbox bug Bethesda gave up to 600 V94 steel. How ever got that PA can probably craft it again 3 times over.
---
Do you have multiple characters? Check all your characters "misc" items.
---
I think they are put on whatever character you logged into last, or the character you were logged in to when purchased
---
Seems you bought the wrong kit. You can always ask for a refund but keep in mind you will be blacklisted if you do that too many times
---
Do they have exp or ffr?
---
Why have a siren if not to annoy people?
---
Just wanted to say thanks again to all who replied,  no ones saying just go watch videos. Had a pretty busy day but I’ll be reading these all in detail as soon as I’m home. 
---
So far from what I’ve seen it appears worth the current sale asking price of $25.
---
No there's a literally dupe according to a handful of couriers,  the scrap crate was just to get the glitch bankrolling the opinion
---
No, raids are my favorite part of every mmo, no reason to spoil my fun, I think it's wrong to charge that much for obvious reasons
---
Scorched drop them quite often if your level is high enough. I do not recommend crafting  combat rifles for mods since you'll get them all unlocked eventually. But for some rarer weapons like lever action or handmades, you gotta craft and scrap
---
No, because you haters and others griefers starts to attack us just because we used an emote or because we moved a tent for use and share with all other people.
---
&gt;it's just another temporary feature put in the game by Bethesda intentionally so they can put off fixing the vault raid but instead being capitalized off
---
Can you expand on this? I don't understand what you're trying to say.
---
Hey, stop giving Bethesda ideas of another "feature" to charge for.
---
Happens to people on all platforms. 
---
This is a long standing bug that still hasn't been fixed.
---
*piques.  And, in game company name?
---
The vault raid is hardly doable, but I've already gotten over a 100 vault steel but it's the majority opinion of my peers of couriers that instead of fixing all the problems in the Vault Raid just make the prize available by glitch &amp; nobody will care about raiding anymore releasing tension on Bethesda's end
---
Agreed. 
---
At more per month than most frigging MMORPG subscriptions, they at least need to add this feature.
---
If I wanted to annoy people, then I’d ask Bethesda for Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm Flailing Tube Man
---
I'm a diluted user...
---
I use mouse and gaming keypad (Logitech G13), with some keyboard on the side for typing.
---
Only other ammo that is not ultracite that is sold for 2 caps is the 5.56 at least for market price.
---
That is mighty incorrect
---
Purified water is not a bad quest reward IMO. I keep selling my extra for caps. I simply equip hard bargain rank3 perk + pop in a Grape Mentat. Daily quick trip to a bot vendor and sell a bunch of stuff including purified water...
---
M.O.D. Incorporate
---
M- masters
---
O- of 
---
D- disaster
---
Awesome thanks man :)
---
Bethesda won’t do shit
---
HAHA.
---
Bethesda should have a new system where players can claim a square from a plot of land that's collectively used. Call it T.O.W.N.
---
Is anything fixed?
---
use Covert Ops instead of adrenaline
---
Likewise.  Use the first aid perk and go with all diluted's, dont ever get down past half health usein em like candy.  And with all the excess purified water thirst isnt a big issue.
---
I don't hate Bethesda or Fallout, been a fan of Fallout since the first isometric games, been a fan of Bethesda since Morrowind. But they have not gotten better. They peaked with Skyrim, and have gone steadily downhill and we have arrived at this. Fallout 76. It is the epitome of Bethesda game design, make no mistake. I'm not sure who's really at fault either. Maybe Todd Howard? Or maybe Todd is being forced to sell us this bullshit by ZeniMax. Regardless of who's to blame, what's clear is that someone in BGS/ZeniMax is absolutely in love with profits &gt; quality. As you say, people are still playing it and what's more, Bethesda could give the game away for free and the Atom Shop will be where the profits lie. There are whales for every type of game like this, spending ridiculous amounts of money. It's a sad state of affairs for the game industry. I guess Rockstar and CDPR are the top dogs now.
---
I'm away from my Xbox till tomorrow afternoon, but I can let you know then. I believe the gatling gun is ffr.
---
Okay thanks
---
Loving it, but might be a little long to spell out via small letters. (my workshop budget is tight with having to make the entire headquarters)
---
We'll have to see if it works!
---
Why does a siren stay on but Beth can’t leave radios on?!?! Psssht!
---
Mine is in my garden, and everytime I fast travel home it's on.  I always tell myself that I will disconnect the wire.... Instead I click X to turn the lever off like 5 times until it finally loads in to letting me, then I never disconnect the wire.  Then I laugh and tell myself I earned that siren and it's gonna annoy people.
---
It wasn't great even upgraded. Even with a maxed out strength tree you could fo a lot better lmao. It looked tight though
---
I'm perfectly willing to pay a lot for it. In video games I may suck at everything else but I can accumulate money like no one's business.
---
vehicles would be a bad idea
---
Wait there’s only supposed to be one ? I’ve always had like 5 of them spawn
---
The mothman museum has multiple, here’s a few:

---
I meant “in game” but those are pretty sweet!
---
"Just Trash INC"
---
Oh hahaha I didn’t realize
---
Why? Lol I'd say atleast the Mini bikes. Maybe give them a slow enough speed to work well and maybe 3 engine mods to adjust speeds.
---
No one cares.
---
I would recommend using the abbreviation as it better on workshop budget
---
Are you still a tadpole?  It's OK; I won't judge you.  Even if you are the oldest Tadpole I've ever seen.
---
fallout 76's world wasn't made for vehicles. too many obstacles imo
---
Actually sonce the premise is based off the amout of time it would be the main part unless he is refering to pony and dragon
---
It just doesn't seem proper to use the abbreviation. But, either way, your idea won
---
I never used energy weapons much up until now, but got a Junkie's plasma the other day and chucked the flamer barrel on, and holy hell is it good at cooking cave crickets in Vault 94!
---
Have you ever thought that the 2*-3* legendary enemies are tired of you killing them? Nope, that's because you only think of yourself!
---
But seriously I am tired of it also
---
We both know the servers couldnt handle that kind of wacky flailing and waving.
---
Mrgllmrgll mrgll
---
Diluted Rad-X makes no sense. You can't dilute *pills*
---
Yeah, like diluted radaway should also have half the negative condition. Which isn't the case.
---
I'd report it to Bethesda.
---
The only reason I don't hate this bug more is that the turret often targets a couch, so I can name it Rick James.
---
Well unless you plan to blow up their building or kill their people then “internet activism” is your option. But Rockstar has even shittier levels of MTX so I wouldnt throw them in as top dog
---
People use 556 in place of caps and it’s 1:1.
---
50 hours is plenty to run into a legendary deathclaw. No one cares about your flex trying to put OP down.
---
Wrong. While Rockstar offers MTX, they actually provide quality content and meaningful ways to earn money without paying. Bethesda is using it as a lazy money grab. Christmas sale anyone?
---
If (BIG IF) they coded for it properly, everything added while on Private is ignored while on public.  They can already track item counts and have flags for various things so an "Built on Private Server" flag should be possible.  Anything with that flag is ignored on public.
---
Other way is build order is tracked and anything after budget is met/exceeded is flag for public ignore.
---
exactly
---
Wasnt putting him down I had a civil conversation and all your trying to do is white knight
---
I like to rebuild about every 100 hours or so. My latest build I went for realistic rustic ten camp. Wind turbines, 3 tents, small steel shack for vending small crops, and and a cow. I like what I see out there, lots of imagination I thought of this one because I haven't seen one yet well it fits my roleplay.
---
*celebration dance*
---
Problem is even the lowest ballistic weapons can't match the highest energy in damage per shot for the same class and they have like 1/3 of the durability to boot.  A maxed 10mm SMG has more damage and durability than a maxed auto laser rifle.  Plasma does better though but only because it's 1/2 and 1/2 energy/ballistic but it still has way less durability.
---
Do you happen to be a ps4 player?
---
Sadly no I’m on Xbox
---
That's unfortunate. I'm going to try to find a way to transfer sone caps over there for the help!
---
Most any given server will have a player vendor selling serums.  Don't pay more than 500 max and only if it's one you are grinding for.  I sell them all for 250 which seems fairly low IMO but I try to make it a service of sorts and sell a lot.  Don't let the Enclave screw you out of caps.
---
If they honestly cared about feedback they would have made this change a long time ago. There's really no excuse. I'm sure they're seeing data that shows a bunch of people who don't know any better using it because it's got fire on it. That doesn't mean it works. Honestly that was the moment I lost my strong interest for this game, when I finally got a shishkebab and it was worthless.
---
Diluted Stimpacks are the best. All the healing I need. But I also make everything myself.
---
I get it, but also rule 1 of game design is that it's not up to the players to change how they play in order to make your game fun. It's up to the game designers to make the game more fun.
---
It will arrive in a cloth bag.
---
I've started making my own with used hair and asbestos.
---
Yeah, nah. Being a raider and a member of the Enclave aren't mutually exclusive, MODUS is just looking for operatives who can get the job done, and the Brotherhood are just raiders who delude themselves they have a higher purpose. Faction-based PVP is the thing I'm looking forward to the most with Wastelanders if they introduce it, I want to kill and eat some squishy settlers.
---
There was a datamine of the drop chances and they were ridiculously low. So there is probably a few legitimate ones out there it was just very few
---
Don’t worry about it, if nothing else I’m in the personal business of drop nukes so consider me a branch office
---
I probably should have snagged it. Or at least done some screenshots. I don't often encounter dupers in the wild, but every now and then, I'll stumble onto some having a wild Bottlecap Mine and Fireworks rave or running around with all the rare Fashnacht masks or whatever.
---
.
---
This camp was just a whole other level. And now I'm mad that I didn't have enough money.
---
Great idea!!
---
Could have an engine mod to run them on fusion cores 🤔
---
Oh no I wasnt buying I was just getting rads and getting rid in would get 1 mutation every 6 minutes or so but still I'm a fairly low level of 32
---
They could just stop camp placement being blocked from proximity to another so you could let the borders overlap. Easiest way to do it without needing major changes to the current system since we can build in team members camps anyway.
---
:)
---
Why does it suck for the SBQ? I love seeing noobs turning up and getting rekt lol
---
I haven't rebuilt mine in almost a year lol im actually pretty content with the look and location of mine, At least until if ever they increase the budget.
---
Yes, little Tadpole.
---
Noooo please, thanks for the answer
---
Fuck mini bikes, give us the full-sized versions we see everywhere. Limit them to travel on roads but give them storage space like the Corvega in FO2 so we can have a portable stash for when we're overloaded.
---
Yeah maybe even make them a random spawn for the plans like the Holloween costumes so you never know where there gonna be but everyone at some point will have a chance to get them. Or just random spawns so you can use one when you see it laying around.
---
Nukes R Us
---
Enable damage numbers, see how much damage you do, roll over, cry and then try to improve it.
---
Has potential that's for sure 👍
---
Lol I'm tryna keep it simple. But being able to use it when over encumbered would be dope. It would have also fixed the fast travel in survival.
---
Because if the map is mostly noobs, there  are less people dropping nukes, and it's harder to kill her.
---
Eh the GTAV vehicles became more of a whale griefers delight then anything meaningful. Sure it brought new game modes but fallout isnt really a genre that could benefit from “vehicle races and mayhem” hell they are two totally different engines and i doubt gamebryo could even handle it.
---
MTXs have to be labeled as “all bad” or no one gets to be the judge on whats bad or good.
---
Limiting them to the roads would be simpler than trying to implement the physics of travelling off road. It's a cruiser like a Harley so they could basically just use a different character model while using it and have an animation to get on and off it like getting in power armor. Then all they'd need to add is a map marker like when you leave your PA somewhere in FO4.
---
It's easy af to drop a nuke yourself, why wait for someone else to do it?
---
People who make those threads are just new players who haven’t learned yet. Don’t worry, Bethesda will cripple them eventually.
---
Yeah but them invisible walls lol If its faster then running out of stamina your good. Maybe just scatter a limited amount around and if you find one you find one.
---
&gt;Bold of you thinking they care.
---
Not so smart of you thinking we care.
---
They could add a new quest to build one from salvaged parts, I'd enjoy that as a biker irl because it's one of the first things I'd be doing in that situation.
---
....you are kidding right?
---
Agreed, I just hate the silo, it's boring.
---
You can cut em in half!
---
Use it as an opportunity to farm scrap. Plenty of good steel on those robots and lead in the weight room.
---
This game is so fucked
---
This 
---
It'll come with mold and the wrong kind of bag and be really cheaply made while touting itself as a premier ^(rum) Mothman.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just going off the track record I don't think I'll be buying anything physical off Bethsaida any time soon. (Digital is looking pretty suspect as well sigh . . .)
---
That might be my buddy.  I found the pie; he has a sniper's nest above wes tech and gets all the pie daily for about 9 months now.
---
Engine isn't built for it in general. It's why vehicle mods are few in Fallout 4. Engine can't handle world render rate.
---
Sure, but the recipe is Rad-X and water!
---
How have I never seen these before!?
---
that really made me laugh out loud
---
My go to gun as a melee full health build.  Only 2 star but way more than good enough for PVE.
---
Agree, only issue is that it will break the weapon quickly. Very quickly.
---
Put a suppressor on the Lever Action if you go the stealth path.
---
Ha, true. I never use rad-x, it always gets sold so I guess I didn’t think about it much, even though I could convey exactly what you meant in your first post. It really doesn’t make any sense in the current form. Then again, a lot of things in 76 don’t make sense...
---
*I just want to place a cupboard on the wall, dammit*
---
I mean, you gotta care if you don't care because they don't care that your care for them.  
---
Friggin care-oussel.
---
False. It just takes extra steps.
---
Feels fun to me. Yeah there is some tedious bugs to overcome but once you learn the work-arounds it’s great.
---
PvP could use a tiny work though. Godmode is gamebreaking.
---
Well shit there goes my bank account... MUST CUDDLE THE WISE ANS BENEFICENT MOTHMAN!
---
I'm going to start spamming orbital strike beacons when the pricks do it.
---
I didn't see any of these when I went to the Mothman Festival this year. Heck they must have went quick
---
I got this last year and then only played every so often.IDK why but last week I just ***had*** to start playing and have gotten to lvl 38 in about 8 or 9 days. I am really having fun and learning how to truly play this time. I have done the SBQ but I admit I would not have known what the hell it was 5 days ago.  The people I have run across help when low lvls are noob-ing their way around, explaining what to do next, or how to share kills in the mine. I have already paid it forward by sharing to low lvls the stuff given to me this last week. This game has the type of players that I like. They want us, new people, to like it as much as they do. Oh, I know there are ass9oles but they are in every game, this one is just lucky to have more nice than not (so far.).
---
I want that mothman backpack that was in the concept art for backpacks. That was adorable.

Ran into 3, 3 star legendary ghouls doing a monster mash tonight, I was wearing the mask and there was another guy but he didn't agro me so i just let him be, there's a fair amount of good loot in the school too, not to mention the candy. It's pretty rare to see people doing it so it's never a shit show like uranium fever and the loot is max level

If there's a pie dispenser I will always start it but walk away, can't be arsed waiting around for a hit or miss but recently I have been waiting and the rng gods have been smiling upon me.😀

There was also the nerf for one shot PVP builds that killed their demand. I have a BE dragon that I barely use because it’s pretty much useless.

Just bought the game on sale for 12$ on Black Friday.
---
that would have been one cool youtube clip!
---
I played up to level 97 when the game was new and I hadn’t played in about a year. For some reason this week I just really wanted to get back on
---
Unrelated. Walking around as a lvl 8 and saw him at lvl 35 and scared the crap out of me. Literally ran away and he vanished into thin air.
---
I’ve noticed legendaries all went up significantly during the Legendary Vendor Sale....I usually try and pick up 1-2 Star items off player vendors during these events if they are under 600 caps but everything I’ve seen since this sale started are over 2k for bullshit traits
---
Maybe the scarecrows come alive and the turrets know
---
Really? What drops them in particular?
---
Make sure your quest are active in the menu. I had some problems like that. I would do a quest and then when it started the new one, it wasn't active . I had to click on it to start it
---
I’m in the WS down at the workbenches
---
I run gunsmith r5 and it's not to bad. I alsi have a ton of repair kits from the Queen just Hadd to drop 100 of them lol
---
Eyeroll...
---
Had a lvl 9 and lvl 11 run up on my earlier while I was building my camp... highly aggressive and obviously new, I invited them to the party chat but only one joined, a little kid and was well as most little kids are, dumb. After about a minute of them trying to kill me as I stood there not fighting back, I taught them a lesson in civility by killing them and taking their little bit of loot. They did not return or try again. 
---
Hey New players a word of advice, don’t roll up in a high level players camp acting a fool, I usually give new players a bunch of goodies to help y’all out... you won’t receive any hospitality if you act like a criminal on my land.
---
As someone else mentioned, Scorcjed drop them, and Wavy Willard’s always has them. Other locations in the ash heap or savage divide can also spawn scorched that drop em.
---
Can we have a game that works first? Lol
---
Do you want the regular automatic or powerful automatic?
---
Hey thanks. We've both turned everything but the quest we're doing off and still have issues.  I'll double check to make sure it's all turned off; but at times one or both of us get no markers or the marker to go back into ft. defiance.  It's as if the quests don't update the steps when we're teamed up.
---
&gt;. I think they should scale the difficulty with more stars and then it would be worth it
---
They could have them regenerate a number of times equal to the number of stars. Then have loot equal to the star rating would be appropriate. Right now, I agree, I don't think that it really takes more effort to kill a 3* than a 1*
---
This is why we can't have nice things, internet.
---
It will open the launcher yes but you just need to click play and it’ll launch the game and you’ll have the steam overlay once the game is running. 
---
As for steam not being able to add launchers for you I can’t really help unfortunately as I’ve never had that issue and am not sure how to help sorry.
---
Was taking over converted munitions from these two lvl ~50ish dudes and they fought till the end for it. They didn’t back down till the workshop was completely taken over and I admired them for that. However once I took it over they left, probably server hopping, I wanted to give them some advice on maybe speccing their build to take less damage in PvP and what types of weapons to lookout for, and as fellow power armor users some tips on how to make power armor actually protect you instead of getting cooked alive in your tin can by anti armor weapons and tank killer, but they probably server hopped)): anyways, when I was taking the shop they were out in the front contesting so I had to go out and once they started firing at me their turrets, gun emplacements, and chopper all went to work on me. It was pretty intense getting fired at from all angles whilst being kept occupied by the two things that were the biggest threat to my life, if it weren’t for my power armor I don’t think I would have survived the bombardment of two players plus like 5 turrets a chopper and two gun emplacements but with the help of nerd rage emergency prots suppressor super stims and lone wanderer I was reducing a significant amount of damage from them all and didn’t die a single time, felt like I was on one of those stories in the lore explaining how power armor units were soaking up tank shells and ripping Chinese tanks open and being almost unkillable by small arms of the enemy infantry, felt like I had fought off a whole militia after that workshop haha gg to those two if they read this
---
Hey man it works, just not as good
---
Instancing is the one big thing this game is lacking since day 1:
---
Quest relevant indoor areas not to speak of an instanced white spring interior as a player hub. So I like your idea. Imagine rebuilding the abandoned Vault76 as an instanced clan camp.
---
Unlikely.
---
They're gazibos.
---
I thought that only worked with flamers so that’s really cool
---
Really?  Speed demon speed is already kind of crazy.  Caps on bonus is a good thing for balance.
---
Well sorry if im not instantly an expert in a game when i start it like you. But when i started stash limit was super low so i put alot of points in to strenght wich forced me to play with heavy weapons and melee. Im also level 150 atm wich makes it kind of hard to completly respec my special points as i have most perks most of wich are useless perks from the perk packs. Im sick of using heavy weapons and im sitting on a pile of good rifles and other weapons i want to try out. I don't think you can blame the need for a SPECIAL points respec abbility on peoples 'poor choices'.
---
Fallout 76 uses the same engine as previous games, which cannot handle high speeds. Skyrim has its horses speeds capped at what they were because any faster caused the game to become unstable.
---
Even in Fallout 4, the vertibirds looked like they were flying fast but they were only moving at about character sprint speed. The game is buggy enough as it is, if the movement cap were removed it’d be way worse.
---
Im not exactly sure where it is capped but speed demon is pretty close to the cap but wouldn’t it be nice to be able to be a post apocalyptic sonic xd
---
Did you recently edit flooring? Stone top foundations and wire mesh flooring will put put you over budget. Just change them to plank and restart the game.
---
Ah, didn’t know it was a technical limitation, dissapointed but not surprised.
---
Wait for it. Wastelanders are coming soon and the mothman cultists will bring it with them.
---
Membership is per platform, not per Bethesda account, unfortunately.
---
I don't think that anything you can stumble onto 2 or 3 of in an area can be defined as rare. But I think they should change them to be rare if they gave guaranteed drops.
---
I never use power armor in NW but a friend had it happen. The solution turned out to be opening camera mode and trying different poses, then exiting camera mode and he was bake to move normally. This can also help when stuck in a variety of other ways too, like between bushes.
---
This is community driven feedback at its finest
---
It’s a hell of a lot of game for $12
---
I can't comment on the PVP side of things but I wear the armoured backpack when running the vault raids and need to wear a hazmat suit and combined with my bonus damage resistance perk cards it goes ok. I wouldn't say it was remarkable damage resistance but it stacks and if you can afford to lose the carry weight then every little bit helps.
---
Since everyone here is talking about dev room items, is the plan for the Laser Musket obtainable via scrapping it ?
---
I’ve done this before and beth do nothing. Plus if the game costs $12 and these scum have the opportunity to make $500 they’ll just buy the game again and create new accounts and continue their practices.
---
but it was more than once man, 
---
i came over and gave you some stuff and you were gone after that man, it hurt me, i just wanna help you out and do dem adventure quests with you bro
---
cool bro, i will be on today
---
Lol
---
add me on psn: Owl_No
---
I swap between insulated and armor plated, just depends on who you are fighting
---
Hunters long coat is easier to find because you can server hop to get it from the responder vendor bot.
---
Leather coat is a rare drop from events in the mire which makes it a huge pain. Especially because the daily quests were bugged for a lot of players until pretty recently.
---
i made a small hovering village connected to a mountain cliff 
---
i call it mountown
---
Oh yeah forsure getting insulated if anything.
---
Alright
---
North Korea
---
i just sell the technical data at the vendors lol
---
Imma laugh when they fulfill this out of everything
---
With a pistol build it could be really fun to have some more speed bonus. And this could balance out the pistol build with rifles and heavy guns
---
You’ve got at least 50 to 100 hrs how base game play for $25. I would say it’s well worth the punt. I’ve being playing since launch and although my playtime has severely dropped off in the last couple of months this is more down to the lack of end game content having completed the main storyline twice and will change once the big wastelanders update comes in early 2020
---
Owl_No is my psn

Thanks for the advice, I've added Covert Ops and kept adrenaline, I've noticed quite an improvement.
---
This is hilarious. 
---
“Mind if a crash here? My turrets are trying to kill me”
---
I really hate that cover Johnny D ftw, but the game is pretty fun, just had a great 3 hour sesh with 3 nuke queen events, bloody great, really enjoyed it, first time using my furious explosive mini gun, I'm a happy lad.
---
I’ve found it happens when a turret hits another turret. I had a turret behind another in the direction of a common enemy spawn and it happened regularly. 
---
Now it is moved it doesn’t ever seem to happen. Well it happened regularly before and now hasn’t happened in a few weeks. 
---
Worth a try
---
I'm also picking up a few combat rifles at Camden park .... the combat and handmade rifles seam to unlock mods quite easily. I collect mr fuzzy tokens every day and get probably 4 rifles ...
---
Hi FF, is there a guide you used setup running two instances? Did you copy the game install to run on a seperate drive? Cheers
---
Why not a front in game camp with limited budget slightly higher than we have and a bunker door with load in giving a massive budget. Wouldn't be game breaking and tardis like then.
---
Don't forget to get lvl 2 starched genes perk
---
Yeah it got a bunch of assholes.
---
I think we are going to a golden era of Fallout 76, first with Wastelanders, but also with the new players and the new gear we all have grinded for, so those two combined comprensate each others and a SBQ can still be done in 5 minutes pretty often; with also less bugs, etc...
---
I have received several mundane dragons and one legendary shishkebab in the last month of playing, but I've never found a legendary Dragon.
---
You can get the small backpack plan for free from Morgantown airport.
---
This game is cool af. I really like it because it has a big map, a friendly community and lots to do.
---
In my opinion it is a really good game
---
Oh good! I was worried about your atoms and your ability to buy the last two things you don’t own in the shop.
---
Not a conscious decision but I've found myself mostly using my bloodied handmade now, when I was full melee. 
---
So thinking about it it was the constant non registering of melee hits and the refusal of the game to swing my weapon when clicking the left mouse key, 5.. 6.. 7.. clicks to get a swing, not always but often enough for it to be annoying so when I picked up the rifle kinda moved over to that with melee as a backup for sheep and bears.
---
I feel your pain.
---
[Apparently it’s Steve Carell ](https://youtu.be/EIX9YgnrNbY)
---
Nice , but i assume its not moddable ?
---
That does sound a little like him though. I know the odds were bad but i thought it was funny!
---
&gt; So he admits there is an issue 
---
The question is why is Bethesda doing the same. Proactively. You know, where it could have been useful to know.
---
have u never played a good  falout this games is a bare bones POS
---
There are item cases in 76? How do i get em?
---
right?
---
The Ground Zero one? I think you actually have to be in the center of the circle as it drops, that’s what triggered it for me
---
Sadly not, doesn't take mods or skins. 
---
But it's a bit of free extra carry weight if that's what you need.
---
Because then everyone would be printing caps and giving people easy money (im assuming your talking about a factory that makes nuka cola and not a vending machine)
---
Yeah , thanks for the heads up
---
Glad it all worked out!
---
Buildable display cases have their own tab in the camp building menu, they don't require plans to unlock except for the atomic shop specific ones like the thanksgiving shelf.
---
Probably the one confirmed drop of the sun mask ( that I know ) was a woman on PS4 and obviously didn't give it up. So it is as rare as can be.
---
Yooo thanks hombre
---
Sure, but my concern was that Beth was just gonna tell me that they gave me the atoms when they clearly hadn't or even worse just continue explaining to me how their atom distribution system works. Which while we're on it...why is it only 1650 a month even if you buy a years worth all at once? Like...do they not know how to multiply? ESO gives you your crowns all at once if you buy longer sub times and from what I can gather they are trying to mirror that system.
---
If u cant take advantageof a perk everyone has access to then its not the games fault. maybe u should find an easier game to play.
---
Well I still have not received the atoms lol, It's just being sent up to someone with more power to fix the problem.
---
Lemme guess, a frogger?
---
I played Fallout 4
---
How'd you even come across this post? It's over a week old
---
I reckon there will be a new round of different masks. What is the point of recycling those 5 common ones. Nobody wants those.
---
That explains a lot fallout 3 and new Vegas were better and had more todo
---
Not really, could force at the minimum two players need to be in the share
---
DEFCON INCORPORATED
---
This is perfect! I feel like starting a nuke run business of my own just so that I can call it that.
---
Server hop &amp; it should fix it. 👍
---
Same happened to me its been like this for a solid 3 weeks now
---
Tired but it still don’t work.
---
It doesn’t need a slot, the camp acts as a beacon, if one team member is on one sever then the camp will be there, if another is on another server, then the camp is on there... there doesn’t need to be a fixed slot effect.
---
Well, this is not fo4.
---
Ikr !
---
Is she stuck in a dialogue loop instead of the quest completing? 
---
 Try completely restarting the game, if that doesn’t work then there’s probably nothing you can do.
---
I think we all do really but I'm just really well off and bored.
---
if you really spent so much on cosmetics I have almost no doubt you are bored and trying to fill the empty ness of the soul by using material resources...
---
Unpowered vendors won't display on the map HUD, so you can lock one away guilt-free. Alternatively if you have the budget, workshops displays are safe from scrapping.
---
I'm also getting turrets break immediately when placed. The shooting is just as annoying
---
 you answered like if I have a problem with you spending your money. I never said that.
---
I feel like the high end items in every category are true weapons for the most part. What level are you and what weapons are you using that aren't weapony enough?
---
I'm more jealous of your level than the camp. And that you play with finalrender.
---
Holotapes in 76 have more emotion in them than FO3 or FNV NPCs. Basically the only emotional line you ever heard in Fallout was "ohhh those poor little mole ratties!"
---
Ah those always struck me as reasonable weapons compared to some of the others, or things that might be used to assault someone.
---
What fist weapons would you want in the higher tiers?
---
Thanks for that mate.
---
I did expect to see a few every week, like some 10% discounts
---
I didn’t buy a fallout game for emotional holotapes im sorry if you did then great
---
I've played 3, being railroaded by essential NPCs on the gamebryo engine where speech checks are randomized and the plot entails following your dad around is brutal.
---
I don't understand what you could like about it more than 4 much less 76. New vegas is nice because of its heavy roleplay elements and freedom of choice, weapon balance and perks but 3 has absolutely none of that.
---
No I meant the holotapes have more emotion in them than the NPCs
---
 Yeah I was only trying to make myself feel better I just didn’t wanna get my hopes up. I expected something not just three things or excuses but discounts like they said
---
not sure about the maths but as far as i know the higher the damage per shot the higher your armor penetration
---
the plasmas damage is splitted so its basically a combination of two times lower damage , therefore its armor penetration is way weaker that that of your revolver or lever action i guess
---
Do u people still buy that garbage subscription? 2 months later and not realizing youre getting hard scammed by bethesda
---
This game has everything a normal Fallout has except it's not a conversation simulator like Outerworlds or previous fallout games, but that's coming with Wastelanders
---
Worked fine for me the whole week though..
---
This happens every holiday season. Then new players pack up and leave once they play the game enough to be truly frustrated with it's current state. Maybe 1 in 20 new players will stick around to hit lvl 50+
---
I wanted to say something but downvotes from fallout 1st members told me no
---
I used the flying glitch with the jetpack back in early days and going across the map even slowly gets laggy af. The map won't render quick enough and you will freeze for longer than a loading screen
---
I dont even bother doing this, some idiot with bloodied handmade shows up and oneshots everything. Every event is like this.
---
We got swords, boxing gloves, all manner of household implements like shovels/sickles/rolling pins- we got gauntlets - we got a bear skull.. what kind of weapons are you hoping for?
---
How do you know how many people got them after the event?
---
My “Dross Toss” daily is stuck in the “Listen to Zack” phase.. not matter how many times I listen to him ramble about his personality protocols.. the daily NEVER continues! Made getting my fuzzy rather frustrating...
---
Make sure you ask their age first....
---
They’re on the same page and are labelled and are different colors. 
---
If I send you to the store to buy Pepsi (Blue), but when you walk in you pick up the first cola you see; Coke (Red), even though there is Pepsi **right next to it...** *whose fault is that?*
---
Just joined 👍
---
I agree completely. Add some content, update the game more than once every one or two months, and don’t be shit at interacting with the players and community outreach, and FO1st would be 100% worth it. Extra stash space is a pathetic attempt to make up for an empty Atomic shop and no added content since launch.
---
It’s like your house is on fire but you’re complaining that the Wifi doesn’t work. That’s my point.
---
Don’t we all
---
That would be a good start. I'd like to be able to complete Novice runs solo. It might be possible, but it's frustrating enough that after the first few tries- at which point I had to break stealth to access a terminal, got swarmed, died and found myself outside the Vault again- I haven't bothered.
---
This happened to me as well &amp; I had given up on it. The problem for me was that I had used the items she told me to collect. Even though they were checked off on the quest list I had to have them on me when I went back to see her. When I did that the quest completed.
---
Buy low, sell high, sounds like a plan to me.
---
OP in regards to the glitch you speak of. I have found that waiting to respawn around a minute or two sometimes 5 or 6. Will allow you to respawn. I’ve had this glitch happen to me frequently at Encryptid and Scorched Earth Events. And all I do is wait and you can loot your dropped items and the boss with no issues. Just my input. Enjoy the Appalachia my friend!!!
---
I did that to two or three scout masks last December thinking I would learn the plans for them. -_-
---
Lol. They’re going to “forget.” It’s just theft at this point.
---
No more meme power armor pls
---
Are you trying to learn legendary effects by scrapping items? If so you have wasted your caps, you cannot learn them.  If you could just craft legendary weapons everyone would have the best of the best weapons.  You might learn an unrelated mod by scrapping an item legendary or not, but never an effect.  Scrap regular items and take legendaries to the scrip machine outside any train station, use them or sell/trade with them.
---
This would instantly ruin trap camps, I’d be sad haha
---
No, I am not purchasing legendary items just regular ones for scrapping. Sorry for the misleading post but scrapping normal items.
---
You can buy serums for about 300-400 caps each. Just saying.
---
That ruined GTAO completely forever. No thank you.
---
executioners and +50% on crits is pinnacle  on rifles with the right perks in luck. think about it. sneak and first shot from crouch is like baby instigating; once you hit that 40% it's double/double. i've got it on a handmade and a fixer. vats all day long and you'll see 600's on  the hit scan numbers.
---
no shotguns or heavies though.
---
 
---
# Executioners is often overlooked, great prefix on the right weapon / perked
---
I’ve got four characters and this part was the biggest drag.
---
It you run power to a switch, then to the siren it will fix this problem :)
---
Nothing OP that's for sure. You have any better ideas?
---
If you've got the perks, thrown on Super duper and scrapper and craft the lowest level of the weapon and scrap it. I think some mods can only be learned it you've got your perk card levelled to it (could be wrong). For example, I have gunsmith 3 and have never learned a recon scope for any weapon because to craft it, my gunsmith would need to be higher. People say high intelligence is needed, but I don't agree with that. Some weapons are easy to find in the wild, so you can learn all the mods just by collecting a bunch and scrapping those. Some weapons are rarer and getting all the mods is very time consuming, as the mods don't drop from scrapping easily (e.g. Radium rifle).
---
try to increase your intelligence before scrapping items that helps
---
other than that the only info is that it doesnt matter wich level the item you scrap has or which mods are attatched the lowest level version with no mods has the same chance to unlock a mod as a highly modded lvl 50 version
---
the radium rifle btw is a pain in the ass to unlock mods for
---
Try blueprinting one of those things on their own and placing the blueprint.
---
Not having vehicles is a better idea for me. Sounds like a slower and worse version of fast travel.
---
I build on alts so I can keep things longer :) it’s worth the effort
---
I rebuild every couple of weeks and try to do something random and different.
---
Here is the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drmsuy/guide_complete_list_ingame_obtainable_apparel_in/)
---
You mean "game" not "bug" no ?
---
Things like the ballistic fist, the old style of power fist and the displaced glove and things like the thermic lance for two handed
---
Well that's good because I thought that's what you meant lol.  Depends on the weapon you are trying to get mods for.  If it's the handmade or lever action you are better off buying the plans to make the weapon, making the lowest level version and scrapping it all yourself.  Completely unmodded weapons can still reach any mod when scrapped.
---
As for buffs, some people claim higher int increases the chance of learning mods, but I've never seen it proven and unlocked tons with low int in the past. If you want to be safe you could try boosting your int with mentats and food.
---
I think you are showing my point, minus the swords and the boxing glove which are lack luster endgame none of those are actually weapons...
---
Would it work to just craft the lowest level of a weapon in massiv amounts and then scrapping?
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
I'm going to venture a guess and say that they will start popping up a month after the fix for fallout 1st being disabled earlier last month. It was speculated that a trial version of 1 week was given out instead of the full month. The sub was down for a few days and chances are they just gave everyone a full month sub after that and are going from there.
---
I recommend It for berserkers. That way you can get stats bonuses from a jumpsuit, while not losing damage.
---
Oh no, I wasn't playing back then so I never even had the chance :(
---
Great idea even just adding an instanced aspect
---
To the camp solves the budget problem @bethesda
---
You can carry all the backpacks so it's easy to switch  between them as the situation requires. I have all three so I start armored and will switch to standard or high capacity to lug my loot home.
---
I have 4 sets but no dupe. Lol.
---
500 for a PA? Or for a not-sure-if-real dupe method?
---
Not glitched. Tenderizer. Same weapon graham uses. Only available during meat week. I have one on display at my camp.
---
I'm at work, I will add you in the morning
---
Goddamn lifesaver.
---
I found a guy in same situation as you once and made him an armor set and a rifle.... but he run away, in fear of PvP I guess... :(
---
True, its pretty safe to assume their focus isnt on f76. I always supported bethesda in the past and bought every single fallout game but right now its just hard to still want to support them, im upset that right now they just want to rip off the remaining people still playing with 115€ annual subscriptions. Why pay for a overpriced subscription when youre getting no new content at all? Id be ok if it was like 5€ monthly and they added some new patch every month. Atm they are just ripping off the leftovers just to fund their next games
---
It takes 2 hours lol
---
Always cool :)
---
I have a lead mine at my camp, and I get way more steel from scrapping wepons from WesTec
---
I can agree with the radium rifle, one of the primary mod types I’m trying to learn.
---
Wait do people buy fallout 1st and after that spend Money in the atom shop? But..
---
Someone sounds a bit salty. Did ya get griefed when you were young?
---
So a silo full of robots is boring, but a lab full of super-mutants isn't? That makes sense.
---
That second one is my tree topper this year!
---
I believe you have to have two copies of the game
---
I’m not 100% tho
---
Great response and thanks for taking the time to write that!
---
- Bethesda
---
- camp building, kinda chill in short bursts
---
- performance is okay. Some areas are better than others. 
---
- no, not yet. But it’s going that way. 
---
- there are a lot of cool places but barely any surprises. Nights aren’t dark so it’s hard to feel creeped out. Everything is fairly predictable 
---
Verdict - wait till Wastelanders. But if it’s cheap might as well get it. It can be fun with friends. NEVER spend full price on this game.
---
Intelligence makes no difference, that's a myth.
---
Look! What videogames do to people in 2019! The country is going to hell!
---
Yes, that's the easiest way for rarer weapons.
---
as far as i know they fucked up some digits so the radium rifle has the unlock chances of armor or something like that and therefore its cruel and expensive to unlock mods for that
---
It's quicker, I get legendaries and I get way more steel. I  use remote play on my phone to occasional tap my lead mine, junk and water. It makes sense to me, it might not for everyone else but that's ok.
---
No, you don't need to reconfigure anything at all.
---
If you normally use the launcher to open your game then do that &amp; then open the second account with the .exe. It will open another game window separate from the first. Log into your second account there. Or you can open both accounts from the exe if you don't like the launcher. So log into one account then click on the exe file again &amp; log in to the second account.
---
Does that make sense? Ask if you need more help :)
---
I brought it while it’s cheap and due to not having had many games my friends enjoy lately. Maybe by the time we reach end game the update will drop too. 
---
Cheers for input.
---
We were talking about doing a silo for the purpose of fighting a SBQ, that will net you far more legendaries and weapons than a West Tek run, but whatever.
---
I have a sweet bloodied ffr +agility western revolver that I like to swap perk cards out for. Other than trying out different weapons, no, I personally prefer guerilla.
---
I have a bunch of friends who have finished this, you can just have a friend take a workshop and place terminals, lock, pick, and repeat :)
---
I had the same issue but it still allowed me to actually pick up the dross and throw it in the tires which fixed it for me
---
Seems like a glitch. A good one.
---
Yup
---
No, they’re spending atoms. The discount should be shown in atoms, like it is for everyone else.
---
Looks like an old bug has resurfaced, this happened to me a couple of times a while back when fast travelling to hoard events in the Ash Heap.
---
I build traps, it’s a good time and 99% of people will be happy to die if you give them a unique experience :)
---
No worries, needed it too xD
---
Massive heal? Is that so different than vampire effect?
---
It's not just melee. My bloodied auto pipe can show 5 250 damage, only one shot is applied.
---
You don't need Perks like Gunsmith to learn the relevant Mods. I learned every Weapon/Armor Mod with only Scrapper active. High Intelligence gives you back more components with Scrapper which is why high INT is important. The odds of learning some Weapon and Armor Mods are incredibly low. Radium Rifle took me over 2000 Scraps. My final Robot Armor (Enameled Arm) took me over 900. Recently finished learning everything and it really takes a horrendous amount of materials to accomplish.
---
Wow that's surprising, would've expected the small backpack to be aimed at those who want to use Atom shop backpack skins but don't want to grind the challenges.
---
So Armor mods are harder to learn than gun mods?
---
Oh okay, I’ll give that a shot next time  there for the other dailies! Thanks :)
---
That dog is All ass
---
Me and my buddy are usually on from 9pm to 1 am est. always looking for someone else to run NW or just explore both level 100s. Both chill laid back old school stoners. Psn is BoogalooBronson
---
You can add me PSN jourik82. I'm not in to metal butt I love hardcore/punk 😉. I don't know what timezone you are in. I'm from Belgium and I got a mic.
---
It's designed for newbie players who haven't done the tadpole questline yet.
---
BETHESDA - quick guys we got a live 1
---
My last play sesh I was killed by a mothman ten levels higher than me and I couldn't rez anywhere &gt;.&lt;
---
Oh im usually on after 1 unfortunately I would just miss you guys most nights.  Thanks for reaching out though.
---
I sent you a fr.  You are five hours ahead of me but thats ok I prefer over seas mates!!
---
I've played non-stop since the beta, on Xbox One. Multiple characters, a ton of legendaries I worked my ass for. Just picked it up on PS4 because I have a friend who wants to play coop. Very humbling going back to the absolute beginning, with nothing, and I mean NOTHING unlocked. I don't even have a good outfit for my female character...back to the swimsuit and red dress.
---
But good on you for helping people out. Makes them stick around and gives the game some life. I can tell by all the looted early locations that the newbie population has spiked.
---
Yeah, plenty of new dwellers around. The ones that did talk mentioned Black Friday deals in regards to the purchase.
---
The funniest one was the lad that went straight to Nuclear Winter after playing just a bit of Adventure. 
---
He got amazed by everything and we had to explain all about the usual terms.
---
In the end of the match, 2 nukes got throw into the circle and we got hit by the last one. A good first impression for him, I would say.
---
This makes zero sense. The need for scrap has not gone away but anything you should be selling more since storage isn’t an issue.
---
Oh the only option it said was talk to mothman but it wouldn’t work, my friend not know that then.
---
What a sensitive lad.
---
They are a spawn behind a billboard south of top of the world. There are four of them, different colours spawn every time. When they die (ie. are inevitably murdered) they resurrect a short while later, thankfully. It's my favourite camp ever.
---
Not only that, but every time I swing a melee weapon at an enemy, I lag badly on PS4 🙄
---
Some people aren't happy unless they're spreading misery.
---
I don't use the app. In the browser on a PC, it's under Community Details (sidebar on the right) -&gt; Community Options -&gt; User Flair Preview
---
I was thinking they should turn the eat-o-tronic into something that can hold dried foods too. Similar to the punch bowl or candy bowl, allow us to assign food to it to give people.
---
Imagine outing yourself as being a total rube and giving Bethesda even more money they don't deserve.
---
I accepted. Will be online in 1-2 hours. Have to some things first.
---
The animations are already janky with speed demon alone, the cap is in place because of that, 76 is capable of fast moving players only vehicle speeds would be an issue plus it would be a bit op moving that fast but fun I guess, either speed demon speed buff needs to be halfed to allow for other equipment/perks to help or re-balance those to do other things.
---
IMO, knockout the tadpoles on purpose. Athletic is super easy, archery(no gunsmith, no weapons artisan), and the 3rd choice is up to your playstyle. Have friends? Swimming is easy, I like to cook, so that's my go-to, even though there is a lot of fast travel involved., Once they are unlocked, just playing for a little while will start filling in some of those possum requirements.
---
I'd happily have spiral stairs. Anything that's contained in a 1x1 space.
---
Actually, restarted the game recently. Playing at low level (now in my 20s) is a forgotten challenge.
---
I caught someone trying to pick the lock to my electrical room wear my scrap bot is.
---
Real life tho
---
Sure! $35 for the plushie though. And you get a free skin for your cat?
---
I usually say screw it to those dailies lol
---
I just want two things and they both involve 1st.
---
REDUCE THE PRICE!!!
---
FIX THE PRIVATE SERVER STABILITY!!!
---
Same here.  My main eventually adopted the pistol setup of my alt simply because the hits seemed more reliable.
---
Melee is especially bad if you're ever put in a chase scenario with an enemy.  It's like the game cannot figure out your relative positions at all, so you'll swing and miss constantly, even though the damage numbers show up on your end.  That's the interesting thing about this - the damage numbers always show up.  The client clearly believes it hit the enemy, but the server vetoes it or never hears about it.  Why is there even a disconnect here?  Why aren't the damage numbers actually verified?  That's kind of an important, fundamental thing, right?
---
At the rate we're going, I don't expect this to be fixed before Wastelanders... if at all.  So, it was time to have a fallback.
---
I've lost so many cows to one shotgun turret.
---
I'm sorry Bessie, Bessie 2, Bessie 3, Maybelle, Bessie 4 through 15, Lulu, and Zeke.
---
No I meant that you don’t deserve to get downvoted for having an opinion
---
Ok for sure that sounds good youre welcome to hmu with some players that fit the times im on.
---
Confirmed. Spend all day vendor hopping for flux between queen runs.
---
I dont listen while playing no i dont have a music program set up on my ps yet.  I like heavier stuff so would be jamming to my dying bride, draconian, dimmu borgir.  
---
What times do you usually play?  Ill have to add it up to see if youd ever be on when i am.
---
I...might do this.
---
Sure thing. You can have those.
---
I like you.
---
I payed for the first month and loved it. You got tons of atoms and emotes and a nice outfit with two color tones. The scrap box ate my shit. But they endedup giving mw more than i could have wver grinded. That being said the 2nd month has nothing new. And i will not re sub until theres a new thing every month to enforce the reason to sub. Im not gonna sub for the continued use of the scrap box. Theres just no incentive to stay subed.
---
On the roof of some building, I can’t remember where. Maybe arktos pharma, but I can’t confirm it
---
YES, I am having the same problem.  It's a damn nightmare.  SWOOSH it's attacking me swoosh swoosh swoosh dammit swoosh I'm gonna die swoosh hit.
---
Also after I'm dead:  I'll get the "Dodged an attack!" message several times.
---
Also sneaking up to melee range and clicking attack:  Nothing happens whatsoever.
---
Cheers I haven't really been looking but would like to taste some sweet pie at some point lol
---
What I'd like to see is either less jokey stuff (Walking canes?  Pool cues?  Seriously?) or have some of that jokey stuff brought up to par.
---
Eating one of those is the most underwhelming thing in the game.
---
That’s what I thought and I tried them the other day and no go
---
I’ll try thanks
---
There's... a festival? 😳😳😳
---
And on that note...what do you guys thing would be an acceptable price for screws ?
---
Anything used for ammo crafting will likely sell, especially now that many players have a bottomless pit to store it all in: 
---
1. Bulk Lead
---
2. Bulk Acid
---
3. Bulk Steel (has to be really cheap)
---
4. Bulk Cloth (again, really cheap) 
---
Of course, you could also just turn all that stuff into 5.56 and .45 ammo and make bank at 1c per. 
---
I would think that adhesive and ballistic fiber would sell regularly as well, along with screws, springs and maybe gears.
---
Combat is rapid fire, larger magazine, faster reload, and can add armour pierce with the magazine. Combat all the way
---
For the Chloe quest. Had this for more than 2 months.
---
- There’s a small bug.  The quest says complete, while not all ingredients are actually collected (that’s why Chloe doesn’t accept it).
---
- check the actual requirements in the “Data” tab and see the ingredient that’s missing.
---
This issue is still being worked on, word on the street is that it will become invite only but not yet....all friends on friends list can join
---
Does anyone know if it's possible to make the head lamp brighter?
---
Yes, my thought as well and i couldn't remember anyone else having this idea.
---
Nah more insecure if anything, there are alot of solid builds tho for every type of playstyle. PA heavy weapons are solid but there are stronger builds.
---
It's really finding the right weapon then building around that
---
It is, but its not as good as 4. A lot of the story is hidden in little details on the map like notes and terminals etc...
---
You walk near prickets fort and you just hear your power armor audibly getting excited
---
Todd salivating*
---
There is no true single player. If you’re interested in playing through the quests, there is an interesting enough story and a bunch of lore to be found wandering Appalachia.
---
* Stable Flux
---
* Ultracite Scrap
---
* Screws
---
* Springs
---
* Ballistic Fibre
---
I will ALWAYS buy steel, screws and acid when they are sold for a reasonable price. Lately I've been buying any uncommon scrap that is sold cheaply. I never buy lead, adhesive, bone shards, leather, glass, cork, oil. 
---
Not junk but I also buy blood packs and radshield.
---
Some players are selfish, some might just not realize what theyre doing.  Im polite always make sure everyone can get a shot in and dont use anything over powered.
---
To each is own.  I wouldve done the same thing you did though give him a thumbs down thinking i wish it was a middle finger lol.
---
I have the same issue with her. Works fine on one character but not my other. Same thing with queen of the hunt
---
Hardly possible because  every connector have a power bobble around it that powers everything and you'd most probably have overlapping "bobbles". It would be tough to limit the power to each room ,as you want.it would also force you to fixed light positions.
---
A fix my husband and I use, we go into builders mode, store the item, put it back and the health bar is full again.  No more seeing the nuisance half health walls!  Stay filthy!!!
---
Vim is an acquired taste.  Like a fine cigar or high end coffee.  Except Captain’s Blend, that stuff is god awful.
---
Nah. Screw that dude. I've left plenty of events because of douches like this.  Most of the time they are doing it to be an asshole intentionally. 
---
Yep, I can one shot just about anything as well but I'm out here with a crappy revolver just tagging stuff and getting whooped on by ghouls while I give everyone else a chance at tagging them.  Occasionally if I'm in a bad enough mood I'll stay and switch over to one shotting everything as well.  Make of game of dropping mobs before the original ass can hit them, and keep asking him how impressed he is with my bad ass build. Even more fun if you call them a food build repeatedly while you are at it lol.
---
No single player. So no.
---
You can't cut pills with water.
---
I am a plushie collector. Missed the one for Halloween v.v I would love a Mothman. Would fit the Mothman theme around my camp.
---
Edit: anyone see me on xbone, and have Said plush, I would love love love if we could co-op so you could drop, like, 3-4 in my camp.
---
You could try going through Sony to get a refund. I don't know how well that will work out though.
---
It's weird you're having issues though. I use private servers all the time on PS4, playing with friends and solo, and they are by far more stable than any public server Ive been on. I've had only one crashed server in the whole time since they were released, and I'm on private like 90% of the time.
---
sorry, let’s play today alright? i’ll be on at around 4pm est
---
We all don't want them, you want them.
---
Same here
---
I understand that but my post mentions sometimes having most of the 40 or 50-something items (I’m terrible at quantifying) that make up my camp showing a health bar. That’s a lot of work replacing all those things. Especially when there are things on top of things, like posters and mounted creature heads on walls, and such. Sometimes there are things that took a long time to mess with to get it to place correctly. You know?
---
Me too, of late I'm trying new zones as well. The backwoods bungalow is an interesting choice for a structure you can blueprint and actually place again in a new location. Now if I could just find my pickup truck, I know I parked it 27 years ago...
---
Yeah I’m in the same boat. I think the initial value is pretty good but I was hoping we’d get another cool outfit or something each month for staying subbed or some other Barbie features. To be honest with the amount of cash flow they are getting from FO1st and the cash shop there’s next to no excuse as to why they can’t add tons of shit to the store. Like that atom shop should be overflowing with cosmetic items. If they made more stuff they could lower the prices of everything and you’d have people buying multiple items anyway. 
---
I’d happily pay 5 bucks per for three cool outfits instead of 12 bucks for a stupid gimmick one. I’m sure I’m not the only one.
---
No the story is ass
---
Ditto, couldn't afford to keep mine in inventory.
---
I play alone 99% of the time and find it quite enjoyable.
---
Fits to the toxic waste challenge. Always thought this game was a mindset altering tool - a vault on its own, lol.
---
Nah that guy is an asshole I'd say. I can one shot everything that isnt a scorch beast or mirelurk queen, but at events I pull out a shitty 10mm pistol so everyone gets a hit. If I'm in an event where we need to protect something like free range, I'll kill everything coming close to my precious cows without question or hesitation
---
This right here is why 76 needs to move to a Free to Play model like Destiny 2 did. If only 1 in 20 sticks around, eventually the game will die off. With a free to play model, people who would have not normally considered playing would give it a try and like it, allowing for a larger player base and potentially more revenue for Bathesda. It's a win win.
---
I play public worlds and always run solo so I'd say so. For just story itself I would say yes if you like playing more of a detective roll, looking at the scene and piecing everything together with notes and voice recordings.
---
If you're looking for a linear game like cod campaign this isnt it
---
Eat a raw chicken and wash it down with toxic goo. You feel so bad it doesn't matter what Murmur gives you as a reward after that.
---
I was honestly surprised when the 2nd month  came and nothing new happened. Im also surprised  they told me id get exclusive discounts and that didnt even happen the first month.
---
I say this everytime I see a post wanting Elevators;
---
Bethesda cannot even sync doors correctly, I'm sure you've come across a closed door, try to open it only to have it close on you.
---
Or the funnier one; when you see a player run through a door that is closed on your screen, hell enemies even do it all the time at Harper's ferry.
---
I can already see it; Players just floating up an elevator shaft while the elevator stays grounded.
---
Ask them not to join.
---
Hi, first of thanks for responding :) I have a PS4 pro and most crashes I experience are while fast traveling or trying to join my friends worlds. The game freezes most of the time when I do this (the joining of servers) and when fast traveling my game sometimes just straight up crashes. After a while I thought it was just my console but it runs just fine with other games.
---
I am thinking, Use through wall diffusers and would need to disconnect the wire to diffuser.  All that electrical and switches will eat up tons of camp budget.  My husband uses switches but never like what ur wanting.  I hope this helps.  It still might not work.  Good luck! Stay filthy!!
---
I’ve had the opposite experience on private worlds. They’re not perfect but stuff like vault raids and SBQ fights are much smoother on private.

10 - 20c per scrip is pretty normal.  Personally I stick closer to 10 to 15c although if I'm near Max caps I'll go up to 20. I can't justify over that knowing most of the time I'm just getting garbage back from the purveyor.
---
I just turned in a little under a thousand script and literally got nothing of value. So even at the cheaper side of 10c per script I just paid 10,000 caps for Junk I'm going to re script.
---
Great thank you that pie will be mine 🤪🤪
---
Nice one - thumbs up 👍
---
Oh our way is by far from easy (sometimes not feasible) ..but we love to fool around in our camps and just wanted to let u know there how we stopped the half health bars.  That's all.
---
No problem! I hope it works for you!
---
Well if you want more of a penalty take off class freak and don’t use strange in numbers. Maybe that will give you more “realism” because the penalties you can feel a bit more without those.
---
Yes I also have a lot less lag on my private world and smoother gameplay on my private worlds. It’s just these crashes/freezes which happen at least a few times a day that really annoy me.
---
Ok thanks :)
---
You forgot lead and if cheap enough steel sells
---
Or a fusion generator “skin” that’s a smaller object. 😭
---
I also sell a decent amount of Copper and Aluminum, not as much as Acid, Adhesive, Lead, Ballistic Fiber, Screws, Springs.
---
Totally agree. Especially considering the majority of their revenue stream comes from microtransactions at this point they wouldn't be losing nearly as much as they'd be making from the F2P model. Even getting 76 on sale isn't a decent enough price point for some people. And even more so to the people that stick around post lvl 50 because that's when the bugs really start to pile up and outshine the fun they've had thus far. 
---
I paid $60 for this at launch and, while I had a blast for the first stretch, I've started to feel more and more like I may have overspent on this one.
---
Even better
---
I price them at 5 caps each, same for Springs
---
Hmm that really sucks my man 😬 I never experience anything like that.
---
However, I play on a standard PS4 (which you would think has shittier performance than PS4 pro, but this isn't the first time I've heard of pro users encountering more issues than standard).
---
I'm also wondering if it might have to do with your region? I'm not all that tech savvy so not sure if that could have any effect. But I am located in eastern u.s.
---
I need something to haul my backwoods bungalow. :)
---
So this is what i ended up doing if anyone wonders:1- I got a Ghoul slayer explosive light machine gun that i kept it for a long time for some reason. I took that with me to the burrows. Its really fast and small explosions do pretty good damage. I tried body and leg shots, but the tough ones eventually manage to reach me, and in close range, i cant use that gun, but its a really good weapon to keep "rough-skins" away.
---
2- I picked the Pain train perk again, anytime i got cornered or ganged up on, i just ran thru the horde and get to a safety. I take some damage but with mutations that give damage to the melee attackers, combined with the pain train is pretty effective. This made things much easier, i could knock them down, and shoot while they stumble, and more importantly, i can use stimpacks if i deem necessary.
---
3- This is very surprising to me (in a sense that since fo4) i forgot that ghouls really have weak legs. For some stupid reason i made a habit of shooting them in the head. Breaking that habit, combined with Instigating Lever Action Rifle, with a sneak crit mostly kills them, and if they start coming close i can VATs spam their legs, and if i get lucky and my AP refills, i can crit them in vats as well. Rarely this fails too (some dumb metal or wood railing or wall with bulky hitpoints) I can switch to a Vampire 10MM while running away Pain Train'ing them, and gain a little HP while spray their legs. Or if i get too upset, with lots of AP, i can VATs their legs with my Furious Shotgun. 2-3 leg shots usually finishes even those damn charred ghouls.
---
Im probabbly using too many guns, However, i must say, sometimes it feels like these dungeons or AI's just go berserk time to time. And I feel like they were kinda calm in this visit.
---
Wait until Wastelanders comes out and then see if you like it more or less than you did previously.
---
Just realized I have at least two winning sweepstakes tickets in my backpack. Where to I collect my prizes?
---
What’s a good price for rad shield? I sell it at 40c per and after I was cleaned out a couple times my latest batch just sits.
---
Incendiary is on the perfect storm 10mm SMG quest reward. That's it tho. Idk why they didnt add it as a normal legendary. Would rather incendiary than nocturnal ffs
---
The game is fun to play alone but the story is pretty meh. Some cool moments but you’ll end up not caring about the overall narrative. Lots of lore and holo tapes though if that’s your thing.
---
Are all DLC for fallout 76 free?
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
True, add that to the list. :P
---
not sure about plasma and incensiary (incensiary is technically in the game on the perfect storm weapon) but i assume frost would have been complicated because it would be overpowered in pvp
---
Yes all post launch content is free excluding atomic shop items but occasionally they will give out free items from the store.
---
That’s very good I’d say!
---
I put a switch on the rockets to turn off and on to reset and also for Devon shower that seems to also act up by not working just hit switch and works again
---
That’s pretty in depth, thanks! I’ll take a look at it right away!
---
This has never happened to me but i saw couple of people having this issue in the game.  
---
Missile turrets can really make it annoying. whole lot of shaking going on
---
My incendiary minigun in F4 was fun as! Was like a shower of fire.
---
All i want is a 1x1, possibly corner piece stairs...  
---
And ability to build or remove whatever piece i want, regardless of accessibility
---
Double xp kicked it off in my friends group. We started new characters and then another and another. I’m having a blast running around trying to survive all over again. This time with decent armor, guns, and mutations. It’s a much different game when you’re well equipped, or as well as you can be at a low level, and actually have a pretty good idea what you’re doing.
---
Well I’ve decided to purchase it, since it was on sale! I hope I don’t regret it!
---
Do you happen to have a link to a sniper build by any chance?
---
THIS. A corner 1x1x1 piece with some spiral or 90 degree stairs would be good too.
---
Yes I do have level 2 starched Gene's I turn them on for the shower but off when I get rads.
---
As long as you go in with an open mind you should enjoy it, especially if you liked fallout 4.
---
I have a lotta fun with the game but I'll never lie to myself and say the amount of bugs is cool or whatever. I mean it's still a full priced product that needs to be held to quality standards.
---
Is it somewhere confirmed that Wastelanders will be free?
---
I mean, everyone assumed modding and private worlds to be free as well not long ago...
---
I just bought it for a friend for $8 in redbox. Started a new character and we are going through the missions. Sure the game has bugs, it is bethesda after all, but I still enjoy it quite a bit. If I ever got bored with adventure I just play NW. And vice versa.
---
Yep I remember from when I started the game
---
They are busy licking their bums
---
Even with them all equipped, you're still going to get diseases from ghouls and Scorched. I ended up using different perks. They're a waste.
---
...fair point
---
I dont really think this is a melee only issue. similar thing happens to me with my guns. Its just that servers i think have low tick rate. I shoot something, i see health go very low, only to back up and go high.
---
Speed demon already does something like 20%, that's already enough to make things look weird and cause desync for players and animations.
---
frost is datamined in the files, heres to hoping its the next raid reward
---
I think it depends what you get the most diseases from, personally I find I get 90% of the from animals
---
But also if you don't want to use disease cures all the time, there a water fountain at the whitespring that cures diseases
---
Travel to the golf club, walk cross the tennis court, go to the stone pavilion thing with a statue on top and the fountain is on the wall
---
I never heard of losing mutation with that card on, I learn something new every day.  Oh and if ur on xbox, I have serums really cheap if u would rather go that route.
---
Didn’t even receive my Atoms for the second month yet lol, it’s been 4 days since the renewal.
---
I thought the same thing when I read it. Lots of good detail in there. 
---
For me, I still until today like roaming and crafting in FO4. FO76 can be played just like.
---
I loved fallout 4 against what people said, thought it was a fine game. Sure, not like New Vegas or even Fallout 3, but good nonetheless
---
Do it! Figure out if you like it, not what everyone thinks.  There are some bitter people out there.
---
Those effects will be coming with 4th and 5th star effects sometime in the future.
---
No. someone was wrote scenery to this game after drugs...
---
Have you tried to Restart the Xbox?
---
That will be my thing then, hahaha!
---
Inside the hotel, not the train station. I believe Watoga also sells them
---
If you enjoyed 4 and want a wonderful and huge world to explore you will have a lot of fun. Cause that’s the way I experience FO76 at the moment. Tbh I don’t really miss the humans, the robots are fine as well and the scenery makes up for that. The moment I left the vault and looked into the hills of Appalachia I was hooked.  And when you then set foot into Ash Heap and travel into the burning mine, radio plays Ring of Fire, tell me that it wasn’t worth.  There are lots of stories, events and hidden little information everywhere to dive into.
---
If that is the case wouldn't an explosive frost gun technically be able to drop?
---
Only time will tell I suppose.
---
You might have to try a complete reinstall.
---
I checked the hotel. No go. That’s where I remembered them too
---
I've given up even looking for legendary drops, if they happen fine, I usually drop them then and there to save some weight. 
---
I have a few nice weapons and a mixed unyielding armor kit, I'm set. he purveyor gives scrip garbage so don't go there anymore. I play for reasons other than this legendary grind cycle.
---
But I need something to spend caps on so if I could buy scrip to give items within a defined group (enough of limb damage STILL! and all the useless effects) I would do that I guess.
---
Haven't checked the records since a while but I think that would be possible.
---
I got the mutation again, when I first got it I was just getting more toxic water while in the shower to lose the vegetarian mutation and I got marsupial while the showers where on and then lost it so I didnt have the perk on yet.
---
It’s a glitch, they’re probably working on it
---
High END affects the disease resistance. Best thing to do imo is running Plague Walker mutation. Oh crap I'm sick, eat shit damn scorched!
---
What 5 caps for 1 screw and they sell ???
---
Not with that attitude.
---
Will you lose everything if you do that?
---
Also I read somewhere that Plague Walker give you disease easily, that's wrong.
---
&gt;I just turned in a little under a thousand script and literally got nothing of value.
---
Did that recently, leaves a bad taste in my mouth, this game seems designed to do that in many ways. Now I don't bother with scrip or legendary farming any more, that is quite a relief to be honest.
---
That's what happened with my level 7 character, saw two red eyes staring at me on the way to Charleston and it was mothman, as I got closer he shot off like a rocket and disappeared. 
---
That's the first and only time I've seen him.
---
Carry disease cures. That’s what most others say
---
We ran into a technical issue where the exclusive discounts were applying to everyone instead of just our beloved and appreciated Fallout 1st members. This is gonna require a few months of intensive programming and QA testing, so please buy another month of Fallout 1st to support us. We promise to give you double discounts at some point maybe. Thank you.
---
Perfect Storm lvl 50 was damn good to me until I found a Bloodied 10mm sub.
---
What plans are you wanting?
---
&gt;There are some bitter people out there.
---
They are the bag people, they walk with a bell and infect others through their misery and toxic fumes.
---
That is a resounding yes !!! Play it like you mean it and you will definitely not be disappointed
---
Or in build mode have walls that are half the size horizontally.
---
If you're on console you'll lose your photos but your character is saved on Bethesda servers and should all still be there
---
Well, when I stopped playing, every time you would claim a workshop, it would seemingly crash within 5 mins of successfully claiming it
---
Coming from FO4, I've gotten hundreds of hours of fun from it, and that was just adventure mode. I quit playing it when NW came out (the games battle royale mode). Despite the controversies, this game is a great value in terms of hours of fun per dollar spent. Plus, there will soon be a free massive DLC coming soon, Wastelanders.
---
Or that plushie mothman backpack ;)
---
This right here is why 76 needs to move to a Free to Play model like Destiny 2 did. If only 1 in 20 sticks around, eventually the game will die off. With a free to play model, people who would have not normally considered playing would give it a try and like it, allowing for a larger player base and potentially more revenue for Bethesda. It's a win win.
---
But you also haven’t offered any examples yourself?
---
It's strange that Shielded Casual Underarmour Plan is so damn rare considering most, if not all the atom shop underarmours are casual.
---
I agree.
---
No, lets have a mothman dart board &amp; we'll throw poisoned lightbulbs at the creepy, furry, freak-faced mothy git
---
Is 20 dollars ok
---
Agreed. My camp isn’t that big and quite simple but once you start displaying a few things, that space goes away quickly.
---
I’ve got everything but raider.  It refuses to drop for me.  I’ve done Uranium and Path to Enlightenment hundreds of times.
---
Oddly, it’s the one I use most with three stealth characters.
---
No.
---
Contact them, if not, dispute the charge with your creditor. 
---
Would have been easier if you did monthly.
---
Gears sell decent
---
Copper
---
Crystal
---
I had the same issue in the BOS event at the Asylium. I repaired the laser turrets but one of them was targeting me after I got hit by it accidentally (I was between it and a scorched).
---
Or a new outfit or emotes, as we were promised
---
You bet ! Lick's lips*
---
Just have a permanent 2 disease cure/antibiotics in your bag and stock pile the rest you pick up catching anything funky won't make any difference then
---
Yep, combat. And long barrel and many other perks to make it even more effective
---
Fallout 4 was initially a very disappointing purchase for me, but I'll be damned if Far Harbor didn't redeem itself.
---
I buy lots of lead. Im too lazy to farm it. Lol.
---
[https://imgflip.com/i/3i2tdo](https://imgflip.com/i/3i2tdo)

They always runs away from me when i stand on a ledge. Is there a certain spot to stand?
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Basically, think about all the things youre regularly hunting. Thats whats going to sell. Anything to make and mod guns or ammo is a great place to start. Followed by the mats needed for rad showers and fusion generators. Then your legendaries. 
---
So as far as junk goes, im usually looking to buy/selling stuff like.... Steel... Copper... Crystal.... Plastic... Gears.... Screws.... Springs...lead....ballistic fibre.....antiseptic.... Acid... Adhesive... Ultricite scrap.... Any stable flux.... Inert flux...
---
Also ive noticed if you keep the IV bags and stuff of that nature and sell them as they are instead of scrapping them, med suppliers buy those up quick too.
---
Thanks.
---
I can get on rn
---
“Rubber banding” as I’ve heard it mentioned. This has been problem for a while now on shotguns. I switched out bloodied shotguns for bloodied melee and kept getting destroyed. I don’t know how you melee players stay alive so well. I switched back to shotguns.
---
id wait til it goes on sale...unless u cant lol.  No human npcs (not that it bothered me) til Jan...dont expect much of any rpg aspects other than leveling up.  The map can be fun to explore if you like americna/countryside/tourism setting.  There are side quests to do but u have to actually be willing to explore and pick up/read items.  The voice acting imo have been pretty good to listen to so ive actually enjoyed listening to the holotapes whereas before in prev installments id generally avoid them.  There is open pvp but u can turn on a pacifist mode, but if someone steals the junkyard u obtained then itll turn on pvp for u.   There are many bugs and glitches and server issues, especially after updates.  All in all ive personally had fun, but thats coz I enjoyed the map, luv exploring w.o shit telling me where to go, and I just love junk hoarding.  There are repeatable open events as well.   Replay value hasn't been that high for me compared to my personal experiences with prev installments also tho.  Ive leveled one past 100 and there isnt alot of incentive for me to level the other toons I've made.  Survival mode is always on so I hae to eat and drink, plus some food and drinks expire and can have rad.  I honestly dont think it's too hard, as not only am I not into survival games I kinda suck at them.  If I can do it, it shouldn't be too hard, at least I think so.
---
Every piece of junk i sell is 1 cap a piece. Every round of ammo is 1 cap a piece. 
---
1 star legendaries are 200 caps.... 2 stars are 350 caps... 3 stars are 500 caps... 
---
Meds vary from 10 to 30 caps. 30 caps for stimpack diffusers and super stims.
---
Non legendary armor and guns are all 50 caps or less. Even rarer outfits. 
---
Food is all 1 or 2 caps a piece, water is free. 
---
.38 and 10mm and energy weapon ammo is all free except the cores.
---
Thanks for your answer! I’m a huge fan of Bethesda and their games, although Zenimax has their hands on many games as well. Fallout has a special place in my heart and there was something there that told me “you haven’t played fallout 76 yet, probably about time you do it”. I hope I have fun, honestly!
---
What do people use crystal for?
---
I paid $10 for it at Best Buy and am already second guessing that expenditure.
---
I hope you do too.
---
You seem to be on ps4? Might be because of that because i’ve never experienced this
---
Oh lots of stuff. Lol. Some serums need crystal. Sone outfits need crystal. Decorative stuff here ans there takes crystal. Weapon mods take crystal. Its a ton of stuff. But its also really overlooked until someone needs it. Then they gotta go hunt microscopes and decanters and stuff. Its easier just to buy the crystal from someone else. Nobody usually sells it, and i always needed it, so i started selling it, and now i can barely keep it in stock.
---
I thought the discounts where gonna be on stuff exclusive to fallout 1st members such as the ranger skins and they’ll probs do tent skins as well. Stuff that if you want a chance to buy it you’ll have have fallout 1st??? 
---
That’s why they released the green ranger skin for 500 atoms that was supposed to be fallout 1st members exclusive discount etc....
---
But doesnt bloodied require to run low health to see the benefit?
---
Thanks for the replies everyone. I tested it and you can definitely apply the mods to the small pack, but with much less effectiveness. High capacity on a level 1 small backpack provides -10 DR and -10 ER as well as +15 carry weight. All fractions of the high capacity mod on a standard level 50 pack.
---
Well, I doubt it'd be 20k atoms, that's like $200 lol
---
What?
---
It's coming, the question is when, recently they've added an enclave eyepatch alongside other ones for various factions:
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/601477315825762334/650472514425847827/unknown.png
---
Because its a camp. Not a settlement.
---
You think it’s that bad? Hahahaa
---
I totally encase my generator and put my camp module in the little bit of remaining space
---
Yeah, where's our Frank Horrigan power armor skin
---
Outside of Bloodied or Junkies primed your best bet is to Prime a Zealots weapon for SQB fights.  I don't heavy weapon so not sure what base weapon to suggest.
---
 Faster fire rate is much better than Explosive VS queen since she has a very high explosive resistance.
---
Use the contractor perk allows you to put more stuff in the same budget fully leveled though
---
You can turn it will regester after you jump tho.
---
I thought SBs are animals, not scorched ???
---
I'm surprised at how much I like this idea. Would be a good challenge and a fun drop.
---
You sure, pretty sure it just makes things cost fewer resources
---
I recently started observing players before doing a big drop of free stuff. If they're just goofing off, attacking every other player they see, etc I'll just move along. The stuff would be wasted on them. I'd rather give free stuff to players who are actually playing the game and will put the stuff to good use.
---
Two primary reasons: Game performance (lots of big camps would slow it down), and camps were added to the game somewhat last minute, according to Bethesda. 
---
 [Here's a thread I made recently to help manage the small budget.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e3is4i/camp_budget_guide_how_to_make_the_most_of_your/) Hope it helps!
---
Thx 👍
---
The SBQ is both an animal and a scorched.
---
That was my experiences as well.
---
I ran out recently, that made me think of the perks.
---
GIVE US A GOOD GAME
---
RNG be like that.  I have received several very good weapons and armor recently.
---
Tried it once solo on easy, died quick. Found a random lurking around the vault, teamed up died pretty quick. That was the first week they started. Haven’t been back there since. Doesn’t seem like a fun experience alone and I don’t have friends that play either.
---
But there aren't any settlements in Fallout 76. And it's supposed to be our home.
---
Do priests use incensiary bullets?
---
Not sure yet. Have any?
---
Thank you very much. It definitely will help me
---
Yeah, you get diseases just being near them anyway, there's no way to avoid it with perks, just carry antibiotics everywhere. You'll just go afk to piss and come back your character has a disease cuz you weren't looking lol what's the point
---
No. Its supposed to be your camp. You could argue that if you are a fallout 1st member, but then id just say upgrade your plans. Every tome you upgrade to a new building material, your walls and roofs cost a lil less.
---
It’s called enclave for a reason.
---
That's what I thought 3 nights ago though I got given the same advice I've just given here and took the leap scrapped my whole camp and rebuilt from scratch with that perk equipped I made my camp bigger with more decoration and I've still got budget left I should say my original camp was a smidge off 100 % before I got to demolishing
---
I got so far and I was like holy shit it's working checking my budget every few things lol
---
You can run bloodied at 50% and still get good dps
---
I think both.  I used a Primed ZFFR25 on her for quite a while and I was getting the kind of damage I expected vs a standard Bloodied handmade.  I have read that both work on her.  I have not done super rigorous testing.
---
If I want anything in the game I'll have to buy it and I'm not going to spend anymore money on the game. I guess for $10 it was alright but I'm glad I never bought it last Black Friday when it was $40. It seems the online aspect ruined some of the game for me; you can't pause to take a stimpak anymore and VATS is in real time. It just generally feels off too. When things were wonky before at least you could blame it on your own machine and if the framerate slowed the whole game slowed and loaded eventually; with a network issue it's not like that and all of a sudden when things catch up, they just jump out at you instead of loading slower.. therefore the whole feel of the game is different. I also don't see the graphics as being so much better, as claimed. Then again I've spent more time updating and installing it than I have playing it but I can see why the players of the previous games were choked. I played Fallout 3, New Vegas, and Fallout 4 and loved them all and waited an entire year to play this until it was $10! Maybe it was a mistake in some sense as most other players have an entire year on me.
---
That sounds like the mysterious stranger perk (luck)
---
Berserker is weird, sacrificing all armor slots, legendary effects you could get as well as damage resistance perks and mutations for a damage boost that wearing only half the stuff would provide for melee builds.
---
Would make more sense if it was counting armor pieces, giving a flat +10% for each armor slot that is free.
---
Even then it would probably not be worth it.
---
Unless weightless was counted.
---
Same thing happened to me. Apparently they process your payment two days before your actual renewal date; but I still had not received my atoms 30 days after my original subscription date so I contacted support and they magically appeared later in the day.
---
Oh ok
---
What's sad is you can't get heavy armour pieces from perv, so I usually just roll ranged weapons. I seem to get nicer stuff at uranium fever but it's guaranteed to not be Max level and SBQ seems to have a 1 in 10 chance to actually drop a 3* /sigh
---
Sorry I see a cat I get ta swinging cat meat steak delicious !!!
---
They are beautiful how did i not know about it? I played the last couple of days of it on deployment and I always look at the rewards, i got that throwing hammer and thought that was it. God im dumb.
---
I figured out that instead of building a large house, I could make a much more interesting open roof fortress using blast walls. Maybe it would work for u
---
No I don’t. Sorry.
---
How about fix the massive lag during SE when some asshole uses a mini gun with strangler armor
---
I'd go as far as to say that some people are so self centered that they don't even understand that they are the asshole in any situation. Letting people get a shot in on legendaries is fine, but I'm not standing there getting beat on so someone can get XP off a level 24 mirelurk
---
Yes if you enjoyed the other fallouts then you will enjoy this aswell order of the day more of the same please
---
Yeah I’ll wait the typical 7 business days and contact support if nothing comes up.
---
By the way you missed out on the $10 Best Buy price but it's still $12 at Gamestop.
---
Do you want a level 15 or 25? I will hold one aside
---
Yes it would be
---
Just craft ya a bunch of disease cures. I get a disease every time I log in.
---
There is single player just don't team up with anyone and there you have it just like magic s.i.n.g.l.e player yay !!!
---
Why are you active in r/LSD
---
I’m Portuguese, and I don’t think there’s a “Best Buy” around, hahahaha. I did buy it for 20€ though, and it had a huge sale. Well, not huge, but a pretty big one!
---
I'll be giving away some secrets here, but this is what I do:

Rare plans (s'mores, jet pack, cuckoo clock, etc.) never more than 500 caps
---
Cassette games 350 caps +
---
Robot parts models 350 caps
---
Nuka cola variations (wild, grape, dark, etc.) 50 caps
---
What I don't sell: chems (not much of a market), screws (never have enough), nuclear waste (never have enough), food (spoils before it sells), Most plans (common ones, everybody already has them), non-legendary weapons and armor (don't sell for enough to offset weight/time in vendor), common scrap like leather, cloth, etc (nobody cares), purified water (people can grab from my purifiers for free).
---
Eh, that could be dangerous. I'd definitely go for a slider bar for a craft amount.
---
About tree fiddy...
---
none, this game is profiting on whales and i don't see why anyone is still playing this game despite players being stabbed in the back more times than caesar
---
Some armor mods, like dense or BoS are only available via purchase afik. If you want a certain mod, ask. I'd do most for free, but I don't know all of them. Dense armor mods are rare enough that you may need to pay for them. Weapon mods not as much.
---
I really enjoyed the cooking one. Did it just this past week on my main who has been a possum for a while.
---
Could be a better option yeah
---
You already bought it, you might experience a honey moon phase but soon enough it will vanish leaving you with nothing but frustration.
---
I will try it out. Thank you for the tip
---
That's 3x what I paid for it.. wouldn't have paid that much to be honest lol.
---
Lol probably

Checked your ISP?
---
Vats don't spot you if you're crouched, no weapon and invisible. Even if you're just invisible or just crouched vats can't target you like that.
---
Idk if Berry mentats are in NW, but imo you've just been spotted by someone with a good sight, or you chameleon wasn't working. Some people don't appear invisible in cham'. Not my case but some has reported it.
---
I’m hoping this game to be like Red Dead 2 and become better over time. In any case, info hate this game, it’s probably the last time I’ll swing cash in front of Bethesda.
---
I haven't got Fallout 1st. I'm too poor.
---
I will upgrade them. Didn't know they cost less.
---
Thank you for the advice
---
You got me.
---
I got the game and a steel book for $9.99.  Buuut, I have DSL so it won’t finishing downloading until 2nd week of December XD
---
Its not a sizeable difference. But ive noticed it.
---
I agree, especially since it serves as the scenario for RDR1, which, chronologically, comes after RDR2. Still, they did a good job showing us the new parts of the map, filling them with loads of things to see and do. I paid a good sum of money when I bought the game, since I bought it almost on release, and the online portion was a complete mess! I bought it for the online gameplay, mostly, and was hugely disappointed. Let’s hope this isn’t the case, haha!
---
First of all fix the Game
---
I downvoted you just because you're a presumptuous asshat
---
I'm guessing there is supposed to be one that is "captured" rather than killed for one of the events. If no one does the event, he just sticks around. And if the even keeps popping up and being ignored, the Malones just accumulate lol
---
Still, with the good perks and build, it's not that big of a deal. 10mm rate of fire is so high that you melt things quickly. At 20% health and nerd rage I one shot all ghouls and scorched in the head you can go below for more damage, but you don't need to be that low to see benefits from bloodied, to make it viable you just want more than 50% more damage at 60% or less of your health, which is the cap for junkies and berserker. Tougher ennemies take a few more bullets. Scorchbeast are not a problem too, anti explosion torso mod and anti explosion perk, and all you have to deal is the damage frombyour bloodied not always applied in vats. Otherwise one burst in a head crit vats can take a huge amount of a SB.
---
Because they were honest and they DID offer an exclusive discount, but people will look for any excuse to bitch about Bethesda.   Everyone here has decided to conveniently forget about the Ranger armor reskins that they put up in the shop at a discounted price exclusively for 1st members, which people then whined should have been free so Bethesda gave the fucking things away for free as a PR move... and now we have people bitching that they didn't find more stuff to throw at 1st members.
---
Keep downvoting the truth people.  Just because the discounted item wasn't what you expected or something you wanted or was something you thought you should have gotten for free (and eventually did) doesn't change the fact they DID offer a discount that was exclusive to 1st members.  They NEVER specified what form this discount would take and just because you expected slashed prices across the board on atom shop items and instead got a price cut on a reskin doesn't change the fact that it existed.
---
Imagine making melee focused games for 20 years and still not getting melee right, hell Skyrim 8 years ago had better melee.
---
It's got something to do with server lag, but I just don't understand how an enemy can bleed, stagger and have damage numbers pop up yet receive no damage?
---
Welp they don't seem to be able to do anything on time, so i really don't expect much from them anymore in this regard. With thanksgiving and the managements lack of giving fucks, what can anyone really expect. Though them giving me 3-4 days extra sub for the first month was a positive, 8).
---
Let me stress one thing, the guys working the front lines in that i've ever had to deal with, despite the canned responses, have been great. THeir bosses can suck a bag of dicks, but kudos to anyone who works support for Beth. THey gotta feel a bit suicidal working for such fucktards, but they tough it out to pay the bills.
---
I do only leave one Level 15 and one Level 25 in the vending at a time, so if you do need one and it's empty just message me, as long as I have steel, I can make you one for free, bring steel in case I'm out though.
---
Ave
---
Yes, that's exactly what I meant but I didn't got it in words, I'm from Germany and my English isn't he best.
---
Fairs I did think this but with how long it’s taking and the stuff with the ranger skin I thought it would be that. Thanks
---
Haven't played single player games since 2012
---
I’ve nuked WS a bunch on private and yea, have to reload to spawn the enemies. No idea why.
---
If you think people spending $12 a month on 1st is whaling then god help you if you ever find your way into a mobile gatcha game because your head would explode.
---
If you want an atom shop simulator for sure this game excels at selling you items other games give for free.  If you want a rewarding experience made by devs who love the craft and first priority is playerbase then....no sorry
---
Worth it!  It never fails, I know the plan but no death claws saved when I need the third claw.  They don't cost much even at a bot vendor and increases the damage.
---
I like the word presumptuous, you don't see that one used as often.
---
You think they would fix that
---
I haven’t smelted anything in maybe two weeks. I have crafted a bunch of serums. Maybe one of those uses acid. Obviously it’s something I’m doing.
---
When games disappoint me, I stop playing.  I don’t even post about it. It gets no more of my time at all. Maybe I’m weird like that.
---
Sweet! How do you get that Enclave tag by your name?
---
Where and when did you find the plan?
---
I have done no real testing, but when it starts getting buggy I switch from my massive dmg unarmed weapons, to some of my random bloodied 1 or 2hand melee i keep for trash clearing, seems having to process the massive dmg is what causes it not to register
---
i see no problem in doing so however i think it isnt worth it except for nukezones possibly
---
but back to your question,
---
as junkies build need no perkcards and unyielding armor can easily counter your addictions i think it wouldnt be too much of a problem
---
only possible problem i see is that when you swap from bloodied to junkies you may be overencumbered
---
overall id still say its not really worth it and youd probably be better of just choosing one of the playstyles
---
True but out of PA, I love my death claw gaunlet and just have all rise when in PA
---
Oh shit is there a post about this I’d like to look at the other faction patches
---
Any event in the savage divide and all Mr. Messenger have a very very narrow chance to drop them. You can re skin an urban mask at a armor bench to have forest paint.
---
No it makes things cost less materials to build
---
As much as I like to see new players, playing for single player should be on hold until npcs come out. Unless you absolutely enjoy listening to holotapes and reading notes, don't buy it yet.
---
Can you? Never knew that one, cheers
---
Dumb
---
Off it took me a while to find this post again.  Can you tell me a fast way to rack up wood? There must be a way to speed things up. I did the 7600 in social in just a few hoirs with my blueprint method.
---
For normal trash mobs yeah, not going to get whooped on.  Might possibly do it if there are some low level players there who obviously could use the xp.  I generally don't really care if I get the legendaries to begin with, I can only use so many stalkers rolling pins in my life.  It's just the kind of people who show up to something like one violent night and smoke the wendigo in 2 seconds that I have a hard time believing don't know that they are being an ass when 10 people showed up to the event.  Do they think everyone showed up just to bear witness to their glory?
---
I have done this myself 3 days ago it works
---
I never understand the meta of the builds, what stacks, what perks are mutual between the two builds.
---
Thats great, I'm gonna start griefing more in the hopes of closing more camps :)
---
I think from scrapping death claws in the past.  I will scrap anything, lol
---
I have noticed lately that my turrets are red to me which never used to happen. Just recently now....
---
Took those screenshots myself in Nifskope, here's the rest:

Wew lad, this reaks of cringe. No but seriously tesla fights are absolutely boring. Bring back the sights and cover fights.
---
If you are talking about collecting wood 7600 times, I never found a way to increase the challenge with more than 1 step for each time I collected wood from a wood source. The best method I figured out was to memorize a few locations with many wood piles, collect from every one of them, then wait for the cooldown period to pass, which may be 2-3 hours, and might need a restart.
---
I have noticed mine have been red to me when I return to camp, this is just recently they have been doing this....
---
And if team members 2,3 and 4 want to join and it's already full? To prevent that they'd need to hold 3 additional slots.
---
You are so cool. Thank you.
---
&gt; You hear me Bethesda, I have money and I'm willing to spend it
---
Don't tell them that; they'll lock more features behind paywalls!
---
I had someone 100 levels below me yelling in area chat that I was a “retard” for stalling the event in this way.
---
I hope so
---
What is SBC?
---
7 business days? That reaks of greed.
---
Doesnt the forrest just somethimes spawn with the wrong paint? Dont think you are able to turn an urban into a forrest.
---
It’s called the gutter.
---
it can be modified for an electrical charge
---
And not to be an ass, but he/she isnt asking whether its good or not, just if its worth the time to scrap and learn or just buy the mod. Even if you could learn the mod from scrapping, which you cant, the mod at Pleasant valley for 50 caps is definitely better for the worth of it.
---
Yea, it stays. I was just saying that the actual forrest scout mask doesnt allow you to wear hats like you can with the urban. Its better to get an urban and paint it so you can wear a hat with it.
---
r/lostredditors   
---
By the factual nature of your comment, I assume you’re looking for something like r/fo76.   
---
Due to an error in both the mobile app and the browser version of reddit, anytime you try to view r/fo76, you are redirected to r/gulliblerageechochamber. You might as well give up. You’re never going to win against the trolls with their victims who eat it up and regurgitate everything the trolls feed them.    
---
On a more realistic note, your comment is just going to get lost because a copycat complaint post will be reposted in a few hours for those sweet, sweet rage upvotes. Then, a YouTuber, who hasn’t played the game since launch, will pick it up, make a video about it for those sweet, sweet, rage views. The cycle will then repeat as viewers rush to reddit to repost it for those sweet, sweet rage upvotes.
---
They also have that secret service armour coming too
---
I read somewhere they are bringing out an enclave secret service armour at some point
---
Oh dang, that's really sick!
---
Yea and that was great that beth did that, but the way they worded it was items everyone could get but at a lower cost of atoms for subscribers.
---
PS4 has remote play access, playing on your phone is a little rough but some can use controllers via bluetooth or whatever
---
I forgot to mention that they had a bunch of paranormal investigators and bigfoot enthusiasts doing interviews at their local theater too. And if you always get bored, if you head North to Weston you can visit the Trans Allegheny Lunatic Asylum, in between you'll pass through Flatwoods if you want a pic with the Flatwoods monster sign, and if you head (I think) east of Charleston you can visit this place where everything is side ways, but it's balanced, called the Mystery Hole. Pretty much every spooky oddity in West Virginia is an hour of Charleston.
---
It Does indeed have vampire healing
---
Aim bot; vats doesn't work on invisible or crouched players.
---
Sooo..what are some solo end game activities?
---
The vault raid in general is ridiculous.
---
No, I got your point, I just elaborated a bit why what you suggested was a good idea :)
---
Is it "getting someone" if I bring up the fact that the holotapes in 76 have more emotion than the lifeless dead NPCs in FNV?
---
No westtek grants far more legendaries per time spent
---
Took me about a month.  Once you reach level 100.. everything seems so pretty.  Just wish there was a way to do a massive special stat switch at once. Not one point per level.
---
I’ve noted the skull on one of the radscorpions as well.
---
Yes kind of like that a mix of non humans that are civilized in one society
---
Nope that’s just stating fact.
---
Oh crazy, dont happen to have a pic, do you? Wonder if it's just a "wretched" thing
---
Scrip.  Scrip.  Scripppppppppppppppppppppp.  No "t" at the end.
---
Scrip is a currency that was widely used in the coal towns in WV.  Scrip is what the Purveyor uses.  
---
A script is something else entirely.
---
Yup, much more, check my post history.
---
We're in the NW of SC which is relatively close!

No

Thanks for this, hope you don't mind used as a citation for this patches roundup.

[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 15.0 | 11/19/209 Fallout 1st &amp; Atomic Shop love](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dywtko/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/)
---
Also a heads up: You need to login using using the Bethesda client for it to update atoms.
---
I'm usually running the game without the launcher and my atoms didn't show before i used the launcher.
---
No games are buying it?  
---
Were you under the impression that Castlevania would randomly pop up in Watoga and buy some junk off you?
---
You can find the plan off of Grahm
---
Cool. Thanks.
---
This. On top of this, it should be free. On top of that, it should be a Cultist Faction NPC Reward. On top of that, said NPC must be 125% GOTH.
---
I refresh every 2-3 hours and haven’t had the issue again so far
---
Mine too.  But then it hits a second later and NO health bar change.
---
Two problems.  Together making Melee ridiculously hard to play.
---
Just canceled my sub. Tried it out for a month. Doesn't seem worth it.
---
It’s called mirror ball
---
In most MMOs I refuse offers like this.
---
I know it's meant well, but it's kinda taking out the fun and accomplishment of the game.
---
It feels so rewarding if you finally looted, crafted or somehow got a new piece of gear, even if it's pretty noobish stuff.
---
Instead, just getting handed a full set of gear and utilities from a high level player feels like "Well, thanks. Now, what to aim for now?"
---
I couldn’t remember the exact name.
---
It's really odd, these would have made fantastic 2nd or 3rd legendary effects
---
great thought!
---
Well..because.. uh... your supposed.. to... uh.. make the factions yourself.. and..uh. roleplay.  (Sarcasm)
---
Not sure why.  I guess they were trying to create one with the pvp settings at launch.  But because of damage scaling with guns.  It didn't work out.  Because pvp became TSE or death.  And now its bloodied or death from what I am hearing.
---
They are in game scamming now. They just beg for caps pretending not to be able to afford things. Or they are pretending to have fun dying in pvp battles making sure YOU die so you lose caps
---
Happening to me a few times recently .
---
Camp was half demolished when I returned from wastelanding.
---
Last time I showed up and witnessed my missile launchers try to down BOS
---
Vertibots or whatever they are called.
---
It was fun to watch until flying debris starting raining down on me.
---
I just wear the enclave officer uniform
---
Yeah, hopefully that's one of the things they aim to tackle in the wastelanders release of fixes...
---
Yeah, I'm sure wastelanders will be cool and all but I can't help but think it just misses the point of the game completely: multiplayer.
---
I'd really like the game to focus on that: guilds/clans/factions, player settlements, territorial control with NPC invasions, bigger and better public events, some text chat; like, give us shit we can ONLY do in FO76, not some single-consumption quest content with a completely railroaded storyline.
---
What's a yank
---
when I was collecting I paid 50 to 100 caps per star, and collected about 20,000 pounds worth of Legendaries in a couple months   
---
Depends on how fast you want to sell or have things bought
---
Light machine gun
---
Grahm says no meat for you until you spell his name correctly.
---
Oh yea sorry trying to wrangle up the rugrats and just skimmed it lol. That’s what I did with a combat helmet and it looks ok other than some clipping.
---
Small Block Chevy.
---
OP must've been on the Reddit app and had SBQ autocorrected to "SBC".
---
Sorry it auto corrected
---
True. Im trying again right now we almost lost because robot started walking in circles but the the evacuation phase was too short for us.
---
I want a sheepsqautch plush
---
Why so people can steal your junk easier? I have the guts bag so it blends in with the environment in the bog region or blends in with a bunch of dead ghouls and rotting piles.
---
Never thought about that. I should try that out. I have a green hood i wear with mine, and the same thing. Looks good except for some clipping.
---
Well that would depend, if u want to learn as many plans as possible or get a better melee then.  Either way is good.
---
Agree, the amount of purified water rewarded made things like the water filter useless. What was suposed to be a hard to get priced item ended up as cap fodder. Also, we need water boilers for easier cooking water collection.
---
So y'all found another bug in fallout 76
---
Yeah... nah 😂
---
What are you?
---
Wow dude, it's amazing how some people will just blindly defend a company.
---
By the way, it said exclusive DISCOUNTS not Discount (plural) as you conveniently changed it too further along in your comment so if you want the "truth", the truth is they have yet to offer "discounts" to 1st members.
---
Just keep doing the Tea Time and Swarm of Suiters events every hour. You will meet so many people while doing them lol.
---
When was the last time you went there? They hardly spawn there anymore after the last couple of patches.
---
They don't call em' "Deathskull Radscorpions" for nothing!
---
I have no clue what that means. I'm human I guess
---
I was hoping for player clans and stuff. A rolling game chat.  Something to communicate with other players.  You could build big settlements. Ect..
---
It's a multiplayer solo game
---
I don’t think the plan is available in game, or if it is, the chance to learn it is minute. I’ve scrapped dozens of gauntlets and have never learned it.
---
Fortunately as others have noted, the mod is cheap and common.
---
Edit: missed the commenter who said he knows it. I’ll have to keep on scrapping I guess. :)
---
Games to buggy to even bother,
---
I'm on PS4: Javiirama
---
They really shouldn't have made the vault raids timed, harder difficulties should have made higher level spawns.
---
If you go back and play Fallout 4 you'll see how bad the downgrade in 76 is;
---
Raiders took cover, Assultrons duck and weave through bullets, stuff like that.
---
Fallout 76 A.I seems like it has one objective, "walk towards player"
---
Knowing Bethesda it’ll be made of cardboard
---
Yea I know the BOS hood is rather popular with it as well
---
Personally I think it would be both easier and better to make a new character as opposed to respeccing.  Melee is high str, rifleman will be high per and potentially high luck and/or agi depending on how you want to play the character.  
---
You'd not only have to respec your perks but a lot of SPECIAL ranks.  Unless you have a lot of level ups banked it might take almost as long to make a new character anyway, and the benefits of having multiple characters is pretty large (more scrip per day, can bank up to 30k more caps for high end purchases, etc).  
---
As for how a bloodied rifle plays, they kill everything the very instant they look at them.  Some things like SBQ take a tad longer but it's disgustingly op in PvE.  If you go sneak you will very rarely get detected thanks to +15 agi from unyielding which means you are the opposite of melee - never take damage, never die, except for rare situations.  
---
Also means you have all the same drawbacks so like the vault raids you pretty much need to abandon your build and go in at 60% health, nuke zones you have the normal issues with rads you do as a melee, and you get one shot in pvp or by enemies that hit hard like iss.
---
Cheers man looks like I'm doing Queen of the Hunt more often!
---
Do those count towards the COOOKING recipes challenge tho?
---
So:  
---
800 caps for a 3\* (40 scrip)  
---
300 caps for a 2\* (15 scrip)  
---
100 caps for a 1\* (5 scrip)
---
That's a good idea, separate the player base more and put more features behind the paywall!
---
Today, rng is rng sometimes you get 5 spawns sometimes zero multiple times in a row
---
Bloodied is the worst build to use for pvp... Bloodied is for pve
---
People have been hacking in NW since it launched.
---
My best advice is to block and report those who do this, and move on with your life.  
---
I rarely run into these people these days after blocking all I've come across I just don't show up in their matches any longer.
---
And if you got into the Project Xcloud preview you can stream from your Xbox.
---
Leave your server and join back and it should fix, if there are no legendaries it’s a known bug if there’s still some here and there then it’s just bad rng
---
Because it would cause negative server performance.    
---
Small detailed camps are what this game supports.
---
Thx
---
Any idea what's too much to pay to a player vendor?
---
I never see grahm
---
They do not! We just checked with my fiancee's alt character and she doesnt have any of the aid recipes, but completed the cooking challenge.
---
It is not a bug, they put you there away from decent people, because you disrobed in public. I just bet you worship that flipping moth, or worse, that stupid teddy with the bowtie  #IWasJustTriggeredOrSomething
---
PS4 name is conrat4567
---
pump action and combat shotguns support silencers and thus are best for stealth.  Double barrel has the highest base damage but only holds 2 shells unless it has the quad legendary effect.  
---
As for best?  user preference really.
---
My main currently has around 10 in luck and agility already. I think I have about 5 in perception. Would you still recommend I level up an alt?
---
The whole step of getting boiled water is a pain imo
---
. 
---
I've always got 100+ purified water in my bag, but for all recipes, I've got to go down to the river full of radiation, spam the collect button growing a third arm and 5 more eyes in the process, gather some wood because reasons, spam the boil water combining two parts dirty water to get 50% less boiled water and 50% less wood as well. 
---
All of this work, it may have seemed logical at first, but after a year the recipe is just so damn annoying. Like how can we make small nuclear explosive devices, but we can't find a way to use electricity to boil water? 
---
And why can't we replace boiled water with purified water in all recipes? There's no reason why it can't be done.
---
What they should add is a way to bulk boil water with some sort of contraption, by giving it access to water and electricity. I don't know, something other than the spamfest we do now, that clearly lag out the server.
---
I’ve had good luck recently with 4-5 at the springs being 3* after months of none
---
Yeah. What people consider "whales" in FO76 is not even close to the people the term whales are meant to describe.
---
Most of the people who toss around the term "whales" here, are most likely just people who don't have enough expendable income to be able to spend at the AS. 
---
It's all about what they can't have
---
I got wayyy more tha. 2x i lost 600lbs of stuff but they gave me like 10000 lbs of shit.
---
Same my camp is a Mothman museum
---
[PC] On pc it is happening too. It is driving me mental
---
How much was the Ranger armor price reduced by?
---
Did you know him?
---
Was it mysterious?
---
Name works.
---
Well then maybe I only need the urban one
---
An american, someone from the USA
---
Sometimes it happens though. I've killed legendaries a few times without realizing it. Heart of the swamp can be especially hectic sometimes. 
---
Not defending the guy he could of just not cared but worth considering.
---
I've tried for the few months I've been playing *only 647 hours so far* and have never had anything I could use, all gone back into the machine over several days. But got to not wanting to see that garbage in my inventory so I dumped it or up cheap in my vending machine if I can be bothered.
---
Now I just don't care any more, RNG is fine and all, but it's just drawing from too big of a list of garbage with the few useful items to be functional.
---
it refers to "Yankee doodle dandy" and old song from, I'm guessing, about a 100 years ago. It's a nicer reference then say 'Gringo'.
---
So in short, and it is a shorter way to say it, American. It's with brotherly love for my southern neighbour friends.
---
This seems like such a no brainer for Bethesda, I’d be really surprised if they weren’t working on a companion app to release alongside wastelanders, especially with the perk load out feature being rolled out too.  Just an app with all of the functionality of the in game pip boy, obviously trimmed up a bit (I.E. I don’t see a real reason for the place camp option being present on the app) while keeping the core inventory and perk load out functions so you can swap on the fly, or mess around while out and about.  As new in game features roll out, those could be tied in as well, like whatever faction system they use, maybe an LFG tab, and on and on.
---
Oh, and Todd, you can add the atom shop store front to it and take my Apple Pay too.  Cha-Ching. 
---
TL;DR:  So much potential, why is this not a thing already???!!!
---
I would agree to a point i have been having amazing luck with buying legendaries over the last month all 3 star max level. But yes i have seen crazy prices for 1 and 2 star legendaries.
---
Defensible opinion, but given with no supporting arguments, can be ignored.
---
Edit:  Marmite is quite nice, but to be avoided if you need to keep sodium/salt levels down.
---
GIVE US INGAME CONTENT!
---
They nerfed xp, used to get 1k+ xp for each kill. Got 1-50 over 2 days in the early days
---
Multiple zeroes makes zero. The queen is guaranteed, therefore more, Einstein.
---
You know what I'd love more quests too I have to say when I was even doing that dumb part where you gotta join the army and do the course was actually really fun. It felt like I was working for it. And then those mini quests that they ask you to like to kill scorch beasts or kill a legendary. All of that was great fun.
---
This is the way
---
Or you might play it for over 800 hours.
---
A second floor with no stairs needed. 🤤
---
Nope. You're twisting it to further your claims. 
---
Pluralizing "discount" doesn't necessarily mean you will receive multiple discounts a month 
---
1 discount each month across three months, is still "discounts"
---
You're just trying to nitpick words (I'm sure you've got a "what about people who bought 1st for one month, how do they get discounts not a discount" argument ready to roll)
---
Also, learn the difference between "too" and "to". As soon as you can't tell which one you need to use, I assume you just don't know what you're talking about
---
Then definitely take some time to check it out or just visit Point Pleasent for a day. The museum and statue are always there and open, the Village Pizza Inn always serves a mothman pizza, but it gets extremely packed during the festival. Otherwise the event is usually on a weekend for 2-3 days around the 20th. If you do check it out I hope you have fun!
---
Atomic shop content can be free too.
---
Excuse me, I'm off to play my theramin in my steel bungalow while the collectron gathers some more scrap.
---
Not on atom paid for with money.
---
There are rumors of the Enclave in Wastelanders
---
Should I leave and rejoin ASAP or wait x amount of time for server to reset?
---
Ah yes the mythical wastelanders that will be added into the game as some point in the future
---
I just bought shielded road leathers for 1000 caps. Plans are for selling and caps but we have enough caps as it is.
---
No added content since launch?
---
Well you either outright like to ignore fact (and as such your opinion is worth fuck all) or you're willingly exaggerating a lie (and as such your opinion is worth fuck all)
---
I believe there’s a cool down but I’m not sure what it is
---
You can see this on the communist posters on what looks to be a spider as well.
---
A lil fan theory of mine is that theres various species of bugs that have these markings and it must indicate how poisonous they might actually be or had been. Considering you see it on the poster of the spider, ticks, scorpions, and if you look at the vampiric bloodbugs a certain way, can make out what looks like a skull imo.
---
"Odds &amp; sods". This is a term my father uses quite often. He's from Devonshire England so the "Yank" equivalent is, "Limey".
---
I also hope they do something about the build mode. Sometimes things don’t attach the way they are supposed to. Or maybe better camera angles. Like being able to move the camera around when In build mode. When you add different wallpaper it doesn’t delete everything from that wall inside and out. Annoying if you have individual letters placed on that wall. Having to write it again. Smh so many other things but I doubt it will change.
---
As a fellow pvp raider I agree you don't want bright colored death bags... the guts bag or the default is the way to go if you claim workshops and don't want Raiders taking your junk after they invade
---
I like Fallout 1st. I don’t give a shit whether they offer me discounts or not. The unlimited scrap box, private world, and camp tent fast travel point are alone worth the value. Any discounts that eventually may be offered would just be gravy,
---
&gt; If I want anything in the game I'll have to buy it and I'm not going to spend anymore money on the game.
---
Huh?  What do you think you "have" to buy?
---
Ok, you can't get *everything* in the atom shop for free, but I personally don't want everything in the atom shop, and all the things I do want I got for free.
---
I left and rejoined and the crown boss is still non legendary
---
Wait a little bit then, and the boss isn’t the only thing that can spawn legendary
---
Question how did you get your photo to post? I want to post a photo but it says the Fallout Reddit doesn’t allow photo posts? Thank you 😊
---
I wouldn’t, I also deep pocket everything. How is speed demon? Do you burn through food/water really fast? I’ve been thinking about incorporating that with class freak...
---
I've seen a spiral staircase made out of coffee tables. Looked pretty good.
---
Same here. Never encountered this bug until 3 days ago. Fast traveled back to my camp to find 50% of the turrets destroyed and 2 that showed as hostile. They didn't attack me but I redeployed them anyway. Fixed up my camp and haven't had a problem since.
---
Thankfully none at Bethesda will read this.
---
somebody get this kid a hairbrush...
---
You bought the shielded lining plan or a shielded lining outfit? Either way good job! They're kinda costly in flux so I try to turn a *little* bit of profit
---
Unfortunately it’s random
---
Get your hands on a furious Gatling gun, with reduced weight if you don’t run heavies. Furious adds a damage bonus for each consecutive hit, up to 60% I think. And, large clip size of 500 when upgraded lasts a long time.
---
Was afraid of that. Might start my mutation journey over again.
---
Yeah, I feel your pain man, good luck and may the rng gods  be in your favour
---
I moved to Las Vegas and the surrounding areas are in game, there’s prim on the I:15 with an actual roller coaster on it and good springs and Sloan, I actually take my gun out to Sloan to practice shooting. Real life Sloan is much safer than in game since there aren’t any deathclaws. I still have to make it up to my Charleston to see if Marcus is up there and there’s a cabin full of mutants.
---
I think explosive is a minor legendary effect so the frost would replace it
---
I know you're joking, but it would be no load on the servers at all -- the animation would be client side, see for example scorchbeast death animation.
---
Gees the cooldown is daily as the rest i think. I did 2600 in 1600 hours. This is going to take forever for me.
---
You’ve got to put a link to the image you want to display.
---
The backpack should be wings, I'd flip out at some mothman wings.
---
You can see them in the window here. They think they can get through the wall, and so don't run away. They CAN get through the wall if they glitch through, but mostly they stay on the other side of the window. It's good to stay arms length back, though. https://i.imgur.com/AlsPz0n.png
---
Using this method, I just took out 25 ish ghouls, including a legendary, and didn't get damaged once.
---
Max amount I am willing to spend usually:
---
5 scrip &lt;200c
---
15 scrip &lt;400c
---
40 scrip &lt;1000c
---
I try to stay less than that but that would be the limit of spending just to trash something.
---
Edit: I only spend the max prices when I’m above 20k ish just to blow some caps in case my vendor gets raided and then I don’t lose caps
---
I was thinking more about game mechanics.
---
Better yet, create berserker armor pieces that give huge buffs and avoidance stats with zero armor to compliment the weapons.
---
No, now take this next wave of moth cult shit and like it
---
The end content aims more multiplayer.
---
Most of the game before the end aims single player... you have to read, search, listen, etc. The quests lines themselves mostly suppose you are alone by context.
---
Another stupid comment in a long line of stupid comments.
---
One: Why pay for a subscription when you're getting no new content at all? Well.... Considering that additional exclusive FO1st content was NEVER implied, suggested or hinted at.....
---
Two: if you're not a basement dwelling adult living with your parent. A poor college kid stealing wifi. Or a minimum wage earning,  game sharing, burger flipper with no aspirations? 
---
Then you may be someone with expendable income. Someone who has *gasp* spent some money in the AS with Atoms they purchased, who didn't cry about how free atoms are too hard to earn......
---
And if so? 1st isn't over priced. The atoms included pretty much wash out the price (especially if you're a person who spends 5-10 bucks a month on cosmetics). Plus a private world, free shit and extra discounts?  
---
If you're an unemployed jack off who spends their time playing Fallout? Sure 13 bucks a month may seem over priced. 
---
For those of us who are full time employed? Welllllll that monthly cost? I cover that in less than one hour of work.
---
it'll be the next incentive for F1st
---
I am sorry for those that did considering Bethesda's only interested in them spending money on the shop or through subscription services.
---
1. Usually better to start over than to respec into a more of a defined build depending on your level.
---
2. This is more of a build specific question and depends if you're going to use the character for PvE or PvP primarily. I mostly run bloodied explosive characters but usually don't have them setup properly until mid 40's or later 50's. I have 2 bloodied heavy PA builds and a stealth bloodied commando. Also have a full health sneaky sniper as well. But the bloodied is so OP and can put down a lot very easily. But is a glass cannon so be prepared to stash your junk frequently due to multiple deaths early in the game.
---
3. Which platform are you on? I'm always looking for new people to run and gun with. I'm on PS4 and XB1 and have my builds set up for solo and teams with a simple swap of cards in Charisma.
---
Nice summary! But really though, what significant content has been added? There have been a ton of bug fixes and patches (which are vastly improving the quality of the game, slowly) but other than some new events and small things like the burrows, what has been added?
---
Class freak doesn't effect speed demon. And the increase isn't that bad after you get used to it
---
Amen.  I would start a new character for all the reasons listed by Sly\_1.  Plus, your old character can help the new character with supplies, weapon mods, etc.
---
Start from scratch, use the knowledge you've accumulated, and build a rifle-specific character right from the start.  Personally, I love leveling up a new character.  I have friends that are more than happy to assist with power leveling.  So perhaps my perspective is skewed.  But in the end, you would have two characters with different attributes.  And you can choose which one you feel like playing from day to day.
---
This happened to me on xbox, logged on and 2seconds later dumped off. Even some weird sound with it. Closed the app and re opened, same thing.  I restarted my Xbox, no work. I kept trying then I remembered to clean my cache. Turned my system off and pulled the power cord . Fixed it.
---
All there was the entirety of the Shear Terror quest line...….
---
Then there was also the nukashine/biv quest line.....
---
The burrows......
---
Albeit broken, vault raids.....
---
Yeah, you'll have that at some ppoint in the fucking atomic shop.
---
An exclusive item is not an exclusive discount. There is another section about exclusive items that specifically mention the Ranger outfit. An exclusive discount is an item everyone can buy, but FO1st member can get it at a discounted price. People are "downvoting the truth people" because the "truth people" are simply wrong, and blatantly so.
---
Just a note: if you let your armor break, you'll get the berserker bonus but maintain the armour's legendary effects.
---
On what do you spend all those screws?
---
I have 1000+ at this point.
---
Why should I care what you think Bethesda is interested in?
---
Same here, every time my scrap bot gets in range on his loop around my camp it’s like a mini Hiroshima with the explosions. Other than him they don’t attack anything else
---
It's a subscription service, the plural for discounts implies that they would recur over the months you're subscribed rather than being a one time offer.  Don't try playing semantics if you're going to half ass it.
---
1. What’s the fastest way to level up? I know I’m level 50+ but I’m not on right now to see exactly where. 
---
2. Is pvp a big factor? I most likely would pve and just pvp whenever necessary I have a bloodied handmade and a pump shotgun and I don’t like power armor.
---
3. PS4, that would work for me I need to transfer over quite a few things to this new character also.
---
But then my super duper won’t Proc lol
---
Happened again today -- Watoga robots ashed a legendary SB in mid air.  This time I could find the glowing ash pile -- in mid air, frustratingly out of reach.
---
Well, for one thing, if you were planning a long term, evolving wasteland, introducing official factions immediately doesn't make alot of sense. 
---
They, from launch, talked heavily about "rebuilding Appalachia" which I assume meant that they were looking at making this a landscape that changed over time. People assume that NPCs were added due to backlash about it early on.... I fully assume they planned to introduce NPCs as Appalachia grew and became established.
---
We're in the scrounging to get by, trying to just survive , getting a foothold stage. People just trying to salvage a survivable day to day life, with trying to maybe regain some normalcy along the way....
---
I assume what you're looking for will be in wastelanders and will make far more sense. We've established ourselves, now we can begin banding together and rebuild.
---
Hate it when that happens. 
---
It removeds a random.
---
For that reason, I try to keep an extra serum for each of my mutations for those Doh! moments when I forget to re-equip starched genes.  (has happened more than I want to admit)
---
I see discounts that exist on both my accts with FO1st and without it. No exclusive ones though.
---
Oh god! Roleplay! 
---
God forbid!
---
No, the way they worded it was literally "you’ll have access to exclusive discounts in the Atomic Shop...you’ll get discounts on some sweet items to spend those Atoms on."
---
The only promises here are the fact that the offers will be exclusive and at a discounted price.  You assumed that meant that they would be applying exclusive discounts on already released items, their intention was to release items exclusively to 1st members at prices lower than you would pay if the items just appeared normally in the shop.
---
Nice. Thanks, I'll give that a try.
---
Need to level up my explosives character.
---
You've convinced me.
---
I'm actually fully expecting that to be rolled out with wastelanders. Maybe not day 1, but with other content events where stuff rolls out over a bit of time.
---
Joinable factions. Horde/Raid vs NPCs etc
---
Reading below, it looks like you might have found one for yourself. Just wanted add info about the reward drop as I experienced it. After completing the event, "one violent night" I got not only both the Urban &amp; Forrest Scout masks, I also got the White Springs, BOS and White Powder jumpsuits.
---
Thanks for this, I've been wondering how people feel about it.
---
Say what?! You can't make wild, amazing claims like that without *picture* proof
---
Variations of the Gatling gun have earned a huge following, especially the bloodied.  As have the LMG and .50 Cal.  
---
My two shot minigun and LMG were never all-that against the queen.  So, I would think it has more to do with the modifier than the specific weapon.
---
Clearing the local Cache can work on this on Xbox. You might lose your photos, so save them elsewhere, but it fixed the problem for my husband's character a couple months ago. Actually, have you tried different characters? If it's just one this really should fix, but if multiple it may be something else.
---
I generally don’t use foods/chems either.
---
RNG hasn’t been that nice, so no god tier weapons...  For the SBQs I‘ve fought,  AA LMG and a Gatling (resolute veteran) have done the most damage.
---
Or if I accidentally hit craft all on throwing knives, and it goes through 10k steel, super duper calculating each one, starts to lag, Xbox begins smoking, server farms begin to explode, and the internet is destroyed. I don't think the game could handle that volume of information
---
I agree
---
When I see 2 weapon rolls with the same first attribute, I switch to armor. I usually get something pretty good.
---
It really depends on how badly I need it. under 30 and i'll usually buy. If I'm desperate for some I have paid as much as 75 caps a piece. At 40 it will eventually sell. Most players I see at vending machines are running in power armor, so they probably aren't using radshield.
---
Roughly. If it’s 3 star and two of the stars are junk but could be something someone MIGHT like, I will do around 1000 caps
---
somebody get this guy some skill...
---
Well he hasn't responded yet but we will see. One violent night is one I haven't tried
---
The reskin was initially priced at 500 atoms, compared to other atom shop apparel considering it's an outfit and helmet they otherwise could have put it in the shop for probably 800 to 900 atoms otherwise.
---
Ok keep killing sbq i will be at westtek getting 10x more legendaries then you.
---
What's with this sub being extra stupid today.
---
I sell plenty of my usual useful junk since 1st. Maybe a little bit more than usual, but definitely not less.
---
My rifle character used to carry melee weapon to deal with small enemies and save ammo.  But the damn mole rats kept biting me and giving me a disease.  I quit with the melee weapons and carried a small side arm instead.  By keeping a gap between them and me I've significantly reduced my rate of aquiring disease.  Can't stop it entirely, but I find I can live with half the diseases no problem.
---
Would you not kill it if it was only a two Star legendary? I am guessing you would still kill it, so who cares?
---
We had problems getting more than 3 to even be able to go into the vault. With a 4 man team, only 2 or 3 of us would see the vault door open. We tried a bunch of times and it randomized who could and could not get through the door.
---
I honestly love that. My camp needs some help 😂
---
Sure, Jan.
---
Just because your interpretation fits your narrative doesn't make it right.  The fact of the matter is that my interpretation is what they actually ended up going with and that's all that matters.  An item was offered.  it was exclusive and it was discounted.  End of story.
---
This is a super, common thing most people over look. Happened to me last summer. I swore it was the game, then it was the modem, went through replacing all sorts of stuff around the house. Come to find out, it was summer, wires were hot on a powerline near me, and it was just giving me bad connection. Had to get my ISP to send techs out after a whole lot of struggle and they showed it was a bad connection.
---
Elevators already exist, just requires unlocking in Fallout 76. Only thing though is how will it effect servers.
---
I like what you've done with the place.
---
After reading your defence of Bethesda, it's clear you are the last person in the world that can call me a dumbass 🤣
---
Someone signing up to the service for the first time could be forgiving for understanding that as a member he or she will get discounts on the atom store only available to 1st members could they not? 
---
And why do you think that is? 
---
A customer not on Reddit or any forums shouldn't have to learn there is literally nothing there in terms of discounts AFTER spending their money. That's just being dodgy.
---
If Bethesda added one stupid hat a month, make it available only to 1st members, put the initial price as 10,000 atoms, marked a discount and said as a 1st member you get it for 500 you would still be here defending that, and that speaks volumes to you as a person.
---
The point of the discounts is to have a discount on something that is otherwise available to non 1st members at a higher price. That's what makes a person think there is some additional value for money here.
---
People are clearly not happy about the fact that Bethesda has been radio silent on this and 2 months on (or is it 3?) This benefit has yet to materialise. In some countries that is considered false advertisement which is illegal. 
---
You seem to take it very personally that people are unhappy about it and voicing their displeasure with it. It's important players do this as it feeds back to the company and this is how changes are eventually made to benefit the community as a whole.
---
If the entire community was like you, nothing would ever be improved as we would spend our time simply congratulating Bethesda on a mediocre job at best.
---
And so we are clear, I'm a big fan of the game and play daily. I am however not a fan of how Bethesdas practices which again is a valid position for a player of any game to take.
---
Server lag/desync can cause hits to register on your system and not the server. This might be something different, though.
---
Nah, I don't mean NPC factions that we join (farm reputation for) which is already pretty much confirmed with settlers and raiders, I mean player created clans/guilds/factions like all real MMOs have as a mandatory launch feature.
---
*We wish you a boosted Christmas, we wish you a boosted Christmas, we wish you a boosted Christmas, and a sale this New Year*
---
Pretty sure it’s just a private world, not a server. But still I get your point.
---
I want to know if the hellfire armour in 76 is actually cannon. I thought it was developed way later and if they have x-01 that’s a prototype what’s with the hellfire being created then as well. And coz of this will this new commie power armour skin be cannon then as well, coz if it is then WTF???
---
It's just annoying... you get your hopes up for something more than scrip and and up with nothing worth mentioning. Plus the drops they give defeat the purpose of a star system
---
It seems that if you stay on the same (private) server a long time it stops spawning legendaries.   Even the SBQ May become a non-legendary.
---
Leveling up is just a rinse and repeat method and server hopping. At lower levels I like to run Powering up Poseidon while well rested and repeated Feed The People event at Mama Dolces for the canned meat stew with 3 pts in Inspirational. Usually nets me anywhere between 700-1000xp per run. Intelligence also plays a big factor in leveling up. Scorchbeast brain (cooked) and Int chems help with that. Unyielding gear is all +3 stats, big help in leveling fast. Also toss in some questing and claiming workshops along the way. Then about 20ish, I'll add the Chalreston DMV, WS golf club, Fort Defiance and Uranium Fever. Some times West Tek gets added but that usually is at 30+. Then it's just grind grind grind...
---
PvP isn't that big of a factor and I only participate when I'm bored and want a challenge lol. My bloodied commando has a limb dmg bloodied handmade and a bloodied railway. So gear isn't all that heavily important. With a full Unyielding wood set I hold my own in PvE.
---
I'll send you my PSN via dm. I have 2 PSN accounts, one main and one streaming account. I'll send you them both because I really never know which one I'll be on at times lol.
---
You don't think people banding togheder in face of danger and in the event of almost total atomic annihilation makes sense? I get that you're thinking in stages, but small bands of people would be the best chance of survival anyone could have and the acutal lone wolves would be screwed.
---
Not to mention, it's a game. A multiplayer game with no player to player systems outside of trading and emotes, one that has no HUBs and in which PVP is a non factor. Now THIS is something that makes no sense.
---
If you use PA Stabilized gives you a 45% armor penetration bonus
---
The dead things have been an issue since day one. You have to walk your killing path with them all dead, when you reach the end fast travel to a near location thats outside the blast zone. Then exit the server, and join back into the private server. When you get back in all the enemies should be alive.
---
Depends on your target market.  As a higher level player, usually in excavator, I collect loads of junk during normal adventuring, so its rare that I buy it. 
---
THe things I look for/buy the most are plans I don’t have and relatively inexpensive serums as backup for when I lose hem because I forgot to Reequip starched genes.
---
Occasionally, I’ll buy 308 if I’m running low.
---
My camp is on the divide/forest border - So far, Bobbleheads, stable flux, and magazines sell the best.
---
lol, your skills consist of scripts you copy and paste from unknownhacks
---
One of the things crystal is used for is  making film for the camera - which you need lots of for the possum and tadpole challenges, as well as Ansel mission.
---
Nope, been happening to me since level 20 with a plain Mole Miner gauntlet.
---
Tenderizer, Stabilized, Bloody Mess, Nerd Rage if you're gonna run Bloodied, One Gun Army, maybe Quick Hands since heavy guns' reloads tend to be pretty long and easily interrupted.
---
I uninstalled when the whole private server debacle happened. Came back to see if they've improved greatly or fixed major performance problems and can see I made the correct decision to uninstall
---
Tech noob here...
---
- how do you check the frame rate ?
---
(Thanks in advance)
---
Not bad
---
Brighter?  at close range, it already washes out most things....
---
dont remember if theres on for excavator, but it stands to reason, since there’s a ”bright” mod for the other PA suits
---
Well, shielded was always rare. It was rare long before any underarmor was ever in the shop. 
---
Its only rare because of a bug. Without it, it qould be comparably rare to marine or raider.
---
I disagree
---
BOO
---
I'm missing the vocabulary to get to the point, thanks for helping out :)
---
You're not the only one. The discount was a big selling point for me. I buy some atoms each month, so this is just buying atoms for me. I thought we'd get stuff like the weekly/daily sales but all over, aka its listed for 800 atoms but if you are a 1st member its only 500 atoms. Plus the store selection has been stinking. Why would I buy more atoms if there is nothing good to buy?
---
The vendor at Camden park has excavator plans
---
I like  that the game forces me to think/calculate on my own. 
---
And if you fill a box with something irl, theres also nothing that tells you how many units still fit in there.
---
I pair it with Carnivore, you can eat raw meat with zero disease chance for twice the hunger relief and it's easy to kill a random creature for the meat.
---
If they do I might start playing again
---
Good first choice is Calibrated shocks (for carry weight.)
---
 followed by motion assist servos (+2 str)
---
and if you are melee, optimized bracers for faster AP regen (great for power attacks)
---
It’s included with fallout 1st+
---
Elevators could be worse than stairs, in that they would also require power lines, which would consume additional budget.
---
What's up with y'all thinking I fucking hack? I record every single fight if you want to see. But whatever, keep being bad :(
---
I’m not in game to confirm at the moment but I believe the Excavator has a bright light mod available like the other PA types. 
---
AFAIK it’s a mod only, not a plan. The Grafton Responder vendor (not the train station, but in town) and the Camden Park vendor have them fairly often.
---
Sadly, there's a ton of cut content in the files that will never be added, including the "Freezing" effect and other stuff from Fallout 4. 
---
"Freezing" would be insanely OP because it's an instant freeze that lasts several seconds on every critical hit. It would have to be rebalanced with a small chance to freeze for 1-2 seconds or something. I suppose it's possible that they might do that one day, but I really wouldn't get my hopes up.
---
I tried an all perks and armor benefits disease resistant build. I wanted to be immune. 15 levels looking for those perks and points in endurance. I did it . Ten minutes later a level 9 ghoul attacked me in Charleston and I was sick. 
---
Disease resistance is bugged or something.
---
Thats because of damage value caps for PvP right?
---
Indeed
---
[citation needed]
---
Hmm ok then
---
I literally bought a new PS4 pro on Friday, installed the game until yesterday, restarted the console moving it between rooms, and still bluescreened loading into a world the first two times I attempted to load in.
---
Bingo.
---
What do you mean? I got junkies explosive combat rifle off a 3* you would rather basically never see a 3* enemy?
---
That could be one draw back, or could be really really good.
---
mmmkay.
---
You don't talk to the Mothman, you *commune* with his wiseness.
---
Which fight you wanna see? The one where you got damage bugged at munitions and you said I was doing "9 million damage"
---
Wish I had that much spare CAMP budget to use those letters :-(
---
It's kind of the point of Fallout though. Improvised weapons. It's the post apocalypse, not like a bunch of blacksmiths running around. You got to make do with what you got. 
---
Your examples don't sound like real weapons either. Granted I don't know exactly what you're talking about but thermic lance sounds like a welding rod and I've never heard of any conventional weaponry called fists or gloves, maybe sports equipment. 
---
We got multiple swords, shishkebab, assaultron blade, revolutionary sword and Chinese officer's sword, combat knives, a spear and an axe, I assume you'll say fire axe, harchet and multi-purpose are tools. What would you want? Maces? Morning stars? We got clubs (and hammers) made from bones, can't really get more real than that.
---
So two quest lines, a small additional area, and raids that don't work.  You consider these to be substantial additions to a game that has been out for over a year?
---
The Monk class is set to be added in late 2020.  Incense will be crafted with Ash Rose and Chally's milk and give you a 20% crit AOE damage bonus when using a Bō Staff.

I got a zealots single action 1*, a exterminators sickle 1*, a junkies db 1* and a couple of 2*s out of 3 star enemies today so... you got Lucky i think😂
---
Sheepsquatch! BAAAAAA
---
Okay I’ll try that loop out. 
---
I’m gonna try and find a solo build build that I can mainly run and flex in some team cards
---
Cool I’ll add you, would you be available today to help me transfer items to my new character?
---
Or it eats up over 50% of your budget.
---
"Sure, you can have an elevator." 
---
"But, that's all I can build now"
---
"But you *did* get your elevator..."
---
We don’t have time to fix bugs, but we have time to add new mtx and subscriptions, lol
---
It’s RNG. You can’t expect a god roll every time.
---
Really? I picked up the leather Nuka-Cola paint job. I haven't seen this paint job until I got FO1st. Then it appeared in the Atom Shop. This was about two weeks ago.
---
I never have more than 150 or so. Always tinkering with guns...
---
Make sure the games up today with the recent patch. Also try uninstalling the game.
---
The problem is your inventory has perks applied to weight values and stash doesn’t but you you can’t see that. It’s not as simple as doing some math since not all info needed is in front of you.
---
Thanks! I finally found the perp. It was delbert's company tea. A recipe that doesn't show on Delbert's terminal but exists in the world. Found it thanks to a list of all plans and recipes that I found on this subreddit.
---
So, that sounds more to me like an exclusive offer rather than a discount. It’s not like it was offered to non-subscribers for 800 atoms.
---
Looks awesome dude. I had no idea you could build on existing buildings. This has given me some new inspiration!
---
This is my build currently. I'm pretty hard to kill and can swap out some of the perks for more carry weight when I need it.

---
No i understand that, but what is the point in having 1/2/3* enemies when the 3* drops a lot of 1 or 2*'s
---
Program called "fraps" can display that info in game for ya.
---
Nvidia and AMD might have some tools as well within their software suites, but I'm not familiar with those.
---
Have you tried JG Wentworth?
---
No. The Halloween stuff was more up my alley.
---
And my poor A button
---
Must be Buffalo Bills butterflies
---
I use a bloody pipe revolver, but it's hard to go bloody at a low level. 
---
Maybe make a bunch of grenades?
---
This is amazing. Looks lived in, totally fits the aesthetic of 76. Thank you for sharing this!
---
Wow you can build on that?
---
Got a fulltime job, still prefer to choose how to spend it wisely instead of getting scammed by a company that doesnt give a shit about the community and keeps lying constantly. Enjoy your fallout 1st, people like you is why the company will stay garbage.
---
Ticks resemble spiders to much for my comfort. As such I kill them long before they get close to me and don't look to closely at them as I"m quickly looting them.
---
Didn't notice the skull, nice find.
---
Because they are the only enemies with a chance of dropping 3 star gear. Before purveyor and vending my main character has a full set of 3* armor and all weapons were 3*, so drops do happen. You just need to kill a lot of enemies to get gear you want. A guaranteed 3* weapon/armor to me isn’t as exciting. Personal preference.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Just buy the serum from players.
---
DID YOU BREAK THE CAMP BUDGET?!
---
99%，the bar’s almost full😂
---
Also what console?
---
Thats what it is, preference. I would like the 3* enemies to be rare to what they are not but make them drop 3* weapons / armor. It just bugs me that like today i kill around 8-10 of them and not a single 3* drop
---
PC
---
If I'm not mistaken the 500 atom price was a mistake and it was reduced to being free the next day

---
Though Bethesda Austin may of course change their minds and say fuck it and not release them at all or redo them completely, we'll see.
---
I have seen it priced from thousands to ten thousands, and players rarely sell it, so just grab it as you see fit.
---
I think there are a Lotta camps who don't follow this route where you can fit a lot of items in one piece of foundation and still make it functional with lots of eye candy
---
Fallout Christmas, shabby wreaths, trees, lights
---
Yep. Just happened to us on our first time raiding it. This game is pathetic.
---
He likes LSD maybe?
---
Who are you to judge?
---
Humm I really didn't think of that or the ammo perk or chemist 
---
I'm sure they could work around that though if they think of it that is lol
---
Yeah you burn through fairly fast imo
---
That would be bad.....
---
That would be good lol really really good
---
If im playing by myself, how do i know ill be put back into the same server
---
Save the A button please Bethesda and the spacebar (xbox and ps4 buttons also)
---
There is a window that it will keep that server open. I think its like 5 or so minutes. As long as you rejoin within that window and it didnt crash for some reason(something I havnt had happen yet). It should put you back in the same server.
---
Ugh fuck...
---
Grahm I assume is under 1000?
---
I dont understand. Tesla coils arent generating electricity they just (very inefficiently) can transfer the electricity without wire. We already have power conduits which do just that. We also already have the arc trap which is essentially a tesla coil
---
Except that there are laws on advertising and my "interpretation" has precedence behind it. Language in advertising is extremely important. Bethesda knows this well with the numerous class action lawsuits they have already lossed due to their advertising practices for FO76 specifically. I think it is up to 3 now. They are asking for 4+ apparently.
---
Updoot.  We can do this all day.
---
Probably in wastelanders
---
Someone modded it into the game. It's just bad devs.
---
No you didn't. Even if your fictional narrative was true, having an item only appear as FO1st member is not a discount. That would be an exclusive item. We are all aware of exclusive items and those are covered in another part of their advertisement. I am specifically speaking of the "exclusive discount" claim, which has yet to be fulfilled.
---
I keep coming back to find Grahm going apeshit on my camp because of this bug. Is Bethesda going to give us a scrap gift box like they did with the 1st players that lost scrap as an apology for all the scrap we've wasted repairing our camps?
---
If you say so, whatever make you happy I guess. Go play your 5 hour quota
---
Carnivore is awesome though imo. You're lucky you didnt get empath or something awful lol. Carnivores only downside is that plant food doesnt give you food, but you can still get the other boosts from it
---
You make it sound like it a bad thing I get 5 hours of enjoyment out of the game sounds like you need some friends I play on xbox would you like to join me and my crew for a fomp thru the wastland
---
I was worried about not getting the XP bonus from my Cranberry dishes but I saw I got the bonus. Might leave it for awhile. Just got a ton of wolf meat from leader of the pack
---
Pretty sure you have a food/explorer build. In other words mostly QoL perks...
---
Yeah theres basically no downside. You can eat raw meat now so you wont even have to cook anything for food itself. Only need to cook for other boosts
---
And maybe dismantle my 50+ crops at my base
---
Try moving dome perks to sneak it really saves you're ass in tough situations
---
The Scrapbox is unbelievable....but everyone should have it. Private server ok if u wanna hog all the workshops for a night...I could do without the tactical tent or whatever the F it’s called
---
Yeah those take a ton of space and now you only need it situationally instead of for all your food!
---
You can tell yourself something enough times to the point you'll believe it, but that's on you
---
Ok
---
Thank you
---
1500h in , back after a 8 month break...not a single usable drop. I dont get really exited to see a legendary enemy anymore so to speak
---
i got 1 really good melee weapon and kept it for a while when my ammo was getting low.   
---
What i ended up doing was swing abit early, and keep the enemy at my crosshair as much as i can.  
---
Also, i got Kinetic dynamo thing in my PA, which charges my AP when i get hit, so, if it got really bad, Id just stand still and use power attack. Unless 3-4 mad enemies gang up on me, i can tank many hits from many enemies.
---
Ask a high level to build one for you.
---
I regret that I have but one upvote to give for this post.
---
I found a dragon in the safe at Sunday brothers cabin
---
Get Lomé wonderer
---
If youre ps4 ill.make you one ajd mod it for you, itll he free but a donation would be greatly appreciated
---
we wont see the bug fixes we want anytime soon when more and more people keep asking for content that they can make us pay for.
---
No what he is asking is for 3 star enemy’s to drop 3 star loot
---
They are rare spawns in game. At 15 you can start making them yourself with the plans (buy from the Free States Vendor in Whitesprings) and three levels of gunsmith. You’ll be making and breaking a lot to get all the mods, so start early!
---
This is amazing! I need to be more creative like this.
---
Yeah could you imagine accidentally hitting craft all on a radium rifle. Those use a lot of everything.
---
I just want a silent generator honestly, hate how noisy this crap is. I know it’s the wasteland and you wouldn’t be able to make sure everything is running smoothly and quietly, but I just hate how loud the generators are. I mean think about it, you would want as quiet a camp as possible to not draw any attention to yourself or the surrounding area so you don’t draw creatures in.
---
for real.
---
Maybe something cool to have on the camp.
---
Oh right I thought it was an official thing not just a poll on Twitter
---
Well that does appear to be what the post is about.
---
Give us true Enclave power armor with the built in nuclear reactor to power it. Either that or make it an upgrade to the existing armor.
---
Weird they didn't respawn. I usually get 4 or 5 respawns before the nuke goes away.
---
Take Blocker and use a melee weapon. All ranged enemies switch to melee when you get close enough
---
Straight up, message any high level on the server and ask to buy a modded vanilla for like 500 caps. I bet most wont even charge you
---
Most viable option is to find it at a player vendor. Otherwise, ask as others have suggested.
---
It's a rare bug, and happens a lot more often on public servers that have been up for a long time. Go to point pleasant and look across the bridge for the flock of cargobots. The more bots there are the longer the server has been up, the more likely it is for it to be bugging out. Also, sometimes it will appear to be a frag mine but it's not. It's weird because if you accidentally set it off before disarming it it will make the sound for whatever thing it was bugged to. I've seen frag mines that made bottlecap mine sounds there and tossed caps around. When you pick it up though it's a bottle cap mine.
---
Is there any reason you aren't using Starched Genes Rank 2?  That will prevent you from contracting random mutations, and from losing your existing ones, as long as it is equipped.
---
It is such a basic thing to code in something that allows you to put in as many as you can for your own stash (less so for shared containers like suitcases) and yet the game doesn't have it.
---
What? Bethesda promised something and then didn't deliver? What a shocking, unexpected turn of events! /s
---
Oh! While we're at it can we please have a Pink Barnie plushie too? This can lack the real post-apocalyptic feeling
---
Well it already exists under traps
---
Probably inspired by this: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death's-head_hawkmoth

This is how Skynet starts

That’s a cool idea. I think a intelligent robo brain town would be cool. Like the ones that haven’t been dumbed down by Robco before the Great War.

To be fair, and it HAS been a few years, but I think I took Caesar out with a grenade.
---
Thanks for the list, but I've gone through those before; I knew the effect was already in the files.  I use xEdit for datamining every day, and there's a ton of leftover data from Fallout 4 and even Skyrim.  I can say with 100% certainty that almost none of it will ever be enabled in 76.
---
Here's the funniest thing I've found leftover from Skyrim: https://i.imgur.com/37x4VdR.png
---
Totally different teams but sure, place the same expectations on them.
---
I don't think you'd need to respec or make a nrw character.
---
One of the advantage for Bloodied build is that the large damage boost allows you to use different weapons without the respective damage perk. I'd say just put a lvl 3 Concentrated Fire on and you are good to go.
---
Riflemen builds requires stealth because single shot only weapons like hunting rifle are pretty weak outside of stealth. So you might also want to put on some related perks as well.
---
If you want a full VATS stealth build tho do make a new character.
---
Yeah, it works with any item that actually requires a set amount of electricity. It doesnt work with lightbulbs, which apparentely work on konetic energy haha
---
I chuckled at this.
---
Fair enough
---
What kind of armor are you using? Get a couple of pieces of ghoul slayer, mutant slayer and troubleshooters each. I have a full set of each and can walk through west tek and whitespring without using a stimpak.
---
No way, it's actually nice figuring it out using math. Plus if you have like rank 2 of thru hiker on and don't know how much it weighs, you figure that out first and then math how much goes into the stash! This game is relaxing after a long day of accounting and payroll, I tell you what
---
Precisely. From generator to the through the wall conduit to the switch which is then in proximity of a lightbulb. Thanks for the tips, will try them out
---
Fixes for game-breaking bugs are exclusive to Fallout 1st.
---

---
Yes... by reducing their appearance to match drop rates.

im searching for the plan of those letters... none of the vendors have it
---

---
I got lucky today,a 3 star actually dropped a 3 star..vampires fire axe though lol
---
Yeah, we really fucked West Virginia irl it honestly is a natural spot to have a post apocalyptic story
---
They didn't offer an explicit service and then renege on that offer, they advertised something exclusive and discounted and that's what they delivered.
---
This isn't a fucking nylon bag where you can definitively point out the difference between what you was advertised and what was delivered.
---
Anything specific in those records that makes you think these legendary perks won't be added? From what I remember the Melee_BlockBurns and the similar 4 and 5 star ones weren't in 4 so they are a new addition.
---
I've always wanted to build in this area! Definitely a solid build and love it!
---
It would be nice if the 3* at least couldn't drop 1* items. It's asinine doing something like uranium fever or AWOL armaments, getting excited to see a three star legendary every single wave and you get a 1* piece of shit. Not to mention sbq and encryptid that generally take several peoples help
---
I don't know how other people feel about it, but I kinda like my private world, well, private. I go back to adventure to sell some wares everynow and then but I really like my F076 single player experience.
---
yes.
---
And blocked, I'm done trying to explain this shit in simple terms to someone with the comprehension of a brick wall just looking for shit to whine about.
---
Do u have any quick leveling strats?
---
It's happening to me with my ranged weapons as well. For the past few days. On occasion, encountering a random enemy, VATS will show 95% but I'll "miss" 3 or 4 times before it finally registers a hit. This occurs several times in a session but not in every encounter. It even happens when I am solo in a private server.
---
Ive been waiting for Enclave gear for so long
---
I'd rather have more grown-up events, this is Fallout ffs
---
Holy damage
---
Yeah I really think they need to up the player limit in private worlds. I was gonna set up a flea market on mine, but had way too many people sign up and I realized it would be rude af to kick people to rotate more in. I didn't tell anyone it was cancelled though :(
---
I have been waiting so long for enclave stuff !!!!!
---
Every time i kill a tic unless it's the white one it explodes and just disappears
---
im low in stimpaks and i think i can make like 4-5 then dilute them...
---
*ends up with 60 diluted stimpaks 
---
me: praise the todd
---
Because it was literally something they couldn't offer any other way.  
---
It's a skin that has to be applied to the original.  If they put it in the atom shop at a higher price for everyone and someone without 1st buys it then they're left asking for a refund, if they put a brand new version available to everyone that doesn't need the original then they piss off every single 1st member that bought in for the original and if they put an undiscounted version in the shop available only to 1st members then someone will eventually end up buying it instead of the discounted version.
---
The only non-convoluted way of selling this thing was to put it up visible only to 1st members at a lower price than they otherwise would have sold it and up until everyone freaked the fuck out that Bethesda had the gall to offer them an exclusive discount on something they wanted for free that's what they did.
---
I run the OG Xbox and had these issues early on in the games life but after having an external storage it has been non existent. I don’t know if this helps but it worked for me.
---
Exactly, where does one find the plans?!
---
Did you make sure to sit on his throne though?
---
Thanks FF make sense, will give it a try, F76 is pretty cheap atm, lost another handmade last night try to swop between charactors 🥜
---
I agree thee are way too many useless affixes and mediocre weapons.  On 2 rolls today I pulled a F3315 Fixer and a Furious Bash +1 agility.  1 pretty damn good weapon to trade sell and one that is probably scrip value.  This purveyor sale I have rolled a QLimb 90rw Tesla, a weapon I have wanted for a while and a TSE25 Gatling.
---
Wow you're a comedic genius.
---
I think it’s called Signs and Letters and if I remember it’s quite rare but sold by the station/robot vendors. Very expensive too, at least when I got them about 200 levels and 2 characters ago.
---
That's the story you'd hear from PR.  The reskin was never advertised as being included with a 1st subscription, anywhere.  There was no reason to ever expect it or any other free goodies to come with the subscription.  But when they released it and everyone freaked the fuck out Bethesda already had enough of a headache over people bitching about 1st and quickly gave it away for free to shut everyone up.
---
Crafting Power armor and making handmade and scrapping them for mods
---
Same, usually if I try melee attack. Been happening for weeks. Freeze, 10 seconds buzzing sound then back to Xbox home screen.
---
Long Live The Enclave!
---
I definitely want to do something Christmas themed! I’ve only been playing for a few months so i dont have previous Christmas decorations but im just waiting on a new update or atomic shop items. Also i love how creative your builds are.
---
Scraping them for mods.... ah.
---
Yeah, that's expensive.
---
Apparently, this is still bugged.
---
I’ve been there multiple times.
---
today, I took the workshop - adn still didnt get credit for discovering Bogtown.
---
(PS4)
---
I have a better idea.  Drop boards, rolling pins, Lead Pipes, and Wood Armour from the Legendary tables, and Remove:  Troubleshooter, Mutant Slayer, and Ghoul Slayer as Primary effects
---
That way you might actually get something with value.
---
This is my third play through, and I'm at level 65 again, and I have still yet to get a decent weapon/armour drop in the first 100 levels of any game.
---
How about an actually useful event with new content?
---
Double XP is worthless to those of use with multiple level 100+ characters.
---
Or better yet, an event with new content and double XP.
---
Awesome. Idea.
---
Like this is the story I'd hear from someone who dislikes Bethesda.
---
You can vats on enemies (ghouls, bloatflies,etc). First i'm hearing about it on players though.
---
I mighta stayed put just to get the trophy for being at ground zero....
---
I was averaging 4-6 hours per day for a while. I stopped playing before the first vault opened so maybe it wasn’t as long ago as I thought
---
They're so expensive tho...
---
They nerfed the shit out of them.  You expected ...
---
AA is only 30% buff, if you have BE or TSE or JE, use those instead . All shotguns suck atm but some suck less 🤮
---
Blinders on then and away you go
---
Sure. Pay ten dollars.
---
I miss them.
---
You were robbed bro, but you had to know a shitfest like Bethesda was going to do it to you. 
---
Nobody to blame but yourself.
---
My point was that their presence in the files doesn't necessarily mean they will be enabled. But, to answer your question, there's nothing indicating that they won't be added, either.  It does look like Melee_BlockBurns "Blazing Block" is new to 76, but there's also a lot of other new items and features that were cut. Some of it is marked "CUT" and some isn't, but just because it isn't marked doesn't mean it'll be enabled, either.  There's no way to tell whether any of the 4th or 5th star effects will ever be enabled, but it's possible.  
---
List of just the 4th and 5th star effects: 
---
[Part 1](https://i.imgur.com/2hMjvNm.png)
---
[Part 2](https://i.imgur.com/69BzYIe.png)
---
I mentioned this in another comment, but "Freezing" would be insanely OP because it's an instant freeze that lasts several seconds on every critical hit. It would have to be rebalanced with a small chance to freeze for 1-2 seconds or something.
---
This is the type of mentality we have at Bethesda - this is their version of how to keep you playing, which is shit btw, but exactly what we can expect from them.
---
Got me thinking though does tank killer work 4 shotguns? No perk I remember seeing specific for ap on shotguns and I know it works on any rifle semi or full auto AND smgs cause I tried almost all...
---
Are shotguns any good?
---
Yes.  That’s ho w it should’ve been done, but not to ultra rare spawn levels, more like 1 an hour type of thing or 1 an event
---
Pay to lose baby
---
Vampire weapons help.
---
Lone wanderer. 
---
If you have the points in luck, bloodymess3.
---
Glowsight3 for the glowing ones (obviously)
---
Tenderizer, if it is not bugged (heard a rumor it might be)
---
Use power attacks. faster swing speed (martial artist3), gladiator.  
---
For most bots, Troubleshooters or AA weapons.
---
protectrons, eyebots, and liberators can be melee’d with almost anything.
---
Three star creatures have a *chance* to drop three star items, one star creatures don’t have such chance. So I don’t think it’s necessary to make a starred creature drop matching star item, it would be convenient but unnecessary. They actually jacked up the chance, so a three star is more likely to drop three star item than a few months ago.
---
I think an anti armour shot gun is better.
---
I had a an explosive pump action that does more damage than my anti armour combat shotgun. I tested both on some radscorpions and I noticed that AA combat shot gun was way more effective than the E pump action.
---
Todd: The best I can do is roll out some Enclave power armor skins in the atomic shop
---
I don’t think tank killer works on shotguns, but yes it applies to all rifles, auto and semi. For ap you need a combat shotty (Pump won’t have such option) and modify it to have piercing ammo. But even with that it’s less powerful than a bloodied pump.
---
I'll link you my Bloodied commando. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

---
Mmogfails says Wastelanders will have an Enclave presence. My guess is around that time or slightly before.
---
I would actually pay for this.
---
The whole system is shit.  You need to be able to loot if your in the vicinity of the kill, despite how some would abuse it. 
---
The entirety of this games mechanics - all obviously hacked in to make a single player game multiplayer- suck ass.  
---
Fo76 was, is, and continues to be, an example of how not to make a game.
---
They're selling a gravestone right now.  Love it.

I use a vampires super sledge and never use a stimpak. Martial artist and Incisor and rest to slugger. No need for blocker. Take a psycho and eat and drink beforehand.
---
Agreed. But the stop n go needs to be fixed asap.
---
Oh, is that what the guts are for?  Neat/gross.
---
So do indicate the files. I think Mmogfails also said that the BOS will have a small presence?
---
How much in Atoms? Am I going to have to grind my fingers to the bone again?
---
Same here.

I still have dual smoke machines and refuse to move my camp because it's so cool looking.

Mods and plans are two different things. Plans=whitesprings.  Mods= randomly on vendors, esp Camden

---
Like most. Big iron. That song actually introduced me to marty robbins and i found out hes one of my favorite artists
---
I remember I found them with my very first character months and months ago in one of the treasures you can dig up. Not sure if you can still find it that way since they're so much harder to find at vendors nowadays as well. Been looking myself with no luck yet.
---
No.  No they aren’t.
---
But in the lore the Pulowski Preservation Shelters didn’t save the people from the heat of the blast so they still died when the bombs fell
---
Check you internet connection. Is there noise on your phoneline does it crackle? Try an Ookla speed check on a PC or laptop  a ping of 20ms or less is needed for online gaming. Reboot the router, it may look like its okay but after you have rebooted it may not indicating a fault somewhere. Good luck!
---
The big iron on his hip , I hear you my brother.

You don’t.   Cats get you.   That’s how it works.

Personally, I am always looking for 3-star gear. I don't buy ammo or scrap, except on very rare occasions when I find I'm out of something uncommon and I'm feeling extremely rushed or lazy.
---
Hmm far enough thanks for the info. I'll keep trying to play with it to get it to work
---
They were most likely cooked
---
yeah it's charisma, take daytripper. thank me later
---
Seems solid, I assume any auto rifle works?
---
Just wanna share my favorite song, please give the key to somebody else. Lol my favorite was happy times from New Vegas soundtrack
---
They got you to pay more money for a broken game...and your surprised about it still being broken?
---
I’ve got some great real estate in south central Florida I’d love to sell you.
---
 No shit.
---
All gear is cool
---
They have your money. That’s where all interest dies.  
---
Have you seen the game?   They don’t give two shits about the players.
---
+45%
---
Caps at a 9 stack with 5% per hit.
---
I loved my bloody gun slinger build BUT he was almost useless in big fights and died fast because he could t stay hidden (non silenced weapons) and there is only so much dodgy and serendipity can do.
---
I bought a bloody, FFR vats hunting rifle and threw a silencer on it and he is unstoppable.
---
So compared to stealth sniper or commando a non-stealth gunslinger isn’t viable as he can’t survive the big fights long enough to hold his own damage wise.
---
I could one shot most things in the game and that was fine for most situations where it’s rare to have more than 12 enemies at a time (two western revolvers)...but in the hard events like SBQ, encyptid and project paradise it’s not enough.
---
Melee and stealth are over powered and have been for ages.  Nothing else compares except heavy weapons in a SBQ fight and they have their drawbacks too.
---
Handguns need more armour piercing and a higher damage output.  If the revolvers don’t have silencers then their base damage needs to be significantly higher than rifles that can have silencers.
---
Just get the Plague Walker serum and be one with The Blight.
---
God sometimes works miracles in small ways. 
---
You should both buy outer worlds and see how easily she gets setup there. 
---
Truth
---
That's correct. Generally, you'll be looking for Anti-armor, Junkie's, or niche options like Quad and Vampire's.
---
That said, Bloodied Explosive lasers will still cut opponents to pieces, so Bloodied is definitely still viable.
---
now i feel nostalgic for FNV, good choice!
---
Only crops you should have are Tato, nut fruit and corn to make vegetable starch for adhesive.
---
&gt; will never be added
---
I take it you weren't around during the first couple of months when cryolaters would full on freeze players and slow them to a crawl for like 5 minutes after a 3 second blast
---
Hmm not sure about why there's such a discrepancy. Some people have flawless private servers while it seems like others have terrible ones. I don't doubt that it happens, just in my personal experience it doesn't happen.
---
And yeah, the nuke thing might be irritating to some. Once a week I do a solo nuke on private, it's not much of a hassle to me. It makes sense with the way respawns work in this game. The relog takes an extra 30 seconds, but the bonus of being able to farm a nuke zone over and over at my own leisure is very worthwhile, in my opinion.
---
I haven't noticed a change in that. I understand the chance, but why not make finding a 3 star the chance? Instead of maybe there's a 3 star, then maybe it'll be a 3 star weapon and armor, and maybe it'll be the weapon it armor you want. There's too many maybes.
---
Ok, I’d like to exchange my 20k of 5.56 for caps plz
---
I use a Prime Zealots Ultracite Gat whenever I go to the SBQ now.  The weapon is also 10% Aiming Damage. 
---
Though I also gave a fair amount of set up as well. 
---
Due to INT23 I create 120% Cores, with Power User3  that’s 1200 shots per core. So, not much reloading. 
---
Stabilised3 of cause, 3x1 rank of heavy gunner perks.  I could go all in on Heavy Gunner, I have the levels banked, but that’s a lot of Str Perk management.
---
I don’t have 20k caps but just post it on here. I’ve done it many times where I’ve traded in 556’s. The nice thing about 556’s compares to caps is there is not limit of 30k, just weight.
---
Yes I agree!
---
Yes, everyone must be giving shit away or they shouldn’t be bought from. 
---
Fucking fo76. Market mentality is as screwed up as every other part of the game.
---
But wouldnt you want a mechanic that ensured that your friends can join you?  Thats the thinking behind the held or reserved slots. That and you mention a larger build area/ budget for the group, which would be tied to the number of players (currently) and these are supposed factors in server stability. 
---
Then a player would plausibly have to hop over and over so all their teamates could join too. 
---
If you just impose a teammates can be added even of the server is "full" for single players then you could end up with 4x max players on a server. 
---
See what I'm getting at?
---
Shitfest still.  Only the fact that it’s the skeleton of a real fallout game and the value of the fallout ip keep it crawling along.
---
I have a TSE, Berserkers Exploding, Mutants Exploding and several others. All combat. The AAE does about 10% of the damage that the others do.
---
I'd be ok if they didn't do these purveyor sales and just raise legendary enemy spawns for a week/weekend.
---
That would make me play more.
---
Play it again....
---
Johnny Guitaaaaar
---
It’s not the best choice...ITS SPACERS CHOICE! 
---
sorry
---
Grahm definitely has it for under 500. People sell it for crazy prices because they know he's hard to track.
---
Maybe try keeping your eyes open for the Futuretech bundle in the AS.
---
It came with a quiet small generator.
---
I use them almost exclusively by now due to being quiet, tiny and easy to stack and hide.
---
I got 10 scrip from collecting 25 caps while wearing a hat so I guess there’s a variety of difficulties today
---
Responder vendor at one end of the Mall has them.  Also, Responder bot at Camden and Grafton (Town, not Station)
---
Yeah.  That was my mean playthrough.  Sat on the throne, had Benny crucified, opened Mr. House's box, and threw the NCR's general off the dam.
---
Actually, the only thing that was different from my usual playthrough was the general.
---
Yes i see what you’re getting at but you’re picking at the idea too much. It could be a private server function ? You’re looking too deeply into a fun idea. Slots don’t need to be reserved... you can build the camp together and play different servers. Who knows... maybe servers might become bigger with wastelanders. I haven’t came across full servers since launch and even then it was a rarity
---
I haven't seen either of those yet, but I grew up in WV in the 70s/80s so I have seen a lot of it firsthand.
---
Reg
---
I'd love to see more Enclave gear in the game!
---
If you check the link tree link in my profile my PSN profile should be among the listed things. 😎
---
That is way to frequent for 3 star gear. 3 star are supposed to be rare.
---
Ah, the mojave. .
---
The tri version just comes with some extra cosmetics. Check em out then see if it's worth it to you. Personally I'd just stick with the regular version.
---
The people of Charleston were celebrating Christmas when they were flooded and killed by the raiders. As for the quest are you sure you weren't in an event area or something?
---
Hmm, could have been. Thank you.
---
Yeah. I use a BE Handmade and a BFFR Laser as all-purpose weapons. I carry a BE Railway for tough enemies and a BE Pipe Rifle for trash mobs. Even without perks, my Unstoppable Monster does something like 700 damage, so it's a solid situational tool.
---
Closed
---
You could also try out a modded set of power armor. Do you have armor equipped that will help you live with useful stars?
---
Take a pic of a player in a nuke zone while naked...
---
But seriously...ive seen Grahm like 3 times (outside of meat week) in the last 6 months
---
Bethesda: Okay, okay...for $5.99/mo you can have Enclave gear and a n Enclave icon. For only $2.99 more per month you get the special Enclave emote!
---
Name an exclusive discount for FO1st members in the atom shop then. Not exclusive items. An exclusive discount.
---
Fututetech generator bundle or is it a bundle of a lot of stuff for the camp? I’ll keep my eyes out for it. Thanks for the info
---
The slowing effect was reduced from ***2 hours*** to 30 seconds. 
---
It appears to have been something that was overlooked and promptly fixed just 13 days after the release date.  There's no way it was ever intended to last that long.
---
There's at least a dozen unused legendary effects that have been in the files since B.E.T.A.  As I said, it is possible that they might add these effects one day, but just because it's in the data doesn't mean it will be enabled.
---
The last time I should have seen him, only Chally the Moo-Moo was there.  She was just chillin in one of those resource pits.  Probably got stuck and Graham left her fat ass behind.
---
So it’s just outfits and stuff? No like extra things to do?
---
You do realize with this games slow load times by the time someone joined and fast traveled to the queen that 5 minutes would be over right?
---
Problem I have is that all the good perks roll on rubbish armor like leather and wood. I built an enclave scout that uses energy and rifles or atleast tried to but I can't seem to get legendary scout armor.
---
I have a vampires powerfist with heat coils and reduced weight and that is the only weapon that keeps me alive, problem is all my perks are around guns so it's the bare minimum damage it can do really.
---
I’ll make one for you for free if you’re on PC.  I’m almaxmere.
---
I’ll also mod the hell out of it if you throw me some caps.
---
Get ready to pay for it lol.
---
Yep just outfits.
---
It's from the American Revolutionary War so more like 240 years ago. It was a song of British origin making fun of the colonists, but was co-opted by the Americans.
---
I was at your camp a day or two ago!  Thought it looked great.  Good selection of weapons, too.  Especially handmades.  Too bad you didn’t have any bloodied ones left in stock!
---
Thanks, but I’m on XB1

---
The power armor paint is pretty darn good looking.
---
Because FO1st is a scam.
---
No they did protect you from the blast just not the radiation. It's in the wiki, so if you got PA or Rad suit they should work. 
---
This needs to be implemented both in Adventure and NW.
---
But then how do you stand to lose caps? I don’t understand that
---
And three educated coursers come teleporting from the C.I.T.!
---
Don't use brick walls either u can activate a vendor through the cracks where the walls meet
---
Nope, I get it quite often.
---
Great tip I didn't even know that.
---
I don't have any of the decorations either, I'm also waiting for atomic shop items, but just figuring out what decor can work and the structure/shape of the house build to make it look right.
---
The new Thanksgiving display cases are great with clean toys (junk), fasnacht garland decor looks like Christmas Garland, general stuff like that
---
Very nice indeed.
---
if you have 29000 caps and someone buys something for 5000 caps you will max out at 30000 caps, and the rest will go into Todd's pocket ...
---
The vendor machine doesn't care, it will keep on selling and you will get nothing :)
---
The SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquatch should absolutely drop a guaranteed 3 star. The rest should be skewed to 2 or 3 star.
---
Crawl out through the fallout by Sheldon Allman 
---
And I don't want the atoms. Cheers.
---
Sadly
---
Thanks for your help, I get it now
---
Well I haven’t played in a while, last I played the Cap was 20k. 
---
Educate people, don’t mock them.
---
Stick with regular, better off spending the extra cash on atoms in game and buying outfits you actually might wear. Besides you can always get the Tricentennial as an add on at any time...
---
Nuclear Broil, on a budget!
---
I really want BoS stuff too, but it would have to be new assets since all the vast amount of FO4 resources are already in game. Even Maxson's coat. I suppose that takes time? That's the reason I'm thinking. That, and they're making 76 more based on Responders, Settlers and Raiders
---
I've seen him only once in the entire time I've played... so yup.
---
Of course I had him in a workshop *yesterday*, darnit
---
lol real world...
---
Ive played literally once since, no content left
---
My assumption is they're knowingly putting in ZERO work on current challenges as they're planning to replace them with a new system. But really, couldn't they do us a giant favor and just remove some of these from rotation?
---
I use heavy gunner - one of each card ( one \* each ) also Stabilized, Nerd rage , Bloody mess.
---
I use a B25 prime ultracite gatling laser.
---
Seasons would be a cool addition but knowing Bethesda's poor programming, the game thinks he's in the ash heap and it's ash.
---
No changes since 1st IMO. It has zero impact on core game.
---
"Steve, what do the community want? Nevermind, give them eyepatches instead. And a lot of them too!"
---
We know our fans have been requesting these items, so we’ll give them to you! Only $19.99 in the atomic shop!
---
I absolutely hate 1st but to be honest it doesn't have an impact on my enjoyment of the game, I paid for the game once and  I've never spent another euro on it since then
---
You spent up to $50/mo and considered yourself a goldfish?
---
Actually I do want one.
---
My friend and I tried to stay loyal after the membership introduction, and had half of the fun of the Halloween event (all the server crash and lags were really putting off).
---
And now, we don't bother to go online and unlock the freebies.
---
I got Fallout 1st for a month to try it out. Really enjoyed the perks. Playing without it now, it's almost no discernable difference though. I can't farm the food packaging plant/other workshops for my friend anymore, but in 3 days time that only gave me like 200 steaks anyway. I also can't self mule but I rung up a reputable courier for that. 
---
I've never really been bothered by anything F1st was  supposedly giving me an advantage with. Have 30 flux of each now sitting in my stash instead of scrap box and I don't really miss the weight except a little.
---
I'll probably re-up once I see what new perks they'll give, but I wanted to go back without it to see if I missed it much. I don't honestly. But there's not too much of a difference, I like to play on public servers anyway
---
We really like to play together, tho, yes it's repeating and buggy, but the fallout universe is attractive for us to stayed tuned.
---
Still have some hope for the wastelanders, really wish they don't screw this up......
---
I wasn't trying to pick on it, my mind just went to the details of how it all might work and potential problems. 
---
Hazard of being an engineer. 
---
Like I said before I think its a great idea.
---
While I now understand the mechanics that make it impossible, before launch I was looking forward to building simsettlements like towns in this game (rebuilding Appalachia) rather then the place anywhere camp system we have. So sad.
---
I thought thered be defined parcels that you got right next to other players and we'd be able to build up a diamond city of our own, or some such.
---
And they can't be both because you say so? Grow the fuck up, trying to play semantics like this is just pathetic. The ranger reskin was an exclusive item at an exclusive discount available only to to 1st members, deal with it.
---
i shall keep looking and server hopping
---
Honestly yeah, the only point of boiled water is like early level crafting, once you get to like anywhere from Level 5 to 10 you're almost always gonna have purified water.
---
What’s wrong with stalkers rolling pins they are overpowered.
---
&gt; Take a pic of a player in a nuke zone while naked...
---
That one isn't that hard if you have someone to play with. Just pop a radshield grab the camera run in take pictures of each other taking pictures and run out again. 
---
To much trouble for 10 atoms honestly but somewhat doable.
---
Although the atom shop is really expensive, but we didn't mind that much if we could buy something cool to display to each other or have fun with other players.
---
I am now sitting on 2020 atom left and didn't even want to buy a thing lol, guess i am saving it up for the wastelander update?
---
U know I'd actually sit down and play a game of chess lol would be a nice change. Reminds me of the new Vegas minu games
---
mine works fine. dunno whats wrong with your pc / internet
---
I would not call ourselves whales, but we did our part to support the game, what's wrong with that?
---
Random encounter
---
I got a pic today of him at Ammo Plant. But I had to go in my Privet World and Claim ammo plant and another workshop. But the game has all your turrets attack the workshops every 15 to 30 min.
---
If you ever see me out there I'm in it haha. Definetly a grind though
---
My apologies, I’m not entirely familiar with PS4 blue screens; but I do know they can be caused by a host of issues (anywhere from an error in the game’s coding, memory faults, a damaged hdmi cable port, out-of-date patches on console, etc). But I don’t know if yours and OP’s issues are related. What is the reason for moving your PS4 between rooms? Was it for testing connectivity or trying a different tv screen, or something of that nature? 
---
OP sounds like his issues might be related to his router’s firmware (that was just my problem, anyway). Prior to that, my last crash was awhile ago, during a Meat Week event.
---
Been in a lot of knife fights have you?
---
Sounds like you just got bored of the game... With no correlation to FO 1st other than coincidental timing...
---
One of my friend is actually considering to make 1st sub, she thinks that would at least be inviting to us to play together, but she has been quiet about this idea and I cannot agree more.
---
Just like you said, we don't need 1st to enjoy or to make a difference, but we lost our motivation somehow and really would want to get back playing together but don't know how lol.
---
&gt; Remember the skins for the Ranger armor? They were offered exclusively to 1st members and were at a fraction of the cost they would have cost otherwise if they'd just tossed them into the shop. 
---
1. By fraction of the cost, I assume you mean free. Because they were/are free. They were mistakenly listed for 500 atoms and refunds were issued for FO1st members that purchased it for this price. 
---
2. If they release it for a "discounted" price, and not for the original price as well, that is deceptive trade practices. You cannot mark up an item just to mark it down for a "discount". That is illegal in the USA, The EU, Canada, Australia, and most other countries. 
---
See, for something to be legally considered a discount in most countries, it has to have a release price of one amount, and a discounted price of less. What you are suggesting they are doing is illegal in numerous countries. OFC, if you are wrong, then they are falsely advertising a product, which is also illegal in most countries. No matter how you spin it, it is illegal. If you are right, it is illegal. If you are wrong, it is illegal.
---
im still playing
---
I think it’s the other way around, they protected from the radiation but the heat is what killed people in them 
---
Edit: I was wrong, feel free to call me out on it
---
A Nuka-bob, if you will.
---
I don't even need a holotape to make the ambient sound of the world quiet. Does it on it's own. I use headphones at night so it's fine, but during the day it can get rather quiet.
---
I want more BOS gear too.
---
Maybe true, but we all went from fanboys / fangirls to a sudden wake up and worry about this games future (and stop playing it one by one).
---
BTW I myself liked this game a lot, I am actually on both PC and PS4 (2 different friend groups), but it's sad to see almost all of my friends not playing it anymore.
---
Nice, I like your use of different wallpapers for different rooms. I haven't really experimented with the wallpapers as much as I should. I also liked your use of the Thanksgiving display. It's giving me some ideas.
---
I've always hoped there'd a questline or something about following the trail of the world's luckiest idiot, who managed to survive in one of those things, only to end up getting mangled as soon as they set foot in the wasteland. A sort of meta-commentary on what the Lone Survivor must've felt when he got out of the vault for the first time.
---
agree 
---
i named my camp mountown, would be cool if everyone could see that on the map
---
Actually given how many skeletons you find in those...yeah they never worked. Even if they happened to some how save you from the blast and heat...once you open it, the radiation would make you drop dead.
---
Does your friends still play as often as they used to? If you are, what a lucky vault dweller you are!
---
I'm waiting for "capture a deathclaws fart, while not breaking stealth, wearing Power Armour, and blaring Atom Bomb Baby from your pipboy".
---
its all over but the crying, really fits the games well
---
Safe to say or had nothing to do with FO1st
---
Agreed
---
Maybe next time take a picture.. Idk
---
Its unfortunate with the way the game has turned in the past few months due to what i can assume is investors controlling the route of the game
---
I had a weird thing happen to me. I was on a public server on a new character I made and I got the "take/eat 5 chems/whatever else" challenge done. Then awhile passes and I switch to a private server...and get the same challenge again...and I got more Atoms! I mean...I am NOT complaining here...it's just odd.
---
There's really only [one answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzICMIu5zFY)
---
This is getting stupid! It seems this bug gets revisited ever three month or so!  Try defending The Ammo Plant without Turrets. And it seems this time it is getting worst the longer they ignore it!
---
Soooo lucky today, but have to agree. I logged in saw the challenge and said whelp not gonna get that one. 3min later my friend joined me, and there goes Graham towards piosiedon, the mobs inside drew him in, whoot 20 atoms. Lucky!
---
It’s just a cobbled together piece of machinery, it has slot machine parts
---
No issue at all, ill poke you on discord
---
No because I play on potato graphics, thanks for rubbing it in.
---
I got one when it went up for the very first time so got to show off for a couple days haha
---
Yeah, It was a rad rad/mole rat horde event in the ash heap that sent me in there
---
It’s a random spawn, I’ve only seen it once in over 1000 hours.
---
It ain’t that deep
---
How about you input a number of crafting events you want and it auto crafts each separate event, no craft all mishaps no missing out on superdupers.
---
One of the reasons I subscribed was for said discounts...since I do buy items in the Atomic Shop...it was to save money.
---
I was also under the assumption (that I see others had too), that as subscribers, we would get bonuses for staying subscribed...like a new item/outfit/something exclusive to 1st members...per month. Just a little something to keep you subscribed...nothing major.
---
Just more budget please...it's at the top of my list. Right next to an actual official in game chat :/
---
That sounds quite strange, there shouldn’t be such drastic difference. Mutants is only 10% buff so theoretically AAE should outperform mutants’ explosive.
---
jingle jangle jingle by kay kyser. i have no idea why i love it but i do lmao (and same as the other guy, dont need the key, just wanted to share my fav song lol)
---
*i got spurrrrrs that jingle jangle jingle (jingle jangle)*
---
I’ve seen them several times over the past year in the various random encounter spots in the world. They’re carrying notes, right? Like “Cultist’s Reply”?
---
I couldn’t care less if someone wants to buy 1st or not. I don’t need it so I didn’t get it. But my play time has significantly decreased, the same for most of my friends, but it’s due to the lack of new content and nothing to do with the sub. I expect to get back into it more again when wastelanders comes out. The same happened when I played FO4, my interest wained when I’d completed everything in game, then I’d return to it when DLC dropped. It happens with most games.
---
Maybe at some point it was planned the exchange machines would also allow for buying legendaries, then it was changed, but the asset was already made. This is only speculation, though.
---
I'm with you there. I one shot the boss deathclaw during primal cuts once when I was like level 30 something. Didn't think I even could at that point but I did lol. Tried to apologise to everyone with emotes as I wasn't mic'd up.  OP says he was spraying and killing everything though, doesn't sound too accidental based on his version of events but who knows.
---
It’s just the deathskull ones
---
On the first day they gave me the ability to join a horde event and then the event disappears. Oh wait that's been happening 6 months now with no fix!
---
I feel like a broken record on here sometimes. White springs stopped carrying the plans. At least lately
---
Yeah I just had to delete a low level character I made for fun to make a new one so I could play with my partner who just got a copy of the game...
---
Saying that the content is steadily  coming  is a gross overstatement. I have been playing  since launch and to be honest  nothing has really  changed.
---
I don't know why it's happening but here are my 2 cents.  For a while (regular xbox one) we had constant freezes and buzzing like ur saying.  After  trying everything....we got it to stop.  We had to change resolution on tv and xbox.....nothing where the picture looks horrible now....still good graphics.  Basically numbers had to change in settings on both.  Been good since then.
---
I got the same for uranium fever last week.  I was so relieved.  I had been searching for months.
---
Welcome to Nuclear Winter, where hackers win and Bethesda doesn't give a shit.
---
I'm the kind of person who NEEDS to organize my backpack and camp, otherwise it drives me utterly mad. Like cuss at the screen and grimace mad. Not very fun when I have control over something, like my stuff.
---
That being said, it would be absolutely wonderful if I could fully empty out my inventory. Not just keys but unnecessary quest items, like orders or cassette tapes (*cough*overseeer*cough*). 
---
But hey, pipe dreams, right? It seems like we demand so much from a broken game.
---
Damn... so maybe best bet is to switch back to fo4 and just mod the shit out of it
---
Oh that was a cool idea!
---
For my part, I think the one song that always brings a smile to my face when it comes on the Pip Boy radio is Tex Benneke's "Wonderful Guy".  I just start to sway along with the rhythm of the song and sing with these sweet lyrics...
---
*I'm as corny as Kansas in August*    
---
*High as a flag on the Fourth of July*    
---
*If you'll excuse an expression I use*    
---
*I'm in love, I'm in love*    
---
*I'm in love with a wonderful guy!*
---
I see this often but I'll keep responding in the same way to hope I get heard
---
What we need is a rain catcher that makes 5 boiled and a large water purifier that goes in a pool of water that makes 10 boiled water
---
It fixes the problem in a immersive and simple way and lets us balance purified water for drugs and refined goods and boiled water for normal cooking and basic items. They could add it as a QOL item free to the item shop helping everyone and adding some good will for them in the process which lets be honest bethesda I love the game and even I think you need to earn some good will back......
---
I guess you are correct, our / my situation are more related to your situation!
---
Thank you for this comment, too!
---
Some great ideas including keeping it completely solo (my husband and I do that right now).  But I do love the aspect of the game in meeting ppl.  Maybe (not that this is gonna happen) give the option to host or keep completely private or invite only would be a good middle ground.  Then again I am not complaining either way.
---
Yeah I felt bad for slinking away from the idea after it got such a response and so many PMs, but like I said there wasn't a feasible way to implement it without coming off like a little bit of a jerk or at least a let down because there was a lot of players interested. I should have at least made a follow-up post or commented explaining the situation but I got ADHD, man
---
That was my thoughts too. It has me baffled as to why it underperforms so drastically.
---
I mean the BOS never stood a chance they were using miniguns and laser rifles before the patch that made them a viable weapon..... Every day I think of the troubles they went through fighting enemies with weapons that broke after 5mins of use...... Brings a tear to my eye....
