Coast to Coast AM my friend, not as cinematic but it's a radio show that interviews conspiracy theorists and "abductees" and cryptid sightings.
---
---
---
Calibrated Shocks is probably the most important mod to look for.
---
I think it only works for your team and not the temp team you are in while in events
---
I've got it fully modded now. I'm loving the dang thing. I'm gonna keep that one on my vampire heavy that I'm building.
---
Guys, thanks for answering that little riddle, it was driving me nuts!
---
They also decided NPCs wouldn’t be in the game. Everything is subject to change
---
One wasteland doesn't change that at all...
---

---
You still get your end-game gear from completely random legendary enemies that are just in the open world. You should be getting them from actual end-game content like a raid or dungeons.
---
In terms of being an MMO, this game is a joke
---
After learning fixer plan a month go with four rolls from purveyor I got mutants fixer then next week I got zealot and 3 weeks ago I could do 3 rolls and I got all bloodied first was lever action second was my bloodied fixer but prefixes are 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage and then I rolled a Tesla. So my luck is dried up since then
---
Radrats and even radroaches can sometimes survive a hit so.. When I first got my hands on a Fatman, my first shot was aimed towards a group of scorched. Nearly all of them survived.
---
The alternative being getting a mountain of god rolls that are level 35 and turning it in for the same scrip as anything else? Nah fuck that
---
And lunchboxes for bullion as well
---
In that case I want a 3* Troubleshooters 40 Bash Damage +1 agility Pipe Wrench lv 5..
---
It’s because additive multipliers is easier to create challenging content around. 
---
Multiplicative buffs is a pain to balance.
---
For **perks** I suggest:  
---
\* *Heavy Gunner (plus Expert and Master)* (Str). Many people will tell you that you only need 1 point in each because that gives you half of the damage bonus (30% out of the max 60%) for one-third of the perk cost (3 perk points out of a max 9). This is very reasonable if you need to spread out your points into more things. I personally put all 9 points into max heavy gunner perks for the most damage possible.  
---
\* *Bear Arms* (Str).  This one reduces the weight of all heavy weapons by up to 90%, making them lighter than any of your rifles. You're going to want more than one heavy weapon. I run with a gatling for general combat (it's extremely ammo-efficient), a .50 cal for tearing down tougher enemies, and a vampire's minigun for when I need to sustain self-healing and still do damage. They would have a combined weight of around 80, but this perk reduces that to about 8.  
---
\* *Stabilized* (Int). +Accuracy and 45% ignore armor for heavy guns when in PA. This is a significant increase in heavy gun effectiveness. Like you, my gatling hits like a truck and this makes it just that much more effective.  
---
\* *Batteries Included* (Int). Fusion cores are energy ammo, so this allows you to carry up to 10x fusion cores for the same weight as 1. You can pretty much just grab every core you find and not worry about the weight.  
---
\* *Power User* (Int). Allows your fusion cores to last up to twice as long. If you have a hard time getting fusion cores, this one becomes more important than Batteries Included. With both, you'll probably never have any trouble keeping your PA supplied with cores.  
---
\* *Bandolier* (Str). Most heavy guns chew through a lot of ammo, so you'll need to carry a lot. At 2 points this reduces the weight of ballistic ammo so low that you can easily carry tens of thousands of rounds and hardly notice the weight.  
---
\* *Power Patcher* (Int). This one is less important but can still be helpful. It reduces how fast your PA breaks and reduces the repair cost, so it can really reduce how often you need to go farming/scavenging/grinding for rarer materials if your PA takes stuff like Black Titanium or Ultracite to repair. Your choice to use this really depends on whether or not you are struggling to maintain enough materials.  
---
\* *Fix It Good* (Int). Sidebar perk. You only need this on when repairing your PA, but since it allows your PA condition to go up to 200% when repaired you'll need to repair about half as often as normal, saving you more time and materials.  
---
For **PA mods,** since you're still under level 50 and haven't started endgame content, I suggest:  
---
\* *Internal Database* (head). This gives +2 Int. That gives an XP boost around 5% or 6%. It also doesn't take any endgame materials to apply, so you should have no trouble putting it on your PAs as you upgrade (you'll just need new plans if you switch to a different type of PA).  
---
\* *Motion-Assisted Servos* (torso). This one gives +2 Str. More carry weight, better melee damage, and once again requires no endgame materials.  
---
For **weapons** really just use the best things you can get your hands on for now. That gatling will probably continue to serve you well. My general rule of thumb is to keep at least 1 weapon that does high damage per shot, and at least one weapon that has high dps (just multiply Damage x Fire Rate, don't worry that it's not actually per second it's still the right comparison).
---
Half of mine was completed today. I completed another one and it awarded me score for multiple so, it may have balanced out.
---
This isn’t WoW. There’s other endgame grinds besides weapon choice, and it’s not like they’re falling off every enemy you kill.
---
Well if something bad happens to some hack inventory well too bad.
---
And dupes, I still don't understand how a triple a doesn't create unique Id's
---
I want to say I've gotten them from scorchbeasts.
---
Yeah I do more than 10k damage without power attacks myself with unarmed but that's stacking everything there is and farming things for boosts like the mutton meat pie, deathclaw wellington, whiskey, nuka-shine and all basic meat dmg boosts but it's overkill anyway, you only notice it on the SBQ but it still stands that the bloodied stealth commando builds have much higher DPS and much less risk while also needing less of a set-up as there aren't nearly as many consumables involved.
---
I still feel that crazy high melee damage is justifiable to an extent with enough work put in and sacrifices being needed (bloodied is much much more dangerous in close range)
---
I really have no problem with the damage being nerved itself, it just still needs to be enough for it to be fun in normal gameplay and not feel like I am actually hitting mutant monsters with my bare hands so I do hope they do something in the way of increasing base damage or even just the perk cards damage especially in context with higher level enemys having more HP, the hit really is hard for unarmed if nothing is changed before this goes live.
---
Everything that buffs damage was hit. Furious will feel it less than most effects because what was hit hardest were stacks of buffs—bloodied+Adrenal Reaction+Nerd Rage etc.
---
The alternative being an actual MMO loot system that requires you to do **actual end-game content to get end-game gear**. Not just wander around in the open world and kill things mindlessly.
---
I love Gravity Falls but I'm too dumb to solve them, lol.
---
Hah! It can read your true heart's desire unfortunately. Damn RNGesus
---
That looks cool, I'll check an episode out.
---
...
---
aight imma stick to buggy NV Multiplayer mods thank you.
---
All the time. They freak.
---
Nice one.
---
This is what I'be been running all along, despite the nerfs.  Some people are jealous that this nerf will affect me the least, and that I don't have to adapt.
---
True, completely psychological.
---
Wastelanders will either adapt to survive or not.
---
Basically instead of multiplying the stat bonuses together, they are added, giving an increasing separation based on how many effects you stack.
---
 Bloodied stacks the most (therefore is hit hardest) and TSE really doesnt stack many if any so it got hit the least
---
Actually...I have one just need to find it 😂
---
It's a goldmine for nutcases who start out talking about sasquatch and the interview ends on quantum alternate dimensions with "psychic beings", or Angel's. Every damn episode. Enjoy though!
---
So once you’re in the mine, you’re out of the radiation zone, play how you want. I haven’t run my melee character yet, so can’t help you there.
---
As far as ammo. I played 3 hours today. 2 colossal problems, then a fissure site run. Hit West Tek, clubhouse, DMV, etc. I used roughly 4000 5.56.
---
I'll give it a try the whole health regeneration system. Seems to have had a overhaul for the worse.
---
Carbines deal 1000+ damage per shot without crit and headshots, have armor penetration, more ammo capacity and fire rate. Think about it
---
Poorly.
---
Ah I see thanks for explaining it!
---
In the display cases
---
Completely agree on the psychological take.
---
Personally, i love change and the challenges it brings.
---
I mean the script could do something to non duped or hacked items.
---
'triple a'?
---
The PTS stuff is going to be implemented Tuesday or just Colossal Problem?
---
End game was never about gear. It’s all about cosmetics and camp plans!
---
This is basically how it is on the PTS now, just simpler. The map still has higher and lower level areas. It still allows lower level enemies in certain quest-required places too. 
---
It’s not exactly what you’re describing, but it’s the same general idea. Low levels can go anywhere,  but places like the Bog will be a challenge, just not an insurmountable one. High levels can go anywhere too, but low level areas seem to cap at level 25 for basic enemies, 50 for bosses, so it’s more challenging than before but still leaves safer places to goof around in.
---
I’m planning on finding a heavily armed, high-level team of escorts to accompany me...
---
I didn't even think of this but that's perfect lol. Though in this case my other teammate was innocent and I wouldn't want to do that to them. But going to definitely remember this just in case
---
Oh my god.
---
I am so sorry, but I laughed until I cried.🤣
---
Just a Colossal problem, the other stuff is planned for update 22.
---
Just make a car launcher... I can stand waves of mutant kamakazies and rocket toting mole miners, but stand next to a car when it explodes and turns me to instamash.
---
This is what I'm talking about, it was difficult yet fun . And best of all, none of your abilities was nerfed
---
Ah ok. Thanks!
---
I do this in nuke zones but googlywoogly you’re even more fragile.
---
I completely agree with you, though sometimes my bloodied melee hits just dont even register so I feel nerfed already, depending on the severity of the lack of damage I may not even notice it. Unless my hits still dont register then I'll be a walking dropped junk bad just waiting to die to a stray bullet. Yes I know about damage mitigation but after enough hits cause you just can't kill that one enemy that won't matter in my experience.
---
So in my case, unfixed issues are also made worse by all these updates happening at once. Also since I also like going full health shotgun and PA so keeping those perks will just be me losing out on coins, but that's assuming I want to keep it if I'm doing little damage.
---
In general I'm just so glad this reddit exists cause I know they will see this and everyone else that will hopefully be as fair and eloquent as you.
---
Very good build, might actually switch to this one, thanks!
---
I have had to change my shared perk on more than one occasion. Always nice to know someone is as pissed off as you are by "its allowed so its ok" game.
---
Haha, no shame in that if you’re on PS4 I’d potentially be down to help escort you!
---
You're mixing up your stuff. There's two different BoS related additions; *Steel Dawn*, a quest line, slated for fall/season 2 and *Fractured Steel*, the big BoS content update in the winter (&amp; season 3, I presume). Fall was never to be the main BoS season.
---
I like to drop the all star baseball bat with rocket mod because it’s such a badass looking weapon for a lowbie.
---
They would be great if they worked or could be sold. As of right now they are merely a shitty reward that mocks you because the enemies are OP but the grenades based off of them suck so much ass.
---
45/50 is still the max level for gear.
---
I pop leadbelly as needed. A bit of a QoP issue but easy enough. I run Iron(something) for more resistance and damage control at Level 5.
---
It doesn't even fire a shotgun spread or use those perks. I made a post on it before. Its exactly a worse Blackpowder pistol with way worse hit chance.
---
Lol...
---
Ohhh. Interesting.
---
3 times I’ve tried to help out a new player exiting the vault. 3 times I have failed. The last time, they just immediately started punching me.
---
for some reason he decided triple a is shorter than AAA games lol
---
Lol nooooo
---
It wasn’t until level 250 that I discovered YouTube and those videos changed my game. Talk about face palm and no shit, you can do that?
---
They don't exist Legendary at all. It's not in the drop table. It's also only the pistol version and not full size. Uses pistol perks.
---
As it happens, I am on PS4!  I just don’t run a heavy/powerful build....mostly a rifleman/shotgunner.  But I do have a few explosive weapons! Lol
---
I'm still waiting for an irradiated hog. One of the WV greeting cards has a pig on it and every single other thing on that card has a nuclear counterpart except the pig on the greeting card and it just makes me wish we got a hog.
---
Hell, adding a hog and spider in the same update could just be one giant shoehorned Charlottes web reference.
---
Didn't realize you were the one making those decisions. Apologies!
---
Don't forget recent additions have made making an alt from scratch even more unappealing with the Rep/Bullion Grind and scrapping perk cards for legendary points.
---
This.
---
I think I saw an arcade game in season 2 rewards....wouldnt that be awesome.
---
Bethesda is historically pretty bad at balancing games. Approaching 76 as a GaaS-driven game that needs 'balancing' was probably the wrong way to go about it in the first place.
---
Sometimes new features slip by. He has been playing since beta - repair kits came a good bit after. Maybe he didnt re-explore his menus. I know I dont after every new patch
---
Cause u downvoted a downvote so u get a upvote for your downvote
---
I've got a quad double shot gun.   As long as I shoot everything through VATS it's pretty much a one shot and kill.   I've maxed the perks but have found that even with just one maxed out there isn't much that doesn't fall with one shot.  Two suggestions though, max your action perks so they reload fast, second beef up on armour.  When you get close to the enemies sometimes they can deliver significant damage, Colonel Guttys in particular.
---
I wanna die peacefully plaing nuka Tapper, not screaming for backup like the rest of my team did.
---
The underarmor got classed as an outfit in the last update. Unclear whether it’s a bug or not.
---
Better yet, it slows you down. Pretty much an insta-death vs good players.
---
Is that a slightly older / digitized version of Mark Strong?
---
Shotguns can be pretty powerful if you’re able to get your hands on the right ones. I myself am a Heavy who tries to do as much damage as possible.
---
What you didn’t like the copy paste they did
---
Next time I am sitting around leaving my shop open for folks, might just grab one out of storage and give it a go.
---
My next job, find red menace and put it in my shop for 30k. 
---
Or sell it to you for 1 cap. 
---
Either way.
---
You may enjoy this video then.

---
I see what you're saying but I don't see it as simply as an on/off switch. I see it as having a fast car where I'm driving on an open straight road and now there are some curves and hills where I have to break and hit the gas.
---
I ran PTS today and found a notable drop on my bloodied builds effectiveness. However I use a VE 50 as my secondary and it ripped through level 75 supermutants.
---
I will say based on what I've seen with the bloodied drops that it's a bit aggressive. But looking at the market and seeing one particular style weapon always being hot and selling shows there's an imbalance and it should be addressed. So I appreciate the attempt and would like the entire ecosystem to be a bit more challenging for all builds.
---
Are you sure about STR? I remember it working as each point of STR gives approx +4.5% more damage relative to the **base weapon damage** (ie. its not cumulative). So compared to 15 STR, using unyielding armor, food and chems to give you 40 STR, this would still be 112.5% more damage.
---
Its all the mutations (adrenal, twisted muscles, talons), other %-based food buffs and chems that boosted it even more to give such huge damage numbers in the Pip-boy eg. 4-5K on the DCG. If all these now apply only to **base weapon damage** with \~40 STR or even worse **base weapon damage** with 0 STR instead of being cumulative then that will suck.
---
Ya know, I'd have to agree on that if he had a point-ier chin 😂
---
Bloodied pipe pistols make the fatman look like a nerf gun.
---
I have a bloodied fatman and it still doesn't perform to expectation. No 2 shotting swan in Fo76.
---
Why are they debuffing everything instead of buffing everything back to the original specs. Releasing one wasteland which as they state will make enemies more difficult. Then test from there. The panel on quake con struggled to take down the new boss with the most powerful weapons and builds they had and struggled like hell and they want to debuff everyone that's crazy.
---
No I totally loved them, especially the part where they’re all having the exact same reactor problems. Like sheesh, crappy contracting I suppose...
---
Very true, my shotguns do pretty well.  I’m able to one-shot most enemies without perks equipped.
---
Duh. Thank you
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423923/feedback-unarmed-damage-nerf/10?language%5B%5D=en
---
Lol
---
Considered. Have my up
---
What type of shotgun is it?
---
Whyyyyy...
---
Are the launch-able missiles damaging at least..?
---
May have been purely luck or random, but just got a level 50 in the Steakhouse in the weapon cache box
---
Sneak. Do not get hit as a glass cannon my friend
---
You're not friends with Todd.
---
That's rough, especially for me cause I do multiple builds so that's multiple ammo types to account for.
---
I really hope they chill with the nerfs before the update comes out. I do think bloodied deserves a nerf for sure cause I play it on main, but this certainly isn't the way to do it, like from I've been told it's pretty much everything being changed and I would have just preferred bloodied and junkies taking a hit, bloodied more than everything.
---
*gasp*
---
ThE oLd OnE!
---
Ah that's fair, assaultron was great too!
---
Very cool build! Please drink something.
---
Well, looks like to got to the bottom of that problem!
---
Yea, I know. That was terrible. I'll show myself out...
---
YES. THIS. I am so sick of people who fucking hoard legendaries for themselves. I am also sick of me never doing enough tagging on an enemy for it to count as my kill. 
---
I cannot count on my fingers the number of times I have missed out on event bosses and legendaries because the boss died or I was unable to tag them.
---
Thanks for raising the issue, just turned mine off indefinitely.  Glad i didnt get that raider themed vending machine from the atomshop recently
---
You can. 
---
On Xbox you press the favorite button on any junk and it opens a menu that's shows all the types of scrap. 
---
Then just click A on the scrap you want to tag.
---
They kinda remind me of Dungeons and Dragons in their own way. I enjoy them but don’t play them much.
---
By god OP you may have saved us. I'll reserve praise until I can test your method out myself
---
Edit: Heaps of praise upon you. Certainly the best solution to use at the moment
---
Are you talking about the nukes launched from silos?
---
If so, they kill things but you have to launch them from a remote location and they are more for the function of changing the enemies and flora to a more dangerous environment with rare materials and potentially more and stronger legendary enemies.
---
Though if you get a player in the blast it's a kill.
---
I've been playing Bethesda games since Fallout 3, so I can't use the excuse of being fresh to Fallout.
---
This is why Damage Threshold was always the superior system over Damage Resistance. 
---
 If armor blocks 50% of all damage that means it stops 20 dmg on a 40 dmg shot from a pistol, and 2000 dmg on a 4000 dmg explosion.
---
 Explosives need to be heavy, expensive to use, and dangerous to the user, but they should be absolutely disgusting damage-wise.
---
How is it glitched? I'm fairly new at the game.
---
You came in and had to comment though right.
---
Use VATS on a flying Scorch beast, have fun~
---
Yepp, just happened to me. Not sure if its worth to mention just 2 minutes before that, i tried to lay down on a bed, but it did not sleep, instead it froze in to third person, and couldn't switch again between FPS and TPS
---
Check the audio setting: None/Area/Team etc. Or a restart may help if that doesn't fix it.
---
Did they fix the Mr. Pebbles backpack? They broke it after a patch sometime ago. Haven't tried it in a while.
---
What are you talking about? Are you trying to enter the part for the free states quest? Pretty sure you can only get in that part 1 time. 
---
Or are you talking about the burrows?
---
The normal part of harpers ferry is open so I’m confused.
---
I remember hearing that the adds will drop ammo for whatever gun you have equipped, i guess this didnt make it into the event.
---
Reminder that Meat Week starts Thursday, not Tuesday
---
Time travel is our response lol
---
I got bit today myself. The first time.
---
I completed yesterdays challenges &amp; never play NW, so its not that.
---
All of them but that pathetic weekly 100 score for 10000 xp checked off  and I just just logged into the game for the 1st time since yesterday. They are different challenges too.
---
No point in putting in a ticket, just get the canned "sucks to be you response".
---
This auto complete bug has been around for ages, you would really think that Bethesda would have made this a priority to fix before this season grind, or would at the very least compensate a player for the lost score in some way. They CAN award atoms, I don't think its unreasonable for them to award at least 150 atoms (1 tier) to players that get  hit with the bug to compensate for the lost score. Of course they want to try and force players to buy atoms to complete the challenges, so I guess  that wont ever happen. Glad I'm at tier 91.
---
Wanted to complete the season just by playing, but I'm really pretty sick of it at this point &amp; would just as soon get it over with. I have more than enough atoms to do that, since I don't really use them very often &amp; I saved a bunch before the season started.
---
In typical Bethesda fashion they didn't plan this Legendary Run out very well. When you finish the season,  there isn't much point in playing since you cant bank score like you could atoms under the old system.
---
They had it in beta from what I understand. Pretty sure it was taken away because of how it could be abused.
---
I honestly don't remember. It just seems like the "some players might pay..." price was always just a little higher than the range, and now it's usually much higher. Just an interesting change, that's all.
---
I definitely like the improvements, though.
---
And why a slide bar for numbers? I should be able to input the number of whatever I'm messing with. 
---
Like, pop up a keypad where I can press number buttons. A slider bar on anything 1000+ is RIDIC.
---
Fuck. Thats happened to me before too. Shooting and I know it hits em and they take zero damage. It's been happening more and more too.  They need to zero in on that. It's highly fuckin frustrating!!
---
Can you explain how nerfing one build but leaving the others the same makes them viable?
---
Good suggestion
---
So spawn somewhere else.
---
Yes, unfortunately you'll just have to restart the entire Vault quest again from outside working back inside. Progress is set as a per server instance so it'll need to be done entirely from the beginning.
---
Go else was Jangles to read his comics in the dark?
---
Are they account wide now? I thought they were character bound like the level ups for the legendary perks
---
I have a troubleshooters and a tse.  Don’t know offhand the specifics on them, but the troubleshooters tends to one-shot most everything in vats
---
Huh that’s weird thanks for the link.
---
If there is a way which it can prevent it from being abused that would be awesome but yeah i can see how people can troll with it .etc
---
Yah like spawning underground with only the embrace of the void to save you?  Cause that how you spawn underground with only the sweet embrace of the void to save you.
---
Maybe they should really test this stuff out BEFORE they release it though? Not just drop it and say good enough, fingers crossed. It's like everything they do is broken on release and they'll get around to properly fixing it down the line, Maybe sometime.
---
After losing much flux to mirelurk hunters/kings after SBQ, I made it a priority. I'm running some absolute junk armor just to have forest scout with poison resist.
---
Missile launchers sort of suck, but apparently grenade launchers are pretty good.
---
I just bought the four coloured machines and restocked em all to swap em out. Guess I'll be doing that again in the future :/
---
I always put a bullet in the ISS while it's still invisible, then go tank the pylons.  It still counts as a tag.
---
Yes, there's no NDA for the PTS since it's now public and open.
---
Maybe I'm talking about the Free States Quest. That could be the problem: I don't have this quest.
---
Ok. I am not a 76 noob but I am still having a hard time understanding what people mean when they say they are "tagging" an enemy. Are we talking about just shooting/hitting or do you mean VATS? or something else?
---
Yes, yes, yes.
---
I originally got the prime receiver for it because the one for the gauss minigun is broken, and then I decided to try it out with my extra gold.
---
Now I'm a pistol build.
---
Ok, at least we know Bethesda understands nukes may or may not be able to kill someone...
---
If the change to effects from multiples too additive was only to manage further upgrades, then every weapon should be getting a flat base damage upgrade, otherwise the changes reason is loaded.
---
This is in the same boat as the concrete donation debacle, bethesda doesnt not playtest this game much, and when if they do, the people testing it arent gamers.
---
I am experiencing the same issue. Is there any way to refresh the camp skin without having to actually move the camp?  I removed the skin option in my Atom store inventory, but the bug causing skin still appears on my camp even after resetting the game.
---
I still don't understand how so many people are supposedly joining private groups with strangers who troll them by building an ammo factory in their camp. It just sounds like an excuse from people who don't want to admit they blueprinted the thing themselves.
---
Pve players are dumb for getting mad about this nerf, where I'm concerned with this is PVP, I know loads of God tier bloodied builds that can tank anything (including other bloodied builds) and now the damage is waaaay lower is gonna be way harder to kill each other now
---
If I heard correctly, ALL damage buffs are additive now. There might be one specific exception, I saw someone mention it elsewhere but no recall what it was or if it was ever proven.
---
Well if it's anything like FO4 it would be an absolutely useless legendary effect as it would only add 10 damage over 5 seconds with no stacking, with no way to boost damage and every enemy having a ridiculously high resistance to it.
---
It's why the incendiary effect also sucked, they were 2 of the worst legendary effects in the game.
---
Considering how they plan to in the PTS I really wish they would forget trying to balence the game!
---
The one good thing the brotherhood did was blow you guys up in the future so you don’t invent time travel
---
They can’t break my build, I never had one to begin with. I’ve run an ad hoc build since the beginning, don’t need to be top tier to pve.
---
Doesn’t really look like him
---
I’m sure we did
---
From what I understand they changed buffs to additive instead of multiplicative. So bloodied and junkies were the hardest hit because they stacked so many buffs, but it's really an overall nerf.
---
It's a bit too late to make the game fundamentally challenging and lots of players are comfortable with the fun, stress-free game set up in 76 at the moment.
---
I disagree, the numbers that the Fatman CLAIM to put out is fair, however, it seems like even tho a bloodied Fatman does 2500plus damage if not more, when i shoot an enemy like a gutsy or the SBQ it seems like it only does around 15 to 80 damage per shot even having stabilized perked and wearing PA.. This does not seem to be the case with all explosives but fatman and missile launched just don't do anything... they need to rework resistances to explosive weapons not the damage they do.
---
I donated months worth of passively collected (500) cork, so I could get more random mats, and a f%@king prime 10mm receiver plan.
---
They can shove their event.
---
It's on my bedside table, no projection on nearby walls or ceiling.
---
You mean besides taking a workshop at the power plant?
---
I agree just give us so many unlocks for what rank we are leave the perk cards alone.
---
Release one wasteland and rebuff all the weapons to what they used to be. See how the community deals the new difficulty. 
---
The enemies are more difficult every build is viable again  and then make changes from there.
---
[removed]
---
I one shot the imposter sheepsquatch with a bloodied mirv once. Wasn't really intentional, but I high tailed it out of there before I got mobbed.
---
Never too late for change IMO. I am looking forward to the potential that awaits. Something other then the same ole same ole will be a welcome change for me.
---
Did you know a cockroach can survive a nuclear blast
---
You got the text chat mod?
---
It's amazing how many high levels don't know that I'm healing both npcs and their lazy assets with my shishkebab!
---
Colateral damage, before this script run make a new object in the game that add a tag to items the player put in. Those items tagged will be able to be restored If any unintended damage is done.
---
This flaged items will be listed so if any hacked items go through this process it will be eliminated.
---
If any player wants to protect their items they must tag them before the script process goes through.
---
Triple A is AAA game publisher.
---
That's OK, cause you guys got your predwen blown up. All those lives lost...Oh and your best pladin was made from our technology. Ad victoriam lol. We should of killed Maxon when he was a squire.
---
Each of the workbenches at the power plants has a resource extractor that outputs fully-charged fusion cores. Also, I find that BoS events, especially Line in the Sand, tend to reward a couple of full cores on completion fairly frequently.
---
Players are still going to be one-hitting the majority of enemies with the new changes. Mixing up the formula is good, but I won't be surprised when a lot of players end up disliking the changes.
---
Thats rough. hopefully it gets sorted outand you get to usem
---
where is the power plant?
---
Yup! 45 round drum with vampires is fun, as is [vampires fss boxing on drugs. ](https://youtu.be/X5BA9xd4iIU)
---
What’s your carry weight like with this build?
---
Nothing remained the same. 
---
AA itself didn't get hit, but if you used any damage cards there is a difference
---
Also this tag system create a "unique Id" for the item. 
---
Add same system to drop tables and this is solved.
---
I though being as the legendary run is account wide not character specific that you could use the rewards on other characters? I have another one but haven't tried it out yet.. this is disappointing though....
---
One would have to assume that the Enclave in the games set after Fallout 2 would be very different from the Enclave in Fallout 2. It's possible that the Enclave could have been rebuilt from forces in continental outposts, and at that point it can become nearly anything you can imagine it to be. But only 25 years after the nuclear exchange, at that point you're still talking about the pre-war US government/military.
---
Still bugged. Bethesda is Vault Tech and this game is a Vault experiment. These are features, not bugs.
---
I agree with you. I think any weapon that has been duped in any form should be totally erased from all the players stash boxes.
---
I do. But the Fatman also deals explosive damage so those little a-holes should at least die to that.
---
Yeah, I have no idea why the other commenter brought that up, I thought it was really strange as well.
---
Check here:  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Bloodied builds lose about half their damage, and still have the highest DPS in the game lmao. 
---
The changes to how damage modifiers stack are good, especially for the future of the game. Plus we'll have legendary perks to help shake up the meta and bolster various builds. One Wasteland will make more locations and events interesting for higher-level players, *and* finally eliminate the mid-game difficulty spike for lower-level players. Daily Ops are a ton of fun. I'm really happy playing with everything in the PTS, this is probably the best update since Wastelanders.
---
Don't feel to bad I'm a level 421 and just realized today you can only use one bobblehead at a time. I never bothered to look at the active effects. I'll eat like five at time.... so many wasted.
---
I agree but I cannot remember an update where someone was no happy about something that they did. I don’t think people were happy when beta went to live, if I remember correctly.
---
It sucks....but just don't take scrap to a workshop.
---
My thing is, Bloody was high risk high reward. You could kick asses easy, but one fuckup and you were dead. Well, now you'll still be dead, but they won't be. I am bummed. Not angry, I view this as an important step in properly balancing the game, but it certainly makes bloody a useless build because the risk far outweighs the gains.
---
I use my private server for all those types of situations. I have always detested PvP.
---
There's generally very valid reasons for people being unhappy over the updates.
---
There is no visible timer.  Your allotment resets 20 hours after your first purchase.  That is why I do mine early in the morning and at the same time so they reset at the same time every day.
---
Junkies increases as health decreases?
---
There would not be a lake then!
---
It'll be in the atom shop. I'm waiting for the trick or treat bowl again. There's a hand that grabs you filled with candy in it lol. I got my Halloween candy all ready to go for October lol
---
Glad to hear it. 
---
I am looking forward to scrapping cards I do not want, honestly. Much of the new things sound interesting, and I accept that everyone will not be happy, but that is life. I for one would rather have true opportunity to try something new then be stuck doing the SSDD. LoL.
---
Skyrim: coming to the TI-84 Spring 2021!
---
Shy of 300.  Honestly don't worry about carry weight.  Its not as important as killing thing.
---
The Poseidon Energy Plant, just east of the Nuka Cola Plant at the south edge of The Forest has a Fusion Core machine. The other plants do as well, I think, but this one is currently low level and easy to clear or defend. Either clear the event and reboot the power plant to provide it with enough power to run or stick a Fusion Generator next to it. Either way, you will have to claim the workshop to access it unless someone else has powered it and doesn't mind you pilfering their cores.
---
I do recommend you do this on a private server, yours or a friend's, unless you enjoy having to defend it against other players.
---
Posiden, Monongah, etc...
---
Np!  It worked for a long time until I went to bloodied.
---
IDK, a lot of things don't make sense, like there being Super Mutants only 25 years after the nuclear exchange. And on the East coast, no less. The Master was creating Super Mutants *on purpose*. They're not supposed to be a natural phenomenon from the events in the nuclear exchange. I probably haven't gotten deep enough into the Fallout 76 story to see how this is reconciled yet, but I certainly have seen big vats of FEV.
---
So are they banning people for this or what?
---
If there are 2 brotherhood additions then the first edition will be in the second season will it not?
---
I do think it's not well implemented, but I like the idea of making the players weaker and the mobs stronger. Makes the game feel more lethal with an actual danger of dying. (I understand it might be an unpopular opinion), but I enjoyed soloing a Daily Op today on PTS. Actually felt like a challenge, it's been a long time since a mob straight up, killed me.
---
Holy crap, had no idea this was goin on. I was thinking about picking this up on pc as well... buuutt now nooo thanks
---
This is why pvp shouldn't have been added to a (normally) single player RPG in the first place. Should have just made the game a normal drop in/out co op game but then they couldn't do the "live service" BS. Also that sucks OP some people just want to ruin other people's fun.
---
Ah okay thanks for the tip and heads up
---
As the director of the institute and many years advanced, we know exactly who is doing this.
---
And those lol are the Brotherhood. We should eliminate them all and have a better future for mankind.
---
Mankind - Redefined
---
Most likely because they do not like it. But that is your opinion as is mine. As I said in another rely, I would rather have the opportunity to try something new then be stuck doing the SSDD.
---
There will never be a change that everyone is happy with in any game or in any circumstance.
---
Np!
---
You're walking through a cave and it gets darker and darker until you cannot see. Then you kick on your pillow light and are greeted my a massive swarm of irradiated spiders slowly lowering from the ceiling and crawling towards you
---
This! And you can add a buzzer to go off when they open it
---
So, are they banning players with the ammo factory at their camps or not? I’m confused, seems like its in your best interest to have one at the moment
---
no problem.  Are you on PS4? If so add me.   Also sooner or later its good to decide on a weapon build.  That will dictate your perk cards.  Any ideas on what you wanna do?
---
Todds afraid of spiders
---
If you have the raider collectron station it’s great for new characters
---
4K Atoms
---
They need to give us the Pip-Boy app from FO4.  It played holo games.
---
If it won't be pushed back due to the issues with Colossal (as to make it more paced out) it would logically come with the same patch the season comes. But fall's/second season's main theme was not supposed to be the BoS. They are hyped up gradually with Atlas &amp; then Steel Dawn.
---
Very true. I do believe that there is one gun in 76 with the incendiary effect and it sucks on there as well
---
My psn is boredomshaman
---
Just make sure you bring alot of bullets, that alpha is a heap of trouble!
---
Charlie should be full of ghouls.
---
Do you mean getting past the wall?
---
Thanks for the amazing work.
---
Any word on Chisatos Automated Inventory Dumper tool being updated? I know it wasn't specifcally you guy's project but it was featured on your site. Man that tool was awesome and a time saver.
---
The former.
---
Someone last night had a flamethrowing plasma gun on ps4. Is that...,is that even a thing in the game?
---
Those aren’t bad, with some of the right perks that TSE could be pretty powerful
---
Collateral damage isn't going to fly. Also scanning items before they have script go over them just sounds likely to stuff something up along the way
---
It probably was me haha.. Seasonal white power armor?
---
I think I’ve played too much. I read that in her voice.
---
It would complete if nobody donated anything, so yes it completed.....
---
I beleive the coins are character bouund. The total number of slots is account wide. So if you have a lvl 300 character all your characters wil have 6 slots.
---
[deleted]
---
Black knight....seen it if was on pc.i would pay for that
---
Some people are that way when the cameras come out lol
---
I was almost thinking about switching my mostly rifle build over to a shotgun build because of how powerful they seem to be.  Can’t imagine what they would be like with the actual perks...
---
You should also have a flammer for healing your group
---
You'd have a great yin &amp; yang, frost &amp; fire thing going
---
That was my understanding but wasnt sure if they made some big change in this PTS update
---
Yes, that and using them for some recipes and to drink.
---
Havent seen any changes except 2 points per card scrapped in the latest PTS
---
If it’s super irradiated, use power armour with emergency protocols.
---
Yup its an easy way to get your 1,400 caps per day.
---
Then you're erasing the majority of weapons, armor, aid, and the like. Bad take you got there, bud
---
Edit: downvote me all y'all want, but I'm right.
---
Basically. Or to drink it/dilute tons of stimpacks
---
If you take over Poseidon Power plant, monongah power plant, or thunder mountain power plant, they have fusion core machines you can power up that produce full fusion cores. Poseidon is the easiest. Monongah is up by Grafton dam and it’s easier than thunder mountain, which is I think in the bog area.
---
Yeah, my heavy gunner will take a break for awhile. I like the level 100 enemies. The XP is definitely worth it. I just feel bad for all the non bloodied builds. If anything, if you’re not min/maxing, you’re new game is ammo making.
---
Beth is screaming at me to run a PA heavy build.
---
Correct, it’s team and proximity based.
---
I haven't heard of anyone being banned specifically for that. It may be an exploit but it uses the simplest game mechanics there is. Still, after clearing the ghost budget completely, you can move your CAMP and it will be stored, occupying a tiny fraction of your resources.
---
If you're getting free legendaries who cares if the event fails.
---
What’s the maths on 1400/day?
---
Yeah, it's the trade off for sure.
---
Converted munitions factory will become the new pvp spot.
---
Pretty powerful. I have an Instigating Guass Shotgun and am pushing around 800 damage with it when I have on my Shotgunner perks as wells as Demolition Expert, Nerd Rage, and Bloodied Mess
---
Missile launchers absolutely suck
---
Ignore this douche.  He’s mad about his inverted penis and taking it out on you.  I’ve had my PS4 for years and never touched that button or knew how it worked.  Some of us don’t give a shit about sharing video.
---
So ill take that as a yes... Thx!
---
Other than vegetable starch, what recipes is it used in?
---
I don't remember.  I have not had the need to sell water in a long time.  I sell helmets for my daily cash.
---
Also for converting stim packs to diluted stim packs and the same thing with radaway
---
So you hate getting loot?
---
I mean, if there really is that many innocent players that have been trolled, how are they to know? Seems weird to me, sure delete them all from camps, but then what?
---
This is true. Beth would just finish it with some big donations at the end of the time limit anyway. They want to make community challenges, but what the community does doesn’t matter. 
---
We would’ve failed at Concrete and had barely a base for the BoS to arrive to. Think if that happened and then we had to do more rep quests for them to “accept” our help to do their main quest line.
---
Vault tec generator skins. If you have it place it down store it place it as a normal small gen scrap, rinse repeat.   
---
Easiest to make a blueprint with the vaults on a foundation place it store the foundation all go in place normal gens you and in one go you will have gotten ridden of the ghost if you only place 1-3.   
---
Important note do not build anything else as once you leave the server if you have you will be over budget. Just get rid of the ghost and server hop.
---
about 1400 caps every day
---
plz elaborate  i have no idea wtf this means ahahaha
---
Nice!  I am JUST about to finish wastelanders and will be looking to grab one of those.  Looking forward to it
---
Youre regurgitating vitriol and clearly havent been on the PTS
---
What would be the proper way to fix it?
---
Sure, but I cheerfully point out that last time they did it (Colossal Cancel) peeps flipped their shit. It's damned if you do and damned if you don't, so all you can do in those circumstances is get as close as you can and then release it and see.
---
Yes, I forgot about the diluted meds, thanks.
---
Folks paying for a looter shooter like getting loot FYI. Can't do that when you one shot end game bosses.
---
"Unarmed went from 1400 down to 400 dmg".
---
I've been playing the game with my Unarmed character on and off since BETA but this one sentence might actually make me quit the game for good.
---
Y'mean like those Ops they got coming in?
---
Not just PC, on PS4 too. I met a guy who's using a gltched plasma gatling: it shoots like a shotgun and has insane damage.
---
Dont do pvp.
---
Yeah, I've seen someone from my "team" one-shot a legendary, but I'm still able to loot, since I'm there with them too.
---
My handmade I named “Ghoulish Overkill” will have to be renamed to “Kill?”
---
Do you use any perks to buff lmgs
---
How do you sell all the water though
---
280
---
The gear from those wont be special to them though lmao. You'll just get a random legendary for doing it like everything else.
---
I don’t care if people afk as legendary enemies are not hard to kill anyway
---
I for one, look forward to collecting resources and making ammo constantly. Was thinking about trying something different than bloodied, but there’s only 24hrs in the day to make bullets.
---
Well this is good news!! Seems they already ran with a similar idea. Sweet
---
Eat....bobblehead? What has this game done to you?!?
---
I'd say not worth it.  It makes sense to me for 2 reasons to leave it as is:
---
1.  The time would be better made making other new content.  
---
2.  Ultimately - 1 of the 3 is going to be the one ran 95% of the time.  Unless there is something forcing the other 2 to get used.
---
Hope your and everyones legacy get deleted. Nothing personal.
---
It's always sunny reference?
---
Take this red arrow, and GET OUT OF MY SWAMP!
---
For people starting out, \*not\* having drops of gear levelled for them might be more harmful than good. Wouldn't that make everything underlevellled "legacy"? Just imagine the price tag for a level 1 unyielding set.
---
Build the gatling laser at a craft bench with super duper. Each gatling laser comes with a fresh fusion core even after you scrap it. Super duper lets you get a 2 for 1 if it activates
---
I guess you can shove them somewhere else.
---
I don't care about AFKers, I care about me getting the rewards I deserve to get instead of getting screwed out of them by overzealous jerks with superguns.  Whether or not they implement some kind of participation check is completely irrelevant to me.
---
It's not a balance. Balance is when all weapons are approximately equal in usefulness, when the explosion in damage is approximately equal to speed or crit, when the player can choose what to use without fear of being useless.
---
Now if you do not play commando or machine gun, you are useless. Pistols are useless. Shotguns are useless. Where is the balance? Do you see him? I don't see either. Damage nerfing will not solve the problem, in the same way there will be top meta assemblies - carbine, machine gun. Just now, to destroy the target, they need 1-2 shots, and then 3-5.
---
Let me try to understand this...
---
You believe the majority of items are duped, and this means deleting them is bad?
---
We already have scorpions and ticks, so that's two.
---
I have a two shot 90% reduced weight fat man, I only break it out to hunt molerats
---
I think it's lazy because it sidesteps the real issue There are only two viable builds because of the interaction of cards,  armor,  etc. The rest of the effects are essentially useless because there is no similar synergy. Instead of trying to create cards, mutations,  or whatever to create that synergy,  they decide just to force everything into a damage window. That's lazy. Its apparent that we will never see a viable berserker build or anything else. This will end up exactly like the survival damage cap. Faster fire weapons will be the meta.
---
Try Monsters Among Us podcast for listener stories. The Cryptonaut podcast is great if you’re interested in deep dives into the obscure and like to laugh at the same time.
---
Wish I knew their intentions behind the damage nerf. If it's a fix for rubber banding and vats then I'm mostly ok with it. If it's an attempt to balance build then it's only going to shift people to legacy and magic weapons making it even more unbalanced in the long run. Just buff the crap legendary effects and add a higher penalty for death.
---
Yes I do, because they have been. Anyone who thinks majority of weapons and armor haven't been duped are just lying to themselves. If they erased literally every DUPED item, they would 100% lose majority of their player base. So, yeah, it would be pretty bad
---
My problem is the weight of the ammo. I have a TS Fatman that's just for fun. Last meat week I used my TS auto grenade that did pretty well as long as it's from a distance.
---
I've seen on the wiki that the plasma gun has flamer barrel mods. I believe this is a legitimate thing and not a hack.
---
Lol that sucks
---
I highly doubt we ACTUALLY did but Bethesda will say we have
---
By "Ghost Budget" I meant the budget stored despite there being no items in the Stored category.
---
You are assuming everyone will think that legendary perks are so good they will want to scrap all excess perk cards, that is probably not the case.  I am sure there are some must haves but I doubt there are a lot.  In any case its a choice no one is being forced.
---
Yes, but considering it's a level for a daily, you should get some anyhow.
---
Is your NAT open in internet settings?
---
Diluted radaways and dirty water are my go-to's.
---
Put the radaway somewhere easily accesible on your quick wheel
---
Same happened to me today
---
Well you did try to take his workshop afterall
---
Yea the coins are account wide , that was stated when they first announced the legendary perk system.  Maybe somebody who playing on PST with 2 characters can confirm for us
---
That’s actually legit. It’s a weapon barrel type for plasma rifles.
---
There’s an achievement for being at ground zero of a nuke strike. It’s something else to stand there and watch that missile come down on top of you.
---
Welcome to the wasteland
---
I keep a copy of Automatron in my inventory at all times. I love Robotron and it is exactly that. I can kill a few minutes playing that any time.
---
I wanted this for so long because I had a base on the edge of a cliff and it spawned me at the base
---
It was unclaimed. I had just taken it and he fast traveled over and wrecked me. I just wish it was a more even match is all.
---
Again what I wrote will remove it.  I have already tested it. The only block is that you need atoms to purchase the compact small gen or the starter bundle that has the vault tec gen. If you already have say the starter bundle when it was on sale for 120 caps or 180 caps or 200 caps then you can do this as a fix.
---
Great video. They guy seems like a very pleasant person to have coffee with
---
I am the one who knocks - reference
---
Yeah just wish I had a chance, workshops shouldn't be just for broken high level builds.
---
That may have been a legacy exploding Gatling plasma with the shotgun barrel modification.
---
Ha! Yeah, the whole overkill thing is kinda not there anymore.
---
There is a YouTuber named "Oxhorn"  that gives a lot of lore info on the game.

When were that high level we do have moments where we have to male some fun
---
Yeah it looks super cool, doesn’t work sadly as a viable weapon, it preforms as a bolt action even though it looks like an smg
---
Also the urban operative underarmour glitches through a few outfits.
---
I think most died off due to, you know, they’re prey becoming way more difficult to catch and also probably since there wouldn’t be enough space to fit they’re webs and catch bugs or wastelanders.
---
I rocked a two shot ff auto grenade launcher for a while, it was a beast for Line in the Sand. I’d stand on the outer wall and lay down a full magazine across the whole spawn area. What I didn’t kill I tagged so I got max xp.
---
*Negatively
---
I did and it hasnt been updated yet.
---
I have a feeling we did but i want to make sure we did.
---
I didn't know that was a thing. I really thought it was a hacked weapon, he was talking about it with his friends while building an underground part of a CAMP for ammo crafters.
---
Solution: don’t carry tons of junk around. I regularly stole junk from people at workshops, which are designated PvP areas.
---
You sell each one for 5 caps. 
---
The Industrial versions generate 1 per minute (regardless of how many you have) and have a capacity of 5 each.
---
So if you have 12 of them, you swing by your base once an hour and collect 60 of them.
---
Combined with all the other things you can sell, is pretty easy to get to 1400 caps.
---
ToxicFluffle (:
---
Radshield offers more rad protection and doesn't suppress mutations. I use it anytime I make a quick trip into a nuke zone
---
Yes!
---
WE DID IT, BOYS! GET 'EM OUT!
---
I'm a big fan of Oxhorn; I love his writing and attention to detail. He can be pretty funny too (if you like self-aware corniness).
---
I just did thise a couple days ago for the achievement =)
---
Thanks for the reply. Yeah, that will have been the thing that triggered it, I'm afraid. Playing during the update is the one reason I didn't bother mentioning because it's the most common cause and I assumed everybody knows about it. It still sucks, you're absolutely right.
---
Could you tell us how to do it as well, I had no idea!
---
I levelled up 6 times at radiation rumble today. I put a round into every ghoul that ran past, and let them go to the grinder that was six level 500+ players with legacies. We had pretty much come to an unwritten agreement that they don’t touch anything until it got past me.
---
I broke a 100% bloodied auto grenade launcher on 1 wave of scorched during line in the sand so...
---
I'll download an episode of each and give them a try on my next long drive. Thanks for the tip!
---
Umm... it’s pretty easy. If your on PS4 I can just jump over and open the gate
---
This has been thrown around a lot today.
---
They're not nerfing bloodied.  They're nerfing multiplicative damage stacking.  It just so happens that bloodied uses a lot of that.  It really affects all builds at some level, and bloodied sees the largest numeric difference as a result.
---
Sounds pretty out there, which is a positive thing.
---
Legacy explosive energy weapons seemed like hacked weapons, because Bethesda never meant for those weapons to roll with the explosive prefix. So, they don’t shoot lasers or plasma anymore, and look like regular bullets. If you’ve never seen one before, I could see how you would think it was hacked for sure.
---
Everyone is nerfed. Bloodied just got hit a little harder.
---
If you don’t want to burn through ammo, it’s still the best.
---
what is the point of diluting stim packs? sorry if that’s a stupid question
---
Yes I do.
---
Weren’t they all using bloodied builds in that stream the other day
---
Wow!  Why didn't I think of that?  Oh wait, I did.  It was at a public event.
---
What about if they are at workshops? Do like 30 of them stay in their budget when they leave that workshop ?
---
Little green ghouls!
---
Even more reason to be carrying zero junk.
---
Sighs in bullets.
---
Who cares about AFKers when right now everyone is punished who doesn’t shoot the legendary enemy. Let everyone get a chance at loot who participates in the event or spawn more legendary enemies in the event. 
---
No one should be punished for picking the wrong enemy to shoot at.
---
Civilians wanna stay clear while the bells ring
---
It was junk FROM THE EVENT
---
I would love more mods for lower tier weapons to buff them. How about nunchuck mod that combines 2 rolling pins lol.
---
I heard they will be removed from the game eventually, but 30? That would be a dick move since it could lead to server instability.
---
Whitesprings vendorbot, Pendleton has a ton of plans you should look at. BOS Vendorbot, Phoenix in Watoga Shopping Plaza has lots of plans too. The trainstation vendors cycle their inventory now and then, so you might get lucky and land some plans. Vendorbot Wallace in Harper's Ferry is another viable option that has a ton of plans. Grahm if you can find him, and of course, other players! Definitely check vending machines that carry plans, some people sell a ton for cheap. (:
---
Explosive weapons have just absolute shit durability.
---
Then it’s hardly a ton now, is it? Even now, after I’ve been completely wiped on all five characters, junk, weapons, armor, levels etc, the junk I’m picking up at a public event is small time I couldn’t care less about losing its so insignificant. Even if I get all the junk present. It’s after a scavenging run and you get caught up in a fight and lose it is when you get pissed.
---
It's because of the way its calculated
---
No, because then people will just afk for rewards.
---
The solution to your problem is grouping.
---
If a group member hits/kills something, you also get to loot it.
---
It’s a very dumb and lazy approach just like the carpet nerf of all builds. Just make everyone level 50 fresh out of the vault and call it a day, no need for this leveling bs at all. Nobody needs to grind for legendary/builds either since there’s not much difference anyways.
---
I'm just completely burnt out on good will towards this company and this dev team. It's always broken stuff with them. It's gone from I love this great software developer to what did they break now and how are they going to nickel and dime us today.
---
Actually, pistols got quite a huge buff, as tank killer now applies to them. Not only that, but pistol and shotgun builds are actually quite powerful. I have a friend who runs both on different characters, and he can do quite a bit of damage. I have a shotgun build in progress, and at level 30 he can dispatch max level ghouls with ease.
---
No lifers
---
I am going to try and chill out in my base, put on 'happy camper' and spend an evening with WasteLad.  I am really wondering how long the campaign will take.  1 hour, 100 hours?  I know that back in the day, I could burn 100+ hours on some of those old Ultima style games.
---
All I can say is that if completing it doesn't unlock some perk or main game quest, then it will be a HUGE wasted potential on the part of Bethesda.
---
i know that feel. 1H and 2H arent effected this way though it seems. and the unarmed fuckery might be just broken. we'll see in the next iteration i guess.
---
With those it’s exploits most of the time. Die hard players are usually around 600-700 no exploit
---
Tell me about it! We barely scraped in 15 million concrete, but that much cork was donated...yeah right.
---
Just make all rolls possible. There are 4th and 5th unused legendary star slots. Let us roll new modifiers using modules. I want a TSE FFR VamP antiarmor weapon!
---
+1 for anti epileptic strobe lights.
---
In my case over a thousand. And I still didn’t have a fully complete build or my perfect gear set. I had the weapon, but not the armor.
---
Not in the UK but I wouldn't mind playing still. (: I have a level 169 (I think? lmao) and a level 51. Been playing on and off since beta though, so I know the game well enough and wouldn't mind helping you out. At least with dailies/weeklies if nothing else. My PSN ID is ToxicFluffle
---
I stay away from the church because of that.
---
As of the last few minutes the events site updated and shows Cork in the green, so yeah we completed it.
---
1/55,000+ odds to get a specific weapon is ridiculous.
---
I couldnt agree more! Dont know how many times I walked away with nothing because I couldnt find the !$#@!@#$!@#$!@#$!@ body....
---
I only know one streamer who is level 1000 with all his gameplay live streamed . Gooboberti on Facebook and YouTube
---
That’s what I’m saying... why can’t that just be done...
---
haven't had a vendor for a while now and tend to avoid public servers because of exploits like this all over PC
---
yep this multiplayer game sure is great when you play it by yourself, get it together bethesda
---
I got 3 levels yesterday on one run of line in the sand. Not really low levels either - mid eighties. All the scorched spawned in a grp in the air in front of the emitter. I used an explosive gatling gun and I could tag every one, every time. The legendary SB was a nice bonus too.
---
It doesn't have to be a grind friend 😉 if you know how to blueprint certain things
---
All mine auto completed today, gonna try this now
---
Tested, and unfortunately did not work
---
2000 steel plus other stuff from line in the sand
---
It is almost always exploits.
---
Even if you inform them they won’t do anything the ammo factory have been around for a while and I’m yet to see any sort of action taken against it
---
I don't have access to the PTS but I know how the calculations for damage work now and on the PTS I play bloodied unarmed currently with rifles as a secondary ranged option if scorched beasts just don't want to land. The damage nerf is just way too extreme in combination with increasing enemy hp/level, it seems like general gameplay will just be less fun and that goes for all builds, instead of nerfing everything, they should find interesting synergies to make more builds viable, buffing things and interesting bosses are fun, making all enemys a brick wall because you don't want builds and gear to have a significant effect is not.
---
Good!
---
There's no risk to dying in Fallout 76.  There's no long term punishment, or risk you take when you enter battle and die.  If you die, it's a short-term inconvenience, and for that reason, bloodied was never 'high risk, high reward'.
---
Only if you have Nerd Rage or an adrenaline mutation
---
Spreads out your stims, with chemist equipped 1 stim turns into 4 diluted. Also, diluted rad-x doesnt suppress mutations
---
I hate meta gaming.  I build my character based around a concept,  and don't want to be forced into having to sacrifice my concept in order to maximize dps. It's already hard enough to succeed with a RP character,  and if there's nowhere left on the map to go to resupply with low risk and low ammo cost, then im not sure how long I'll keep playing.  Revolvers are already hard enough when there's anything other than one or two low level critters. I WANT there to be a place where I can still walk around one shotting stuff that's much lower level than me.  I want nothing to do with a system where I can't progress past my enemies.
---
You could call streaming a life
---
Guns aren’t junk and there’s no bench nearby. Closet one I can think of is, I believe, actually in Fort Defiance. Unless I’m thinking about somewhere else...
---
I meant more in terms of not doing any damage without a full draw, seems I offended some people.
---
Thought this didnt work anymore
---
there are legit people over 1000. not tones. its people in the 2 and 3k range that really exploited. things like triple xp, INT bonus, lunchboxes ect all have a pretty big impact. and with one wasteland having higher levels enemies, and buy-able lunchboxes for bullion, people will level faster.
---
personally my main is closing in on 800
---
Could not agree more.
---
Ooh
---
If you don't think you'll use it, I would gladly pay caps for it.
---
yes, poorly.
---
Available for only 60000 atoms!
---
I got a two shot fatman the other day that I've been hauling around for laughs.  Kill a SM suicider and then launch a shot at some level 6 scorched at the airport.
---
Started listening as a kid when Art Bell was still host.  Ghost 2 Ghost on Halloween is something I always look forward to.
---
There were so many leechers during SBQ fights back in time, resulting in event fail, so they made minimum damage requirement, to get loot from her. Its not a perfect solution to give loot to everyone around, need some tracking stuff for event participation, thats why 99% people dont gather ore during radiation rumble, they miss loot and exp, while actually trying to complete an event
---
I don’t see how that’s going to work. The same enemy will be a different level for two different players? Yeah that’s gonna be shit show.
---
YESSSSSSSSSS!
---
I carry 15 to 20 grenades for line in the sand now.  Kill the first round in the cluster spawn by the sonic generator and then loot a grenade launcher off a meat pile.  Then I can just sit there tagging the cluster spawn and bombing the crap out of them.  Close to a level each time if not more than a level, with cranberry relish, herbivore, and strange in numbers.
---
Edit: like=pile
---
disgusting, long live the Brotherhood Ad Victoriam
---
For the weight limit they should do significantly more damage.
---
I went in to scrap, came out, the event was almost over, but not quite.
---
 Post it on the PTS forums
---
Now try and do it on the fly at Scorched Earth.
---
Wasn't sure if it was a you pointed at op or you were requesting it.
---
Yikes a faction that needs an absurd amount of corks and plastic to build a base 😂
---
yeah we collected 200000001 cork!
---
What risk? My build is not optimized at all and nothing is really a threat to me and my 300 stimpacks.
---
Stealth does not require skill at all dude. Especially with unyielding armor. You’ll have like 30 agility. You don’t need any sneak armor pieces or even sneak perk. You can just crouch and always be hidden. Then every bullet will give you like 3X bonus damage. That’s what makes most of these builds OP. Stealth needs a huge nerf.
---
Cheers
---
Man I've done this too when I was just looking at what was in the bundle and hit enter on accident.
---
I am the danger
---
...competitive?
---
She’s a 3 star legendary.
---
Drops a 1 Star Hunters wood left arm.
---
You don’t think Bethesda wouldn’t auto complete the objective?
---
I don't think that works with the ghost budget left by the Ammo Factory :/
---
A lot of XP exploits over the last year .. so I would so most exploited and of course these same players will try convince you they didn't cheat, it's funny to watch. Just search youtube, how easy some of the XP exploits were.Who knows what a legit level is anymore.
---
This and the crazy missing in vats when targeting limbs or head with 95% hit chance.
---
Worked with the gauss minigun I just did earlier today
---
It's honestly disappointing seeing how the comments here are just comments saying how they should not delete them and instead implement a way to get them ingame.
---
Is it better to save lunch boxes for double or triple xp? Or use them one at a time now. I'm trying to get my main as high as I can push it
---
Being in the event should put you in a "Team" so any of the other "teammates" hitting it should count as a tag
---
I mean how do you think we make power armour ?
---
I really want to get in one of the Pulowiski capsules before it drops just to see if I survive, sure I won't but it would be fun/funny to see.
---
Why does the cork fairie sound like a crazy mothman cultist.
---
Ad Vicorkium
---
It's a joke, there's no way to know what someone else will do when they're not talking about it and have no real history to draw from.
---
I think they'll keep it up, as long as it's useful.  I don't think they'll take full advantage of it or take it seriously enough, but I think they'll keep it going for a while.
---
But that's based on almost nothing but intuition, which is worth exactly what you paid for it...nothing.  So really, any guess is as good as any other.
---
One spawns near the cultist camp near the pool in the parking lot in toxic valley, another spawn on the road going west from the penitentiary
---
Design fault?
---
and a bit of concrete
---
I think what he’s trying to say is people who have legitimately worked they way through trading for their dream weapon(s) have a very high chance of it being a duped weapon in the pool. Therefore deleting ALL duped weapons in the economy will affect majority of innocent people who had no part in the malicious activity. But figuring out a way to remove any duped weapon knowing if it was acquired through legit means is the harder part.
---
Don't forget cloth!
---
Nope! I am 100% certain that this was divine intervention!
---
this kind of "challenge" really grinds my gears.  lazy and insulting is what it is.  
---
i appreciate the story they have attached to it.  i like the idea of the clueless npc having no idea what he might be getting himself (and us) into by openly supporting the brotherhood's return.
---
but scrap goals bethesda?  you mean to rob us of the stuff you made a paid premium perk to allow us to have more of?  you didn't even make the boxes as good as the treasure hunter ones too?
---
like, thematically it does make sense, i just find it amazing nobody during the planning stage realized how stingy the players (even the dupers) were prolly going to be with their scrap.
---
The gamewide nerf is ridiculous. All they had to do was buff the crap prefixes like mutants, berserkers, etc. I agree that bloodied needed a nerf. I would have just made so that bloodied damage can’t stack with adrenal reaction and unyielding strength boosts. Bloodied unyielding can still have their insane xp, carry weight, AP boost, and charisma boost. However, they lose damage for utility. People always think about damage and forget how much of an insane stat boost bloodied builds get. I would easily take all that for low health, in a heart beat. Plenty of damage resistant perks that I can use. With the legendary perk cards for rads and poison coming up, all avenues will be shored up for bloodied players. Nerfing junkies and furious makes no sense because they get the damage reduction, but no insane stat boost. Lowered stat boost actually in the case of junkies. Bethesda really needs to go back to the drawing board with this.
---
uhhhhh your right about wow but you infact could do just that in destiny hence the loot cave where people just shot into to get free loot you are right tho
---
of course, i forgot
---
You're not wrong, it's just annoying
---
Queen needs to lose her explosion resistance.
---
I didn't
---
It's kind of mind boggling that this is even a discussion. No decently designed online game would have ever let these exist in the first place, let alone allow them to remain.
---
People are one-hitting enemies regardless of hacked weapons.
---
Suicide supermutants don’t even move my health.
---
Aye, tbh i rarely run silos anymore, and when i do i cut oast most of it
---
The gauss minigun shoots 2mm and you can’t scrap it, and super duper doesn’t work with bullion weapons.
---
Interesting, I couldn't even kill a behemoth while in stealth with my bloodied fatman, I'll have to try vats with a mirv next time.
---
Wow are you saying that post nerf, you're still below current DPS _with the Legendary perks??_
---
It sucks that another player can completely destroy your power armor when the Scorchbeast queen cannot
---
You can't do it in Destiny because there's a max item level from world drops. To progress past a certain power level you have to do pinnacle activities.
---
it applies to the camps people can place down and hide in
---
I’d love to have all those perk points
---
Holy shite... this is the perfect example of “I’m tilted, but impressed.”
---
On one hand, f*ck this dude for having a trap base. On the other hand, that is genius using the confetti like that to simulate a floor being there.
---
I don’t know what you want me to tell you bud. I crafted 3 miniguns and got more ammo than I started with. Try it yourself and lmk then
---
That's only somewhat true，the explosive impact would kill them due to the physical force, as with most things in the direct line of fire. But their digestive structure and vital organs are not as susceptible to radiation poisoning as we are, as it is less complex. They also don't have lungs that will breathe in and hold radioactive fallout like alpha and beta particles. So they also have that advantage.
---
And as you can see I have put to much effort into replying and probably look like a tosser. Thank you for coming to me Ted Talk
---
 you can still get things like exotics which are endgame gear
---
Do Line in the Sand. You get like 2 Full fusion cores as a reward
---
It should be classified as junk but hey what do I know
---
They neutered PA so bad I haven't bothered for the last 200 levels.
---
Cooperative is more like it in Fallout
---
No I am on Xbox thanks though
---
Kinda depends about your group. If they tend to stick together, or if you have a solid frontline, sure. If they run around like fucking mooks chasing desk fans while a super mutant plays Rad Poker with your spleen, probably not so much.
---
I do second the fire/ice combo King mentioned below. Especially if you have a melee, you can flame him AND his targets at the same time, save cryolator for big targets.
---
I agree
---
There is a fall damage mod and Legendary perk for secret service legs, I think.  Not sure how much it stacks, but with the jetpack a well timed boost can save you as well
---
Thanks for the information
---
Yeah, follow through maxed out does 40% more dmg for 60 seconds on ranged attacks.
---
Overkill before the nerf, essential now.
---
Based on your name, I have to guess you’re playing a gunslinger character.  That’s a tough route to go down, at least right now.  Still, gunslinger perks, a decent legendary revolver and a nice set of legendary armor should allow you to blast through packs of lvl 75 mutants without a huge struggle.
---
I feel like you can have a conceptual RP character and still invest in damage related perks.  I don’t know your build, but perhaps you might consider making some concessions in order to not struggle against top level enemies?  
---
I manage to play perfectly fine without using any weight reduction perks at all, but that’s just me.  Because I invest heavily into damage/defense, I use very little resources and never question if I can or should join any event, launch a nuke on a whim or farm scorchbeasts for a solid hour.  It’s very freeing, at least from my perspective.
---
I understand your desires and interests, but flexibility and adaptability are good qualities to have in continually evolving multiplayer games.  If you’re too rigid, it’s more likely you’ll fall behind and burn out.
---
I’m really not telling you how to play, I’m just offering some advice to help avoid struggling and feeling left in the dust.
---
I completely agree. It would be easier to find, and it's a crafting component.
---
Must have misunderstood, thought you were implying you did the scrap method with gauss weapon.
---
Yeah...at a low power level
---
What I don't understand is why Bethesda implemented a 5 star legendary system but only allows 3 star rolls. Of course if you tease 5 stars people are going to make it happen.
---
Okay, by that argument, there is no cause to complain about damage nerfs or enemy buffs at all. There's no loss, right? Makes things like Encrypted very easy when people suicide rush the boss. Not like there is any risk to it.
---
(90% sure we've had this discussion before, too, your phrasing is near identical to the last one)
---
Made out of cork tree bark
---
Somwtimes causes servers to crash. Like the minigun thay shoots out nukes or the modus event air atrike thing
---
It’s so random that they made it a misc item
---
That is a great weapon.  I just made fire axes because they’re light, do good damage, and beat some armor with the spiked mod.
---
Why were you not out there collecting more weapons and XP? As a rule, you don’t scrap anything until the event is complete. That way, you a) maximise the stuff you get from the event, and b) you also lose far less.
---
Seems like an awfully specific card. But good to know. Thanks!
---
Have to be honest here. I had about 10 or so squares left when I learned you can buy your way through. I was sick of logging in every single day and spending all that time to complete challenges. My wife was pretty sick of it too, so I bought the rest. I did the math and if it's right, it would cost about $130 to complete the whole game from the very beginning.
---
Knowing Bethesda this is just some awesome unintended glitch.
---
That thing killed Me more than trap camps. I desperately traded to get two fall damage pieces.
---
Just having that can get you banned.
---
From my experience, its not really that common to see? Like i only notice one every other month. Id say this game is still worth jumping into!
---
personally i use the lunchboxs when i know i can farm xp for its duration. double xp or not. its all about making the most efficient use of them.
---
Praise be to Tod.
---
I like the idea, but that may be a little difficult to implement.
---
What exactly defines "participating in a meaningful way"? Surely it would change based on the event as well. In an event like "Uranium Fever" or "Lode Baring", would it only register that you meaningfully participated if you chipped in to the repair costs? That would not only incentivize players to LET the defense objectives get damaged in the first place, it would also not really even solve the problem, as players would be rushing to be the first ones to repair the objective. 
---
It also MAY work with kill counts, but even then, that's not a perfect system. Take "Line in the Sand" for instance. I have absolutely no idea how people have enough ammo and resources to bring their power armor and gatling lasers to this event, but somehow they do. If you're a lower level (not necessarily below the level that you should be doing those events, but just not hundreds of levels above that), there's a pretty decent chance that you would be completely outclassed by individuals hundreds of levels above you that bring their god-roll Gatling Laser to the event, preventing you from getting the rewards that you would otherwise get by yourself if they weren't there.
---
**TL;DR** I don't think that that's a bad idea at all, but I don't think that a system like that would be able to be reasonably implemented in a way that doesn't screw over one section of the playerbase or another.
---
I dunno why though, it’s just nice to have unique things on my display, I have a blooded 25/15 fixers so that’s already OP XD plus legacy weapons are just as OP
---
no problem!
---
Grenade launchers in Adventure mode are pretty meh still.
---
In NW though, they're great.
---
Idk, it could be lost upon death. It's pretty common around the map, but that shit happens with stable flux, it's annoying to lost it.
---
76 needs to add a virtual reality environment like from Fallout 3 where you get into a machine and it can simulate different areas/games. Skyrim is made with basically the same engine, imagine playing a Skyrim section but in 76.
---
I was new to the game during Fasnacht parade. I collected 50 mini nukes from suiciders and put them in my stash. I did not have a Fatman yet. Later I finally got a legendary Fatman. I fired it twice. The fact that I only have 5 mini nukes in my stash currently tells you all you need to know. You can’t even give them away.
---
How is it calculated?  I guess it must be different from 3/NV where a gun could fire X m.j umber of shots before breaking.
---
I'm not sure, I haven't donated anything. BUT, there is a new bos item to claim in the atom shop so I assume somethings been met.
---
Thanks everyone
---
That is correct. It worked in ESO. They explain how it works in the PTS update notes.
---
I’m die hard 527 😃 leader bobble head dupes would do it.
---
Funnily enough I see a few of these people on ps4 as well. Guy waved an exploding laser rifle like it was a magic wand
---
For Wastelanders play through both side before the finally, and side with the raiders to get all of the items that are locked behind a quest. There are many glitches that are annoying persistence is the only really way to overcome them. There's probably more that's that what is off the top of my head.
---
If you're talking about the deposits that you can put an extractor on, they never deplete.
---
I was juuust in the middle of making an unarmed bloodied melee build...
---
Guess I'll stick with my heavy energy main using broken op weapons 😅 nice job 'thesda
---
Whoa, whoa, no need for a buff, you just haven't found the right one, I own 3 two shot fat man. 2 of them are mirv rounds with 10%+ when aiming and 50 damage resistant while aiming and the other is a two shot, with +1p and 250+ resistant while reloading, I am bloodied build and my fat man mirv hits for 4,300 not to mention theres 30 tiny mini nukes. I kill everything but scorch beast and Mire lurker kings as well as sheep squatch, and the mirv is super deadly effective in pvp. However if anything lives, I use a bloody power fist and I'm built for it so anything that has survived is a one shot. Explosive builds with melee have always been my play style in all Fall out Games.
---
Does it repair to 100% or 200%?
---
That's just a legacy weapon, not a hacked weapon on PC, like the OP is talking about.
---
As a Berserker I appreciate your thoughtfulness to ask what perks are good to share, any perk that increases damage resistance at all significantly lowers damage output but then again even wearing a hazmat suit drastically lowers Berserker damage so share any card you want 🤙🏼
---
Yeah they changed it in a patch in fo76 to now only use durability every time you hit something, you now just shooting the air doesnt use durability but explosives and shotguns which hit multiple things multiple times with each pull of the trigger use a huge amount of durability. Btw explosives hit all (or most) limbs separately
---
I know.  I thought the event was over.  Regardless though, I don't understand why public events are pvp.  Everything else I'm fine with, but why events?
---
Biggest thing is gold bullion that you’ll unlock after wastelanders DLC. The best armor and PA is locked behind gold bullion currency that takes awhile to get. Then you have to craft it with legendary modules from the purveryor that’ll give you random legendary effects on the armor. So it can take a long time to get a good set. Some new weapons are locked behind gold too. But most people are still just using the fixer, handmade or heavy weapons. There’s also a “battle pass” currently going on that’s mainly just useless cosmetics though. And a huge damage nerf across the board is coming soon. Another major dupe exploit happened recently so PvP is in a worse state since everyone is running around with duped explosive legacy energy weapons.
---
A Lot of Duplication Glitches and Exploits. Also the BoS has an event at ATLAS observatory now, along with a new Season Battlepass sort of system.
---
It says when you claim the workshop that you're opening yourself up to pvp.
---
Thats literally what they're there for,  just don't use them if you want to avoid it. It's not grieving if you enable the function that alerts players to a pvp battle.
---
Edit: if people are making the same comment, should that not be an indication that they've read the information and are providing you with and answer because it's accurate?
---
You just need 2 legendary perks to negate all fall damage
---
Wait I’m sorry what is this witchcraft you speak of?
---
Having buffs with multiplicative stacking was bad design in the first place, and needs to go away. Sooner or later, it always leads to runaway, unmanageable power increases (as they alluded in the patch notes). It's not a sustainable model, period. 
---
That said, they totally had the opportunity with the One Wasteland overhaul to rebalance enemies appropriately to the new power levels. Failing to do so is also lousy design. 
---
I have no idea what drives Bethesda's sick addiction to bullet sponges, but they need to get the hell over it.  It doesn't increase difficulty; it increases tedium and completely neuters the power fantasy. Nobody wants to be a max level character with the best gear that still feels like their guns shoot Nerf darts. As many have noted, mods that increase damage (often both ways) are supremely popular in previous games for a reason.
---
I thought it was 150% more ammo.
---
people have been begging for this since the game came out
---
they flat out don’t care enough to devote the resources to fixing it, they just want to fuel purchases 
---
it’s crystal clear at this point
---
What I *was* doing with my extra gunpowder was crafting popular ammo to sell in my vendor, turns out i get far more gunpowder than lead in typical gameplay xD
---
Need to dedicate a day to just farming lead on a private server to get back up to my 10k reserve of lead now... or risk running out when i need it for my own ammo.
---
We have yet to “fail” a community event yet though, so there’s no telling whether or not the progress bar just always marks as green when a particular stage is over time-wise independent of goal completion. The Bonus SCORE Weekend reward is still listed as “Locked” however, and unless my memory betrays me the beret and banner rewards were marked as Unlocked as the stage time concluded and the goal met. So I’m not saying we didn’t make it, just that I’m a little more curious about it than just accepting the green notice by itself
---
nv-mp.com
---
Prob not gonna try it for a while myself, but has much better Fat Man than 76!
---
Op is talking about weapons that simply shouldn’t exist. Weapons with 15 legendary effects. Rings with damage reduction and AP regen.
---
Not to mention if you run grenades a couple nuka grenades help the immediate damage, not to mention if you build explosive range, the mini nuke will always detonate the grenade resulting in quick 5,700 in damage. Just gotta know how to run with it.
---
based on the super passive agressive title il respond in kind, as someone who is near always in pacifist
---
workshops have always told you that it bypasses pacifist and tells you that it is a pvp area
---
"how hard is it to understand that it was designed to have pvp in that area"
---
workshop pvp is far from the griefing we had to deal with in the past, and i wouldnt even count it as griefing considering the game tells you, and you willingly engage in the workshop
---
Maybe I'm forgetful, but what event does that?
---
I don't care if he claimed my workshop.
---
The whole point of being in past this mode, IE opting out of PVP, should mean that you can't contest a workshop. So you can only claim unowned workshops, head if someone claims your workshop they just get it.
---
That's what pacifist means.
---
What just happened is someone else opted me in to PVP by his action not mine.
---
oh I know how to stop it with a bunch of turrets pointed right there at the workshop.
---
Any game feature that promotes griefing is a bug.
---
Tried it as well and didnt work :(
---
Before you claim a workshop it’s tells you that other players can pvp you
---
You should be able to respawn at vault 76.
---
If you want it to be a more even match, get better gear and weapons. Also what kind of PA are you wearing? PA doesn't automatically equal tanky.
---
Try  Bedtime Stories on youtube. He has a lot of videos on cryptids, unsolved cases and otherworldly mysteries. 
---
If you want something less serious and deals with pretty much the same stuff check out Buzzfeed unsolved also on youtube
---
hear hear
---
am heartily disappointed that this isnt more widely used
---
They won't level faster anymore as bobble heads cannot be stacked with the God mode glitch if Bethesda fixes that glitch and having high Intel an using consumables don't multiply like they do now. Everything is getting nerfed across the board.
---
I agree, but it would be nice to have an option for "idgaf, take the damn workshop,i won't contest it, just don't fuck my CAMP because your mom doesn't love you"
---
I didn't try that. But it never let me respawn at vault 76 when I died overloaded before. At least I don't think so.
---
I'll have to try that the next time I die. I have a tendency to walk around overloaded.
---
You can do that by not capturing the workshop.
---
You obviously don't know what passive aggressive means.
---
It doesn't say it bypasses bypasses pacifist. That doesn't appear on the screen anywhere.
---
How hard is it to understand that a pacifist would simply yield the workstation instead of contesting it? I mean that's literally what pacifism means.
---
Any feature in any game that promotes griefing is a bug.
---
If pacifist disabled workshop PvP, then everyone would throw on pacifist and hog workshops for hours on end because no one could contest them.
---
I’ve noticed that too, sometimes my melee hits don’t register either. Combine that with the massive nerf to melee and it really discouraged me to want to play
---
I love all of them :3 Id say that Red Menace is my favorite
---
Pacifist Mode in this game its pure bullshit, you can't hurt anyone but they can hurt you and you even can't defend yourself if you want. Using Pacifist Mode or not, don't make ANY difference. At least without it you can try defend yourself when its not a player 300+ with a gatling gun...
---
doesnt that encourage active afk behavior? you could just park and sit and passively collect loot for 10 mins
---
No,  you've enabled a pvp portion of the game by capturing the workshop, it would have been avoided entirely if you hadn't done that. 
---
It's working as designed,  which you clearly don't like.  But it doesn't mean other people are grieving you,  or that the feature is buggy. You just don't agree with the design choice, which if fine,  we all have our own opinions.
---
Because some people work for their shit. Also damage caps at 110 in PvP, if you die you didn't shoot them fast enough. Sorry you suck
---
Yeah I like that detail a lot. And the new Quack headgear has a yellow flashlight beam when equipped.
---
Then people will hog workshops. Also like, what the fuck, you want the last PvP mechanic removed from the game???
---
To be fair, if you could beat someone to death with a stick you'd do that too.
---
Actually no because anyone could take the workshop from you if they weren't a pacifist.
---
That is a PVP player would simply be yielded the workshop if they take it from a pacifist.
---
That's what pasifist means. It means I'm not going to fight.
---
These words, they have meaning. That would let the people who want to fight for a workstation come in and take your shit then move on with it, but you could still use uncontested work stations unless someone wanted to take them from you.
---
It's not even a difficult mechanic.
---
If the argument is that bloodied deserves to have a high damage output because of it being perceived as 'high risk', then that's demonstrably false because there are no major penalties to dying in Fallout 76 whether you're running bloodied or not.  If it's supposed to be balanced out by a large risk in return for an equally large boost, that doesn't work out when said risk is almost entirely absent from the equation.
---
The simple fact of the matter is that Fallout 76 is, by design, an easy game. It's a very casual survival game, and the developers have actually been making it even easier over time.   It's really not hard to demonstrate there's a lack of risk or punishment for playing poorly, and therein lies one of the main problems with something like Bloodied that rewards you for skirting the line between life and death narrowly when dying really isn't a setback.
---
Don't take a workshop if you cant take the heat
---
My Anti-Armor Fat man, with all heavy gunner perks, and maxed Demolitionist, should do about 1500 damage. It's not an MIRV, so it's possible to do more damage.
---
But, I've shot it at multiple different enemies and players, with the damage numbers showing, and it's never actually done 1500 damage.
---
A level 11 and I were playing around in PvP a couple of weeks ago, and my fatman only did 110 damage to him.
---
I don't touch missile launchers, and my Two Shot Auto Grenade launcher is decent against trash mobs, but pretty much useless against anything that takes a little effort.
---
Guns with Explosive legendary effects seem to work better than actual explosive weapons. All grenades and mines included.
---
Lesson learned: Believe in yaself
---
They are not enemies lmao. Their first conflict was in Fallout 3.
---
We are playing on an xbox 1 s if that changes that answer at all
---
Yes, we did
---
Yeah, I'll bear it the best I can knowing this will not be left alone. If the reddit had complaints about the ammo converter then I wouldn't be too pessimistic about the nerfs.
---
I take it you didn’t enjoy Cleaning Up Appalachia
---
I heard someone talking about people camping the locks so people coming in to do just that get killed. I say good. It's a stupid challenge that has nothing to do with NW. Same with killing creatures or standing in fire. They're dumb challenges and they're ruining it for those who want to play NW. I'm not one of those people, I suck at PVP.
---
That's what OP is proposing. Basically just be physically at the even to get legendaries without actually doing anything.
---
&gt; Bethesda needs to make it to where **if you are participating in events that spawn legendary enemies, you automatically get access to the legendary item that the legendary enemy drops**
---
Ehhh....
---
Already have a bit of problem with leechers/AFKers as it is. Now they're gonna get free legendaries?
---
That's bullshit. If you don't want a PVP you either have to buy a premium membership and play in a private world, or you have to give up an entire feature set of the game, that being able to mine resources or set up satellites where you can just you know 10 minutes to take a nap.
---
in real life if a thug comes off on a pacifist it would be okay here take the base.
---
No one would be hogging anything, nothing would be broken, and everybody would get the features they want.
---
That gives me hope too, plus it’s only in the PTS server right now. So it may not even make it to the live version
---
I'm pretty sure the percentage of players who've traded for their dream weapon is pretty small compared to the total number of players. (FO76 is so easy for high-level players, I've never seen the need to trade. My guns may not be god-tier but they're close enough.) So deleting all the duped weapons wouldn't affect the majority of players. Bethesda will never delete all them, though.
---
Because they were 100% obtained via cheating.
---
No, I wouldn't.
---
then uranium fever gives 4 legendaries and scorched earth (only end game event) gives 2.
---
Yea I’ve seen a few of them, I know what legacies are. but this one had mods that weren’t possible for the weapon at any moment of the game, and was glitched into his hand so it looked like he didn’t have a gun but rather a wand.
---
Consoles will never have PC graphics, they are made to be sold at affordable prices and aren't updated for years on end. Whenever a new console comes out there will already be a pc with better hardware.
---
I guess, I mean if they where good at there job they would make all of the hacked weapons weight like 9999 or remove them ya know
---
Slap damage was fun when it existed, and it would be more fair to call that (slap damage, not the taking workshops part) griefing.
---
Fine, normal aggressive* if your gonna nitpick on a text based format
---
It has been this way since beta, it is discussed all the time how it tells you it __ENABLES PVP__
---
wanna yield the workshop? Don't stand in the pvp zone __the game warns you about.__ you surrender the workshop and you don't die!
---
It's not griefing, you keep saying that and I don't think you know what it means.  You know what is griefing? Being followed through server hops getting nuke mined a few months ago.
---
You won't survive.
---
They were a scam, that's why you found pre-war skeletons inside them. :(
---
That's the best part about that server, it brings the worst issues out to the front. This isn't something that can fly over the devs head.
---
Actually yeah, it's been this way since beta, get fucked. Workshops are PvP zones. Pacifist doesn't work there when someone's taking it. Otherwise people could take servers with no one else able to claim them. I'm sorry you suck. You want pacifist to work don't be in the workshop zones, otherwise you are saying any time is good for PvP. It's the last way we have to kill you. Used to be slap damage and camp burning. They've toned down the ways we can ruin your day
---
I also use maxed grenadier to make the AoE effect of the explosives bigger.
---
I've been sorely disappointed with explosives all togther.
---
Which is a great option but 90% of workshops are clearly only being taken for the Legendary Run, a very non PVP feature.
---
I mean TBH, i don't care,. i just do a workshop in a private server, but the flaw is pretty obvious - Give a pop-up "xXx_sn1p3Pr0_xXx is capturing *workshop*, do you wish to contend?" Say no, they get the workshop, say yes, PVP (with all the unbalanced drawbacks) ensues.
---
"Everybody would get the featured you want."
---
And by everybody you mean foodbuilds/casuals.
---
I hope I have to fight lvl 1000 mole rats!
---
No they couldn't hog workshops.
---
Anybody with WITHOUT PACIFIST would simply get the workshop.
---
That's literally the definition of the word pacifist.
---
if people want to contest the workshop, the person who claims it is not a pacifist, and the person who wants to claim it out from them is not a pacifist, then they get to fight.
---
The person who is a pacifist has the workshop, a person who is not a pacifist claims it they simply get the workshop.
---
A person who's not a pacifist claims the workshop, a pacifist comes along, he simply can't claim the workshop.
---
Nothing broken, and everybody gets what they want in terms of gameplay.
---
Is that event meant to be like that? Because it is such a weird idea for them to spawn like that.
---
"I didn't know you needed to be specifically invited (I didn't have much interest in the PTS until now, where there is something I'd actually need to take a closer look at)"
---
Rigel57: RE invite to Public Test Server; are you on PC? 
---
I did not know this until earlier today myself (so wanted to share just in case...), but you can join the Public Test Server on PC using the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher. You have to click the double arrow at the top of the game list on the left-hand side to display all games, and there should be a Fallout 76 PTS listing as a game there. \~71GB download, but that's where I saw it when I started trying to find it to download earlier today.
---
Think the ppl at the top a fucked and the low levels will catch another break.
---
say what now
---
8/15/2020 - bug still in game. Cannot get onto elevator. Have all keycards.
---
It sued to be fine since wastelanders, but patch 21 really fucked up the servers!
---
They’re not. You have to shoot first, then they have to shoot back or vice versa, with the notable exception of Monster Mash.
---
im not talking about god mode xp stacking. godmode was patched anyway.
---
you will get more xp because of the amount of level 100 enemies give more than 500xp with one wasteland. its the baseline xp that matters most.
---
Claiming workshops is hardly a feature set of the game,  or did you honestly buy the game because you were so excited about claiming workshops??
---
When you claim the workshop it tells you your opening yourself up to pvp, you know that and keep doing it despite having already outlined you want to avoid pvp.
---
Claiming workshops isn't integral to the game, the bonuses aren't so big that it impacts you in any way by not doing it.
---
I have no idea why you tried to equate it to real life, or what you actually meant by the comparison you used.
---
 But simply enough if you want to avoid pvp that badly,  just don't claim the workshops, they're specifically intended as a pvp aspect of the game.
---
If my settings say I'm a pacifist, my character should work like a pacifist.
---
Your moving goalposts. You dropped the current complaint ("I wish they would test shit first") when I pointed out that they did and people bitched, and moved on to a generic, "cash shops and bugs, now I'm not a fan" debate.
---
I had more typed here, but why bother? I can safely assume it'll have no effect anyhow. Have a good night.
---
Sounds sick as hell and would be something badass to grind for if it existed in game, maybe if it had a unique skin
---
5 of my friends had the auto complete bug today, 2 of them were online at the reset, 3 of them logged in 5 hours later!
---
Bethesda doesn't care...
---
Good let it be erased; we will see the true difference between those trading with dupers and those who actually earned them fairly. With the new craftable legendary system from bullion it will not effect any of the current endgame gear; only the broken weaponry. A vast majority of people wielding overpowered weapons went out of their way to knowingly trade with dupers to earn them; karma is a bish in the long run.
---
Well there's a problem. If you got a teammate or friend you can respawn on them.
---
I’ve been playing since beta. Level 1043. Almost 3000 hours. No exploits, but lots of cranberry relish. Once you get above level 900, the grind for xp is ridiculous.
---
Like those aren't significant fraction of the people who play?
---
And all the PVP players can PVP all they want as long as they both want it.
---
Sounds like everybody to me... I don't know why this is going over your head.
---
lol what? You have a hacked weapon, it's like possessing stolen goods but for a video game. You really trying to rationalize it?
---
Honestly, they should be no damage areas, you're all trying to help each other.
---
We are an rp group, we made it up. Thanks though
---
We are an rp group, we made it up.
---
good, delete ALL of them. Play the game legit or gtfo
---
I think it's 3, right?  Scorched earth should give more, tbh.
---
Basic kits repair to 100%, and are either bought in the Atom Shop, or given out from SEASONS.
---
Improved kits repair to 150%, and are given out sometimes as a reward from Scorched Earth or Encryptid. Possibly Colossal Problem as well, but I haven't heard about that yet.
---
I can't normally fast travel to them, I had no reason to believe that I could do it when I'm dead. But thanks for the tip.
---
It's still broken, it should let you also respawn at the nearest unownable thing just like normal.
---
But not Monster Mash - that’s designed for PvP.
---
And that's what i'm refering to, the comments as well. They are trying to find excuses for these weapons to exist.
---
even if they added Different Spawn chance that would  be great for some flavor. Bugs/ghouls instead of robots would work just as well. (I hate cave crickets just as much as assaultrons)
---
I see, thank you. I guess it’s good in a pinch!
---
lol cheaters aren't the ones paying the bills bro. I'd love to see all you dupers an cheaters permabanned.
---
Pick a measure. End game viable, or unique? Because one of those is more important than the other, depending on the person playing. This isn't WoW, and not really an MMO of the same cut. If the priority is unique, than almost no gear matters by the time you reach 100 or so. If the priority is end game, then it's and easier to access, repeatable way to get that end game gear, as opposed to wandering around hoping you come across a legendary. Y'know, like running a dungeon in WoW instead of farming for world drops.
---
Same. Went in there once for one of the challenges, immediately got my ass handed to me. Never again.
---
Thats what the bullets do though, they let you know the workshop is being contested.
---
Lol I'm not a duper or a cheater but go off I guess. Damn this sub is full of butt hurt babies who are in so much denial 😂 can't wait til y'all start to realize you own at least one duped item or have interacted with a duped item in the past 🥰
---
yeah but with a guaranteed legendary at the end it will be 4, all event rewards need a rework, they are still so pathetic after 2 years.
---
Yes because the game has been perfect since beta...
---
And I've been playing since first release. This is the first time I've dealt with this kind of griefer.
---
Some of us who have been with the fallout franchise since one kind of don't like PVP.
---
The ability to automatically cede The resource to the other guy if he's willing to fight for it is perfectly irrational as a game design point.
---
So the PVP players get their PVP, and the people who don't want a PVP don't have to.
---
They added an entire PVP mode.
---
My commando might be able to do it, but I'd rarther take a team on my first few runs!
---
Why do you not just ignore the entire thing
---
I saw a post about it earlier I think
---
Servers crashing? Or clients? Because I’ve had a bunch of random client crashes on PC... But no server crashes. Servers have been super stable for me since Wastelanders.
---
Dude that's just awful.  Folks are going to have to unlock legendary Perks just to get to where they are now.  Doesn't seem legendary to me at all.
---
Same
---
and if a message pops up saying your in pvp enabled zone, your in pvp mode
---
Ya ive been on and off on ps4, thought of starting fresh on pc, but this kinda killed that urge
---
It's really funny that you think this is going over our heads. 
---
Everybody is saying one thing,  and you're saying another.  Clearly it's the majority who is wrong.
---
It really irritates me that if you don’t tag a legendary enemy you lose out on the loot. 
---
I was doing uranium fever the other day and it was two people who were 100 levels above me, one was emoting when a legendary spawned and the other one just one hit them every time, I missed out on two because of that dude and he then followed me to the event where you have to collect ore and protect the scavengers at the same time, I’ve only done that event once so I can’t remember the name of it, anyway he followed me there and killed every legendary in one hit and I got nothing. 
---
It’s annoying.
---
As a big time builder, couldn’t agree more. It’s hard for me to remember that I can’t build “fuse boxes” or switchboards (also, really miss my logic gates) because others will turn off my vendors and lights and such just because they saw a switch.
---
I was helping 2 low level players (like somewhere between level 15 and 25) get legendary kills so they could get scrip, and uranium fever started. I thought it was the perfect opportunity for them because three 3 star legendary enemies spawn. Little did we know that the level 400 dude was gonna one shot them all and no one else got any rewards from them
---
I actually disagree with this, to an extent.
---
There is undoubtedly a high amount of duped items that have been sold/traded to other players without their knowledge. If we just removed all of these duped/cheated weapons without discrimination, then legitimate players that purchased these weapons through bartering or player vending are left without the stuff that they spent on the item, and also without the item itself. I wouldn't be surprised if these players would be left thousands of caps in the hole. 
---
I agree that something has to be done about duping, but I also believe that we should attempt to avoid collateral damage wherever possible.
---
The only people who would end up quitting would be the tryhards who went out of their way to knowingly chase after highly duped items. Everyone going after that gear knows the chances are high for specific legacy roles but they don't care because their desire for power means more to them than following Bethesda terms of service. I've knowingly scripped two legacy weapons that were handed to me because they were for sure duped and hacked. Having extremely powerful gear is not worth ignoring what is right and wrong; let them all be purged.
---
So, as I gathered from your comments, your solution would be basically PvP players taking over a claimed workshop like it was claiming an unowned one. Which still doesn't grant the desired PvP event for those who specifically seek that?
---
And before you say that the PvPer should seek out a workshop owned by some other PvPer (which would require an additional feature on the map), what if all workshops are claimed by Pacifists? With the weekly "claim x workshop" and Atlas hoarding, I often saw like half the workshops taken by a single person (public servers, mind you) so it could easily happen no PvPers hold a workshop at the given moment. So should the PvPer serverhop or take over workshops hoping there's someone else on the same server who'll try to contest his claim?
---
Man up and engage them if you stay in your workshop, be the one to serverhop and thus forfeit your claim once you're done with the challenge or just pure simple don't claim it and farm mats in other ways if you need that. It's not that hard, dude.
---
I don't understand why and when it occurs.  I've had Line in the Sand events run as normal with scortched spawning outside the gates and ones when they just all drop in front of the emitter over the last week.
---
Then they can delete them if that's the case. It's not complicated emojiboy.
---
I don't necessarily mean weight reduction. I'm thinking more about all the other stuff that helps define a character that's not strictly dps. Like if you wanted to build a ranger equivalent,  you'd probably put damage perks for one handed and bows. In addition,  you'd want stealth related perks and butchers bounty. Maybe perks related to environmental resistance or animal taming. I think that any weapon in game should be viable without having to use all 9 points in damage
---
AND then still having to sacrifice the non combat things that give a character personality beyond what weapon they use.
---
At least in most games you can get stronger than your enemies over time and still use a non meta build. That's what  I think one wasteland is going to remove.
---
&gt;One of my friends gave me a handmade that does energy and ballistic damage
---
Your friend was one of the engineers that developed plasma weaponry for the Enclave, it seems.
---
PC has been crashing pretty often since the patch. I don't think I've had so many crashes in the last 4-5 months as I've have had in the last 2 weeks.
---
Lol Jesus you're THAT worked up over a VIDEO GAME??? Yikes, couldn't be me
---
By solved you mean datamined
---
They should be giant trapdoor spiders that snatch up yao guai like bugs
---
*Emojigirl 🥰
---
What about vault tec stairs?
---
Yep, and it's a bug.
---
If you turn off PVP in your settings, the rules should let you keep it off.
---
The majority of people speaking right now...
---
Not the majority of people.
---
Survival mode got scrapped and NW is battle royale, not the PvP mode anyone truly wanted.
---
This is precisely what is wrong with datamining spoiling all this stuff. This guy just put in the effort and there are a bunch of people in this thread saying \*yawn\* dataminers already did it.  
---
This guy did it in the game. He deserves the recognition and community support, the dataminers not so much.
---
Fudge I spent all my money on snacks
---
Yeah, the whole "5 but actually 3 stars" legendary system is kind of weird, I do admit.
---
I don't think that that gives players an excuse to start creating these crazy legendary weapons through illegitimate means, though.
---
By people essentially cheating the whole game
---
Awesome post I’ve found myself enjoying those holotapes a lot
---
You weren't a clown, you did it the right way.
---
Tesla rifle the arc should hit most mobs in large groups
---
I have 500+ levels across three characters and my main (336) has max intelligence. 2700+ hours online. 
---
My guess is either Bloodied Unyielding or someone spent a ridiculous amount of time fondling a grenade back in the day. 😉
---
Why is it that it should be impossible for the people who don't want PVP to opt out without paying extra money?
---
It wouldn't require an extra feature on the map because the PVP player will either get the workshop free, or he'll get his PVP.
---
You know if someone comes in and kills you while you're sleeping, or using the crafting bench it doesn't exactly just pop you right out and make you ready to fight.
---
I know how to deal with the problem, you just build a whole bunch of turrets right in front of the workshop station.
---
What a waste of gameplay.
---
What if someone played legit and traded a bunch of their legit earned gear and caps for a weapon they didnt know is duped, is it fair that the weapon is deleted?
---
Edit: Not talking about me, I know where I got my legacies. (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
Not higher than 50. 
---
Uranium fever only had level 40 enemies before, so legendaries would only drop at 35/40.
---
They now scale up to max, so they can drop 45/50 gear. So higher level than before, but not higher than 50
---
It's a very good chance that is a duped weapon either way, considering he was going out of his way to abuse another bug knowing that it is against the rules I wouldn't put it beneath him at all. Explosive Plasma Gatling is probably the top duped weapon in the game considering how insanely overpowered it was and has remained all this time. I personally scripped one around last Christmas that someone dropped on PC; it was a hacked weapon.
---
i missed that event.  only know of it by name.
---
Cool, so where is the option for "I don't care, i concede, take the workshop for free i have zero interest in fighting you over something i captured for 250 S.C.O.R.E"
---
Like it's not even worth the ammo fighting over it, and this is from a level 400 character.
---
What if i'm now in PVP, do I kill them? They'll just use revenge to stay in PVP, do I ignore them? They'll just go fuck my CAMP, do I bend over and let them fuck me? sure, but maybe they won't bother and still go destroy my CAMP because hurdur PVP mechanics allow it.
---
If you want my workshop, take the damn thing, just don't enter me, and more importantly my CAMP into PVP so you can inflate your epeen.
---
If the workshop is claimed by a pacifist, and you get it, now it's not claimed by PVPer and if someone else wants to PVP you they can come claim it.
---
This is not that hard to understand.
---
Every NW challenge is just bait to kill PVE players for easy kills.
---
I'm also now having this issue is it only on PS4?
---
Why are you sharing that here and not on the PTS forum?
---
You can VATS in nuclear winter?
---
They aren't one-shotting bosses unless the weapon's hacked.
---
Get Fallout 1st and play Private if you don't want to deal with other humans.
---
Otherwise you just need to deal with it. It's an online game and other people want to participate in those Events too. And they might not like to participate the same way as you.
---
Exactly! I know of several groups on other sites that openly ask for and trade duped items on a regular basis. 
---
As a legit player who has only ever traded once, for a bloodied pickaxe, I refrain from trading for just this reason. Everything I have I earned or won through the purveyor. And if I had traded other things that were duped and had them taken away, I would not be upset as they were gained by wrongful means, plain and simple. 
---
I would rather have a world of legit stuff then one full of duped items.
---
Thanks, very kind heads up 👍
---
Just dont take the workshops, it's  a really simple concept and I'm astounded I need to keep saying it.
---
If you want to do them for the challenges that's what you should expect, you already know that.
---
I find the one in the mire is easier to hold, as less players like going that far out of their way!
---
If it tells you it's a pvp enabled zone, prior to capture.  It's not a bug
---
... Wait. Didn't they originally issue legendary perks based on your level, to which the community replied with "OMG, take 4 ever to rank"? Then they swapped to gold cards having more value, then down to all cards same value, all in response to the PTS reactions? I could be wrong and crazy, but I rather clearly remember that.
---
I also see the point of the anti-sneak. Sneak is powerful and broken in this game. Daily Ops without it would basically be the same shooting gallery as the rest of the game is. I'd almost rather see a slight nerf to sneak all around than a massive nerf during ops (I main a sneak sniper), but still... I can see why they would do it.
---
Finally, the perk scrapping, to which the reply is "Don't be a muffin, save important sounding perks". I know my sniper main tends to be where I go to test stuff. I won't scrap a single card on there beyond the ones I never use, for any build. My heavy weapons guy, meanwhile, is always going to be heavy weapons, so I'mma gonna scrap scrap scrap da crap. Maybe keep the shotgun and melee perks, as he has the stats for it. So, when the patch hits (and after a week or so to check for game breaking bugs, because lets be honest, there is gonna be some game breaking bugs), *carefully* start scrapping.
---
Do you not enjoy melee gameplay? You can probably scrap melee cards. Hate slow shooting revolvers? Bye, ~~Felicia~~ pistols. Got off bloody builds because they're bloody useless now? HULK SCRAP NERD RAGE! Just think before you scrap, and you'll be fine.
---
My entire intent was to claim the workshop and do the defense, which I completed, use the stash box take a nap play some music and walk away.
---
Most people don't sit around in their works shops anyway. As a PVP issue it doesn't actually grant much opportunity in the first place.
---
Haven't you noticed that almost no one PVPs? I kind of makes the majority not interested in it by definition.
---
Don’t care how it was solved. Be it de-ciphering or data mining. At the end of the day it all leads to the same conclusion.
---
70% reduction vs 5% reduction -- just a little harder lol
---
It runs like shit on every platform. Doesn't matter what your PC specs are, the game has run like garbage since launch.
---
Make the robot room worth doing rather than camera glitching through the doors. Perhaps a guaranteed 3 star annihilator spawn at least.
---
He's exaggerating a lot here.
---
So you're saying there's a silent majority they you know agrees with you? Not that we could ever ask them,  but they're how you know you're right. 
---
Gotcha.
---
And I don't want the PVP mode at all.
---
Almost nobody PVPs.
---
Almost no one sits around in their workshop, they set them up and then they go do something interesting.
---
This just isn't a PVP franchise for the most part.
---
If you opt out of PVP, the PVP enabled player should simply get the workshop.
---
If you want to PVP with someone, you claim a workshop as a PVP player, and someone else who wants to PVP someone comes and claims the workshop from you, and PVP starts.
---
You get what you want, everybody else gets what they want.
---
too fuckin bad for them then
---
Uranium fever is gonna be a mosh pit when this hits consoles.
---
Wonder how that works with 20 blueprinted ammo factories at the Red Rocket ... I am kidding. I only built 10
---
I once joined a cult that was all about being at ground zero in a church

Don't care about your gender.

I mean that's fine, you don't have to

It's a bug.

If you declare yourself a pacifist, people shouldn't be able to force you in the PVP. Period. And you shouldn't have to lose the ability to extract resources and do the other stuff. And you shouldn't have to pay a monthly subscription fee to not PVP in the game.
---
Where I tell you what, it's a failure of design and vision.
---
Are gauss weapons affected by demolitions expert?
---
It is, but I started the character after I unlocked it, unfortunately.
---
Not what they're asking.
---
They don't want to tag enemies, they essentially want to tag an Event as "No, me only. No one else allowed."
---
I saw that achievement that requires you to play 7600 hours, I was wondering what people that have been playing the longest are even at lol
---
This happens all too often on Xbox. Like come on man, the only reason anybody does Uranium fever is for the legendaries. Only to have some turd one shot it before anyone can get a chance
---
Even Obsidian hates this shit. Almost every Outer Worlds interview they were tempering peoples' expectations, and in one they explicitly mentioned they hated having their games used to attack Bethesda instead of being judged on their own merits.
---
your username checks out, when you buy a weapon, you don’t know if it’s duped. It’s not your fault that you bought a duper’s weapon if you didn’t know
---
I'm saying there's a silent majority.
---
You're claiming that the people who are online in this forum right now and care enough to comment represent the majority.
---
That's not how the world works. Most people just don't care.
---
Meanwhile in the actual game most people do not PVP, and they don't like PVP.
---
From the very beginning this franchise has not been a PVP franchise. So there's seven people involved in this conversation total not a majority of the gameplay base. I make no claim for the majority, I simply deny your claim that the majority are against me.
---
There's a difference.
---
As a FO1 member, I think it would be a bad thing if gunpowder was junk. Loosing on death is whatever but the ability to stash infinite amounts of it would be a tad overkill imo
---
The workshops are the only real place for PVPers.  The game tells you when you are claiming it that you are going to be doing PVP.  Workshops offer you reward (plans, resources from extractors), but the risk is PVP (the occasional attacks are not a risk).
---
I don't PVP, so I avoid the workshops.  If I have to take one for the challenge, I run as soon as it's claimed, I can even just log out, then log back in and go back on my merry way. 
---
They HAVE to keep it this way, if you were able to go passive and not be subjected to PVP, then you could without worry collect resources everywhere, imagine being able to take the ammo factory and no one could take it.
---
Oh okay well the only way will be find a dead server or fallout 1st
---
Mini Nukes and Missiles are now worth holding onto, just to convert into Ammo points.  Lets me get Fuel for my napalmer without having to stress about Oil!
---
Are you referring to the photo mode glitch?  It’s patched. Sorry
---
May get the Christmas one next, wish they'd make it play christmas music
---
It could be the X-01 is broken as I've been taking loads of rads in my X-01 with the Atomic Onslaught paint recently.
---
you don’t need a hacked weapon to one shot a boss.
---
Sorry that was patched as well.
---
Doesn't matter. If it's a duped weapon or hacked then it deserves removal. The whole "it's not fair to the receiver" doesn't hold up because in any real situation where you receive or purchase illegally obtained goods then they're taken. Remember, Bethesda may have fucked up big on the code, but players exploited it, not Bethesda. Cleaning it up means some people will be out of some things.
---
Well, the damage changes are definitely more “hardcore”.
---
Someone posted a spreadsheet with the conversion rates and info.  It's very interesting if you're a math-and-numbers geek.  Google it.
---
Stingy had nothing to do with the concrete.  Concrete is much harder to get.  There were fewer players.  It's not something people had tens of thousands in stock and couldn't be farmed quickly.
---
\*edit\* I agree that it was very poor planning.
---
I mean instead of having 3 legendary enemies, it should just give 3 legendary items to everyone at the end of the event.
---
Definitely a bug, certain sunglasses also light up when you turn on your light; the backpack is probably suffering the same issue. It looks cool either way but hope they eventually fix the issues someday in the future.
---
That smile disturbs me every time.
---
I got it for atanding outside the edge abd running into the middle after the bomb dropped. Got a sweet pic of it
---
\^This is the literal reason they did it the way they did. So you can run this BS excuse all day. My melee character took a \~70% reduction in damage. My anti-armor rifle character, no difference. Not a "nerf to everybody", that's just something the bloodied haters are going to say over and over
---
Yeah i said that right now people are telling you one thing and you're saying another. 
---
That thing was based around how a mechanic in the game functions, which is factual. It wasn't around the opinion of who likes or dislikes pvp. I've made the two very distinct and clear with each reply. 
---
I even went as far as to outline that I understand it's a feature that you personally don't like,  but that doesn't mean it isn't working as intended. I haven't once speculated on the opinions of others. 
---
There's no claim,  pull your head out of your ass.
---
Sure.  That's a specific case.
---
I'm not super excited about the one wasteland idea. I like having areas I can just stomp through naked with a board. It made sense in ESO. ESO is massive. Fallout 76 is much smaller. I see where they're coming from trying to make it more newbie friendly... but I don't really remember struggling too much pre 50 either. And that was only a couple months ago for me.
---
Like i said, i do them in a private server, so it's not actually an issue for me.
---
I'm just stating it's an obvious flaw, yes it's PVP, but also yes, you should be able to just auto-concede any take over - that way PVP still gets their kick and regular players can still utilize workshops.
---
Only reason I can see any contention here is "PVP" characters who are actually looking for easy prey, god forbid anyone be prepared for a PVP battle during typical PVE gameplay.
---
The PVPers can downvote my posts as much as the like, won't change my opinion on it.
---
100% with you on this OP.
---
Why would you need to pay extra money? Claiming a workshop has a set price. Serverhopping to forfeit doesn't cost anything, nor would forfeiting to a player by your method.
---
Well, it would be highly sought after because if you just want the PvP, you don't care about owning it. If anything, those wanting PvP would pay extra money for the fast travelling unless they can narrow it down to like Dolly Sods, Grafton Steel and Billings Homestead — and thus only need to make the travels between those locations.
---
And if it's a waste of gameplay, don't play that part. Dude, it's not rocket science and nobody is holding you at gunpoint, forcing you to claim them. Not all PvPers are griefers; the latter wouldn't care for you not owning a workshop, he'd just blast you to pieces sleeping in your camp if that's what he fancies and being wanted he might as well just up his chances for PvP.
---
The problem here is with you. None of the people I know enjoy PvP, hell one is even running off after receiving a friendly drop of loot yet none of them have such pansy ass issues with workshop based PvP.
---
Yeah sorry I won't say what you want to hear.
---
I have no objection to a bloody nerf, lord knows it was needed, because as it stood nothing was really a concern at most times. But now there is no reason to run it at all, just like previously there was no reason to run a Mutants weapon or (usually) Suppressors or Medic: What you gain does not offset what you lost.
---
Again, yeah, you don't lose XP or anything, but it is still an inconvenience, and depending on what was going on at the time, it can be a rather big pain in the arse. It's not risk in a "Dark Souls Get Gud Scrub" way, but nothing in this game really is. Failure is inconvenient at most, but that is the nearest any game gets to "risk", the time wasted getting back into working order. In 76, that risk is much lower than in most games, don't get me wrong, but it's a general term that suffices for the discussion.
---
See i had no idea, I've only played 76 for like a month lol
---
&gt;This affected Bloodied and Junkies the most.
---
That doesn't surprise me.   Not because I thought they needed nerfing- because I didn't think they needed it at all.  I figured it would happen because of Bethesda's weird thought process.  Basically, if it's a build that damn near everybody is running, it gets nerfed eventually.
---
This became apparent to when they nerfed the demolitions expert perk.  The nerfed it basically because it was a  perk that everyone was using.  They thought it was "over  performing" and was beginning to feel like a mandatory perk.  TRANSLATION: if it works, and it works well, nerf it!
---
seriously how big of a fucking loser do you need to be to buy gear off ebay...**FOR FUCKING FALLOUT 76 OF ALL GAMES LMAO**
---
Imagine wasting your money like that
---
You might want to get rid of your Black Knight, that thing is 100% percent gotten through hacking, it hasn't even been implemented into the game
---
Nah fam, the enclave attacked a brotherhood outpost in fallout 2
---
But the point of the PTS and the PTS forums is to fix this kind of shit before it goes live. It should never become relevant to Live players. Post it there, get it fixed there before it goes live. What’s the point of letting us know right now?
---
Those are actually grenades and not ammunition, sadly.
---
And when I opted out of PVP, I should not be forced to give up an entire feature set of the game.
---
That is, when I said pacifist mode, it should simply yield the workshop if I own it.
---
But since that would let the people who do want to PVP claim a workshop, and then contest the workshop with another PVP player, everybody would get what they want.
---
Since someone could simply take your workshop, the people who got sick of people taking their workshop might actually decide that the PVP was worth it.
---
My way you might actually get more PVP in the long run. Or at least more satisfied and dedicated players willing to PVP.
---
Right now people set up a workshop, set up their extractors, and go off and do something actually interesting while they're extractors grind or whatever.
---
99% of the time acclaimed workshop is empty and undefended. So you're not getting PVP out of it anyway.
---
If you want to grow a PVP community, you need to motivate people to the PVP.
---
You don't motivate people to PVP by letting high-level characters come in and gak low-level characters or casual gamers.
---
You need to give people a reason to contend other than I blew some guy up. As in you need to give them a reason other than griefing.
---
It's not that tricky.
---
The people who want to use them is resources recognize that anyone who was willing to fight them will be able to take the resource for free.
---
The people who want to use them for PVP would be able to claim the resource station and wait for someone to come PVP them.
---
Which is kind of the default right now, except the people who don't want to PVP have no option except to risk PVP which they don't want and don't enjoy.
---
Its the limb damage. Its glitched
---
Duped weapons =/ hacked weapons
---
It has an explosive effect baked in, which doubles the "rate of fire" for magic for some weird reason.  I got a bloodied magic gauss minigun, it's great.
---
No he isn't
---
Holding out, in hopes of the bundle it's usually in coming back for Halloween 🎃
---
TLDR. Anyone could literally take the ammo factory from you if you were pacifist mode and they were not.
---
Basically if you wanted to defend a property, or take a property from a pacifist, you simply have to not be a pacifist.
---
It's super simple logic.
---
Ticks....i forgot about the ticks...
---
About as long as it takes for this game to run out of funding and have the servers shut down.
---
Give or take.
---
No, you’re wrong. If you want to opt out of PVP, then you most certainly should be blocked out of the PVP feature.
---
You don’t need all the tadpole, just 3. Most people go for athlete, archer, swimmer, they’re generally the easiest to complete (swimmer needs another player to “help”)
---
Nah, it'll still be easy to 1 shot everything, but we'll get loads more xp. It'll actually hurt lower level players because they can't jump into high level event and tag enemies for mad xp gain
---
I have a notion to think you're the type that in a game like this  doesn't endeavor to solve a challenge like this on your own.
---
I've just very recently gotten into Fallout 76, been playing about a month or so and just clocked 100 hours. I almost pulled out instantly when I heard about the "One Wasteland" update. 
---
They did the same thing with ESO and it's terrible. You get weaker the more you level up. Level 1 characters wreck everything on the map whereas when you get high level you're just constantly struggling and trying to fight against the hidden multiplier working against you. It sucks. Or at least the way Zeni did ESO sucks. it doesn't work at all. 
---
If it ends up being the same disaster I'll probably just drop 76 and watch from a distance to see if it gets any better. Which is a shame because I've really been enjoying it minus the constant inventory management and dealing with stash space.
---
It's the best thing about them. Rolling with a 2SE .50 Cal, damned thing breaks in the middle of big battles if I don't have repair kits on hand.
---
Yeah but the PvPer basically doing no PvP for the workshop would now have to wait for someone who will want to claim it from them. Don't you understand? If there one goddamn PvPer, he could sit on that damn workshop unbothered until server refresh boots him and not had his sought PvP. Just because you don't like the mode, it doesn't mean other dislike it, too. You're not the centre of the universe, it's a multiplayer; be glad it's not PvP for the entirety of the map/game.
---
dudedude. Idk if the progress carries over, but do us all a favor and get the symptomatic. I’m really curious as to what it is
---
bethesda: adds new perk to make way more ammo  
---
also bethesda: makes every enemy a bullet sponge so you have to use more ammo
---
I'm not even a pvp player, I'm fairly new and lvl 57. I was just stating to op how the function works and this has kept going somehow.  
---
I'm not even saying the system couldn't be improved on,  the reason I originally replied is because op thinks people utilising a function of the game they'd chose to do equated to griefing.
---
It kind of does, if you listen carefully. It plays a version of Jingle Bells, for sure.
---
UPDATE - I have a massive brain and found that both items went up into the floor above. I place one on the porch and one in a cave. Both are still there
---
You're right, things will most certainly be tweaked before the patch rolls out, so let's hope the changes aren't as insane as they are right now.
---
Imagine the door closes when you open it bug if your doors auto closed!
---
I would love to see a summer season event where we have irradiated Cicadas!
---
Yep these gaming news sites have all turned to trash. I think anyone who admires the artistry of games wants all games, all devs, and all companies to succeed at making great games. We're all rooting for the best. When these trash articles come out they create more divisiveness and draw attention away from the critical response of a game into hating another. Instead of saying "this is a fallout killer" or the likes, say "this game looks exciting to play." Getting real gross the constant scat throwing that goes on in these gaming communities. Enjoy the game for it's own merits not for it's one or two shots against another brand.
---
Everyone doing this glitch deserves a ban. Why can't people just play the game?
---
Console feels like 30 FPS
---
I mean, why, at that point?  There's just no reason.
---
Thanks, wasn't going to open the game today but have been wanting this!
---
Hey folks, I just tested the out of bounds glitches near the laser grid and reactor room. Its patched. Also the photo mode/ door glitch is patched as well. I’m okay for doing the regular nuke run. If you do just collect circuits along the way for the mainframe cores. I can do a nuke run with no glitch in about 15 minutes. So it’s not a problem.
---
No
---
This is the FIRST time I felt like I had enough time to complete all the dailys. Any other time Ive played, I just focused on the challenges I knew I could complete... 
---
For the FIRST time I got them all except NW and still had time... so I went to NW.... and... Oh. My. God.... the wait time to get into a new match. Never again. My time is too valuable. I'll be playing adventure mode and chillin, and IGNORING S.C.O.R.E. and challenges.
---
Given the number of people who didn't even read my suggestion, and given the fact that a total of eight people are now in the discussion. Your claim to being in the majority doesn't hold true.
---
oh, uhh, how much will i need to buy?
---
Thank you for making this!  For a math-and-numbers geek, it's gold  :)
---
Good point I never bought the bundle.
---
Yeah I kinda figured, still would make a fun video. Lol
---
Listen buddy, I happened not be to on 76 when all this was going on, as I had work and also keep up my college courses online. I’m sure you understand how tedious that could be. On another note I also took a dive into a mass effect series replay(amazing story that never ceases to make me sad). I hadn’t had the time or energy to dive into all of this when it was available but don’t take that as me discounting the skills of this individual. Though it was the most simple cypher, it is the time it took that shows true effort. I have respect for that.
---
Just out of interest, how powerful is the Piercing Gaze? I run a stealth suit and I have a suspicion that the Gaze will completely neutralise my play style.
---
It's definitely changed the frequency that I use my Gauss Minigun.
---
I see where you're at, and while I disagree that they ALL should be removed I respect your opinion. I just think that it will drive a large portion of the playerbase away, especially the base that isnt active on social media, if they log in one day to find that dream gun they found in a vendor for 30k caps just gone.
---
An experienced player would stay away from a 30k legacy in a vendor cause we know it's too good to be true, but I dont think i can say the the same for casuals
---
I see what you’re saying.  I guess the problem is that 76 is mostly a looter/shooter with vestiges of an RPG, and enemies have steadily gotten stronger over time.  I can only see that trend continuing, for better or worse.
---
I think it’s a situation where, to some degree, you’re trying to force a square peg through a round hole.  The nature of the game is unlikely to transition towards roleplay and flavor builds, so ultimately it’s up to you to either adapt to the nature of the game, or move on to a game that’s more roleplay oriented.  It’s difficult to succeed when you set strict rules for yourself on top of the existing difficulty that the game provides.  The only thing I could suggest, while maintaining your preferences, is to find likeminded individuals that have similar interests, and share the heavy lifting together.
---
I played Dungeons and Dragons Online for several years.  Even in that game, based on the most successful RPG of all time, were meta builds, min/maxing and a culture where the only proper difficulty to do was the hardest setting, which of course required min/maxed characters armed with best-in-slot gear and skills largely devoted to damage output.  Maybe that’s just the nature of multiplayer gaming, or gaming culture in general.  I don’t know.
---
Don't take the power plants, it's too much work and you'll just get immediately griefed.  Just be on the lookout for power armor and take the cores from them, yes they aren't full, but there are a lot of them.
---
Well im tired and this is going nowhere, if there's 7 other people involved kindly direct whatever this has devolved into towards one of them. 
---
You may have to take a number.
---
I'm confused on the quest/event word usage. Quest you can solo. The storyline doesn't auto invite players. Many pre wastelanders quest lines aren't instanced but their actions have little to do with your progression.
---
Events are world map events. As others said, doing them privately is something you pay for (for better or for worse). 
---
Daily events are yours and also don't usually have people messing with you. They don't see what dailies you have or are doing.
---
If you think a couple freeloaders getting free items in a game that is basically single player (IE: what other people get literally has almost no impact on you whatsoever) is a worse outcome than huge swaths of the player base missing out on rewards they actually work for because of shit game design, then you're an idiot.
---
The legendary perks?
---
well, they don’t need to change anything just because one single in game death, a death with no penalties if you can plan for it (and you can plan for it since you initiate it), a death that means nothing set you off.
---
Yes, New legendary perks
---
Yeah my bloodied fatman is supposed to do over 3000 damage, but it definitely doesn't do that much, I'm wondering if all mutated enemies have some base explosive resistance or if it just doesn't perform correctly.
---
Homing rockets should be one of the most terrifying things to fight against, not something that makes you say "oh thank god, rhus won't be too bad".
---
Exactly this. Gone will be the days where I invite a level 30 to run burrows with me and tag level 68 ghouls for a huge xp gain. However they can venture into no man's land a bit more safely and have an impact on the progression of events.
---
&gt;If you declare yourself a pacifist, people shouldn't be able to force you in the PVP.
---
You voluntarily joined pvp by claiming the workshop and accepting the message that says it will enable pvp
---
&gt;And you shouldn't have to pay a monthly subscription fee to not PVP in the game.
---
Don't claim the workshop, and you will never be in pvp
---
&gt;It's a bug.
---
I don't think you understand what "bug" means.
---
&gt;Where I tell you what, it's a failure of design and vision.
---
It's failed less than your ability to read the warning message
---
If anything, this is the first step towards a properly balanced game, because from here, the damage curve becomes far more predictable and smaller. After that, it becomes easier to introduce new, better weapons and new, harder foes.
---
I do the same thing with my 2 shot explosive Gatling.
---
Many
---
Yup just saw this, very nice.
---
Definitely better than grognak's imo
---
how much longer is left for this? isnt it about another month?
---
If that's all you do, and then constantly look over your shoulder because you're still listed as an owner, it's on **you** to make the sacrifice and ensure you're no longer eligible for any kind of PvP. And, as you claim, there's hardly any PvP, then why are you so worried by something that has like a small chance of happening?
---
And, why there's less PvP is because those kinds of people take their chances with NW instead.
---
And anyway, the most use pacifist sees is during events where there are multiple people with .50cals and Tesla rifles (especially this one) that will otherwise damage players. Rad Rumble, Line in the Sand, Uranium Fever and SBQ are often have that weapon lineup.
---
Some people are using an exploit that involves placing a survival tent in a certain place which messes up the proper spawn.
---
When you need slight healing it’s way cheaper and you can still spam them, and they will “prevent damage” like a standard stim
---
I want the sunglasses to stay "broken" so I can keep pretending I'm a creepy anime character
---
You do. Based on your other comments on this thread i can tell you know absolutely nothing
---
And what I have suggested does that very thing.
---
So I should be blocked out of the PVP feature.
---
And I have set a way that that would happen.
---
But it would only happen if a PVPer actually came by.
---
That way I don't lose access to the good resource collection method until I have to choose between PVP and the resources.
---
that makes it, gasp, fair to everyone who paid their money for the feature in the game in the first place. that feature being workshops that you can use to collect say a bunch of acid or whatever.
---
please elaborate cuz i dont remember that and i cant find anything about that in the wiki. Beside that, my point still stands, they are not enemies a the time f76 takes place.
---
Yeah he is i play pc and havent seen shit tons of hacked weapons lol. Yall have crappy server luck probably.
---
I can see where you're coming from, but without a total removal you would have an impossible arbitration of who did this, where I got this and when, I didn't know, and the people duping would just hide behind the wave of people they misled (knowingly or unknowingly). If a legendary is taken, give Scrip enough for a single roll at the Purveyor. I just don't see a way for middle ground on the issue with morale ambiguity of people who cheat in the first place. An inexperienced player with 30k caps or more screams Gift Duping to me. Just my thoughts.
---
I literally tested it out, it works I have all my budget back.
---
Bethesda could introduce a street party event at Helvetia for the community to celebrate their good fortune.
---
Honestly, I back off and then watch where it goes. Assuming I am not dead, I can usually find it quickly. Same with most other legendary robots I kill. Last time I had trouble finding it was because the fucker died in the Sugar Grove parking lot and when he blew, so did the cars. Found the fucker on the roof, and almost down the other side of the building at that.
---
Proof?
---
God mode exploit that has since been patched.
---
It’s an exploit that involves placement of a survival tent.
---
given that i can one shot the sbq with a gun i got off of the purveyor, and armor i grinded my ass off for, no. you don’t.
---
Sorry if I sound like a noob, but I understand how bloodied would be effected by low HP but why is junkies effected by low HP?
---
Everything was dying in one shot, when people are soloing the Queen is a minute or so there is a problem.
---
If the numbers here are anything to go by, it still gets a pretty significant boost, but people seem so accustomed to dealing in the high hundreds that instead of dealing almost like 6 times the base damage, you're now dealing 3 or 4 times the base is considered "low" when in reality that's still huge compared to the people who haven't hit the legendary lottery at all and are still using normal weapons.  And that's where all the real balancing and tweaks should be based on.
---
Just post if you ever see that Mr Fuzzy ride. Thanks in advance.
---
about 30 if you get 21 more days or so and average 30K xp per day.  Also assuming you get at least one more double dailies weekend.
---
You'll need to buy around 40 levels, about 6000 atoms.
---
Grab a snickers, you aren’t you when you’re hungry.
---
Bruh you aren't even saying what weapons and armor they are, that just screams fake. I doubt you are even past lvl 15. You don't even understand how trading duped/hacked stuff works..
---
A bit late I know but you can easily farm rep with them at by going to  Marigold pavilion and server hopping. Whenever you run into 1 of the random encounters that give rep do it (I think the 1 that has you kill possums and there are others where you gotta defend settlers/raiders) but the encounters happen every 15-20 minutes per server and so server hopping allows you to easily farm this (it is a trick I learned from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7ycZJzw_TU))
---
I am more upset about Bethesda going the lazy route, balancing everything toward the bottom, instead of buffing certain legendary effects like Mutant's (just make it give 10% more damage per mutation up to 50%) , instigating (give the 100% bonus on the first hit you give, disregarding other people hitting), give us a full health  alternative for  unyielding that's actually viable etc.
---
More like give us enhanced perception so that the red markers for an enemy actually shows up without having to be right on top of them. You're not very perceptive if you have 10+ points in the stat and only see their marker once they're attacking you...
---
That's right. But the PVP are already has to go around looking for somebody who wants to PVP. So we already has to wait for someone to claim a workshop or whatever.
---
You're correct, if there's only one PVP or on the server he should have to wait for another one.
---
Because if no one wants to PVP that means the feature is not particularly wanted... So people get to vote for the features they want by putting the game in the mode they want.
---
Almost everybody despises PVP in this game.
---
That makes that loan PVP or a griefer.
---
Meanwhile if the PVP here is running around taking everybody's already built up workstations that might actually encourage someone to actually engage him.
---
Someone takes your shit, you know two things. One that they want a PVP, and two that they took your shit.
---
So someone could go fuck that guy turn on their PVP mode and go back and try to retake their workshop.
---
You're more likely to end up with PVP players if you did it my way.
---
It would actually create a stake.
---
but no one would have the opportunity to one shot an unaware person while they were in their stash box and literally unable to exit the menu in time to actually fight.
---
if you took somebody's station, and you saw him coming back, you'd know it was time for a fight and everybody would actually start on a non-camper sort of ground.
---
I am currently downloading the PTS. If I get a chance, will post here with my results. may be a while, PTS download is taking a while and I only have so much time.
---
23 days left
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html
---
If this is the true number then it's time to say goodbye to this game, I've definitely had my monies worth but shan't be respecking three characters over this, too much work.
---
It happens from time to time. People who just shoot the ghouls are not helpful when nobody is getting ore. You need ore for better prizes and after a certain level, how many darn screwdrivers do you need? 
---
Had a great time last night myself with OVN and only one other person as we both let each other get shots in and I lead the ghouls around since I was in power armor to protect the other player. 
---
Love experiences like this. 😺
---
Oh I don't think they're going to change it at all. I just think it's broken. no one likes PvP in this game, among other things because it's so easy to be unfair.
---
I provided a means by which you could encourage past fists to actually PVP but remove the cheap shot effect.
---
You don't understand it, and that's fine too.
---
Enjoy your empty map, but then you only play in NW don't you.
---
holy fucking shit, ok, well, uhh, guess imma go on the grind
---
...oooooor...they are also going for the same lock and spawned in faster...
---
Shame you didn't listen..
---
For reference, I'm mid 60's and I'll need to buy about 15 levels.  You're  ~ 30 levels behind me.
---
They attacked the San Francisco Outpost after The chosen one gives Matt the vertibird plans, but yeah we still got a century and a half before the brotherhood learns of the enclave's existence
---
What's the difference glass and ceramic? Both are just as brittle and will shatter when hit with a hammer or dropped. Bloodied builds are just tanks plain and simple one you stack  dodgy, serendipity, blocker and unyielding armor.
---
So you're saying I should lose the ability to mine resources with an extractor in all cases just because I don't want a PVP.
---
So the minority of people who want to pick off low-level characters just get all the resources... And screw the people who also paid their money...
---
It's because you can craft gun powder using cloth and acid so it's an item, not scrap
---
Does the halloween vendor have any sort of spooky music that it plays?
---
A myriad of different things. It’s embarrassing this mode lets them do that
---
Ummm... your settings make you a pacifist, you can’t damage others. Because of the whining of the likes of you, Bethesda has removed PVP from 99% of the game. Now with workshops, you’re still a pacifist but the other player isn’t. This shouldn’t be hard to understand. Tell me I’m wrong.
---
If you want to play that way you can, just don't use the tools available to everyone else who enjoys sneak the way it is. The fun doesn't have to be ruined for everyone else.
---
As a person leveling up his alt, I think I'd rather have the former.
---
Take one to many face mushes from pvp via legacy weapon im assuming?
---
Is it just me or does there seems to be a vast difference in the range of the mini nukes between FO76 and FO4.  They just don't seem to go as far.
---
I'm pretty sure you've misread the entire exchange we've had, but at this point it doesn't surprise me in the slightest.
---
They're not fucking powerful. Even an assault carbine can easily hit any pistol in DPS, even without the perk to ignore armor. For a pistol to be competitive, it has to squeeze everything out of itself completely, while the commando can issue more DPS without any problems with less effort.
---
I hope they dont nerf it to the ground, due to whiners. Game desperately needs a challenge.
---
yeah u found the main issue, your game isnt on SSD , that ll slow loading even for more than 5seconds
---
Definelty. Requiring explosives 4 and requiring a rarer component should definetly make them more viable than their current dmg to aoe ratio.
---
The reason there's not much PVP is because the PVP mechanic sucks.
---
The fact that you can be one-shotted before you can exit a menu sucks.
---
I've offered a way that you could make PVP completely voluntary, and even encourage people to PVP, without penalizing people who paid their money and don't want to.
---
You reject anything fair on the grounds that... Nothing apparently...
---
I'm not even sure I understand your point. You recognize that most people don't want to PVP. I just don't know why you think that means they shouldn't be allowed to pick up 30 acid an hour or whatever by setting up a workshop.
---
if someone wants to PVP them they come and they take the workshop. Then you could go fuck that guy and turn your PVP on and go take the workshop back... Or not....
---
But setting up a workshop in a way that makes it impossible to use that workshop with any safety has done nothing to encourage actual PVP as you yourself note.
---
And it's pretty easyto punish the would be PVP or by simply pointing six turrets at the work shop node.
---
So you are apparently for being able to be sniped to death while you're in game menus, and against rational escalation where the people who want to PVP can still do so in the people who don't can still get the full value of the game.
---
Got it.
---
There's really no reason they're still in the game. I don't think it would be too hard for them to implement some sort of check for hacked weapons. Most of which are simply guns with mods misapplied to them. Would only take a quick inv check whenever you log in/use a weapon bench/trade a weapon/whatever wouldn't cause a server crash due to people abusing the check. Each gun has a list of what mods can be applied to it, I just don't see why they can't use that to remove guns with improper mods.  
---
iirc they actually have something that goes through player inventories now and then to look for dupes even, which has worked. I just do not understand it.  
---
Also yea, I and most people, really don't care if money was spent on a hacked weapon, it's still hacked, you're still cheating.
---
Oh don’t give a BS “pacifists might want to PVP” bull.
---
I understand your point, for some reason you’re super triggered by getting killed in a PVP area doing a PVP thing and think the system should be set up so you can be safe from the nasty bullets from other players, so instead of just storing your junk at first, expecting to be killed at some point if you wanted to stay there, and moving on if you die, felt you instead posted about, which likely took longer than it would have to just farm the lost junk
---
I saw a youtuber mention by using FinalRender as an example were he and his girlfriend were playing NW on stream using the same internet with ethernet and similar pc specs in which one of them loaded way faster then the other. So, I'm wondering if its similar to that old NW glitch were you press escape fast to load in faster that was patched or RNG, or internet speeds, or PC specs.
---
Solution:
---
First thing you build is a stash box, scrap box and/or bench to scrap stuff then store.
---
so about 30 levels or so for me?
---
seems like someone hasnt money to buy legacy off an ebay. should i help you out? at least u wont spam this trash subredit with this nonsense
---
Just solo or friend team farm all the main locations. Allot of them spawn 3* enemies. Events are kinda bogus for legendary farming.
---
Yeah... im assuming whoever wrote the article musta been a recipient of the most recent banhammer wave.... butthurt duper... lol
---
I'm 30 in front of you, I'll have to buy 15.  30 + 15 = 40 to 45? Ish.  Not an exact science, btw.  Just do everything and get all the atoms you can.  Try to grind xp for the week xp as well, if you can.
---
Yes, but that's meaningless if you can't out race the target's health bar. Currently, as is, you can beat the bejeesus out of most things because they don't get the chance to hit you, but if they do, that's it, please choose your spawn point. Fair enough, I was an idiot who didn't watch out, I'm dead, lets gog et them back.
---
With the change, you can't win the race. Three shots to kill a mutie isn't so bad, except it's never just one mutie, and in that time all his mates came up and gibbed you.
---
Again, it needed a nerf, not arguing that. But the level of nerf appears to counter the entire purpose of going with the build, trading survivability for damage.
---
I should note, I do play a bloody character. No god rolls, just one star bloody rifles. I'm going to keep playing it as is and see how the final patch shakes out, and if it doesn't work out, I've got some alternatives in mind. But I do feel the nerf kills the premise and viability of the build, enough so that I'll be nothing but a strange and occasional person who is in it for the INT buff.
---
Traders are gonna be *pissed* when the market bottoms out.
---
I don't think legacy weapons have much of an impact on the game for or against other players at this point. Most of the legacy attachments were just misguided or accidents. A double, explosive energy, explosive harpoon... These things are irrelevant. I have a bunch of legacies as do a bunch of people I trade with. Majority of those I've traded with simply want them to put on a wall for display. 
---
The next update looks to bring all weapons off of the hierarchical good better best system and bring them more into "different" system. Another words if you fine tune a build for a certain weapon and sacrifice your cards for it yes it'll be OP. But someone maxing a junkie or bloody build will likely have the same power based on perk and legendary cards.
---
Their focus is rightfully making "the build" more powerful instead of the weapon. If this is the reality after the update is to be seen.
---
oh, yea, shit
---
Dual welding rolling pin wold be dope.
---
Adrenal Reaction
---
Nuclear Winter has a good solution for duplicate cards. We should be able to just cash out the duplicates for new ones
---
Yeah, I assume that would be a factor but whose going have  76 downloaded to their ssd drive they rather have real pvp game and operating system on. Also, there was a youtuber that claimed they loaded in pretty fast and didn't use an ssd. Wish there was more info about it but NW such a forgotten game feature nowadays.
---
I see a scattershot .50 cal every night I do public events for treasury notes. People used to try to hide using it or be discreet about it. Lately people couldnt give a single fuck even when I call them out on it.
---
One per hour on each silo is a pretty good reason. A lot of people use all of them right now, there may be an order introduced, but as it is, sorta need to do them all if you wanna keep good teams for the queen

2nd ed will always be my favorite DnD. 5th lost me.  I liked the map grid and clearly defined locations, but it turned into MMO style metagaming. It was all about matching the right class to the right race and min/maxing. I wish I could find the time and people to play Shadowrun or Call of Cthulu. Or even Star Wars Edge of Empire. 
---
I've already done the wastelanders and original stories(haven't run through the solo and launched a nuke though). While I main a revolver(recently got an instigating ), I've discovered that when facing a tough situation a two shot AGL makes a nice backup. 
---
I think you're right about multiplayer gaming. Honestly,  if it weren't for private worlds,  I wouldn't even be playing this. I think Ultima Online,  Star Wars Galaxies,  and Eve Online have been the only times I really liked online gaming though.
---
Barking up the wrong tree man , workshops are voluntary PVP zones. If your low level and you take one you just have a risk of an OP player coming in and killing you. That's just how it works
---
Oh man I FINALLY found the reenactor at the pool spawn. Thank you!!
---
I got that recommended to me few days ago and read the article using ad blocker since I knew it would be a clickbait article. Don't get me wrong, I love Grounded too but ... a lot of the comparisons in this article just doesn't make sense imo. The writer clearly didn't even bother to play 76. Just complain for the pure sake of complaining.
---
If one is stuck on a public server, probably.
---
With the Legendary Run it's basically a non-issue to wait for a workshop to be claimed.
---
Many people despise PvP because it's just a tacked on function in a PvE world. People don't want it's removal, there's many who actually wants Survival mode back because it would be Adventure Mode and Nuclear Winter's lovechild.
---
Your alternative responses to someone taking your workshop don't make sense. If you're a pacifist and are willing to forfeit your workshop, you should be accepting of losing it the moment you claim it. If you're such a pacifist, you won't suddenly decide enough is enough. And anyways, workshops have some scrap on hand and you don't need to build freaking McMansions to every place. You'd lose it anyway when you log out, why does it matter?
---
And if someone's willing to turn off pacifist to take back the workshop, their opted in pacifism is just consideration for others at events.
---
I know it may be a different genre kinda but pso2 just released on steam for free. Anyone who has played pso2 and sees what 76 is doing it’s sad
---
Hadn't thought of that. Gotta add that to my list.
---
true, fo76 is around 80gb, your ssd will die from it.  
---
its absolutely not worth it for that garbage NW mode, it was fun to play when we had those glitched rewards from last seasons until patch 21
---
Xb1
---
It's still a risk, but posidon is just asking to get jumped!
---
I think there was a very short lived glitch at some point that let you do the same things, it's how a lot of the "hacked" weapons started, then were propagated due to duping. But from what I can gather, pretty much all of them were injected in some way, and it's not mutually exclusive to PC. Just a lot harder
---
Regardless it’s as simple as a pre game lobby or something until everyone loads in then a countdown
---
I wouldnt mind so much if he wasnt such a dick about it.
---
*dumps xb1 in the garbage.*
---
What else was included in the bundle last time?
---
Adhesive farm.. but caps farm?.. takes too much time/weight/build budget
---

---
My map is never empty friend, nor would if be post-nerf. And no, I rarely ever set foot in NW myself.
---
I could probably put it on my ssd but knowing windows 10 updates it will probably get to the point I'd have to delete games and redownloading this would be a pain. Honestly that glitch was unfair but if they just made it a feature were even a potato can press escape to get out faster it would have been fine, fair game.
---
Yeah man I get that, people are assholes. But this is also against sub rules, if you don't delete it I'm sure it'll be removed soon
---
Lmfao
---
It just looks too dam cool on my wall tho in my camp
---
Not a bad idea its been ass since i got it, overpriced paperweight i miss my pc
---
Quad double barrels are remarkably useful. The damage is fairly good (usually offset by the reload necessity), and with a proper build it can rip into things. As others said, congrats.
---
Nope, I have unduped legacies so you can rightfully get the fuck on out of here with that BS.
---
So who would win in a fight 10 assaulttrons or 1000 cave crickets
---
I actually don't have an xbox.  PCMR all the way!

They had a mod for this in 4; it was so nice https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8457/?
---
Hey no problem! Didnt think any more people would find this.
---
Tis what it is.
---
Ive tried numerous times to make a build that is something other than a variant of Bloodied but I just keep going back to it. It gets annoying just pumping bullets into enemies over and over. Even Junkies can get tedious without stealth bonuses.
---
With Adrenal Reaction mutation you gain increased damage on any weapon (even non legendary) the lower your health is. If your weapon is Bloodied and you also have adrenal reaction you basically have 2 effects increasing your damage the lower you health is. I think they are not the same in term of damage increase (bloodied gives more damage than adrenal reaction) but they stack and pretty much every bloodied build player uses adrenal reaction as an extra damage boost.
---
i dont think *any* regular reddit user can hurl that insult..
---
Except the actual difficulty of enemies isn't really changing. Bethesda's doing their tired and true method of just sponging the hell out of everything instead of doing smart things like changing up the weapons enemies can use.
---
Just doing a weapon switch alone can drastically amp the threat of an enemy without screwing with their effective health. Just look at how the different special zones in Warframe with tileset specific enemy variants actually carry other weapons that change how they fight. Generic Elite Crewmen with Flux Rifles are just plain at first but then you meet up with Juno Elite Crewmen with splash damage Supras later that force you to change how you move around in general or how you hunker down without dragging your actual killing effectiveness.
---
Not to mention due to how 76 is, more shots to kill = more ammo expended = more grinding to replace said ammo. Especially for ammos that arent 5.56 and the like.
---
Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

I get that, but like the other guy said, you could be banned just for having it
---
Your argument would be more convincing if the “actual end game content” didn’t award useless crap the vast majority of the time.

Do people not use it?
---
SPECIAL rank 4 gives 5 useable perk points (max still 15) And there is one that at rank 0 gives +3 lock pick and Hacker and each rank auto finishes lock or hack 0-3 and an Ammo 50-180%.

 So kinda DR one for same armor chance for fusion cores to refill from energy hits on you.

---
Im selling steel all the time 1-3k after events, 0.5c per one. Using text chat on pc, sadly, it would take alot of stash space to place in your camp
---
Lol, no. What is this everyone who participates gets a trophy bullshit? It’s a wasteland, fight over it. Waaaaah, I didn’t get a legendary even though I min max  junkies or bloodied and I wont use it anyway.  It I want clause I’m here give me give me.  I swear you reddit complainers have never played mmos or rpgs before. I can’t imagine you babies I. Everquest having to log in and camp an enemy for 3 days. Or in dragon realms where the boat out to the islands takes 9 real time hours so you tryi to Rome it so you can disembark but the boat is only in dock for fifteen minutes and if you miss it it’s 18 more hours til you are back.
---
In case you haven't noticed, the majority of the player bade dont enjoy a challenge
---
Ohhhhh, now that you mention it I do remember survival tents being in strange proximity when the glitch occurs.
---
For me being bloodied is more about ammo efficiency and saving resources, I remember how many bullets I wasted in levelling up, how spongy enemies were, and it's going to get worse for players who don't have their endgame sets yet!
---
It's all fun until you have to cope with such guy on workshop PvP.
---
as opposed to fallout 76 where there:
---
A. Is no endgame content
---
and
---
B. award's nothing
---
No problem!  Glad you found one, was trying to figure out how to describe that place
---
Yeah but its just annyoing if you pick a spot and the whole server is there and you can't really runaway so all the weapons are gone and your easy kill. Probably would be better if Bethesda used the loading screen everyone gets to keep people blind until they confirmed everyone in the lobby is truly loaded and remove the blinders.
---
They should just remove it from the game, it’s just crappy that they don’t had a system that falls this stuff and it’s auto removed from the game, I don’t want to drop it because it’s unique but if it gets removed from my stash by some auto system in place like a lot of games have i woudnt mind
---
I used to be. I’ve been bloodied for a long time now.  Might be time to return.

Every Bethesda game has this weird difficulty curve where it's absolute perfection at the start of the game, then ok in the middle then late-game just becomes a tedious slog to kill basic enemies. I still get horrible flashbacks to Oblivion and those garbage scaled enemies with infinite health.

###### Jokers trick: Fallout 76 is a casino
---
Well to start off, you being pissed or sad that you got killed and had your loot stolen doesn’t mean you can post a person’s account name and basically ask us to kill him, message him, or take care of him for you.  There are PLENTY of players out there that purposely go to other people’s workshop for the fun of fighting other people. 
---
They aren’t doing anything wrong or illegal, they are playing the game they paid for, and using a feature the game provides. Sure it might seem wrong and frowned upon that a level 300+ is killing a person under level 30 or so. But it’s part of the game basically. 
---
Workshops are meant to be places where you can fight other people in order to take over the workshop. If you took over a workshop and you see other players show up, regardless of their level, don’t let your guard down. Expect a fight. 
---
Pacifist means nothing when you’re in a workshop. As for the junk stealing, you should’ve put your junk in your stash box. If your stash box is full, then you need to figure out what’s worth keeping and what you can sell or throw away. That’s the thing about dying. You lose your junk. That’s it. Not like when survival mode was a thing, and you’d lose aid items and a lot of caps as well. 
---
I don’t know what level you are, but let’s just pretend you’re level 30. If you see a person below you, same level, or really above you, IT’S VERY RARE that the person will go to your workshop simply to use the stash box or workbenches. 
---
There’s two options to the situation, you were in. Respawn, keep getting killed, keep losing caps. Get angrier and angrier. 
---
Or just go to a different server. Where maybe that workshop is empty. And maybe nobody in that server will bother you. Or maybe you join another server and the workshop is already taken, or you find even more people that will fight you. 
---
It’s part of the game. It’s sucks, it does. I used to be on the receiving end. But after a death or two, I simply went to a different server. It’s as simple and easy as that.
---
Or they could just do like literally every br and have us fall in from the sky
---
You have enough banked perk points to respec whenever you want. I also have a shit-ton of unopened perk packs for when the Legendary Perks drop. I'll be able to max out probably 4 slots on day one. Mostly for the prestige though, if I'm being honest with myself.
---
The problem with "participating in a meaningful way" is that, no matter how they define that, we'll end up with a slightly more complex version of what we have now. It would only take some random Blooded build to steamroll through everything and hog all the rewards. IIRC this was how Meat Week worked last year, and the same thing happened despite that being specifically designed around such a limit. They'd have to completely rebuild every event from the ground up to implement even a basic realization of this idea, which simply isn't feasible.
---
It'd just be better to make it so anyone participating gets rewards guaranteed, AFKers be damned.
---
As someone who doesn’t work for video games but in the people business, it’s the people similar to you that I say the least to. Why? Because you put up this toxic wall that I shouldn’t have to work harder to get around so I can then get you information. Just ask, be polite and it will come when it is ready. Business is just as much about image as product so they won’t say the same thing over and over in a “day by day” update when they don’t have anything new or informative to say. I have this same issue but guess what! I will do other missions until a fix is here!
---
it did for me, my fallout 1st character is sitting on several thousand of concrete.  but i like building camps and gotta keep my non-1st friends flush with scrap, so yeah, they didn't get a single fleck of mixing powder from me.
---
I know a lot of people will be pissy about it but no one was ever intended to be able to solo the queen easily.  
---
If this was adjusting just bloodied or junkies, yeah I'd get being angry because of the necessary trade offs to build properly.
---
But this is all damage across the board to set more static and controlled number damage variables so in the long run this is a positive for overall game balance.
---
As a main weapon? nah.
---
As a "Running around with friends and I'm not doing much damage and Ted here is getting his face eaten by that Deathclaw so let's help him out" weapon? Yeah, at least till you find a higher level replacement (which you can probably get at a fair price from a player vendor, Medics weapons are generally not super costly).
---
Laughs in Gauss Shotgun.
---
It not a surprise with that kind of fire rate on gatling
---
Generally speaking, I don't play them much. But during Fasnacht Week, I played them a lot. I my survival tent set up just outside of Helvetia and my friends and I would just hang out there talking in between events. I'd use a lot of that time to play the Pip Boy games.
---
That whole week though, we did literally nothing except the parade, so I spent a lot of time playing the games. Beat Grognak and Wastelad.
---
Nothing needs to be nerfed
---
The perk.system was already designed to focus on one build, thats why so many people cry about "one shots", their perks are such a mess they don't do any damage
---
They should really just replace the legacy explosive effect on existing energy weapons to 25% firerate, legacies are just another joke on the game's overall difficulty, and practically nobody has a legitimate one anyway.
---
Awesome thanks for that info 🎃👻
---
But...its not even supposed to be in the game in the first place...? Its only in the game because someone used hacks to get it in.
---
The TLDR is that it's a known bug ATM and should ideally be fixed with the patch on Tuesday.
---
I have a BE lever that breaks down so often I stopped using it. My BE handmade and 10mm last much longer. Could just be me.
---
That's kinda what I figured.  Respec makes sense too.  I don't want to deal with respecing though.  I'll take my BBC and run with it.
---
I haven't had a server die on me (PC, not that it matters much) in a long time.  *I'VE* crashed a few times, though nothing like OP is describing.  
---
The servers themselves seem pretty stable, if a little dodgy when they've been up too long.  The clients...I've learned not to move the camera too quickly when there's a lot going on, which helps, but the local software could certainly use a bit of bolstering against crashes.
---
I honestly don't see why explosive weapons are so weak. They should do more damage than pretty much every other weapon and the trade off is weight. Having them weak and take a lot of weight for the weapon and it's ammo makes them very undesirable.
---
Yeah it’s the built in explosive damage of any gauss weapon. Counts as a separate hit altogether. Makes it super easy to get a magic gauss minigun.

Next time you go to the scoreboard look for an orange spaceship. That’s you. 
---
Now look for the green spaceship. That’s the enemy. It’s a race. So you obviously need to beat him. Get to the end before him. 
---
Each level costs 150 átomo points to skip. So do the math, find out how many more levels you need in order to reach 100. And multiply it times 150 atom points. That’s how much you’ll need if you want to pay.
---
Do it follow your dreams and make this real
---
I enjoy running through whitesprings with xp buffs
---
Basically just doing enough damage that it counts as your kill when some else kills it so everyone gets the loot
---
Fastest way is to make a new character. Pretty sure you get a free level up at the end of the vault
---
Yup.
---
That's the source of the problem right there, turning an rpg into a shooter.  Even worse when you make it into a multiplayer shooter.
---
On the other hand, because of their stupidly low RNG rates, we grinded our asses off trying to get certain weapons and gear that we knew would allow us to play a certain way, i.e. soloing the queen. This whole thing seems like a slap in the face to all of us who spent so much time to do this. If this happened around the time of the TSE nerf, when the game had only been out for a few months it would be different. But almost 2 years later? Come on.

I think the scrapping idea is good, we need a way to clean up our cards if they won't sort them properly (Damage perks, lockpick, hacker, all sorting randomly because of their naming).  
---
But it shouldn't be the only way, it should be the bonus. I think with daily ops, and all the other activities, they should be earned like EXP. Have each event drop one perk coin, have ! events drop two, and have Daily ops drop 3. Or something along those lines
---
I see you're a dweller of taste. I primarily use a pump shotgun, but I can't resist the appeal of the Gauss shotgun.
---
As it stands now, I’ll likely only do the Daily Ops with my junkie heavy gunner.  There is 0 reason to do them as a stealth build of any kind, or really any other build besides heavy guns.
---
I get that stealth VATS commandos are strong, but in the process the anti stealth feature is destroying every other stealth build with the ridiculously hamfisted blanket effect.  It feels lazy and cheap.
---
Why not it'll give me an excuse to break out my vampire flamer
---
Perks while interesting make this the most unbalanced br out there. It’s a joke. It can be fun but it’s a joke
---
Oh. My bad. I just downloaded the game the other day for the first time.
---
Thanks
---
It won’t let me load what you linked
---
Make sure you put this on the PTS forum as well
---
I have both in my weapon wheel opposite of each other. My roommates started playing due to the pandemic so the flamer has been getting a workout, excited to have a proper event to use it in.
---
Weird, that's the first time I've ever heard of it happening while the user's CAMP was active. I can understand why it happens in that circumstance but I have no idea how it happened in yours. I wonder if there was any relation to the daily reset or if it was just coincidental.
---
Depends on the level and if everyone else is bloody. But, normally Radicool and Strange in Numbers.
---
I sure hope not.
---
I don't know how to skip past it.  I don't want to risk my junk.
---
Lol ive played every fallout game over the years, i didnt buy this one right away because of the ridiculous reviews and obscene release! The game literally didnt work for 6 months! Do you know how annoying that is to have your fav series rated a 2/5 star on release ? Ive waited almost 2 years to play this game and when i finally buy it for $49.99 plus taxes canadian i play it for literally 3 days and run into a MAIN storyline quest that doesnt work......... can you see how people like me are a little toxic towards bethesda ?
---
You used to be able to kill brahmin and use bountiful butcher to get meat. After the change so it auto-uses it, it doesn't proc on those brahmin. It also very rarely activates on ticks.
---
I stopped going to Uranium Fever and One Violent Night on PS4 for the same reason. When I want to do those events I go to a private server. I know not everyone can afford or wants to pay for FO1st so I’m more than happy to let friends that don’t have come to my server to farm if they need to.
---
Multiple reasons. I really enjoy the game. I tend to be a completer, and learning all the plans and mods tends to take time. Because of what I’ve built with my main character, I’m able to help lower level players, which is where I get the most enjoyment. Lastly, when I started playing I’d kind of set a goal of reaching level 1000. Now that I’ve hit it, I don’t grind nearly as much and just hop on when there’s new content.
---
It has it quirks, but one of the best things is no gun powder to craft the regular ammo.
---
3200 damage? It doesn't concern you that you're doing more than double the damage of a mini-nuke with a bullet?  
---
Even at 600, more than a missile.
---
You can one-shot most enemies without hacked weapons, and bosses go down in a few more shots.
---
I think it would certainly cause people to not "buy" items from others. Which may be the solution really. If people get frustrated enough over this maybe they will stop searching ill begotten ways to obtain things. The trading system probably needs to be reworked anyway. People Seem to do most of the trading Off the game and then meet ingame.
---
You did nothing wrong, it's cool. Just unfortunately probably not something that can be fixed until Tuesday so just use the time to explore or someone side missions - the best part of 76 is exploring the landscape so taking some extra time before finishing the main quest won't be a bad thing.
---
Mine didn't refresh today also! Same exact challenges as yesterday all completed.
---
Forced ammo grind is what they’re after, really shitty move.
---
I dunno.  I use a bloody fixer and lever gun on my rifleman with maxed out damage perks.  I was still popping off heads without needing a follow up shot.
---
Been there
---
PACIFIST MODE in settings. You’re welcome.
---
Yes, i said it should be nerfed, but not to the point where i kill an enemy slower than someone with an auto rifle. The point of non auto rifles is to kill a single target in 1 shot, and now i cant do that. It should def be lower, maybe to the tune of  1200 damage or so, but 600 is REALLY low for the slow fire rate and 6 mag size of the gun
---
Explosives should be 10x what they are now anyway, only the auto grenade launcher is any good
---
People can still hurt you though.
---
I assumed they were extremely hardcore players. For me, playing since Beta and I just hit 251. Got the Platinum for the game, did a lot of other things in the game for a while. Then I ended up getting bored and took a break for a few months. Which now I'm kicking myself because I missed the Brotherhood of Steel Battlecoat. I still play for a few hours daily, but more when larger updates like Wastelanders release.
---
Dailies have been hit or miss for me for a while.
---
Now people with a mess of perk cards can be competitive.  Lets be real, thats all this was ever about
---
Great use of the confetti! Had to watch it twice to see that fall, super crazy
---
no shit its the pts
---
Yes and we must get a yellow jump suit so that we can properly role play as Bruce Lee!
---
Truuu
---
&gt; If this happened around the time of the TSE nerf, when the game had only been out for a few months it would be different. But almost 2 years later? Come on.
---
I think this is probably the biggest issue at hand... 2 years in before doing any sort of damage adjustments just seems, well, lazy and inept.
---
Tactics was the last good fallout game
---
They should have made them unique in layout with different levels of difficulty. 
---
You could have one with a severe radiation leak where you fight countless ghouls/glowing ones. 
---
You could have one that's been taken over and threatens to nuke an area that you obviously don't want nuked.
---
Stuff like that. It just makes no sense that's there's literally 3 duplicate dungeons. Wasted opportunity.
---
I got a bug on the settlers side so I said fuck it and went with raiders. I was gonna anyway but I wanted the Chinese stealth suit
---
Has there been any explanation as to why we're unable to change the HUD color? Wasn't it an option in 4?
---
Both non auto? What sort of damage numbers were you getting?
---
I think the buffs should be in energy and rad damage for all explosives. Not all cause rads but they should all cause energy dmg. Molotovs only cause energy because there is no explosion.
---
The moment they add an account sync option so I can take my characters over to PC, I'll jump on it. I don't want to ditch nearly two years of time and effort.
---
Travel Agent
---
I'd like to visit please 🙂 IGN: lunarpatriots
---
I need to keep making them to get a good one, but my current shotgun is just so good it's hard to want to switch. I do like that both of them use the same perks for damage, though.
---
The grind isn't invalidated, you're still gonna be top damage, and redesigns aren't bad just because they happen after a long time if they potentially shake things up and create more playstyles.
---
And making a build based around solo'ing content aimed specifically at groups should come with the expectation that it may not last forever. Especially when the reason for its success in the first place is completely over the top damage output and usage soft godmode by sneaking (basically invincible because nothing can attack you, and if you somehow mess up enough to be spotted you can just run 3 meters that-a-way and restealth within seconds ontop of 3x dmg).
---
Damn...sorry guys. I was able to do all of mine even though they were all checked off as completed. I'm on Xbox, so I don't know if that makes a difference.
---
Cannibal or Mysterious Stranger are my favorites to share so the other people can get a surprise.
---
This is why I stick to my private server when doing workshops.
---
Yeah.  Prime receiver on the lever gun and hardened receiver on the Fixer.  I have damage numbers turned off, so I’ll have to check tomorrow.  The only time I was noticeably using more ammo was against a couple scorchbeasts.  I can’t kill a legendary one before it can do the health regen anymore.
---
As a developer it's astounding to me they don't remove hacked items.  It shouldn't be that hard to write code to detect items that literally can't exist by the rules of their system and clean them up, either periodically during play, or via a slow crawl through their database.
---
You could always just play in a four-person group with friends on a private server.
---
If you know someone w FO1st. You don't have to be the first person on the server, just the first one to run the blood sample.
---
When you change servers it should put the fuse back in your inv, but not the blood sample which is what is catchin us all. So if you try to run the sample and it says not in centrifuge. Server hop, (sneak in back door next to the big orange red eqipment to avoid the scorched army insed), go straight downstais and analyze blood sample, if it works whoop like a fiend then and only then put the fuse in and go into the chamber.
---
What platform are you on?
---
You know there is a problem. Their options are do nothing or fix it. This is a step in the direction of trying to fix it. 
---
One shotting enemies is generally rude in this game, it denies others the chance at XP and loot.
---
i always get lvl 35 items from Uranium Fever last one i went to i was so pumped i got a bloodied 50 cal faster fire faster reload.... then checked and saw it was a lvl 35 gerr
---
Weird. Im 99% sure the pipe revolver is the highest damage single shot rifle in the game, but it takes off at most maybe 60% of a max level super mutants health per sneak headshot. Ill be curious to her what numbers youre getting though, it could actually be worse now because of the damage changes, it wouldnt get the extra multiplier from having pistol and rifle perks, might let the lever overtake it
---
It makes sense to me that auto weapons would have a higher dps. You will still get solid chunk damage but yes a spray of bullets wood be more effective.
---
Yup, and if you get bored you can always switch around to a heavy gunner builds.
---
thats a big difference, but 1 on 1 the assaulttron, but if each assaulttron had to fight 100 cave crickets?!?!?! no question the crickets.
---
Absolutely. But i think the nerf was a wee bit too much. They should buff up some of the damage increasing perks like weapon related perks and/or bloody mess (that affect all builds/prefixes). Just a tiny bit. Maybe half way what the nerf was.
---
Sleep in your bed, fast travel to Westek cranberry relish leader bobble nuka cranberry kill everything ft to burrows kill everything, ft to whitesprings kill everything, server hop and check active effects to make sure it's all still on and repeat. Won't take long if you one shot everything.
---
I use a .44 or western revolver. Yes, they(and explosives)  need a massive boost.
---
I think people just like to know about these things and discuss them.
---
Great article.  Thank you sir
---
Also don’t forget the weaker weapons that haven’t received a pass through will all basically become useless. Sometimes I run a bow for shits and giggles but if this update hits, it will all be about the meta again. If you don’t have (insert legendary effect) you are using a pea shooter.
---
Is 2 shotting them really that much worse?  'Cause that's what was happening in the videos I watched.
---
For legendaries sure, for farming id have to disagree, the rude thing with farming would be to attempt to start killing enemies where someone already is farming.
---
This is a step in the right direction, but its way too drastic, thats why i made this post, and a similar one on the bethesda forums :/
---
I can’t ever hear anyones chat ever I don’t know why
---
This is why I went melee. I was sick and tired of the bullet grind. If they nerf melee into the dirt, I don't know how long I will stick around.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ia6pnj/bethesda\_please\_upgrade\_pistols/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ia6pnj/bethesda_please_upgrade_pistols/)   
---
As I said, pistols will be RIP
---
I mean if you sneak your still 1 shotting max level super mutants?
---
Strange in Numbers if no one else is sharing
---
Otherwise psychopath or Fireproof
---
I suggest looking at the incoming Legendary Perks to see what can be done to boost your damage further. My guess is these nerfs are being done so that the Legendary Perks don't send people into God Mode.
---
Imo they need to bring the top damage dealers down more and the low end weapons up so they're a little closer to each other, a bloodied auto rifle can still drop the "new" level 100-110 super mutants in less than a second, TTK is still ludicrously low for autos.
---
Some plans are not always for sale. They may not have it today or tomorrow but later in the week it could show up.
---
nono thats Fable..
---
Do I get more than 500Xp on my 1 Int character or my 65 Int character ;)
---
Oh so it could be completely random?
---
If this means that I can buy the Fireplace Door without grinding to 99, I'll be tickled to death.
---
I think you'd have to have each type of Collectron to get all the stuff. I couldn't change the Scavenger one to Chems until I got the Raider one.
---
Since the Santatron came out, I've had the option to choose "collect Xmas gifts" but it won't collect that, only candy and toys. 
---
So basically, once you own each type, you can set it to any of the other types.
---
I typically pair up my main on my Fallout 1st account with my main on the alt account, both online at the same time. The first one shares Travel Agent, the other Strange in Numbers.
---
It’s so much fun now the community adds a lot to it
---
Muties are good, within short distance of each other is the National Satellite Array (something along those lines), just south is West-Tek, south of that Huntersville, to the East is the Steakhouse &amp; then North for the burrows &amp; adjacent city I'm forgetting the name of (though its 50/50 they'll be Scorched instead of Mutants but I'll run it anyways).
---
Then hit Whitesprings &amp; vendor stuff leftover if I didn't sell any at the last place.
---
Oh stealthy and conniving cork fairy. Bestow us with your ill gotten cork so that we may bask in extra score glory.
---
Yeah, I was over level 200 and still finding a new plan from robot vendors on occasion.
---
you made a new account to say that?  lmao it's funny how sensitive you are about abusing exploits
---
To give some perspective based on what they have said about this (only commenting on the dmg nerf).  Is that changing it to this system makes it so that they can have more focused ranges of damage.  It will still be over a month.  Does that mean they won't debuff certain bosses or buff damage of certain guns? Nope, my personal take is that they want to see what that specific change will do first before tweaking enemy resistances and/or dmg values.  This is a welcome nerf because it does actually open up more possibilities w/o making bloodied the only viable build.
---
How often do you see the marquee lights one for sale?
---
They really should strip NW to the bare bones and use it as a testing ground for better combat mechanics
---
I agree they should be higher dps on bosses, but non auto rifles should really be able to 1 shot mobs, otherwise why would you ever use them over an auto rifle? Thats literally their specific use.
---
Auto should be better for large groups of lots of enemies, where you need constant damage, or tanky enemies you cant 1 shot, non auto should do maybe 2x the damage per shot at a quarter of the fire rate, so it can 1 shot enemies but does less dps overall. Thats just my thoughts on it
---
In my opinion, perhaps the damage perks and anti-armor perks (perhaps even DR perks) just need to go. I can agree with accuracy and hipfire perks, hacker and lock pick perks, item find perks and the like, but the damage perks just makes DPS between a new player and a high level player have a gigantic discrepancy.
---
Explosive weapons and throwables need a rework completely. Simple too powerful for the (lack of) amount of effort needed to use them.
---
I've gotten to the point while I am very annoyed with bush wookies wasting everyone's time at the end, I can also empathize with them since the game balance is just so awful.
---
If I play a new character, my play style COMPLETELY changes, because I know that if I do not get the drop on a decked out player, they will obliterate me in milliseconds.
---
Their options are ignore it or fix things nobody asked to be fixed. If the enemies become bullet sponges on top of limited to no new content hows that a positive? Its not an added challenge its more an annoyance ans waste of resources however if this is the 1st step to higher legendary gear lvl 50+ and 5 star than great but if its still going to be lvl 50 3 star as the highest end we dont need it.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself, Jims.
---
Runs great on my Pro, but every once in a while the whole screen just goes black and silent for like a second or two. It doesn't happen often, but whenever it does my first thought is that it crashed, then it pops back to life.
---
None of the legendary perks help a sneak non auto rifle build in terms of damage. There is one that gives 40% more damage to a target after you hit them with a sneak attack, but you should be 1 shotting so that perk should be irrelevant for anything other than bosses.
---
I couldn't really say since I don't bother looking through the stock of stuff I already know, but I don't think it's super rare to come across.
---
That level up doesn't count towards the challenge
---
Why would you have your character sleep in a PvP zone and not your CAMP? O.o
---
Oh, interesting! Where is your CAMP located on the map?
---
Personally not seeing that. Again, your revolver is doing more than a missile.
---
My new character with 65 Intelligent just got to lvl 300 in just a few weeks;)
---
I want Copperhead, Catfish, and Snapping Turtle ambushes in the Mire and Cranberry Bog. Bummed me out to learn that the Mirelurk Kings were supposedly mutated snapping turtles instead of fish. I want a giant ambush aquatic enemy with the DR of the Hermit Crabs we have aside from when its opening its mouth to bite you! Copperheads could move much like the Gulpers or Molerats do. If they could swing having them quickly swim on the surface of the water, that would be nicely exhilarating; if they get the slithering action down, I can see them being a nice challenge for riflemen. Catfish would be an ultimate excuse for a regenerative bullet sponge with high DR on the head, but keep their fire and explosive resistance low; catch being they keep near the water and extinguish flames and hit players with arcing electrical damage in the water and bleed + poison damage out of the water.
---
oof
---
I put together my own shotgunner build, using every single stealth perk there is combined with explosive damage, that's my prescription for old earl and his minions!
---
Ok! Thank you for the help! Hopefully I run across this really soon!
---
Ok, auto rifles do more than missiles, melee does 10x more than missiles, heavy weapons can do more than missiles. All youre saying is the missile launcher sucks, which it does, and that it needs a buff, which it does. The pistol isnt the outlier here, the launcher is
---
Were you in that server for a long time? Could be someone dropped it and the bag despawned
---
Inspirational or travel agent, I like to share harmless perks that won’t mess with anybody’s build
---
Don't forget to factor in the Legendary Perk system, which will allow players to re-boost some of their damage back up. I suspect this was an impetus for the nerf so that players don't play in God Mode.
---
Like I said  still a 1 shot in sneak. Two shots of a pipe rifle killing 80% of the wasteland is still wildly op. I think there real problem is your expectation that a semi auto should one shot everything. Like what even is your basis for assuming that standard
---
How, pray tell, did you get your intelligence over 35 for more than a few minutes?
---
"Almost no one pvps"
---
Where are you getting these statistics from? Like. Wtf foodie.
---
I ended up getting an Instigating fatman and with demolitions perk maxed. I do agree that sometimes it feels lackluster even thought I mob clear 80% of what gets spawned at Scorched Queen. So yea I want that satisfaction of clearing things when those mini nukes weigh so much even with Ordnance express
---
Yes I’ve been in it for a while
---
Because it’s a step in the wrong direction. The solution to difficulty isn’t to nerf the effectiveness of everything. Other builds need synergies with mutations and perks. 
---
Also on a side note a lot of the fun people have is looking for special weapons and coming up with new builds that max damage this just kinda rebalances everything just for the sake of doing it since it’s pve and pvp doesn’t matter
---
Tank you
---
That must be it thx 🙏
---
[](/flam)Share philanthropist, make your team do the eating and drinking for you, and stop carrying food. Boom inventory hack!
---
If your build is decent you probably wouldn't get one shotted so much.
---
or at the very least, give you the option to change their level at the appropriate workbench.
---
If it doesnt 1 shot, an auto rifle will kill the enemy faster than it takes to shoot the second shot. There is no reason to use a non auto rifle over an auto rifle if it doesnt 1 shot
---
Bloodied is still doing the most damage. Just going to need more ammo &amp; friends now than soloing everything like it’s fallout 4
---
Bugs, nerfs, oversights, neglect, and missed opportunities. So nothing new, really.
---
Scorched guys have dropped them for me, plus Helvetia.
---
I'm 100% certain it's loot from a super mutant's body after they despawned. I see stuff like this all the time in the bog where you fight the SBQ and especially inside the nearby grove. It's the same as how you can sometimes find the items for Ward's daily laying around on the ground.
---
Because what we truly needed was more of an ammo grind. /s
---
This is actually ironic, because one of the loading screens for NW actually says something like "To have balance and fairness in Nuclear Winter we have stripped everyone of blablaba..." 
---
Yea no. There is nothing fair about some of the perk combinations higher level players have that a newer player will have to grind several weeks to months to attain.
---
I don't even feel the rush from dropping 20 bombs because I know it's mostly due to overpowered perk card combos.
---
So yes, I agree to an ACTUAL bare bones approach.
---
Have you seen the rewards for season 2 yet?
---
Rad rumble fails if you dont get the first reward, 25 ore i believe
---
I made one of those in F04 and it was insane.
---
Or to need hacked weapons in the first place
---
Actually you’re probably right because my camp got ambushed by super mutants 3 times in that one session
---
I paid $12 and stored thousands of pounds in components before the month was up. 
---
If you refuse to use 1st though, you shouldn't be keeping more then 50, maybe a hundred of each junk item if they're the rare/insanely common in recipes ones.
---
Take all the mods off your weapons to reduce weight, and add the ultra-light mod to any armor if you are keeping them just for sentimental reasons.  Before I got FO1, I kept about 600 steel, 400 lead, and around 100 of each other junk item...  I never kept any chems in my stash.
---
Why don't you just stop using duped items? Then you wouldn't have to worry about losing them. It's pretty safe to assume anyone making your argument has a dodgy inventory at this point.
---
If i was using an auto build i would agree with you completely, but non auto rifles got nerfed so bad by this. I went from 3200 damage per shot to 600 (&gt;80% decrease), and now i might as well just use an auto rifle, because if im not able to 1 shot an enemy any more (im not, for max lv super mutants), an auto rifle will kill it faster than the slow time between shots of a non auto rifle.
---
Half of the pistols in the game are just a useless piece of metal. This applies to all pistols, except ... Hell, it's easier to say which pistols can be at least some kind of competition. These are 45 revolver, 10mm pistol and plasma. Everything else is junk.
---
With the introduction of the changes, pistols will be simply unplayable.
---
Another area where this seems to happen a lot is the mole miners outside of Blackwater Mine. You can often find stacks of their claw weapons with bowls of spoiled meat on top of them. :P
---
The dailies feel like a chore
---
If season two has them, ill probably end up playing less tbh
---
Make sure you are scrapping your junk.  I used to keep about 100 of each with a more of the stuff I use often (Weapon and armor repair) or the rare stuff like ballistic fiber.
---
RIP my "food build"
---
So if they delete all the dupes no one will have to worry about "accidentally" owning one, right?
---
I live by the whitespring so I highly doubt that’s what happened but thx for the info anyway
---
Cheating = cheating
---
I get the feeling that would cost Atoms
---
The frog legs gets me as mobility is a bitch already in a br with no climbing ledges or sliding or really any modern movement controls. AP exists for some reason so you can’t just sprint endlessly. It’s like it wants to be realistic but then not at all
---
Found the console gamer
---
Have you tried looking at the terminal you can set up in your camp? I know 2 scout dailies can be started from there as well as a biv daily
---
I did 100 levels during double xp no glitches just a brutal murder of white springs and server hopping
---
I'd put money on most legacy and most "god" rolls being so overly duped. most of the people dont know it, it would cause too many players losing what they thought was normal stuff that the support tickets, complaints and people leaving the game would be more than half
---
You mean the ones in the military wing right? The ones in the main area never had them
---
Let them dream
---
Have you thought of using Gun Fu and/or Adrenaline to boost killing streaks? Perhaps steal a point away from each Gunslinger card? That last 15% could be converted to as much as 48% if you keep chaining your kills, which you seem to do in the video you posted.
---
With a Bloodied build, your Unyielding armor is adding 15 Agility, which greatly increases your Sneak ability, so you might be able to do with just 1 or 2 points in the Sneak perk, freeing up more points for Adrenaline or perhaps 1 or 2 points in Gun Fu.
---
It's possible that the devs don't want anyone one-shotting enemies like that, maybe without resorting to very exotic means to do so, but we'll see if they rework the math before release.
---
You only need about a hundred of the important stuff... Like screws, springs, ballistic fiber... Basically anything you always seem to be short on. Don't keep any bone, ceramic, glass or concrete unless you're doing a big camp build. If you need some of it to make adjustments to your camp so go and farm it as needed, it's all super easy to get in the quantities you need. Only keep 25-50 of things you only occasionally use like leather or asbestos... Also don't keep steel or lead in your stash, or only a small amount. Just have a decent supply of acid, and when it comes time to make ammo go on a lead/steel run and make it all on the spot.
---
Br the exclamation mark was not needed lol
---
Or just put a chest at the end of the event that only opens when the event is open, and everyone can loot it so long as you participated.
---
If you can find graham, he usually has them. But he’s a random spawn. I’ve been finding around foundation when I fast travel there for my daily grind.
---
The improved ones buff the repair without swapping cards.
---
Just see what type you need for repairs to your gear and camp. Steel, adhesive,  ballistic fiber, screes, springs, etc.
---
The rest you can keep 25 to 50 of.
---
yes, they no longer are there...
---
NGL “orbital strike minigun” sounds like a sweet band name
---
&gt; I see, corks and plastic
---
Selling cork, plastic, and steel, in bulk.  You mean
---
I loved escorting for the xp buff myself. I've had people help me with my alts. But I think it's done. Plus lower levels will likely have issues with the legendary board game now.
---
This is one thing I’d be grateful for... Give us no daily scrip limit, but allow us to only buy (5?) amount of things from Murmur, excluding vault steel and legendary mods.
---
No, for example, if you legitimately traded your rarest legacy or godroll, for another weapon that just so happened to be duped and if later on all duped weapons would just be deleted, the duper actually just made out with your legitimate legacy or godroll, he pretty much gave you the soon-to-be-deleted duped weapon and took your clean, non duped weapon and can keep it. Makes sense now?
---
pfffft. Save up a shit ton of caps and just buy the Big Boy. Pipe pistol to wake him up then light im up
---
They're not going to make any adjustments to the current system. It's one of their strategies for sleazing people into paying for a subscription so they can have a private server and not have to worry about xXx\_dankweedbloodiedsniper420\_xXx showing up and one-shotting everything.
---
Along the same lines, I like Mysterious Savior
---
Seriously. Like the Assaultron Blade, it has one mod. Fucking one. We should be able to pound nails, drench it in poison, light it on fire, and all sorts of shit that we could practically do. For god sakes Baseball bat isn't that good of a weapon, but it has A GAZILLION mods, som eof which just combine ALL mods into one.
---
Thank you! Didn't know that about diluted X.
---
&gt; stash infinite amounts of it would be a tad overkill imo
---
How is it any more overkill then the 90k steel in my stashbox?
---
To me - it would be more about quality of life.  One less item to micromanage.
---
I have a bunch of extra plans that I could give you. I'm also on Xbox. They've just been sitting in my vendor so I'd like to get rid of them
---
Yeah, could be the contents of a despawned enemy.
---
Sometimes, I find a ton of despawned enemy loot. I've found Legendaries, armor, ammo, meat chunks. One server had 65+ pieces of Radscorpion meat because they'd spawn and despawn repeatedly in the same areas near the ski resorts.
---
I've also seen it in the SBQ Fissure nuke site where there's parts of SBQs and SBs everywhere.
---
Firstly your completely overlooking the fact that auto weapons will also be tuned down. Secondly as I said it makes sense that they have a higher dps. Thirdly they are already more effective then semi the only difference is now everyone won't be shooting top tier  mobs. Finally one of the main reasons I prefer chunk damage over beaming is the ammo efficiency. Sure I could melt the waste out of the land with my magic flamer but it doesn't spread as far as say my guass and hence I only really bust out for boss battles and ganks Iike you want
---
Adrenaline could be an option definately, though having to build up damage isnt something i personally really like, might have to though. As for gun fu, could also be an option but the time it lingers on the dead enemy is annoying for me, compared to VATSing, then right clicking and vatsing again. Not bad ideas though, might have to try.
---
Funnily, my lobber tesla seems to 1 shot the max lv super mutants, even if im not sneaking or headshotting so i have no idea whats up with damage honestly. I just hope they dont keep these changes, i enjoy the build a lot, and its not even strong for bossing so i dont see the issue with it.
---
I can't believe how many north american teens think just because they are lazy cheating tards that therefore the entire playerbase must be too.
---
Now that I have looked at them I’ll let this post stand for season 3...
---
I've actually still had the experience of progression in ESO, even with the changes made in One Tamriel. 
---
Sure, it's not entirely a traditional system, but I think it still works. When you're a lower level, you don't have all of the skills and passives that really make the difference with the more powerful fights. You get those as you level up, and they make confrontations a heck of a lot easier. I shred common enemies a lot faster now with a high-level character than I ever could have dreamed of back when I first started the game.
---
I actually started the game after One Tamriel was released, so obviously I would have a different outlook on things than someone who started before. However, with my perspective in mind, in my opinion you still get significantly stronger as you increase in level.
---
76 seems to be doing it slightly differently, though, so I too am interested to see how this works out.
---
Right now I can still enjoy the game,  but I'm probably done once one wasteland removes low lvl areas and the ability to get stronger than your enemies.
---
I try but it seems Ghouls and Anglers hone in on me like my dogs on dropped food.
---
That's simply pathetic.
---
There's no good damage boost in legendary perks. And with new damage system most of the weapons will be too weak to compete with commando and heavygun meta.
---
Bethesda makes meta builds more meta. Now we can use weak weapon and still be good with fight. With new system we will be obliged to use the best equipment so as not to carry tons of ammunition on ourselves and not to bombard the enemy with lead.
---
Ah, good to know. I went ahead with the X-01 due to higher radiation resistance and thought Emergency protocols looked smarter, so put that on last night.
---
I almost always have to talk to the Scout Handy to start the quest. It won't show for me otherwise. I basically gather the stuff I need out of my stash and go turn in the quest.
---
Its really the only challenging part of the challenges the ones that fall in NW. Its fun. Also making me deploy the camp in NW has added to my NW game that I would have never done before.  
---
Also: Every time I have gotten a delay in the points it does showing up with in the next 15-20 min's.
---
Yeah I agree. I thought my BE .50 was really OP till I saw a hacked .50 that did over 2k damage per shot.
---
From what ive heard, and tested myself, theyre a lot less toned down, since the higher the damage of the weapon, the greater the nerf. Its about half damage for them compared to a fifth damage for the pipe revolver.
---
I agreed with the higher dps thing?
---
It is more ammo efficient though, i hadnt thought about that being a factor. I guess thats a use for them, but it doesnt really seem like a reason to use them imo.
---
Just do a commando or heavygun build. Pistols will be unplayable
---
One thing I noticed with Super Mutants in particular is that the way they face makes a big difference when trying for a head shot. If they are facing me directly, I get full damage. If they are angled away, especially facing away, their head armor can sometimes make it so I don't even hit.
---
I haven't tried Gun Fu with a non-automatic build. I tend to move to an automatic as soon as I hit level 15 with a Handmade. You do have to get used to the "linger." I've come to expect it and it's weird to me when my gun does not "seek" the next living enemy.
---
FYI I’ve never received full cores from Line in the Sand, but they were nonetheless around 90-95%, so close enough.
---
Nope, i tried taking of a rank 3 of either perk and both times i lost 8 damage
---
Which part of the emotionless clear explanation of their opinion on the matter was "worked up"? Are you one of those distinctly unintelligent people that thinks anyone disagreeing with you has an attitude?
---
How much is it from him? I see people offering it for 2500
---
I’m working on my sniper build, lvl 61 now. When you hit lvl 25 I recommend getting a lever action rifle (even as a backup), it’ll help a lot when you get rushed by ghouls etc and a hunting rifle is too slow. 
---
Allegedly you can buy the plan at Grafton train station but I checked there for days and never found it. Got it first go at Lewisburg station down south in the ash heap though. Needs a lot of screws but the faster firing is a life saver.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lever_action_rifle_(Fallout_76)
---
I finally replaced my lever with a Fixer yesterday, but since you probably won’t get a Fixer for a while unless someone gives one to you, a lever will serve you well for a long time!
---
The main issue is that it can sometimes be difficult to tell whether or not an item is duped or not, especially if it's sold for a high price anyway / you're relatively new to this game and don't really know what to look for. It's not right for you to lose stuff that you rightfully earned (even if you indirectly earned it by trading caps / other legitimate items for it).
---
And trust me, my inventory isn't exactly awe-inspiring (although I agree that your suspicion is justified). One of the weapons that I carry around is legitimately just a bolt-action pipe pistol that I looted off of a scorched.
---
*The giant enemy spider.*
---
I've looted that room countless times and never even came close to finding that key. Thanks for sharing.
---
How the fuck would a casual player have 30000 caps?
---
I was used to gun fu for ages, but when it was broken i got... not used to it i guess, used to cancelling vats as soon as i shoot instead
---
Most of the players on reddit are duping pieces of shit it turns out.
---
This seems to be the majority opinion. Its a great opinion but co e on guys the more we complain about it the longer it will take to gwt it out to the public! Let's just let them get it out and then we can change it.
---
Its a selfish decision on my behalf because I have a ton of cards to scrap and want these damn perks already!
---
I subscribed to Fallout 1st as soon as I possibly could so I never had to play inventory management hell again. I don't ever want to go back.
---
Nah, they should rework the effect like they said they would. They should make the explosive energy weapons work like gauss weapons.
---
Nah
---
I don’t remember for sure but I think 300 caps. The reason players are putting it up for 2500 is because of its rarity. It’s not all that rare but it is uncommon and finding graham isn’t something you plan on doing. He just sorta shows up when you least expect it. Otherwise wait until meat week starts. You’ll be able to catch him in the same spot every hour on the hour.
---
Glad to help
---
Have u seen the legendary perks yet?
---
Sentry bot, lvl 75, with 27 Int, no other buffs: 624 XP
---
Same bot, 21 Int: 616xp
---
Same bot, 15 Int: 548
---
A light touch is definitely needed. Making large changes to the meta nearly 2 years into the games life is tough on people. I get it, I have some great stuff and don't want it nerfed.
---
I just don't want Bethesda's response to be lowering player damage and making everything bullet sponges. Then it will make it more of a grind for ammo scrap and junk to repair our equipment. It shouldn't make the new legendary ammo perk be mandatory. 
---
I will be interested to see how it plays out. I'm afraid it will make a lot of the non meta stuff even worse.
---
Time will tell.
---
Do you think it's worth it to spend 2500 caps or no?
---
When it updated to plastic it changed the cork arrow thing to green like the past challenges, so I'm assuming we completed it successfully
---
I had to learn that you receive kits from SBQ fights before I unlocked learning to use them from my inventory. And then I unlocked that you could use them on weapons in your Favorites wheel... 👨‍🎓
---
My wife and I just talked about this actually and ita such a good idea
---
I didn't know diluted rad X doesn't suppress mutations after 170 levels. I just spammed rad away in nuke zones.
---
Im serious. How do i fix it
---
I’ve got it on 3 characters and still never use it. The lights are really bright. Most I’d pay for it again at this point from another player would be between 500 and 1000.
---
It's easy to re-adapt... probably within an hour of play.
---
The nice thing about moving even just three points to Adrenaline is that you only need to kill two enemies within 30 seconds of each other before your third starts to take more damage than you were doing before. Then it's even more after that. The 30 second grace period feels quite fair for a place like West Tek, where you know your route.
---
 [https://i.imgflip.com/37msiy.jpg](https://i.imgflip.com/37msiy.jpg)
---
Seems low? No?
---
Personally I like the damage change in theory, might change if it hits too hard across the board, because it’s an equalizer. Bloodied builds are primarily popular because it drastically out damages every other build, if that damage gap gets reduced I’ll be happy but I’ll be even happier if other builds get the kind of synergy Bloodied does
---
15 Special Int(+15), Full Unyielding with +I(+35)and build team(+39) Shielded casual under armor (+42) and night person +3 a lot of consumables like SB brain(30min and Berry Mentats(10min) ++;)
---
They only existence for hacked weapons should be when mods are finally added to the game and strictly limited to Private Servers.  Any current hacked equipment should be removed ASAP.
---
As far as duped equipment goes, implement a legendary crafting system where we can add specific legendary bonuses into the equipment.  It costs a certain amount of scrip to add stars  and more scrip and rare resources to add specific legendary bonuses.  That way duped equipment loses their value since anyone can craft their own TSE Minigun.
---
Auto launcher is pretty much homing pigeon or death. All they need is durability fix.
---
Those weapons are artwork and should be preserved. Wish there was a museum to showcase them all to the people
---
The room with the missile launcher, or the one with the minigun?
---
Thing is im not sure the increase is worth it. Since its addative now, and i already have (1+.95+.2+.2+.2+.2+.2+.2+.66+.15+.2) for 4.16x damage, itd only add maybe 10% more at max adrenaline. Not enough of an increase to allow 1 shots so it wouldnt really matter here, sadly.
---
Just dont hit cap which is 5k
---
Just do both. I've been a heavy bloodied power armor user since forever, super versatile.
---
The "Get it out now, fix it later" mentality is how we got Patch 21, half of the new stuff was broken or missing. We need more patience, they completely messed up the original perk card system, we need to make sure they have it set right when it actually comes around.  
---
Also if they release it as is, a lot of people will be real pissed that they scrapped half their saved cards because there was no other option. It needs to be a balanced grind on launch. Bethesda also has a knack for not fixing grinds post launch either, just look at legendaries and SS armor right now. I'm still trying to get a good set of Secret Service armor and i've been rolling three pieces almost every single day since I unlocked them. I don't want to be scrapping cards every time I level up just to be one step out of 250 closer to the next card rank
---
That’s a low cap considering the Chinese stealth armor set cost 5k in total
---
The point of single-shot weapons is accuracy, not "to kill a single target in 1 shot". That is what you're made them do so far; but they can also be used for crippling enemies, tagging legendary at a distance without 1-shotting them, marking enemies for your team with poison or fire effects (with bows), and for the rp or gameplay (it's more serious if I miss a shot at a charging ghoul with a crossbow than it is with a fixer, makes it feel more like an apocalypse than a theme park). I am sorry to hear that the "kill everything" button you've gotten used to is going to be less effective, and I do see that many members of this community are upset about the upcoming changes
---
I get what you mean but you keep bringing up the definition on pacifist. By definition, pacifists don't fight back, doesn't mean they're not involved in fights.  History tells us that a great many pacifists got their asses kicked or killed.  
---
So theoretically, if you wanted TRUE pacifism programmed in the game, it would mean a player could kill you at any time (even outside a workshop) and you would never be able to hit them back.
---
Having said that, i do agree that they should rework workshops.  Were it up to me, i'd just add actual arenas where some of the workshops are and change others to public events that are unique because you can build turrets and structures.  I guess you could make it so that extractors are put down automatically after a defense and instance their loot to each player.  Just some stupid brainstormed ideas, don't have to take them seriously.
---
Have you checked if your camp spawn is too close to your vendor machines? They seem not to load properly and cause a bug like this sometimes. Usually ppl say someone has been wandering around their camps for too long, maybe because they notice of this. Then they try to get to your machine real quick and cause the bug. If not it's gotta be a set of specific stuff to make it happen, not random at all.
---
You're wrong.
---
It wasn't that I couldn't fight back, I'm not even sure if I can.
---
It's at the workshop mechanism let a guy who was like level 300 kill me before I could even get out of a menu.
---
If you're a pacifist, the guy should just get the workshop without me entering PVP with him.
---
Then I could back off and decide whether or not it was a fight I thought I could take. if I wanted to then fight him for it I could go get my shit back by turning off pacifist and going and getting my shit back.
---
The way it is now you can basically be sniped or griefed.
---
The way I'm suggesting would let both people decide that they wanted to PVP.
---
This would actually encourage PVP because someone just took your shit, and you might be willing to try to take it back.
---
It literally levels the playing field.
---
It doesn't defeat the possibility of PVP entirely.
---
But it doesn't let someone grief you while you're in your inventory or whatever.
---
So yeah, you didn't listen and you're wrong.
---
I would go to nukesanddragons and plan out where to put your  50special points. Also you might want to say what type of build you are looking for.
---
Have you bought anything yet?? I bought a bunch of stuff and now I'm saving up for the reason you said.
---
The SS set is awesome and I like the Armco ammo machine you can buy at max ally status with Crater.
---
Wow going from 1-54 without spending a single level up must have been hard. 
---
What kind of weapons do you like using?
---
Thanks!
---
Many won't want a PVP.
---
You're suggesting that the entire game system penalized them and deny them part of the functionality. Which is what it currently does.
---
I'm suggesting that both people would sort of have a warning.
---
I don't think it would encourage very much PvP, but it wouldn't be as discouragingly useless as it is now.
---
But it also means that low-level characters can still use the workshops without having to worry about a 5X more powerful person coming in and taking their shit just cuz he can.
---
Yeah I already bought everything I needed but I’m interested in buying the vault 94 plans
---
I had moved a bunch of points to INT for the greater experience buff, nerfing my Bloodied damage in the process.
---
I am doing about half the damage I was before in my current prime daytime DPS build (copied and pasted from perkloadoutmanager.ini): [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3944fab&amp;d=sg2pg1ph1pi1pp2es2eh0c62cr0i12ic4ir2ig2ii0a00ao0a30ah0ar2s72lu2lb2la2l71&amp;w=&amp;n=day&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3944fab&amp;d=sg2pg1ph1pi1pp2es2eh0c62cr0i12ic4ir2ig2ii0a00ao0a30ah0ar2s72lu2lb2la2l71&amp;w=&amp;n=day&amp;m=)
---
At night, when I am in my foraging loadout and I've swapped even more damage perks out for more XP under Perception, my DPS drops even more: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3944fab&amp;d=sg2ln0p10p22p40pp2es2eh0c62cr0i12ic4ir2ig2ii0a00ao0a30ah0ar2s72lu2lb2l91l71lf0&amp;w=&amp;n=forage-night&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3944fab&amp;d=sg2ln0p10p22p40pp2es2eh0c62cr0i12ic4ir2ig2ii0a00ao0a30ah0ar2s72lu2lb2l91l71lf0&amp;w=&amp;n=forage-night&amp;m=)
---
For me, the Legendary Perk system will allow me to rebalance my builds so that I can get back some of that lost DPS while still having quality of life perks in place.
---
Note that, even with these self-nerfs, I still do incredible damage on live.
---
Agreed to be honest I want 10k limit
---
So yes, but spelled wrong because of the whole being unintelligent thing, gotcha.
---
You say you agree but still don't want ten bullets from an handmade to be more effective then your single pot shot? I get what your saying the dev's should rebalance combat so that not only one build works and everything else is useless. But that's kinda what they are trying to do by eliminating meta builds that do 3200 damage. They just need more personalized changes to damage instead of a general nerf.
---
Ya bloodied is awesome because of all the synergy!! 
---
Wish they would redo a bunch of the perks and legendary effects to get some more cool options.
---
I get where you're coming from but he's totally right. In Queen fights bloodied people get squished all the time only to be either picked up or respawn like nothing happened. You're not even at risk of losing junk anymore. 
---
In fact, I do bloodied in PA sometimes and it gets annoying seeing other Bloodied players not wearing PA and getting downed constantly in Queen fights. It's legit made people careless and lazy.
---
You haven’t suggested anything. You’ve bitched, called it a big and argued with everyone who’s told you how your wrong. Take a hint man... you’re just wrong. You want safe workshops, but FO1st.
---
The solar set is pretty great and might be very good for dailt ops. The healing stacks with everyone else wearing the same set.
---
Add in ricochet which gives a 45% chance ( at max rank) to avoid any incoming ranged Attack
---
Well there *should* be some new mods for the SS armor if Bethesda doesn’t mess up with the patch again.
---
Ok I won't spend that much, just might wait for Graham in a decade😂
---
I have 43 level ups set aside already
---
I was shot from behind while using the stash box. well actually I was club from behind but you know what I mean. I was dead before I got out of the menu.
---
The actual solution is to build like six to eight turrets that all have line of sight on the workshop table. They go aggro as soon as the guy challenges your workshop.
---
And we still don't end up with any meaningful PVP.
---
The whole mechanism is just stupid as it exists right now.
---
What I'm suggesting is that instead the guy would basically just take your shit if you're a pass fest. By that I mean the workstation. You could then look at the guy who killed you and decide whether or not you wanted to fight him. And if you did want to fight him, which I suspect few would, then you would have that choice going forward.
---
I had stored all my junk except for like a blood bug proboscis and a tick gland or whatever.
---
It's not that he got something out of it, it said it was a cheap move that ruined my enjoyment of the evening.
---
I got over it after I vented and then everybody else had a precious cow.
---
Almost nobody PvP's because there is no game balance in the PVP mechanism.
---
But as it stands now the workstation mechanic is basically denied to low-level characters simply because you can be killed while you're in a menu. there isn't like any warm-up or countdown the guy pushed the button turned around and boarded me in the head twice and then I was down. I can't think it was fulfilling for him, and it was annoying to me.
---
I've offered a solution but apparently the sensitive griefers can't comprehend it.
---
That's not what I'm interested in.
---
So I ran Alpha for the longest time bc everyone did... I thought it was the easiest or something.
---
After I was able to solo it, I remember going to Beta, and was like “F YEAH! This will be a new adventure!”
---
I was so disappointed...
---
HAIL HAIL AND HAIL!
---
Your second point makes a lot of sense. However, if they properly designed it, they could balance them so that they're all roughly equal. Or better yet, they could design for a different play style for each silo, like one for stealth builds, one for heavy, and one for who knows. But that could grow old as well, so yeah...just hope for balance if this happens.
---
Feel like they wouldn't know how to code that.
---
HAIL AND HAIL !
---
It's easy enough to test on the PTS with no long-term repercussions to your live build. So Rifleman perks were boosting your pistol damage as well? That seems a bit broken.
---
I was actually in the stash box menu, I was using sleep as an example. Because I wasn't caught up in all the details at the moment. The guy pushed the button on the workstation turned around and club me over the head twice before I could get out of the menu.
---
So why would I use the stash box in a workstation?
---
Because I was carrying a lot of non-junk, so he didn't get anything, I couldn't fast travel, and I've got my camp where I want it which wasn't here.
---
The actual reason I took the workstation was simply to get the 250 season points or whatever they're called. Then I decided to build a stash box. Then I dropped a couple turrets but they weren't facing the workstation thing because I figured I would keep the camp for that one EP boost of defender camp. After I killed cave crickets and got all their meat. I went to my stash box, saved all my junk except for like a blood bud trigger process and a tick stomach. I might have had three of those. It's for the stupid boy scout thing. and then I heard a click and then I got hit twice and I hit exit and then it started to load out and I was on my knees.
---
Saying " trying to rest " was simpler than all that bullshit.
---
Like imagine if there was a good support build that would let you turn your whole team into tanks with the Medic mod or if Nocturnal has a day counterpart and a mutation that changed depending on the time of day. Heck Mutant could be better if instead of “Damage increased by 10% if you are mutated” it gets changed to “Damage increased by 10% for each mutation” but it’d probably need to have a cap since +190% seems excessive
---
I do want it to be more effective. Non auto rifles arent meta, i honestly cant say ive seen more than 3 or 4 people using pipe revolvers ever. If i get detected by 3 plus enemies im dead, because it doesnt shoot fast enough to kill them all, and against anything it cant 1 shot, auto rifles do way more damage per second. 
---
Non auto rifles have always been the 1 shot slow firing sneaky option, theyre still slower at clearing locations than auto rifles, but the do it for less ammo, and are less likely to get you detected.
---
When i played auto rifles i was hitting for about 1000, i think normally a bit more but it was a while ago and i dont really remember, per shot. I can shoot probably 10 bullets in the time it takes a pipe revolver to shoot 2, so auto rifles are already better in most ways, i just dont want non auto to lose their only advantage.
---
Why do y'all wanna ruin a good thing? Everyone needs ammo and everyone can take workshops
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one who watches him, he is so awesome!
---
U mean “bugthesda”
---
I like his strict gameplay . Cheaters forbidden
---
I think a good compromise would be to mark all duped gear with an icon that displays that its duped. Zero out its PVP damage. Make its scrip and trade value zero. Granted im not opposed to just nuking all duped gear either, but that could fuck honest players, as you've pointed out.
---
I don't disagree. What i am saying is that the whole "Bloody/Unyeilding" build is now pointless, because you gain almost nothing out of making yourself the annoying squishy bloody sucker.
---
&gt; Just you know, have each Silo present it’s own unique challenge.
---
If they all take the same amount of time to complete, sure.
---
But it's probably more trouble than it's worth.
---
&gt; Of course not being too hard since the Queen is the main challenge.
---
~~Everyone's favorite ammo dump~~
---
I've lost legendary robots even with the camera. At least one ended up under a car and I couldn't loot it.
---
Yeah I know, I just wish there would be more diversity, you know?
---
The pistol recieves damage from both, yes. Thats why it gets hit so hard by the change (no 1.2x1.2x1.2x1.2x1.2x1.2, same as how melee doesnt get its 1.05x1.05x1.05x... from strength. Its not really broken honestly, it still does a lot less damage per second than a handmade or fixer with an auto reciever, its only advantage is it does more damage per shot. 
---
Ill mess with it tomorrow though, some good ideas that i honestly just hadnt thought of
---
Lmao
---
I can't say for sure, but it seems on-par with what I am used to when I have no other buffs (I tend to buff XP bonuses like candy, so my normal intake is much higher, but I didn't have the time to buff myself to my normal amount to test it)
---
or they where like "eh, they tried" and passed what we got
---
They know about it.
---
They may fix it and they may ban people who have them at their CAMPS.￼
---
As for now.
---
Just take the ammunition for yourself or if they are locked take the workshop and loot them.
---
How about we got recalibrated stat like change appearance once per day...
---
The rich get richer and the poor get richer, more XP for higher lvl enemies, so what if I have to kill enemies in 2-3 hits instead of 1 now lol the XP gain is worth it alone. Along with the new legendary ammo perk ? Never need to worry again.
---
And my solution solves all of those problems
---
I'm not complaining about losing the workshop.
---
I'm complaining that a character five times my level was able to kill me while I couldn't even get out of the stash box menu in time.
---
My solution suggests a way that you could be in pacifist mode, and someone can just take your workstation. And then IF You actually want to fight for the workstation You can drop past this mode and go take it back. That gives you a chance to evaluate your opponent and decide if you want the fight.
---
This way low-level characters and casual gamers like myself can make use of the resource gathering should we want it, and PVP players can instigate PVP, but the other person has to agree that they are also a PVP player.
---
And the fact that there's a despite instigate PVP made it sound like it was only going to be possible if the other person was standing there. Not that you were permanently in PvP mode.
---
That distinction hinges on the word might. It might involve you in PVP.
---
And the obvious work around is to put line of sight to six or so turrets on the PVP workbench. That if somebody triggers it they instantly go aggro in the turret shoot them dead. I've had to take out guys and power armor.
---
What a freaking waste. Like a waste of my time and resources.
---
So here's a way where a pacifist can automatically surrender instead of fight, or then again they could decide to go PVP by turning off pacifist mode after the guy claims the workstation and claim it right back.
---
Everybody gets what they potentially want as long as everybody wants it.
---
Oh i know, new challenging content instead of nerfing everything so that the old boring shit can be a challenge
---
The bee monsters are pretty creepy.
---
I think people are looking for emotional release when the nihilistic post flow-state funk sets in. I do think this is a fine place to have a debrief, as it were.
---
Hate to break it to you, but uncle Toddy is really the cork fairy.
---
Meat week is coming up at the end of the month.
---
I was thinking that perk packs could also give 3-5 perk coins along with the 5 cards.
---
Until they remove presents forever, and add in higher teir 4 star weapons; farming 3 star God rolls is futile. Everyone has the same bloodied weapon and armor. The market is fake, nothing is worth anything. Caps don't matter because presents exist.
---
Before I did silos I was under the impression they'd be different. Like at least a different challenge to fix, but no they're all exactly the same and tbh I don't wanna run a silo and do the same thing every time
---
Is One Wasteland coming with Patch 22?
---
Will do, fantastic chance to fill up on 308. and 5mm, thank you
---
Probably not the worst idea to take a break then. I did just before the legendary run and will do again between seasons.
---
Thank you
---
Thanks bro
---
Yep, Whitespring Sentry bots are nice but exclusively... I could never do that. I did 30 min run Whitespring, West Tek and Harpers Ferry/The Burrows or Charleston Capital plus events; Radiation Rumble, Line in the sand and SBQ.
---
I can’t believe it either
---
It’s...interesting. Honestly, I lived with it all day, then went back to the live game for a while tonight and gave things a long think. Its a huge shock to the system, but doing it this way really opens up a lot of options and makes certain choices and combos more viable. 
---
For example, if I run a Vampire’s handmade at low health, I’m only doing a bit less damage than a Bloodied in the new system—but I can stay alive easier. In the live game, I’d never consider that because the damage is just so much higher with Bloodied. 
---
I picked up a Suppressor’s FFR Gatling Laser, trash in the live game right? Well, that could now be a very useful support weapon for Daily Ops or harder events—because things can actually kill us now. 
---
All the chems I’d usually just default sell to train station vendors, well, now that extra damage or accuracy bonus suddenly matters. 
---
By essentially flattening the curve between other builds and Bloodied/Junkie’s, it makes them less obvious choices. It hurts to see the damage drop, but I’m also realizing how many more options and play styles have been opened up. I’m not entirely sold on it yet, but I’m a lot more open to it than I was. It certainly made me think about things differently than before.
---
I was thinking they could also have a rotation of what happens. Like each day or something each silo has a different challenge to do, so there's not one silo being constantly used, and it changes it up so you're not doing the same thing each time
---
There is no announcement made prior to returning. They come back when they come back.
---
That's a good idea as well, we simply need more sources, a grindable source at that would be great
---
Ye I think there’s about 3-4 weeks before the next season starts isn’t there? assuming the next one starts when this one ends.
---
If the next season works the same and I have to log in daily then that’s gonna suck though. I did this season because it was the first but even if I love the game which I do in ways, nobody wants to feel forced to log in every. single. day.
---
If auto weapons are already better then nothing is really changing for you except now everyone  isn't 1 shooting
---
Her and Beckett are the only 2 NPCs I really like.
---
Funny enough I have all 3 bloodied pipe weapons.
---
Pipe pistols are the worst IMO.
---
Revolvers and Bolt actions stack with perks pretty well though.
---
I crie
---
Scrap perk scrapping!
---
In my experience, even when people take workshops they never lock the resource extractors.  You can turn a profit fast traveling to an occupied workshop and emptying the extractors (assuming they built anything but turrets).
---
That seems like an oversight rather than a feature. I'd even go as far as sending a ticket into customer service cause it's supposed to be a reward account wide.
---
If you want to freeze Earl in place, you don't need cryo for that. You can just cripple his legs.
---
Unlike the queen, Earl's limbs can actually be crippled.
---
That is awesome!  I can tell you put a lot of detail and thought into it.  Also impressed at all the time you probably spent rounding up all those skill books and bobbleheads.
---
Radicool. Because I like for my teamates to be cool (regardless of wether they are Blodied or not).
---
Nah lol
---
Look, if you want a lead mining simulator grind game, fill your boots. Play with a 10mm pistol and a food build and enjoy taking 40 shots to kill a radroach: The rest of us like things as they are and would welcome some balancing but not this clumsy clusterfuck.
---
I’m currently leveling up a pistol toon, my first. It’s so frustrating. The pistols are pea shooters, garbage. I’m underpowered working with underpowered guns and it’s a tedious grind. I think it will be worth it cause eventually I’ll be able to get silenced gauss pistols. But imagining the whole game being like this is too annoying.
---
Reputation gain remains the same. It is a grind to be sure.
---
Without spoiling it, is that a “have you seen the rewards yet??? They’re amazing!!” or “have you see the rewards yet? Sad trombone...” please set my expectations lol
---
For me when I log it shows the current weapon as 0/0 ammo despite the truth.  This corrects when I change weapons but if I try to shot I'll reload instead.  This also fixes the issue.
---
I've kind of just ignored it forever as it's really not a big deal to me.  Just change weapons on log in and go.  Dot even draw it, just hotkey 1, hotkey 2.  Done.
---
It definitely still needs some attention, some weapon types need buffs with the new system even more than they already did, weapon condition needs a huge buff across the board, ammo needs to be increased in the world to accommodate the increased usage etc. 
---
That said, leveling the playing field of builds makes me feel like there are other interesting ways to play the game. Enemies are tougher, new end game stuff like Daily Ops and Colossal Problem require are least temporary shakeups...this certainly makes things more interesting to say the least.
---
Amen!
---
That would be very fair. Pay the scrap difference between the previous level and the new one.
---
They seem to be hell bent on stripping out every last vestige of fallout being a rpg and leaving the game nothing more than a brainless shooter.
---
By nerfing everyone it just makes all the other builds even less viable. Bloodied will still be what everyone is running. Where’s the logic in this??
---
New function called "Ops" is testing pretty brutal. Forces a bit more team play. Also new balance does make "Colossal Problem" more of a team experience. They are trying new enemy mechanics, that may still need some tuning. If you have other games and you can let this one chill for a bit; you might like what you find when you return.
---
Your "solution" is just whining to make an already easy and absolutely **voluntary** part of the game even easier and safeguard it so you get all the rewards without doing shit-all.
---
You want easy resource collection? Well, tough luck, others what that too and there's limited options, fight for it. You don't want to fight because you're such a pacifist? Well, than put more effort into collecting the same mats without putting a target on your back.
---
No, all you absolutely do is whining because the game is not easy enough yet as something a five year old could play with both eyes closed.
---
Uhhh well you can earn 1400 per day from robot vendors, you can sell things in a vending machine, you get caps from events and enemies...
---
I know it's in the legendary run but before the legendary run  my friend told me we have to get high rep with raiders for the ammo converter but I think he ment to say something else.
---
&gt; What else are you using it for?
---
In case expanding bunkers in the future requires tens of thousands of resources.
---
Wait...............
---
Well fuck me with a mini nuke, that is something new to learn.
---
I would still like to be able to scrap perks as I have received like 5 or 6 exterminator perk cards that I a)will never use and b)already have a rank selection of anyhow so any more is ridiculous.  
---
I just want to be able to get rid of the numerous copies.  Like i only needed max rank for crafting cards, not all individuals and the like.  For cleaning up purposes.
---
How's it set up on the table though? Say for example there's a 5* gun, with the primary attributes. How are weapons stored currently? Because depending on how it's done, the script might be unable to identify how each star is stored
---
For sure, I just feel like to make this game not feel like a chore for some people, they need to remove the dailys.
---
I was one of the people defending the dailys until I burnt out on them and realised how they do more damage than they do good. Like I say I really do love this game deep down but it’s like if I was in an amazing relationship but my partner wanted me to watch harry potter every day or something like ye honey I like harry potter but I don’t want to have to watch it every single day.
---
Shit comparison but you get my point 🤣🤣🤣
---
It gets them views/clicks though.
---
As much as you hate it, you went to the site.  So you gave them exactly what they wanted.  
---
The media loves sensationalizing every single thing.
---
Drama makes money.
---
I'm currently leveling up a character and would love to trade you for it
---
No, the issue is massive sweeping changes across the board with no system in place to allow everyone to adjust. 
---
“Welcome to games as a service” my ass. Any major online service has ways of dealing with this. Respecs for all etc. further more, the focus on this when you have dupes an exploits everywhere is mind boggling.  
---
There is more to game balance beyond nerfs, has there been a single buff to anything beside energy weapon conditions and the stash size?  Or what about the 90% of legendary modifiers being basically trash filler.  
---
I also dont think youre taking into consideration that this is happening alongside one wasteland, so now not only is everyone taking a hit to there damage output, enemy’s are getting buffed.  Its going to be a sponge party and not the fun kind.
---
That may be the glitched weapons. There is a bug that makes certain weapons melt high health enemies. It’s not modded, it’s a Bethesda glitch.
---
Yea I feel this, endgame bosses excluded. Earlier this week there was a squad instantly killing all the legendary mole miners that I couldn’t do anything and I joined the event for the legendary kill challenge. Very annoying
---
This is the reason wearing power armor is must when you see camps with height, safety first
---
Ya, they could refund us a special point or pick a new card that does fit into your build.
---
Or just hide cards you don't want to see.
---
Ye I ain’t ever meaning to come off as a negative nelly, I have praised this game a lot but even thinking about it the camp building has become pretty ridiculous for me too...
---
I mean I know the only way they earn an income on the game is cosmetics and camp items but when they suck you into the loop of the game they kind of get you in a really disgusting addiction 😬 but that’s another point.
---
They might also have snuck in a change where pistol/rifle perks no longer stack.  I suspected that was coming after they kill the meat hook.  I don’t use a pipe revolver, so I don’t know.
---
Ruined tabletop DnD as well. Looking at you, 5th edition.
---
Is your wife hot?.... asking for a friend...
---
1. The gear you grinded your ass off for is still perfectly usable and in many cases still the best gear you can use.  They didn't go through and decide "FUCK BLOODIED BUILDS! " they changed the way ALL Damage is calculated.
---
2. People soloing the fucking Queen is probably something that never should have been happening in the first place and is a prime example of how fucked up damage calculations have been until now.
---
3. So your logic is seriously that they're allowed to change something about damage ONCE and then too bad can never change it again?  The TSE nerf is the one and only chance they got to adjust damage?  Get a fucking grip.
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
Thanks. I had 980 in my box.
---
Well being that melee gets by far the highest single damage numbers in the game and that's kinda what's being nerfed then I'm sorry but your damage will take quite a hit. Bloodied melee will suffer the worst from these changes. You should still OHKO most mobs though so don't worry too much.
---
See I learned there game engine and how it operates and handles textures and entities just so I can break there games right away. 
---
Skyrim I broke out of the map and was bucket flying within a few hours of play day 1.
---
Fallout 4, didnt pick up the pip boy my first time leaving the vault as I glitched the door.
---
Fallout76, first beta play session, left the vault turned right and proceeded to crouch slip into the rock wall and fall through the map. 
---
It started as a fun little challenge to see how fast I can break the game, but now it isnt even an ounce of effort.
---
I SMASH THE SHIT out of them. Between my legit ammo factory and other workshops, and the Armco I farm ammunition and play holo games while they replenish. It's great for AFK-ing in a way.
---
8 dwellers enter... 1 dweller leaves. Kinda thunderdome like. Could be fun.
---
Tbh none of legendary perks even excite me.
---
Trying to do something different and fun!
---
I know... Just thinking on all the possibility 😉
---
When a bag despawns the items inside disappear.  When an enemy corpse despawns, it occasionally drops the items on the ground in their place.  It's common in locations where there is a high enemy density, and even then it's still only occasional. 
---
An enemy probably died in the camp, and the heavy, unappealing loot was left behind.
---
It really seems to me that Bethesda wants all the casual players to move on. If they want to nerf something nerf the legacies.  Low health builds allow the casual player with an AA do reasonable damage. Nobody plays this game to farm ammo and pay devs and hackers on eBay for legacy weapons so they can kill a ghoul before getting one shotted by it 🙂. Then again it was.a good run and maybe Cyberpunk won't suck.
---
I think so
---
&gt; the only reason anybody does Uranium fever is for the legendaries
---
Really? The legendaries are underleveled (as of the current live patch anyway). So if you need the scrip, then sure I guess, but the actual drops themselves are useless.
---
Good way for people to gamble too, saw a few posts about people saying there needs to be a casino in FO76
---
Have you tried the queen yet? I've been screwing around with my bloodied Heavy and hoping I can still do like at least 50 damage per prime round to her. Being pessimistic and expecting the worst though.
---
Lets demand it
---
Is it this red door? (I’m not playing right now so can’t check)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i9vc99/i_am_looking_for_this_red_door_what_plans_is_it/
---
To me, the fact that they haven't suggests they can't, which, I mean...
---
*mindblown.gif*
---
Yes this is more accurate
---
Please stop using this excuse to justify bad game design. Just stop.
---
i run bloodied, 462, and i know full well how trading, duping, and hacking works.
---
i’m also on console, where hacking isn’t a thing, just duping. and i fully agree that every single duped or hacked item should be deleted from all players, regardless of how they got it. 
---
this shit is fully inexcusable, and there is no exceptions.
---
I have not.  I didn’t spend a ton of time on the PTS.
---
The legendary perks seem like such a chore to me. I like having alot of support cards that I can swap out as well as having build options (being able to swap back and forth between heavy, melee, and shotguns for example). So that means I will not be scrapping that many cards which means that I am SOL. Oh well, I guess I will just have to accept that I will not have the most optimal build.
---
That is the door!!! Thank you so much :)
---
The exact same way damage would be applied to us?
---
I mean it's not like the mole rat is going to scale to level 100 for you and randomly also scale to level 100 for the pipe.  NPCs and objects as well should have their own levels, so it should just scale to their levels.  
---
Arguably this should mean tougher and more resilient npcs when up against stronger enemies since they should end up dealing more damage and taking less as everything scales to their levels.
---
Glass camp building set is a highlight for me
---
Same here man , and sell my kids+dogs lmao
---
Lmao 😅
---
Not a bug it’s a reason mr pebbles and was a selling point in the atom shop when released. Showed it in the dark lit up
---
I wish that there was a tab that showed everything you've built in your camp/workshop, so you can choose to store/scrap it from there if you have trouble finding it, or it glitches into a wall and you can't move it.
---
the Captain Cosmos helmet does the same thing.
---
Sweet, yet another problem getting cleared
---
They should just have the legendary perks rank up with legendary scrip.
---
Let players sell cards for scrip just to get them out of the inventory.
---
We don't need another new currency.  We have enough.
---
Everyone is saying they don't care about AFK guys till this gets implemented and there are more guys standing there doing nothing then guys helping out and still getting rewarded for just "I showed up". It's like giving the kids in last place a "participation ribbon" that teaches them that you will always get a reward no matter what. So what is the point of doing anything? If you can get legendary loot for standing there and looking cute then the event will be way to crowded with AFK people blocking you from doing your job and completing the damn event. Then the event fails and no one gets anything. This games player base is 75% just guys who wish it was an AFK loot game so yeah that would get old fast. Point being? The point is that everyone complains for them to do this, they listen and do it, then they complain about them doing it for some other reason. "Ha ha, you work and earn your money when all I have to do is sit here watching you work and make the same amount as you!"
---
I have swapped alot of cards &amp; points in my 516 levels , am i fucked for having multiple max lvl cards or do we get points if splitting cards ?
---
Yeah I feel you. It’s best to play it off an on. Fortunately Bethesda is adding a lot more interesting stuff to do like Daily Ops and Expeditions so hats off to them for doing that.
---
Oooo, you should totally build a CAMP specifically for this event! You got to have a thunderdome!
---
The plans for it are very pricey, but you can also get someone to build you one for free if you ask around.
---
Some dumbass downvoted this but it's true. Since it's not from the atom shop there's no restriction of where you can build the door.
---
Most things are in this game.
---
*pats my 2 shot cryolator
---
Friendly Fire for events that require defending NPCs like Rad Rumble and Project Paradise
---
I have trouble hearing people in game too.  They can hear me fine, but I can't hear them although I can see them talking.  And then there are times when I get players that come by the camp blasting music and I can apparently hear that.  I had someone playing some rap the other day and I commented that Appalachian radio was playing some different music today.
---
The only one I see for me is the ammo one.
---
I find dailies give me purpose. Otherwise you wander around, fire a nuke, stock your vendors... Lose your way a bit. 
---
Now I can log in, and be done in &lt;30mins if I need to.
---
You also don't need to do it every day. I stay in line with Zorbo and haven't spent a dime whilst missing a day or two here and there and not doing NW challenges either.
---
One question: where are you getting the 0.66 from in your math? Is that Adrenal Reaction? I thought that was capped at 50% when you were at or below 20% health.
---
I'm not even trying to justify how it is now cause it is bad but I dont think people should just get free items for being at an event.
---
Can't be all that hard for them to have base weapons, mods and affixes generate a combined checksum, run that against "legal" weapon loadouts and a low grade bot can automate the deletion of impossible weapons at any time.
---
You couldn't be more right about screwing all the casual players who have crap weapons because blooded unyeilding legacies are so OP.  Junkies sucks anyways so let's drop it 20% so you can farm ammo instead of play the game.
---
You're not meant to have all the legendary perks on a single character.  It's just a way to reward those who do actually leave their spouse and hit level 1500.  Most people are going to have to actually make a choice about what they want.
---
There's a really cool vintage radio show from the 1960's called Long John Nebel's Party Line he had a lot of UFO and monster people on it. There are loads of episodes on the internet archive.
---
NDA's are more for when you want to keep content secret, like how they didn't want people spoiling everything about Wastelanders.
---
What this is more proof of is that too many people participating in the PTS neither understand it's purpose or how they're supposed to be handling this stuff.  Someone finds a bug that if reported to the actual official PTS forum would never make it into the actual build of the game, but instead they run to reddit and start a panic.
---
Ye I agree you don’t have to do it every day and it does give you a sense of purpose.
---
Feel like it would just be better if they just made it weeklys and made the dailys not refresh, for example if I could log on on Thursday and do my dailys from Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday instead of being able to do only Thursdays cause I missed tuesday n wednesday if that makes sense. Feel like the SCORE system just needs improving, the daily scrip limits etc need to be weekly, etc.
---
Incorrect. EVERYTHING has been nerfed, because everything was multiplicative before and is now additive. 
---
It's a bold move, I'll grant them that, but damn it's gonna suck for a minute.
---
Radsquitos, they freeze my game when I hit vats.  Even when I vat a yaogui, if one is near me..   error
---
Fair enough I guess. If they are so useless, why one shot them before the low level players get a chance though?
---
lol the people downvoting must be idiots that like unfair advantages and can't play properly without that OP crutch
---
Yeah, my concern is using more resources to do a job. More bullets to kill something that you spent the last year killing with less bullets isn't going to be pleasant. Our play style ought change over time, and in a game where resources are measured, collected and spent, this change may make things feel like a slog.
---
Especially when forced to play nuclear winter! All I want to do is open one effing safe. But everyone is spawning there.
---
I’m praying they bring back the mission to get the display pumpkins.
---

---
There shouldn't be any affect on AA because it's not an actual damage boost like the others.  From what I've heard the issue with other legendary effects is that they switched the damage calculations to be additive rather than multiplicative, but AA doesn't have any damage modifiers to begin with because it's just reducing the enemies armor value when it does the calculations.
---
Yeah I run bloodied, I just didn't realize why junkies would be effected this drastically by just one mutation nerf
---
the comparison works for me. I am against time gates and dailies as well, I think there are better ways to engage the audience on a daily basis that includes more novelty and meaning. I have made a bunch of other posts to that effect.
---
They are camping by the effing locks. Eff this stupid challenge!
---
I did fasnacht a dozen times before I finally got a shot on the Megasloth. I ended up nuking the event I was so pissed.
---
Nah I didnt click the link at all this just popped up on my phone. 
---
I know its clickbait
---
They are called legendaries for a reason.
---
I look at them like something that I will eventually get, but I can live without.
---
Surprised to find someone without a stash of bad perks, every pack is 3 shit ones and a mediocre you usually already have. 😂
---
New content is coming pretty soon. A break until then is my best advice
---
They shouldn't nerf they should boost AA Junkies and Vampires.
---
It makes me feel bad every time it happens.  Because inevitably there's player down and in need of a stimpak.  And normally I'd help them out, but... well sorry mate, I've only got a few seconds to loot that thing and get away before it blows itself to who knows where.
---
Quack
---
Edit: Wait, is it a duck or a chicken?
---
Also have a VANS thing where holding down vats leads you on a path to the nearest dead legendary. Bloody mess is great but it sucks when a legendary explodes and it's parts get launched into California it can be hard to get the weapon.
---
play something else for a while then
---
im having a blast personally, but i prefer rigid daily structure, idk why just works for me to have set goals and targets
---
I haggled one down to 1250. Always looking for new building plans though.
---
Thanks, looks like I'm on schedule :)
---
Swing Speed Plus Strength too
---
yep- i prefer dailies, events, etc, i need structure
---
as long as you're ahead of zorbo youre fine
---
i have a friend with a camp like this, thought it was a feature LOL
---
id rather let people ammo gen though but thats just greedy me being greedy
---
If they can't figure out how to make auto-close work, I'd take locks that allies can't open. Those assholes need to learn their place, and it is not upstairs.
---
you arent "forced"
---
i just finished zorbo never set foot in NW i dont pvp. at all.
---
It's not a statistic.
---
I love the way you have a dismissive term and everything.
---
I've been playing since day one and this is the first time I've actually been scragged in a workshop. Most people are helpful and friendly.
---
It may be a perception.
---
The servers may match people by playstyle most of the time perhaps. I don't know.
---
99% of my interactions have been friendly.
---
I'm not counting nuclear winter of course.
---
if you think most people are doing PVP, or even more than half the people are doing PVP, that doesn't match my experience.
---
You don't need to invent a specific term for griefers, and the people who are PVP willfully have my best wishes. I don't present the other people who want to do it, I just want the right to not do it while still accessing 100% of the game I paid for without having to go in sign up for a yearly membership.
---
The Master Infiltrator perk is going to be ace for breaking into people's camps to get a big bounty going in order to start some PvP.
---
Ammo Factory is exceptionally decent.
---
Follow Through miiight be great depending on your build.
---
The Legendary S.P.E.C.I.A.L. perks are interesting because they open the door to much more versatile builds.
---
Compared to the original Legendary perks, these are much better. The system itself is a decadent and depraved grind, but the perks at least are good.
---
I have Red Menace in my inventory. But the challenge tracking system thinks I don’t.
---
Yep. Level 467 and found this out about 10 levels ago.
---
Got it easy using a combat knife during Leader of the Pack.  Got 3 legendaries while I was at it.
---
That’s a real shame. Add the nerfed damage and you’ve got a grind fest to boot.
---
Yup I'm level 245 and im gonna 100% treat those perks like "If It happens, it happens" not even gonna try and grind that.
---
U thought bethesda fixed something in the game
---
I think they just let you pick a legendary perk every 10 levels pass 50 where you can pick one or upgrade one.
---
Another stupid post from someone who don't know situation
---
the rank one perks are already pretty good, i understand why its such a hassle to get even 1 max level, max level on some of them are absolutely insane, but i do sort of agree that 1000+ levels to fully upgrade more than 1 is pretty bonkers
---
My friend showed me one and I kept laughing. It looks so stupid.
---
Learnt??? You mean learned?!?
---
I do aquaboy/aquagirl because, well... nobody else does.
---
One should never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. Thinking that the developers of this game has specifically designed this bad game design system in an effort to push the Fallout first subscription which didn't exist when this game design was created is giving them way too much credit. This is an instance of bad game design bred by stupidity and unfamiliarity with the genre, nothing more nothing less
---
edit to correct voice to text errors
---
Significantly better than season 1, in my opinion. Speaking as a camp enthusiast.
---
never set foot in NW, hate pvp in any format, but still finished the legendary grind
---
I took all my UNY off and killed a sentrybot and got around 300xp. Put UNY back on and got around 400xp. Popped berry mentats and weren't up further.
---
Also did this with low level scorched. Was getting 52 56 and 60+ depending on what I was using buff wise. It was working. I didn't calculate all the math but it's good it's working!
---
I also read on PTS forums that they recreated the build public team as a casual team. IDT INT buff is going anywhere.
---
so, the ops increase the need for team play. There are already a few viable medic perks (I think). Bloodied builds could really use that super damage boost from being revived often. You could have a medic, a heavy, and two bloodied builds. Learning the rebalance WITH the legendary perks and harder enemies offers a new game to play - as it were.
---
Thanks for sharing, even if it doesn't seem to work for most people.
---
NW challenges are just a way to get PVE casuals killed, and the challenges themselves are often a chore or something dumb like standing in fire for X minutes. It's the same in any other game with challenges, PVP especially.  Somebody is gonna see the daily/weekly and end up camping the challenge until somebody comes along and they either kill them or pop out and complete the task before they have a chance so they can grief them. 
---
It's not fun or engaging, it's placing me in a position where I'm not having fun because I have to engage with some task or mode I'd rather ignore in favour of more interesting or rewarding aspects.
---
I'm suddenly curious: can we freeze the SBQ with cryo bows and crossbows? (*looks planningly at cryo-modded crossbow in stash box*)
---
I see no valid argument against this idea. Worst case scenario is afk mooching and, then, so what if that happens here or there? No one else loses anything in the process.
---
&gt; I hope he enjoyed the three bug parts I was carrying in my junk bag.
---
Most bug parts can be scrapped down into acid, which is actually pretty useful.
---
hey at least there's an upside
---
Ya most of the time public teams don't play together they are just there for the buffs.
---
I never use a mic never had anyone get mad.
---
Yes. 9 times outta 10 the team I join, no one is on a mic.
---
I'm using 8 loadouts now thanks to PC mod community. I have some cards that I need at different levels depending on my loadout. Some I use at tier 1,3 and 5 depending on need.
---
We will be needing lots of cards for different loadouts.
---
Will this also mean I can get a legendary higher then 50? Especially since there going to nerf practically every damage center builds?
---
It does feel like a job but honestly I'm grateful for it during the pandemic. I haven't lost my real job but we're working from home in a slow period at work so when I'm out of tickets to fix I'll just hop on 76 when I'm done with chores/errands/exercise. It keeps me from driving my wife insane anyways.
---
Thanks! This is exactly the type of show I was looking for.
---
I suggest making a new bloodied toon now (or pick a mule you already have) and power level until they update adventure. You can use perk cards from any toon.
---
A buddy on Discord told me Explosive Bait can still deal damage to CAMPs, even in pacifist mode. It's shitty, but hey, it isn't like Bethesda is well known for letting bugs like that last, right?
---
I personally will pool my bullion and legendary modules since i don't have anything i need really badly. Everything i got left to buy are like "meh, i might get that one day".
---
There should already be a record for every possible combination of weapons/gear parts that are allowed to exist.  The fact that you can even enter a server with an item that shouldn't exist is a serious flaw in their anti cheat capabilities.
---
You shouldn’t have too. I do not do them and am 4 spots ahead of the alien. I log in...do the dailies...maybe a bit of extra if a friend is on once a week or so and log off. 
---
I will have no trouble finishing and will mention that I have yet to experience the auto complete bug if that makes a difference.
---
The flip side is you can use them to destroy trap camps.
---
Thanks for the info. I was just really surprised and trying to figure out if it was an exploit.
---
same, been had been waiting
---
One Wasteland =/= the change to damage calculation. 
---
Same time? Sure. But it’s not a fundamental part of One Wasteland.
---
What?
---
I play 1 hour or so a day. Get all my dailies done and weeklies throughout the week and am 4 spots ahead of the alien. It doesn’t take that much work to complete things.
---
And when they are, for me at least, someone is always being loud in the background.
---
There's still a few ways they can "indirectly" cause damage, I won't go into details to allow more people to easily troll. 
---
Unfortunately this hasn't been addressed yet as it's probably very difficult to automatically determine that radiant indirect damage vs intentional damage vs "NPC" damage.
---
Imagine in WoW if you could get a Max item level item by randomly walking around the open-world and killing enemies but there was only a 1 in 5000 chance that it would actually have the correct primary stat it should have, strength on a two-handed sword for example, otherwise it has Intelligence or agility and sometimes Spirit even though that was phased out many expansions ago. That's a much more accurate comparison
---
Edit to add: also there's no Dungeons and only  2 world bosses one of which has a really low chance to spawn.
---
It plays the music that was in the atom shop during the Halloween event or around that time
---
I was faithfully doing dailies till a couple days ago, as I am behind on the season levels. However, last night I logged in to "force myself" to do them and after doing a couple of the dead simple ones, I looked at the list and realized that the remainder just didn't sound interesting or fun. Logged out, and didn't do them today either. I don't know that I'll do them for another few days at least.
---
Pity, I really had only planned on going through level 85 and buying the rest. Now I'm not even sure I'll make that.
---
Why are you saying you guys? I never said I liked the brotherhood. Plus Danse wasn’t always a synth
---
I do strong back because none of my others that may be useful are group friendly or I lack the charisma to share them.
---
you can try vs sbq in private, it's the best.
---
in my test, a lot of time when you have 2 magic perks, it will not work or bad.
---
my best result is  "Uny leg with the perk reduce damage whilst blocking " and BFFR
---

---
The game is kinda autopilot at this point. Most people know how to run any events you wanna do. You just show up, steamroll everything, and leave when you wanna or whatever. Also bonus is free fast travel to their bases and camps so... I mean this ain’t cod, literally nothing happens that’s so important you need to speak to another player.
---
Oh it's going to be a grind, no question. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Loadouts are still a mirage for consoles, unfortunately.
---
If you already bought everything you wanted, save your gold. There are a few new things in the PTS.
---
\- You can get from Regs &gt;!4 new blade mods (cryo, flaming, plasma, shock) for a new weapon called "War Glaive". No idea where do you get that weapon tho.!&lt;
---
\- Now they also sell lunchboxes for 100 gold each.
---
\- You can also get the ammo converter and the chicken coop from Raiders and Settlers respectively, in case you missed them this season.
---
Imagine if in wow you could get gear by walking around in the open world and killing enemies that is as good or BETTER than gear that someone obtained from a heroic raid...
---
Some shitter who hasn't done any actual content just got lucky and got something better than a guy who spent time and effort in some of the highest tier end game content.
---
How do you know what the team objective is without a mic? Do you just all follow each other?
---
teams will be more of a thing next season, OPS are best with multiple people. It can work with no mic if you can pay attention.
---
I can’t even use my gauss minigun if they really do that. I spend 2K ultracite 2mmEC now and it’s 20 crimson flux, how could I sustain it if they even nerf the damage? Are they trying to push people to use legacies or magic weapons? Because the other weapons are gonna be useless and wasting huge amount of ammo
---
Wouldn't waste too much time on it as looks like magic effects will go away with patch 22
---
Some items aren’t duped through hacking but via glitches ingame. So they aren’t “hacked” weapons but I understand your sentiment.
---
I’m on console so I’m sure I’ve come across plenty of duped weapons but I’m yet to noticed a hacked one.
---
Even 2=&gt;1 or 3=&gt;1 would be great
---
Yeah it was like a chain of mines that exploded one after the other. Looked like a literal controlled demolition.
---
And it actually makes the game a bit more challenging. A good thing. It’s just a matter of how idiotic is the player base? They’d rather have a buff to weapons and a buff to enemies then just nerfing weapons, when all it does is affect the numbers your weapons show, regardless of how good or bad they are
---
Jesus that was insane. 2 seconds. So I have a similar leg with that perk. Pair it was an over 200 fire rate gun and it should be similar? As long as that armor is equipped? Great video.
---
It was a reallllll boring weekend for sure.
---
Good question. I hope someone answers instead of downvoting.
---
I'd assume so, since it doesn't say it's excluded like the heavy gun damage buff perks.
---
No.... i am pretty skilled at jumping off stuff without getting hurt. I almost never die from falls. So i am not gonna waste perks or anything on fall protection
---
I like to go try out new weapons on lower level enemies, but if everything is going to be just as hard to kill then what's the point of having fun and switching it up every once in a while?  I'll end up dead, or have to switch back to my normal weapon
---
Yeah I assumed that the rework of the damage for the next update was probably to try and counter magic weapons etc. Something along those lines anyway. Just curious to try and test out in private for now.
---
Hi there! Yes indeed we are! Dedicating my camp to a raider-themed gladiator ring. :)
---
That jetpack reminds me of those mechanical aliens from *The Fifth Element*
---
I just found it. It’s in the bedroom with Senior Knight Wilson’s Terminal, on the bottom shelf of a rolling metal cart under the window. Really hard to see. Thanks for the tip.
---
I can't wait for legendary special cards.
---
 I'm always changing things a bit and can never find a build I 100% love, so this will help immensely.
---
In the long run, there's 0 reason not to get max leveled legendary items. Like, everyone of them should be "max" level..
---
So "technically" they didn't attack your CAMP, they set a bunch of unexploded devices into the world and then activated them. Your CAMP items just so happened to be in the area of effect for the world explosion for the device. 
---
It's an incredibly shitty troll move, thankfully most people don't know about it or try to use it since you won't get any rewards except griefing.
---
Ya thats the type of guy that is going to join every event and do that. Unfortunately the  best option at that point is to just join another world... oh and fuck that guy lol
---
the event is called Radiation rumble.
---
Pipe weapons shouldn't even be doing that much damage period. They're trash makeshift low tier weapons made to hold you over until you get a decent low tier gun like a 10mm pistol or hunting rifle.
---
Not only that but the mini nukes and missiles need a weight reduction. As of now they're useless beyond scrapping for ammo points.
---
Oh wow. Keep in mind you still can only unlock what is available at each level of perk point, even though you are lv 50+ now.
---
So your first level up will only see a few perks to choose from, then more after that.
---
There's a possible nerf to damage stacking that bloodied builds may be heavily affected by soon, but they are the best at damage dealing and are most commonly perception/agi builds.
---
An intermediate build from *scratch*, so no cookie cutter, would require some input as to what you want your fella to achieve
---
I doubt it, they'll probably just find a way to disable/remove any that aren't at the munitions plant.
---
I carry a bunch of explosive bait around, mainly to use on pvp griefers with their duped explosive gatling plasmas when they bother me.  I loot their bags, then move on to their camp, starting with their rad shower and generator.  They need to be taught a lesson...
---
Ironclad, just figure I'll help out anyone not wearing PA.
---
I don't know if the weapon you're taking about would apply either way but you can check out https://youtu.be/vno3BICsakI and that explains a bit more
---
I didnt check my bullet supply yet rip
---
Yeah no but don't feel bad I'm at tier 15 or something I haven't even tried to do any score challenges it's all been what I do naturally
---
Danse WAS always a synth. Just like Nick was always a synth. And magnolia, sturges, the mayor, etc etc etc.
---
It could just be 2 minor legendary effects.  Or for me, power armor.
---
It'd be such an easy thing to do "oh this handmade has a beam splitter from a laser rifle, and this minigun has a MIRV mod from the fatman, delete'' Just that simple.
---
It just amazes me that they're still in the game. I've taken screenshots and reported players for using them at Queen fights or wherever else as they just completely ruin the game. It's why me and my crew rarely drop nukes on public servers anymore.
---
I'm kinda hoping they all get deleted, when the next major patch comes. Getting tired of all the players that are like  "Hurr Durr, I have hacked gun that can 1 shot the Queen with."
---
Delete them, or make them weigh 500 lbs or something so you have to drop it and it auto destroys it.
---
It is if everything goes ok and they
---
 can balance it based off feed back.
---
 But it doesn't seem they use any of that feedback because legendary perks will take 1000s of levels to get them all.
---
It'll work but character models will lose their feet or we won't be able to place foundations or something bizarre and unrelated like that.
---
I'm still rocking a TS lvl35 M79, for Legendaries and especially LitS. Tags the mobs with splash and smacks the legendaries enough to matter. Good 'ol splashy/bounce house is my ride or die.
---
The problem is, if it is not sold by vendors, it is therefore a reward in some pool - maybe Daily Ops, maybe something else. I'll be glad to get it, however I can't go and buy it.
---
But obviously if I'll somehow get one, I'll post info here..
---
Adamantium Skeleton 3   
---
I really, really hate being crippled and I'm sure others do too. =D
---
Level 340 I just found that one out my friend
---
you have to shoot the same part, can depends of fps / framerate / lags. but yes, with that armor you can use any +150firerate. (if you equip your power armor it will not work)
---
and thanks :)
---
&gt;Like sheesh, crappy contracting I suppose...
---
I mean at least that's in character for what we know of the companies in game, lol.
---
I'm just going to block and move on. Only my second real negative experience since coming back to the game since launch.
---
Well theres no way to get normal weapons to do 1000x their normal damage (probably more), so yeah, they're objectively the only way.
---
Not every synth was always a synth. Some of them were, but some were people replaced with synths by the institute
---
I can never find my mic so I never join with one, you don’t have to really collaborate to benefit
---
I feel the same, once I finish my dailys I'm just like "well... Now what?" Maybe I'll launch a nuke or redo my camp, but once I finish my dailys I usually log off because I don't know what to do anymore
---
Yeah it'll be available each time you rank up
---
Agree, agree, if the official channels for complaints were any good. 
---
Bethesda mods do read this reddit sub and answer things occasionally.
---
Have you tried contacting support before? Its a maze of navigating pages asking you if their proposed canned solutions work.
---
Then at some point you click the right combo of selections and they open a ticket, usually resulting in another canned response. You then have to go do a bit of back and forth before hopefully you get a real answer
---
 
---
I still don't have a response for the ticket I filed re: twitch prime goodies from months ago.
---
I say during an event, if your screen saver kicks in (the spin camera), you are AFK. If that spin camera kicks in, you should be kicked from the event in 30sec.
---
Already prepared and cooked food from using items like the rolling pin, meat cleaver, and knives among other things would be awesome.
---
You pick whatever team you want a bonus from then pretty much go off and do your own thing. Only time you'll really be together is if your on an events team doing an event. Most people only join a team for the bonus, whatever that might be.
---
Literally, just, anything, to get rid of them. They simply should not exist, and there's no reason they can't be auto deleted. Fucking 2B2T has better protections against hacked weapons, and it's an Anarchy Minecraft server. It's also why I pointed out it can't be something like "On pickup, scan weapon" because people could crash servers by just dropping and picking up a weapon depending on the type of scan.  
---
There's just too many ways they could fix it, and it would help all aspects of the game, even PvP. I can't count how many PvP fights I've left simply because they have a hacked gun. Even legacies don't usually force me out of a fight because they can be somewhat tanked with the right perks.
---
Strangler and Thorn poison damage was already useless against higher level enemies due to how large their health pools are and the fact that the poison damage is always the same and never scales based on the level and/or health of what you hit with it. They aren't more useless per say since they were already useless in the endgame to begin with. The only time I can see them still being useful is in pvp when someone doesn't have the Funky Duds legendary effect or a full set of +25 poison resist armor since players have far less hp than high level enemies.
---
I'm glad to hear you think it will be a whole new game.  It's exactly what the game needs right now.  Some old players will leave bit I bet a shitton of old players come back again.  There will be new metas
---
Or asking for something.
---
Honestly WasteLad is really fun imo, it is so neat how Bethesda actually coded a fully functional RPG in an RPG.
---
I'm not in PTS.  But it seems to ke like it should multiply bonuses by 2.  If bonuses are 500 and base is 100, it seems like the total should be 1100.
---
Thunder mountain seems to always be available when I'm on public servers.  Just take the workshop and power up the plant.  The fusion core generator makes one like every 10 minutes?  Maybe more?  Don't know the frequency exactly.
---
for fucks sakes, it is math. It can be anything. This is not a godsend. Guess what, they could change the numbers? Or do you think computers add better than multiply?
---
I like to throw them off the roof of my camp and have a "light show"
---
I shared that once but couldn't tell if the effect actually worked when I shared it. lvl 1 card for clarification. If it works guess I'll use what charisma I have to share it again since I picked up speed demon.
---
And no, danse was not always a synth. He joined the brotherhood as a kid, and synths don’t age. Meaning he was replaced sometime between joining the brotherhood and when we meet him
---
I use it. But it does take weight and i try to remember to clear that as well as ores from my pockets when i can.
---
You mean 1000, not 1100?
---
They won't. 
---
If public servers have exploits, you'll be pushed to 1st servers.
---
If you want to exploit, why not use a private world? 
---
$$
---
Good thing I have enough bullets to kill entire species with lead poisoning.
---
You get nothing lol
---
There is nothing more annoying then picking up scrap, killing a legendary bot, then dying to the explosion for some cuck to steal your loot.
---
Saving Perk points is pointless up until level 50. New perks don't show up until you start spending them b/c you're SPECIAL is 1.    
---
There are many types of builds and my main is 104. Stealth Sniper VATS. I rarely solo until Seasons started and then spent most of that doing my own thing. Your gear, playstyle, and Special is what makes you the most effective, IMO.
---
They're talking about the upcoming legendary perk system not the legendary run. Currently it's planned implementation is extremely poor for a number of reasons
---
1) Regular perk cards are turned in for points, but Long term players have lost cards as the game used to only allow one duplicate card and turfed any additional ones.
---
2) Anyone that has moved perk points around has lost those points.
---
3) Anyone that utilizes multiple loadouts is losing out on possible points.
---
4) The amount of levels required to fully level up cards are redonulous and completely unreasonable for all but the most devoted players. Especially as card levels are not shared between characters.
---
Yes
---
They promised they would change it. Last year. Their words are meaningless.
---
15% exp bonus and +2 to all stats with inspirational and herd mentality, so pretty awesome effects
---
I have not, and will not ever complete one single NW task. Ever. Fuck Beth for ever trying to force that pile of PC steaming feces on anyone.
---
No.  I mean 1100.  Because 100 + (500×2) = 1100.
---
If you take no rewards that gives the most rep
---
Made a new account? It’s 21 days old. The only sensitive person here is you, since you need to snitch on people using something that doesn’t affect you or your gameplay in anyway, and then post here for validation. You’re pathetic.
---
Give us bullion upgrades or allow us to use Scrip to buy upgrade kits or something from Mama Murm. I am running through 5.56 faster than Taylor Swift does men.
---
Yeah the ammo production one looks really nice to have.
---
The first thing I got was the SS Underarmor. I managed to get the mats to make and add the Shielded Lining which is the best mod. No SS armor yet. I got the Chemist backpack mod and now have 800+ that I'm saving to get the Ammo Maker. The final rep level for the Raiders is ANNOYINGLY slow and too high.
---
That's by design, you're not intended to get them all, they're supposed to be ultra rare and a ton of work since they are account wide. 
---
Also people seem to forget that being account wide those thousands of levels don't need to be all on the same original character. 
---
Many people can get to lvl 50 in a day on a new rolled character. 
---
Even if it 4000 levels, someone who wanted to focus on this could theoretically unlock it in 80 days. Which is pretty aligned with basic wastelanders level gold grind although a more annoying one imo. 
---
I wouldn't do it, but there's min maxers that definitely would.
---
They promised they would change it last year. They don't keep their promises.
---
Why would it add 100 and double it? It should only be doing 1 or the other on the pts
---
You’re as pathetic as OP lol
---
Stacks the effect faster id imagine
---
And a hearty supply of milksteaks.
---
Thank you!! I would have missed it without your post! 😊
---
100 base plus 500 mod times 2 for instigating.  Like I said, I'm not on PTS, this is just a guess.
---
Cooperative to Ally? Ya i would like to kno too lol
---
I’m not there yet, though I will say I find it understandable how someone could be feeling that way. However, even though I don’t find myself to that point yet, your suggestions still seem like they would be improvements to me. Daily challenges even if they are easy to complete in relatively normal gameplay can still often be a nuisance. What it I just want to run nothing but SBQ runs that day with some friends. Or spend all day working on a base. And the daily limits are just downright frustrating.
---
I think is funny when we get trailer showing op big weapons being used on giant enemies and yet those weapons ain't shit compared to a bloody pistol with the right building ( at least since last time I played)
---
Currently the only auto-complete that is being reported is visual only, meaning it doesn't look like you got the points but if you do the math, it adds up. 
---
Otherwise maybe you found a new issue
---
that kind of makes sense. I have seen tons of vendors with max caps for mundane items.
---
The cheaters are one thing. The grind of NW though is part of it, and what makes it fun... you know what they call challenging. The more you put into it the more you get out, and its part of what make this game THIS game. I bounce around with lower levels all the time heck my "highest" is almost a 40. I don't know, I enjoy the fact of maybe getting 2-4 slow kills at best over a match, and I hide till the end to try and clear house. But I have my drop spots, and places to hide. I "always" last till the top 10. Also being the lower level it adds even more difficulty, but I normally have good guns so it kind of levels out. I have only finished six time with teams mates till the end, and I have won solo twice. Makes those victory's mean a little more.
---
2 shot doubles the chance to freeze. Also rapidly boosts damage on heavy weapons due to their base damage. The two shot effect is quite effective, it just doesn’t seem so if you may happen to play an optimized build. I personally run a two shot combat rifle as a sniper in vats due to how the accuracy is calculated, and crits become quite powerful.
---
Why do I need 3 sets of maxed domedary though?
---
Please.
---
One of the things turning me off this game is the ever present level 8 billion player with a gauss shotgun that vaporizes the legendaries the second they spawn
---
Use in VATS with a crit to watch the bolt chase the queen until it slows down
---
Yes! Flamer-cooked rad roaches for that crispy, must have late night snack that gets you home safely after a long day in the wasteland.
---
I'm the opposite. I prefer to play in chunks every so often. I'll play 5 hours or so every 4 or 5 days. Knowing I'm losing out to FOMO and daily score grind because I don't log in each day to grind sucks.
---
It does. All heavy guns perks effect it as well as the fat man and AGL. They just use demo expert so they don’t do 120% damage.
---
Choose the option of "donate reward to foundation" or "it's on the house" for vacuum tubes, those give no cap rewards and increased rep. And I think "Appalachia has a new corpse" for Rocksy but she still gives caps.
---
And never give Davenport the pics, deliver them to the opposite faction, you'll gain reputation, and choose the give them for free or whatever option (can't remember the exact dialogue choices) for max reputation.
---
Still doesn’t make any sense. There’s no reason it would double the damage like it’s supposed to and then add the base damage on top
---
My heart dropped lol
---
Not thousands
---
Steel and glass are very common. The wiki lists a lot of info on the Junk. Some items are only needed for CAMP building and early on I wouldn't bother with them. Early on you can pick up/crap/bulk a lot of stuff. Vendors only buy bulk scrap.    
---
Wood is always needed for CAMP repairs, wood armor, and repairing most if not all plants that are destroyed. It's also used in Cooking. With 76 at some point you'll run out and going on Junk runs is a part of it.
---
I claim workshops only to kill foodbuilds. Nothing more. I catch ya in a workshop I will mow ya down n laugh
---
I’m seeing (PS4) a lot of glitched/duped  (whatever it is it’s an exploit) ammunition factories right out in the open in camps. Not even hiding them inside a structure. And their vending machines will have ridiculous amounts of ammo for sale. Probably at 5 caps a pop too.
---
Kevduit... is that you?
---
It took me a month to do settlers from cautious to ally But I just did photo opportunity and vital equipment. You could cut that time down by farming the random encounters, but I didn’t have the patience for that.
---
Edit: sorry I didn’t understand the last part. just to do one whole tier, probably a week or two.
---
Yup, you get nothing, once you complete it you will still be getting score daily challenges that reward you... nothing. I doubt bethesda would implement it so the excess score goes for the next season, it could be unfair for those behind.
---
It doesn’t make it unplayable for low levels. In fact they’re getting hit the least by it. They’ve only got 1 or 2 things boosting their damage, compared to high levels 3+. It’s reducing their damage by 10% at the most
---
Instigating is a 200% damage multiplier, but also a mod... but it specifically says it does double damage.  So, IDK.
---
I see your point but with it I can stash infinite amounts of acid and cloth, which is the same thing just adding an annoying extra step
---
Yeah i wish Bethesda had made them sticky or contact grenades. As bouncy as they are they're pointless.
---
My only real issue is the giant shaft melee is getting. It’s been getting worse with tank enemies to deal with ranged and swarms, and high damage is needed to keep it usable. 
---
Plan on sticking it out though.
---
Every synth was always a synth...
---
You might mean synths replaced certain exisiting or existed ppl.
---
But we never get to see the "real" Danse or Nick.
---
Those two in particular were allowed to have their memories. Which of course because the institute wanted more Intel on the Brotherhood. Some still don't know like magnolia or surges. The crazy thing is when the railroad thinks that's they had eyes on us since the beginning with deacon, the institute has had eyes on all of us. 
---
The mayor watch us in diamond city.
---
Danse without even realizing was sending the Institute the info they needed.
---
Magnolia watching at good neighbor.
---
The "trapped" synth decoy when we get a courser chip.
---
Even struges watching what we would do in sanctuary.
---
Though they may not even have any clue about it, that's exactly how the Institute wanted it. Since we'll, they have no contacts up above.
---
The Institute wasn't trying to destroy humanity but "kidnapping ppl" they were examining how to improve it.
---
Hints the whole "Mankind redefined". There were tyrants that thought there why was the only way. Like the ignorant BoS or Clueless Railroad. But the railroad honestly shouldn't have gotten involved and the brotherhoods best choice was to destroy the institute by any means necessary, which cause massive casualties of their faction and the entire commonwealth. That's not how to make progress. That makes the problems even worse.
---
The Institute is creepy as our synths may seem, we're improving the commonwealth and had to realize how terrible is it was above ground.
---
The captain at far harbor and the trader are synths and yes the captain was replaced and killed by Nicks "brother" Dema. Though I am with the institute, I do not agree with what Dema did to the captain and he was forced execution in front of the entire far harbor.
---
(an actual choice to do in game). We will not let our synths that have gone haywire cause issues up above and if so, they will be eliminated or memory wiped thanks to our corsers.
---
Yay my main is a tesla medic with solar armor. I look forward to helping folks.
---
If you’ve been keeping up with the PTS Patch 22 is looking to be really good. Maybe take a break for a month and get back into it with the new DLC in September!
---
you realize it is "reunite the wasteland" and not "make sure no one gets loot " right?
---
Genes
---
Do you get to choose these cards or are they going to be random? My main is 104 and I don't use melee at all or PA.
---
Train the kids to grind your rewards. I am.
---
Which only serves to make me lose all interest in the system.
---
I don't mind having to put in some more work, but they're making it unreasonable to achieve anything beyond the base cards, and implementing it in such a way that punishes me for having made multiple characters, punishes me for having played since the beginning, punishes me for using multiple perk loadouts, and punishes me for having moved some perk points around. 
---
If the goal is to provide encouragement for continued player engagement, they've failed for all but a small subset of the playerbase (That, all things being equal, likely would be the people sticking around regardless). I shouldn't be writing the entire system off before it's even released.
---
So no caps = more reputation, got it! Ty
---
Most players that play hardcore bloodied builds have been overpowered since they finalized their gear and perks. IMO, it shouldn’t be free for the players who’ve been on the top of the food chain for so long to get a free opportunity to switch to a normal build. Besides, you can theoretically play a completely new character by level 150, so it’s not like it’s unbalanced. It’s just a gradual change into a new play style
---
i never even saw the sloth
---
Thank you so, so much! 🤗💙
---
My first thought was "I agree" but then I realised that more people having access to more legendaries will make the problem worse, not better.
---
It pains me to say it, but maybe the only real solution is a "season 2" where we all get effectively reset to a baseline level, like destiny has done.
---
That'll never happen though. The community would be too outraged.
---
Now I've learned some interesting things about knives/daggers. My experience has only really been in the kitchen, I have yet to try and stab someone IRL. Thanks for the info guys.
---
Truly, there are some old strength-based carnival games that are lore friendly that can be camp items. Also the new shooting galleries do not allow for this feature - which I was hoping for a bit. You know those things you punch at an arcade and it tells you how hard? That could be fun. New Mr. Fuzzy grind camp item!!!!
---
All of mine autocompleted except for the NW one. I did level up but didn't get any S.C.O.R.E. for it. I've lost 4000 points so far over 2 days. I sure would like to know why it happens.
---
Thanks my user name is OGak#6368
---
Basically against the queen though, my Fatman can one hit kill most things, as a bloodied fat man, but the queen, 1 damage.
---
This is big lame
---
This. Same worked for me.
---
And then there's my experience, doing Line in the Sand and finding the most toxic shits in the wasteland, using hacked weapons and inciting PvP while calling names for simply not wanting to engage in it  
---
Did get a bugged junk item out of it though
---
I'm not on the PTS but have noticed that in adventure mode my instigating rifle sometimes does not register double damage on full health enemies, I'm thinking it's been recently bugged coz it's only happened in the last few weeks.
---
Idk, my bloodied Fatman (before I realized that Fatman is bad against the queen) it was killing most things pretty damn goood but the queen was giving me 1 damage and I was like wow, this is terrible
---
If you're at an event, then all you needed to do was turn on passive, you can't shoot them, and they can't shoot you.
---
Absolutely 100% agree. This is not the place to make bug reports for live or PTS.
---
99% of anything people post here will be missed by bethesda, unless it is upvoted very high.
---
Just complete fast events and claim workshops. Any horde event, stuff like fly swatter, defend event and public event is one you should go to for fast exp and leggys
---
Well your first few lines are already wrong, I don’t feel like reading the rest so I don’t know about that. Danse was labeled in the database as gone rogue or whatever. If he was gathering intel on us and the institute was watching through him to spy on us, they have enough intel to figure out where he is, and then retrieve him. They have enough firepower and the smarts to eliminate or steal him back him if he’s on a mission with just a few other people. Any synth out in the wild, especially a missing synth, could compromise the institutes safety and secrecy
---
They can't though?
---
Takes about 20 days to do the last rank if you do the daily and sell them the pics.
---
Yeah no I'm not spending 9 perk point just to get 30 extra dmg per shot on my bloodied combat rifle.
---
Well its not an mmo so.....
---
you mean like mini nuke zones where they land for a min? with a small earth shattering ka-boom?
---
FO1 and 2 on the pipboy???
---
I think the issue is one of access.
---
I think all players need to start with access to all of the core weapon damage boosting perks. So commando, heavy gunner, demo expert, shotgunner, ect. 
---
Not having any way to build your weapon preference at 0 is terrible, if everyone could at least run whatever damage perk suits them then the secondary damage perks (things like ap, range, radius, ect) would only be adding icing to the cake.
---
Maybe there needs to be a shift in power distribution, 100:40 as stands currently to something more equitable, 115:25, but I am personally fine where it is.
---
use those charisma perkes to boost damage when revived to get the bloodied moving again. Team time for sure
---
You do some damage when you first attack someone right?  Or is it now no damage?
---
They can shoot you though.
---
I'll probably make it, at like level 87 now in the season pass, but I don't think I'll be repeating this anymore.  Again, there are only a few items that I actually want in season 2, like this season.  The rest is shite filler, like stimpacks, rad-x, and scrap kits that they can't even give away, just like the 'rewards' for the Atlas event. Caps and bullion and scrip are also just insulting, when most players have what they need and are sitting at the max limits.  Hell, they're even replacing rewards with nukashine now, that sells for 1 cap.  No thanks, Bethy...
---
That would be a pretty creative way to do it actually, use a melee weapon on this object to determine the damage output, use the gun game with a, gun, or even see how much damage you can take with... something.
---
Not to worry, soon you will have more action than you can handle. The update is gnarly
---
Is there a bug with the raiders dailies?
---
The first week or so I would get both at once, or was I not supposed to?
---
Always share rank 1 of serendipity or action boy in case someone isn’t running it
---
Captain noob was live yesterday testing the new nerf and he stated that there's really no point in builds anymore
---
If you had an issue with twitch prime loot thats an issue to bring up with twitch, Bethesda's support would have been less able to deal with that than any problem.
---
Just too what ff14 does . . Training dummies are extremely useful in there for rotation and just learning a move in general
---
You only get one a day.
---
It won't do anything if you're in Passive, unless you go to a workshop, PvP is completely disabled for you in Passive
---
No, it’s just there for emergencies
---
You're not supposed to kill the cows. And usually the sheepsquatch spawns as a 3-star legendary.
---
You have to be under 30 years old, I remember car phones and only millionaires had those, us po folks had beepers. Now I have a computer jn my pocket that can call people.
---
You need to have all 3 cows alive to get a random sheepsquatch weapon plan reward, which is guaranteed in such case. If any of the cows die you only get the mutton pie recipe.
---
Yea, just in general, anything to test real damage output reliably would be great. Sheet damage only shows your pure damage, and sometimes the floating numbers are inaccurate, gotta have something that shows raw data.
---
Some probably are exploiters since awhile back there was some kind of trap disarm bug that let you disarm it as many times as you like and people ended up with tons of XP and junk from disarming them. I remember coming across a bag of 80k junk total beside a trap and was confused at first until I heard the news. Plus a  recent godmode glitch that (I think) got patched.
---
Some people are legit 1000 or higher, not sure where they get that determination to keep playing from but props non the less.
---
Today and for the first time, everything was auto-completed except for the NW challenge.  I did get it done, and got killed right after I opened it.  So, I guess I got lucky to get 250 Score points instead of zero for the day.
---
I dont think its a matter of they can't, i think its a matter that they are too lazy, there are plenty of things that they can do, but it seems like they choose not to do them, ie, the fact that they still haven't fixed the fast travel bug even though they experienced it during the colossal problem showcase
---
You only need to hit level 400 (I think it's 400, maybe 300?) on a single character.  That should unlock the slots for all.  Just have to level the perks on individual.  It's what would be expected in any mmo.  A few cards is leveled is what's expected but if someone wants to grind more then they can still be rewarded for it.  It's a system that rewards those players who put another 1000 hours in the game.  
---
As for previous level spending, who knows?  That's something that is going to effect literally everyone.  A complete respec and restore of points would probably be the fairest method, but I don't expect it.
---
I actually didn't know that.  I was told you do reduced damage.  So, to recap, if you are in pacifist mode, the only time you can die is in a workshop?
---
I’d love to have his problem of being gifted with free ammo machines, lol.
---
Just east of Foundation in the mountains,  didn't know that's where they would eventually locate to.
---
Time to increase ammo and weight for all this raiding where all going to be doing make sense right stash box carrying weight ammo capacity??? Ill rebuild the game if you want
---
There is a challenge for one of the possum badges that involves killing a certain number of enemies with the Fatman. It's arguably faster to complete this challenge by bashing enemies with the Fatman as opposed to actually launching mini nukes from it.
---
About 20 to 30 days others replied.

“Beam splitter 50.cal”

Hol the fuck up
---
But will it be fill with bugs that prevent me from receiving loot after a frustrating, and boring fight?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Will it be one obnoxious encounter after another to grind RNG or is there a path toward a goal, some level of sanity that isnt totally random and ultimately worthless?
---
Something that makes eggs so I can make those donuts!
---
It's the reason I bought the targeting posters recently cause I thought they would do that. Cause i shot them at someone's base and I saw numbers

Been really wanting to make a mannequin themed haunted house.

Some concepts I sketched up...

Ah. I really wanted to make a Chernobyl reference here but I'm too tired so I'll just go with ol faithful. 
---
"3.6 roentgen not great, not terrible"
---
Imo they need to have coins drop from events and stuff to make them a more consistent grind. Even with all the XP bonuses and the bugged out Line in the Sand event I'm only at lvl 297, and i've been playing since, well just before wastelanders almost non stop. I don't have a wife or a job, which means even if you were to do that, you still wouldn't be able to grind out these cards in any reasonable time frame
---
As hot as an atom bomb baby?
---
Strangler was weak before it got nerfed in PvP if you had one piece of poison resist armor. I regularly fought people with it on two characters and only ran a single piece and it made a massive difference in survivability versus my PA PvP build.
---
Yep my gauntlets are doing literally 80% less damage. I do more damage with a gauss shotgun that I'm not specced for than a gauntlet I have 9 perks invested in. Unarmed has been hit especially hard.
---
Well shit, I had no idea it existed. Guess all 5 of my characters need to head to Fort Defiance.
---
I am not sure if this is sarcasm or not, so to be clear: Charisma builds will be useful in groups, for the group as a whole, not for your DPS.
---
Ye there’s not a lack of variety of things to do but when everything is constrained to a daily limit I think that’s why it becomes a chore. For example if I could just log on on Tuesday for example and get 1000 weekly scrip from the Purveyor that would make that grind 10* more satisfying.
---
Old PvP had some "slap damage" which they removed a bit back, now they have Pacifist mode in the settings which completely disables it for you outside of workshops. Slap damage isn't even a thing anymore, though it may sound like it, and drain AP with Dodgy, it's always 0s until the other side fights back.
---
The way the camera looked around as you fell so fast was hilarious 
---
Luckily you were wear PA
---
I want to make solar armor and do a medic build, but that's a LOT of bullion.
---
Yeah, but it makes you feel better to turn the tables on them now and then, and there's nothing they can really do about it.
---
I guess what we’re seeing here is preference, which is great and all but it would be so cool if they did give us dailies but they never expired, so if I missed yesterday’s I could do them today for example. Just the option would be nice really :)
---
Yea I knew they wouldn't have the foresight to bother making that a feature for them. Regardless, as it is now, shooting camp objects doesn't even show true damage from what I can tell. Same with sandbags and petrified corpses like people suggest.
---
My Bloodied The Dragon says it does from 1000 to 1499 damage but when I shoot a sandbag with it I get 32
---
To be fair the 250 from NW isn’t really necessary but I feel you, at first I was having that issue but I just stopped doing the challenge. 
---
I think next season they need to make the challenges persistent in some way. I know people enjoy the daily loop but they can give the daily loop without making it so if you don’t log on 1 day youve missed a day of challenges. 
---
Call of Duty does it good (I don’t like the game just the way they do their challenge system) where they give you a load of weekly and overall challenges and you can do week 1 and week 2 whenever you want, you could literally do all the challenges in the last couple of weeks if you *really* wanted to. It’s great.
---
I just did this event for the first time today. I just activated a pylon and healed a player when they killed sheepsquatch, and didn't see where it happened. I spent the next several minutes hunting around for the corpse to no avail. Some people even tried to lead us (there were a few of us who missed it) to the spot, but there was nothing there.
---
That was kind of a bummer. Teaches me for trying to not be selfish. Next time I'm following that damn squatch like flies on shit, screw the pylons!
---
This is a reactionary post, just chill and calm down. A bad experience(s) are bound to happen and you are just venting here for now, but you will be fine buddy.
---
Yes. They're called calibrated shocks.
---
Because Bethesda has ignored most of their bug reports previously.
---
They've said they couldn't get *LADDERS* working in their engine, I wouldn't be surprised
---
Ye it isn’t really like its a big ask either really, the fomo effect just seems really cheap to me. like imagine if they just gave you challenges every week and you could do week 1’s challenges for example at week 8. Or you could just let all of them build up and go on a fallout 76 binge in the last week. You’re putting the same amount of time in to get it all done, you’re just distributing the time differently so it suits your style. Options is the key word.
---
I am become Peace Turtles, the destroyer of griefers.
---
Ghoul slayer’s gamma gun
---
Yeah I take it way more personally than I know I should lol. I just want to make friends :(
---
I believe it's only 300 to unlock the slots (which I already have achieved).
---
My point is merely that at a certain point the time investment becomes so high that instead of encouraging further play to upgrade the cards, it just encourages players to give up on the system. This means that the system fails to increase player engagement, and instead is delegated to the background and only achieved as a happy accident as long as other content manages to maintain engagement.
---
I've played a not insignificant amount of time, but it would still take me another 4ish years to max out a single set of cards at my current rate of play. 6ish years is pretty unreasonable to me, even for an MMO-*lite*.
---
New Vegas doesn't encourage early game exploring either. Go north from goodsprings and get wrecked immediately by cazadores or radscorpions. Late game exploring is also hampered by invisible walls.
---
Ye I probably will, then again i’m really excited for the Avengers game, played the beta and really enjoyed it but then i saw they have dailies aswell.
---
*sigh* ahaha
---
Haha is that what the person you got them from told you?
---
Nah, there's a hacked weapon that says on the sheet it does around 2000 energy damage. You can actually see visually if it's the hacked one because it doesn't have the rear grip, just a nub that they don't even hold. the foregrip is also usually outside of the hand as well. Very easily distinguishable
---
Bullshit. Super duper never worked on legendary items. It makes the sound but doesn't produce any extra.
---
also, the animation for blocking (with unarmed at least) is different in first person than in third person. in first person feel like wolverine, in third person, not so much.
---
I found a good test area for me personally is the golf course club house for ghouls. And then near solomans pond testing on the behemoth. But then again damage is very odd. Like example . A kitted out chainsaw on a scorchqueen. Can slowly melt a Queenie better then a minigun( note no big gun perks, or mods,) great for a tank build tho. Cause she focuses melee
---
Cool, now where do I get PA mods with Chemist or Grocers?
---
Looks like you probably are the type of beta male nerd to spend real money for a fallout 76 weapon lol.
---
After playing for a few hours earlier, I noticed something interesting.  Despite having every possible damage boost for rifles, the shishkebab that I carry for event heals does at least twice as much damage.  Aside from bloody mess, I have 0 perks for it and no melee mutations.
---
Depending on the enemy, my bloody Fixer will hit for roughly 200 damage with a chest hit.  The shishkebab, also bloody, easily hits for 500+.
---
WTF?
---
Ye I feel that, and I do like it to an extent but it’s just the time constraint really. Posted it a few times as a reply but I think it would just be way better if you got weekly challenges like week 1, 2, 3 etc up to like 8 and then if you wanted you could keep on top of them every week like you do and I have been doing, or if you wanted to you could wait until week 7 and 8 to go on a 2 week binge of all week 1-8’s challenges, if that makes sense. Player choice etc.
---
When the devs play the actual game for only 1 hour a week because they're required to, its easy for them to not care.
---
It also does 2k energy damage. You can also tell people are using it because it's missing the rear grip and their hand holds onto nothing
---
That's why im saying Increase the difficulty like they are with one wasteland. And see how the weapons fair and adjust from there.
---
Repair kits (edit: the improved ones) can repair a weapon with more than 100% durability as well. I had hoped this was a new feature for repairing in general when I happened to find out and tried repairing a 100% fixed weapon with a normal workbench (to get it up to 200%), but nope. Only repair kits :P They're OP
---
Do you like grinding for gold? If yes, spend away. If no, save it.
---
Junkies is the 2nd most sought after pre-fix it certainly does not 'suck'
---
Yeah, youre right, just really frustrating.
---
The problem with that is all the varying levels and DR ER points. We need something we can choose the stats of for ourselves
---
Think they are gonna be doing another double score soon so hopefully you make it to 85 atleast.
---
That’s the problem though, it’s not the challenges that are the problem really for me, it’s the time gating of them. You should be able to do any weeks challenges on any week. Like the season should just give you week 1- week 8 challenges and they unlock each week to be done, and you could do them at your own pace whether it be on a weekly basis or just binged at the end of the season.
---
Great write up, I'm excited.
---
But you can only use your coins updating the character you earned them on. So it would have to be a permanent move
---
That... I’m speechless.
---
Is there a list of all the hacked weapons? It sounds like someone went all mad scientist on these poor guns
---
There ya go. I tend to just shoot them dead with superior strats and not being a moron. 
---
When they shoot you outside of passive, you get first hit. I tend to wait until they think i'm not interested then shoot them in the back with my Quad fire rate tesla rifle. Stupid amount of damage, not a lot can tank it
---
Yes. Yes they are. In my year of playing I've seen a handful of hacked weps. They need to be removed yes but don't over exaggerate the situation.
---
Actually no, I hardly PvP anymore. And I don’t even care if I die in PvP to someone with a legacy. But why would anyone want to PvP with someone that has a clear advantage because they have gear that’s no longer attainable for other people except through purchasing from dupers.
---
Couldn't have put it better myself mate I notice they have some sort of system in place while in teams so they have a way, just implementing that into people involved in events.
---
You can't. That guy was just being sarcastic and unhelpful. Power armor is woefully pathetic compared to the carry capacity you can reach in normal armor. 100 pounds from calibrated shocks is terrible when a backpack can give 60 pounds plus mods plus strength bonuses from armor. Excavator armor lets you carry more but it's much weaker.
---
Dude, agreed. I know I don’t *HAVE* to play but ... I really want to finish the legendary run.
---
So today, after finally coming home from a COVID-safe wedding and retrieving my car, which my apartment complex had towed from my space for no reason (really — I parked legally, but they gave my space to a new resident and then towed ME), well, I logged in to do my C.H.O.R.E., even though I really didn’t *want* to. 
---
Listen, I love this game. But I don’t love that I have to log in nearly every day just so I can finish the Legendary Run, a bit early like I’m hoping. I’ve seen the suggestion to make the battle pass off of weekly challenges, not dailies, and I would really prefer that, especially for when I stop teleworking and can no longer log in daily.
---
Is it? Or is it with Amazon because they are involved too. What 1/3 portion of responsibility does Beth bear if any? 
---
The issue is I was unable to receive items in fo76, the Bethesda portion, despite *not* having trouble with the steps involving Amazon and Twitch.
---
Edit: I dutifully tried all the solutions available on both public forums and the pages of these three companies. Spent a few hours, then finally gave up as the solutions did not work after repeated attempts where I tried different things to troubleshoot, and decided to figure out how to submit a typed submission to get a ticket.
---
I feel like removing time constraints and limits would actually make me play more. You’d think the limits and time constraints would make me play more but it makes me play less cause of fatigue. The core game is great it’s just the time gating and limits 😕
---
I agree, it's nothing major but it should be on the laundry list of bugs to be fixed when Bethesda can get around to it.
---
It is not related to the photomode but rather the power armor.
---
No.
---
Yep, I know, and the STR from the armor gets lower as your STR increases. Another shit feature for PA users.
---
Ye ima prob take a lil break, thankfully I sweated my ass off to get to rank 100 so i’m good 🤣. Also love the camp building, i’ll probably pop on to just build my camp here n there... although we need a build limit increase for next gen consoles hopefully!
---
I just had this happen to me as well yesterday, once I realized I couldn’t respawn I force quit the game and joined team once I started the game back up, and I still had the flux and could also loot the SBQ, not a perfect solution but it does the trick!
---
Pvp is this game is essentially whoever does real damage first.  No one can tank anything.  I'll just stay in pacifist I guess.
---
How many hours do you have?
---
I agree. It would be extremely helpful.
---
Haha but everyone that has one really believes that it wasn’t a duped one.
---
There's probably one out there, but the most common ones are that, the beam splitter explosive Handmade, which you can easily see the splitter on the end of. A mini nuke shooting minigun, which can crash games and servers sometimes. A Air strike firing minigun, which is similar but somehow less laggy. And """Binoculars""" which is basically a bunch of weapon parts floating infront of the player as they hold their hands up to their eyes like for fun binoculars.
---
But there are so many other types, basically you just need to know what mods can't go on what, like a recon scope and splitter on a minigun, or on a tesla rifle. Or a gun that's generally firing a suspicious amount of rounds. Though that get's sorta confusing with legit Two shot explosive 50.cals and Plasma Gats which are possible, just gotta look closer at them for the screwy mods
---
I had to force quit as well, but didnt have the option to rejoin my team.  
---
Still had my flux though, so at least that is something. Probably got 1 legendary too, but no idea which one it is.
---
Your question was bothering me, so I jumped onto the PTS for a bit.
---
My damage numbers are all over the place.  With a headshot, the Fixer will hit for anywhere between 350-800 per shot.  I was also finding that most times I could kill a lvl 75 ghoul with one hit, but other times I couldn’t.
---
Just out of curiosity, I dug out an old AA/E handmade.  The damage, including the explosion, was slightly less than the bloody fixer.    Maybe 200 versus a bloody fixer doing 250.  Damagewise, they’re much, much closer together than before.
---
It has built in damaged reduction and the best rad reduction, it needs a pay off.
---
I think it could be possible to enjoy the game if you take team play seriously. There will be bugs, and you are actually paying to be gently frustrated. I think playing the different posts adds tension.SPOILERS The new tension seems to be between petrifying aspects of your build for the sake of optimization, or keeping things wide and shallow (as far as min/max QL Crafting). Both approaches are constantly in tension and play off each of the weapon/prefix/build styles differently in regards to teams. The ultimate reward you seek is to play, yes? This provides incentive and new challenges. You may have to rethink your build and everything. Which is great because the new context provides content. For example. you can spend hundreds of levels to upgrade your ammo uptake, or upgrade fire resistance. These aspects become more innate to your build but can be shifted at lower cost than upgrading. I am unsure about significant imminent narrative additions, which seems silly. Voice acting and some writing could really sell these updates. One of the few economies left in pandemic.
---
Yea best you do, but there are still ways to give precious extra seconds. Fireproof is good against explosive weapons, and dodgy turns your AP bar into an extra HP, sorta
---
Just nuke their camps.
---
Troll gotta troll. “I’m not mad, I’m just going to take the time to insult in each of my responses”
---
Either you are mad or desperate for attention. Not sure which is worse lol.
---
It sounds like it courages people to have different specs in the group. In your example, if you had another playing acting as the 'tank' and drawing the agro of those stealth units, you both would have done really well.
---
Start making the game a challenge, put away your god tier stuff and play with good weapons, rather than your best stuff. Guardian Angel a noob.
---
And here my level 201 ass has been selling that stuff off at every opportunity!
---
I down a Scorchbeast in with 2 Mini Nukes.
---
It’s rude....to say he intends to continue playing a game he enjoys?  Lol wut?
---
We need a fatman that You're scared to shoot because of how powerful it is. I want to be a weapon of absolute last resort, It's raw destructive power only overshadowed by its limited range. I want to vaporize workshops and turn enemies into shadows. I want to hold the power of the sun. I also want my auto grenade launcher to do a little bit more damage, plz buff.
---
NOW THIS PERSON KNOWS WHAT IM TALKING BOUT
---
To me it sounds like a nickname for the Bad Sports lobby in GTA Online
---
Honestly man. I've had a friend complain that his weapons aren't doing any damage and if I ask him about his perks I'll find out he has literally 0 weapon perks equipped. There's probably so many people like him out there who can't solve this complex mystery as to why weapons dont work well without their appropraite perks. There's nothing Brthesda can do about that unfortunately.
---
Shame most of what I like is towards the end of the seasons though! that’s how they get ya.
---
Wow, a reasonable response. Unbelievable. Apparently everyone else in the comments is exactly the type of nerd that I was hoping to piss off. I understand your point that a lot of legacies are useless anyway, but if they are going to keep PvP in this game then they should be removed. Period. Either that or rework PvP to where legendary effects aren’t active.
---
They hate PA, so never.
---
It just feels like Bethesda is more interested in creating 50 different shades of grind to keep players logged in than developing interesting, long-lasting story content.
---
I’m sitting at 542 hours, if that’s what ya mean. Unless you mean how many hours do I have for you to tell me about how much of a chore everything is 🤣
---
Sadly, I did nit save it. It was here in reddit.
---
What does it take to get people to understand that ALL DAMAGE HAS BEEN NERFED. It is not just bloodied, it's all prefixes/damage. FFS.
---
EDIT: Also, bye bye.
---
What system are you on? I have some of the plans for the melee weapons and mods. I'll trade them for the throwing plan.
---
It doesn't have the best rad protection, radiation suits do. It shouldn't need a payoff other than being bad at stealth (which it is), it was meant to replace tanks.
---
Is there evidence bloodied is getting a nerf?
---
Sounds fine by me. If they add those exclusive skins and stuff into the atomic shop or something I will be pissed considering the work/atoms you have to put in. But utility items is fine by me
---
Special points from the main game limiting what cards you can use is a big problem too.
---
"yet"
---
Ye I could definitely make it more fun for myself but when there’s a cool golden ticket item at the end of a 100 tier battlepass and I have to **mostly** play every day to just about make it to the end then it’s a chore. I get fomo with shit like that. Like I really do love this game but I want to play 8 hours 1 day and not play for a few days etc like I want option, not obligation.
---
This. It’s got 2 main quest lines (the second of which was added for free) with a third (also free) on the way. If you have 400+ hours in it and are complaining its boring idk what to tell you. If you put 400+ hours into something and say its boring that says a lot more about you than the game.
---
Keep a eye out for October, those are from the Halloween event.
---
It wont hit you as hard then
---
I’m 800 overweight soooo
---
Please
---
“I bought the last ten levels to get out of the grind”...
---
I mean that’s the exactly what the battlepass/seasons model is all about. It’s literally why the game mechanic is so popular. Jus sayin.
---
Exactly. You put it perfect with the C.H.O.R.E 🤣.
---
I’m really not sure why bethesda insist on you logging in daily, then again...
---
**atom shop refresh**
---
This game isn’t worth getting angry over lol. I’m just stating facts that are hard for some people to hear apparently. If you don’t believe that the majority of players still playing this game only play because there’s a shit ton of exploits then you’re wrong. Can you imagine the backlash if a game like Call Of Duty releases an AK47 that shot explosive laser bullets and then said it was too OP so they stopped people from unlocking it but didn’t remove it for everyone? The game would be dead after that.
---
this people don't invest points into intelect and perception so they can't  understand that
---
Ok, so you’ve played the game for more than 22 days. Of course it’s a chore.
---
Who walks around in a radsuit besides during nuke zones? Oblivious we are talking about everyday use.
---
Throw on emergency protocols, even if you aren't bloodied you're pretty unstoppable, no Stimpak animation, no fall damage, built in damage reduction, best DR and ER without needing perks or mods. 
---
Sounds like it's got more pros than
---
 cons.
---
Well ye if they wanted me to feel fed up of the loop by the end of it then they executed it perfectly.
---
I don’t like the game but Call of Duty does it perfectly. From what I remember, they give you weekly challenges (and dailies but they ain’t necessary). You could hoard all the weekly challenges until the last few weeks if you wanted to, you ain’t forced to play every day or week (I ain’t forced with fallout either but yano with FOMO you basically are).
---
lol even the Scripbeast Queen is just a one star melee dealer
---
Are you trying to complete it in a month?
---
Nah to much work- Bethesda Devs
---
Why Care about Hacker guns. They Don t Change the gameplay for you. So why care
---
Sorry mate already used it
---
He has had it maybe 5 out of 200 times I've checked him.
---
We kept them all alive and I got the Shepard's crook mod
---
why?
---
I wasn’t saying I used it to get my 2mm ammo, I’m just telling OP to use it when he crafts the gatling laser....
---
I know its cause I got 2/3 cows killed and I got the rarest plan, but I keep them all alive and I get a pie recipe
---
Yes tons. As of now the game takes your buffs and multiples it over an over with other buffs using the base damage. In the public test server on pc going on now, they took the buffs and added them together and then multiplied it by the base damage. That decreases the overall damage on all weapons in the game. Perk cards also don't give a as big of a boost in damage anymore. Bloodied unarmed got hit the hardest compared to anything else.
---
At no point did I say I haven’t got my fill out of the game. Hell this has been the best investment of £40 ever if we look at it that way.
---
I’m saying why do I have to do my chores every day to get a cool outfit at the end when I should be able to grind for 8 hours on 1 day as opposed to an hour a day. Like ye sure some people don’t mind coming on daily and that could still be an option.
---
Basically what i’m saying is let’s call you Bob and i’m Jon. (guessing your name is Bob).
---
Bob wants to play 1 hour a day for 7 days a week, this allows him to be on track to finish the season.
---
Jon doesn’t want to play for all 7 days of the week, but if Jon puts the same amount of time in (7 hours) in 1 day as Bob puts in across 7 days (1 hour a day) its the same amount of time invested and we are both happy and are both enjoying the grind.
---
👍
---
So, basically, in this legendary perk system, one star on a card is 2 points. You can equip the first levels for free, then must spend to upgrade. Going from 1 to 2 takes 100 points, or about 38 levels (including card packs). 2-3 takes 150 points (55 levels, all cards and packs). And so on. In short, it's another long grind, more so seeing as you either make a new character and level slowly (and shred only spare cards), or you keep to your main and level slowly (because of increasing XP xost).
---
I suspect the reason people arn't thrilled with the system is not because the ideas are bad, but because they are not worth the time and effort needed to use them. Although I will say, the ammo crafting one at any level is wonderful to behold.
---
EDIT: oh, and it's by character. Ranking up one character's perks does not rank up another's. So it's very much a "focus on one char and get them 1000+ levels to get a significant increase" thing.
---
Sometimes you have to do a bit of server hopping to get plans to show up. Spent an hour yesterday trying to get the white locker.
---
So I've been going back and forth on this. I get about 700-900 damage on melee when sneaking. I have a two shot LMG that when fired correctly (meaning short burst otherwise I get rubber banding) pretty much destroys anything quickly. Even though it takes more time with the melee (a few hits with a medium, attack speed increase deathblow guantlet) I still use it because otherwise churn through ammo too fast. Playing for a day with non melee weapons I always go back to melee because ranged weapons eat too much ammo and if the rebalancing means everything is a bullet sponge we might see more investment in melee, just a thought. I don't play PTS, so I couldn't say for sure.
---
For what it's worth that throwing weapon seems to be a lot rarer than the other weapon plans. I've gotten duplicates of nearly all of them and only a single copy of the thrown one.
---
An ounce of prevention is still bugged on PS4 and Key to the past is bugged on Xbox. 
---
AOOP: I dropped the blood sample in and put in the T fuse. I go to the computer to analyze the blood sample and get an error message saying there is no sample available. 
---
KTTP: I found and picked up the diehards holotape to make a copy of it. It’s nowhere to be found in my inventory. I go to the terminal to load up the holotape and noting is there
---
But, every thread and every post in this subreddit is full of complaints... if you institute this rule, the subreddit would be empty...
---
Do note that (as far as I have seen personally) repair perks do not affect repair kits - you wont be able to extend the amount of repair meter they grant with perks like Fix It Good or Weapon Artisan.
---
The grind though. You guys grind in a video game and think it’s crazy that you’re burned out. It’s meant to be a fun escape, not a second job. If something is tedious and boring don’t do it. So you don’t get an outfit or gun skin? Who cares? Would you have used it? Probably not. If you wanted to use it the grind would be worth it.
---
I’ll keep an eye out next time I do a nuke run and notice her melt faster than normal :)
---
\^ Found a guy with hacked guns
---
Ladders don't work (hell, they don't even exist in Skyrim or fallout 3) in Skyrim or any Bethesda fallout for this reason either
---
Wow, like literally fell? 
---
Something like that happened to me at Morgantown High School. I went to hide in a doorway and glitched into what looked like an area clear of buildings and trees, just grassy empty hills.
---
bro they always try to rationalize it. I can also guarantee you that dude uses those guns.
---
I think you’re missing the point. Imagine not thinking it would be a better idea to have the option to put 7 hours in on 1 day or 7 hours across 7 days and come to the same level in the season. Options are nice to have, and FOMO is a real thing. It’s easy to say “don’t do it” but when they put the coolest items in the game at the end of a piss poor challenge system 🤷🏼‍♂️. 
---
Agree to disagree I guess.
---
Haha, I’ll confess I got C.H.O.R.E from someone else on this subreddit lol ... which was then followed up with something better — S.N.O.R.E.
---
Yeahh. “Follow the money.” And it’s terribly sad for me to see a Fallout game just degrade itself into this money-grabbing enterprise. Honestly? I’m starting to miss the early days of 76, somehow.
---
Maybe if enough of us submit feedback, they’ll make a battle pass that you can complete without having to devote time to it every damn day. I feel like a slave to the Legendary Run haha.
---
This reminds me of when I was new to the game (which is now a long time ago), I didn't even know it was possible to repair my stuff at a workbench. I just thought I had to use repair kits every time. So I wasted my first few earned atoms on repair kits until I realized that I don't really need them.
---
My solution removes the need to server hop.
---
My solution keeps someone from surprise killing you if you don't want to PVP.
---
A better in current game solution is just to point six turrets the workstation. So that it'll go aggro the instant the person clicks the button.
---
But that all gets tedious. It doesn't service anybody and it doesn't improve the game.
---
Making the opt-out actually opt you out of PVP serves everybody's interests.
---
how? I thought I had made that pretty clear.
---
The people who opt out are opted out, but the PVPers can take away their work stations with impunity.
---
The people who stay opted in experience no change in their workstation behavior It's somebody else tries to take their workstation.
---
And if someone takes your workstation while you're opted out, you can opt right back in and try to take the workstation back again. The risk of having to lose the home court advantage if you decide to fight back is the cost of opting out.
---
No one has to server hop.
---
But more importantly someone with a 5 to 10 times level and experience advantage does not get to poach and ruin the experience of lower level players.
---
I don't know why this idea, this incredibly simple idea, is either hard to understand or so objectionable. The only people who can object really are the intended poachers. And yes every community has those.
---
But every objection I read on here so far is "It's not fair that I wouldn't get to poach on the noobs". Or I guess "foodies" Is the tent trendy dismissive term used.
---
God forbid the game were fair. That would take all the fun out of it for the griefers.
---
No it doesn’t. I put around 100-150 UGL shots in to her (Vampire) to help with tanking her.
---
I get the feeling that Perk Coins will end up being rewards from the Legendary Run.  That's why the trade-in value on Perk Cards is so low.
---
ALL DAMAGE has been nerfed on PTS. By changing how damage is calculated. It used to be multiplicative but it is now additive. This means that ALL DAMAGE, be that bloodied or nocturnal has been nerfed roughly 30% (my personal estimate while playing on PTS, i could be wrong).
---
Yep, their engine straight up can't support fucking ladders.
---
Us melee/shotgun users would like to help take her out faster if she gets frozen *after landing*, saving the rest of you ammo. I do bring a gun mind you, but simply to tag if people wanna keep her in the air.
---
Yes, it is.  Twitch drops are handled by Twitch, if you try to contact Bethesda at BEST they might be able to verify on their side whether or not you have an account linked to Twitch and even that's a stretch.  Even if they had the ability to give you access to the items they DEFINITELY can't confirm whether your twitch account is Prime.  That's why you have to go through Twitch.
---
I wish Enforcer worked at least sometimes on Scorchbeasts, maybe just to knock them down prematurely with a reduced chance. Once on the ground, my shotgun can eat them up fairly well, and they don't hurt me much, but in the air it's just a dumb waiting game.
---
Dude you cant argue with these people. The level of mental gymnastics they use is second to none. Just let him have his hacked guns, he will get banned at some point.
---
you're gonna take that nocturnal rolling pin and you're gonna like it!!! 😡
---
Ngl I'm surprised the engine can support anything at all. The things modders and obsidian managed (and still manage) to do with it is pretty amazing
---
Not like Bethesda will do anything about it. If they would no one would have them anymore. They won't even tell you if your report got to them, let alone lead to a ban or weapon removal.
---
Haha there’s so many downsides we take what we can get
---
I mean, that's up to your build.
---
Both would be scrip fodder for me, but the broadsider is kinda trash at any level.
---
If youre doing a melee build, run the knife, if doing a heavy weapon, ditch the broadsider and get a 50 cal or at least a gatling or mini gun
---
A Gatling is nice because it uses 5mm but slowly with heavy damage, a good early heavy that isn't hard to supply ammo
---
Clearly it's not handling the stress of an always online game however. Almost every patch has added more bugs than it's fixed, it's insane
---
It only just really, truly made me notice how much of a snore it was when I was playing the Avengers beta, enjoying it but then realising
---
**Oh no, another chore**
---
A lot of games do it but some games do it better than others, there just needs to be more option as to how you want to distribute your time and different ways to earn the snore score etc. 
---
I mean I know the devs will know this but like you say they follow the green paper trail rather than actually make an enjoyable, rewarding system.
---
So do you think the knife is good in general? Even with 1 star?
---
That is my main concern.  One Wasteland will either make or break the game for me.  I used to play normal without any serums, any special build and no special legendary gear.  It was extremely hard doing a lot of the quests at end game, mobs took forever to kill, I died so much.
---
I did research, started a new character and went with a full health stealth commando build.  While a lot of mobs still feel like bullet sponges, I notice they die a lot quicker than they used too especially with how stealth works, I can kill without being seen if I'm careful, wait a while then attack again.  I'm currently level 63 and working on collecting my legendary sets.
---
I was close to quitting playing as a normal player.  If One Wasteland makes it how it was before I did this build then it'll probably be the end of the game for me and I'll have to find other games to play.
---
I prefer the game how it is now, I enjoy going to old spots and 1 shotting mobs when I need to farm materials, this will no longer be possible.  And it seems I'll be spending more of my time farming mats for ammo for the bullet sponges we will have.   I guess all I can do is wait and see how it goes but I'm not looking forward to it.
---
I'd run the knife over the broadsider, I'd just restack perks to melee if they aren't already. Wont take long to find better
---
Look, unless you work for Bethesda or something, I'm not just going to take your word for it. 
---
In any case my point is the difficulty in submitting a ticket, and the fact that I do *not* have someone from beth telling me to ask Twitch, despite having submitted a ticket. 
---
I found out about the drop through Bethesda's website and you are the first person I have seen suggest this. Anyway. Bundle deadline ended in May and I've been long over it; only used as example to why official channels are not ideal.
---
Even if you are correct, and it is fact I must go through Twitch, it just shows I would have needed to come to Reddit first, hear from you, before learning the solution.
---
Oh and on my Bethesda account on the website it says I'm linked to Twitch prime. It says this on Twitch, ditto for Amazon prime being linked to Twitch; all the pages. I've disconnected them and relinked as Reddit, forums and website has suggested. It's linked. I've clicked claim on the items on Beth's webpage. No items. I dont even get why you argue this.
---
Yes. Pacifists don't fight back. Therefore the pacifist would not go into contention for the workspace.
---
now yes in the real world pacifists would be murdered, but this is a game, not the real world. There's value in having a community in the game that wants to keep playing the game.
---
So perhaps pacifist is the wrong word, I didn't pick it.
---
How about simply "players that don't care for PVP but want to enjoy all the possible features of the game otherwise".
---
And right now the workshop system is broken in a different way. Right now most people don't bother to contend for work stations as near as I can tell because if someone puts six turrets facing the freaking workshop console the instant you click the turrets go aggro and you get shot down.
---
looking back that's happened to players have several times before and I just never noticed. The workshop I happen to have this time didn't have the right angles to make that coincidentally possible while still covering the entrances that I needed to cover for the invariable fight for your workshop against the mobs task.
---
Now I know better. I protect myself by putting six turrets facing the workshop. What a boring waste of time.
---
What I suggest fixes it without the arenas. You're in peaceful mode. Someone takes your workshop. You get to decide whether you want to engage them and take it back. If you want to engage them and take it back you turn off no PVP mode and go take it back.
---
It's not as complicated as making arenas.
---
in the concede of the game PVP doesn't even make sense. These are the people you just spent 25 years training with. There seems to be plenty of stuff to go around. No one's actually starving. they've just spent 25 years being indoctrinated on working together as a team to recover the entire wasteland. And you expect them to start shooting each other the instant they leave the vault.
---
But yeah there are people who want to play that game.
---
I mean seriously I've got enough aid and junk to reprovision four of me because I'm a pack rat. Fighting me for a toaster just doesn't work in the economics of the game.
---
The afterthought PVP is horrible, and in my experience I think I've had four people try to instigate me since the game came out. Granted I'm only a casual player so I'm not on 24/7.
---
Also I've had at least two people try toteam up with me while other people linger suspiciously nearby.
---
But PVP is so terrible that you have to try to kite people into it. There's entire discussion threads about how terrible the PVP is and the cheats people use to trick people into engaging.
---
So it's not rocket science and it doesn't really require a full redesign. if you don't want PVP you just lose the workstation if someone who does want PVP comes and takes it. Then you have the option of joining to take it back, or not...
---
You suggested something vague that would involve a lot of work and automatic resource deposition and the God knows what else, and I suggested something a la carte that could be done with basically one flag set somewhere in the code (per character) and by my account something like three if statements.
---
Everybody here is responding to this simple idea as if I had the bad taste to suggest that we had child trafficking is a minigame.
---
There's better ways to do that.  Make it absolutely crystal clear that a choice must be made.  The SPECIAL system limits your perks in a well defined way - you have 10 STR?  Then you are limited to 10 perks, go choose the ones you want.  But you have 1 legendary perk point?  Lame, go grind out another 500 levels to max it out then move on to another one.
---
Without a defined limit, it is encouraging unhealthy gaming behaviour.  It should be changed.
---
Ok thanks! Also I personally haven't used a gauss at all. Is a level 45 good to use/ammo friendly?
---
I got it working, thank you!
---
well. damn.
---
I'm glad that I can't be arsed to redo my vendors after moving my camp twice so I guess it's staying this way
---
I hope ammosmith stacks with it
---
First, start with getting all rifleman perks. 3 ranks each, raise your perception to 9. Then go for commando perks if you’re into automatic guns.
---
I'm honestly not much a gauss anything fan. I ran a combat rifle until 40, then restacked to run heavy.
---
I used a 2 star zealots Gatling with VATS damage increase until I stockpiled enough 50 cal to run a 3 star zealots exploding 2 shot 50 cal
---
Gauss ammo is about as hard to come by as 50 cal or plasma core in terms of use, so I'd say around lvl 60-80 it becomes eaay enough to use regularly and make enough, or buy enough, ammo to make it worth it.
---
I just always carry a back up, in case ive lost track of ammo and run out mid mission. I usually just run a revolver with a hundred rounds of 44 in my inventory
---
Well, now I just need a friend to test this
---
Here's the thing, with regular armor you get up to 15 legendary effects, a wide selection of mods to choose from, multiple mods per armor piece, and several perks which explicitly say that they do not work in PA (and some which don't say so, but don't work in PA). *And a backpack*.
---
Power armor, on the other hand, has two things going for it: damage resistance and radiation resistance. You can only equip one mod per piece, not counting headlamps because that's just cosmetic. That's six mods, or four if you're not a melee build. And you're screwed on having any useful effect on your PA legs if you want that carryweight, where regular armor gets that and much more, so it's more like two effects unless if you want to carry practically nothing. They even gave the jetpack to the secret service armor, so now there's even less reason to use power armor.
---
There are three perks which only work in power armor, there are at least eleven which only work outside of PA.
---
Is a bit of extra carryweight really that big of an ask? I could get so much more on my melee build and that's before factoring in unyielding. Hell, on my 1 STR pistol build I have about the same amount as my max STR heavy weapons build.
---
They said they were working on it hopefully they'll put armor racks in when the brotherhood arrives
---
That's the worst part honestly.
---
They represent the problem with this game as a whole.
---
Massive grind for....negligible gain.
---
Like talking to a fucking wall.  Bye.
---
Any loot worth getting?
---
Ladders mod for New Vegas: am i a joke to you?
---
There's so many it lags the entire workshop, including the ammo production. Besides, there's already a genuine and properly functional ammo generator at the munitions plant. And it makes trying to capture that workshop a nightmare, it's a warzone every once in a while, making it more or less invalid.
---
I wouldn't mind it if it didn't destroy the game and the workshop, it lags everything and makes an occasional warzone of it whenever someone tries to capture, so anyone with a god tier Tesla could dominate and kill people for the sake of killing without ammo benefits.
---
Mods I can say would be fair, but not back pack.
---
You have to grind forever to either get the good legendary armor or the stuff to trade for it. X01 is pretty damn good for just beating the story.
---
I'm a Power armor user myself on my 2nd main, so it's not like I'm anti power armor.
---
Also there's a reason some perks can't be used with Power armor, it's grest as is.
---
It's a good thing they already thought of that and added a new ammo crafting legendary perk... and also the fact that so much first aid material already drops that you never have to craft a single one. Oh wait... also the ammo converter... and new objects in camps to apply new buffs... it's almost like this was planned or something?
---
Yeah, I taught my friend about red flags for camps and ways to avoid then, no.1 if it's off a ledge-solution wear PA OR use goat legs, crouch cause they will sometimes leave and rejoin due to a friend being there aswell. 2.If it has tunnels-solution, stash junk and put on light footed 3.Flamethrower and rad trap-solution, the best you can do is PA or a stealth suit, if it's wants you to go through a tunnel with a powered door either side then that's a red flag
---
They were drops I got personally. People were playing back then you know people also hoarded with mules.
---
Never heard of that, but I assume it's janky af
---
Who said "so much"?
---
It was just too shotted by a guy who was 5 to 10 times my level, with a fully bloodied melee build who hit me while I was using my stash box. 
---
This is probably the The sixth time someone has tried to instigate me since I started playing this game the day it was released.
---
I'm only a casual player and I've taken several months off so I'm only like 75.
---
My outrage comes from the fact that if you've opted out of PVP, you shouldn't be vulnerable to PVP.
---
And people have indeed pointed out that it talks about PVP when you claim the workstation, and it uses the word might.
---
but it's stupid to have non-PVP players first in a PVP by someone else's action, or otherwise requiring them to completely ignore the resource generation system part of the economy as they're only two unpaid choices.
---
Now that I know this cheap shot is possible I'll go back to pointing six turrets at the workbench so that the instant the person pushes the button on the workbench they get mowed down.
---
What a tedious waste of everybody's time.
---
I've offered a simple solution that keeps people from praying on characters there are a tenth of their level, and everybody's acting like I suggested murdering their dog.
---
Travel agent is an always on card for me, however I'll some times switch it out for photosynthesis if people are hurt. then the one that let's you heal radation in the day time. Though thats only if I know there are no bloodied builds on the team
---
No offense but I'm not trying to team up with others i want to do my own thing at my own pace im not trying to put special points in charisma and endurance either. This PTS killed every build pretty much i want to have fun not shoot at a bullet sponge
---
Yeah I’m still waiting for a reply or some sort of acknowledgment for a couple reports I’ve done this week, I just get generic replies saying if I don’t reply they’ll close the ticket -.-
---
Then you haven't been reading my posts.
---
I specifically suggested the following:
---
If you're a pacifist you can only claim an unowned workstation.
---
If a PVP player claims a workstation that you own, when you are a pacifist, he gets the workstation immediately and you do not enter PvP.
---
after that happens if you decide you want to take the workstation back you have to turn on PVP and go take it back.
---
If you are both PVP enabled then the game runs exactly as it runs today.
---
This is a perfectly simple and workable suggestion that could be implemented in maybe 20 lines of code.
---
I guess your post attracted walls. 
---
You're just saying it is a certain way, because you believe it, without additional information. 
---
I told you I did my research when this was of concern to me, and called out your BS solution and the idea that you somehow know how Bethesda operates. You either know, or are speculating. Read: BS.
---
Edit: also, idk what a Twitch drop is, but the bundle I am referring to is this, in case you realize you are barking at the wrong tree: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/IJxzJeM5UHDv3C0PHNEt3/fallout-76-twitch-prime-wastelanders-bundle
---
What else on bethesdas website is its support not responsible for? I need to know.
---
She used to be. But she hasn't aged well...
---
Ok awesome! Thank you so so much for the help!
---
are you on Steam or Bethesda?
---
It's a good thing they already fixed that issue on the PTS; go look into it. I've played pistol toon and honestly it's not nearly as bad as you claim it is; just aim for the head and get a good legendary roll setup. With the new patch I'll be rolling that character back out and dusting it off for some fun.
---
No. My solution is to allow people who've paid full price for the game to enjoy the game even if they don't want to PVP.
---
Your solution is to leave in place the idea that resource generation parts of the economy are excluded for people who don't want to PVP.
---
If they added new mods or legendary effects, they could make obtaining them a grind like they've done in the past. It'd only be fair.

Yes, I was shocked yesterday when I was doing the Wolf horde Forest event and after killing all 3 without taking the lvl10 1 star legendaries, I saw a lvl 50 Quad the Fixer appear on my screen as a reward. Never got a fixer, or anything else for that matter. Happened also at the Grafton Dam event. Might do more events now.
---
I've been playing since the game started. I know about bug parts leading to acid. I'm rife with acid.
---
I'm just a casual gamer so I only pay occasionally. I'm overloaded so I think I've got 700 lb of crap on me and my stash is full. I've got enough junk to fortify every person came out of the vault in anyone instance.
---
This is not a game of scarcity.
---
Is your wife single?.... asking for Eldyrus...
---
Yes, so now I have to point six turrets at the work station so that every time you claim it it just guns you down. Got it. What a waste of everybody's time.
---
You have just demonstrated that you are exactly the kind of grief where I was talking about. You've literally made my argument.
---
How about something like bonuses to certain SPECIAL stats for wearing matching armor types? Like all Combat Armor, all Leather Armor, etc... Also it doesn't matter if the other pieces are legendary, so you can stack it with other Legendary armor pieces. 
---
For example: you've got a Vanguard's Combat Armor Left Leg, an (insert perk name) Combat Armor Right Leg, and just normal Combat Armor Arms and chestplate. You'll get the buffs from the Vanguard's leg, and the other leg because the rest of your armor is Combat Armor.
---
They legit say they won't respond with a result, you're speaking to the void hoping something will happen
---
It is. Both connect to Beth pc servers
---
Gunpowder and how it keeps sneaking into my inventory(I just quickly take everything off corpses because I can either scrap it or use/convert the ammo, but I keep forgetting about those damn super mutants and their love of gunpowder) is why I want a "definitely don't let me pick this up" toggle in the game settings.
---
Pc only and bethnet launcher only IIRc
---
Lmaoooooooooo those turrets won't do anything. Add Ign Nekrosias any time, and if you look at my tag you should know I love to raid folks. Especially salty folks. Put as many turrets as you want
---
Also I should mention you don't have to touch the workstation to claim a workshop snh
---
I also choose this guy's soon to be divorced wife.
---
Same but even if it doesn't the 250% on most gun types will be great. Especially for stuff like the minigun.
---
That's fine. Your predator. You keep making my point.
---
people like you get blocked and I never have to deal with you a second time. You think you're proving your manhood or something, that's all you got in life that's fine too.
---
Some of us play for the game, we like the story and the setting. You like being a griefer. You fight for the opportunity to grief. And you hate any suggestion they would reduce your ability to grief.
---
Like I said if that's all you got in your life...
---
I'll add you! When are you usually on?
---
Are we not getting it?  Didn't we finish the goal?
---
lmao
---
It's literally my gameplay bro :P get salty. Also nukacolariley is my girlfriend irl, I just moved across the country, seeing new places and such. I got plenty of things irl, me and her like to raid folks like you together &lt;3 and blocking doesn't work either. I won't tell you how, but I can unblock myself after you block me. Care to try it? You won't be the first and won't be the last :P
---
Yes. Everybody mentions that I could give up the entire resource collection part of the economy even though I paid full price for the game.
---
That's griefing for you.
---
You continue to make my point.
---
Those who want to enjoy the game without griefers either have to give up part of the game that we paid for or pay extra.
---
That should keep the community alive.
---
I here a distinct lack of you being willing to take on people of equal build status. You've literally told us all that you're a coward that hunts "food builds" or whatever.
---
Do keep talking please. The more you say the more reasonable I sound. Because you're literally making my point.
---
If I am predator then you are prey
---
Nowadays?  The daily challenges we have now for seasons are little different from the old challenges for atoms, hell a lot of them are way easier.  No hardcore players should feel worn out from logging in and chewing a piece of gum, claiming a workshop, taking a picture and killing three legendaries.
---
If you've been grinding out the repeatable then you're the one making this a soulless grind.  There's still what?  At least three weeks left?  That's at least 75k worth of score not even counting the next set of double dailies and bonus challenges.  If you had just ten levels to go that's less than 34k worth of score, again not even counting the double or bonus you could have half assed your way through the rest of the season and still comfortably finished.
---
How exactly do you claim the workshop without going over to the workshop and claiming the workshop? Are you perhaps hacking...?
---
I get that it's got your gameplay. That's why you're lame.
---
I'm also betting blocking works fine, mostly because I'm on console sadly...
---
You're not the "leet" boy you think you are.
---
Does that make you feel hard. Does it stir your loins. Is that the pinnacle of your life?
---
You are one sad creeper.
---
Prove it
---
Ngl thats pretty fuckin amazing. Yeah you might have a few points less damage per shot and its not worth shit on the market but its pretty much the same as a level 45 one
---
The biggest difference is purely a mental thing
---
Yeah I loaded into the legendary run menu and instantly dropped to 5 FPS on my Xbox
---
No it doesn't. I am talking about the router, not your consoles.
---
On controller it's the select button, hold it down in a workshop zone.
---
Just talking shit to someone bitching on reddit, par for the course really
---
So when it says waiting for a agent it’s just giving you an update on where it’s at? They don’t message acknowledging the report?
---
How about the ones we have actually work? I have a weapon that says 90% weight decrease but it doesn’t affect it at all.
---
No we do not get score weekend, they want us to pay real money to get to the end.
---
You already have.
---
Good to know.
---
Btw the unblocking method works on console. It's Bethesda that allows unblocking. Thank Todd howard
---
Hey sorry for the late reply I just woke up. There is a text chat mod? That would be such a game changer
---
Hey if that's as high as you peak, You do you.
---
That's kind of all you'll ever be anyway...
---
Karmically.
---
I knew bloody needed a nerf. It was completely OP. The other builds didn’t need any nerfs though, they are bad enough as is
---
*I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine,*
---
*I picked up my rifle and I walked to the mine,*
---
*I shot down sixteen hundred wendigo spawn*
---
*And the Colossus said, "Kid, get off my lawn!"*
---
Added you :)
---
Will do!
---
When you send a report through the game, they give you an email, the email is basically just where you submit evidence I think. Regardless that's the only response they'll ever give, the same stock email every time.
---
I've never gotten a response regardless of how much evidence I give, so I just gave up
---
I have been bringing mine to the fight lately.
---
Oh yeah, totes bro. I got so many better things to do at 3 am. Wake up, talk some shit on reddit for a bit, go back to sleep, wake up, do shit all day, grief at night with Riley, repeat. It's not a bad life ngl
---
I block the user tag not in the game.
---
You click on the user you go examine their profile and then block them there.
---
Thank PlayStation Network...
---
Bethesda already removed block and put in block for session, but that's some weak sauce. They made that change because too many griefers were getting blocked the easy way. But I know the real way.
---
Oh ya i read about this. Rip ammo as an economy and my 10k 5.56
---
Yeah I don't think this is an "always online" issue, it's just an issue with the engine.
---
All of their games are riddled with bugs.  We just don't mind them because the games are oftentimes immersive/interesting/fun and we just give them a pass unless it's a completely game-breaking bug.
---
Suppose that's fair, on pc the blocking system is complete shit. And there's an easy way around it.
---
Huh. I've got a real life. People. Friends. A decent job. My own house. My own car. Couple hundred thousand in the bank.
---
But you... You smack talk people on the internet... What a success.
---
Sure thing, don't sweat. Your money, your time and your freedom to do whatever with it. Who cares what anyone thinks.
---
Thanks, so you choose to explore it just like a normal vault or do a daily op with a group, ok and I think there will be terminals,holotapes...?
---
I can't believe I'm saying this but I'm honestly on the fence about whether or not they should be removed.
---
If they were more prevalent in the community I'd probably take more of an issue with them.
---
Fallout 76 feels like one of those online games that's not tethered to the new-age 'we need to hyper balance everything' ethos.
---
It's one of the last refuges where something bizarrely stupid and completely broken can still exist and there's a certain charm to it.
---
I'm not sure if this is an issue in NW where there's some semblance of competition but as far as Adventure Mode is concerned, I haven't seen any hacked weapons in the weeks I've been playing and I haven't had any of my gaming experience really hindered by their existence.
---
I mean, success is what you make it. I'm a disabled vet seeing the east coast for the first time. You mention all sorts of material stuff, but no girl. I got a car, getting paid to go to college by the VA, and am still young enough to enjoy it. Many ways to live a life, at least I don't bring smack talk to irl when I lose an internet argument :p
---
it went in the scip  machine sry
---
So there are terminals,holotapes and more lore, is that true?
---
I have a zealot’s cyro with 90%WD that I pack around just to freeze the queen.  The thumbs up I get makes it worth carrying the extra ammo.
---
I actually enjoy it, gives me something to do in game. At first I thought, no way am I reaching the end of the run. So far I look like im on track. Overall Im pretty happy with the run, I feel a sense of achievement when I get one of the rewards. Im really looking forward to having that chicken coop and monkey backpack. 
---
If its a chore, just don't do it, beth arent forcing us to play.
---
I am just happy the bloodied one-shotting event boss days will be gone.
---
Also, bloodied will be worse than it is currently, absolutely not "killed". It will still one shot enemies, occasionally it may take 2 shots.
---
on the topic of legendaries, why are there 5 total stars bit you can only get a maximum of 3 filled? was Bethesda just to lazy or was it cut content
---
The fact that you have to know how to unblock yourself is another testament to how happy people are to be associated with you. honestly it would never have even occurred to me to look.
---
So is that what you call winning? Having to find ways to get yourself unghosted, unblocked, and unbanned because you're so popular?
---
I guess that's why you're up at 3:00 in the morning talking smack so you can go back to bed so you can wake up and talk smack again.
---
Yeah dude you've got this whole life thing down Pat don't you...
---
I'd laugh but you're too sad.
---
Did you check if the textures were in one of the texture ba2s? They might need to be extracted separately.
---
I want a "One Vault Boy/Girl Army" perk that gives you additional carry weight and ability to fast travel when over encumbered, IF you are carrying an absurd amount of different weapons(meaning you can't just carry a bunch of combat knives to get the buff; each needs to be a different kind of weapon)
---
You're the one who brought it to real life. You're the one who made it a lifestyle comment. You're not even aware enough of what you're saying and doing.
---
Congratulations on the girl. I prefer men, and I don't hear one on the other end of this conversation... I hear a child who thinks griefing other people makes him bigger.
---
the hacked shit is even on the pts lmao.
---
Grindy as fuck, look into easy to find items that people want, farm caps, look into trades (scamming exists) look for what legendary effects people want and yeah just do research my man good luck
---
\*Plays MMO.\*
---
\*MMO gets balance patch after over a year of neglect.\*
---
\*Players threaten to rage quit if balances are done.\*
---
Your gear isn't worthless, Bloodied is still very powerful; you just can't have a God complex over it anymore. Welcome to playing a MMO where changes happen in a ever altering and updating online game; this was bound to happen eventually. This is probably the best thing to happen to 76 in a very, very long time and it means that other builds can now see the light of day.
---
You sound salty bro, you gonna be okay? And yes, in fallout I love to get blocked. I'm banned in a fuckton of discords. But never been banned in game. I grief folks till they can't take it. I target the "hardened" ones most. Everyone else is meh, if I see em in a workshop I might as well. And I woke up in the middle of the night. Might as well talk shit
---
&gt; unless it is upvoted very high
---
Not really, beth doesn't understand reddit, for them to take note of something it needs several highly upvoted posts in a row.
---
do not try to rush the story, take your time and explore as much as possible. break down your junk and store it regularly in your STASH box to avoid losing any if you die. Avoid workshops because they are PVP areas and you may be unlucky to be targeted by someone more prepared then you are. after level 5 turn on pacifist mode to prevent accidental PVP encounters, unless you want to try your luck.
---
Ok. I was trying to add something positive to all the salt on this sub since the PTS debacle. I don't work at/for Bethesda, so maybe contact them about your issue.
---
Don't forget that Ammo Factory stacks with Ammosmith, meaning you can craft 230% more ammo (not to mention a 30% chance to get double of that for free with SuperDuper).
---
On top of that, enemies you kill in Daily Ops and the Wendigo Spawns in Colossal Problems drop tons of ammo that you use.
---
So suffice to say that keeping ammo stocked will be viable and well.
---
76 has been particularly buggy is the thing, not just oversights either, just an insane amount of errors, crashes, whatnot. A lot being because of it being online
---
So you've played the other games already? I would do yourself a favour, stop reading stuff that may spoil your experience, and jump in.
---
The first bits nowadays are similar enough to ole fallout that you should hit the ground running. 
---
Be prepared that vats is now real time, and you are online, so if your connection is questionable or if the server doesn't feel like it, you'll get lag which manifests in a pulled trigger not firing, or a delay between firing and hitting enemy, as one example.
---
You start at 1 pt for all specials. Either try to min max and ruin your first playthrough, or just enjoy. 
---
By looking up builds now, you probably wouldn't understand half of what you read, and trying to make a perfect optimal build (often they only focus on damage and survivability) may make other parts of your game much less enjoyable.
---
And like I said. If that's your claim to fame. if you like being that unpopular because it's the only way you can feel bigger than the small thing you are, I don't want to take it away from you.
---
If you have so little belief in yourself that you have to be a "predator" I hope you'll never have children because you're going to be a terrible father.
---
Everything you say proves that you are not satisfied with your manhood or your spot in life.
---
Anybody who loves to bring grief is lashing out like a child.
---
Like I said, I'd laugh but you are too sad.
---
You don't even understand the prison you built around yourself.
---
For sure
---
It really don't, it's my gameplay. It doesn't make me feel like I'm a badass, it just makes me happy. The reactions make me laugh. It's not hard to understand, it's simple. And no sir, you are def the one to bring it irl.
---
I've played new  Vegas, and fo4, but I'm very sure this is going to look a fo game but not feel like it.
---
This perks not for everyone, its like a final destination, for grinding for endgame players
---
I've checked it out on my pts and unfortunately I'm sure Bethesda will go ahead with it. The only way to give them a well deserved kick in the nuts is to stop giving them money .
---
[Sausage Party] - You recieve an audible que whenever theres a nearby hotdog or sausage. [Bang Bang] -  1% chance to instead reload your gun with a small instakill "Bang! Bang!" Flag that fires like a crosbow bolt. [They all Float] Whenever you drop anything theres a small chance you tie a balloon to your loot bag. [ A A ] - If you do a certain amount of positive emotes around a group of players, you cure your alcoholism and recieve 1 Cap. [You F#cking Kidding Me] - When your character loads into a world where your CAMP cannot be placed instead of moving it for free, the option "The next Bethesda employee to sneeze also shits thier pants" becomes available.
---
I like this idea. Maybe there could be added bonuses if they all share the same mod. Like buttressed or whatever.
---
It works! thank you very much mate!
---
Only mod I got for the staff was poison one. Twice.
---
And some people are still conviced, even after seeing this, that this new damage system is a good change... \*sigh
---
If you can't even oneshot a random trash mob with a weapon that has a rate of fire of 6 (6!!!!), what's the point in keep using it. GG Bethesda, you are forcing everyone to play commando.
---
At this point Bethesda should delete all weapons except handmades and fixers, it would be easier for everyone.
---
I was too but then switched to stealth commando. I don’t mind changes.  Keeps it interesting.   Just make things better.
---
Side with the Free Radicals against the Wayward in the early stages of the game. It will not have a negative impact and you'll get a cool mask cosmetic that almost everyone seems to miss.
---
I hope we get the outfit and the bos collection protection.
---
You so salty, why u so salty. I'm talking about griefing folks in a video game and you're like "the prison you built around yourself" and "you're going to be a terrible father". Just one question my dude, where did the butthurt touch you.
---
Troll or just stupid?
---
Sweet good to know
---
This is fantastic. 😂
---
Two-shot cryolater always stays on me for SBQ fights 😎
---
Strange in numbers, primarily because I run a low CHA build.
---
That broadside is kinda horrible, sorry. At least the knife is usable
---
My tank build was one-shotted today by a shotgun set up on the otherside of the workshop build area.
---
The guy griefed my workshop then left the server.  It kind of ruins the game.
---
Dumb question, how do I get the Gauss Mini?
---
Take your time with the game and take in the sights and sounds of Appalachia; the map is absolutely massive and there is so much to do without having to focus on powering through content. You will want to setup a home around Flatwoods or Morgantown in the start since both have junk, water and food sources all over the place. Caps is your life blood at early game so always make sure to sell extra low level items to vendors that you don't need. Scrapping extra gear like weapons and armor unlocks plans so always make sure to do that when you don't need caps for the day. Also one last thing, talk and make friends with players; the 76 community is amazing for the most part and you will absolutely find people that are like-minded; have fun!
---
That looks like an old article from way back. The perks have changed now.
---
Sneaky rifleman is a perception/agi and quite often luck build. Make those into big numbers and you *will* find uses for them :)
---
That'd be a great addition, especially if they added a raider themed version of it: a chair that when placed, spawns an NPC who is tied to that chair. Killing the NPC would have an effect like killing a player's brahmin, damaging the chair. When repaired, the NPC respawns.
---
For now I'll have to settle for friends or my alt: https://i.imgur.com/no2oOB9.png
---
Pointing out idiots for being idiots isn’t getting mad lol. 
---
BTW the idiot I’m point out now is you.
---
Dude. You've admitted that you have to stalk people in a video game. Your gameplay style is to ruin other people's experience. You brag about how unwanted you are and how you get around it.
---
Your life consists of inserting yourself where you're unwelcome.
---
And you started it when you brought up your typical schedule for trying to make people unhappy on the internet. But okay I started it. So what. I pointed out that you were lame in the video game, you bragged about how it was your greatest achievement, and then I pointed out that there's more to life than being unwanted.
---
Has anybody ever actually wanted you?
---
does other people's casual enjoyment of this game, or any game, actually bring you emotional pain?
---
Why do you think you have so much to prove?
---
Why do you have this urge to win the internet?
---
Why do you feel the need to make people reject you, and then force yourself on them afterwards?
---
You have utterly made the point that the PVP system in this game makes the game potentially quite toxic.
---
You don't even know your toxic, you brag about it.
---
You, sir, are a poster child for leading the unexamined life.
---
I'm not salty. I decided to give one shot to helping you wake up to the fact that being a griefer is a hollow victory that should shame you instead of bringing you such joy.
---
Who broke you dude?
---
Feels fallout enough that I haven't played any of the other ones since this one, and I own all of them from 1 to 76
---
Do we retroactively start with coins based on what level our characters already are?
---
I'm playing with 3 other friends and none of us have crashed at all while playing the game, not sure if we're just incredibly lucky or what.
---
Maybe I just didn't put two and two together when I originally read your comment.
---
Did you mean that because it gets more updates/patches/content/etc... it generates more bugs over time and the singleplayer installments don't because they don't have as many changes/updates made to them?
---
Then you don't do pvp, events, trading, play long enough, attend discord guilds or just don't care. In that case sure, nothing to see.
---
76 plays almost perfectly like Fo4 but improved in pretty much every way; if you played survival mode in Fo4 you should already have a advantage over most players starting fresh. The only thing you might have to get used to is the real time Vats mode; other than that I got used to it instantly.
---
That’s why I said manually when the post was about doing it automatically...
---
It's not supposed to be something you go out and grind for, it's just supposed to be something that just happens as you progress. Don't treat it as a "MUST HAVE ALL" because it's not like that
---
Are you wearing the veil?
---
I know I'm toxic in fallout. I seperate the game from real life. You should try it. And it's fun, I don't have to stalk folks. They stalk me my dude. My biggest fan is sinseer. Look up my name on yt and you'll see sinseers hour long service announcements. And I am wanted, just not by casuls on fallout. My gameplay as a raider started out with one goal, to be banned in many discords and to make a bunch of folks make vids about how much I griefed them and bitch about it.
---
I could barely upgrade any of them, and I've played the game for over 1.5k hours mostly on my level 400 main.
---
That happened to me with PA renaming, I was so used to it just not being an option that I didn't discover it til a week or two ago xD
---
the looter. it enables you to loot everything from dead enemies within a certain range and increasing range as you level it up. instead of having to spend half an hour looting everything.
---
the communist. automatically turns off pacifist mode and launches a grenade at any one in the vicinity wearing liberty prime power armour.
---
can you read? i literally said "everytime i walk up with the veil on"
---
From what I can see, all of the damage boosts are now additive. So if your base weapon damage is 100, and you have a +200% damage boost (to reach 300), the equation for an Instigating ( +100% damage) shot would be 100 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 400.
---
It all started when I was a boy... Jk lol. I just like to make people salty in fallout. What's so hard to understand. Destiny 2, fallout, EFT, Conan exiles, rust, all of these games give opportunities to PvP. I use it to its full extent that's all
---
I think this is their response to their lack of actual game content, make players grind arbitrary goals.
---
But I’m new to the game man they aren’t underleveled
---
Oh man, really?? That sucks
---
You have to scrap perk cards, so if you have few cards you wish to scrap them you won't be able to upgrade much.
---
At level 400, I was barely able to upgrade a few of them, and not even to max level.
---
Do the power armour clip
---
Why you being rude? Not necessary is it
---
Exactly. I think a better solution would be to give you the 7 perk cards and the special limiting you from going past 10 or 15 points in that category.
---
Just hang on to them, don't open perk packs.
---
With all the changes coming in, you might need every point to respec or to get some perk points later. It might even be that putting everything into perk-points and starting a new char with legendary perks could be cheaper and faster than a respec.
---
Yes I would like that stuff as well.
---
They follow exactly the same MMO plan as ESO 
---
Microtransactions and monthly subscriptions this is Zenimax Media Model the game publishers this is an investment you really don’t get it???? You think anyone cares about the fans no more games nowadays they give us as little as possible for as much price 
---
think they have a say at the end of the day they will have a say in the final product. It like with any investor you have to be flexible with your publisher it happens in every single industry music entertainment the person who finances you is your boss at the end of the day people talking like I’m a fool who doesn’t understand how games are developed.
---
The only reason I’m so pissed is becuase I regard the FO series one of the greatest of all time not becuase I dislike the game but how the industry just spits in our face if people wanna dick ride devs that’s fine but know they only doing it for the status quo not becuase they care about fans having a decent experience
---
I like it. I still loot everything even after nearly 1,000 hours playing so this would save me the effort. Plus you'd be less likely to miss a legendary corpse during a chaotic mob scene.
---
Someone went to trade me a week ago and I could see they had a wedding ring from Fallout 4 with 3 legendary effects on it. Bethesda pls
---
I wonder what the robot will say
---
I had the servers not responding thing yesterday just in time that the queen was going down, I rage cried .
---
Recycled lines from the watoga vendor no doubt.
---
Really? Thats terrible :P
---
I agree op. If they were going to decide to let any of the challengrs fail it is this one. Directly leads to more pressure to get score (or pay with atoms) for those where this event would have helped.
---
I can see them backing off failing the other items such as camp stuff because of outrage that would come if those items return as Atom only, or worse, cash only. 
---
With CAMP stuff, they already used salary time to make it with the intention of us having it for free, for playing the game and event.
---
Meanwhile, Score/Legendary Run was always seemingly intended (as with other games with pay to rush battlepasses) to make those who can't do all dailies *really* want to pay because they are *so* close.
---
Haven't been there in a hot minute so I'm not sure what they say down there
---
Grognak and the Ruby Ruins or whatever its called is actually kinda fun tho
---
I don't think it's good because it's not the fault of the player that they're pushed into playing a mode just to get some SCORE.  Also, why would someone want to have people with no interest in the mode who aren't going to play it as intended, stick around even longer? If they're allowed to pick the lock and die, they'll leave happy and everyone who liked NW can get back to competitive matches. If people spitefully camp the locks and prevent them from getting the challenge done, they'll keep rejoining again and again until they get fed up with people being jerks. Sounds like they have less interest in their precious NW's integrity being sullied, and more interest in getting easy XP shooting fish in a barrel.
---
Nice. What's your setup? Combat armor and laser/combat rifles, or full on heavy/PA?
---
Because it's caused ammo sales to flatline. Some of us like to buy and sell things as part of our endgame and exploits like this keep us from enjoying that aspect of the game.
---
Exactly.
---
No you don't separate it from real life. You brag about it here. You brag about griefing people on the internet outside of the game.
---
By your own words you're simply toxic.
---
That shit doesn't just stay in one corner man.
---
Both really, the game was the buggiest piece of garbage at launch. While it's technically gotten better since, it's still filled with bugs that I end up using to my advantage without even thinking of them half the time. like just stop and think of all the strange shit that happens over time, not just crashes, visual bugs are everywhere, right now there's a bug that happens in Line in the Sand that lets you get crazy XP, half the guns are broken in one way or another, you can phase through walls with power armor or photomode with the right combination of actions. Some guns are even dealing extra damage for seemingly no reason because of certain legendary effects. The last update was supposed to add things like deep pocketed for secret service armor, and fix the description on the Stealth suit helmet. Instead they broke two quests, and didn't fix either of those things. Among many, many other problems with just this last update
---
It’s been leaked they’re coming with armor ace atomic shop tho so that sucks
---
Don't starch your jeans, they're stiff enough already.
---
It's reddit my dude, the fallout reddit. Not supposed to talk fallout shit on fallout reddit. Okay basement dweller, I didn't know reddit was your life but you do you.
---
What does it require anyway?  I’ve never really seen it explained anywhere. I’m level 185. I’d assume those people at level 400 and such shouldn’t have any problems...I’d hope
---
What are you playing on?
---
That's what I've been doing and plan on continuing to do.   I can do heavy weapons, melee or commando.   I will never scrap the perk cards that make those things good.  Therefore, I probably won't get very far on the legendary perks, but I can't imagine not having that flexibility.
---
Me too. I can't buy it
---
go to the nukes dragons website and play with your perks as much as you want.
---
They just need to add an angry holotape or terminal entry from an engineer about how a senator gave the job to his nephew's company, despite them being totally unqualified.
---
You like to make people miserable. You think you stick it only in one place. You don't.
---
You've already proved that you're lying about this by talking about how you come on the internet just to make people salty here.
---
Your list of places where you like to make people salty is probably infinite because you obviously take enjoyment about making people miserable.
---
I'd have to generalize to go farther than that but this is what you've admitted to so far.
---
You don't just use it to its fullest extent, when people opt out of you you stalk them. You literally chased them after they've said they don't want you anymore. You actively try to circumvent bans.
---
It's not healthy.
---
and if you're unhealthy in this area in a game, you're probably just as toxic and have just as many excuses for it in real life.
---
These are classic warning signs of unresolved anger issues and self-image problems.
---
Outlook, not so good. Tell yourself anything you want, but you're a caricature of a type.
---
That's really petty. I've only had a problem the first time they had this challenge. Then someone pointed me to Mama Dolce's and the locked toolbox near the hole in the back wall. I've usually been able to get to that one quickly enough to complete the challenge.
---
I bet you even have an excuse for when you punch the wall, or get salty and bars, everything's an exception and nothing is the rule.
---
You think calling me a basement dweller after I already told you I own my own house is going to somehow wound me?
---
You are the one who said that you get up at 3:00 a.m. just to get on the internet and make people feel salty.
---
Like I said an exception for every possible venue. how many friends and girlfriends have you driven away? How many people feel threatened by you and does that make you feel big?
---
Seriously you need to look at yourself. If a complete stranger can tell all this from all the way over here, how much more potent should the toxicity seem in person?
---
I checked my score before doing an easy one like use photo mode in a group and I received no score from doing it.
---
That's the character Nekrosias for you :P the only people who I actively hunt are the people who take things too far. Haven't hunted anyone since like, 6months ago. Cunt who sent hackers after me. I've been doxxed too, hunted them down as well. I'm still waiting for the pipe bombs they promised me &lt;3
---
There are some events in which that stealth is completely useless. Currently on the PTS The daily ops have enemies with a mutation that sees all players through stealth. Stealth in The daily ops appears to be completely useless currently.
---
Super excited to bring my junkies heavy gunner in there. My flamers sound perfect for that space
---
The Perks should act like a level cap. Division watch is at 1000. Not sure what ESO CP level cap is but it's reasonably obtainable. These are pretty difficult.
---
The Perks should be an awesome reward worth grinding for, but not such a grind you don't actually want to get them
---
I had one of those beam splitter handmades and it did no damage
---
Iv got a few some great and some not. The idea is to use legendary perks to open new build possibilities. Something this game desperately needs. 
---
Possibly legendary perks. 
---
Edisons favorite sun/ daughter - ballistic damage and explosive damage done by the player is weakened by 75%. While Energy and weapons are boosted by 50%. Does not apply to heavy guns. 
---
My Thoughts: Energy weapons need a serious boost and nerfing explosive damage while using this perk would take care of legacy weapons becoming even more over powered. 
---
Wireless energy- for every 10 energy ammo spent the player gets 5 back. But ballistic ammo now weighs twice as much. 
---
Kamikaze- explosive damage is now double but players will randomly exploded. At random intervals a timer of 6 seconds will start. When the timer hits 0 the player explodes. This explosion can damage enemies but not players unless in pvp. Upon death the player will lose any junk held in their inventory. 
---
My Thoughts: i feel like this would open up a whole new play style. Kinda like the powder gangers in new vegas except even more crazy. 
---
Made in china- a stronger version of the liberator will randomly come to your aid. Any Nearby liberators will no longer attack you. Except during events. 
---
First responder- when equipped every time a player revives someone. They become invincible for 20 seconds but can not use weapons during this time period. Using weapons ends the effect. 
---
Free health care- when equipped anytime a player uses a stimpak to revive another player. They have a 50% chance to remove their own rads,  Diseases and fully recover their health. 
---
The doctor will see you now- players can once every 60 seconds recover other players health at the cost of 25% of their health. This is activated by selecting heal team mate while standing next to them. Only works on teamates not at full health and not currently waiting for a revive.  
---
My Thoughts: these two would give support based characters more flexibility on the field.
---
You literally told me that you wake up at 3:00 in the morning with the urge to go on the internet and make someone miserable.
---
Not healthy.
---
If you think it's just a character and not you, that's just denial.
---
A character didn't jump off at character treatment page and wake you up in the middle of the night you did that.
---
Like I said, an excuse for every circumstance.
---
I have 3 Charisma and run with Inspirational, Travel Agent, and Strange in Numbers most of the time. I tend to share Inspirational most often, but if someone else on the team is sharing that one, I'll do Strange in Numbers.
---
The funniest part about this is that everyone kept saying, keep bloodied and buff everything else. Bethesda went and nerfed everything instead!
---
But it is ok in general?
---
Honestly, im genuinely upset that each change they make has not been to GIVE the community something, but to take something away, or to make the game more of a grind with less reward. They dont listen to the actual people who play this game. 
---
We got the purveyor to roll new weapons, and then legendary spawns were nerfed into the ground. Remember running white springs or watoga and walking away with a dozen legendaries. Now youre lucky if those two places yield one or two. Which is fine to make them rarer, but they did this right after bringing in the purveyor. So now we grind longer for legendaries. 
---
They bring in the SCORE system, to encourage people to log in every day and play, but then take away thousands of atoms we used to be able to build up.  Now we have to grind for a couple hours every day to get rewards, most of which we dont even want. Who uses scrap kits, cmon now. 
---
Wastelanders brought the bullion grind. 
---
Possum scouts brought the badge grind.
---
Now instead of actually making some lower types of weapons viable, changing prefixes that do nothing beneficial, changing damages and reexamining perk cards to give us the ability to use builds other than just bloodied or junkies, they just nerf everything. Which honestly is just a new ammo grind. Instead of 2 bullets, we will use 6 or 10, which means longer playing to grind mats for ammo. 
---
Personally I feel like every change is done just to force us to play longer, work harder for the same reward, instead of actually giving us better content, and fun  tasks that we enjoy so much we want to play more.
---
The game is actually pretty easy to like at the beginning, because it's problem is the endgame or lack of it.
---
You are just salty and grasping at straws my dude :P irl is different then video game or reddit. Learn the difference and maybe one day you'll be a big boy just like me, trolling food builds for luls. What else is there to do for me in game. I got 5 mule accounts completely loaded down, endless scrap and resources, and all the new plans. The endgame is PvP, and I've been at the endgame since a month after beta. Only thing left to farm is salty reddit tears and people in game.
---
Pretty sure they are not account wide. The slots are but the cards are not
---
I'm actually genuinely concerned. I've watched this kind of unresolved anger bullshit drive some of my vet friends to the edge of suicide.
---
That I do not know, I don't have a stealth character to fully test out enemies reactions in the PTS
---
wow
---
You keep saying I'm making excuses, but really you're just trying to project your lack of seperation from in game and real life. I woke up today, doesn't happen every day, but you're so salty I made an exception just for you baby &lt;3 feed me more of your indignation
---
Thank you! Lvl 310 started on beta...
---
Max Reputation with the Raiders, then buy it from Mortimer for Bullion. Then you need to craft it using Legendary Modules from the Purveyor.
---
Keep in mind, it CHEWS through Ammo. Ammo and the condition are the only downsides to it. It's naturally powerful, gains power the longer you fire, and has a built in explosive effect (Not as powerful as the Legendary Effect, but still juicy).
---
Oh yes I'm sure the desire to grief and farm reddit tears has driven many to suicide, a moment of silence, moment of silence over moving on.
---
You? No of course not, you’re nobody. Just like the rest of us. Kinda the joke of the post.
---
That’s what I’m saying. At no point have I competed with someone other than workshops. Even then, most PC players really don’t care what you’re doing.
---
Couldn't have said it better.  Exactly how I feel.
---
Dude it takes me so many shots to take down a normal charred ghoul with my ie shotgun even with demolition expert and shotgun perks on, what’s with that?
---
You are just making excuses. It's just the character. That's an excuse. You wake up at 3:00 a.m. just to make people angry on the internet, but it's just the internet. That's an excuse.
---
"I'm a predator and that makes you my prey".
---
if someone went back and read this shit allowed to you and it was the first time you were hearing it you would not be impressed with that person.
---
You think I'm "salty" but I'm actually concerned at this point.
---
You need professional help dude.
---
and I bet $10 that I'm not the only person in your life who's told you that you need some professional help and that you're too angry. and if they haven't told you it's probably cuz they're scared to tell you.
---
I think I'm going to have to stop responding now because you're just not ready to face any kind of truth, so I'm obviously just getting your back up. Your defenses are on high alert and you need to go make someone else miserable to make yourself feel better now... So I'll let you go as best I can.
---
There was a buff to heavy weapon damage and durability (and a slight nerf to their rof at the same time)
---
See, still desperately trying to make someone else unhappy.
---
Please share the idea amongst your friends. He built the camp/arena and it is essentially operational. Just need the people now.
---
The first rule about fight club is...
---
Your're right i change it. However you can stack this with ammo smith/super duper making you get ammo a lot faster than now.
---
Coming soon to an atom shop near you perk coins 500 atoms for a 100 get them while you can.
---
Bloodied deserved the nerf, but all the weapons/perks? Maybe not.
---
Anger has nothing to do with griefing friend. No one can take your happiness, you can only ever give that away, no one can make you angry if you don't let them. I grief because it makes me laugh, it causes me joy. There's no anger, only the sound of my laughter via comms.
---
Oh I feel that, performance in that menu is awful
---
I would like a new "sort" option, "most frequently used". Or maybe just a "custom" option, like favorites, but from within the pipboy instead of on a wheel. I like that you can rename weapons and armor and have them appear at the top or bottom of the list, but you can't do it with Aid items.
---
Agreed, its not what I want to do or waste time on.
---
I support the point you are making, but from my current perspective at level 42, no pun intended! I'm happy enough if I can face off against enemies who are not such a high level that I can't even get a shot off. Like the assaultron guarding the plane.
---
thank you for sharing this nugget of info. I haven't had time to look at conversion rates and efficiency. you just made my shotgun and lmg playstyle so happy! no more plastic scrounging! thank you!
---
Farming salty tears in a video game isn't a desperate attempt, it's just one of those things I casually do while chatting with my friends. Sometimes I just use my hitty stick. I met some of my best friends in game by pvping them and they talked good shit back.
---
Can i hoard the holotapes untill it gets fixed? Or can only have 1?
---
Hope Bethesda does a good job on the bot and it doesn't end up deleting everyone's legal gear by mistake.
---
Do you use vats? Instigating shotguns are "magic". It'll one shot the majority of things in the game but only in vats. Outside of vats all shotguns are useless really.
---
So I have found a solution to his problem. Had a few people try it out and it worked for them.  
---
When reloading the game, After you log out and log back in.   
---
Go to fuse box and insert fuse.  
---
Fast travel from within the building out of the building. (Open map and click on the medical center)  
---
After fast traveling, Re-enter the building and examine the blood.
---
Presto! Your frustrating annoying bugged quested has been squashed. Although I am not sure this will work for everyone but everyone that has tried it worked.   
---
Let me know!
---
While this is true, you wont ever oneshot a SBQ with a legit weapon.
---
we just got the hook up
---
Oh aight thanks for the help
---
It was a valid question, as there is only ONE sentence in this post.
---
Relax, you can't play same game over and over. Arm playing Tot War Troy and just hopping to do quickly easy dailies that take 15 minutes or 1 NW match. Even skip harder ones.
---
It happens to everyone
---
Ok. Still, you don't oneshot a SBQ with a legit weapon. That was a straight out lie.
---
No problem. Generally I'd say instigating explosive weapons counteract each other because if you shoot something and the splash damage hits another enemy you are not benefiting from the instigating stat on that next enemy, if that makes sense. Magic damage will be fixed eventually I'd imagine, but enjoy it while it's there.
---
Explosives are good for moving corpses.
---
I love your explanations as well as the perks. The first two are especially cool. I agree with you about energy weapons. They need a buff big time and getting rid of the legacy effect is a nice touch.
---
Kamikaze would be awesome. I'd love to randomly see players running into mobs and detonating. It'd be hilarious. Actually reminded me of the bombs in Final Fantasy games as well. 😁
---
Not from inside a room in his house 😂
---
That’s my point, the system forces you to play the game mostly every day if you want to complete the run, I completed the run but it killed my enjoyment of the game coming on every day to do my virtual chores. 😴
---
it’s a chore, it isn’t fun. and FOMO means it’s not a case of “just don’t do it”. Maybe make the grind fun instead of repetitive and don’t require people to play the game every day to earn cool stuff, maybe I wanna grind for 8 hours 1 day and then play none for the rest of the week, that would be fair but na it’s all about the bottom line man let’s be honest. 
---
💴 💴 💴
---
I'd love a jet pack for it.
---
I would make 1 silo a deathclaw nest. Where it's extremely hot and hazardous. You gotta sneak or go full blasting mode. Perhaps some flooded areas so people with aqua perk would feel useful. Add some natural caves interconected with main structures and voila.
---
After all reactor core should be hot place ideal for egg laying
---
Second Silo should be random enemy (scorched, mutants, raiders if you are with settlers or settlers if you are raider or BoS. And change layout a bit please.
---
Third could be with robots, just make it harder
---
The usual "Bethesda is evil, they will never do anything to make players happy", probably :-)
---
I think it would be nice if you could do previous day's (Daily) , like switch between days to finish the ones you missed or could find or bobblehead in time.
---
plasma casters use this ammo. that is the buff if you grind for it.
---
Well, I donated basically all of my cork. Only enough to donate 4 times. Guess I'll just keep the rest of my junk throughout this event. What a fkn waste.
---
Well great it worked out in the end! Enjoy your journey in the not so wasted Wasteland :-)
---
Read and listen to everything you find. Terminals, holotapes, notes, etc. The game began as a true wasteland: no NPCs to tell you the story, and so you had to piece together what happened, with whom and why. And I might even say when.
---
Exactly. Like if the dailys just never expired they just kept stacking, sure i’d have a lot of chores to do on day 7 if i missed day 1-6 but atleast i could lump it all in 1 day instead of across multiple days where maybe I wanna have a break off the game 👍
---
Explosive 50 cals are good for more controlled movement. I might start offering a service.
---
I'll be here to test on 😊
---
pointing*
---
Your objective was to call me an idiot and you failed to use the word properly.
---
Inspirational, lifegiver, stronger in numbers, serendipity
---
Already done plenty of testing lol.
---
fix it good and weapon artisan perks lets you repair to 200%
---
Or maybe devs should fix their game. And stop blaming innocent players not even abusing it?
---
I thought it might be for potential future content.
---
I LOVE petty shit like this! 
---
I went to help out some dude defending one of my workshops and he shot me in the back after I had told him I was fine with him claiming it, I just wanted the xp from the lil event.
---
I then stuck my stealth suit and just sat in the corner of the workshop so he couldn’t claim it, dude was pissed. 
---
We realised he’d actually claimed all the workshops in the server so 3 of us went and claimed different ones at the same time and basically would just fast travel and sit in stealth to stop him claiming them back. Ended up with him trying to kill us in scorched earth and him sending nasty messages, so fucking satisfying.
---
He also tried to get me to follow his YouTube
---
They are weapons that are no longer in the game's drop pool. Some are very overpowered, some are not very useful.
---
Example: dual- gives 2x the ammo capacity. The game currently has quad as a prefix, that's 4x ammo capacity. Makes dual useless. Dual is legacy now, you will find it on no drops.
---
Next example: explosive on energy weapons. Doesn't exist in droppool anymore. If you have it, you shoot explosive bullets that do more damage than other guns in the game, all other things being equal.
---
The amount of perk cards that have disappeared into the void, leveling up takes a lot of effort being almost 200.
---
Is honestly be fine if they deleted dupes too. Make everyone factually try to get decent weapons
---
This is so me 😂
---
I had someone do the same with the workshop. That's a good tip!
---
I hate griefers. I just think what is the point? He's still sat in his camp waiting and in the last 15 minutes, only one person has come. That's some waste of life.
---
Yea it's a fact that PvP in this game is an awful mess, especially the part about kiting others in.  I admittedly am not a fan of PvP in open world games, i just don't enjoy it. The main problem isn't even PvP players, but that there are, like you said, griefers and for some reason, they enjoy this kind of role play and WILL find a way to grief others.
---
I believe your solution would be ok, but I'm sure the griefers will find a way to abuse it (I'd have to see it in practice before diving into it).  As for the technical view, it probably would take a few if statements but i think the bigger issue would be the constant checks the game would need to verify all players current states.  Haven't programmed anything like this before so i couldn't tell you, but knowing how adding new code to existing code sometimes causes problems and how doing that specifically in this game has caused such problems, it could give us a much worse result.      
---
While my "solution" (which i created open endedly, so it was meant to be vague) would require a lot of work on the development side, it tries to satisfy both those who enjoy PvP and PvE players that actually enjoy workshops.  I'm not saying yours doesn't but I feel like the best compromise is the one where they were fully separated.  The only ones who don't benefit from this are the people who try instigating others (which i am ok with).  Also I'd feel like people would really like arenas (both PvP and PvE styled arenas).
---
As a side note, I'm not sure if  you knew this but you don't need to face turrets at the workshop bench, others can claim it by clicking claim as they walk into the area (thereby making nowhere safe really).
---
As for all the hate your'e getting, PvP has been nerfed too hard and too many times in this game that as soon as you mention any change (removals) in it, you will get attacked.  Also, I'm pretty sure a majority simply think that your solution is not needed in favor of the "just don't go to a workshop if you can't handle a fight" mentality. Obviously.
---
The truth of "It is done. It is nothing you can do."
---
I got the same bug and I read this. That is why I Lol'd.
---
I came back to the game 2 weeks after the season started and ATM I'm 5 spaces behind Zorbo. Not too bad.
---
You’re proving you’re an idiot by claiming a win over a fucking typo lmao what a loser.
---
I wrote that on the toilet while taking a shit, which is the only shit I give about pathetic FO76 fanboys who ride Bethesda’s dick no matter how shitty the game is.
---
I've also noticed that sometimes, in a public team, I'll share a perk card and the other person isn't getting the benefit.
---
I don't remember the exact case, but I was in a public team and everybody was on mic. I shared a card that should have had a pretty obvious immediate effect and everybody said they didn't see anything change.
---
if memory serves it was one of the cards that should have reduced weapon weight or something like that. I was trying to help the person get below a threshold so they could fast travel. And they did not already have the same card already equipped.
---
I've also shared the Sunkist maybe... The one that should have resolved somebody's rads while the sun was up. They were a lower level character who had just suddenly acquired a lot of rads and nothing happened.
---
To be clear they could see the card in their perk list, but the effect just wasn't taking place.
---
I'm just on this sub to make fun of people that are obviiusly in an abusive relationship with this game, but I feel particularly curious today: why the fuck are you still playing this steaming pile of shit? There are hundreds of fantastic games you could be experielcing instead if you weren't addicted to this low effort cash grab
---
Dont worry, I never read the treasury notes and thought they where only 1 gold. I've been converting my backlog of notes for weeks.
---
Muhauha 1* nocturnal rolling pins from lv 300 scorchbeasts here we come!
---
There’s not really anything else to do to be honest.
---
Also legacy flamers and cryos fire projectiles so have a massive range advantage.
---
Explosive energy weapons, flamers, harpoon guns, and cryolators are a few examples of weapons that don’t drop anymore. They are very highly sought after because you can’t get them unless you trade someone who’s been playing since the beginning or someone who has traded for it themselves. People just love the explosive weapons and some are extremely overpowered, I think a lot of people just want it because they can’t get it anymore
---
after getting the plan it will require 10 stable violet flux to build. whoop whoop whoom. chickens are pricy. and grinding ain't easy but it's necessary .
---
I would like to think they tried and came to the conclusion that they aren't technically able to do it, but I doubt that. That would be highly inept. So it might just be about money.
---
If people are spending money on eBay for weapons, then those people probably also spend money on F1st and atoms. That could be a reason why those people aren't scrutinized. After all, we live in a capitalist society where businesses are in trouble because of the pandemic. Also, I think the percentage of people that do this, is relatively small, so Bethesda might have weight the pros (money) against the cons (everything the comments are saying) and decided not to do anything.
---
Yes, I’m upto the same point. I only log on now to collect the treasury notes and if any events are on then I’ll participate.
---
I am a massive idiot. Scrapped my quad capacity pump shotgun.
---
Right? This is some Diablo II level goofiness.
---
Bubble turrets - floor, ceiling, wall. These look badass.
---
Solar power panels (5 units). (Vault) Super Reactor (100 units).
---
Bed of nails (literally).
---
Probably new wall signs like Doctor Ken's Chem Den, CentRal, Market, Mess Hall, Pier
---
Shooting gallery items (nothing exceptional)
---
Sympto-Matic (as mentioned in original post)
---
And that's all.
---
You need to learn how to tag.  Get a tesla or even a shotgun.  Do not use vats.  Soon as you see the legendary, spam attack.   I use an auto tesla which means I just hold down fire and point almost anywhere!  The damage arcs across mobs.
---
lol have a nice night dipshit, you won’t get anymore of that attention you are so desperate for from me
---
Hehe someone is either being very cheeky or has discovered fireworks!
---
Because some people are just dicks. 
---
I do UF for the steel and nominal XP. I don’t even bother trying to tag the leggos unless they spawn in the area I’m covering since they max out at level 40.
---
LoL bye bye you’ll me missed
---
Put some cream on that sore asshole, you’ll feel better :-)
---
Quad is not a legacy, double is, double gives double ammo capacity and no longer drops, but quad still drops so you’re okay!
---
It’s not a steaming pile of shit, it’s a good game at its core filled with mobile-like time gates and monetisation. And I think you’re the one in an abusive relationship if you follow a sub of a game that you don’t play...
---
Edit: quad pump is not a good trait!
---
I’ve got 42 levels saved and 0 perk packs. I’d also like to know the answer. Tagging myself into the tread lol
---
That's my biggest complaint with this game. They replace any sort of true endgame with massive grinds to unlock stuff followed by more grinds to actually get a useful version of the stuff.
---
I use Ultracite ammo for all of my weapons. Does that drop for kills?
---
yuh. I switched to ESO and so far having tons of fun, you can grind as much as you want (there are daily quests that give big boosts to faction-based experience, but there are slower passive ways to level them up and that’s unlimited) dungeons have guaranteed drop rates for good gear and you can repeat them as many times as you want to get the perfect setup (only took me a few hours to get 2 entire different sets on my level 25 tank). You can grind to your hearts content to turn your gear into a god roll version if you didn’t get a god roll, it honestly isn’t even that bad. Although i don’t have ESO+ yet, the rewards for having it put FO1st to shame. 
---
The “stash” (bank) is shared between all 5 (by default, can buy extra) of the characters you can have so transferring loot/currency is easy. 
---
And above all else it’s an actual MMO, not a cheap and rushed attempt at one.
---
edit: oh and i forgot to mention the #1 reason that made me stop playing FO76. You don’t have to endlessly grind to craft ammo just to play the game, because swords and staves don’t use bullets. Score. (no pun intended)
---
The Super Mutants in Appalachia aren't a natural phenomenon. :)
---
I don't want to spoil you so I'll leave it at that.
---
I posted this the other day:  
---
I think the worst is in nuclear winter. One card every level. 4 out of 5 will be duplicates and it costs way too many points to buy the cards you want.  
---
  
---
Also it's tied to your adventure mode level which is really stupid as a build in one may not be the same build you'd want in the other. So back to the grind on a fresh adventure character to get special points to be able to have the build you want in NW. Oops, now you've leveled up your overseer rank to 25+ and you are still missing the cards you want.
---
I strangely like NW and I normally hate these type of game modes. But it needs work.  
---
I actually really like the idea of perk cards in NW but having to reach level 165 to have the load out you want is too much.
---
Unrelated, but because of your post I can now understand why people would want a bigger stash. My opinion was always that everyone always wants more stash and that it's never enough. Give us 1000lbs and we want 1500lbs. And so on.
---
But I can now see how much space the lunchboxes, repair kits, scrap kits, etc take in my stash... So expanding stash size isn't just about, we just want to hoard more, it's also about, the game added so much stuff that we're running out of space.

I just asked this in another thread. All of my weapons use Ultracite.
---
Set of "paper targets" with "DR 150" abd DR 500" printed on them as buildable object...
---
Your funny, it is still broken and not a visual lost my weekly (this week) and two times half my dailies and yesterday all the dailies. 
---
So now I’m behind the green one, this grind sucks so bad. 
---
No even when I’m not in the game it fails even when I don’t play NW so
---
Used to be legendary before they remove that affect
---
True it is broken not just a visual glitch
---
Woow ok I’ll be in the lookout then if i get lucky and someone is selling on vendor
---
I have a 20 star handmade, want the krabby patty secret formula
---
Okay, I will say I'd like to see that minigun in action at least once.
---
Think ima see how the new Avengers game is at launch, I’ve pre ordered and I really enjoyed the beta for it but at the same time I enjoyed the beta for this, I definitely saw more problems in this at beta than with Avengers so hopefully it’ll be a good time investment.
---
It’s just a shame, because at its core there’s a really good game, poorly managed with time gates and boring grind. Even my friend said that aswell, and he’s one of those that despised the game at beta phase. 
---
Maybe i’ll give ESO a go though, I do hear really good things about it and it can’t be any worse than the chore system in 76. The only thing keeping me playing 76 rn is the camp building and even that is strangely basic... I mean who thought you’d want double sided walls, like it’s basic shit...
---
I dont run any builds and i enjoy the game just fine. Yeah sometimes it takes me 20 gatling bullets to kill something but so what?
---
You’ll have to go to the forbidden sub to find one of those, you have to trade an arm and a leg for explosive energy weapons
---
ahhh yes the risk of death is ... pressing respawn button  
---
no bloodied don't have any risk you will just respawn 10 m away from your corpse and kill everything faster
---
That’s because so many people don’t know how to run Rad Rumble.
---
You get three people to run ore while everyone else protects. When those three are done with a complete collection run each, they jump back into the fray and kill enemies. They drop their ore into the bin at intervals so that everyone has increasingly better/harder enemies to kill, with the last collector dropping theirs in about 10secs from the end of the event timer. 
---
Everyone gets to farm maximum XP and loot and the event never fails. It’s not that hard.
---
You can also use them right from your favourite wheel.....only just figured that out haha
---
Hi
---
Yeah i pre-ordered fo76 and that was the first game i had pre ordered since like... 8 years prior? And it’s the last game i’ve preordered since. 
---
ESO is having a free to play trial right now, idk if it’s on all platforms (i’m on ps4) and i think it’s only up for a few more days. But during the F2P trial it’s also 50% off ($10). So i highly recommend it. There’s home decoration in ESO but *that* is significantly grindy and/or expensive via IRL monies so, idk. I haven’t gotten into that part of the game yet, despite camp building being my fav part of Fallout as well. It’s got enough MMO-y stuff to do that i haven’t even cared to check it out yet lol.
---
I cannot agree enough.  this has gone on far too long.  Not only weapons but armors including legendary rings, legendary power armor, legendary freaking binoculars, the list goes on.
---
If it cannot have ever possibly dropped from an enemy in the game or a quest reward, delete it.  it's not rocket science.  and newsflash: .50cals don't have a beam splitter attachment ffs.
---
I do whenever i'm bored or waiting for a friend. I like the zeta invaders one.
---
Jesus Christ, you guys know that these are meant to be long term goals right 
---
You’re not meant to grind them all out in any short length of time
---
I don't understand why, instead of allowing us 5 characters with 800 lbs of Stash each, they don't give us a single Stash of 4,000 lbs shared across your account. Hell, even HALF of that would be incredible. And I'm SURE it would be less stressful on their tissue paper-like servers. Plus people could finally safely transfer their gear between their characters.
---
ah. damn.
---
Keep presents, just don’t let them drop caps. Simple. Make those 9M presents I saw sitting in a duper’s vendor the other day instantly useless.
---
Srsly? You could sell it for at least 5-6k ...
---
For the first two minutes. And then it breaks... :-)
---
How frustrating.  :(     My sympathy.  
---
I haven't seen many SE's lately, but then I've been spending less time in game too.
---
Have an upvote for the salty dude who downvoted you for scripting that.
---
Well the legendary run is fun to grind. Just depends on what you like to do.
---
On the legendary perk cards: you make it sound like you don't have a choice and that you have to scrap all your cards. Are legendary cards that powerful? Because it sounds like a good gameplay choice: scrap all your cards, focus on one build and get that build as powerful as can be with upgraded legendary cards. Or don't scrap all your cards, keep the ability to switch builds, but no build is as powerful as can be. This only works though when legendary cards are correctly balanced in this choice.
---
I enjoy gathering junk.
---
Well that's what it says.....
---
I haven't finished the run yet. I'm a few ranks from the end though...but damn I can't get myself to muster up enough energy to finish it.
---
Like I haven't logged on at all today to do my daily grind. And lately I've been leaving the "level up" one alone because I can't be bothered to grind out a level up anymore. It's just....UGH.
---
Really fucking hate this system they have now.
---
Weight reduction legendary does not affect mods, which add lots of weight
---
I just want to kill the Scorchbeast Queen and not receive an instigating rolling pin. I actually faught her last time and she was empty. Wtf. 
---
Far too often are legendary drops just a massive disappointment. Thank god for the exchange now but even then, a daily limit? Of only 150?? Bethesda need to overhaul this system. 
---
3* legendary enemies should drop only 3* loot. They should be tough as nails.
---
I imagine spiders would be a bitch to animate, but then we got the frostbite spiders in skyrim so...
---
Does this work with public teams also?
---
You are week 3 when the game wants you to be at week 7. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Are you a bloodied build?
---
Look at the numbers above, which are old and the run is actually easier now with 9 dailies a day (2.5k score for dailies now instead of 2k as the guide was using) and decide for yourself.
---
As a character with very high int + buffs and lunchboxes you can grind the weekly repeatable for 10k xp per 100 score.
---
How fast can you make 10k xp, and then do it again and again many times? Thats what you gotta decide.
---
I could have farted and got the ammo converter. that's why they made it so easy.
---
I don't think it'd be that tough for them. I mean most species sure, but tarantulas and shit? Nah, they'd thrive.
---
I dunno, up until these challenges i had never played NW and probably wouldn’t have if it wasn’t for the SCORE, which would have sucked for me ‘cause aside from the long ass wait times for a server, NW is a lot of fun
---
This is the point where you make your own entertainment.
---
Some people like camp building. Other people have made their own factions for rp purposes.
---
It all depends on what floats your boat
---
I'm very hopeful Cyberpunk is as good as it seems. Last night was the first night since April 19th that I chose not to play at all. I know it's directly related to the PTS debacle. I'm not even on PC, but it's just been so many things one after another where Beth just keeps showing us how little they're actually paying attention. 
---
How many of these wrong turns are we expected to ride through? I just want to love the game for being a good game, but they keep making all these awful changes. They're lightning fast when there's a new exploit that could hurt their bottom line, but they took, how many, 3 weeks to fix Adrenaline. It's not a great feeling when you realize you're just a source of revenue whose voiced concerns fall on deaf ears.
---
Hey, at least football season starts in a couple weeks. 🙂
---
Ah gotcha. Feels daunting, might just have to let this one go and focus on season 2 then.
---
TBH, I don’t really care about this in the grand scheme of things.
---
What REALLY makes me want to quit the game is forced leggo crafting with leggo modules dropping 1* garbage leggos when I use 100 scrip worth of leggo modules. Also, end game bullet sponge bosses (lazy ass design) dropping garbage 1* loot. UNACCEPTABLE. The fact this is even possible makes me want to cuff the devs in the back of the head repeatedly and yell, “HELLO?!? MCFLY?!?”
---
Bullets are not a problem. We have bullets coming out of everywhere.
---
We now have a way to change ammo, we have bullet making machine and the new operations enemies (and the new mega boss) drop ammo for the weapon you killed him.
---
How much more ammo do you need? Juicehead in his latest video even got more ammo than it took to kill enemies. And this was in the new PTS after nerf and one Wasteland.
---
Yes, this is a really good idea, especially because of the item transfer. But how would it be less stressful on their servers? Because in essence, every character that is online now has a stash of 4000lbs. That would only put more strain on the servers. Maybe they could instance the stash, so that it's seperate from the server?
---
Eh, those things are little bitches. Just get a mint mallet and learn to block, and you'll be able to slaughter them.
---
This comment right here is exactly what I'm talking about when I mention mental gymnastics.
---
He may not have hacked the game himself but the dude knowingly accepted not one but two HACKED weapons that don't exist in the game... 
---
That's essentially the same thing as him knowingly accepting stolen merchandise and saying he didn't do anything wrong because he wasn't the one who actually stole it. #Mentalgymnastics
---
The checks already happen all the time. This just changes what happens during the "contested" period. The instant a player tries to claim the already owned workshop, if the current owner is no PVP, and the attempted owner is PVP, the game just clears the old owner from the workstation instantly.
---
I had not known prior to this thread that you didn't have to actually find and touch the workstation itself. Someone else mentioned it. They said on the console you hold down the select button while you're in the potential area. That seems kind of weird as a design decision since that's the one time You suddenly don't have to approach an objective.
---
of course if everything were consistent this wouldn't be Bethesda hahaha.
---
I don't think a person can randomly PVP you out in the world if you are away from the workstation can they? I never even thought to ask the question. I was under the impression that it only enabled PVP during the contested period in the contest arena and makes no difference if you're somewhere else out in the world.
---
If somebody can PVP you up in the Northeast because you own a workstation in the Southwest that just doesn't make any freaking sense.
---
So like I said it's just a couple if statements, and only when it's deciding to establish the contest arena or not.
---
Indeed if you suddenly became the non-owner that would give you the moment necessary to turn on your PVP and decide to fight for it, and that would make my suggestion even a little bit better because no one would own it during the contest. The mass would still have to come down and go up again, but technically no one would actually be the active owner in that subsection of the scenario. So it would be like two people ran up to be unknown to object and only one of them managed to push the button to start with.
---
I get the part where they think I should just not use the workstations, but dude I paid full price for the game and the already fragile economy makes the workstations uniquely useful. I mean I set up my camp on a copper resource, so you can kind of do that out in the world. But if you just casually want to grab a whole bunch of acid or a whole bunch of fusion cores while you're grinding something unrelated like say lead, if you have to ignore the workstations then you're doubled disadvantaged.
---
My solution in turn lets you play or not play.
---
I know everybody else is salty about the fact that PVP keeps getting nerfed, but given how much work people have to do to trick people into PVP in the first place I can't see that it's a particularly popular feature outside of the vocal minority who do definitely support it.
---
As I've said elsewhere I think I've been instigated by maybe six people since the game was first released. And maybe two people tried to do the team instigating thing.
---
I mean I'm just a casual player but this is literally the first time anybody has interfered with one of my work stations where I noticed.
---
I think, looking back, did somebody tried to come after me and their power armor when I was up on top of the big mining machine. But I had set up a whole bunch of turrets just to deal with the moment who were in certainly show up as a defense event. So I accidentally killed the guy like twice before I realized I should just leave the area because the guy was being annoying.
---
He never occurred to me that he was actually trying to steal the workstation. I thought he had just accidentally shot one of the turrets or something.
---
PVP is really not a well integrated feature if it was that rare and that easy to miss what was going on, hahaha.
---
What anti-cheat? /s
---
Or you can just play normally and things happens when they happen.
---
Grind = Greed.
---
that's getting even worse with the damage changes as a lot of legendary effects have much less actual gain now for doing the horrible grind that is legendary farming
---
Well i think they can find middle ground between short period of time and 5-8years that will take for average player to grind them :V
---
THEY JUMP FROM TREES?!
---
Its less of an issue with the engine and more that theyre still using code from 2002.
---
They've just built onto of the old stuff and seems like every coder has just done things their own way.
---
So now when they go to fix something, there's no comments or note to what this line does, there's no standard naming etc....so one change has a ripple effect throughout the entire thing.
---
Doesn't help that throughout the years they've had to MacGyver their way (Train in Fallout 3 hat)
---
You should at least reinstall enough and progress enough to get the ammo converter. they may eventually make the thing more easy to use, but there's no telling when it'll be back.
---
If they finally make it reasonably uncumbersome it'll probably end up being quite useful. And it's the only thing that you'll never see again until they decide everybody gets it for free kind of deal.
---
This. Which means that Instigating - which completely relies on one-shot kills - is nerfed at least as badly as Bloodied, if not more. Also, the hunting rifle or pipe revolver with its armor piercing mags might just be better than the lever action rifle now.
---
So ...dont grind?
---
Don't mean to buzzkill, but it's just the way light is applied to certain glass surfaces in Fallout 76. It comes from your pipboy, not the Jangles helmet.
---
Edit: Ask someone to shine a colored power armor light on it, you'll see.
---
I can’t find it but I’ll look
---
Same map
---
I am not sure if the bait trick works. Now I've crafted a chunk following a botched spiking I'll find out soon enough when my would-be assassin is located.... His CAMP is gonna take a few hits.
---
Melting the queen can be done without hacked weapons you know. Certain legendary effects cause a cascade effect, making each hit deal significantly more damage than the last. It's a bug that has to do with how the game actually applies legendary effects to a target.
---
Seeing as how you can't even retroactively earn Treasury Notes.. Doubtful lol.
---
Hmmm. Is there a seperate options screen? I dont see any differences
---
If that's the case shouldn't they up the damage of missiles and fat man's then instead of nerfing all other damage? This update does not make sense to me
---
I've been testing almost every legendary weapon I get lately completely, unspec'd. It's been so much fun messing around, but most of the time it's quite noticably harder to use anything outside of my build when fighting even mid-tier enemies. I can't imagine how bad it's going to become for players who don't adhere to actual builds because they just like to play freely. They're going to suddenly be hitting huge difficulty spikes and probably get frustrated and quit.
---
And what about if i only use just health at 20% and perk cards? (Nerd rage, weapon perks like commando &amp; more) its still the same?
---
To the best of my knowledge hacked weapons are a PC exclusive problem. Duping exists on console though since most of it has to do with Bethesda bugs and not an external cheat.
---
Dont want this to turn like darksouls, though
---
Just a quick question, what's your recommendation for a bloodied one shoter to respec to, regarding the new perks and nerfs?
---
If you don't know that yet, then maybe you should wait for more information to be published. Because as of now, any builds are trash, once the updates hit.
---
What? Are you saying that a business company only cares about people who give them money? That’s pretty surprising
---
That's easily done even without hacked weapons. In fact he was probably legit. Shotgun builds can be super OP, especially with VATS.
---
......shit. I don't know why it said "switched" instead of "fix" soooo.....
---
all damage has been nerfed due to a change in how bonuses stack. even basic weapon perks are adding less damage.
---
Because Fallout 4 had them and Bethesda is lazy/inept and didn't change it for 76.
---
Welcome to the endgame of 76! Where you now can mindlessly grind for bullion, treasury notes, scrip and caps but only to the daily limit they've set up. Enjoy the tedious chore of logging on daily to grind.
---
Damn thats a shit, we are always dying cuz the 20% of health we deserve to have more damage to compensate lol
---
Oh well then your answer is no, I just used it and the keypad is still broken. But if you only want to use it so other players don’t mess with the switch then you’re good
---
That's the way it should be. These cards are op &amp; it should take a while to max them out.
---
This game sucks
---
If you are looking for a challenge, you could always try to solo a SBQ with your bare hands
---
It couldn't support multiplayer either, and yet here we are.
---
Fuck, *modders* got multiplayer on the *Morrowind* engine.
---
Game engines are infinitely mutable beasts. They will support *anything* at all as long as you put the programming time in.
---
Ladders, in this case, are a simple matter of it not being worth the time and effort to support: They could absolutely do it, but it's not worth it.
---
....wait what
---
Will this nerf they are bringing in the PTS reduce this cascade effect?
---
Hit me up with the FEV and turn me into a super mutant so I can terrorize newbies coming out of the vault. And I'll need a meatbag backpack too, thx.
---
Definetly. I started the imposter sheepsquatch event (not knowing it would start an event) and tagged it for 300dmg. After getting instakilled for 5min straight the sheepsquatch was dead without me getting any rewards, allthough i was the one who FUCKING STARTED THE EVENT.
---
Maybe people will now stop shooting the SBQ in the air and let her land making the fight quicker and easier. I welcome the changes. 
---
FYI: I’m junkies build. (and not even a good one)
---
I’m not sure right now do to the nerf coming to “make it easier to calculate the damage” so I’m just waiting to learn more about it. I am making other builds though not bloodied builds I could make you a bloodied rifle man if u want one.
---
&gt;All of their games are riddled with bugs
---
Fallout 4 was pretty bug free. It took *years* for the unofficial patch to break 1mb in size.
---
If it were a free game sure. We all payed for it from the get go, some people putting hundreds into it at the start.
---
When I first started playing, I thought I was stuck picking a perk in the special stat I raised after leveling up. This is not true. You can, for example, raise strength and then pick a perk in luck.
---
Two days
---
To be fair the grind starts when you're past level 50 and isn't something a new player should be worried about.
---
What? What issue are you asking if it got fixed or not
---
Just start playing oldet fallout games most of 76 Players have never played then and just watch lore vids
---
I'm level 189 and I average about 1 level a day that's in a 2 hour play session, I still feel like the game is meant for casual and hardcore players. Bethesda wants you to log on and do dailys and get scrip and that. They know there playbase, it's a mix between people who grind for stuff early or people who play casually the legendary run is a perfect example of them knowing that. You can complete most of it by doing dailys or you can do what other players did and grind out the Repeatable EXP score and that's why i still feel as though the game caters towards those casual players
---
There isn't a whole lot to spoil. I've already seen the vats. The creators aren't really great at big reveals. When I stumbled onto White Springs, it took about two seconds to know what it was because it's based on the Greenbrier Resort, which IS home to a cold war bunker built by the DoD and Army Corps of Engineers to serve as the new seat of power in the event of a nuclear war. It's like a fortified backup for the Capitol Building, but with living quarters. My understanding is that the resort itself is pretty swank. The Greenbrier Resort even looks just like White Springs, except Greenbrier is MUCH larger. I remember a History Channel documentary from the 90's on the construction of the DoD's portion of the resort.
---
I haven't even gotten to or read anything about what's under White Springs, though a little while ago someone mentioned something about Enclave being there. It's not a shock to me, even though I'm not there yet in the game.
---
edit: Oh, actually, they're just calling the resort "White Springs" in the game. It's quite literally the same resort, located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. I'm guessing that at some point between Fallout 76 and Fallout 2, "White Springs" would have to be destroyed (or otherwise compromised). It's the only reason the capitol would be moved to a deep sea oil platform in the middle of the Pacific.
---
Thanks for this feedback, and Serums are indeed prime example to describe the approach to pricing. From what I gather, by your understanding of our approach, we'd display something like: 200-500 caps, but some buyers could pay over 1000.  
---
It's not like this. What we'd say for serums would be: Serums can be sold to vendors for 300-500 caps to vendors, which serves as guarantee for their value. Price them around 200-300 if you want them gone quickly and are okay with having your stock depleted by one buyer. Price them around 400 if you want to have decent selection for players that'll buy at most 1, for their personal usage.  
---
Price is as much as a buyer is willing to pay. There are items where 'average sales price' is giving a false impression, because while there ain't thousands of players actively looking to get that item and pay 5x average sales price, there are still dozens who do. We try to capture that - worse, better - it's living and evolving system updated multiple times per week, it's bound to have mistakes, but we learn from them :\]  
---
Experienced traders who are able to establish their own prices through negotiations and relationships might be joking, but there are thousands of players without the knowhow needed to repeat pro's effectiveness, whose unobvious godrolls aren't getting scripped anymore and are entering the markets instead, and there are hundreds of thousands of scrip fodder items that didn't flood the markets because of this tool.  
---
Despite the presence of cynical voices, the support we receive is tremendous, more than enough to fuel the aspirations to work continuously on updating and improving this service.
---
Good call
---
Nice. As for a game which claim to be revolutionary mmorpg, which cost about 40euros and got monthly payment :D
---
I'm out then ::
---
I've always read the keypad pylon still let's randoms mess with the switch. Your saying they can't. That means they fixed it?
---
Napkin Math, but not including the Double Score or Bonus Week stuff you'd end up just above level 75 if you do all dailies and weeklies til the end. To hit 100 you'd need something like 8 million XP grinded.
---
atom shop
---
Yup, you're the only one who's special. *Everyone* else plays junkies and bloodied, all 400k+ of us
---
yes
---
They've only bailed out one which was clearly a fuckup on their part judging by the amount handed in. It would have failed immensely. Failing by a few thousand, on the other hand, suggests the failure was down to the participants so they made the right call. If they just bail out any that looks like it won't meet target then what's the point even bothering?
---
Yeah, hard pass on that.
---
Until we really know what changes and what perks are comming, working for a build with soon to be obsolete information is just not that smart in my books.
---
I dont run a  build either. I have some legendary gear, but I play just to have fun. Micromanagement is not fun
---
Yes! Also let us become ghouls. It's about time I'd say. I mean, I get that we can't because of the storyline, but it would be cool.
---
The 60$ (or less if you bought the game on a discount) you paid already gets you plenty of base game content and guarantees free future DLC. I don’t want to defend Bethesda because they still do a lot of shady bullshit but you shouldn’t feel entitled to get everything for buying the game, after all Bethesda is a business and it’s their job to make money in every way possible
---
Honestly, it’s best to not even touch dailies in games. Games should be played for fun. If you’re not having fun doing dailies, why are you doing them then?
---
Oh I thought you’re talking about the glitched keypad bug, my bad. 
---
I don’t know if they fixed that one or not unfortunately
---
Maybe people will stop doing these events which are consuming ammo
---
Oooof.
---
Enforcer
---
I don't exactly agree cause then you'll have players spawning in at the last second to grab the legendary item when they haven't helped at All in the event ???
---
It works on weapons as well. If you take it three ranks you'll get double the shots from each core
---
Thanks a lot, I just started the download, it kind of doesn't make sense not to put that in the specified "select version/beta" and when I did google it all I found was stuff about needing invites and so on.
---
I will now see how fucked my unarmed character really is and I am genuinely scared.
---
Do you remember what it was called by any chance?
---
They arnt nerfing bloodied specifically
---
They are nerfing everything, but because bloodied relies more on stacking its getting hit the hardest
---
I play 76 like I play 4 or even how I use to play Skyrim. I sneak and made my build around that, this game isn’t so hard that getting every drop of damage or damage resist is necessary. It’s cool if peeps wanna get into the stats and try to max it butYou play the game the way you want.
---
You guys think I should hold onto all my nocturnal gear from now on? Maybe invest two levels into revenant? Or just sell the farm for a duped legacy? Asking for a friend.
---
Your "solution" is to limit the playing experience of a different group of players who paid the exact same price. If all you want to do is play a junk farmer, maybe 76 isn't the game for you.
---
Me and my group picked it
---
Up with game pass and have had to deal with sweats constantly bagging all Leggies without a thought for the people who were here. My gripe is with one violent night me and my friends filled the noise bare up only for a level 213 coming and clearing the area with a Tesla rifle
---
Yeah there really ain't anything else to the endgame and I doubt they'll ever add actual new questlines and such and instead add more events to grind such as the daily ops they're adding which just seems like a reskin of vault 94 raids which in it self was just another grind. The end game of this game is pretty much non existant.
---
They don’t need to nerf weapons they need to buff enemies resistance
---
Unless you pay, yes.
---
It's a separate game you'll need to download entirely. You'll have to search for Fallout in the Bethesda launcher, and in the list of titles that comes up you should see the PTS
---
We still do the most damage of any build... All build types will deal slightly less damage.
---
I’m a hybrid between bloodied and TSE, I run bloodied when I’m soloing events or in a location with high level enemies but I use TSE everywhere else.
---
 76 is the only fallout where I used a specific build with a specific weapon, usually I’m neutral and mix my perks so I can play with as many weapons as possible which is what I like about fallout, the variety of weapons 
---
If you don’t want to have a dedicated build, I recommend sticking with TSE. they don’t require you to be on low health or he addicted to chems and they still give you a sweet damage boost for free
---
At least you're honest 😂
---
I'm grinding the purveyor and mobs of all levels for stock so I can open a western themed shop that sells nothing but legendary wheel guns. I'm going to call it Big Iron.
---
Fair enough might as well, im an unarmed build but I can at least sell the ammo
---
Im not coming down on either side of this as it'll just be a massive shit show
---
However i can 100% tell you that they are not going after bloodied specifically
---
Every build is being affected, just some more than others
---
They need to be opened before you can trade the unused cards in, no gain/benefit leaving them unopened.
---
That will have the same outcome, buffing enemy resistance or ending weapon damage means you’ll need to hit them with more bullets in both cases
---
People be moaning about everything on this game literally have you tried running a fucking FPSMMO (I’m coining it as such) during a pandemic?
---
Yeah I hate the nerf and I’m pretty sure of it happens bad things will happen but I get where your coming from
---
Bloodied is indeed very popular. It is hard to resist the overwhelming bonuses it provides. I play F76 daily and 90% of people I encounter in public teams have maxed out rads... Maybe after the update we will be finally released from the bloodied chain :D
---
Take it easy, they’re not game changing to a point you have to no life wtf is everyone’s problem ?
---
Yep but people won’t give a sh*t show since their dmg doesn’t change
---
Don’t play to grind it’s not Fucking EVE mate
---
Thats what I thought. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Yeah it's still more 20-30% roughly but the main improvement is it brings all the damage stacking builds inline with other builds.
---
Basically all damage bonuses are additive and not multipliers.
---
It sucks because I'm always getting one taped from hight level enemy's especially if they have a star.
---
Well the problem there is that melee should be a viable class of weapons not just something you are forced to use because the ammo grind gets too extreme due to bullet sponge enemys
---
I just wish people would nuke other places than just Fissure Prime.
---
That's all I ever seem to see now.
---
They made all damage sources (as far as I'm aware) additive. Due to how DR is applied this actually makes the game *significantly* easier to balance. I'd give it a bit to wait for the eventual tuning pass.
---
That's a whole other corporation issue though. Bethesda has become one of those developers like EA that turns what should be a £30-40 game into £60-70 with micro transactions and premium/vip subscriptions. There are other better games out there that are free that people are happy to spend £100 a year on in micro transactions and DLC, like SWTOR.
---
You think that he put a bideo of that happening in his yt?
---
So they nerf damage and now what if we max out legendary perks we can get it back to what it is currently?
---
It’s bloody ridiculous, he ended up following me all around the map before I just dipped servers.
---
I checked out his YouTube in the end and it looks like he is just a griefer
---
Why does it even matter? People are upset because they are going to do lower damage to enemies. If Bethesda keeps the weapon damage the same and buff enemies instead you’ll still need to hit them more, it doesn’t change anything
---
The scorchbeast queen is only going to get much harder if she still doesnt get crippled
---
Because you have to do the dailys to progress the score system to the end where all the cool cosmetics are unless I want to buy the levels with real money?
---
How do yall get the stealth armor? Do i have to side with the nice people or soemthing?
---
I don't get why they would put an awesome bit of kit like the fatman in the game then make it as useful as a wet rag
---
Its kinda funny at first, but when you're trying to fight the queen and your screen won't stop shaking because some asshat thinks its funny to rain down orbital strikes on the queen, then you might change your mind.
---
This is preety much the definition of cancer in gaming nowadays. Fo76 isn't alone with this issue. It's a trend to put boring long grinds for mediocre rewards instead of good content.
---
And carry a weeks worth of legendaries?
---
I didn't know that either I'm lvl 340
---
If the rewards aren't great for an increase in effort ie taking more time and ammo, then this may be a possibility.
---
They need to increase the decent drops for these boss creatures otherwise we may see a decrease in these event happening.
---
Depends on how severe this damage nerf effects players, we may be exaggerating the situation and in fact  not notice the difference....only time will tell when they get implemented
---
How exactly does it limit the play experience of another player? It prevents griefing, yeah. But no one enjoys griefing but the griefer.
---
- Two people who want PVP unconditionally get fight each other exactly the way they can today.
---
- One person who wants PVP and attacks one person who doesn't gets denied, instead of getting to grief the guy who doesn't want PVP.
---
- everybody else gets to challenge, and the person being challenged gets to accept or flee without having to swap servers.
---
The only person who is denied is the person who thinks making other people unhappy is a good thing.
---
The game could alternately offer away for people who don't want to PVP to still be able to collect all those resources, but it doesn't. So the economics of it are disparate
---
They know, they just doesn't need anything but exp and loot, that simple
---
Ignore the legendary perks and play the game.
---
Also the legendary perks need to be a bit broader in what they provide. Why do I have to wear a matching set of armour just to get some extra poison resistance? Can't I just have it without needing a full set? They are legendary perks after all
---
The daily limit is pointless.
---
All the daily limit does is make you have to go to the purveyor every single day to maximise the profits from it.
---
If it was a weekly limit then you would only have to go a few times a week to maximise the profits.
---
I hope this breakdown helped you understand it.
---
Edit: oh and don’t forget having to go to foundation and crater daily, the treasury notes machine daily, scrip machine daily, daily daily daily...
---
So, born severely malformed from genetic damage received in utero?
---
I agree there should be no cap it’s fucking annoying having to log out cause I script like 3-4 weapons and have to wait for the other 14 😂
---
Sorry I didn’t explain better.Many people will be in love with their build and dmg is something their proud of,if this is change people will get angry but if enemy resistance is increased people will be less angry
---
My friend has a mini nuke mini gun and it can make the screen pure white
---
Because it's Todd, you know it wont right?
---
Contemporary House Set
---
Well yeah I won’t deny that Bethesda are greedy and shady as fuck but I don’t blame them because it’s their job to milk our pockets. I blame players for purchasing atoms and support their greedy moves. 
---
But I still think that 60$ is a fair price for the game. Aside from the 76 thousand bugs it has, it is still a good game with plenty of content and a huge world to explore that can keep you occupied for hundreds of hours. Not to mention that any storyline or world expansion DLC is free, so there’s guaranteed free future content that you’ll receive aside from the base game content. 
---
So if you don’t mind the bugs, you’re getting your moneys worth if you spend 60$ or less. EA doesn’t do that because they sell you a crappy game with a storyline lasting for a day or two and you’re done with the game
---
If you're interested in the details, here they are:
---
Each item and effect is attributed three numerical values. pcDemand, consoleDemand, nicheDemand. These numbers reflect base demands for given items/effects between PC players, Console players, and freaks who might like just that very much. To get base 'PC price', all these pcDemand attributes are multiplied.
---
Further, there are certain items that enjoy/dislike certain other effects. Furious is pointless on blackpowder weapons. Teslas simply love Quad. There is a layer of calculations where these relationships between an item and effect are described. Previously, these columns were hardcoded. Currently (in V2) they can be defined dynamically. The data that colors the effects on the website as green/red/green+red is placed here.
---
Next, there is a combo layer. There might be specific desired combination that spans between multiple effects or certain effect combination on given item, that should be processed differently. AA25250 50cals price hits glass roof because of The Last Word quest reward. Ultracite explosive gatlings are all hacked-in. People love B/SS/S items. Swingspeed weightless shishkebabs are valuable as healing tools even if they are nocturnal. The data that colors the effects on the website as blue, as well as lots of text information is stored at this layer.
---
pcDemand, consoleDemand and nicheDemand from those three layers are all multiplied and the result (single value per each xDemand) is then processed further. Afterwards, there are three more layers of processing that only generate texts.  
---
The process of calibrating the tool is based on adjusting the numbers until given combination hits where it should be. Most players focus are 2\*+ weapons and 3\* armor - these were tested way more than 1\* were.
---
Bloodied will still be the most effective build, it just won't be ridiculous anymore.
---
Exactly. I thought you was questioning it but you agree so sweet 🤣
---
Because its open ended?
---
Since you've seen the vats you've been to West Tek. Did you read the terminal entries?
---
Same for Huntersville. The story about how mutants became a thing in Appalachia is, interesting, to say the least.
---
So there's no plot?
---
So you're saying "Bethesda: delete other people's dupes not mine" am I right?
---
Ps4
---
Yeah then you need to run more endurance and damage reduction perks
---
Yes we may exaggerate the situation but I’m also stating that the reward of flux is not enough to cover the ammo I take now lol and I can’t imagine how hard my stash box cries if they nerf my damage lmao
---
Given that it's Todd.  No, why would you even need to ask that.
---
Anything that would benefit the player like that would never happen.
---
Well I don’t know about these people you’re talking about but if I care about the amount of damage I deal then I’ll be angry regardless of Bethesda making my gun weaker or make enemies stronger because both of these equate to me using more bullets to kill these enemies
---
Whats 1 and 2 on? Ps1?
---
They must have serious problems because you wouldn’t want to deter people from playing an online game. 
---
Unless.. Beth are true pioneers and have successfully made an MMO that sort of limits you, saving people like me from unemployment and a lifestyle that could be compared to that of a Crackhead..
---
RE: One Violent Night: when someone starts that shit, I suggest everyone just stop playing, turn off the jukebox, and then make a barrier around the jukebox so that the 213 has almost nothing to shoot at as the spawns drop off to almost nothing. Punish the bastards for being greedy.
---
I do my endurance is at 33 with perks n I still get one hit sucks but I also think it's my mutation because I have all of them because I thought I was cool running all mutations somethings wrong with my build but I'll fix it lol
---
I just play a mixed rifle/shotgun build with VATS for extra damage. Rifles work decently for trash and damage from a distance, while my shotguns pretty much one shot most stuff apart from bosses. Good fun.
---
Yeah only reason I’m angry is that I use bloodied unarmed and it received the worst nerf
---
Takes a Month to grind a whole drum of Ammo tho right for balancing issues and the explosive damage still negates into the void 😂?
---
We failed by about 140 million
---
Strange in numbers
---
Didn’t know about that we got the bar filled up and the guy came swooping from the shadows like some loot ninja batman ngl was salty but got another chance at the event and enjoyed it
---
Maybe everyone will resort to using harsh language
---
No, they rather nerf all damage...
---
Also. not everyone uses guns that eat ammo. My gauss shotgun is very ammo friendly.
---
I‘d like to see they add eggs to the chicken coop and milk to the Brahmin pen.
---
What does TSE stand for?
---
I have had this happen twice now with the spawn right on top of the emitter. Lots of fun but really weird and kills my frame rate!
---
Some people will always be like that. You can either seethe about it, or you can run the event correctly so that your people get a chance at all that XP and loot as well. You can't control what other assholes do, but you \*can\* maximize what you and your people get out of it.
---
Hey! Me, too! 🤜💥🤛
---
It's very dependent on the item, there are multiple cases where it outputted vastly higher discrepancies (not x3 but x8). There are items out there that public opinion wouldn't price above 10k that will score legacies if you market it before right people. That was causing confusion tho, so was reworked and now gives less numbers and more text in that line.
---
Yes in the mire they do, specially if You are walking on the highway (for this reason i Always walk along railroad or in forest)
---
Can you hurt the SBQ if she doesn’t land?
---
I'm not planning on doing bloodied or junkies on any of my four characters. My highest level is 110 and I'm doing fine running around with a combat shotgun and deathclaw gauntlet. I know what I want to do with my characters. One shotgun/melee. One sneak/sniper. One science weapons guy. One two handed/rifle guy. No plans beyond that for making it too complex.
---
Yes and they do a lot of damage, every time i saw Them i attack only with sniper weapons
---
I haven't played in a while - can someone fill me in I feel I've missed something (I'm aware of the legendary perks but not the grind)
---
As for what I want to play, I'm playing the story not a junk farmer.
---
I'm reading all the terminals, listening to all the tapes I can find, not using any guides so that I can discover by myself what there is to discover.
---
I'm enjoying the scenery. I haven't fast traveled since I first went over my weight limit, I actually walked through the map.
---
I sneak. I developed technique. I've helped other people find enjoyment. I've teamed up with people to accomplish goals.
---
I'm playing the game as if I and the other volt dwellers had actually spent 25 years together learning to work as a team, which is the actual conceit of the game.
---
I'm enjoying the artwork. I'm finding better ways to kill monsters. I'm experimenting with different kinds of weapons and builds instead of men maxing one particular stat and one particular style.
---
And yes I'm hoarding the hell out of a lot of stuff.
---
In short I'm role-playing.
---
If all you're doing is following the compass or trying to shoot other players I suspect my experience might be richer than yours. Even if your experience is equally as rich we're clearly not after the same thing.
---
What exactly do you think someone gets besides the joy of giving grief when they attack somebody who's literally 1/10 of their level? I'll tell you what he got in this case, six bug parts total. If that. And the satisfaction of giving me grief...
---
I've never even understood griefers, or for that matter dupers or anybody who plays video games in any of the "degenerate" styles.
---
And I'm not against PVP in games where PVP is the actual point. They used to play a lot of unreal tournament 2004, and I still occasionally play a bunch of Planetside 2 which is nothing but PVP. And I fought mobs and players in elite dangerous.
---
The PVP in this game is broken bullshit that has no attraction for me. Telling me to just ignore an entire fraction of the economy in a game I paid for because it's got _crappy_ PVP It was kind of stapled on as an afterthought, is subject to massive inequity, and doesn't go with the actual plot seems a little putative.
---
The silos should give you direct access to the control room for every subsequent visit once you've successfully cleared and launched from them. 
---
Having them do a full reset is lazy and most of us glitch the silos anyways because they're so boring.
---
One Wasteland with its highest possible level spawns might shake things up a bit but most definitely not for long.
---
Give us an option to acquire a nuclear football as reward for launching from all 3.
---
Instigating full health stealth build does me just fine.
---
Though to embrace the dark side of bloodied is to know true power. When you line all the perks and uny up, it can't be denied.
---
But anyways YES- you don't need a full meta build to blitz the content right now.
---
Use the jetpack to counter it
---
Quad weapons can still be acquired. Its double that can't be found anymore
---
I agree with that, there is a good game there, but it seems like all the new content since wastelanders has been geared around grinding daily event's or quests that you just repeat until you get the rewards. No new story has come since wastelanders, an so far the BOS entrance and story has been the worst grind of them all, I can only hope that there will be story or something new when they get here, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was just a base full of tin cans that tell you to go do repeat missions until Bethesda brings out the next bunch of repeat missions for them with no real story or substance.
---
You only have to work with the settlers up to a point. Don't have to side with them if you don't want to
---
Anyone that thinks this was too much at once or gives no period for adjustment or anything like that should take a look at what other games have done.
---
Take Warframe for example.  In less than a year they upended their combat system... twice.  First redoing how melee weapons work from the ground up to the point you didn't even move the same way while attacking or even have the same attacks while rebalancing over 300 weapons and THEN reworking how EVERYTHING in the game dealt damage with a total rework of their base damage and status types.  There were community resources that took months to catch up to all the changes and some that still haven't come back.
---
Compared to that we've got what?  Everything's essentially  the same as before except everyone's just doing less damage?
---
I already appeal twice. just "Nope" reply. I'm going to unsub this and post somewhere else.
---
pretty sure thats actually broken right now. something is wrong with the unarmed numbers.
---
I dont care about pvp
---
It's never actually worked for me either, I think you have to be right next to your team, and even then the rank one card only gives you a small amount, so it's more of a meme than anything.
---
🤟
---
I dont like using exploits unless theyre kind of realistic, so i just use the one where you get past the crates blocking the corridor because in reality i could squeeze through that gap
---
Yeah EVE actually has a working economy and a decent value for players time.
---
So in that regard you're right fallout 76 is awful.
---
When everything is grinding what's left to actually play?
---
A lot of ppl still do but I respect your opinion dude.
---
I have got one but I'm abit anal and don't like how it looks, plus I like to be different. Turned into a bit of cliché having a jetpack.
---
I’ve read this multiple times however I still don’t trust this information 😆
---
i'm level 59, i have worked my ass off in this game andi still feel like i have made no progress. i'm still scrounging on miscellaneous armor pieces that i have found from the world, i'm still using the excavator PA you get from the questline, i still have to resort to using melee weapons (and not even the good kind it's just combat knives and machetes all the time), i constantly get stuck on the boss of the dungeon because i run out of resources every time i get to them. i just wanna build shit and slaughter enemy mobs and i feel like this game is actively preventing me from doing it.
---
only way for me to return to this is either if i find decent cheats or if todd adds actual pay2win mechanics (like resource packs and so).
---
They've changed all damage, stop saying bloodied just to stir controversy.
---
😂😂 that’s funny
---
Bloodied saw the greatest nerf that's all i wanted
---
That's good to hear. My feeling of self-worth has now skyrocketed to new levels! I AM special, just like my mommy said! I'm a good boy mommy, see? Mommy, please listen to me. Mommy, is the mailman hurting you?
---
Another 1/2 hour I reckon.
---
Bro I just hit lv 213 it's gon be awhile till I hit 250 , if it happens it happens kinda deal
---
Are you playing on xbox? I used to have a lot of disconnects on xbox. Play on PC now as I got fed up of it.
---
That Underarmor can be upgraded for +4 strenght .. (Carry Weigh Increase)
---
so i Recomended BUY
---
Wait...they dropped legendary perks?
---
I feel this way about this sub a lot. Everyone seems to know stuff about the game I've never seen. I'm still wondering about this resource BoS deal. Where does the game explain this stuff?
---
I don't *see* that many peeps wearing it..... ;)
---
Thank you. Thank you. I'll see myself out....
---
TBF I agree with the nerfs they are thinking of rolling out.
---
The Meta in this game is WAAAAAY to strong.
---
You can't have people running around one shooting people in power armor just because of a build.
---
That's terrible game design and balance.
---
I just hope that after the Nerfs balance things out they start doing blanket buffs to make everything better.
---
They just copy and pasted a large majority of fallout 4 legendary effect list into 76 and you can't do that when they are so much different.
---
I'm neither Bloodied  or Junkies, I'm a clean living kind of dude (despite my tag) I have no issues wiping out enemies, even on PTS post nerf :-)
---
I absolutely agree. 
---
A weekly limit on all of these would be better for all. 
---
I don’t actually feel like I have time to play the game how I want, like vendor hopping, xp grinding, or my personal favourite finding PA parts to put as many PAs together as possible  putting jet packs on them and finding random mid to 50 level players and doing a quiz for them to win it. 
---
I feel like since all this daily grinding nonsense I’m seeing much less of the following: 
---
- Random RPers making the game infinitely awesome
---
- Less interesting interactive camps made solely to interact with players 
---
- Less people actually playing casually and meeting each other in game. 
---
Once I’ve hit my daily limits I’m annoyed at the game and I switch off, I’m now really finding it hard to want to play as it feels around the same as having to clean the house. 
---
Plus starting Dishonoured 2 didn’t help
---
I’d love Weekly limits, do one big grind and then the rest of the week just be a rando actually exploring large areas of the map that in the 200’s in levels I still haven’t been to and are greyed out on the map.
---
Dense for the chest, butressed everywhere else, although my unarmed build uses brawler on the arms
---
I was on a level 5 weapon mule when some level 20 came up to me and dropped me some food and water, which I actually needed on that character. I thanked him in a message then 5 mins later he came back and dropped me a full set of armor, stims, and a couple of cheap common outfits. But just cause he was being really nice and trying to help me out I figured I mind aswell try to help the ol chap out myself. So I dropped him a TSE Gat Plas (before the latest dupe). We ended up getting in party chat for a while and he was freaking out saying he'd never thought a lvl 5 would ever have a weapon like that and how he'd treasure it forever. It was pretty cool to see how happy I could make someone with something as simple as an item in a game. Anyways, moral of the story is help the damn low levels ppl!! Never know what they might have. Have a nice morning and day 😁
---
Still not Fixed ?
---
I prefer Furious in Power Armor with Heavy Guns. I get to mow things down and be stupid tanky, but still get a big damage boost with no downsides.
---
In need of replacing and causes massive political disputes anytime mentioned?
---
That is one way, the other is to buy it for around 2k bullion.
---
They do my friend uses Ultracite ammo and he said they dropped the ammo for him
---
I've been waiting on deep pockets myself.
---
Sell them at face value in the vendor they will disappear fast
---
Yeah, I read them and was like they’re basically like existing ones and it just isn’t...exciting or new.
---
Pc :) you should be able to find them on steam
---
What about cushioned or sleek for the legs?
---
Remember to always buy a level when you get 150 atoms because it’s basically like the hop forward one square chance card in monopoly 😅
---
Exactly what I thought “ what about all those duplicated cards that just banished because I already had  1 of each level “ because thats when the cards just banish like if it was nothing at all.
---
So if they fudge the numbers they're cheating bastards and if they don't fudge the  numbers they're still cheating bastards?
---
They lowered concrete because it was LITERALLY impossible at the values they first set because there are only two sources of concrete in  the entire game, limited static spawns and resource extractors.
---
Cut the fucking conspiracy theories.  First we had idiots whining that this entire event was fake and nothing but a PR move with an auto completing counter so they can show off how many people "play"  the game and now we have you whining that somehow the entire fucking event is just a giant scam to dangle free score points in front of everyone and then snatch them away and laugh at people that had bugged dailies.
---
Want to know why this leg of the event would have failed?  Because most people don't give a shit about the extra score.  Most people are either finished, about to finish or have weeks left to get tens and tens of thousands of points without even needing a bonus weekend.
---
For the arms, I'm thinking deep pockets for sure as not a melee or unarmed build. For the legs I'm not sure
---
Super duper
---
Hi, English its not my native language i must use translator, so its hard for me.
---
I create VIDEO for you ..  https://streamable.com/6l7xh9 for share with Bethesda Supports i hope that help ..
---
With 1200+ hours, 5 different style characters 3 of which are around level 250 I can tell you that there is a lot you can do.
---
But if you consider that you’ve finished and you can’t find anything else to do then have a break
---
He hasn’t yet, but I keep checking!
---
You’re joking right ?
---
I had spent half an hour powering and protecting the Rockhound when some asshole claimed the workshop and kept annihilating me whenever I tried to take it back.
---
I waited until the event was about to end, took the elevator to the top of the Rockhound, jumped off the top and bolted it to the ore hopper, picked the lock, took everything I'd mined, fast travelled to my base and placed it in my stash.
---
I then went to another workshop I had and the asshole appeared, killed me, destroyed everything I'd built then left.
---
Two Shot explosive, it's a legacy weapon type
---
Dam so its bugged omg .. i destroy and again build my house because i thinkink i place my CAMP to tree .. :/ i hope fix this soon ..
---
I’m full health commando with a furious handmade and quad fixer as main weapons. Also use a two shot gauss mini gun for SBQ.  Seems to work well for me but I’m always looking to improve it.  I don’t really wanna go bloodied or junkies.
---
Bethesda create Item and add to Atomic Shop bud does not work .. this CAMP Skin for example or .. Camo Secret Service Underarmor too .. cannot be modified .. New things does not work :D
---
She is!
---
Chiming in here, it’s one of the best selling packs, so it’ll probably make its way back around sometime. Just keep an eye in the camp section.
---
Instead of legendary perk, just revamp all skill system. Swap perk skill for crafting, lockpicking, hacking is time-wasting.
---
I went with sleek (the one to move fast for sneak) for legs but I don't feel much faster...
---
And yes of course buttressed. Best resists. Iirc you can have a utility mod and a damage resist mod?
---
I rolled one leg as damage reduce on fall for jetpack and never die from falls
---
If it’s balanced right it’s fine but if it’s standing there for 25 minutes unloading your entire arsenal that is just boring gameplay. 
---
This is why multi stage events are much better. Take out the vocal chord to stop it summoning minions, kill the minions, then kill the collossus etc. 
---
Make it challenging for different reasons not just infinite HP. 
---
This was my problem with the endgame in Skyrim until they rebalanced it, it was unrealistic for me to put 100 arrows into a human body before they died, I’d rather the highest difficulty make me die quicker and put a proper dodge/cover mechanic in. 
---
This I never expected to say, but the highest difficulty in the new Modern Warfare should be the gold standard of other games. My enemies die realistically fast from a gunshot wound but so do I. The magical red healing screen is necessary for video game reasons but otherwise it’s spot on.
---
I'm really loving the confetti explosion upon mob death, which you get from the lunchboxes. Is it a thing already? I hope it is. And if it isn't, then it should be. I'd play non-stop if there was confetti.
---
Here you go! https://digitalcitizen.ca/2011/12/26/ol-man-mose-for-those-who-like-1930s-music-with-f-bombs/
---
They have needed to nerf bloodied for ages
---
all damage has been nerfed more or less equally.
---
Will we get more xp from enemies if we are higher level players?
---
It hasn't actually altered which build is strongest though  has it. It has just reduced how great an advantage bloodied has over other builds, which is a good thing. The game needs build diversity and from what I'm seeing the new patch is moving more towards that. Obviously they're not going to get everything right in one go but it's a step in the right direction.
---
After many hours of getting distracted I racked up a load of tadpole badges.. got confused on why I wasn't progressing only to realize I was stuck on "Revive an Ally". Damn my antisocial play style!
---
Altho I was pretty sure I already did that at some event, but I guess not.
---
The SCORE has not done that has it? Treasury notes does that :P
---
my SS mods are these:
---
Torso: Jet Pack (fun, extra movility and helps you to avoid fall damage)
---
Arms: Stabilized x2 (I love playing sniper and this mod helps a lot to manual aim with gamepad, the effect of the mod on both arms is far much stronger than max level Sniper Perk card, you no longer need to hold your breath)
---
Legs: Custom fitted x2 (tried the other mods and aren't that good, the fall damage reduction from Cushioned is barely noticeable and Sleek is useless if you have speed demon mutation because with that mutation you're already capping all types of speed)
---
Just for saying, with a low level character I saw near charleston a livel 29 run to me and start to shoot for pvp. I decided to don't Attack because I was only livel 16 but when I see She go to Attack some level 5 player I decided to quit and re-enter in the same server with a livel 96 character with a full ultracite Power armor and when I start to Attack She kills me with 2 bullets of handmade rifle and lately I see She at the schorchbeast Queen event with a t60 Power armor....
---
Nope, failed. No more wine.
---
Employed and married/family is a target audience for microtransactions. You have the money to pay to catch up. Second only to sub 18yo players.  Whose parents have the money to pay for microtransactions lol.
---
You have to run the picklock perk card
---
Its new stuff dude. Like end, end game content and you're not even at the end game.
---
For a long time getting levels beyond 100ish is pointless, this will change that and reward those who are far beyond 100. You certainly do not have to be hard core to get into the 100s with all the latest lunchboxes and whatnot.
---
Why do you need to max them out . Why can’t you just be content with it just being there. Why does everyone need to have it and if they don’t, the game is asking for too much.
---
People spent ages abusing a unbalanced mechanics and are pissed they can't kill the SBQ in 2 minutes anymore
---
"My family's been grindin' these here rewards for five generations now."
---
yes which is what i want.
---
Lol, what has that got to do with anything?
---
Where can i see the latest perks?
---
Both! Treasury notes gives incentive from events, so does score. Everyday, there's a challenge requiring event completion.
---
This game is shit its trash compared to any other fallout game
---
That only happens if you don’t equip the perk.
---
Custom fitted is the less AP while sprinting right?
---
No problem. I spawned at my fav lockpick spot, thanks to my SSD I loaded in faster than any other player, picked the lock, equipped the weapon and killed the first player coming for me. Then I happily let the next one slaughter me, bc my business with NW for the day was finished.
---
but they did nerf everything. literally.
---
Not everyone " is finished or close to finish". Some of us are working people who can only play a day or two at most a week, so needing a score weekend is exactly what we need. Your metrics need work.
---
Griefing in this game is pointless. I don’t know why people even bother.
---
Ha! So all those "It's not really, the devs will just fudge the numbers and it will magically make it" goobers were wrong lol
---
500 caps? I earn more from that by selling fixer plans! C'mon todd, you gotta make it at *least* 800
---
Cool, fair enough. Your original post might not be as clear as you think in that respect.
---
thumbnail is pretty factual though. they did nerf damage output as a whole so...
---
Good innit, lol.
---
I tried not to spoil it so i left in generic
---
While I understand this concern, think about what this game has to offer as a live service. Future updates for a few years and all that with the current damage system? 
---
That's simply not going to work. Look at other big games like Diablo 3 (pre RoS patch) and Path of Exile. They all did a huge change like this at some point.
---
Rad! Thank you!
---
You can hurt her in the air but not as much if she lands.
---
I've done one of these things.... 😅
---
I thought you were complaining about the thumbnail specifically. because that thumbnail is spot on.
---
but in regards to what you just said, the 'current' damage system had no bearing on future updates. I see no reason why they couldn't add in new content with the current, non nerfed system.
---
&gt; I willingly used PvP content and someone killed me. I then stole some loot after I couldn't kill them back, so they reciprocated by destroying some of my things.
---
They were not being an asshole.
---
Gotta earn that pocket money somehow!!
---
You dare say my pastry has too much lead in it? Feel the wrath of these 2 wooden rolling pins! Actually can we wait till night? I do more damage then.
---
I dont think you need to worry so much. As you stated One Appalachia is just around the corner. Which means every enemy you kill(including legendary) will be at max level(assuming you are above that level). This will mean you have far more areas you go to for farming legendary items. Knowing you wont have anything drop below max level. I know I have received many legendary drops that would of been god rolls if they hadn't been lvl5-10. Give it a couple of weeks and you are gonna have so many weapons you want to hold on to just to try out for a while that you wont have room in your stash or inventory lol
---
Since when did they become legacy ?
---
I found one.  I killed it for its meat....  mmm BBQ...
---
Yes in Daily Ops
---
No idea honestly.
---
That combo doesnt drop anymore I believe.
---
I've had a couple pull a Leeroy Jenkins. I found it quite funny trying to keep the stupid fuckers alive. I need that tree stump full of auto grenade launchers, damnit!
---
Pretty sure it does, not 100% sure though
---
But *everything* is being hit by this nerf, not just Bloodied.
---
If you have speed demon you are already moving at max speed.
---
You should be able to play them on your TV in your base.
---
Yes fallen enemies drop ammo you've killed them with
---
The reward still says it’s locked
---
Meh, people bought and praised Bethesda for Fallout 3 and Fallout 4. This was the result.
---
When radiant quests were their solution to quests in Fallout 4 THAT was the biggest damn red flag around.
---
Well... they are supposed to be \*Legendary\*  
---
If everyone has super powers... no-one does.
---
It’s because then the devs would only be able to add in absolutely broken gear which would result in the situation with bloodied right now. Besides, adding together multipliers is more balanced than multiplying them together.
---
It’s really bad with any nocturnal weapons.
---
I don’t know, not everyone collects treasure notes, and I didn’t start collecting them until I was over halfway through the legendary run.
---
The public team system plus the legendary run definitely increased the number of events I attend. Because of this, I always have more treasury notes than I could ever turn in, so I literally never do anything to specifically get a treasury note.
---
Yes. 100%, absolutely agree.
---
I mean its 6.
---
Str-9 
---
Per-15
---
End-8
---
Char-3
---
Int-6
---
Agi-10
---
Luck-5
---
I'm all rifles.
---
I always use two shot in vats. Just slap on a long scope and add a true barrel and stock, instant sniper
---
Of the colours. It's the most common. Could probably sell for 1 or 2k caps in your vendor
---
Said it before and I'll say it again. 
---
Bethesda don't care about making the game great, they just want you to spend an excessive amount of time in it because it makes their figures look great. It seems this has been their plan all along. Tricking people into spending stupid amounts of their lives on the game. 
---
Take the grind for the secret service gear which requires literally months of brain dulling gameplay. 
---
Let's look at how to reach level 100 on the season board. Again, hundreds of hours required to play the same content at slightly different angles.
---
How about trying to get a good 3 star weapon? Be prepared to fight Bethesdas RNG lords for it. Atleast Beth made it so simple that you just need to find a 3 star legendary enemy to get yourself that magic 2 star nocturnal pitchfork. 
---
Heck, even the Wastelanders quest line was guilty of it. Taking you back to places you've already visited, already cleared, already looted... Lazy recycled content. Half the development time, double the gameplay time. Even if the gameplay is pathetic. 
---
Legendary perks? You bet that's gonna take an excruciating amount of time because you were fine with Beth making you spend an eternity already.
---
20x 5,56 without any perks, 36x with ammosmith, 35x with rank 2 ammo factory (75% more), 63x with both equipped. 
---
If this "balancing" from PTS makes it into the game unchanged, I would strongly recommend picking this perk as your first, because right now everything is a bullet sponge.
---
I use utility perks and patchwork armor with the same intention, and all kind of weapons, and the game is kinda challenging this way. I can't imagine how boring fights could be with min/maxed builds.
---
hmmmm.... PC? or console? the game does "funny" things to your hardware, which can raise the chance of getting a bluescreen. i run a very stable PC with the actual win10 version. though its hardware is 8 years old and took a lot of action and strain, its still a very reliable system. until it comes to playing FO76... :-/
---
I didn’t click the link, but this is one reason I thought removing the NDA was a bad idea. Everyone argued with me.
---
Good idea, piss poor execution.
---
Yea doing it publicly will just make everyone jump to conclusions but it's a PTS (Public Test Server) so people should assume it's a test and wait for reviews from the players , just like what they did with legendary perks a good change might i add so I'm assuming they'll tweak this too to a certain extent
---
Yes.
---
I min/max my damage till I can easily kill most enemy's but stop there. That allows me extra perk points for utility since I don't have to spend them all on damage perks.
---
I don't really see a problem with broken gear considering that a lot of people play this game in a singleplayer, coop fashion. Fo76 is hardly a competitive mmo where you need the best gear anyway.
---
Nothing.
---
20 people lined up together at the overseer's like halloween, we're together waiting for a turn to scrap garbage legendaries, all together huddled around ward.. yeah brilliant
---
You think it's bad now - wait till you see the weapon damage nerfs from patch 22.
---
 Enjoy it while it lasts.
---
&gt; Bloodied deserved the nerf, but all the weapons/perks? Maybe not.
---
No, I know that the damage done to the enemy by the player is generally reduced
---
I agree about them needing to change daily/weeklies. I was thinking they could do something like they do in Fortnite (yes, yes, I know, I used to play Fortnite with my son, but stick with me). In Fortnite (if you haven't played it) they have ten weeks worth of challenges. Releasing a set of challeneges per week. But what they do is they keep open those challenges for the previous weeks if you haven't completed them. This is what Bethesda should adopt here. 
---
That way no one misses out on doing the challenges that are set. No one feels like they are way too far behind to even bother continuing with the board. Theres no need to log on every day if you don't fancy it or don't have the time. They can still keep dailies for a little boost. But you shouldn't need the dailies to complete the whole board. 
---
On a side note I really think they should have different style challenges. Not just kill x legendary, level up x times. But mix it up. Get people exploring the map a bit more. Make the challenges a bit more interesting. Find the hidden x in x location. Rescue npc from x location. Scavenger hunts. Interesting places. Interesting conversations. Just more than what we have now. Even collect x amount of x scrap!

---
This is in addition to ATX and SCORE stuff datamined earlier
---
Yes, to 160%. I would rather swap and get to 200%. Swapping takes 2 seconds.
---
nice
---
This can’t be true, can it? I have Speed Demon and clearly move faster with a Fixer equipped. Why wouldn’t sleek accomplish something similar? Plus I always thought Speed Demon affected your “not sneaking” speed only. Did I miss a few memos again?
---
no, you are not. being able to put out THE! DAMAGE!!! is not the main goal of this game in my humble opinion. but there see to be a type of player who just cant sleep well when their character is not specced out to the max....
---
It's supposed to be something you achieve after a really long time... Yea if you are only 47 after 140 hours you will probably not max it out.
---
However, if you are only level 47 after 140 hours then you are choosing to play the game in a way in which you gain very little xp because thats ALOT of time and very few levels.  You're not supposed to be able to max stuff out playing like that.  The hardcore players who play alot should be rewarded for their time and effort.
---
i used to sell them for 1k. sometimes put the price down to 700. Currently sitting on 7 of them.
---
Here's what all the colours can go for. Baed on 150+ hours of hunting for a red and selling them and also what i've seen them go for on the trade forum
---
Brown - up to 1k
---
Blue - up to 5k
---
Green - up to 5k
---
Pink - up to 12k
---
Yellow - up to 15k
---
Forest - up to 25k
---
Red - trade only. Like 150k+
---
That’s my problem with seasons. People will say. 
---
“Just don’t do the seasons”
---
They still are a big distraction from what should be an engaging fun world to wander.
---
There's a difference between griefing and pvping. Described above is griefing, pvping is what survival was for but apparently "no one used it"
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH7mxaLCp0
---
theres a key for that lock?!??!?!
---
Jumping between the pts and the live game is black and white.
---
The pts is basically a shit experience sorry to say.
---
I'm sure BGS will stick with this patch.
---
&gt;  It's a system that rewards those players who put another 1000 hours in the game. 
---
It's a system that rewards players for having played and keep playing a broken build and punishes everyone else.
---
grinding for a SS set alone takes what, a month? of daily logins?
---
same with the legendary perks. a single one takes hundreds of levels.
---
it's hardly off point.
---
The easiest solution is to make perk coins level based. You could keep the scrapping but make them only 1 coin so scrapping speeds things up but you're not forced to strip your perks.
---
However, they should offer a free Respec for people after this. Just as a jesture of good will.
---
It updates manually. Wait until tomorrow. I am sure we did it.
---
I would rather they not remember the assholes that griefed events with those weapons
---
The scrip limit absolutely needs to go. I proposed in another thread an option. They can keep the scrip limit but only if they give us the option to scrap legendary items for modules. To avoid inflation, scrapping legendaries can give you a chance for modules, depending on the star tier. Then you have more options with legendaries
---
-script
---
-sell to vendor
---
-sell at your vending
---
-scrap
---
-drop
---
I know sneak criticals don't trigger, but can you at least remain hidden from them to avoid damage? maybe with the css or a stealth boy?
---
if youre that poor of a human being who cant afford  a simple stuff for his benefit when youre addicted to the game, i feel sorry for you, especially when youre bitching like a little girl on reddit about something absurd as this. Dont be shy , maybe ll buy something for you, you poor little man, but first , try to act like a normal person
---
Hopefully the same strategy works for colossal problem, I’ve got a massive pile of ice Grenades I’ve been building up from farming west tek
---
no, every daily op has the enhanced perception mutation. you can‘t stealth whatsoever. they have like 100 perception and see you from 100 miles through 10 walls.
---
I have **never** seen this when I had the picklock card equipped
---
I found the best compromise with instigator weapons and SS unyielding armor (4 pieces - the chest being a health regenerating one). With adrenal reaction and mid-40% health, the instigating gauss pump shotgun and gauntlet are particularly devastating, I can one-shot most creatures.
---
For SBQ and Sheepsquatch fights I use a furious laser gatling, given the abundance of fusion cores in the game and the fact that I never fight them alone.
---
I tried to go junkie when I had a junkie's power fist and I was very into unarmored builds (with ninja perks and the chinese armor it was game on easy mode) but it was annoying to me to continue looking for substances to keep the damage bonus.
---
Again, there is no difference whether they buff one thing or nerf or the other, the end effect is the same.
---
Agreed. This game isn’t easy enough. 
---
/s
---
How much AP does it save would you reckon? Looking at this or Deep Pockets (if it's ever added)
---
Thanks for that! Seems legit, it really “appears” to be a better sneak speed with the Fixer but admittedly I’ve never timed it.
---
Don't divorce your wife. She can help you grind them. You take the night shift and she'll get the day shift
---
The answer to that first part,  yes.
---
If you don't want to do pvp then you shouldn't have access to the rewards the come with the pvp enabled parts of the game, it's as simple as that. 
---
Again you're sour about it. You don't like it, but it's working as intended.
---
It’s bugged and apparently getting patched on Tuesday.
---
And yet we're still forced to if we want to farm workshops.
---
honestly i have a few high level alts i dont play anymore so im just going to grind all of their perks up for coins and rank up the legendary ones since they are account wide and delete them after if my math is correct i should be able to max out like 3 perks just from that
---
No, it just haven't updated. It still says "deliver cork Aug 11-15" but shows plastic's 150 mil goal. Anyway, last night when I checked it said 201 mil and some out of the 200 mil so it's been (auto)completed.
---
IOU ten bucks.
---
I like your thinking.
---
I don't understand your argument that they'll have better control.
---
My issue is they made the enemies stronger and the weapons weaker. Everything will take longer and more resources. 
---
Also, buffs from aide items are nearly pointless now. I can do great damage, but when I want to do more, say for a boss fight or to go for a time record, I can add chems, bobbleheads, magazines, food items. Now those buffs are negligable.
---
This is not a problem as they can always add new juicy legendary perks to keep us going. The problem is that it's a shit system that punishes players that reskilled and encourages low build variety on each player and the playerbase as a whole.
---
I don't run super damaging builds so ill probably still be just more awful, barley will notice it on my character.
---
You can do that in GTA too. It’s actually quite similar.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought, you're playing dumb insinuating the queen is the only endgame enemy. You are playing dumb, aren't you?!
---
Are you in la la land? There is a big nerf on the way that f\*cks everything.
---
And the pay is not so great :D  
---
Also it's BS that you need to grind everyday to keep up with SCORE. I just completed Legendary run couple of days ago, but if season 2 is similar grind, then Bethesda can keep their armored ace.  
---
I have not much a life, but still 1-2 hours per day to just try keep up with the event is too much.
---
I hope that daily ops and other new content, thats in the way is worth it. Else, I don't know what to do and I have played this game over 950 hours so far.
---
I know how to tag, I can’t help it that there’s assholes out there that sprint to the legendary and one pop them as if their lives depend on it.
---
It’s a hell a way to nerf something. Instead of nerfing bloodied let’s nerf the entire buff system and also while we’re at it buff the enemies levels in a flawed level scaling system
---
I can't say exactly but I think I read somewhere it's 10% per mod so 20% if you use it on both legs. At least ingame is pretty noticeable.
---
i remember when I first realized how heavy gunpowder was. I felt like I'd just given birth to a 50 pound baby once dropping it.
---
Yeah, I know, but other weapons don't deserve to be nerfed.
---
Why the Chinese stealth armor doesn’t have a communist skin in the next season pass I’ll never know.
---
If you look at the internal data IDs and all of the unused orphaned records it’s clear they didn’t copy-paste anything from Fallout 4, rather, Fallout 76 is a mod on top of Fallout 4.
---
Most FO4 texture mods work as-is, for example.
---
Yeah, I will double check, but I am almost positive I just rolled a TSE handmade the other day.
---
I feel your pain...  
---
I'm lvl 175, and run a vanilla character, no armour mods, no mutations (it keeps the game challenging for me), I do have a 3\* Zealots combat shotgun as my base weapon, and a 3\* Zealots Plasma cannon for the SBQ events.  And i've had to resort to a 3\* ghoul slayers Gatling laser so I can clean sweep White Springs for xp levelling the score challenges.  
---
As a shotgun/heavy weapon build, I went and got all the gauss shotgun plans, and mods, built my weapon tried it out, and its so OP!, made the game far too easy for me, no challenge at all so I went straight back to camp and scrapped it.  I understand why people love to min/max characters I do it a lot roleplaying, a good Storyteller/Games Master/Dungeon Master can tailor the game to offer you a challenge, but against a computer program that can't adapt to your character build its like fishing with dynamite.
---
I picked up 76 again yesterday, and now I’m not sure I really want to keep playing.
---
The crazy thing is that to max a card takes about 250 levels. Assuming no "wasted" points or bonus packs.
---
You could max out 3 cards by about level 800, which...is still pretty insane but doable.
---
Problem is, after level 1000, it takes 10 times the amount of exp to level! That's effectively 2500 levels per card!
---
You can also use it in your favourite wheel, while inspecting/repair your weapon
---
Thats what his gun already does,  he shoots you in the head and he's got the workstation. They not only included your idea but they added a gameplay mechanic to it as well! Problem solved.
---
As I had to clarify with somebody else, im not a pvp player at all, im lvl 56 so I wouldnt stand a chance with any of the bigger guys. Do you know what I do? I don't claim the workshops, the rewards aren't big enough to warrant it anyway.  I haven't seen a workshop that can do something i couldn't do from my camp.
---
Every now and again I'll take one for fun, of for the challenge and if someone turns up and kills me then thats fair game, because I knew the risks by claiming the workshop, it even warns me of them each time.
---
What everybody keeps telling you, is that despite your desire to be a pacifist in regards to pvp, and enabling that, youre then going into and starting an activity that you are full aware specifically enables pvp, no matter what option you have enabled before you're overriding it by choosing to take part in that activity.
---
Your argument is like saying if you joined an event. Why are the scorchbeasts killing me, why when I join if I don't want to fight them do they not just stop and i get zero rewards?
---
Well its because I started the activity that specifically warned me they could attack me,  and now my dumb ass choice for my killed.  Guess what I'm going to do? Take it on the chin and move on, im not going to whine about it on Reddit.
---
I'm just going to ok up it behind me and enjoy the parts of the game i like, and then next time I'm not going to specifically take part in the thing i didn't enjoy, rather than crying. I'll just enjoy myself.
---
Might have to give it a try, cheers
---
You’d need to extract the textures and setup a custom file path in order for them to display correctly
---
Wait until you feel the sharp end of my radioactive-poisoned-literally-on-fire-nailed-steel-alloy-bigass-hungolomghononoloughongous bat. It also has a comfort grip and a microwave.
---
You support design choice.
---
You can already AFK uranium fever letting all others do the work and just one shot the legendaries. Which is wayyyyyy worse.
---
It looks great! Nice job 🤩
---
That was an hacked weapon. With the classic Cryo it's not possible to do that due to the lack of range. It was a Cryo Minigun with 700 range.
---
&gt; Will we get more xp from enemies if we are higher level players?
---
Enemies will scale up to your level (up to a specific cap depending on the region), so yes, you'll get more XP and better loot.
---
There is very little to do in endgame. Just few repeatable and daily missions that aren't worth it and couple of faction quests that are the same everytime, and have to be done about hundred times. Then there is very badly done season and few events. That's all.
---
Same for me except the ammo factory one... 150% more ammunition... ooooooohhh
---
Apperrently you can also tag the assaultsquatch when it's invisible, so it might be a good idea to get some shots in in the beginning.
---
Because if they have a better control and idea where the ceiling on damage is, they can adjust the bottom end relative to that, rather than having such wild jumps in damage between bloodied / junkie and other weapons that give up these wild bonuses for misc effects, by having a lower ceiling (and having an idea roughly where it sits) they can adjust the rest without going into wildly varying numbers.
---
If they were to, say, crank everything to bloodied's level, then the NPE would suffer from a big jump in power, the game would simply not keep up with it with any of its content, and "difficult" content would be just cranking up the damage &amp; resistance numbers to crazier and crazier amounts just for that, and slap a timer ontop (although with this decrepit engine, it's all they can do in the first place, the pve mutations are a surprising addition that can swing from meaningless to almost unmanageable)
---
Don’t you PTS guys have a method to report these things directly to Bethesda? Seems counter-productive to report here. I’m on Xbox and can’t even picture this clearly. Please let them know, that would be a great community service.
---
You are just jealous :D   
---
Yeah, its kinda a stupid that these people will go and kill SBQ under a second and no one else get the loot. Hope that they will fix how to reward the players, who join and play events etc together. But then people will just arrive to event and do nothing and still get reward.
---
So, what is the middle way solution?  But then again, why not limited to damage output that player can actually to do with every weapons and in this way these hacked weapons are not so superior, or is it so deep in the games code, that its not fixable?
---
It still drops
---
I'm not saying I support it,  I'm saying that it's there and they is how it functions.
---
Ive elaborated a bit more in a longer comment, im sure you'll reply to that sooner or later.
---
personally I'm partial to following them around singing take me home country roads as loudly and off key as I can or if they aren't moving googling aol dial up noise putting mic next to speaker and going to snag some lunch
---
When a person is 10 times your level and can kill you before you can even close the menu you're actively in with a stash box... Ooh all the fun.
---
I didn't really join an event because there was no PVP while I was standing there. He came and initiated PVP against me when I'm a pacifist.
---
I understand your argument, I find it invalid.
---
I indicated that I didn't want to take part of the part I did enjoy by clicking the pacifist setting option.
---
It didn't suddenly create a way for me to mind resources safely when I did that. And I don't mean safe from other possible threats, I mean safe from the systematically stupid PVP feature that I literally opted out of.
---
and yes no matter how many times you repeat the argument it doesn't change my position. I'm not expecting to change yours at this point either.
---
I do however expect it to be a turn off for everybody else who doesn't want a PVP but still needs to access the resources. At least the environment is reasonably balanced compared to the hacked up players who go around briefing people.
---
When everybody stops playing where's your fun PVPing then. Oh wait you have all the people who want to PVP to still play with. Just like I'm suggesting...
---
Wander the wasteland then :). I was the same, so I started a new character, 3 weeks later I’m level 70 and I haven’t done the main questline yet.
---
and are you saying it could function better, and offering a cheap and easy way to make it function better. And you're getting salty about the fact that I think it should function better.
---
Bloodied gets a bigger nerf due to the nature of stacking damage multipliers relative to the other builds, but yes hopefully in the future they use this blanket nerf as a way to balance out other archetypes slowly over time.
---
Like sneaking needing a big nerf to how exceedingly powerful it is both offensively &amp; defensively and how easy it is.
---
😂😂😂 I love this
---
Sorry this voice to text software is kind of screwing up some of what I'm sending.
---
Yes. Yes yes yes. I want people to check out my camp, but my front door is locked as having them leave it open all the time made my soul itch. Same goes for allies.
---
Couldnt even do that because as soon as i spawned i died instantly
---
The buffs from legendaries etc were way to over-powered in the first place. Blame Bethesda for keeping it unbalanced for this long
---
I'm glad you find me argument invalid. Because I'm calling it there. 
---
Hedging fun bitching to people who don't care about how unfair a video game is being to you. I'm officially done with you.
---
sounds like a shitty answer but as much as someone wants to pay. i've seen them go for 5k and 10k and more.
---
this doesn t feels right,it means that you have to waste 250 levels of grinds in ammo legendary perk so you can keep up with your ammos. They should increase the base number of bullet you are making without any perks. Then give a bonus for the people who want to get the ammo legendary perk
---
I'm not seeing any of that,  and tbh after a sleep I thought I could explain it in a way you might understand, but i guess not.
---
I dont have all day to smash my head against a wall with you so im calling it here.
---
You called my argument invalid, why should my call yours and valid.
---
So either you support how it works, or you don't support how it works, or you think it couldn't be better, or you think it could be better... You don't take a position other than the fact that you don't like mine.
---
not for me. 
---
did one violent night 5 mins ago and because i'm not a clownshoe i decided to just cripple instead of one shotting. lots of ghouls were left lying on the floor looking like a crappy rug.

It’s legacy for energy weapons only

I just have an anti-armor fixer with faster fire rate, with stealth commando build.  It wipes everything out pretty swiftly.
---
Duping, yes. Pieces of shit? Hell no! Do you *really* think it’s acceptable to have ~1/55,000 odds to have a gun that you wanted from the purveyor? That’s over 55,000 tries. Let’s say you can grind out 150 scrip from the legendary scrap machine, and 50 from events and dailies. That’s over 12,000 days of work assuming it doesn’t happen until you’re near your 55000th try.
---
It’s only legacy for energy weapons
---
So stop playing it.
---
I just found the sleeping bear in the cave at WhiteSprings. Level 280-something
---
Yeah, I recently got my endgame nocturnal rolling pin from the queen, that's how it should be. Face it, as long as almost all drops are plain shit getting them everywhere still means nothing.
---
Excellent.  This is the kind of information I was looking for.  Thanks!
---
Is there a list available somewhere with what the perks are gonna be?
---
Wasn’t that shitty lol it gave me a idea
---
I understand it perfectly. I just think it's wrong. and the reason I think it's wrong is because there is no replacement to play at the other way.
---
I also think it's wrong because it lacks the fairness that makes games fun for people. It appeals to the people who want to make games not fun for other people, but that's a relatively small subset.
---
I think it's wrong because it doesn't match the style and conceit of the game. I think it's wrong because the people who are willing to go make the game miserable for other people are also the people who are willing to dupe and whatnot more often than not.
---
Elsewhere in this very thread there's a guy who specifically circumvents other people's blocks because he wants to pursue them once they've had enough of him and one of his favorite things to do is to get people to PVP him because we're his "prey".
---
So leaving a mechanism in place that is particularly attractive to low-level players needing resources, and high-level players they want to grief low-level players at the same time, is just poor design.
---
The argument that you should just avoid the poor design isn't really a valid argument for the design being anything other than poor.
---
The point of games is supposed to be to entertain all the parties involved optimally, not to cater to griefers.
---
Advocating pay to win, nice.
---
He seems like the type of guy that doesn’t have clean weapons and armor to me.
---
I can’t remember where I was but I finally found it like two weeks ago but lucky enough the tree actually had stuff in it for me
---
Betheada won't do thisbbecauwe they are a bunch of mobile game whores.
---
Bethesda does not realize they are making a GAME. They think they are making a JOB.
---
Yeah, and for past one year I was searching for it, looking for clues, I knew there was one, and I finally found it
---
I particularly enjoy the invisible ones that spawn in darkened areas, having 4 or 5 of them hitting you from different angles is hugely rewarding :-)
---
The one you can unlock? It the one with the minigun on the middle of the room on the table, that is behind lvl 3 lock in camp venture
---
Well, not much, but there is a minigun, that is technically the main thing to get
---
&gt; Ladders, in this case, are a simple matter of it not being worth the time and effort to support: They could absolutely do it, but it's not worth it.
---
That's the problem with ancient game engines - a lot of the stuff they should be doing lands on the "not worth it" pile.
---
*Oh boy, here we go again*
---
Brotherhood of Simps inbound! Target spotted!
---
If you can’t find it, let me know. I will show you the location
---
Um. No. Fallout 1st is not pay to win.
---
&gt;ancient game engines
---
Funny you should mention this.
---
The Creation engine is one of the newest game engines on the market.
---
Pretty much every engine in use is built on engines and tech that date back to the 1990's.
---
Stealth flying. Ha.
---
I can imagine one of the pursued side effects of the dmg nerf (higher ammo consumption) in combination with one wasteland (enemy scale to your level) is to drain ammo amount of the player base.
---
Won‘t hit those who got plenty - some of questionable heritage - but the casuals who just want to enjoy the game on a less stress- and grindfull level will experience more changes than only dmg numbers.
---
I'm pretty much in the same exactly situation,but closer to 700,and I already opened most of my packs beside like 20,so I already lost a bit more cards.
---
If things stay like this i'm thinking of a farming method but i'm not sure if it will be efficient.all I know is that it will be boring and long.
---
I know right? I found a clue, and if I wouldn’t got the clue I got last night, I would’ve kept searching for that damn key for another year
---
[](/adoorable)Oh hey, I used to have a camp there! It's a sweet lil spot. Lookin' good so far friend.
---
Cancel your Fallout 1st, uninstall the game until there are significant changes.
---
This is an echo chamber of "Game bad" yet everyone keeps playing it complaining.
---
If you still can’t find it, let me know, I’ll show you the location
---
Nope, you have to be in the thousands to max out one card!
---
I have 700+ notes and nothing to do with them lol I turn them in sometimes if I remember
---
Looks cosy! Keep it up fellow dweller
---
Haha I made a post earlier about how they should wipe all the legacies from the game since the majority of people that have them now have duped ones. Like why would Bethesda knowingly remove something from the game for being too OP and then allow it to return to the game throw consistent dupe exploits. PvP isn’t fun anymore since almost everyone has a duped legacy. But bringing legacies back for everyone would be just as good I suppose.
---
I skipped over quite a bit of it. But on the topic of Super Mutants, it seems like ghouls and other mutated creatures in the waste aren't just a product of radiation exposure. The Enclave in Fallout 2 probably had a point about everyone having been exposed to some amount of FEV. But if that's the case, then we should be seeing a ton of really badass reptiles, not just mutated geckos. Reptiles are much more susceptible to mutation than other animals. Fun fact: turtles born with two heads are common enough that there are people who collect them. If a little bit of FEV exposure gave cows two heads, then what would it have done to the turtle population?
---
Coins aren't account wide, they are per character!
---
Griefing could be if this began by the other player going to the workshop with the only goal being to destroy installed guns and crafting tables etc. That isn't what happened.
---
The second player was just doing exactly what the workshop content is intended for. Noone has to like that, but then their issue is with the game design.
---
No one should be considered an asshole or griefer for player game mechanics normally.
---
Oh boy lol
---
Oh okay
---
I turned them in every chance I get, which is basically every day, but I would have to go a few weeks without doing an event before I would run out.
---
You know the issue is not the new Damage Model, the issue is that it’s just the new Damage Model and nothing else.
---
They purposely didn’t announce it once they announced the Patch 22 PTS open up
---
Gotta raise prices I guess
---
Non legendaries are nerfed too, if you ever used any perk card that buffs a weapon, you will see less damage!
---
I finally installed the PTS, tried the Daily OPS and uninstalled instantly.
---
My stealth sniper build is literally trash on that new mode, stealth doesn't work and both my hunting and gauss rifle barely did any damage to Mr Gutsys while they one-shoted me.
---
Ive just started playing, and already got 50 hours in. Thanks for the addiction Xd
---
Stop. I can only get so erect.
---
Hoards hundreds of level ups then moans opening hundreds of level ups at once is an issue...
---
My highest level character is 129 and I've only played around 300 hours since launch. I'm just going to pretend Legendary Perks don't exist.
---
810 is the level cap for eso, but those champion points are an account wide boost!
---
on Xbox I sell the flag plan for 10k the helmet 6 k and the outfit 7k  backpack 5k and they always sell.
---
Well, of course we do and I posted it on pts forums as well. As you can see from the posts I linked, it's perfectly normal to post stuff like that here and beth reacts to these posts here as well. Also, many people here are already familiar with perk coin system and legendary perks so I decided to post is as a little sneak peek of what we ended up with after two iterations of changes beth made to the system since it first hit pts back in june.
---
I love it when the Imposter Sheepsquatch explodes. So many people forget and rush forward and get nuked. Makes me laugh every time.  
---
They should just make it so the body doesn't move from where it drops. It can explode and stay where it is.
---
I mean, it *is* a stealth-suit so I struggle to think of what kind of skin you could create that wouldn’t conflict with that.
---
some mods for the sheepsquatch club and staff are really rare, like the flaming barbed one.
---
it’s a grind. 
---
keep all three alive and hope for the best.
---
I'm not either
---
Same here, no fixed build. You can enjoy the game any way you want.
---
Well, one was able to milk the Brahmin before Wastelanders patch...
---
I never linger at camps with electric lighting as it lags my game dreadfully. I quickly spawn into the foundations or underwater, fast travel again to the camp to hopefully not get locked into a wall. 
---
Then if successful I hunt for the vending machines, work out a way to avoid the decon arch then access the vending machines and scroll through the overpriced basic plans and the usual prime SBQ stuff and leave.
---
the balance isn‘t there yet, not at all. why mr gutsys, out of all mobs they chose the one that completely negate armor and make them 100 perception. gg beth
---
Played my first 600 hours without bloodied. Can tell you that i don't regret the switch
---
Yeah, but they seem to date back to there in name, while the creation engine seems to date back in code and is just a mutated gamebryo engine with things hammered to the side of it. BTW gamebryo dates back to 1997. Well, maybe Bethesda is only shit at improving the engine, who knows? But it's pretty apparent that games on this engine are always a bug riddled mess which is definitly not the case with the other engines around. And raping the engine into supporting MMO stuff which it wasn't designed for in any way, shape or form might not have been the best idea, either.
---
Well, I didn't "hoard" 'em per se. There still is no reasonable way to spend them all so after some time I ended up with hundreds of points.
---
The point of my post is to show that the system beth introduced for us to spend these level ups is far from ideal and is simply disincentivizing to even try using it.
---
The game has a play test server where players can test the games future updates before they come out on pc. If you would like news and updates there's a channel on YouTube called JuiceHead and he covers all the latest information pretty well. The latest video is really good and contains a lot of information.
---
People who use AFKers as an excuse have no idea how many are actually doing it now in major events like Scorched Earth, Fasnacht, Meat Week etc. Also, there are other section of people who pay back against one shotters by siting idly after doing minimal damage to the boss for the base xp/reward which further prolongs the Scorched Earth event. With or without the OP's suggestion of common reward system in one wasteland being implemented, an event is always going to fail or succeed based on the few who wishes to participate. Some alternative solutions include :
---
- No legendaries should spawn during major events
---
- Trash mobs should not reward anything on death (except ammo for the ones who killed it). Devaluing trash mob ensures people focus on side objectives instead of worrying about lost xp, loot or legendaries.
---
- As some suggested above, if the bare minimum works to complete the event, there should be a common reward chest/loot table for those who tried to participate in the event. Possibly a bonus for those who helped finish the objectives.
---
Nice build! I think I see the Blood Eagles nest neatly worked in there as well. Tell me, how well does it interact with other building pieces? Is it generous with existing side by side with them, or did you need to use some glitches to get it all that close?
---
And if they won't change the perks to really feel "legendary", there won't be much sense in even trying to farm coins.
---
You’re right, what about cream then?
---
How many sources of Damage buffs do you use?
---
Ok thank you so much hope it does.
---
The slowdown on those are much weaker.
---
Cryolator with the Crystalized mod attached will hit the SBQ while she is in the air.
---
You can still just get a one-star reward? Think I’ll pass.
---
Make 4 more characters and do it again!
---
Really nice! Where You placed It?
---
I bought it knowing this is a thing, honestly I use 3rd person 90% of the time as a heavy build and the other 10% in first all you have to do is aim and the arm moves.
---
It’s not ideal but it’s not game breaking.
---
I mean it has been updated. That was the point. If we made it they would have updated it when they updated to the plastic challenge.
---
You do know you can scrap cryolators to unlock the crystallising barrel right?
---
I use an instigating gauss rifle and gauss shotgun, pretty good
---
The entire page is updated manually and they are super inconsistent. When they changed the goal for concrete to 15k it still said 150k at the bottom of the page for 2 days. I’m confident we unlocked and they just didn’t update the bottom part yet.
---
There are a lot of inventory management features that would be nice, but I think something like this would be very telling if there was something in the "status" section of your Pip Boy that indicated what percentage your carried weight was represented by each item type. When you notice one type spiking, you know there's something you forgot in there, like a big stack of 3lb hallucination gas canisters.
---
It would also be nice if you could set maximum quantities for items in your stash, like steel.
---
The coins and the upgrades for the cards are not account wide. Just the 6 Legendary slots are. 
---
Anyone with multiple high level characters is getting screwed over by this system.
---
I’ve gotten the rewards when not collecting the extra boxes. I believe they only give 10 extras caps and that it. Get them if you need the caps otherwise they aren’t really required to get the blue ridge caravan gear.
---
I'm just tired of the loot pile showing up 1 yard away from where the mob died.
---
That can't be true. I thought it was thousands for maxing all the cards, or 6 cards or something
---
I saw a player who was level 2240 two weeks ago.  I took a picture of him.
---
Guys, trust me. I know what i'm saying
---
Nope just for one or two cards.
---
Also have 3 Charisma. Typically share Bodyguards.
---
There’s a damage cap in PvP, one shotting doesn’t exist against someone with full health. Unless you’re talking about NPCs in power armor?
---
Anchoring bias. BGS need to stop moving incrementally from something stingy to something grindable. (I have multiple perk cards to run different weapons, I'm not going to trade them, especially if not over multiple characters).
---
Once a fortnight I think about the vault 94 emote. But killing those ants was just not worth the opportunity cost. It's like the WOW South Park episode, 'no life'.
---
The only people with several legendary perks will be the people who use unyielding, to bug into god mode, stack a whole bunch of XP stuff, and just farm levels; tediously and endlessly for hours and hours and hours and hours. They'll go along to events and do really cool stuff, and everybody else who doesn't have inclination for such tediousness nonsense or doesn't have time to just grind just won't get them. Especially not in the short to medium term. Not to mention a way to game the system has possibly been worked out in the PTS, and people who figured it out are waiting for live servers to exploit it before it becomes public &amp; gets patched.
---
I'm not particularly motivated to grind since I don't think my precious raids are coming back any time soon, and the daily ops in Vault 94 don't have that same manic energy pre wastelanders
---
Its just RNG. Keep grinding the event and you will get it. I have run this event over 50 times to get all rewards (the backpack, the outfit and mask, the flag and the recipe)
---
I have a 25 AA Lever that is getting chewed up shockingly fast, as well.
---
Wrong attitude:
---
A wife just means less XP waste; rotate responsibility so they earn you xp while you're at work
---
I made a mod that silences her for good because of that...
---
This is due to there being absolutely no end game content. Once you get through the short missions you’re left working to entertain yourself.
---
Massive xp from the ghouls.
---
Sadly you got nerfed as well so now it'll take 30 to 40 bullets!
---
Those details seem never end to amaze one... everytime i went to camp venture the door was already picked or i just threw in the perks and did it my self. never ever had even the trace of an idea that there could be a key somewhere...
---
Thanks, that's great news.
---
For me bloodied was about avoiding the ammo crafting grind, being efficient. But this nerf hits everyone, even non legendaries will feel it!
---
Use the fires. And some of the mothman advanced stuff has candelabras. It's a much More gentle light.
---
I like it! I'm sure r/fallout76settlements  would like a gander as well
---
Experience .. it doesn’t take much effort to grab the ore but there is an extra level of selfishness since the legendary run started
---
Troubleshooter armor
---
I haven't been playing much recently due to work. Is the legendary perk system now ingame and out of PTS?
---
Also, has collosus problem dropped?
---
Well enjoy now, after a year of my constant headache I found it and i want to share it with everyone, cause not everyone has it, and those who do keep it as a secret or don’t know how they got it
---
I have always had the perk card equipped and yes it has happened to me too. But only one to two times. I don’t know why. So yeah even with perk card on you can find this
---
Well, it's the new standard de-facto for finest grade atomic shop items nowadays.
---
One with no texture at all?
---
Have you got a quest you haven’t completed?
---
Did you submit a ticket?
---
Yeah, helping low-lvl players is actually my favourite part of the game, I often fast-traveling to their camps to share some stuff and spend few minutes around. 
---
BTW please tell me about my english, I’m not a native speaker
---
There are posts from other people that stated they adjusted the cork requirement to 65 million and in return the cork event was completed
---
I have a compact little garage vendor camp a small walk from the OS camp, and put small notes next to my vendor asking for random little things I need (nothing ever hard or crazy to find) for caps or whatever I can build/craft for. People off all levels ask me all the time about that stuff and it truly makes me feel like a small time quest giver. Interesting reactions from players at a pretty steady rate tbh. It’s totally an interesting group of of people who play this
---
Nothing in the PTS is set in stone...
---
It's more about how much is it worth to you? It can be an awful lot of repeating that event
---
Have you completed the tourist quest? The one where you have to take a photo of several landmarks.
---
Havn´t seen them either.
---
It nerfs non legendaries too, they went too far!
---
Not released yet, only available on test servers
---
I guess. I dont mind grabbing the ore. But I cant possibly make it to rank 4 by myself. And it just annoys me a bit. Mostly because there are so few endgame events, and now people dont even want to do them right.
---
When you say bullet sponge, how many bullets on average are you talking?
---
I just want to glow poison like the legendary enemies
---
Just had a troubleshooter Pump action shotgun drop on my shotgunner.. better keep that somewhere safe!
---
Yes,  I know. Forgot to edit it.
---
Yea I don’t understand that either. I don’t know why people 
---
1) want to unlock everything. 
---
2) expect to unlock everything right away.
---
That last little bit is just you being lazy. If your putting any time into the game you could put it towards getting good gear intead if scrounging around for useless scrap. Now im not saying theres anything wrong with the way you play but the whole "nobody has time for that" is just crap.
---
Hotfix Tomorrow:
---
* Fixed the Scorchbeast Queen from being able to be frozen mid-air.
---
Yes, I agree, but how does changing the math from multiplication to addition make the ceiling easier to calculate? It just makes the number smaller. It would seem they could calculate the ceiling now if they wanted to.
---
I would love to see other builds get buffed, add some more complexity to the game. Adds replayability. I just don't see the point of taking the negative effects of addictions, or low health, or spending 9 perks points to specialize when the additional damage is so small its eaten up by the enemies DR.
---
Well they specifically made it this way to exclude stealth as I guess it does not work for this type of event? I cant really see it change and I must admit I am pissed this is the daily ops. I had hoped for a more normal type of quest not something that excludes me specifically.
---
Your build is bad.sorry but it is .. I am right now running around with a level 15 grenade launcher killing level 62 enemies with one shot .  ( I am level 475) in the Bog.
---
Seriously if you having problems killing scorch then a build change is needed.
---
Nerf nerf nerf
---
True. But neither fit for me thematically. Plus I already have one (contained!) fire in the cabin, another just dropped on the floor would look weird.
---
I think the queen can be crippled again so that’s a plus
---
Nocturnal explosive 25% ffr rolling pin
---
nope- i can already one shot most shit without bloodied so i dont see the need
---
Ungrateful little brat? Take it down a notch. Dude, you have some anger management issues.
---
So glad I never got this game.  I was *this close*
---
The game bluescreens consoles regularly too!
---
Got a Troubleshooter SuperSledge last night. Think I am going to hold on to it
---
But you said that people should go to their private server to have a higher chance to get legendaries at all and thus better chances at god rolls?
---
&gt;I am not referring to duped gear. Deleting dupes of legit gear is matter of big debate not a rant
---
I don't even understand why that should be a debate, duping is cheating and all duped gear should be deleted.
---
I usually dont grab ore because putting on PA or CSA makes me over encrumbered, so i rack up kills or use a tesla if theres alot of people.
---
I'm taking a break at level 30~ but I was already way more into exploring and hunting weapon and armor plans than I was ever optimizing my perks. If I ever get to your status I'm absolutely gonna not care about legendary! Haha.
---
Holy shit a fella with common sense and insight. I am not being sarcastic either.
---
I'll always say hi! I just don't own a Mic, so I literally can't speak to you lol.
---
you should overthink your build.  
---
before i switched to bloody, i ran a stealth commando without mutations in CSA with an Instigating 50 25 combat rifle as primary weapon and a F bash 25 handmade (both far away from worth a legacy) for more tankier enemies and i died only from stupidity, didnt had any problems most of the time. be sure to use all 3 commando perks, tank killer 3 and bloody mess 3. with those you should be fine.
---
The Raider Scabber Power Armor from the Atomic Shop Scabber Bundle has the exact same issue. 
---
Actually a few of the Atomic Shop Power Armor skins have arms that obstruct first person view. I don’t know if they have ever responded to this issue.
---
Picking one lock is easy, the pick 5 locks challenge took 17 attempts!
---
Even so the TtK can be incredibly unfair especially to a player that isn't balls deep in a meta build.
---
Meanwhile basic things like power armor or other weapons are so weak in comparison it's insane the contrast they create.
---
All 5 of my characters are bloodied currently, but that is not how they are built. They are built around weapon classes and styles with ability to adapt.
---
My commando will be a commando regardless and I'll do whatever combo is the best.
---
No private test servers bud
---
Wow, nice
---
Word, just making sure people unaware of PvP aren’t being misinformed.
---
The challenges are STILL auto completing too!
---
Bethesda doesn't care, support just auto locks any ticket that mentions score!
---
It had, once. Those times are long, long gone my friend.
---
I always stick on a stealth suit and collect ore, but hardly anyone else does. I’ve never finished it at level 4 ore collected.
---
I had a team of three Radstag chase me around the Crater for like 30 mins... I dont know how long aggro lasts but they were commited, too bad they dont know how to use stairs.
---
Ah
---
It's probably from people using a Commando build blowing through tons of ammo and thinking that it does superior damage over everything else because of the fire rate. What I'm talking about is a semi-auto rifle build. Name the top end fixer and I've owned it. I just don't see the dps as a good thing for a semi-auto rifle build.
---
I woulda never noticed because i only got this bundle for the underarmor
---
No, he is an asshole for letting someone do all the work and then stealing it.  I guarantee you that player didn't *need* the ore. There is a gentlemen's code and most people consider stealing workshops a dick move unless someone is just hogging multiples or being a douche.  Many low levels legit need the resources and I'd personally never attack them.
---
They did a great job with leveled enemies (though maybe not SO great) and fixing some things but this particular system is murdering foully my desire to get myself involved into playing this game again. And a lot of guys here on reddit (including you ofc) suggested a big amount of various ways to resolve the issue. Hope devs or whoever is responsible for that will at least get ideas from others' suggestions
---
All we can is hope for the best here. Thanks for your support!
---
I think the problem would be if you start the mission but aren't doing it right away and are running around and see something you want to take a picture of because it's cool or neat or what ever and now the photo doesn't save? Unless they could figure out how to avoid that, which why would they even risk the backlash if there was an issue, then they won't even look into the option because going in and selecting what to delete works just fine. They probably could have a "save to gallery?" Pop up where you select yes or no when you take a photo but then That could get tedious having to view and decide right then if your doing action or combat shots
---
Not sure why you're using First Aid with a Bloodied build.  With your health so low (assuming you're rolling around at 20%) you have no need for that extra healing as the initial burst enough from even a Diluted Stimpack is going to be enough to bring you to "full" even from like, 1% HP.
---
Also you've got Power Armor perks but Sneak Perks too?  What's your playstyle man, I kinda wanna help you out here.
---
How does this bring bring the community closer? People are just mindlessly grinding minding their own business.
---
Its mid tier. X-01, Strangler, and T-65 are all better. I wouldnt think it was that valuable...but that's just me
---
Most people seem to be eating out of Bethesda's hand, so I doubt the game will ever see any meaningful change. I canceled my fallout first and I'm taking a pretty significant break after I complete this legendary run. I definitely won't be doing the next one.
---
I was using it to make assualtrons crawl yesterday. Working as usual on xbox.
---
I do suspect that different enemies have resistances to being staggered and crippled
---
I'm not excited for "legendary" perks, though I am excited for the S.P.E.C.I.A.L Legendary perks, having to run with low Perception, Endurance, and Charisma to max points into other stats is a massive pain in the arse.  
---
If all I ever got was the specials i'll be happy.
---
It seems like the game is  becoming destiny now
---
Well i get that. When i see the event, i switch my build from unarmed to heavy guns with PA and I have to put nearly everything on me in a stash box to move properly.
---
Thx cuz I was told its worth max caps but ik that isn't true but I'm being offered 10k caps should I sell?
---
If only the dailies and weeklies didn't keep auto completing....
---
You get a full set by completing the BoS questline so I don't think it's actually worth anything. If it weren't for the upcoming power armor displays I'd sell you mine for 10k caps anytime.
---
Eh most people on ps4 tend to ignore people
---
Thats exactly my point. I dont mind collecting myself. But i will get nowhere near rank 4 this way...
---
1 woman and 3 super mutants in thier underware... Ive seen where these types of movies lead... wonder what kinda wasteland stds super mutants spread around. "You are suffering from glowing pustules"
---
K so I should sell, thx
---
I would say it’s not very valuable as you get it from a mission and I recently bought a full set of upgraded ultracite for 2.5k caps
---
my understanding is you get six legendary perk card slots starting at Lvl 50 for one, Lvl 75 fo two, Lvl 100 for three, Lvl 150 for four, Lvl 200 for five and Lvl 300 for six. 
---
To fully level up an attribute Legendary card requires 400 perk coins which add 5 special points to your chosen attribute to the maximum of 15 points per attribute. for example, if you have 12 strength and added a strength Legendary perk card, you can only add 3 more points to strength.
---
Now for my character, I could add six attribute cards and max level them, however, I would need to gain 2400 levels to do so 6 x 400 perk coins. 
---
they haven't confirmed final numbers of perk coins gained from cards as the first time they were worth 1 coin for static cards and 5 coins for animated cards, this changed to 1 for al cards and has changed again to two coins per card. 
---
We also don't know what the final number of coins will be needed to fully level cards
---
I'd like to know it as well to plan for another 1st month.
---
PS4 legendary perks?  Never heard of them
---
Downvote your ammo comment. They are making mobs harder to kill, which will use more ammo. I have no problem with people gaming a broken system.
---
Oh I'm on xbox :)
---
K I'll def sell then
---
I just got a Lever to drop from a settler on my way to the Garrahan Mining Headquarters for the Excavator set, problem is that I don't have any mods for it :/
---
Happy cake day btw!
---
Last night me and 2 others failed it. They seemed to not know why but I was happy with the xp and loot.
---
Don't even get me started on the Tesla rifle meta.
---
If it's unmodded I'd sell it for 10k in a heart beat. You can get the plans for free at Fort Defiance, and the SBQ drops them like candy.  It only becomes an expensive set if it's modded with the emergency protocols, calibrated shocks and targeting hud because plans for those are extremely rare.
---
LOL I think I was at this fight.  I was also standing in the corpse of the queen when the mirelurk king popped up and started killing people.  I ended up killing it but not before a couple players got nailed.
---
I didn't count the flybys but it was many.
---
The fact that they got a multiplayer game to work in this engine at all could be classified as a digital miracle. By all accounts this engine is the worst modern game engine in existence.
---
I've no idea mate, sorry. I'm not a PA user, so I'm unsure of your dilemma. I just know stat wise it's mid tier.
---
&lt;== Full Health Two handed/Heavygunner PA build
---
Thx for the info
---
That's kind of insane to get 10k caps for Ultracite PA. It's pretty easy to make. &gt;_&gt;
---
I finished the legendary run 2 days ago. Haven't logged in since. What use is there? I can't earn atoms with dailies, weeklies, I'm lvl 400, I have everything I want from gold bullion. So I'm taking a break until daily ops. Those seem fun at least.
---
And that is the worse part: used to be you dealt less damage if you didnt have a full draw, which goes to show they clearly designed it but for whatever reason decided to patch it
---
I didn't realize they did anything like that. I just thought it had a higher perception and killed the only one I've seen
---
Nuka quantum paddles are even better at moving corpses. 😉
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Why can’t you see it change? They could just add it to the randomized mutation list. 
---
The PTS is specifically there to test out new features and mechanics. If you are in the PTS, submit your feedback.
---
After Todd adds a couple more game breaking bugs.
---
Yeah, some people just arent trying to deal with all that
---
I have turned up to participate and boom I am playing 1994 Doom. It is laggy and annoying. So I sometimes have to just run about avoiding everyone.
---
Lemme get like a salt-upon wounds style helmet for it
---
Thanks to people who share the Mysterious Stranger so he can scare the bejeezus out of me on a regular basis. I never use him so he's always a surprise.
---
&gt; log on every day even if you don’t want to. 
---
Then don't. Fear of missing out is an incredibly powerful tool, used in these situations because of the audiences lack of self control and the understanding that humans can be incredibly weak and easily manipulated. Of course, we blame the game, society or anything other than accepting we should be taking responsibility for our own behaviour.
---
And incite the wrath of Todd? I don't think so lol.
---
The ammo converter certainly needs a buff and to be addressed further. If this is done, it could be a satisfying way to also reward ammo in terms of their relative value. Is 500 2mm the same value as 500 5mm?
---
Ha!
---
WHAAAAT?!
---
Do you only get disconnected from fallout 76?
---
You could put your Xbox in the DMZ on your router. It will put your Xbox outside the firewall but I've had to do this before and I haven't had a problem with that but you'd have to make up your own mind about it.
---
Also, if your Xbox is close to your router you can connect it wired by Ethernet.
---
Also, this post might help.

I just want the ammo factory perk card. Couldn't care less about the other ones.
---
10k is a great deal for you. Unmodded it's not worth much of anything
---
Why did you think repair kits were a thing if you could only repair from work benches? 🤣 You must been hella confused like gee why did Bethesda release these if you have to go to the bench anyway there's no point! And rocking a legacy laser or flamer must have been torture for you bro 🤣🤣🤣 my deepest sympathies I really wish everyone could have the true knowledge of this game. Maybe I'll start a class 👍
---
&gt;This is a good thing. For all my bitching here, this is a step in the right direction for this game. It is end-game stuff that requires a group unless you are really
---
Ah so fuck solo players then? Okay cool, I wonder if someone on ebay is interested in getting the game now.
---
Alright, INT 1 Dweller, calm down.
---
That description was the closest thing to being there.  Have an upvote and write more.
---
I've only encountered it twice.  The first time it went fine.  The second time its pathing broke and I had to kinda of "push" it around until it fixed itself.
---
You've obviously never owned a legacy laser or flamer 😅
---
Also try clearing cache.

At least a little bit more "legendary" than "not legendary at all".

I have 9 charisma cause I am a medic heavy gunner build so I usually share Blocker at level 3.

Cause they're sad fucks to put it simply
---
I mean, I've had all 3 of the dev room paddles on display at my camp for months 🤣 I even take them down sometimes when people are taking too long at a vendor. A couple blue explosions and people are like "huh, wtf was that" and while they wonder I snag the vendor 👍
---
Guys, i'm interested in figuring out what kind of crap is happening with autocomplition. I'd like to gather some data, so if you don't mind pls tell :
---
1.What platform are you using?(PC/XBOX/PS) 
---
2.What Internet connection speed do you have?
---
3.On what kind of storage your game is installed (ssd/hdd)?
---
Thank you in advance!
---
I play on pc now but I still use my trusty Ps4 headset. It's really good value.
---
I agree that damage nerfs were needed but I just feel that waht they did was much to extreme for melee especially and made some perks/aid buffs feel like they barely do anything.
---
I think they should have the damage perk cards go up to 30% each and revert the explosives one to 100%, also give unarmed some love maybe make the card 30% too or even 40%, having stronger base cards is much more realistic now, that it's not multiplicative, as it won't go out of control when legendarys and aids are added but rather be a flat, predictable increase.
---
I also feel that making things take more ammo doesn't really make them "harder" as much as it makes them more annoying, the way mutations for ops work is much cooler and much more fun for increasing enemy difficulty
---
I don't particularly dislike them. I'll go for stealth damage right away and probably STR and AGI or PER. 
---
I also particularly don't like that I need to use perk coins to switch them. Why should I keep the ammo crafting one always on? Why should I waste a coin to switch it after it took me 450 to level it?
---
Have you tried just doing it without crouching on the PTS?
---
Cool, thanks. Also “As a Berserker I appreciate your thoughtfulness” is a pretty funny sentence (if we didn’t know the context).
---
If, if, if. This is BGS we are talking about. All we get are bugs and "fixes" no one asked for or wanted. If you are going to make me use 40% more ammo, I'm not spending the majority of my valuable in game playtime farming for ammo crafting materials. That's re-goddamned-diculous.
---
I run a stealth commando, non bloodied. just Adrenal mutation with a furious handmade rifle. With all the right perks the scorched go down in 1 or 2 shots and a scorched beast dies before it can take off again.
---
I either use my BOS combat armor with a chameleon arm or the Chinese Stealth suit, which is a bit OP for getting them sneak criticals.
---
Bloodied doesn't need a buff. It has the same trigger as 2 other sources of major damage.
---
There's plenty of support for a Bloodied build that makes it worth it already.
---
Strange in numbers OFC
---
I don't even understand your text.
---
Explosive guns are much harder to trigger magic with.  If the explosion hits another enemy or even another body part, it cancels out any potential magic damage. Try any non-explosive weapon instead.
---
definitely gonna get me a set for this Op, yeah. should be a breeze then.
---
Just play on console :)
---
Todd does work in mysterious ways.
---
Are the perk coins shared between all your characters?
---
Just hop off the grind and play other games its the best thing you can do if you find the game to be boring and maybe hop on it again when season 2 releases and decide if you want to grind for it.
---
Thanks. That's awesome. I'm bored of one shotting everything.
---
Jumped down off a car roof at Whitespring and straight into the "underworld."  Slow countdown to death then "loot marker" on the surface but no way in Hell of retrieving the loot.  It's a "feature" not a "bug," eh?
---
yeah I personally play bloodied mostly for the unyielding specials and the insane damage mitigation perk choices, you really don't need the bloodied effect on live. 
---
I would have loved to see more perk cards, like add ones which give other effects when addicted like adding resistance for each addiction up to a cap or making things a bit more interesting like having movement speed increase by 5% upto 25% or improve perception with addictions (like you are looking out for chems) and stuff like that or for berserkers with the new damage calculations make them do much more damage as they really are vulnerable or add a perk that works well with it like melee kills while not wearing armor reduce incoming damage by x% for 3 seconds with a few ranks and such
---
I would love to see this change, if you clear the reserved space on XB1 you lose all 50 of your photos, this would be a good way to avoid that happening as well.
---
They could make a stash slot or two where you could assign a specific perk cards to affect just stash. :D
---
That's a good question right here. And the answer is "No". Because Beth never thought to incentivize us playing with other characters. Current system basically punishes you for playing lots of different chars.
---
They nerfed *EVERYTHING.*
---
Not gonna happen.  They like selling subs to FO1 too much.
---
To Be Fair...
---
How long have you been with this game and what level are you? 
---
I would imagine your not a bloodied build because your either jealous or don’t like extra damage.
---
It takes quite a bit of effort to get a proper bloodied build and we run around with no health. One sneaky mirelurk king and we’re toast. 
---
Have you considered the amount of people that have put countless hours to construct this build to be good at PvE?
---
If we’re talking PvP, bloodied is not your problem. It’s the duped weapons, armor, quantums and stealth boys. Do not blame bloodied builds for your insta-death on a claimed workshop in public servers.
---
I agree that balance is terrible in this game, but don’t take away the one thing that a lot have worked so hard for to actually be able to get a win in this god forsaken mess of a game.
---
Bloodied builds are for PvE. The meta for PvP has moved onto Junkies
---
Those dicks that one shot legendaries are assholes not wanting to share with other members. You don’t need a bloodied build to kill a legendary before everyone else can get a hit.
---
I’ve been preparing myself with a full health medic build as well as a full health junkies build in case this ever happened but this is not the answer. Buffs on other legendary effects is. 
---
Thank you for reading ❤️
---
The fact that people who had these in their inventory were unbanned last month really shows how little bethesda cares tbh
---
I got a mule that I do this all time with. Jump off a cliff, punch a car till it explodes, just get myself dead. I'm on ps4. Hit x to respawn and go to my friends list and hit respawn here after I have them go to the spot I wanna respawn at. I'm carrying like 1400 pounds. Or find someone that's not on my team that's at my camp while I'm dead, invite to team, team up, hit x to respawn, go to teammates name and respawn here.
---
And maybe buy 3 ammo individually if you still need to do that, but then you see they are selling .38 for 2 caps a piece and decide to just leave because thats not cool.
---
SPECIAL perks offer good flexibility, these ones are really nice. Especially considering that you can take several rank one perks for other stats and just swap special points to the one you need.
---
Also, free respeccing is mandatory here, I don't know why beth refuses to admit that.
---
I'm using Steam to launch the game
---
Dang I am yet to find a legacy to buy lol
---
Do you have to keep all four scavengers alive in order to get rare drops?
---
It was probably worth something like this early after release because players with the plans were still rare, but the plans are everywhere now, personally j drop them on the ground because you get one every SBQ fight and I've learned them all. The most expensive thing to make the base armor is the flux. Personally I think 10k is fair.
---
Yup, and reach rank 4 in ores collected
---
That's why I was saying the candelabras. they're a little animal avatistic. I don't know how you earn them, someone who I public teamed with decorated my cabin with some and they're pretty cool but I can't move them.
---
There's a fairly ugly stand lamp that's like one of the first basic ones you get that does a decent job of giving you moderated light.
---
I also found vaulting the ceiling a little bit and putting the lights way up high gets you out of the bright Hayes Corona thing.
---
I don't know which platform you're using I'm using the PS4 pro, but I get pretty good medium density lighting.
---
I think I used the really basic bear bulbs, or maybe the ones that hang down on like a little metal pole. The brightness of the individual light appliances varies rather sharply.
---
Increase stash space by 50 every 50 levels at least. Makr leveling more attractive and rewarding after hitting max level for guns/armor.
---
Too many rules.  And why would Bethesda spend money making this when it would only appeal to only a minor fraction of the player base?  They have plenty to work on and Nuclear Winter already does PVP adequately.
---
you try bird bones? also, serendipity a bro

Hi fellow Player,  
---
I have this Bug constantly since the Release of Wastelanders multiple Times per Day. My Turrets attacking the Wandering Traders, an Ally or themselves (the last one did not happen for over a month so it's maybe fixed?).
---
What happens to me quite a lot is: (Spoiler, see at ur own Risk):
---
&gt;!I finished the Questline of Commander Daguerre and choose to keep both her and A.T.H.E.N.A as an Assaultron. If you do that, A.T.H.E.N.A becomes a Wandering Trader. However the difference between A.T.H.E.N.A and the other Wandering Traders is, that She fires back when she gets Attacked by my Turrets and she deals a lot of Damage especially with the Buggy Asssaultron Laser that still exists in the Game since Ages. My Turrets shoot back but shes Invincible, like all NPC Traders. If I don't recognize it fast enough and leave the World then it can happen that A.T.H.E.N.A demolishes half of my Camp. It's really annoying and I hope they fix this bug ASAP.!&lt;
---
Point is though if you don’t want guess what? Don’t grind for it
---
It’s been working fine for me, but I don’t use an explosive shotgun. It may be that the explosion no longer triggers the perk and that you have to actually hit the target with pellets instead.
---
I mean, a low level could have just bought it themselves for that cheap...
---
Sounds like they created an issue and then a fix for that issue. We'll see where everything lands.
---
From I saw being in stealth is not needed at all. Enemies will die nonetheless.
---
It'd be super easy for them to make a "Boss" of each area. Scorchbeast Queen, Wendigo Colossus, Mirelurk Broodmother, Epic Behemoth, Mole Miner Machine using that one transportation Drill as an Add fight, a Grafton Monster/Snallygaster Hybrid. Most of those can use mostly reused assets too.
---
Ahh okay I see. 
---
I had assumed those were more like "tiers" of armor, with leather being the very first that you get and the worst, then metal being the second worst, and so on.
---
Yeah probably the best answer for it, still so stuff I almost have in season 1 I want.
---
The plans or the actual outfit, etc?
---
Damage itself got a nerf. It's honestly not THAT big of a deal unless you run a lot of multipliers like a bloodied or a junkie build though. Weapons themselves haven't been nerfed too badly.
---
Never did and never will.
---
Fair point, but it’ll still put a smile on someone’s face.
---
That’s pretty hard, I can keep all four at full hp if I guard the tunnel but won’t have time for ore, but if I go get ores they will drop like flies most of the time. The problem with noobs with duped god rolls is that they would try to loot the ghouls as soon as they kill one, and let more ghouls run past them, and as soon as that happens it’s mission impossible.
---
"orbital strike minigun" - seriously does this work like I'm imagining where every single bullet causes an orbital strike and the game runs at like 5fps if it hasn't crashed already?
---
Bethesda britta'd it.
---
I want to repress my time with this game, not remember it.
---
Weed helps.
---
Just curious,  what content are you talking about specifically?
---
I thought it was because you unlock legendary perk slots for all characters. So the cards and their upgrades are, let's say, bound to character?
---
At least you remembered the ammo part, some people give out really op weapons but then forget that new levels don't have a way to use them 🤣
---
The damage nerf has been a long time coming, especially for bloodied.
---
*foreshadowing intensifies*
---
I try to just tank damage most the time cause I like GIRTH
---
AFKing events, new meta.
---
There are no plans
---
I sold a set for 15k
---
Thats just a really nice bug, if you use a mining helmet and the backpack it will not light up.
---
I think the green area light of the Pip-Boy lets it look like that,
---
Sorry for bad english.
---
Many of the 15 points in INT are there for the 30% experience buff. The First Aid is there because I have space to fill. The Power Armor weight reduction is there so I can collect and carry several Power Armor Chassis for when I want to solo the Radiation Rumble using the hallway blocking technique. I would just slot the hacking perks instead, but I have a separate hacking loadout which swaps those in as well as the lockpicking perks.
---
I had to quit out to the main menu, then I went back and did the T-fuse first and then the blood sample. That's the only method that worked for me!
---
Nice of you to do that! :)
---
The Free States quest leads you to Harpers Ferry Armory just outside and southeast of the town itself. You need a holotape (found in one of the Free States bunkers, IIRC) to open the gate.
---
The upper town itself with the church is accessible from a gap between the houses on the southeast side of town if you don't have the key for the doors and all the gates are closed.
---
Stealth works as it does now on the PTS, with the exception of the Daily Ops quests. It’s basically nonexistent there.
---
Until they use it and blow themselves up. Might wanna throw a dense torso in the gift bag.
---
Season 2 got much better rewards anyway. The ammo converter and chicken coop will be available to you for gold bullion.
---
You should still be able to do decent damage out of stealth
---
No they need to Nerf the incredibly stupid OP builds.
---
If they buffed all the effects to be on the same level as bloody this game would be even more of a joke.
---
You can't have people walking around steamrolling things with no effort.
---
Especially when those things can be other players.
---
These nerfs have been a long time coming.
---
I run full Vanguard armor at full health. I use all Anti Armor weapons mostly Fist Melee and Heavy Guns.  With the right combo of mutations and perk cards I am a walking tank that 1 hits nearly everything in the game and I never die. Its a pretty fun way to play and I don't spend my whole life in a loading screen. Bloodied is great but has a lot of draw backs. The drawbacks for my  build is that i go through a fair amount of Radaway  and I can't melt the big bosses (SBQ, Imposter SS or the PP Alpha...)
---
Stealth Riflemen won't have a chance, nor will melee players.  This is the stupidest idea ever.  Bethesda could rebalance the game and add fun events without alienating or excluding more than half of the current builds. 
---
I'm seriously thinking I'm gonna have to blow the dust off of my Quad Tesla just to have a chance in this silly cloakfest while I'll have no ability to use stealth.  Yeah.. that makes sense. Make the enemies invisible, remove player stealth and add in a vanishing superboss at the end.   And who really wants to see the Tesla rifle re-emerge as the new meta weapon?
---
Nerfing the shit out of damage, then nulling stealth.. that affects literally everyone negatively.  What is fun about that?
---
I love the game and have thousands of hours playing it, but this baffles me.
---
You just want to see newbs self-immolating.
---
I probably have the most fun with my Furious Gatling Ultracite Lazer. Having 999 rounds per core is awesome. I use Vampire for really tanky baddies.
---
I am a full health PA build.  No junkies.  I have no problem killing anything in the wasteland.  I dont get the big deal.  It seems like you all are going from 1 shot to kill everything except SBQ to 1 shot to kill everything except the SBQ.
---
Stealth commando with no bloody build as well. You should be able to 1 shot scorched if they arent in combat.
---
I think you missed Wastelanders. Theres quite a few new things for you.
---
Hundreds of levels?
---
Xbox someone build this for
---
Me at my camp lol -  im not even trying make the run / just playin as normal
---
For me the biggest hit is being retroactively punished for trying out different builds and moving special points around. Now they added on a consequence to doing that such a gut punch.
---
Re do your build, my stealth commando character’s only issue is keeping up with ammo because I’m to cheap to buy more
---
Hear me out, stealth suit mk2 skin
---
Love it!
---
MODUS is by far my favourite character in the Fallout series. The sinister pauses between words, the tone and filtered voice used during Bots on Parade sound awesome. The voice acting is so on point.
---
ELIMINATE HOSTILES.
---
Silly question but I need to make sure...if you use a gatling laser or plasma, do they drop full cores?
---
That's probably what happened to the guy who stuck it in the vendor for 65 caps!
---
Furious Ultracite Gatling Plasma. It's so insanely ammo efficient. 1400 shots per Stable Yellowcake Flux and people practically give away plasma cores. Currently sitting on 280 Ultracite ones.
---
I'd just kill for the Gatling Plasma Splitter to actually work.
---
I dont even know what are you talking about ppl, same as other ppl I m sure. What about adding a screenshot or a short clip?
---
No, that is a deliberate and willful and biased misreading of what I wrote. It's not pay to win if you have to fight a legitimate fight to obtain gear. Doing so on a private server with friends ensures other people will not be stealing legendary kills out from under you after you have contributed effort towards getting them to spawn. Likewise, it ensures you cannot steal kills from other people after they have contributed effort towards getting them to spawn.
---
But... They did nerf all weapon damage, the thumbnail is accurate. Furthermore the video itself isn't exactly against the nerf neither if you take the few minutes to watch it.
---
Edit: link https://youtu.be/R6GJPSlyvLE
---
Everything? Not being a dick here, but how do know this? Has it already happened, if not, then they havent nerffed anything......yet. I just wanna see where ppl are getting this info from. I'm not talking about psn:billybob6969 (made up name) saying this stuff, I'm talking about from the ppl or ones that will be doing the implementation. Not that I trust them either, lol. After watching them do a PTS of the colossus, nerffing would have made it unkillable.......for them. Anyway, point me in the right direction of this info? Oh and htf did you make the word EVERYTHING slanted like that?
---
FO76 is so badly designed and developed that it still has major problems nearly 2 years on.
---
Will they ever address these problems permanently - nope, not a chance.
---
FO76 is in the product wind down stage where they try to minimise losses.
---
I thankfully found out about them through Reddit before my first run in with one. I don't kill radstags unless they attack me first, but I certainly wouldn't have known to follow the observant one either. I would have just figured it was a reference to some fandom I know nothing about and kept walking or, like you, figured it had higher perception than most, but unlike you, still wouldn't have killed it. ;)
---
Wouldn’t be a true fallout 76 experience without blowing yourself up at least once!
---
I'd give you 5k caps for It, but giving it away is nice too.
---
Bethesda: "And now for my next trick, a skin that when you apply it, your character gets deleted!"
---
Not silly at all. No they don't, unfortunately.
---
Also, I'm not quite certain if this counted as a "Discussion" because I was mostly just sharing my first few experiences with Fallout 76, along with any reccomendations professionals at the game may have for me. I also apologize if I'm doing a lot of shit wrong.
---
Its an issue with a badly developed game being released years before its at acceptable beta quality.
---
I typically walk everywhere, so I've found it twice so far and have taken pictures both times. Both had loot for me. First one I saw was soon after I learned about them on Reddit. Otherwise I wouldn't have known to follow it.
---
It wouldn't even be that hard. There's plenty of reskins or reusable assets to make new raid bosses. Put 1 in every Region so the nukes get spread around. Give each of them a unique affix and drop 4 different specific weapons like Earle. That way each type of weapon in the game get's 2 different options.
---
Lone Wanderer /s
---
My only wish is that we could get mods to reduce spin up time. You get penalized for pausing in between enemies (getting swarmed for example). Hell make it a perk card or a  new mod with bullion.
---
They aren't in the game yet
---
Well it’s like the 100th time they’ve tried selling this miserable pack and I’m still not biting
---
This is about not getting weapons you can use until level 5 as far as I understood it, not about the general damage calculation changes
---
And scrap kits send your junk to your stash or scrap box if you have one
---
I wonder how bad this backpack clips with the secret service jetpack. I gave up on the run after I lost score. The backpack was the only thing I wanted but realistically I think it'll clip and I just can't give up my Blue ridge caravan backpack I paid 6500 caps for the plan.
---
They made damage bonus additive, not multiplicative like we have right now so everything is nerfed. Builds that stack damage bonus like bloodied are hit the most.
---
Except you don't. You can freeze her with a non-legendary cryolator, just put the crystallizing barrel on it.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Whining you can't destroy enemies effortlessly makes so sense to me.
---
Kevduit put it pretty well, he can't stand making FO76 vids anymore because the lack of challenge just makes it a chore, and his personality doesn't bleed into his videos when he isn't enjoying the thing he's doing.
---
I keep reminding myself this game was immensely fun when starting out a year ago. Me and my fiancée just when on scavenger runs together, both logging on for the night when we read about sugar grove. Just ignoring the main questline for a bit. Exploring the world with no spoilers but the map that came in the VDSG we picked up for £2.
---
I hope they nerf legacy as well
---
Duping is cheating no matter how you try to moralise doing it.
---
&gt;Is the mailman hurting you
---
And goat legs
---
Haven't touched the Gatling Laser in 76 since I wasn't a fan of it in 4, but the Gatling Plasma has an annoying bug where as long as the weapon is spinning at all even if it's spinning down you can't use any consumables. You actually have to tap fire to reset the barrel if you don't wait it out.
---
During events every legendary should leave a very obvious glowing corpse that anyone participating can loot the legendary item from whether you tagged it or not.
---
So if they add eggs to the chicken coop and allow you to milk the bramen. Does that mean they should also add recipes that use them like fried eggs, cream, scrambled eggs, maybe even cake?
---
We play with a guy that just found out you can run. He played all of FO4 without running either. You can't in 3 so he just assumed. He thought we were cheating because we were so zoomy.
---
Because it doesn’t use resources
---
They’re fun tho I appreciate trap camps some are so elegant and creepy
---
All damage calculations have been adjusted across the board. It was mentioned ITV
---
do you know how many fallout 1st subscriptions they would lose? do you think bethesda cares more about legitimate players or about fallout 1st? it's a rhetorical question obviously
---
Too many
---
I’m not sure why the Bethesda forum posts don’t get stickied on the front page here.
---
ITV?
---
Hmm.  Fair enough.  Wasn't even aware there was a way to do that with RR.  But even then I'd still probably drop INT by 3 points and remove First Aid altogether, and make it up with a Food Buff (Brain Fungus Soup if Herbivore, Scorchbeast Brain if Carnivore - should be anywhere from +5 to +8 depending on whether or not someone's sharing Stranger In Numbers, or you swap Travel Agent out for it).  Plus, the bonus from Building Public Teams (which even if solo, you can create one with just you in it for at least one additional point of INT).  Or get hold of some Unyielding pieces to just generally boost all your stats (save for END).
---
You could then move those 3 points over to Luck to take R3 Bloody Mess for some more damage, or Strength to pick up Traveling Pharmacy for more weight reduction, or Barbarian for some extra DMG resistance.  Or just throw them into AGI to both increase your overall sneak ability and to get some more ranks into Adrenaline for even more bonus damage (though that's up to you, given the changes to damage bonuses coming in Patch 22).
---
Was at 160 million out of 150 million last time I checked yesterday.
---
“You fucking donkey”- Gordon Ramsey
---
Might not be the game for you
---
Inside the Vault...and yes, they are changing the damage multipliers so they are additive, not multiplying.
---
Bloodied sees the biggest change, because it does the most damage, but there will be a reduction across the board.
---
Looks like my decision to go with a tank build and quad weapons was the correct one.
---
Inside the vault.
---
Consider both. If you can find a weight reduced heavy weapon and take Bandolier, things can really start to sing.
---
Encryptid, don’t forget the ISS.
---
Why buff? People are one shotting everything and you need even more damage?
---
Same. Theres one passive that regenerates rads. But that’s it. It’s so lackluster.
---
Like come on Beth. Add some truly difficult content and give us some method to start power creeping
---
Man. That’s a terrible change.
---
I didn’t say it wasn’t cheating. I just said we ain’t pieces of shit. You and the other downvoter should read it first.
---
Why do you immediately look at the highest, most maxed out level - and assume that's what you HAVE to hit???  Why not look at it as - there are people who play this game all day.  It gives them something to strive for.
---
Personally I'm excited for legendary perks - and the quality of life &amp; other options they'll give with more specials.  (not to mention lockpicking/hacking).
---
What do you get from rank 4? A special reward?
---
I'm 99% sure we made it. The arrow is green like the rest and the day before we were only off by 10 million cork.
---
They should at least make perk points shared between characters
---
How about an Arena with rewards, and ranking. The rewards could be used to buy cosmtics or to buy the same items the purveyor sells.
---
Basically the way it works is:
---
Your rank goes up as you win, quickly at first, and slowly after that. If you lose a few matches in a row, your rank will go down. Your rank will not determine your rewards, but it will measure your abilities based on the overall communities. Your rank determines who you are paired to fight against, that way if you are low rank, you don't have to worry about being destroyed by a high rank player with an OP weapon and setup.
---
You will earn currency though winning fights, and before the start of the fight you can wager some of that currency by placing it in a bin. Who ever wins will receive the currency directly to their inventory.
---
To keep the ranked fights fair upon entering arena mode it would need to place the character into a matchmaking setup to find a fairly close ranked player.
---
Additionally it would be nice to see an arena added to adventure mode, no rewards for this mode, but just for fun duels with friends or random others.
---
Basically everywhere off the fight floor would be a non PVP zone, up on entering the PVP zone there are no restrictions. Also an instanced version could be accessed with your team by entering a "staging area door" this would allow you to fight your team without outside interference.
---
It will happen. It has to
---
I bought sleek for the legs but I might but deep pocketed when it releases.
---
And all misc items. Ore and tokens have weight too.
---
Well, it’s very early in the PTS. Most likely the final version released to live will be different.
---
Personally, it won’t affect me very much, if at all. And if bloodied players have to kill things in 3 hits, instead of 1, I don’t see much of an issue with that.
---
People are one shotting everything because everything is like level 40. And other builds are not one shotting. I’m not asking for bloodied and junkies to be buffed, but everything else! That does include enemies.
---
He means make other builds relevant and useful.
---
I usually wait to craft ammo until I’m totally out in case I end up finding a better or more fun weapon that I want ammo for, so it can stock up a bit for me.
---
I’m on Xbox and it happened with my plasma caster which made it amazing during the queen fight lol it happens after I use my higher ammo weapons and they break, when I switch to the plasma caster it gets all the ammo that the last gun holds and the amount it holds itself but it’s never been over 600 though
---
I run junkies but I have tons of other stuff just in case.
---
I'd rather see buffs than nerfs though.
---
Yes - it's very strange, I'm with you.  It's really hard to find much info out on this game.
---
I am continually moving things around, rethinking them, adjusting the loadouts as inspiration hits.
---
These are the loadouts I am using on the main at this moment, as copied from the saved settings file. Moving that many points to INT near the beginning of the legendary season journey thing hurt a bit, so one of the first things I will do when legendary perks come out is slot six of the seven SPECIAL cards so I can boost my damage after rearranging points to accommodate them. I already have it all planned out. I will probably also boost a couple of those to two points; I think I will have enough scrapping points for it. None of the other new perks hold any interest to me for all-around usage except for perhaps the poison resist one. The ammo one is very nice, and I will use it when crafting ammo, but I don't foresee ever spending points to boost it until all my SPECIAL cards are leveled.

---
This is not "OP builds nerf" it's "all damage multiplying nerf". They changing the formula of damage multiplying. It's not that bloodied weapons now damage less, it's all legendary modifiers add less damage
---
Sry if bad english.
---
I hope so. It would be nice to see other builds get more damage and enemies become stronger in general tbh. Like mole miners for example, they’re never above level 45, it’s kinda crazy.
---
I mean that makes sense though.  They'd be pretty inefficient to not reuse tons of models and textures where they can.  I mean even playing it its basically just fallout 4 with multiplayer baked into it.
---
I'm doing like 6k per shot with my instigatin gauss rifle at full health.
---
Gotcha. Thought they changed that too. Maybe that's just how PTS is working not how live will be
---
I cap most junk at 100/150 depending on which junk it is. If it goes over I bulk it and sell it for quick caps and if I run out of plastic I throw the rest out.
---
I am in the same boat.  Needing insane levels to max six cards, and that is assuming you pick the right six cards first.  If this is 100% extra and isn't expected to be consumed content then I am fine with it as is since everyone will get their cards at their own pace.  
---
If they are going to ever use this as the 'core' of a section of the game, they are going to lose player base.  The carrot is dangling way too far away to be in any way enticing for most of the player base.  Cause no Bethesda, we aren't short sighted enough to see each step as the goal, we see how far away the end is and it is discouraging.
---
I've been waiting for this moment. Get rekt bloodied builds. 🤣
---
All builds are useful and are more than enough to kill everything in Appalachia. They are just not as good as bloodied
---
And that’s awesome! Shame Berserkers can’t do that.
---
For what moment? You don’t want other builds to do more damage?
---
Were you logged in during server reset day rollover?
---
Berserkers would do like 5k
---
I don’t think it’s intentional, the same thing happens with some of the glasses options. Just the way the pipboy Light works with “glass” items on the player
---
Wow seems you named everything I do :)
---
He is so (sinister pause) iconic 😂😂
---
This is what this subreddit doesn’t understand about the game. 76 is a game designed for casuals, which is why it’s still going to maintain its player base despite all of the ‘I’m leaving this game,’ posts.
---
I don't. Cause we do way too muck already and this game is a joke
---
lmao they really arent nerfed. 
---
base damage was a little, but not the spash damage, so basically no, they arent nerfed.
---
Same. They say it'll be patched soon. My second toon wants that bullion! Commenting for updates
---
I don't, i feel i do enough damage with my builds as is. I think we all did too much damage and now maybe we won't 1 shot everything. Also now that damage is a bjt tighter between builds because calculations are now additive Bethesda can balance enemy resistance better.
---
Yeah, i don't mind them existing, just so long as they are on equal par with their ballistic equivalent.
---
Theres only a chance for something to drop, like rare plans. Rad barrel is the one im after. It also drop rare outfit like mount emmet hazmat suit.
---
There are now Level 100 enemies in the PTS.
---
A lot of players are going to rethink their builds and overall strategy.
---
The days of an “easy button” build are probably over.
---
Honestly I almost never see players wearing it. Usually they are invisible
---
leave my legacies alone whore
---
You can put a silencer on the combat shotgun, so that can play into your stealth (which I assume you use with your lever). The Gatling Gun and .50 Cal are also really great reliable backups for just about any build.
---
Yeah, I run it for xp.  Unless I'm with usually group then one of us will try and get at least enough ore to not fail.  If no one else rocks up for the event though pure xp grind.
---
How many do you have?
---
I sell the plans for the mods for 1 cap each. They are as common as rain.
---
Unfortunately this is correct. Upgraded perk cards are tied to one character with no ability to refund resources spend for the upgrade. This is what we on pts forums try to point out amongside multitude of other issues for Beth to address.
---
Read updates. Tl:dr: it is a Daipy Ops reward, and it heals you from diseases!
---
That's the only thing that makes them good, the splash damage is still as high as it was on other weapons before they nerfed it across the board. For some reason they didn't fix energy weapons though, so that's what makes them so powerful.
---
Energy weapons In general need a buff if anything, not a nerf.
---
I think OP’s point is that once this change gets implemented it will be much easier to buff up perks, etc.
---
Oh well that’s exciting to hear! I guess I’ll just have to wait and see what’s in stock. I still feel like bloodied will reign supreme as usual, which is sad. But I really do hope the changes they make will make other builds more viable.
---
I don't understand how on the one hand Bethesda is terrible for putting in massive grind, but at the same time people are complaining that there left to do. I'm sorry to say but Bethesda is just giving you something to work for, and if you don't like grind that's fair, but you shouldn't be playing Fallout 76 if that's the case. If the game's not fun, why bother?
---
careful you're going to make the moralfags angry arguing with them
---
I don't use bloodied or junkies. I use magic shotgun. I wonder if it will be patched with update 22?
---
It isn't always the damage buff from bloodied but the the SPECIAL bonus from Unyielding that drives my decision to be low health. If I want those legendary perk cards I need XP. So my Intelligence needs to be high to get the most XP. The other star boosts really make a difference as well, STR = carry weight, AGI = Stealth, etc...
---
Finally done with this mess of a quest, thanks a lot man! I had to server jump a couple of times to get it work but it finally analyzed the sample. I have to comment that hospital doors were closed when I managed to successfully analyze the sample, so maybe it's a sign like you said, I don't know.
---
I bought like 5 lvls the other day so I could take a few days off, without possibly loosong the chance at captian cosmos
---
It sounds like it will. I think a lot of players are freaking out, but I believe this will add a new element of challenge and variety to the game. People will be encouraged to try new things and that’s not bad.
---
Drop them in Fissure Site Prime...that’s what I do when I find them.
---
It is not. It is a much needed balancing and damage calculation change. 
---
Jesus I am blooded too, but this whine posts really need to stop. 
---
Even after the PTS “nerf” bloodied is STILL much better than any other build
---
I wish they removed unyielding from the game entirely, it is way too strong and I don’t even mean in combat. Carry weight, xp gain, npc conversation options, stealth, etc etc etc
---
New to fallout 76 here and joined Uranium fever recently with my lvl 25ish character. At first I thought it was odd that lvl 150+ characters weren’t destroying the mole miners straight away until they started call me over to get a couple shots off. Thank everyone!! I got a couple   Legendary drops I am still using.
---
They were duped to all hell, putting them in your vendor for anything higher than like 5 caps each is foolish. Dont try to make money off of them, its in poor taste
---
About 175 depending on how many ppl bought
---
Yeah and that was honestly the point of my post. I wanted other builds to do more damage so that they would be viable for others to play more, but this way sounds good as well. Can’t wait to try it now!
---
More junk for the trunk.
---
Why tho? I'll buy em off of u
---
why do people fee like they need to rush these. Go play Everquest or Everquest 2 and grind out Alternate Advancement points and tell me how bad this is
---
It’s almost like Bethesda is forcing us to play together. First there are public teams. Now events that are designed for teams made up of different build types. Throw in damage nerfs and enemy buffs. But no, they wouldn’t do that.
---
I agree...also, let’s make legendary enemies difficult then. Each star should make them mutate. Bigger and badder each time.
---
For me the biggest hit is that they refuse to acknowledge that and that's the third time the PTS forums have been swarming with posts about this and other glaring issues of legendary perks.
---
I'm feeling about the same, OP. I can't resist a challenge, so I've been grinding the SCORE with my Lvl 277 (ish). It's gotten to the point that I go on for around 40 minutes, do the challenges and log off. Already ground badges, reputation, Legendary scripts, caps, gold... now I'm grinding my will to live (in Fallout).
---
You know what's funny, though? Since my main takes so long to level, I started a new one the other day in order to meet the level challenge. He's around level 10 or so now. And without all the grinding taking over my game, it's still fun. 
---
I hate to disparage someone else's work but whoever is in charge of giving this game longevity really needs to broaden their options, beginning with giving us challenges that meet all play styles and are not reliant on playing every day. I don't appreciate being manipulated into participating in a cynical money grab because I enjoy Fallout.
---
Not really. My friend runs a full health pistol/gunslinger hybrid, and has no problem one-shotting most things. The pistols are also lighter, usually quicker to reload then an assault rifle, and do about the same damage. 10mm, 38, and 44 ammo are also plentiful, compared to 556 and 45
---
It makes sense to nerf, rather than buff. BGS isn’t going to make the game “easier,” because people would just grind content that much faster.
---
I don’t even main bloodied. My point isn’t about bloodied! It was about making other builds stronger. But as another user pointed out in the comments it actually does sound like a good change overall.
---
But I do get money from em selling them for 70-80 caps apiece in my vendor.
---
I was being *Facetious.*
---
They can’t do anything except take away maybe a dozen worthless internet points I have thousands of, and they can’t call me anything I haven’t heard before.
---
It’s ok for low level. I have same one max lvl and the recoil is horrible and the savage low
---
Because they were duped by the millions. Better to remove them from the game entirely.
---
Yonggo gets it.
---
They've nerfed damage not specific builds. How is this such a hard concept to understand?
---
The legendary perks should have more tiers but a lower upgrade cost.
---
That way at least we get some incremental rewards.
---
Well, I also wanted an enemy buff because they’re too easy rn. But you did state already that there are going to be level 100’s, and that’s exactly what I wanna see haha.
---
110% Agreed. This is Fallout, not some shitty mobile game. I think literally every single Falloyr 76 player is with you on that one
---
The official solution for xbox is to go to your photo gallery in game and then screenshot the photo which will save it to your harddrive or upload to xbox live depending on your settings
---
What do u play on?
---
Fair, if thats been working stick with it.
---
I’m not the one wrote an essay about how much he thinks something in a video game is a waste....
---
U play on xbox?
---
Dude, other build lose maybe 5-15% damage. That’s like NOTHING. 
---
Bloodied loses more than 40% and it’s still better than anything else.
---
Lol. Nice.
---
Yeah it’s def hacked. Even glitched weapons aren’t nearly that good. Plus glitched weapons have a normal texture/appearance, but the hacked .50 very clearly looked like half laser rifle half .50
---
K cuz if you open them u get 50 caps apiece
---
Yeah...this is going to be an interesting change. I am going to sit back and see what gets released. We’re still a month away, at least, so a lot of time to still enjoy what you have.
---
I think the new Daily Ops are going to be a lot of fun.
---
I play two hours every 2-3 days and I'm on level 20 I think?? I've learnt the hard way in previous games that forcing hours and hours into grinding for rewards just ends with me not liking the game anymore, a la Destiny's Christmas event. I do really want that Sheepsquatch plushie though.
---
K thx
---
I think our best hope is just getting more stash space somehow eventually because I don't see them doing that since they released stashbox with unlimited junk storage for 1st.
---
Especially now that there's also an ammo convertor, albeit a very poorly designed interface, it still let's you bulk sell ammo overflow. 
---
So only perks left would be armor or weapons and they don't really want to promote someone hording 1000s of items in their inventories.
---
but muh perk card boosters !!  
---
but muh perk card boosters in legendary runs !11!!!111
---
I'm level 112 and it's better than my wooden box
---
Man, I need to go and look at that ITV. I’m not caught up with it yet. I don’t even know what Daily Ops are and it sounds fun.
---
I play a melee build but I’m not bloodied. With a strength of 12 it’s easy to squash enemies
---
Pretty sure they removed those cards and replaced them.
---
I don't even want the workshop, I just want to kill you
---
It does have an Anti-Cheat, it's just that AFAIK it's limited only to detecting if Cheat Engine is running.
---
WoW sends all unlooted items (except gold) to your mailbox. Unlimited as far as I remember.
---
Instead of making the game interesting and addictive, they want to force us to waste time struggling for necessities such as ammo crafting, this is a really shitty move. I was about to get 1st to store excessive junk, mainly so much steel. Now with more ammo consumption this apparently isn’t necessary. Idiots shot themselves in the foot.
---
why not just open them, you can get more money opening them than selling, not to mention plans and other stuff.
---
there's a new type daily mission on PTS with random modifiers that can literally make your build useless, for example enemies that can only die to meele attacks or invisible enemies that only are visible when they attack you. 
---
There's also a modifier that is permanent and is always on that disable any atemp of sneak, the moment you start the daily you enter into a permanent [danger] status and the enemies always knows were are you so any sort of stealth or low HP bould is not viable on this new type of mission.
---
Yeah, but unfortunately that doesn't keep it up on my loading screens. Lol
---
Been playing since BETA. I have three. And while they’re fun to use sometimes, I’ve never had to use them as a primary. 
---
Have a backup weapon is simply smart planning. 
---
The kits are a useful advantage, for those that need them. 
---
But *necessary*?  Not in the least.
---
The Thorn armor is based on the scout armor I think.So it’s going to be the same as scout armor,but I have no idea under which category that falls.
---
bad loot is a bad loot. but getting it is  GOOD, you can always sell it for scrips, which is good for newbs too !
---
No? I have a min/max-ish VATS Crit Pistol build.
---
Destiny was similar, if it was over a certain rarity, it went to your mailbox.
---
I'm definitely coming back for Daily Ops and Steel Dawn, hopefully in Patch 22, but since the release of Wastelanders I haven't really been into the game. Cancelled my 1st sub and I haven't logged on since. 
---
I will absolutely renew my subscription again once I have things to do in game, but as of right now I'm not really interested in doing busy work. I've definitely felt burnt out as of late myself. Breaks are important, I would advise everybody take one from a game every now and then.
---
How does he know? Where are people getting this info?
---
FROM THE TEST SERVER YOU DUMBASS
---
I tried doing the "play my way" approach. But I got sick of all the Unyielding armor the purveyor kept throwing at me. Out of curiosity I started storing it (instead of scripping it) until I had a full set.  
---
Once I had 5 pieces (didn't take long) I decided to play dressup and take them for a spin, - irradiating myself down to Nerd Rage, of course.
---
Holy shit. The difference was like night and day.
---
So yeah, that's my story. Sometimes you just become a meta slave accidentally.
---
Hey when you get to 100 let me know if it was worth all that.
---
Theyre switching from multiplying modifiers to adding them. This in turn means the more multipliers you stacked in your build, the bigger the nerf. Considering bloodied amout of stacked modifiers, it is nerfed quite a bit. Dont get me wrong, I completely agree with the change. If the vocal minority was better at math, they would understand that this truely was long time coming. Multiplying modifiers simply makes too big of a disparitiy between builds, where its not feasable to roll out content challenging for all. Its either a challenge for bloodied and outright impossible for other builds or its a challenge for casual builds and a cakewalk for bloodied.
---
you can get from 25 to 500 or even 1000 caps.
---
I actually just switched to junkies on my level 200 and bloodied on my level 300 not too long ago. Mainly to try something new. I did perfectly fine right up till then without it. It is fun though
---
Not necessary no, I never use them on anything but my legacy flamer. Anything less is a waste honestly since I go through at least one repair kit per hard event
---
This seems like a bad idea.
---
Quite, I'll lose caps on fast travel to avoid giving the 2+cap army the idea it is OK 😁
---
upvoted.
---
And to answer your question, go watch captainoob's stream from yesterday.  He went into the new daily op with his best melee character and got DESTROYED. He tried everything, even legacies and still got schooled.  If one of the game's best players has to struggle with premium gear and loadouts, how do you expect most average joes will fare?   Did Bethesda not learn *anything* from the vault raid debacle?  People won't play something that is ridiculously hard.  They want to have fun.  The stuff on the PTS now is not fun for the average joe.
---
And if you want the slanty text..  Hit the "I" below your reply before typing something.  It is *italics*.

Just farm lead, steel and gunpower. Latter two is easy from Super Mutants you just need to know where to get lead and that's silos. Every nuke silo has an identical gym with lifting weights in them. They all yield a lot of lead. You shouldnt have trouble with ammo that way. Most other things can easily be farmed.
---
Sturdy.
---
Marine, scout and secret service don’t have a light or heavy class.
---
Watched Juiceheads video earlier and think this looks great tbh.
---
See i just checked it and the cork arrow was green, but the cork counter was still up, saying 0, even though it moved on to plastic yesterday.  Yeah so normal service has resumed i see
---
I use those points for other things. 2 pieces of armor and I don't need any of that. Thanks though.
---
I had one of those I got at low level that I scripped in hopes of getting something “better” :(
---
I was trying out the legendary perk system last night. Nothing inspires my to select the new cards. With multiple slots available for me. I think, I will move a point from each max level 15 special to another lower level one. Example...15 strength, one point moved to luck and add the strength legendary card back. Since it's capped. Likewise with agility, endurance and to luck. My luck will increase from 3 to 7. (luck is my lowest stat) on my tank melee.
---
I still don't really understand why perks don't apply to stash box weight.. Or at least why the hell it doesn't show the actual weight in stash box. I have a lot of perks that reduce weight of different items and every time I put something in my almost full stash box it's a puzzle game because I don't want to unequip the perks every damn time I use my stash..
---
I find this hilarious. Like everyone has 412 unspend levels. 
---
You, sir, are that 0,1%
---
These changes are ment for the other 99,9% of people
---
Queen is immune to explosive damage.   
---
As to why It does 1?  Supposedly the fatman in fo4 technically did 18 impact damage.
---
I use a instagating bow.  Life is pretty rough most days.
---
On the weekly reset 2 hours after the rollover and didn’t do NW before or looked at the store or anything else. 
---
So every person that tells don’t do this don’t do that all complete nonsense. Some of my friends are playing NW been online and never had it
---
Other builds may not one shot, but 2-3 shots isn’t exactly making a challenge. You don’t even need a bloodied weapon to be one shorting enemies.
---
They obviously learned nothing from the Vault Raid Debacle.  Most people will not play things that they can't solo, especially if it isn't fun to begin with.
---
Open them and buy serum recipes and sell serums. Or  buy your weekly gold from smiley. Don’t bother selling the plans from them tho.
---
Seriously this game has only been on a downhill since Wastelanders. They really are out of touch with what and how people like to play.
---
Why would you think it’s not an MMO? Have you played MMO’s?
---
Yeah, which does suck.
---
But it the first step to fixing the balance of combat in this game.
---
SBQ and now Earl should only drop 3* items.
---
And what happens when you take the card off and suddenly your stash is over capacity?
---
Is that what that is?  I thought it was a deathclaw or megasloth behind me or something.
---
The reason they bloodied unarmed got nerfed so heavily was the fact that people were 3-4 shotting the queen with them, it was that powerful. I agree it needed a nerf, but that seems a bit too extreme. Hopefully they'll do some adjusting to that, but who knows.
---
Again, why remove it without a fix at the same time?  That's like removing peoples healthcare plans without a replacement.  Oh, wait... that's the standard in America.
---
Your fine. I’m just happy knowing there’s another player who gave this game a shot disregarding it’s reputation online. 
---
The game itself is fun and can have you your money’s worth of entertainment. Play at your own pace and don’t rush to trying to get a build. 
---
The best part is experimenting with perk cards. But I do recommend focusing on getting damage increasing cards such as bloody mess and weapon specific ones.
---
That's what it is. It's originally the multiplayer for fallout 4, but they decided to make a new game because it wasn't going to be done in time
---
Hello. Sorry for the delay. When will you be on today?
---
I made sure I wrote I'm not trying to be a dick in hopes I wouldn't get a dick responce. I'm trying to see an actual person that's got a video in a PTS or something showing what's going on and informs us. Not some dude that just comments like you. Thanks in advance for your next comment though.
---
I agree, I've had to make some tough choices on what to keep vs delete after playing for so long
---
Legacies where already brought back. On last ex-mode duping method. Everyone I know now has at least 3
---
Imagine repairing that as a new player.
---
“No fun for you, fucking idiots” 
---
-Bethesda, 2020
---
Should the same be said for legacies then?
---
And because someone like Yukichigai (sp?) would come along after 2 months and start a major bug fix mod.
---
Playing on a PS4 and was able to finally get by this by:
---
1. Restarting the game
---
2. Reading all entries on terminal
---
3. Analyzing the Sample
---
4. Inserting T tube
---
Good luck!  Hope it works for ya’ll soon.
---
Sure. If I had my choice, I’d have BGS delete them from the game....doesn’t bother me at all.
---
Not on X Box, no hacked weapons possible as I understand.
---
Are you fucking kidding me? xD do you live under a rock ? Do you know how to use a search button?
---
It’s all over the place, both here and on YouTube. Use your fucking brain, if you have one.
---
they 100% copy each other. same new ID card. same reactor, same shot that mainframe, repair this one etc.    
---
did it solo without glitches. first one failed on launch sequence (out of ammo)  
---
second one destroet SOME turrets. other still active, and run i general pretty easy.   
---
Everlasting-laser minigun  assaultron eye beam is a bitch tho
---
Not sure. Maybe display a message, saying that you can't do that until you take away x amount of weight.
---
Didn't have all the details hashed out, just a brainstorm lol
---
You're my hero man, same thoughts exactly, wanted to make sure I wasnt the only one lol
---
Don't forget to blame the people who complained about their "gold cards" (any cards we have gotten animations for, that's it...) Being worth a lot of points because they didn't want to feel pressured to give up their animation cards (as if they spend the entire game looking at card animations)
---
You could have gotten a lot of points for any gold (animation) perk cards you have but don't want (perks you never use) for leveling up legendary cards but after the irrational complaining by people who didn't want their gold cards to be worth more points...
---
 bethesda made all cards worth the same amount.
---
This sounds like a debate between the chicken and the egg.
---
Is is the engine or the QA?
---
If you’re just wanting something for trash kills a silenced bloodied 10mm pistol is what I use and you don’t have to re-spec anything for it to get the job done.
---
I don’t mind if it goes live as long as the base damage on unarmed gets increase.
---
Try lighting away from the house. Light passes through walls in this game. The track lights are like mini suns, but they do have falloff, so if you place them right they provide a nice global illumination from a distance. I saw a video where someone hid all their lights under their base, so no light source was visible. Good base lighting is tricky, but worth it.  Good luck!
---
Start with 1 for 1-49.
---
More wanting something for more than one enemy at once. Currently got a B/33 Lever Action as my main
---
I dont believe that it's the patch's fault, if you're upset with the amount of damage your doing or how many times your dying, then you need to tweak your build. At high levels the enemies will absolutely body slam you into the dirt if your build isnt syncing up well.
---
I have a few characters i like to play.  Heavy weapon PA, medic commando, bloodied, and a 1h melee no power armor.
---
i find bloodied to be one of the least fun
---
&gt; No decently designed online game would have ever let these exist in the first place, let alone allow them to remain.
---
A great many games, even big budget AAA games from huge studious, 1) rarely roll back gains from exploits after they are found/fixed and 2) rarely punish people who utilize the exploits.
---
Hell in Blizzard games players even have a phrase they whip out all the time when this happens, 'cheat early, cheat often'... Because Blizzard almost never punishes people for abusing exploits.
---
There's a recipe
---
So you really think Bethesda would fix this broken system once it is out? Bwwahhahhahah... :)
---
If you've ever seen someone pointing a handmade with a weird lump on the end of the barrel, look closer.  I've seen two players with handmade that had the laser rifle beam splitter on the end or the barrel.  Turns their explosive handmade into an automatic explosive shotgun of doom.
---
Pretty silly to me since there are legitimate magic weapons which cause the damage overflow bug, like a +50% limb damage LMG for example.
---
I have one of those for sale in my vendors, name is Chazofthewasteland in the game on PC.
---
I haven't seen it on pc cheaper than 20-30k. now I'm tempted to sell mine xD but I like it too much.
---
Good thing I thanked you in advance. This is good stuff. Gimmie one more reply, try not being a dick this time, and just send me a link.
---
Bro I remember trying to get the legendary sloth in the fachnat event and having some dude in power armor take him out with his Gatling plasma.
---
Do your on research you lazy ass clown
---
I keep a good heavy gun on mine for queen and colossus fights. Which I keep it stashed so I’m not sacrificing carry weight all the time. I also keep a good melee weapon as well. Occasionally something just needs/deserves a good thump with a supersledge. Full bloodied, my bss supersledge is doing about 900 damage. It also saves me from carrying around extra ammo for a gun that I wouldn’t normally use. I do the same thing for my shotgun build (heavy gun and melee). It also helps to break up the monotony of just double tapping everything, and keeps me fair and balanced in some events (uranium fever in particular) where I can run through and one shot all the enemies from a perch. Instead I’m forced to run to enemy which gives others a chance to get their kills in. I’ll still one hit whatever I swing at regardless.
---
Damage is not my issue at the moment. I can kill quite well. I prefer keeping all 15 points in INT, along with the 15 from Unyielding, along with 5 from Berry Mentats, along with 5 from Brain Fungus Soup, along with  from 2 to 4 from the Building Group buff. I have a main on my second account which shares Strange in Numbers. They always play together, with one always being parked in the background.
---
25,000 not 250,000.
---
Creature crusher: equipping exterminator,  hunters, or trouble shooters weapons boosts damage against that type 25pct. (Boosting total pct to 55)
---
Humanoid slayer: mutant slayers,  ghoul slayer,  and zealots weapons boosts damage against those types by 25 pct. (Boosting total pct  to 55)
---
These are nice versatile cards that boost existing weapons. Each card works for 3 legendary effects so it's a good value imo.
---
Night Crawler: 
---
Rank 1-nocturnal weapons do not lose damage in the day. +3 to luck, agility, and strength at night.
---
Rank 2-night vision. Works inside and outside 24 hours per day.
---
Rank 3-harder to detect while sneaking and nocturnal weapons gain the vampire effect.
---
Blue Collar: 
---
Rank 1-shovels, picks, pipe wrenches, chainsaws, and drills deal 15pct more damage, weigh 50 pct less, and have 50 pct more durability. 
---
Rank 2-excavator power armor gains an additional +100 carry weight and allows you to walk/run at normal speeds even when over encumbered. 
---
Rank 3-scrapped junk materials placed in your stash weigh 50 pct less. +3 to strength and endurance from 6a-6pm.
---
Some people want to be legit vendors, so why not give them the ability to do so. Not everyone wants to just convert all their ammo. Some wanna sell it, or collect it to be good samaritans and give it to newbies. Someone could put travelling pharmacy on their stash and literally just have hundreds of stimpaks to sell dirt cheap to help others out, and still have room for some weapons and armor in there. Obviously most people without 1st would probably use Pack Rat, but even that wouldn't really compare to infinite.
---
I'm not saying what I suggested is perfect, but I feel they could figure something out other than just "more space"
---
it’s not really, but then again this is the same cycle every game goes through when a nerf is coming.
---
Let’s put it this way though. My bloodied build can one shot every super mutant, ghoul, robot, or scorch, just short of the legendary bosses. I’m not using a bloodied gun, i’m using a Mutants handmade. 
---
I’m doing it because of how bonuses currently stack, and thanks to the completely OP unyielding gear (which is even more OP than in FO4, since I get 3 legendary effects per piece of gear)
---
Enemies can’t see me, i earn tons of XP, I get a huge boost to my Carry Weight, i can pass every speech check, i get awesome prices, and i get great rewards when allies complete quests.
---
Unyielding, a key part of bloodied, is still overpowered. It won’t matter if it takes two shots or three now, i’m still perfectly safe.
---
Bolstering, Vanguards, Mutants, Nocturnal, etc - how can you possibly buff other armor effects to match unyielding. 
---
Also, with my current build i never use magazines, bobble heads, chems or booze, i only use food buffs for extra XP and Carry Weight.  Maybe this change will encourage us to use more consumables, giving the economy a shot as people actually hunt and sell them
---
No you don't, it just looks like that because when you spam the key to open loads the splash screen shows the total of many added together, that's not the amount from a single gift  :-)
---
On the topic of that, I saw a chart someone made that despite Bloodied builds being hit very hard, it is still the strongest build
---
Sa. Sdsdd
---
Well despite your experience, it's definitely not nonsense as to why most people had issues - so this is related to something else entirely. 
---
I'd just say check your math again and don't open your map first thing into the world because it will show wrong initially when first logging in.
---
From there, maybe start recording your logins if that's when you're having the issue and send it over to support to figure out what's happening on your account.
---
I'm on right now
---
They could but it is very telling its always on.
---
Came here to say this very thing. 
---
I'm pleased to have been beaten, for once!
---
Me 2, i have constant crashes all the time, still dont know the reason 😑
---
I daeded.
---
Were not supposed to just grind them all out immediately. 
---
Is one of those long term rewards for sticking with the game.  
---
Grab the one or two that's most meaningful to your favorite builds, and dont destroy your collection in the process.
---
I dont believe that.  If they just wanted multiplayer fallout 4 mode as a dlc or rerelease that would have been easier then making 76.  
---
I'd imagine its more their publisher wanted them to make a game as a service and sell atoms and cosmetics.  It's what all the big games were doing, and they wanted another peice of that pie.  Same reason fallout 4 and skyrim se have paid mods that dont mess with achievements.
---
The only limitations here are the creativity of the devs and the money Beth is willing to throw at the game. ;)
---
I am not sure if this applies past a certain level but I heard you get a tiny bit of extra budget per level.
---
by actually knowing how to play the game and not suck balls at it in the process
---
You'll be able to buy some items you missed for gold bullion in the future.
---
I never had that many. my friend once gave like 100 presents when I started playing, I got over 7k out of them. Not long ago I found a present and it gave me 500 caps. Besides you can't just spam opening them, at least on pc the mouse always moves to upper item. So no, you can get more than just 50 caps.
---
except they arent. what has actual happens with this change is that bloodied is still 90% functionally the same, its everything ELSE that actually get hurt in a more meaningful way.
---
sure the big change with bloodied *looks* dramatic, but its all the gear and builds that were on the margin of viability that have been nerfed just a little bit, and are now even *less* appealing. there is less reason to have anything but bloodied now, all those people that were happy just getting by are the one that will have to rethink their builds. bloodied players will just shrug at not being able to stack insane buffs to one tap bosses lol, that in.
---
This was the only time I have never seen  her land and I have probably done hundreds of SBQ fights at Lvl 384.  Usually she does land and get Cryolated.  I had one solo of the SBQ without Scorched Earth and this reminded me of that, no ads just emptying Ultracite Plasma Cores into her.
---
Hear hear!
---
I did as well. Not what I want from Fallout :/
---
Yo Nekro, you have all the fun after I go to sleep. 😂😂😂👍 I wish this dude was on PC so we could farm his salty, salty tears.
---
&gt;Or what about the 90% of legendary modifiers being basically trash filler.
---
Nocturnal Rolling Pin has entered the chat
---
I think a lot of players on the Test Server are just there for sneak peek at what’s coming out. And don’t bother reporting anything.
---
What I really don’t understand this autocompleted bug is around for ages long before the legendary run the old way could also autocomplete. I still think they don’t give it priority just keeping making new content and we just getting more and more unsolved bugs
---
Seems you already found out.
---
There are tiny little openings throughout the road all the way up and down. It's one of those rare few locations too large for one C.A.M.P. to solely occupy.
---
You favourite them, then just hit the number/symbol for that slot, I play on PC :-)
---
I'm not disagreeing with the possibilities that some people use it for fun or unique reasons, most would use it for junk and be able to store enough junk that 1st wouldn't be necessary because sure I might have thousands of some mats in my stashbox but if I knew there was a storage cap I'd be able to trim it down easy to the stuff I need and use most and never pass that capacity. It just becomes a major competition against the most useful quality of life perks to the paid subscription - especially since 1st cosmetics and other perks are a lot less common or coming a lot slower than they initially advertised.
---
You absolutely can get 1000 caps from just one.
---
"Are you perhaps hacking?"
---
Gotta love these ignorant foodies.
---
FYI, never do this in power armor.
---
They can destroy your power armor pieces by shooting at your dead corpse
---
Thanks. Yes stealth is forcibly disabled in daily ops thanks to the always on piercing gaze mod. Sucks.
---
I always just shoot it because I thought it's just another radstag. Is there actually something about it? What loot are you talking about? Yet another trick I didn't know
---
Fuckin hell, thanks man. I'm just worried I'm gonna shit myself at the sight of Lv.200 players who DONT show mercy to newbies.
---
Completely agree. My level 200 character is around 400 hours in and I still am happy playing on it, I would like to make a new one down the line to experience the story again some day but I don't really intend on using a Mule, if you have loot that you want to store away on another character do you really need it? Theres a couple items I have that I do not want to sell or get rid of such as a couple Legendary Dragons I have just because they are a Legacy item, but that is on me and they will remain on my wall in my Camp.
---
DUMP IT.
---
Goblin vomit and schlop.
---
Seemed like it was needed on the normal server. Last night I took a furious mini tot the SBQ, and the damage numbers didn't go up. Shot at a diseased mirelurk queen, same thing. Dunno, maybe my gun is just broken...
---
Can it be used to farm ammo? For example if I 1 or 2 shot an enemy with a lever action do they drop more than 1 or 2  .45?
---
Is this just on pc or are console affect by this as well?
---
You're funny if you think 6 turrets will "mow down" even a halfway decently geared player.
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
It's a strength of the game that players who choose a certain style can function in the setting. Don't worry about how others play.
---
You go your way, I'll go mine.
---
More tiresome cliches available for reasonable prices at the Atomic Shop.
---
Well, next time I get a bunch of them I'll remember that xD Thanks.
---
I'm at 85 at the moment, only doing the occasional nuclear winter. How did you get your exp challenge so fast, I wanna try it out? (i haven't really grinded out the exp buff I just did dailies)
---
I only currently use building teams and meat stew so ill deffo implement so other  buffs into my day to day play
---
This became my issue with the game. I finally threw in the towel around 70’ish in the LR. I just couldn’t keep forcing myself to log and complete the dailies because it was ruining my experience. Since I’ve decided to take a break, I’ve played twice in the last two weeks.  It’s been refreshing and I don’t see myself even getting back to the game for another month at least.
---
do you know why they lost value?
---
I'm here to complain about your complaint! Don't downvote me! /s
---
Two shot explosive
---
I'll collect 25 ore to get to level 1 and then hang with the rest of the puds killing the mobs as they spawn. It's not optimal, but we don't fail. I don't see this mentality changing while the Legendary Run is putting everyone into an XP frenzy.
---
Thanks man you've been very helpful.
---
On ps4. I've been seriously considering doing the same.  Does PC lag like console.  It's been so bad lately in fissure site prime area that I'm not even enjoying it for all the frustrating deaths.  Also when im in power armor in nuke zones looting I'll exit my power armor because they are the same button even when I'm extra careful.  Apparently that is unchangeable.
---
If you have all possible ranks of a perk and get a key one from the pack you get no new card, so it's better to wait
---
Because everyone duped gifts and they added the plan to the game after Christmas
---
Pretty sure they can be received from christmas gifts, which were duped massively and still are today.
---
I know. “Teach a man to fish...”
---
Observant radstags, if you follow them, take you to hidden loot catches, usually in tree stumps. You get a few decent weapons out of them and a good bit of ammo.
---
Then we need better rewards and not just shovels.
---
totally random. i've been doing that event once a day since it came out just cuz its easy, even when doing it solo, and i finally got the backpack a few days ago.
---
got plenty of the gas masks tho...
---
I dont have a complaint "bag is stuck in box" "same grindy dailies for rep" sure dude. You probably have more complaints but don't want to bring them up because you want to love the game.
---
Bs , he power leveled with the grenades at the prison for his first couple hundred, goob is a cheat.
---
:o omg! all this time.. poor delicious radstags.. Thanks for explaining!
---
So you rocking that Nocturnal build huh?
---
Legendary Perks are still shit (especially how you get them)
---
The new Damage Model is also concerning (I mean releasing that Model to live servers without any other adjustments will be a disaster)
---
And One Wasteland is somewhat of a disaster too and somewhat of a disappointment
---
Say you have first aid 1, 2 and 3 already, if you get another first aid card in a perk pack you get no new card because you already have all of the possible combinations
---
You just made the grind worse. with the current system you’ll have 2 max perks at level 300
---
The recoil is insane.
---
Link the vid and I’ll believe you . But if you can’t back up your claim then he is still verified as a non cheater with ALL GAMEPLAY STREAMED
---
oh I'm talking about killing swan ._.
---
It's the only set with decent fences.
---
How about a handmade or fixer? They might fit your build better.
---
Also because of the lack of anything else to do at a certain point.
---
I was pretty disappointed when I dropped my second nuke. I chose a different style expecting something different. I maybe have done 3 or 4 and I’ve been playing since the game launched. Silo runs just are not fun and enough people do them that I don’t need to waste my time.
---
This is really simple and clever.
---
Minor inconveniences maybe.
---
I mean, raid bosses are literally grind content tho lol
---
It would be cool if they replaced the horde event quests with something a bit more raid bossy tho, like buffing the leader to be similar to the alpha in project paradise 
---
Or I dunno, make super mutant behemoth hordes a thing, maybe directing hordes to pathfind to different players' camps so that there is some personal urgency to them
---
Yep, which is why it's in the atomic store lol
---
Things like this shouldn't even make it to the PTS. We're not their QA-department. (I know we are in reality)
---
But they need to be opened at some point, and what you said will still hold true when you do, you just delayed it...
---
thanks a lot for this. worked perfectly. &lt;3 
---
i now have a level 50 glowing mirelurk king who‘s ready to wreck anything coming near my camp.
---
basically just ask for one and you will get one eventually. they are beyond worthless.
---
Ah, you mean for scrapping... I get you.
---
Of course I rock bloodied. Cause they OP
---
I’ve been done with the run for like a week now and I’ve never had that happen to me.
---
I’ve never run into that issue personally. I swing by my camp once an hour to collect my water and do a quick repair of anything that’s below 100%.
---
No, when perk coins are released you can cash in your rank 1 card meaning now you have a space to get a new one. So you cash in your current cards then open the packs
---
Well, they can make a ladder that transports someone from one part of the worldspaxe to a part slightly higher. There is at least one spot they do that in Fallout 4 (though I think it may have been added with CC content).
---
How do we not have a toaster skin for the cooking bench yet?
---
The true issue is that the game uses predominantly "attach" code snippets so tracing all the potential scripts that might be at work at a given moment is more complicated. 
---
Anecdotal experiences of "it happened to me" don't actually do anything to help narrow that down and actually fix the issue. 
---
I know people assume that the dev team should just be able to "fix it" but you're talking about hundreds of thousands of players with hundreds of potential script attaches hitting at loading and countless other userside and serverside variables, it's just not that. 
---
My experience only goes as far as modding the engine since oblivion and fo3 and all through fnv, Skyrim and fo4 and the code does crazy fucking shit. So outside of a complete reworking of the backend framework, it's going to be patched piece by piece and the best way you can assist in that process is having the most thorough details possible about whatever issue you had and the more documentation the better especially when it's related to fixing a lingering issue that supposedly has already been fixed because there's a lot of trolls that just post absolute bullshit on here for no reason other than to get some like spreading disinformation or thinking somehow they are damaging Bethesda or 76 by whining about imaginary problems. (Which makes no sense because there's still loads of actual real issues you could bother to point to that would be far more relevant in the first place)
---
Bruh just place the retro looking clock sideways and it looks like one.
---
Well, that I can say it not true lol 
---
Build camps
---
Start a new character (its weirdly refreshing) 
---
Play some more of NW, start getting better at it
---
*Play other games*
---
And so on
---
Yep, see about 10 posts a  week on the market sub, I felt super lucky because I hadn't suffered it until this week. It is suggested to submit a ticket the beth, what they are going to do about it though I don't know.
---
As me and my wife are grinding daily to catch up on the legendary run we started 2 weeks late with, i feel this. Inventory simulator 2020 is fun.. :D
---
Cool. Thanks man.
---
&gt;They did the same thing with ESO and it's terrible. You get weaker the more you level up. Level 1 characters wreck everything on the map whereas when you get high level you're just constantly struggling and trying to fight against **the hidden multiplier working against you**.
---
I think that only pops up if your gear is lower level than your character.  Aside from that, I didn't like One Tamriel for the opposite reason.  Things eventually get too easy.  As in, I can take my hands off the keyboard and not only will normal enemies be unable to kill me, they'll actually kill themselves in the attempt.  You can remove all of your armor and accessories and still take on several groups of enemies with your health bar barely moving.  
---
A, "one size fits all" approach always ends up sloppy.
---
Sadly
---
Even before the duping of the gifts the price for them plummeted from them being able to drop from the gifts.  I only ever opened non duped presents that I either looted or crafted during the event and I still have 4 spare plans.  Could have maybe gotten 1 or 2k each for them before the duping started but now they are nearly worthless lol.  Before the holiday event they were going for 30k plus.
---
Are you sure about that? They're probably more glitch and bug complaints that should be brought up and not kept secret.
---
I use an auto instigating explosive fixer for my backup. Let’s me keep only .45 ammo (main is a lever). All I need to do is swap perks for commando and I can do close combat. Fixer is def the way to go.
---
I dont actually know which is your camp but both of the hiuses look really good.
---
Rename Fallout76 to Grindout76.
---
Why? Because I’m using logic and fair reasoning. Now all I can hope is that this ban does happen and you best weapon does get deleted
---
It's a decent community. Dropping stuff for new players is the norm. It happened to me when I started playing in July, and I've since done it for other players when I see them. I've been carrying extra stims just for that occasion because I never had enough when I was leveling.
---
Yes, lost about 26,000 potential score points thanks to that bug. Thankfully I completed the run the other day, but I'm still pissed about that.
---
This is not really a matter of you believing something or not. Todd Howard explicitly stated that 76 started as a multiplayer component for FO4. Like directly into a camera and microphone to be preserved on the internet for all of history. It's in the Noclip doc if you'd like to look for yourself.
---
Nope. The xmas presents, which said plans drop from, got duped a lot.
---
My 1st time, ever, I entered the number wrong at the end like a fool. 2nd one, half way through my wife needs help carrying her home after effing up her ankle. Haven't done it since. :/
---
“Bethesda, I want you to pander exactly to what I want
---
“Specifically, I’m unhappy with the world and universe that has existed for decades and I want it to change because I’m not happy with a skirt”
---
Damn bro it’s just a skirt
---
No, read again. *H* *E* doesn’t seem the type to have clean weapons. Not you, him. And joke’s on you, my best weapon is a level 5 furious hunting rifle right now.
---
If camp building wasn’t a shitshow, perhaps, but I don’t touch the dam thing anymore because it’s so frustrating that you can’t re-create what you had. And I don’t like the game enough to start over. And I hate NW. 
---
So I guess you’re right to a point: there’s always something else to do, but we all pick what that thing is. I don’t grief people, but at least I can see how it’s appeal might increase as true content decreases.
---
&gt; Honestly it’s becoming an adventure game at this point. 
---
You mean like the first few Fallout games were? And they had an optional survival mode.
---
From what I've read and seen it seems like the explosive splash damage isn't doubling the crippling chance anymore
---
Is that like "Teach a kid not to be a dick...."
---
You'll get more money out of just opening them.
---
Y'all should work at Bethesda.
---
It’s a pre-existing house down the road from Charleston Fire Dept.
---
Yet they'll still continue to exist.
---
U ran out of arguments already and now need to make shit up?
---
GTFO already ;)
---
A million times hotter than TNT
---
So there is no perk coin pool shared among all characters... that's stupid making you lvl up every single character too much to get those coins.
---
I can kinda understand why, the jetpack is unique to secret service tech  so designing some variations that also fit the setting is probably difficult 
---
Plus if they start making stuff like "raider jetpack skin" "brotherhood jetpack skin etc" would they have to make jetpacks available for other armor pieces
---
Atm you can only attach them to secret service armor, so any cosmetic mods that don't match would seem out of place
---
So do they make jetpacks available for every chest piece? Then the bullion grind for SS armor is wasted. Do they make a new bullion grind for jetpacks for different chest pieces? Well then the players feel like they have to grind for something they already have 
---
I hope they make jetpack cosmetics, but I get how it's probably something that they're trying to figure out the best way to do
---
O well I made reports, trying to tell what I did and didn’t do. I know how it works, still I stay firm to my point they can do more about some bugs or do a lot more good communication about there issues. 
---
Typing a report and give details and just get an auto answer we know about the issue gives the person the feeling o well we don’t need to make a new rapport they know about it 😂
---
I've had 100% fall damage negation on my armor for probably ~100 levels now. And I keep back-ups in my stash in case i want to swap around armor effects.
---
Beside the benefit of not having to worry about this kind of trap camp, it's incredibly liberating to know you absolutely won't die from falling.
---
oh, in that case I am sorry and nothing was personal. But yeah the guy above seemed like a douche
---
I was born blind, but you have allowed me to see.
---
Sounds like that happens to one of the other commenters as well– luckily I haven't gone through Dauguerre's questline.
---
God what's up with the downvotes? It's almost like people want to explore the map and discover the lore and terminals without having to play an entire mode for hours on end. Selfish fuckers on this subreddit
---
We are a good community for the most part. I drop gear and aid for lowbies all the time. I still raid like a motherfucker, but I do enjoy helping people.
---
You’re more than welcome to try to get them.
---
What platform you on, buddy?
---
Not cool. This is rude and stupid.
---
The Greenhouse panels are gonna be my favorite thing!
---
Of all the posts to make this comment why did you choose this innocent as fuck request lmao
---
Free the pants
---
Well, fair point on that I just started over to cheese the level up lol 
---
I don't see it increasing tbh I see helping other players and giving them items to help them where they're struggling as a great appeal to me, use your resources to help rather than hinder, ya know?
---
Go into settings and turn on pacifist if you haven’t already. This will prevent you from doing damage to other players and accidentally engage in pvp. 
---
Visit nukesanddragons.com to play around with special points and perk cards to get a rough idea which build you want to go for. 
---
Plant corn, mutfruit, tato’s and water purifiers to craft vegetable starch, which scraps to adhesive (needed for lots of crafting and repairing). Also make corn soup as it satisfies both hunger and thirst. 
---
What platform you play on?
---
I think you owe me a full set of ass/sent heavy combat armor, the Serum recipes for Adrenal Reaction, Grounded, Empath, Marsupial, Scaly Skin, and Healing factor, as well as a BE laser rifle for that little misunderstanding sir!
---
This is what I was saying in my previous rants actually, yeah. They just don't seem to care about dozens of posts like that.
---
Give it a few months and more new armors will have jetpacks and then eventually they'll release jetpacks for the original set of armors (using whatever new currency they introduce). That's my guess.
---
oh no did I hurt someone’s feelings 🥺
---
Down votes really prove your point. You are right. I've put 2100 hours into this game and earned my rares just to watch them get passed out like Halloween candy later. Loyalty gets you nothing in the grind.
---
So the post I saw about their respective perk cards no longer affecting them was bs? Nice
---
I'm on XB1
---
I would love to make a pistol vats build with some medic/support aspects, do you think it will be viable on the PTS as my unarmed build really can't do much damage solo anymore I am kind of worried
---
Jesus christ that's bad. The quality of the power armour skins in general has been absolutely shit in first person. Half the damn heavy weapon mags dont work and block up the entire screen. The only one I've bought that is decent is the prime skin.
---
That's it! I'm getting me mallet!
---
True. If I changed my armor at all I’d have to waste 6 perk points so I’m in the same boat. I really wish the grocer/chemist backpack mods would stack on the same bag or something. This is just my fix :p
---
I'm stealth instigating so no, you're not alone. Considering I often get myself into situations regardless of being invisible, there is no way I could play bloodied. I know myself too well.
---
That’s helpful, thx 🙃
---
Oh okay, I just read it’s a daily ops reward. Thank you anyway!
---
I haven't played WoW in about 5 years, but I used to raid 3 nights a week. Bethesda could learn a lot about tuning boss fights and catering to players with different skill levels from Blizzard.
---
But there is one problem: its elder scrolls and i want lasers pew pew, i like fallout world in general
---
Reporting to support won't do much since it seems like they don't even have a direct support team it's all through zeni.
---
But gathering all the evidence and facts and ideally video and posting it for the people here or on the Bethesda forums, that will actually get community reaction which will prioritize the fix. 
---
People don't listen or believe without proof especially about bugs.
---
I used to think like you, enjoying myself with vanguard set and some instigating heavy guns... but once I tried bloodied plasma caster/ bloodied gauss minigun combo plus all the applicable mutations, I don't have to grind for ammo as much and it feels so good. Now I feel like a dumbass for selling all those unyelding and bolstering armor pieces I had crafted and sold for scrip.
---
Nobody is saying that you have to play one of this builds :V Recent rebalancing(which is on test servers now) combined with one appalachia may force you to play them tho :v
---
I don't even know how legendary perks work lol
---
a "challenge" consisting of an ammo grind simulator spiced up by walking backwards sinking countless rounds into basic late-game enemys at that, who wouldn't love this instead of actually cool challenges as earl seems to have been or actually will be for the time when he is live until the next patch hits.
---
This. If they had told us we'd be retroactively punished for moving S.P.E.C.I.A.L points around, I would not have been nearly so reckless with them. I've gone back and forth between Bloodied and full-health builds as I got bored/wanted to try new guns that I've probably lost 100 levels worth of points. And for everyone now saying that we should have leveled alts instead, I'd say that if I have to talk to Ward one more time I'm going to fucking lose it. Wastelanders/faction/bullion made playing alts a pointless endeavor.
---
I hope they don't add a currency on top of scrip and bullion haha
---
Unless there's like a timeskip expansion and we get ncr dollars, I would be alright with that
---
I don't want to play bloodied, but I'm not sure I can stay away from those incredible stat boosts it provides.
---
That XP boost from the bonus int is really hard to turn down during the legendary run.
---
It’s a video game... in no way is it comparable to health insurance
---
I carry simething for tagging, an ultracite / boss gun and a workhorse / daily driver.
---
For my commando that is currently a q for tesla, bloodied prime  handmade and b ffr radium.
---
It always has lol
---
Body removal service?? There is a niche market for sure. Please get that mole rat out of my house.
---
I did the exact same thing once! Bonus points too because my body was covering my bag lmao!!!
---
Even now, if you’re putting more than a few bullets into anything other than crown bosses or legendary, something is very wrong with your build and play style as a whole.
---
My Non-bloodied, High Cha, support shotgun build (no magic weapons) kills things in 2-3 shots, that seems fine for a crap build
---
Mobs taking two shots to kill are not bullet sponges
---
Same here, I think I made the switch around 700hrs in and would never go back now, 2200hrs later
---
That’s the beauty of it - it’s playable in a variety of ways. Personally I enjoy spending a lot of time min-maxing my build, knowing that I’ll be able to get a certain damage output and play a certain way. And in this game, getting to that point took a LONG time with the stupidly low RNG rates, which is why this nerf in the PTS is such a slap in the face.
---
Because that’s the initial way they have it set up... for testing
---
Well if they were doing a comprehensive re-balance it would be a different story, they are just nerfing all player damage while also increasing most enemy health for now, we need to wait and see if they do more adjustments though, I really hope they do.
---
Do you get hungry/thirsty playing these?
---
The best backup weapon for a rifle man is another rifle. Since you won't have to switch perks.
---
I use the cycling light and set them to dim accent colors. It makes for a CAMP space that is vivid and colorful without being super bright.
---
So, do you gave duped gear, just not hacked?
---
Can't confirm myself but did see someone saying that ammosmith does stack, would be surprised myself if it doesn't
---
Support them with real money so they can get more fundings and more people to work on the game
---
Requiring players to scrap perk cards is such an idiotic idea, especially when legendary perk cards are advertised to “encourage player to try different builds”, the system literally locks you in your build
---
Can you wear any armor with the stealth suit?
---
Some free professional advice; when removing such dead pests always turn off bloody mess as certain parts of their exploded corpses become unmovable.
---
Exactly, I want more shit like earl.  Tougher sheepsquatches that actually spawn. In the end game there's no fear of running into a tough enemy and I miss that aspect of the game
---
I have an instigating lever as main rifle with an explosive executioner handmade as back up. 
---
Had served me well for the past 30ish levels.
---
This. Putting you machines well out of reach of spawn points (pref on an upper floor) will save you.
---
Tbh I've been grinding the SCORE challenges on both my account and my boyfriend's account. 😵
---
Try a diferent approach than the most broken op build in game and maybe u get well results.
---
 For inv berry montara, for robots shock bombs and mines. God is it so hard? Stop fucking crying. The only time they add a challenge people cries because they are cheating. That is the point assholes
---
Well the other side, Bethesda, would need to care about this too first. If people mass-report bugs and issues on the PTS but Bethesda simply releases the build to live anyway or simply doesn't let the testers test the biggest features on the PTS only to introduce major bugs on the live servers with their release....Why should most people even bugger with that? Of course people are going to just get a peek at what's to come if they see the 'other company's dev'/modder giving explicit detail to bugs and how to fix them and gets ignored anyway.
---
So, it sounds like they need to add an option to the level up.
---
Get a perk card, or move a SPECIAL point, or get perk coins directly.
---
Additionally, open a perk pack should have 2 choices also.
---
Open a perk pack, or get perk coins and gum.
---
That reduces forward facing clicks.
---
The organization of the perk cards as a whole sorta sucks though.  So I cannot see a clean way to deconstruct from the library.
---
I'm still really salty that they want us to destroy something that was about collecting like a set anyway.  It feels.... really wrong and backwards.
---
No kidding!! I hate the idea of scrapping them. Let us hide them, exchange them, or give us a point to switch a special point.
---
oh shit did I hurt your precious little feelings 🥺
---
Yea the current situation is so far from bullet sponges that they would have to  dial things down a shitload to match games with actual bullet sponges like destiny 
---
Plenty of weapons you don't even have to build for to make enemies a non-issue 
---
People are always saying the only threats in the game are assaultrons and Mr. Gutsy's 
---
There are so many more interesting enemies that I would rather have interesting fights with
---
If there is so little for them to do don't know why they don't just pick up another game. Wait a bit until the next content drops.
---
Was going to say this!
---
I want everything to level with me. This game is too easy and gets boring quick the way it stands now. Killing legendaries in a single shot is stupid. So both sides have an argument.
---
I think some people don’t understand there is a grey area between “oh well, that sucks, moving on...” and “this is the worst thing ever! Game is broken and horrible! I am quitting!”
---
jep exactly and well I just played the PTS and with my unarmed damage going down to just under 400 for a full bloodied build with buff aids, party boy and carnivore from 1-2k is a lot, when I was trying to take down robots in the bog I couldn't scratch them but other than the assaultrons they couldn't really do much either so I was literally just standing there essentially hitting a brick wall. Not fun. At all. And sneak seems to be kind of broken? I have rifle as a secondary with the damage perks at rank 2 each and the stealth dmg multiplier perk but the stealth multiplier didn't seem to do anything at all or at least very very little
---
Most things shouldn’t be one hit honestly.  A 1* Bloodied Combat Rifle could be made to one hit level 68s if you have the right build right now lol.  That being said with how laggy and unstable this game is,  your better bloodied melees should 1H level 68s without non perk buffs IMO.  I’m anxious to see the changes though,  I imagine if those crazy damage numbers are hurt too bad with bloodied we will be seeing a large amount of people swapping to junkies or vampires just for the quality of life.
---
Those who dont need to grind levels to get the coins. One of his main arguments is even after 412 unspent levels he is only halfway to maxing the cards he can have equipped
---
I like this idea a lot!
---
I pay for fallout 1st and spend an average of $80 a month on ATX...
---
Id like to see card scrapping remain, but reward one point.
---
Give everyone a point per level after 100.
---
Basically, split the difference a bit. Let us junk cards but punish people less who are trying to respec.
---
Bird bones makes it way to easy to break my limbs when my explosive guns go off at point blank. But thanks for the suggestions.
---
Console, and it's very infrequent as to when it wants to crash. Sometimes I can leave it idling for hours on the main menu/in a CAMP while I do other things, or I can do what I did here and actually play for hours on end before it decides it's had enough of me repeatedly in the span of an hour and I just lie down for the night.
---
So...idk. This console is also old, but it too runs everything fairly fine until it comes to FO76 as well. Not sure why this game feels the need to be crap like this, even when it's not fully digital.
---
I have problems reading the disk at all as well. If it crashes, it's kind of over until the console says I'm allowed to play because it's decided to read the disk again, more or less.
---
See people not sharing legendaries again :P Honestly its so rare these days to get a hit in from kill stealers and most of the new players don't know about how the community do things. So I don't do event no more for legendaries. Plus when the rebalance comes out, this issue will get worse. I recommend instead of praying for a update that properly isn't going to be soon and join teams doing the event.
---
Why would they not test it with stealth and all builds?
---
These changes are WORSE for the other 99.9%.  OP has the levels to actually invest and use these legendary perk cards.  For many of the more casual players, they are 6 months to a year away.  If you want to dangle a carrot in our face to make us run forward, it has to be close enough that we can actually see it.  
---
Also doesn't change the fact that it actively punishes players for playing alts and trying different builds out.
---
Explosives drop on everything but energy weapons (Tesla’s, Gatling plasmas/lasers, flamers, cryolaters, &amp; laser rifles) so having an energy weapon with explosive rounds makes it a legacy because they don’t drop in the game anymore
---
Then they have no right to complain IMO
---
Actually your best friend as a rifleman is a plasma rifle with the flamer attachment. The plasma flamer has an amazing dps stat that will get you out of most sticky situations. Was a junkie rifleman before going commando and I loved that thing. 
---
You will need to start sucking dick for copper though.
---
For most things probably not. Things like my baseball bat or pole hook still hit around 500+. In terms of my knives, though, it’s about equal now. Certain items seem to be affected differently. Like the Flamer took a roughly 70%  hit whereas ballistic weapons do around 30-50% less
---
So what? Wanting to have everything maxed sound like a YOU problem. 
---
I am fine by having to be selective as to what to get and what not and perhaps not maxing everything.
---
Sweetheart I can MAKE them. I'm not jumping into a fissure site for a measly 200 presents.
---
So now you want a thousand hour grind before you can even grind for ammo?
---
We need more raid type bosses that don’t require nukes also.  Just jump in group and go for it.
---
Colossal problem is always grounded, so it shouldn't be as much to worry about
---
What's your platform?
---
Pretty sure he said the concept for it began as multiplayer for F4. Not that it was a multiplayer component. I know he’s clarified that it made less sense to have coop in F4 and that they thought the online strategy deserved its own game. Either way, plenty of games start out as concepts for others. F1 was just a copy of wastelanders with GURP’s, so I don’t see why people claiming that is a problem makes much sense.
---
people worried about fall damage in this game LUL
---
Someone said that is fixed on the test server.
---
The 99,9% of casuals don’t give 2 shits about min maxing anything
---
Mission impossible over here
---
Couldn’t tel you. Either way... it’s for testing... if you are in the PTS, submit our feedback in the official forum.
---
There’s not many of them, believe it or not. I’m around level 350 and either help out the new players when I see them or just ignore them, which most other high levels do as well.
---
Can be easily done with 4 people (even 3) that know what they’re doing and have half decent weapons
---
Yeah you can kiss my ass.. I have god roll bloodied weapons and Uny Armor  I've grinded 2 years for.. That's great you'll get over it good happy for you.. I play mostly on my private server so not bothering you with my Bloodied legacy's anyway.. any damage changes that cause all damage to lower to this amount is complete shit.
---
borderlands 3 lost items bin :D
---
That's a bit excessive
---
Good for you. I’m sure your mother is very proud of you.
---
I only play without them because I don't have a legendary weapon with junkies/bloodied
---
Competing rank 1 or failing is really nice much of a difference. 
---
R4 for rewards or bust ;)
---
What also irritates me is that you can see underneath your armor while wearing t-65 and holding a .50cal
---
My fist camp was an tent and fire this is much better than mine and my current one
---
Obviously better stuff. Is this so hard to imagine?
---
“Attacked?”
---
Nah, not really. I see a bunch of bloodied players complaining though.
---
Todd Howard himself said it in the noclip documentary. It was Fallout 4 multiplayer originally
---
True, but unless we make A LOT of noise nothing’s going to change. People have to remember to submit stuff on the PTS forum too, though, not just here on Reddit.
---
Cranberry relish - gourd, sugar,  cranberry (+exp boost)
---
Any INT booster - brain fungus soup/boil scorched brains
---
Building team with 4 members
---
Charisma perks +exp in groups (forget the name off the top of my head)
---
Unyielding armor +special
---
+ INTChems - berry mentants
---
I don't use it but there in a perk card that increases food stats too I think. 
---
The more INT the more XP, Happy hunting!!
---
I had it happen yesterday, not fixed despite their claims
---
Idk I think it needs to be a bit more complicated than just you join the event you get the legendaries. Can’t describe how many times I’ve had ppl just run around tagging my kills in rad rumble and not actually getting any kills to help us out. The idea that this guy could also get ahold of any legendaries I killed seems like a slap in the face. Bethesda just needs to start rewarding better based on participation in the event rather than throwing in a bunch of legendary mobs that won’t get us anything good.
---
Amen to that.. not going into that shit show till it gets some type of anti cheat... so never again. lmao
---
Go to the southern edge of the map and start walking east and you'll find a really pretty spot with tons of lakes 
---
I think it's a little bit west of the place where the line in the sand event takes place, but it's much farther south 
---
You shouldn't get bothered by enemies too much there, but there are a few ambush random encounter spawns scattered around the area, but the enemies that spawn from those shouldn't give you much trouble if you have a turret or two, or even an ally and a pet should be able to take care of them no problem
---
In a typical Bethesda fashion, all reactors are build with failure in mind. Lol.
---
Do you know why budget exists?
---
If you are taking hits while sneaking with 30+ agi, you are literally brain dead
---
Because the more like items to track the greater the server strain. 
---
It’s problematic enough when you have a bunch of zero weight notes. Imagine adding in four hundred legendary weapons into a stash because Bear Arms was equipped.
---
Get rekt bloodied noobs. Maybe this game will finally have more variety and better balance when it comes to mob resistance.
---
To people not build infinite lag build to crash servers i imagine
---
It’s pretty much what it costs to get access to all new CAMP items and skins they release in the Atom Store. I’ve skipped a few but only a few.
---
The point is that they have plenty of money coming in from this game. They just need to reinvest it in the game.
---
why should Bethesda have to pander to someone when they have an established game world that runs on standards we don’t have here? if they don’t like wearing a skirt there are plenty of other outfits to wear lmao
---
There has been some weirdness with the D pad "switch weapons" function for a while now, and very frustrating bit is too. Usually I just swap between random weapons, not even ones recently used. Also I used to carry the camera when doing photo tasks, and then select my chosen weapon. Then swap to camera to take photo and back tp weapon. Not any more ... Never swaps back to camera. I think I also saw myself disarm yesterday too ... Not certain because I had been using knuckles to punch robots (one of the few atom challenges I have left to do) and assumed it was knuckles and not bare fists.

She is, I got like 20k presents and I don't even wanna count wrapping paper, care to fight me for them?
---
bloodied does not necessarily entails sneak and sneak does not necessarily entails bloodied.
---
&gt;you could invest in sneak, but that's not exclusive to bloodied builds and the upcoming daily ops are gonna put a dent on sneak.
---
Woo hoo! 4K cryo cells and always ready to go! When she lands, she sticks!
---
Even at the current budget my base loads so slowly I am often spawned in the foundations or walls, that would only get worse with a bigger budget. The budget is for performance reasons.
---
Nope.
---
Don’t care in the slightest.
---
It's a rewarding experience.... I think EA said something like that.
---
Only 5500 gold bullion (with a 5k cap)
---
Im not asking for a bigher budget int this post
---
First character I have is my main guy, played on him for 1800 hours, he knows all the plans from limited events and whatnot. My raid boss killer, he has my best build and gear.
---
Then I have one character that holds all my important weapons I want to keep, Survival Legacy weapons, legacy weapons, Unique weapons with names, or good weapons that are too good to get rid of. (This character started out as a second character for fun, but eventually just became storage for important stuff.)
---
Third character is my merchant character, his camp is a shop like place set up right beside the whitesprings station, he holds everything I want to sell, that goes for stuff I put in a vending machine, and high ticket items that I only sell over on the market for other high ticket items. (He holds all the good stuff I wanna sell so it’s not weighing down my main guy.)
---
Last two characters are scrip mules, first it started out as one character being a scrip mule, Rather than my main guy being over encumbered till tomorrow when the scrip machine resets, I dump any legendary scrip weapons and armor onto this character so I can continue playing. Eventually his stash was full and he had so many legendary stuff in his inventory it wouldn’t let him pick up any more stuff... So I made a second scrip mule. 
---
Unfortunately the same thing will eventually happen to this second mule, so now my current goal is to level up my merchant character and second scrip mule to level 50 so I can slowly start chipping away at the amount of scrip I have saved up. With my main character, my merchant character, and one of my scrip characters all scripping stuff daily, I’ll run out of stuff to scrip eventually and maybe I can delete the lower level scrip mule. (This also means when Mama Mumbles has a sale or something, I’ll have 3000 scrip to spend instead of 1000.)
---
Least that’s my plan and reasoning for having a few characters.
---
I've another question that bother me. 
---
Perk points can only be acquired by leveling up and season pack rewards. According to fandom wikia leveling up after level 1000 requires 10 times more xp then leveling up a level 100-999 character. 159880 XP for level 1000+ vs 15880 XP for level 100-999. 
---
Was any changes in XP requirements after level 1000? Will be any changes? Lots of people lost a lot of perk cards due to opening cardpack with dublicated cards before Bethesda allows to keep dublicated cards Some of them used level up as an option to move a special point to optimize build. Some of them will definitely need to grind over level 1000 to maximize at least 6 cards.

I literally two shot every mob that isn’t big boy season and I run a very easygoing junky build.
---
*if they wanted me to feel fed up of the loop by the end of it then they executed it perfectly*
---
They want two things:
---
1) For you to be regularly logging into the game so that you remain exposed to their marketing and so that you keep their player count statistics up, and, 
---
2) For you to buy atoms from them.
---
The system is designed to give you something to work towards so that you keep playing and satisfy the first item. It is also designed to be tantalising enough that you want to finish, but difficult enough that you will likely fail without spending money. For sure, lots of people don't spend a penny, but remember this whole ecosystem was designed by a company that has all of its player login and play time data. They would know how to structure the system to make it likely that people would pay out.
---
This makes it sardonic that people defend it so strongly. People now earn less free atoms and are in turn more likely to pay out real money for supposedly free rewards. The alternative is, as you've described it, to turn the game into a daily chore.
---
He never said anything about the rep dailies though, he just said that the legendary run is better than the dailies in WoW in his opinion
---
My wrapping paper is in 5 digit numbers, ngl. 😨
---
My bad. It was late when I responded to this lol.
---
Yeah, my intelligence is at 25, my charisma is at 20, I use meat stew before any battle. I use inspirational for more exp.
---
Things I'm gonna do is sleep in a bed before I do stuff which gives me the lovers embrace buff for 2 hours.
---
Stash i understant, the itep must be somewhere. But the budget hell no
---
Brand new player here...lvl 23.  I struggle enough as it is to maintain an ammo supply.   I often have to use non-build weapons while I farm for supplies.   (I’m dumb and chose to use a shotgun).  
---
Making it even harder to kill mobs might be fine for you lvl 200+ people but it’s going to wreck me.
---
And you don't get bored one shotting almost everything?
---
I don't really think the game benefits from more ways to upgrade your character and equipment, the looter shooter elements isn't where the game shines imo
---
I think adding in new interesting eveny quests with good npc banter like riding shotgun, adding more allys with interesting questlines, bringing back enemies from the old games like the floaters, maybe adding in an actual companion system and fleshing out the pet system would all be better ways to make the game more enjoyable
---
Im asking to display cases not use more budget when assign items to it. The budget of the camp as whole does not needs to change i dont even whants that
---
What lol
---
Interior camp spaces are supposed to help with this
---
You are asking for items to not consume budget, while adding display elements, it amounts to the same request, more things displayed which is what causes the issue..
---
XP for event completion vs bupkis is why I do rank 1
---
Sleep and lunch boxes,  are three other two 🤯
---
Dude I got this just for the .50 skin bc I absolutely loved the .50 cal and that skin is the only one Bethesda ever released for it. Yeah the Power armor looks cool and all but you can’t see shit when you’re holding many weapons including the .50 cal.
---
that's beyond the point. as per the title, a lot of people say that 'bloodied builds are just as tanky as full health builds', which is clearly not true.
---
it's also not possible to sneak in daily ops.
---
True, but posting here saying it’s crap and you are going to stop playing is the wrong sort of noise.. especially if you haven’t played in the PTS.
---
If you are on PC get in the PTS and test stuff then give proper reasoned feedback.
---
Move everything in the stash to the characters inventory of course.  Feel the weight of your intended stash limitation crimes.
---
Hold on I thought with the system I was proposing, that it would be with Legendary perks having 4 ranks, and each rank costing the same coins as it's level so 1/2/3/4 levels to max out a Legendary perk would be 10 coins which under my system would equal 100 levels. So that already beats the 'current system' which you are saying nets you 2 max Legendary perks at 300 levels. Also under my system can still exchange their unneeded perk cards from packs gained from score or levelling up.
---
Yeah I use lunchboxes in events. Hopefully I'll be able to complete the scoreboard. My next reward is the power armour
---
When I find them, I get rid of them. Simple as that.
---
Right? Like I have literally never even taken a screenshot in game for anything. Only time I press that button is when I'm stuck at a point in a game, or a freeze or figuring out controls or some shit and I press every button available. Not like the ps4 taught me how to use that button when I got the system (maybe it did? Didn't care about it if it did).
---
Same here
---
Bloodied builds mean low health with adrenal reaction and nerd rage. Weapons with the bloodied prefix aren’t necessary. Since you use adrenal reaction, it sounds like you have a bloodied build.
---
Someome needs to redo their build. 😐
---
It just seems to be a weird thing to draw the line on to me
---
It would just be something like a new Arktos outfit 
---
I think all the people bitching about the new balance changes coming up are acting more entitled than this dudes fashion requests, so it just seemed odd to me you chose this particular post to call out haha
---
Why can't you move the lights? Are they on a foundation?
---
I’d rather have another rad barrel plan that I can trade or sell ;) So I go with premade and get r4 in 5min. If I wanted XP I’d just do line in the sand with tent or nuke tanagra town.
---
This is true in my opinion, some people act like bloodied doesn't sacrifice anything for the damage, a junkies build will be much much more survivable and to an extent more flexible because of it, see the daily ops that are coming.
---
A bloodied character that is caught off guard will die, a full health one won't more often than not in the same situation. Only valid thing there is saying that death has no meaning in the game and it really doesn't but why are you wearing armor at all then if it doesn't matter that you die a lot?
---
They tend not to listen to that. In the end they brought down vaultraids since nobody played them, they did not change anything. I think they cant make stealth work in it so they made "piercing gaze". They have done internal testing on it before PTR so they know.
---
Nothing. It's worth nothing. If someone offered you caps you should take it. Ultracite PA plans are the easiest PA plans to acquire. You literally get the plans to craft it from completing the BOS questline.
---
Ahh pettiness, absolving the abuser of their actions one hypocritical action at a time.
---
OP, you may like the brotherhood science scribe outfit if you want a labcoat with pants btw
---
My Unstoppable Monster hits for ~1300 currently, with the full benefit of Adrenaline.  On the PTS server? 377.  Level 50 super mutants take 1-2 hits, level 73 2-3, level 100 3-4.
---
Also, my prized 3* instigating lever that used to hit for ~1300 now hits for ~450.  It was OP before, being able to one-shot most enemies, but now it's just kinda meh because it requires a headshot to achieve a one-shot.
---
Maybe this is how it should have been from the start, but a change of this magnitude is pretty unwelcome.  I would have preferred that they leave things the same and just scaled enemies up to achieve the same effect; for example, if they gave level 100 super mutants more damage resistance and 4x the HP of level 68.  This way, it won't feel as though anything is being taken away.
---
I also agree that they should buff the damage perk cards to compensate here.  The base damage of the Unstoppable Monster was ~330 before I equipped 3* Unarmed and ~350 after.  That's not really much of an incentive to choose that perk over some others, and kind of invalidates the idea of a specific build.  Rifleman and Commando perks suffer from this as well.
---
I do spawn in relatively close to the machines. I've always had it further away in the past.
---
Doesn't matter. Daily ops did not happen yet. If you feel you are vulnerable while you are doing bloodied build,  it means you are not doing things right. Try moving out of scorchbeast crop duster attacks. Try to heal your rads if you are about to die of rad damage. Try to keep sneaking, not go rambo for no reason. Try using your brain in general
---
I’m always so happy to get a new building set
---
Annoying! Did they start responding again, or did you drop?
---
Im asking to assined items not use budget, not camp items. And as i say in my post items displayd are world items, they do not affect the performance that much. Specially that they could increse the budget of the case as a whole a little bit and negate the budget of individual items. That because things like the boubblehead display are just not usable as they use 21 slots and a freaking huge ammount of budget
---
Can definitely agree. Also sucks that male characters can't wear a skirt in a lab coat (they're fine with wearing red dresses, swimsuits, and asylum outfits; but not with an open-collar and skirt with their lab gear :-/)
---
Mhm, and bottomless FO1st scrap box with tons of junk is okay

---
Ah, but Bethesda doesn't manage their tech debt at all. Epic/Unreal Engine, Valve/Source, Unity, etc. do regular updates to their products that refactor large parts of the engine and implement proper fixes to existing bugs and add new features. Bethesda, on the other hand, just adds another layer of poorly conceived stopgap measures and half-cocked bandaid fixes that fall apart and cause bizarre bugs when a developer even looks at them wrong. 
---
Bethesda's engine is trash.
---
Already did
---
It would be easy. 
---
Post-war doesn’t have the same arbitrary values as pre-war does because there is no society. 
---
If anything it’s unrealistic that anyone would wear a skirt in the apocalypse.
---
Don’t be such an asshole, they just had an idea/request.
---
Interior camps can increase the budget as a whole. Thats not what im asking for. I can be safely happy with the current budget if they just negate individual assinged items to display case budget
---
I already reported it
---
Don't worry, Todd will give you legendary rolling pins instead of shovels.
---
Something wrong with you this morning? You seem awfully triggered by someone who just so happens to have a different opinion than you.
---
Glad it died. I usually spam SBQs corpse with explosive fire before looting, but was in a hurry and forgot.
---
This! When the update goes online I can problaby effort 2 level 1 cards. Changed my build so often
---
The guy who posted that here in this reddit, people defend bethesda, should read these comments. 
---
Answering the OP post, if your completionist than damn dude that sucks to be you. I don't really mind at al, its there so you can enjoy at leisure they should probably tone it down a bit and be less grindy
---
Every object you place has to be rendered, lots of objects need to be rendered in camps and that's what effects the performance, they need to limit that so that's why anything displayed consumes budget.
---
Whats a true endgame content for you and name the games that do it right
---
No not really, just poking reddicucks for shiggles. You okay with that or you gonna report me?
---
Same damage? Yeah, if you compare lever rifle and western revolver. Both has same damage, but lever have silencer, western - no.
---
10mm pistol bloodied with lowHP, adrenal and full perks has 200 damage per shoot with semiauto  hardened receiver, 18 ammo capacity and 43 fire rate. Handmade with fully auto receiver has 297 damage per shot, 30 ammo capacity and 75 fire rate. Absolutely equal conditions, yeah (NO)
---
Yeah :P
---
Yep, this is why i got rid of my bobble head display, loved it, but took up too much budget, getting to that stage with the magazines too and i haven't even collected them all :/
---
Me either. I have a few different setups I can run depending on situation. Just actually experimenting with a commando style now.
---
Why would I. I play the game my way, you play it yours.
---
Why so serious?
---
Named bosses with set loot tables = even more of a grind.
---
No way do I want 76 to turn into borderlands light where you have to farm a specific boss hundreds of time to get that god roll weapon!
---
I'm level 25O+ and I just played on the PTS this morning for a bit. I'm a sneaky sniper build, not bloodied nor junkies. Everything in Welch was level 25. A lot of the mutants in Harper's Ferry were level 100. Scorched were mostly level 75. It did take more ammo to take the muties down, but not much more. They actually gave more of the same ammo back than I used in most cases.
---
what do you mean 'doesn't matter'? that's the whole point of this topic. people ***do*** say that and it's clearly false.
---
plus, should I remind you of this post when daily ops go live? will it matter when it's live? I don't see how a couple months invalidates the fact that you can't sneak in daily ops, but ok.
---
you have 3 options when playing bloodied: sneak, armor and PA. unless you pick PA, which means no legendary armor, you ***are*** vulnerable. period.
---
Exactly, so why that even exist if we cant even use it right?
---
Am I ever serious? Ign Nekrosias for all your griefing needs
---
Uk?
---
They do indeed affect performance once they are displayed, it's not like just because it's an item that spawns in the world it changes anything 
---
The game has to read the placement and location of every individual camp item in your camp in order to spawn them correctly, tons of displayed items would have just as much of an effect as anything else 
---
Except for like turrets maybe, since they're animated and have combat ai and stuff
---
On a side note, if lightweight mini nukes are coming, can we please get craftable mini nuke arrows and bolts?  
---
If for no other reason than the immersion into the game. We have a tinkering bench, tons of scrap to play with, and bizarrely frightening irradiated monstrosities trying to eat us.  I cant be the only wastelander that'd look at the raider punk in camp and say "Hold my Nuka shine, i want to try something".
---
So I'm new can someone give me a little more detail on what OP means by "spiked me"
---
Wrong system.
---
Im hunting high level players like him with my lvl 50 pvp toon.
---
Would you mind share his ign? Happened on PC?
---
😂
---
I forget about those darn treasury notes. Had like 350 last time I looked. Nobody has anything I want lol. Now I see how a weekly limit would be better then a daily.
---
Drills
---
I had a few disappear but they’ve always been there when I’ve come back 5 minutes later
---
Me and my friend have a little moral rule. If someone has a glitched camp (e.g. ammo factories), we nuke it.
---
you do realise FO76’s players are Vault Dwellers that were alive Pre-War, right? And their main goal is to rebuild society, right? So they would hold the same values and societal beliefs they did Pre-War, right?
---
It’s not unrealistic if the game is based on rebuilding society using beliefs they had in the Fallout universe Pre-War...
---
Oh, so now you want to change the values of the ranks also, which wasn’t clear in your description. 
---
No, the system is fine, our target should be two max perks and anything else is icing on the cake, i don’t know why people keep asking them to tweak it just to speed it up.
---
remember this is across all characters on an account, based on you plan, i’d have 6 max perks due to my character levels and all the excess cards i’ve picked up, especially after getting 13 packs from SCOre
---
Here you go. This is shortly after forming a Building group, before the 2 extra INT points from my little private group kick in.

---
I hear you! I have already quit my job and I just ignore my wife (she still earns all the money so I can't get rid of her). Play on!
---
I agree on the respawn bug. 
---
But her not landing is caused by pathing/aggro issues which is to blame on players with their stupid tents all over the place, stating on top of the tents, on fences and inside the bunker area where the SBQ would never be able to land. 
---
Oh and let’s not forget that sometimes she just likes to play with whatever is running around in the nuke zone, like some robots, super muties or whatever
---
I love the idea of mini nukes attached to arrows
---
Yes, exactly. I have played explosives, heavy guns, unarmed, rifles and bows, on live, I only tested rifles unarmed and bows on the PTS as that's what cards I had available, it feels like the perk cards do almost nothing now comparatively and I am having trouble with sneak hits, they don't seem to do much at all either (noticed it with the rifles, barely any more damage from sneak hits if at all, will need to look at it more though)
---
I wanted to do my usual run I do when I log in and ended up sitting in front of a sentry bot for what felt like ages hitting him with my gauntlet, neither me nor him took much damage. I loved using a bloodied black powder rifle as a side, for fun but now it can't one hit, like anything anymore so I just can't use it with the long reload.
---
This update just forced players to stick even closer to the meta and I find that sad, heck I was even able to use chainsaws for ghoul farming in the burrows before, no way I can do that now, loads of fun that's no longer to be had.
---
Dam I never noticed this and now I want science skirt for my dude lmao
---
There’s a lot of exaggeration going on with the new changes. Here’s some reality: 
---
Super high DPS builds will feel the changes to damage calculation the most. Average players, generalists, full health builds won’t feel much of a difference, if anything.
---
The scaled up enemies aren’t much harder to kill than what’s there now. You’re not going from 1-3 shots for most mobs to 200 shots. It’s more like 2-6 depending on the build &amp; weapons, with plenty of things still going down in one shot for high powered builds. 
---
The Forest, Ash Heap, Toxic Valley and a number of other quest-related locations still have an enemy level cap of 25, some bosses hit 50. There’s still plenty of safe space on the map. For a high level player there’s no practical difference between a level 1 Scorched and a level 25. They both die in one bullet.
---
- People are telling bloodied/junkies to just suck it up, and are happily throwing them under the bus.  
---
- People are also claiming that most players are bloodied/junkies.  
---
- I have never once encountered a bloodied/junkie's player who wasn't very supportive of the idea of buffing all the other builds to make them competitive.  
---
- I also haven't seen any bloodied/junkies players who aren't willing to shave a bit off the top *within reason*
---
So all these people have decided to cut off their nose to spite their face by attacking and alienating "most players" who were supportive of them getting a buff.. And the hill they are choosing to die on is a global nerf because devs are too clueless and uncreative to balance builds at around 7/10 so they are dragging them all down to 3/10. 😐
---
*cue post about how amazing this community is*
---
I wouldn't really call legendary cards as 'min-maxing'.  They are being painted as the next level of progression after hitting 50.
---
Min-Maxing would be trying to get a full set of perfectly starred legendary gear.
---
They didn't experience daily ops. Of course they are talking out of their experience and daily ops isn't something they had to deal with cause it's not in the game rn. If you want to keep pushing that daily ops stuff, do it AFTER it's been released when enough people have already played it. Maybe their opinion will change by then but you dragging future content to current balancing is just absurd
---
Ahhhhhhahaha you shall reap what you have sewn young man!! Well played ✌️
---
You want to *paint* a stealth suit?
---
PC is the only system
---
If you watch the latest video from juicehead https://youtu.be/PJSmiroHkBk sorry if the link doesn’t work but he says in the PTS that not so much weapons have been nerfed but more like the builds have been I.e blooded, junkies and all that other stuff 
---
There was a LOT of maths in that part of the video and I failed maths lmao
---
That's a really good point. In this example, since it's a robot part, we cold add a Tesla additional damage that would also hit nearby enemies.
---
Yea, this game is really not orientated towards casual play. It seems unless you play an hour or two a day or are willing to drop $50-100 a month they really aren’t to interested in your patronage. And I get it, players like you and I don’t put gilding on Todd’s toilet or buy him a summer home. Just seems to be the way online game are, companies gotta milk all the profit they can as fast as they can before the next big thing comes along. I mean can many people honestly say they will keep playing as much as they are now once cyberpunk 2077 is released.
---
I have both heavy and shotgun as backups, but find I rely on the shotgun more.
---
you guys noticed it’s a level 10 weapon, right?
---
I don't pretend to understand the game mechanics, i understand there has to be some sort of limit, it's just annoying because i love the displays, but i end up removing them to add in stupid stuff like crops i use and other useful stuff.
---
outfits that already have backpacks built in make whatever backpack you have equiped invisible
---
This sounds like fun. I watched JuiceHead do a gameplay of the Daily OPs and I was excited. I want events where I get my ass kicked. I want to feel that I earned the kills. Definitely excited to try this out.
---
I’ve had the same issue with a hunting rifle. Tried everything and it doesn’t fix it.
---
LitS and tanagra both very good 👍 unsure what you mean by "premade"?
---
jesus, and here I am still with a 3x3 box and sketchy looking electricity running everywhere.
---
Bethesda hasn't nerfed any builds since the TSE nerf.  However if you look into the nerf a bit more. If you're worried about your bloodied build. It kills most things in 2-4 shots instead of 1. Might be a massive nerf but 6-10 shots to kill anything over level 50 is normally the case if you're not a bloodied build and most builds this hasn't change anything.
---
What will happen is bloodied will no longer be meta and a new one will form. For most online games this is normal and happens very few mouths.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
I don't use nerd rage, adrenal is just a fallback if things go wrong and need a little damage boost, I don't intentionally gimp myself with low health.
---
Pre-made team. 
---
I am part of a discord community that always has people doing groups and most use voice chat
---
Vault raids were not in the PTS before being launched...
---
no sir, I just snipe.
---
keeo
---
Adrenal reaction plus strange in numbers
---
Agreed. Rewards need to be better. Bullion, scrip and  2 star minimum drops
---
I roll with a .50 cal silenced hunting rifle with long recon scope, silenced combat rifle with medium scope, and a handmade with a bayonet.  The .50 sniper for thinning out an area from afar, the combat rifle for closer quarters and places where I might get discovered and mobbed, and the handmade for when I don't plan to sneak (for instance when I am using mines or want to make speed through an area of weak mobs).
---
And that exactly why display items contribute to the camp budget
---
He pointed how repetitive and how they are the same dailies over and over again to build up rep. You can't brush that off and say he didn't complain about it.
---
But the different areas are all the same once you get to a certain level. There are no enemies that are a real challenge and cannot be taken out easily. 
---
And before you say anything, I’m not a bloodied build. I use a hunters sledge for most things or a bloodied pickaxe for large groups and run around Appalachia looking like a teddy bear or when needed a bottle of pepto. My armor is a hodgepodge of five pieces that have weight reductions on them and I don’t own any stealth suits or gauss weapons, etc.
---
I think you can find that combo just east of Top of the World. Not sure if that’s Far East enough for you though.
---
My psn is the same as above ^^ am on most of the time
---
I'll take a look, that's definitely far enough east for me, thanks!
---
&gt; If the vocal minority was better at math, they would understand that this truely was long time coming.
---
Oh sorry. I guess next time a company takes something that you enjoy playing/spending money on, and changes it to a shell of it's former self and takes away the reason you pay them money, just get better at math, bro. 
---
People aren't mad because they can't do math, or that Bethesda is correcting their bad math. People are mad because Bethesda is taking something they love, something they spent hundreds of not thousands of hours with, and flushing it down the toilet in a misguided attempt to "balance" something nearly two years into the game. Something *their own employees use to play the game*. I guess they don't know math, either.
---
If bloodied builds are a "vocal minority" then why do you even care if they exist? Does it hurt you somehow that they one-shot ghouls and super mutants? Maybe that's the exact power a level 400+ character should have - one shotting something 340 levels below him. But, I guess my limited understanding of math just won't let me comprehend that it should have never been that way, and that a level 600 character **should** take 4 bullets to kill a level 48 super mutant. Especially when they sacrifice 80 - 90% of their health to be able to do so. But, math hard... damage good.
---
Nerfing something is a lazy way to make content harder. Now people will need more time to get different gear, more time to farm junk to make ammo, more time to change up a build that they've already perfected. More time to take a math class.
---
Do I have any answers to add challenging new content into the game? Nope, I'm just not that good at math.
---
I canceled my subscription over this. This seriously kills the game for me.
---
Who cares.
---
I've read things that make me think that an on-line game this week benefits from the number of daily log ins, maybe that this is a statistic that is reported to investors or something like that. If that is the case, I wonder if people having multiple characters would increase the number of daily log ins?
---
"remember this is across all characters on an account, based on you plan, i’d have 6 max perks due to my character levels and all the excess cards i’ve picked up, especially after getting 13 packs from SCOre"
---
Sorry what you said about across all characters on an account is something I'm not aware of can you explain?
---
Are you saying that the current system allows me to trade in enough cards (without sacrificing the necessary + utility/crafting cards for my build) so that by level 300 I can get 2 maxed Legendary perks? 
---
And that the amount of coins I have applies to other characters so then if I choose perk A + D for character 1 at level 300, does character 2 also get perk A + D automatically because it applies accountwide or do they get to make their own choice of two other perks like B + C?
---
So then if character 2 also becomes level 300, there will be 4 maxed Legendary perks across the account?
---
Something else that'd be fun would be manually detonated mini nukes. I'd like to aggro mobs as if i were a super mutant suicider.
---
I usually have problems finding smaller enemies that are legendary after the queen fight, sometimes corpses just disappear into the distance when hit by an explosion. So when you get a 3 star stingwing, or something gets turned into an ash pile and phases through the ground, this is more for that. This might also help with disconnects prior to being able to loot the enemies.
---
Could someone in the PTS please explain something to me. So I saw in recent footage there are legendary Special perk cards that can push your Special points to a max of 15 for the category. Do those Legendary Perk Cards take up one of the 6 legendary slots? The reason being is I am hoping to see if it is possible to technically get 15 Special Points in each category. I know in the base game you have 45 Special Points and can max 3 of them with 11 points to spare.
---
Could you give a bit more precise location? I don't really know where to look so the odds of me walking past it are pretty high. Sounds promising!
---
there's video of it and feedback in the forums. as soon as you enter an area, you're found. fore example:
---
reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iaq4zb
---
not to mention, what about the rest of my points? the daily ops specifically change nothing.
---
I stopped playing and the legendary run was a nice touch but its cosmetic and most of the stuff if you grind enough can get,I know its a motivational play from them,but its become a second or third unpaid job lol,look at this point i thought we would get a special events like a mega supreme queen or goul walking through town and a crap load of us would have to fight it or have open season where everything is everywhere and we had to fight for our lives,but that's a dream I didn't think I would just be a farmer (no disrepect to farmers) chasing away pests and drunk on moonshine all the time i just expected more.
---
yep, displayed items are not the biggest problem within camp building. They render in the world in the hundreds. A few of them our camp will not explode any server. The limit will still exist, they can maybe increase a little bit the budget of the case it self to limit the usage, but make the bublehead display more useful for exemple
---
Those who like Graphics, and those who want mods. Those people. You know creators not consumers
---
Also some apparels are weird for male too lol, like asylum outfit
---
Ah ha, fair enough, I was half asleep when I read your message. Don't mind me. Lol
---
Do you use your camera to check?
---
Yes. Fuck solo players. IN A MULTIPLAYER GAME
---
You want endgame content and rewards? Then l2social
---
Not gonna lie, I smell a reply from you coming that goes something like, 'nope!  That game's end game was also a grind and your answer is null and not accurate!'

Call me skeptical, but im willing to bet this skeptic is 100% accurate.  As for games with good end game set ups, i honestly cannot think of any in recent history, however, the key to a great end game is to either make it substantial and not just a grind, or make the grind feel like there is a payoff beyond the item itself (I hear warframe does an excellent job of making its 'grind gates' for items heavily built into the storyline, and that is what many games like FO76 are missing.
---
I know, I know, technically the dailies for the factions are 'lore linked' but as many have said, how many 'rogue raiders' are there to kill and just how many times is that dipshit on foundation gonna lose shit before management decides that is NOT the dude to put in charge of monitoring and guarding supplies.
---
Simply put, you can like Fallout and still support the gripes against FO76.  In fact, while a bold statement, i would go as far as to say those who truly love Fallout should feel terribly let down by Bethesda.  At this juncture, no matter if the game becomes a great game or remains the grey area it resides in now, its inarguable that Bethesda's actions show that Fallout 76 was a game of convenience for Bethesda; created partially to 'cash in' on 'online fallout' that many mod makers requested for fallout 4, but Moreno because Bethesda's creation kit engine is a dinosaur and with Starfield super behind schedule and fan bois dying for the next ES6 update, they didn't want to spend the capital on updating the creation kit engine and instead shit out 'fallout 4 online, now with zero story or NPCs!' in efforts to grab as much cash as possible before letting it die when the new console generation fully takes hold in winter 2021 after a year on the market for purchase.
---
Mark my words, if FO76 doesn't truly fuck up Bethesda financially, and likely it won't since they technically spent very little on the project, they will hopscotch right into 2022 game events, touting the new starfield and progress on ES6, and likely to tease Fallout 5 before end of 2022, pretending that FO76 was a 'test run' for online functions they will offer in the new engine for Fallout 5.
---
Therefore I am torn; while I would love a truly single player game in FO5 that allows online coop (aka Far Cry 5/New Dawn) but i am still very jilted by the whole FO76 experience.  Some ups and downs I will admit since joining the BETA way back when, but overall I'm disappointed and let down by FO76 as a whole and I can tell im not the only fan let down too.
---
Again, different strokes for different folks.
---
I don’t enjoy playing with aim-bot hackers.
---
Can we also fix the fire barrels? For some reason they're using a bright white light, when it should be a more yellowish-orange glow for the fire.
---
Not saying this is how it is implemented but its ment to get harder as you level, keeping the same general difficulty for the level your at. Its nurfing damage from end game builds not damage from non-legendary weapons or making enimes have more hp at regular levels (sub level 50)
---
That’s pretty much my attitude towards anything in this game, including daily atoms when they were available. But now since it’s getting obvious that they want to make it more tedious and less enjoyable (less fights more bullet farming), I’ll just play less and spend my time elsewhere.
---
Don't have a camera on my main, got tired of world hopping and wasting caps to get it.
---
I feel ya. I wanted to make a “library” in my home with low light, displays, and magazines (I have collected them all), but by the time I got that one room done I had no budget for anything else. I was like, joy! I took down the magazines but left the bobble head stand and turned it into and office with a nice reading corner
---
I always put on my stealth suit and collect ore. I let the “big boys” have all the xp killing. Been fortunate to complete several times. Not gotten crap for rewards though.
---
You like to stroke different folks
---
Wait. More intelligence equals more damage resistance with secret service armor?
---
That's wacky.  I'll have to watch the video because I'm curious about how they would have even tried to sell that, or work it into fallout 4.
---
Lucky bug man
---
"One Wasteland" to me is the most pointless, ridiculous idea I've ever heard of for an "MMO" type game.  While they're at it, why not just remove character levels entirely?  Then ... remove XP from the game.  There will be no point in levels or XP.  Leave it the way it is!  I LIKE knowing that a level 10 can't survive in the Cranberry Bog.  It took time and effort to get to the point where I can survive in Cranberry Bog alone.  I LIKE knowing that if I want to test out something in a low level area, I can go to the Forest and do just that...    
---
I personally feel that "One Wasteland" is going to completely ruin this game.
---
Yeah, that's a biggie too, not to mention it would be cool just to have more loading screens from all the pictures catalogued over the years.
---
Bloodied melee is 80-90 percent
---
Obviously people will hop in their PA during daily ops lol. Just like they do when they have to fight the queen in a nuked area. As I said, use your brain
---
I played 6 radiation rumbles in a row where I was the only one who went for the ore.  So I did all the work to complete the actual event while everyone else got xp.
---
So I changed my play style when I notice groups not sharing responsibilities.  Now, I alternate either collecting ore until I get it to level one and then switch to shooting things or just shoot things and let others do the ore or not, event fail or not.  It is surprisingly satisfying.
---
I want the labcoat, but worn open with a vault tec jumpsuit like the Fallout 3 Vault Lab Coat
---
You don’t need to work hop.. set up your personal terminal .. then check it it will tell you where a camera is.. look for “suspicious person”
---
I’m not explaining it, how can you make recommendations to change the system when you don’t even understand what’s coming.
---
Tried the terminal the other day and it didn't give me this option.
---
How is that weird? I haven't noticed:O
---
Not sure if some guy was trying it, but I did have one guy buy up all the legendaries I was selling. I got the full caps for them and he also dropped me about 1k 5.56 ammo before teabagging twice, heart emoting, and then running off.
---
Ask Bethesda for a refund of your atoms.
---
I'll have to check it out.  Nothing in fallout 4 really seems like it was made with multiplayer in mind.  I'm curious if it was scrapped in preproduction, or if it was floated as a later edition to be added or resold.
---
And there you go with base insults....oh well, just goes to show your level of intellectual development.
---
Shotguns are dead. Bethesda nerfed them into the ground. You have to rely on a bug and only use them in vats for them to even be viable. It's really sad bc I miss my shotgun build, blowing up everything within a couple feet in 1-3 shots was so much fun.
---
'bloodied is just as tanky *while wearing PA*' is different from 'bloodied is just as tanky'. I also find it funny that you went from 'just sneak lol' to 'just use PA lol', which essentially confirms what I said: unless you're wearing PA, which means no legendary armor, no, bloodied is not as tanky as full health builds.
---
Public TEST server
---
I can't give mine away. I stopped stocking them for 0 or 1 cap.  Either I'm stupid lucky with getting them and unlucky in selling them or they aren't very rare on xbox.
---
No. What I mean is they were taken down since hardly anyone played them. This feels like the same.
---
This guy.
---
Bruh this is reddit, you can suck my intellectual development
---
I wouldn’t be so sure. Magic weapons function based on fire rate, server lag and specific pre/suffixes like junkies, 33% vats, etc. 
---
They might change the pre/suffixes but I doubt they’ll change fire rate or server lag. 
---
I own a few magic weapons and I hope they’ll fix them sooner than later. But I do t think they’ll manage to do that in p22 and in any case, they’ll probably beak more than they fix.
---
Because they dire beams of light or a jet of plasma, not a group of small projectiles as a shotty does :-)
---
I have this all the time now too. I’ve completed all quests and had camera for over 400 levels. Also have over 200 film
---
The area is enormous so it's hard to tell where it begins and ends haha, you just gotta pick a spot, it's a massive nice camp area that few people seem go explore since there aren't many points of interest there 
---
I'll try and take a screenshot of the map location when I can hop on, but that may be in a few hours 
---
If you find it before then let me know though haha!
---
Why? If you didn't bullets on it and I did why do you deserve said legendary when you didn't contribute to the kill? 
---
Literally just asking to see your response
---
Only?? Man I've been playing since release and I'm only 286. But I don't play non stop.
---
Also apparently after the nerf, your DPS will still be lower after legendary perks than it is now.
---
Hahahahahaha....boy, you guys are so easily triggered.
---
That is completely false!
---
 People who are killing the Queen under a minute use Buff's , FOOD buffs (they just fixed)+ chems and nukashine, you can get to 10-12k-20k hit damage. Or Godmode , that has not been fixed..
---
Most bloody unarmed builds do , with some buffs , 2000-3000. 
---
video showing the massive difference
---
I used a double barrel and a combat till I got my Gauss. I'ma a level 212.
---
Yes. Because that has a maximum of 38 line items. 33 types of scrap and 5 types of flux.
---
One piece of Steel Scrap and 10,000 pieces of Steel Scrap use of the same amount of server memory, because it’s still one line item. 
---
- Item:Scrap_Steel(qty;00001)
---
- Item:Scrap_Steel(qty;186A0)
---
Those are both one line item. The first is one piece of Steel Scrap. The second is 10,000 pieces of Steel Scrap.  
---
That’s why the Scrap Box can work. It only stores Scrap, not *Junk*. So it never had to keep track of more than 38 line items.
---
You don't got the equipment to trigger me son
---
Idk about you but my full uny SS armor practically makes me immortal even with low hp. 
---
The only deaths are poison and assultron beams. That’s it.
---
Theres a lot that could be done here, tbh. "Shotguns" could be a bot vaguer and include scattershot weapons, which would open up the Black Powder Blunderbuss which is already in the game but as useless as a Stalker's Walking Pin.
---
And also I can't help but think that out of all possible weapons to craft in a post-apocalyptic scenario, a Pipe Shotgun would be by far the easiest. It would be fun to run around with an Explosive Pipe Shotgun with the durability benefits of both Gunsmith and Licensed Plumber 😻
---
There's definitely some solution that could be implemented, if your gallery is full and you take those 'daily' shots, they still count for the quest even that they're not saving in the gallery.
---
Son?
---
If I had to guess, I’m older than you, son.
---
And on the maturity scale, much older.
---
Why don’t you go home and play with your presents?
---
This.  While the occasional asstroll exists in all games, most griefers who attack me are RPing raiders and don't go too far beyond just looking to incite some PVP.
---
The last two I had I just invited them to a party, asked what they needed, and they just laughed, apologized and copped to being bored and not in need of anything, then bouncing to another base to rinse/repeat.
---
Its been my experience that if you engage griefers with humor and not take the game so seriously, most admit they just like to get a rise out of peeps who take this game waaaaaaay too seriously.
---
Male characters with an dress lol, also that just an exemple but the swinsuit... I don't know why they don't have made some changes for some outfit.
---
I'm always using a female characters so that don't bother me but it's look really weird sometimes on both ^^
---
did you watch the clip? I have 600 dr and er and all the defensive perks and still died in 5 seconds flat.
---
of course things would play out differently if I were actually playing the game instead of just standing there, but that doesn't detract from the fact that bloodied builds are hardly tanky.
---
So many people on the forums have been feedback about how shitty the coin system is and yet they refuse to change it because I doubt they even play their own game anymore. 
---
So watch. I bet it goes live and when the rest of the console player base and a good portion of PC player base that didn't use PTS sees how shitty it is and everyone is complaining they'll switch it to something else. But only after everyone uses all their coins and has scrapped every card they own besides their build leaving all those people without the ability to use the system they replaced it with.
---
Intelligence affects Durability of crafted items. 
---
Buttressed affects Damage Resistance
---
I went bloodied to stop being griefed, you tend to be left alone when it's obvious you can defend yourself
---
Yeah, the only viable build now is a commando.  Shotguns have been fun but that will end when they fix the "magic" bug.
---
The legendary perk system is a further incentive to stick to only one character (to unlock slots) and to one build (to scrap unused perk cards for points).
---
I’m all for people running whatever build they want! That’s the way this game was meant to be played! 
---
As an optimized build I just get annoyed when players who don’t want a specialty build say they can’t compete. That’s the point! Flexible builds are supposed to be jacks of all trades but masters at none. Besides that, enjoy the game however feels best. There’s dozens of paths you can take
---
I saw a foosball table (table soccer\[US\]/table football\[UK\]) that was interactive and an interactive shooting gallery that played an animation.
---
My crossbow had 38 bolts in a "magazine" for a while before I scrapped it.
---
Seems like a fairly common issue to have with various types of weapons, no idea what causes it.
---
Are you sure the straightjacket for males is a dress? I thought it was just a long jacket lol
---
Silly. You aren't supposed to have a life. 
---
Fallout First!
---
i got a quad ammo, +33% vats hit chance double barrel that i use as my primary weapon. i mainly use it cuz it has a magic effect making vats hits deal insane damage, but the quad effect really helps since it turns two shots before reloding into eight.
---
if i recall correctly, +50% limb damage is also a magic effect, so you could sell it for a decent price
---
Cause you are playing brain dead. Move out of damage over time. Use stimpacks. Try to sneak. Heal rads. Follow these simple steps and you will not die. It's you not playing properly, not that build is squishy
---
I'm sure my dude, you gotta be, of course you are. They are an excellent source of caps, caps are close to meaningless tho. Go grab your cane and go get those kids off your lawn, okay champ?
---
Naaah Asylum worker outfit !
---
I can't get in from either character.  Thought I was only one.
---
And ditch those damn frog eggs. It is honestly disgusting we use frog eggs for donuts.
---
TBH I'd definitely use one if it had great effects.
---
A double-barrelled with that Quadruple Ammo Capacity effect would be pretty neato.
---
No i wouldn't. I just stick to my combat shotgun or gauss
---
Maybe you were selling for a good price and he was grateful so gifted you some ammo? I will teabag dropped good for people so they see em, as well as shoot near the bag.
---
We already can milk certain brahmin. Also there is code in game mentioning bread. But yeah, making cream, fried/scrambled eggs, etc would be nice.
---
How much hp do you have
---
Ohhh right I forgot that was a thing 
---
That is odd though, does that mean the asylum hired women exclusively?
---
Oooh bacon and eggs and toast.
---
When I see no one collecting and crouching to farm xp I just pull out my magic shotgun and just one shot one everything before these useless grinders see them. When I see at least one player ready to collect ore I put my stealth armour send a heart emotion and run like crazy to farm ore and don’t kill anything. I’m thinking to get a Tesla rifle to just spoil fun for those who sit and wait to farm xox instead of collecting ore
---
They’re real, and they’re spectacular.
---
(I have a TS3390 one myself)
---
I use an instigating pump action
---
Ssd, 32gb ram here and I still load in slower than many of my friends / team mates. 
---
I have the suspicion that it could be network driver related.
---
We need rad-hogs now.
---
DR is nearly meaningless....after about 350, it’s diminishing returns. You’re better off with armor with specific creature damage resistance.
---
My TS armor allows me to laugh in the face of Gutsys and Assaultrons.
---
What’s wrong with one wasteland?
---
No...game is already easy enough....collecting impart of the grind
---
You can already get awesome possom bacon
---
Ah, got it. I'm a Dad gamer on PS4 and my play time is mostly limited to after my kids are in bed. I loosely coordinate with others via PSN, but haven't checked out any of the FO76 discords yet. Maybe some day 🤔
---
Just don’t actually divorce your wife over fallout ok.
---
Probably and all men was fool ? x)
---
Ok cool so the options are 1 useless melee or 2 spend lots and lots and lots of ammo and resources. You wont be able to keep up. If you prefer tanky over being powerful then go look at division 2. That game is a trainwreck.
---
This is - I believe due to rate of fire, rather than an absolute decrease.
---
All to find a horde of Mounted plans!
---
So frustrated. Today i got at least 8 legendaries that i cant loot. It is not appearing on the screen
---
Ok I understand your point of view. Just because I've not heard about this system where it seems to be account wide from what you are suggesting, doesn't mean it isn't true so you would feel I'm commenting without even knowing about a part of it.
---
And I've read the post where someone laid out the current system under which which at 2 coins per discarded perk pack you would need to be level 300 to get 2 legendary perks, and their post proposed even faster progression than mine where at level 300 you would be well on your way to almost maxing your 6th legendary perk.
---
In that case we'll see what happens when they finally release it. I'm quite surprised by it being accountwide by what you are suggesting from your earlier post though. It's the first I've heard about it and none of the posts I've read seemed to mention such an important thing, like why miss that out. 
---
/thread closed
---
Yes, I think this is the real buff it needs. I would at least use it against lower level enemies if I could afford to carry around any mininukes.
---
Except BGS isn’t going to “buff” everyone to make the game easier. We already consume content faster than they can make it.
---
Easier was never in the cards.
---
 What about my kids?
---
Cork ended yesterday at 10 am est. they have not updated the number since 2 days ago.
---
I'm stunned that something like that doesn't exist in VTU now that you mentioned it
---
I know, I know. The world isn't as cynical as I may think. Just with an account less than a month old with only 2 posts asking the exact same thing seems like predatorial behavior. New people make accounts, yeah, but I'm just concerned.
---
I'd like to get those mannequins that the Operators had from Nuka World. Maybe get Moving target pieces that are 1x tile wide. Could adjust their height to have them at ground left, raised half way, or on the ceiling. Maybe even some sliding ceiling tiles. Would just need a dressable moving mannequin and sandbags and I could remake the Metro 2033 shooting gallery.
---
Unintelligent, why create content if you're going to put it behind a grind that would consume your life and still never even get there before the game is old enough to have it's servers go dead.
---
Hehe i se The great idea in this. But I just cut the Doors because of ppl not closing Doors after Them... If they are open when i arrives there i leave Them open. But clise Them if they are closed
---
Depends on what platform but there should be an inspect/repair button on Pip-Boy inventory.
---
Out of 200 not 150
---
Thanks \^\^
---
*3rd
---
You're forgetting about Encryptid.
---
Pretty sure it was exploitable in nuclear winter with the explosive bow, so they probably balanced it for that. With demo expert in NW its obnoxious already
---
I sell the, for 1 cap each now...
---
I mean, I get why. Sometimes segregation by sex is just more comfortable. I just worry for people who use it as a way to lure people in.
---
you want me to record the same clip with full health and a vanguard's set? because I guarantee you in that case I won't die in 5 seconds flat.
---
this topic isn't about skills or playstyle, it's about the **fact** that bloodied builds are not tanky. sure I could sneak, but not every bloodied build sneaks. and to counter that point, you can sneak as a full health build as well. so what? no to mention come daily ops you won't be able to sneak, bloodied or full health.
---
move? that's a sentinel set you're looking at. do you understand what that entails? stimpacks? granted I didn't use one, but in my testing it makes no difference. I can record another clip proving it, too. heal rads? then I'm not a bloodied build any longer and none of this applies.
---
*the build **is** squishy*.
---
Honestly levels 10-30, 30-50 and 50+ all play really differently.
---
At your stage if you see anything like me your gear is just too garbage to hang, around 30 once I had done more of the main quest I was much better geared for the grind up to 50, my perks started to work together etc
---
Thanks! I have that.
---
I can excuse broken atomic shop items and hacked weapons, but I draw the line at camp glitches!
---
Junkies is considered magic. Junkies + limb ain’t gonna do more as only one of the two is in effect. 
---
Gauss mini is explosive, effectively going into that FFR range required for magic to happen
---
Usually you’d need the penta barrel too, but if the server is real laggy it can happen without it
---
No it has its own Dr/ER though. I think it's around 150 for both and 1000 rad resist.
---
I wonder what a railway shotgun would be like...
---
I know, but I still want some kind of rad-hog. It could squeal and rush players applying that power-armor knock-down effect and a bleed proc. Could give tusks that would be scrappable for bone and a fair bit of meat.
---
You can see the vaulttec lab coats at the ag center, but only old skeleton corpses are wearing it, and you can’t pick them up :(
---
You think mabye they could just add that info to the screen....mabye when it is out of Beta they will.   Anyways good on you!
---
Totally get it. Currently taking a break. Which I know will leave me in the dust when I do go back and all the building parts are outdated, my armor sucks and my weapons are nerfed. And that's the part I hate.
---
more hp wouldn't change anything. the incoming damage would still be the same.
---
Even in Fallout 4 the scientist in vault 88 I think it was was wearing khakis and a button down with the labcoat whereas everyone else had jumpsuits. I just want that labcoat with jumpsuit outfit.
---
Thanks. I am going to have to go to mrmggmkg the purveyor
---
Nice idea, would be nice if you could create a farm for those animals so you can farm them, doubt it would happen, the chicken coop we already have dosent event produce eggs.
---
Nope. Nobody cares enough about your opinion to get hurt feelings.  You're just annoying.
---
Same buff the other weapons back to what they were, do something about with the useless prefixes and up the difficulty with one wasteland and see what happens from there.
---
yeah, creature-specific armor negates essentially all damage. that's no secret. but do you have multiple sets for each creature? all SS, all AP, all sentinel? do you carry them all around? do you switch on the fly as needed?
---
What happened to V1?
---
Technically the vault tec lab coat was in the atom shop as a clean variant. There is also two dirty labcoats in a boat at George's Junkyard on the northern side by the ticks.
---
I got a bloodied swing speed shovel today lol 😆
---
no clue.. but imma hold out for v3 yo
---
Well that's exactly what I've said in one of the comments here and in the updates to the post :)
---
I'm continually amazed by how this isn't a straight prestige system, but some convoluted mess instead. 
---
Get to 50 or 100, start over at 1. Get a coin. Retroactively prestige people already at that high of a level, letting them go back to whatever level they'd be out after it does the math. 
---
Why are they shooting themselves in the foot implementing this lazy and contrived bullshit?
---
What I'm saying is that on PTS right now, none of the formerly working magic weapons currently work. Might be less lag perhaps but they worked before on PTS and do not now.
---
I’m switching to Xbox when the new consoles come out ( all my friends play on xbox so no point in getting another playstation) and I plan to just start over with Fallout 76 when I do. Because of this i haven’t played in three days because no point in grinding when i’ll be restarting anyway. and it feels... good? 
---
I’m playing other games more and forgot how much I enjoyed gaming when it wasn’t a chore. Don’t get me wrong I absolutely love the game but these daily limits to account for a lack of content is garbage.  
---
What they need to do is just make like 15 weekly challenges they have increased score equal to what we’d get from all the dailies in week, and keep dailies at slightly less score than we get now as an extra little boost while we’re already playing. 
---
Then get rid of legendary scrip limits because those make absolutely no sense, and double the amount of gold bullion and caps you can get in a day. 
---
I won’t be playing again until November when the xbox drops, but I really hope they change some stuff up by then.
---
Just checked it now, the range of my CAMP is too small to have both the junk node and the water inside :(
---
No they usually drop less than you put into
---
1. How do you buy levels? 2.yes, haven’t played in 3 days, best vacation in awhile
---
Classic Bethesda baby
---
I carry two sets - Zealots and Troubleshooters. They have second and third perks which work well as general armor as well...it allows me to do really well in end-game boss fights and since I am tanky as hell anyway, it works everywhere else.
---
I tried a full Vanguards build and it sucked.
---
Would be cool if Watoga became like defense point to hold while waves and waves and waves of scorched attacked from all angles
---
Awesome, I will keep an eye out for that!
---
be a lot easier if people didnt complain about collecting the stupid animated cards..
---
I'm guessing sudden and extreme damage.
---
Bah no point in saying anything if you don’t think that more hp makes you live longer and stims heal more faster.
---
Any build will die if they stand still regardless. But the thing is no one is standing still and they will use stims.
---
How many of these so called magic weapon(s) are vats only to effectly be working ?
---
See all the people with duped legacies downvoting us. 
---
Pathetic human race, everyone wants to be the top dickhead and have more power than anyone else.
---
I used my bloodied double barrel 1 star for a long time. 
---
Then I got a bloodied pump 3 star and I fell in love. 
---
Yesterday I got my bloodied explosive combat shotgun. Sure it does way more damage. But I honestly still prefer my pump.
---
What about ultracite fusion cores or plasma cores?
---
We should just get X coins for every level we have.  We should then have the ability to scrap duplicate Perk cards we may have we may no longer want to get additional Perk cards, then allow us to level up the Legendary Cards.  That way we don't HAVE to scrap things we may want for alternative builds, while still get enough to reasonably level up cards.  Maybe start with 3 Perk Coins per level we get, then 1 Coin per level of the card we scrap.
---
Y'all need area mic turned on
---
Yes: the constant and predictable reload speed, the high damage output, the style, and the accuracy when equipped withTrue mods all make double barrels very useful for me when I play support builds (I use a Vampire's FFR +reload as the main weapon on one of my characters, though I also carry a Fancy shotgun for when a good rate office is needed)
---
Every iteration of the legendary perk system on the PTS has a near unanimous agreement that the system is terrible, yet here we are, still with the same system and the same problems.  It should be as simple as the paragon system in Diablo 3:  the more you play the higher you creep up the system.  As it stands now, the longer term players, the ones you’re tying to appeal to with this, start off being screwed over by the system.
---
So to me the question is what is the problem at Bethesda.  Is there some higher level manager dictating this system needs to be on par with 7600 hours?  Is there just arrogance in that players just don’t know how to dev?  Maybe this is the best they can do with the engine, who knows.  This system is supposed to be a hook for everyone, including (and I’d argue mostly for) the old timers who’ve done it all 100 times and are just playing because of the friends we made/will make.  If you start to get THOSE people to throw in the towel, there isn’t much hope left for the game.
---
That's irrelevant to the question OP asked.
---
Idk Fallout76builds was taken so I just put V2
---
If he blueprinted his camp he doesnt even care...
---
ok. what about super mutants? or ghouls? what do you do then? because I'd wager that against anything that's not robots or scorched, you're essentially as vulnerable as I am in the clip.
---
keep in mind I'm not talking about specific situations here. I'm talking about the big picture. bloodied builds are not tanky, let alone as tanky as full health builds, even with all the relevant defensive perks.
---
unless you're actually carrying around sets for every possible creature. and even then, that's not specific to bloodied builds. you can do that as a full health build as well.
---
No. I want a functioning toaster that makes toast or I’m stopping my FO1st subscription.

According to the event status check at 10am cst Sunday weekend double score is locked and we are now onto plastic reclamation..
---
In Other words they hosed us..
---
But they will whine like a little pig. They always do.
---
I’ve been changing my build up to try out bloodied. As far as I’m concerned it’s the only actual build in the game
---
You can't sneak as well in full health builds cause your agi is too low and take more hits. You can't benefit too much from dodgy cause your ap is too low. There's no such thing as serendipity and your stimpack is low in efficiency cause your healthpool is too big with not much of damage mitigation. Of course, if you are a no brainer that don't sneak, don't use stimpacks, take every single hits without sneaking, you might be tankier as full health build but if you are more of a veteran player, you won't see too much of a difference
---
I bought this armor the first time around and submitted a ticket for this very reason. They refunded the atoms without any fuss.
---
This is the reason I don't go for those sets. Even in the coming daily ops I can't see myself trading to get decent sets for mutants and robots. Also changing them every time would be a complete pita.
---
In my view if your gear is not enough to be good in every scenario,it's useless.
---
And any gains you have made can be nerfed to hell if they are even slightly an advantage so may not be worth working towards anyway.
---
Ya. I have a bloodied 2* one to give away. Level 10. I last gave away a 3* instigating hunting rifle of level 1. Hope that player pass it on after he/she upgrades... n not scrip it
---
Totally.
---
That sounds kinda cool, I'd probably carry it around as a back up back up back up shotgun (i carry around 5) just to play around with.
---
Its probably worth a few caps! Itd be more awesome if it were a combat shottie as di7vle barrelled are slowww to reload, no good if you're getting swarmed by ghouls.
---
Goodluck with the flamer, even normal lvl 75 ghouls on PTS now have 400 in cold, fire, poison resists, they don't on live.
---
I did this months ago and it feels great. The constant downward spiral this game is in feels unrecoverable at this point.
---
A good perk card set up helps. Blocker x3 is awesome against charging ghouls. Super Mutants are no problem, except for miniguns, which kill everyone anyway.
---
Since the Queen and Encryptid are the end-game bosses right now, my armor sets work wonders.
---
Nice! I did this with some high level who griefed my level 50 at a workshop. I put on my stealth suit, hid in the bushes, and waited him out until he got bored (since as long as I was there, he couldn’t finish contesting.)
---
k
---
U should also advise your region n time of play. This way u can easily get a gaming friend. I met mine from the same country n i have been helping him with upgrading his gears
---
I never said that. more hp does make you live longer, obviously. so does spamming stims. but that's not the point here.
---
the point is that not all the hp in the game would change the amount of incoming damage. that's the definition of being tanky.
---
people say bloodied is just as tanky as a full health build, I could record the same clip with a full health build and I bet you I wouldn't die in 5 seconds flat. even if I was just standing there.
---
not to mention any build can make use of more hp. it's not something exclusive to bloodied builds.
---
Well damn
---
Can we have your stuff?
---
I don’t know if it’s vats-only, I tried different shotguns outside vats and they work equally well as long as you’re within melee distance to the target.
---
Nice one
---
If only trip wires could auto-rearm
---
He's doing it at a public workshop where people like you can come and snatch it.
---
He didn't do It in his camp with locks.
---
Basically he offered a service to the entire server.I don't see anything to report.
---
4k....
---
I played as rifleman that didn't actually like sneaking, and it was not fun. Felt too weak, and useless at any stronger enemy, despite nice legendary rifle and full perk cards. Switched around lv 90 to bloodied weapon with Unyielding armor set and started to have actual fast progress, with much easier and successful grind in anything I wanted, xp included.
---
So, in the end I had to adapt to a build I didn't actually wanted, and think that's a shame.
---
 Do I want bloodied builds to be weaker? Off course not. I want legendary effects on other builds to mean something. I want Nocturnal to be king at night, I want Mutant to be strong as Junkies, when having several mutations ( maybe making mutations stronger while having full armor set ) , I want Ghoul slayer evolve to Cryptid and creature slaying prefix, so it makes difference when dealing with those, Vampire to heal more hp while slowing enemies  etc... 
---
Variety is the key, and having more options can make players actually have fun with discovering many ways to survive and excel in harsh Wasteland.
---
As far as I see, the damage calculation is changed fir all, legacy weapons included, BUT, the explospive effect still does 100% damage, not 20%, like the ballistic versions. So yes, they are a tiny bit nerfed and no, they are not fixed. I have a JE gatling plasma, but I almost never use it, it makes the way too easy game even more easier, it is pointless.
---
The best thing to do is look at what you can put in the same perk category (IE perception) so you don’t have to constantly move special points around. Shotguns for example are a Strength based weapon whereas rifles are perception based.
---
Same! This happened to me last night before bed and I was just about to log in and try it again. Probably waited 30-40 mins on one loading screen before force quitting the game.

Me and my wife did this to a guy who was doing the same thing, trying to take all the workshops and destroy whatever was there if you had built it up.
---
I went and started to claim the airport, which is nice and big, and hid inside a container. He literally couldn't find me. Searched for a good 20 minutes. I was on Steam voice chat with my friends laughing my ass off because I could hear him shooting off fatmans and stuff trying to get me to come out, just getting more and more frustrated. My wife then went and took Lakeside cabins from him. He didn't know what to do, eventually he went there and the airport was claimed by me. So I went to Tyler County Dirt Track, hid up real close to the fairgrounds in the cars, and did the same thing. Dude was so pissed, started talking trash in voice chat, trying to taunt us out of hiding. It was just hilarious, we were laughing so hard.
---
I recommend this course of action to anyone who experiences workshop griefers. It really foils their plans when their only goal is to destroy and grief, and is endlessly entertaining.
---
Nah you just need to wait until it changes to the guts pile. It takes like 10 minutes or less or is on a body count bc killing a bunch of enemies in one area they switch faster. The guts pile may not be where the enemy died but itll be there most the time. You can leave and come back and itll still be there.
---
Oh it doesn't have a junk node though, do you still want the location or do you require the junk miner
---
Fair dinkum! One satisfied customer already, who is next?
---
Yeah I really want a junk node, sorry...
---
Whatever happened to playing games for fun? Thanks alot monetization.
---
Actually, the biggest help would be to kit out some lower level players.
---
So in the runs that they have to be killed by melee, is it the weapon I fired at with them? How does that work if you dont mind explaining.
---
Dude, people ask for skins for random guns and other minutiae all the time. If it’s “just a skirt,” you can “just” scroll on by and not be a dick.

Paying $100 a year for the scrap box which should be included in the base game is way too unreasonable in my opinion. I have trouble understanding why so many people are willing to pay that. I get that there's other bonuses like the tent and atoms, etc. but unless you were already the kind of person blowing money on atoms beforehand, it just doesn't make any sense.
---
I see so many people talk about FO1st subscriptions exclusively to use the scrap box and that just boggles my mind. Why would you want to reward Bethesda for creating a broken storage system just to exploit users who get too fed up with the massive inconvenience? I hate the limitations on the stash box but the frustration I experience just fuels my resentment towards Bethesda rather than fueling their greed.
---
That seems drastic for gameplay that is still in testing.
---
I'd be fine with a weekly limit instead of a daily. Doesn't seem like it would hurt anything.
---
Just like your comment is irrelevant to mine
---
The whine on this is incredible. Just fucking adapt.  Don’t spawn on top of the safe and get a grenade before going in there. Problem solved. Camp the campers.
---
No problem, saved me the trip asking lol
---
A 90% reduced weight shovel is gold for that quest...
---
Well before a certain update bloodied was truly immortal due to hp rubber banding back with hp increasing buffs. 
---
I’m pretty sure those people were talking about that.
---
I mean: 
---
-my boyfriend said I should make friends to play with
---
-he uses reddit, because duh
---
-lots of people who play fo76 use reddit 
---
-use reddit to make friends to play with and nothing else because what else would I use it for?
---
-get accused of??? Trying to bait people to do... something?
---
QE 15 db shotgun is a joy to run
---
I alternate shotgun and stealth, and don’t stress about twinking my build. It’s all good! You might just be a Filthy Casual. :)
---
I felt the same, bought off the last 29 levels, feels better without it to be honest...
---
Not saying I don't have bunch of em. I got one of everything. I wouldn't want them nerfed cause I traded a lot to get these weapons but I know what's better for the game. Legacies gotta go.
---
I mean if we're gonna be that whiny about it I might as well put my two cents here.
---
Nobody is supposed to be a God at level 400. "Everyones the same at level 50". And if that's the case then yes, it should take everyone at least a few bullets to kill a level 60 super mutant warlord.
---
Or if people weren't begging to scrap cards at all. I was happily working on getting one card of each rank for maximum build versatility until the scrapping feature was revealed. Personally I feel we should just be able to buy legendary perks with banked level ups and leave our card collection alone all together.
---
Most people will tell you that because of dupe they are worthless and blablablaaaaa.
---
By that reasoning,then nothing is worth more than 1 cap,since everything has been duped sooner or later.
---
Fact is you still need to drop it from those presents,and I don't really see this massive abundance of people selling it. So sell it at the price you think it's right and see what you get.
---
Then why wouldn’t the plasma scattergun count? That’s a small group of projectiles.
---
If that was the case, the scrap boxes would also affect the server stability.
---
How fucking entitled are you? 
---
“Actually play the game for 15 minutes: no”
---
Ever thought that these dailies are meant fir people that actually ENJOY NW and play the mode every day?
---
Next we should donate nothing and see if Bethesda lowers the goal to 0
---
it is time you should focus on your life and family more than in a video game boomer
---
Eh if he's doing it at a workshop I don't see the big deal? Anyone can come take it over...
---
Now at his camp however, go full ham. But you just did everyone on that server a disservice.
---
I will edit my post now thank you

Here’s a nice video that shows the season 2 rewards and game board and stuff
---
True, that's actually a valid point.. Although he had locks, but that doesnt matter when walls crumble around you.
---
I never had a Fallout 1st subscription and I also quit playing a couple months ago. Seems it was the perfect time to do so. This grind sounds awful.
---
&gt;You can't sneak as well in full health builds
---
chameleon is sneakier than 50 agility. and 22 (15+4+3) agi is enough to move around in most scenarios. you don't need 37 agi to sneak well. you don't even need a full chameleon set, the CSS is about as good as a full unyielding set.
---
&gt;You can't benefit too much from dodgy
---
neither can I, as you can see in the video. downed in 5 seconds flat *with* dodgy.
---
&gt;There's no such thing as serendipity
---
same as the above.
---
&gt;It all comes down to player skills
---
perhaps, but you're still missing the point of this topic: bloodied builds are **not** tanky.
---
-none of the things you mentioned saved me in that clip
---
-I could record the same build as a full health build and last a lot longer
---
do you understand what these two sentences prove?
---
lol those who earned their strangler PA through countless vault 94 grinds also thought they had ‘sense of accomplishment’, then as usual Bethesda nerfed it. I told my buddies not to grind for it because one day Bethesda will make it worthless and drop the plans in loots. Even better they simply put it up with a gold price tag so you don’t even need to deal with RNG. Never grind for anything, Bethesda will ALWAYS nerf them and make them available to casual players. Only play the game when you enjoy the playing part of it (which is what I’ve been doing).
---
Yeah I agree. But i guess it's just another symptom of the same problem - prolonging the grind to create the *illusion* of content.
---
The most enjoyable patch in any game I've encountered was v1.10 in Diablo 2. *Everything* was nerfed sooooo hard that most main characters just became mules, and on top of that All enemies were strengthened so much that they could 1-hit most players with the old "builds". But they encouraged in-depth builds and creativity by implementing synergies between skills. The buff was the cost of adding a whole world of depth and theorycrafting to the game. You could sit there for hours with a calculator trying to match things up to come up with a new build.
---
A nerf with no payoff is like shrinking characters down to 10% and saying they made the world 10x bigger - it's exactly the same, it just takes 10x longer to get anywhere.
---
Or maybe have it based on cards you own without destroying them where if you own every card at every rank you are 'done' and can max all your legendary cards.  That would actually be an interesting progression system that would reward you for taking cards that you might not think are good.  Once you have them you are more likely to toss them on to give them a try.
---
I will quit if this goes live
---
Trust me when I say this - enjoy the confusion and excitement. The more exciting times I had playing this game was when I first started it and was panicking about being mobbed by gangs of charred ghouls at white springs when I was a low level. 
---
Once you hit level 80-100 things start to become repetitive and then you’ll join our club of demanding more from Bethesda :)

It’s not a service I chase these guys down with 10-15 in public workshops once built there you cannot scrap move it or anything it screw the workshop for the server it is not a service it’s cheating and Bethesda doesn’t care don’t waste time reporting I have been they lost all faith when they gave caught duper’s there accounts back without so much as an item wipe
---
perhaps some people were. but the quote I quoted in the op is from a day ago.
---
so clearly some people still think bloodied is just as tanky as full health builds.
---
I have a full mutants build, including armor, I know vanguard's is better, but it's for the role playing.
---
I just had this issue yesterday and aldo another time in the past. Always with the same gun,when I applied a skin or a prime mod.
---
What I did both times was to clear all your favourite wheel,and then stash all your carried guns. Usually the next day it fixed by itself. 
---
Obviously your results may vary.
---
It was locked up good with rank 3 locks, so it wasnt exactly free for all for everybody
---
I don't use bloody or junkie. Try just having fun. Yea you'll be out everythingd by those builds but in pve what does it matter. 
---
My build is this
---
Get all Mutations (except herbivore cause carn and herb don't stack) 
---
Get power fist
---
There
---
That's the build.
---
Destiny 1 after the The Taken King was released.  That is the best answer.
---
I don't know what legendary perks are but I'm going to not look into it and enjoy 76 xD
---
Oh god is it really bad? I’ll probably quit if it’s gonna be like the division or destiny bullet sponges. Shooting somthing 5 million times isn’t fun for me
---
I haven't seen the Vault Tec "Mad Scientist" outfit in the shop for a while. It also comes with mad scientist goggles. As for the junkyard ones I should note they are inside of the boat to the left as you enter it in a box on the ground
---
Was fo76builds taken?
---
This is just true and I really don't like the development, I don't see why so many people think it just flattens out damage for all builds, it really does not just do that, it flattens damage in a way where most builds are essentially pointless damage wise.
---
We get perk card packs, so in a sense they already are.
---
There are gigantic irradiated bats that terrorize the landscape using sonic attacks and controlling hordes of mindless zombies. There are glowing mole rats that carry Fancy Hairbrushes for some reason. There are JET PACKS.
---
...I think they can allow women to wear pants.
---
Why do I get the feeling that any answer I give is going to be wrong in your eyes? Maybe because of how confrontational your comment seems?
---
No. The locks tell me it wasn’t as a public device. They did it at a workshop so that it wasn’t permanently at their base and so that they had a bigger budget to put down more factories.
---
Hopefully that means we’ll see it return soon!
---
Well then their wrong and still stuck in the past. 
---
There is a PA mod that reducing damage received by 50% while low hp. There’s that as well. 
---
So their right in some way if you include PA.
---
No it's not lol
---
It’s still a nuisance. Either he has to repair everything or he has to leave the server.
---
Honestly, I had soooo much fun with Deatiny 1. I couldn't find the same level of engagement with D2,but I still had some fun with it.
---
Wanderer is the harder one to get. She’s a rare companion with no set spawn
---
If you are one of those people that take every single hits, don't use stimpacks, literally don't even try and all you do is pray to god that you somehow magically survive without doing anything, full health is the way to go. If you use stimpacks if something hits you, you will fare just as nicely as a low health build
---
They should put a Stealth Suit color bundle in the Atomic shop so we can watch people running around in groups like Power Rangers.
---
indeed. but I said that in the op. EP PA is the only way to be tanky as a bloodied build, but then you lose legendary armor.
---
a lot of bloodied critics say that unyielding and serendipity make you as tanky as full health builds. which is bs.
---
The part where he tried to get you to follow his youtube was the most insidious part.
---
So did we get that reward or not, I honestly can't tell.
---
What titan said lol. It just nice to have all of them
---
My first experience was back when griefing was still a thing, i built my camp right outside of flatwoods, and the next thing I knew, a marsupial guy using a stealthboy starts launching mirvs at my base out of a minigun
---
Hey were all shotgun bros! I got a 2* bloodied combat shotgun with +33% vats. I wonder how devastating it'd be if we all grouped up an shotgunned everything together lol.
---
Except DE had been talking melee and damage 3.0 for years, and had several dev workshops discussing and showcasing the changes. They showed how and why things were changing with hard data, they dedicated entire devstreams to the topic, and in the end the roll out was over time, not all at once and with plenty of warning. They also didn't just outright nerf player damage, just changed the ways it could be achieved, while still putting a stop to the constant power creep. They knew and Steve said many times that nerfing players was never their intention, but instead to make sure multiple weapons and archetypes are viable.
---
They also ended the enemy armor scale that gave them ridiculous amount of damage resistance and basically required armor stripping.  Very different to Bethesda's current approach.
---
Better yet: the ability to log in online and see all the pictures. All photos are stored online and when you need to delete a picture in game, you’re given the option to keep it stored online.
---
All I want is a definitive method by the time they release them. 
---
I don't want to use 400 cards for 2 coins,and then a month later discover they upped scrapping to 5 coins each.
---
you still don't understand. holy \*. the point is that you *can* do that as a full health build, but you *cannot* do that as a bloodied build. as you yourself just admitted.
---
you know what that proves? that bloodied builds are not as tanky as full health ones.
---
I did the same, played bloody switched to full health. Played melee switched to rifles. Etc. now I’m being punished for experimenting and trying new things. Which is the opposite of e we hat game designers want, they should encourage experimentation and trying new things.
---
Are you on xbox?  I’m overflowing with camp plans and will be dropping them today.
---
Yeah, I'm glad I hung onto my 2 shot Cryolator, it's a handy thing for SBQ, I'm hoping for the Colossal Event too!
---
Serendipity is just RNG so them saying that is wrong.
---
In for the bucket hammer or whatever the hell that is.
---
There should be an option if you receive a lower level legendary weapon or armor piece, you take it to the purveyor you have to option to spend scrip to "level up" the weapon, like it's level 35? No problem, 250 scrip to upgrade it to level 50.
---
Everything would die lol 😆  got a few bloodied combat shogun double barrels the lot.
---
I have a medics, FFR, fr. With the magic effect and the trail firework reload bug it's comical how quick it reloads, also I always have a vats crit. Medic is bugged.
---
I'm still pissed that they cleared all the photos taken before the Wastelanders DLC. 😭
---
I found it, your directions were perfect.
---
Just my ten cents on this matter. I went from one shotting lvl 68 mutatns to 2 shotting level 100 super mutants and scorched. I am low health, instigating crossbow wielding ranger.
---
I wouldn't have much issue with nerfs if they brought everything else up to a reasonable level, but instead their overall nerfs made the crappy stuff even crappier and made the good stuff, less good but still the preferred way to go.
---
They sound like a lot of fun to me..
---
98% of the issues on previous patches were reported and they didn’t do anything about them.  They even stated that they need to get better at it, which I highly doubt they will.
---
I believe because how it was coded in FO4 how shotguns were lumped in with rifles and automatic rifles. So while yes putting a splitter makes it a shotgun they didn't recode it for 76.
---
Lmao food builds everywhere
---
Nerfing is by far the laziest approach by game developers. Instead of making new content they just make same old content harder and more of a chore.
---
I absolutely do. I got the gauss because... well.. gauss shotgun. Barely ever use it. I love my bloody faster reload double barrel. The fancy pump is my GOAT, so I really only swap between it and the double barrel. I save the combat shotgun for sneaky time since you can’t outfit the fancy or double with suppressors.
---
Wait... you think they are intentionally “shifting on old players”... to make room for newer players?
---
What? Lol.
---
Yea.... I'm getting kinda tired of this, they start messing with stuff no ones asking for but dont touch the actual issues with the game. They still want our monthly payments for 1st while making the game less enjoyable like how in the hell does that make sense
---
Glad to hear, enjoy the ownership of that little nightmare 🤣🤣🤣
---
Stack Shack builder here and I love your build! Perfectly scrappy, and the new Blood Eagle prefab works wonders here!
---
Problem is, if you "bring everything up" then everything will be practically a one shot. Bloodied was never intended to be a constant build.
---
damage should have been nerfed a long long time ago.
---
I totally agree.  I bought D2 at release under the assumption that it would start where D1 ended in terms of game design and content quality.  Boy was that a bad assumption.  Turns out Bungie has two entirely different teams - one for development and one for sustaining.  The sustaining team is clearly more competent as shown by their work with Taken King in D1 (bringing that game out of the ashes) and everything they’ve done with D2 (to make it semi-playable).
---
They had spike traps hidden at their vender to kill people trying to buy things so they can loot the corpse after.
---
I think it's bullshit. I'm a sneak build. Why bother having stealth if they're just gonna pull this shit?
---
Game launch, no account- wide bank to share items between characters, plans/recipes are also character bound so not many reasons to lvl an alt.
---
Wastelanders launch, faction and bullion grind are character bound, so now there is even less reason to lvl an alt.
---
One Appalachia? launch, while perk slots are account wide unlockables, the perk coins needed to lvl up those cards are not, so this new grind which is probably longer than all the others before combined is also not account wide.
---
Idk why we even have more than 1 character slot these days, each feature that Bethesda releases seems to make the game more and more alt unfriendly, which is weird since most online games do the exact opposite because more alts=more time playing=more money spent in the game.
---
Is it really this hard to give away script?
---
Bethesda said you can play SOLO or multiplayer. Please shut the fuck because you clearly can't understand anything about people just wanting to play a game franchise they've been in longer than you have 🤣🤣
---
 We can take down a sheepsquatch in a matter of seconds! 😤😤😤
---
Why? Are you fighting players in Adventure mode? You do realize that people can still one-shot your legendary boss during the uranium fever with NON-legendary weapons, right ?
---
Awesome, thanks for sharing!
---
Im on XBone too, and I always have time for a hello/salute!
---
I struggle enough with my heavy gun build but rather be full health than a bloodied build, I'm just tired of everyone praising the bloodied builds thinking they're king shit cause they do x amount of damage. Thanks but no thanks
---
Cycling light?
---
In this case I think the nerfs are what the game needed though 
---
The damage perks are wayy too powerful to the point where it harms the game, there aren't any memorable fights, things die in 2 seconds 
---
Even fallout 4 on easy mode has enemies that are more hardy than fallout 76 right now
---
The thinking behind all these nerfing is to keep users in the game as long as possible. They figured if it takes more bullets to kill something, players spend more time fighting and more time looking for lead and gunpowder. Dumbest logic ever. If people enjoy playing it they will spend more time in it, if people got sick and tired of looking for scrap, then after a long hard fight receive a one-star nocturnal lead pipe from the scrip beast queen, they stop playing FO76 and play more enjoyable games. A very shitty move but they don’t have cheaper solutions.
---
Or.. and hear me out, I know it sounds crazy, how about just award x legendary perk coins per level up post 50.  Call it 5.  
---
Then give us something else to do with perk cards we don't need.  Even just flat out destroy them is fine.
---
All that pointless tedium is why I'm hardly logging in anymore.  It's worse then my job 😐
---
Isn't it clear at this point that they test nothing
---
I use a heavy gun build and their all mutants, Furious, or executioners and it works fine. I'm not really worried about the meta.
---
Damn I want this now. I’ve been dreaming about a heavy gun that fired shotgun shells for while...
---
Bethesda bethesda'd it.
---
They said you can play solo. Not that you have access to 100% content while solo. Highly doubt that you have played the franchise longer than I have, even doubt you have half as many hours into this one than I do. 
---
So go crawl under your solitary rock and cry me a river.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxmYafhEsZU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxmYafhEsZU)  just watch this video and see how low health builds fare against npcs. His build is not perfect he's missing dodgy and has shit gear but it does its job. Inject a stimpak then you benefit 5 times more cause your healthpool is 1/5 of a full health build. You record that clip of yours and send it over my way. I might be able to tell you a thing or two about tanking some damage
---
Good reminder.
---
People need to grow up a bit.
---
Everything in so childish about the PTS, it's kind of astonishing...

Thats why I said, it should be on a daily rotation, or in a random pool, like the other mutations (like the one where you have to kill the enemy with melee hit (you can damage it down to 1HP with gunfire, but you have to melee it down, bash damage works)).
---
It's a literal public workshop, it's available to any player willing to take it...
---
I’m confused what’s wrong with ammo factory’s are they hacked I have seen a lot of these even on PS4 so what’s the deal
---
I got a message last night from someone that said I had a nice camp. I was so happy, and I still am. I put a lot of work into it, damnit! Feels good to have it noticed!
---
Personally I use a gatling gun along with my .50 rifle on my stealth rifleman build. Its decently powerful in situations where i cant 1 shot enemies while in stealth but also more economical than a handmade.
---
Well, might as well enjoy the rewards I can get and not sweat 100 then. Thanks :)
---
Went and found the mining helmet just to switch to that headlamp. It's awesome.
---
I was going month to month for a while there before I took the plunge on $100. For me, it's not just the Scrapbox, although that alone is worth it to me. It's also being able to create my own private version of the world, where I do not have to be annoyed by the occasional idiot or by someone wanting to grief me as I try to claim and defend workshops. There have been many times on public servers where I go to farm a place like the asylum and everything is already dead and all the good, visible loot has been taken. I don't know if you've looked into it, but game servers can be quite expensive to run, especially if you are using AWS or the like for hosting. Considering how much I play, I don't see how they can pay for my server time and data usage, even with my $8 a month.

I recommend joining the discord too, if it goes down you'll know why and the devs are on there, good people.
---
I accidentally fell off one of the monorail stations last week, and "died" on the way down. So my loot bag was up in the sky somewhere instead of being on the ground like you'd expect... Always happens to me when I've got a full load of junk I didn't really want to lose, haha
---
There is some good camp items to look forward too I’m glad about that. The brotherhood hut thing is cool
---
I wear a suit of underarmor that my Wasteland Savior made for me almost 50 levels ago. I just can't bring myself to take it off.
---
It shouldn't be there at all,  in my opinion. They don't want everyone using tge same build but then they turn around and force us all to play the same way. My buiod is going to be useless.
---
Growing up in the 40s, 50s, and US military in the 60s, I have an ingrained aversion to radiation. I have played the FO series since 3 and have not been able to shake that aversion. Up until 76 I would constantly be taking Radaway to get rid of that red bar.
---
Since 76, which I play a lot, I have become a bit more tolerant of accepting some radiation, however, I use Sunkissed a lot to keep it under control. So, like you, I just tool around without all that radiation and kill or be killed accordingly.
---
If you don't want it on power armor that's a perfect alternative. Just .1 pounds of weight for a lifetime of humor!
---
Oh yeah. That makes sense. I was doing some testing and was getting 50%, but I evidently derped and wasn't testing with Strange in Numbers. With that, it's probably 62.5% at or below 20% health.
---
This^ it's just closing the damage gap between normal weapons and the builds that go all in on damage 
---
The game is still fully playable even without any damage perks, it's just making the min max builds less rediculous, which is what they are
---
I'd honestly advise anyone whos finished the board to take a break from the game, even if just a few days. Especially before Meat Week drops. Speaking ffrom my own experience, whenever I don't play the game for a day or two, I somewhat softly reset my own personal expectations of myself in game, and it becomes a whole lot less stressful.
---
Oh, there's definitely a plot.
---
From what I've seen people are saying a bloodied build CAN be as tanky as a full health build. Which is an entirely true statement.
---
Yea exactly, damage is so rediculous that this is possible even after these nerfs 
---
So why does it bother you lol
---
Thank you for reading my post. Or rather, not reading, because if you had, you'd see 1) that I did try an alternative build and 2) I was ultimately happy with the whole thing. Thank you for representing all that is Reddit, friend.
---
It’s nice for endgame activities like Scorched Earth and A Colossal Problem where the bosses are super tanky so you don’t end up wasting thousands of rounds.  Usually at Scorched Earth I use up like 2000 5.56 rounds with a Bloodied build and I can only imagine how worse it’ll be with these nerfs if they actually go live in the future.
---
OP directly says “sure beats grinding rep with the same dailies like in WoW” after stating that they love the legendary run. They were talking up the legendary run in opposition to WoWs repetitive dailies, not saying anything about dailies in 76
---
Non PA user unless I need lead then I pull out the Excavator. But you're correct, great humor. Love going down to the Wayward with the low levels at night and watch them lose their shit. Be warned if you do though, you'll get a lot of messages asking where/how.
---
Gamers are just mad so they're just parroting whatever copy and paste complaints they've seen before and hoping something sticks lol
---
I get it. But is my Camp in the forest going to blitzed by level 67 super mutants now? I feel like I have earned the right to take it easy at my camp, that’s why I am in the forest. Even with OP weapons you can still die due to action points.  I still get mobbed by charred ghouls occasionally.
---
Plus, most people I play with will build up the workshops and then leave the extractors unlocked so other players can have the resources if they need them. I only ever lock the extractors I actually *need*  so that other players don't have to take my workshop. Which, now that I have 1st I just do most of my workshops there so I don't have to deal with people
---
T 65 here all we can do is flash a low powered light into someone’s eyes. Then then proceed to call me a simp.
---
Yes. My JunkPlas was ultracite, and I got ultracite cores as a reward part. Not sure on lootable, didn't have time to check, to be honest.
---
What recipe?
---
Because it gives them a better idea where the max can be, less multipliers -&gt; more control over max output -&gt; less of a gap between low and high end dmg -&gt; more reasons to try different builds if you don't lose on 600% dmg through multipliers
---
I think you have to put your veil on
---
Are you wearing the veil of secrets
---
Ditto on the wearing pants.
---
I like the Vault-tec lab coat for my clean lab coat, but they do have Cabot's lab coat laying around so it would be nice to get those for some non-branded outfit.
---
The veil is on
---
Not sure yet, but the one star was a "just have a reward" tier. When I got above that tier, I got a three star. Need to test again today and see if the stars are consistent on the tier reward.
---
I agree with nerfs but this will almost force me to go into a meta build (commando/heavy) to still have fun and not need ages to kill anything, I have played the PTS and it really is bad for the playstyles I like, especially the melee aspects. they can keep the calculation chagne as long as they buff either base damage or preferably damage perk cards
---
They can?!?!!!?! 
---
REVERSE THE NERF! REVERSE THE NERFFFFFFFFFFFFF!
---
And I do not want to run to an enemy and finish it off with a melee hit. So thats 2 mutation out... and others do not want to deal with a 3rd, etc...
---
The mutations have to stay (they are fun, and they make the operation fun), but the anti-sneak should be on a rotation with the others, not stay as a persistent, to be fair.
---
What is a blotched camp?
---
Should be 5 or 10 per card rank minimum and they should introduce a real respec method that doesn't involve leveling to shuffle specials.
---
When you're looking in the lights category, it looks like a basic hanging light bulb, but it has a darker, yellow look to the bulb. If you place in and run a wire to it (it doesn't use area power) it with light up bright red. That is its default color state. If you interact with it, it will start cycling through color combinations. Stop interacting with it when you find the color and brightness you're looking for and it will stay that way.
---
That sounds buggy to me
---
In opposition to the daily grinds for rep that exist in 76 that are similar to WoWs that's what hes saying pointing out the rep grind for 76.
---
You're S.P.E.C.I.A.L!
---
Switching up ammo types is the norm in these games. It's more of a lategame thing in 76 where you can sustain a single type, and even then that can be a challenge for the rarer ones
---
In every fallout game, i enjoy wandering everywhere finding new places. looting, killing things, meeting interesting NPC's etc etc. Although it feels like im not encountering enough enemies/npcs, or maybe i just havent explored enough. I also think that playing with other people ruin the "lonely wasteland" feeling that all the other fallout games gave off.
---
Everyone running to the PTS forum to post about their opinions is a good way to flood it with useless posts. The PTS exists for play testing, the PTS forum exists for people who have play tested on it to post feedback and bug reports. Filling it with opinion posts based on hearsay isn’t going to be helpful. It’s just going to create clutter and actual play testing feedback will get lost in the mix. 
---
If you’re actually playing on the PTS and have feedback, by all means, provide it. If you haven’t, then use the regular forums.
---
People can or used to be able to place ammo factories at their camps
---
5 left
---
That's for the plan.
---
Then a 64 hour quest to get the right ingredients.
---
It’s basically useless in fo4 lol
---
I hope you're just pretending to be dense. because, for the tenth time, this topic isn't about whether you can use skills or what-have-you to survive as a bloodied build. of course you can, you can do that with every build. which in itself invalidates the point you're trying to make, but I digress.
---
the point of this topic is actually quite simple. people say bloodied builds are just as tanky as full health builds. if I recorded the same clip as I did in the op, but with a full health build, would I survive longer?
---
yes, I would. you said so yourself. so what does that prove? that bloodied builds are, in fact, not as tanky as full health builds. because under the exact same conditions, a full health build would survive longer.
---
I honestly don't know how much more I can dilute two simple variables. maybe if I draw I diagram, I dunno. player skill or actual gameplay have no bearing on these two very rudimentary facts.
---
I use about 5\~6 mags with my bloodied fixer when I solo the queen. Even less if I'm lucky
---
If you're married to your kids, yes divorce please
---
Thanks for the links, I didn't know an online game like 76 supported mod, a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one
---
You wanna know the great thing about this setup? Like Elder Scrolls Online, you don't \*have\* to subscribe. You can just play as you normally would. You choose not to pay and that's fine. You don't have the bottomless scrap storage just like players in ESO won't have unlimited crafting mat storage. You don't have a private server nor the outpost tent thing and ESO non-subscribers don't have access to all DLC without buying them outright. Those are incentives added much later to entice some people to help support server costs and ongoing development costs. I am happy to pay it because I receive something tangible for my money.
---
Right!? I just restarted the game with the hopes that it changed something but hasn’t. I’ve gathered the data, &amp; gotten the sword and now just have to return to the terminal but it won’t let me through
---
You can effectively still one hit in PvP with weapons that do just about more than the player damage cap and have a high firerate, it has happened to me before
---
I can’t express how satisfying it is to watch the workshop claim go down from inside a container. It’s the only way I do it now haha
---
o7
---
I sae those. Were they not like actual things? Some dude left his unlocked and I got a metric fuckton of 10mm ammo. I thought it was just something from the Raiders or Settlers I hadn't unlocked yet.
---
Mutations are fine,  but if one completely undoes a build it shouldn't stay. Just my opinions.
---
I doubt it, that probably would’ve been the first thing people brought up. Just because an enemy is level 100 doesn’t mean they drop level 100 stuff.
---
My wife wants a pink skin for this.
---
From what I've seen in a video, the forest is capped at lv 25 enemies.
---
I actually agree with this sentiment and hope that they allow us to buff up our camp defenses 
---
It annoys me that our camp doesn't grow in power like our character does, it makes most of the map uninhabitable
---
The fact legendary run weapon skins work in NW but the armor paint doesn't is incredibly stupid. We have all kinds of cool cosmetics and I've almost never seen anyone wearing ghillie armor in adventure mode. NW is the only place they could get lots of use.
---
If that’s the case, which it could be, he’s still saying that the legendary run is better than the dailies and therefore saying he’s pleased with the direction of new content compared to the previous stuff. Sadly, only OP knows what exactly he meant by that.
---
Dear Beth, I was called a simp today because of my low powered light on my T 65. They preceded to flash their bright head lights flexing on me. I noticed that head lights were not added still. 
---
*Sad face*
---
Beth : huh well get to you later.
---
It's a current bug that gets exploited in pvp, basically making the rounds in the magazine of the chosen weapon register as another one of a higher amount
---
in the op I quoted an user saying unyielding bloodied builds can be just as tanky as full health builds.
---
ignoring sneak, which full health builds can make use of as well, and PA, because unyielding implies no PA, no, that most certainly isn't true.
---
That’s what I assumed, thank you. I didn’t think they’d do that but in a video I watched the guy explicitly mentioned “level 100 drops”, however he may have just meant higher quality loot.
---
Sneak archer FTW
---
That’s super annoying I feel like I ran into some weird moments when going onto all the terminals and such for those quests. Maybe (unfortunately) just complete another mission and let it chill for a bit. There’s a chance you went back right into the same server? I’ve heard of that happening. 
---
It won’t let me fast travel sometimes after selecting the location and I literally have to find something to walk to to kill like 5-10 mins
---
Happened to me once. Take the veil off and then put it back on. It worked for me using the elevator entrance.
---
If only we could all coordinate well enough for that. It would be very interesting.
---
Honestly, that damage boost is not going to make bloody any better than non-bloody build. I'll definitely be rocking the PA Heavy build in my future adventures.
---
Really look it up dick head everyone on YouTube is posting about the bloodied nerf that's coming so instead of leaving a comment how about looking it up before you say shit
---
Yeah that's what he said and I can get behind that but just wanted to point how you can not hide problems with the game to make it seem good but yeah nothing bad with saying X is better than Y.
---
Its so funny how people moan and bitch before wastelanders saying the game was boring and lack luster. Wastelanders comes out and people are happy for a few months. Now people are complaining again lol if you dont like the grind of the legendary run then stop fucking playing and stop posting about how bad the game is, IF ITS SO BAD THEN QUIT PLAYING! Whiney little bitches, go play fortnite with all the other losers.
---
Have it fire a burst of 3 rails per shot.
---
Bloodied usually doesn't use all that many more multipliers, it's essentially two extra, nerd range and bloodied, the adrenal reaction mutation has the same damage effect as junkies would have. What is hit most is melee as each point in strength is nerfed in addition to all perks, buff items and legendary effects.
---
The problem is that the game is totally unbalanced. Weapon base damage and resistances are all over the place, and legendary effects are game breaking.
---
Bringing the damage up makes no sense when people are one shotting everything with some of the weakest weapons in the game. The whole system needs to be rebalanced to something more logical.
---
Pfft. What next? Pants with pockets?!
---
No it won't but there is a scribe outfit without backpack that will show whatever backpack your wearing. Believe it's the brotherhood scribe outfit.
---
I suspect this is why you’re not allowed to claim any rewards on the PTS - they know they’re broken lol
---
Also while buffering the enemies they should buff the rewards. There are a multitude of old tired events out there that people rarely do even though they are easy.  Even less people will do them if they have to commit more bullets to the same old meager rewards.
---
Why you leaving out individual skills? It's absolutely unrealistic cause there's no way a player's gonna just sit there and let the npc hit him to death. Let's say you are playing WoW and are trying to figure out which is a better tank. Would you test it without having tankers use their defensive skills and cooldowns? I mean really?
---
Maybe enemies in general are not that bad, maybe if they are over level 75. The worst part are Daily Ops, enemies there can take a lot of hits, and when they have stealth modifier, you need to spray an pray sometimes. Sure, enemies drop ammo you are using in Daily Ops, but sometimes you don't have time to loot it if you want to go fast.
---
No but i wouldnt mind a level cap increase on gear. Though I'm probably in the minority there. Maybe if they added a way to level up our current gear using special materials or something.
---
For me this is the biggest middle finger as well. The only end game since release, was trying different builds. Got a good shotgun roll, switch cards and perks to shot gunner. Got a junkies bone hammer, switch it around to try that out. Now I’m getting punished and losing out for attempting to make this game enjoyable despite the efforts of Bethesda. They are killing their own game. As time marches on, it’s harder to draw in more players with all the bad publicity and keep the ones you have, especially when you slap players who continue to play.
---
This is when having a jet pack becomes extraordinarily useful
---
Yeah, the people thinking that you can get 3 lunchboxes for a 100 gold are going to be disappointed.
---
It runs at 0 FPS if you’re looking directly at it. It’s a guaranteed CTD for me.
---
North of hillybilly hotdogs... hillfolk hotdogs... whatever it’s called on the east side of the map along the river bank you’ll find a junk extractor on the beach. Super close to water, junk, radiation barrels nearby if you want to go bloody, plenty of land for crops. Low level enemies spawn nearby so maybe one or two turrets to handle them while you relax on the shore. The only problem with the spot is that it’s super popular. So your camp may not spawn in all the time.
---
I personally would not call it piss poor, leaving that rating for the inevitable bugs. But all in all, it's not something I am excited about (aside from the Ammo Crafting one, which is fucking glorious, but the rest is mediocre shit)
---
Any bloodied?
---
Where you got that drama degree from?
---
I agree with the scaling. Look at things like destiny 2 or the division 2, they have ever changing level gaps but ways to upgrade your gear. I wouldn’t even be mad if bethesda did that, just as long as we have a way to keep our god rolls lmao
---
my teammates always give me grief for not running bloodied too, I'm about to start charging them for the stimpacks I use reviving them, hehe.
---
stealth rifle build, as it turns out, is fantastic for the wendigo colossus event.
---
U want to try to get all ur gear at lvl 100 again?
---
I run into at least five players using hacked (injected) weapons a week on pc, at a minimum. Sometimes I see multiples at a single event.
---
It is absolutely not an exaggeration.
---
I wonder what’ll happen if I buy another copy of Skyrim. 🤔
---
You can not please everyone. As I said, I am a heavy gunner, so I do not want to bash the enemy, but I am forced to do it (and this undo all and every ranged build, we are ranged for a reason). This mutation is on a rotation, so I dont have to deal with it in every single time. This is good.
---
The keen eye mutation is a permanent one and you have to deal with it every time. This is bad. Not the mutation existance, it would be manageable even by you if it would be on a rotation (like skip that day, or trying out a different style for a bit, or just forget about stealth for 8 minutes run).
---
nah there is no wrong answer lol, anybody who wants to debate your answer can waste their time, I just want to know
---
Me too. I plan on going Charisma (maybe level another char, I don't know yet, I got a lot of respec available) for group runs. I already carry friendly fire nonstop anyhow, why not?
---
Yep break down legendaries for legendary screws and steel to upgrade our weapons. Id be down for that.
---
One of my main is a bloodied rifle/commando. I usually run a lever or a fixer. My backup weapon is a bloodied 50cal modified hunter sniper. Ammo cheap hits like a truck its a good clean up solo weapon. 
---
Also I use a bloodied unarmed with Unyielding the damage is very good.
---
Honesty I wouldn’t mind if the recoil made you stagger just for some immersion.
---
It's where I get my most damage... Taking it away makes me much, much weaker..
---
It's really far west, making it a bad spot to save caps on fast travel, which is the whole reason I want to be in the east of the map. It sounds like a very good spot though!
---
Yes I got that one a week ago and it is awesome. I prefer the larger backpacks on the field scribe though and wanted to check before I try to farm it.
---
Depends. Heavy weapons and auto rifles can sometime get a fair bit of their ammo back
---
Where’s this elevator entrance you speak of
---
Or hell even make them rare drops as part of the new daily ops, that’d definitely get people playing
---
Datamining, it cheats everyone actually playing the game out of the chance of doing this in any significant way.
---
This thread and your reply are evidence of that
---
why does the possibility of players being able to do high damage (and, i would guess, feel powerful after hours or playing this game and progression) bother you? why wouldn’t they just buff enemy health for higher level players?
---
Thats the right attitude man. Better than all these other people crying over it.
---
Not a good thing cause that would mean we would have to start farming for things all over again. Used to think we would need higher level items to get rid of all those duped items but seeing Bethesda is unable to stop dupes for the foreseeable future, I changed my mind
---
Pepperoni Roll.
---
because it's just a test. that's how tests are conducted. if I accounted for player skill as well, that's another million variables to consider. in that very basic scenario, would a full health build survive longer? yes, it would. a lot longer. that means bloodied builds are not as tanky.
---
and on top of that, you're also ignoring the fact 'player skill' is not exclusive to bloodied builds. unyielding is. the ability to spam stims isn't. similarly to sneak, skill can be used to improve literally any build. so it has no bearing on bloodied specifically.
---
Says the person who said "*God is it so hard? Stop fucking crying. The only time they add a  challenge people cries because they are cheating. That is the point  assholes*" despite having nothing to do with my writeup because you didn't even read the whole thing before you jumped down here to bitch as only a Reddit Warrior can. Forgive me for not putting much value on your opinion in that regard.
---
This is a prelude to future improvements.
---
Additive is much easier to work with. I can see them adjusting things like this in time since this is just a pts.
---
It would be interesting experiment...
---
Agreed; I personally love the game, think it’s pretty good now compared to what it started as, and think it has HUGE potential... if Bethesda gets its shit somewhat together. There are still major problems with the game, and often new problems come up more than old ones are fixed. Certain things definitely need to change, but I don’t think that makes the game trash. Like it’s been pointed out before, no game is perfect or worthless, but they all fall somewhere on a scale with those extremes.
---
Like after playing the PTS with my former unarmed character I didn't mind the mutants much, the robots and other creatures were a problem (mirelurk kings, anglers, gulpers), some ghouls needing 4-5 hits (bloated glowing I think) when you are being swarmed is no fun as a melee build, it feels like I need to switch to ranged weapons to "adapt" but that just takes away the playstyle I had come to love. And the damage perk cards just feel like they don't do anything now.
---
I think this change can be good if they buff the percentages on perk cards to 30% for all the 20% ones back to 100% for explosives and get unarmed up to 30-40% as well. Another thing worth thinking about is maybe making strength more significant again, maybe just making it so each point gives 6% instead of 5% as it is now, it would be more than the PTS has but still a lot less than live and much more predictable.
---
what
---
Lol I love that. Ghouls 1 shot me when I run my bloodied. Mirelurk kings 1 shot me. Level 52 BS gutsys 1 -2 shot me. Yeah I'm so tanky.
---
Super popular is an understatement, I’ve camped in that spot since launch and am used to having to server hop 3+ times every login lol
---
For sale yes
---
Collecting cloth and wood non stop sucks, but I need that in my life.
---
Sure they can totally do that, the difference really wouldn't be noticeable between that and what they're doing now
---
That’s true, it shouldn’t be an option you use because you have to. I see it as very viable now, more than ranged weapons, (I’m not bloodied or junkies but that should be nominal between melee and ranged.) There are some great perks for melee such as ninja, fireproof, blocker, incisor, martial artist, iron fist, and some others. The only time I really have no incentive to use melee is for SBQ or colossus and when I’m on a team. When I’m on a team it takes a bit to sprint to the enemy and tag it. I’m hoping the one wasteland will give me more time to tag an enemy based on my play style.
---
I believe in you.
---
U should use the one that makes she has 25% DR less, and sorry I don’t know if it works on the queen :(
---
Yep. Feather your jumps so you avoid reaching 76's equivalent of terminal velocity, and you're good.
---
Fair enough I guess, I wouldn't consider Destiny a good game, I'd say Division 1 has good end game content, so yeah
---
I started a new character who is never going to use any legendary gear at all.
---
Once you are geared up theres nothing left to make it feel like you are gettimg stronger. A lot of games fix that by increasing level caps. So they need to do that or release 4 or 5 star legendaries.
---
That it does, endangerol syringe as well.
---
I love how the bloodied gang is downvoting everything people say at this point
---
Cloth bud, donate cloth. Need that collectron. Get all the toilet paper and prewar money you can for it.
---
Skyrim belongs to the Nords.
---
I would report that player and block it. And I always do. Bethesda wont give a shit, but still.
---
Sadly, the wont ban cheaters, they never did.
---
And fun fact, you can use your terminal to quickly change all cycling light color and brightness at once if you want them all the same.
---
HMMMMMMMMMMMMM weird
---
It's about balance. You want to be a bush wookie, you have to do so with no damage and energy resistance.
---
The pulowski shelters outside the mansion serve as secret elevators into the hub.
---
Also did some damage testing. I was using my [bloodied commando](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f435ce&amp;d=ic1a02lt2pp2ao0lu2l71eu0la2ir2sg2eh2ar2a51an2pg2ph2pi2p02lk2cu2&amp;m=051c29e87b&amp;am=18-18-18-18-18&amp;wp=w6&amp;wm=142835) build with BE Handmade. Here are numbers from inventory:
---
no weapon damage perks: 167
---
3x rank 1 commando perks: 186 (217 with full rank 3 adrenaline buff)
---
3x rank 3 commando perks: 206
---
Ghouls at Whitespring (levels 50-75) died in 3-4 torso hits, when normally they'd die in max 2.
---
I agree somewhat. They need to redo most if not all weapons in the game in terms of damage, armor penetration and such stuff but I totally think they need to bring up damage on a bunch of guns.
---
To me it doesn't make sense how a missile can not kill an enemy when it should be able to blast enemies away and same goes for the fat man. A goddamn nuke can not kill an enemy when it should easily be able to do tons of damage probably close to 1k or 2k damage. And yes the legendaries are game breaking yes. Legendary effects should not transor a weapon into a mass destruction tool but should up the damage somewhat and along with that non legendary weapons should be able to kill enemies without trouble like it's a weapon it should be able to kill easily but instead you end up wasting so much ammo on one enemy. I honestly believe they should decrease all damage resistance for both players and mobs, buff all weapons, nerf and buff legendary effects that needs it and make explosives go boom not poof.
---
I honestly can never tell where we are with the goal. The page on the website always reads at zero for me.
---
Upvote for having level headed thinking. I agree.
---
That's nice
---
I agree with everything you said, here, have my upvote :-)

As someone who binge game on occasions all the daily limits fucking sucks, gold, score, caps, scrip. Its stupid. With scrip for example, after you cashed in 150 scrip you have to start hoarding which will eventually lead to stash full and soon after overencumbered at which point you might as well log out.
---
Come and get pleas
---
I just chuck explosive bait at their camp until it's rubble. Doesn't instigate PVP and doesn't give you bounty. All they can do is waste ammo trying to kill you, while their camp crumbles.
---
I would stay there for as long as possible so that way if he wants to continue greifing then they have to either wait as long as I can wait or hop worlds
---
Pisses me off that I have about 500 levels across 5 characters so this all feels like it's hurting me vs just one bloated 500 level monster. Already the bullion system punishes multiples.
---
There are a huge number of issues PTS players reported pre-Wastelanders that still made into the live version of the game. The bugs and issues are being reported in the forums, yes. Whether the advice is taken on board and changes made is another thing all together. 
---
It is a test server, and only a first iteration for this patch but the feedback (and backlash) is warranted in my opinion. It's only through massive outcry that legendary perks were changed.
---
I tank imposter sheepsqatch and three pylons with under 20% health cause it's more stable. That stimpack efficiency play a huge role in tanking. I wouldn't call it a player skill but more of a player understanding the mechanisms of the game.
---
Just give me one with the Liberty Prime voice.
---
The western part of the map still isn’t worth visiting, since everything is only max lvl 25.  The eastern portion of the map is now full of lvl 75-100 bullet sponges.  It feels incredibly tedious.
---
1000 levels for +4 agility LUL
---
I want an Ice cream paint job. It should be loud af when you aren’t in stealth.
---
You're right 4k for both pieces, I always forget the helmet because it's useless and ugly.
---
I hope they add more NW rewards one day, I almost have earned my final Hellfire Power Armor skin and I wanna keep playing, but I also don't want to miss out on earning score either:/
---
~~They're actually giving the enemies a boost~~.  I'm not supposed to say that.
---
I don't think the stats on the existing enemies have changed, but with the addition of new Lv. 75 and Lv. 100 variants for a lot of them (even Honey Beasts), the end result is that your average enemy mob is more resilient.
---
Why do you assume that One Appalachia balancing is done?  People jump to far too many conclusions at the first sight of something.  Give your feedback and maybe they will listen.  They have been doing that more lately
---
Iv tried with the penta, it only took affect with the triple
---
Alternatively, there’s an equally popular spot literally across the street from pleasant valley station. However the junk extractor is too far from the water to have purifiers. 
---
On the east side of the map southeast of Berkeley Springs station there’s a junk extractor close enough to a few ponds. You may only be get the edge of the camp to get the extractor  and maybe 3 purifiers. Only thing there is that it puts you on the opposite side of the map.
---
There’s also another spot across from the motel in the mire (can’t remember the name of it). Similarly you won’t have a lot of room for purifiers. And the terrain is a little difficult to build on.
---
I ran the settlers line and got it, but see it in the store when looking into the items available.
---
Mushroom lamp is soooo bright
---
Yes please.
---
The unofficial number before they cleared the bar to zero and changed the goal was 160 something million. My guess is that we will get the score weekend.
---
That's not even remotely what I said idiot, way to take things out of context. I basically said that because he posted this he isn't better than the people who post I'm leaving the game, basically trying to prove a point by doing something stupid.
---
That doesn’t make any sense. Penta adds FFR and triple ads damage
---
Seriously every nuke dropped should awaken something.
---
Very true, but I’m not very coordinated so I probably would’ve flew up, hit the bottom of the floor and fell anyway
---
No it's a glitch, you blueprint the ammunition factory machine at the top of the map. I haven't done it myself so I don't know how it works but yeah that's how it's done.
---
Yeah I wish they would just make the explosive damage of legendary weapons a different type of damage than actual explosives 
---
They really hurt some of the most fun weapons in the game by just throwing tons of explosion resistance on mobs
---
The actual explosive weapons were never high tier, they shouldn't have also been effected imo
---
A friend of mine keeps taking these really popular spots and complains when his camp won’t spawn in and I keep telling him to move. He doesn’t even sell the water he gets from the purifiers. Or use it.
---
...do I *need* to draw a diagram? that it?
---
you can use skill to survive as a berserker build, does that make them as tanky as full health builds?
---
without spamming stimpacks, would you survive longer as a pylon with 100% hp as opposed to 19%?
---
skill, understanding of the mechanics and stimpacks **are not exclusive to bloodied builds**. my god. it's a simple comparison. can you survive longer as a full health build? yes? then bloodied builds are not as tanky. you even said so yourself.
---
Two can be found in cottages north of the Whitespring Resort.
---
One can be found in Watoga High School, on the shelf in the administration office.
---
One can be found in in a locked warehouse at Tanagra Town.
---
I do tbh lol
---
I honestly don’t know if it’s because of the scattered mod but hitting for 17 dps is terrible
---
I checked the spot near the Southern Belle Motel, I couldn't get the junk pile and the water inside of the range, I'm afraid it will be the same story for the spot near Berkeley Springs Station :/
---
The Whitesprings Firestation in the little bedroom. On the shelf to the right behind the open door, which opens *into* the room. Very very common for it to spawn as a Wakemaster.
---
Thanks it works now. But the hud is missing
---
That's what I was thinking i saw it happen with the triple so i figured I'd try it with the penta and it didnt happen with the penta
---
Explore. Read. Listen. Enjoy.
---
Also the sound engineering is top notch so a good headset makes a big difference.
---
Plans and recipes have to be learned by clicking on them under the "notes" tab. Took me way too long to learn this as a new player.
---
Yea and I’m getting downvoted without any explanation. The post is incoherent.
---
Your whole life and everything? Take a deep breath man.
---
It's cosmetics, it will show up in the Atom shop in six months anyway. If you're really dying then spend $75 and buy every level. If you don't think it's worth $75, then what are you getting so upset for?
---
If however you can't spend $75 to have what you want in life then I suggest your problem has nothing to do with videogames.
---
After an hour or two, I started finding it tedious.  It seems ridiculous to have min/maxed my rifleman build and still need two headshots to kill a regular lvl 75 Scorched with a bloody/explosive lever gun.
---
Oddly, I found that despite having no gladiator perks, my shishkebab does more than twice the damage of my Fixer.  Something isn’t right.
---
Those are fair points and what I was getting at when I mentioned the other bonuses that come with the subscription. What I was saying makes no sense to me is the people who say they pay for the subscription solely for the scrap box.
---
In addition, most people like yourself who value all of the other bonuses that come with FO1st would still pay for it even if the scrap box was included in the base game. Hell, it'd be a different story even if it was in the atomic shop.
---
But instead, Bethesda specifically allows the game to be extremely inconvenient and frustrating to try to coerce people into paying for FO1st, not for the bonus content you've described, but for a basic necessity in the game. They could easily put the scrap box in base game or atomic shop, and most people who currently pay for FO1st would continue doing so. That's what my problem is and why I think Bethesda is so greedy.
---
Nah.
---
It's not inconceivable that they might do it in the future, but for now, I think they generally want to put everyone on a more even keel when it comes to difficulty.
---
OK. That's weird. Try restarting your console.
---
Lady pants weren't invented in 1950, suck it up buttercup
---
U are forgiven. Now stop bitching
---
Of course you have to consider players using skills. What? you expect players to just stand there and take hits?
---
my build is based around guns i find and like, if i find a ripper for a few weeks im going to base my character on melee, if i find a good minigun its heavy weapons time, etc
---
So not really your friends then and why the fuck didn't you just, I dunno, log out.
---
It would be nice to have other places to nuke. There really aren't enough nuke related events with how big a part of the game launching nukes is supposed to be.
---
I’ve built several camps at the Berkeley location. You can definitely get water and junk in the circle. The build ring only needs to clip through half of the junk extraction spot to work. Place your camp on the ridge line. Also if you holster your weapon and go in third person it’ll help you see where your build ring will land. You can pivot your camera around without moving the module.
---
They don't seem to be your friends mate
---
Its normal like always. Only in dayli ops as a modifier to make it harder.
---
Theres a lot of things that Bethesda could learn from Bungie with destiny 2 in this sense, for instance we need a mailbox system that way any legendaries you don't pick up can go to the mailbox, also the leggo loot table needs to be condensed and have extremely useless items removed ( *** nocturnal pipe wrench for instance) the other thing about destiny that has made their loot system very interesting is umbral engrams and this ability to hone the engram into a specific item type eg specific weapon types and specific armour pieces if your not familiar with it definitely check it out it makes rng much easier to bear, and lastly the season systems will need a major rethink in its current state it is boring as hell.
---
That's something they implemented (enemies dropping the type of ammo you're currently using). I started one of those daily raids with around 300ish ammo for my Tesla Rifle and finished with way more than i even started with. Pretty great QOL thingy.
---
You say fire barrel, I say barrel fire. Potato, potato. ;)
---
I realized it when it was too late
---
Thanks :) Agreed, it would be great if they showed your progress within the current level before you enter a match, especially since one of the SCORE challenges is to level up.
---
I'm pretty much the opposite sadly. I played since launch up until last month when I got my pc and now I've just stopped playing it and I believe I've found how bad the game really is. But I totally agree that the game has huge potential, I personally want to see it become a big game in the world of games but the problem is that Bethesda ain't really doing things the right way. They keep adding content which brings more problems instead of fixing problems that exist. And with the addition of wastelanders and the lack of endgame content and lack of fixes from a big update that could have saved the game from the reputation it still has I gave up on playing it. I want to see the game grow but with the way Bethesda are handling the game I really cant recommend the game to anyone. It's sad actually.
---
My psn is boredomshaman, I’m on often.
---
Yeah, it is a shame that T65 does not have lamp mods :(
---
I like your statement it's bold and to the point overall. 
---
The quest being repeatable and tedious it's part of the story the majority of the quests and it's bound to repeat again and again because new players are coming to the game. Warframe is a great example. 
---
The thing is Bethesda needs to be more creative while keeping with the lore, I think Bethesda atleast the sector working on the game has passion for the game but aren't thinking outside the box for example nuclear winter is fortnite, and the daily ops reminds me a little of Dcuo with it's 4 player missions.
---
 I also think they're heading in the right directions in some regards, I ain't going to lie I heard how bad it was in the beginning and in the reddit it seemed like a nightmare, As I'm playing it now I'm actually enjoying it the enemy mechanic still feels clunky to say the least so they should work on making the enemies feel more fluid in their movement
---
What platform you on?
---
That's ok I wish they would remove carry weight and stash limits from the game as well. Take unyielding with it and rebalance the areas where it was providing things like xp gains and skill checks to compensate.
---
Xbox
---
I hear you but right now I need the work so I'm not complaining
---
It's also a grind when you are at the purveyor and have been trying to get your wanted rolls for armor or weps when you have to getting for script and have enough to get crazy nothing you want. Been getting for months trying to get the perfect pieces of ss armor and have only gotten one piece i truly want. I have 5 ss right legs without my perfect roll and yet i don't want you give them up just in case I'll later be able to trade or sell them. Also we get all these new camp craftables yet my budget had been maxed and I don't want to have to scrap stuff just to put up a new camp item. I'd pay more script if i could craft my perfect roll just once. 1000 script for v one piece of armor with my rolls would be well worth it then having to by legendary script and not getting one piece of worth to my build
---
I don't know. Between the raider ammo factory, ammo converter and this new ammo legendary perk, even with the bullet sponginess, it seems like ammo will be easier to come by than pre-Wastelanders. I don't think bullet sponginess is ever good game design, but I don't think their goal with this move is to increase time in-game. My guess is that it has more to do with server-side calculations and how messy the multiplicative system was in the first place. But yeah, all weapons should probably just get a damage increase across the board.
---
I'm at work right now but if you're gonna be on later I'll come through and fix your base.
---
Me too, I've been grinding for level 100, but once I'm there, I'm done with this game mode #bushwookiee :)
---
I'm going to wear the hellfire skin ironically. I've killed maybe 10 players throughout 100 levels lol
---
Problem is the PTS isn’t actually paid attention to by Bethesda. The last one pre-Wastelanders? All kinds of reported issues still made it in to Wastelanders.
---
I had to complete another one of the fetch quests since I had grabbed two of the items I needed for separate quests. After I figured out which one I just completed it and it let me return.
---
I'm only level 26, so I'm scared the range of my CAMP is smaller than that of a high level player, or is that not a thing?
---
This is the white alarm clock? You can find in the Candem Park, at the RoboBrain, where you can turn your tokens for reward ("Company Store").
---
My first time just happened.  Five out of the eight (don't count the NW one) and it sucks.  I was finally ahead of the pace but now when I have time to play tonight I'm going to slip behind again (and potentially again if it happens again).  I was logged in when the daily switch over happened so wonder if that was why......
---
I did wonder about these. The thing that put me off is do they always need a wire and terminal connected to them, or can you remove those once you’ve got the desired effect?
---
Nope. Not a thing. Camp size/budget does not change regardless of level.
---
Gt is: Sir Depress, I appreciate the help
---
Yep same for me cannot enter, when you press A to enter it just dulls out and nothing happens. I have tried server hopping logging out ect but nothing has worked. There has been a few optional things I would of liked to do and get but have had to bypass due to the broken game 😔
---
There is one in the amusement park where you redeem tokens.
---
in real life, yes. in a test, no.
---
**the test shows bloodied dies faster than full health. that means bloodied is not as tanky as full health.**
---
is that simple enough for you to understand? *you can now apply player skill on top of it if you want*, but that does not change the underlying fact that bloodied is not as tanky as full health.
---
Man, did I get spoiled by Space Engineers. In that game you just click on a light and can change a half dozen things about the light it puts out, even color. You can also access a computer console and adjust the light from there, including custom names. Fun building game.
---
Again, my point is that there are incentives for FO1st that are worth paying for it besides the scrap box, and most people who do pay for it would continue doing so even if the scrap box was free. The game is practically broken without the scrap box, and unquestionably frustrating and inconvenient. Bethesda has designed it in a way to try to inconvenience users to a breaking point where they subscribe to FO1st, and that isn't right.
---
All shotguns are affected by the "magic" in vats as long as you have the bashing damage effect on your armor.
---
324.  Thanks for the reminder!
---
I guess it kind of depends, I do have some friends who are a bit troll-ish.
---
The kind of friends who smack talk and trash talk, in games, like there's no tomorrow.
---
Though I do agree, you had a few mins to log off.
---
Did they do it while you were AFK or occupied in some way?
---
It's like people forgot this is a fallout game and that even though it's technically fallout 4 with survival difficulty that game wasn't hard either. In fact most legendary effects that were in both games got massively nerfed in 76. Fun fact go look at fallout 4's furious effect vs 76's where it caps at 50% extra damage. For those that don't want to bother it increased by 15% per hit and didn't have a cap. This game it's something around 5% per hit and caps at 50%.
---
Not a problem. My GT is my name on here without the 006.
---
As daguerre says... Just... Why... You have the best gear there is no enemy worth getting different gear for, no new skins or effects to chase or play for. Zzz
---
You're 100% spot on here, I just get twitchy when I hear people trying to balance the game against the bloodied effect, there is just no way it will work.
---
I mean, I have friends like that too but they would never nuke my base same as I wouldn't there's.
---
Oof lol I feel like I've gotten pretty good at it tho
---
I've developed many cursed strategies with all the busted perks and building mechanics 
---
[I highly reccomend this strat btw](https://streamable.com/eou107)
---
I wish the Hellfire Power Armor had the option to use the normal metal colors tho, I like the red look of it, but I already have the red rocket power armor set and it makes them look too similar
---
WoW will send unlooted loots in mail. No mail in Fo76 yet :(
---
Horizon: Zero Dawn and SWTOR has nice loot visuals with quality indicator.
---
We would be happy with something in Fasnacht event. You kill a legendary the item goes to your inventory. And no more search for disappearing loot.
---
When given same amount of stimpacks, full health build will definitely die faster when tanking heavy damage. Damage reductions are multiplicative as well in case you hadn't noticed. More you stack, much tankier you get
---
Just killed the wendigo colossus and had that happen last night. Spent a good 20 minutes before I gave up finding the meat pile
---
👍🏻
---
We were gonna launch one on the queen, one of them launched the nuke on queen, when another launched it on my base, I was watching the nuke ho off on queen when I hear outrageous laughter
---
Oh god, so convoluted. It’s the ammo converter on steroids.
---
Alright, I'll check your spot out then, thanks for the info and the quick replies!
---
Yeah, I like it.This may get down votes but the only thing that gets me with the changes is level 100 legendaries dropping 1* star crap. Didn't really bother me before but now it does. I think 3* shouldn't be a guaranteed drop, but they should up the odds.
---
I ran into this before.
---
Had to server hop to fix it.
---
I tried removing and putting the mask back on, but it did not work.
---
Server hopping is what fixed it for me.
---
Thanks a lot man, I'd rather leave them to someone else who need them, love the attitude though
---
What's your build dude, even normal heavy guns can mow down enemies quickly
---
The game doesn’t end, though. You continue to play as a floating 50.cal machine gun that can emote.
---
I sell it when I have space in my stash.
---
Yeah, I already tend to drop it in and out.  When I was going Legendary Run and clearing out areas, I found Grim Reaper's Sprint to be a lot more useful for keeping up the pace.  Or I can transfer some stuff out of Luck.
---
It feels weird to have a Fallout where Bloody Mess isn't a big deal, but it really isn't that amazing an effect after this change.
---
that's simply not true. and what do you mean by 'damage reduction'? because full health builds can use sentinel as well and serendipity is rng.
---
Sweet base man!
---
The only thing from seasons that has brought the community closer is the public teams. The need to do events for the score isn't it, as there's a lot of people who would just do events and mind their own business and some just afk at place waiting for the event to finish.
---
Plenty of people care, people love to ignore the truth if they love a game enough.
---
No problem. Fair warning, it’s a tough location to build at as far as terrain goes. Half your camp will be top of a cliff and half will be at the bottom. It’s not a huge cliff though. May want to put some turrets up. Enemies do spawn there but not often. Usually bloodbugs and supermutants when they do spawn. Easy to find from the station. The water is under a power line pylon which you can see from the station.
---
Managing health/rad levels for Bloodied builds is some micro, I’ll give you that.
---
But you may not realize just how little OTHER management you need to do.
---
Armor repair is few and far between because you kill so fast. Likewise chem usage; who needs stims when everything dies in 1 shot? Same for guns- very low ammo usage, very low weapon degradation. 
---
Hell, I’ve got 4 characters and a way to transfer stuff between them.
---
I run a surplus on literally anything you can think of it game. The only ammo I have crafted in recent memory is Ultracite 50cal, and I just made up a batch of like 20k about 2 months ago. I’ve still got about 7k left from that. Repairs? I’ve got a surplus of repair kits from OTHER people’s Encryptid/Scorched Earth initiations. 
---
So my gameplay is shoot loot and scoot. I don’t “farm” anything, I don’t need to. 
---
And to be honest, I don’t *need* to micro my health/rad levels, I just do it because I can. Eating glowing meat/glowing blood to raise rad levels, or taking diluted radaway to lower them, is easy, and I find those everyone.
---
I think there's one in the asylum
---
I just need to clear out my stash and I am almost full on script so I thought I would give them out as free script
---
How do you team up in Nuclear Winter
---
Sent you a friend request
---
You get a full set for finishing Rose's vanilla quest. I'm sure it was from that.
---
I had a guy 1 shot the legendaries at uranium fever one time. First time I thought it was an honest mistake, but the second and 3rd time? And then barfing emotes? It was definitely on purpose. Luckily for me he was a bloodied build and was on a public team, so all I had to do was share rank 2 of sun kissed and watch as he freaked out trying to get his rads back, after 2-3 times of all his rads draining he just gave up and stayed at full health
---
Lol @ bloodied gang crying.
---
Heavy guns all maxed out, bear arms, bandolier, power user, batteries included and stabilized maxed sometimes if I'm fighting bigger tough creatures. Guns are all heavy. Anti armor Ultracite Gatling laser, explosive vampires LMG and Gatling gun, vampires Gatling plasma and a zealots gatling plasma, furious Gatling gun. I switched my build up so many times.
---
 And how exactly is a comment about shotguns have nothing to do with adding more shotguns. Reddit trolls be on the hunt today.
---
Cause the bloodied gang is throwing temper tantrums
---
While I agree that it’s always more helpful to send complaints straight to the source, I don’t think you have to be on the PTS to know Bethesda should’ve put in some more work on the additive combat mechanics before making it public. Even if the numbers weren’t exact, it was clear they were off and now multiple builds can’t even test out other PTS content properly because they don’t know if the flaw is because their stats are totally changed or if the enemies are wonky
---
I went full on on bloodied DCG build, then a friend was like "I got this shotgun, it's bloodied and you have no ranged so use this instead of jumping at the queen like an angry cat"  
---
It one shot everything, two shots squatches up close and It just feels broken. But since I saw a post here say limb dmg is magic dmg, that explains.   
---
Only thing that seems immune to "magic" damage is the glowing mirelurk kings in the wendigo cave.
---
Damn, thought that one would work.
---
Maybe I'm just dumb but I'm saying how did he put it in his vendor? I couldn't figure out how to get a chassis with armor in my vendor. Unless mine is isn't working or something?
---
Yeah but the amount of whining I see on this reddit about rng people would explode trying to get their gear again
---
low health builds got more dodgy procs and emergency protocols. And what you mean by simply not true? I used to be a tanker in my raid team
---
I literally just run around in a stealth suit and owl mask clawing at things
---
Some are just slow to extract such as acid junk tends to pull faster but none will just run out
---
That's a good idea, making it so different challenges require a slightly different approach. Right now the only difference between any of them is the entry/exit points. The junk is even scattered in the same places.
---
Yeah, I got this a few months ago and stopped using it because of it blocking a lot of heavy guns views. Sucks too, because it’s one of the better PA skins
---
76 doesn’t have any DLC.
---
I stared at the \*\*\* for like 30 secs trying to figure out what curse word you were using before realizing that you were just saying it was a 3 star...
---
Double barrels are just plain fun.
---
I'm usually a content over qol kinda guy but things like this boggle my mind.  The fact that the community nrleed to make a plan mule so collectors could be sure they had everything.
---
I also had to leave behind that helmet from the power armor in that room when your helping ra ra find her toy bun bun everytime I asked her to open the door for me to get power armor she came out the vent and just stood there in the room and did not move so after restarting that pain in the ass quest multiple times I gave up and bypassed that room and I would of liked that helmet it looked cool 🙃
---
I think I did mod the sword on a machine that wasn’t the fabricator. Idk if that fucked it up. Imma try server hopping
---
hahaha that's great! ...thanks for the tip about the color. I would think the red rocket looks cleaner than the hellfire. My main is a sneak VATS bloodied/unyielding commando with explosive weapons, and I don't use power armor much.
---
I've watched some good videos on different metas to try (shotgunner, etc.) Maybe I'll build one with the 50 or so park card points I haven't spent lol
---
You already have all the best shit. As you said it, you're burned out. 
---
Just take a break. Why do people have such a hard time taking a break?
---
All spin-up weapons do this. Minigun, Gauss Minigun, Gatling laser, Gatling plasma.
---
Is this the spot you're talking about? The red marker is the junk pile https://i.imgur.com/kVRN2e0.jpg
---
Had it happen a few times on PS4 as well as extended wait times to find games
---
There's one BOS outfit, the Engineer one, that includes something like a propane tank on the back that actually clips into whatever backpack you're wearing. Depending on the backpack, it actually looks pretty cool.
---
you got *either* more dodgy procs *or* emergency protocols, you mean. noting that I said in the op that you *can* be tanky as a bloodied build *with PA*, which means no legendary armor.
---
and speaking of dodgy specifically, one, it's not exclusive to bloodied builds, and two, I had dodgy equipped in my clip. didn't help much. a full health build would still survive longer, even with less procs.
---
Looks like it from what I can tell.
---
But he does have a point. Obviously someone that works, has family duties, etc. and is behind, won't really reach the end or wouldn't have gone very far anyway even with the time left. That is including double scores dailies and week and last three weeks or so. So I dont think hes wrong.
---
Putting aside the ill-conceived card scrapping aspect and focusing just on the length of the Legendary Perk grind, I think this is the side effect of running events like Legendary Run where players are pressured to complete them as quickly as possible due to FOMO.  Players start to apply FOMO logic to everything.
---
But I don't think that's actually what Bethesda intends with this system.
---
Legendary Perks aren't supposed to be something you aggressively grind toward.  It's more like the Mr. Fuzzy outfit.  Something that lingers in the background that you'll earn someday in the course of playing the game, as long as you stay the course, but not something that's supposed to be at the forefront of everything you do.  You will absolutely burn yourself out if you throw everything at trying to accomplish it as soon as possible.  And most of the Perks, even after the additive change, aren't that worthwhile anyway.
---
And the three that remain have partially completed.  So weird.  1,500  SCORE unavailable!
---
Probably joined the team for the extra perk cards and free fast travel points
---
Well it's going to come eventually. Some major change to gear is going to happen. It has to in a game like this.
---
Mines done same, no points for the ones it says I've apparently finished and halfway through killing super mutants.
---
I can't move my camp, for mess around with the elements that were added to it by that other person because I don't know the plans for what they added. So I can't really rebuild them or something. I didn't fully understand the error message.
---
Like I think I can move the objects around inside the building by just grabbing them, but I can't make another one and I'm not sure they would survive me relocating my camp which I don't want to do anyway.
---
I just don't have the plans cuz I haven't done the whole mothman thing.
---
I just remembered when I tried to mess around with sort of the wall of antlers and bones that the person set up it got all weird on me. I might have just been screwing that part up.
---
Have you ever noticed this happen before?
---
Yep, 5/9 for me... Thanks Bethesda, it's not like I was trying to catch up on rewards or anything. Do yourself a favor and never do a paid battlepass, you can't even fix something like this, probably been around since the season started.
---
Just wait for challenges to auto complete during 2x Score, can't wait for the reddit hate to go around.
---
If you move you base, it supposedly gives all your materials back, but depends on if your base is a complex build, most bases can't be replaced. If you like the area, then stay and just get it fixed. I had mine in prime but had to eventually give it up as it always got destroyed .. where is your camp now ?
---
You can team up at main menu and then join together. Just finishing dailies now and will prob hop back on NW a little later. Feel free to add me.😊
---
This is actually a good idea. Gives people an opportunity to get said items if they missed the season 1. They still have to do some grinding of gold bullion but whatever.
---
If the number of mods that make you essentially god for fallout 4 still being made is any indication the answer would be no clearly a lot of people don't. I mean most people were upset how badly nerfed player damage was and legendary effects were coming from 4 to 76 given that 76 is using 4's survival mode difficulty.
---
I bet one of the higher ups came up with the perk-coins-for-cards idea and the rest of them are wading through this shit trying to make it work.
---
Never, I've even jumped servers to see if that might clear it and same result.
---
Pretty sure you don't get the helmet and she's just pissy with you
---
The daily for joining a team that they love to put up
---
The lights I were talking about are the most basic of the electrical bear bulb light fixtures. I think that the ones you get for free. but by building a very tall ceiling and then hanging them from the tall ceiling I get them out of the visual line of the character. That softens the light in the room in general so it's not like you're staring at a light bulb.
---
Sort of like how in real life my ceiling fan is almost a half a story higher than the regular ceilings, so it's light softly fills my dining room. Instead of being down and eyeline and kind of harsh.
---
I think people don't really understand the group differences and usefulness of the different ones, so just see "experience" and join that one.
---
I left the PTS downloading overnight so today I could test how far can I get being a lvl 250
---
The problem is going to be that I have a LOT of perk cards, since I have 8 builds for my character. So I dont think I'll get too much.
---
More proof that Bethesda doesn't play its own game
---
It's a bug that is avoided by logging off before the reset and to wait around 1-3 hours to log back on.
---
Not bad mate.  You'll do well.
---
Whitesprings, if you have a flat area I'd love to hear it, but I'm only there because:
---
1: Haven't seen a nuke dropped there in a while
---
2: It's flat
---
Nice one 👍
---
Yep, you're a griefer. Thank you for making my point.
---
Nice you still enjoying it, it sure is a complex bunch of mechanics and if you think about it. Quests for me have always been tedious and boring, I loved FO4, but I think I just grew out of quests or something .. still haven't done the Wastelanders or most of the quests, but I should try, but dailies consume anytime I have maybe one day.
---
Heard mentality, empath, strange in numbers, inspirational, free fast travel. Those are some of the reasons people join teams, they want the buff. Not to actually play as a team
---
I need to kill 5 more Mutants, 2 glowing creatures and build 5 more things in my camp or workshop.
---
Of course it didn't Auto-complete the NW one.. which I refuse to play anyways.
---
Part of my CAMP build is the missile turret so I can passively farm Yao Guai for their acid.  Imagine my surprise when I go out and I'm looting an Observant Radstag.
---
Not very observant to miss the turrets, TBH.
---
I am doing that 3x everyday. It is a real pain in the ass.
---
I was good with the additive switch, but they definitely should have done some due diligence and changed a few of the %’s at least that were obviously not going to work for this update. 
---
They’re giving a lot of the people the wrong idea by doubling down and defending the change on the forums when they try rationalizing that optimized builds are still better off. I generally do defend Bethesda, but this combat system was clearly just a decision to simplify the formula and have the players do the rest of the balancing work.
---
Bloodied needs a nerf
---
Mine are bugged as well, hopefully they are fixed. You can't even complete the active ones.
---
I join for team required perks and mutations to work. Inspirational etc. I do events whenever I can.
---
I was actually disappointed.  I made a CAMP with just the glow-in-the-dark star/planet wallpaper and NO lights of any kind.  It was as bright as daylight inside even the deepest recesses of my house.  It lasted a week and then I tore it down to make something similar but without trying to be spooky.
---
Queen and colossal wendigo. Are there any more or are you counting just regular enemies like ghouls and such out in the world?
---
Legendary perks should have nothing to do with perk cards at all. This is a fantastic mistake and Bethesda just keeps on walking into it.
---
Why? The drawbacks are much quicker HP 0
---
It's cool if you don't go the meta route. Play like you want to. That being said, you're using more ammo, more health items, repairing armor more often, and leveling up slower as a result. Builds are "just playing the game" more efficiently.
---
Identical to what it did on mine, hopefully might reset itself later
---
I have the same gun except it's a pump action and it's my main as well how many shells does your take fully loaded
---
If you start removing all the buff because they don't give enough,you'll have your normal gun with no perks.
---
But yesterday it said that we had collectively donated 160m cork, and then they changed the requirement from 200mil to 150mil. 
---
I'd put this up as a visual glitch for now
---
I've seen clans and wondered how they did it
---
There's this thing called ap regen buffs and kinetic servos that let you proc dodgy a lot more. Christ
---
Then they should be joining the building team, you get a constant intelligent buff which means more experience with everything you do
---
Why can't they just retroactively give you coins for special point moves? Make a default amount and then award coins for every time you moved a point? I'm not on PTR so I could be missing a detail on why this won't work.
---
Absolutely! I'm baffled they refuse to acknowledge that...
---
Testing? Bethesda doesn't Test anything! That's not in their job description.
---
I finally got my Fixer plan the other night ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Recon if you did one mission of wastelanders a day it might hit a bunch of dailys at the same time. Find am going to places like the burrows where I didn't go much before and building a different camp is more fun now have finished the season. Currently working on my street of a base, but with build limits it's been interesting.
---
Dude I’m 31, married and just had a baby...
---
This is the only option I see as well, and not just in FO76, almost a growing trend, you either no life it or you watch that which has no life.
---
Yeah. They can't even make nocturnal and stalker's worth a damn.
---
This has mostly been my experience, with some outliers.  Most notably the bosses and the Lv. 100 Scorchbeast, who all take an absurd amount of punishment, and the Lv. 50 Laser Turrets, which while only requiring 3-5 shots, make for an extremely tedious situation every time they show up because you just have to sit there plinking away.  And this is with a Rifleman build with all 9 ranks, Tank Killer 3, Bloodied, etc.  That ain't right.
---
The caveat to this is that if you rely on a slower-firing weapon, that extra shot (or two or three) can potentially get you into trouble if stealth breaks and everyone starts bearing down on you.  And that's kind of okay - Huntersville isn't a cakewalk anymore - but it would seem to put Commandos and other rapid-fire builds at a distinct advantage.
---
Some nice person for free dropped me an instigating, explosive, +1 agi double barrel shotgun and i'm loving it. &lt;3 to all the nice people sharing good loot
---
Yeah, that whole "plan mule" thing is really absurd... It just seems that really basic stuff, that you would immediately think about implementing after playing the game for only a few hours, is missing.
---
Speaking of challenges, the fact that you can't see your active challenges without logging into a server is also kind of ridiculous. I guess with how hackable this game is, they want to keep as much data server-side as they can.
---
I should give you a tour of all my camps, I got some really neat camps, actually let me find a video, you really don't need a flat spot to make a cool camp ... One of my first camps was at WhiteSpring by the Mirelurk pond, but I have long moved on, that's asking to be nuked but lots of people still have camps in the bottom end of WhiteSpring and North of the Gold Club ..
---
Anyway check out some of my camp spots, I can give you a tour I you interested.
---
https://youtu.be/ypSmpaG60_M
---
I run about 10-15 characters at the moment so have about 15 camps, nothing too fancy, just fun building in new spots.
---

---
OP is bloodied.
---
Time to get out the ffr pump action shotty me thinks 👍
---
Yeha the entire thing needs to be redone and I would also go as far to say that the time to kill should be similar to escape from tarkov, kill easily and be killed easily instead of how it's now.
---
Yeah, them getting rid of double sided walls was pretty bad.
---
It is but the regen is nice. Works in combat as well.
---
I have been watching the videos trickling out about the current PTS changes (Yes this is PTS and none of it is confirmed).  I haven't seen anyone comment on higher level weapon drops, and I believe this would be as major of a discussion piece as the damage changes.
---
If they ever do upgrade the max level for weapons, I hope they add in a way for us to farm for rare components to use to upgrade our current weapons to max level.  This way we can take that weapon we have used since the first week of the game and keep it relevant, but it still takes time to farm up the necessary components for it.
---
 Just like if they add in the 4th and 5th suffix for weapons, I personally would like it to be from crafting mods that we make from rare drop components at a new crafting station, or even just trading the rare components with Mmurgh for the mods.
---
I've crafted a plasma shotgun in game. I stuck a splitter on a plasma gun and the description of the weapon was changed to "Plasma Shotgun" and it did benefit from all of my shotgun perks.
---
Their problem is they advertised upcoming game features, then tied them to a pretend contest.. and when nobody participated they still have to go through the motions because the 'prize' is the damn content roadmap.
---
I have no bashing damage and still use my magic vats
---
People rarely die bloodied and death isn't bad in this game.
---
You can almost kill them with anything you want. But they won't die, and keep a very small health of their health bar. To finish them you have to quickly change to melee weapon, come close to them, and do the job. All while everyone is trying to kill you.
---
Can people still blow up your vehicles?
---
On pc had the same issue on public teams, changed audio chat settings to auto, restarted computer and it worked. Might help if you check your computer's mic setting in the windows settings, sometimes it's set quite low and you have to crank it up for people to hear you.
---
Awwww, did i touch a nerve?
---
I don't play NW, so for that 15 minutes it is quicker to get the score from XP in "carebear ADV", that's all there is to it, efficiency.
---
But sure lets just say i'm entitled.
---
You can store them or move them. If you scrap them they are gone.
---
No idea.
---
I know that's a thing for the Daily Ops (it kind of had to be), but is that something they did more generally?  I like that, if it is.
---
Hopefully something better than what the fox says...
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4f135df&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pp2pl2cu0ce0cr0ic4a72ar2an2ao0a51a00l70l12lt2lu2lv2lk1sg1s01eh0
---
Something like this.
---
Depends what teams are up. If there's only space on an events team then joining that is better than creating a building team and hoping people join.
---
Also depends what events - workshop defends are "events". So someone in an events team will get extra xp from doing those even if they arent interested in doing project paradise etc
---
ap regen buffs are not exclusive to bloodied builds and I've already said, in the op even, that PA does make bloodied builds tanky, *at the cost of no legendary armor*. you can't have both unyielding and PA.
---
and even then, as I said in my previous post, a full health build would **still** survive longer in that situation even with less dodgy procs.
---
Two shot explosives got nerfed so long ago bloddie should have been too .
---
That’s not why the resistance is so high. The SBQ has had that resistance since launch (before they realized the explosive energy weapons didn’t belong in the game)
---
Not just you. I would like to play a role than follow a meta.
---
it's like a telethon, everybody pretend to be on the phone in the background even though there's no calls coming in
---
The drawback is not nearly as bad as you make it out, can't be killed if everything is oneshot.
---
I have to wait 3 hours to log in and do my dailies each day? Ugh...
---
I chose the mr gutsy body by accident. I don’t remember the rewards or lack thereof. But she is mad at you the first time you show back up at the wayward. Not hostile but just some angry dialogue and you can convince her that it’s ok.
---
Maybe if you incorporate stealth dynamics, but that can be said about any build. The main thing with that effect is the cost to benefit ratio which works quite well in my opinion. 
---
Plus the right attack can give most of those builds a nightmare time
---
But mine only likes using commando while drunk.. great entertainment, but terrible on my ammo supply.
---
The site updated the tracker but it’s back to zero.
---
I’m curious as well
---
That’s super. I’m so glad you’ve given expressed your opinion. 
---
Not sure why I’m pathetic like the OP. 
---
Why explain anything when you can just call people names.
---
I should just get on the bandwagon and exploit glitches. It’d be best.
---
I've been screwed out of a couple legendaries like that, sometimes the bodies will delete themselves along with the loot
---
I find it kind of amazing that we've gone through almost two summers with Fallout 76 and they haven't expanded the swimsuit options for any gender.  There's still just the one, it's for women, and it's a pretty garish one at that.
---
So is it legit or is it a exploited glitch?
---
Sometimes I’ll join an event team so that I can share Inspirational 3 to let the three of y’all get +15% XP. I may or may not do an event, but I figure I can get my Strange in Numbers active and if I happen to run an event I’ll get some benefit too. 
---
*You* get the same amount of event experience bonus from the bond whether I’m tryin to capture Mad Dog Malone for the 50th time or sleeping in my bunk.
---
So why does it bother you that I’m *helping* you and giving you an extra +25% event XP and +15% general XP?
---
Good luck with shotguns! The combat shotguns can be even stronger than the gauss ones due to their fire rate 
---
And ya the Hellfire and Red Rocket power armors have almost identical red coloration and polish, it kinda annoys me because the original Hellfire Power Armor from fallout 3 was just normal metal colored armor, I think the set looks cool enough without having to be a bright red color 
---
[Here's an image of the red Hellfire armor you get at rank 100](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/2/2b/Fo76_NuclearWinter_Rewards.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190610200024) if you wanna see what I mean 
---
It annoys me because the game has [the original unpainted Hellfire armor](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/9/98/HFPPA.png/revision/latest?cb=20190913135631) in its files, but you can only get the bright red color version
---
Is there a version of the Cryolator that works better than others as far as freezing the queen? I rolled a BFFR Cryolator the other day but have never used a cryo
---
This was what I thought as well. Sorry that happened.
---
Wait, how did you get 999 per cores? Isn’t it only 500?
---
"Damn I picked up this rifle instead of the ammo, game sure is hard"
---
The Bus of Raiders that drive down the street every few days will take out your lamp post.
---
I would much rather instead of making it impossible to sneak from/around them, they'd make it more realistic and challenging to stay hidden from them.
---
Then there's another effect causing it too, sorry for my ignorance. As far as i knew, bashing damage was giving the massive boost to shotgun but never actually used it. Thanks for the heads up!
---
But PVE is about how much a player enjoys their gaming experience against the environment. 
---
Pvp can be avoided easily.
---
And a large group of Ghouls with tad damage can easily take out that build, or any tad damage for that matter, poison also.
---
There are so many alternative ways
---
It only works when you're out of combat. Mine's working just fine.
---
Everything you said was valid. 
---
But imo, the feeling/need to get on every day due to challenges isnt only the games fault.
---
Yes, that's what they are trying to do, but it doesn't effect me.
---
It is interesting. They mentioned them finding code all the way back from morrowind that's still in the game. Even seeing some of the talent they hired to create it.
---
I kinda have a feeling the auto complete bug has to do with that or the ledegendary board.
---
Yeah. But the joke is on "catching up"... It's an artificial goal.
---
Make your own goals. In life, in Fallout!
---
Do you know how far into the season you have to get?
---
Wait a couple of minutes, sometimes a bit longer and push respawn again
---
I never got this in the first place. I run a vanguard armor, enforcer shotgun/sniper build and there isn't a single enemy in the game that I can't handle. Even high level enemies go down so quickly that any more damage would just take the fun out of it, and the armor means that DR is so high that incoming damage is laughable even from Gutsies. Assaultrons become completely harmless in three shots. It's great.
---
Having to micromanage health and rads for a bloodied build? Fuck that.
---
I get that but dodgy proccing on low health build is a lot different from full health builds. I literally don't give a damn about imposter sheepsquatch melee attacks cause it does not do any damage. I get you are not a min maxer but once you get to a certain level, things change a lot and is a lot different from a food builds perspective
---
I’m bloodied solo player.  Am I too vulnerable now?
---
He’s obviously hoping to get that bullshit changed.
---
Did we succeed the page says concluded but still locked lol
---
This is what I thought.. I know perk cards are character specific but everything else is supposed to be account wide to my understanding... I could have misunderstood it
---
They slowed down the effect of speed demon on healing, I believe. if I am wrong someone will correct me shortly lol
---
There are lvl 1000+ in the game? The highest I've seen was 700+ I think.
---
On my alts I did the Protectron and the Mr. Handy. She becomes disgruntled, and you don’t get the helmet, but other than that no real impact.
---
I don't consider facerolling content as we do right now in FO76 a gaming experience that is intended to begin with. I rarely die with my main bloodied build and when I do it's because I've simply did not pay attention at all. The game needs a way better balance and a meta shift to be enjoyable again for many people.
---
I'll probably only use the poison resistance and SPECIAL for the rest of the slots.
---
with all the upcoming "features" I tested on PTS (specially daily OPS) I prefer to focus on special so it will let me run a variety of perks loadouts.
---
That's griefing?  LOL sounds like two idiots playing with each other.
---
No, bethesda bad, that's the topic for this week and you're not allowed to say anything else
---
Fallout 76 has I lot of unfinished, incomplete, broken, bootleg, bandaid, half-ass development. This game was released in 2018. It's now 2020. I've spent over $200 in hopes the game will run better, to no avail.
---
It is a beautiful concept and story with everything an adult gamer could want. The event, quest, player cooperation, trading - just awesome. Until you can't progress the main storyline (ounce of prevention) cause its bugged.
---
If I could go back, I'd buy it again. But I wouldn't buy store items, Atoms or Private worlds. The game is not correctly made well enough to warrant the price tag.
---
You can use the ProSnap camera to help find legendary bodies, but you're right. Even with the camera the body is nowhere to be found sometimes. I always loot the impostor ASAP before it explodes to be safe.
---
Cannibal is where it's at.
---
Whenever people wear the suit, it’s because they want to be invisible. So it’s pretty useless to add a skin to a suit that has a purpose of being invisible. 
---
Sure you could argue and say that people can enjoy the skin as long as they aren’t crouching. But honestly I don’t know if anybody that likes to walk around with the stealth suit instead of their armor. 
---
Most people just put on the stealth suit when needed, otherwise they wear their regular clothes and armor.
---
Shut up salty nigga
---
you're assuming a lot of things.
---
regardless, no, it's not different. the effect is the same whereas you're bloodied or full health.
---
but even if you were right, that doesn't change the fact that a full health build would survive a lot longer in that clip. which is the whole point of this topic. which seems to have gone over your head entirely.
---
Yeah the V.A.T.S + 33 is the magic effect, I've had lots of various different types of armor since I've had my shotgun and it's Always been like that and im almost lv 300, I've had that gun since around 100ish
---
Building gives overall exp % though.  So if you’re only joining for the perks, building is the best option
---
Because i would like to do a successful rad rumble or project paradise event that is very hard to solo and no one does it, so there is no reward in events that have great rewards when no one joins them
---
Beautiful idea. But... They wont even fix simpler stuff, why do you think they will implement this system?
---
Okay, cool. I wasn't really concentrating on that aspect because I was trying to help you with your lighting problem. I just have no idea what they were called so I didn't know how to refer to them except as these candelabra things that showed up because someone put them in my base.
---
But I feel like the need to get on every day isn't just the games fault, not to sound mean (I was the same with ESO and got burnt out.)
---
Legendary run is cool, but I don't pay attention to challenges. It's free, so I especially feel no need to get on everyday and do it. (They are making it easier to level with S2)
---
I find the daily bulion grind more tedious and annoying, but that's typical for MMO and MMO-like games these days.
---
I feel like I'm pretty soft on Bethesda. They release the game and there is no way to undo mistakes, so I plan ahead and do my research, then they add respec and I tell people "Even if you mess up, you can eventually fix your build". 
---
Now they walk back that entire step, and we're back to a situation where its now once again a mistake to misplace a single point.
---
They need to make whatever people do with their excess cards cosmetic, it can't punish people who already have used those points to respec.
---
edit: all I can do is repeatedly talk about it on the forum and see if they listen.
---
This community's vitriol towards nerfs is completely pointless. They will achieve the exact same effect as nerfing by introducing new stronger enemies, which is what people are CONSTANTLY ASKING FOR. It's literally just a case of glass half full/half empty, and yet people here foam at the mouth at only one of those
---
Damn what a waste the purifiers chug out mucho caps
---
Everyone is running around caring about maxing out their damage meanwhile here I am as the only tank/medic character I've met pretty much since starting this game back in year 1.
---
Do u guys remember that South Park episode with the informative murder porn, and how the kids were begging the cable company to get it off the air but the cable company was the only cable in the area so they knew they had them by the balls?....how is this any different? They r gonna do what they want and we will play it afterwards. It sucks, but u can't unite an entire community so I guess we just deal with it...
---
...while I may know about the BoS event, my character does not... so my character is not participating.
---
Main menu VAGUE announcements don't tell my character anything.
---
In game? ZERO way to know about it.
---
Don't care.
---
Didn't someone do tbis and tried to sue Bethesda? Or was it another game?
---
You know, I can't say I've ever tried selling a chassis before. Maybe it has something to do with it being a quest reward and not a chassis found in the wild?
---
A current bloody build has zero drawbacks...especially with a certain combination of perks and mutations that you would want to have on naturally gives you a god mode exploit making running around with low health negligible. I can’t be killed and the bloodied weapons don’t even do as good as all of the broken weapons...this game can’t be taken seriously in the end game since everything has been screwed for years builds don’t even matter
---
Apparently we did now is Brotherhood of Plastic ;)
---
About the same as my experience,  but when I was surrounded by 5 or 6 Invisible Colonel Gutsys that stayed invisible while tearing me a new arse, I had had enough, I just logged of the PTS and though fuck that, nothing fun about that frustrating BS :-)
---
Also a pc player, it happens from time to time, this is on both Bethesda app and steam. Sometimes it just goes away and fixes it's self, sometimes just a restart, sometimes it's a windows update or a driver update needed.
---
So you're making my point even more thoroughly. Thanks for the support. People who don't want to PVP can't use a significant portion of the equipment economy unless they pay extra money to get a first membership. Meanwhile the griefers can ruin their day if they try to make use of a necessary available facility.
---
So thanks I guess?
---
But how many players absolutely love this build? 
---
I know it's mixed feelings but so many people, most likely yourself as well, have invested so much time into their dream build and this will completely destroy that for them
---
That is very sad, but I don’t think anyone could blame u. The grind of the game is intense, even by the standards of someone whose always played MMO’s, and the rewards for it all aren’t that brilliant. The world is broken in many ways, and they do seem to break more shit than they fix with every new update. Sadly, until this changes I feel like we’ll continue to lose players both old and new. I’ve seen many posts about people who’ve even played since BETA leaving bc they now feel it’s hopeless. I really hope that Bethesda can take the constructive criticism from the community and turn it all around. I’d like to stick around for the long haul, cuz I love the game, but Bethesda sure needs to make it seem like we’re worth their time. 
---
P.S. thanks for not writing a mindless “Bethesda bad” post and actually offering up constructive criticism. The community (and obviously Bethesda) need much more of this.
---
I think you have to mod to crystalized(?) barrel
---
Fair enough indeed, because I wouldn’t consider Division 1 a good game.  Ghost Recon Wildlands is an infinitely better sandbox-shooter.  The looter-shooter bullet-sponge concept just didn’t make sense to me when the enemies are humans (unlike Destiny’s alien lore which is easier to swallow.)  shooting a shirtless dude carrying a baseball bat 500 times in the chest just didn’t make sense to me.  To each their own :)
---
Can someone explain what legendary perks are for the level 50 here?
---
You're talking about legendary power armor and stuff like that? IDK how Bethesda nlets those items exist. 
---
You'd think it would set off some kind of anti cheat system.
---
Do you have any other characters, or just the Bloodied one? Do you need to kill everything 300% faster than the other builds around you in order to play?
---
that's why after I donated steel I just stopped. Ya'll can give away your scrap all day. I'll just sit back and claim rewards for free. See how that sounds?
---
The people complaint the loudest are just gonna miss either breezing through events or grieving players in PVP.
---
These aren't essential builds.
---
They're lazy and OP as hell and need to have been needed ages ago.
---
I have the bloodied gauss and still use a furious combat and berserkers double barrel for real close in heavy damage at 218.
---
The fact that people like Eskeet0m overlook absurdities like that in favor of enforcing their 1950s dress code really casts a giant spotlight on their deeply regressive, misogynistic motivations.
---
If enough people speak up they will change this
---
I used a bloodied faster firerate handmade because I had it drop out of pure luck but other than that my build is the regular full health build I've always used, I like it better this way.
---
Go for it, my main character is actually a frontline tank/medic and this game seriously needs players focusing on doing more than just dealing max damage.
---
I'm not seeing a down side here
---
I join event teams because daily challenges make me. Usually I pick events because there'll be a daily event (or three) to knock off so if an event kicks off I'm with the right people, but in all honesty I just join the team that has space. Join team, take photo, maybe complete event, leave team. 
---
Sorry.
---
Combat Armor, Marine later, I only use PA when I need it. Combat Shotgun, Combat Knife, Combat Rifle, Furious laser rifle, tons of nuka grenades.
---
If you've done the quest once you should be able to skip to the control room. I've completed the quest for the first time yesterday and it sucked. At the end after inserting the keycard I proceeded to the code from nukacrypt but somehow it didn't work and I lost my keycard. A team member had to complete it for me. I hated that quest.
---
Such is the path a 2 year old game trying to live forever must take. Its a shift to cater to the clientele that is more susceptible to spend piles of cash on microtransactions - kids, teens, and adults 18-25.
---
Yeah I assumed you were a extreme min maxer cause I seen you active in this forum ever since the game launched and came up with a lot of theorycrafting that kinda made sense. My mistake
---
Yeah but....I can’t say because I have been banned before on this subreddit for mentioning it but there is a certain exploit a lot of people are doing intentionally or unintentionally since you would want these said mutations and perks on anyways but cause a god mode glitch essentially so you never die and it has existed since day 1! Bloodied is a rich get richer build there is nothing to sacrifice or drawback
---
A few weeks ago
---
It's hard to say.  A lot of shotguns have "magic" attributes right now where the full damage is being applied per-pellet.  If and when Bethesda fixes that, some people will be in for a rude awakening about what that means for their setup.
---
Not even close.
---
&gt;have invested so much time into their dream build
---
I put like 150 hours to trade my way to get my set. But it's an evolving world and nothing should stay the same forever. The game just needs to change and keep fresh instead of staying on the same spot for that long. Bloodied is the meta for so long and anything else is subpar.
---
The way you described the it seems like it's only there to effect low levels. Also, it sounds the other way around. Wouldn't a low damage build be most effected by it rather than a low health
---
In my experience with the PTS, none of the "explode on death" perks like Far Flung Fireworks are worth it. Their bonus damage is just really negligible, it's essentially like if a Frag Grenade detonated on the enemy's death. 
---
Retribution is super easy to activate versus any enemy that uses melee, like Ghouls or Mirelurks or Deathclaws. The timing for blocking is kinda weird, it feels like you have to start your block earlier than you'd think, but once you get it down it's a lot of fun to stagger enemies like Behemoths and Deathclaws instead of getting staggered constantly yourself. I'm still not really sure the HP/AP regen is useful, but just at rank one it IS noticeable. 
---
What Rads? is my favorite legendary perk so far, as a tank build. I maxed it out on the PTS and with 300 Rad Resist and a constant -6 rads per second (it goes even while you're being irradiated, unlike Sun Kissed), I can shrug off any radiation except for nuke zones and the Radiation Rumble tunnels.
---
junkies is good
---
If you really want to get rid of the effect, drop or stash all of your shells and pick them back up. You may have to fire any shells left in the gun before picking your ammo back up. Breaking the gun also breaks the bug.
---
I have that exact armour I also found it quite annoying. My favorite armour personally is the black rider hopefully Bethesda find a way to fix that sorry excuse of an armour. And it can get way worse with pain train
---
The reward for cork is still locked, so I'm going to say.....no :(
---
They also broke Unarmed STR scaling. If you have less than 10 STR, you lose damage.
---
Rank 1 should be enough to see a improvement in crafting; they already have boosted ammo crafting amounts in the past multiple times. If you are using ultracite ammo that's on you though; you shouldn't be wasting ammo that requires flux.
---
They ought to have it drop from the sky if you FT to Lewisburg Station, like the Scorchbeasts often do at Watoga. 😋
---
Most mature people and those with at least half a brain recognize that to make a point it takes facts to support a claim, which I think you did quite well. Welcome to the internet's 1% club.
---
Couldn't agree more,  at first it was exciting, fast forward to now, I've gotta finish as I've vested far too much of time. Three or four weeks of the same stuff is monotonous.  Just my two cents.
---
That's really dumb of them. With the game funded by the atomic shop, having more alts is money for Bethesda.
---
What if they added knew builds instead of needing the system?
---
Are you checking the melted metal piles? I ran it this morning and that's where the loot was.
---
Sometime there a fusion core that spawns on the cabinet thats directly on the wall past the mini gun. I between the box and shelf in the middle of it. Then on the floor next to the weapons bench between the table and it there is a bobble head that spawns. Plus the up to 3 mods that can s
---
The fusion core only spawns sometimes. But you can also get ammo andnother stuff. Its hard to see and is hidden
---
The game is fine without the scrapbox. For ages, we would just bulk our scrap and vend it. One can also optionally not loot everything in sight. Or one can just toss what they don't need, dropping it on the ground for someone else. I once found a bag with 1000 steel scrap in it at a train station. Folks are not being inconvenienced. Just like ESO began without the bottomless crafting bag, FO76 began without the scrapbox. If there was never a scrapbox, folks would still be playing, just with one more thing to manage.
---
People *other than those on your team* can do Radiation Rumble with you.
---
And most people that run Radiation Rumble are doing it for the kills and legendaries and **normal** XP. It’s very rare to see anyone gathering ore unless you have a dedicated team of friends.
---
Public Teams are not a replacement for getting a group together to run specific tasks. They are an **addition** to that. 
---
It makes more sense for me to join a 3-person Events team and give a +15% XP bonus to everything they do (including) events than it does to join a 1- or 2-person team and give that bonus to fewer people. And you **still** get the +25% Event XP once the bond occurs.
---
If you want to get three friends together and form a full team, go for it. But answer this question:
---
*Would you rather have a +75% bonus to Event XP of a +100% bonus to Event XP?*
---
Scout armor is classified as sturdy, so Thorn and Solar are likely the same.
---
Then again, this is FO76.  They might not even have a weight classification because someone forgot.
---
Oh no I don't want to get rid of it. This things one of my prized possessions now.
---
What, you really think there were no pants for women in 2077? Look at fucking FO4 character creation. The female character? Wearing pants.
---
Oh yeah, forgot about those
---
It gives the impression that there are going to be people who will show up to events. For example, I wasn't a part of any team, but I was on a server where there was a full events team. Project Paradise pops up, and I go to it, and waited around until the last minute before starting it, no one showed up. None of the players on that full events team showed up to the only event happening on the map at that moment. 
---
If you're not going to do events, then join a building team or one of the other teams where you actually reap the benefits of a full team and aren't communicating that there is a possibility for some of the hard events succeeding because there are full event teams on servers.
---
Seriously lol. I’d love for new enemies and higher levels. Apparently the latter is coming though.
---
Where are the daily ops at??
---
The thing is this would take so much more time than just nerfing the current meta. Bloodied will still be the best even with the current nerfs on the PTS. Bethesda is lazy to begin with and won't do things that take unnecessary longer.
---
You're right they weren't. They were 30 years before that.
---
Just like with ESO's bottomless crafting bag, FO76's scrapbox was never going to be a part of the base game. It's up to the developers to choose what to use to incentivize subscriptions to cover server costs and ongoing development. Along with the others, the scrapbox is a fair one to include. They are running a business and they have to cover server costs and payroll. Nothing is free. The more enticing the subscription is, the more likely they stay afloat and we have a game that continues to run.
---
If the only fun thing in the game is harassing other players then go find a new game. Probably a singleplayer one, to protect other players from you.
---
Yeah, I think my commando may use the INT one (she’s an INT build). She also has matching armors, so those may swap in.
---
For the Retribution, I’m thinking things like Queen where a block on a wing slap is easy ... anyone on PTS know anything about the mechanics?
---
Don’t apologize. The team leader can remove anyone they want, and there’s nothing stopping them from getting three friends together and having their own full team.
---
I feel you I often use the come here emoji when I'm at an event but people don't seem to be up for it. I'm happy to do it solo as I mainly join a team for the buffs but it would be nice to do a proper event team play.
---
Hold on... This is a cheap game.
---
I only paid for the game I didn't choose to pay for the privilege of a private server cause I didn't see the point.
---
I have enjoyed all the Fallout games and think this is clearly the best and the good value if you play it as a game and not a competition. Fallout 1st is an expensive privilege but you have a choice.
---
The other costs are for Sony online subscriptions which on a deal are usually £35/40 which is still cheap.
---
Many other games will hit you for all the patches and updates but not Bethesda (yet)
---
Again, we have a choice to pay extra to get ahead faster in the game... But you don't have too.
---
Infact, you don't have to play Fallout 76 at all.
---
Most games have issues and always will but at least Bethesda is trying to make the game better for everyone.
---
But hey.. Just my view. 😎
---
oh yeah because what we need more of is vigins melting SBQ before everyone can tag it
---
This season looks so much better than the last one. CANT WAIT!!
---
Yeah I had never tried that either lol. I bought it without thinking about it and then I realized I've never seen one sold before. I just hope it wasn't a hacked item or anything. Everything on it seemed legit but I dropped it just in case lol
---
You make some good points, but what about all the players who just like playing how its meant to be played? That would be like banning all players who opened presents just because some people duped them
---
I loaded onto my camp once and everything was destroyed. I was confused because there wasn’t another player nearby. 
---
Did some research and I came up with two conclusions. I loaded into a server that had previously been nuked in that area, or somebody came to my camp and threw a couple of explosive baits.
---
bashing is one of the the magic effects on the shotgun. increased resistance while blocking is the magic effect on armor
---
They will if enough people start talking about it
---
I use a lever gun and fixer with hardened receivers.  They both benefit from rifleman perks.  A handmade does almost as much damage as the fixer, but has a bit less recoil if you like to aim down sights.
---
You mean they fixed the auto healing bug?  Good thing, too.
---
I shoot 'em in the knee.
---
Why does it matter how other people choose to play?  I'm not being rude but it doesn't affect others unless you pvp which is an optional extra
---
No worries much appreciated. Just curious why you couldn't move them. No lighting problems here.
---
Last night I just joined the event as they were taking the queen down and I got a 2* aae fixer didn't even fire a shot lol
---
They're constant at least: "Hey, Fallout 76 Veterans! We want to share a gift that shows you how much appreciation and respect we have for you all. Now we haven't bothered to test it before release, you're not allowed access to most of it, and we're not interested in fixing it to make it useable for you. Thanks for playing!"  lmao: their company's operating procedures are straight from a VaultTec manual :-P
---
So was the flag for a day so who knows. Why bullshit and say we got 160 million and then not finish the lie and let us fail. Makes no sesne
---
I'd be happy if a light on one side of a wall didn't light up the other side. Tactical light placement solely to hide this shouldn't be a thing.
---
The monorail train the portion nearest to the highschool in watoga left side of the train as your walking to the west in a box with a salt shaker a female skeleton is leaning over next to it
---
I'll max stealth damage on day 1 because it's a must obviously. Then will go for STR and AGI. This will perfect my build and give me some quality of life and less restrictions. The other three i'll go full qol,so I think the hacker/picklock one, rad resist and maybe poison resist. 
---
Honestly the rest look totally useless to me.
---
I'm referring to the Legendary loot from the Sasquatch. All the metal piles were just robot junk.   
---
I've had this happen from time to time, but never back to... just frustrating.
---
If you actually want to maximize XP (the primary purpose of Building and Event teams), then your team leader should be switching the team goal regularly between those two.
---
And there is often more than one event active. I’ve joined an Event team and just focused on workshop defenses. 
---
If you want to do the harder events, then do what we did before Public Teams; get a group together to do that. And fill up your teams.
---
I'm afraid you'll have to stick with bloodied build damage nerf or not. +15 to all stats from unyielding pieces isn't something you want to miss
---
iirc you just need to aim at the ammo machine a certain way and hit a button at the right time to blueprint it, it's harmless.
---
The best thing to do is to loot his body immediately if you can before it explodes and flies half a mile away. If it does fly to space, you can try the tricks that the others have posted. Have lost his body his few times tho. It sucks lol
---
My point is though that these aren’t just people who are knowingly doing it because any bloodied build are probably going to put this perk and mutation on...because it just makes logical sense to have but doing so gives you this ability inadvertently
---
Stealth builds. I love them. And PA heavy weapons.
---
Neither does advertising a power armour skin with a 50 cal and combining them makes you blind haha
---
Hopefully your right, people need their sweet sweet score
---
Oh, why am I not even surprised?
---
What do you mean? Have you tried running a pistol build none bloodied? Complete garbage. I couldn't even do enough damage to sbq to get credit for the event.
---
I hear what your saying, but if Bethesda fixed the bug then they wouldn't have to affect all the other players
---
What can any of us do about it?
---
But do they drop ammo from the weapon you kill with? Like if I used a tesla to get them all to 1hp then fast swing speed melee do I get fusion cells or nothing?
---
I'm aware of what you were referring to. I ran the event this morning and the Legendary Imposter Sheepsquatch body turned into one of those melted metal piles.
---
And if there are only Building Teams with one or two people and an Event team with 3, then my sharing of Inspirational 3 helps more people, and my Bodyguards card is more effective. 
---
Another factor is the **level** of the players on the team. If they’re below 30, they’re less likely to be running mutations, so my Strange in Numbers is less likely to work.
---
Bloodied users were exploiting a system that didn't work, one which gave them an unfair advantage over other builds. "But bloodied builds are low-health!!" No - "Kill Everything" builds are below 20%, Bloodied means that as you take damage your damage goes up.
---
When people take advantage of exploits as hard as many FO76 players have there will be an impact. And if you've never been at an event where a Bloodied user one-shots everything before anyone else can get a tag in you'll realize that how others play does directly effect us.
---
I was going to upvote but then i saw the r/redditmoment edit
---
Every one is clearing Daily Ops in -10min, wich is pretty fast, overworld (west tek, etc...) takes 50 more bullets more or less, boss creatures like the mirelurk queen and behemoths take pretty much the same, they feel like previous fallout games, we now have a legendary perk for mass ammo production and the only 2 things that are really spongy are earl and the queen, wich in my opinion seems like a good idea so players dont spam their events making their rewards become more unique, kind of like what happened to the bear and fixer plans, imo harder bosses (not soloable) is a good thing for the health of the game.
---
Ps. Everything was tested with both a bloodied commando and a full health vampire shotgun build.
---
Farm junk for ammo in FO76 or watch football, even if it is just pee wee football with no fans present and I have to wear a mask... I pick watch football 🙂
---
I can totally see What Rads on a full-health build, either a PA or Solar kind of tank.
---
Do the poison perks work in PA, or just matching non-PA.
---
The damage numbers that pop up are not especially accurate and don’t always  correlate with the damage actually being done. BE gat plas doesn’t appear to do great damage per shot, but it is doing much better than it appears
---
It is if you don't use standard weaponry like pistols, rifles and the like
---
Yes unless its fusion cores
---
I jumped in a server and was in the last health bar of the queen so I joined fight and got a 3 star furious bag. Ugh. And a two star furious war drum. Lol oh well I’m glad it worked out for you
---
Well. Jack is alright lol. I’m on 90 with today’s daily’s to come. So I don’t actually care 😂
---
Pretty sure we got exactly what was in the photo when they showed us the outfit we get...
---
Power user perk in intelect
---
I can see people doing that. I personally join teams to shop around and not spend caps sometimes too. If I'm not going to do events solely, then I join a building team so I don't take the spot from someone who wants to do events.
---
I think the legendary run season has put too many people into grind mode. I've done all the dailies and weeks (skipping a few NW), plus played like normal instead of mass grinding and I don't feel burnt out and at level 90 in the season. Most of the heavy xp grinders get to level 100 about ages ago. 
---
If I were you I'd put the game down, maybe check out collosal problem and meat week but start playing something else. If I'm honest if everyone just grinds then to Bethesda it will come across like that is the game we want.
---
Arktos Pharma labcoat?
---
I got all of my shit through trading. Sorry you're an unlikable, broke bitch. Why is it our problem you can't afford first?
---
Not sure I’d prefer it, but another alternative would be to drop bloodied from 20 to 10 percent.
---
I've wondered this a few times then the other day I noticed that my intelligence team that I was the leader of randomly turned into an events team. 
---
Must be a bug but could explain what's happening.
---
I may actually go more Luck and fit in a few more luck perks as that’s DPS and not maxed.
---
You tried running bloodied pistol build? It still suck balls. It's the pistol not bloodied
---
Bash Damage is a prefix on the weapons I believe. The armor effect you are thinking of is 15% Blocker. Any shotty, even non legendary, will act as a magic weapon with that effect active.
---
Check for robot bodies because twice I found it and it looked like a robot. I had wendigo colossal be a pile of goo saying it was a regular one after searching for 30 minutes I finally found it
---
Which wasn't craftable upon it's release, and the set is still missing 50% of the outfit (the hat)
---
One thing I wish I knew early on when I started is that scrapping guns unlocks mods for them, so if you have a favorite gun like a 10mm pistol, try to loot as much of them as you can and then scrap them at a crafting station so you can unlock magazine mods with higher rounds per magazine or receivers that raise the damage the gun can do
---
That's smart thanks for the tip
---
If Bethesda made it so everybody gets legendary loot from enemies it wouldn't affect anything and there are plenty of enemy NPC's to go around
---
right now I'm running a sneak comando/rifleman build so I'm planing to use at least the agility/luck/perception lego perks to keep that build and shift the extra points to strength and endurance so I can switch to a meele/heavy weapon when needed (for example on daily OPS you can't use sneak and tere's some random modifiers that forces you to kill with meele).
---
they boosted it to rebalance the farming/shooting and make it more right. Now that it changes it needs to be boosted again.
---
The legendary perks should be used for bonuses only for example: the lockpicking/hacking legendary perk gives you the bonus of not needing to change regular perks. It s not right to make a legendary perk mandatory to have the same balance farming/shooting as before patch, it s not a bonus, it s just creating an issue and solving it by wasting players perk coins
---
People here not realizing there damage is going to be hella nerfed too lamo. It's going to make off meta builds useless 😂
---
Explosions shouldn’t impact already dead bodies, including the one exploding, the “realism” aspect is simply ridiculous
---
The hat was never in the photo when they told us what we were getting... 
---
That’s my point. They said we were getting an outfit, and showed us a picture of said outfit, and then they gave us... that outfit.
---
Why not run junkies tho, if you use correct chems, there is literally no downsides
---
If they fix the bug though lol it’s existed since launch but I wish they would because bloodied right is like walking around as superman with no kryptonite. You never die so you never have to carry around stimpacks which cuts down on even first aid or travelling pharmacy perks. There doesn’t even exist a small minute drawback currently. 
---
Even without quality of life perks with power armor You can still rock 300+ weight and with mutations like carnivore you don’t have to worry about slow metabolizer especially if you run nukes a lot you can survive off entirely ionized meat so carrying loads of food or even cooking no longer becomes a problem. Like everything can be optimized so you have no trade offs
---
There's already a comic shop in Watoga.
---
It's the reward from rose's quest. I'd wager it's special.
---
oh, seems like it would take a while to die to spike traps
---
About the same, still got 1 weekly to do as well.
---
Multiplication is just multiple addition bro youre saying Bethesda can't do basic math. It's not crypto
---
As I’m thinking about it, it maybe makes more sense if you’re going to max something at 15 to actually back it down and put the points there so you can spread the others out a bit as needed. Hmm.
---
I would assume we did.
---
It wasn't a great idea to end/start the event on a weekend when no one was going to look at the counter or update the web site.
---
Bomber Jacket.
---
Want to wear one? Cool you can, but you're going to run around in your underwear if you do.
---
I never knew that even existed until you told me and there are lots of other players who don't. It's not just bloodied that will be nerfed though, that's just a part of the major nerf
---
Thank god we don’t have guilds where you have to submit resumes too.
---
Never, I don't think they will care to fix the invisible uncraftable headpiece.
---
Really?
---
I'd suggest low health (\~50%) Vampires.  You'll still get unyielding stats and you'll hardly ever die.  It is more fun than you might think just charging into a room and destroying everything without a hint of stealth.
---
For the SBQ, maybe switch to AA or TSE using the same build.  With the coming nerfs, AA will be much more viable than it is now.
---
There are a lot of excuses you can put forward - but the time for excuses seems to be passed, as changes are being made based on performance.
---
 Sorry to hear that people are upset about their "Kill Everything" builds being made more reasonable. I am happy to know that the one-shotters are getting pissy about losing their advantage and having to play the game like us unBloodied plebs, though
---
That’s crazy good! Where’s the location?
---
see even with the reusable assets, that still takes time. Think of the poor developers that work in a double A studio bro
---
I have. It's not as bad. At least viable then. I had to switch cuz the pistols don't out put enough damage for them good ones not to have a silencer
---
Same here 😞 first time I got hit by this bug.
---
Sell things you aren’t using. Stop hoarding.
---
It’s just a matter of deciding what your *really* need to keep in your stash.
---
Just moved there, it looks perfect! Thank you very much!
---
Yup just lost 1250 again total is 2500 lost to this crap.
---
The current system works like this: 
---
Level up -&gt; Gain Perk Cards (9 every 5 levels) -&gt; Scrap Perk Cards for Coins
---
The middle bit is deterministic, always 9 perk cards every 5 levels. So why not skip the middle man? The bonus oof is the fact that some people may have spent levelups on SPECIAL changes, which now robs them of perk coins. Not having to scrap perk cards would solve this.
---
Just give us 5 to 10 perk coins per level and be done with it. It's no rocket science. I know that Bethesda want's to do something with extra perk cards, but this isn't a good solution. Having too many perk cards is a tiny issue, fixing it is not worth ruining Legendary Perk Cards.
---
Eh, I’ve heard that junkies is good, and I prefer not being a 1 shot for the wendigo boss and the queen
---
I was not intending to insult junkies, I just think they should boost damage for junkies as  use my junkies weapons in the forest as the damage output is lower than bloodied. My point is that farming for ammo or the junk to craft it is not the fun part of the game.  Bethesda seems to tend towards trying to distract players with farming to make up for boring content and redundant dailies.
---
another character..
---
Oh right! I completely butchered it, but that was exactly the effect i had in mind!
---
The ghillie suit is equally terrible: it blocks out over 50% of the pip-boy's display when you use it. The game is UNPLAYABLE with a ghillie suit equipped.
---
unless its very rare like ballistic fiber or something you use constantly crafting/building.. dont keep any more than 75-100 max of any given junk item.. you probably dont need that 800 glass
---
check your misc tab for unsmelted ores and gunpowder.. people often overlook these when considering their weight issues
---
Haha, that’s pretty great. 
---
 I personally don’t really dig PVP, just never been my thing. I love working together with other players in 76 but PVP is just lame in a game with such imbalance between builds, weapons and perks(NW). I’ve never played NW and don’t really plan to. 
---
 So yesterday some guy with a legacy exploding gatling plasma takes over my red rocket workshop. I fast travel to the workshop, contest his claim, hop all the way up to one of the highest points in the workshop and put on the stealth suit. He ends up calling a buddy over so that he can find my location so I just block his buddy for the session. So neither one of them knows where I am but no one can have the workshop until someone dies or leaves. I was done with my daily score and had time to kill so I just wait it out. They’re running all over trying to find me, but eventually get bored and leave. Aaaand the workshop is mine again. Ha.
---
Other shit things like how I lost over 30 perk card packs that I had stored up and now are just gone without me being able to open them and if I got another it just only shows that I own one. SMH I hope they never implement this
---
Well done!
---
I know this will cause false fags but Bethesda should add in a measure so if a weapon can't have X mod or simply can't exist, then it instantly get deleted when you equit it. 
---
Yea people who spent $100+ plus can no longer use it then but they still have it and to me seems like the most fair way around the problem.
---
Nice. Love nuka 'nades.
---
Yeah, I was actually going to say, it'd be cool to see a full on marine RP, since the armor basically just got thrown into 4 with little explanation. 
---
Maybe run as a heavy/commando build with the LMG and the assault rifle (which I've always thought looks like a LMG, even though it's not.)
---
Eeh dps in this game,for what? SBQ and the colossus? They're not worth perk points imo,unless that's all you do everyday.my 11 luck already got me covered for damage and crit damage.
---
You just sound like a try hard douche.
---
Anytime!
---
It's not just bloodied builds getting nerfed.
---
There is?  Where?
---
Easy. U let one bunch of guys design and create a world called fallout. Let me make up the story line and the lore and make a couple of games. Then you let bethesda continue the series

All of these ideas are so fucking perfect. When I downloaded the Slocums Joe stuff for fallout 4 it always got me in the mood for breakfast and donuts. Give me a coffee maker too and I can have a full breakfast along with my character. Having a farm that actually produce what a farm would is just cool for role-playing as well. All of these ideas are just good and should be added.
---
If I was to change then probably junkies would be the preferred out of the 2. I’ll most probably look into it at some point.  Do you know the best place to check a junkie’s build out or what best armour/weapon is for junkie?
---
I tried doing that but the textures still aren't showing up on the meshes.
---
The wire is necessary but the terminal is not. You can cycle through the colors simply by 'clicking' the bulb after placing it.
---
First world problems, man. First world problems. The great thing about this is that you learned on the PTS what to do and what not to do. By the time this change goes live, maybe you'll have an exact plan in place to make best use of all available resources at your disposal. I wish I had that many points available to spend.
---
I'm currently using a vampires "magic" double barrel and a piece of blocking armour. Added to the firework reload glitch... Well.. Say No More. 😁👍😁💣💣💣
---
Not even 1 level but yeah it sucks a lot
---
They literally only take a few extra shots though.  Not 200 bullets.
---
I’ve just looked at mine and it adds up to 1500.
---
This is the first time that it has happened to me.
---
The other dailies are half completed except one.
---
Yeah I suppose your right but if you have a bloodied build yourself I would check to see if you have those things on because it’s not 100% guaranteed not to die but it’s like 95% to the point where I can sit next to the queen being attacked while an army of supermutants shoots me and I’ll have instant health regen. Only thing these players have to be worried about is poison damage so mirelurks are like the only thing that will kill them.
---
I know I didn’t notice for a long time until I came across a video and was like oh that why I’m basically invincible
---
I miss the days of being handed a level 10 quest that is surrounded by no less than 18 lvl 43 ghouls and a 3 star radioactive lvl 55 legendary ghoul.
---
That Chinese Sword is never going to happen, Mistress.
---
I think the frustration is that many people have played this game so long that the next step was getting perfect gear. And many like myself have done or almost done that. So nerfing some thing we worked hard to achieve feels like we are being taken from.
---
Do pistols work fine for the medics effect and damage if I want to be heavy on vats or what do you think? Would be interesting to know what you are using, probably heavy and power armor?
---
Ran today and got the freeze effect instead of the invis, and had a great deal more fun. It's also much, much more fun with a group.
---
I'm melee big guns and dont care for any of the bloodied and junkie stuff or whatever. I use unyielding and furious or something like that but I just like questing and playing with my buddy. Never touched a serum or any of the radiated stuff. I just cure it and move on. I'm always late to VG parties in a sense because I'm always busy with real life shit, so I just play with my own house and GI Joes ya dig?
---
Last night was the first time I bought with actual money, somethin from the atomic shop since the beta. It wasn't even my money. 
---
Case in point I'm kind of a slower player like just not great at the grind mechanics and I dont look up the best builds or anything. I feel like it trivializes the game when you can just kill something in one or two hits.
---
That being said I dont mind other players doing so but I wish it would drop loot for me too cuz as a melee build, damn...
---
Either that or make a perk that I can throw my Death Claw Gauntlet to poke the enemies.
---
Side note I honestly just wish I could be traveling trader with my own personality and sell stuff and hire players as mercs and make my own job etc...sigh.
---
Yeah it’s in a room behind the collapsed floor ramp, where the hole in the ground is for the breaker cord. Right above the gate doors to get to the elevator. It’s on a desk across the room with the nuka cola machine 
---
As you can tell, I have spent too much damn time in the asylum
---
Or play together? My wife and I grind together and my daughter (6 years old) plays an alt on my wife's account. My daughter got her first NW kill last night while I was getting my lockpick done. If you play for fun and with people who are also having fun the grind is much less grindy.
---
The new enemies aren't restricted to events, just FYI
---
Killed "Relentless" stingwing in Whitespring earlier
---
Right behind Phoenix, down the alley with the Protectron lounge area.
---
Bait Bombs are hit-or-miss atm. Some days/some servers they work like small tactical nukes, and some they just pop and smoke unattractively. Keep following them to different servers until they DO work. Lots of speculation about needing some form of animal *near* the target base to get them to work properly, but testing is 50/50. Good luck fellow Anti-Griefer.
---
I think you made a solid argument. Most speculation I've seen talks about how grindy it is, and yeah it should be. I do believe a lot of players don't have that much time to put into the game. But I think that's more so with the current state of daily caps on everything. I'm also pretty excited about One Wasteland. Spent a LOT of early quests being stuck after fighting a level 68 mob I'd think was a boss or something, or just running for my life using all my stims. Perk cards are pretty OP after reading them all through. Let's see what happens.
---
yes you are right it is 1500 i have a post up on here as well
---
Funny, from where I sit all the incessant XP grinding has led to a lot of toxic behaviour where people are abusing the spawn mechanics at events in order to grind more XP (Line in the Sand) or are ignoring the actual event goals making them fail (Radiation Rumble and One Violent Night, anyone?) because they care only about wringing the maximum amount of XP out of the mob spawns.
---
Treasury Notes brought people together for the public events at least. The SCORE XP grind has undone a lot of that.
---
Nice, ill check it out when i get home from work
---
Supposedly it happens when you log out when somebody is still using your vendors - anti duping related probably
---
I haven't heard an uproar from the Mutant's community, the players who use Slayer's weapons,  the Support Builds, or the Food Builds yet. I've also never seen a Mystress of Mystery clear out a Line In The Sand event while low-levels were unable to join in
---
On the point of the SPECIAL boosting ones ... I can see those going for DPS, then swappable out for convenience. IE, you don’t keep that STR Legendary on all the time but after you pick up a bunch of mess, swap in some STR and a weight reduction perk or two
---
Okay that is definitely powerful, but that's the same type of thing as the current magic w3ps.
---
Really though? Next to the queen with all her minions?
---
My main isn't ethier, best way to discribe it would be a jack of all traits as he can use all weapons. 
---
The main difference from him to my bloodied build is instead of 1 shotting most thing, it takes like up to 5 extra bullets.
---
People just follow metas though. They don't think if it's fun or anything. Just what ever gives them high DPS.
---
Nah man, thank you for speaking my points exactly and understanding them and in all honesty I be you'll be in the same boat as me and many others sometimes soon but good luck and have fun man!
---
Yeah that's got to be what it is. I hope anyway lol
---
Yeah, it seems to be everywhere, not just the daily ops. Used 3 bullets to take down an enemy, got seven of the same type of their body. Not every time, but frequent enough.
---
I am wrong it's not 1250 its 1500 lost getting tired of playing this game.
---
They work for power armor, yeah. And the perk condition only checks for five matching pieces of armor, so PA can use it with just one mismatched piece (like the Father Winter Helmet I'm using with my T-65).
---
As a high level bloodied build, I'll counter that I can easily one shot everything except the SBQ and Sheepsquatch with Vampire's weapons.
---
August 16th, 2020 and it’s still glitched. 😡😡😡😡
---
INT build, I pillaged from Luck and Agility (and Strength). And yes, queen and colossus.
---
Vanguard armor, weapons of your choice, or you can be PA junky. With addictions, best to stick with charisma addictions, including alcohol. Dont be afraid to be addicted to medx, while guides tell you not to, -10Dr debuff is nothing. Daddy-o, calmex, alcohol, med-x and mentants. And its all constant damage vs furious, which needs to build up
---
Vanguards?  Before i went bloodied, i had a hodgepodge of scout armor i.e. zealots, troubleshoots, mutant slayer etc.  I rarely died...do a hodgepodge with Secret Service and itll be amazing.
---
You don't need players in an event team to play events for you to get the buffs of said team. That's the beauty of public teams. There's no hurting you or anyone else if you join. Only helping. Play and let play!
---
Small favor. Wonder if it works w/ a Scout mask ;-) It’d be fantastic if it worked just off some word in the text string of the name ... ;-)
---
Well with what I have played on the PTS I will be forced to switch away from melee unless I play in an actual team (which I don't) because some things just need so many hits that I get swarmed instantly without really being able to do anything about it and the damage isn't worth it if you have ranged options that do much more DPS without the risk of being swarmed being anywhere near as bad, I really hope they make more adjustments before it goes live as it could be a good change
---
Tbh the unyielding armor is nice but not necessary. Maybe after the overall dmg nerf this is the way to go with unarmed melee or melee in generel but I ran a full unyielding armor set since release and switched a month back to a full weightless armor set. By far the best decision I made. I have no trouble with my weight because my strength stat is always the same, I still hit for over 1k dmg with unarmed melee weapons, range weapons are also still the same dmg wise and Im invisible doesn't matter if standing or sneaking and still low health playstyle.
---
It's a shame too because when you use the cryolater on her it does t usually give you enough damage for a decent reward.
---
No, Adrenal Reaction and Nerd Rage need nerfs.  Bloodied isn't the problem.
---
As much as I hate it, and I do think they went a bit too far, the way Bethesda is handling it is probably the right way.
---
How is it more money spent? Atom shop stuff is all account and not character bound. You wouldn't be spending more money. The point of multiple characters if for different builds. Why make the same character twice?
---
Yeah, I know right? I don't understand why many other Bloodied players are so focused on losing their one trick when there are so many other ways to be OP without having to be part of a special economy or to luck out with the RNG. At least now we can all be OP together if we choose to be, no matter the build
---
Reminds me of destiny lol
---
Yup I swear I’m not even exaggerating it....you can go to the bathroom while sitting afk and as long as a mirelurk king dosent come by I’d probably be safe because there is no perks for resistance to poison so they wreck. Or another example would be like nuking white springs and sitting in a 20+ group of glowing ones can’t kill you either
---
Nocturnal bone
---
It's going to cost you coins every time you swap out a legendary perk
---
Does the experience required to level up go up past 100+? I thought it would stay the same. That's dumb.
---
I’ve tried this several times at players camps that were being total jerks and not once have they actually exploded. They just sit there.
---
Wiki says they unlock starting at level 50, and new ones at 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300. 
---
But I heard someone say something about level 1000 can someone explain? If it's only to 300 that doesn't seem too bad
---
Food build
---
Nah it's an example of what was originally just bad game design now being exploited by studio executives in an attempt to make a quick buck.
---
It was a decent enough idea that was abandoned.  It’s not you, it’s Bethesda.
---
Dont worry about PvP you can even disable it in the settings called passive mode.
---
That is insanely powerful, if there's a problem though why not Nerf that effect instead of needing the whole build. I'm serious though, I'm not meaning to have this all about bloodied builds
---
This is the answer.  Keep no more then X amount of anything.   Keep a little more of things you use a lot of and less of things you don’t use.   
---
Make bulking and selling a habit every other play session.    
---
Do not keep extra gear that is not legendary.   And only keep legendary gear that you are using or that you know has good trade or selling potential.  Example do not keep that 1 star bloody Gatling laser, or anti armor Gatling gun.   They are not worth the weight for 5 script.   Script them.
---
To maximize the spawn mechanics you need to pick stuff up.   You just need to get used to dropping stuff you won’t use or can’t sell quickly.   
---
Lastly look at your ammo stash.   Again get rid of what you done use.   Things like nukes, missiles, 40mm, and cores add up.   If you don’t use them drop them.
---
I've been running a Vampire's low health build for a while now because I don't need the huge damage of bloodied anymore.  I get more use from the health buff since I oneshot most anything anyway.  It's been surprisingly good.
---
That happens to me too from time to time. They don't even despawn, for some reason.
---
You wouldn't have hands to reload, let alone pull the trigger, that's the next atom shop purchase.
---
9/10 of my dailies were completed yesterday when I signed in, and it said I had already killed 3/5 creatures in Nuclear winter.  This isn't the first time I have lost score points like that. So  last week I  figured I'd   just go ahead and spend the atoms that I had earned from the legendary run on buying levels.  It bought me  seven levels.   In addition to that I spent 300 more atoms I had from Fallout first.  I wanted to earn my way to the end through grinding without spending atoms, but I don't see how I can do that when the game is continually  cheating me out of points  with auto completion. Anyway last week I spent atoms buying nine levels and completed the run today.   Like I said, I hadn't planned on spending atoms but I wanted to reach the end sooner rather than later and that's hard to do when you are continually being cheated out of score points. Yeah I know about the 10,000 XP thing for 100 points. That doesn't make up for the points lost from auto completion.  The 10,000 XP bonus ***are additional points that you could be earning if the auto completion bug wasn't happening.***
---
All good info! How is the xp in there? Is it toned down like it was for v94?
---
Oh that would never do, I like Polly's helmet.
---
Same thing with PA headlamps on certain skins pointing to the right, it will never be fixed no matter how many times I report it.
---
Works for three dailies for me. Abandoned functionality
---
We did on the current page it says it's unlocked
---
I had the same thing yesterday on ps4! Was this near summersvile?
---
Help me out with that - once you have it leveled you can’t swap it with another you’ve leveled?
---
No fucking way... I thought this couldn't be real. How did this get through? They are literally not playtesting anything...
---
Low level ammo supply issues has been a thing since launch. You're in the "hard" stage. It gets way easier over level 40. Levels 15-40 is where you struggle the most.
---
I think it's supposed to be like a small reward for people who already play so much they're getting into the hundreds. As opposed to being a goal that you grind for.
---
Uh.. thanks but no thanks. Considering how easylie cars explode in the Fallout-Universe If you do as much as farting in their rough general direction I would prefer NOT to put one of those in my Camp as long as the fusion-engine is still inside.
---
It's just the assaultron helm but with a sticker, so not a huge miss. But it is neat
---
If this is the state of the anti griefer super soldiers I think we are in fine hands. Truly a heroic sacrifice you've made to make up for your complete incompetence .
---
IMO, after level 80, the game becomes the Sharknado of the gaming world.
---
Where you expect them to test their stuff out wtf
---
I believe the prime directive is to increase daily player counts by any means necessary. Since they seem to struggle to roll out new content with any regularity, the only way to increase daily engagement is with a grind. This also coupled with the fact it's obvious the developers don't play the game beyond some brief lunchtime "testing," is why decision making is so out of step with the player base. I also believe there is a smattering of arrogance in that they essentially ignore PTS comments and treat it as background noise. In my opinion, the game is headed in the wrong direction. What little fun was left is having the life sucked out of it in favor of grind.
---
Take a look at [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/htmlview) . I don't think it's perfect - for one thing you'll need more acid if you plan to make ammo - but it's a decent place to start.
---
The community for FO76 is a great one in general.  I still find it amusing that Bethesda thought we wanted a big PVP open-world game but we all eschewed the PVP so much that Survival got taken down, all of the PVP stuff for Adventure mode has been nerfed into oblivion, and even in Nuclear Winter a whole lot of people spend most of the match hiding in bushes avoiding notice.
---
The moonjumping is the marsupial serum.  If you don't find it in someone's vendor store or manage to get it from mutating due to too many rads, once you're done with the Enclave part of the main storyline, you can purchase the recipes for the serums from MODUS.
---
But otherwise, just play the game as you want to play it.  Power-level or just meander around the map doing things as you find them.  It's all up to you!  There's no right or wrong way to play.  (The current Season is going to be done in a month so you probably won't be able to finish the game board without using Atoms, but there are still some cool items at the lower levels you can complete daily and weekly challenges for!)
---
There are OP builds like bloodied and junkies but, from experience, I will tell you that you don't have to make those builds your personal goal for the game.  I run around with my legendary spears and lever action rifles and, while I don't exactly melt the SBQ like some can, I can get some good damage on her and definitely mow through everything else on the map (except yao guai...don't let anyone tell you deathclaws are the big baddies anymore! lol).
---
Edit:  I will come back and say this:  Read everything (if you have the time) and LOOK around you.  A lot of the story of West Virginia is found by just experiencing the games, especially the bodies or items you find, along with the notes on the computer terminals.  Heartbreaking at times.
---
🤷🏼‍♀️ It's a game not a dick, don't take it so hard man
---
Thats why you use someone else's hands ;)
---
The Scout mask doesn't have the keyword the perks check for a matching set, no.
---
Yeah sorry I should have been a bit more specific and maybe I went a bit astray from your main point it’s just such an easy exploit to accidentally do for that specific build. It’s like a carpenter not having a hammer and a screwdriver in his tools. Like it’s that common to have in the build so a good portion of bloodied builds have it already but your correct that the exploit needs to be patched primarily and that should help balance it. 
---
Actually it has been finally patched in the last update never mind! Haven’t played in the last week or so :D if you were curious it was life giver and speed demon that allowed it
---
I honestly wouldn’t mind. It would finally force to move on with life lol
---
As someone who participated in PTS when the P still meant private: I am worried. Bethesda doesn't really listen to feedback, they just do their own thing and hold features back only if there's a massive stink (see: Legendary perks). Bugs go unaddressed despite report after report and eventually those bugs are pushed live, like when we reported the new Wastelanders VATS bugs over and over and yet here we are. We told them the rep grind was dull and dispiriting, we gave them countless great suggestions on how to make it better, and yet they just deployed their own shit knowing full well the community would be pissed.
---
It's almost like someone in developer leadership is more concerned about being "right" and getting their way than actually making the game better. Shame, really; with a bit more humility and a bit more open communication with the playerbase, they could make this game truly great.
---
I don't get it. "Poe tay toe, poe tay toe"?
---
Ah right, cheers.
---
Can confirm this happened to me today too. 1500 score i lost :(
---
So maybe he only uploads grieving videos where he "wins"?  Interesting.
---
Remove all mods from any weapon you're storing and not using. Do the same for armor, but also apply the ultra light mod to them to reduce weight even more.
---
They need to add perk coins as rewards from other events, like daily ops or boss events.
---
I like the oil lamps for warm orange light and the subway lights for direct. And the construction lights for bright light, which also goes through walls.
---
Sounds like you were on PS4 doing the event when I was there.. one dude was trying 5o give everyone a chance then other ass was running over doing a 1 shot on them.. the guy signaling and I both did the angry face.. I only got the 1st one because rude ass wasn't there yet.. everyone there hit the 1st one before he was killed...

I main a full health pa heavy gunner. I run vamps 90% of the time for the convenience of it. And pull out my junkies guns for stuff like the Queen or imposter (and switch to vamps when I need a heal lol). Level 363 now and have been using this build for a solid 200 levels of it
---
Steam lists the Settlers and Raiders packs as DLC, so I'm guessing where the confusion lies.
---
In regards to the reports being looked into I’m sure they get to it eventually. 
---
I assume what you saw is indeed a glitch that’s being exploited considering the first response to your post contains no substance and is just middle school naming calling regardless of how “factual” it may be.
---
Obviously my responses were of the same low bar quality and helped nothing but help me collect a bunch of downvotes. Nom nom nom. 
---
Now there’s a deleted post with a deleted response so you’ve definitely found a handful of people that don’t what it to be known and would rather shame you for bringing attention to the issue. 
---
If it’s not a glitch and is intended please someone inform us.
---
Did you sub to his YT channel?
---
No near Solomon's Pond!
---
Then why are you obligated to keep playing it again? 
---
Do whatever makes you happy I say
---
Kinda ironic that to reward early players, they gave us something that's partially broken and missing. Kinda like how the game released.
---
Oh Todd you old troll, you got us again
---
There is another good spot just northwest of the Big Maw. Looking at the map, you can see two small ridges northwest of the Maw. It is on the northern edge of the lower ridge. Use [this](https://fo76map.com/) and turn off all the filters but the junk one to help pinpoint it.
---
It’s been a while since I’ve been on the PTS but are the legendary perk cards even any good? They seemed pretty useless to me the first time I saw them, none that made me want to use them.
---
so it’s probably mine in particular thats bugged you think?
---
You're not alone. As much as I love exploring this game, the grind is getting to me. Now when I want to have fun in a Fallout setting I'll play the older titles, though I do gravitate more toward Fallout 4 than 3 or NV
---
Work on your Atom challenges. Use up glass for mollys and then sell them. Mod and unmod challenges. Crafting arrows with Super Duper and Ammo smith works well with new ammo converters. Either way there are a lot ways to offload that into xp and challanges. Try to work on when and where you're looting. Try and hoarde one ammo type. You most likely don't need a bunch of missles, mini nukes ect. Also, don't be afraid to run down supplies, never hurts to have a little bit of challenge back into the game. Oo also remembered Ultracite scrap isn't eorth keeping a lot of unless you're making ammo so keep like 50, and sell the rest to train station vendor for 5caps per. I'm at the point now I sit around 500 stash weight, have a full vending machine, and have room for a little wiggle.
---
I like the way you think, patching that would definitely help. I wonder if the devs secretly put it in for their own playing 😂
---
Thanks for answer - but boo ;-)
---
Do you happen to have the strangler set? I had seen someone say those perks didn't work with the v94 armour and would love to know that's not true haha
---
Nobody plans on playing Junkies. Nobody planned on dying of thirst and saving yourself by drinking those bottles of beer you find at the back of a bus whilst a pack of mole rats surround you. 
---
Those mole rates are now dead, and I'm still drunk.
---
I have been running a mutt build the whole game,   I am level 600.   You do not need any fancy build to have fun.    Instead build to what you find fun.
---
For the record I did dabble with bloody and junkies, but in the end they did not seem much different that any other build.   Some things took 2 shots instead of one.  But that was about it.   Leveling not withstanding.
---
If you want the hardest hitting,  you know what that is.    If you want hard hitting with high health you know what that is.   End of the day play what’s fun for you.
---
From my brief experience on the pts last night it seems like it is to at least some extent. Was still getting junk ammo I never use but the drop rate of ammo I was currently using was noticeably higher than it is in the normal game.
---
Sounds like the downvoters are salty.
---
Apparently in order to get anything from her you must do a minimum of 1000 points of damage yourself. I've been down there many times and not get anything because I wasn't attacking just her I was keeping the adds off everyone...
---
That sucks, Beth ought to spot you a level somehow, good luck
---
I did the math, I'm a Furious/Executioners build and the "nerf" barely affects me. I'm not losing much in the way of damage. You add Legendary perks into the mix and it'll be fine.
---
I’m on ps4 I’m sure that doesn’t matter.  It I’ll be playing just going about myself whether I’m in adventure or private world and i have issues connecting to the server and controls are lost then I get booted to the menu then it won’t log back into the game until I restart the game and wait about 15 minutes. It’s just frustrating that it seems to happen when I’m right at the end of a quest and have to do parts over again but lose my ammo and stuff that i used during.
---
Also, the new enemies are not restricted to these events, I killed a Relentless stingwing in Whitespring earlier...
---
This game can’t handle real hordes lol. Imagine the fps in a nuke zone with 50 ghouls
---
Do addictions wear off after so long and I need to keep taking something? Does sound like something that will work, defo not bloodied for me as I don’t think I could handle that low health without dying every min lol
---
I totally agree that is what Bethesda thinks or wants it to be.  The problem is, it technically isn't Bethesda's decision.  Once its out the door, the players decide how it will be consumed.  
---
**Getting Ranty Again.  Apologies and no will will directed at you**
---
With the Mr. Fuzzy outfit, there is a hard cap per day so burnout is limited.  It also doesn't award anything play style change or bonus so having it Day 1 vs Day 100 doesn't change much.  
---
The cards are something that can be ground for, and have a more direct effect on the game.  This puts it at a much higher probability of people actively wanting to grind for it or to look at the grind and just bounce off of it and ignore it in a bad way.  If they want it to be a grind, it needs to be moved closer.  I don't know by how much since I don't have the training or data for that.  But as a layman, I am fairly certain it needs to be closer then Level 800+ (assuming everyone has fiddled with a build at least some or lost cards to having them maxed) unless the xp curve is being **seriously** advanced in the coming seasons.  
---
A great example of this happening and being fixed with Trial of the Crusader raid in World of Warcraft.  Blizzard had four difficulty levels of the raid, each one dropped gear once per week.  They didn't think most raid groups would go after all four each week.  Many did and burnt out fast and unsubbed.  Blizzard eventually modified the lockouts so a group could only do 2 of the 4 each week.
---
But we all know people are going to try and grind those out as quickly as possible.
---
I did not really notice, was a little busy. That said, in my two runs, I know I hit the "gain 10k XP" once, so I suspect it is toned down (I was doing a lot of murdering)
---
But ya not sure if you saw my edit but apparently it has been patched now in the recent update! Life giver and speed demon no longer provide instant health regen :D
---
No but I plan on leaving comments haha
---
It would make sense if they lowered it to prevent a good place to farm haha. Thank you for the info!
---
aye. it's usually trapped outside of bounds. sometimes fast travelling to the event can fix it as well
---
I lost 2 Weeks because my xbox had to be repared. So 2500 is not so much.
---
Yeah that’s exactly what it is, looks like he tells everyone they have a shit build too and refers to everyone as salty. Also noticed him talking shit saying that everyone blocks him but he definitely blocked me after I said a few things that I reckon were close to home hahahaha
---
My main is a Stealth Sniper VATS but doesn't do a ton of damage. I have all of the Rifle related perks. Tormenter can trigger more often if maxed out for example.    
---
Gear is largely what makes a big boost. After 50, my char's effectiveness increased faster than before it. Now at level 104 and a good mix of gear I do quite well solo.    
---
I have two 3 star rifles; a Combat Rifle and a Lever Gun. I have a level 50 Fixer modded as best I can and a regular Combat Shotgun for backup and low level enemies.    
---
With my perks and playstyle I tend to 'go for the head' on most enemies. Most enemies die (and explode) in one shot 3 at the most. One piece of armor has 3 effects one of which is the Chameleon one and for me is essential to that character.    
---
Any build you put on Nukes and Dragons has a level by level perk suggestion list. I would highly sugges sticking to that 99.99% of the time. It is your char so variations are suggested. You can't be a Jack of All.    
---
END perks tend to be ease of life ones and would not suggest taking any unless you're doing a melee build. I would look at many builds before making one on that site. I HATE builds and gear which require the char to be weakened like that.
---
Sorry I didn't see the update, still shocked that was possible though. Doesn't that help rebalance that part of the system? :D
---
you're a FEMALE, you wear a skirt. Men wear pants.
---
Also here to say that it’s absolute bull to retroactively punish players like me who have experimented with different builds because of the complete lack of true respec system. The real irony here though is that the Legendary system is at complete odds with the Loadouts that are coming since we really want to spend as many perks as possible for coins, which is going to force specialisation over flexibility. Which is especially odd when you consider that Daily Ops are very much focused on making you switch up your play style/build in order to deal with different enemy Mutations.
---
Ideally, perk coins should be a supplemental resource, your main one being your level. I also feel like Overseer points from NW have been overlooked as another potential coin currency: I’m rank 86 and I’ve already collected every NW perk and have 100+ points spare which have no purpose. Seems like an easy win to me.
---
Right after we get that explosive replacement for energy weapons.
---
On the other hand, my femme self wants more skirts :( alot of the outfits I like only come in a pants version. I want my legs to be free
---
Sometimes there are multiple events going on but won't actually pop up on the map while also you can be in an event area like during Line in the Sand and while everyone else is in the event it won't actually be active for some people.
---
If it's too insane I'm not even gonna bother. There're too many good games to play out right now and really good single player/Co-op RPGs on the way that I'd rather spend my time on doing actual fun things. Wasteland 3 and Baldur's Gate come'n out soon for example.
---
Adding massive boring grind isn't good competition VS other games.
---
It happened to me I think it was a reset
---
This may help. Drop the .dll in the same folder as your Fallout 76.exe

Heavy weapons with Power Armor. Iam using it myself and i can kill most enemies in 1 to 3 shots.
---
I'm in the forest, they max at 25
---
That’s was easy. Thank you. We’ve been informed.
---
SOMEONE thinks there's going to be a flood soon
---
That has nothing to do with the game auto-completing the dailies when you stay on the game at reset yours is an Xbox issue
---
&gt; I do believe a lot of players don't have that much time to put into the game.
---
Which is why the grindy perks pays off. Even if you don't have the time to complete your daily challenges, or gather your rep, or treasury notes, or whatever, as long as you do SOMETHING in the game, you are being rewarded for it.
---
As it stands, if you can't do any daily missions due to time constraints, might as well not even log on, your not going to get anything for playing.
---
But with grindy legend perks, even 15 mins of killing stuff at top of the world, or doing a single event would be rewarding in some way
---
I was the same way till around level 200ish. Then I happened to get a god roll junky minigun... I've never turned back.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Yes i know but i want to say 2500 is not so bad.
---
If it feels like a job, and you don't like itz then stop playing it.
---
Ok, they are rare. ...but are they good?
---
scorchbeast's are easily distracted by shiny objects... Generally you need to go find it and coax it back in bounds again.
---
Oh my fuck that sounds so similar to my experience too, him just spraying the air in the hopes he’d hit me. 
---
But I agree, definitely the best way to deal with them!
---
I do but I’m not on the PTS.
---
Let's build it in Watoga then! I love Watoga
---
I've had an idea for high level, end game, and unique enemies. When you cause a status effect it has a % chance to mutate it. A normal non-legendary will go into a a Mutated non-legendary enemy real time. You see the change physically and in how it acts. If you blind it, then after a moment it mutates and learns echolocation. Cripple and arm? The damaged one heals really fast and then gains a new attack.    
---
The SBQ....if her wing gets damaged and she stays on the ground has a % chance to mutate and new wings grow that can shoot spikes and she can shield herself with them greatly reducing damage for a short while.
---
The ones in the mire I’ll FT to harpers ferry or my camp, give it a minute, and FT back and the SB will have spawned.
---
It was kinda strange, the server disconnected but as I was in a team I was able to get back onto the same server. When I did it said my camp couldn’t be placed but I still went on.  I checked the map and someone did have their camp there instead of mine. I carried on and fast travelled to their camp to see what it was like and when I got there it was my camp but I had the camp logo instead of vendor logo. Very strange.
---
I want clean underwear.
---
I missed it.....
---
I had this happen to me once. I found that if I logged in at least an hour after the challenge reset, I don't have any auto-complete. Hope this helps for the future.
---
Bethesda, you need to listen to what this post is saying.  I'm telling you, the legendary perks are  going end up like project Atlas, concrete edition.   Some people just won't bother with it. There are others  like myself who will put forth real effort, and sincerely want to get it done, but they give up in frustration because of it becomes tedious to the point of being demoralizing.  This whole system is a  big mistake. You need to rethink it.
---
I was one of the rare few defending the bullion grind system, but with this you really are crossing the line.
---
Same, I’ve only got maybe three steps to go to finish the scoreboard and I haven’t played NW once since starting this game. PvP just isn’t my thing.
---
What’s the line the settler wanderer says about looking on the bright side of life - but not the nuclear one?
---
and delete the ones that will never be useful. (Stalker Melee) &gt;.&gt;
---
I tried to do this but thr other players kill them all before my grenade detonates lol. Exploding weapon I guess
---
But what would you use the eggs for? There’s no recipe that uses chicken eggs.
---
I agree, I was hoping for eggs. So maybe they need to add a few recipes? Like Delberts Deviled Eggs. 
---
2 chicken eggs
---
1 spice
---
1 boiled water
---
Delberts Chicken Egg Salad sandwich
---
1 razor grain flour
---
1 mutfruit
---
1 chicken thigh
---
Also I was hoping at least 1 chicken would be B out walking around like the Brahmin
---
I get what you are saying but some game builders or makers hold there self to higher standers for crap that has been going on this whole time this event has been out. At the point were complaining dose no good cause they can't even give back what was lost on the screw-up
---
The new nerfs are probably going to need tuning. I have a ton of QOL things i'll have to sacrifice to try and get enough dps to solo as bloodied. I may not keep playing if it forces me into PA and heavy guns.
---
They don't have any vendors up :-(
---
Noooo that's too reasonable a way to think about it. If it's in the game then everyone has to grind for it! Don't you know we all play this game the same exact way?
---
Totally me
---
Make diff chars if you want diff builds mmo 101
---
I would honestly welcome new recipes and plans be added to the game. I want Brahmen noodles.. x1 noodle cup x1 spices x1 brahmen meat..
---
Yeah it made no sense why it worked but it must have had to do with something regarding the negative effects of speed demon because when you drink the mutation serum and it suppresses the negative effects for 1 hour it doesn’t work even with life giver perk on so that must have been the problem. But yeah that certainly helps balance the bloodied builds :)
---
I love doing this to asshole bloody Bois, it's so satisfying to see them scramble
---
They could be under the house, which would make it easy to find.  Heck, I may do a build like this
---
I suppose it could also give us chicken meat.
---
It's unlocked and the event went green, we did it

I mean, only 3 things "work" - tis better than 1 tho. "cop a squatter" and the two scout quests. It's pretty useless.

It looks like it's in the area a little south east of charleston
---
Um, you *do* know this isn't similar to EA's "sense of pride and accomplishment" beyond the grinding, right? Since you can't straight-up buy perk coins with real cash to bypass the grinding (which is the entire reason that controversy stirred up to begin with)
---
 https://imgur.com/H1BoWom

We did it
---
It's petty humor dude 🤷🏼‍♀️ sorry to upset you
---
Fallout 4 had nice metal beams you could place under a high raised house which I loved to do and make a canopy village. It was kind of jury jigged though, doubt we'll ever be able to do that here. :( Especially with the bugs that make items undeletable cuz "something will be inaccessable, blah." I tried to with the metal tower staircase thingys and ended up having to move my camp.
---
?

Brahmin noodles is awesome pun. Love it
---
1 Brahmin meat

1 salt

2 purified water 
---
Drink 18

+15 weight increase

Or noodle cup like you suggested

IIRC There was already a Communist skin for the stealth armor datamined a while back. It was *supposed* to go on sale along the other Communist stuff but, Bethesda being Bethesda, it didn't for whatever reason
---
I was thinking and have had a thought for a long time, what about things that actually relate to certain areas? The Mire could have a Strangler Prime as the boss, where there are multiple stranglers hearts fused together by the nuclear blast to make strangler prime. Then the savage divide could have a repurposed mined that is infested with Honey Beasts, and the Honeybeast Queen will come out if you destroy the entrance with a nuke.
---
Debuff: Burned Mouth
---
The Zetans have infiltrated this sub I see.
---
Well ok yeah lol
---
It happens from sprinting and aiming down sights without dropping to a run or walk; reloading or holstering fixes it. It's extremely annoying in NW and irritating elsewhere.

Xbox One X, game is stored on the internal drive (external is too slow for this game) Gigabit internet.

I only come onto the public servers to join a team, when there is a Legendary Run challenge to join a team with another player.  However, whenever I try to log into a public server, I generally have to spent at least 10 to 15 minutes, going through anywhere from 6 to 10 server loads where the game cannot place my CAMP, so I just try to log into the public server the first time, get the message my CAMP can't be loaded, go ahead and join the server anyway, then join ANY team that happens to have a spot.  As soon as I see the challenge completion pop, then I go ahead and leave the team and leave the world, because I don't want to waste a spot on someone's team, when someone who will be staying on the public server can use it.
---
That works too
---
Yes, you can still do it.   All the time, a team member will use the "come here" emote, and it can be enough to get the entire team there to at an event.   I'm more than okay with someone not having a mike; would prefer a player without one who will show up to work together than one who doesn't and never shows up.
---
The only other thing you can do is buy the ranks with atoms.
---
Yeah I’m the king of petty, this isn’t funny nor petty. I’d say it was like 50x more petty you got killed for nothing, &amp; if the guy was really worried about your body he could’ve easily switched lobbies. You ain’t bad
---
It's in Northern Wisconsin though so more than likely they'd be afraid of being snowed in.
---
You motion, "come here" if you're at a good event, see the Colossus, etc.
---
The thing that makes me nervous is how strong that collosus Earl is going to be, at the same time as they Nerf builds?? It just gets me thinking
---
Of course of course lol
---
And there’s like laughter after she says it, catches my ear every time
---
Ya, no. You hoarded. I spent every point I ever earned.
---
LOL
---
Line in the sand and guided meditation with cranberry relish berry mentats on a building team with unyielding gear and well rested. You get alot of xp and can really grind out some lvls.
---
Ops lol ment to ask the guy you were talking to
---
To give an example: 
---
If I have a STR Heavy Gunner character who stays in Power Armor 24/7, I don't care about skins for stuff I don't use or see, for example underarmor/armor skins or skins for weapons that I won't use like rifles/pistols/fist weapons/etc.
---
If the game was more alt friendly and I had another character that is a rifleman/pistol user/melee/unarmed/etc, I would certainly buy skins for the armor and weapons that they would use.
---
You sound it 😂 noones trying to take your title man. No claims to being bad or insane. Just a bit of fun. Enjoy the wasteland 🤙🏻
---
Im on PC, I am able to fix it by actually mouse clicking on the prompt to respawn instead of space/E/Enter. Not sure if this will work for you.
---
What about Delbert's Omelette Breakfast?
---
3 chicken eggs  
---
1 tato  
---
1 salt  
---
1 pepper  
---
1 awesome possum bacon
---
I will seriously have to try this and honestly have never thought about it. I usually just do a eye roll, huff out a whatever and jump to a more (unfortunately) dead server.
---
i think its honestly a matter of either knowing based on having played fallout games before which enemies are difficult, or figuring out the hard way. which i dont see as a problem. assaultrons, deathclaws, sheepsquatches, scorchbeasts, wendigos, etc are hard enemies. the levels dont mean much. they basically just tell you how hard they are on the scale of THAT enemy. i dont see a problem with that, unless you dont like games that have some level of difficulty and a chance you can die. personally i like that aspect. idk how i feel about this update overall, as while i typically hate the leveled region deal in a lot of mmos (likely because i just hate mmos in general, theyre too boring and repetitive to me), i think it worked really well in this game, because its more engaging than your typical hotkey spamming crap in other mmos.
---
When patch 22 releases you can buy whatever you missed with gold
---
IDK, the person in unyielding armor is virtually undetectable, has a much higher carry weight and levels up 30% faster.
---
Yeah I get you have to try REAL hard with this game to have fun. I see where your coming from now too, your being ironic! That’s actually really funny
---
I remember when the end-game grind used to be jumping servers day after day, hoping a jetpack mod or plan would appear in the White Springs vendor.
---
Then one day all the plans were available to everyone in the vendors. Months of play wasted. I took a LONG break after that.
---
Those metal and wooden beams are in 76. I've used them in the past when I didn't want my floaty houses to look quite so floaty though for the life of me I can't recall where they are in the 76 build menu, stairs possibly?
---
Speaking of the build menu I do wish that they'd delineate between the different building tile sets (Wood, Barn, Warehouse) like they did in Fallout 4 rather than having to scroll through wall option after wall option to get to the building tile you want.
---
All I am wanting is the firefly bottles to be a little bit brighter
---
Thank you for sharing.
---
dont say lewd things around my virgin ears
---
I watched captinoob on the PTS, he used a legacy which still was OP. So I think they are really just trying to make casual player farm and not play content and not piss off the YouTubers who all have duped or hacked legacies.  I know Earl is such a bullet sponge and has crap rewards I won't head into the mine, it's boring.  Been there done that, not interested.  I want to be able to finish the main story line so I can farm gold not ammo.
---
Can you drop your psn pls? also a time that works?
---
Mine was always junk. I use to have it all the time. Once I moved camp I never built again
---
I believe it's power user in the intelligence perks. Doebles the life of power cores.
---
Yeah, why are the candles so bright lol.
---
Odd that there's no leveled content between level 50 and whatever level you get legendary perks.
---
When I started playing, I went through all the content on every character slot I could, then deleted those characters around level 75 because there was nothing else to do. Then I would run up another set, playing all the missions and content again. I only recently pushed a character over level 100 because I heard there would be more leveled content there soon.
---
All those earned levels feel wasted now. I could have just put it all on one character if I'd known legendary perks would be a thing.
---
Zorbo is just a visual representation of how much time is left in the season. Sometime around the second week of September I believe is when the season ends, so that's when zorbo will get to the finish.
---
You won't be able to get more SCORE after that, but apparently some of the stuff will be available to buy for gold in the future. Probably not the final rewards though.
---
If his channel is just a bunch of vids of him being a jerk and then getting owned, it might be worth watching.
---
Everything? I saw a post showing the ammo converter and chicken coop available for bullion, but I wasn't aware that you could get everything from the legendary run
---
You beat me to it. Yes. Worth every perk  point imo.
---
I bet you're right about that
---
Holy shit, yeah the explosive Fixer seems to make it MUCH harder to evade enemies. Switching back to my fast one.
---
Did you summon me?
---
I'd still want to see it, at least once.
---
This would be fun. There could be smaller square camp plots in it, where you could put a tent or a small house. No need for all your benches as there would be a communal workshop area and stash boxes.
---
Maybe it just puts you on whatever plot is open on that server. If they were all the same size and flat it wouldn't much matter. And there could be an area where everyone is able to build and contribute something to the community for the day and things could stay until the server wipes.
---
It could be a fun new community.
---
I agree that a nerf is the wrong way to go. Way way wrong. Buff the enemies for god sake i can topple the queen myself she’s weak. Enemies should be all higher level outside the forest then higher in the Savage divide higher in the mire then super hard in the bog it gives the player something to work towards nerfing the builds just makes you wanna quit after spending years honing and building your character only for godbugthesda to ruin it all. 
---
What’s the point of it all if they destroy what you spent time building?? Buff the other builds they are going in the wrong direction AGAIN.
---
About summer, they never release some seasonal outfits except for Christmas, i really would like to see some light outfit for summer in the atx
---
Ok I can’t answer if it’s everything or not. I am not in pts. But I would think the cool things like chicken coop and stuff but I doubt the caps and scrip and atoms and prob the skins.
---
I haven't been able to find it there since Wastelanders.   If you do, could you post it?
---
Yup. I've had this problem. I've also had players not loaded in and weapon effects not visible (being hit with a grenade and seeing no explosion)
---
That'd be absolutely idiotic if they made the end of the board rewards available for purchase....it completely negates the point of grinding during the season.
---
Undetectable? I had a sneak piece in my set and I got by far faster detected then now. The carry weight is nice but when you are at the limit and you have to put a rad away in or you die you are  instand overload and you will also get the respawn bug only at vault 76.
---
Yea you get a ton more XP that's true but I for example already have everything I need, done almost everything in this game I don't care much about XP. The daily score challenge is easy going in 10min  with creating a new character and running down to wayward.
---
Edit: I have 2 armor pieces with +1 strength and I'm still sitting on 340 carry weight .
---
I am not sharing the same experience, yet, as I've only been playing for a few weeks now but what you're talking about is nothing new.
---
You feel like the game is a job because you treat it like one.
---
You log on to chase rewards.  You're feeding the habit of only progressing towards your next 'fix' instead of playing for the experience you create by yourself or with friends.
---
This is no different than any other addiction.  The enjoyment of the addiction begins to wear off and you're just left with a lot of negative influences on your psyche.
---
Stop doing that.  It's not the game's fault.  It's not Bethesda's fault.  You're going to be met with this same wall in every game you come across.
---
We shouldn't strip away daily limits because it'd expedite your progression curve, you'd get everything you wanted, and you'd leave the game because you'd have nothing else to do and you'd be here to complain about that instead.
---
Until Bethesda can saturate the game with content that will keep people with no lives, busy, they can't afford to diminish their playerbase if they want to honestly breathe more life into the game after its terrible start.
---
*Tl;dr: Stop feeding the itch.  Discipline yourself to get what you want out of the game.*
---
You have a very binary world view huh?
---
The moth man lights were from the Atom shops I use them quite a bit, too.
---
this really gets me because like... its already not like this. i remember being level 25-30 and getting my ass beat by a level 14 deathclaw. meanwhile i could take out a ghoul thats almost 20 levels higher than me RELATIVELY easily. idk how these people think levels are going to make everything the same when they already dont.
---
Bruh. That was a huge flex that was uncalled for! Teach me your secrets! I’d love to know how tf you’re getting 65 without exploits. I upvoted anyway, because you should be allowed to flex all you like.
---
I like that scorchbeasts don’t have to take awhile though.
---
Correction: You can buy the utility items, the chicken coop and ammo converter
---
Ha!  Its still locked on my end....maybe cause im on mobile
---
I heard a lot of bull shit about this game. Waited until wastelanders to buy it. Now I’ve got multiple characters and love finding newbs and dropping plans ammo and weapons on them.
---
Zorbo should hit the end on the last day,so if you don't beat him,there won't be any time left.
---
yep. i bought the highest edition and then played from beta to the announcement of fo1st. i then came back for Wastelander after fo1st and was gone by the end of Fasnacht. I tried coming back for seasons, but upon hearing seasons would be literally uncompletedable for someone with my schedule even if I slept only like 4 hours and spent all my spare time playing, I left. This time I'm most likely gone permanently. I even skipped meat week and that Brotherhood shit. I'm glad I'm not around for this fiasco.
---
I love Fallout. They're my favorite games of all time. But NV and 3 do nothing for me anymore, 4 has a game breaking bug no mod or BGS support has fixed, and 76 is... like this... 
---
Wish you all well.
---
thanks for the tip!
---
same here, I liked the plain metal. the helmet is already very distinctive.
---
lol I kind of like how obnoxious it is :) plain metal would have been cool enough. ...I like the BoS t-60 paints for that reason. they're subtle.
---
oh man, yeah, that's irritating. should've just kept with tradition.
---
Probably not so long if they have a bloodied build
---
Yes, very!!
---
Poe tay toe poe tah toe
---
We’re all no-lifes together! Or low-lifes...
---
Im one of the Cryolators.  Anti-armor, fire rate, +AGI here (one of my extremely rare useful purveyor pulls). My typical tactic is to start with my daily driver handmade to get in my damage share.  After she's healed and is back down to 50-65% health, ill whip it out and wait until she either lands or does that hovering thing where she stays low.  It takes a good full clip to get her to start freezing, so i need to be in a good firing position or she cant be moving much. (The quick reload "feature" allows some room for error.)
---
If you appreciate the service, please do us Cryolators a favor and keep the MOBs off of us.  If im getting constantly harrassed by scorched radroaches, etc, i cant keep up the steady fire it takes to keep her nailed down for more than a second or two.  There have been a few fight where ive had to give up and go back to doing damage because idiots get on top of a tent and ignore everything on the ground.  Throw us a bone, people.
---
I have a fun interaction like this almost every time I log on. Fun people choose to play fallout for sure
---
Past week or so I've been noticing long wait times for games to populate
---
I think buffing the other builds is a great idea!
---
I'm not specifically talking only about bloodied either, I just think their making the wrong choice. That was a very good idea about a new NPC levelling system
---
Same thing happened to me, first time logging in in a couple weeks.
---
Had to switch to regular Bos protective under armor.
---
Kinda bummed...
---
The one I have seen so far is "Super Chem MK 1" it does +30% Melee damage, 25 damage resist and +2 Strength for 5 minutes.
---
It seems to be a Fury with +2 Strength instead of the -5 Perception and lasts a bit longer (5m vs 3m base).
---
Ridiculously petty. I love it! ;)
---
10/10
---
Yeah this post has attracted some real weirdos that are angry about a glitch being exposed.  There's almost no difference between someone plopping down 20 glitched ammunition plants in their base producing thousands of ammo an hour versus someone duping the same ammo over and over again.  It's not supposed to happen and it messes with the game's economy big time.
---
Did you see the graph from JuiceHead's video?  It honestly looks, more or less, like Bloodied took the brunt of the damage nerf.
---
Most of the other builds maybe lost a very small fraction of their DPS.
---
[https://ibb.co/KwTNmt0](https://ibb.co/KwTNmt0)
---
I can't imagine this is going to completely destroy peoples' ability to kill mobs but rather bring Bloodied back in-line with some of the other builds so it's not as ridiculous as it is right now.
---
I’ve just started avoiding a build with many electric lights since I feel like it doesn’t fit the feel of the environment anyway. I use electricity for my vendors and a couple of lights, but for the most part stick with lanterns and gas lights. I use the Moth Man lights, too. I really wish that they’d soften the glow on the candles as I’d like to use them more often but they’re way too bright white. The floor lamp with the tripod stand is nice lighting.
---
I'm lvl 75 and I have a shotgun build. Almost every shotgun perk card is maxed out and I primarily use a 3 star instigating double barrel that absolutely devastates limbs. I one shot most things that aren't huge creatures.
---
tbh I'd like to see clothing stay the same no matter what character puts it on, magical groin sensing pant legs are weird as hell
---
Ha ha, I've left my corpse places until timeout. Griefers hate it
---
Now its the winter one.
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I’m at rank 93 and I haven’t used any atoms while I’ve still got time to finish season one. 
---
But I definitely feel like you don’t have time to enjoy playing this game the way you want to play it, it’s definitely a grind. 
---
I usually play Fallout 1st as playing Wastelanders is always picked over by other players. 
---
I’d to complete a event while in a team the other day, so I did jail break for the lead. Believe it or not I only had 2 enemies to clear between the waves, how one earth can you get any xp. 
---
Nearly every time I’ve to play Wastelanders I struggle to level up. 
---
I understand that Bethesda are trying to get us to play in groups of 4 which in theory gives us 4 times the benefits, what is the point if there’s less enemies to gain to help you gain more xp. 
---
I’ve played season one mostly in fallout 1st and even then I find dropped loot bags all over the place. 
---
But in all fairness I don’t blame you buying those ranks, you can now get on doing what you want to do in game. 
---
Enjoy.
---
Dude, come on now. Not even 24hrs cooldown to your spam?
---
To each their own, I get where you are coming from but a stash just doesn't make sense to me.
---
I like it
---
Lvl 50 double barrel shotgun?
---
I told myself I’d never play a bloodied build just for damage output. Then someone told me about having the full unyielding armor set and what it does for your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats and I just had to try it out. Having 500+ DR and ER without power armor, 3-400 AP, and 450+ carry weight(w/o deep pockets and only a couple carry weight perks) is pretty awesome. I’m loving the bloodied/unyielding build for endgame. Im almost level 200 and by this time in the game, everything kinda just feels like a chore. Might as well make it a bit easier. I started a new character yesterday to have a balanced build as well as a bloodied though.
---
ITT : bunch sour pusses with low mirth settings
---
All you have to do is quickly close out your game before you actually die and while the falling down animation is still in effect, and you don't loose any junk.
---
I went to West Tec to get my level up challenge done, and in the middle of the first run the game crashed, I logged into a new server and did a full run.  In the end with scrapper I had 800+ steel, 250+ plastic and other misc junk.
---
There was a camp next to West Etc, and instead of going to my base to deposit my junk I went straight to the camp to get the buy 3 items challenge.  I knew something was wrong as there was a fog machine in the vendor room, inside this base which was floating off the side of a cliff.  I went to the first 2 machines bought 2 cheap items, I knew there was a trap somewhere but continued to the third machine to fall through a gap that is impossible to see due to the fog, and onto the hundreds of stacked Punjab boards that this guy had placed/blueprinted  before the fix.
---
I was prepared and force closed out my game before the animation of me hunching over finished, and upon logging back in I still had all my junk and was right in front of west tec again.  I was on a team with my friend and went back to the same world, to see him scurrying around his camp (looking for the spoils that didn't arrive) and I made sure to wave and give him a heart when he walked outside before dropping 1 steel as a consolation prize.
---
I stopped playing over a month ago for this exact reason. Right around the time that the legendary run started. I did the math as to how much work I'd have to put into it and I was just...done. 
---
I've gone back to playing ESO which is much more fun. The endgame content there isn't as grindy and there are so much more options as to what to do with your time. Oh, and it's got PVP that works. Oh, and skills that aren't a pain in the ass to swap around when you're crafting. Oh, and the economy isn't broken. Oh, and the game isn't a glitchy mess. Oh, and it's got text chat and guilds and a group finder and working dungeons and raids. Oh, and they regularly add new zones. 
---
I wish 76 was as well put together as ESO is.
---
I'm addicted to the unyielding armor, just to supplement my hoader carry weight. I can live without the bloodied weapons... but not the massive boost to special stats.
---
Nothing worse (for your sleep patterns) than somebody dropping on WS as you're repairing your guns before logging off.
---
I wear it during SBQ events because armor + rad protection is about it.
---
I know this might not be the most aesthetically pleasing since there's no 'lamp shade' but I use Cycling Lights in my CAMP.  The inconvenience is that they need a direct power supply (only 1 per light) but you can cycle through a whole rainbow of different colours until you find one you like. I tend to keep my living areas a nice warm orange glow, my armor workbench has a green glow, my weapon bench gets a light blue glow , chem bench gets a dark blue glow &amp; my booze making shed has ultra-violet. I personally love these lights, I rarely see people using them but they're very versatile for setting the right lighting tone :)
---
I proposed 3 new nuke missions. Each nuclear power plant can spawn a world super boss. It also results in a nuke zone twice as large.
---
If you nuke a regular fissure, it spawns a 'close the fissure mission'. Where you have to kill all the scorchbeasts coming out and close the hole with any explosives you have. Give some use to the fatman arsenals out there. This should be true of the SBQ battle as well.
---
I also propose a giant mothman, behemoth and deathclaw as the bosses. Like godzilla, king kong and mothra, and the same scale too!
---
Except nothing carries over.  Need to redo the Raider rep grind if you want that nice ammo factory for your base.  And don't forget all of the nice gun and armor plans with less then a 1% drop rate from events.  We can't even mail anything between characters so we can't make the guns on the person with the actual plans.
---
No, making and even just collecting ammo is faster.
---
You can get by just fine with a full health build with no special buffs at all.  I actually find the game still easy like that.  I don't know why people think it's necessary to play Bloodied to enjoy the game.  It's unbelievably overpowered relative to every other build in the game.  Killing things in a few hits instead of one hit is not the end of the world.
---
i think its just the stuff that has actual function, like the ammo converter and chicken coop, that can be bought with gold. even lunchboxes can be bought with bullion apparently. cosmetic stuff will likely stay locked for a while and end up in the atomic shop in like six months.
---
I feel the same way I have a child and with work and everything it’s like I can’t be a part of the group like I want
---
The developers are novice alchemists. The masters died off leaving them with a bubbeling cauldron. The novices can keep the fire going so the cauldron stays warm but they have no idea what to put in it. So they experiment. They put something in and let it stew for a while then take it out. 9/10 times it fails and the game crashes. The 10th time they get something that dont crash the game and they put it in. But the effects of their actions are completely random. Put in a skin for something and enemies become immortal. Change a modifier and .38 special becomes mini nukes. And to this day their experiments continue...
---
I quit playing after lvl 50. There's really nothing to do after that
---
Maxing AAs definitely was a grind but the worst I've ever done was the augmentation Artisans Prize. That took roughly 6 months of daily 5+ hour game sessions to get - for 1 piece of a piece of gear, lol. Grinding in 76 isnt too bad honestly. What made me quit was the severe lack of endgame content.
---
at least in the pic you can see some support beams. it isnt literally floating.
---
How do you not know what it is, yet you know it's closed?
---
Nice try lol
---
True true. I didn't think about that when I was running on a 4 hour nap for a 18 hour day
---
Yeah every area in the game was a cakewalk, even without a bloodied/junkies weapon. 
---
It'll still be easy, except now it'll take an extra half a second to instagib what are supposed to be tough endgame enemies.
---
So the thing with the PTS is that it was clearly put in place after the fact because of player feedback in the first place and Bethesda still has yet to understand the function of it or they do and they are doing their best which still isn't good enough in my opinion. Leaving the legendary run out of the first one was an insanely bad idea, and I think they literally couldn't build a version of it that worked in the temporary time frame for people to test and look what happened. Additionally I have the pts forum bookmarked and check it once a day to see about potential new issues and its clear there is some sort of disconnect still as can you can proceed through the run which may have helped with stuff like autocomplete, but you are unable to claim the items which again does not allow players to test the new rewards which will not help with 3/4 of the items being bugged out on launch. You also cant re-copy your live characters to get an updated version from the live game, cant get new legendary currency/coins to keep testing after you blow your initial load and other misc issues like that. Even on the PTS forum they control, the community managers rarely participate so you have really smart users who work in these fields professionally essentially writing essays about features and back end stuff and its left for other users like me to parse out with close to zero confirmation about the overall direction. Maybe its because they cant or don't have the ability to really get right to the core of issues with the dev team, but it feels like Bethesda made up their minds and locked in their schedule and do what they can with what feedback they get and its definitely not enough. Until their core design philosophy changes, we are going to keep getting these disconnected buggy updates imo. 
---
Not to mention the pts players are not given accurate pts patch notes so a good chunk of the changes are players thinking to check certain things and finding out various fixes have been applied. 
---
Additionally, the perk coin system was universally loathed by the overwhelming majority. Nobody liked it, understood why it was built so grindy, and why it discourages build creativity by making you sacrifice the cards that make your builds for coins and again pigeonholes players into a "do it this or piss off" mentality. 
---
So again, one step forward two large steps backward. But its progress so.
---
Honestly most power armor blocks like 50% of the screen when holding heavy weapons
---
So then what’s the point in using a build the requires planned out perk cards and mutations and little health if the guy using a normal rifle does around the same damage?
---
Thanks for your tip, but this needs to be fixed. 
---
I didn’t send any tickets to Bethesda as they haven’t responded to some of my earlier tickets. 
---
In all fairness with everything that’s going on in the world we all need to give and take a bit.
---
Oh, I’m using this. I can say this about 50x a day to people
---
I used to do that until a few weeks ago when I realized how much score I was giving up. Being able to kill rapidly, and gain much more XP, let me catch up on the legendary race pretty quickly.
---
The Division has entered the chat: y'all think you got bullet sponges cause it went from 1 shot to 2-3 ? Aren't bloodied builds doing enough damage to overkill most enemies 2-3 times? Sounds like you'll be fine here.
---
You get Cop a squatter on yours? I get Bivs daily along with the 2 scout ones. I wish it could be used for all available dailies, I assume that was the original intention with it. Think I might get rid of it from my camp, waste of budget.
---
Well I know the coop is and that’s what 70 some.
---
I donno.. I threw a dozen orbital strike beacons at a queen once just to see what would happen. It was fun. Doesn't do much damage, but it was still worth it.
---
The moment I started the legendary run I knew it would just be another chore, and video games are about having fun, having limited timed things just doesn’t interest me anymore, just a superficial way to get players who are addicted to being completion
---
Well that's cool. I'm glad it's something new. I wonder if they are all melee-oriented. Would make sense with "brawling" in the title, I suppose.
---
Is that an insult? I don't care,also am not from the us ,so I don't give a crap about LGBT4X*.
---
Yeah I didn’t mean literally the whole board. I messed up by saying everything. Thanks
---
Definitely hope season two gets a rework.  Have it dailies, weeklies and other things to give players more variety and choice.
---
Yeah, my friend works at same place with 1 young child and he can literally get on 9 hours a week. 3 hour segments and he loves fallout76 but is torn between enjoying game and trying to get the cool rewards he likes from run. He just made it to sheepsquatch plushy which he was pleased about but he has no chance of getting even halfway.
---
There's three spots in the game and I guessing you have the perks for it, but it's a random chance for any animal to spawn in those places
---
Full set of Unyielding armor each with a +1 and maxxing your INT could put you at 35 INT. Add the build team (+4) Now you're at 39. Add consumables and you be able to power through even at 1 or 2 hours here and there. If you or others want to get through the season(assuming season 2 is similar) this is more about EXP than anything else. Thus prioritizing your INT and Respec what you can will make it better, more manageable
---
Has the legendary perk system dropped? Or is it still in PTS?
---
Im sure it works in theory, but in practice, im running a fire rate cryo with the reload happy accident going and if i miss a few shots (like VATS cuts out when my AP is gone and i pull high before adjusting) she's getting loose.  The only way ive found to keep her nailed down for more than a few seconds is to avoid gaps in a constant stream of fire.  
---
Typically, if i freeze her starting when she's on her last 50% health post-mutation, im dumping 400-500 rounds.
---
Stupid question ... how do you access these games?
---
Seriously.
---
Could you tell me where these places are? 🤷🏻‍♂️😁
---
Seems like a wasted perk to me. The only time I really die is Encryptid.
---
Can you get in? Yes. Will you survive long? Depends
---
I remember a kung fu movie based around a flying shoe. It could work.
---
but there's a spot in the atomic shop for a Mountain Scout headwear object that has no picture, it isnt craftable, and "favoriting" it for NW gives you nothing on your head.
---
tbh, since we were never told or shown a hat, i think the bug is that this thing is in the shop list at all, not that we arent getting some kind of hat.
---
I am here for it! Make these separate outfits.
---
If you grind out all those cards at the current rate, I will *not* admire you. I might pity you though.
---
https://youtu.be/Up97cMP7eSQ
---
Yes, if you have a team sharing the Rad Sponge perk: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rad_Sponge
---
I server hopped a dozen and a half times at cranberry glade and finally got a wolf.
---
you can put a point in say strength and then cycle through the cards to pick something from a different special.
---
and when you hit 50 every level you can move a point or pick a perk card so don't panic
---
Dirty and skirty
---
Thanks a lot ✌️
---
&gt;Chinese Stealth has rad protection? Did not know that.
---
Oooof... yeah, it's basically an upgrade on the hazmat suit, that also offers armour protection too.
---
P.S You can wear the stealth armour without the helmet and it wont effect rad resistance
---
Tell that to the Casual Outfit
---
Exactly!
---
Scrapper or green thumb
---
I have only had that happen a couple of times before, but I later realized I had done something like stash a weapon then pull it back out, so it was no longer in the weapons switching "memory", or whatever.  After those incidents, before I am going into an area where I know I will be fighting, or even just after first logging into the game for the day, I manually go into my pip-boy and select my secondary weapon to equip it, then I manually select my primary weapon to equip it, then I come out of the pip-boy and use the d-pad to switch to secondary and back to primary, just to be sure the weapons switching memory is "locked in".  I never have a problem, if I remember to do that after signing in, or before a fight.
---
Little Tidbit that might fit here :
---
At Red Rocket stations you dont refill gas but you get coolant instead. So whatever this fusion-process entails it must be getting rather hot. I think it might be as simple as normal atom ic reactors nowadays . Water is kept in a closed circuit, heated by the fusionprocess to make steam for the rubine and then cooled down by the coolant to be fed back into circulation in fluid form
---

---
Hahahaha hoooooly shit.
---
That's some good advice to be fair but unyielding is pretty tough to acquire that is level 50 and very costly. It's not just the experience that you need though. Exp gain is very time consuming still. Be good if there was like 20 challenges a day. So timegating didn't effect working adults or those with children so they can still take part
---
when i looked it said 0 for cork, but above it the arrow for cork was green and plastic was yellow. so i think someone just didnt fully update the page.
---
I finally got hit with the bug for the first time today, and I didn't log in until just a few minutes ago, well over 2 hours after the reset.
---
There is an actual NPC that shows up and revived you. Yes
---
whoops, it is biv. sorry. I only ever used it as decor as well.
---
Don't play then. It's a self-inflicted problem. As a MMO-lite, or whatever you want to call it as that doesn't really matter, this game was designed from the start to be grindy. Anybody saying it's not is lying to themselves. If the game is affecting your mental health and/or personal life, that's the sign to drop it. Don't continue on with it and blame bethesda or anybody else. I've been there before, and taking a break is absolutely mandatory in that position
---
I have a max level version of that, it's my favorite all around weapon for doing quests and challenges
---
the new OPS may change that
---
Separate versions of outfits would be great. They already do it with several (golf). Nothing should be assumed based on gender.
---
Between that and the ammo bill, thats why i wait until she's healed and then bled off at least 30% of her health after.  At the beginning, i get my 1500 damage or whatever with my handmade, which hits for 46-54/shot.  The Cryo nets me 3 dmg/shot.
---
Yeah it’s Sunday, everyone needs a day off!
---
Even though it took the biggest hit, bloodied is still prob best prefix/build in terms of damage
---
The annoying thing is when the self pro claimed "protectors" don't stand by the scavs. I'm a ore collector, but the amount of times I gotta stop and heal/protect the scavs with my Shishkebab is ridiculous. Like what are you even here for lol
---
OP you're the one that has no understanding of what the changes will make, so yes you're the only one (or maybe not, I know other people are worried).
---
Not to sound rude but hop in the PTS with your current build and you'll see that instead of one shot, you could be firing two bullets if there's really a need.
---
And also in VATS things gets even more narrow difference wise that you will not notice the change that much.
---
I mean I get you're worried and such, but seriously, don't worry. Everything will be fine and TBH I enjoyed fighting a bit more against a mirelurk queen instead putting her down with the usual 2/3 bullets. It made the fight alive and less boring.
---
Title of your sex tape!
---
did you ever saw a dog to tame it? 🤣
---
which is totally fair. but maybe double check it saturday night before leaving lol
---
Wander aimlessly will yield more gratifying results imo
---
Not only are there locations but random spawn points that are really amazing. I have one in particular I visit and it’s always got some cool random events, enemies, battles, and deezer lemonade stand spawn depending on server.
---
I have found these types of location while on search for the best camp spots
---
Yeah just use the stealth suit xD
---
I bet someone could make a pretty lucrative streaming career out of being an asshole to people, then karma comes and bites em haha.  I watch very very few non-tutorial or demonstration videos, and I would watch those. For. Sure.
---
I've got 1750 lost from 6 fully auto-completed, and the remaining 3 are are 5/10, 1/3, and 5/10 complete. Really pisses me off that this happens for the first time when I'm so damn close to finishing the run. I'm on square 96 and figured I'd be done by the time I got the weeklies finished once they drop on Tuesday. Now I worry this could keep happening and the last few spaces will be a nightmarish crawl.
---
Has anyone had any success submitting a ticket? Will they do anything? Seems like probably not.
---
I seen a dog similar to what hangs with the blood eagles. I wasn't able to take it though.
---
Ohhhh so I should just keep going on my lvl 36 in that case? How do you pick strength specifically? Id click on it and it brings me to the card selection for strength and doesn't give me the point until I pick the card
---
I’ve written about Morgantown Airport being turned into a Vault 76 settlement. It’s perfect, with easy access to water, food plots and scrap.
---
Working Dad here and only play after the kids are in bed. I've wound up rebalancing my build to be INT focused to maximize XP. Basically a low health, unyielding, junkie's build now because of the Legendary Run. Fortunately I've saved enough atoms to "buy" my way out once I hit 74, but the grind is real. 
---
And thank Jebus for a broken Line in the Sand event otherwise I wouldn't be nearly as far along as I am
---
It never worked.
---
Aside going around on foot, finding observation towers usually yields map locations of discoverable places around it.
---
I've had moxed results using it. Sometimes i think it may be bugged as i have it 3* and some days it almost never procs, but other it goes off every other time i go down. I sometimes run a squishy melee bloody and its noce to have that auto revive.  There is an animation that comes with as well.
---
Plasma Spitter yes, but Laser Splitter is most definitely not a shotgun. You can still use it as a regular laser rifle that shoots 5 beams (and most people use it that way since it dishes out higher damage than one without a splitter)
---
I'd use bloodied unyielding More if it was ahigh damage / high xp but high risk of death build instead of god Mode. Something I can throw on to one shot everything and get tons of exp but with the constant fear of being hit. Good times. Currently it looks boring so I don't do it.
---
Not in passive mode, no.
---
That escalated quickly.
---
Speaking for the US: Suffragettes, women mountaineers, pilots, and other adventurous types were wearing pants, bloomers, and “Turkish pants” from at least the 1800’s. In terms of mainstream fashion, Coco Chanel is credited with popularizing trousers for women in the 1920’s. And there are multiple outfits *for women in the game* with pants already.
---
I would think a working adult would already understand that not everything in life is fair for every single individual.
---
Don’t know why you were downvoted, because you’re right...but here’s an upvote to help lol
---
Update: I have all unyielding except my torso! Literally right after I posted this the first trip to the purveyor got me unyielding legs but the RNG has still been teasing me with the torso lol
---
I dont think the title statement is accurate but i agree with doing things to reduce the need for mules
---
I (lvl122) met a new player ( lvl11) in my camp and i gave him a marsupial serum, told him via microphone to watch on youtube how to use the luck perks for serums and he sent me heart emotes. It's a great feeling.
---
Well... That was... Yeah
---
Think it's time for you to take a break, play something else for a while, new games.
---
They tried a couple of ways to deliver quests. 
---
First was posters plastered in the train station. The nukashine frat party, sheepsquatch are my brother and the Pioneer scouts, you can even pick up some of the taxidermy notes there as well as other places. The reality of having train stations plastered with dozens of posters probably dawned on them. 
---
Then they introduced the terminal, it seemed a practical solution but then the update drought came. 
---
Now that they've introduced npcs, it made it irrelevant, at least for the time being.
---
Explosive and bash on the same fixer? You got a Todd’s Special my friend.
---
There are tank builds out there and most of them are junkie or vamps. As for healing perhaps the dungeons will bring them back.
---
Ah good to know. The last time I played it was Xbox 360 era so yeah. I'm more into Red Dead than GTA.
---
I've not got an error message but I'll give it a go when the maintenance break is over
---
Sounds like somebody’s feeling a little insecure. Take some Bufftats, eat a glowing meat steak, and go punch a scorchbeast in your underwear, you’ll feel much better.
---
I'm more concerned over the rubber banding. I only experience rubber banding on foes with high resistance like 60+ charred ghouls, 20-60 mutants, scorchbeasts, etc. If everything is now my level, 287 or so, then wouldn't they have the resistance of a foe at 287? It's just going to make my life more frustrating since I'll be dumping rounds into an enemy and the bar is just jumping around.
---
Tbh I still drop my unwanted ammo at people camps if they might want it. 
---
And I still go collecting resources to craft my own ammo. 
---
Might be an old habit tho.
---
go to anything that reduce weight. very helpful at low levels
---
I feel you I too have 4 alts, 64 54 51 and 22 so not as much time as you. Can be fun to play different routes and whatnot but on my main I have so many spare perk points I could easily respec into like 5 different builds.
---
I'm really happy that most of the season 2 rewards suck. I'll take a break now
---
Noice.
---
I've got a berserker's commando build that is crazy fun and tanks quite well. It's more work to play in that you don't just set and forget your equipment, but it's been worth while for me
---
once you pick a card it will
---
This also isn't the first time power armor has done this.
---
You do have something somewhat close to this in game currently: the harpoon fun with fletchers. Best experienced with the quad effect.
---
Chameleon armor works too.  Just need one piece and a good hiding spot.
---
Best option without those are through perks, SS armor with rad resist legendary effects and rad shield. This is clearly at peak and will be hard to pull off.
---
I'd recommend checking out  [https://nukesdragons.com/](https://nukesdragons.com/)  if you want to check out perk cards a little more freely. Many perk cards can only be unlocked after a certain level. If you care to make a fully optimized build, then that site will help you plan it out, and even tell you which cards to take at which level. I'd also just say that experimentation was part of the fun for me my first time around, and as long as you are getting damage bonus perk cards for at least one type of weapon, you shouldn't really ever get to a place where it's impossible to progress, and in many ways, it's easier to level up past level 50 than it is pre-level 50, so optimizing after level 50 isn't much of a grind or inconvenience.  
---
I always like to just advise not worrying too much about build that early. Just have fun roleplaying or doing whatever you want or feel interested in doing. In time you'll naturally come to learn and figure out what kind of equipment, weapons, and perks fits your playstyle best, and before you know it you have a pretty well-optimized build just by natural evolving to it.
---
It’s strange that my last 3 challenges are at the exact same level of completion as yours?
---
Build anything in workshop (5/10)
---
Kill a glowing creature (1/3)
---
Kill a super mutant (5/10)
---
NW which I don’t count as I don’t play.
---
I did this the other day, when I got the autocomplete bug. It didn't do anything.
---
This is what I want to see. Power Rangers taking down Rita Repulsa's ultimate form, the Scorchbeast Queen!
---
What makes it not a shotgun? It fires a spread of projectiles, like any other shotgun.
---
lighting in general meets your description.  I'm constantly turning my light on and off while moving around in the game.  either ‘candlelight’ or ‘nuclear explosion'
---
Preferably a short skirt and a long jacket
---
This looks amazing!
---
What did you use as ceiling to extend the garage??
---
Am I the only one that doesn't have this issue? Looking through the comments, I get the impression it's common, but I've not had to deal with it at all.
---
Ah ok. Other side of the world. Do you happen to be on now?
---
They updated the page, the double dailies it’s unlock now
---
Putting some of the higher paying ammos through does help it’s not an end solution for sure
---
That's unfortunately the case. If you make it too easy to get through it then people would complain about that as well. Sometimes it just doesn't work out, I was pretty disappointed I couldn't complete the battle pass last season for CoD even though I paid for it but life got in the way. Sometimes that just what happens.
---
Of course it is, but the fact that it's only going to be beating out the other builds now by a small margin instead of leaps and bounds, makes other builds infinitely more viable as competitive choices.
---
I'd argue that the slight DPS increase you get out of Bloodied after the fact might not be enough to warrant giving up 90% of your HP unless you just really want to tie yourself down to the feeling of hitting the absolute highest number you can.
---
Imagine finally not feeling like you're just shitting on your own build by playing something other than Bloodied.
---
It's gonna be great.   
---
Well, if it happens out the way that it should and they don't change direction.
---
Look up some of the perk cards online and try to formulate a plan early on. I had a level 50 who had perks all over the place and ended up having to make a new character as to keep from struggling to thrive
---
The One Wasteland enemy level balance is mostly to benefit low levels. It gets rid of the random difficulty spikes they’d encounter as they go through quests—level 15 goes to Savage Divide and gets demolished by level 68 enemies. That’s not an issue anymore. It helps high levels too, by making things a bit more challenging, but it’s not a huge change. 
---
As for the damage reduction, they didn’t nerf base damage. They changed how damage buffs are stacked. So a low damage build that isn’t stacking multiple things isn’t going to feel much difference. 
---
For example, someone using a full health build and a Mutant’s weapon is only getting one damage buff, an extra 10%, and they’re going to get that largely the same way they do now. 
---
Someone using a low health build with a bloodied weapon buff, Adrenal Reaction buff and a Nerd Rage buff is going to see that stack of damage buffs added together in a much stingier way, so they feel it more.
---
Hmmm
---
&gt;No legendary enemies
---
Juiceheads said there's a guaranteed legendary boss at the end of an Op, and he said he encountered random legendaries throughout.
---
It’s worth a try. It’s basically an optimization for dx3 audio that was used a lot to fix Fallout 4. Also, which audio service are you referring to? I know Realtek specifically has a few audio fixes.
---
So will it be retroactive or am I just losing out on the past 2 I should have gotten ?
---
I do a little bit of build optimising but I prefer to just run what I like. I have a 3\* instigating pump that solves almost any problem save meaty foes, and while I would like to craft out a full set of bolstering SS armour, it's more of a "when I feel like it" than a "I NEED to have this!" approach. 
---
Most people measure progress by how fast they can kill something, so naturally they want to fine tune their gear and see how far they've progressed since they first picked up the game. I'm content with my gear, I'll get there when I'm ready.
---
This Tuesday
---
It booted me out, I was so mad
---
&gt; Idk why we even have more than 1 character slot these days,
---
Mules for storage
---
...now I'm really getting the impression you're not only playing dumb...
---
Lazy and talentless. Tweaking individual creatures and weapons and builds take a lot of work, especially hands-on experience with the game which they apparently lack. A blanket nerf across the board is the cheapest way to make people grind harder... until they decide to play something else that is.
---
I do every challenge but level up everyday in 30 minutes. I'm ahead of zorbo. If they can't invest 30 minutes just accept that you won't get everything when it requires time invested. They aren't being punished for not getting the stuff. They simply just miss out 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yuuuuuuup.  I'm in the same boat.  Fuck me, right?
---
On PS4 there is a glitch that can be used to be in a nuke zone without any protection at all. Not sure if it works on stacked nuke zones though.
---
am i missing something here?
---
They have improved online IMMENSELY since it released on next gen.
---
Yep nice!
---
It's based on your level. So you will get the perk slots applicable for your level, and can trade excess perk cards from point to buy legendary perk cards with. 
---
So yes, retroactive.
---
While we're discussing pants and shirts, how about a kilt outfit?
---
Quality comment. Much was added to the conversation /s
---
Magazines and bobble heads weigh almost nothing now. Having them count to stash is insignificant. And they have to count to budget.
---
You do not have to run bloodied or Junkies to do the game just fine.
---
Then you don’t understand what the budget represents.
---
Thank you very much 😁 I used normal floor and RedRocket Bar Pieces ✌️
---
I play about 1 hour a day. Log in to do dailies and complete weeklies with the week and I am 4 spots ahead of the alien.
---
Basically this nerf is making the Legendary Perks moot. Like having a 20% off sale after jacking the prices up 20%.
---
Yes, there has been
---
Oooh I see now! Damn this is awesome. Great job man!
---
Reminds me of the time I came up with a "true mothman" boss which is Mothman the size of a scorchbeast and using the design of the point pleasant statue.
---
It's still a long-ranged gun, and unlike the Plasma gun it's not a total overhaul of the gun and is specifically just a mod for more damage in exchange for accuracy (since the Plasma gun can be converted to a shotgun, rifle, pistol or Flamer. The Laser Rifle only has 4 'true' conversions, those being pistol, rifle, charging sniper or automatic rifle.). It's not truly a shotgun unlike the Plasma Splitter
---
You can also attach a splitter to the Gatling Plasma, but that doesn't automatically mean the Gatling Plasma's suddenly a shotgun now, y'know? Accuracy being thrown out the window be damned, it's still a plasma minigun. Which is why the Laser Rifle being considered a 'shotgun' with a splitter wouldn't make any sense, cause it's still a laser rifle at heart.
---
&gt;whilst at their vendor
---
he attacked you while you were shopping at *his* vending machine? do people do that a lot? because that happened to me. I was shopping at a vending machine and the guy started shooting me, but it wasn't doing much damage so I thought maybe he was trying to shoo me away for some reason, so I left.
---
Then you didn't read what i said.
---
Man I've been doing it all wrong. I initially pick the stat but I can pick cards under any stat after?
---
...and now I'm getting a mic
---
Not common since you have to agree to pvp by returning fire. Only time I do it is when there's a daily or weekly where I have to claim workshops. I'd rather pick owned ones without checking owners level cause itsmore fun. If it's a new player my bad, but most the time imrunning into owners my own level or higher and it turns into half hr long 1v1+ battles which I find super fun as long as the person I'm fighting is having fun too.
---
The terminal is useful for setting the brightness. For my old build I had a fireplace in the interior and used cycling lights set to dim orange and red to help bring out that ambience. If you use high ceilings they’re not too noticeable. I agree that the electric lights are horribly bright. I’d recommend saving some caps for the modern fireplace when it’s on the atomic shop.
---
I also used a lot of oil lamps. Standing lamps in each corner and small handheld ones on tables!
---
Thank you man ^^
---
Use max level on my berserker's toon and it procs pretty regularly. There is an animation of the "savior" who gets you to your feet again if you're downed. Only works if you're downed, not if you're dead
---
I did it while working two jobs at a total of about 70-80 hours a week.
---
No, I meant my big black clandestine gauss machine gun
---
Probably because closing in on a season finish people stopped logging in for the nw challenge.
---
I hope we soon get animal companions. 
---
DogMeat would be great for this camp indeed 🙏🏼
---
It's just a different Brahmin hay bail. Probably don't want to give it a unique function until it's something that can be bought for gold.
---
I couldn't find that.
---
I dont use any specific build and I enjoy the game just fine.  My bloodied and junkie weapons go in my vendor
---
I agree, I just started using junkies about a month or so ago, its great but my build before was fine, I had a instigating lever action with max rifleman and was able to kill most things with 2 bullets.
---
Rad Rumble as well.
---
lasers go pew pew from magic :(
---
i’ve always been a bigger fan of high fantasy than apocalyptic stuff, i’ve just avoided ESO bc i’m not *super* into MMOs but they’re fun and i still recommend it
---
did you try yourself? 
---
because it's not bullet sponge.
---
There's one in the upstairs bedroom at Billings Homestead.
---
You are correct the posts and beams are in the stair section of the build menu.
---
&gt; Bethesda will ALWAYS nerf them and make them available to casual players.
---
This is how every online game has learned to operate over the last decade.
---
Power gamers can get the rewards first, but eventually they drift down to casual players.
---
Personally I see that as a feature.
---
Imagine a legit lvl 850-1000
---
Yes. I keep accidentally triggering it.
---
Incorrect. You are obviously a high level or have good gear. Doing some of the dailies is very dependant on luck also. They sometimes take me 20-30 mins or just over an hour. Also a lot of people commenting saying it's easy don't realise Bethesda has them ruining characters by morphing for exp build thus being detrimental to the future legendary perk system.
---
Tell me, why do you think the budget exist? Maybe consider why it is called a “budget”?
---
I read your post. It’s clear you don’t understand the budget.
---
there are SO MANY mods and reskins for Chinese Stealth Armor for both Fallout 3 and 4 by modders, it's almost unthinkable that Bethesda didn't bother to do a re-color/reskin like they always did lazily in the past.
---
Be prepared for a loooooonnnnnggg load time. 
---
Essentially it would just be like it is now, just it'd automatically leave the world where it was occupied and try another and another, giving you a lovely load screen to look at.
---
That’s a good point. I forgot it’s when ur downed not dead dead. I’ll check it out again. Thank u
---
Don’t kill it near the murky little pond, when it drops into the pond and quickly turn into a metal pile, good luck finding it. The camera can help sometimes if you know the area to look at.
---
It would be nice if all light sources had three brightness settings. That said, if you play crafty with the lighting you can get some great effects out of it.
---
That's basically what I've been doing. Had a great time playing this game except the past week. Tons of turds coming to our fully kitted workshops just to blow everything up and leave.  Straight up feels like gta online. And yes I know its "a pVP zOnE" but when they come not to even take the workshop but just to grieve it gets old. I especially like when they message me how I'm a noob. Like yea... your 200-300+ levels hier than me I'm pretty sure you've had the time to grind out better gear  haha
---
indeeeeed
---
I know it's early but I've been experimenting with Halloween lighting and decorating. My big lighting disappointment is that in the Toxic Valley the constant radiation glow means that there is no way to do spooky lighting in what should be a pretty spooky place. I'll be moving to the Mire in October, as it is properly dark.

Some advice for low level ammo:
---
* Pick up all ammo you find and run it through the ammo converter to boost your preferred ammo type.
---
* Keep a backup gun of a different ammo type. It doesn't matter if it's not on your build. At low level, off-build weapons will still do fine. Also, keep a melee weapon for worst case scenarios.
---
* Following the main story-line frequently pits you against Scorched, who frequently use shotguns. They also use hunting rifles and pipe guns. If you use one of these as backup, you'll be more ammo efficient while doing the main story missions.
---
* Take a trip to Camden Park once a day. Disarm all the can chimes for lead and steel. Pick up wooden blocks for more lead. All the paper cups and stuffed animals give cloth for crafting gunpowder. There's also often shotgun ammo laying out in the open there.
---
* Consider selling some of the more popular ammo types in your CAMP vendor, then use caps to buy your own.
---
* The Ammosmith perk card will appear under Agility at level 34. Get it as soon as possible to boost the number of ammo you craft at a time. It has 2 ranks.
---
If they're not the one(s) that launched the nuke then yh i agree it's rather rude.
---
Mine are the same exact same too and the first time it’s happened to me.
---
Xbox here as well. Yesterday my dailies were already completed, but I was playing at noon ET time. This is also the first time they have been completed already. Today I remembered to log off at 1158, then came back on a couple minutes later and my dailies were there for me to complete.
---
Run berserker! It's fun

It was a trap, so I was at his vendor, one I went into the machine, he activated a spike trap, I died and he takes the loot someone drops. I didn't have any so it was a wasted effort on me but even so, I was at his camp for 40 mins and only one person came in all that time. 40 mins for one person who probably had a piece of steel scrap.
---
Yesterday, my brother and I were helping our lv 25 friend defend his workshop. Amongst the defences here pops up a level 51 player, he is heavily carried (vanguard armor, legacy weapons, etc..) I try 1v1ing him killed him 5 times. I never do pvp, but he comes back with what seems as endless stimpaks, and seemed to be nodded weapons. I'm a level 120 and my brother who has some 140 hours into the game is 150, he was running a bloodied fixer and he couldn't even beat him, he said his damage was bipolar one second it would be 103-160 then the next it would be 1-25. Then we brought our more experienced friend in he is level 404, he tried 1v1ing him and hot him more than 10 to 24. He lost. My friend goes up to the guy and starts a trade. The next thing I hear is "Fat food build fuck."
---
I believe it lowers the chance of it happening the further away from resets you are when you login.
---
You’re mom. Haha no I’m jk I know it’s your
---
I always wear mine in non-SBQ nuke zones if I need flora.
---
True story.  My vampire .50 may not do 3k damage, but between it and my 50k rounds, I simply do not die in PvE.   And there are absolutely healer builds, some of them super effective, but they’re basically unnecessary, since no battle is that tough.  And they only work when on a team, I wish some of them were just AoE, they’d be way more useful.
---
Probably just letting us know. The more people who know about the problem and report it, the more likely it’ll get fixed.
---
There are even lvl 2000+ chars. I personally have seen one on pc.
---
They can place multiple spike traps on top of each other for a one hit kill ..happened to me at full health. My friend told me he heard this was fixed recently but I'm not sure if people found a way around it.
---
Wouldn't it be funny if bethesda thought hey lets delay people with spec pcs and let the taters spawn faster to give them an advantage for once.
---
I just got the Free States quest! I am so excited to be working my way through this one now. I was stuck for such a long time on Rose's quests. I have had to listen to her "if you screw me ooooverrrr" speech a thousand times, every time I logged on. 
---
Harper's Ferry: here I come!
---
So there’s no incentive to try and actually get good gear or buffs? Food builds for all?
---
This game is an fps, not an MMO. You don't have abilities to get agro besides jumping in front of bullets or doing damage, and team medic or a medic gun is all you need to be a healer. Bethesda didn't make any builds, players found the optimal ways to play but they're not the only ways just the "best" ways to.
---
Do not use power patcher at all. Pa breaks very slowly anyway
---
With the SS armor I can, but i still need to spam rad away
---
&gt;Thankfully there isn't a way for us to just buy perk coins...yet...but  the level of grind required to max these cards is giving me huge Star  Wars Battlefront vibes. 
---
How many times are we going to have these bullshit conspiracy theories?  
---
Remember how Bethesda was going to sell perk card packs for adventure mode?  How they were going to sell perk packs for NW?  How the fridge was going to be the first in a series forcing us to pay for vital in game perks through the atom shop?  How repair and scrap kits kits were just the beginning of an oncoming deluge of P2W content?  How it was inevitable that they'd start selling three star legendary gear?  That lunch boxes were going to end up in the atom shop?
---
Fuck. Off. Already.
---
I don't mind it - if they also fix the VATs bugs &amp; rubberbanding at the same time.  But with those in place, not looking forward to it
---
Wife uses it for her solo play and had some good results.
---
It's working for me again.  At least I think it is.  I haven't done any math on my shot for shot, but the number is increasing as expected, so it should be having an effect.
---
Can confirm last night was by me. So it wasn't this guy. 3 of the other times pretty positive it wasn't the glitched guy but could be part of their group idk.
---
Especially when you consider how in-demand some of those Legendary perks already: Infiltrator and the Ammo one will be picked up by a huge chunk of the community and grinded to max as quickly as possible thanks to bow good they are in terms of QoL improvement (which says a lot about the current state of play).
---
*sadness noises*
---
Never had an issue running 3 stab, 3 batteries, 3 power patcher, 1 scrapper, and 5 gunsmith. Sure there is better options but I kill with ease and barely ever have to swap cards out.
---
No power patcher, and I only run 1 or 2 ranks of power user depending on if im using my gatling laser or not.
---
Stealth is determined by your agility.  Sneak pieces add +1A.
---
Until you reach an agility of 30ish, you aren't as stealthy as you could be.  After 30, you can dump your sneak perks because they no longer improve your ability to sneak noticeably.  You are sacrificing 15 potential agility points by not wearing Unyielding and I doubt you'll find any way to make that up with sneak or agility gear.  Carry weight is 5lbs per point of Strength, so you are giving up 65 there if you account for the 10 lbs given by your +strength armor pieces.
---
The only way to counter your agility loss is to wear weightless armor with the Chameleon mutation.  Personally, I find that aggravating since it phases in and out constantly.
---
Play it however you like, but those are the numbers.
---
This is a really cool idea. I'd love to see a large grouping of peoples unique camp building styles in a consolidated area.  Could roleplay it and start an h.o.a or something.
---
It didn't even cross my mind to just have someone place it at my camp. Thank you soooo much!  &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I’m level 236 and wear full Vanguard with a few serums. Using either Gatling gun, shotgun or rifles I can solo most stuff easily. I never run silos though. May change it up when the One Wasteland update comes out.
---
Yep and if you are the leader swap to events right before it ends.
---
If they got rid of scrapping and just tied coins to levels and packs everyone could just be given the coins they've earned so far retroactively. No hour long session of scrapping cards and level ups ,missed coins from moving around SPECIAL or deleted cards from packs. Unless they plan to monetize perk coins there really is no reason for such a strange approach.
---
Cool story bro.
---
Honestly you can pick up unyielding armor for like 2k caps a piece so it's not super unobtainable. Here's what I do to get the level up in under 20 minutes without server hopping. 
---
-get the herbivore, egghead and herd mentality serum on a character  
---
(+12 intelligence when on a team with strange in numbers)
---
-use the inspirational (15% xp on a team) and strange in numbers perk
---
-use class freak if you plan on using marsupial
---
-always be in either a building or events team
---
-always be well rested. Having a companion at your camp can make the buff last for up to three hours.
---
-have the two following foods ready to be made: cranberry relish (+25% xp) and brain fungus soup (+5 int) brain fungus soup is super easy to make but for relish have about 6 gourds planted at your camp, go to aaronholt homestead for cranberries,  and follow the river in flatwoods for sugar. 
---
-if you have the refrigerated mod/perk/camp item, you will only have to make relish once a week. 
---
-always do the pumpkin house daily and the tea time one. These take 15 seconds and give some good xp. Honey can be found at aaronholt homestead a little bit away from the cranberries.
---
-always do guided meditation and radiation rumble. You will level up at the end of this event as long as you tag enemies with explosive weapons.
---
-if you are in white springs, sentry bots can give up to 2k xp per kill so be sure to Merc them.
---
-night person gives +3 intelligence at night but takes up 3 perception slots so I only recommend this perk if you really want to optimize your build for xp.
---
I have 5DemoExpert, 3PowerUser, 3Stabilized, 3BattIncluded, 1Scrapper. If I’m using non explosive weapons I replace DemoExpert with Gunsmith.
---
You're probably new to the game or just don't know your way around the game. The challenges are rather easy and legitimately finished it 3 days ago, now i just load in for the bullion and caps.
---
Update for 8-16-2020 Daily Challenges.
---
Same thing again today. Everything was checked off, top right of screen said 0/9 completed so I did them anyway. Although they were checked off as completed I got score on everyone of them.
---
What I have noticed is that the text for the challenges is still bright yellow with the checkmarks beside them when I log in. Once done, the text grays out.
---
I'm on XBox so I don't know if that makes any difference.
---
Yea but when i heard we could use the original secret service mod instead of the casual mod i was happy to use it, but now i cant craft it
---
What's one Appalachia? People keep talking about it but I have no clue what it is
---
I think even if it were a consumable thing it would be great
---
Keep passive turned on in settings, and when you have a lot of junk, stash it.  Don't walk around with it.  That way, even if you die, all you lose is the time spent in a loading screen, nothing else.  My team and I have had more problems with people around 70-80 than the really high level players.
---
Rifle
---
I use R3 power user R3 stabilized R3 batteries included and R4 gunsmith for 13 points. Intelligence is 20+ on a building team with herd mentality, egg Head, strange in numbers and the PA helm mod for intelligence.
---
Yeah, that never worked either.
---
Wait how did they build this without a staircase?
---
You don't, it's an exploit. It's the ammunition factory from the Converted Munitions Factory workshop blueprinted so it can be placed elsewhere.
---
Hopefully it gets fixed soon. On a positive note at least, it does eat up camp budget with no workaround, so there's that.
---
I mean.... you’re not wrong for the history of how we got here. The game would’ve gone an entirely different direction if Bethesda hadn’t bought out Interplay (assuming they had the funds to continue developing Fallout). Not to mention the original Fallout Online scrapped game ages ago. This game has progressed a lot from a isometric turn based strategy game. I do often wonder what the story would be or how the games would look
---
The direct answer to the question is that it would take money to implement fixes or content. This game isn’t as popular as previous titles, so they don’t see it as being worth the investments, especially since unlike previous games, this has a constant running cost
---
I actually do find the converter usefull as I pick up all the ammo I find, including Missles and Mini Nukes which get converted into ammo I need. For the record I also use my ArmCo to make 5.56 for conversion.
---
I only really craft my 2mm EC.
---
Fusion Cores I farm from Power Plants.
---
5mm I mainly collect and having worried about in a long while.
---
This leaves me to convert into Plasma Cartridges, Fuel, and save up points should I ever need to buy 5mm or Fusion Cells.
---
Naw man people just want to be op and anything to change that makes them have a meltdown
---
Several people have posted it happened to them, yeah
---
Your going for funny but it is more sad then funny.
---
ITV this past week
---
K
---
I’m just glad I will be able to scrap the cards I don’t use - the legendary perks are icing on the cake ... and if I chose to use a level up to swap specials why would I also expect a perk coin for that?
---
I think its gotten better. I find it really fun, especially for fans of the universe. 
---
PvP isn't worth the time, however.
---
Do you know if Bethesda have acknowledged it, yet?
---
And a utilikilt!
---
Before they changed the goal there was an idiot yesterday who was raging about how Bethesda was purposefully letting the event fail as part of their master plot to bug peoples dailies, not give them a second bonus score weekend and then force them to pay atoms to finish the season.

I use the blue mutagenic waste part of this mod. Works like a charm.

Gotta be the right bulb. There's only 1, and the light boxes that change color. Both have to have power ran directly to them. The bulb is called a cycling light and is in the first slot all the way to the right I believe. It looks like the regular hanging white one. Might have to have a plan for it first. After you build it run your power to it, and anywhere along the powers path or even the generator connect the terminal, that's found in the power connecter options. Then you can have a light, or light box that you can change the colors to. 3 options for each color, or make them ramdom. If you just power the light itself you can manually change it by going out of build mode and putting your cross hairs on it. Tip till you get the color and brightness you want.
---
Just one I believe it's called a Cycling Bulb/Light
---
Had a SQ battle a while back where a dude in power armor was T-posing while his .50 was stuck to his chest and firing while hovering around. That close enough?
---
And sometimes dailies or weeklies require you to complete something while on a team, but you doing actually need your teammates to do it. Events teams are my usual go to for this because if an event that I actually want to do pops up, I'll go do it.
---
I do the dad thing (not the work thing as I'm furloughed) but I have calculated my gaming. An hour a night with INT stacked and using buffs like berry mentats squirrel stew and sleeping was more than enough. My routine was a quick xp run which would finish a few dailies in the process. After this is finish the rest. Most of the NW dailies I could do fast or some I'd even AFK. 
---
The board game is a grind. But thats what most of these season pass style systems are. They want you on the game so they can make money. They've invested in designing the skins and other things you get from the board game and probably want a bit of return on their investment. Mind too the board game is free as others you pay for and still have to grind.
---
I have played it for 340+ hours and know about most of the exp builds but I was making point this can take a lot of time just to prepare for this especially if you don't have any spare levels like some I know who are levels 30-50. Some extra dailies would go a long way to help those who can't get on as much.
---
If you find one of those at a player's CAMP, and it's not the small one that you can build from the plans sold by the Raiders, report the player for cheating.

Go into a pub server, travel to vendors that are in areas that you haven't discovered.  From there use the compass to see if there are places nearby that you need to unlock (the icons will be dimmed).  Walk to them to discover and then repeat.

Not recently, no

40$ for this is far from cheap and I've bought much better games for much less.
---
Not everyone has a metabolism that produces coffee dude.
---
No thanks. Sometimes I join my friends worlds who have been playing a long time and have workshops. This idea would mean I couldn't join them if my camp spot is taken. I would be auto kicked. Meaning they have to give up the work they put in just to play.
---
Man, I wish I thought of that yesterday. Had a high leveler steal my workshop in the stadium by vault 76. A newbie area, and yet instead of helping me with my new character, he shot me. I had to try twice to get my loot back, because he killed me again when I clearly posed no threat. I just wanted my teddy bears, man.
---
I'm having trouble on paying attention to remember amounts of different ammo I carry or have stashed, so if I want to use the Ammo converter efficiently,  I have to write it down on piece of paper. That's how I can check what amounts I have that are closest to Converter requirements ( some ammo goes by 30s, some by 180, etc ), eventually pull some ammo from my vendor to round it up, and then do the conversion.  
---
It's better than former atrocity of menu  but still a bit quirky and not quite there.
---
I want to get rid of those 2 mini nukes I got as a reward ( machine wants 3 minimum ), 5 missiles at once ( thats 3 for machine, and 2 stay in stash ), etc... want it less *pre-made batches* machine takes, and more *dump it all I don't need* type of menu. Then it'll be absolutely useful for anyone.
---
I change the output to some useless ammo

Just have fun playing and figure it out as you go. You will have many "ah ha" moments where things click and you rethink how you are playing. Perhaps it will be from getting some weapon you think is pretty sweet for the moment. Just roll with it for a while.
---
The dark matter skin does it too in certain situations when in first person, i know if i have my gauss pistol out and jump from high enough to cause the "hero landing" part of the frame or other part of your armor obstructs your view for a short time, does it on occasion while crouching or using the jet pack as well.

I dunno back when camp destruction was possible some guy paid me 10k caps + the bounty amount to obliterate someone's camp. I'd say that was a pretty good reason.
---
people who still have the stacked spike blueprint can keep fixing them all at once at their camp module to insta spike you with a billion pungi boards. but new stacked punji board blueprints can't be made.
---
Ahh I see your point we’ll maybe there could be a setting where those who prefer auto joining a session with free space and one that doesn’t care and let’s you join with your friends that have the same camp area!
---
Even with full ss armor I still can’t go into a nukes area without radaways
---
They don’t add real time trackers for the exact reasons seen in this event. They reduced the numbers for concrete and cork. This way if something isn’t achievable, they can still pretend that the “massive” playerbase can achieve these immense goals.
---
try doing one of the dailies. like. cook 5 meals with plants etc. see if it gives you the points
---
Well said bud.
---
Or commando if you put the automatic receiver on it.
---
His messages were killing me man it was just too much
---
That's so very close to the option given when joining a world and your camp can't be placed already haha
---
Nice pics.
---
To be fair workshop claiming is not griefing. That's a part of the game.
---
It’s working.
---
I hate how you must have done this long enough before to find that out
---
That sucks man, are you PS4, wouldn’t surprise me if it was the same dude haha
---
Indeed it's really sad
---
I feel ya! I'm been on level 222 now for over a month now. I've tried to grind for SCORE this go around and I'm not into it at all. Since the launch of the legendary run, I've leveled up to........ 10 out of 100. I just can't do it. I've played since BETA with the same character and I barely finished Wastelanders and have never fought the Colossus. I've gone from playing every day to maybe twice a month now.  As far as the legendary perks go I guess I'll get 4 perks because of being over level 200 but I don't see me ever achieving level 300 now. Also, I'm not bashing anybody playing this game I hope you really enjoy it. I'm just an original player burned the hell out that's all. You guys have a good day.
---
If it means that much to you, do you bro
---
You basically cheated by blocking him though. Hiding while invisible is fair game but blocking the help just feels like you exploited the blocking system.
---
I am referring to the Service Host Windows Audio in task manager, I have a Realtek chip for my audio so its most likely one of those drivers, I just realised however I'm using windows store version and changing files is a lot more effort than its worth due to having to take ownership of the folder.
---
I'm looking forward to the season 2 rewards. I like the move towards temporary buffing stations like weight lifting station. 
---
Would be great if Foosball table and the shoot em up gallery also gave temp buffs.
---
Ghoul Skins would be cool. imo
---
Good on ya then, I've started to think survival tents and standing on the fences are what prevent her landing...Which unfortunately a lot of players are doing.
---
Because Bloodied is the only build that makes things like Buzz Blades, knives, and rolling pins viable builds. Nerfing reduces what weapons are viable. Also if you are afraid you’re doing too much damage you have more than enough leeway to nerf yourself by removing perks
---
This has to be on PC, right? I've been to 100+ SBQ events and never had this happen.
---
season passes are made for kids, the unemployed and college students
---
How do you get em to pose like that? Whenever I see one it tries to eat me.
---
That's what every AAA/"live service"  game has been designed for now for years, to make you feel exhausted and miserable (like at work/shitty jobs) so you can be pressured towards spending money for microtransactions and time savers/etc or labelled content/cosmetics that were locked away and cut out to make your gameplay more miserable until you shell out extra cash for AAA companies that already have unsustinable high profits and are often using tax havens and are paying poverty wages to game developer staff.
---
No I agree that it's a good change, that could probably lead to more/quicker/easier weapon balances from beth(laser buffs, explosive buff)
---
Hey at least the last 9 levels you had earned the atoms from the other levels
---
Wow, i've thought it was affect only power armor.
---
I dont know why people do this, the game is shit enough without trapped vendors. I never do anything I would find annoying to other players if done to me... waste of potential
---
&gt; if you are in white springs, sentry bots can give up to 2k
---
Wait what, I thought killing the robots at Whitespring gave no XP at all for some reason.
---
Mod on PC : Perk Loadout Manager
---
Official feature : should be out for winter.
---
Wow an EA bad post, daring aren't we
---
PC. Just some jerk in BOS power armor.
---
A lab coat with PANTS you say? Dear friend, I have good news. The Arktos Pharma Lab Coat applies a set of pants/leggings/tights! Problem solved 😁 If you're on XB1, add Alpha Zombicus, and I'll give you one of my many extras.
---
Edit: This also covers your 'clean' request, as it's an entirely clean, new lab coat.
---
Honestly, I think bow should get a perk like Gun Runner, where you run faster when using one.
---
Only the ones on the outskirts/golf course do
---
1st doesn’t guarantee anything, it just means they have more cash to pay employees to fix. If they have shit employees getting paid, then we have shit progression on bugs. Simple as that
---
That's a great tip considering how often I find myself there.
---
you used to be able to stack a bunch of pungi boards in each other on top of a chair or something and save that as a blueprint. when somebody went in to your camp, you could place/repair it and all the pungi boards would instantly kill whoever was on them. you can't make this blueprint anymore but anybody who made one before the fix still has them.
---
I had the same thing happen once haha
---
Mine was fine for a couple weeks, now I've had it 3 times.  
---
Given up on the run now.
---
Unarmed DCG is my favorite backup to everything. As it costs zero ammo
---
I don't have any problem with the rewards except where they split up something like a power armor skin into each model instead of just awarding the whole skin at once.  I do wish they would quit tying the progression to XP though, because it sucks having to keep my build tuned strictly for INT all the time. I've got diarrhea from all the cranberry and toilet paper is scarce.  Brain fungus soup isn't my favorite either.  Just keep the dailies and weeklies minus the NW ones and ensure that the season can be finished easily by just completing them.  That would be great.
---
I think a lot of the problems stem front he engine they used.
---
Because then they won’t get all the great loot and boy do they deserve it
---
Perk load outs are on the list for them
---
Wait.. this works for meat piles? Hell yeah have an upvote.
---
I have a 2 star bloodied shotgun in unmodded power armor. It seriously just takes knowing where stuff is. Adjust what you do for your dailies based on what the dailies are. It's not hard. Like it or not what I said is not incorrect.
---
I could kind of understand it if the rewards were great, like I'm talking guaranteed flux or like weapons or whatever. But you have to sit at your camp the whole time, until people arrive and go into your trap. And the rewards are basic and minimum. It's pointless. Perhaps the first couple of times it's like 'oh it worked! Haha' but to keep going for a long time.. What's the point?
---
You'll never unearth the mole people, we fear nothing from the over world
---
Junkies is fine and so is ammo (except for regular .308) really
---
fat food build? also, the best pvp weapon ever is a quad gamma gun. it melts anybody. especially bloodied builds.
---
If you're on PC I can build one for you.
---
Nice! Would love players do more of these kind of stuff. Someone even said other day he was in event that one guy narrated.
---
50,000 atom points /s
---
Works like a charm. After a big event, I just run around to all the blue piles and collect my loot.
---
Ok, thanks everyone.
---
Season 2 has way better rewards. I love the red armor skins for every armor set. I love the miniature train set, the green house build set, unique power armor jet pack, the tube thingy in nuke silos, bench press bar, the mini games, power armor displays, bos bunker an 2 more skins for the handmade. It's all just good to me an way better than season 1 in every way.
---
What ?
---
Yes and no. AA, because it’s a different calculation, is actually quite good now. On a fully optimized bloodied HW build, my AAE 50cal was only doin about 10% less damage than my BE 50cal.
---
Ohhh, that explains it - I saw someone with a dozen or so spread out over two camps and had no idea what it was either.
---
I noticed this in a lot of level 50 camps or below.
---
Higher levels know they're cheating pieces of shit, build a giant ugly ass building to hide it behind a locked door.
---
I find these fuckers disgraceful. To cheat and sell it for shitty value.
---
One guy I saw doing this shit, selling fucking 10mm for 10 caps a round. 2mm electromatic for 50 cap a round.
---
And 5.56 was worse.  100 caps a round.
---
Get people to let their guard down. It's the Internet, people lie.
---
I mean, I'm a working adult and it takes me maybe an hour a night, tops. I'm level 77, and I play pretty damn casual.
---
They should change them to weekly totals, though, rather than dailies.
---
What? Had me until the last sentence.
---
Gotta get that ballistic fiber from SOMEWHERE, right?
---
To what end?  Free stimpaks?
---
Where do our photos get stored? I'd like to kill a few out of my loading screens. Edit: playing on PC.
---
I took over a workshop to get the score and didn’t build it up. Someone took it over , but not completely, so they could run me for caps and keep the pvp active. Noticing this, I ignored them, at least until they got tired of it, found me, and started shooting at me while I was pacifist and runs like a middle schooler ding dong ditching. I turn off pacifist, and find this jerk harassing someone at their camp. Well, I vaporized his ass to my delight, and the delight of the low level that griefer was buggin. Never saw them again. I love dishing to people who deserve it.
---
Nah, disagree. I don’t play PvP so if there’s a way to prevent griefers from ruining my play session, I’ll take it. They can go back to the server that’s dedicated to PvP. F*ck ‘em. If this game was PvP only, I never would have bought it in the first place.
---
Junkie's is not a build. VATS, stealth, melee, commando, power armor, these are all builds; and you can slot Junkie's into any of them for more damage. Bloodied is a build because it has several mecessary perks and mutations beyond the legendary effect itself.
---
And y'all need to get an Instigating weapon. Or a fast Furious weapon. Or a Quad weapon. Or Vampire's on an automatic or shotgun. Junkie's and Bloodied aren't the be all end all.
---
Could be out of game stuff.
---
Thank you.
---
Everything has been a bullet sponge since day 1, that's part of why i quit. The enemies take a ridiculous amount of damage and the only way to reduce it a little is with perks, but to use those perks, you can't use weight reduction perks. The game remains unplayable in one way or another.
---
Watch out we got a badass over here
---
Dang I didn’t know that, thanks for pointing it out. Now if only it worked for ultracite ammo lol.
---
If you play on pc there's a mod called 'make balloons not meat piles'. I haven't lost a corpse since I installed it. Immersion breaking for sure, but no more lost legendary items
---
HA sounds about right
---
Yes, there is.
---
Cycling lights and the light box can both manually step through colors or be directly controlled in color and brightness from a terminal.
---
Like what?
---
I've not fought the SBQ or the WC on the pts yet, but i've done a few Daily ops and the obligatory clear of  Westek and the time to kill feels exactly the same to me. If you couldn't see your damage numbers in your pip boy i don't think many would have even noticed that it went down honestly. You know what the kneejerk sky-is-falling attitude in this sub is like.I'm still 1 or 2 shotting super mutants (especially considering that they are now existing upto level 100)But as i said, i've not had a chance to see what it feels like against something tanky like the SBQ. Everything else in the game feels the way it did before.
---
Herbivore/Carnivore double non-hunger benefits now? (Re:Relish/Fungus)
---
Tbh I am planning on just ignoring the legendary perk cards. Will get them when they show up but sure as hell won't grind for them. Would rather they removed/raised the stash limit and the character limit at the same time. Fallout 1st has kind of proved to me though that they will probably never touch stash limit again. Would rather screw people out of money that people will unfortunately pay for.
---
They have said that perk loadouts mean you shouldn't need multiple characters but that's dumb due to different builds needing different specials plus rp reasons and the ability to build different camps.
---
Load outs are the thing I want the most at the moment. Have a character that flips between heavies, shotguns and melee. Annoying when I'm out running shotgun and someone launches a nuke and there's 2 minutes worth of me frantically trying to change all my perks for heavy power armor. Just swapping to a different set would be a much better qol.
---
Id rather that if someone is occupying your spot and they leave than your camp will be placed.
---
&gt;4 has a game breaking bug no mod or BGS support has fixed
---
Out of genuine curiosity, what is this bug?
---
I can completely agree. I’d love to see further changes made since these were so nice. I have to go one type at a time to know the amount of the batch I’m about to scrap, but I guess I haven’t been bothered by it so much since I wouldn’t even have the thing built in my camp before and now I’ll use it when I have a built up grenade rounds, mini nukes or things like that 
---
And I always cash out for shot gun ammo. seems helpful for that
---
I love that as well. It's way more fun than bloody mess.
---
I’m not level 50 yet, but I would love to enter.
---
Stupid, sexy Flanders
---
I quit once hockey playoffs started up again. Same old challenges daily and I don’t want to spend hours each day all summer. I got other things to do and some vacation time to travel.
---
This is easy to ignore though
---
Ok cool. It sucks the legendary perk system is down. I was worried with it being down that I wouldn't be able to pick the 2 cards im owed for lvl 50 and 75 when the system comes back.
---
15 intelligence you should be more of a conflict resolution guy IMHO
---
This reminds me so much of when I was a middle-management type with a senior executive just dumping dumb idea after dumb idea on us.... after way too much time wasted going back and forth, my immediate boss just told me to "find the yes"
---
I have a feeling the same shit is going on here and the upper level dudes got sick of hearing "yeah, but", so we get to live with the out of touch vision of someone who can't be assed with seeing why it is bad for the player base.
---
5 Gunsmith
---
3 Nerd Rage
---
1 Scrapper
---
3 First Aid -- because it actually \*does\* help low health builds using Diluted Stimpacks
---
3 Portable Power -- I am collecting Power Armor Frames for the Radiation Rumble event
---
You do you, sometimes things as soon as you do it you know its you. i run around in the commie death suit. I did one sbq to try it out, since its like a hazmat suit with a lil damage resist. Haven’t taken it off since
---
Also please fix fast toast bug and let 3-star toasters actually make 3-star toast and fix the rubberband toast damage if anyone hasnt mentioned before cuz im too lazy to use the reddit search and the burned build nerf sucks!!!!
---
Mine too
---
I’m gonna stop playing the game if they need bloodied
---
Im lvl 100 for season 1 and love the awards and extra shit i got.  Finally get mannequins in season 2.  Im stoked.  Some people will just never be happy regardless of whats going on.
---
There is a huge key difference between cod battle pass and the legendary run. 
---
For the legendary run if you miss dailys you can only get  the score through exp grind. 
---
For cod they literally give you exp passes/free battle pass tiers/ weeklys that do not expire on top of unlocking character missions. Etc etc. In short you have a way higher chance of finishing the cod battle pass than you do the legendary run. Even if you took a couple weeks up to a month on cof you could still spread out your play time.
---
How is it griefing when workshops are based on pvp? If you can't take that, don't claim them.
---
Yeah, that mods works until you get to the events where those balloons are used for decoration.
---
The glowing mod is imho superior because it really stands out and makes those pile visible from far away.
---
I never got burned out but thats just cuz I'm a checklist type of player anyways. It gives me something to do besides grind xp and legendaries is all I see it as. It makes it easier with a friend on the mic too.
---
How is it a trap?
---
Yes it is on PC. Hacked weapons an people using glitches are huge on PC it seems.
---
They’ve pulled an EA since the game launched.
---
To add on to this, with my main character I roleplay a responder so I wouldn't have much use for all of the raider camp items in the shop if I couldn't play a raider alt, even if I like the items.
---
Joking right? Could have sworn bash and explosive take up the same slot? Meaning can’t have both on the same weapon? Unless you’re on pc that is.
---
There’s so much unwanted ammo and chems I feel like there will always be freebies. I loved getting those when I started and it’s even nicer now returning the favors.
---
Trap caps are a thing? O.o explan what must I look out for?
---
Have you tried it in combat?
---
From what I’ve heard and can tell, ALL energy damage isn’t showing anything beyond base damage... emphasis on *showing*. In actual combat it’s apparently performing normally. I only tested very briefly with a Gatling laser I had, but it seemed true. Pip-boy said 30 damage; I was hitting an enemy for 46ish (and that’s after armor...)
---
Pa.  You don't need extra strength for heavy guns.
---
Yes please!  Make quick load outs that we can save and switch to quickly.  Moving perk card constantly is annoying as hell
---
Photo gallery on the menu
---
I don’t play either of them as well. I’m a full health heavy gun power armour build. Have no problems with anything.
---
No and no. Only after they uncloacked.
---
It happened to me yesterday
---
The 160m was the sum after day 3, it's entirely possible we could've got to 200m on the last day.
---
Same here, I tried Heavy tank and junkies too but it didn't take long to go back
---
LOL! No posing here. It took lots of Stimpaks and a few deaths too. :)
---
Pretty standard to drop items for new players, i usually will drop some decked out hunting rifles or pipe weapons with some ammo, maybe some plans or any low level 1 star legendaries if i have any and some meds.
---
Most higher level players aren't an issue unless you have a workshop and they try to take it or during events when people just wanna be assholes. Many will fast travel to help with defending during an event, in my case if I see someone in a place that i remember being difficult ill travel and help them out a bit maybe show them where some loot items are or unlock specific doors or terminals that are higher level.
---
If you are in an event and a bunch of people all start using the follow me or come here emote it means they are trying to get everyone over so they can all get their hits in so everyone gets a legendary item off of it. Sometimes you'll get people who will one shot the legendary and it will piss everyone off but majority of the time everyone tries to let everyone have a chance at it.
---
Im on PC as well, lvl 129 (or maybe 130 been a few days since I played), ever want someone to group up with DM me. Mostly hop on to collect currency with daily limits atm but I've got a handful of lower level friends I hop on and help out from time to time.
---
I did this once when I was about level 30 something, I took Hemlock Holes for the acid farm &amp; on the hill, I spotted a lvl +200 they crouched after I waved 'hi' &amp; went invisible.  Then out of nowhere comes another lvl +100 &amp; killed me in one shot. I was pretty upset quite honestly since that was the first time I'd ever taken a workshop. I assume the lvl +200 was the other person's babysitter. 
---
Anyway, I stayed there. Didn't move/respawn &amp; it blocked them from being able to take the farm. LOL. I stayed there for about an hour, they ended up leaving &amp; I got my farm back. They did manage to get my loot despite everything &amp; I did have a fair amount on me. 
---
Oh this was back in the day when I was a legit noob. Now, thanks to Fallout 1st I can farm to my heart's content without the hassle of other's trying to steal all my hard efforts away.
---
It does take a certain kind of jerk though to go &amp; bully a lvl 30 like that.
---
Vats, no. HUD or berry mentats just makes them easier to see.
---
The cloak is the same chameleon effect in-game already; can’t VATS that.
---
As a working adult, you can pretty much say that about everything else in life too.  :)
---
Mhmm. I’m a melee build (female character) who likes to roleplay as a golfer sometimes haha. The “golf skirt” outfit is super ugly and the “golf outfit” does not look good on my character. She looks like an old man. I just want her to be able to wear a cute-ish golf skirt, is that too much to ask? Lol.
---
Exactly, battle passes by default are "unfair" for working adults, its not a big deal because some items will be available for gold and the majority are cosmetics with 0 gameplay impact, people just need to get over their FOMO.
---
You’re welcome to join - just try to get to lvl 50 soon. We won’t be hosting anything till the end of the upcoming week
---
Hold your horse.
---
Infos from the PTS are still only preliminary, but one thing is certain bloodied will be nerfed. So to switch your build now is imho not the smartest move.
---
I think you should wait until the new damage-"math" is live and the legendary perks are available.
---
Oh we are. Peace through superior firepower. Talk softly and carry a big stick. Yup ;:
---
I spend maybe 95% of my time in regular armor.  With bloodied you don't always need that extra armor penetration.  Plus unyielding boosts all the stats except endurance,  which is nice for a number of reasons.
---
Saw one guy with about 50 of them, but he had them all unlocked with a giant "Free Ammo" sign. Was inviting a lot of low levels to his camp for free ammo. I know its an exploit and all, but I won't fault a guy for giving players ammo. Still though, I do wish we could regularly build at least one of those. Yes I know about the Armco Ammo machine, I got one, but it doesn't put out ammo as fast.
---
I paid, no regrets....been lvl 100 for awhile now.
---
I saw one that used fall damage, so make sure you have protection against that.
---
Just don't go shopping with your junk in the trunk.
---
Wow! These are awesome! I want Night Crawler right NOW! I do think rank 2 of Blue Collar needs a little fine tuning, though. What's the point of an extra 100 lbs more carry weight if you can still run regardless of being over encumberred? Maybe make the latter part a rank 3 effect? Then you have more reason to work towards it, but you could stop without feeling too bad about it because you already gained the +100 in rank 2.
---
Go to map then menu and scroll down to photo gallery
---
You can do both. My Heavy Build has 4 Unyielding on out of PA with an Armor Plated Backpack and with Calibrated Shocks on the Power Armor legs the carry weight is pretty much the same between the two
---
Workshops are PvP zones
---
Main reason I’m considering stabilized is so I can get headshots with my .50 lol
---
that's too bad. thank you.
---
Plus they currently nail you while cloaked, they don't uncloak as stated. 5 Colonel Gutsys nailing you while cloaked and in a cloud of black smoke created by the robobrains is not fun at all...just very frustrating.
---
I notice the lighting radius is lessened since the drop. And the difference between darkness and brightness is significantly different. The lighting doesnt illuminate far if it's coming from candle sources. Oil lamps and blue winter lights seem to but not candles, floor lamps and certain wall mounted ones. I also notice when exiting Whitesprings Station, at times, it's so bright in the doorway, its blinding. Anyone else notice this?
---
thanks. I'd test it myself but I keep getting a license agreement error.
---
Dude, really?
---
Come on, that belongs on the official PTS-Forum as a bug.
---
Your sound, yeah.
---
Doesnt extra strength give a damage bonus to heavies?
---
No?  Just melee weapons.
---
Then just don’t do it
---
There's a difference but the problem remains the same. Real life getting in the way of doing what's necessary to complete it.
---
# Come on Baby, Don't Grief the Griefer
---
^(- Blue Vaultsuit Cult) 
---
I kid. Grief the eff outta them
---
Yeah but Bloodied will still reign supreme according to that info. Plus I want to be bloodied lol. That’s just me and my preference. I already have the bloodied perks. I just need to switch SPECIAL points so I can get as much damage with heavy weapons as possible.
---
Dope
---
He was shooting your body, not to move it but to break your armour.
---
They aren’t turning everything into bullet sponges. A max level super mutant taking 4 bullets instead of 2 isn’t a “bullet sponge.” The only things that could maybe be considered bullet sponges would be boss enemies (imposter, Queen, colossus) which are supposed to be hard. Stop complaining that they’re making the game a tiny bit more challenging
---
Oh wow I feel like an idiot lmao. I thought that heavies and shotguns got damage bonuses because the perks you use to upgrade them fall under strength
---
At the main menu of the game.
---
I literally wouldn’t, but it’s required for the daily SCORE so I don’t have much choice. I stand by what I said. I will do whatever I can to avoid PvP. You do you, I’ll do me. I hate PvP, period. Calling it cheating is f*cking hilarious considering how many actual exploits people abuse in this game. I’ve never duped, I don’t own legacy’s, and I don’t play PvP.
---
Already reported it there, but its better when more people report it.
---
Lifesaving Armor has far better chances, both only work when downed and not dead. Savior is like 20% chance when maxed out IIRC, life-saving is 50% from just one piece
---
Oh yes, this is a great idea! Thank you.
---
Nuke zones last 4 hours not 1, this would be way too op
---
In that case I'm not entirely sure which would be better.  Unyielding will give you a massive perception boost too, just not sure how it stacks up vs the perk. You will have more AP in the armor if you're VATSing, so I'd probably still go Unyielding.  
---
Either way you'll get decent damage in, even with the scary PTS changes coming
---
The key problem does remain the same but my point is in cod you have every way to catch up.
---
In fo76 you do not. You miss it and even if you get one day a week to grind you're not catching up. 
---
This could easily be changed and there are changes supposed to happen in the pts to make it less grindy and more relaxed.
---
This should work great. A wonderful suggestion, thank you!
---
Yes. You have to join a team through the social menu before entering nuclear winter.
---
You could certainly test it, but I don't think so.
---
Oh cool! Love this.
---
I thinks it's totally wrong to grief low level players. I think to grief other players in general is bad enough, but picking on low levels just makes them less likely to play. Sorry that happened to you! But good on you for sticking it out and showing them a thing or two 😁
---
I’m only level 15, and I haven’t even moved away from 1,1,1,1,1,1,1 on my SPECIALs yet because I haven’t decided what gear I’m gonna use. I’m unsure wether I should go heavy guns (have an FE90 gat plas), 2H melee (picked up a BLD pole hook yesterday for 1500 caps), 1H melee (got a BSS40 ski sword), unarmed melee (got a BLD Deathclaw gauntlet), commando (have a BE50 handmade), or rifleman (have a BE25 lever action rifle).
---
Yeah you’re right. I wanna put my BE .50 to good use lol
---
i found the sound thingy
---
Welcome to MMO's as a whole. They are mostly for those with a lot of free time.
---
Mines detonate on players now, so that rarely works well.
---
Unless I forgot to turn off Pacifist? Maybe that’s why.
---
Would be nice if there were viable energy weapons outside of heavy guns.
---
I think for me it ended up being a conflict between wanting more diversity in the tasks and not wanting to spend a ton of time on any one challenge. Hopefully they come up with a good spread of reasonable challenges for season 2

It'd be nice to have more diversity, but in the end every time they tried to do something less generic it ended up being the most annoying challenge (go play the RNG lottery for a bobblehead, repair 10 armor/weapons, etc). I loved the ones that encouraged us to engage different parts of the game that get ignored (do Feed the World to get prewar food to eat, that sort of thing). 
---
Last night was the first time I've just ignored half the dailies. Got my rank for the day (86), game crashed, and decided I couldn't be bothered to relog.
---
Something tells me you'll do just fine with that :)
---
I don’t think it does because I’m herbivore and still can use canned dog food in a pinch.  Maybe a carnivore can verify, but I’m thinking no since it satisfies hunger with herbivore.
---
Forgot this event was even happening since all the posts now are complaining about PTS instead of this.
---
Yea I can prob try for an SS life saving piece. Switch out my one bolstering
---
For today out of luck
---
Well they did have to make an NPC whose head was a literal train because it couldn’t handle vehicles
---
🙋‍♂️I just do me, just melee. Not bloodied, junkie. If I hit stuff enough it dies, seems pretty simple🤷‍♂️
---
The entire event needs a rework
---
I honestly don't know.
---
Yeah it sucks in order to finish this one at rank 100 I had to save ATOMS for a while an use all the ones you get with the run to buy my way through the rest. I got to rank 60 by playing an bought the rest.
---
It's kinda weird. One day it shows completed and I can get gold bullion but the next days it's refreshed but I can't get gold bullion and today the same thing happend of no gold bullion and that totals two days in a row of that. I'm not as mad considering I'm at rank97 for the run but it is getting annoying
---
No it doesn't...apparently it wasnt made w meat in that dog food...means it was cheaply made....poor dogges
---
Dang, I'm on ps4. I guess this is one of the few times I wish I was on pc lol
---
I respectfully disagree. With trying to sell legendary weapons in your vending machine, manufacture ammo, display items in your camp, etc. There's just not enough room. Throw 3 heavy weapons in your vending machine and that's already a tenth of your storage capacity. To have a fully set up vending camp, you either have to use the scrap box or only have like 2 personal guns and no junk stored at all. There's not enough storage and there's no question about it. Otherwise the scrap box wouldn't exist in the first place.
---
It's like getting married, working full-time and having children may not be compatible to playing videogames games every day.
---
It is. I am with Bethesda on this one. Lots of weeklies and fewer dailies would be better, but that's all. 
---
Can't play as much as we used to? Sure. That's life. 
---
There are tons of games I stopped playing because I can't invest the amount of attention and time they ask for. Talking to you, Divinity Original Sin.
---
Those new players under 50 can also complete the dailies since non of them are absurd request, hell it's easier for them to level up than the 300+ ones. Also they did add more dailies, even though you still could complete it with days to spare without doing the nw ones.
---
Thanks for the kind words! I only have a few heavy-specific damage boosting perks, adrenal reaction, and nerd rage and it already does 259 damage per shot
---
You also can't get rid of it once it's placed without moving your entire camp.
---
Ah those poor doggos lol. Guess I didn't need carnivore anyway, my dudes already pretty much the toxic avenger he's so mutated
---
CoD was an example. And some of those things like the "free" tiers you still have to spend money to get. 
---
But even if you made it easier there's still going to he the issue of people not completing it due to real life. How easy do you want to make it because there's people now who've completed it long ago and even me who started playing casually about 2 weeks ago are already more than half done with it.
---
To each their own, I guess. Whenever I see that daily I try to see how fast I can open the map, hit the photomode button, take a picture, and get out lol
---
Glances angrily at stellaris 😂
---
I was in one of them with you, looked around for a while after the event but there wasn’t shit😡
---
I don't play either.  I am often the only person on a public team with full health.
---
Play The Division them come back here before you talk about bullet sponges.
---
It satisfies hunger with carnivore, too. All junk/pre war food does. Just no bonuses.
---
Your karma correlates with the number of upvotes your posts/comments receive.
---
From people liking your posts and if on the market from ppl you trade with they will give you 1 karma per trade
---
And then if there happen to be any lunchboxes still around yours and your group's inventory, +25% more XP per lunchbox that gets opened, up to 4 for a 100% boost. For that heavy hitter of XP gain
---
PROTECT AND SERVE
---
You like have to have alts to play this game. But getting them where they need to be is so tedious an feels awful. Extra feels bad when you have plans like holiday ones that are time locked etc an bullion plans you have to get over an over again.
---
Because just splitting it isn't actually how  shotgun works and it would also seriously underpower all split barrles
---
If you make comments people think are of interest they will upvote you, and if you add to existing threads with useful comments you may also get upvoted, they will give you karma. It doesn't actually benefit you really.
---
I upvoted your post so +1
---
They need to ditch the whole coin concept or not scrap cards to get them, it's the opposite of what we want. We want flexibility but they are forcing us to stick with one build by incentivising scrapping unused cards, it's literally the worst way to do it.
---
Right.  As long as you like using the weapons that are already more powerful.  Im really y dreaing what one wasteland is going to do to my revolver character. Or my Rambo(exploding arrow bow and combat knife) character. Once I can't go to a lower level area and have fun with a non meta build, im out.
---
If I have the game through steam, Am I able to play the PTS by logging in through the Bethesda launcher Or Does it require you have purchased the game direct?
---
Bethesda are truly embarrassing. This has happened to other items too IIRC, pretty sure one of the gillie mods made first person ADS impossible.
---
This event feels very... underwhelming in the grand scheme of things. Dumping excessive amounts of material into a bin for mediocre return an event does not make.
---
You the real MVP!
---
Most likely a explorable location like Vault 79 is now.
---
And also a Daily Ops location.
---
My sleep schedule if beyond messed up with the quarantine and such. 
---
I was doing “chores”:  cooking, cleaning, mending and the like. It kind of made me consider getting Fallout 1st so I could run the private server once in a while.
---
Tbf im not OP but i do rock a Nocturnal 3* unarmed and a NE shotty
---
just because theyre not OP all the time doesnt mean theyre useless
---
also on that note
---
stalkers is hot garbage
---
Don't mention those damned mounted heads 😂
---
Also it wasnt usable with backpacks for over a month.
---
Also: please can we wear under armour with it too?
---
I don’t see it that way at all. There’s still gear that’s better than other gear, still builds that will outperform other builds, they’re just not 1000 miles away from each other. I’m not convinced I’m in love with the change, but it’s not as dramatic as people are making it out to be. My Bloodied Stealth Commando is still king of the mountain, the mountain just isn’t as tall as it was.
---
I really hope they chang it soon.
---
Sneak 3 and escape artist help the swarms. Chinese stealth armor added to that is crazy. You can stand in broad daylight and not be seen. Your experience makes me think going towards bloody or junkie might end up being the preferred way to get good damage and that would be the opposite of balancing. I hope it gets some iterations as well, and not just dumped into our laps. If legendary perk cards are in any indication they will probably make some tweaks. Do you use the same character for PTS that you do in production server? I was thinking of downloading but wasn’t sure if going back and forth is a good idea
---
I glitches the metal defense post thing in there and destroyed it with a flamethrower to build on top and had to stack the new chain tires next to it to make it blend into the walls! If I had to tell someone to buy anything at all, it would be the vault tec generator and those tires.
---
Yeah but someone asked right after it came and Lady Devann said it was supposed to have the hat an being looked into.
---
So good, bad indifferent? Should I just nix food carrying perks and not bother dealing with the buffs?
---
Just say it you don’t want anything but bloodied to ever work
---
ash heap! In the south like damn near very bottom of the map
---
No you're not.  I have zero interest in FOTM cookie cutter builds, especially state dependant builds.
---
I think I track whats going on here. When I open packs and get the gold one it will replace a standard one. So the other day I opened one and got  a gold rifleman.  It replaced my standard rifleman rank one. But that still doesn’t cover your spread of missing 264 coins.
---
I wouldn't even consider changing a thing until about a week or so after this stuff gets released. There will be plenty of reviews, plenty of boo's, and hopefully it's not bugged.
---
Dude the seasons system has worn me the fuck out. Leveling up every day, killing legendaries...it’s just a chore at this point. I don’t even care if I beat the run at this point, it’s just not fun. I’ve been reverting back to 4 and New Vegas. 
---
It just sucks that this was supposed to be something good for the game and turned it into a clusterfuck of repeated tasks. If it were five weeks, it would be so bad. But at this rate it’s worse than grinding for $$$ selling meth in GTA online...
---
They could be trying to infiltrate your mind with COMMUNIST PROPOGANDA
---
She said she would look into it, yes. 
---
The point is we would have no idea about the headwear if the blank image was never in the shop.
---
Nothing will change as long as they can get people to spend real money for the atom shop. And now some of the items in the C.H.O.R.E. rewards are in the atom shop. And they know people are burning out on it. Counting on it, even. You won't finish it in the time given, but you'll buy what you missed out on. So all this was just a pretty way to dress up yet another money grab.
---
I would definitely do that. Because if it changes over you will not have access to the old board.
---
Don't forget the Dog Food perk card, dogfood a most excellent non perishable foodstuff but fairly heavy if not running Thru-Hiker.
---
140/140/1000Rad at max level.
---
Surgical masks. I want a clean mask.
---
I guess they should have an easy button for you. Go play animal crossing.
---
They are permanent untill you cure them
---
Bethesda: "Then buy our atoms pleb"
---
Daily atom challenges/weekly atom challenges would be so much better.
---
Agreed!
---
Lol. I have 6 hens IRL and they produce 90% shit, 10% eggs.
---
Probably best not to take a chance, FYI make sure to put the trail fireworks on your primary. When equipped it reloads any gun like 10x faster. It’s awesome.
---
It takes like 20 mins to do the daily score
---
Yeah I have a LVL 15 Instigating Explosive. Still use it at lvl 200+ an it still does broken dmg as a rifle build.
---
Oh I wish! PS4!
---
Strange that the Arktos lab coat in PS4 isn’t like that!
---
I use the same character on PTS and live and well I used to use the stealth suit and all stealth related perks but switched to unyielding armor and stealth boys as it seemed better overall but enemys see you when you start hitting them and the stealth multiplier seemed kind of "broken" in PTS too only really paid attention to the rifle there though so I will need to test when I can play again (I don't really have enough time to play right now) I will also test the stealth suit again while I am at it but even if stealth helps that would just cause problems for the ops as you will never be able to stealth ther, just so you know I will probably only be able to test more in about 14-16h
---
For me this is all wait and see. I'm not going to consider changing or doing anything until about a week or so after this release. If they bug everything up or they wind up trying to hot fix it making changes will only cost me twice. I've learned a while ago just let the change happen and wait.
---
Sucks for your friend but can you make one for me too because I’m built different meaning I won’t die
---
Why can’t the coins just be based on levels gained instead of scrapping cards?  It seems easier for everyone and more fair to people who decided to try different builds.
---
Boil em' mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew.
---
I might be wrong. But you’re supposed to unlock everything on the scoreboard for every character regardless of which character you play as
---
The exception being the gold, atoms, script and caps. Those will go to whichever character you are currently playing as.  
---
Again. I might be wrong. But that’s what I’ve been under the impression so far.
---
There isn't a male swimsuit at all, so if you do that one scout badge with a male character, you have to wear the women's swimsuit. A pair of Hawaiian print trunks was that hard?
---
I am sorry you lost your friend. This is a lovely memorial to him, thank you for sharing it. Add a candle from the rest of us.
---
I refuse to grab ore because EVERY time I do a scavenger dies. So I stay in the main area and alternate healing and tagging. Very rarely complete the event correctly cuz no one else wants to give up exp for ore but keeping all 4 scavengers alive gives me hope it might be completed 🤕
---
Nice
---
Eh, I run around in power armor and using anti armor +10% damage ultracite gatling. It works just fine and I don't need to worry about repairs for about 2 years when it comes to the armor.
---
That same character does have a BE 50cal and 3 pieces of unyielding secreti service armor (dropped, not crafted) so in theory I could swap over at some point, but meh. Meta, who cares.
---
What have you developed?
---
How does it feel to be the goob?
---
I think you spelled butt ugly wrong lol
---
Heck, if they just limited it to two OR three stars, that'd be fine with me. One star weapons from a lvl 100 sounds like a slap in the face
---
Right, I didn’t think it was herbivore exclusive.  Prewar foods don’t follow the herbivore/carnivore rules.
---
File a support ticket for a refund, they'll usually refund the atoms and you keep the item.
---
Sadly, there are a couple of achievements (Xbox)  where you have to kill players.  I guess some people take great joy in it once they get a taste for it, they must be forgetting there is Hunter vs Hunted and Nuclear Winter so yeah, utter griefers if they're doing it outside of those 2 options.
---
It is strange though how you can report people for things like this, yet Bethesda had the bright idea of placing achievements in the game to make you kill other players. Then tell you off for doing it. Bethesda logic, huh!
---
I personally keep Pacifist switched on now &amp; only take workshops in a private server. I love nothing more than watching some smart-butt waste a ton of his/her ammo trying to kill me, only to be doing pretty much no damage. It's funny to watch them keep trying LOL.
---
What level is that FE90 gat plasma
---
Yeah I'm talking just about the character specific stuff. I've claimed all the accout wide items.
---
50.
---
Thank you, that means a lot :) I'll do just that
---
That’s a really good point
---
I would argue that whilst workshops are PVP zones, if another player contests one just to be a dick and disrupt other people's enjoyment, then they themselves are not playing the game in good faith. In which event the gloves are off, and if xpheolix has found a way to exploit the blocking feature to gain an advantage over an asshat... then good on em.
---
Unfortunately their main goal of the Legendary Run isn’t necessarily to fairly reward playtime.  It appears to be specifically designed to encourage you to login every day and maybe spend atoms if you get behind.
---
Hang in there. ♥
---
I just hope there is some time between this season and the next. I could really use a break from 76.
---
Hey, don't go dissing those glowing giant mole rats who want their hair nice! Lol
---
I love that idea of durability loss!
---
Have you tried building the lamp though?
---
Good things they reward repair kits like candy.
---
How about we get a perk coin every time we level up after level 99 and lower the xp cap
---
Honestly, I haven't had an issue.  I usually log in at 8AM and finish all the daily tasks within the hour before the 9AM reset for my timezone and then log off for the rest of the day since I'm waiting for new events/content.  Although to be fair I usually skip the Nuka World challenge since I have zero interest in that mode and half the time it's super time consuming like finding and using stimpacks, killing players, or waiting for 30 minutes playtime.  The only ones I'll do are set up a CAMP which I can immediately do then quit out.  But I'm pretty ahead of the green ship on the map at this point so I'd consider that good.  Not sure how much longer it's going for but I don't think you need to pay at all to complete it if you can dedicate at least an hour a day to the game.
---
The keycard is too expensive to have it do this.  Drives me nuts.
---
Lolol
---
They drop ammo based on the gun u killed them win
---
I know it's officially called an event, but by no means should we consider it one.
---
It’s only melee weapons
---
Nah man it's all good just game the way you want, if your looking for alternatives for damage output tho instigating for single fire weapons and furious for automatics, good way to make up the difference without the negatives of junkies or bloodied
---
Since you are vulnerable; your teammates can take aggro then you come in and finish em off
---
Buy another copy of Skyrim and then resources can be allocated to this project.
---
It should be stupid easy to run an "inventory audit" on login for each to look for anything that can't exist within the existing weapon and mod framework.  Might be a few weeks of writing the logic and it might be an extra 5 second delay when loading in but it would eliminate this issue once and for all.  Knowing beth though it would just accidentally delete all weapons and swap the map out for skyrim.
---
Cryptid Mascot outfits

New Water Purifier skins/camp items that give you purified water
---
I've just been free balling it since I lost mine in a Nukashine bender.
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
Are you on ps4 by chance?
---
What lamps are you trying to connect directly to a power source? All of the lamps I use just need like electricity wifi to work. Maybe you moved a power conduit that was powering these lamps?
---
Hell, they did it in Borderlands 3.  Anything blue or higher that's left on the ground (or falls through it, falls off a cliff, left in an opened chest, etc.).  It's also across all characters, which gives a leg up to new characters.
---
Your *dirty* underwear. You'd think, with all the washing machines and Abraxo laying around that some vault dweller could put those things together and wash their undies.
---
Had it happen to me today for the first time.
---
Yes. That's why I said it isn't showing as me having purchased it. In build mode it still says I need to purchase the lamp despite it supposedly being in the bundle I bought.
---
I'd like to add to enjoy this now because patch 22 fixed this.
---
The advantage of wearing unyielding is that all of your stats go up. Means you pass all your speech checks, get the intelligence experience bonus, and the high perception appears to increase range and vats accuracy.
---
Clean bathtub and toilet
---
Oh cool! Ty! Did you have to do the whole chair on stairs glitch for the underground part I’m assuming?
---
I'm not planning on changing anything I just wanted to see what the big deal was. 
---
And the math turned out weird. People are all poopy about it being additive instead of multiplicative but in reality the it's not truly that either.
---
I’m a naturally slow player at Bethesda games and working multiple jobs doesn’t help. I’m still at level 19 lol. Zorbo is already in the homestretch.
---
Time limited gameplay and me don’t mix.
---
Looks like they didn't touch it at all. You still need food and water and you still get debuffs then you hungry and/or dehydrated.
---
I love that level of petty. This is the perfect amount of petty.
---
Thank you. In a way a lot of him is still with us all so I guess he isn't totally lost. I'm not, I'm on XB1
---
Maybe open it to exploration like 94
---
Indeed, at least they let us have it for patch 21
---
I honestly wish that was still a thing
---
I'm only gonna use a meat hook for meat week now
---
Of course!
---
Oh, dang. I was going to ask to visit it and leave some stuff, but I'm on PS4.
---
Alright INT -15 Dweller,get out.
---
That’s Charisma.
---
The white skull raider mask from the season board looks great with the mountain scout outfit,  just sayin
---
I'm trying to use the mr.peeps lamp and the space lamp you get from the end of the legendary run and I moved the lamp right on top of power and still nothing
---
I'm at rank 97, without any atom rank ups. The only reason I'm at that level is due to being furloughed from work since March. When I go back to work in September I know I'll be nowhere near on the next run. I had really taken advantage of that double xp and score events, and maximising XP/INT buffs as much as I could. I find most of the challenges are completed within a normal play session without having to check - apart from NW if it's anything other than placing a camp. But it's still tedious having to login everyday to achieve the score, and it is entirely FOMO and I don't need to do it, but I do. I don't have any kids, so it's much easier for me to play when I want, so I feel for you parents who can only play a couple hours a day :(
---
My fave toon is a berserker and I’m seeing nothing to love at all between this and daily ops. And if the difference is so minute between builds or gear you need a calculator to see it this is a disincentivising move on Beth’s part
---
I run batteries included, stabilized, nerd rage, and gunsmith 3. It works well for me. You could swap gunsmith to rank 5 and throw on scrapper.
---
It's the level up one that really boils my piss 1-3 hours grinding a level is not fun when you're forced to do it, also it's 500 score so you feel like you need to do it......
---
I appreciate the thought, thank you!
---
The fact that this game has become Grind Simulator 2018 has made me stop playing it. It's honestly just not worth the stress or my time anymore.
---
I'm not on the PTS but from the information I've seen its costs 1 perk coin to remove a card every time
---
You don't need the helmet anyway. Just like every other helmet, it's just cosmetic.
---
I fucking love how we have people that haven't even tried out the PTS build yet are in a rush to call all the changes the worst things to have ever happened in  the history of the game.  
---
Everyone that's actually played the build is like "I used to take one or two shots to kill everything, now it takes 2-6" meanwhile these people are "ITS GOING TO TAKE ME TWO HUNDRED BULLETS TO KILL A SUPER MUTANT!!!!1!1"
---
Lmao. To risk sounding like a stalker, Id have friended him instantly and would actively join his world everytime I seen him online. People like this are fantastic.
---
Hmm. Usually with these kinds of posts, turns out the person just bought the wrong bundle. I don't see a mega furniture bundle in my atomic shop anymore (just the diner set which doesn't come with the lamp) so I can't even check for ya. Maybe try hopping to a different server or just submit a ticket? They probably lack the ability to unlock the lamp for you but they can give you a refund and let you keep the rest of it.
---
I’d like to see a new event there
---
Apparently it does.
---
Didn’t see any increased reload speed with a handmade or a fixer.
---
No but you can eat raw meat for 40% hunger and 0 disease chance with carnivore
---
4 coins per level after 50 would work.
---
Can someone else not claim it if you still are within the area? I know I've claimed some that still had stuff people built in it, but they say unowned. If I'm just claiming it for the mission points, I leave a sign up. "No challenge claim. I don't need it."
---
They also have Mountaineer, personally I think "Mutantneer" with super mutants running it would be hilarious.
---
I’d like to see more atoms tbh
---
What do you mean by turning to dust? Are unsused perk card packs dissappear after a while or something?
---
It's a pretty big slap in the face to high level players who have lost a lot of cards, or have spent points moving builds around not knowing that we'd need all our levels to put into these legendary perks
---
Has anyone worked out what they are supposed to be for?
---
They never changed it. Damn shame as well
---
No, it applies a flat amount of healing per hit. You want a Shishkebab with faster swing speed, nothing else is relevant for Friendly Fire.
---
Jesus, you're one of the oldest gamers I've come across and I don't mean that with a nasty undertone either! Keep rockin on!
---
We need this since currently it isn't really worth the while to kill the scorched queen
---
No you didn’t, bash damage and explosive can’t be on the same weapon
---
Honestly is what I've done, donated 1k steel then nothing. I might do some cloth cause I got 2k of it and still taking up valuable stash space.
---
When you open them and you own those perks already is what i mean
---
Im just hoping that double xp events get way more common place after that legendary perk patch. We are going to need it. 
---
It’s looking like we are all going to have to be aiming for at least level 1,000...and here is me at 239 just shy of 1/4 of the way there. 1000 is definitely doable in two months, if they kept a double xp event going for 2 months solid. 
---
It would require pretty dedicated grinding though. At least 8 hours a day (with buff stacks and lunchboxes, group XP perks) and at lest 2 accounts with fallout first to flip flop between new clean unused servers on constantly. Clear all of white spring, clear all of westek and repeat on new server. You can get about 4-6 levels per round that way. 
---
It’s no small feat, but that’s the only way knocking out 1000 levels is doable without exploits.
---
Pistol builds are easy to fix. Just up the dmg number on them. Tank killer now affects them, so you can ignore resistances.
---
Your non meta build probably wasn't stacking a lot of multipliers, so it won't get affected as largely as bloodied/junkies (the meta builds)
---
Especially when they're blowing through so much ammo!
---
I work full time, manage to play daily. Have been hit with the daily autocomplete bug once, and also missed 4 total days altogether. 
---
Won't need to spend a dime to complete the Run, and will finish with about a week to spare. 
---
Just because you aren't able to complete something doesn't mean it's a "shitty business practice." It just means it was harder than you were able to manage.
---
Damn. Well, thanks for the info.
---
Yip people will say start a baby account but I don't think that's how Bethesda intended it to be played
---
hmh yes, no autocomplete in sight
---
The bug isn't that the hat is invisible and uncraftable, the bug is that it got added alongside the outfit in the first place.
---
They said we were getting an outfit, they showed us a picture of the outfit, we got the exact outfit.
---
Someone f'd up and included the base atom shop data for whatever headwear they may have been working on at the time but the actual model and everything important doesn't exist in our game files.
---
Just because the community rep said they were looking into it doesn't mean it actually exists or we were supposed to get it, they're just the community rep not the person who designed the outfit or coded it into the game.
---
Remember to collect the scrip during 50% off purveyor week. This will let you maximize this scrip outside of the 150 scrip day limit.
---
The imposter despawns into a metal pile if there are too many dead robots. If you cant find him he most likely turned into a metal pile
---
Just had to go look at some pictures, is it seriously only giving the skirt, graphically for PS4? And how dirty does yours appear? The one I wear has *VERY* light aging, but no dirt/grime.
---
This... Is actually quite interesting.
---
The least they could do is remove it from the atom shop so I don’t have an invisible square that does nothing.
---
I see your streets ahead
---
Yep - I’ll probably still play but my characters will retire, grow beards, and have a nice quiet house by a pond somewhere - shoot squirrels and deer from my porch and scavenge and talk about the old days when it didn’t take 3000 bullets to fight 1 queen.
---
Recently came back to playing after i stopped back in '18. Saw a guy selling Junk for 1 cap each and splurged 17k caps on all his junk. He left the server while i was in the vendor and i fell to my death while his buddy grabbed the Junk. Was quite the "Welcome Back". 
---
I 100% avoid any player vendors with bases on cliffs now.
---
It's a broken system and needs to change.
---
Has anyone tried, say, Fertile Soil on the PTS. Do those lv. 1 farmer bots and lv. 5 supervisors really scale higher to a high level player?
---
With people being concerned about melee being hit hard with the damage alterations on PTS recently, something like this might be a good way to bring back some of it. With perks you can get it up to 10min duration so you can pop it on harder fights.
---
It is, yes. I didn't write things down, but I'd guess killing super mutants in a daily op gives about half the XP of killing a super mutant at west-tek.
---
Should of just duped steel like everyone else.
---
The ammount of stuff that can be hacked  in Fallout76 is absurd, I've seen ppl with impossible weapons in NW (imagine a rifle that shoots grenades like a minigun), people with Infinite Ap, etc. The saddest thing is I don't think this will be ever fixed, they've reused so much legacy code from Fallout 4, I don't know how thry didn't see it would be easily exploitable.
---
Grinding for every single thing with daily caps is not fun to everyone. If the daily caps weren't as strict on every currency, sure but as it is now.. I can't blame people for wanting to make it easier where they can.
---
Here's a question for your question, what are fireworks supposed to be used for outside of new years and 4th of july?
---
Use the BoS Lab Coat. It's clean.
---
It is by design.
---
I'm not saying it's awesome. I'm saying it's purposeful.
---
Scaring away ghosts
---
Sure thing! Yeah... I feel for you. I truly hope that development will consider all of this feedback. Some balancing might be appropriate, but the state that unarmed appears to be on the PTS specifically seems way, way too far weakened. Unarmed play style has to be a considered a valid case with the tweaks they are making, and dropping it so dramatically I have to optimistically believe is not intended for live.
---
I personally dig much more a Melee with 40% faster swing, 40% extra dmg in power sttacks and vampire status.
---
It's not a skin, it is another mod that you should craft.
---
So yes, you need those flux. May give you some if you are on PC.
---
I respectfully disagree.
---
Not having a scrapbox was the situation for everyone since day one before players could subscribe and receive one. When it was released, nothing was taken from anyone. Every person who plays has exactly the game they were promised, along with some new enjoyable content released almost every quarter.
---
Players CAN optionally subscribe, which helps cover ongoing development and delivery costs, which also provides to the player some quality-of-life features that are not required to play and do not give players a competitive combat advantage.
---
If you do not like having to micromanage your storage as much as was done originally, you are free to subscribe. You also get Atoms every month, some free cosmetics that non-subscribers do not get, the tent, and access to your own private server if you want to be left alone sometimes.
---
They say you can vote with your wallet. But, if you are not subscribing, they are already not making any money from you, so why would they give you MORE things for free, things which make it LESS likely you would subscribe?
---
If I were Bethesda, I would do exactly what they are doing.
---
Math on damage was changed to additive. So it would be 50*(1+.2+.2+.2+.15).
---
It is 100% possible that I bought the diner set and thought I bought the mega bundle after looking up stuff about it. Explains why I don’t have the cooler either lol. Well I feel like a dick.
---
The literal least they could do is nothing and just leave it there.  It's not doing any damage other than confusing some people.
---
You can't just reskin sadly. You have to craft the new one. Really sucks since I've got a legacy jetpack ultracite arm piece haha
---
You have Vault Boy Headlight installed on your Excavator?
---
Chances are they’ll change things up or it won’t even be ready for patch 22
---
Re-allocating special points.
---
The other side of that coin is that if things are closer together it allows players to choose builds and gear based on what they like, rather than just chasing DPS. There are positives and negatives. I’m not ready to condemn it yet, more am I ready to embrace it. I’ve been playing the PTS and it just isn’t the nightmare people are describing. 
---
Daily Ops definitely need a little work. They’re a great idea, but the enemy mutations are probably a bit too restricting. Every Op negates stealth? It’s one thing to push players out of their comfort zone, it’s another to make their builds completely impotent for that content. 
---
Plus, all this is still in testing. None of it is set in stone, if it was, they wouldn’t ask for player input. We should all just take a deep breath, the sky isn’t falling...at least not yet.
---
Yeah, if it becomes a team game i'll probably be out m'self. Too much stress, but hey, maybe I'll swing in and design an interior if they ever come out - if I don't uninstall for another game (I can only have one).
---
The Legendary Run is not required to play well. It offers no combat advantage. It is optional. Any pressure you feel is something you place on yourself. If you don't have the time to play, then don't play. Do not let a game rule your life.
---
Far as I saw, the boss never dropped anything but ammo and regular guns, and I never saw anything normal legs. No idea how old his vid is. But I'll amend my statement, maybe I missed something or was unlucky.
---
Nah, on my mining helmet. Can't put lights on the Excavator unfortunately.
---
I think he's referring to the ArmCo ammunition machine you can buy from Mortimer for bullion, that works the same way as the factory in your CAMP.
---
Yeah I am somewhat hopeful that there will be some more changes, in general I see why it makes sense to change to an additive system, it's much more intuitive as well in my opinion but they definitely need to adjust a few things for it to work properly especially in combination with other changes
---
If you put it on the right times it works
---
Basically legendary spawn at 6 / 3:30 and 2
---
Never worked been like that since release but on pts it’s working properly
---
We did this post is misinformation
---
Happens all the time 😏
---
I'd say Destiny, *after* Taken King. Lots of end-game activities hunting down collectibles to unlock weapons, the raids were interesting, and there was always something to do, either on Oryx's ship, in a strike or a nightfall. Plus SRL was hands down the best part of D1.
---
Sunglasses I think will reflect better for that “anime villain” look. Welders goggles are pretty good too.
---
The headpiece isn’t “most of it”. Actually it’s a small part of it
---
I tried it in combat and made an estimate of how much damage I will do post nerf. Thanks, you were right.
---
What!! I would be so mad! People can be so shady, I'm sorry that happened to you! I go to cliff bases in PA now after falling to my death a few times. But still, that was so set up for sure.
---
You shouldnt be in the game when the dailys reset. This happened to me too today because i missed loggin out.
---
See that's why I gave up on trying to learn every plan. Bethesda makes them almost impossible to get for months and then randomly goes "here's an easily duped item that drops this .003% chance plan on a regular basis, get fucked nerd."
---
Do you mean they should work with shotgunner cards? Do they? I run commando and use various energy weapons my fave being a two shot with a splitter. I have had the urge lately to move over to shotgunner or a hybrid of the two if the shotgunner cards work with it.
---
Same. Donated steel, then opted out of cork. Just bulked and vendored what I had saved for the rest. Couldn't care less about this so-called event.
---
Well i went 150 lvls not using either until I got my hands on an amazing junkies explosive gatling gun haha
---
*cue X-Files theme*
---
I think it's because they have perk card based bonuses, but at least they work in a pinch to get hunger down without wasting items with good buffs
---
great channel!
---
I've never seen a 0 weight weapon. But a lot of the melee weapons get to 0.1 with the 90% weight reduction mod.
---
With the Martial Artist perk that weight would go down. Is it possible you have that equipped?
---
Well I've just installed a new modded FO4 extended edition mod and Skyrim Phoenix flavour mod. So much better actually enjoying a game.
---
I think that’s normal? We got two more weeks to go and a SCORE double event coming. You’ll hit 100 soon enough on your schedule.
---
That was it!! It just bounced up out of nowhere! I was wondering how he managed that.
---
I still work 40 hours a week during this entire COVID fiasco and Im currently at level 85 on the gameboard. I dont bother with the NW challenges and only aim at leveling up when I need to go after the Weekly Challenge. So my play sessions are roughly 1-2 hours a day depend on the daily challenges and event rotation. That being said, they really need to rebalance the value of challenges to properly reflect the effort you need to put in. When you can craft 10 items for your CAMP in literally seconds and it rewards you the same SCORE as hunting down 3 legendaries. I know that "Leader of the Pack" spawns 3 legendary wolfs and that means you just gotta put in a little extra legwork, but the event gets a bit congested/competitive on a public server and adds to more aimless playtime until the event starts again or RNG is in your favor. We still have until September 8th to keep grinding at the gameboard but at the end of the day it just shiny cosmetic BS and hopefully we can choose what we want to buy once the season ends instead of gameboard advancements.
---
Exactly, time gates and grinds, peace out✌️ I don’t have time for that.
---
This. So many live games use a prestige system and that works (mostly). But leave it to Bethesda to try to reinvent the wheel. Again. It's like they're working in a cave, completely oblivious to how other games work. Or even how their own games work for that matter.
---
You do not have to spend money to get the free tiers im speaking of. When I say free I mean literally free. You log on and they are free. 
---
The issue is any example you make of a different games battle pass to compare it to that isn't a mobile game fallout 76 is just the only one designed this way. That is play daily to get score or get left behind. Hey, that's fine. But when you're comparing it to other games battle pass system this is simply the most punishing to casual players. 
---
The people who completed it long ago either paid (which is their choice) or grinded the exp heavily (also their choice). The people who grinded it are by no means casual players no matter how much they try to claim they are. Those are the hard-core players and they deserve the rewards. Keep in mind this isn't content. This is supposed to be just another reason you play and enjoy fallout 76. 
---
Personally I'd be done with it as well by now but I absolutely refused to do NW dailys by choice. 
---
This isn't about how "easy" the pass should be. All the op is asking for is a way to catch up. Would it be too hard for them to keep weeklys up? 
---
But at the end of the day as I said they are testing to make the next season give more daily score so it will end up being more "easy" anyways. Which I'm sure is because of the feedback they got on how this season has played out for casual players.
---
Something similar happened to me too.someone was buying my guns with a lower price.I set the price for one of the guns to 2500 and instead got 2100 caps.
---
FYI: I tested recently, and the live version of Bloody Mess is not multiplicative on everything. For my Bloodied Build, it did multiply the damage of Commando and Nerd Rage, but not Adrenal Reaction.
---
is the *railway rifle* a *rifle*?
---
Nope, it’s not just you. Try hitting a liberator at point blank with a shotgun... 4 shots, all missing the target. Also entering and exiting Vats is slow, like its lagging like mad. 
---
I hope it’s addressed in the next update.
---
For real. I redownloaded my creation club content and fixed up my load order for mods. Now I can do what I wanna do, not what Bethesda’s investors want us to do. 
---
It’s so blatantly obvious they just want us to log in for a few hours every day and don’t give a flying fuck about the quality of the content anymore. And replacing Atom challenges with Score was a BIG mistake if you ask me...I’ll never put money into the atom shop again as long as they make it pay to win style. It just sucks that they’re shunning their own player base with each update. It’s not even fun anymore.
---
They're all listed on here.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Treasury_note
---
Oh I see. Thanks for the comment!
---
I missed the first week and I'm almost level 80. We've still got about a month. Takes me 30 minutes a day to do all my challenges. I'm comfortable I'll be able to hit the 90s without spending a cent, and then I can use the free atoms to finish my way up.
---
I run heavy PA using vampires weapons. I dont think its a build, its just fun. Do what makes you happy.
---
Thanks for the help :)
---
Yup :/ it is a cleaner of the lab coats
---
Unfortunately the 50’s aesthetics that the world of Fallout froze in for like 90 years or so only had women wearing skirts. Because women totally never wore pants before the sixties. 😐
---
Same problem with my vats commando character.  One out of every 5 or 6 shots would actually do any damage. I went back to my heavy guns character.
---
I seem to attract the kind where a single digit level player follows me around alternately emoting in my face and shooting me. Pretty sure their game is to get me to turn off Pacifist to attack them so their hidden friend can one shot me. You can't harm under 10s or 5s or something. They need to fix that so that it's "you can't harm people a certain number of levels different from you" outside of PvP events.
---
The one QA person at Bethesda still hasn't figured out you can switch to firstperson view.
---
I wanted to use welding goggles! But every location I went to either didn't have them or "bug"thesda glitched them out and I can't pick them up
---
When I was a low level, tons of people were constantly dropping plans and other things for me, so I keep a ridiculous amount of plans for the sole purpose of dropping in my camp under a billboard that says ‘free shit’ for anyone who drops by.  It’s also how I get rid of my excess stimpaks, radaway, rad-x, etc
---
They’re already worth the grind.
---
The consensus in the thread seems to be "Yeah, you can do it as a working adult, but you have to follow an exact singular build path to make it work."
---
Which just sounds like a ton of fun.
---
I think a broad slider with rw and the mod that reduces its weight allows it to weight nothing
---
yup. And making Bethesda nerf overall damage is one of the leeways
---
I have all 9 points in gunslinger. I ended up having to put 3 in body mess,  and 2 each in glow sight and exterminator. I have 2 in gun fu. My point being that I should be able to build a character and have it at least be viable without having to focus solely on damage perks.  I want to actually build a character around a concept,  not be a min maxing powergamer who ignores everything but numbers. I can play the way I like for now,  but I'm really worried that one wasteland will put a stop to that.
---
I know at face value it seems like a stupid question, but if you look this question up on google from previous posts, there are a lot of mixed answers.
---
How would you not know that moving a SPECIAL point would cost you a card that you didn't pick?
---
Ok then.
---
with those ideas, I'm surprised you don't already work for Bethesda
---
That's kind of the point. Specializing grants bug rewards for big tradeoffs. Removing most of the benefit doesn't make it worth doing. Dumbs the whole game down. They should be buffing other builds instead
---
Look up the different buffs from foods you can cook. Stack different foods with the same buff, and perks that enhance that. Pita to maintain though.
---
Yeah I don't want to be on 7 days a week. Try making it fun and able to complete when I want to play the game for fun not a chore
---
I agree, man. I actually pre-ordered this dumpster fire. I had a ton of fun until after level 50, when things just started becoming grindy. Currently almost level 200. Now the entire game is grinding. That's not what I bought the damn game for, come on.
---
Connect the generator to a power connector or a pylon using a wire.  The pylon/connector will radiate power for 2-3 blocks.  The generators do not do this.  Place the lamps within the radius of the pylon/connector.
---
Use more pylons/connectors to expand the radius of the radiated power.  
---
    Generator --&gt; connector  --&gt; connector
---
    connector --&gt; Generator  &lt;-- connector
---
If the item (lamp) description just shows a lightening bolt then it is powered without having to physically connect it with a wire to a source of power (generator, pylon, connector).
---
If the item (lamp) description shows a lightening bolt with a number then must be powered with a wire that is connected to a source of power (generator, pylon, connector) with at lease that amount of power capability remaining.
---
    Generator (3 power) --&gt; wired item (1 power) leaves 2 power remaining.
---
    Generator (3 power) --&gt; Generator (3 power) --&gt; wired item (1 power) leaves 5 power remaining.
---
    Generator (3 power) --&gt; wired item (5 power) will not be powered.
---
I'm 16 but will see about getting hired latter on in life
---
The game only saves dropping items, not picking them up. I lost a bunch of scrip after a server crash.
---
This description almost makes me think I know who it is haha...someone I blocked in game a LONG time ago.
---
I go 5demo 3stab 3poweruser 3batt and scrapper.
---
My melee have 0 weight 
---
It have a 90% weight reduction plus a mod that changes the wood of the bat it make it to 0
---
I hear you. I really like the game, but at some point there's just nothing new to do and the weird bugs start to glare in my face because of it. So I just took a step back, looked at the game as entertainment, decided I got some really good value for the money I spent and in 2 weeks time (when I'm allied with both faction and rank 100) I'll leave the game for a while. There are a lot of other games I want to return to.
---
Preach!
---
I always carry a few dog foods and Salisbury steaks in case I run out of my preferred foods and don’t want to travel or cook.
---
I forgot where but there was something I read awhile back that made it sound like a heavy weapon. easy to test though. just take off your rifle and big guns perk, equip the gun, then apply each perk and see which increases the damage
---
No, they aren't.
---
Carnivore is good for other uses, especially with "stranger in numbers". Ex = tasty squirrel stew normally give +10% exp, but carn is +20%, and SiN = +25% bonus. It does that will all the food bonuses.
---
U need herbivore for the cranberry relish 25% bonus...
---
Maybe herb will work better...easier to find and make
---
The fact that casual players have completed it already proves that your claim that it's only hardcore grinders or whales completing is just false. You can even complete without touching NW once. 
---
It's meant to get people to play everyday and is designed with that in mind. Sure it sucks for people who started late or people who can't play that much due to real life but how would you balance it so everyone can complete it without making it be too easy to complete cause the way it is now casual players can easily compete it if starting from the beginning of the season or not too long after.
---
Action boy/girl, any of the weight reducing perks ( pack rat , thuru-hiker, traveling pharmacy ) are great when ur low lvl. Early on you prob gonna have trouble with ammo so maybe find a baseball bat or other melee weapon and use its correlating perk cards in strength ( slugger, gladiator , iron fist or even incisor ) but you don’t need to max any out right now. You kinda go with the flow early on until you start getting better weapons and ammo is easier to come by.
---
At first is was easy for me to keep up with the dailies/weekly challenges. Id hop on when i woke up or late nite and bang them out. 
---
Slowly i lost the desire to complete them and once i got a job again. No urge whatsoever. It was definitely a mixture of needing to be on daily to grind out the event challenges and tagging the boring bullion quests too. 
---
So i repeat what dozens of others have been saying, please....a weekly limit..
---
Agree!  Instead of Outfits, it's Tops/Underarmour/Pants.
---
This is why microtransactions, of any form, are not a good idea and sponsoring them was always only ever going to end up this way.
---
Trying to rinse you of everything you've got. 
---
Purchase levels at exuberant prices because the grind so inflated, artificially.
---
It's by design
---
Its time players said no to microtransactions once and for all.
---
"iTs So UnFaIr." 
---
Really? I work full time and I havent had any problems. It isn't meant for everyone to achieve 100 without putting in the effort.
---
So you know it’s a “pvp zone” but still call people coming to pvp griefers ? 
---
Griefers are people who go to queen and opt out of the event to trigger pvp not people who go to pvp zones/events to pvp
---
All they want to do is create yet another grind to keep people logging in daily past the cash store.  There is no other reason for doing this convoluted card scrapping game.  Simplest way would be to just give perk coins per level, and get to work on loadouts for consoles.  I have already lost a ton of points by just opening perk packs to avoid an extra menu step every time I need to swap cards before doing any little thing, and not ranking up perks that I don't use so I don't have to sort past multiple versions of it in addition to old animated cards that don't stack.  All those duplicates are lost.  It's like they want to penalize people for their poor design decisions, all to keep you logging in and grinding the same old shit daily.
---
Turn off gore in the settings.  Might have to go directly into the file. Google it.
---
The physics gets weird, but nothing ever blows into bits.  That way, your always searching for a body.  I've lost less legendaries this way.  This also means meat piles or robot piles instead of pieces.  Also helps locate them.
---
P.S.  when I say the physics get weird, I mean the entire body goes where 1 of the pieces might have.  This means you will probably see the body in a different spot than most other people, but you'll be able to loot it so hey.
---
You just have to claim and not defend tho? Why not just leave if the daily is all you care about?
---
why did you have to remind me of the X-01 calibrated shocks grind.
---
i had that abhorrent nightmare repressed in the furthest corner of my mind.
---
Yeah! We'd never know that we were supposed to get headware aside from the broken headware in the shop that we can see but can't get access to. It's also good to hear that this isn't a problem that's effecting you!
---
Darn.  Why is it listed under SKINS / POWER ARMOR in the Atomic Shop if it's not a skin.
---
Sometime I dispair of Bethesda.
---
EDIT:  Also, in the Atomic Shop Description for the Cpt Cosmos Jetpack it actually states....
---
\- **SKIN** IS CRAFTABLE AT POWER ARMOR STATIONS. -
---
My lady character would like to manspread.
---
Cool, thanks for the info, I’ll give it a try
---
The real grind for jetpack is not the jetpack mod but the chest piece whit the effects that you need for your build , you can buy the mod right after finishing wastelanders quest line Whitout grinding factions rep , the fact that you can use a jetpack Whitout having to use power armor is already a huge thing making it totally worth "the grind" in my opinion :)
---
Which the something the 20 year olds with part time jobs refuse to understand. They always say we just need to *dedicate* *more time* to it. This isn't an esport. It shouldn't only be fun for people with entire days to commit to it. 
---
That's the reason I stopped playing MTG. If I wasn't willing to set aside a weekly fund for packs and spend my day building the most meta deck it wouldn't be fun.
---
Pretty much any MMORPG is not very working adult friendly when you think about it. If you aren't on every day for at least a couple hours you'll miss out on stuff. ESO and Destiny 2 are two other MMOs I've played and it applies there, especially Destiny which also has a season ranking system.
---
I'm not saying it's good, it's just a fact with these types of games.
---
I think this is where the biggest divide comes in. I don't believe playing one hour a day for over a month is casual at all. Even if its just 30 minutes a day every day for a month just for daily's that's barely scraping by trying to be casual. Keeping in mind its been over a month.
---
&gt;  because there's people now who've completed it long ago 
---
This is what I was referring to. I think you assumed I meant the people finishing around now which is average for those who have played since the first day. 
---
Which was not my claim.
---
Like the other commenters, I am working (from home) 40 hours a week, and I'm doing just fine (mid 80s). I don't play NW, and I haven't purchased any jumps ahead (technically - I haven't used any of *my* atoms, but when they give me 150 as a reward for going up a level, to me that's a free pass to go up one more level, so I do that).
---
I'm not a parent and don't have a family to care for, so I guess that might make a difference. My work is also flexible enough that I can technically put in 40 hours at any part of the week, even though my schedule is 7am-3pm M-F - so if I'm tired of my work tasks, I can task-switch and go kill some Scorched, then go back to work once I'm done my dailies.
---
Put another way - I can see how you might feel that way, but I don't think it's as bad as that. I think you can enjoy the game just fine even if you have a lot of other commitments in life.
---
Nobody uses the PTR to actually TEST things! No, they go there to datamine spoilers to post online and find exploits they can use to cheat the game, get caught, get banned and come to this subreddit whining that they were fairly punished for being a dirty cheater.
---
I name my guns after their legendary effects, as an example TSE Gatling Gun or VFFR Ultracit Gatling Laser.
---
Same problem on playstation. Not much fun with my bow/crossbow main. Thank the gods for stealth.
---
Wait you found them? I got that reward in the Run a few levels ago but I haven't been able to find it in any of the CAMP menus.
---
Yeah, notuch happens. She's just upset at you
---
Should be 2,250 caps, minus the 10% cost of doing business. The game takes ten percent of every sale. So if you sell an item for 10 caps, you get 9.
---
I think I was there, he drowned in the lake once
---
Nothing says "Accurate and Thoughtful" like the "[No True Scotsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman)" argument
---
I run I Stealth Semi Auto Rifle build with Anti Armor and it’s fantastic
---
It generally costs nothing to build at workshops so who cares if they destroy it. I plop down a fusion generator and 5 extractors at my favorite workshop and it costs me 5 springs from my personal stash. I always keep them unlocked and my tag is WastingMy so please feel free to load up.
---
I run Inspirational, so I need to be on a team. And I prefer Building, but if there's only room on an Events team, then I'll join that until a Building team comes along. However, I always do some events too, so I don't think I'm a freeloader or something.
---
There is a text chat mod you can use
---
I named my Meteorite Sword "Sokka's Lament". It hangs on my space wall.
---
Not in game but on console, I think xbox they can, I'm PC there is no native messaging.
---
My Guass minigun is named "Judas Rising."
---
I've been doing melee sneak snipe since day one and bloodied/junkie was never on the table. My buddy has been running bloodied forever and he still gets dropped in a couple hits like everyone else. 
---
At some point the diminishing returns don't mean as much as they seem.
---
Ty will look into it!
---
I have a large amount of fluorescent fixtures in my place because I like it to be bright (and I'm in the Mire). I'd prefer to not use so many lights because of the elephant-sized bite it takes out of my CAMP budget.
---
I like the idea of the firefly jars, but I haven't been able to test them out, because despite getting the reward in the Legendary Run, I can't find the item in my CAMP build menus anywhere.
---
Eary on in the games lifecycle on the xbxox side i was regularly teaming up with one of the guys from my patoon.
---
One day we are chilling out minding our own business building his camp when a lvl 150 guy comes by. We are at 45 and 30 respectively. This was also when really high level was someone that had reached lvl 100. Anyhow he cones by and mininukes everything. Then murders the both of us. This was also before the update where you had to shoot back to initiate pvp. You could still do minimal dammage but the real big damage would come when they shot back. Not in this case. This guy was spect out for max damage with mininukes.
---
And he was doing it.
---
So we respawn and just watch the map to see where he goes. Then we followed him. He went to his camp that was right next door.
---
So i made sure my friend and i were teamed up in game and stripped off my good armor and took my best weapons and all the ammo i could carry then proceeded to run over to his camp.
---
I then just ran around in jumping up on to thing and doing nothing else just occupying the area. He sent threats over the local area chat and i just kept running around. Soon as he left i used the window workbench trick to get into his house and start breaking everything he had. His turrets helped destroy his walls to get to me and also did a number on the workstations i hid behind to get the turrets to destory those too.
---
When he got back he was obviously pissed and killed me. Which began my cycle of respawning and immediately running to his camp to attack it. Over and over until all my weapons were destroyed and all i had was my fists. Just kept doing it until he finally fled the server.
---
Yea I'm aware, I was testing it out against what was posted on the PTS
---
Right, so these others must be on Xbox or using the mod. TY!
---
Unfortunately, you were already muted before you even started.......
---
Love the sentiment though
---
Multiple online payment platforms, a distributed media editing platform, radar, sonar and marine traffic software, a social media site, automation for off-grid systems, probably a few other things that don't come to mind.
---
Thats beatifull idea. You just made me shed some tears.😥
---
Im sorry for your loss and wish you all the best.
---
I named my Furious something Laser rifle “Zeta Blaster” and my plasma rifle “Sofia” because I got it while doing quests for the astronaut lady and I was really happy what had dropped.
---
This post is literally about that perk card
---
Sure thing ✌️😄
---
I use the Manta Man (or something) suit. Is that still visible when using a Chinese stealth suit?
---
I've been able to complete majority of daily and weekly on an hour of play a night.
---
I don't remember what level I'm at, 80-85, I'm pretty sure I'll complete it without atoms even though I've missed a few days.
---
With that said, my FO76 play has only been the Legendary Run. No time to farm scrip, caps, tickets, or bullion. Just whatever I get trying to compete the daily / weekly.
---
Not even time to fix up my camp. Hopefully they do change it up in the future.
---
That's why I had a blast for over a hundred hours and when content dried up I stopped. I took it like another single player Fallout, good enough.
---
+1 perception -1 agility and -4 charisma buffs and debuffs
---
They know this, and want you to buy it out..... because you have a job.
---
Excess meds don't exist with traveling pharmacy.

I'd rather they didn't :-)
---
I'm just here trying to do the math on how chickens can put out twice as much poop per hour as a Brahmin.

Paragraphs
---
I have had my audio bug out at times and do that. Usually restarting the game solves the issue. I think discord was causing issues for me at one point as well.
---
Yes - I name them after Medieval legendary swords.
---
And William Wallace Power Armor

---
I disagree with what you consider casual but leaving that aside. It comes down to how little amount of time/effort should be put in to complete it so that everyone can get it done fully. Making it so someone who puts it 30 min a day or even less able to get it done seems to be catering a bit too much. Unfortunately that's just the reality of real life and more specifically being an adult.
---
Where do you get the plans for the mining helmet lights?
---
Meanwhile there’s the douchebags who join public teams just to share perks that ruin people’s builds for no reason. Real cool guys.
---
That’s why I like the thirsty emote were u chug a beer.
---
We need some afk emotes
---
Need to up my naming game.. Zzz-prime AA Exp 50cal
---
I understand not wanting to take away from those who didn't know the gun was duped/hacked when they buy it off a vender or a trade.   
---
Why not reset the weapon to base and allow a one time legendary reset on the weapon to anything they want? That allows people who may be victims to hacks in this game to not be completely duped of their time and hard earned caps.   
---
I dunno, I'm just spitballing. Something needs to be done. Watching people melt the SBQ in 4 shots turns this game into a real joke.
---
A grind should be having the ability to spend countless hours to achieve a goal. Not spend a couple hours each day for months.
---
I.E. maybe instead of the Treasury Notes and a 200 gold a day limit, make public events award 1-4 gold bullion and just let me people spend as long or little as they want farming gold.
---
Maybe instead of having a max scrip limit, get rid of it and cut the scrip per item in half or something and let people spend as little or as much time farming legendaries as they would like.
---
The only thing you can really spend as much time as you want grinding anymore is XP which now also has purpose for the repeatable season rank score...so that's cool I guess.
---
Not always the case. More often than not you must build in the workshop for the challenge. If I’m building stuff in a workshop, I may as well build the minimum for resource gathering too. 
---
Also doesn’t change the fact that if the game gives me the ability to avoid PvP, I’m going to use it. Blocking dickheads that try to gang up on players that don’t play PvP is definitely not cheating. Duping legacy’s is cheating. We could argue all day, doesn’t change my mind.
---
You don't need any plans, just got to find the right helmet, take it to an armor bench and mod it.
---
I’m away that weekend on holiday- grrh
---
Yeah I've been having to get on before daycare / work to knock out what I can.
---
Friend of mine called her main weapon BBC.
---
For Big Bad Caliber... I guess.
---
Yep, plus all the damn limits have kept me playing the game. I don’t want to spend additional money for only the scrap box. I used private server for a day or two before never going back on.
---
The popularity of Bloodied is good for my vending machines. Any item that has that prefix, I immediately put it in a machine and can basically name any price. Even BS items like Bloodied Bone Hammers will almost immediately go.
---
I didn’t know those useless cards would one day be used to trade in for perk coins which used as currency in the legendary perk system. If I had known that cost perhaps I would have made a different choice. Unfortunately that cost only came to be known about 20 months after the respec system was introduced.
---
I knocked out todays dailies in a few minutes. I feel like most of them can be done super quick if you focus on it. The only ones that really seem to need a massive amount of grind is leveling up if you don’t use a 2nd account
---
Eh, no pants allowed, it's a secret rule Bethesda has
---
I can picture my junkies heavy gunner chomping on a cigar.
---
You mean like a job. This is why I deleted Fallout shelter
---
Switched my build from Bow .. just not fun!
---
Bethesda i want to be completely naked.
---
They biased drops toward ** instead of three star. I rarely get a three but a butt ton of **. For armor, that's an instant recycle.
---
Why finish early?
---
Yes. For example my junkies ultracite galting laser called "Ultracite Drug" :3
---
That means a lot to me. I've been meaning to draw something or cover his favourite song on the guitar but I couldn't get around to it without feeling like it wasn't enough. Thank you very much
---
Did they change intelligence? Im pretty sure it doesn't affect xp gain in 76, except when crafting.
---
Why not use the gauss shotgun?
---
It feels kinda irelevant , wish there was real time progress in game. Same score score system pops up.
---
Or dunno, actual containers with materials appearing if you are reaching bigger numbers. In that atlas boa camp.
---
Some kind of visual aspect
---
&gt; have it at least be viable without having to focus solely on damage perks
---
So without focused solely on multipliers. So that build will not be affected as harshly as bloodied with a load of buffs.
---
Going to the forest to kill weakass scorched won't go away, the scorched will still be pushovers since they will have a hp/lvl cap.
---
I always think of [these](https://www.google.com/search?q=cantilevered+homes&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS530US530&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02V_0KctfVE6l3svuPMMCC1dmKIiw:1597610271814&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj8j_aFyqDrAhWxCTQIHbytCAgQ_AUoAXoECA8QAw&amp;biw=1476&amp;bih=1008) when I see homes in FO

Named my .50 Cal MG Ethel and my LMG is Red Rum.
---
I get the sentiment, but I figure I might as well throw the idea out there anyhow. Nothing ventured, nothing gained right?
---
My junkies explosive handmade is “boom boom crackhead”. My vampire ffr handmade is “Dracula”.
---
Yeah dailies usually take me about 2 hours. Depending on luck for some.
---
I join Event public teams most often because I don't see benefit of the other teams' bonuses at all. However most days it almost seems like somebody turned the "events occurrence" knob down to 1 notch above "never". If an event is on, I am almost always in on it. There are a few I don't bother with, like Tea Time, The Messenger, Monster Mash etc., but the "big name" ones (with the ! icons) I'm almost always in.
---
Facts
---
all mine have human names, my tse handmade is frank, and my tse pump is george
---
It does. Increasing Int increases XP gain from all sources. It’s why the Building public teams are so popular.
---
Yeah life is basically pay to win lol
---
No, it isn’t “incorrect.” Today’s was especially easy. I was done in under ten minutes. The only ones that really rely on luck are the bobblehead ones, but even that is easy once you know where to look.
---
Been there done that brother, it really sucks, especially since 3 star drops are in low supply even when killing 3 star legendaries.
---
Yeah I had a bow build and it was infuriating, I thought maybe the bows were a bit messed up with VATS but nope, it's everything.
---
Really the only people who are complaining are the tryhard, min/maxers who are going from "obliterate whole towns in 5 seconds" to "obliterate hole towns in 10 seconds? Omg they ruined everything!"
---
INT definitely affects xp gain. I regularly run berry mentats, a full building team and an uny set which makes it quite easy to level up
---
❤️
---
Cool. I like a challenge,  but i also like to relax. The charred feral are still a bitch. One got me in VTU yesterday.  Couldn't reload, gut stuck in a corner and it kept staggering me repeatedly until dead. I can do most stuff  if I load up on healing items and chems, but I still haven't managed to make it through a silo run. Waiting until I roll a troubleshooter  pistol I like, then I'll give it another shot. Along with a good supply of ammo for my two shot AGL.
---
You should see how they made power armor work. This is pure magic from the software developers.
---
And the flamer variant *isn’t* a full auto? So many inconsistencies.
---
That’s on you. There’s still plenty of time to gain levels.
---
I loved the legendary run rewards, but it would be nice if you didn't have to do it literally every day to complete it. I ended up buying out a few levels myself for the same reason.
---
Honestly I play almost every night, but of rather play my way, not be bound by doing menial tasks for challenges.
---
Not in Adventure mode. But main title screen? Social make team then join Nuclear winter?
---
&gt; He also tried to get me to follow his YouTube
---
You would have been his first ever follower!
---
More likely it's just buggy. :(
---
A flechette version of the railway rifle would be *fantastic.*
---
When the schorched start spawning at the base of the generator it's so much fun. Most of the wave events would be way more fun this way
---
Pretty much everything you said can be summarized how i said it, PvP is a mess.  Even the thing you said about someone activating PvP while youre in different parts of the map, WAS A REAL THING.  People used to join groups PvP in workshops and by doing so, trigger their teammates into a PvP state whether they were nearby or not.  It's awful even now and regardless of how they do it, it most definitely needs a rework.
---
I don’t even work but my friends and I play COD competitively so I have to get on when they’re not on and do the dailies without them knowing I’m on.
---
Does the exlosive perk card really fo anything with the TSE? I couldnt imagine it having enough effect on it in comparison to othercards, like extending armor/core life in PA or increasing total dr
---
You can get a clean labcoat from the atomic shop
---
Ala The Comedian.
---
I get that. What I’m after is for different lights to have different utilities, as in life. Keep the larger/ceiling lights on the bright side, by all means. It makes sense. But when you’ve got bedside and table lamps that burn with the fury of a star then I think some adjustments may be required!
---
Ok folks. u/amriddle01 has spoken. No smoking.
---
It used 5mm ammo just YouTube search Orbital Strike Minigun Fallout 76 and u see in action
---
Sir, this is a kid's game.  
---
;)
---
That was my first atom shop purchase and Ive worn the goggle ever since. I swapped the coat for the Arktos coat to match my backpack.
---
There are a few work arounds out now to regain camp budget
---
I was thinking more like Schwarzenegger in Predator.
---
Yes it does and when i forget to put it back i always think why is my damage so low.

Ma'am, this is a kids game.

Clean swimsuit, I would pay money for it.  Also the pink power armor paint from NW

I love doing riding shotgun. Usually at least 3 appear.
---
and eyes that burn like cigarettes?
---
Are we really that entitled of a society that we complain about a reward track that requires you to play the game to complete it?   Really? 
---
Further more, we are only talking about cosmetics here, with the exception of the ammo gadget that is received very early, so not completing the reward track is really not a big deal.  
---
**They are just cosmetic rewards!**
---
Unfortunately many games are like this. It’s kinda funny how not playing enough and playing too much can both be bad. If you don’t play enough then leveling takes forever as well as the legendary run. If you play too much your stash fills up to the point you’ve reached the limit for getting caps and scrips. But point is nowadays games propose a much longer grind to extend playtime, if the grind takes nearly forever though then the game can become stale before becoming rewarding
---
There's a brotherhood lab coat
---
sure. my gt is dr pelliper add me i’ll jump on.
---
I have a similar setup currently and run a non explosive gatling gun most of the time (vffrfr). I have a VE 50 cal and may have to test that card out myself to see.

Explosive flamer = arnold napalmer

Oh you mean the desk with [nothing on it?](http://imgur.com/a/TkS0kRh). Ah, the Fallout 76 experience. Stumbling upon a solution just for it to not work.

adding you

I was running a junkies melee build and had all the high end weapons, my 2 main that I used the most though, a junkies SS pole hook and a junkies SS +s spear.

I wanna take you seriously, but then I see your user name...

And the scout outfits.  Aside from the unfortunate button placement.

The spots I always go to are: Arktos biomes, the Burrows, NAR repair yard in the bog, watoga civic center rooftops, west tek, white springs, palace of the winding path.

My BE harpoon gun is called "Whale Ho"
---
I logged off today because my level 300 was close to leveling up and the daily hadn't reset. That seems to be the story of this game now.
---
I think the TS effects it in some way too.
---
not really, compare it to the atom shop vault tec lab coat
---
90% weight reduction on the weapon, plus weapon weight reduction armor, plus bear arms (for heavies, anyway), yea, you can get weights approaching zero.
---
I have several melees under 0.25#, and a heavy or two that are under 1.25.
---
Correct. Form the team before going into any game mode
---
Oh boy. I haven't gotten there yet and now I kinda don't even won't to.. I still will, but with a bad aftertaste. why do they have to screw up every time.. Like hell I'm gonna spend more flux for just a reskin.. It's not like I don't have it, but I'd rather put it in better use. I mean that's hell of an expensive skin there..
---
it's easier in a skirt tbh

Says more about you than the person using an ammo machine, jesus christ how pathetic.

The problem is that people call someone who plays for an hour every day of the week "casual". That isn't a casual player, that's a hardcore player that only plays an hour. Working adults with kids struggle to get 5 minutes to do whatever they want.
---
I added you as a friend in xbox
---
That should just show 2 dmg spots instead of one. Should still be able to see a change in the primary and explosive damage
---
Right? My husband looks better in the red dress than I do.
---
nvm i gotcha.
---
Represent!
---
Oh ok. Didn’t know that. Yeah, the ones I’m referring to look perfectly normal but melt mirelurk queens like they are Morgantown ghouls.
---
yup
---
Same. These dailies really aren’t thy bad. My only issue with them is a lack of variety.
---
They need to strip off "Level up" and replace with with two 250 value challenges, that would sure help things go faster.
---
"Level up 3 times" is a weekly objective that I find fair, but expecting people to level up every single fucking day is just ridiculous!
---
Thankfully I'm almost done at 88 so I just ignored level up today and yesterday, along with 'revive'
---
Where have you been?
---
Yes, the enemies stop spawning in the end, and you have a lot of time to loot every corpse
---
This whole game is a disrespect to the fallout franchise.

I MADE A POST ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT I JUST WANT BREAKFAST
---
Smokin idea. We can add realistic debuffs like greater AP loss while moving and getting random lung diseases for the Atom challenges too.
---
A halberd maybe?
---
So if you play COD competitively you cannot play any other video game?
---
Legendary spawning is pretty much just RNG luck. Anywhere with a high enemies density will yield legendaries, just fond a few locations and hit them, server hop and start again.
---
The casual female outfit has pants. 🤔 And it's what your female in FO4 is in it.
---
Grenades, eventually
---
I did until wastelanders... now I play a lot tbh.
---
I remember that happening to me, could spawn in 3 locations and you had to get lucky to land one hit! An event that can easily take 15/20 mins to complete and you don’t get the prize at the end can be really deflating!
---
Thank you to all who replied. I appreciate this community. So helpful.
---
My first build was a PA melee/heavy gunner. My second build is a sneaky sniper. I have lots of fun with both
---
One time named my Junkies War drum “Last Beat you’ll feel” relating to heart beat and music lol
---
41 year old gamer here.  I work full time, have a family and pets to take care of.
---
I’m doing just fine with about an hour of gaming a night, and more on weekends.
---
I mean, that’s the nature of online games, if you have other priorities you will run into cases where you fall behind.  Thankfully the pace for this game is slower than trying to jump into something like Everquest or World of Warcraft and try to catch up
---
Right! What's up with that? i've failed Line in the Sand with 20+ people before, dont ask me how. Yet i just did it this morning 3man.(I'm level 82, a 132 and 200 something guy, no problem.) I stayed at the genny/missile battery while those guys cleaned house
---
Are the spawns broken? It seemed much tamer
---
If you weren’t single before capping out the legendary run you sure as shit are now
---
What if you hate the BoS?
---
How do you "buy" your way out?
---
Ok but your post references multiplicative in the math.  Also if you took the example of having maxed commando cards and no bloody mess that would be 50 * 1.6 = 80. Is high is exactly what you said you got when you took off bloody mess.
---
This is the impossible balance with this sort of game - they're trying to make content that rewards casual players and the people who have been putting in hundreds of hours since launch. It is a shame that this means some content requires more hours than some people have to give but there isn't really an ideal solution that fits everybody.
---
&gt;I am starting to feel they are becoming closer and closer to EA
---
Wait seriously? The shitty season pass with awful rewards is what did it for you?
---
Not them abandoning everything that makes bethesda good, 0 content, making the grind for legendaries worse and worse every patch, complete lack of weapon balance, and leaving major factions out until literal years after release?
---
My Instigating SS S Boxing Glove is Kickpuncher...because it punches with the power of kicks.
---
honestly more of a label
---
Hell, if you know exactly what you’re doing, you can get rank 4 and keep them all alive solo. Enforcer, plus shotgun. Cripple the legs, leave them alive. No more spawn in. Collect ore freely until bigger things spawn in. Cripple, collect rinse and repeat. Finish them off at the end of the event.
---
Ty. Yeah that’s patched too.
---
Why then is it that I’m nearly finished with it, having not paid atoms at all, and am neither a kid nor a college student and am working full time? 
---
Or was that just a stupid hot take?
---
I was there on day one (and beta), back when the stash box was only 400 pounds. Back when we thought Bethesda was going to hold true to their lie about only adding and charging for cosmetic items. Just because the game was broken from the start with the weight capacity doesn't mean I can't find it outrageous that they put the solution that allows the game to be played properly behind a pay wall. It wouldn't even be as bad if they didn't increase the weight of items/add weight to items that were previously weightless in FO4 and past games.
---
The fact is Bethesda specifically promised only to charge for cosmetics, designed the game to be incredibly limiting unless you have a scrap box, and then placed it behind a paywall subscription. There's no debating that--it is fact. I was frustrated with Bethesda for lying to us about cosmetics only and then introducing other items on the atomic shop, but those were subtle convince items. That is not the case with the scrap box and utterly crippling (as far as gamely ability) limitations of the stash box. I think the rest of the services being bundled together in FO1st are reasonable and make sense, but not an item that remedies a serious limitation in gameplay that should've been addressed from the start.
---
Hell, it wouldn't even be as bad if Bethesda made it to where you can keep a functioning stash box after a one month subscription, that way you get to see all of the other benefits and be more likely to keep the subscription. But the fact that you have to subscribe to be able to play the game properly is disgraceful and greedy.
---
What system?
---
The helmet is missing and has been acknowledged by Bethesda as a mistake. Here's hoping it's fixed on Tuesday.
---
[Violet Flux](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/5/5e/Mappalachia_fluxes_violet.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190626174016) from [Mappalachia](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mappalachia).
---
Thank god, and thank you for the info, will amend my post accordingly.
---
Same here. To me it's another fallout game where I can roam and kill things. I rather enjoy fallout 76, especially from the beta.
---
Thanks I’ll try these out
---
I used to find myself running out of stimpacks during SQB fights. Now everytime I'm overcumbered it's because I have 80 super stims, 40 regular and endless diluted.
---
except it's a game we payed for to have fun in, not a job... it's insulting to players imo.
---
this post should have said once again my bad just pissed off at the time
---
Don't be that guy, obviously it wouldn't even be close to being that dramatic of a normalization
---
Same, although I think I’m addicted to scrip 🤷‍♂️
---
Takes too long tho because you have to wait ages for the ore to respawn for a player. Much quicker to have 3-4 people that can take turns (or do it at the same time if more ppl is defending)
---
Some raiders and scavenger can do It but You can see a Raider doing this in a Little Raider Camp at the monorail pylon of monorail lift.
---
People forget to repair the sonic generator too often.
---
Increase Perception for 5 minutes, increase Charisma amongst fellow smokers for 5 minutes (decreased around non-smokers). Increased chance of lung diseases when under the effect. Decreased AP Regen when under the effect.
---
Chance of addiction with debuffs to both Special stats when not smoking plus the AP Regen debuff.
---
If they change it, I think it’s going to be further down the line.  As far as I know, you’ll still want to eat, you just won’t have negative buffs, but personally I hope they don‘t get rid of it.  Getting Food/Drink is easy, I honestly wish they doubled down on it, and just gave us a way to not need to eat drink in areas like our CAMP (just assume we are maintaining our food while we are there)
---
For violet nuke the toxic Valley. The area near Hemlock Holes.. Tons of violet. Or just east of Harper's Fairy is another good spot
---
PS4
---
Sorry for your loss. This looks cool.
---
I believe those weren't designed to show off a man's cleavage though. They had a t-shirt or tank top looking top to them.
---
Edit: Do NOT look up male swim dresses unless you are prepared for a lot of NSFW images. Look up historical male swimwear.
---
Every one of my legendary weapons is called DEATHS CALLING because why not
---
I suggest actually trying to get a real build, i don't see any real way you can be doing a lot of damage or tanking a lot of damage without bloodied or junkies, and without power armor or vanguard armor. But to each their own, if you dont already know, these perks are a must 
---
* blocker 
---
* fireproof 
---
* ironclad 
---
* bloody mess 
---
* adrenaline 
---
* (if you use rifles) tank killer 
---
* lifegiver 
---
* that should be about it for an all rounder build but again I seriously recommend you to try a real build out
---
I just shorten the words to acronyms and add major effect as title so they stack.
---
I did it once. It’s difficult and hit and miss.
---
Just south of the amusement park in toxic valley. Not really a ghoul farm, it's a scorched farm if you also hit the amusement park, as well as some other random mobs in the wastes. Try and get the nuke zone to also hit the lake by the cabins, as well as the farm. 
---
Again, not super great for farming mats from mobs, there are a few mobs, but violet flux is abundant in that area.
---
I like playing bodyguard but I'm on xbox.
---
It's a shame because the setting and world are some of the best in the series.
---
Then you get to the actual gameplay part and suddenly your face slams at breakneck speed into a curb.
---
And the science scribe outfit.
---
There kinda is tho don’t put a time limit on “season” let people do challenges later for rewards too rather than excluding those who work alot
---
Ok that makes sense, I figured it was 50 * 1.20 3 times in total.
---
Never had issues until now, minus gauss weapons.  I guess the nerf is coming early lol
---
This is beautiful, I think your friend would've loved both the game and this memorial. Sorry for your loss.
---
They never progressed past some of the sexist stereotypes prevalent in the 50s. It wouldn’t hurt to add that at all, but Bethesda isn’t sexist or anything for not adding it originally
---
For the "level up" one-  make a new character.  Run straight to the overseer's camp. Grab the mats from the red toolbox and craft a board and leather chest armor.  Run inside the wayward and kill the raider. Talk to the lady, just keep mashing X until she's done talking. Bingo you're done. Delete the character and repeat as needed. Takes about 5 min tops.
---
Unreliable accuracy and unreliable damage output. It suffers the same issue the gauss rifle suffers from in vats. Vats an enemy, 95% accuracy, shot goes wildly off target for no reason. Alternatively, sometimes I’ll have a definite dead on hit and the enemies health bar barely moves. I know I can get up 4,000 damage with it, maybe more, but there are times where I’m scratching my head thinking “wtf... I know I nailed that”. A lot of people will say “back out of vats and re-vats the target” or “you simply need to move closer or shoot again to correct vats”; which is tedious. Nothing like firing off 2 or 3 shots with 95% accuracy and missing each of them. 
---
Most of the time it’s awesome, and it is possible to snipe with it to a hilarious extent. One shotting a mirelurk queen or scorchbeast or sheepsquatch is entirely possible with it and feels so good. On a side note to that I find myself relying more on the splash damage so I can at least cripple an enemy. In Radiation Rumble I don’t really need to aim; instead I just shoot in the general direction of the ghouls and kill/maim with splash. I tend to save it for SBQ fights, or Free Range-provided no one else is attending the event. Plus in close range it’s just too hard to use without turning yourself in red mist. 
---
Personally I just find that I have a better time with the other shotguns. More fun, more accurate, more reliable. While they are considerably weaker than the gauss, the damage output by them is more than enough to one shot (sometimes 2) most of the enemies in the game. I run a full bloody shotgun build, so all the guns are pretty OP, and even though the fancy isn’t bloodied it is still doing about 900 dps for me.
---
Regardless, the gauss shotgun was the entire reason I did a shotgun build in the first place and it is definitely not crap. I love mine and wouldn’t trade it for the world even if you could trade them. But it does have a few drawbacks that the other shotguns make up for.
---
I've got a Junkies heavy and a Berserker commando. 
---
This is for my screw around, strictly for fun build. 
---
Thanks.
---
Everyone is gonna say this but, take your time. Enjoy the game, indulge in the story. Have fun. It isnt a race
---
It's at the very bottom over the crafting page if you read it. I didn't know I knew the recipe either til I scrolled all the way to the bottom.
---
They don't disappear. Do they? I've always received another copy of the same card and have them as duplicates. The only ones that disappear are the Nuclear Winter ones but they give you points that you can spend on perk cards that you don't have already.
---
Thanks for the kind words
---
Apologies for that being long winded btw.
---
I'm doing alright (level 89 as of writing this but i have no kids to worry about) but yup, i definitely feel they're gearing it towards non-casuals and then you get events like today-revive 2 teammates in NW. Unless I'm playing with a team, coordinating something like that can potentially take ages.
---
But having said this, it must be an incredibly fine line to walk. They have to cater for the hard-core 24/7 crowd along with the casuals and newbies and yes, derive a profit from it too (and not just cause "greedy beths" but they have operating costs they have to cover right \*(but also some greedy bethesda execs too))
---
side question, i see a lot of comments about maximizing int, is that to get as much exp as you can for the repeatable 100 score? I haven't really paid attention to that because it sounds super daunting. 10000 exp for 100 score. 3000 score for a level means you have to level up 30 times which isssss 300,000 per score level? that seems excessive
---
Yeah. The only reason I so easily slid through Legendary Run was because I'm still on furlough.
---
I probably have to get a new job soon, so I'm really hoping Armored Ace is less grueling. I really want The Subjugator outfit, but its rank 98
---
Tysm! I rushed new vegas bc my ex made fun of me for not finishing it, I don't want to make that mistake again lol
---
Add another one from immortalshep and the dream team
---
Otherwise some perks i would just have like 7 rank 1s just sitting there
---
Use the camera to locate hard to find bodies
---
They should give us the option.  But I would pay for a washing machine to have clean clothes.  💜
---
Thank you so much! I wish I had something better to write his name with but until then I think the standard letters are okay without being too obnoxious
---
Uh huh.
---
Wow I'm sorry, do you have any other games to play? I'd do that before I started f76. It's just trash.
---
Yes maybe they can add this like an emote with some effect on SPECIAL
---
If you want to main a .50 cal, I'd consider PA+Stabilized, as it's one of the less accurate heavy guns. My bloodied heavy is more a gatling type of guy (gatling gun for trash and gatling plasma/laser for big fights like SBQ and Encryptid) and occasionally uses a minigun or LMG, and he does just fine outside PA and without the Stabilized perk.
---
I am a full health, non junkie, stealth rifleman/gunslinger.
---
 I stay far away from the metas. I carve my own path.
---
That being said I can still one shot everything in the game except for the bosses.
---
Daily crap like this is probably designed to make the player count numbers and retention look better than they actually are.  I have to wonder if that's the whole purpose of daily limits and whatnot, so that you try to encourage your player base to stick around with arbitrary limits rather than with compelling content.
---
Thank you, will do :)
---
🤷🏻‍♀️ I appreciate looking at make cleavage.  Skin the suit blue\black\red and make the straps bigger.  That being said I see lots of dudes rocking it like a boss.
---
I've played new vegas!
---
I use a vampires minigun for my non PA build.
---
15 points in STR, rank 1 bear arms, rank 2 lock and load, then rank 3 blocker and the rest of the heavy gun damage perks. 
---
In terms of survivability, if you use vampires legendary guns, you'll be totally fine, so any other perk is just icing on the cake.
---
Is this only the case for lower power calibers? I converted my steel &gt; spikes &gt; Ammo Points &gt; .50 cal ammo and I ended up with about 300 rounds, while the amount of steel (plus lead and gunpowder) would have netted me close to 1300 rounds had I just crafted it outright.
---
The self entitlement is strong with this one...
---
They'll argument that saying we have perks that reduce your hunger/thirst by 50% while you're in camp -.- But may I ask what are those changes to food and drinks you're all talking about?
---
exactly this. it is entirely possible and doable if you focus on those dailies and do them, like a job in your free time on a game you played for having fun. this is not added end game content andits not fun or engaging content either - despite the end rewards and some along the way being very desirable! (I'd like a bigger camp budget to use them though)
---
kinda silly that if you miss days and don't do it all you have to pay to complete. there are people that lose internet or power, maybe have health issues or have other responsibilities and miss out now and it's gross.
---
What is way more interesting is that while the additive math works without bloodied mess, it doesn’t add up correctly when you use bloodied mess. In fact it looks like while the commando perks are additive, bloodied mess is multiplicative. 50 * 1.6(commando perks added together) * 1.15(bloodied mess) = 92.
---
Should not do events with that much junk on you.  Ask me how I know!
---
Make sure to unequip and re-equip every time you change weapon, works on all my handmade rifles.
---
Rofl to each their own. ANY variety would be nice, though.
---
Come to colorado we got a lot of both
---
The caps, gold bullion, scrap kits, repair kits, lunchboxes, perk card packs,  scrip, are cosmetic rewards huh that’s news to me
---
Not all glitches bring harm to others. Many can be lots of fun.
---
I work 10 hour days 5 days a week minimum.  I only het to play 7pm until 10pm at the latest. I play 5 or 6 hours on Saturday and Sunday.  I spent 1800 caos znd finished almost 2 weeks ago . Its not that hard
---
Super mutants drops gunpowder or find an acid deposit and build your camp there 👍🏻
---
Supposedly they want to take out the hungry/thirsty/starving/dehydrated Debuffs, basically taking out the need to eat or drink unless you want the buffs (And thus remove the whole survival element of it).
---
I mean those names keep them either at the very top or very bottom so it’s easy to find
---
You can buy slots on the game board with atoms.
---
But they all work?
---
Workshops is 100% why I finally broke down and got a year of Fallout 1st. My only regret is I didn’t get to enjoy a totally desolate pre-NPC world. lol
---
Everything looks perfect. And also you're absolutely right about this memorial to be sorta.. eternal and independent of time and weather.
---
I feel its like someone started making some beautiful work of art, got bored and lit it on fire not realizing it was far more flammable than they had thought and its now an entertaining bonfire
---
I didn’t say anything about cheating ? Those challenges can be done at your camp too so your point is mute . Idc how you choose to play the game but people who go to pvp zones to pvp aren’t griefers
---
I named my legendary combat knife Tom Shanks”.
---
"it shouldn't be only fun for people with entire days to commit to it."
---
yep. we all bought the game already.
---
Utilizing glitches is against the terms and conditions. Rationalize it how you want, me pointing out the facts won't matter
---
The Fatman is the only weapon in the game that has a right to be dealing damage in the high-hundreds without much specialization.  Especially with how heavy it is and the ammo itself.
---
Uh...okay so you do realize that most adults have an 8 to 9 hour work day, and guess how long most kids are in school for? That's not includeing chores, after school stuff, getting ready for the next day, and most kids and young teens have a bed time, so in a lot of ways you have more time than the average kid whose not coming home and playing games till bed)
---
(Not only that, but most kids do not have an Income, so if their parents aren't gonna buy it for them they are just shit outta luck for getting max rank.)
---
You can pants if you want to, you can leave your skirts behind.
---
Cause your coats don't pants and if they don't pants, then they're no coats of mine.

---
76 is dog shit in comparison to the only good fallout game published by Bethesda.
---
That was my logic. The VFFR .50 is doing it's job keeping me alive. Going for the creature specific armor for the straight damage reduction buff whilst building complete sets of each. 
---
So far I'm more than holding my own at queen fights. 
---
To quote Shakespeare, "Though she be but little, she is fierce."
---
Earlina's gonna be a bad bitch. 
---
Edit: corrected quote.
---
Alright thanks! .50 cal is my favorite heavy and one of my favorite heavies in the game
---
Spawn numbers scale on active participants somewhat, ive noticed more appear with more people and i would guess that the scorchbeasts spaens drop in there as well they tend to come in bunches of 5 additional
---
I'm a bit surprised they didn't issue an emergency hot fix as the super fast reload benefited players and is fun and we all know Bethesda is basically your grumpy neighbour who hates the very idea of fun...
---
Get off your grass!! 😡
---
Someone was telling me of a way to make it to always spawn in line in the sand and I gotta test that out
---
The level up curve has been changed several patches ago.
---
It's linear growth all the way to the top.
---
The simplified formula is:
---
XP for next level = 160 \* (current level) + 40
---
I don't know if there is a point where it flattens out again but at my level (529) it's still linear. For those wondering, it's around 85k XP, which means I see the repeatable 10k SCORE challenge pop 8 times before I'm close to level up.
---
If you are at or over level 126, just count the times the 10K challenge pops because from 126 on you need 20k+.
---
So I've heard, i just want to try it at least!
---
Relatable. Son who’s almost 2, working 40 hours a week. 3 hours of gaming a couple nights a week at tops. Battle passes aren’t made for the ‘forced to be’ casual player. And don’t get me started on micros.
---
favourite comment
---
oh no.. it's annoying to carry around food and water but I have to admit I'm addicted to it and you're right about survival element, I enjoy it so much. I love cooking irl, so I like cooking in game too xD What will happen to speed demon mutation then? you literally have to eat and drink more to stay alive..
---
It does. Check my post above.
---
It has a bright orange "shoot me" sign on the head as default. Don't think paint would effect the stealth as much as a glowing orange orb head.
---
When violet is needed, like the other guys said, hit toxic valley. I’d hit Whitesprings first (with a nuke) to get glowing mass and hardened mass and high radiation fluids. Then hit toxic valley with a second nuke to get the violet. There’s not a lot of enemies there to get the mats from. But if you put on green thumb... whooo. Last time I hit toxic valley I literally walk of shamed out of there from being over encumbered with violet flux. You’ll have more flux than materials to make it stable.
---
Acid: Snallygasters, Crickets, Yao Gaui, and Anglers are my main go too, especially crickets. 
---
Super mutants are often good sources of gunpowder.
---
Floating bases make me groan. Like okay, just put a tent on the ground or at least make it look supported by stilts. It's not that much more effort, but w/e
---
What you're describing is called "power creep".
---
It's Nerf or Nothing!
---
Can be tough sometimes but I usually get a hr or two in at night after work when my son is asleep. I’ve missed a few days here and there completely but I’m rank 73 and think I’ll make it to the end before it’s over. 
---
I feel good about how they setup the legendary run. I look forward to playing when I can and am pretty glad I still have a little more ways to go after hearing everyone else who has finished it complain about having nothing to do lol
---
Not really, excuse me if it came off like that, my writing skills and word selection is beyond poor, and I now feel like deleting the post to not come off to anyone as entitled, spoiled, or annoying, but I no way am entitled, I never said I deserved anything, I just merely asked for at the very least a small tip.
---
exactly. the game has support beams. they're under the stairs. use them.
---
Amen!!!..
---
I’m talking about the bugs that can actually cause issues. Under the map and double walls are fine.
---
Really helpful, thank you
---
Yeah, the perks and mutations are going to need to be tweaked for it to happen, since they take out what risk there is with them.
---
Personally I’m fine with the food.  I have green thumb, Can do, and hunters bounty available anytime I start to get hungry, there are cooking stoves everywhere, and usually tons of plants and water.  You don’t even have to carry food unless your going to be spamming chems that eat up your bars.
---
any good supermutants places?
---
edit: i am scared of snallygasters, ran to them at lvl 6 once and i have ptsd :(
---
I read that, yeah. I wasn't too certain even after reading. That's incredibly stupid. Thanks.
---
One nuke doesn't do much if you want stable flux.
---
One nuke centered on Hemlock Holes for the flux, and one nuke on WS.
---
The one throwing the nuke should be the anchor on f1st, the other one runs through WS and collects the stabilizing agents and reconnects after each pass through, until the nuke zone dissipates. 
---
Hemlock Holes can net you around 500 flux per run and WS about 25-30 stabilizing agents. So run WS first .)
---
Same here. Level up and buy/sell 3 items are fricken dumb to have every single day.  I have to go to somebody's camp and buy 3 fricken rounds of some ammo I don't even need.  I'm sure they are super thankful for the 3 caps though!!  If I'm not close to a level up I will switch to a fresh alt and get my level in 5 to 10 minutes.  
---
Its getting so predictable I had them all done in 15 minutes yesterday minus the NW one...just logged out around 1000 xp away from a level up
---
I  switched from a Bloodied Heavy PA build to an Unyielding/Weapon Weight Reduction set of armor for the extra carry weight alone. As for Stabilized, I replaced it with a healthy addiction to Formula P!
---
It's going to kills us casual players (job, family, and play late night) when they nerf damage and force us to farm resources for ammo. (PTS damage recalculation) Bethesda should be increasing damage on weak weapons for those of us who struggle to play with crappy weapons and armor. Not cutting damage across the board because of the OP legacies that they have left in the game. Why penalize players because who can't play 30 hours on weekends and 4 to 8 hrs daily.  I still haven't got gold because I am struggling with the LR to keep up.  I know you can cheat but I don't want to. I want to play the game. Bethesda should quit trying to make casual players move on to other games.
---
You can either grind each level or spend 150 Atoms (flat rate per level) to advance forward. I've squirreled away enough Atoms to be able to buy the remaining levels once I hit 74
---
What’s up with the downvote?? And I don’t think so, as the other person said I think it’s classified as “pre war food”
---
Oh. So I misread it. Mine is bad. Thank you
---
I bite... why?
---
No. Atoms and furnishings/skins are account wide. All the rest goes to the character you're unlocking it with.
---
Do you know if it stacks with other chems or if it cancels them out?
---
It’s a damned if you do damned if you don’t scenario for Bethesda.
---
The no lifers (me) complain they don’t have anything to do in the game, so Bethesda gives them a giant grind. Now the casual players are pissed because they don’t have time for that grind. 
---
It’s a bummer, but there will always be two kinds of players, and you’re not going to please either all the time. The casuals just need something for them that happens at the same time as the giant grind event. 
---
One suggestion I saw that I liked is not having the time limit, but you can’t move on to season 2 until you finish season 1. I think that’s a great solution. 
---
I also think Fallout First members should get a small 10% score buff perk so they feel like they’re getting something for the money they spend as well, but it’s not a big enough bonus to piss off the non-sub players, but enough that the 1st members feel like they’re getting something for their money (although it could be argued they already are with the atom allowance every month they could buy levels with).
---
West Tek is my go to, but depending on your level that might be tough. The town south (Summerville I think is the name) has super mutants there too.  I find them wandering around a lot in the whole Toxic Waste area to the north.  trying to think of other areas but those are the ones I think of the most.
---
Please forgive me.
---
This. 
---
Power User3, Gunsmith 5, Batteries Included 3, Stabilised 3, and Scrapper for the last point.
---
I *really* like mine so imo it's worth it. 6 items! No glass covering!
---
iirc no, for neither the display case nor the fridge
---
I have to say, this game is pretty bad, and yet I am somehow compelled to log in every day, buy their shit on the atom shop, and just screw around for like an hour or 2.  There is absolutely no point to this game, yet here I am playing it.  I don't get it.  All I do these days is wait for people to occupy a workshop, then go kill them and steal their stuff.  That's about it.
---
I like how if we can't reach the finish line, they just move the finish line, lol.
---
Same. I was not into Fallout 4 because the world seemed so smooshed together, but 76 lets you just roam around and find random, interesting stuff. I genuinely think it's a great game.
---
Ultracite gatling laser plan is a rare drop for bog events. Usually bog's vendor robots sell ultracite laser plan.
---
I just checked again. Nope, not there.
---
Dude same, hate that you have to craft a whole new one
---
Guess we’ll just have to agree to disagree.
---
It's definitely worth it!! So much nicer than those janky display cases with glass.
---
I named all my heavy guns with Decepticon names, all my rifles are named after 80’s action hero movies, and my shotguns are named after infamous Irish massacres. No idea why I went this route...
---
For whatever reason INT is correlated to XP and with the Legendary Run underway maximizing your INT does help. I wasn't a low health build and I didn't use Unyielding armor prior to the Run, but things as they are... I'm now taking the +15 INT boost from sub 20% health along with a full set of Unyielding even as a Junkie's build
---
I’d love to donate. 
---
If I wasn’t 400lbs over carry
---
The microwave is necessary for reheating the random bits of pre war food I get from missions.
---
This, but I found out my accident after meeting the requirements and bought the space anyway. :(
---
IE Mini gun 
---
The Taskmaster
---
They'll probably put them in the legendary run...
---
A true horde event would be the best thing. I long to be overrun by an overwhelming number of enemies.
---
See Roxy, or Wren at Crater, Davenport at the Overseer’s house, and Ward at Foundation for your daily treasury notes. 9 available each day from doing all three. They reset at 8pm EST. Alternatively do public events.
---
Your choice, you do as you please. I'm just giving you an answer to your, "I would love private servers" comment.
---
That sounds like a conspiracy theory.  I mean, you’re posting but not naming, sounds a lot like just trying to stir the pot.
---
Move your camp 76 times
---
Nah, the info on the Wiki is simply outdated. I'd need a bunch of severely high levels to do some counting between level ups to verify that it doesn't flatten out at 1000 like it used to but I doubt it. And, quite frankly, with the current system it will already take ages to get anywhere near 1000. I mean, reaching 1000 means that you've accumulated a whooping \~80 million XP over the course of 1 character.
---
I honestly just don't know why we aren't getting a legendary perk slot or whatever for every 50 levels, starting at say, level 100.  Level 210?  Great!  Here's 3 Slots/upgrades/whatever.  So easy, but somehow they've come up with the most monotonous, tedious and punishing system that defies game design.
---
I have a super sledge called Forgiveness, carry over from my time in Elderscrolls 4 when I named hammer I enchanted Forgiveness because I'd use it to hit NPCs that annoyed me or pissed me off and every time I'd hit someone with it id imagine the angels chorus [from this scene of marvelous misadventures of flapjack playing](https://youtu.be/LAo93xkO1y8)
---
Yes please! I don't really like mod games, probably because my hands are out of place so I end up making my game unstable, but I'd love that! Countless times I've lost loot because I couldn't see the damn body/meat pile.
---
I didn't even know at that time that it was possible to be invisible, that's how little I knew LOL. I thought the first person fast travelled away.
---
It appears it was a visual bug right?
---
Yes, that is my question - currently, none of them do.
---
Oh jeez thats a lot. Im setteld just fine 😂
---
I think it is. But there is some weird behavior
---
Same here. Working dad that only play when the kids are in bed and, all the rest activities are done for the day. I can basically play more than two hours, maybe 4 during the weekend.
---
As a result I'm doing my best but just progressed about 33% :-(
---
Full health builds can never be a Sneaking as a Bloodied build can, should a bloodied choose to go the Sneak route.
---
This looks to violate rule 7 of this sub, too. 
---
Also, who cares?
---
How so? The damage values wouldn’t change, only the means by which you reach them. In fact, it would make them powerful crippling weapons.
---
I mean you can milk the brahmin...so yeah, why not eggs from chickens?
---
Vendors don't sell the ult gat laser recipe. You purchased a plan for a receiver, not the weapon.
---
Hopefully his pet will trigger it if he has one ;) RIP Fido!
---
I believe bloody mess currently still is multiplicative on PTS. 
---
Don’t quote me on that, but I noticed that energy damage isn’t showing ANY perk/mutation/legendary effect buffs in the pip-boy... EXCEPT for bloody mess. That one show.
---
ive been playing on and off due to uni work and I'm at level 44 I think I'm gonna lose
---
I consistently hit SB's with 30-40k damage (according to the damage numbers) in VATS and they're not going down. It's frustrating as hell.
---
It seems like a missed atom shop opportunity here. It should be like the collecttrons, you could get deathclaw eggs with one skin or mothman or radtoad with another. Offer a skin and get crazy new recipes with eggs you have never seen before.  I mean this could be fun but Bethesda seems to hate fun and would rather give poop rewards. I mean you have killed Earl by now and saw what the collosal problem bullet sponge reward are I take it .. lol, but it's not really funny just sad. 🙂
---
Modern day game logic is micro transactions out the wazzoo!
---
What did it change for you? It added 15 hours of quests and around 5 new guns but with insane grind. Are you just playing to get the guns that you don't even need because every enemy is so weak anyway?
---
My understanding was it was supposed to be account wide.
---
it would be a nice emote
---
Not related but the jetpack chest piece for 2k gold is this the jetpack?
---
It’s more about the type of weapon and what “abilities” make sense to wield it. Perception doesn’t give more rifle damage... but it does make sense that rifles rely heavily on your accuracy (perception). 
---
Heavy weapons and shotguns aren’t really “accurate” guns; but they do need a lot of strength to carry around (HW) or handle (shotguns)
---
Currently, the center laser does the default damage and the other four do 25%. With a shotgun, it would only do the full labeled damage if every pellet hit you target, this is not true with the beam splitter
---
All Junkies need is a Junkies weapon and some addictions.
---
There is no Junkies build.
---
You should look for a two handed melee build. I am sure there's plenty on YouTube. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Public Test Server. Where they test new patches before publishing them to the "live" servers.
---
Same lol, it is literally impossible for me to get anywhere close to “winning”, I doubt I’ll even hit the orange tiles.
---
I named my double-bladed flaming Chainsaw  "The Burner", my Ex Mutant slayers LMG "The Buzzsaw" and I named my grenade launchers all Kenny. Kenny the m79, Kenny mk2 the auto grenade launcher, and Kenny mk3 the furious auto grenade launcher.
---
So instead of "OH my God they killed Kenny" like in South Park, i can say " oh my God I killed him with Kenny".
---
I wish he were still with us.    
---
I'd be honored to be remembered like that.
---
Thank you!
---
That's exactly why I carry a lot of food and water xD I eat rad-away like candies when I do events like radiation rumble or go to nuked zones farming, plus with speed demon it's a matter of minutes before my character gets dehydrated and hungry. I'm not complaining, I have a very high carrying capacity and fridges, I just sometimes lose food amongst all the other aid items I have with me :p I really like your idea about not getting hungry/thirsty while at camp tho. it's annoying when you rebuild your base and have to take several breaks to drink and eat xD
---
Public test server.
---
It is where they canvas a slated update for bugs before applying to the game, by allowing random people to test the patch and report bugs to the developers.
---
I've seen this on PS4 as of late. Encrypted too. Bosses just torched in about 10 seconds. Fucking cheaters man. Why even play?
---
Create an alt and just move a camp around.
---
What system are you on? I can take your place in like three to four hours if you're on Xbox so the joke can continue.
---
The Ammo perk is the only one I plan on maxing out right away. 
---
The damage rebalance that's currently being tested on the PTS means that I, a full health PA heavy gunner will need more ammo should that be rolled out without changes.
---
And One Wasteland with the level 100 enemies on the eastern half of the map also means that I'll need more ammo. So, the Ammo perk is a must have for me.
---
The rest I'll get over time. Rushing it will only prove to be a stupid idea because Bethesda will no doubt change it when they release it and people start to riot.
---
I know right? Who in their right mind will ever complete this challenge? I would do it as a cap sink if it weren't for the fact that blueprinting your camp just plain doesn't work because of the "no support" nonsense when you try placing something.
---
I think you lose anything you’ve done in the last 5 to 10 minutes if the game crashes. I’ve transferred weapons to an alt and was about to log out of the server but it crashed before I could leave and I lost some really good stuff because of it.
---
It's not certain that what's on the PTS today is what will be deployed in the next patch. Hopefully the feedback gained from the PTS will inspire some less drastic changes, but we'll have to wait and see.
---
Personally I'm still plodding my way through the Wastelander's content, so I still have plenty of game to play outside of the LR when I finally have time to get back to it again.
---
Is there any chem/alcohol related perks I need
---
Bethesda just hates fun. 
---
That has got to be the stupidest thing a person could say.
---
Anything more than 20 stimpaks is excessive when you run vampire.    Reload time is pretty much the only time I take damage.   And the chemist backpack mod is better than traveling pharmacy, those str perk points are more useful elsewhere
---
Egg grenades
---
Boo hoo, if you can't spare an hour a day to play, that'd on you, not the game, manage ur time better.
---
You do keep the Scrapbox after a subscription expires. Everything in there stays in there and you can craft from it or remove items from it to your heart's content. You just cannot put more things INTO it. Does that help?
---
That's the thing though, Bethesda doesn't care about the casual player. They only care about the players who are whales and spend money on atoms and fallout 1st.
---
Not wasting my time min/maxing f76 obviously...
---
If I could ever get my hands on the stimpak diffuser recipe, I’d never have super stims taking up space
---
Hemlock holes workshop up north has 3 acid deposits you can farm and use extractors.  Better if you’re on a private server though
---
Care to elaborate on why players shouldn’t have a say in changes coming to the game they play and support?
---
So you are super hip with cheating. Got it.
---
Meh it's just one way of playing the game, I like to see how far I can push the game mechanics and damage numbers are a really easy way of keeping track.
---
Im a single adult, i dont have childrens, but i work from 10 am to 9 pm mon-fri.
---
I still manage to make my own food, do laundry, hang out with friends, clean my house, work on personal projects, make google sheets and tools for the FO76 community, answer questions from other fo76 players on the latinamerican facebook page, visit my parent two times a week, im also starting to get more involved on the Trading discord and i dont know if this have anything to do with it, but i live in a "third world country", only thing im not doing is exercise, but i may be able to squesh half an hour everyday just to prove my point.
---
Currently at level 96 on the Legendary Run, didnt pay a single ATOM, expecting to finish it by Tuesday, just in time so i can play the colossal problem witouth distractions, i even help a friend during a week to log in into his account so he wouldnt miss any S.C.O.R.E. while he was on vacations.
---
Stop complaining, this Race wasnt hard at all, here, [use my spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/edit#gid=0) if you want, organize yourself, dont blame your SO/childrens for not having time to play (in case you have any) , im not special, some of my friends with more obligations have already done it too, if you dont have one hour to play every day (wich is more time than needed to do the daylies), thats fine, you probably have bigger problems than a videogame and you should be addessing them, not writing reddit posts.
---
Also, WE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO EVERYTHING IN THE GAME, you dont need to complete the race, is not an obligation, Bethesda is making the rewards available in game for gold bullions on patch 22 and you can pay for levels with ATOMS, they need to make money too, and they of course are going to take advantage of lazy players.
---
This was not a message directed to only the OP, this is directed to everyone that think that FO76 is a hard game, is not, is really easy, way too easy. But, as any other activity requires a little bit of engagmente on your part, the game will not play itself.
---
honestly, power armor with some actual "clothes" on it rather than a paintjob would be baller; be like an Ultramarine or Raven Guard
---
I mean there are a lot of ways around the food issue, but they are all under Endurance perks and most people dump endurance as a stat, or at least have no interest in taking things like Domedary which makes drinks fill more water, or up all night that makes your hunger/thirst go down slower.  
---
Most people have pushed aside the survival aspect.  
---
That’s why I’m kinda excited about the legendary perks.  I can get a perk card that gives up to +5 endurance and then I can slot a few extra END cards for things just like this. 
---
I would be happy if “Happy Camper” at max rank was upped to 100%, for the reason you specified.
---
scouts magazine can reduce move cost by 80% which is helps
---
Just saying, that ammo machine can't make 2mm EC, otherwise you're absolutely right. Good thing is that if they build it in their camp they won't ever be able to remove it and even if they move the camp it will still eat their budget.
---
No, you don't have to keep using chems after you got your addictions set and you cannot deny the minuses with any perk.
---
This worked fine at one point, I swear. It's like the fish lamp that they broke forever ago. It became an ugly green missing texture thing for a while. I think nearly all the lights are screwed up, some are way too bright and obviously so like some posters you can barely see because they're so washed out. I have a pretty dark display, too.
---
Oh yeah for sure. What I was remembering was a player mod and it didn't have animations.
---
That aside, I would like my character to smoke too
---
i use a Quad explosive double barrel
---
I just logged in first time in a few months, got excited about cool looking Legendary Run, did 6 challenges, realised it will take me hundreds of hours to get anything and immediately got frustrated and bored.
---
After I explored the map, completed the quests and upgraded my guns there is nothing for me to do. I would love to grind this game if the grinds  weren't so ridiculous with subpar reawards and no meaningful end goal.
---
I've heard plenty of interviews from BGS bigwigs talking about the possibility of movies and TV. Every time, they said it just wasn't the right pitch or the right company.
---
Now, they've contracted with perhaps the ideal team - Westworld has been great (although the 3rd Season wasn't quite as good). 
---
No conspiracy - just good timing.
---
This bugs the heck out of me. Why doesn’t it either come with pants, or even better, allow it to be placed over certain outfits; casual outfit, t shirt and slacks, etc. I hardly wear it because I look silly running around in under armour bottoms 😒
---
tell me, what exactly has changed beside cut content and fixed bugs that respawned on live servers?
---
What are you disagreeing with ? Facts? That’s like saying people who go to scorched earth to kill the queen are griefers lol
---
God damn these people for playing the game how the game was intended to be played lol
---
Is this like the SCORE board where people wigged the fuck out in WEEK 1 that it was too hard to finish yet here we are three weeks from finish and most people's CAMPs show that they're finished already?
---
I hope this is sarcasm
---
OR! they can nerf Bloodied so others builds are on the same playing field and the game is challenging
---
if it was the vault tec duffle then its not your fault anyways, it's got a terrible click box
---
I don't run vampire, I use pa, so I can't use a backpack, and I seemingly have all the perks I need.
---
Hmm, is there any specific addictions that would be better to get
---
wait till the damage nerf hit in. even more people will use hacked weapons to compensate.
---
Flooded trainyard, hemlock holes maintenance, CAMP on an acid vent, rinse and repeat
---
When they patch line in the sand I'm going to be so pissed. On a new character I went from level 16 to level 51 in a day.
---
If you're on PS4 I'd be willing to give you a 3\* Unyielding Forest Scout chest piece I picked up today. It won't solve the problem, but hey. It might help
---
Can you still join the PTS?
---
What’s the exchange rate? How many perk cards must you scrap to get a perk coin?
---
Allot of players. Reboot the whole machine.
---
Do magic weapons still work?
---
I'm not only talking about bloodied builds, all builds are getting a Nerf. 
---
I just think its sad our community here isn't seeing that this isn't a bloodied only issue, the amount of hate towards bloodied when all I'm saying is all builds shouldn't get nerfed.
---
I think buffing other builds would be a great idea, or even adding new ones in. Not nerfing all builds
---
Is your generator connected to a power conduit? If not you need to connect it to a conduit for the lamp the light up.
---
We have a double score weekend coming up so you don’t have to go out of your way
---
This game is a giant daily chore list, I can't bother while working and having friends irl to meet every now and then.
---
I gave up the game 100% for now cause it was stressing me.
---
It is the way it is because Fallout/Bethesda has become bigger than every one of us who made it what it is today. We created this beast and now we’re paying the price!
---
Not to mention the fact that it's not as wide as the other display cases so you end up freeing up space just by using them.
---
Half of this community bent over backwards to defend the score system because of how allegedly empowering it was for casual players. Now the reality is very obviously the opposite.
---
It's so depressing because there is no way zenimax isn't learning from how accepting of this monetization scheme the player base is. We can assuredly expect to see a cosmetic store with "SpaceBux™" in starfield.
---
Yeah, I think it was that. Was just staring at it wondering how to pick it up lol.
---
the wasteland won't be the same without him, much love man, stay strong, you got this
---
They are exaggerating. The screenshot that was shared here earlier shows 140/140 fire/ice resist:
---
https://imgur.com/MltQv9E
---
How are they hidden? I want to know what to look out for.
---
I think some o us are spending money, maybe it's just me. I am xbox, 1st, raiders and settlers package, and the Piper outfit was so cute I had too, please don't hate me for that, but I couldn't agree more about them just not caring 🙂
---
Definitely not. Would've included /s if so.
---
Correct. I recently just kept respawning until the guy trying to take it just gave up.
---
The receiver plans are about 550 caps. This cost about 3000 caps.
---
That does sound pretty fun, any ideas to help me start that build?
---
Real talk what's people's silo runs average time?
---
I've done a few now but other than lockpick and hack I don't use any glitches or whatever to cut down time. I'm in the teens for my runs which isn't too bad I thought.
---
9 hours a week sounds about right for me as well.  Sadly I’ll probably end on only the firefly jar....which I suppose I’ll be ok with.  Really wanted to at least get the chicken coop though.
---
That... cannot be intentional. If that’s true, the splitter is flat doubling the damage of the weapon.
---
If this is the case, and they choose to make it be affected by shotgun perks, they would likely leave this behavior, so it would still do damage in the same way, because Bethesda seems to have questionable designs like this on many items.
---
I am on pc but still greatly appreciate act of kindness. At times I feel Bethesda don't deserve the great community it has.
---
I am sure there's a guide here on the reddit, listing minuses for every addiction. Search button at the top works quite well. 😊
---
Usually it's alcohol and 4 more.
---
Eventually will. Some people enjoy building, and move their camp whenever they get a new idea or just for a change of scenery
---
It was the same in all the other fallout games
---
I'm low level but want to do a Halloween camp myself...got some items for it, hope to get that 'Raider tree with cage' on the seasons before it expires, as so far almost to the end of the first part of the board.
---
It seems like it’d be a really nice QoL tweak your give a coin for every level above 50.
---
1) Find junkies weapon
---
2) Do drugs
---
But seriously though, be mindful of what you get addicted to. Some of the debuffs from withdrawal can be....... unpleasant. Like, you don't want to get hooked on X Cell and then have a -1 to all special stats unless you keep snorting it or bang buffout 24/7 unless you want a -1 to strength in your melee build. 
---
I went with good ol' Merican hooch, daytripper, mentats, daddy o and med x.
---
If you have Beth launcher, yes.
---
Although I am not an adult, I can see how the Legendary Run is unfair for many. I am not allowed to play on weekdays because of school. I would say that if they could possibly extend the legendary run to three-four months and have three times as many weekly challenges.
---
Stop moaning if you don't enjoy it go play something else dude
---
10 caps for plans is the price you get rid of your plans at since your target market is newbies who have a few hundred caps at most.
---
I renamed my slug buster into nut buster.
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks allot!
---
And considering perk packs and combining cards gets you more coins its actually less than what we would have had but would still be welcome
---
We should be able to collect the poop from the chickens and Braham and turn it into fertilizer.
---
I really like the ability to scrap perk cards to clean up clutter, but the same could be achieved by just letting us drop them.
---
Tying scrapped cards to ranks of legendary perks incentivizes locking in to one specific build and penalizes experimentation.  There's plenty of other ways to implement these points that don't have the same drawbacks.
---
You have to fast travel to your camp hell be there soon the more your with him the higher chance he has of dying
---
My Explosive Combat Shotgun is called the Flak Cannon. I don't think explosive shotguns has the same power as they did in FO4, but that name is very apt, especially when killing vertibirds.
---
What an awesome, thoughtful and unique way to honor your friend!
---
It's not just Fallout. Every game that has a season pass is labour intensive and requires upmost dedication and it's almost impossible to complete two at the same time unless you dedicate time and ignore everything else, which simply wouldnt do.
---
Companies need to start realising this. They can begin by reducing the time it takes to complete the season pass, and add in game currency to further levels (Fallout for example, if you complete tier 100, every next 5 levels or so could award in game currency like atoms, gold bullion, caps etc.) Destiny 2 has this implementation and it keeps me coming back every now and then and prevents it from getting stale.
---
But they wont do anything about it, simply because they design the pass to get you to stay on the game. It's a very clever strategy, but also quite cruel
---
Thank you for the info
---
In the current implementation the slots are account-wide (so your level 80 character gets 6 slots because at least one of your characters is above level 300), but the perks and perk coins are tied to characters.
---
If you're thinking this has been a change in what they were planning, you're not wrong, but the change was a while ago. The first public statements on legendary perks were from QuakeCon 2019 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLbWx61Xo6A&amp;t=1848s), and Jeff did say then that perks you unlocked would be able to be used on new characters right away. But by the time it got into PTS they had abandoned that.
---
Take it for a month and spend most of your time hunting for junk
---
use this  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) 
---
fill that box as much as possible. Then cancel it. You still get to use the junk you've collected.
---
People like to complain.
---
The only other fallout game where this could apply would be fallout 4. Of the others, fallout 3 had the tri beam, protectrons gaze and the metal blaster, all of which functioned as shotguns. In Vegas, the laser rifle had a splitter mod, which split it into two beams, and again, damage was split evenly between them.
---
As for fallout 4 - I don’t know enough about how the splitter works to answer whether or not you’re correct on that front.
---
One
---
Does nobody in this sub get thaty Comment was a joke? Wow
---
That's genius
---
Some dude posted saying “don’t forget the perk card for dog food”. I replied to him that the post was about that perk card, he deleted his comment and downvoted all replies in the thread.  Some people 😑
---
Ahahaha ps4? I’d be happy to message you the guys name, it’s seared into my brain
---
Because it's still good to play despite all the shitness. Imagine how good it would be if it wasnt for all the problems,  that's what keeps people playing, the dim and distant hope that dream gets realised....
---
INT has always meant more XP in every Fallout Game
---
Just tame him then leave and let him do his own thing just make sure he makes it to your camp before you leave the server.
---
I get that but what I wonder is who actually have time to down vote any criticism in this subreddit. My post was up for a minute and already has zero karma.
---
I see so many camps with fairly common plans and especially anything building related selling for minimum of 100 caps. Doesn't help that the daily challenge is to buy/sell 3 items from camps (i know you can just buy 3 bullets for 1 cap a piece).
---
Line in the sand is not bugged, its a feature lol
---
It’s a glitch search it up on YouTube but watch out you may get banned for it idk
---
F1st is worth it in my opinion, if you really want to save on it and still reap all the benefits, have a month on and month off starting from the middle of the month so you can claim two months worth of F1st cosmetics. It effectively saves you 6 months of subscriptions and the months you don’t have 1st active can be used to accumulate resources to shove into the infinite storage for next month.
---
Agreed. That’s probably what it was. But I wonder why they haven’t switched it over?
---
The scrap box and tent are nice. The private servers are marginally better but still can be laggy and prone to crashes. The rewards they initially promised are rarely delivered. If you have problems the customer support still gives you the same lackluster service if it isn't an easy fix. I paid for a month of 1st and never got any of the rewards. They also stopped responding for two weeks. When I emailed them asking for a response they told me to wait until patch 21 which also fixed nothing.
---
When it comes to caps I just wish there could be an option of barter like in all Fallout games before (not sure about 4th), you give me this, I give you that of the same value, place caps on top for the difference. Or at least if you buy something from the vendor, those caps refresh fully, so it would be an actual trade, not dump all your unwanted stuff for some caps and come again tomorrow because even if you bought something expensive from me I don't have any caps to buy from you..
---
Joining any public team gives you other benefits.  I like it since food items are more effective.
---
My game isn't broken, otherwise I wouldn't be able to play it.
---
Yeah they aren't as bad as people are acting like. If someone is that busy they shouldn't even care. When I'm too busy to play I genuinely don't give a shit what's going on
---
You need 5 addictions.  But you dont want to reduce your strength so your best bet is to get addicted to
---
alcohol  Plus 1 charisma /minus 1 agility
---
daddy o   minus 1 intelligence/ minus 1 perception
---
daytripper minus 1 charisma/ minus 1 luck
---
med x  minuss 1 agility/  minus 10 dr
---
mentats  minus 1 charisma
---
While you're in love with the game, I would say it worth it myself as you get an allotment of atoms every month that basically pays for itself. In addition the scrap box alone changes the game for you as you no longer have to manage junk in your stash [scrap at least]. The survival tent comes in handy and the free atomic shop exclusives and sales are a bonus as well. Didnt even mention the private server, but there's that too.
---
That being said after having it for a year+ and all I do now is weekend grinding for rep and s.c.o.r.e. I find myself wondering how long until I stop renewing lol.
---
It does make it hard to go back once activated, as you'll never be able to wish the junk inventory management on yourself again, haha.
---
But like I said, when youre in the fun zone and still love the game? Worth it.
---
IMHO.
---
I'm in the 50s
---
I've been pretty much every high damage build (bloodied, junkies, berserker) in this game and I can honestly say that, for me, full health PA heavy gunner is the most fun.
---
Yes, it's easy mode since you rarely die. Yes, I'm what PVPers like to call a soup build.
---
I don't care. I run around with a AA Gatling Gun and enjoy the game and if I need to drop a boss like the Queen or the Collossus I just switch to Final Word, change some perk cards and waste a couple thousand bullets. 
---
You can play this game as min/maxer but if you find fun with other builds, go for it.
---
The game is under Bethesda. Having hope is a foolish thing to have. This game gets bombed with shitty content that costs atom that has not gone through any testing at all. Bethesda is just using it's fanbase as a giant target for their bukkake of shitty content that people pay for. Haters gonna hate. I have not spend a dime on atom points or fallout first. I got the game for under 10$ and played for somewhat 2-300 hours. If I want more fallout I rather play fallout 4 with free mods or replay new Vegas or fallout 2.
---
Power armour + vampires minigun.
---
5mm is dead easy to craft, you permantly heal, and outheal damage taken. Works for PvP in workshops/monster mash too.
---
Gun goes brrrrrrrrrr
---
This should be super helpful. It’s what I used to build my Junkie 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/
---
Also, I run Traveling Pharmacy on my Junkie commando build. Chems get heavy quick.
---
The broken line In the sand event. Is that where the enemies just fall down from the sky all at once? It happened to me the other day. I thought someone was glitching the server lol
---
I named my legacy Junkie's Explosive Gatling Plasma "The Burninator"
---
Berserkers needs a huge buff. Imagine how fun it would be to one-shot everything but at the same time be vulnerable to one-shots by almost any enemy
---
We got a smartass over here. The game is broken and if you don't want to see it fine by me.
---
Loot disappearing. Game locking up Durning loading. T posing enemies. People being able to steal items from vendors and display cases. Paid content that simply doesn't work.
---
But yeah, the game "works".
---
I'm a chef, I work 60+ hours a week, I've finished the run. I only farmed adventure mode dailies and weeklies. I did none of the nuclear winters. I farmed XP at West tek for the repeatable do score. I did half of the board in the double XP weekend. It's just a little dedication to the cause. I also went 57 levels during the double XP weekend. The only atoms I spent on levels were the atoms I got from the run itself.
---
They don’t care.
---
So all I need is this and I'll have the jet pack?  I thought I saw some where you needed the jet pack AND the ss chest piece to attach it too
---
It’s tolerable in normal Power armor but this makes it way worse
---
Pop a cranberry relish, and brain fungus soup, and I can grind out 300 points faster than I can revive 2 team members in NW.  That's why its there.  I shifted to int 15, and run with a 26 int after buffs.  Its routine to get 200-300 xp per kill.   Doesnt take much killing to make progress.
---
There's bots that down vote anything that have been in the sub since it's creation.
---
Squishy, no armour, no ammo, no good legendary guns... I remember that nightmare.
---
It’s a camp exploit. Potential ban.
---
If you meant the ARMCO Ammunition Producer, you have to purchase the plans from the Raiders when you hit Ally
---
Monongah is probably the quickest/easiest to power up if you're not using a fusion generator due to the internal layout
---
I rather get rid of them for something at all then drop them on the ground because they sell too slowly and taking up my weight. They sell fairly quickly,i am also near crater in savage divide. Location is everything newbies constantly teleport to my camp to get closer to crater, then discover everything i sell is insanely cheap!
---
WinWin!
---
what if i put it in a workshop will i get banned?!
---
Tf...
---
Lmaaaoo. No there is actually negative 1 PC players since i got down voted.
---
When will people accept that this game has never had competent designers behind it. These are the people who thought that players wouldn't want to see human npcs and that most players would like a world fraught with competitive pvp. Look at the state of this game's UI, legendary weapon modifiers, inventory management, or weapons balance. Each one of them is an absolute dumpster fire and they aren't even remotely the full extent of the game's astounding mediocrity.
---
It took them **over a year** to add a group making function to a multiplayer game!
---
Thanks, but was there any comment from devs about that changes or maybe they still planing to do it as intended?
---
I want to know who the actual fuck at Bethesda made this design choice, what their job title is, and why they did it. This is such bad design I need an explanation.
---
As it is the system is the most baffling grind I’ve ever seen in a video game, and between this, the ammo convertor, and the PTS nerf to all damage, I’m pretty convinced a lot of the devs simply don’t play the game at all and are completely out of touch with it.
---
Less scrap/repair kits, less perk card packs, and less player icons. More bullion, atoms, scrip, and more scrap boxes (the ones that give you scrap). Not another supersledge or handmade skin (I think we have enough handmade skins as is). How about a fixer skin, or a gauntlet skin for the deathclaw or powerfist. Bundle all the power armor paints into one reward instead spreading them out through the board (they’re all the same anyway and half the player base doesn’t use power armor anyway). Nuclear key cards, assaultron recall cards, ammo crates (like something that would have a bunch of random ammo in it, or something let you choose 1,000 rounds of whatever ammo you like), nuka drinks bundle (quantum, regular, dark, etc).
---
I’m at about 1 hour a day. I wake at 4am and get 2 hours to go for a run and play before my son wakes up (he’s 5).  He’s up until 9:30, so I have 0 minutes the rest of the day to play.  I just started playing through (level 9) so, right now, I’m just happy to play the game and experience a new Fallout (my favorite franchise).  
---
Mind if I ask what the lunchbox rewards are and how to use them?  I’ve earned one, but couldn’t find it in my inventory after claiming it in the legendary run board.
---
I work 40 hours a week, I'm 88 I think right now.  Nothing about the run is required, it's for people who just want to put that much time into it.
---
Fucking lmao
---
"this game features grinding and thus I can't grind as much with a full time job - DAMN THIS EA COMPANY"
---
You guys are fucking hilarious
---
Yes people blue print it when they take over the ammunition factory.  you will have delete your camp to get rid of it.  There is a good chance of you getting banned for a while if you do it.  
---
I can run westek then lucky hole in about 20 minutes total.  Make all the ammo i need.
---
it's your nuke
---
With all that is it parallel to a bloodied or even close?
---
Bethesda tried to reinvent the wheel and gave us a fucking square instead.
---
Extra carry weight
---
I just hopped on after a two-month hiatus, only to find that I could still get stuck moving while crouched after I 'instanced' into a basement for a quest.  Logged right out after that.
---
I’ve heard from other posts it’s loud af, but haven’t seen it personally
---
Berserkers as is is actually fine now. It would be great if there were some non-dr clothes that provided buffs (and occupied armor slots) or maybe there was a non-dr version of the Chinese stealth armor, but really it works fine. But it’s gonna be badly broken by the proposed changes. Daily ops are gonna be essentially impossible for berserkers, between the lowered damage output, no stealth and the need to be in a team (good bye lone wanderer perk).
---
The main reason behind my distaste also is that the run has drained my casual fun out game. I felt like I was robotically doing dailies with 0 enjoyment after the 2nd week. Games at end of day should have an element of fun and for me the legendary run has been pretty much the opposite with the expectancy from Bethesda for me to be online every day regardless of time spent playing game outwith run or busy with work etc. I understand there are those people that keep saying it's easy just dedicate time. My point was that the time they want me to dedicate was to menial in game useless and seemingly pointless lazy tasks was a slap in face to myself and I'm sure many others who still commit regular time to the game.
---
I also wish the cryolators had some better sound effects.
---
Sort of wonder how mischief night will handle that change this year.  Negative XP for killing bots??
---
Doesn't help that Bethesda isn't even trying to do proper incident management. There are so many tools available, yet they just go "put it on the forum"
---
I think the bundle is way better deal if you can
---
There are plenty of empty rooms at Whitesprings...
---
Yeah and my replies getting negative karma while fans defending the game gets positive karma is on bots too?
---
All I'm saying is that this subreddit is funny.. I tend not to come on here often but all posts from this subreddit that gets on my main feed are negative.
---
For example the dude that payed for the 50 call and power armor skin with either hard earned atoms or payed for it with his hard earned real life money.
---
It's not the first time and not the last. We could go from the beginning with the bags, and the moldy helmets, or the cheap liquor. I'f Bethesda wanted to do good by them, they have an awful way to show for it.
---
Idk the conversion rate for 50 as I haven't had to make any yet. You should be able to look that up or eyeball it to get an idea. 50 cal and 5mm is going to convert at a terrible rate because they're for automatic heavy weapons. That said, the big value add I see in it is gunpowder gets heavy if you're carrying it around saving up for a crafting session. This technique means if you're using bandolier, which the vast majority do in my experience, that you can carry all the steel you need in the form of railway spikes, and never worry about lead or gunpowder.
---
I now think of the railway spikes I craft like I used to think of the gunpowder and lead I'd loot here and there to craft my bullets.
---
Exactly
---
Most people don't know you can turn off that annoying noise and the event goes on like normal.
---
Why don't you answer the question instead of being a dick? I'm no hardcore player but as far as I know the Queen and Colossal Wendido are the two endgame bosses in the game. Are there more or as I asked before are you counting regular mobs out in the world as "endgame"?
---
I tend to, my ultracite gatling laser is simply 'Pew Pew' but after the JFK experiance, i need to make more of an effort!
---
That thing is so fkn loud and annoying tbh. I didn't buy it but I have to mute my headset whenever I'm vendor shopping and they have it.
---
BUY IT!!! I missed out the first time, you def want it
---
Alls I saw was “Bethesda, I want to wear pants.” And it scared me. I thought Todd Howard was coming for my pants
---
Guess you're out of luck then.
---
I guess 50 on pc?
---
Wait till you are in the hundreds.  Set up relish and brain fungas soup, grind for 40 minites. It takes a solid hour.  If the requirement is repeated next season...  Its the worst one of the lot, and I usually skip the NW stuff.
---
Same. I'm a newish player and when a friend who showed me what's what in this game started the topic about builds I stopped him right there. Those builds may be great, but in my opinion you kinda limit yourself. I tried every damn weapon in this game, from rolling pin and shovel to ultracite Gatling laser and Fatman before I decided what I want to stick with and I had a lot of fun finding that very combination myself that works for me. At lvl 50ish with no build whatsoever I almost never died from tough enemies (well except SBQ). So I agree that you can do just fine without any specific build, but with proper perks. it's all just preference. I literally run a heavy gunner with max strength, close to max intellect and agility. I even use vats a lot. I might not be top damage dealer in the game, but I have what works for me and I enjoy it.
---
Totally fake.  No stairs, house would be floating
---
... Are you me?
---
Isn't an acceptable solution to either increase the number of perk coins you get back or reducing the cost of the legendary perks and perk upgrades?
---
Not at all. You spend real world money on your private world n its your nuke.
---
What is keeping you from playing the game "properly," whatever that means? Are you unable to kill things? Are you unable to travel? Or is it that you just want a Stashbox for free while others have to pay for it?
---
lots of roads and bridges around. 
---
lower whitesprings.
---
I use a vampire explosive one, but as a secondary gun, my main is a Junkies/FFR/15r
---
2 perk coins per 1 card. Used to be 5, but even then it was a slog. It costs 100 coins for the first upgrade, then that plus an additional 50 more per upgrade.
---
It's happening right now. But there's a player leveling up. He's somehow killing everything on spawn without moving.
---
You might want to consider not playing. It does not seem that Fallout 76 is your kind of game because they won't give you a free Stashbox without a subscription and that really irks you.
---
Another reason I'm childfree. A lot more time for gaming ;)
---
It won't even effect you.  You're not running with 10 multiplying bluffs that are turning to addition. This is for builds like my bloodied deathclaw that hit for 120k plus a swing to cars, 22k to the scorch queen. 
---
I can kill her in 40 seconds solo and that's what this is for
---
And they should continue to have said budget eaten when Beth fixes it and removes it from camps.
---
And I didn't know they didn't produce 2mm EC. Either way still greedy
---
I admire that kind of dedication and you will love the game until you finish the two short questlines as a lot did. Lunch boxes are found in your aid section of inventory. They are one time use and give timed buffs of many natures such as xp boosts or turning ghouls to confetti when killed. It's advisable to use them when near other players in game at say for example an event where they can also receive a random buff from you opening lunchbox near them. These buffs they receive won't be of detriment to the buffs you yourself would receive opening them. They will appear as named party favours on top left of screen once opened and can be viewed in the status tab of inventory under effects.
---
Well if that's true then it must be a bug
---
Like what tools?
---
Lucky Hole with Excavator gets me about 1300 Lead scrap. It's so good. Tanagra Town for Acid if needed. Easy bullets.
---
Have you ever seen a chicken coop? Shit everywhere.  And these are rad chickens, all their eggs are dead. It indicates a greater problem with fertility after the bombs dropped
---
Sounds a lot like a mod i used to have in fo4, same effects and mods needed the perks that were only available at higher levels. Very fun and balanced to use along with the heavy bos armor mod.
---
Throwing at vending machines highly overpriced. Thats what the eggs would be for
---
Junkies gives you plus 50 percent damage max with 5 addictions.   bloodied can do 80 or more dependihg on mutations and perk cards.  But you will die a lot as bloodied.  But there is no real penalty for dying all the time.
---
Oh boy! Here I go killing again!
---
&gt; because I don't see benefit of the other teams' bonuses at all
---
You don't see the benefit in +4 intelligence that boosts all xp not just events?
---
It's a bethesda staple. It's the only way they are able to get away with what they do
---
Who uses a machete, to cut through red tape
---
yeah, totally. especially those who sell that glitched ammo. I mean I would understand if you're absolutely desperately need ammo and don't have caps, but make caps of this is just not fair.
---
I wish  they did, I'd live in that ammo factory if they did xD I use gauss minigun lol.
---
I was lucky one of my buddies gave me 3k acid for moving my camp once.
---
The same weapons and glitches on are console too.
---
I AM in the hundreds, 156!
---
Ask yourself this, you're trapped in a small cage. Owned by some lunatic stomping around in power armor, or a fashion disaster. Depending on area there's either toxic fumes, earthquakes, poisonous water, attacks by monsters. The constant clank and hum of machines or Collectron spouting the same lines over and over at you. Strange people stealing your corn.. and your poop.
---
I'd prolly shit myself too.
---
I named my power armor Sir Hammerlock 🤷🏻‍♀️ My husband named his shotgun “This is my Boomstick”
---
I joined low level teams just to give and get boost to xp but I’m level 240 have most of my quest done xcept diffuser and couple of diseases
---
That is why I stopped playing and started playing Minecraft again. Fallout became a grind of just task after task. Forcing you into a loop if you want certain items. Don’t get me wrong I don’t think everything should be free. But if they made it like a normal battle pass like say fortnite where you can do week 1 at any time of the season that would give me reason to play.
---
Sadly he left when I went to launch a nuke on him! But I'm sure we'll cross paths again, it was quite quiet when he was on. I also messaged him to say I'd be sticking around for a while so I have his gt. I think I'll go find him this week and see if I can get the nuke in before he leaves!
---
now that you mentioned it has been a while since I last got it with my main.
---
but I just got it with a mule I created. cant say for sure when, but I created this mule this month. 
---
maybe creating a new char it may proc?
---
This is NOT FUCKING NERF IT IS REWORK they didnt nerf anything just change how dmg system works stop talking like this is what happen to TSE weapons
---
Well ofc you can, but as people pointed out you'll need some kind of perks to survive. SS armor offers nice radiation resistance, if I'm not mistaken the best of all non-PA, also radshield can help, but I'm not sure if it suppresses mutations or not.
---
ServiceNow, Jira... Hell, even a form to complete rather than just forum posting would be better
---
Seneca rocks
---
you looking for full set of unyealding SS armor and some of the "magic" gun or "magic" armor.
---
LOL! Maybe...?
---
Other season passes you can do week 1 at any time of the season. Which is why I don’t like fo76’s because you can’t do that.
---
Things to consider:
---
Make sure to use FO1st to farm harder-to-get materials needed for crafting/repairing.  You can easily farm steel and lead (and you should), but think about things such as copper, screws, gears, fiber optics, ballistic fiber, and adhesive (for example).  These are things that can really help when repairing and/or crafting.  
---
Use an alt to create an adhesive farm if you do not have the building space on your main character.  Using private servers you can transfer the crops/fertilizer needed to an alt.  Then, use the alt to create a large adhesive farm.  Every so often you use the alt to farm the crops, craft the starch/adhesive or transfer the crops to your main and let your main craft adhesive.  This works best if your alt/main have the green thumb perk and super-duper maxed. Using private servers with an alt means you don't have the risk of other players taking your crops.  There is some small risk to transferring stuff using private servers.  Only do it with stuff you are willing to risk losing.
---
Yeah, especially the golf course. But it's usually taken so you're gonna have to keep server hoppin to get an empty one
---
I did it yesterday but it wont let me sink barrels with agility anymore
---
I’ve seen it and to me it’s very annoying...
---
Yup. Mostly learned trading tbh. I love the scrip slot machine and trading.
---
get a prime gauss rifle plan and learn it. It will let you craft ultracite 2mm. This is the only way to do it
---
Eh I'm 32 no kids, but it takes me all of 30 min to finish my daylies sans the NW ones
---
&gt;I am starting to feel they are becoming closer and closer to EA with every broken half assed patch release.
---
Yup. That's Bethesda for you.
---
Fuck no, it’s a lot of work to launch a nuke if you want the rewards to yourself you’ve earned them
---
I'm pretty sure they just have no idea what they're doing.
---
Nerfing everything plus never adding new builds or adding more for existing builds equals more people getting bored and going to other games.
---
The legendary run took away atom challenges which made people more interested in the atom shop and gave you the freedom to choose what you earn. Plus they expect you to pay for mediocre items to get to the end to get less then you would have from the original challenges.
---
Taking away building tricks that help you make a camp that you enjoy and limit builders to take away that experience which they enjoy doing which also limits how much camp stuff they're selling because a lot of them are looking for new games that promote building because they're so tired of fighting with the current building system.
---
Basically all that's left is looting, shooting, and photography unless you want more pa, combat, and handmade skins or lawn ornaments 
---
Pretty sure they're just trying to kill it before the turn of the year though
---
Maybe someone in the pts can answer this.
---
Part of the reason I stopped playing was because I was missing out on events because I am gone at least 50-55 hours a week but don't want to only play 76 on my off time.
---
Does Tanagra town have an acid extractor in it or what?
---
Thanks; did not realize that.
---
Nope, greedy is the assholes that mow down the Imposter Sheepsquatch or the SBQ with hacked 50cals or do nothing at events then one shot the legendaries. You did the work so enjoy your rewards. If you want to share the rewards with other people then do it.
---
What yonggo said. As far as I’m concerned it’s a bug (ALL bullion prime receivers are like this) but I haven’t heard a word from Bethesda about it.
---
Who’s fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack.
---
Yeah for anyone wondering if you put survival tents near where they are supposed to spawn they spawn near the sonic gen
---
That’s not what i said. I said if you are in the PTS and aren’t taking the time to report issues, you can’t complain later on reddit.
---
Oh yeah, this game has a lot of mini-events and hidden Easter eggs and references and just lore details everywhere. I once stumbled upon a steaming pipe out of the ground that you could sniff and a corpse with a funny note :p still remember that sniff lol
---
I just want to say, thank you for your opinions. 
---
I didn't intend this post to become solely about bloodied builds. I think it's crazy to Nerf the whole system which is what they are doing. Yes bloodied builds get hit the hardest but what about all the builds that struggle anyway? This is only going to cause more problems in my opinion.
---
I had my lamps off
---
Who doesn’t care?
---
If you are playing on Xbox, how come he is playing on PC? It would have been awesome if you both could play together on the same system (too bad there is no cross platform option)
---
It comes up, but seems rare. And yeah Agi won’t sink the barrels since Wastelanders
---
I would prefer they buff other effects to be honest, this isn't only about bloodied builds, it's a system wide nerf
---
yeah, i didnt realize three is also too small a number. idk im new to the game. i guess thats a crime based on the downvotes lmao.
---
Yeah I'm not even high lvl just 150 and I've respeced 4 times. Super fucked
---
.... why would you possibly think that was greedy?
---
I will admit the idea is similar but there are some key differences that make it less punishing. 
---
* The grind is designed to be hit with daily/weekly challenges within a finite amount of time.  This is significantly less then the grind for the cards will be.  
---
* The challenge speed up and break up the grind.  It isn't just pushing experience constantly for ten weeks.  It provides different things to do.  
---
* All of the rewards are vanity so there is less pressure to complete it.
---
I expect an update post to this, you should try to Nuke them when the scorched earth event just began so they'll be too occupied with the scorchbeast queen to realise what's going on.
---
With bloody mess perk . . . It's . . . Even harder
---
I see a new player I usually drop everything I don’t want in front of him lol most of the time probably leaves them overweight but what the heck I don’t need it
---
TBH, Bethesda tried that initially during first backlash over lack of content and grind gates as 'well this is the first mmo of its kind...' knowing full well it wasnt.
---
I dont mind failures, they show effort was made and room to learn from the failure, however, its becoming so common that its considered 'normal' that companies now work to spin bad press to a positive via double speak or outright false promises rather than address the error or failure, get ahead of it, take accountability and work to correct it.
---
Bethesda, however, seems to have finally graduated the college of EA/Ubisoft as they are clearly moving away from fan service and more toward monetization to ensure a game gets beat to death with pay for dlc and other content and that way they can put forth half the effort for double the payoff.
---
I dont mind people 'trying' new things to make money in business.  What I hate is when that business circles the wagons and tries to get the few remaining good studios to jump on the monetization train, that way EA, Ubisoft and their ilk won't need to change their model because if EVERYONE follows that model, then there is no risk of losing business due to it because there is not an alternative.
---
I just really think, as liberal as the gaming industry claims to be politically, they function an awful lot like money-worshiping right wingers when it comes to their business model since taking back over control of Fallout after New Vegas.
---
My only hope is that in that market, there will be purists who refuse to be bought and sold and stick to making great games, not just games that are great at making money as the main and sole focus during development.
---
"only" in the sense that once I hut lvl300, I'll have 6 slots for cards  but will only be able to max maybe two
---
How many times do I have to explain this across posts... it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the games too easy. They’re trying to actually make it more challenging and actually make it fun to fight shit
---
Yeah, I have a Vampire's one but I'm looking for faster swing speed version.
---
Right, so make everything harder instead of level 40 all the time. The problem isn’t builds being overpowered, it’s that we have nothing good to fight.
---
Yeah, it happens if someone drops a survival tent in the right place to foul the a spawn location out by the road. 
---
It's kinda tricky to get the right spot tho.
---
Good on you, I don’t know anything about plan prices and I don’t care about trading them so I offer all my extra plans for free in my vendor
---
Play with new character. Survive 10 minutes. Level up. Done.
---
It should not take hours.
---
maybe, I just think there should be a method to get them untied from leveling. Because leveling the most monotonous, boring grind ever
---
I'm also a working dad and level 175 (playing since beta), I used to play 4-5 hours a day over the weekend grinding for the weekly supplies, then whenever I could during the week, now I play an hour and a half - two hours a day everyday to do the challenges and log off.  
---
I'm at 82nd place on the board now and there's around 4 -5 weeks left if Bethesda were accurate with their "Mid-September" finish date, with the level escalation I expect i'l be able to finish the board in the last week with possibly having to buy the last 3/4 squares, though i've had a couple of legendary drops this week that up my fire power so xp farming should be significantly easier, without the grind for crafting ammo afterwards.
---
Okay, I thought I tried that but found it wasn't moddable. Thinking about it now, maybe I was trying with the mining *hat* and not the helmet. I'll have to give it another go, thanks.
---
Lol I don’t share my world,besides I use to drop three nukes a day in other world
---
Username does not check out.
---
Do I can clear out most dailies in an hour and the weekly other than critical hits aren't that painful to achieve.
---
Though to be honest it doesn't phase me to not get 100% completion, but I'm mostly done and I've gotten what I wanted out of it.
---
Oh. Well I’m tier 114 in my main so that’s why I’m complaining.
---
Those are probably "Magic" weapons, there's a bug that gives certain  legendary combos an insane ammount of damage
---
Cross jetpacks is the mod your thinking of, I metioned that in the post.
---
Bethesda
---
Not gonna lie I would love Weapon Mod expansion update.
---
With adding more weapon mods that change how they behave and add more varied bonuses.
---
And some love for weapons like Gatling, auto launcher ,10mm SMG.
---
Or yeah even power fist and some crazy new mods.
---
It all should come with different model parts.
---
How do you do that?
---
maybe it's my int heavy build, and the two weekends i've had tonnes of free time on since it started... but i am a working adult and am at level 96.
---
i am sorry that you are struggling, but your generalized statement is pretty inacccurate.
---
Well just do it with another character
---
Just get the PA skin?
---
I love naming my guns 
---
My current is “Hold yer Horses” a double barrel shotgun that will 1-2 shot pretty much whatever (within reason)
---
The ability to sink those barrels has been bugged for a long time now.
---
That's his power armor not the actual person.
---
crap. I had a strategy in mind to keep making new characters,and 
---
scrap those perk cards to use on my main. I hope they make perk coins account wide. It just doesn't make sense at high levels where it takes forever to lvl up,and you must be unyielding. Good job for diversity.
---
This is a really lovely way of remembering him and I'm sure he would have loved it! Sorry for your loss and hope you're getting all the support you need at this time x
---
I'm lvl 50 and even with PTW I still can't keep up. 
---
(RL that is, I'm fine in FO76)
---
Thanks for the tip :)
---
It's loud I unpowered it n just have it as is no fire I was bothersome
---
If you play every day it's worth it.
---
Bethesda have completely sold out.  Obsidian is the new Bethesda, making the best RPG games.  Bethesda no longer cares to be Bethesda.
---
I’ve been playing one hour a day, only to complete challenges. Dailies should be made to accumulate...
---
Just hit x on the siren. The is no prompt but it turns it off and it's exactly the same. Just more quiet.
---
I run junkies commando
---
Addictions: alcohol, med-x, mentats, psycho, and overdrive.
---
Chem 
---
Perks: chem fiend 3 for double duration. 
---
The withdrawls effects are normally negated thru herd mentality mutation (+3 to specials while in a a team; PSA, u can either start ur own public team or join a random for that to kick in).
---
I only really use run berry mentats most of time because of int (xp) boost, but run  ballistic broc (alcohol; +15% ballistic damage), overdrive (+ crit damage) and psychotats (+25% damage and 15% dam redux).
---
Yes, those do stack, but MUST be taken in that order: broc, overdrive, psychotats.
---
If melee, use psychobuff instead of tats.
---
Armor: SS troubleshooters left leg, wwr; SS  troubleshooter right leg, wwr; SS VAN powered cp w/ dense mod; SS VAN weighted left arm, awr; SS VAN powered weighted right arm.
---
Weapon: je handmade, j ss dcg
---
No you need the plan that says
---
Jetpack armor torso and SS armor torso 
---
Idk why they didn't just call it the jetpack plan but that's Bethesda for you lol
---
Wait you doing lvl up challenge with rank 100+ character? No wonder you are complaining. Make a new character
---
I find myself logging on, finish the daily/weekly challenges, then logging off.  I am not exploring as much as I used to.  Sometimes I get lucky when somebody launches a Nuke or starts Encrytid, or when I friend logs on when I am on.  Other than that, on, finish challenges, off.
---
I love it. It’s the collectrons that annoy me.
---
I know this is an unpopular opinion but I like it, i am actually excited to get it
---
If you look at their history they have fixed many skins that have had similar bugs so I don’t know why you say that. Just submit the bug report.
---
I figured as much just necer looked into it. Thanks for the info.
---
Except for the embarrassment of dying cause u cant run ur build
---
Thanks.  Yes its unessecarily convoluted.  So all it all it's like 3k gold.  Sheesh
---
Angry Turtle has a good recent video on this; his super endgame build.
---
I feel you on this. I actually picked up Fo76 just 2 month prior to the legendary run and enjoyed it very much. Even subbed up since I work a lot and might only have 30 min-1 hour each night to get any gaming in. I had to make the most of my time so the tent and storage helped keep me moving forward. 
---
As soon as the run dropped though, I found it increasingly difficult to even complete dailies and fell far behind. I know that I don’t have to even participate to enjoy the game but they made it so front and center, in your face that it’s hard not to feel a sense of disappointment each and every login. I briefly considered paying my way through but snapped to my senses, doing the only thing that made me happy, no longer logging in. 
---
It’s a shame, but its a mechanic that just doesn’t work for me.
---
Do you play on Console or PC?
---
I bought a second account (on PC) for about $20 like a year and a half ago. If your PC is beefy enough to Dual Client, I consider it superior to 1st in most ways, and for the cost of like 2months of First.
---
To get loads of acid I server hop at Toxic Larry's. 3 snallygasters are right in front of you when you spawn. Kill them loot them in about 10 seconds then hop. 26 to 30 acid per hop.
---
Yeah all of my chars have multiple respecs
---
Bloodies is only good if u run in PA tank or full unyielding glass cannon...besides, they about to nerf bloody to hell
---
I hate those bomb creatures especially in  final fantasy 10. So annoying to deal with. 
---
kamikaze is actually inspired by  krieg from borderlands 2. if you haven’t played that game hes a bandit type character that has a skill for thrown dynamite around the map and then exploding when his skill ends. 
---
Honestly i am hopeing they will fine toon legendary perks once they get into the game. I feel like legendary perks should split into two categories. More advanced versions of cards allready in the game and ones that open up new play styles. 
---
It would help alleviate the lack of build flexibility. draws in new and old players. It also gives us something to do besides the endless grind. Could also be used to make use of some less desirable legendary effects  like berserker and suppressor
---
Yup it's all about personal preference.  Not like theres a dps meter lol.
---
I'm pretty sure Jeff said somewhere (might have been at QuakeCon, might have been somewhere else - haven't been able to track it down) that they didn't want people walking out of the vault and being superpowered right away with a bunch of perks, so I think the current implementation is what they plan on going with.
---
I thought they did patch it, I can't get them to spawn in the middle any more. Is it the same with the survival tent at that specific place or has it changed do you know? Maybe I'm just doing it wrong now
---
So they should put in multiple ways to give feedback rather than just one way.
---
And those all require doing the same thing, filling in information. Isn’t much different that just putting it all on the forums.
---
You're not alone, homey G. One shot One kill is my mantra in RPGs and the nerf, the artificial 1/3-of-their-hit-bar-per-hit damage cap **really** makes me want to just uninstall. I FUCKING HATE bullet sponges. HATE HATE HATE.  It isn't difficult, it isn't immersive, it's just tedious and grindy.
---
I doubt I'll be able to tolerate more than an hour of the nerf before I say 'fuck this shit' and go back to TTW/4.
---
I do a scan on the horizon and see if my crosshair turn red cause that means there's a hostile where I'm pointing at. If you are wearing a ghillie, that means no armor and you can die insta. If you are on PC tho there's a chance that was a hacker
---
I bought both the display case and fridge, very happy with both of them.
---
Same. I just wanted to look at protectron and boom . YOU HAVE installed tracker. Like heck, you can't even take it out and put to different model.
---
I was very disappointed
---
If your on PC, then you were screwed before you enter 51
---
That's an unpopular opinion? I thought the white version looked awesome. I mixed the head and legs with the rest being Inferno paint from NW and it looks amazing on my X-01 armor.
---
I started playing this game a few months back. Read some guides and said to myself, not going to dabble with mutations, radiation and chems. As somewhat of a role-player I could not see myself connecting with a character that would "abuse" chems or glow in the dark all the time. I did start using a few mutations, some are just too good to ignore.   
---
Then the Legendary Run came along. My dailies started to auto-complete when I logged on. I missed so much SCORE points because of that bug. Even today, I still log off 10 minutes before reset, 4 out 9 dailies were auto-completed. I caved, deleted one of my alts and turned it into a bloodied build. It is weird to one shot scorchbeasts and rack in xp that quickly, but a hidden waste barrel emitting radiation or a mole-rat with rubberbanding health can make me panic.  
---
When Bethesda fixes the dailies, I will stop playing my bloodied character. Now I just need it to unlock one reward each day. Have to get ahead of that other spaceship on the map :) Wonder what would happen when Bethesda limits bonus xp from Intelligence, like the way Charisma and vendors are capped.  
---
Funny is fact, bloodied weapons are plenty and cheap to buy from other players. Guess those were duped the most?
---
Yeah. I had once so much fun playing ESO, until I got flamed by doing shit DPS, so I started to look up builds and turned my character into a melting machine with top gear.. and guess what? it completely killed my joy, now I don't play it anymore xD Never make that mistake again, so I took it easy with F76 lol
---
It's not patched you just have to put in near the second hole in the wall. Try some other people events and see where they put it. I didnt get 15000 steel by not using exploits.
---
Apparently people hate it, we are in the minority
---
I play daily.  I have the annual subscription, totally worth it.  I’ll pay it again if I’m still playing daily.  
---
For me, it’s the scrap box and the survival tent that totally change the game.  I rarely use the private server.  The Atoms are nice now that they don’t hand them out daily.
---
I wish I had gaming friends. Been since the PC battlefield 1942 days. Good times on vent.
---
I really dont get people who chase others across the map because they dared to take a workshop. If I ever go to a workshop it's just for the junk, and if they dont have anything I just leave and let them have it.
---
One shot should not be the norm.
---
Season passes are definitely made for younger people and the unemployed. They're made to extract money from a few select people.
---
That wasn't a hot take, that was just... describing the business model.
---
I play console
---
My comment is about doing things for fun vs only doing it to receive something.
---
Again, if you aren’t having fun, why push yourself through it?
---
Meh. You'll be disappointed with the chicken coop. It just makes fertilizer and you can barely see the chicken that hides in the coop. Its not like you get chickens running around your camp or anything cool like that.
---
White springs.  Nearby and just north west of snake on the map
---
I like to nuke for flux on my private server then all the fatties are for me to kill. I nuke fissure prime on public though.
---
I did it yesterday so it still comes up
---
just creatures that drop acid.
---
Personally I think the legendary perk card system should be something to reward high level players, not ANOTHER grind. i think a simple way to fix it would be to act like the regular perk card system (no fucking points) and every 25 or so levels after level 50 you can rank up or choose a new legendary perk card. For example I’m level 268, I’d be able to choose or rank up 8 perk cards. It seems so simple to me lmao. Of course I may have missed something but I do believe it should depend on your level &amp; not pre-existing perk cards.
---
I just paid for a month (first timer). Its worth it solely for the atoms if you want something in the shop. I haven't paid Bethesda a red cent since release in 2018 and have been playing pretty regularly since Wastelanders, so I figured I would show some support.
---
The game should be designed in a way that services the players, not in a way that generates cash.
---
As far as can recall most lamps and other items that need power but don't need to be wired don't subtract from the amount of power from a generator.  A three-power small generator can provide power to a large number of unwired lamps and still have three-power to give to wired devices.  
---
It would be nice if FO76 "remembered" your last settings, though.
---
Helmlock holes is a workshop that has 3 acid extractors though
---
I have this with stabilized stock. recoil is still insane but its my backup carry piece. love it!
---
They should increase the amount of atoms earned when reaching a rank awarding them, or have it so every rank after 100 awards atoms so there’s a grind for after the fact.
---
I want to see unique weapon skins that change the whole visual appeal and not some generically themed retexture. A Deathclaw hand as a skin for the gauntlet like in Fallout 3, the original Fallout 3 Powerfist as a skin for the Power Fist to name a couple.
---
Unique end game weapon plans at the end of the run, like a prototype Tesla rifle or anti-armour sniper rifle that needs specific in-game junk and legendary modules so not everyone is running a potentially new meta in a week.
---
More practical furniture, like the kitchens we see everywhere (most notably the player home in Fallout 4 as an example) with skins, like a vault-tec, raider and BoS style kitchen that works as a functional cooking station.
---
Universal armour skins, for example you could wear SS armour for the best defence and legendary affects without sacrificing your fashion sense by allowing universal skins so your SS armour can look like leather or metal or combat armour with all the upgrades like shadowed and reinforced as skins on top of the skins they already have.
---
When interior camps become a thing, assuming it’s based on pre-made cells rather than building rooms piece by piece like the Vault Tec Workshop from Fallout 4; have new interior cells to choose from like a vault, bunker, cave, BoS outpost, Enclave Safehouse, Raider Hideout and so on
---
awesome thanks
---
You do know that a perked player against an unperked player has almost 5 times the advantage right? Most players don't like being matched against other players that have 5 times the effeciency.
---
Idk if i gotta spell it out for you, but not only do you do less than half the damage they do, but they do more than double your damage.
---
Does it have complete fall damage nullification as well? Haven't played fo4 in over 3 years so can't remember the name
---
Fair points!
---
I can confirm this is true. I thought there was some kind of monster attacking this guys camp and looked all around for a while before realizing it was the totem... all the way up on their roof. It looks cool but it's incredibly loud and just keeps on making noise if someone leaves it active. You can turn it off by interacting with it.
---
I think the other commenters are talking about when they set up a camp, use their materials, set up machines and then as soon as they've done that, a griefer kills them for it and takes everything they've done. Sure its not awful if you have a lot of materials stored away and it doesn't make a dent to make them again, but for a lot of players that don't have FO1st so can't stock up, it's a real kick in the gut. So I think it's justified to be mad over.
---
Bethesda. No. This would make the game less enjoyable for me.
---
yes because it's an exploit and you arent suppoused to have it.
---
I used to do the hemlock workshop but that workshop (and all workshops) weren’t worth the trouble. 
---
For acid I go to the Flooded Trainyard (East of Watoga) and kill the six snallyghasters there. 
---
I basically only go to that place these days but if you need more acid you can include the crickets from Tanagra Town. 
---
My runs are basically:
---
West Tek - collect all the weapons and scrap them with the scrapper perk on. 
---
The Burrows 
---
Flooded Trainyard 
---
Lost Home (for bobbles/magazines and to buy stuff from the wandering trader) 
---
Back to West Tek
---
Remember to put your camp near a train station because you can sell stuff there and having a option to go there for no caps is very good early on when you don't have thousands of caps at any time
---
I hear you man. I get at least an hour or so each morning before telework. That's been enough to do most of the dailys.
---
Not really. Just alt f4 game when there is 1 minute or 2 left.
---
 Then log in back in 5 minutes. I do that everytime and it works. All dailies available.
---
You can get some strength perks back by running only the first level of the damage buff perks instead of all three. Also, there's the chemist backpack mod you can get if you have friendly raider rep that does the same thing as the traveling pharmacist perk.
---
Yes! Like weightless steel that can’t be dropped upon death
---
I hate you. But I forgive you because you are awesome.
---
What’s the game-breaking bug in FO4?
---
When it's began I was assumed it's like the majority of the games that you only have to take around half of the times in total, but just like the Atlas, they somehow assumed people can do every single challenges daily and can also keep doing it for entirely 60 or 70 days(just wow). I have no idea what they are thinking about, it just kinda weird way to try to make players feel rewarded
---
Well, I gets the idea that events have no needs on 'finishable,' but they usually do because people don't like when it's not, usually when game devs wants to make things slightly exclusive they will either make something like bonus stages or make it ranked, basically just trying to avoid it's being inside the normal pools somehow so people won't feel too much of take away on chances
---
Yeah I also knowing challenges are easy, but being easy doesn't meant everyone can complete it, it just general idea about making stuffs, you can't assuming things on the edge when its involved people
---
In the end it's all earned, just can't say it's a good way to make events
---
My handmade is Quick Shooty, my Level Action is Slow Shooty and my 50. is Mega Shooty.
---
Okay thank you :)
---
All I can do is speak to my own experience with the game.
---
Oh thank you
---
I want a skin that makes you visible even when crouching because people are insane and then ask themselves why Bethesda doesn't take us seriously.
---
I think so yes! If you have the spare change in your budget and you won't miss it, go for it! 
---
I didn't see anyone mention the monthly atoms. I can't remember right now how many you get a month....1650 maybe? Instead of $1=1 atom, you get a much better price. For me the atom discount alone is worth it. I would never buy $16.50 in atoms a month. But... By getting them as part of a &lt;$10/mo subscription I'm able to buy more cool camp stuff.
---
Then there's the survival tent and the scrapbox... both are incredibly handy. Especially if you're in a pinch. I'm a hoarder so pitching the tent to scrap/store all my junk real quick is great. (Ofc the limitless junk stash is much needed) It's also essentially another free fast travel point. Keep the tent and your camp on opposite sides of the map to reduce your fast travel costs. 
---
Private servers I don't use much since Wastelanders. It was cool to feel completely alone in the wasteland, but it's different now. 🤷‍♀️ I will say it's good for claiming workshops. Claim them all if you want. 
---
I could probably live without the atoms (if I were to cancel) but the thought of canceling my subscription and losing the tent and scrapbox....nope. Nope nope.
---
I'd call it griefing when their sole purpose is to cause you grief. 99% of the time they don't care about the workshop or the resource extractors. They just want an excuse to take a cheap shot and execute you while you're unaware that anything is amiss. Then they call in their buddies to ensure it won't be a fair fight should you choose to engage. Then they just sit on the workshop, leaving the extractors wrecked and useless, until they get bored and leave.
---
That's not really in the spirit of the game. It just encourages anyone with a genuine interest in farming some resources to stay far, far away. No one gets to have this thing. You want it and we want you to not have it.
---
Source?
---
I’d say yea but not for a year unless you like only play this game lol but it’s definitely a game changer.
---
Whaaaat!? I didn't know this! What are people using it for?
---
Kids ruin everything.
---
Saw it today. Looks cool, but is too noisy.
---
I just do the challenges naturally, yes I may go out of my way to do something, but it tends to be a "gotta keep an eye out" as opposed to "well, guess I have to go do that now" and when I tire of playing, I currently have games brand new to me I can play, I started the game a bit into the season, and am now just 12/13 spaces behind Zorbo, if a grind gets to me, I'll wait a bit or take it slow
---
You know Karen?
---
juicehead's video yesterday threw up an image at one point. it's pretty cool, it's like a medievil halberd with like an arc of electricity going down the blade
---
You can get a aerial view of your surroundings without having to leave cover etc
---
Honestly I don't know I had the cheat room so I always had well over 100k health, and as such when I feel I didn't notice any health loss
---
I don't mean this in a rude way, but nobody makes you do it. You can ignore it and do what you like and still get score because those "challenges" are so easy, you get them without even trying, well maybe a few you'll have to spend like 10 mins on. If you want a specific item from the run and you think you're not getting it, I have a feeling they'll put it in atom shop after some time. yeah it's not gonna be free, but oh well. The game industry will always favour people who can spend more time and money in their game and they will never care about working people or people busy with irl, because well, it's obviously not in their interest and everybody understands this, but nobody wants to acknowledge it. I don't have the time to grind for it either, but I spare and hour or two daily to enjoy the Wasteland and get some challenges done, and I'm close to the end without even doing NW challenges (well apart from placing camp, that ones too easy to ignore). And again I'm not trying to insult you or anything, but what do you think they should do? make it 6 months long? then there will be people (there are already) complaining that they finished it and getting nothing more. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it's a race, if you can't make it, it's nobody's fault..
---
We should simply get coins based on our level, and the requirements should be lowered at that, I've been playing almost every day since wastelanders and I'm only around lvl300, that's around enough levels to get two and a half cards maxed, I think
---
Level 300 gives you six, 6 entire slots to fill. And I can only upgrade cards I three of those slots, maybe five if I want to spread some of the pojts around. And even still that leaves me with a bunch of empty stars on thaoe cards that I just have to live with until next month where I can upgrade one. Then the next two months where I can upgrade another, then the next year where I can finally max another card
---
the requirements are insane, simple as that, there's more than six cards, I dont see why maxing six should be a six year endeavor
---
Working dad of three here. I get to play from 10pm until midnight if I am lucky. Maybe a few hours on the weekend here and there. I've had 2 days auto-complete for me and I only do the easiest NW challenges. My characters are low int, but wearing Unyielding so their Int sits around 18 or so.
---
With that said, I hit Rank 97 last night, will be 100 on Tuesday. I have spent 0 Atoms on this, and I have had no trouble getting close to finishing. I spend maybe 45 minutes on these "challenges" every day. Take a picture? Buy 3 things? Eat bubblegum? Join a team? Easy. The only time consuming one has been find a bobblehead.
---
They aren't challenges, they are a check mark. And if you can't get them done in a day, then it's not Bethesda's fault, because they are making this easier every few weeks. Geez, here I go defending them... I don't mean to, but it's easy things to do everyday. 
---
I saw other people say "I only get two hours to play", well so do I. It's just not that bad
---
Like every few ranks in a season, award something like 20 or so points?
---
Good news is that based on the PTS reports you will at least be able to buy the coop for bullion after the next patch.
---
Upvote for visibility.
---
Iirc, it was by itself. There was a TG table and chairs too but I believe it was a separate purchase, not all 3 together. 
---
However I wouldn't be surprised if they brought back favorites from last Thanksgiving this year.
---
Yeah good luck on the grind, the only hard part is the wait the rest is easy
---
You can never be completely hidden. It's actually really easy to find people hiding in the bush.
---
[I wrote this up when it released ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hjizhu/heres_the_biggest_issue_with_the_score_system/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) but people just said I was either lazy or not committed enough. I’m glad people are beginning to realize how nonsensical the SCORE system is. I don’t have 2-3 hours to play every night just to cap out on dailies.
---
We don’t got the cork, that’s like the rarest material
---
Defo something I’m gonna look into then. Cheers 👍
---
Fast travel away and come back or go to back to where they spawned, sometimes they ping back there.
---
I know it's frustrating! But these tips worked for me when losing a 3* sheepsquatch turned to ash lol :) left and came back and found it
---
He has always been a PC man and he just fixed up his old PC and upgraded some parts. I don’t enjoy playing on pc. Oh my if it was cross platform i would cry.
---
we got the cork
---
"i Am A cAsUAl, sPoONfEeD mE pLz"
---
Rough. It's odd how we all cope with things. If I ever stop by and see it it's good to know the meaning behind it. Thanks for sharing that friend :)
---
I use Junkie weapons and four general damage related perk cards. Everything else is either geared towards utility (hacking, picklock, etc) or weight reduction / management; I rely on power armor for defense, coupled with the medic pump mod and a lot of stimpaks. Its a pretty relaxed way of playing, and allows interaction with most aspects of the game.
---
my quad +33% vats hit chance double barrel shotgun, call it the 2x4 (as in Two by Four). best name i came up with for a weapon in all my time playing.
---
I also have an explosive vampire's railway rifle. i call it Alucard's Steaker.
---
I’ll take your word for it
---
Crashed 3 times in less than hour. Once after I built up a workshop so I could collect acid, another during a mama Murphy event. A lil aggro here
---
yah, this one is easy to finish, but in general Fortnite for example you needed actual skills and deadicated play time (or Apex Legends').  In general I feel gaming passes suck for working adults as some require 20-40 hours a week to complete.  I think the FO76 fanbase is the biggest bunch of snowflakes, who can't even figure how to do Encrypted or keep 3 animals alive in 3 different rooms.
---
I'm not fond of the changes, especially since all the god tier weapons I had are now so weak (not even talking legacies, which aren't as good as you think) and the only weapons left that are good are the bugged weapons that might eventually get fixed (the weapons you see people taking the SBQ down in ten seconds with).
---
It's not all bad though, I think we just need to step back and look at what perks aren't worth it anymore and maybe what perks weren't worth it before but now are and maybe new type of builds will shake out that will make it not so bad. It seems to me though that they will be builds that will be easier for casual players to achieve and rely less on specific legendary weapons and armor and more on how skillful you are at choosing perks and SPECIAL.
---
Honestly this is what I hope they do with the next one.  Have all but bullion stuff early on (lunch boxes, atoms, caps, etc.).  Then make Camp items next.  So even the casual CAMP player doesn't get discouraged and can get those items.  Skins and such (and bullion)?  Make the last tier.  Those guys will go hard anyway.  This means casuals might play more with a reasonable goal, new players get a reward to let they level up easier, and hardcore players have something to aim for.
---
i already explained if they nerf the builds im quitting ive been playing since the beta and waited and watched for two years for this game to improve and its been rather evident that they dont care what real dedicated people have to say all they care about is their stupid fucking cash grab atom shop
---
this is not the right way #Bethesda you are gonna push so many more people away than you already have including myself
---
So what did everyone at Bethesda just give up on this? It takes y’all that long to roll out an update? And you’re wondering why you’re losing money? I’m a new player trying to progress super excited I got to level 20 to keep going and now I’m can’t do anything? I can’t level now. I can’t get higher level weapons. I can’t do any of that because of one silly feature that you people can’t seem to fix. Are you a bunch of toddlers distracted by your special toys? What’s the deal here? Because I’d love to know how it’s possible for you to mess something like this up. What kind of absolute ignorant team wouldn’t test out a quest they patched to make shorter? Lady whatever your name is. I like how you responded once or twice 6 days ago and then haven’t said or done anything about it since. If you aren’t going to do anything about it in a timely manner then don’t even bother responding. Everyone else here that has a job does their job. Do yours. Absolutely pathetic.
---
Yup that is why I came back excited and uninstalled on day 2 why even fucking bother with this chore?
---
I have an alt that used stealth commando as a build and does miles and miles better than my rifleman/melee tank build but both are happily viable
---
I‘ll join you guys then. Just unlocked it and I kinda fell for that bulky piece of steel.
---
I actually feel bad for working adults now. I'm sorry that all of you have struggles with this game bqsically becoming ea.
---
I’m the same way with doors. Every time I fast travel tomy camp or log in to a world the doors open
---
They should, this will only make things harder for everyone. I hear what you're saying, I just think a buff to other effects should be a better idea.
---
Ikr! This is exactly what I do and it's kinda annoying. Why not just display how much you have.. They made it better and the same time they made it even worse, because now you have a big chance to misclick and buy instead of selling or vice versa. also the numbers of the ammo are very inconvenient.
---
Lol saw it standing right on the outside as the nuke came it , i was just getting up and was like who the heck nuked WS??
---
🙂
---
Tuesday
---
Tuesday.
---
Don’t forget Encryptid
---
If you delete or move your camp it will not show the ammo factory in your stored items, but it will still be counted against your storage budget which you cannot get rid of. The only way around this is to put in a ticket which will get you banned by Bethesda, or delete the character.
---
Okay thank you. I know Beth said they’d enable it in the next couple weeks but didn’t know if it had happened yet
---
Lol...yeaaaaaaa...no....the entire fallout community speaks, but noone listens
---
They lowered it to 150 million when we had given 160...
---
Personal cool down...you should hit a different silo
---
It is reduced, but not as hard as Vault 94 (where most mobs gave like 11XP apiece). For level 100 super mutants I was getting ~85 XP whereas a normal level 100 PTS super mutant nets me around ~287 XP. Not an insane XP farm but not too bad, and completing the Op does give you a pretty big dump of XP.
---
Lol imagine downvoting
---
Bigger hit pools do not mean more challenge. It's not more difficult to kill something just because you have to shoot it a few more times. It just means more tedium and more ammo grinding.
---
I rebalanced Fallout 4 by going into the GECK and changing fDiffMultHPToPCN and fDiffMultHPByPCN from the default value of 1 to 6. This means I can one shot basically anything this side of a deathclaw. **It also means anything this side of a deathclaw can oneshot me right back.** Pistols, shotguns, pipe guns suddenly became viable beyond level ten or so(My desire to make this change came from a desire to run through the game using nothing but a Colt 1911A1; it was a wild success and the first time I've ever beat **any** Fallout game as a pistolero!). No more sponginess. And the game became WAY WAY WAY harder! Before I made that plugin, all I had to do was get two pieces of clothing weaved with Level 5 Ballistic and all challenge in the game exited stage right. After I made that change not even power armor made me into a walking tank. I actually had to think about my engagements, had to plan and be tactical. I couldn't just waltz into the center of the enemy camp with a gun balanced on my dick and cackle like Joker while everything died around me, because if I tried that I died within seconds. Whereas before I made that change, I was basically Heavy Weapons Guy in a shooting gallery, afterwards clearing a place made me feel like I channeled John Wick. And exploring the wastes **was actually dangerous**, because if I didn't have my head on a swivel(which happens often as I get distracted by 8 Bit Hits in my pipboy an awful lot haha) I'd get blindsided and oneshotted by something with a less-than-palatable disposition. Yanno, exactly as the lore states the wasteland is!
---
Fallout 4 came alive when I buffed damage 600 percent. Try it sometime. But make sure you do it in both directions, because if you do it in only one direction it just isn't fun.
---
Another side effect of this is that propensity for Raiders to come at you guns blazing even when you're so high level that you've basically reached what qualifies for FO4 endgame actually makes sense, because they can still kill you without too much fuss if you're careless.
---
If they wanted to make Fallout 76 harder the correct move is to drastically buff outgoing damage, not nerf it, then match those changes to the incoming damage as well. With a little fine tuning combat in 76 could come alive just like it did when I tweaked 4. With the right fine tuning, such a change would enable playstyles like mine which favor sneaking and sniping, but also enable playstyles that favor drugs and fists, or power armor and miniguns.
---
The most frustrating aspect about the nerf isn't even the effect itt'l have on the gameplay itself, but that it's *not even addressing why we wanted balance tweaks in the first place*. The complaint for the longest time has been 'BETH PLS BLOODIED OP PLS NERF' because it was basically the only viable build for the longest time(IIRC Junkie's comes close but Bloodied lets you basically oneshot everything while everyone else has to deal with sponges). Not only does this nerf make gameplay more tedious and combat less fun than it already had been made, *but it also fails to address the imbalance in builds so Bloodied builds are still going to be the optimal way to play*.
---
To sum it up, all this nerf does is make enemies more spongy without actually addressing how Bloodied is so fucking OP that it's generally considered the only viable build. In all likelihood I'll make it about an hour into this patch on the live server before I say 'fuck this shit' and go back to the Capitol Wasteland.

1...
---
A ton of crickets in a clump. You can run up there in like 2 minutes and score near 100 acid.
---
Usually used by bush wookies to check their surroundings
---
For what its worth, your 100% vulnerable when in photo mode
---
Huh. So what’s the point ?
---
Wow. Ok. That is going to be quite the grind. Thanks for the update!
---
It already took my key card though and I’ve only got one left and I was going to use that one for an actual queen .
---
Kinda like every online game ever.
---
Sigh.
---
You know, most of our builds have a functional purpose, but this is pure expressive art, really lovely. I'm sorry for your loss, this is a perfect way to memorialize a fallout fan.
---
Rofl....he is using it a "is or is not" view point....has nothing to do w the gay community....ROFL
---
To make sure we got the rewards
---
Stealth suit is good protection on its own, SS armour with radiation resist perks and rad x will let you survive a couple minutes maybe? Legendary perk that allows you to resist and drain radiation should be a game changer for full health builds
---
I won't deny this game has more faults than not, but I've had fun playing it with my wife, and honestly, that's good enough for me.
---
Besides, I got the Power Armor helmet edition for £30 - significantly less than asking price (and TBF I just wanted the helmet) and my wife's copy cost a tenner, so I'd still say I'm quids in.
---
I also don't play this like a job. We play when we fancy it, but most times we just chill together. But it serves its purpose when we want it to.
---
Why? It’s a valuable skill. How else will I know if my arm is clipping through my port-a-potty?
---
100%this. 🤷‍♀️
---
Even worse when the few times you do play the challenges auto complete, where Bethesda support don't just actively refuse to help, they'll also outright ignore you if you report multiple cases of it!
---
Sorry for your loss fellow dweller. Take care
---
I work 45-50 hours a week with a one year old and I've hit 93 without any expense just playing around an hour or two a day before everyone else wakes up in the morning. Obviously there are days where I get more time in but I generally don't agree with this. It's like anything else you get what you put in and it's pretty reasonable to design a string of free add ins to favor those who put more time / effort in
---
Yeah, I did this like 10 minutes ago, and every wave I saw appeared in a group. I grabbed a grenade launcher from a dead one and just started blasting.
---
They totally suck on the Public Test Server so that's probably a safe bet.
---
so not worth it
---
So far I’ve only named my shotgun and fixer: Violator and Reorganizer... still trying to name my lever action
---
Things that are timed, are timed for a reason. If there were no restrictions, people would just blast through it all in a day, then be right back here on Reddit to complain of boredam.
---
I see a lot so many people complain about no challenges, I'm lvl 133 on my current character &amp; lvl 136 on another &amp; I still haven't been able to complete Project Paradise fully because nobody will do it. It's too hard solo.
---
Lol. Your comment made my day. Best I've seen so far xD
---
As a matter of principle, you should boycott the Double Score Weekend.
---
Yup.. ever since patchy 21 super lag and crashes. I can't wait for patchy 22 lol nerfed damage and loading screens with commercials lol nerf 76...
---
Same, but I didn't do the NW dailies, and I am one spot ahead of the alien.
---
While I don't agree with OP this change could push me toward a different game. Farming for adhesive and aluminum constantly for arrows is not fun
---
No connection issues for me.
---
It's worth a try, what if they actually did listen? With enough people it might happen
---
several?
---
Well, I’ve been playing for over 6 hours and I’ve not earned one rank.
---
Bethesda said it would take up to two hours to rank up while playing season one?
---
So no progression for me tonight.
---
Bkew my gold on plasma caster and mods...kinda regretting that now.  Saving for jet pack now
---
Yes we got it. Obviously fudged numbers, but it says unlocked.
---
Yea its justified to be mad when ya get your stuff taken, ain't denying that. I was talking about the griefers who chase people all over the map after already taking their stuff. Whenever I do workshop PvP I try to make it a lesson to the person to be ready for worse people, and to get some bonus junk, which I like to think of as giving a lesson in stash prioritization. PvP isn't the only way to lose junk, it's always better to take somethin out of your stash to put scrap in its stead.
---
What is an alt ? Do you mean a blueprint ?
---
I have the electro fireplace and everytime I server hop it's turned off. I used to think somebody was fucking with me but now I realise its set off at default.
---
But how did he know whether they were doing it to be a dick or doing it for the workshop itself?
---
I got an ex for double barrel I call my boomstick
---
We'll see
---
I bought the pack and it’s awesome. You should buy it also
---
Next time you go to that silo, and are not on cooldown, you won't need to use a keycard again.
---
https://i.imgur.com/Q8hHpdD.jpg
---
Bethesda lowered the amount to make it so that the award was unlocked.
---
You just never take it off.  Even if you die, you’re all good.  Most queen fights aren’t in a rad zone and honestly I still won’t stop being a bloodied when/if the nerf from the PTS comes.  Beth can’t stop me.
---
Okay but that completely ignores people that pvp to claim the workshops for the use of the workshop. I've killed people to claim workshops I actually used before.
---
Lore wise there wouldn't be huge behemoths yet. There hasn't been enough time for them to grow large enough.
---
I love watching the Whitesprings blow up. Sometimes affects my playtime but I'm also not playing last thing at night currently either.
---
But my camp overlooks Whitesprings and has a seating area up top specifically to watch it get nuked. Camp is just north of the Mountainside Bed and Breakfast
---
Are you 100% sure ? Like it’s not server specific ?
---
You also get to keep all of the outfits and emotes too
---
Dude if I passed away and any of my friends did this for me I would watch out for them for the rest of there lives to make sure everything goes as well as I can. You are a great friend and I am so sorry for your loss. If you are on Xbox and ever need someone to play with let me know and I’ll dm you my gamer tag.
---
I hear you. I bought the game in Beta, played a while in a love/hate relationship, walked away for a few months, came back for a few months and now, we broke up again. About 2-3 months ago. I am playing FONV, FO4, and Skyrim. The best part? I don't feel like I am being trolled 24/7 by the game. In a few months, I will go back again. Rinse and repeat.
---
bulk and sell scrap. don't be sentimental and get rid clothing that you are not using. that .1 will add up over time. I had to sell or scrip unique legendary quest rewards. you do not need   
---
a lot of food, water. stimpacks, or rad medicine since it is common so feel free to sell it. If you found out you sold too much by mistake go to low level areas to get some more for a supply run and then continue on. Don't bulk all your scrap if you are not selling it. bulking could make it weigh more.
---
Kill people and take their loot
---
It should have been frogs instead of chickens. I gotta make my Brahmin suffer an existential crisis to get enough milk for my donuts, lemme do the same to a box of frogs.
---
Hey, Copper ain't cheap. I found a workshop with 5 popped down.
---
Plasma Cartridges are Plasma Cartridges, and I needs em to go zap zap real good.
---
Though I am sitting on a Copper Extractor now and doing it the slow way.
---
Maybe its a you problem and acting like a karen puts you in the spotlight.
---
Yeah, I came back at beginning but the SCORE disheartened me as I have only so much limited time to play.
---
Stunning build mate!
---
sorry.  
---
Main - the main character you play the game with on your account.
---
The game allows up to 5 characters per account.  The other four accounts are referred to as "alts", or alternative characters.  You can use them for many reasons including getting missed challenges, running different character builds, reducing time needed for some in-game rewards, etc.
---
In this case you create an alternate character.  You can use this character and move their camp around at low cost.  The camp may be just the suitcase or a single foundation.  It would only cost a few caps to move, and you do not have to worry about you main character's camp.
---
*Vault Tec salutes you.*

Forget the behemoth and deathclaw, I want to fight a 40 foot mutant chicken or possum.

Restart your PS4. It worked for me.

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
we were always above the minimum daily delivery threshold for cork, concrete was the only one we weren't, that link will take you to the official tracker, updates the same time that daily challenges reset, and no, it is not a rick roll
---
Better yet, y show up at all...why kill...just log in and everything is automatically given to u and then u log out.....🤪
---
Maybe a giant Mirelurk King horde?
---
I installed it and it is excellent. Thanks!
---
Tnx will try better then ahah
---
Yea I believe it’s been delayed 2 times. 3 if you count the fact that it’s in the game but disabled due to “performance tweaks and additional testing” before they enable it
---
Agreed.
---
Is it bad i wanted this to have three comments, yes no and maybe? No upvotes on any.
---
To give you an idea on what you get...
---
Each month you get Atoms for cheaper than buying them.  If you likes Camp building or Skins, then that is worth it.
---
You get the scrapbox. That is worth it.
---
You occasionally get discounts/skins that look pretty cool.  But that is maybe worth it.
---
You get two emotes that people either love or hate.  For me that is another worth it.  But extremely subjective.   
---
Then you get the Tent.   If you are lower and short on caps, this is a game changer.    It comes with a bed, is free to fast travel to, has a Stash, Instrument, cooking pot and Scrapbox.   This has a lot more utility than people give it for.  Not strapped for caps and can fast travel?  You have a mobile scrapbox/stash/cookery/bed/instrument.   
---
So you get overemcumberrd from your junk?  Easy scrapping.  Boosts for Well Rested/no food/Well tuned gone?  Well you are covered.   
---
The tent is almost, maybe even better than the Scrapbox.   Especially at lower levels.   
---
For me, worth it.   I want atoms, I want unlimited junk, I want a tent, I want to do an annoying dance.  And I want NCR Ranger uniform.  Others?  Maybe not.   Base it off of what you expect for the money.
---
As someone who gets to play 5-10 hours a week at absolute max, yeah it’s all bullshit.
---
they lowered concrete, but pretty sure they didn't cork
---
Launching the nukes and killing the Scorch Queen means you "won" the game!?
---
I only started playing since wastelander edition, but I was surprised that they had taken out all the PVP "raiding" stuff I had heard about. Which is fine, since "raid culture" is mentally/emotionally rough after a while.
---
The problem is the intial design of Fallout 76 was to be like "Rust" or "Conan Exiles", where PVP raiding would substain players in a cycles of aquiring and then "losing" stuff? 
---
Your going thru the same emotions someone on a Conan Exiles PVE server goes thru when they have collected everything... 
---
I wonder if we can turn PVP base raiding back in if you have a private server? It would be interesting to have a persistent server like that...
---
The game's already sponge city as it is. how the fuck is it going to be *less* spongy when they've nerfed damage output across the board?
---
I'll give it a try when the patch drops but I'm not confident I'll make it more than an hour before the sponginess makes me say 'fuck this shit I'm going back to the Capitol Wasteland'. I'm alraedy on the verge of doing that anyway and I'm not gonna suffer through the game getting so tedious and grindy due to the damage nerf that it takes me fucking ages to clear trash mobs.
---
Maybe things are better when you're at level 300 but when you're only at 39 and it takes 20, 30, 40 shots from a fucking fifty caliber heavy machine gun to drop something that should only take one or two .38 specials to drop...yyeeaahhhh.
---
Finally a guy I can agree with. I had my fun with my SO. And we enjoyed it alot. This is what I feel too.
---
I might be sleepy but I don't understand the connection to copper.
---
What is PTS?
---
I thought it may have been an intended feature, as all other prime plans are locked behind RNG from the queen.  Intended or not, I understand the frustration.
---
Lorewise they really dont really GAF because we can run around with Cryolators.
---
This actually happens with every power w/50cal yours is just a little bigger
---
Nope
---
I don't really understand the freeze mechanics much as I've never done one. But would it be possible to freeze her with the Cryolater then maintain the freeze with a cryo bow/crossbow? 
---
It might be a cheaper way to do it.
---
Because the devs are lazy as shit at this point and just make everything as grindy as possible to keep FO1st subs.
---
Even though it's both gamepass?
---
You shut your damn mouth!
---
The public test server you can access if you play on PC
---
Tedious is the right word.
---
They would just inflate the numbers to meet the goal....
---
we had approx 160 by the end of day three, at the rate cork went we would have gotten over 200 million by the end of day 4
---
The public test server, the latest build of the game not yet live on the regular servers.
---
Copper, lead and steel are the 3 common ammo materials
---
Pc plays with pc. Xbox plays with Xbox.
---
Did you die near a npc or your follower? Because there was a glitch where they would "pick up" your weapon off you when you died near them
---
Hey no need to get......crabby!
---
It's so rare to find someone that actually enjoyed the Raids.
---
There are a better version of them coming in the form of Daily Ops.
---
I want some of what you're on. I mean some of what you said sounds pretty cool honestly.
---
I mean, 2 of the 4 Bullion plans are not only locked behind the rep grind, they’re untradeable. I’ve got multiples of every Prime plan at this point, because I have alts; only my Main has actually learned them. I can sell them (or give!) to others. Can’t do that with bullion. 
---
And how crazy is it that they give you a plan for a mod, but not the ammo? Like, if they can make the mod that uses the ammo, they have to be able to make the ammo too.
---
Plus the Ultracite arrow plans ARE taught by the bow mods (of course, there’d be no other way of obtaining them if it wasn’t)
---
Jesus christ....this game is not meant to be easy mode. 
---
Not to mention...the servers can barely keep up with 3 nukes or multiple meat piles....and now u want the servers to work extra hard to remember the weights that come in and out of a stash..or imagine the processing power need for the junk stash...
---
Let's worry about fixing the basic bugs now ...not add more crashes and disconnects because u can manage ur shit and want to horde everything in the game
---
The day before Wednesday.
---
 Plasma Cartridges cost 12 Copper Scrap per 30 without ammosmith (Im level 22 on this character, so I cant get the card yet.)
---
 It is much easier to get ammo through the ammo factory for a low level, than it is to try and farm copper ore and acid (especially without super duper).
---
 I'm currently rotating through 4 seperate pistols as Im running a gunslinger (10mm, .44, Laser, and Plasma)
---
 Despite spreading my ammo consumption among 4 seperate guns, I still find it hard to keep up with ammo demands.
---
It's been seen that weps were disappearing during some events. If at all possible, paint them to keep them from dropping accidentally upon death.
---
I know? I'm sorry i still don't understand what you're trying to tell me xD We were talking about glitched ammo and now materials?
---
Whales play Fallout 76?
---
This has never happened to me in 2k hours. Not saying it couldn't, but I'd be willing to bet you had an atom shop skin on it and it got deleted on an accidental drop or something like that.
---
Does pc gamepass play with Steam?
---
Good description of the PTS experience.
---
Sounds like fun, do they still die if you look at them?
---
New Vegas had giant versions of most enemies, you just had to know where to look for them and it was pretty damn cool.  I would scour the entire map to find a 40 foot squirrel lol
---
"**Millennialism** (from  millennium, Latin for "a thousand years") or chiliasm (from the Greek  equivalent) is a belief advanced by some religious denominations that a  Golden Age or Paradise will occur on Earth prior to the final judgment  and future eternal state of the "World to Come"."
---
I'm more interested in what you meant than how we hit the goal (Suspiciously).
---
I picked up a vampires ffr cryolator in a trade recently. I think I’ll bring it along next time I fight ol’ queeny
---
I've seen them. They're way less cool then the coordinated mania of going section by section through vault 94. I like the ops, with weird mutated creatures and stuff. But they're not the raids
---
Yup! And Bethesda launcher
---
Working dad with same build that plays only when the kids go to bed for about 1-2 hours.  I finished the run a few weeks ago.  It takes commitment and focus.
---
I go back to work next week and won't be able to do season 2 if they continue with the dailies as-is. It's only an hour or two a night but sometimes that's just not possible every single day. 
---
I haven't missed any challenges (no NW but never got the auto-complete) since the start and hit the repeatable XP a few times a day (building team, cranberry relish, high INT, etc.) and I'm STILL not done. 
---
I am glad they're making some stuff unlockable with the gold bullion. I don't care about most of the rewards but I always love the CAMP stuff.
---
2...
---
If they made them even smaller it would actually be worse, so it's not a terrible idea really.
---
When a 40 foot chicken looks at you you're the one who ends up dying. Even the SBQ would know her place in the presence of such a monster.
---
Ah okay, like that. Now I get it. But you can produce all those types of ammo in the ammo factory and later get the raiders ammo machine that can also produce that. however there's no way to get 2mm EC apart from crafting, buying or finding, and they're pretty rare. Its kinda weird, it's not an explosive ammo, it falls under energy ammo and yet you can't make it with those machines.
---
You can buy it form other players
---
The idea that all participants should be rewarded, and all should receive prizes.
---
Oh okay. I guess that's cool. Okay I guess I will just download the game on my pc then.
---
Fair comment. I will.
---
I tend to avoid packs the first time around, but I am considering it nevertheless.  What do you think of the sound?  There seem to be complaints about it.
---
Sorry. It’s a bit of a bummer when friends are on a diff platform.
---
Was it annoyingly noisy from afar as well?
---
Cargo shorts!
---
Does anyone smoke weed in this thread?
---
Let’s bring back the Red Death from Far Harbor why not ;)
---
That's a mentality that started with Baby Boomers though.
---
"Everyone should have a car and a home and a high paying job, etc."
---
The reason you blame millennials is because they tried to apply that mentality to their kids. Kids didn't want participation rewards, their PARENTS did.
---
Thank you so much man, that means a lot to me. I often think about how he would react to all of the changes in fallout, he always had a positive attitude which helped me see things in a different light. Thank you for the offer too. I usually run by myself, I don't as much as I used to but I'll let you know
---
Do magic weapons still work in PTS?
---
You can use xbox or PS4 controller on PC you know.... :-)
---
That's sounds terrifying what platform are you on?
---
This drives me nuts, I've been killed and almost killed a few dozen times at player vendors these last few weeks.  Most of the time they get nothing, but every once in a while, I'll lose part of a days haul because im otw to base. Loke today, just a few minutes ago, which I'm here venting.
---
This craps getting absurd now, zero repercussions for whats effectively griefing, then theft.  I WISH there was something I could actually do in response.  Bethesdas reporting system is assinine, make a report....but you also need to play 20 questions via an email link within days, or it was pointless.  It's like being griefed, and then griefed by the police.  
---
I have a garbage build, and play in no-pvp, but the amount I've wished I could auto grenade or mini nuke these guys houses apart without forcing myself into a lose-lose via pvp is starting to really piss me off.  I legit want to cause suffering (Digitally) on these folks.  Not like I can just plop a nuke on them, thats an huge investment of time that gives them plenty of notice to just log out.
---
Perk points stop at 149? What about the coins needed for legendary perks
---
Stash is good, learn to manage ur waste better
---
Loot is good, economics 101, more of something there is, the less it's worth. That's the reason caps r worthless
---
You know, some of us are on vacation or in other cities due to work sometimes. But I guess we just have to manage our time better around bullshit FO76 chores...
---
You gotta live with hacked weapons then :-)
---
He said he has a copper extractor spot.
---
Making ammo himself, not exploiting. Lol
---
Okay so you were in a ghilie suit which means you had no armor so yes getting one shot is a very real possibility. “Completely hidden” in a bush even though you will make the crosshairs turn red if an enemy moves over your bush. Stop blaming Bethesda for your terrible gameplay
---
Easy way to balance the game is make it so all the low hp high damage buffs don’t stack easy fix
---
Once there was a time when the devilish cupcake pan made pure cane sugar from the toenail clippings of quarter round stock. The funny thing is fluid is like rotten tongues ripped from the tile of uncle John's rooftop. Along came apples who dug into the cement with cotton picked from vaping cats who all knew what Karen fed them.
---
I didn't even know there was a event thing. I thought they were just random team things. I guess I should pay attention more.
---
Sorry dude I didn't see the notification. Thanks again:) It's pretty basic, I don't have the eye for creative camp design like a lot of the people on this sub so that means a lot.
---
That's how I like to see it. Joe was a massive gamer, it was a great passion for him so a memorial on a game seems to fit him the best and the bonus is it'll be stored as data for a long time to come
---
Good to know it can be unpowered.  That lets me not worry about the noise.  Thanks for mentioning that.
---
Wait, people managed to gather 160 **million** *cork*?
---
Unleash some explosive bait if it’s not patched.
---
Sounds like someone needs to make his/her own modded world...this is crazy talk.
---
Never happened to me on my ps4 or now xbox. That would suck.
---
Edit: hey wait... It did happen when I was like a level 10 on ps4 way back when at the mama food processing event. Crazy.
---
Agreed with OP on vault 94 raids
---
Figuring out the puzzles was a lot of fun, and once you got good at the raids, you could make a lot of profit in regards to ammo from the bulk ammo scrap
---
I have my vault 94 emote and gold 94 icon to remind of those good adventures
---
Looks like FO76 is going the BDO route instead of releasing actual content.
---
Yeah but do i really want to spend the money on another PC? And make a new fallout character? No. Plus my couch is comfy :)
---
 Nope just played 5 hours no crashes
---
You need to repost this on Beth's PTS forum to get visibility.
---
Oh my... That is nuts :'D well I hope the reward will be worthy.
---
Oh okay. Well I have lead extractor in my camp too, so I make my ammo as well, because even non glitched workshop can't help me with those damn 2mm
---
Please find help
---
More weeklies, less daylies.
---
I play in bed, gaming laptop :-)
---
It sucks for me because I'm level 481 and I opened all my perk packs without knowing they get burned if you already have everything. I've also swapped my build so many times over the years (its how I entertained myself to keep playing the game). So if I had to guess I would say I've lost 300+ perk cards.
---
Thursday?
---
Nah nah nah...nah nah
---
I just want that damn chicken coop
---
You can also plug up your computer to your TV monitor and just get a wireless controller. That way you can sit on your couch while playing.
---
It does suck about the atoms/cosmetics not being transferable.
---
It was more on the fact that you would expect gamepass to be one server with xbox. We both have ps4 but he doesn't want to buy the game.
---
Same here. He had a pretty unique perspective and I'd love to hear his thoughts on this game. He never got around to getting it but I feel like I'm playing it for him in a weird way haha. 
---
That means a lot to me, I've said it a few times already but I wish I could thank people eloquently
---
That's definitely not the Meatspin video I remember from years back...
---
Also pork card packs are legendary coins if they stick to their bullshit idea.
---
There is a headpiece to the outfit? I had no idea.
---
Y'all have been such a great help, thank you so much.
---
They've also moved the map around. It's mildly disorienting, and it seems like they've expanded the flooded section of the GECK chamber.  
---
Still, while I do prefer the raid, it's at least nice to go back inside again.
---
Pay to play is pay to play...you were surprised?
---
O.O
---
Ooooo even comfier!!
---
Start a new character just for this challenge. Levelling from 1-2, 2-3 will be much quicker.
---
Ahhhh that is true.
---
Thank you so much for the feedback, it helped a ton.
---
I appreciate it! Fallout 4 was one of the first games we played together. I mean we took turns but he got me into it. I feel like he would've liked something like this
---
God that annoys me. I want my cozy log cabin to be warm, dammit.
---
If the nerf comes in the game and  I have to make another build I’ll cancel 1st and I’ll play another game
---
It was the cork faerie, she answered our prayers!
---
This probably the best thing I've read today. 🤣🤘
---
Ditto
---
Same here. I have an instigating double barrel that one shots the most common baddies, the ghouls and scortched and that's good enough for me. My armour is just stats I like to have like AP bonuses since I'm addicted to my SS jetpack, weapon weight reduction, things like that.
---
I wouldn't mind trying bloodied since everyone can't shut up about it, but I'm too casual of a player to micromanage. It just doesn't sound fun.
---
There’s a video on how to earn the daily in 6 minutes with a new character.
---
Do Whitespring then West Tek, pretty much a guaranteed level up for each run, doesnt take long at all.
---
don't worry practically everything is gonna scale to your level soon so hopefully you find it less challenging and more enjoyable.
---
Well like someone said, making a new character helps because it’s faster at low levels + you can run scrip through them. Also, try like west tek, burrows, glassed caverns betwwen events. Tons of xp and some legendaries. That gets grindyntoo but if you haven’t done the cycle yet it’s very fun for a week or so.
---
As someone else mentioned - use another character. 
---
SCORE is account wide, not per character.
---
4 disconnects now. Some days I got no luck
---
Lmao what, I didn’t realise inventory management was supposed to be the hard part. Bethesda created a problem, one that doesn’t exist in any of their other games, and are selling the solution. It’s not good game design because it remedied by paying them extra money. Idk if ur always a rude lil cunt when you reply to people, it was just a suggestion in case Bethesda were interested in remedying some of the blatant anti-consumerism they have implemented. Sorry if you were offended by it :^3
---
In addition to what u/Choov323 stated, there is some [good info in the comments on this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/iawzar/the_legendary_run_is_so_unfair_for_working_adults/) to increase intelligence thus increasing XP that reduces the time for leveling.
---
For simple leveling I, too, just run a low-level alt and take over a workshop like Tyler County Dirt Track.
---
Look into the chemist backpack mod.
---
Thank you so much, that really means the world to me:) it's been very difficult but I have a good friends circle and they've helped a lot
---
Honestly, Bethesda should let the community fails some challanges. If we get accustomed to passing everything, we'll stop trying and start expecting handouts.
---
Are you boosting your xp? Intelligence? Boosts are the key.  From food, chems, lunch boxes or public building teams you gotta learn to boost.
---
I tip my hat to you.  
---
I simply couldn't bring myself to kill all those ants for the emote. It was just too much.
---
Oh yeah, been there too. One time it exploded and flew away into oblivion, never found the body. The other time if exploded and fell through the texture.. I was lucky to accidentally find the right angle to loot it. Also some other legendary robots were never found. Can't even count how many legendary 3 star corpses were never found and looted by me after I spent a lot of bullets (heavy gunner here) on killing them.
---
Interior walls are needed since they patched our way to get them
---
What are you talking about? There's nothing wrong with LITS.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
If you can be on daily.
---
No. But I'm on PC and every server I join it's a laggy mess. Trying to bring up any vendor you're waiting 5-10 seconds for it to load and to kill a radroach you can get 6 shots on it from a foot away before it finally dies. Another typical day in Bethesdaland.
---
The irony is that the AoE damage from Strangler helped immensely with killing ants
---
It was a hell of a grind though
---
Only possible issue is that a low level probably couldn’t pull of a bloodied build without any perks, mutations or late game armour. They’d just be turning themselves into wet tissue paper reducing their health, only for a slight damage boost without the aforementioned buffs. The thought’s what counts, though.
---
You can get it for ammopoints, too. 300 for 15. A great way to dump your extra ammo .
---
Also 2mm EC is actually _really_ cheap. 5 lead and 15 steel for 15 rounds is pretty good.
---
Plasma cartridge costs 6 copper (not 12. My bad), 12 Lead, and 6 Plastic for 30.
---
Once i finish wastelanders, i plan on getting the gauss pistol plan. Though the legendary scrip will be difficult for me to come by.
---
I purchase the game two days ago and installed it last night. Unfortunately, I couldn't even enter the game, and I have no idea what was happened to this game.
---
Once I enter the game, it turns to black, and I was waited and waited, nothing happened. So I have to force quit.
---
Does anyone know what was happening to my game?
---
Oof
---
Yep, i'm the same. AP bonuses, weight mods etc. I play to relax and have fun, not micro manage.
---
It can be pretty fun but I tend to game alone. The only time I would game with Joe is when we were visiting eachother as we were on separate consoles but honestly felt easiergoing compared to online gaming. 
---
I sometimes wish I had a PC though. I could do a lot more with mods
---
Exactky 2 Radchickens
---
Agree on this part. I never stop pay-it-forward. Its much better as a gaming community than exorting money for it.
---
Stuff like this is more common in games than you think. Why bother making an entire new system codewise for 1 thing when you can just use workarounds the player will never notice unless they delve into the code or use clip shenanigans?
---
If you've ever had chickens, you'd understand.
---
Nope. For example: I'm a Field Medic/Commando build. I can hold my own in *most* PvP encounters but I'm more of a Support role.
---
I never dabbled in Bloodied/Junkies builds. I'm perfectly content with the build i currently have.
---
Nice! Me too, I have tried different builds but I just always come back to this one. Always have a lot of fun, but staying in stock with .308 ammo is very grindy. Still, worth it for me personally because I love using my LMG so much. I switch it up between that and my Final Word. The Gatling is awesome too
---
I mean for me working full time and only playing my days off and at night after my girlfriend is sleeping im at level 93 and its due to the fact that the dailies take 15 minutes to beat and the weeklies take like 45 minutes max if efficient
---
Yeah, but 300 points for just 15 EC feels like a scam to be honest. I spend like 10 mins scraping everything I don't use only to spend it in a few seconds for less than 100 EC  *sigh*  It's not that bad if you use shotgun or pistol, but for minigun it's nothing. But I'm not complaining, I'll just craft it :p
---
Not really. Meatpiles lagged hard a few days ago but that seems to be resolved. Servers are fine for me (EU).
---
Side note, hardly ever crash or blue screen anymore either.
---
Unlike others here who try justify what you experience, if it was on PC I can say with quite some certainty that it was a hack. 
---
2 things you can check if it happens again:
---
1) did you hear some punching noise when you got hit?
---
2) did you observe the guy who killed you, see where he was, if he was aiming through rocks or walls and if he had a crap ton of kills? And maybe all of this just 2 minutes into the match?
---
If so, report his ass
---
I get the sense that this entire game is being directed by rando middle managers at Zenimax walking into the office, spewing some random evil/incompetent idea, then walking out expecting the team to somehow implement it or get fired, with no further details on how to make it not terrible. I simply cannot believe that the people who test or care about this game at Bethesda are so blind as to not see how shitty things have become. 
---
I have fun playing this game despite Bethesda's constant half-assed implementatjons, rarely because of them.
---
As others said, damage perks, legendary prefixes on shishkebab, or mod installed, they won't change the healing rate. The only thing that affects healing rate is attack speed, so you want to get Shishkebab with faster swing speed, and it also stacks with Martial Artist perk.
---
While doing tests with friends it took us around 23s to heal from 20% to max HP with rank 3 Friendly Fire and faster swing speed Shishkebab, and around 12s with Martial Artist on top of that.
---
Around Silo Bravo are decent spots too, just kind of out of the way.
---
All you need is five addictions and a junkies weapon.
---
It is a common misconception that junkies take drugs. After you're addicted, there's no need.
---
This is in response to all 3 of your last comments instead of responding to each one separately.
---
Re-read my past comments. I've already laid out the limitations that impact your ability to actually stock vending machines, display items in your camp, craft ammo, etc. I don't mean this as an insult (I've definitely valued that we've both been civil) but it sounds like you might be a bit of an apologist for Bethesda.
---
I pointed out how they went back on their word and designed the game in a way that coerces the user into purchasing (thru a subscription no less) content that is needed in order to feasibly run your camp (an essential part of gameplay), and by doing that they violated their promise to us users. That's where my issue is.
---
Your remarks that 'maybe I shouldn't play the game' are irrelevant. It's not all or nothing. We can enjoy some parts of something while also acknowledging valid criticisms and not being blindly loyal. And no, I don't think I should receive something for free that other people pay for. You're creating a red herring.
---
My whole point has been that something that corrects a fundamental issue in gameplay, and that was promised to not be introduced as a micro-transaction (let alone subscription...) should be free for all users. If you want to excuse Bethesda for lying to all of us and think that keeping the scrap box behind a paywall is reasonable, that is up to you.
---
I think we've both hammered out our positions and I don't think either of us are going to change each other's minds so there's not really a point to keep going. Again, I do appreciate keeping the discussion civil though.
---
Ironclad and lifegiver are certainly not a must.  If you have decent armored ironclad is a waste of perkpoints
---
Honey, look at how much of bugs r raised but after 1 year they r still there... stop helping them find an excuse to suck big time... and put the blame back to the gamers. Remember we PAID for the game...
---
I'm at Lv 82 and either running around with single firle 'rifles' and a mix of arour parts or power armour and heavies. Its enjoyable pummelling stuff with lots of gattling plasma.
---
it’s noisy, but you can turn it off
---
That's why they ditched it, others had same plan :-)
---
 At 150 it shouldn’t be hard to lvl up. As others have said, get your intelligence as high as possible and take food buffs with carnivore/herbivore. Then join a team (preferably building) and Equip inspirational. Then run through whitesprings and west tek and you’ll have levelled up
---
A wild chassis appeared! Player used install fusion core. It was Super effective! would you like to give your chassis a nick name?
---
If you want to be an all rounder like OP and want more resistance and health. Then I suggest those perks. Thank you for the downvote.
---
It is, I have a completely different way of coping compared to another close friend of Joe's; I helped carry the coffin, it was my first funeral and the first time I experienced a death so close to me, yet it still doesn't feel real and I feel like I'm not feeling what I should, if that makes sense? Joe's other close friend cried at the funeral, I didn't even sob. 
---
I felt like sharing this could maybe help people to do something similar as I'm sure some people may feel as though memorials in games are silly or something
---
Ahh, better stuff. Thanks for the detailed answer.
---
I don't think the working adult, casual player, average joe is meant to complete the Run. Pretty sure that's the point, that the later rewards are rare and reserved for those that can actively sit down and dedicate huge amounts of time to the game spread across the week. Point being, don't feel like you need to complete it, I don't think that's the intention for the majority of players.
---
After reading the comments that were from a week ago I can confirm that the bug is still in the game. I tried with the methods you were suggesting in the comments and its a no go. After I inserted the T-fuse and put in the blood sample it was dead. After re-logging it only told me to insert the fuse and check the terminal. I think that I was doomed the moment I inserted the T-fuse
---
Yeah.. I remember a few times after killing legendary running to it to loot asap.. and the body just disappeared as I was running. literally, one second there and then poof. first time happened to me I was a newbie and it was so frustrating, I submitted a ticket. ofc nothing happened, not even a response,  but now I can afford to lose a few 1* items. still annoying tho, especially if you need scrips
---
I'm pretty sure i got the hazmat suit at level 3. Maybe Level 4 increases drop rates.
---
Looks like you're streets ahead.
---
It's Huntersville, but yes those are 2 good and close by super mutant farms.
---
I wouldn't commit to a year because honestly the content doesn't justify it, but month to month while you're actively playing is totally worth it.
---
How often do you run Burrows and collect the weights from Prison Yard, Lodge, Charleston, ect?
---
With things like scrapper, ammosmith, and super duper (and the new legendary perk ammo factory soon), you should be _swiming_ in 2mm fairly easily.
---
I had some rough spots when I first logged in earlier today. But after that rough patch of the game freezing, and being disconnected twice, I have been playing for over 6 hours with no problems. Yes I’m on PS4. And yes, it’s my day off.
---
There is a bug that causes legendaries to disappear. Example, u killed a legendary, then u turn left n kill the minions, when u turn back. Its gone! Using a prosnap camera, u see the legendary, but the body isnt there.
---
WE ARE FxxKED!
---
There are three days a week I can't play this game and yeah it sucks that I won't complete the legendary run (not going to pay) but I'm not upset about it.
---
I'm happy for the people who can play every day and wish I was one of them but I am not, still I would not want Bethesda to limit content so that everyone is sure to complete it, if that were the case we wouldn't have many events at all.
---
Only if they can walk outside just like the brahmins though
---
I also noticed they are not rad chickens, I wonder which vault they are from, if it's not personal vault but vault tec vault I also wonder what experiment and vault designs they will add so they can keep these poop machines inside, alive and keep make people suffers xD
---
This is not true. Boomers never argued that everyone should receive those rewards, regardless of achievement.
---
I named my vampire gauss shotgun "Health Insurance"
---
There’s a lot of them about !
---
I'm not the most creative when it comes to camp building, I honestly think this whole glass dome has more to see than my actual building, so I really appreciate that. Thank you! I feel like something like this will be immortalised in data as apposed to being exposed to weather etc.
---
My point is not that I need that ammo, I have plenty, I just said it's kinda weird you cannot produce it as any other energy ammo.
---
Thank you, I'm taking it slowly as it gets more difficult but I'm getting there
---
There should be a thing that allows you to do everything. It don’t go away and it stacks up. The ones that you miss
---
yes! we have cows for fert, give us food! carnivores need something they can eat from their camps
---
My guess is that because gauss is a new ammo, they didn't update the factory to reflect that?
---
So who was gonna tell me it was only online 😭
---
He never got to experience 76 which is such a shame but he's always with me in spirit, in a way. Thank you, I'm taking it one step at a time and getting better every day
---
I enjoy naming my weapons :)
---
3* combat shotgun (limb dmg, anti armor, dmg resist reload) = Sledge’s Shotgun
---
2* mr handy buzzaxe (limb dmg, vampire) = Pounds of Flesh
---
3* sledgehammer with croquet mallet skin (furious, power attack dmg, power attack dmg resist) = Commie Whacker 
---
1* Flamer (two shot) = Old World Toaster
---
3* Fatman MIRV ( two shot, limb dmg, reduced weight) = I Am Become Death
---
3* Combat rifle (two shot, explosive, ?forgot) = Sparky Sparky Boom Man
---
3* Gatling gun (dmg aiming, dmg mutated, ? Forgot) = Nosferatu (I plan on making this prime as it is my go to for scorchbeasts in the air)
---
*** I forgot the 3rd legendary effect on those last two because I’ve used multiple similar legendaries of those weapon types over the past year, oops lol
---
I grew up on a farm and we NEVER used chickenshit as fertiliser..
---
On the topic of ammo being dropped - is it just regular ammo or do they drop ultracite stuff too?
---
Yeah, first time was doing this and I didn't find the assaultron body (a newbie got confused with quest markers, got too many on xD) and chose a protectron that I found. She was very frustrated but I think nothing bad happened. Every time you'll talk to her she'll be pissed at you a little, but otherwise it's the same outcome I suppose.
---
Yeah, thought so too. I wonder if they ever change that.
---
Yes. They should change it. Yesterday i encountered a fxxker 1 shot the legendary in uranium fever. After that, the next 2 spawns. I changed to my instigating n 1-shot the 2 legendaries b4 they mutate. Really pissed at events nowsaday. Some people needs to learn about 1-shot at events. There are others people capable of doing so if they dun learn to carry a lower damage value pistol in the game
---
Other than making a new character (which is viable if you have the slots available), you can also boost your XP gain on your main with multiple sources. 
---
For example, the mutations I run grant me +7-8 Int (2.5% per point) and a Building team is another +1-4 Int. That’s +20-30%. Currently have 4 pieces of Secret Service Armor that give +1 Int (another +10%)
---
Well Rested for another +5%. Inspirational for +15%. Brain Bombs for +6 Int, Cranberry Relish for +10%, Berry Mentats for +5 Int. There’s another +57.5%
---
With that bonus of +87.5-97.5%, I go to West Tek and don’t kill the ‘boss’ up in the control room and let the Super Mutants keep regenerating. At level 260, I’m getting about 2/3 - 3/4 a level in about 15 minutes. 
---
I think there are other boosting methods, but these are pretty easy to maintain. Check out Angry Turtle on YouTube for a detailed breakdown of how he does it. I think he’s getting about 400-500 per Super Mutant kill. 
---
When Legendary Perks go live, getting to level 300 is where you’ll unlock all the slots (assuming it’s not going to change/has changed), so you will probably want to keep leveling your main.
---
That’s what it is. I’m guessing it’s not supposed to be that way though. That’s why I say glitched.
---
Yeah, but that is only possible because of exploits and broken builds. And sooner players having to much free time on their hands.
---
I, too, am curious about this. I do not have any turrets built at my camps to maximize budget. I am wondering if I will end up needed to destroy parts to my CAMP in order to build them once one wastelanders comes out.
---
A lvl 5 feral ghoul attacking my walls is alot different than a lvl 62 one.
---
The area had been nuked and it’s a random spawn.
---
too bad she never says that
---
I’m not making excuses and I’m not your honey. The job of the people in the PTS is to report bugs and provide feedback. That’s why you participate in the PTS. That’s the sole reason it exists.
---
That makes sense to me, just a bummer
---
Literally me last night tho
---
I guess they figure if you're busy working that you have more money to buy levels.
---
my deathclaw scaled to lv25 so yeah you need to be very careful still
---
i moved it to the side of the camp that doesnt get attacked because lol at it surviving otherwise
---
note that i live in the forest and that place only seems to scale up to lv25 for some reason
---
The pr oblem with this whole situation is that these cards are not supposed to be easy to get nor is everyone supposed to have all them maxed. If you do it's supposed to take a long time.
---
That being said i don't like the idea of scrapping cards and punishing players who chose to move special points around. I agree with levels grinded should reward perk coins not scrapping cards.
---
Yep, helmet is the one you want.
---
I never saw ultracite ammo drop, but then, I also only had ultracite for a gatling laser and gatling plasma, and ended up getting the ammo for that at the end.
---
Mandela?
---
when i was in cub scouts, and we ("millenials", though we were like 12 at the time) competed in a pinewood derby, we all just wanted to show off our cool cars we made. the parents- most of which were either boomers or gen x- were the ones who wanted to know why fourth place didnt get a trophy like first through third did.
---
dont know what millenials people always accuse of demanding awards for nothing, but i have never experienced any.
---
As a working adult myself too 
---
You have to understand that Sometimes everything can’t be attainable by everyone and it okay
---
If you open a perk from a pack that you already have enough of to have every rank (1 of a only 1 rank perk, 3 of a 1 or 2, 6 of a 1,2, or 3, etc), it just deletes it
---
3!
---
Well to be honest, that hadn't occurred to me...
---
I'm about to start a second character just to run the other Wastelander quest line for the attached trophy. I'm gonna be throwing caps around to all the low level camps I can find.   
---
   
---
Make it rain caps!!
---
Achievement?
---
You're still going to be doing more dmg.   
---
There shouldn't be only one or two end game builds. Bringing these dmg numbers closer together allows people to make the leap to other builds without them feeling like they aren't putting enough dmg even though they have a complete build.   
---
There shouldn't be any end game build that can kill the SBQ so quickly that others who are also shooting it don't get the award because they didn't output enough dmg for the game to award them with the kill. The Junkie and Bloodied builds are too out of whack with the rest of the game. They need to be reeled in and not left where they are.
---
Daily... fixed it
---
You are right, they know exactly that many people need to pay in the end, who do not have the time. The only thing I have to say is just pay if u have no time because you work. Or just don't get the stuff because you don't want to pay... In the end its your decision and your choice if you really need the items or not. That their intentions are greedy and this is a foul game, that is nothing new
---
Lost an Imposter body just today as well. But got another White Wolf Fedora, sooo..... yay?
---
Yup.  Google the Mandala effect.  It's pretty interesting.
---
How do you move a pet?
---
Yeah that's bad.
---
Other than the obvious refund or bug report, both of which you should consider, maybe another thing you could try is to enlarge the FOV from default to something like 100. It might help with the view.
---
Fair comment. Maybe an American thing.
---
I'd made a memorial to a friend that passed in Terraria. Then, my computer decided my terraria world saves were worthy of being deleted for some reason during a clean up.
---
My only back up was before I made the memorial. So, fair warning. It can hurt when it's gone.
---
I know, I'm saying it's Mandela you are saying  Mandala lol
---
You don't need to craft ammo in the devision.
---
as in Nelson Mandela, named for the weird coincidence of many thinking he had already died years before his actual death. the idea is people think at some point, groups cross into paralled realities causing many to remember things differently.
---
personally i dont think there's any truth to it, and its just people remembering incorrectly.
---
I am American.
---
Working dad who just spent a week with no electricity here. Been playing since day 1.
---
No way I'm finishing the season.
---
Might be unpopular but go full unyielding, do the glitch for it to double it up, be a herbivore eat cranberry relish drink the cran juice have some brain soup sleep well run inspirational join a build team.   
---
In about 2 hours I gain 5 levels and I am in my 200s.  The bog will be your friend there is two great spots to hit up then move onto interior west tek, if line pops go to it after a bit everything is respawned in bog go back rinse repeat.   
---
I have done this for a week and was 7 behind the ship  I am now 1 behind and I have my dailies to do still.   
---
Basically stack int and xp bonuses and find a fast kill routes that has decent respawn rates.
---
Thanks. That was most helpful. Do not have the time or interest in starting another character. I keep forgetting to use inspirational/ well rested. Think that will make a huge difference
---
Lol ya I'm not the op but apparently I can't spell as well :p
---
Cool thanks!  Everyone has been quite nice so far, which was my main hesitation playing (getting hounded my murderous players when trying to enjoy some solo time).  Within 30 minutes of starting a level 238 guy gave me a tour of his home, 1000 caps, 1000 .38 ammo and a team request.
---
Is anything else “rare” besides western outfits?
---
Ballistic Fibers, Screws, Concrete are the rarest material in my opinion
---
That's true - for minimax builds.
---
I did exactly the same yesterday! Lol.
---
Thank you! When I started I thought to myself "I have a lot a shit from the atom store I've never used." So I made sure to use every item at least once, and every building tile is a different building material and wallpaper. Its a mess but it turned out nicely.
---
Before I built this I spent two days at the wade Airport trying to recreate youre build. How did you angle the part at the top? Thats the one thing I couldnt figure out without making and ugly tower around the back that didn't fit in with the rest.
---
its tethered to the camp object itself so if you move that the pet will move over to the area to moved the camp object to
---
also as i noted I live in the forest and enemies only seem to scale up to lv25 there so its possible my deathclaw would go higher if I lived in say the cranberry bog
---
I want the pump shotgun.  I got about what you got except I also got a single star legendary Western revolver with a anti-mutant property.
---
Everyone would then have max vendor caps after like two events/quests
---
Fancy pump action shotgun is a potential drop
---
And honestly, when i get to gauss pistol, my dps will _skyrocket_ since it's damage outmatches plasma and it's ammo is way easier to make.
---
You would have to imagine that NPCs are treated the same as players, with their damage taken and damage done scaling against their target based on their own level.  If that holds true then there's really no difference between a level 21 pet Mirelurk and a level 100 one other than the number.
---
Each to there own. I found him entertaining until he jumped the 76 hate train in the games early days constantly stating he was not going to support the game and was not going to play it. Still using it for videos in the present though. Seems a little fickle in my opinion. 
---
Angry Turtle however seems like a very legit FO76 tuber who calls a spade a spade.
---
Marsupial and floating rug exploit
---
Pretty much bunch of crap.  I turned in 28 today myself
---
Have you tried centering the nuke on fissure site prime?
---
The people cheating and using these kinds of weapons are the same ones who absolutely refuse to fight the queen in a nuke zone. 
---
Make fissure site prime ground zero again.
---
Try it. I'll bet you they don't show up.
---
I got 3 fancy shotguns from 42 tickets once.
---
And then someone gave me 500 flux for one. Which was also nice.
---
Why no electricity? You good?
---
I’ve noticed it too. I could deal with it, but all of my guns (bloodied fixer, bloodied lever action, bloodied 10mm pistol, and instigating .44) are way worse in VATS than even like 3 or 4 weeks ago. Something is definitely up.
---
Most of the online counters put pc player numbers at +/- 35,000.
---
There's two fancy guns (shotgun and revolver) available from what I understand. They are more rare than the outfits
---
Same with my vats commando/rifleman/guerrilla/gunslinger
---
I mean, 5 caps a piece...
---
Nah I agree, bloodied should have its damage reduced to an extent. I’m just putting out there that a high risk high reward build should be doing more than a build with less cons.
---
There should be perk cards, armor, etc. that help the synergy between different builds, like bloodied has. That way there’s a variety of builds that have a better appeal
---
Does it increase xp from daily missions because I always see the "your teamate completed a quest" thing a lot and assumed that's what they were using it for.
---
I like the grind the enclave events and other smaller events because there's usually nobody there and I like explosions and stuff rocketing down from space. I don't think those show that I'm at them though.
---
&gt;From what I gather, by your understanding of our approach, we'd display something like: 200-500 caps, but some buyers could pay over 1000. 
---
This is the exact opposite of what I meant! In this analogy you're the one that is stating that the price is 500-1000 when reality is otherwise.
---
This is a prime example of what I meant about your site being out of touch and the whole reason why you even need to change things as you've outlined in this very post.
---
I wasn't giving feedback before but if you really want feedback, here it is.
---
 ***"This weapon is worth 3000-6000, but some buyers could pay over 6000" or something like that. Now I'm seeing "This could go for 3000-6000, but some buyers might pay over 20000"*** 
---
This is a comment from someone else in this post. Why is "some buyers might pay over..." in there at all. Why is this even a consideration? To me it reads as you (I don't mean you personally but your site overall) are not happy with the average pricing and want to skew the results higher. I mean if you're going to go through the effort to provide a statistically irrelevant edge case, where is the "some buys might pay as little as..."? We know why. 
---
This is one of many reasons why your site is considered a joke by a lot of veteran players. It feels like your site is skewed to maximise profits from traders (which I'm guessing you and people on your team are also are intimately a part of so you're introducing a lot of that bias). That was the point I was making about the serums analogy - the difference between traders trying to maximise profits vs reality.
---
I mentioned that there was a fundamental flaw with your model and the above skew is but one example but you highlight a bunch of others in this post as well.
---
**"Each item and effect is attributed three numerical values. pcDemand, consoleDemand, nicheDemand."**
---
Why is niche demand even a thing? It's like estimating pricing for say a Matrix collectors edition set where you work out what local demand is, what international demand is and what "niche" demand is, like somehow the considerations of what Keanu Reeves fans are willing to pay is in anyway meaningful. 
---
Your niche demand is as dumb as the analogy makes out and is probably part of the reason why your prices are skewed unrealistically.
---
***"The data is coming from crawling the F76 infosphere as a whole (Facebook groups, Reddit, Discord servers). The data we trust the most (and towards which the algorithm might be skewed) are auctions and biddings - active interactions of multiple people competing to get an item."***
---
These would indeed be sources to consider in terms of gathering actual real world pricing data. Why isn't in-game player vendor pricing a part of this too? 
---
You left out the most significant data set out of the lot. It's probably the core reason why your prices are skewed ridiculously high and not reflective of real world pricing.
---
If the only way you could ever trade in this game is via these third party sources, then sure, it'd be somewhat reflective of pricing. However, that's just not the case anymore. The majority of items sold are done by player vendors in-game.
---
Selectively ignoring some data sets and selectively biasing your pricing based on others, it's no wonder your prices are so out of touch.
---
Are there any plans at all to scrape pricing where the majority of it lies i.e. in-game? I get that it may not be easy. However, without taking a random, representative and statistically significant sample from the in-game community, your prices will forever be out of touch with reality.
---
Look, all this feedback and criticism aside, I get you guys are trying to provide a service for the community and that's commendable. However, it really does seem that you need to go back to the drawing board in terms of the fundamentals of how your model is structured. If you're ignoring in-game pricing outright, if you're skewing pricing based on maximal selling prices rather than the average price, people like myself, dozens of veteran players I know personally and I'm sure dozens and dozens of seasoned players out there will still consider your resource to be mostly useless and out of touch.
---
What you've said you're already doing is already a good first step. Acknowledging that you have a problem is half the battle won and taking community feedback helps a little more. These are good first steps. I hope that this and more helps to make the pricing you post reflective of reality, I really do.
---
A surprising amount of people in groups are those who just start/join a random one for the score challenges and want to continue playing solo just like they did before the seasons update
---
hmm
---
Need more skin options for it tho.
---
Doesn't quite gel with my my girls silent hill nurse aesthetic.
---
Need a good nurse backpack too, or a satchel perhaps.
---
Same here. Just waiting for Watchdogs and Cyberpunk...
---
I hate it cause I barely get a shot in before everyone has killed the wave meaning i barely  get any experience. And then all the corpses and flesh piles around one area makes the game starts literally running in seconds per frame anytime I look at them and my PS4 goes jet engine so I can’t even loot them.
---
Oh man that's rough as hell. I'll be keeping this picture in case my save gets corrupt somehow. You can never predict these things
---
The super shorty was upgraded into a super shotty
---
It does exist and it’s already in the game, it just hasn’t been made available to us. 
---
It’s a black balaclava, some raiders wear it. 
---
And Ladydevann responding to posts that it’s missing acknowledges that it’s availability is bugged, not it’s existence.
---
His videos are informative but nauseating to watch his Jerky play style.
---
I'm hoping there will be more added eventually
---
The mandala effect (not to be confused with the Mandela effect) is when you stair too long at a mandala drawing and get dizzy.
---
No. I’m really not creative and the defaults tell me what it is. That’s all I need lol
---
I remember reading about this a while back. I think it had something to do with the original voice actor not being available when they recorded lines for Meat Week last year.
---
Plus AT doesn't have the most annoying voice I have ever heard lol :-)
---
Oh wow I didnt know there were guns as a potential drop
---
I'm not sure whether griping on Reddit even makes a difference, but of all the annoying "improvements" being made in the near future this might be the one that breaks me. 
---
Ammo management is already one of the single most annoying parts of this game. We definitely don't need more bullet sponges.
---
Need ammo? Well, you can go to Lucky Hole/Ammo Factory, but you will need ammo for that. Non-bloodied/Junkie's Commando/Guerilla using ammo that the factory trickles out? You may actually use more ammo on defend events than you get from the factory. 
---
You can craft ammo. But without Ammosmith and Super Duper, you're gonna burn through all that lead you just spent in seconds.
---
Farm ammo from enemies and containers with scrounger? Ha. Have fun with the RNG. You also might use more ammo than you find. 
---
Well, all that ammo you found using scrounger can be converted into the ammo you need! All you have to do is memorize how much you have, click through a bunch of menus, probably fuck up and sell something you meant to buy (and vice versa). Repeat with every type. Have fun with that engrossing gameplay, and enjoy the exchange rate. I know, you can just use steel/railway spikes. But that's not what is intended. 
---
I made a commando build but ended up abandoning it because I was spending my entire game time faffing with ammo. Now I have my current gunslinger with a magic plasma pistol shotgun. One shot on standard enemies. One plasma cartridge. One. I switch to a furious Plasma Gatling for SBs. I still always sit my CAMP on a lead deposit, because one plasma cartridge craft takes an absurd amount of lead.
---
If they make even high damage, low rate of fire builds require ammo management to be a full time job I'm absolutely done.  I refuse to grind for ammo like it's made from gold bullion. 
---
If they are going to do this, they should make the special targeted ammo drops from Daily Ops apply to the whole game. What's in an enemies' inventory already has no relationship with the weapons they use a good portion of the time, so just give us a small amount of ammo for the gun we used to kill them.
---
Edit: typos
---
Edit2: Apparently enemies dropping the ammo you use is not just in Daily Ops. Confirmed? That might be the way out of this mess.
---
Even then.    I have to drop so much stuff because I’m at max vendor caps as is, and I’m sure most other people do, too.   Everyone having to drop even more stuff would make servers even more unstable.   Unless they raised max vendor caps as well
---
It's a chicken coop. We need a rooster coop too.
---
I provide a service where when I come to your camp, I shut it off before I start shopping.
---
Were any of the above outfits rare prior to wastelanders?
---
Nothing. Well mine didn't anyway since it was added after the nuke dropped.
---
&gt;Mind if I ask what the lunchbox rewards are and how to use them?
---
They're under Aid, just use a lunchbox like you would anything else in Aid.
---
My personal favorite is the one that makes enemies explode in confetti. They should keep that as a permanent option.
---
Until someone places down a tent...
---
What if you stare at it? :-)
---
No it’s not. My build is a junkies heavy gunner, I use like 15 of my slots for QOL and weight reduction. One you hit 50 the games too easy
---
Bethesda may not know how to test it's game but they certainly know how to test brand loyalty. I've never rage quit a game as many times as this one and yet inevitably keep coming back for more abuse.
---
I did (bought Skyrim for Xbox and Switch). I also used to pay fallout 1st. Nothing helped. It's not money they want apparently. Just to make players and fans frustrated.
---
It’s getting patched Tuesday apparently.
---
Lol nobody felt like reading your book so we all downvoted it
---
I used the personal terminal and power armor.
---
Whats the chair on stairs glitch?
---
*life is unfair for working adults*
---
I really hope so
---
It sucks

Go shotgunner build. I was having a helluva time with that as well. Then I got a 2 star quad double barrel and it completely changed the whole game for me. I was a stealth sniper but now I’m just a close up vats and blast build and it’s the absolute funnest. To go from ticking down health at a distance with a bolt action rifle and taking 20 min to clear mobs from a location to gunning them down in a couple minutes and blasting through daily’s allows me to complete all daily and weekly score challenges in less than an hour a day. That said. I’d rather play a few hours twice a week but whatever. For now I’m having fun.
---
Would love to hear someone's experience who wasn't using a legacy.
---
Both seem to contribute, but two sleek legs do not appear to stack.
---
I've regularly found legendary enemies behind Freddy's and in the Abandoned Bogtown.
---
I stopped playing this morning for exact reason! At level 430 it’s no small task to level up anymore. Not too mention couldn’t turn in anymore scrip, bullion notes, and was at max caps. I’ll finish the board on Tuesday and I’m thinking a break is coming... Might be permanent if the PTS damage nerf actually happens.
---
Stairing, not to be confused with staring, is when you step on something repeatedly until it brakes.
---
Sorry to say but that's kinda the point of the battlepasses. Time gated content behind a grueling xp grind. Either you buy it outright, grind through it or don't finish it and time and "feel obligated" to buy the rest; it's by design and we only have ourselves to blame for encouraging it as we have (considering its in most games now and with fo76 they've already got one ready in PTS and another one planned after that)
---
I don't get how it's very "EA of them" considering it's not a paid DLC package. The amusing irony is EA was rather late on battlepasses in the few games they have them and they been pretty good for it as opposed to others. Bfv for example had 3 month long chapters which could be completed just by playing the game, weekly challenge nodes did give chunks of XP and you could get assignments to give more but you could easily level up at your own pace (providing you played of course as per design). About the 3rd one in could you buy tiers with the paid currency and they were available to purchase after it had ended for a while. And it's been entirely cosmestics with the last chapter giving weapons that could be earnt afterwards without premium cost (though we're incredibly easy to get too and when start two weapons were bugged and were instantly available for a few players so they just unlocked it for everyone).
---
Meanwhile with the legendary run in fo76 there is no date on it anywhere to inform you when it's finishing (whether through incompetence or deliberate to get you to panic) and only the stupid zorbo ship as any indication. You are deliberately gated with our much XP you get earn for this as it's a seperate score as opposed to regular leveling XP so it's further grindy because you only have so many challenges per day/week not factoring in time and ability to do so (I personally do at least to the gold daily challenge otherwise if it's say kill 3 legendaries or something as RNG as that is don't bother same as Nuclear Winter shite). Now I picked up with Xbox game pass so I wasn't even really aware of it and was two weeks beyond without realising; right now I'm 65 and have nearly caught up but through being forced to play daily and burning out (I would prefer to just play and enjoy the game as opposed to grinding a battlepass with daily challenges) 
---
It's a shame that battlepasses are what they are as opposed to a tier system everyone can work through their own pace at any time. Honestly not looking forward to fo76 seasons if they are gonna be back to back too; quite enjoy when a battlepass in a game can be done easily and there is a between the next one so it doesn't feel like you are forced to play it daily. Personally one of my favourites is the Red Dead Online outlaw pass that pays for itself with the gold cost (which you can easily earn ingame) and it's completed by regular XP which can be finished in only a couple of days; personally finished the first two within 2-3 days just playing as I regularly do, nearly finished the current one and I've barely been playing not for lack of trying *cough darn fo76 cough*.
---
But let's be honest here; battlepasses arent meant for people like you that casually play games either through lack of time or will. They are for people that can sink in a significant amount of time into the game daily or shell out for microtransactions (honestly surpised fo76 didn't let you buy levels with atoms straight up, there's no level bundle purchase nor can you bulk buy the levels so it's rather painful even for people to buy tiers).
---
Hopefully the next one they can improve and either fix the score system so you can get through with dailies and weeklies easier (doubling the current score even tripling would be nice), they could make each level the same requirement as opposed to the current increase per level which whilst fine at first really adds up quickly or maybe even let regular XP factor into it but either incorporating it so you can just play without worry or increase the amount of score you get for every 10k XP (personally should be a 100 score per 1k XP, I feel that's fair)
---
 Join a build team.
---
Someone make brain fungus soup or cranberry relish, and provide same to the team.
---
All 4 of you in the same place - whitesprings is a good choice - everyone open a lunchbox.
---
On a good day, you’ll end up with a 100% XP bonus.
---
You can also run the WS circuit.  Thats good for 10k XP solo - at 100% XP bonus with a group, if you each try to  manage your hits, everyone will get well over 200XP per ghoul kill.
---
Do radiation rumble.  Before the event ends, everyone should level up at least once, adn be well on their way to the next level.  At L230, I made 1-1/2 levels in one event - so did the other L200+ Team members.
---
What if it breaks? :-)
---
But their strategy backfires. I (and others) cancelled 1st because of the frustration.
---
And this is one reason why I’m seriously considering hanging-up this game after this season. 
---
Sure, I’ll finish this season and keep an eye on the next season/PTS Results. But I’m really bored.
---
I hope whoever down voted a smiley face can find somebody and get a hug, we are here for you!
---
My turrets in my camp always go invisible and I can't get back my build space. I refuse to keep moving my camp which I spent hours building.
---
It does.
---
Oh it is. Just like what you're saying. It's a exaggeration.
---
I like Angry Turtle a lot too!
---
He makes top-notch videos on testing builds and the various tweaks you can make. Extremely, detailed and well done! It wasn’t until recently I starting seeing his videos about upcoming news.
---
Yeah, Bethesda is aware. Like the other person stated it should be patched.
---
Got my Junkie's explosive .50cal I named "The Fiend"
---
Check players vending machines. Some are expensive, but others not so much. I sell plans usually for between 5 and 50 caps.
---
Before Ammonia synthesis process was found, it was the only source of it, and Ammonia is used mainly as fertilizer. Though having it also yield eggs would be reasonable expectation.
---
Answers my question. Thank you.
---
IIRC, T-giving display case was never in a bundle.  Was a standalone item when it first appeared, and As you know, is a standalone item this time.
---
No you don’t. Hens lay eggs without a rooster.
---
You don’t have to play every day, but it helps. 
---
Also-not a battlepass. 
---
A hate the idea of seasons but it is supposed to be only achieved by active players. Logging on 10 times in a ten week period isn’t that.
---
You need to compost it first.
---
Yes. Quad/Explosive/15% reload speed.
---
Do the fancy guns offer any damage/performance benefit that can’t be obtained otherwise?
---
I can’t believe I need to explain this...
---
Fine. Braking, not to be confused with breaking, is when you grind something down into a fine powdery flower.
---
For some reason, I thought the chicken coop would be a lot bigger. I saw it in someone's camp and was disappointed. At least I know I wont be missing out
---
If you haven't tried it, pick up a shotgun or some Molotovs and grenades for splash damage to tag as many mobs as you can. I usually run a VATS rifle build but my gauss shotgun comes out for Line in the Sand if I see a tent in the magic spot.
---
this levels are to unlock 6 slots, to levelup a perk card you need 100, 150, 250 perk coins. Every for 100 levels you get 180 perk cards, with 2 perk coins per card, that is 360 perk points per 100 levels.
---
So you need 139 levels to get 500 perk coins to fully levelup single legendary perk card, and there are 6? So you need 834 levels at very least, not counting cards that you're using and some waste on respecs.
---
Yeah man it's each to their own. I personally don't enjoy juicehead because I used to enjoy him and he jumped the wagon so I lost respect for him. But that doesn't mean everyone should avoid him. My values are my own. Innov is okay. Just a bit whiney. Rage chronicles was fun when he wasn't being a bully. Boomsticks okay if he's not being arrogant over his own skills. And sinisterhand...well erm nuff said haha
---
No, not to my knowledge. They're more collectibles than practical weapons. They are Legendary but nothing you'd squeal over.
---
I want to finish them but I have 400 pounds of meh legendaries that I can’t do much with
---
I've been having to work overtime lately.   It's starting to feel like a chore completing the daily challenges.   And I'm only just keeping up at this point.   I'm beginning to question if it's worth the effort.  None of the other games I play feel like a chore.  And I don't even see anything in the last prizes that I even care about.   I feel like I already got all the best stuff.   
---
Is there a prize other than the atomic onslaught paint job?   Because that's definitely not something I even care about.
---
I've bought the Piper+Atoms package for two accounts just as a gest of goodwill (to support the art designers who are awesome), but after update 21, I kind of regret helping this business.
