I was on my homie‚Äôs private server yesterday and got three legendaries on our Uranium Fever run.  I think that‚Äôs pretty sweet honestly.
---
65022 damage hit!!!   Good work.
---
That is weird, I notice things respawn often and have seen significantly more legendaries than when I explore public servers. Not to mention the last 10 times I have done Uranium Fever and AWOL Armaments, I have gotten at least 2 3\* enemies during the events. I'm sure the latter is just luck on my end, but the private server is a massive selling point for me because I don't like crowds or other people. I do think the box and tent should have been free content for everyone, but it is what it is unfortunately. If they had only made a Private Server only package for $5 I would have gotten that
---
Gobble gobble
---
So you had opposite, because I had this issue only with my head. I think Innov Survivalist was talking about this problem in one of her videos
---
When you repaint your walls at home, do you not take everything off the walls first?  I do.
---
Power attack or Vats strike always solves that for me
---
and on top of all that, your enter button has stopped working, what a day huh?
---
By any chance did you do a clean install of Windows on said SSD?
---
Oh I know ppl can solo it I was replying to the post that said number of ppl dont matter.
---
I find it easier with less ppl hence going in using this weapon takes 10 minutes to kill it with a group of ppl and solo taking the same about or less.
---
I'm still waiting for them to fix plasma cores
---
When you take everything off the walls, does your house suddenly have less room in it because my camp sure fucking does! It technically never leaves budget but ALSO gets added to storage. So you have one item worth double the budget
---
Im sure it was a glitch, he was just holding his guard up, Regular attacks, Power Attacks and vats were just doing nothing at all, it was pretty funny really
---
I just started using those. What‚Äôs wrong with em? Is it all the partial cores you accumulate? I just noticed it. Pretty annoying.
---
Yes it would be nice to have snow if they could figure out how not to break the game when they do so. That's why they don't add awesome things like GTA does. Rockstar has it down, Bethesda not so much.
---
Many of times I have fallen to the fate of.....firecracker berrys
---
r/Cringetopia
---
the atom reward is way more than another mmo in lifesub with, and you can at least get something useful and possibly perm...its 1k ish right?
---
I easily encounter more legendaries
---
Can we mention the fact we haven‚Äôt seen fallout 1St sales yet. I mean I bought a year but thats been irritating me.
---
Encryptic Event.  Kill the sheepsquatch imposter.
---
Oh man, I wish this were a joke. This new generation has zero respect for their elders... smh
---
Sometimes I just need to relax so I load up Fallout 4 and bask in the bliss that is Place Everywhere and no budget mods.
---
The private servers run smoother.
---
You &amp; your friends can do event's without fighting others to get hits in. 
---
You can take whichever workshops you like without fear of some pvp'er taking it just to initiate combat. 
---
The 1650 Atoms is more than enough unless all you're interested in is PA.
---
The Scrap box is fantastic (Yea maybe it should be free but it's not)
---
The Tent is very convenient &amp; useful. Doesn't need a work bench. 
---
Expecting a new Outfit every month on top of everything they already give us seem a bit presumptuous.
---
That's intuitively what I would say.
---

---
It would probably fetch more if you modded it to the Puncturing version too, since the mod plans are about as problematic to obtain as the weapon plan itself.
---
Here's a thing thats going to get buried in this post, this is not the most I can hit her for, my record is 84k, however that does not 1 shot her, there is a damage cap at somepoint between 65k and 68k after which the damage you do takes less health of her.  65k does 100% of health, 68k does around 80% of her, 84k did about 25% of her health.  We think it was put in a few patches ago to stop the dev room items that were doing insane &gt;1m damage. Interesting and frustrating stuff I can tell you.  
---
To answer your question though, food buffs stack, +bobble head, +magazine add a sprinkle of revenant and top it off with an extra 100% with nukashine,, and you can do some crazy damage.
---
You should renew your Fallout 1st subscription, when Bethesda deserves your patronage.
---
Until then, best off to save your money.
---
I just used Samsung Migrate to copy my whole HDD over to the SSD so I am not sure that would really count as a clean install?
---
AWOL Armaments event, Scorched Earth, Encryptid Event, Project Paradise, One Violent Night, Vault 94 ... These will give you lvl 50 legendaries.  
---
For world spawns (not events): West Tek, RobCo, Dyer Chem, Harpers Ferry, Burrows.  Just a few off the top of my head.
---
You can also wander the roads that traverse Cranberry Bog and the Mire hoping for a wanderer.  I have found several legendary goodies just wandering the Mire/Bog looking for something to do.
---
(Xbox) Mine just finally autorenewed today, but since it takes a min to actually get the atoms, I have no idea when they will actually hit. I got the original on 10/23 but it waited till 11/26 to renew? Weird
---
Nah, that's fine. Was just curious as a Windows reinstall would eliminate any corrupted files; usually you don't see such drastic improvements with frame rate when an SSD is installed.
---
Unless your drive was some ancient 5400rpm drive already on its last legs?
---
Bit it's so fluffy!
---
How does the white compare to the actual gray we got last week?
---
I've tried for weeks to get an Anti-Armor Explosive gatling plasma and people have barely given me the time of day. I even got to the point of trading an absurd amount and no one cared at all. They don't trade even if you offer everything you own. The community has overvalued certain items like mad. In the end I have given up hope of ever owning one.
---
Equip scrapper perk, you should be taking between 500 and 600 steel scrap, more with higher int.
---
Oh no I get it, I'm not saying you're wrong at all, I'm saying the game is stupid for thinking those things for no damn reason :)
---
I thought it was weird but someone did mention that the game doesn't seem to agree with HDDs often... I don't think it was that old cos my computer wasn't too old when I got it pre built?
---
I would just suggest starting over. A ton has been done about how smooth the opening of the game is. It plays much better than it did at launch. Itll always be what it is. But its better than it was.
---
Eh we did expert and wasn't all that different. Sure you need to evaluate if it's worth going for some pipes, because you gain exactly the time it takes to get there.
---
But overall we were were probably 16-20 seconds late than usual, which could even be due to a bad performance run.
---
I currently run a full health support build using both a vampires and medics Less ap Vats Crit damage combat shotgun,  I absolutely love it too, with four leaf clover, every other shot is usually a Crit and can allow you to tank for your team by crippling enemies and healing when needed, shotguns are great for vats and good weapons to use if you wanna be a support character
---
Yeah! Imagine.
---
Seems to me then legendary spawn rate has good returns these days. I swear August and September I never got more that one.
---
CAPPED JEEZE IT WAS A THPO LOL
---
Yes.  Why not. 
---
800 atoms.
---
I guess you finally found a answer for how the 32,000 health she has seemed so inconsistent with the numbers you were seeing.  It's getting capped somewhere along the line.
---
Has this been recently confirmed? I read this a few weeks ago and tried it around 15 times, but I kept get the exact same awards each time for both Thirst things First and Second Helpings. It was like 10mm ammo, hunting rifle plan, some other plan, and 38 ammo then the other one had different rewards, but they were the same every time. Dont know if its fixed or I'm jinxed.
---
I admit, I hate that this kind of thing is possible, I know it‚Äôs not your fault, but this is awful.
---
But I understand the appeal some see in this, kind of.
---
I'd be really curious to know what the upper bounds on gun damage against her would actually be.
---
more raider themed items like decapitated heads and slave cages
---
Fix all of these things but please leave my meat hook alone ;)
---
haha
---
Until Bethesda formally acknowledges it as a bug, I don't consider it one.  They've had months to address this, one way or the other, but they never have.  Same with certain Pipe Weapons.

---
Vault71 is more likely since 96 is going to be vault raids
---
I have a B+40Power attack but 90reduced weight hook, it's nice, got it as a drop from AWOL Armaments, other legendary drop from that one event was a B+FSS+90reduced weight Assaultron Blade. Two near god level drops from the same event, I was blown away.
---
So there are more than just the 2 vaults I mentioned and obviously 76? I need to look into these, but thanks for pointing that out :)
---
Now add a robot launcher or cow-ta-pult to the top.
---
Oh yeah, the pipe gun glitch, the meathook glitch, unfixed, the glitch where Martial Arts boosted fire speed of Gatling Gun, fixed. Fucking Bethesda...
---
Keep your pay to win ideas to yourself.
---
There is vault 76 and then 5 others that I can think of.
---
The npcs are coming from else where- they are migrating here
---
Happy cake day.
---
Ah ok, well I best get hunting when I jump back on.
---
Yup for sure man, this turned into a maths experiment :)
---
Ohhhh yeah, I completely forgot!, You reckon all these vaults will just be raids?
---
And that was the one that almost made sense, the actual gattling is hand cranked, having faster hands would mean you could fire faster.
---
I was too when I first started. Dude was sending me messages like I was making the queen harder but I just replied that it‚Äôs not my fault your dmg output is terrible üòÇ he was well over lv100. I can solo queens now btw, not like this unfortunately... yet. Great job OP
---
What is the fixer?
---
I found a non-legendary meat hook in the white springs shops. And only Grahm sells the plans for it. It took me a while, but I only have found a Zealots 2\* version. I so wish it was a Bloodied one.
---
Maybe some will open- but for wastelanders they are coming from elsewhere :p 
---
It would be cool if a vault opened and it was treated as a town- or they build a town sorta like vault City in fallout two
---
I'm going to leave that testing for someone else :D
---
But so can everybody else.  Public is public.
---
Very very cool. Will you post details on how you arrived to this?
---
I think u mean those they had a elf set too
---
That would be awesome, I'm craving a messed up vault investigation too.
---
They are great toys, for making sparkly explosions.
---
Missle Launchers, Grenade Launchers and Fat Mans are lackluster weapons at best though. 
---
They are more novelties than useful weapons.
---
It‚Äôs going to be an insane update I can‚Äôt wait haha
---
The only good missle launcher i can think of would be a bloodied, junkies, or quad with ffr and fr
---
I don‚Äôt but when survival still existed, other people used them on me
---
Is it still just December or do we have an actual date?
---
Heeey thank u :)
---
&gt; I was thinking maybe have this guy
---
... uh, she's a gal.
---
Remove the pieces in the reverse order that you placed them.  Yes, it's stupid and doesn't make sense.
---
I must be hallucinating every time I see this happen then. 
---
I guess it‚Äôs time to lay off the shrooms
---
Pieces of coal for you naughty ungrateful children.
---
Daaamn straight ;)
---
\#stillwaitingforthegramophone
---
Yes, yes... but did you complete the "Kill Tough Enemies" Achievement? ;)
---
i know this may be a shitty up side but grenades work, looks like all types of grenades bar weapon fired. hope this helps in anyway but yeah it sucks massively
---
Sexy wallpaper!  NSFW!
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt know the actual date. Hopefully before Xmass.. makes sense would up the holiday sales
---
Exactly. I am a rifleman build and I‚Äôm equipped the same way every time I jump into the fray and she melts down faster with fewer players than with the entire server on site
---
Yeah definitely, well I'm happier waiting a month than a year, thanks for your input :)
---
You are seeing a 30 second video here, I did not just slap on a claw and hit the queen, this is the culmination of a very long and enjoyable process that was my end game, its months of testing, tweaking builds, trading armor and weapons.  This metaphorical mountain has been climbed, on to the next one.
---
Remember what BIV told you, 1 Nukashine gives permanent brain damagedüòÇü§£
---
Just kidding, but i only wrote what has been datamind, in the old days it was the case, just like you say, but now she is suppose to have 32000 in dmg and not scale, and to be hones, i have been in tons of fights with really low levels running around, from lv6 and up, and i don't feel any difference at all :/
---
With one caveat, grenade launchers are only mostly terrible. They are a little bit ok. A leeeetle bit.
---
Did u use Wasteland Whisperer
---
Nope, I guess you have to do it with a rolling pin?
---
People that solo here has great builds and weapons, like the bloodied meat hook, or my lmg that does around 90-100 on every hit, and has what i would say a really high dps :)
---
That would be great.
---
Vault 79 will be in the mountains in the top right part of the map. I had a cave base there but two patches ago they added some vegetations and an elevator that you can use in the cave. You supposedly can glitch your way to the front of the vault.
---
You can but they only live about 5 minutes due to only being level 1
---
I honestly commend the effort and your goal.
---
What I hate is that it‚Äôs possible, this kind of utterly broken mechanics.
---
It is a unique combat rifle that you can craft. Learning the plan allows the purveyor to  drop legendary variants of it.
---
Spawning in. Stepped away while stirring dinner. Came back. A super mutant killed me at the bottom. üòí
---
All good! Your welcome
---
late to the party, but I agree with bethesda on this one. Ive yet to spawn in to a pre looted world on  private server and ive had Fallout 1st since launch hour
---
Have a toon living at each. Murgle for the toon my daughter(5yrold)  designed and named(after herselfüò∫! The other with " number 1 dog", because I am a dog person. They are both great, will wander around your camp, even in the house. I think the idea of a craftable dog/cat bowl, like Brahmin pen, is great.
---
Still find it strange I've almost did it with a vampire  prime 50 cal and only had 3000 rounds and that wasn't enough using a better gatling gun in a group half the time it takes twice the time or even dont beat it.
---
I actually prefer the 2 shot for wasting missle weight.
---
Ha! I get it! It's a minigame! (Shakes head and walks away...will try that..thanks :)
---
Ooh, thinking about it I might have the rifle itself. I'll double check when I'm next on.
---
Workshops are the only way of other players forcing you into PvP , maybe stay clear from them for the min
---
I'm trying to get ideas of how things work on 76 again and git Gud, my channel just recently moved to doing more of this game.
---
Old country saying" Milk a bull, make a friend for life."
---
I love the game but I‚Äôm newer then most- joined during the free week haha
---
Its pretty much all in the video, what's missing is the food buffs, but a quick research will get you those, you are looking for melee buffs, unarmed bobble head, fury, whiskey, US ops 8 mag, nukashine, full set of uny +1str armour and the hook - B40+1Str. 
---
 The build is as you would expect - full 15 strength with everything on unarmed and melee, the rest is up to your play style, sneak is must, revenant is also key however and pretty much the hardest part of the build, you got 2 minutes from revived to hitting the queen.
---
Gremlins :P
---
Haha, still it's good to have a natter about it, you play PS4 orrrr?
---
Ah, reminds me of my first nuke with some randos who kicked me from team and party and cause I dropped a nuke on Watoga station on 3 people for funsies XD
---
I‚Äôm a Xbox guy :)
---
Start with the country club, then hit the short row of houses headed toward the main building, then the parking lot behind the main building, then the long row of houses back toward the country club, then the golf course behind the row of houses, legendaries can spawn anywhere.  Once you get a routine down, and can kill things easily, you'll level up every 3-5 whitespring runs.
---
Ah thats fair enough, good luck on your adventures, maybe one day you'll come across one of our streams for a laugh and maybe you might have learned something new.
---
What platform are you?
---
This guy is clearly trying to rip you off. A fair price is 100 caps plus a few civil war hats for the trouble of traveling to my camp.
---
Didn't eve. think about that :D Good idea, thank you
---
Ah sorry for that :( every 5th time or so it spawns you at the bottom :(
---
XBox. Guess I will avoid workshops, though not sure how else to get cores besides lucky finds. Forget using power armor I guess.
---
We're a Christian community.
---
Lol
---
Why is imgur trying to force an agecheck on this image? Why is the link in an /a/ gallery?
---
Yeah this seems pretty common from my experience. And when you‚Äôre in a high-value location (i.e, one with power cores like yourself) it‚Äôs sadly only a matter of time before someone wants what you have, or is just thirsty for some PVP!
---
Jeez. No reason to lose your head over this.
---
I'm at work atm but can spare some cores just to keep ya moving. I also would love to help defend your workshops if I'm available of course. I keep pretty weird hours play a lot because of shift work. Add me as a friend LuneLightKnight.
---
Also the flip side has happened to me, and had way more legendaries then is currently intended. It was like the old days at the golf club, like 12 legendaries, only a couple 3*,but whoo hoo. Then 5 in westek, 1 at the radio tower, 3 in a 4wave defense of Hemlock, was forking great. 
---
Have also logged in to 0, Uranium Fever, or leader of the pack being the best tests if they pop for you.
---
Rip
---
Low iq post
---
You as well :)
---
üôèüèª thx!
---
I got a few so not totally out but thanks for the offer. Just really frustrated!
---
Sorry friend, but they shouldn't refund accidental purchases. That really is a user error. Just enjoy your new option.
---
I‚Äôm sniklegem. Let me know when you head back to camp. I‚Äôm gonna stir dinner again. üòÑ
---
Sounds good.
---
You have anything against F1st'ers because Private sessions mean no griefers either.
---
This happened to me the first nuke I launched. I did it solo, too. Bad memories.
---
Yes it‚Äôs user error. They can take the wallpaper back, I don‚Äôt care about it. I spent a long time earning those atoms, I see no reason they shouldn‚Äôt refund like any other purchase.
---
I just got a TSFFR Missle launcher, added the Quad barrel, it's hella fun, but crazy impractical. Unless you use bear arms, that launcher is going to weigh 30-40 lbs, and unless you use ordnance perk, ammo is 2lbs a piece, you'll be overloaded in no time. Queen? You'd have better luck killing her with a dirty look than a missle launcher. Low level spawns? Absolute overkill.
---
But, it is a lot of fun, you could say it's a....*blast*
---
Many users have reported successful refunds on accidental purchases in atom store.  Just put in a ticket and see where it goes.
---
Yup. And the basic.50 cal mod is superior to all .50 cal mods with extra effects with the hunting rifle
---
Every where I look people are bitching about Fallout 1st. Simple solution, dont buy it if you dont like it. Also they arent recycled servers, I got FO1st on launch and have yet to come across a so called recycled server. Besides not counting the private server, which by the way only people on your friends list can enter( if you want to solo just hide under offline cant joint if they dont know your playing), as well as the exclusive stuff. The 1650 Atoms a month is worth the $13.00. Considering $15.00 will only get you 1600 caps with two purchases from the store. or if you do yearly. $100.00 vs $180.00   if your speaking solely on buying atoms.
---
Thought you did something huh?
---
Can you make a community for this cause I feel like itd be a good initiative and personally I want to join, also Xbox, but like add a few rules cause you might have people trying to take advantage of your kindness which is a sad truth.
---
I'm out and about doing trades, just fast travel to the camp, and don't stir in the meantime :D I promise you'll spawn right at the top of the tower :)
---
Ouch, you are throwing in civil war hats? Too rich for my blood, I'm out
---
Ok mungo
---
If you need fusion cores go to Blair Train yard and Mount Blair just north of it. You can walk away with as many as 3 each time. Then switch servers and do it again. Better than trying to hold a workshop. There are multiple generators and sometimes an event starts Battle Bot when you kill a sentry bot for one.
---
You'll find cores along the way. Just scalp from any PA chassis you come across and check fusion generators as you're going.  
---
The Scrounger Perk under Luck helps too as they're technically ammunition so they can show up in any ammo box with that.  
---
Plus Sentry Bots.  
---
That's the quick list off the top of my head and I've basically been riding around in PA exclusively for the entire year.
---
Amazing!
---
LIVE WITH YOUR **MISTAKE**
---
This is a cool item, but becauae of the 2* and 3*, it's a Ferrari on the outside, but a 93 Toyota Corolla on the inside. Hearing Bloodied 3* bear arm sounds bad ass, till you take a peek under the hood. You'll find a buyer though, just because not everyone can pull those.
---
I actually have a 3* Junkies Id sell.. Im just too new to know what to release it for
---
The first rule of sickle man is you don't talk adopt sickle maaaaan
---
part of the problem is that the shown damage numbers are all screwed up when it comes to her.  She has an 85% Damage Reduction. So 85% of your attack gets completely negated.  If only thats how OUR armor worked!?!?!?
---
Yeah she has around 32k health. But specifically unarmed attacks\melee attacks and some ranged attacks for whatever reason show the full damage when you are hitting her. The only real way right now is look at her health bar to see how much damage you are doing. 
---
One of our group has been tinkering around with a mod to show her true health bar and her true damage but its not ready yet
---
Lets GO
---
That comparison is wrong -its a game and mmo so its literally an alternate virtual reality so its just a simulated war. This game will never be an esport one because its broken and buggy two because this game focuses on character strength more so than player skill  which is what any esport is based upon skill. In a virtual reality which is wasteland anything goes. Ambushing robbing etc.
---
Awesome ty! I may not be able to mimick this mastery but some lessons can be learned. Awesome work.
---
Do you know which category to submit the ticket under?
---
It would be so great to have a mod like that, and thanks for clearing it up :)
---
Sorry, I don't.  I've never done it, but I've seen 6 or so posts on reddit about getting refunds for accidental buys.
---
Haha that's right!!!  Oh the ol' days when you could carry your victories around with you.
---
It wasn't. People are reporting it as adult material as a joke. I put it up on another site as well:  https://ibb.co/album/fB0XYv
---
Only opportunistically e.g. if I kill one creature that has it but haven't finished clearing the area, I might. That's about it. Terrible weight and damage efficiency
---
You and I are both getting Downvotes? I guess we pissed everyone off? Well I hope you get your Atoms back since you grinded for them. Maybe purchases can be refunded if a ticket is submitted within 5 minutes of the purchase?
---
Yeah most likely. Though that reason is why I carry a small gun on me as well. Same for when not doing damage with ranged, a melee attack normally fixes it
---
I guess I am just too old or something, Totally missed that trend. I learned about from Florida swing and dabbing nieces and nephews.lol
---
Meat hook is yeet hook. They benefit from unarmed and one handed weapon mods so they are capable of grognaks axe level damage and above, but you can‚Äôt use them in power armor. This is a bloodied power attack hook.
---
Ones darker maybe
---
You dont need codes to launch a nuke. Or are you saying the reset canceled your launch mission?
---
That‚Äôs pretty sweet.
---
Making gravy, gotta stir! I‚Äôve got 30 minutes now. Trying again
---
It did but there never was a plan, you learnt to craft them by disarming one.
---
Then the devs removed them from the game due to some exploit or another.
---
They were at one point *oopsies* reintroduced then removed again.
---
Basically on the last step you insert your key card and punch in a code, if that code is wrong you lose your key card and have to try again. I normally look the codes up so I‚Äôm asking if they reset already
---
Okie dokie. Fast travel on the camp, not me :)
---
Ohhh, weird. That sucks man
---
Thanks :)
---
Too bad you aren‚Äôt playing on Xbox you could just stream it to an iPad and go on with your day ;)
---
if you are a subscriber you can do private worlds take all three power plants and make 18 to 20 cores per hour. ( they fill up every 20 to 30 minutes with 3 fusion cores at max. anything over 30 minutes you're not looting the fusion cores fast enough and wasting cook time. )
---
if you are not a subscriber and want to farm them in public there is some basic knowledge you need, 
---
1. when you do get attacked you usually get attacked during the defense. a marker pops up on the map and goobs jump on ya. 
---
2. when you are crouched you are not visible on the map. so stay crouched when fast traveling in and out, being stealthed doesnt matter just stay crouched to stay off the map. 
---
3. in the misc tab of the build menu there is a fast travel mat second from the top. place that right in front of your fusion core generator so that you can wisk in grab it and go. 
---
4. you aren't attackable outside the contest zone. those circles you see when building are a good guide but they are not 100% accurate. 
---
5. if you aren't in the shop and no players are around npcs will not damage your equipment. one thing people do is claim it, set up the gene and then travel away without defending. the fusion core will still build three and if you are stealthed when you fast travel back you can often avoid aggro and just pick up free cores. this has the added benefit of requiring would be gankers to clear the shop before they can claim it. that removes their surprise gank attack option and gives you time to clear out. 
---
6. items you build in the shop highlight green. this means the shop is paying for it. if the item cost turns white it means the material cost is coming out of your inventory. stay under budget and you will never lose materials. 
---
7. always consider the shop lost before you even take it. just be in that mindset. stay under budget and you will still profit. 
---
8. if you arent built for pvp dont bother trying. just leave. if you hang around the shop while the fusion cores are cooking you are signing up to be a loot pinata. take the shop set up the gene. go find something else to do for 30 minutes and then come back in stealth to swipe your shit. try not to hit every 30 minutes on the dot. sometimes come early sometimes come late . dont set a predictable pattern.
---
9. if you dont like leaving the shop abandoned and would prefer to defend it ask a friend to do it for you. If you have no friends like me then stay on the outside and shoot in. stay crouched. use local fast travel points to your advantage. IE monongah, if you put the fast travel mat in at the gene you can fast travel ointo. if you fast travel to the plant you can appear outside on the south  side or on the roof. if you fast travel to monongah city you can fast travel north of the plant and sneak back down. if you are a subscriber you can also add your tent into the mix. if I am defending on public I dont run accrosee the facility I usually use fast travel points while crouched instead. every time I have been killed it has been mid fight in the middle of the facility. so I quit going there I shoot from the outskirts and drag crap out. also sometimes I just let the attack fail and come back later to reclaim. if you concentrate defenses around the core by using prebuilt 4 turret towers and just put 20 turrets around the generator. fast travel out and just let the first attack fail. when its time to reclaim and you fast travel in often the turrets will just wipe everything out for you when you arrive. they spawn in in the open often.

Yet throughout my childhood, I showed respect to elders, helped them if needed and if I had the time to I'd listen to their stories.... ok
---
#WHERE?!!
---
^(happy Cake daaay)
---
Rather something new.
---
I've yet to see this, thanks for the tip
---
It wasn't letting me make my own comment so I did it under urs
---
I thought they reset midnight eastern, if so you got 3hrs+
---
I don‚Äôt play with power armor, so I have a handful to spare. Xbone: gr8dne42 only late nights. 
---
If you occupy a workshop you are opening yourself to pvp. Had it happen a lot, so I don‚Äôt do it anymore.
---
yes they reset at 7pm eastern for me today. 
---
Pro tip. loot at least one of the beeper guys for a code fragment. they weigh nothing and when the code is about to reset it will message saying the self destruct for the code peice is being initiated. its a handy way to keep from crawling to the bottom of the silo and then trying to use last weeks code.
---
Like mainframe cores. Weird bugs which are born because of who knows what. 
---
I disagree when people say this game is a piece of shit, but sometimes... Sometimes... you have to ask yourself how they manage to cause all these problems. 
---
It's like servers go down, they say they are going to just paint the walls, we log back in, walls are half painted and the floor is missing.
---
you have to either gather up the code fragments and decode them or go to [nukacrypt.com](https://nukacrypt.com)
---
those codes reset weekly and what it sounds like to me is last weeks expired on him while he was in silo. 
---
and yeah today was the day they reset and we have to look up new codes.
---
Tried for a week when it first blew up.. Just wasnt for me, or im too old (not likely, Im not "that" old)
---
First off how many people are playing on versions of the game they got for free or at a severely reduced price?
---
Now why are people bitching and whining when Bethesda allows you to pay for quality of life improvements? They aren‚Äôt forcing them on you. Even if these improvements put you way ahead of everyone who doesn‚Äôt have First (they don‚Äôt), anyone without fallout first can still play the game in a competitive way. Many Mmorpg‚Äôs that i have played make you pay monthly JUST TO PLAY THE BASE GAME. I don‚Äôt see anyone getting upset at blizzard. 
---
Jumping on the‚Äù we hate Bethesda‚Äù bandwagon is so easy, but so many on that bandwagon are playing and enjoying the game.
---
I was hoping we would get the wastelanders update as a christmas present.üéÅ
---
I tried to make missile launcher work. multiple times.
---
Very awesome! Loved it. Creative. Magnificent!! 
---
If you are selling the unyielding combat armor then I‚Äôm interested. It was in you vendor then disappeared. üòÑü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Haha it‚Äôs right next to Lewisburg station in the ash heap. Look up a YouTube video to really pinpoint it
---
Haha yes please
---
You need stealth for bloodied melee. I would go full unyielding, since you are going to be doing it anyway.
---
Inverted roof corners? What do you mean?
---
Oh and anyone else find the thought of a wolf running around using mounted missile launcher's bad ass or just me? 
---
one on each side. train the wolf to initiate launch by biting a switch or something. wolfs could do it I bet they're smart enough.
---
Very, very rarely they'll give you a cap or two. That's it.
---
It's not crazy. It's just a very old and untenable suggestion.
---
Think of what super weapons you could make quicker because of these.
---
Excellent post, smart to use your tent as extra ft, multiple upvotes in my mind!!
---
I assume that we'll get something new but too late. I'd like to put a tree up after Thanksgiving per tradition you know
---
Rough conversion rate :p
---
Why are you still playing this game?
---
because some people enjoy it even with the bugs .
---
True but they have restrictions on what legendary effects can be together. And I'm thinking they be super rare like 1% chance or less to find them
---
https://help.bethesda.net
---
It's clunky but just select the drop fields, in the following page select any faq, at the bottom will be "submit a ticket"
---
I've received a refund previously. You should be good.
---
I use one. But you want it to be reduced weight and you need to boost explosive damage as much as possible. Instigating, bloodied... And all perks. 
---
They are great for events where enemies are numerous but not too powerful. I like 40mm grenades better, though.
---
Spend your money how you want to, if you don't find it useful then wise choice for you.
---
Why isn't there a tally of weights by tab still after a year...
---
It could pay tribute to the first to games. Would love for it to happen.
---
Oh sorry I just took the stuff out to mod them :D I can just give it you, it was a drop a couple hours ago.
---
The servers couldn't handle one snowflake, better yet, snow.
---
Technically, no since they can‚Äôt drop from legendary corpses, HOWEVER you can get 1* fixers from the purveyor if you have already learnt the fixer plan, which you get from completing the arktos pharma event, hope this helps
---
Are you sure you bought it on accident or now that it‚Äôs free it was an accidental purchase?
---
It's been suggested before but I would love if each area had its own nuke boss. Like the queen in the big, a super behemoth in the savage divide, a giant hermit crab for the mire, etc.
---
Supposedly 4 and 5 star legendaries are coming with wastelanders according to a data mine. Rifle Gaming did a video on it a while back. Here is the link,
---
https://youtu.be/ZzWsUlxWMVE
---
Yes it‚Äôs a Good and sweet game now that a year has passed
---
You don't "need" stealth in bloodied melee. Id go with unyielding still though. I've found with ghouls, that even with mild rad resistance (lead backpack, rad protection perks etc) and the blocker perk trivialises ghouls for me.
---
FYI it's a chick not a guy
---
Whhaaaaaaaa!?!?
---
That would actually be pretty sweet.. Even if each area boss had like 3 variations.. Like poison, burn, or radiation damage.. Doesn't have to be complicated as all that, just adding to the case..
---
as a player in adventure mode I run with pacifist so I dont accidently shoot other players at events and I dont accidently engage in pvp. 
---
this means to engage me in pvp you have to work around by having a teammate of mine initiate pvp, or  I have to own a workshop. if I am at the workshop you can contest and kill me at will. previously however I could be anywhere on the map . so a popular douchebag tactic was to wait for a queen fight to start initiate the cap then go gank a player while they were in the queen fight. or maybe at black water mines etc. cross map sniping. beth killed it a couple patches ago by not allowing pvp outside of the workshop area period.
---
Bethesda have confirmed it's a she and a her
---
You paid for a month. Once the next billing cycle comes around if your not paying you wont be able to launch a server.
---
Definitely looks gray, like a lighter version of last week's grey. 
---
I was hoping for a creamy white to combo with the sienna. :(
---
Beth needs to break down and produce some rag-timey music themselves (or by contract, whatevs).
---
Loot pinata, that's me!
---
Why are you still asking this question?
---
No but we will have a few more 7 dollar reskins for u guys, oh and we also have plans to sell u more f4 assets.
---
probably affected by the mainframe core bug as well
---
A cryolator smoke machine? 
---
I think the snowball gun would make cool turrets. Bonus points for them not looking like turrets though. I prefer them to look like cute animatronic decorations that get angry. 
---
Christmas snowball spitting Mr fuzzy or things of that nature.
---
Really not that many bugs tbh. Most are pretty rare
---
Its r/fo76 people will downvote you for breathing wrong. Don‚Äôt read to much into it.
---
You get it from encryptid not arktos.
---
Got on a throwaway just to post that? To be fair, lol its certainly possible.. Haha but I meant this as a convo as what the game could be with the proper care.
---
It‚Äôs not free. I accidentally just bought one that costs atoms. I meant to click the free one. This just happened.
---
 I haven‚Äôt played since it came out and was genuinely wondering if it‚Äôs gotten better
---
It's not classic Fallout, but there's always this gem from Weird Al Yankovic that always reminds me of Fallout. 
---
https://youtu.be/t039p6xqutU
---
Yes.
---
I have a Two-Shot, Vats Critical, 90% Reduced Weight one. I used it 1 time, and it broke after 4 shots with 200% condition. Dint even dent a scorchbeast. It makes for amazing decoration in my camp however.
---
Oh yeah, sorry about that, it is encryptid, thanks for telling me, was wondering why I wasn‚Äôt getting it when I did it üòÇ
---
Going through the Bethesda site is fairly straight forward. I quickly got a response back for an accidental item purchase. And typically they let you keep the mistaken item after refunding the atoms.
---
Why are you on this sub?
---
Mmh it‚Äôs gotten somewhat better, if you want a finished product I‚Äôd say come back after wastelanders and give it another go
---
No you don't need the stealth for a bloodied build but it does open your options in many situations. Either way, the bonus dr from Bolstering armor isn't that great. You'd be much better off replacing it with a chameleon, unyielding, or maybe a life saving piece.
---
This weapons sell for a lot, and I mean a whole lot. Like mule requiered type of lot. But it neefs to have the right effects. If you had pulled off a BSS+1 STR, you wouldve pulled the loto. This particular one u have can sell for about 12k-18k.
---
Fingers crossed. As I said, I don‚Äôt need or want to keep the item, just have my atoms back.
---
Be prepared if you do, and you have a vendor, for people to shoot it üò≠
---
Only 1800 atoms
---
You have a chance to get the bear arm plan from arktos though
---
I did not know that about weapon skills for the hook. I have one I just started using and will now need to play a bit more when I get home.
---
Yes but wastelanders will put a settlement there n ruin everything for u
---
&gt;I thought they reset midnight eastern
---
unfortunately its at 7pm eastern, they reset about 2 hrs 20 min ago
---
Yeah they‚Äôre pretty gross. Basically the reason I stopped wearing power armor entirely
---
I like my Guitar Sword. I named it "Jonny Guitar"
---
I think maybe about 12-24ish hours when they emailed the atoms were applied back to the acct.
---
Sheesh bro no need for an essay and yeah there‚Äôs a warning the there‚Äôs a chance somebody will come stomp you for owning it. You know the risks when getting one so if you cant handle getting ganked occasionally don‚Äôt get a damn workshop lol
---
Or, be like me and go contest workshops for the caps, junk, and salt. More than half the time people seek revenge or come back and fight, so
---
Anti-Armor works wonders. Got a AA RW +10% damage while aiming Launcher and it kicks all sorts of small-enemy ass. Bigger enemies, on the other hand, pretty much no-sell the thing even with direct hits
---
Unyielding is so darn good its hard to mix in anything else!
---
Hahaha people r so salty!
---
This, plus the mods and perks which avoid staggering and limb damage. That's how you go Conan.
---
Do Junkies then.  Its awesome damage for full health - 5 addictions and you're set.
---
I had this bug the other day.
---
Pissed me off and attacked my extractors as well.

---
So I‚Äôm maxed out on rifleman, adrenaline, and nerd rage. My FE handmade has the +250 dmg resistance and it bugs out at times which is why I think it‚Äôs all over the place
---
It was free when I got on an hour or two ago
---
Fallout 1st has only been out for four weeks - give it some time!
---
no its the foot ball players tackling the marathon runners. most people don't compete in a marathon everyone sort of encourages each other. Bethesda fucked up by trying to put them both in the same field. 
---
work shops are fun to build on and offer a decent amount of resources. most pvers actually help each other defend workshops and dont take them from each other. like marathoners we encourage each other. ie if I log in and I see a guy at a shop I want I will go visit and see if his defenses will teach me anything. then rather than take the shop from him or fight him over it I will log and go to another server. I want him to succeed. 
---
The pve community is much larger than the pvp community so social norms got established to leave each other alone. PVPErs however ignore those social norms because they can. because theyre playing a completely different game or just being dicks to be dicks. 
---
pvpers are toxic. yes they're playing the game as its able to be played but just because you CAN is not a justification. 
---
ie IRL a 200 pound man can easily knock gramma the fuck out and take her pension money. but people do not because its not a social norm, most humans love their grannies and most people would agree knocking granny out is pretty damned toxic. 
---
the pve population is far far bigger than the pvp population. the social norm was established long ago to just leave each other alone or help each other at workshops. then its usually one guy on the map shows up and goes around using an op unbalanced pvp build vs a bunch of lower leveled not optimized for pvp people. yeah the pvper is being a toxic douche wther the pvp community wants to admit it or not. 
---
Beth needs to strip pvp entirely from adventure mode. it does not belong. put the football team back on survival mode. leave the marthoners in peace on adventure mode. its a pretty simple solution.
---
PvP is practically inexistent. You really don't need worry. Also, the community is super helpful. If you're on PC we can farm fusion cores together, it will be fun.
---
There is not PvP. Except for the workshops. Keep in mind they only exist for PvP. You don't really ever need take one.  Just as informed in the tooltip when you claim one, they will attack you if you take a workshop. 
---
If you need fusion cores then the best option are the Sentry Bots on Whitspring. They have a weak point on the back. A stealth sniper on the roof can destroy all the robots without problem. Another option, much easier, is buy the fusion cores in player vendors. If you don't find anyone with fusion cores in your actual server then you can ask on the external community (aka reddit or discord) to help you.
---
If you really wanna take a workshop just keep this in mind:
---
-Don't build anything, except for generators and resources. You only will lose caps if killed.
---
-Don't participate in the "Defend... [location]" events. They are public and anyone can fast travel to them. After a while you will get a private quest to recover the workshop from the enemies (molerats, scorched, etc).
---
-If you are being attacked by players you can ask them for fusion cores. They probably kill you but could give you some fusion cores.
---
The weapons introduced in this game have all been pretty stupid. Death Tambo - really? War Drum looks absolutely rediculous. Black powder weapons aren't too bad but pretty much a gimmick. 
---
50 cal and LMG are pretty sweet but they are both based on real life weapons. No creativity here whatsover. 
---
And don't even get me started on wood armour...
---
Obligatory camp swap
---
[Welcome to Mystery Meat!](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AumjhRMuy2N1lIFtUBVcbAUaQiMZpg)
---
ski sword is pretty lame as well IMO. that crook on the end gets on my damn nerves. chop that shit off and make a straight stabby point already.
---
I would say at least 6000 caps.... I come from an actual trade discord.
---
It will be -20 where I live in January and February.  Eff that.  I want an escape from my poor choice of habitat, not a reminder.
---
Then snow shoes.  Or Frost bite.  Where does The melting snow go?  It honestly should all be radiated so we would trudge through radiation around our feet like a damn stream.
---
What about the water purifiers and hand pumps?  Are they rated for Frost?  Will the carb in the generator gel up and I lose power?  It's impossible to find a nice window for my CAMP! 
---
Would there be zero food spoilage as it's frozen?  We'd all run around with brain fungus soup all over our frozen snowy wasteland!
---
Alright, I over thought that....  But....  As they say....  Winter is Coming.
---
well after you take your break from the game due to frustration and come back just dont build to absolout max. leave a little open. just setting that limit a little tighter on yourself will totally fix the issue for you.
---
Holy shit, just had my first encounter with this armor... complete standstill for several seconds on my machine... 9700k @ 4.9ghz, 2080 Ti, 32gb DDR4-3600. If that isn't a testament to how much the acid effect impacts the game, then I don't know what the hell is.
---
The main reason it was full was I keep trying to get a full on cluttered look like an old flea market
---
But that doesnt make it cost more ammo
---
We're getting the ability to craft gifts for other players and receive them from events, check the data mined info.
---
Lol yeah
---
I think the  Uranium Fever  loot list is hosed... the only plan I've ever gotten there is the gauntlet plan... NO OTHER plan ever.
---
More power to you. I'm not hating. I'm just not hopping on 3 different characters for a trade lol. That's just my opinion.
---
Looking at some of your older posts, I don't think you ever had a Fallout 1st membership.  One month ago you were pretty well slamming Fallout 1st as a cash grab and P2W.  I'm going to have to call BS here - I can't believe after a rant like that you would then turn around and subscribe to it... All you did here with this post is continue your rant disguised as a Fallout 1st cancellation.
---
That is the sienna wallpaper. White wallpaper is 300 atoms and was just added today.
---
I've tried life saving multiple times and have never had it work. Tried all types of stims just to see.
---
Thanks, but I should have credited that one to https://www.map76.com
---
Good luck hunting wabbits. huhuhuhuhuh.
---
Can't, there's a limit of 5 characters.
---
Did you team up with your friend? If so then they got your workshops when you disconnected.
---
Ps4? On pc and haven't had more then a handful of crashes since April but i do hear it happens pretty often on ps4
---
Make the entire map WestTek. Every town is WestTek.
---
Yeah. PS4. And the third run we did somebody else bluescreened. It's unacceptable. We're using a private server as well
---
Changed maybe 4-6 months ago when they patched non legendaries dropping legendaries.  The bots signify the end of the spawn cycles.
---
Sweet. I'll be on tomorrow. If I catch ya then that's awesome. Working on a full unyielding set when I want to go bloodied for my poor little pistol build. Gonna work on Vanguard later.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
thanks!
---
No.  I just noticed off hand that they had joined my world.   No team up.  No change of hands on workshops.
---
Idk if you're in the right generation to remember quick draw Mcgraw or not. But it makes me feel a bit like him
---
They had a power armor paint red with Xmas lights on it and it had the sound of jingling bells when you run
---
Yeah, I believe it, good for you being the exception
---
It's not a single player game but everyone managed to lvld up regardless. Just don't invest into workshops unless you're ready to fight for it. It is a mixed bag... Somedays you can take a bunch of workshops for hrs on end. Other days your getting shot before the first defend mission.
---
One thing that helps is claim it build a box and store all your junk. Then just pop in to do defend missions and empty out machines. Don't spawn on the place but near by and sneak in. Sneak keeps you off of the map. Also use the multiplayer part. Make some friends or just ask someone to help. I can sometimes see shits about to go down with a high lvl running up to a workshop. I'll show up and let dude know and help defend. Good times. :) many survival players just want some action and im happy to oblige.
---
1. increasing the amount of legendaries you get on private would be farther into pay to win territory than beth could manage from a pr stance. 
---
2. I am ok with scrap box being sub only, I have played since beta and enjoyed the hell out of it long before scrap box was introduced. they sold me thousands of hours of entertainment for a decent price. demanding a scrap box as well seems like and entitle free to play mindset. its their product they can put a price on it. just dont buy it if you dont agree with it. 
---
3. more entitlement feet stampy free to play mindset on display. 
---
4. I just got the blackbird pa skin for my x-01 with my monthly. worth it. 
---
5. Tent is awesome as is for me. workbench would be an improvement but usually you can find plenty in the world. and since you can easily move the tent if you're struggling with weight on an adventure you can always stash the sedge hammers till you can get to your main camp. 
---
so you want more legendaries to spawn which is definately pay to win but you dont like scrap box because that is pay to win ? are you trolling or do you not see your own contradiction? 
---
and now that I have bitched at you its time to tell you why I am happy with my sub and try to change your mind. 
---
1. I use a laser gat, I have to farm full fusion cores or the laser gat glitches, private server lets me claim all three power plants and farm 20 cores per hour without worrying about hogging all the plants from friendly players or getting ganked by troglodytes. 
---
2. it allows me to safely transfer items between characters. I don't have to bug my friend to hold shit now. that's a win for me and my friends. 
---
3. I want beth to succeed because I like playing 76. before the sub I was trying to spend 20 a month to support them but often saw nothing in the atom shop I cared about, with the sub I feel like I am paying them a fair price for a desired service. IF beth fails for whatever reasons that may be it wont be because I was a freeloader expecting a bunch of free crap and never spending any money. 
---
4. the monthly atoms coming in has actually encouraged me to buy some silly things I wouldnt have considered buying before.
---
Screw the wife ain't as important as the cat.
---
I never do workshops so I never get attacked. 
---
For fusion cores don't forget to loot the used cores from power armor you find wandering around. You can also search online for where generators are located. 
---
Off the top of my head, theres some generators and a power armor set that spawn at the nuka plant. Also sone generators at the fairground with the roller coaster to the west.
---
Some good weapons are underpowered, like the pipe wrench. Love the looks. But I think guitar swords are great during the first three days of playing. 
---
I remember finding one when I was just starting, higher level than my level 8 character, and thinking "finally, a good weapon".
---
Well, I was talking about screwing the wife, yeah. I don't think the cat would let me
---
I just purchased a bloodied missile launcher and added the proper mods for my bloodied heavy weapons character. I forgot to set the Demolition Expert perk and killed a Mirelurk Queen in 4 shots. I always wanted to try the ML. It's fun so far. It may not be the most effective weapon, or the lightest, but who doesn't like blowing shit up? It made me smile.
---
VATS rifleman here and my vote is unyielding because all the extra perception
---
ASSERT DOMINANCE
---
And we should be able to keep hot dogs in our pockets.
---
Only if there are snowmen or snow folk monsters.
---
Define 'decent'. My commando uses a 38 Fixer. I kill 99 percent of things with it.
---
Two good options for fusion cores: 
---
1. Go to Whitespring, kill Sentry Bots, loot cores, server hop, repeat. This is the most efficient way to get FC‚Äôs, you‚Äôll get 3-5 per run‚Äîbut you need to be able to take down the bots. 
---
2. Use the power plant workshops, but don‚Äôt build anything. Just build a generator, power the FC generator, lock it and go away. Go back every 20 mins or so while crouched (also you don‚Äôt show on the map), get your FC‚Äôs and go away again.
---
Guitar Sword, all you can afford, Guitar Sword!
---
Even stores don't sell Hanukkah related items...what makes you think Bethesda will do an event? Christmas is too big it blocks out every other holiday...
---
As someone who celebrates both Hanukkah and Christmas...it's sad and depressing Hanukkah never gets any love...
---
The guitar sword makes me feel like the Six-String Samurai. Don't touch my guitar, man!
---
All I want is a fucking text chat...I'd rather have a working OFFICIAL text chat then any holiday event or hell...even Wastelanders DLC.
---
It's driving me fucking nuts. And yes I know about the damn mod. It breaks every time the game updates :/
---
Yeah, at this point stable servers will be sold in the Atom Shop.
---
I'm on PC, you can find me like Jorslato. I recently start a new character just for redo all the quest slowly, currently on level 16.
---
Do you happen to know anything about it crashing? My friends is loading just fine.
---
It works. I canceled and got a refund when it first came out and was able to use the server until it expired.
---
The Death Tambo is much the same.  It's comparable to an unmodded Mole Miner Gauntlet and weighs only a fraction of it.
---
It‚Äôs a fucking video game.
---
its because you have an xbox
---
Think it should be held the other way and be more an axe, but got a bloodies SS 1str one from purveyor, use it all the time
---
Fast travel to and event and back can fix it sometimes.
---
No point in hating just cuz someone has a different gaming console then you.
---
The Death Tambo hits as hard as the unmodded Mole Miner Gauntlet, but weighs only a fraction of it.  It also doesn't require any mods to be halfway decent, so it's a solid beginners Unarmed weapon.
---
As for Wood Armor, with the Shrouded mod, you're basically invisible to enemies if your Agility is high enough.  The movement speed boost when sneaking is also pretty nice (Sleek is comparable on other pieces).
---
No, sorry, but it done it to me a good bit though I haven't played for a month or so, I'd say check the Bethesda Forums.
---
As the other person stated, traveling to an event  or ally fixs it
---
Stealth doesn't hurt and can seriously increase the damage you do, but I wouldn't call it necessary.
---
nah i have xbox too. they suck
---
I just spent 12 hours building an airship. budget is absoloutly maxed, I have to delete the old sign to change a sign lol.
---
A Level 6 and 8 at the SBQ fight?  Cann't believe they could even get there alive unless with high level friends.  They could not possibly have a weapon which could make an impact on the SQB or the other high level enemies present.  I got killed after killing a Mirelurk King And Queen while still putting enough damage on the Queen to get her drops.  I was Level 166.
---
Well we had the queen killers with us so it was easy lol
---
I once had the game break on a foundation. Item was irremovable from the base. No biggie. I‚Äôll store the base and place it back. Well suddenly it was unplaceable. Then I started removing more around it to try and fix it. None of it could place again. Then I came to two foundations and walls which were completely immovable due to objects left floating. None of them could be removed. I had to start from scratch
---
Serves you right lmao.
---
Unyielding.
---
Yes, Bolstering's DR/ER boost sounds nice, but look at it this way.  If you're running Dodgy, Unyielding gives you more Agility, which means more AP, which means more chances for Dodgy to proc.  Not to mention heightened Strength will allow your melee to kill things faster.  Heightened Perception will allow you to VATS things at crazy distances with 95% accuracy.  Heightened Intelligence will give you an XP boost, among other things.  Heightened Agility lets you sprint farther.  The list of fringe benefits goes on and on.
---
I bought a month and will cancel for now, only because I've done everything in the game. I'm a little bored and will wait for the Wastelander's update. 
---
I've played since beta and here are my thoughts:
---
Pros:
---
1. I love playing alone in my own world. I do like to play with others, but when I'm on a mission, I want to be left alone.
---
2. Extra atoms to buy the stuff you normally wouldn't.
---
3. Scrap box.
---
4. Tent
---
5. Servers run way smoother
---
Cons:
---
1. Scrap box. I think it should be a thing for FO1st members, but they should increase stash size by 200 (to 1000) for everyone.
---
2. Tent needs a workbench. Of your choosing would be nice. A tinker's bench by default would be acceptable.
---
3. Enemies do not scale to your level across the entire map. We should at least have that option, but we don't.
---
This looks cool, but I will still not touch this game with a 10ft pole.
---
I realise, that's still a story unfolding, what are Bethesda up too, much like Twitch.
---
Fake news. LOL!  Congrats awesome feat!
---
I think it wld be cool to bring the winter climate in and have the SB hibernate underground. Then some sort of quest to get a new type of under armor to go into the fissures and take the fight to them in their weakened state only to have to face th SBking. Then have daily events were you go and kill hatchling SB in their nests.
---
Gotta worry about super mutant spawns there though, right???
---
Food buffs stack? Do you mean eating the same food more than once? Doesn't any food item with say 10% crit damage just go away if I eat a 20% crit damage or another 10% crit damage?
---
It's the PS4 that's unstable.
---
Would also recommend this. Widgeon does some excellent lore videos on fallout 76
---
Hahah, don‚Äôt worry man, I certainly do understand how world-containers work. It‚Äôs just that the *other* guy in this thread seems to be confused about them. I don‚Äôt know if you saw my previous comments, but he is now the 6th person in under a week to tell me he‚Äôs become wanted for picking the lock on a world-container while in a player‚Äôs camp. When asked whether they were picking locks in claimed workshops, each person said ‚Äòno.‚Äô
---
I don‚Äôt know how so many people have come to believe that, I‚Äôm just trying to be friendly and give them the notion that they might be mistaken.
---
This is absolutely amazing!!! Bravo, excellent work.
---
I like the idea of leaving someone a gift vs taking a gift from their tree. Means a lot more to me to give someone I know they'll love, but it's individual preference.
---
Nope, didn't work. Just moved my camp 10nft and then back, deleted the blueprint. Now I have but one floor attached to the stair, and it won't let me remove it.
---
Verify the game files? Not sure how it is done on console, but it might be worth a shot.
---
what mods for the death tamb9 are there though?  mine doesn't even show a 0\1 or antything
---
I'd honestly love it if they'd add some rock to the line-up. Or hell, even some rock-a-billy. 
---
But, what would make me the happiest is if the raiders that are coming start up some "Raider Metal" somethink akin to, I don't know, maybe G.W.A.R?
---
You have the right to bear arms plans. Get it right!
---
Good stuff. I love all the haters above with their technicalities. Congrats!
---
Unrelated question: how do you get your health to show in numbers next to your HP bar?
---
If you have the Marsupial Mutation jump up on the awning on the front of the Golf Club, go over the roof and stand on the back awning firing into the dining room.  You can kill all the Ghouls in the building without being damaged and the go in and loot them.
---
Junkies is a blast, especially on ballistic Bock and psychotats. I use AAE on another character and it's decent.
---
Makes sense for end game characters that have them unlocked and max charisma. They have a lot of variation in value though from watching the market a while. Sometimes what makes a currency is enough people saying it is a currency.
---
The cores have a tendency to drain from more than the one that's loaded, leaving you with a bunch of random charged cores.
---
 I made like 300 Ultracite plasma cores one time. Should have been enough to last a life time right? Wrong. I had to throw out way over half of them because they got glitch drained.
---
adorable fluffy. I would pet it. then pick it up and pitch it onto the couch. gtfo cat I got things to do. I have a dog. he pushes at my leg untill I throw the ball.
---
Aaahh that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening to me. I thought it was a reload issue
---
Inorder to stay afloat, they might need to raise prices either way. By increasing player volume, more sales might actually keep the prices low, which is actually the opposite of what you are saying.
---
Idk, I was looking at the legendary effects from fallout 4 and there's 5 tiers listed, so I imagine 4th and 5th stars won't be anything more than some cryo damage or +10 health or something
---
If you are in that situation get in the bus in front of the Golf Club, stand inside the door and keep firing, Stimming and taking Radaway.  Only one Ghoul can get at you at at a time and you will soon have a huge pile of dead Ghouls in front of you to loot when the horde is wiped out.  Really helps to also have Level 3 Fireproof because the bus will blow up.
---
4 unyielding, 1 life saver
---
If you go around with very low HP, it's hard to do crowd control with, let's say, a sledgehammer. Talk about defending from three stingwings, for example. 
---
Stealth is not for increased damage (unyielding takes care of that) but to stay hidden. 
---
Unless dying is not a problem. It is, in my case. I don't like to die more than once per session.
---
I think it runs off luck but I'm not positive
---
Well there is that as well, but not so much a bug as a feature. If you reload a half full core you're left with a half full core, think of it like a battery. You can put in a full one, but the one you take out will be left with what ever charge it had
---
Have a downvote for telling him how to read! JK
---
I like tambos but weapons with limited building possibilities suck and so does Beth for making them.
---
If you think the Gauss does twice the damage as a Lever (DPS) you are insane.  I‚Äôm one of the biggest weapon sellers on the PC, have access and have tested plenty of weapons.  I also play with some hardcore FO76 players.  I have yet to find a single player who will use a Gauss day to day over a Lever.  If you are delusional and want to believe the Gauss is double the damage of the Lever with zero negatives I wish you the best. 
---
I could take videos showing damage back to back, but it‚Äôs a waste of time.  The obvious thing is every player in the game who knows their shit, plays with a lever over an equal Gauss.  An Instigating Lever with transform how a Rifleman plays, the Gauss is pretty much a novelty and only the exploding ones have any real value since nobody uses them. 
---
Also, please offer me some great Lever trades for my TSE or BE90 Gauss rifles.  I‚Äôd like some 3* Instigating Exploding or 3* BE.  I‚Äôll pay top caps for them or trade you some of those Gauss.
---
I was meaning more the weapons and armour introduced in 76 are mostly rediculous, not practically. 
---
Fallout isn't meant to be too wacky and out there. Well at least it wasn't back in my day!
---
What perks and special stats numbers
---
It is not. I have 2400hrs on xbox1x and it works 99% of the time.
---
figures
---
Take rifleman perks, tank killer, concentrated fire, sneak skills, and vats skills
---
The thing is, is they don't care
---
If money is not involved
---
Of money wasn't involved they might care more but there just trying to get every dollar they can of the game
---
I have a character who uses the M79 as his main. Bloodied faster reload. So much fun. You tag and cripple most things. 
---
I keep a bloodied autogrenade launcher faster fire in the stash, because the M79 is fun enough. But also carry a Fatman to surprise players during events. Like, they are using their silenced handmades at uranium Fever and I start dropping nukes.
---
Don't get me wrong I understand the point of everything is to make money you know but there's something issues that haven't been resolved since launch and that's frustrating there Adam shop things I buy that still haven't been fixed so even the things I pay for don't work correctly
---
I try to keep fusion cores stocked in my vendor at 20 a piece. They sell at a steady pace, most people do not buy them all up at once because they take stash space so I usually have some. 
---
You can take workshops on a public server, it depends on who the other 23 people are. On less busy times it is less likely you get attacked. I went to private world though, game is running much better for me there and I can actually find magazines and bobbles, feels more like a fallout game.
---
Camden Park has two fusion generators, you can server hop to loot.  Honestly if you learn the locations of generators in the world (there are many) you won‚Äôt ever have to do a power plant to get cores
---
Yeah I definitely agree. While it's good to make money that shouldn't be the main priority it should be to make a functional game that people enjoy
---
This is Bethesda, like it or not. It's just something have to learn to accept.
---
These numbers real ? Was away 8 months and randomly joined a queen fight...i hit for about 1k, but that was not so bad after all then. Dcg +unyielding
---
Yea thats why I asked I dont wanna pay something way over.
---
Skyrim and fallout 3 and 4 definitely had bugs but it didn‚Äôt seem this level of broken
---
Ps
---
Really what price for those?
---
Marsupial and jetpack
---
Ya I had hit and miss private worlds, on average far better than public where you can almost guarantee anything of remote value that is free loot will be pillaged. But sometimes I seem to be on a streak and multiple rare drops occur and other times it seems barren.
---
I have tested with the highest damage Gauss in the game BE and a BE Lever.  You seem to have an insane love affair and are delusional about the lever.  I‚Äôd love to compare you vs me clearing a zone using your Gauss vs me using a lever.  Who do you think could clear it more quickly?  I‚Äôll one shot everything, reload faster, have no need to charge, and have *much* lighter ammo.  So the lever is better in EVERY way.  
---
There‚Äôs a reason virtually all rifleman builds use a lever (not a Gauss). It‚Äôs not because everyone is stupid, and you know better.  I buy and sell massive amounts of weapons, and I can tell you what is FAR higher in demand.  The only Gauss with any real value is an exploding one, and even then they aren‚Äôt worth close to what a good lever is worth.  
---
I really have no reason to debate more.  I have something like 300 ‚Äúgod roll‚Äù weapons I can play with at any time.  When I want the best sniper rifle in the game, it‚Äôs going to be an IE Lever, I VATS50 Lever, BE Lever, B VATS50 Lever, or Legacy Laser Rifle.   There are so many guns I‚Äôd rather have on a Rifleman than a Gauss.  If you love them, cool. They will likely be improved for Wastelanders.
---
Sure is! It can be a little tricky but I've climbed up their a few times! PA and jetpack help but are not required, Marsupial is a must-have though.
---
I switched from an anti-first to buying it. Convinced myself the private world may change the game experience and for me it has dramatically. Mostly in the reduced bugginess (which is still overall awful in this game).
---
However I got spare change to spend and Fallout is my all time favorite series. For most people I have trouble recommending the game and have to give a lot of info about it strengths and many weaknesses.
---
Dude don‚Äôt remap your buttons you can get banned for that
---
Unyielding all the way.  It‚Äôs the most overpowered armor in the game.
---
Even better!  Yes
---
Where can I find this data mined info?
---
I think 1k is good for those, but have seen them at 2.5k in other vendors... Still sales seem to have more to do with where your camp is rather than your  prices.
---
You have to pay 1600 atoms and send todd 3 nudes and youll be fine
---
Bear-ly worth it..
---
Lol idk what to believe
---
Nice tip!
---
I had a few multi-hour sessions with workshops. So far the biggest issue with private worlds is getting started, trying to join a friend fails numerous times until you get in which is very annoying. Once a game session is going solidly for about ten minutes it seems to go well from there.
---
Forking Beth, what kind of time is that to reset? Not connected to any other in game change, like daily atom challenges, annoying.
---
Like an elite controller for the Xbox? Yea that's fine.
---
There is some weirdness with workshops, the world creator dropped in my game and all their workshops went into unclaimed status but I stayed on the server and they were back within ten minutes so everything worked out overall. Few extra defense missions than we should have had.
---
Two shot is an average (at best) prefix on most weapons.  Bloodied is probably the best prefix on any weapon as long as you are willing to commit.  Most TSE weapons are way overpriced, and not great. I have a few that are good, like a TSE Gatling Plasma, but the BE Gatling Plasma is still MUCH better.  There isn‚Äôt really any TSE weapon that I will actually use.
---
I mean as a non-programmer all I think it would take would be utilizing a program similar to nuclear winter's, removing the death barrier, and adjusted the texture to snow while also setting it so it would effect the top surfaces. Course yes, that would take away. All that aside, it would be nice to see snow.
---
I am on PS4, JonathanYoshee. One issue a lot of players have is while they have done the same quests and events four times new players have not. So jumping straight to the quest rewards in a power grind makes the game feel even weaker.
---
So if you want to take your time and smell the roses a bit I do not mind teaming up. I am at your level too and am still surprised and interested into poking into the little corners of the world.
---
No, it‚Äôs Thanksgiving not Christmas!
---
Hows the critical thinking going for ya now? üëå
---
Take a rad-x and it is just a green tinted view.
---
They also had the luxury of modders picking up after them to make the games viable for the long haul. Sadly, the same cannot be said for this game.
---
Lmbo that's good
---
I want the stackable power supplies and that. Apparently Bethesda doesn't want my money. Not sure if I'm sticking around when week after week their is nothing I want in the shop.
---
I have fallout 1, butI wasn't aware that a  friend could join you uninvited, came as a surprise.   I will figure this out.  It's a real blow getting bounced from a private world server after two hours of setting up workshops.
---
I've got a TS FFR one that's a good bit of fun. The targeting computer makes it kinda comical.  In lower tier PvP it's a ton of fun. They can escape, lol. 
---
Side note:  the targeting computer WILL lock onto players in a SB or chameleon.
---
It takes several times, and thirst things first is the only quest that works. Its taken me.well over 40 times just to get the two i already have, but thats nothing compared to the hundreds of events ive done with no rewards
---
Its a quest you can do as soon as you exit the vault. Its called thirst things first.
---
Triangle on PS4.
---
Fan boys and people that can't except that they like a sub-par game. I like the game and played it a bunch but it's pretty obivious it has flaws
---
I have done 2 months straight of raids with very few major connectivity issues. Xbox, btw.
---
Maybe its just a PS4 thing?
---
What about special stats numbers
---
I'd like a clan system. It feels kinda lonely in the wasteland sometimes
---
I couldn't agree more. Scored more than a coupe today, one for 25 caps, üò≤
---
And I you citizen. 
---
I have been playing since beta. I am still collecting recipes and serum recipes but my main has been complete for 200 levels. caps mean little, legendaries mean little. 
---
I do need to maintain some income but I just don't care about minmaxing the price points on legendaries. so yeah I sell rare drops stupidly cheap sometimes. I got yelled at for selling a quad explosive harpoon gun for 285 caps recently. dude got legit pissed at me. "you're undermining the rares market" blah blah something something. 
---
/eyeroll whatever dude buy that shit and resell just get it out of my fookin stash and enjoy your bargain.
---
When are we getting real HDR support?
---
That would be great. It would be like New Vegas in which each one would display a prominent landmark in Appalachia.
---
Well I would be astonished if I came across a QE harpoon.. he should‚Äôve shut fuck upland grabbed itüòÇ
---
I‚Äôm just however talking about the easy scrip! I like being lazy some days ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Easy scrip for the event!üôåüèΩ
---
They've said the best optimised build is Xbox so it's possible. 
---
Every time we do it, somebody has to leave the vault then come back in. My internet is fine. I crashed 3 times in 1 day with nothing to show for it. Just unbelievable
---
Mainframe cores in the silo are hardly a problem, but in a timed vault raid having to manually click everything is not good.  We‚Äôre pressed for time as is.  I‚Äôm hoping this gets fixed in the next patch.
---
Only If i can kill them
---
Kill it
---
I'm guessing some people don't use the purveyor?
---
Because they want you to buy 1st to run it on a stable server
---
So funny! I had a good laugh reading that. Had a guy all mic'd up at my place today complaining about my overpriced armor. You get it both ways, too cheap or too expensive.
---
This sure beats the same jingles you hear in stores. Thank you for compiling this playlist.
---
Gotta love those lil fanboys. -_-
---
Then you would not be able to answer this since it can only be confirmed if you did not get it from event and subscribed to Fallout 1st
---
I have a CAMP in a satellite dish. We should hang out.
---
I got the legs plan! Now just the arms. Thanks again everyone.
---
I'd buy it if you're ever interested in parting ways with it lol
---
I will help as much as I can, im a level 80 and my wife is 108. Im bloodied rifle so i cant tank the pylons.
---
I did. That didn't even work
---
Same here. That was the first and last nuke I fired off.
---
Fill their inboxes with different tickets
---
Nothing in my vendor is over 100 caps.  Granted it's mostly 1c ammo because everything is sold, but expect less than 50 unless something seems super dope.  Reason:. Caps are easy.  Arm the people.
---
Tell me you are joking,
---
I once got a single bullet from one...but yeah it's not really anything to bother
---
I‚Äôve read on here it‚Äôs a charge 2 days before the atoms hit.
---
That's where you place the chair of shame. Then sit in it and cry since its now a permanent feature. üòì
---
Back on the Beat event in Morgantown *may* drop a Responders police uniform.
---
This
---
Thanks. I'll surely check it out.
---
How so? I'm running a release edition, cleaned out one time in 7 or so years, and very few games ever CTD. Except 76. 76 CTDs often. Seems more like, if thats one of my only games in over 100 owned, that CTDs repeatedly? Might not be the system.
---
Juuuust saying. &gt;.&gt;
---
After some update, don't remember which, I can zoom out an ungodly amount on PC. For me it's kinda useless. There is a mod method on nexus but I haven't bothered with it.
---
So yeah, it'd be possible if the powers that be chose to make it happen
---
Have yet to come across this, didn‚Äôt even know it was a thing. That‚Äôs awesome.
---
LMAOOOO
---
I cant tell if this is satire or not. You shouldnt have initiated pvp while carrying junk
---
Which headwear?
---
I'm 12 and not sure how to do this still being new to the game. I'm not sure how to. But now I just might try to find a way to.
---
Fucking awesome. Can you put in the Prydwen? I‚Äôm sure you can recant the lore to make it work.
---
Still crying lmao my eyes are going dry
---
The entire Liberty Prime series does this. They all talk with the same frequency.  
---
They're just employ their freedom of speech. Do you hate Freedom? Are you a Commie?!  
---
AMERICA WILL NEVER FALL TO COMMUNIST INVASION!!!
---
Sorry to hear if here‚Äôs some steps we all use, turn on pacifist and fill your stash with all your broken down junk components
---
Back in Beta it was from double equipping the skeleton mask (two masks in inventory) and would persist until you dropped or put one away and changed head items.
---
You could put on two skeleton masks, then slap on an eyebot helmet or such too and your head would be missing inside the helmet, or just run with the missing head and one way neck texture.
---
Well we did expert, we had to change and adapt. we also pulled a newer person though it though
---
I think your guess is on the money.
---
Given that a two star weapon gives you everything important, and the third star seems to be a sprig of garnish on the steak dinner, I‚Äôm guessing 4th and 5th effects will be really minor and mostly QoL or flavor related.  10% less hunger/thirst on armor, a tiny bit of bleed damage, stuff like that.  
---
Then again, the ‚Äú4th effect‚Äù on a Fixer is huge for a stealth build.  It‚Äôs like having a built in piece of shrouded wood armor.  Coupled with a sleek leg, it‚Äôs just shy of normal walking speed.
---
I'd rather sell my 3 stars on the cheap and script 1 and 2 stars so my legendary hunting can last longer lol
---
Have you tried powering down your console (if on console) and starting up again?  Whenever I have weird issues that seems to work.
---
I feel even with leveled enemies the game is cheese regardless, considering the legendary effects and mutations we can obtain. This is also not accounting for the weak AI as well, since most enemies just charge at you without any notion to tactic or preservation. Regardless I'm still entertained with mowing down low level mobs; I pop into this game for a bit to relax, not sweat out a session.
---
Never, but probably cause I never entered a nuke zone that I personally launched, let alone helped with.
---
I think they were free on the atomic shop recently
---
Ngl, I'd pay $20 for a cat waaaay before I'd shill it out for paints.
---
Aren‚Äôt you tired of regurgitating the same negative shit by now?
---
Make them look like something immersive. Gitty up buttercup maybe? üòä
---
Where is it located? Flatwoods?
---
You want a QE harpoon? On Xbox
---
Thats there spawn point.  They chill b4 being summoned.
---
Theres no point in me scripping anymore, I have the best gun for me possible in the game. vampiric ultracite ffr laser gatling. there IS no other weapon or even an upgraded version of that weapon in the game. 
---
some times I get a rare drop and just go play with it. I got a tse .50 cal and blew off a few thousand rounds for funsies. but then i tossed it onto the vendor. but other than that i am maxed out on everything. the only thing left for me to spend caps on is serum recipes and unknown plans. once I get all those I am not sure what I will do with income.
---
Are you logging in through the Bethesda launcher? If not, try this
---
Yeah seems like everyone wants to say script instead of scrip
---
I'm guessing double dipped gladiator/iron fist, double sneak attack perks, all the meat buffs, fury and nukashine?
---
I know the hook benefits from some weird stuff, but the best I could manage was about 15% health per swing when I was on a very off-hour Scorched Earth that was only attended by myself and the nuke sender.  I only had a couple meat buffs, fury and gladiator/iron fist.  This may have been before you were able to double dip sneak attack bonuses.
---
Have you payed attention to the numbers floating off enemies?  I think the highest I got was around 12000 with a B/SS puncturing power fist off a power attack on a mothman.  I haven't broken four figures with a meat hook.
---
Yeah.  Which means they're missing a neat little detail of the game, and how it ties into coal town history.
---
Dupers would screw it up like everything else they touch. Otherwise it would be an interesting thing to look at.
---
I would have to say I'm in a similar situation I guess. I have all my favorite rifles. I'm still hooked on scripping and the possibilities I guess. I still need tons of plans I think. I don't  think I actually know how to tell to be honest.
---
Pfft.. Shadow Prime = Protection of freedom. Hear his word, let him preach his gospel....
---
(Ive had it on since it came out.. My brainb is officially washed)
---
Knowing is half the battle.
---
It‚Äôs an invasion!!
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve seen people do that before. üòï
---
Ya an awesome collection that collects dust
---
People sell old corvettes out of barns for a hundred fifty bucks in some places still. Is that undermining the corvette market value?
---
Don‚Äôt forget you can take on sentry bots and get fusion cores.  I miss way back when the robobrains had them on them for loot.
---
You must be new to gaming
---
Make it a pet rock and you have a deal.
---
Doesn't make the sounds with the torso only? I may be mistaken then.
---
In addition to what others have said, I've heard you can use a Railway Rifle to shoot spikes into walls and climb on the spikes.
---
No, it does talk. I just happen to like the look, and don‚Äôt mind it talking.
---
Ark with private servers says hello
---
it‚Äôs happened to me twice (ps4). both times i‚Äôve had to delete the game and reinstall. just be warned that it will delete your entire photo gallery. i believe there are options online but none of them have worked for me.
---
Forest camo jumpsuit, leather coat, traveling leather coat, responders fireman outfit, fireman outfit, cowboy outfit, cowboy outfit with chaps, those are just off the top of my head.
---
Thought to be rare but aren't really, I see them at almost any higher level vendor I visit. Fireman helmet(available at WS vendor) green hood, whitesprings jumpsuit, longshoreman outfit, bos hood, bomber jacket, responders paramedic outfit, responders police outfit.
---
How much Video RAM and System RAM do you have?
---
Do you perhaps have a lot blue printed or stored?
---
What about "new" items or "clean" versions of outfits? Any info to provide..
---
Any good samarithan on ps4 selling a 3* be handmade for less than a bizillion caps and 556?
---
üôè
---
Keep it on pacifist and take a loop around the map after you save up some caps. Usually every PA located on map has a fusion core in it. Its a way to farm them where pvp wont effect you.
---
Ngl, I'd rather save that money for a game that works and doesn't fuck over it's players
---
1 bp, the 3x3 cube, nothing stored. Everything is placed.
---
Stash is full, but that doesn't effect build limit, does it??
---
No your stash should not have any effect on your build budget
---
I only know of a few and they seem pretty common to me. Ranger outfit clean and clean spacesuit come up a lot in my travels.
---
God I hope that didn't get added haha.
---
I'm at a loss here, honestly. I scrapped everything not a station.
---
Literally 3x3 foundation, walls, flat roof, x1 of each crafting station, a fusion gen, ind water pur, vendor, x7 plants (+- 1 or 2), annnnd x6 turrets? and a spotlight.
---
wires to connect, etc.
---
but.... that shouldn't equal some of the 3-4 story mansion i've seen packin x4 vendors and store bought decor out the bum.
---
If its not the scorch beats it's a supply drop. Lol
---
Are you level 50 or more?
---
If you are on pc, I can mod that for you with the puncturing mod, it looks like the power fist rebar mod.
---
yep. 73 or 74. just under 75 cause i didn't hit the challenge yet when i logged off again.
---
I have one of those
---
I can do that mod! I have learned the fixer plan and bear arm and bear arm puncturing mod and still have absolutely no luck with purveyor rolls.
---
Happy Cake Day! üéÇüéâüéäüéà
---
I'd probably put it up for ~4k, maybe a little less.  I'm sure someone would buy it for that.
---
I tend to overprice things lately though, so let a few other people chime in.
---
I have a hidden vendor in my CAMP that sells legendaries for 76 caps and when they are sold (with the 10% "tax"), I get 69 caps from it.
---
Most of it though I sell for about 275-350, depending the prefixes.
---
I would say, judging by what I‚Äôve seen on here, the rw effect is really good, but the bashing damage is useless. However, fixers are POPPING right now. I‚Äôd still say, to a junkies collector or user, you could get like 50k caps worth of stuff. MAYBE more. That would be my guess
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Are you on PS4? I‚Äôd love to stumble across that some day ü§£
---
I have the original and i don‚Äôt mind the voice lines. Bring more life to this world
---
Damn if I went by that logic my prices would be as high as me rn..
---
Which is pretty fucking highü§£
---
Unfortunately, no. I'm on Xbox.
---
Oh yeah? Why's that?
---
Is there anyway we can hear ir?
---
Okay there weirdo ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I don't care about the even I just want the update that was supposed to change everything
---
Yeah I've got no clue then man
---
Yea me either man. Thanks though.
---
This is heading into pun territory and I love it
---
Tattered field jacket, plasma grenade plan, stone bench plan, Hi-tech picnic table plan, tomohawk plan, and any of the 5 rare fasnact masks are things to keep an eye out for
---
I'd settle for the Nuclear Winter jukebox variety.
---
Yes it is. You haven't used one if you don't think it's OP. The explosive damage is far more than the 20% it should normally be
---
Thank u thank u
---
Yeah, get BSA browser and extract the recordings from SeventySix - 13UpdateStream.ba2.
---
Then convert them from .xwm file format to .wav with XWM Music Converter.
---
Alternatively you can join my discord server where I've got some of those samples on my datamine channel:  https://discord.gg/QAX3xd
---
What about if you use Stranglers heart power armor? Would tse make more sense because of more projectiles being shot?
---
I like to do my part!
---
See a vendor full of mixing crap 3* legendary and they are sell over 2k caps.
---
Like really?
---
Before I stopped playing I ran into a guy selling a 3 star pipe rifle (no good perks) for 10,000 CAPS
---
Yeah it's been nice to see them throwing some actual camp stuff in as freebies. Icons were very meh.
---
Knights of the old republic 1 and 2

Definetly oldies. But those are my go to games. Expessialy kotor 2 and fable tlc
---
If you feel the games mobs aren‚Äôt challenging anymore do PvP, nothing is as threatening as another player
---
Remember it‚Äôs a *** legendary. It can heal itself up at least 7 Times.
---
"no glitch" - uses exploitable bug
---
Get Kingdom come.
---
&gt;"you're undermining the rares market" blah blah something something.
---
To be honest I think the rare market prices are way too high anyway. Since we can only hold 35k caps, +/-20k for a weapon is ridiculous.
---
I wouldn't mind the cap limit going up though. If we could hold atleast 100k then 20k for a weapon would be reasonable.
---
There is a camp budget bug atm that keeps you at 100% you can scrap everything down to 1 item and still be at 100%
---
If you're on ps4 I can offer caps or trades
---
Outer worlds by the amazing Obsidian and original fallout creators
---
Maybe it's a badge? I mean we got ghouls carrying nuke codes...
---
i get this sometimes when using v.a.t.s. or coming out of fast travel.
---
Ark
---
If they are deemed garbage i will buy them, if not, then someone else will be lucky.
---
Bite the bullet and scrap everything so Blueprints and stored are empty, then check if build budget recovers to 0% used.
---
....well that sounds about right.
---
"It's a feature"
---
You can get an attack dog already, but they function the same as most pets and dies easily, especially since they are only level 1. The biggest issue with pets right now is that they die too easily compared to the amount of effort it takes to find them.
---
What's it say?
---
https://youtu.be/aq4Eud0t8PI
---
There's links to the Reddit posts in the description.
---
We kind of need an idea on what you've tried. 
---
Easiest answer is outer worlds, so easy I'm fact that it's probably part of the $100 you already spent. 
---
Maybe remanent from the ashes.
---
I think Bethesda has to recognize the monetary potential this game has microtransactions wise (Whether you love or hate them) and if their going to continue to bring in those dollars there are going to have to really ensure the longevity of the game 
---
That being said; 
---
I expect Wastelanders to not only be a sizable new piece of playable content but it's also going to be the start of what will effectively be an overhaul of the core experiences of 76.
---
Here's some things I'm predicting (Not necessarily with Wastleanders, but to start laying the foundation with Wastelanders):
---
With the addition of NPCs , I think Factions will begin to play a notable role in the wasteland. I fully expect that first we will see the Responders making up a notable chunck of this, and we will be tasked with rebuilding the Responders and will likely see some kind of small settlement associated with them.  
---
Faction related content is content players would happily consume, but it will also drive AS sales. Faction related camp items are popular, and when there's an in game presence to tie yourself to(Even unofficially by having a themed camp) that's a great opportunity for both player interaction, engagement and sales. 
---
I think this will likely also be accompanied with a new series of events similar to a horde mode where, instead of going raiding into a vault, you'll be tasked with defending settlements/faction areas. 
---
Even more interesting would be branching away from scorched/monsters for these horde mode situations and instead had opposing factions sometimes being the enemies you're defending against, and ideally Factions would be Joinable and they'd have a second side to those events where players were tasked with attacking settlements of opposing factions. 
---
Some kind of reward that's awarded/contested for factions who are successful would be even better. What that would be? I dunno. Small exp boost while your faction continues winning/defending these events. Dunno.
---
Yeah the taming system is trash. I miss my megasloth, RIP Snoozy...
---
Fuck the rares market!  That reminds me of those assholes on Warframe who were trying to artificially inflate Riven mod prices and would foam at the mouth about people "undervaluing" their own rivens for sale.
---
No one get banned for reporting exploits unless they used them multiple times. Don‚Äôt lie.
---
I'm guessing 'Company Tea' has mining origins but *The Google* this time has no info that I can find.
---
You are pressing the loot button to many times quickly which triggers exiting power armour 
---
Just slow down speedy when looting ;)
---
Only 3GB VRAM and 8GB RAM
---
They will kidnap beautiful women who are wearing skimpy dresses, the women may try to run but will trip and fall.
---
I'm sure it'll come in a patch... just like unlimited junk stash did.
---
"Unlimited decorative CAMP budget for subs, which is 100% unrelated to STASH, cause we didn't wanna increase server load, since that was our excuse for stash space, which you guys bought anyway."
---
It's hard to stay excited for Wastelanders...
---
Somebody please just find the dedi host, crack it, and let us right this wrong.
---
Well, I see a Commie on American soil...
---
You and I both know that‚Äôs a whole different animal with a different set of problems and quirks.  
---
My pvp build will merk most players, but only does ok at events while my main PvE sniper is effectively invisible and can kill boss level enemies in one shot.  
---
Putting it into different terms, my PvP commando is tungsten carbide while my PvE sniper is stainless steel.  I want a carbide kitchen knife as much as I want a stainless steel drill bit.  IE, two different formulas of steel designed for specific purposes.  One has an exquisitely sharp cutting edge, but needs to be handled like glass, and the other is reasonably sharp, can cut veggies for years and has cockroach level durability.
---
Raider one with graffiti and spikes. Everything needs more spikes, they need to hurry up with those Collectron skins.
---
Thats wht ive always hated them around. At SBQ so fkn annoying lmao
---
It depends on what it is, really. But for the most part, if it's a Nocturnal Wooden Arm with +1 STR and lower junk weight... eeh, 500 caps. I mean, what's the point of putting stuff like that in there for 15k? So you can sit on it forever and maybe one day in the next 3 months sell it? Hell no. Put it in for a few hundred and move it. Even The Unyeilding stuff with STR and lower item weights I only sell for 2500 MAX. No reason to be a complete douche and screw over your fellow wastelanders.   
---
The wife and I both laugh whenever we come across a vender with mags for 1000 caps or bobbles for 1500... Sure thing, dipshit... maybe some moron will buy it, but not this one!! LOL
---
The voice is the entire point ya dingus.
---
This is unbelievably cool and I‚Äôll definitely be giving it a good few run throughs come December 1st. Thank you!
---
&gt;My third and main account that I got during beta has been suspended for 180 day for harassment.
---
You got banned for harassment? What's the story there?
---
I‚Äôd like to see something like the Cellar from Skyrim‚Äôs Hearthfire DLC. Basically a floor door to a separate basement. Sure you have another cell to load, but you could do so much with it. 
---
You might even be able to have *TWO* smoke machines.
---
Honestly, I kind of hope they put a "present box" in the Atomic shop so that we can put various items in it as gifts for visitors to our camp. We can be generous and leave 3 stars legends in them or maybe a few bottles of Whiskey, a few stims... Or just be a dick and leave spoiled meat. LOL.
---
"Studios and developers know that only 0.15 percent of mobile gamers account for 50 percent of all in-game revenue, so they model the entire in-game economy to capture the 0.15% of players (also called whales). Additionally, a survey by W3i found that ‚Äú47 percent of total revenue comes from purchases costing $9.99 to $19.99‚Äù while only 6% of revenue comes from purchases ranging from $0.99 to $1.99."
---
"When microtransactions are the sole source of income, we start to build our entire product around that model."
---
https://www.intelligenteconomist.com/economics-of-microtransactions/
---
It won't keep the price low, and this is for the whole industry taking part in microtransactions. You are phycologically manipulated into behaving a different way in a F2P model. Why do you think games are trending this way? Its because its a 24 billion dollar untapped market. If you need proof, look for historical cost data for games like Farmville, Candy Crush, Clash of Clans, etc. Skyrim, widely acclaimed, one of the best selling games of all time, total revenue as of 2018, 1.3 bil. Candy Crush, 3.91 bil total revenue. 
---
F2P, great idea for *most* game developers, shareholders and companies, *TERRIBLE* for the consumer.
---
Sorry -- what does instanced mean in this context? Never heard that term applied to housing.
---
I've got a refund before after doing the same thing. They let me keep the item which was very nice of them (especially as it was a bundle.)
---
Which platform are you on?
---
FO76 hardly has a market to undercut.
---
There's no advertising, there's no central hub to list items at, there's no way to sell/browse across servers in the game, etc.
---
Appreciate the input, guess I'll keep trying then. I've saved one open character slot on the hopes I could do something like that.
---
"Born out of greed."
---
Well this is because they can currently only spawn as legendary when it comes to events and hordes. :)
---
&gt;Scrap box should be default and available to everyone who purchased the game. 
---
Disagree on this. For me it's kind of game breaking. But I also get that having to manage your storage and scrap isn't exactly a fun part of the survival experience. 
---
&gt;No new outfit. I expect a free outfit each month.
---
Agree on that -- little bit baffled why they haven't done it, I'd have thought they'd want to keep the F1st subscribers onside as much as possible, and it doesn't seem like it'd be that hard to implement. 
---
F1st just doesn't seem that good a deal to me yet. Have subscribers started getting special discounts on the Atom store yet? If I was running the scheme I'd give them a blanket 25% discount on all new items, and 10% discount on everything else.
---
Bolstering for ranged unyielding for melee
---
Like vault 94. Everyone on the server can be in the vault but they're not all in the same cell. The game creates your own custom one.
---
When u highlight a wall there should be another tab for wallpapers at the top
---
That explains it, your system relies on your disk space to allocate game stuff (textures, models, etc), in your SPECIFIC scenario, using an SSD actually improves performance because you don't game enough VRAM/RAM to handle the game, this also is the usual case where using super low modified textures actually makes a big difference. If you don't already use the lowest setting on Textures, you should.
---
Imagine being upset to find something for cheap. Wow.
---
Best way to stabilize prices on overpriced 3*'s? Let them release 4* weapons, or Todd help me, 5* weapons, and watch those prices tumble into the dirt. Couldn't give away that BE Fixer if I'm selling a Two Shot, Bloodied, Quad Faster Fire, Explosive, Vats Crits Less Vats Cost, Ultra-Mega Legendary Fixer 2.0. People crave the next best thing, and hand me downs become much more affordable for the common man.
---
Ok thnx
---
Meh. 
---
Good, but significantly over rated. 30 hour complete experience. Shallow weapon / armour pool. Poor story telling, especially pace wise (and they kind of ruin any intrigue/moral questions of the entire story about 5 minutes in).  
---
A bunch of systems that are borderline useless. A mod system that is so shallow and has so few mods it would have been far more efficient to do away with it and just make weapon drops with effects. A faction system that essentially is just a vendor price modifier. 
---
Companions are ok. Their motivations are weak. Stories uninteresting (Except the vicar).
---
The game is almost too over littered with Easter eggs, references and "inspiration". The game comes off less a unique experience and more a series of borrowed ideas and characters. Mostly firefly. The game is basically a less compelling firefly. Like nearly a complete knock off. 
---
Combat is unsatisfying, and engagements are repetitive. Despite Combat and Dialogue being 2 major components of the game, they do not offer equally satisfying play styles. Even "speech" characters are underwhelming as the game holds your hand to ensure you get exactly the outcome you want. There's no risk of failure ever. It makes meaningful choices feel less meaningful. 
---
Exploration is mediocre at best. Repetitive areas. Dwellings are nearly identical with no personal touches. Nothing feels actually lived in. No stories are told about occupants. Where 76 relies heavily on environmental story telling, OW has none.  Couple this with the shallow loot pool (except consumables, where there's 736363 different types that share a handful of effects) and it gives little reason to explore. 
---
The game rushes through its second act, and comes to an unsatisfying conclusion. The most compelling mystery is about earth and it's barely touched upon. 
---
I was a little disappointed. It was fun. Just not great. You hit a major red flag in the early stages of the game when you find yourself on a quest with a "meaninful" decision which is nearly an exact remake of a FNV quest and similar to a quest in FO3.
---
It also has its share of serious bugs. Unable to complete the final mission... A wonderful bug that in the end of game prologue it tells you one of your companions didn't survive the adventure (robbing you of their prologue entry) despite them being alive and well, even in normal mode where companion death is not possible.
---
And a super Nova (hard mode) that does nothing but scale up enemies and makes your primary combat focus not letting your companions get perma killed with a sleep/eat survival mechanic tacked on for no reason. 
---
OW is good. It got a big boost because of the Internet's hardon for having Bethesda. 
---
6/10
---
On the walls :p
---
Message me when you find bloodied explosive stuff, will gladly take that for 1k caps!
---
Free fertilizer for me, no worries there!
---
10k pc
---
Bashing worthless. Rw is preference but not bad. Junkies is very desired. So as a person who is a junkies comando.. Id bite at 10k-13k if i wasn't broke.
---
I'm gonna guess the cap in that case is about 65,535 before it bugs out.
---
The plans are around 10k just to roll for it.
---
Yes, thank you. I appreciate this too.
---
I guess then they will just up the price!
---
Ah right, that make sense, thanks.
---
Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen.
---
If the sale is reported to whatever somehow then yeah, it might effect the Kelly Blue Book‚Äôs valuation.
---
But what if I want to shoot your cat?
---
Could even throw in a skull and some blood spatter for extra measure.
---
I wouldnt bother with so many turrets if I were you, they use a lot of budget. Succulents do too for some reason.
---
Yeah, but then you have to live in the Ash Heap. Yuck
---
How do we find you?
---
You're like the worst kind of player for a community. Why would we recommend an alternate community for you to infest your time in?
---
The plasma Gatling is good as a 50 cal. Similar DMG and fire rate
---
So you don't get any voice lines with both the head and chest modded to a different skin? My helmet isn't using the Liberty Prime skin, but everything else is, and yet I still get overlapping voice lines.
---
I don‚Äôt know why, but the second I see ‚Äúbash damage‚Äù I know I‚Äôll just scrip it
---
I think it would depend on whether or not it was a simple housing setup in the vault or whether I could build and decorate the same stuff as outside. Sometimes my whole build is based off the environment. I do like the idea of the instanced player vault section, in *theory* we should be able to have a higher camp budget if it was instanced, which would be wonderful.
---
It was in the shop wayyyy before wild Appalachia was even announced
---
You're welcome!
---
I prefer the camps in the world. Would kinda kill some of the vibe if everyone's home was all in the same uninteresting place.
---
I would kinda like if bethesda made "plots" for camps in the world. Preset locations you could claim kinda like workshops but your camp will be there instead, and they could have several plots next to one another so we can actually make little communities.
---
Oh damn, I apologise for my ignorance
---
But the will be doing a Christmas event?
---
But if you have an explosive .50 cal, the Gatling plasma feels really underpowered
---
But obsidian can do no wrong! New Vegas was the best fallout ever! /s
---
Two smoke machines? Two? At the same time? Ohh, talk dirty to me. Tell me I'm a bad, bad camp builder.
---
And here I am with my adhesive farm of 30+ plants, 4 industrial water purifiers, 10 turrets, 4 vendors, work benches, fusion generator in a shed, and main home.
---
I guess I ain‚Äôt doing too bad
---
Get an explosive Gatling plasma üòè
---
Imagine no lifing such a boring game
---
Would fit. Never felt nearly as often disappointet as on christmas in my childhood...
---
I'm always over the daily limit for scripting and normally once a week I go and turn in my 900+ script and of course still sitting on a pile of legendary weapons and armor. And with private worlds it's compounding exponentially lol
---
I use strangler heart power armor and it crashes my game when I tried using it üòÑüòÑ
---
I only went to her once and the gear I got was not worth the gear I scrapped XD
---
OF COURSE!
---
‚ÄúOr Todd help me‚Äù. That made me laugh.
---
Crashes everyone‚Äôs game.. you should say ü§£ü§£
---
Ahhhh makes sense, didn't think about that.
---
Lol, it was pretty good control wise though.  I felt like I had an advantage from driving in inlcement weather when I was getting started IRL.
---
You can only place 1 of each type, so 1 holloween bundle and one from the mothman bundle
---
I wrote it just a comment before, they don't really touch you unless you go to them, and they respawn every time someone comes around. I loved it, had at least 5-6 legendaries at the end of a game session
---
They drop Aid items in Nuclear Winter all the time, but in adventure they only seem to have a minuscule chance to drop like a single cap or bullet.
---
Thank you :)
---
Only 2K? Oh, sweet summer child. [Prepare to rage.](https://i.imgur.com/nK3jMvU.png) I go to this guy's base when I see it just to drop raw rubber, raw fertilizer and a "You have been insulted!"
---
Show me! :) I loooove to exchange building ideas
---
Your best bet is to buy legendary weapons unfortunately, either from market76 or player vendors. Other wise you will just have to pray to rng-esuse that you get a decent drop. Crafting weapons can get you threw to level 50, but after that for true end game content you will need legendary weapons and armor
---
 If your on PS4 come stop by swamp shooter some time! My shooting range south in the mire.. well get you ready and trained for all the mires monsters! ü§ú
---
That is exactly how I price mine. What is the point of a overpriced item sitting in your vendor for weeks...?
---
Im on xb1 your on pc aren‚Äôt you?
---
Curious, which one are you referring to? Surely not the meat hook? If so let me know where Beth has said this is not working as intended.
---
Lines of excel?
---
As a dedicated CAMP builder I would still want to build a CAMP in the world and try to make it as detailed and set in the environment as possible as I do now. I don't move my CAMPs and probably still wouldn't. Only reason for me to build in an instanced vault would be to build and decorate a vault. I love my Vault 88 versions I've built in Fallout 4 and probably would for each of my characters in FO76 too.
---
As good a guess as any I guess :)
---
Great job mate!
---
Played like 10 hours actually. Was a beautiful game I just dont have the time to master all those combos.
---
I'd love that hillbilly version! I'd put it in four of my five CAMPs!
---
Thanks! I am a native Russian. Just since childhood, I studied English. In addition, the English language is taught in our schools. In general, the English language in Russia is almost the second language.
---
If you have any vending machines, i‚Äôll definitely shoot down the range! add me if you‚Äôd like, my username is ExoCranked.
---
Correct on gladiator/iron fist, but the hook does not benefit from the double sneak the way Powerfist etc does, (The video shows this, only \*3)  Although they are all critical the major damage buffs are Nukashine and Revenant, both a double edged sword, you have 2 minutes to do the major damage.  
---
 Using this buff you can get real crazy numbers against standard mobs - 
---
[https://imgur.com/Ou9Modl](https://imgur.com/Ou9Modl)
---
It's obviously not the system. The key here is [optimization](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_(computer_science)). Bethesda never cared to optimize their games for PS systems. Remember the save file problem with FO3 and the terrible launch and DLC [release](https://gamerant.com/skyrim-dawnguard-update-bethesda-release/) of Skyrim on the PS3?
---
That is one of the sizes used for variables. I guess that if higher damage number delivers less damage, it is because it somehow rolls over. But I might be completely wrong, wouldn't be the first time üòÇ
---
Gratz on the achievment though.
---
My vendor is always full of legendaries, ammo, plans, I will send you a FR with a message later so you know it‚Äôs me! 
---
Feel free to join my server whenever I‚Äôm on and take a look and take a shot! 
---
(However beware if I‚Äôm on my other character at the time you‚Äôll instead find a plushie factory near Camden park!)ü§£
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Good looking out, mate!
---
Very nice what Buffs did you use?
---
I don't care. Would still get it. I'd just have to kill a lot of robots with different weapons.
---
Hey man, you made me laugh at work.
---
AQBout a grand each as well, form what I've seen.
---
They dropped less often than the pumpkins, but there were fewer of them and not as in-demand, so the price is about the same.
---
.
---
You got 5 pumpkins per death cutout, so that's the 1K vs 5K price.
---
The outfits were the same rate (10%) as the cutout, but there were several things that could drop out, so each one is at least twice as rare as the cutout, so the higher price.
---
If they were normal events, the prices would be much lower (Like Mutton recipes are CHEAP), but since it was a one-off, the prices are elevated. The stuff will eventually bottom out once the dupers get ahold of them and flood the market (Just this morning, I had a visitor to my camp who was wearing the red Asylum outfit with the red Faschnight mask that was never given out but nabbed from the Dev room and duped in small numbers. Last week, the Vault ‚Ä¶ 79 I think it was? And a few other plans got yoinked and massively duped.) ‚Ä¶ selling things before they crash the market is the big trick.
---
Correct, you don't get any voice lines as long as you don't use chest and/or helmet. If the sound still overlaps even with just one piece (I never tried that, as soon as I figured I had to remove both pieces I did), the issue might be just that, the sound overlapping no matter what you're wearing.
---
Again, show me where this has been confirmed as an exploit/bug  
---
 I'm  just going to cut and paste what someone else has said on this thread -   
---
"It takes removing one keyword from the record (probably the one handed keyword unless you want people in PA using this weapon) to fix it and it was reported in November last year!
---
One year and they have not removed a single keyword - if you have the CK open a 10 second job including the time it takes you to find the relevant record - that would have no chance on having a knock-on effect on anything else.
---
At this point one has to read 'working as intended' and move on."
---
I‚Äôve never noticed any of those sound effects. o.0
---
A little from A, a little from B.
---
There's nothing wrong with a little profit-seeking, but when things get out of hand, the dupers come in and decimate the market, leaving a risk-reward cycle in there. I was lucky enough to get a coupe of spares of most of the stuff because my vacation was that week, so I ran the event about 60 times in all. When it was ongoing, people were selling some stuff cheap that was easy to get (like the lanterns!), but when the event ended, the prices started climbing up. They'll go back down later.
---
The things that generate regular sales for me are junk, magazines, and, oddly, canned dog food. I can never keep the stuff on the shelf.
---
Bethesda has heard your request, and will be charging 1000 Atoms for a Snowglobe plan in the Atom Store!
---
Wait...what event ? Is it confirmed?
---
Outside of this 20 second window with the queen it must rank as the least practical build you could imagine.
---
On PC, the only problem I can ever recreate is a hard freeze while going through the animation of exiting power armor.  I've lived through it a couple times, but that's the rare exception.
---
Firing hundreds of explosive rounds through a F/E LMG doesn't cause a hitch.  Tons of ghouls at the end of Meltdown with multiple people using explosive heavies and shotguns, no sweat.  If I want to exit my armor to repair or make more ammo at the mid-point, I'm almost guaranteed a ctrl+alt+del to forcequit the game.
---
When getting low on normal cores, don't feel like looking  for them and have extra flux I save a few almost empties and craft ultracite cores with super duper. They work in power armor too and depending on intelligence last longer too...
---
I'm sorry to say, and I don't mean to be rude, but perhaps you're not cut out for online multiplayer gaming. 
---
Don't carry your junk on you, don't PVP if you're carrying something you would miss, and put pacifist mode on so you don't accidently instigate PvP.
---
Oh man. Thank you for saying this about the robots. Me and my friend thought we were friggen crazy that we forgot the robots could be crippled and that we forgot.
---
It was very annoying having them lose both legs and hobbling wasting time.
---
Mr.House approves :P
---
I Love it! I only have things to sell in my vendo because I like when people visit my camp! Makes me happy! üòÉ I got some great teaming out of it!
---
Looks like you stumbled on to the nesting grounds of the rare Cargoboticus Appalachius. A lucky find indeed! Be careful though...while typically non-aggressive, these majestic creatures can be deadly when protecting their young from predators and other perceived threats.
---
No, I used something that is working as intended that is often mistaken as an exploit, and will continue to until Beth says otherwise. 
---
 I've provided my reasoning why I, and others, think it is. The only argument I've seen against is "It hits too hard" and of course your strong argument "Because I say so"
---
It is not broken.
---
I put here what another user has written about stuff like this: "Show me where Bethesda has confirmed this as a bug/exploit."
---
"It takes adding one keyword to the formlist of the achievement (just the enitity ID of the SBQ) to fix it and it was reported and day after this was added about half a year ago (or more)!
---
Half a  year and they have not added a single ID to the formlist - if you have the CK  open a 10 second job including the time it takes you to find the  relevant records - that would have no chance on having a knock-on effect  on anything else.
---
Woops, that other user is actually OP when it comes to bugs/exploits that work in his favor...
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and interested haha
---
Now dont u be scaring my customers , i live up ne in a treehouse by myself
---
If you are so confident please give me your IGN so I can report you.
---
Lol, although I have to say I love fighting queens when someone is using cryolator.  
---
 Rifleman to cripple her wing, Mr Freeze to keep her grounded, bloodied Mike Tyson to finish her off, thats the dream team.

We had alpha lose both legs at one point. He dragged himself to his 2nd designated workstation and suddenly grew new legs when he got there. Hopefully this post gets the attention of the devs, me and my friends are going to attempt expert but the pump code section just seems impossible without being able to break pipes so fast.
---
First they need to fix the turrets firing upon your camp.
---
Sure, what's your PSN ID? Also, I'm not sure how currently possible my build is as I made it like 7 or 8 months ago and haven't really played much since.
---
Not sure if they've patched it to the point that it's still doable.
---
whats your gt, cos ill come visit! only get to play a couple of hours a week so anyone selling legendaries for low prices will get a visit from me!
---
I usually go around camps to buy legendaries, if I found that harpoon gun for that price, I would've been grateful for such a good deal
---
One day it's my dream to get a vampires ffr gattling laser also
---
Unfortunately my pvp guy has never even shot the queen, which hits the crux of my problem with the character.  The more I played PvE, which has always been at least 80% of the time, the more I realize what a waste of time it was to build an untouchable  PvP character.  I put so many resources into that guy, play him once in a blue moon, and he sits there like a beautiful Ferrari that rarely hits the track.  90% of my good legendaries were used to build that guy up, but at most I played him for an hour a week.
---
With the 25% sale and wanting a B/SS bear arm, I was tempted to sell off his legacies for scrip.  If it makes sense, I'm now vaguely ashamed at building up a "perfect" character and investing so much into gear just for the sake of one-upsmanship instead of intelligence and skill.  It feels like a hollow victory, because no real satisfaction is gained from blasting the ground with an explosive laser gun when the other guy almost always has a pea shooter.
---
Got off topic, but I'll probably gift the cryolator to my heavy gunner so that I can use it for the good of the community instead of lukewarm ego gratification.
---
No, for once i actually wasn't, i was probably 75 below my limit
---
what a nice comment. would give you more upvotes if i could. but some dudes these days just want to fight against everything as it seems.
---
its this psychological behaviour that there is always another person or company blamed for the problems someone has. its easier than to say "i might be the problem". whatever. have a nice one!
---
It literally says friends only. Or something if the sort. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You didn‚Äôt read everything before subscribing? 
---
Bethesda announced they were working on getting persisting workshops so just chill lol.
---
I would suggest you keep that ferrari in the garage until Wastelanders drops, we don't know what it's going to bring, but the word "factions" hints at extending PVP into the PVE arena.
---
And there's me thinking there was a limit to how high you can build a CAMP site? I stand corrected.  
---
Amazing build.
---
That would be fun, but i dont play with anyone cause no one is really on when i am. But i dont know, it did kinda kill what i was doing at the time and i really dont want to end up messing with the stuff again cause i was click happy on someone's punch bowl lol
---
I think he means valley roof sections, or "inner corner".
---
Yes! The arcade machines from the creation club would be fantastic!
---
No glitch and then proceeded to say god hook. Am I missing something?
---
Meat hook double dips. That‚Äôs a no go in my eyes homie. üëé
---
Remember that if u like something in this shitty game you have to spend real money for it, I've threw it on the bin long time ago for this reason, those idiots want our money but they are not  even able to make a decent game
---
I miss half width walls too. I want to be able to build small toilets, not huge bathrooms everytime.
---
I can't honestly remember the last time this happened, if ever. (Playing only on PS4).
---
They did numb nuts. Literally in the last patch notes.
---
You are welcome to join us if you are on xb1. We usually play this time of night.
---
That‚Äôs not even the best meat hook to use for a one shot queen kill. Once they‚Äôre patched everyone who paid for one will be sitting on steel and wood. Lol.
---
Not one shot.
---
Nope. Not one shot.
---
Their last patch notes. But maybe you were lookin g for too much pepper to read them lol.
---
Use mysterious saviour for revenant. You do t need team m8ts for a proper one shot.
---
They are random spawns on Graham, so you need to find him and you need to have some luck to be able to buy them.
---
Very sound advice, and well worth noting.  I think I‚Äôm 100% into PvE now, but it would be foolish to destroy something that NEVER shows up on PC trading, despite all the duping.  At least I can loan it to a friend that might enjoy the absurd power for a while, or unleash on a trio of easy SBQ runs for a few servers before running out of ammo.

---
Main characters, level 180 and I‚Äôve got 15k caps atm. I‚Äôm gonna be saving them up, as I pretty much have everything I need for now.
---
Disagree, on actual fights like SBQ or simply common mobs, it do way less damage, compared to the .50cal.
---
I've seen people selling 1* legendarys for 3-5k caps, wtf!
---
Unless it's really decent, most of my 3* are between 650-1250 caps.
---
I'm on ps4
---
Honestly, thanks to both of you for that conversation lmfao
---
Building up in a tree, I wanted to move the stairs that leads up to it. So I build new stairs and delete to old one, this way there are no floating parts. Game wont let me delete the old stair. After trying multiple different ways I gave up, and decided just to delete the new stairs, the game wouldn't let me delete the new stairs.
---
If they don't want it to work then at least remove it!
---
Proud to be a Member of the Fallout 1st Club.  
---
Never received any free junk, but then again I never noticed anything missing from my scrap box.  
---
Looking forward to new 1st only items in the Atom Store, hopefully a Fallout 1st flag, either on a pole or preferably just wall mounted.
---
I want any skin for scout honestly,to prevent dropping.  But black...i never understood the attactiveness of black.
---
Making some corn soup?
---
Yeah, I don't play much in this area but its ambiance is unique. Lore wise, the whole region is alive, plants are alive too, thx to the GECK (vault 94 lore). You can clearly find some evidence of this in Harper's Ferry terminals and in the event Heart of the Swamp.
---
I particularly love Tanagra Town and the haunted church.
---
Agree to differ on the hook, lots of replies on this thread from multiple people with different points of view, you will not be shocked to learn I lean towards the working as designed based on zero feedback from Beth on this.
---
Nick's detective outfit and the deep dea diver outfit would both interest me
---
You have to pay more $100 to Fallout 2nd! IoI
---
Technically not solo either as I was in a team :) Still, it's a good 99.9% of health done by a single toon, I'm happy with that. Unfortunately her AI mechanics mean you have to get her attention to land, I think its great that this is not perfect and someone down the line may land a full true 1 shot, but given what would be involved, I'm not holding my breath.
---
Either way I think purveyor would not be the way to go, chances of getting what you want are super slim, better off trading the PVP for PVE gear if thats what you want.
---
Doesn't AGI boost your stealth too?
---
\^ This.
---
We REQUIRE enclave stuff, it's the only reason i've been saving up atoms and grinding almost daily for them.
---
I was joking lol. Unless that cat or dog is bringing me bloody meathooks or qffr Tesla‚Äôs it‚Äôs cosmetic onlyüòÇ.
---
Weapon is only have the equation, the second are your perks which you still have a lot to unlock. What do you use now for weapons and perks (ie rifleman, barbarian, commando, unarmed, etc)?
---
You stored your stuff rather than scrapping when you moved.
---
Found the communist
---
Two shot explosive fang
---
I have put different stuff in my bowl. For one CAMP I tried to imagine what would make the best puch bowl and put in wine, lead champaign and vodka. It's a pity you can't add ordinary nuka cola.
---
I considered editing it but was interested to see how much heat it would get lol. Fo76 sub been getting weird last few months.
---
Thanks, got the refund!
---
Thanks got the refund!
---
15k easy.
---
Any is not good enough - dataminers already found new skins for scout armor which is blue-orange-yellow camouflage. There is a problems though: it's ugly as F#@K (like someone's puke) and it's quite opposite to camouflage...
---
I've played since launch and was only once killed for my workshop. So not often. Most players will rather help than attack you.
---
This is a clear case of pay to whine.
---
I heard turrets take a lot of budget, then lights and electricity connectors 1% budget each, maybe you have a complicated electric grid?
---
Nah son. It just spams its damn self haha
---
I saw them and apparently i like puke.
---
Thorn and solar armor have a similar pattern under the foliage,which is not that bad.
---
Doesn't really matter to me. I'm looking for Bethesda to fix the game before worrying about what's in the Atomic Shop.
---
Is that rare?
---
Taste... Everyone has their own ;)))
---
I'm on PS4 and my original character would have LOVED a quad-poon!!! It was kinda a joke with my crew that my first (good) legendary was a medic's exploding harpoon gun they they twisted my arm to go heavy-explosives build and it kinda worked for a while.
---
All good advice. But.
---
" Keep in mind they only exist for PvP "
---
I've claimed workshops, just for building. Don't want to mess up my camp or don't have resources to try out build idees or make blue prints for popup camps, I used workshops. When low on ammo, food or resources like lead, I've claimed 4 or 5 workshops in one session to farm lead. Only killed once for my workshop since launch.
---
I have found that when I build a new camp, as I did yesterday, that if you put up all your wallpaper before you run your power and decorate you can then change the wallpaper designs later without the game removing any of it.
---
Fix the game first, then worry about 1st and the Atomic Shop.
---
thanks for that info i will try that immediately
---
would never had thought about that üòÖüëçüèº
---
Get the matte black paint. Its sleek.
---
I have to admit that I'm a prepper when the Purveyor is having a sale.  I had a little more than 4000 scrip to spend yesterday.  My luck was shit, but not for lack of trying.  I must have blown all my good karma on the Clean Appalachia sale, where I got two bloody Fixers and one Junkies.  I was hoping for a B/FFR/reload 50cal for Ronald Ulysses Swanson III, but it wasn't meant to be.  It's RNG, so I walked away with a shrug, not a grudge.  I did get a V/E/250 combat shotgun, so there's definitely a build around that with the upcoming 250 effect patch.
---
Uranium Fever, Leader of the Pack and Scorched Earth will be there tomorrow and the purveyor doesn't just stock bloody weapons during Black Friday.
---
I think PvE armor is way more valuable now.  Great 3 star armor has always been the most valuable, because less players are scripping for it and five matching pieces are far rarer than one gun.  Everyone is scripping for guns.  I have a B/E/reload Fixer and I still scrip for a Bear Arm.  At best, PvP armor has remained constant, and very niche.  PvE heavy gunners are best served in power armor, and stealth builds gain nothing from cavalier/sentinel effects.  Uny/poison/sneak armor was worthless a few months ago, but now you can name your price for one piece.  The fact that B/E handmades still hold highest tier value in spite of PvP nerfs and legendary Fixers is testament.  Faster fire is by far the more desirable PvP effect, but explosive ammo is still arguably a better effect for PvE and group play.  I'm off track again.  Of course an uny/whatever/sentinel armor piece is still in high demand, but I traded my first few uny/whatever/sneak pieces during the spring.  No one wanted them.  Now I'd be more than happy to trade a very good B/E weapon for a uny/ag/sneak sturdy armor piece.  My uny/ag/sneak forest scout chest took me a while to get, and I certainly overpaid for it.  I was just happy to top off my full uny/sneak suit and bring my agility score to an even 40 without temporary buffs.  Of course I traded it away for an uny/poison/sneak shortly after Vault 94 went live, but I enjoy the constant hunt.
---
If llyou look at the floor in one of the shadow prime pictures,you can see what seems to be a enclave floor.  Maybe it's getting close.
---
Valid question.
---
'Sure that'll be $16 please'
---
PvP in general was badly implemented. Not only are there no incentives to PvP, it also goes against the lore.
---
They will never do it once a week. Word was they were considering a new outfit once a month but I agree I also expected something yesterday.  I will keeping with it ad I like my box and the atoms but I do want to see something else in the store as well.
---
It's coming in the first quarter of 2020, there isn't a long wait left
---
Heck even on public servers I often find 0 legendaries at west tek.
---
Thanks for the response. I'll give it a little bit and see what happens. I don't want to lose my photos but I will if it doesn't start working.
---
It's a quest reward. Not rare.
---
Honestly, just buying decent legendaries from vendors might be a good start. 
---
Not exactly what you wanted to hear, but it‚Äôs basically a guaranteed spawn!
---
You just assumed her gender.
---
Yeah, Responder Police Uniform, Responders Paramedic Jumpsuit and Fire Breather Uniform are all rare.
---
You can only get them doing quests that are not repeatable.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve thought that but never can find a decent legendary with any of the vendors!
---
That I did, we all can't be perfect
---
it's a small price for freedom my dear friend...
---
If you‚Äôre on PC I‚Äôll be glad to help you..
---
thanks, but not on pc :/
---
1. how to do at your level = heal salve tanking - from vault 76 to south of flatwoods pick every red and blue flower you can find, green thumb perk helps. turn it all into heal salve. then go get raider power armor level 15 a complete set to protect you from the radiation and blunt force. then get the best ranged weapon you can. then go to the pumpkin farmhouse. there is a fissure there. there are buildings you can use for cover you can server hop to kill the scorch beast for your promotion. 
---
2. the enclave uniform can be bought when you finish and have access to the military wing and you will get a free uniform when you complete. yes x-01 power armor plans and mods are  found in the production wing including a sexy AF army green paint job. 
---
3. orbital weps are not worth the headache. plasma are infinitely easier to come by and almost as effective. 
---
4. med bay has chems, scince has mutations, production has PA , military wing has weps and pa mods, etc. its a lot you will have to explore. 
---
5. well. i feel like you are probably rushing things and should just hold off on the main quest and just go play around some and build up more levels and better gear. you are basically smashing yourself into a wall to rush through. its doable but I predict pain suffering and stress. but if you're into wall smashing with your face have at young lad o7.
---
Sorry but yeah you‚Äôre gonna have to shoot it down..
---
Yeah, if you have a mic, you might be able to work out a deal with a vendor. Sometimes they prefer trades to caps. You could offer ammo in addition to caps and they might be willing to part with unlisted stuff they have.
---
Try to hit the engine/propellers. Tried a rocket launcher?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve recently been stockpiling my ammo for this reason! Thanks for the tip my man
---
Fact is Unyielding is what makes Bloodied builds so powerful. People act like the dmg from Bloodied weapons it what makes it OP but really its that nothing compares to +3 on all stats except End, nothing. With 5 peices? +15 on all stats except End. Nothing compares.
---
Use a missle launcher. When i did that mission i picked one up from a dead mutant.
---
Yeah, someone suggested targeting the engine/propellers but I just don't think my guns are accurate enough. Even when it looks like I'm getting direct shots, basically nothing happens. Gonna keep trying.
---
And rocket launchers are just not accurate enough for when the thing moves around so fast. I need one with targeting.
---
I'll try it again
---
Buy those damn things. Plenty of people have them for sale cheap enough. It‚Äôs just not worth the hassle (from a fellow melee/shotgun user).
---
You can display some masks and hats in the glass display cases
---
You got a complemantary outfit each month, so far.  One in October at the release and another one (Ranger Urbam) the first week of November.  December is next week, so let's see what that will bring.
---
You got dat source?
---
Ah ok, I thought you were talking about the current sale going on.
---
Server stability is not the same as client stability which is the issue here
---
Oh sh*t lol I forgot about toxic valley probably because I hardly ever go there.
---
When Bethesda put both fog machines in the same build slot the made it where you can only put 1 down. Those who have 2 set out, if you want both out then dont remove one.
---
Bethesda screwed this one.
---
I bet you saved a lot of time on facial customization.
---
Not anymore. Its 1 or the other
---
It's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas, so let it snow,  let it snow, let it snow! 
---
Dashing through the snow on one mutated Scorched open sleight, Scorched beast bells, Scorched beast bells all the way! Lol. 
---
I wish you, and everyone a very mutated Christmas!
---
Not as of last weeks patch
---
Definitely gonna upgrade my RAM to 16GB after Christmas and I‚Äôm thinking of getting a GTX 1070 8GB too! I don‚Äôt want to spend too much but I do want a decent computer
---
Something that is a quest reward, and can be received within first 60-90 minutes of the game is not rare by definition.
---
Thanks! If I play in one team with a friend, can he also see my Enclave events if he isn't in the Enclave? Bots on parade  - it might have been an event we failed yesterday (weak scorched but too many of them). I don't remember the exact name of the event and my game client isn't in English. 
---
A friend of mine was the first to notice this event. He said "there's an event where we must protect a robot" and we teleported here. It happened before I completed my military training and took the "officer on deck" quest, but I could already see some Enclave events, most of them were in high-level areas.
---
You can add nuka cola dark
---
A shotgun and rank 3 Enforcer perk easily break those propellers. Once it slows down, equip your favorite ballistic weapon and shoot it down. I farm many nuke cards this way
---
2^32
---
If you give me ur credit card info I can get you fallout for half off.
---
I'll be building or just scavenging and the armor shouts "RED COMMUNIST THREAT DETECTED" and it scares the shit out of me. I love liberty prime though. I did not know, however that voice was server side. What a strange choice. Let everyone hear the words of America's last true patriot.
---
I'd pay $10 for each snowglobe, or $49.99 for the entire bundle.
---
I just want to be able to turn Urban into Forest and vice versa.  I have like 8 pieces of 2/3 star Unyielding but not a matched set in either color.
---
I'd pay 1800 atoms for that.
---
... it's things like this, that have ruined the game completely. If you just want fallout meets hello kitty, and you'll pay for it, eventually you'll get ur wish until no one wants to play the game anymore.
---
Someone recently posted a great compilation of all the outfits and level of rarity. Will post back if I can find it.
---
Wow that's awesome :)
---
I mean yeah
---
Re-release something for the same amount of money a year later? Brother, you're speakin their language...
---
i get a blue screen, at least once every play session.  no  vaults.  last night was only doing caps run and was booted.
---
Pm me if you want to take a stab at it, should be on in an hour or so. Headset would be great, but we can communicate through psn chat id if need be.
---
if you had it set up (both running) before patch 15 it's grandfathered in, just don't remove one and you keep 'em both.
---
While this is the best solution for the time being.
---
The game should be able to tell the difference between rapidly pressing a button and holding it. It needs a fix but given the other issues it's probably low on the priority list.
---
it would be nice if they brought back the poodle skirt and hip glasses too.
---
Yeah, I do suspect it's vats related.  I'm still not explaining it right- it's not lag, it's like everything about the attack goes through, but damage simply isn't triggered.  And it can happen multiple times in a row.  It also seems to break stealth frequently.
---
"Everyone" doesn't want the limit raised, you want the limit raised.
---
It was a joke, n this is my first time on Reddit. You guys are way to serious here sorry to offend u
---
You could have been more eloquent. You wouldn't be downvoted so bad. 
---
The truth is that the Medic build isn't the strongest by any means. You won't be one shotting scorchbeasts at any level.  Some people get really disappointed with this. 
---
Luckily, some other people like to be support to their friends and don't care for glory killing.  It's a different playstyle and rewarding in a different kind of way.
---
That is pretty cool, Spanish is taught in most of our schools in America I guess because central and south American countries are all Hispanic and we have a large Hispanic population in our country. I speak a little Spanish but I'm definately not fluent
---
at this point i think we'll be lucky to get wastelanders or anything else added without having to pay extra for it
---
Ash heap *wheese* is actually *wheese* very nice *coughing*
---
Just do it legit way.
---
Bought it. Using it for pvp. It's awesome.
---
Same. Whole vanguard forest and urban sets but 1 piece in each have shitty 2nd or 3rd effect just cause I want it all matching üòÇ
---
Could be like forbidden knowledge but an enclave quest to unlock plans
---
OK, here is the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drmsuy/guide_complete_list_ingame_obtainable_apparel_in/)
---
Nice comeback. Heard of auto spell?
---
Funny I used it and it looks more like an eggnog whitish to me but definately not white white
---
No, i ran around too much during the day, feel asleep way too early and woke up at 2:30am with nothing to do. 
---
Since you care so much. I hope your get ur fallout snow globes though, that'll be awesome for ya!
---
Honestly it‚Äôs only ever happened to me when I frantically loot the scorch queen lol
---
I hope what is happening with America's political climate doesent lead to more problems between our two nations I have always thought highly of the Russian people, you guys are half the reason the world isn't run by nazi's. I think a lot of people forget that
---
Yeah I actually have my fallout 4 modded out on survival mode with realism mods and such, even so it looks more apocalyptic like 3...and then it takes me back to fallout 3, which is still a Golden game especially with mods boosting it a bit. I try not to think about the other games when I play 76 because I‚Äôll just get sad a little bit.
---
you can swap out your internal drive at the cost of a fresh start and loss of all your unbacked up files and data.
---
external usb drive runs via the usb ports, and will be limited to the speed of the usb 2.0.
---
I bought a good external - load times are not excessivly long.
---
It‚Äôs only here-say that BOS are returning with Wastelanders isn‚Äôt it?
---
sent
---
If nothing else that would be awesome.  Scout Armor is such a pain in the ass.
---
Alternatively you can nuke morgantown for a low effort farm.
---
You could always have a buddy act as a courier. 
---
Transfer the item to him from your main character, then have him send you it when you login to your second character!
---
I don't understand all the derpy skins that people seem to love or weird mascot heads, but what are you going to do.
---
oh neat! thanks for the info. I didn't know about this stuff.
---
I agree and would like it included in the Halloween turret bundle as well.  Spotlights should be skinned in all bundles.
---
Updated the post it's a fixer BTW. Getting the weapon to him isn't the problem....it's just it feels a waste to kit out an ALT with a top weapon.
---
It‚Äôs not confirmed that they‚Äôre returning but they have at least some content as you can see BoS flags in one of the trailers
---
What, hearthfire had cellars.  Well f me I never noticed it
---
I also think the whole world benefits when our nation's work together like with the space programs and we should find more common ground to collaborate on big issues such as global warming...
---
Absolutely, wasn't aware of that bundle. Must be an oversight.
---
Why people play a unfinished game lol fallout is bad
---
I guess it all comes down to whether you‚Äôre gonna put the time into your second character to make it worth hanging on to? 
---
Could always stick it in a vendor on your second character for a nice cap boost.
---
You barely run into people because there is only 24 on a huge map, not because of camps.
---
Add me my PSN: Chlebostrom
---
 Will be home in 2hours.
---
max base rifleman and commando and lvl1 of the expert ones
---
I‚Äôd hang onto it if I were you. A) seller‚Äôs remorse; B) sometimes the ‚Äúalt‚Äù becomes the favorite (it did for me).
---
I think it's worth more than 30k by some margin lol at this point it's either keep it or list it on the market here.
---
Relative, I suppose.  I was extremely overencumbered from L45 to about 138, so was in excavator exclusively. 
---
It was good enough to see me though nuke zones, glass caverns, a silo run, and multiple SBQ battles, without excessive stimpack usage...so I can't complain about it.
---
About L139, got my weight down enough to start using (able to run in) the other armors, but still go back to excavator when I start bumping the run/crawl weight.
---
That rumor was for Vault 94, and it turned out to be not true, 4-star legendaries were not added. Although if they were to be introduced at all, the best time to do so would be when there is also a major balance overhaul, which is likely to come with Wastelanders.
---
This is true, I've been looking for a bloodied ffr one for ages, and also a junkies one. Never expected one to fall into my lap lol
---
This is wrong. I have an external HD and it runs perfectly fine. All my games are installed on my external drive.
---
You can do the staircase blueprint trick if you want real floors and walls BTW
---
it seems like people go crazy for this weapon, from what I've seen, if you put it on the r/Market76 sub you could get whatever you want and even more
---
Hey Anna I see your comment was relatively recent , could you help be a courier for me and u/porkloaf44
---
atleast an entire company is capable of creating at least one properly functioning product
---
One simple trick, that SAC don't want you to know, is get help.
---
If you run into the SAC patrol near some well armed enemies they will open fire on the vertibots and cargobot, giving a little bit of extra help.
---
The first time this happened to me, and the first nuke card I got, it was Supermutants at top of the world, they actually took down the cargobot without my help, I just stole the card from the crate on the ground.
---
Where I've had the most luck is at Watoga, all the robots open up on the vertibots and I climb a high building and concentrate on the cargobot.
---
I usually use a scoped hunting rifle, after a few hits the cargobot goes red and I can VATS it, using concentrated fire to take out the thrusters, which stops it dead in the air, then just shoot it 'till it crashes.
---
This has to be one of the most pretentious posts I've ever read on this subreddit, and that's saying something.
---
1. Are you really *that* bothered by the game showing player nametags? That's a pretty trivial complaint, at best.
---
2. That seems more like a "you" problem than an "everyone else" problem. At least 90% of the player interactions I've had throughout my year of playing this game have been overwhelmingly positive. In fact, 76 has one of the nicest online communities I've ever been a part of.
---
3. No idea what you're talking about with the whole "erasing memory" bit.
---
4. How are the survival aspects nerfed? It's just like any other number of survival games. You need food, water, and resources to survive. Not sure what you expect them to do. 
---
5. This point is all over the place. From what I gather, you're upset about high level builds that seem OP and don't like how server hopping doesn't carry over "consequences", whatever that means? 
---
6. If you're referring to the glitchy movement/spawning of the enemies then I agree it should be improved, but it's still a far cry from where we were a year ago.

7. Seems as if you're a VIP member of the "non-stop whiners club" as far as I can tell. You complain about how the vendors create an "economic utopia" (lol) while simultaneously griping about how the game lacks a community feel, which I completely disagree with. And as far as gameplay improvements, they've fixed literally hundreds of issues that plagued this game in its early stages, added an entirely new game mode with Nuclear Winter, added Vault raids, and do pretty frequent unique events as well, all within *one year*. Again, not sure exactly what you're expecting here. They can only do so much.
---
8. I can't speak for anyone else, but I find people to talk to all the time on 76. As far as the lack of NPCs, that's such a tired complaint as this point, especially considering the upcoming Wastelanders update. I'm in the minority here, but I didn't even mind the lack of NPCs at launch. It made sense considering we're supposed to be the first people to explore Appalachia after the bombs fell. It'd be kinda dumb if we left Vault 76 and there were already established factions all over the place. NPCs are coming back, so this point is redundant anyways and it also shows that Bethesda is listening.
---
9. "The atomic shop gets 24/hr attention"? It literally updates once a week. That's been established since launch. What, do you want a patch update for gameplay improvements every single day or something?
---
10. The hell is the "Bubblegum Disney Effect"? This is another point that makes no sense. You're complaining that Bethesda appeases *too many* demands while also saying they don't do nearly enough. Make up your mind, dude. Ffs.
---
Full health AA FFR Handmade. 9 ranks of commando, tank killer, bloody mess, covert operative, sneak, you're all set. You don't need to hit super mutants for 2k health because they only have about 800, and with sneak you're not going to find yourself being swarmed really.
---
Keep it! Some time you will want to play your alt. When that time comes having one of the best possible weapons on him will make your experience more fun. Also trading it will be hard, just because it is worth ALOT. ( If you must be rid of it, I will help you! My junkie doesn't have a fixer yetüôÑ Lol)
---
Seriously, keep it, if you trade, use the trading sub so you have a chance to get what it is worth.

I have quite a few on YouTube, can't link to my profile from my phone (???) but I can link directly to my latest camp:

Haunted church? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve stumbled on that yet, is it a marked location?
---
You could always hang on to it for now. Saw someone else mention buyers remorse which is a good point lol 
---
And if you find it‚Äôs just sat around in your box, you‚Äôve got a solid trade item for something you‚Äôd probably use more right?
---
It is perplexing how much energy people spend trashing a game they are probably no longer playing. Life is to short and there are too many options.  It's a game people get over it.
---

Bet he's a blanket hog too.
---
A weapon based on the Combat rifle with high dmg and a special effect for sneaking that is on par with an additional legendary effect.  It is the highest dps ballistic Rifle in the game. Like the BOS recon rifle when crafted it is fully modded.
---
Maybe this trick will help with alignment, makes it a breeze as you're building down rather than up:

Ooooooo
---
OK - that sounds familiar - helmet mods were bugged, and displayed the same behavior you describe. Issue was fixed several patches ago.
---
Sounds like the bug moved to the legs.
---
I know players who did this for Warframe, but I've seen and heard it's not worth doing on the old or slim ps4, since they use sata 2, while the pro uses sata 3, allowing for twice as fast read/write speeds
---
Yeah , that would be a big help if you can assist my friend and I here.
---
According to their site ps4 is equipped with usb 3.1.
---
Yes I can
---
Wow I didnt know any of this!!  Awesome input ty! üòÉüòÉüòÉ
---
Please make a private chat and we can talk there
---
Yes good point!
---
HRF just drops less, in my experience 50% hardened mass 30% glowing mass 20% HRF.
---
Ok had a post on his account for it , thank you
---
Possibly in the last patch
---
Well said.  The conflict between Russia and the United States is a conflict of rulers, not ordinary citizens.  The Russian people treat Americans well.  We listen to your music, watch your movies and play your games.  Sometimes we are offended by the fact that we are portrayed as monsters in some games (call of duty), but still, most people understand that this is ordinary propaganda funded by the government.  We also have enough of this, on TV they often try to put you in a bad light.  The image of an American in Russian TV is a fat, lazy and stupid racist who dreams day and night to destroy our culture and family values. Funny fact: our TV is completely uncompetitive in modern media, as example - they actually think anime is American product lol.
---
Fortunately, no one believes what is shown on TV except for the elderly. 
---
And yes, together we can do miracles!
---
Perhaps I, could take it off your hands. In exchange for let‚Äôs say, a bloodied explosive faster reload lever action?
---
Mine are running together.
---
 Guess I'm optimized :) I tried it once with a grognak.  That was a fail.  Some time later, retried with all rise.  fail.  back to the cultist dagger (one of my other old reliables), or the switchblade - same as you.  Let the bodies hit the floor....
---
That is alot of turrets, but you sound bugged.
---
Now I need to listen to your power armour shouting at me in the vault raids too, thanks Rick!
---
Jas x
---
Normally I'd say hang on to it for the few times you're on your alt. Currency, caps or ammo, just isnt that important. But if wastelanders ups the level cap or changes gear mechanically your gun just turned worthless
---
Put it in the marketplace and cash out you dont need BIS gear on your alt or your main to do amazing in this game
---
üëçüèª
---
You're grandfathered in. Dont delete one, like I did.
---
They should show is to record out own sounds or sell voice packs like Waze. Imagine Ozzy Osborne reading  the lines or Rick and Morty
---
You just lost access to add to the scrap box correct? If not you have something  bigger going on
---
Wait, those sounds are from the skin?
---
I got a chat started btw
---
Would be cool but dont expect it this Xmas and yes like it has been stated expect to pay. I do like some of the stuff they add but they need to focus on adding more story based content you cant finish in 30 minutes.
---
Hey bro!! Don‚Äôt worry, I already remove it! Lol. See you on Vault 94
---
Oh no! Beth please fix this! I can never move if you don‚Äôt! I need both in my camp.
---
You‚Äôve got Vim!
---
Rick and Morty!!!!!!
---
I'm on PC
---
Ive heard children laugh and balls randomly move near playgrounds. It only happens when Im alone tho, so it might be me just imagining it. I know the soccer ball by Aronholt moves sometimes on its own, as several people Ive played with have seen it too.
---
A standard PS4 hardly benefits at all from an SSD, the transfer speeds are too low to make proper use of it. The PS4 Pro however can make decent use of an SSD,
---
The PS4 Pro has USB 3.0 which is fast enough to make an external SSD viable.
---
The guy that said about losing your files and data is wrong, just back everything up on your hdd onto an external then install the new internal SSD and then copy everything from the external to the new SSD. 
---
Thats what I did, I'm using the "Crucial" MX500 SSD on a PS4 Pro. 
---
I haven't played F76 since December last year so I have no idea if it helps but it made a noticeable difference in DayZ.
---
Yeah its a shame about the bashing effect but i was hopeful with the other two - thanks for the reply!
---
It was already announced that there will be major balance changes with Wastelanders, although that might be limited to different level scaling. But it would make sense to rework weapon balance at once in one big package introduced with a general overhaul of the game that is almost like a new launch, and that can be based on input and data gathered since the beta. Nerfing a weapon or two in a patch just results in outrage, and overall still does not make much difference to the game.
---
In the case of the assault vs. handmade rifle, I think one major issue is the removal of 7.62 ammo. In Fallout 4, the choice between those weapons is more interesting, because while the handmade has higher damage, it requires a less common type of ammo, has smaller magazine capacity, and fires slower. The hunting rifle would need better damage per shot and better range to have a useful niche as a sniper weapon, even the lever gun is not really worth it when an automatic handmade deals half the damage but fires 15 times faster, and has much better ammo capacity and low AP cost.
---
Sons of Dane. I know they‚Äôre really just a footnote but they‚Äôre the only faction that really speaks to me.

Yes

You shouldn‚Äôt be shooting at her while she is flying above or under the ground.. wait till she lands.
---
I guess every one will try to kill you first just to shut up that voice. LOL!! I would
---
You keep any cosmetics you get within that time, just won‚Äôt be able to use the tent and scrap box after you end your subscription.
---
Same here. To the point that I'll never 100% believe the people that claim their game crashes 99.9% of the time and they lose tons of items and stuff.
---
It reminds me of playing my friends Modded F4.. But he's not good at modding at all lol
---
And can I give ranger outfit to my friend when I craft it ? And are u sure with it I didnt find anything about it on the internet üôÑ
---
You can, there are two "No Paint" options under paints and picking one will swap to the other variety visually but the name will stay the same.
---
Hmmm i'm not in on any of the trades forums etc so was just going to put it in my vending machine
---
Well to be honest we do still have a lot of lazy fat stupid racist people in our country but most of them AR more worried about destroying culture in our own country and are to small minded to worry about other countries but we're not all that way
---
Yeah Perception is great on a rifle, its going to be sniper builds for the most part who'll want it.
---
That is the answer, game has been glitchy for a year, you still paid more money, why fix anything?
---
Voice chat...? ü§î
---
No you cannot craft it for someone else that goes for any other clothing items in the atomic shop
---
I would love to have that in the game
---
I think some of the bug parts are considered food, and spoil over time.
---
I just do my dailys and trade now
---
Wishful thinking .  Lets us summon this from besthesda!!
---
Yes, it's the Haven Church OP is talking about. It is supposedly haunted because the raiders that first attacked the church and killed the community, started to live inside of it and witnessed some strange things. Like ghouls behind attracted by the place, or the organ song coming from nowhere.
---
I'll be honest too - we really love booze :-)
---
However this circus we have going on in my country turns out you've made a friend here dosvedanya comrade
---
Ohhh okay thanks. I‚Äôm terrified of the mire and haven‚Äôt explored it much haha
---
It is fun with a quad barrel and targeting computer. Fire and forget, the missiles really follow the target. My two shot did 1200+ damage with perks and bobblehead. So I thought it would be nice to shoot the queen from the sky. When I did, I saw a whopping damage number: 1... One damage out of 1200 got through her armor...  20 missiles later the missile launcher broke even though I had repaired it to 200%.   
---
So yes, it is script. Very heavy, stash filling script. Yeet that sh\*t as soon as you can.
---
calling people morons isnt very civil...
---
The Quest "One of Us" in the Enclave quest line gives you a rocket launcher (a unique one called Bunker Buster) which would work rather well. And that's a few steps ahead of the silo quest.
---
Yeah for sure just remember Rad x stops your mutation effects.
---
I'm a whiskey Bourbon and moonshine man myself haven't got the stomach for vodka anymore
---
Just witu the rank 4 of the perk reduces a ghouls +62 rads per second to like a 7. If you rlly went out of your way to get yourself a full blown rad resist armor (all pieces with the legebsary, all marines and all rad resist mods + the perk and the backpack mod) you could survive any forn of rafiatiob except for a nuke zone. You would need some radshield or rad x to gp throught it.
---
thats wot I read, so bought a really fast (gigs/sec) drive. Bollocks.!.
---
maybe later ps4's were equiped, but mine is definately usb 2. You need to closly examine the socket on your ps4, if its only got one row of contacts, then its 2. if its got 2 rows, then its 3.
---
also forgot to mention - if you swap out the internal, then it will format it. It will do the same to your original drive if you try to put it back.
---
I do not believe so.
---
Nope, you need to know the plan
---
Well I will have a look at the videos for inspiration :) Now the question is can I locate these? lol As I do like the lumber mill camp.
---
Crap..ok, thx.
---
Responders are not all dead. Maybe some Freestate managed to hide too.
---
You can find some fresh body of responders and some lightly decomposed Freestate. Also you can find some military lightly decomposed, you can loot some of them but there's nothing particular.
---
If you arrive below cliff simply fast travel again.  It should not charge you and put you in a better place.
---
I'm a bit of a hoarder.... well ok I'm a freaking hoarder and I hoard everything so this happens to me a lot especially if the server is laggy
---
I remember reading hazmat suits and PA have some sort of invisible rad resistance that makes it so you can't come all that close to viable nuke zone rad resist stacking all sorts of stuff.
---
I know if I stack radshield (+300 RR) and glowing blood pack (+75% RR) I still take over 10 rads per sec.
---
Yeah I loved Far Harbor and the Moxie tribute was so cool. Not to mention Longfellow was a nod to H.W.L.
---
Even with the plan took me 4-5k scrip to get oneüòÇüò≠
---
I have a day one ps4 and had a 200gb ssd around so i tried it. Never gonna get back. 
---
I load up eveything about 30-40 second before my friends. Like they say "let's go to my server" and i get there before them!
---
Even a normal external hd decreased the times but not like the ssd.
---
Or you could just buy them on the atom store.
---
This is excellent, very excited to make this the background music in my apartment. 
---
Thanks for putting it together!
---
Hey now, I live in that creepy swamp, right outside Harper's Ferry
---
There is a real song in the game by Harper'sfarie on the mountain above tracks
---
But the devs said that dogomeat will come in a future dlc during one of the pre-launch interviews.
---
That was a year ago, hope Wastelanders will bring some animals besides the confirmed human companions.
---
Mistress/Order of Mysteries. That quest was too good, and the secret base is too cool to just never have another reason to spend time there.
---
Take whatever drive you installed it on and burn it.
---
Yup, I thought I was going mad at first. Sounds like a steam train that's half assing it.
---
swapping drives is more time consuming/tedious than it is  difficult.  
---
Sync your trophies to PSN.  If you have cloud enabled,  I think you can also store your saves on sony servers.   Note: This does not back up photos, add-ons, or games themselves, just your save data.
---
Back up your existing drive to an external USB drive.  
---
Once the backup is complete, replace the internal drive with an SSD.    
---
I would suggest you get a drive larger than whatever you have now. (OEM is 1 TB SATA, I upgraded mine to a 2TB SATA)
---
Whichever route you go - larger/faster SATA or SSD, be aware there is a height limitation - the drive slot is a millimeter or two thinner than the average SATA.
---
Once the new drive is installed, at power on, the system should recognize the raw drive, format it, and install the base OS.
---
Once that's complete, reconnect the USB and use the restore function.  It'll restore all network settings, accounts, pictures, games.
---
If add-ons do not restore properly, you can always download the item again via the PS store history function.
---
Unyielding like many have said. I currently use a mix of nice armor with 2 uny pieces 1 lifesaver 2 sent.
---
I have 3 with wwr and 2 with AP.  works great, but breaks a LOT...even with white knight.
---
I get them quite regularly....with bashing damage.....lol
---
Maybe all that clutter is why you're having trouble relaxing :D
---
Any good daily quests? I‚Äôm level 60 something and feel like I‚Äôve done everything already
---
That would be 10$ please.
---
Did u get a good one?
---
That is euhmm well better then what i getüòÇ
---
Legendary versions are only available from the vendor and do not drop from encounters.
---
Yeah, I like whiskey too. Beer also.
---
I have a Mutants explosive +1ag now
---
I rather like the clown outfit - and as a bonus, it can be found in-game :)
---
Guarantee that there‚Äôs nothing.
---
I avoid this issue by moving the stuff on one wall to another wall, then wallpapering the original wall, and moving it all back. If it never goes into storage, it doesn't muck with the buggy ass budget system
---
These guns are sooo popular, but the specs dont seem diff from regular. Weapons. Why so in demand? Just the sneak?
---
Spoiler alert, it‚Äôs Wendigo Cave
---
It's a "rare" weapon with an extra legendary effect so yes for the sneaküòÖ
---
some vendors (player) may have one for sale. they dont need to dupe it , if they have the plan. Thats how I got mine. It was well modded, l50, and for only 1k.  You can HAVE it , if you want. They are not significantly better than a  standard combat.
---
Get a fucking life, dude.
---
Im not actually talking about wendigo cave, walk around the mire for a bit and you‚Äôll find out
---
Yes SSD does help, I upgraded the internal and it loads faster than before (about 50% quicker).
---
There is a Fallout Youtube station that plays themed seasonal music and even has some DJ stuff going on too!
---
Aw yea for sure.  I wished they added more far harbor to 4 tbh, really loved the shit out of that add on.  Just thinking about it humbles my internal rage.
---
unbelievable. Kind of cool, kind of a shame that the game seems to be so unbalanced that this is even a thing.
---
Very generous. Thx!, but I have some awesome weapons. I only wanted the fixer for trade value. I don't sneak....lol
---
I say this a lot but do the Ever Upwards quests and knock out those badges.  I have had a lot of fun working on those. 
---
You can also mix in some events that you maybe haven't done before.
---
Digging treasure maps can be lucrative if you find some of the rarer power armor plans.
---
  I'm working on Possum badges and a couple of events I haven't completed.
---
Have rebuilt my camp once, but may do it again to try and fix  budget issues.
---
 Still a few places I have not visited.
---
Rocket launcher can be modded with targeting computer so they become guided missiles.
---
I‚Äôve moved my camp several times to try and achieve this but I always fast travel to roughly the same place. Is there some trick I‚Äôm missing?
---
Are you sure? I feel like I've seen a rifle capped the fixer, that I got for killing something :/ I could be wrong
---
Do you need a plan each time? I had 1 got it but only 1 time
---
I have been thinking about getting an external if it actually improves load times, but they cost quite a bit so in that case I would only get a small one to fit two or three games. Honestly, on ps4 PRO the only load times that annoys me are the ones in FO4 and 76.
---
Gonna check the usb, thanks for the heads up.
---
Can‚Äôt find the source but I know there were animal head plans and lots of very rare plans like plasma grenade and deathclaw gauntlet third claw
---
I have no problem with this as a simple fast travel will usually fix it and put me closer to their camp.
---
Its when people lock their doors but leave the vendors powered, that grinds my gears.
---
Not unstable in general but definitely unstable when it comes to 76. the majority of the issues you see from people here are all on the PS4 platform. I have little to no issues on PC other than the occasional server disconnect and never ctd or anything that locks my rig up. The PS4 experience in 76 seems to be wildly different from that on PC and the Xbox falls somewhere in between.
---
Same! I just wish there was a clean version.
---
Wait until you start wandering in the woods. At night. Alone.
---
Just be sure to only use rad x diluted as rad x screw mutations
---
I'm not one to ever say this, but I feel they missed a big opportunity by not making this suit free. Not because its so great, but because with everyone having them, tons would be wearing them come Thanksgiving. They could have filled their social media sites with photos of the wasteland covered in players wearing chicken suits! The laugh alone would have been good advertising.
---
Would love to try to, my psn is viperxr22. Level 270 and a bit new to raids though.
---
I'm fairly certain it works like this:
---
You have to loot a certain amount of items in another cell before those will respawn. The number is different for world items and containers.
---
World items may respawn if another player who has NOT recently looted them enters the cell, though.
---
Wait, was it more expensive than the free state 28 dollar bundle?
---
It is a discussion not a trade post.
---
It sure isn't because I have no idea what this bug is.
---
answer to my last reply is further down the list 'ps4 pro ' . external drv is dead simple, plug it in. Would suggest, pay the little bit extra for something like a terra byte or more, worth it long term.
---
cheers
---
Well, I'll tell you if you switch characters, and log right back in, it is the same world. Not sure how long in between you have but I'm able to transfer things between characters on a private world this way.
---
Incorrect, it is all excavator with paint/skins. I still have my extra 100 carry, and my extra excavating when mining.
---
It‚Äôs rare but not sell-your-wife-and-kids-for-it kind of rare
---
when im alone i hear random people screaming for like less than 1 second or so
---
And make sure displaying a single snow globe takes up about 25% of your camp budget please.
---
I‚Äôve been grinding one just one character since the beta might make another for the achievement
---
Yeah, PA pieces have a hidden 15% reduced radiation damage per piece, and hazmat suit has 98% I think. These stack with the ''normal'' rad resist that they already give.
---
What''s the exact name of the mod?
---
I would love to have some "blank" frames that we can assign our player images too. Would have been nice to release with the camera.
---
I just bought a TSFFR Quad Launcher last night and it packs a punch. Damage is about 1500 and love the computer tracking mod. It just sucks that each rocket weighs 2 pounds...
---
Damn. That's along time for one character. I've used up my 5, lol. 3 that are level 50 and above. One I made just for NW and one mule.
---
I'd love to come by and check out your themed set ups, too, if that's okay!
---
–°—á–∞—Å—Ç—å—è –∏ –∑–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—å—è —Ç–µ–±–µ –∏ —Ç–≤–æ–∏–º –±–ª–∏–∑–∫–∏–º, –±—Ä–∞—Ç–∞–Ω!
---
I think it's 700
---
Yeah been playing off and on just now got to lvl.66
---
Unless you use sneak, in which case it gives you bonuses you can't get any other way.  It is arguably the best weapon for sneak rifle builds.
---
This solution never worked for me
---
Actually you‚Äôd think that before they add more new vaults (51,79), to the game, they would first work on the existing vaults, (63,96).
---
You have not heard about the ruinous bug?
---
A TV that plays a slideshow would be awesome.
---
Supposed to be no shave November.
---
Sorry, thought torso was X-01 with skin (follow on from post above yours), which if true would make my statement correct
---
Yep.  You can pretty much hide in plain sight with a full set of Unyielding, even without the actual Sneak perk.
---
They‚Äôre literally the same as the Free States
---
A full set of power armor reduces radiation by 90% before applying the displayed resistance, and a hazmat suit works similarly with an even higher percentage. Because of the non-linear damage resistance formula, that makes a much greater difference than just increasing RR (every time you double the resistance to a particular type of damage, you take about 1.29 times less of that).
---
What system are you on?
---
Correct, but mine is just a liberty prime skin on the excavator. üòâ
---
Prove it.
---
Oic. Yeah, new characters is only thing that kept me playing for so long, along with the trading markets. But I recommend trying different characters and build layouts it adds alot to the game. Also each character has it's own RNG so who knows your next character could be a God Roll Dropper!
---
Improved Health bars -
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/368
---
The base model also out-damages the base model of the Handmade, so it's the strongest commando weapon as well.
---
Ok that's wierd, I didn't play for a long time and just came back, looting seems far more difficult now
---
I think if anything they'd add on elemental damage with a 4th star. 
---
They have burn damage already with Perfect Storm, and poison damage with the sacrificial blade. I could see both of these effects, and cryo, being added as another effect, although this might introduce balance problems.
---
It's weird really, I can go a whole nuke zone and come out with 70 of two of the components and 20 of the other, you just gotta kill a lot and maybe trade others for what you're short on
---
Really? I don't have to the Danger hop?
---
It's just not worth it. The only viable way to go into nuke zones is by using Power Armor or wearing a Hazmat suit. You might be able to get away with a full team using or sharing a fully ranked Rad Sponge perk card, but everyone needs to be close to each other and near full health.
---
You have to learn the plan for it to drop from the Purveyor.
---
" ... weapons, hot"  I love the way he says hot, kinda sexual
---
I don't think Wood Armor is that wacky, tbh, but it doesn't help that it's never offered as a plan, nor is it something you even find until you're a higher-level player in higher-level areas.  It should have been something you knew how to make coming straight out of the Vault, as a basic type of armor whose "perks" are low maintenance and lack of mods.
---
You can leave and come back, within a certain time frame. Common consensus is in the 15-20 minute range.
---
I am just hoping for some ghouls. There was a small group in the mire. I hope there were more. I know there was one in one of the still or something but. Just hope there's more than one haha
---
Me too since day of release lol. Just can't find the motivation to start from scratch
---
But if they made the suit free, they couldn't gobble up your money.
---
I've listened to Old World Radio before, didn't realize they do seasonal music. That's great!
---
I thought this was going to be a nw reward and am bummed out about it.  Im saving my atoms for the upcoming xmas packages and new stuff revealed in the data mining! 
---
Its disappointing.
---
It was funny, I figured you were returning from a long break, because when you mentioned sugar Grove it brought back memories from the first few months when everyone was desperate for springs.
---
I remember server hopping there all the time, fighting with other people over who gets to loot it ahh good times. 
---
But yeah, I believe at some point they nerfed server hopping to loot. Respawn rates are tied to your character, regardless of server, and I'm pretty sure regardless of time. You now have to loot x amount of other items/containers before they respawn
---
hes a synth get him!
---
Thanks, but I mentioned specifically, that it's for the nuke zones, but vs ghouls/environment.
---
No, nothing in this game is creepy if I gotta be honest.
---
But it gets old REALLY fast!
---
Aw man that sucks, "looting" ammo in the ammo factory could work to trick the game?
---
That sounds neat, is the cave a good CAMP spot?
---
No, what is it?
---
There was a clean version a while back - of course, the clean one was an atom shop item.  IDK if its still there.
---
The sneak effect plus it has a inherent damage boost over the regular combat rifle, I think it's about 20% more.
---
Very good idea here.
---
Hopefully Bethesda runs with it.
---
Not sure, maybe someone else can weigh in on that. 
---
The number of items/containers you have to loot isn't totally unreasonable. Like I do pretty regular runs of blackwater mine, West tek, and Harper's ferry, looting/killing everything. If I keep it in the same order, things are usually respawned for me when I go back.
---
Yeah, they're awesome, I have 4 characters in the mire, 2 are right next to wendigo spawns hehe
---
I almost never use VATS for heavy gun. Spray and pray baby.

That's a great arguement for your average game where is releases and maybe one or two patches are made. Most games dont require too much work, because they are mostly finished on release. FO76 is more like an MMOPRG. Not only that, but 76 had had a VERY rocky start with all the bad press. I would not doubt that their player base right now is the lowest it's ever been. Anyone in business like myself knows that the current model is most likely unsustainable. If they had the playerbase like Overwatch, then maybe it would make sense to keep charging for the game. Either one or two things needs to happen. 1) they move to a regular pay mmorpg pay per month model like WOW where a fee is charged. Or 2) they open it to FTP in order to attract a larger playerbase and hope they make purchases on the atom store. There is no harm at all with going FTP in a game like 76. You speak like this will Ruin the game. Let me tell you, that is not the case, it will only help to add positive press, allow people to play who otherwise would not, expand the playerbase, give us more players to play with, give more sustained income flow to Bethesda to pour into other games like FO5 and Elder Scrolls 6. It's a win for everyone. If you are still around in 76, that means you truly care about the game and want it to succeed, because there are much better polished games out there.

I've heard that you stop getting any meaningful rad damage reduction once you go past the benefits of the lead-lined backpack mod.
---
I was seriously considering spending some of my 4000 saved Atoms on this.
---
I had not considered how annoying it could become,focusing on how cool it looked.
---
On second thoughts think i will give it a miss.
---
I noticed on a Nuke run at Whitespring last night a gamer was wearing it.
---
It never shut the f\*\*k up.
---
It was annoying just being in the vicinity of it.
---
Thanks.
---
what resources do you want to farm for?
---
Yes please that would be so cool
---
I'm right by a spot in the mire that can spawn 2, I think that's more than in the "wendigo cave"
---
Okay.I just dont have the caps to fast travel all the time and I'd rather play the game than only having to collect gears and springs to reapair my stuff
---
Or move your camp...
---
Yes, it's hanging over my doorway.
---
Nice! - ok, I'll have to check out that formula - I don't think I have access to all of that stuff quite yet. (But I did see a bloodied weapon so that's a start)
---
Dead in the water has 2 legendary enimies 1 star and 2 star. 3 star ls in the chest. Other two should have 3, 1 star  2 star and a 3 star
---
Patch changed that. Only one now. 
---
If you had 2 placed, you keep em till you move your camp or delete one.
---
Yeah I was testing it out last night and the .38 auto CR seems pretty sweet.  Now I just need to find / build a bigger mag :-)
---
actually - thats why I bought it. I already have a 3* combat, whats all the fuss about ' the fixer'. had a l35 in the past, took my 2 weeks to find a level 35, to give it away. lets try the l50.
---
now, should be said, I clump around in PA, only use limited cards, and keep both feet firmly planted on the ground. So the fixer, for me, has made no difference at all, but it is slightly lighter, but wouldn't be very miffed if I lost or gave it away.
---
You can already do that, no? Just drop stuff on the ground for them or leave it in a container nearby if possible?
---
It would be cool if it just listed them on the corner of the map, like tracking challenges.
---
enter the capital building with just a knife lol
---
They have said persistent worlds are coming in the future.
---
It's not always set - we done washout with friend yesterday and indeed I killed 3 legendaries, while I was doing that mission 3 weeks ago solo and get only 1.
---
Just because I am unhappy with the greed/P2W doesn't mean I won't spend $12 to verify for myself the pro's/con's of something.
---
It's called having integrity and verifying if what I say is true or not and correcting course as needed. You could use some integrity.
---
Now you going through someone's posting history because you don't like the points they bring up...gtfo shill.
---
Or you could set it up like the punch bowl or candy dish! That way there's no worry about prices etc. Just gives you one of the random items inside! I really love this idea. I would love to set mine up with maybe a nukashine, a couple of pieces of rare apparel or a nice weapon &lt;3 Something fun for people you know.
---
Its even worse with the PS4 Pro, I play with a friend who has a standard PS4 and I freeze / CTD / Lag about 4 times more often than he does :(
---
Great.
---
Orly.  This is good information.  My daughter wanted to start putting some bullets in a scorched's head but I didn't want her to start with nothing.  I tried dropping loot and hoping it would be there the next time around, but it didn't work.  I'll try this tonight.  Thanks!
---
//would you mind linking me the reddit post possibly. I am at work and while I can access reddit I cannot get on youtube.
---
Blue screens for me had settled down for a while.
---
Now they are back with a vengeance,i am averaging 3 Blue Screens a gaming session.
---
It has got to so bad that i am not going to do anymore Nuke launches for a while.
---
Sick of doing them, only for the game to crash either on Nuke launch,or crash at Whitsepring collecting Nuked Flora etc.
---
Also Whitsepring Station Stash Box is another regular crash Zone for me.
---
Yes, but not all the freaking time dude!! If I change democracy for communism it will be this armor fault! It was making me crazy!!
---
I think the price of all atom shop item should be cut down by 50%....
---
While I don't know about the difference between SSD and HD for FO76 (use SSDs since before it was released), there are some general general improvements when using a SSD:
---
\- load times not only are a thing when you load into the game or fast travel. Games are always loading textures, sound bits, creature animation graphics and a lot more while you move through the world. If the HD can't load data fast enough, even a high end graphics card will stutter because it must wait for data to process and output
---
\- windows is always busy in the background even if you don't see it: antivirus, search function, update checks, whatever else you have running. Most of it needs disk read/writes too and will reduce the actual performance of data transfers (from/to HD) available for a game as well.
---
All in all, pretty much any game will run 'better' (if any data must be loaded during gameplay) if you replace a HD with a SSD.
---
I have no idea what that means but it looks cool when ya write it
---
Ah that's rough!  I hope they add that back in some day, those were fun in the previous games and did so much damage.  I found something called an 'inert bomb' that looked kinda like it could be used to make a bottlecap mine -  But it doesn't do anything... Now that I think about it we would need lunchboxes to make the BC mines and I haven't seen those around either...
---
some of the tracks are blocked for U.S. people...
---
That's about all I understood, too
---
I remember the first day of the beta, I was a measly lvl 15 and I went to the mire in my fireman uniform. It was night and I kept thinking all the glowing mushrooms were eyes. Terrifying. Then out of nowhere when the sun begins to rise, I get clapped by a wendigo. Scariest shit ever I stg.
---
Calling it now;
---
"we have added the dragon back into legendary loot pools!"
---
&gt;Drill starts dropping again
---
Ya know your right. It needs a snooze option lol
---
Yeah no problem. Also works on normal worlds but have to remember a few gamertags and make sure they are joinable before you switch. Alot more risk, especially with god rolls.
---
I agree on an idea like this... dogs from a special doghouse, cats from a bowl or bed, a bird from a cage or birdhouse, etc. Have them function similar to the resource protectron but generate dog food cans, empty cans, purified water, bones, etc. The taming system is somewhat fun but pets seem to die too easily (or just drop dead mysteriously). A rework of the taming system is needed, and this would make for a cool add-on to it as well as the CAMP system.
---
I believe there was an entire set of Christmas emotes.
---
I'm a melee build as well.   I took down m first one with a combat rifle.  Took what seemed like forever.
---
(At some point, you will get a mission to take one down, along with its escorting vertibots.)
---
If you have them, troubleshooters gatling or an AA work really well.
---
I usually hip fire - the bots are easier to lead/track that way.
---
IMHO, they move way to fast to try and use a scope
---
If possible, try to hit the engine, not the body.  I suppose you could vats for the engine, but I've never tried it.
---
 Once the engine starts to smoke, its movement slows down, the figure 8 it flies gets smaller, and it becomes a lot less erratic.  
---
After enough damage, it will just hover.  Simple at that point.
---
(BTW, I tried a missle launcher, but early in the "fight", the cargobot jinks around too much for the targeting computer to remain locked on.)
---
Interesting, I'll try to test it out tonight, thanks.
---
The Mire spooked the crap out of me the first time I explored it. Walking around there at night with all the glowing fungi made it feel like dozens of eyes were on me and something would jump out at any moment. 
---
Then they made the nights brighter and it wasn‚Äôt scary anymore. :/
---
There is a new kind of beer they have come out with in my country called white claw and there is currently a nationwide shortage they can't make it fast enough to keep it in stock
---
Prepare to get downvoted by Bethie Inc.
---
I like getting a fresh world every time.   
---
The only thing you really lose is your workshop progress.  I have a workshop camp blueprint that I pop down every time.  Takes secs to deploy after you take over a shop, and has everything I need... crafts, beds, instruments, stash, turret towers for defense.
---
I know, every single time lol
---
I wish they would forewarn us. I spent my 1k 2 days ago
---
I try to share this tip as often as I can, cause it works really well.
---
Whenever uranium fever event pops up, join it. It's free fast travel to public events. Run the event, killing as many mole miners as you can. Loot everything they have. Try to tag the Legendaries, and loot them too. Once the event is over, go through the rest of the mine, killing all the mole miners and looting EVERYTHING, outside of the mine included.
---
Equip rank 3 super duper, and craft all the glowing meats you have into glowing meat steak. Take the short, overencumbered walk down to whitespring station. Equip rank 3 hard bargain and use grape mentats (if you have them).
---
Sell all your glowing meat steak, glowing blood and black titanium scrap (if you don't use it) to the vendor there. Then start selling weapons til you hit the 1400 cap maximum. Scrap down the rest of the looted weapons you have left over.
---
You'll walk away with 1) 1400 caps. 2) hopefully a couple Legendaries you can scrap at the scrip exchange machine 3) you'll have copious amounts of scrap. I'm usually walking out of there with 500-1000 steel, around 50 of each (gears, copper, lead) and random but still useful amounts of other scrap.
---
It takes maybe 40 mins-1hour, but it's easily the most rewarding run I have ever come up with. I do it at least once per day
---
I have no idea but... *tightens his pronouns* I can do this all day.
---
Is making a negative propaganda for democracy man!!!
---
I would die for Hancock's outfit &lt;3 My wallet will burst into flames if they release it.
---
Whine and regret
---
To answer your question:
---
Each Vault 94 mission has a set number of guaranteed legendary enemies:
---
* Dead in the Water has 2, a 1 star mirelurk king in the residential area and a 2 star glowing one in the reactor room.
---
* Meltdown has 4 in the G.E.C.K. wing, all of which are named glowing ones.
---
* Washout has 3, a 1 star stingwing in the seed bank, a 2 star cave cricket in the reactor room, and a 3 star honey beast in the atrium.
---
Meltdown wouldn't be a good choice due to having to defend the G.E.C.K. and repairing the pipes that the ghouls target and that requires having a team of 4 that has good communication and defines roles for each player. Washout is the best option given that one can take their time on Novice with any amount of players.
---
While it is possible for an extra legendary enemy to spawn in addition to the guaranteed legendary enemies, the odds of that happening is low and does not effect my answer.
---
Well hopefully they do monetized everyone's dumbass suggestions so they can fix the real fucking issues with the game. But you never know, maybe they'll just put that money back into more worthless immersion breaking cosmetics
---
I was about to become one, than I changed my PA skin again and I‚Äôm all democracy now. But this stuff gives democracy a bad propaganda.
---
Would be awesome to have added
---
Oh that would never happen, it‚Äôs by design
---
I got 3 fixers in a row haha but they are nonsense I went in with about 700 skrip but landed a junkies ffr with some other effect 50 Cal!
---
just added you. im trying to solo a silo at the moment as well lol could use some help with that real quick before the vault lol
---
Not on my character!! For the sake of my friends and my sanity
---
They were all zhit then too though, probably wouldnt have had better luck than you
---
Those 4 and 5 stars have been in the files since before the first major update. We've just been waiting to see them released.
---
You're confused about how there are real issues with bugs and game stability but people keep demanding dumbass cosmetics all day long on here
---
Oh that's a neat idea, I forgot about those items. Yea if you could just plop a bunch of gifts into the tree and it uses that function to just randomly give one to whoever clicks, that would be awesome!
---
Wow sounds crazy,  I will try that out, thank you!
---
ahhh gotcha! i ve got a pick of it while the claw has it as well lol.
---
MuH iMmErSiOn
---
If you can deal with people jumping 20 feet into the air and surviving 200 foot falls you can deal with someone running around in a mascot outfit or some shit
---
There will be more around if they don‚Äôt mute this armor. Bad propaganda man
---
I've heard that, if you have the time please let me know which ones and I can try to find replacements for the re-up closer to Christmas. I'm in Canada so they all work for me and I can't tell which are broken.
---
I dropped over 700 scrip and the best I got was a troubleshooter  explosive pipe pistol. The rest was the worst rolls I have probably ever gotten.
---
I know- we already technically have his hat too!
---
We actually don‚Äôt.
---
Lucky to get Wastelanders at all. And it will almost certainly be the last big update for 76 unless it somehow manages to convince the entire Fallout fanbase to play it, which I doubt.
---
Yeah, I know their Christmas work is super popular and has some custom Fallout themed Christmas carols
---
For the first 10min, yes. Than it‚Äôs just irritating
---
I take screenshots of everything i get from murmrgh and keep any eye on the pattern. At the beginning the drop rate of explosive bullets is approx 1/8, about the equal chance among other effects. It kept getting lower and lower but never thought it could be like 1/30-1/40.
---
My bad, I can't seem to find a specific Reddit post regarding the gifts, but from the video there will be gifts dropping from the event but we will also be able to create our own to give to other players.
---
They did.  Check out the inside the vault sometime.
---
Where were you when first Liberty Prime happened. Or moreover, didn't you ever see one? Neither a post about this exact shit to imagine what is going to happen to you? XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Thanks for the valid points. The private servers do run smoother. I sadly don't have any friends that play this game anymore. Excellent point on the workshops, this might actually get me to sub for 1 more month just so I can attempt to farm enough scrap to never need to farm for it again. 
---
Tent is very convenient and useful too, I'm already missing having that instant ability to scrap and store items the moment I'm overweight. 
---
The scrap box really should be for everyone who bought the game, I expect value for my money, and while I feel I overpaid (I paid bi-centennial full price on release for my child and I) and this game has a enormous amount of bugs ( modding is limited so normal bug fix mods are not a thing for this game), the game isn't horrible and is worth some money (imo closer to $30-$40 for the bi-centennial edition).  I feel they advertised a new outfit as part of the deal by tying the NCR outfit to the sub. 
---
  
---
I can say this for sure though, this will be the last Bethesda game I ever buy, which is a real shame as I was a huge fan of Fallout and Elder Scrolls. 
---
I just can't condone nor support a company that makes decisions like purposefully hiding the scrap box behind a paywall, charging $18 for a single item, or charging $8 for a single color on a single item.
---
I think the turkey will be the next Pvp outfit üòÇ it blends pretty well in sneak
---
And wait for Libertator Prime with chinese dialogues XDDDDDDDDDD
---
It's RNG. Don't cry because you have bad luck.
---
Well done.
---
I thought 2 of us taking 20 minutes, a level 170 + and me at 240 + was some achievement.
---
You have put that in to perspective.
---
Bwhaaaa.
---
It's the whole game.
---
I don't think anybody wants to buy one star weapons or armor from the Purveyor, which is why you probably won't see any 1 star fixers, bear arms or sheepsquatch clubs or staffs. It's already disappointing enough getting a one star item from a three star legendary, why would anyone pay for that experience?
---
This is a fantastic idea!
---
I did see a few and I like it. But I never had the idea that it keep talking all the time. One thing is to see it around every now and then, but all the time?! Is was driving me crazy!
---
Dude it‚Äôs all based on the server. I got 10 armor pieces last night. 4 had ap refresh. 3 had sentinel or cavalier and 6 were bolstering or vanguard
---
I don't even know where my CAMP module is, it get lost inside an existing structure XDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
its definitly kinda nice ( the backpack ).  I've collected all of them now and I default to the rads one as it is nice vs ghouls
---
that said it depends greatly on your build.I use a dense chest + Fireproof 3 for the Queen's strafe attack and basically ignoring any explosion dmg.
---
But the rest are all Ultra Light for the AP refresh I just couldn't see giving up AP for rad resist but maybe its not a big thing for your build?
---
I know right, three star trouble shooter‚Äôs assaultron head with bashing, who would‚Äôve thought stuff like these existed.
---
And the fanboys
---
Yeah, you're ruining everyone else's game, it's ok though, I have private servers that cost money so they can put that money into more dumbfuck cosmetics and maybe some bug fixes...
---
Vault 96 is for raids, similarly to 94, and was planned to be released as part of the summer (Nuclear Winter) DLC wave. It was probably delayed to 2020, so that more resources can be focused on the development of Wastelanders. Lore wise, cryogenic experiments seem to have taken place in Vault 96, and, as usual, they went wrong and the human inhabitants are dead.
---
There is also a third raid vault in the Ash Heap, Vault 63, which can be found SW of the unfinished mansion. Not much is known about this vault, maybe it would be opened later in 2020 for raid missions, but I can also imagine the possibility that it will be repurposed and filled with NPCs, as raids have not been very popular or well received so far.
---
Vault 79 will be a part of the Wastelanders main story line, if I recall correctly, it is in the mountains NE of the Bailey family cabin (northern Savage Divide area). You can find a small cave with an elevator, and a keypad that currently requires the code 000000, but it is not possible yet to actually enter the vault.
---
Refueling
---
That‚Äôs why i server hop after a few. Don‚Äôt know about the quality of armor drops, all I‚Äôve tested are ranged weapons.
---
I like the idea of instanced housing cause we could build more. That said, it could also feel cut-off from the world and if there aren't many visitors it's kind of pointless. It would also be sad to lose the many great views that are in Appalachia. 
---
I'm kind of mixed on it TBH. My ultimate preference is for bigger budgets, private servers, and some kind of lobby so players can freely move between 'open' private worlds.
---
L24 is early in the game.   Slow down and work on some of the other stuff - Mysteries, firebreathers, responders, BoS/recruitment blues quests.  Start Roses quest (it'll quickly take you to areas you are likely not ready to be.  There's another quest starting at wavy willards.  You get a nice weapon from that. For myseries, rose, and willard, for the top reward, complete the tasks, but dont go back to origin until after L50.
---
  You'll eventually get to Ft Defiance and the line in the sand event.  That'll get you some rank points.  At L24 and without escort, you may not be ready for that quite yet.
---
  With a decent weapon, in a couple more levels, you should be able to start non-nuke WS runs.  You'll pick up a few legendaries there, but its going to be difficult.   
---
You should also start the excavator quest.   Much better than raider PA, and completing it also gives you the plan for the PA workbench.  It will alos lead you to areas where you can find legendaries.
---
There are 2 enclave vendors, both are in the WS bunker.
---
X01 plans come from a different terminal in WS bunker.  (not one of the vendor terminals) 
---
I don't remember exactly when in the quest you get them.
---
1. To repair all my weapons.
---
2. I want to build a lot of handmades to scrap them and get the good attachments
---
10 fucking dollars. AY LMAO.
---
If you take nukashine you basically get stuck in endless loading screens and your blackout never finishes.
---
It‚Äôs random man, I got some good stuff. If the 400 scrip I spent yesterday I got a bloodied/faster swing speed/+1 strength super sledge. I don‚Äôt run melee but it‚Äôs ridiculously powerful. Got a bloodied/10% while aiming railway rifle as well.
---
Your bug parts are occasionally getting scrapped and sucked up into your scrap box - it's a known bug. You can "protect" them by listing them in your vendor for a high price no one will ever pay.
---
Pretty bummed tbh. I had been on a lucky streak with 3* enemies the last few days. Just got an instigating explosive black powder rifle the night before and a bloodied/ss sledgehammer the night before that. Heck, 1 nice fixer would have been solid.
---
I agree.
---
They might yet decide to do it for Christmas though.
---
Would be hilarious everyone running around in Turkey costumes.
---
The Clown outfit could do with more Mask/outfit options.Those really scary clown masks  you often seen at Halloween.
---
Haha, oh yes, they hate it...
---
They said this is going to be included in the future.
---
RNG my friend! I dumped 1000 off one character and got 4 Bloodied, 2 vampire, and 1 Anti-Armor, and 1 Unyielding. All 3*. None are full god rolls. But all are useful and worth either keeping or selling. 
---
1000 off my other character....all back into the scrip machine. Same server too! So much for the theory that a server gives out the same types of items.
---
I'll start with backpack - that with my chest will give me 115, suppose that'll be enough. As for queen - I found that dense is enough protection for me.
---
You are getting downvoted by Beth Inc. damage control. They are tired of keeping a low profile after the backstab that was 1st.
---
Also they "just" released 1st, so expect 6 months before a "we hear you" comment from some random employee followed by doing nothing about it.  
---
They probably have zero clue as to why it's happening. 
---
Downvote me while I don't give af, you will never be rid of me, that's what happens when you FCK people so royally.
---
&gt; Since people keeping reporting the atom shop photos as adult material, I put them also on a non-imgur site: 
---
They ways people would take to "fight" against Bethesda and 76 is ridiculous. It's basically an obsession. Bethesda has done some shit lately, but boy... these radical detractors are way worse and pathetic than Bethesda has ever been...
---
Also had to agree that it needs a SILENCE button. How the hell could one stealth properly with 200dB of democracy over his body? XDDDD
---
You get a non legendary one as a reward from the imposter sheepsquatch questline.
---
Woah, that's a lot of info to take in. But thanks for that bud, I'm excited for the future of this game.
---
I gotcha, that might be the one I have
---
Player has to be around it within a certain timeframe or it will despawn
---
Simple thing rlly, go lockip something from a player. Then go take ovwr the munitions factory. Set up a crapton of turrets. Use the building to your advantage and kill the bunch of people that cpme after you. This is what I did. I killed the same 5 dudes around 5 times each with a TSE 50 call. Fun times. Also take their junk for extra frustration.
---
I'm getting weapons that wants to make me change the whole perks I use. We really need a legendary crafting system.
---
You're going to want perks and legendary armor that reduce limb damage, plus apply all the mods that reduces your incoming staggers. If you have full adamantium skeleton, your limbs are immune to being crippled, and if you have pneumatic mods applied to your armor, you're less likely to be staggered by melee damage. Stack that with the blocker perk and you're good to go.
---
They did. Check the fallout 76 website. Been up for at least a week.
---
Your own mini-vault like The Free States has.
---
Yes actually looting corpses have consistently have better results than murmur, they are likely on different RNG. I still get explosive effect weapon drops from ghouls approx once in a day or two.
---
What else would you do with it?
---
It's called Murgle's Coffee Shop and I had my CAMP there for a bit. You can build in, on, and around the existing building which gives some really cool options. And you have the named cat wandering around. Not too much trouble with spawns either, those as some pointed out it IS in the Ash Heap. So some sort of breathing apparatus is required unless you like lung disease.
---
That‚Äôs kinda what I figured was going on...ty for the pvm work around I‚Äôll do that
---
Why would you want to rad resist, go ghoul, heal yourself with your enemies :D
---
Not if you were denied a refund
---
Suppose that would help eh? PS4
---
You just wasted your money.
---
makes no difference wether its a sale or not. I still get gamma guns and broadsiders,fatmans.................................. I have excactly ONE item, that i've kept. Nope, sorry TWO, i did get a exec. gauss, but already have a quad, so thats still in my stash.
---
I need flat black paint for everything in the game tbh. Handmade's matte black finish is soooooooo nice couldn't imagine how great everything else would look in it.
---
Wow what a content that would give me the reason to play
---
Ghouls seem to always drop under leveled stuff, even the max level ones. I have honestly done well with the SBQ and the random enemies you find out exploring.  I kinda feel like Murmgh got a nerf someway, somehow but idk
---
Yes you can get a server that‚Äôs lucky or unlucky or glitchy, that‚Äôs the beauty of RNG. That‚Äôs why I use multiple characters and server hop after a few drops.
---
Yeah if it‚Äôs not a awesome roll I throw it in for like 350-750 caps depending. I‚Äôll get more and I just need it gone to make room for more.
---
2000 scrip used here best I hit was a Medics 50/25 Tesla and a FE Pipe Gun üò©
---
Yup. Sometimes I don‚Äôt have a lot of time so I just go snatching up whatever legendary items are less than 1000 caps.
---
I dropped 150 scrip and got b2515 fixer and q2525 tesla
---
i put one over my Nuka Cola clock and it looks pretty festive
---
i can just craft you a hazmat suit
---
When will they fix any bugs
---
Heres a (close) Spotify version: [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3RLMvVRouVkrmdxcdP4mzl?si=5RbQwWWtSDOBGywzDrljkg](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3RLMvVRouVkrmdxcdP4mzl?si=5RbQwWWtSDOBGywzDrljkg)
---
Dont move your camp, just move the camp device somewhere else within the bounds. It will alter your spawn point. It is basically random so there is no trick to it, just trial and error.
---
That's okay! But thank you for telling me. It sounds like it could be fun.
---
be VERY careful. the private server can expire, ie. it disappears while you‚Äôre changing characters.
---
&gt; and scrap box after you end your subscription
---
You can still pull from it, you just can't add to it.
---
Murmur has been steadily declining. But if a ghoul is max level and your character is above 50, it ‚Äòshould‚Äô drop max level items.
---
You don't need to take the plant to get cores.
---
There are at least a dozen PA spawn points in the forest alone, and just as many generators.  
---
I made the rounds and looted the cores.  With batteries included   
---
 (reduces their weight) and power user, cores can last a really long time.  (a 50% core can last me over 6 hours)
---
A few hints:
---
If posiedon is not owned, check the table next to the fusion core generator.  There's almost always a core on the table.
---
Camden park can have up to 5 :  2 fusion generators, a PA spawn, 1 loose in an ammo can, and another awarded by an event.
---
Wade Airport can have 3:  There are 2 PA spawns and another spot where there's almost always a core.
---
There's one in the atom shop that's similar and the pirate hat could work too if you're not nitpicky. But if they wanna release his actual hat with the outfit that would be lovely too.
---
Nps, I can see a lot of people getting packages of spoiled meat lol
---
Love your vids‚ô•Ô∏è
---
I believe there's still a dome key that hasn't been discovered (I could be wrong). Tbh since 2 of them had PA Paint Plan regarding Nuka Cola Skins, I wouldn't be surprised if the Vim PA Paint Plan is in one waiting to be discovered :o. Who knows!
---
I‚Äôve been stripping them when the don‚Äôt sell. Recently scripped a couple few quad crossbows with some secondary effect but I forget what. No one buys them so if they sit too long and I hit a patch where I haven‚Äôt farmed legendaries for a few days, they go into the scrip machine.
---
Yeah I was going to say. The tricorn hat isn‚Äôt in the game if they were to add the outfit they probably would add the hat as well
---
Thanks, I think I've mentioned on this thread, it takes around 15-20 minutes prep work to gather resources, farm, brew and trade for the buffs I use. This is one of the least ways economic ways of farming the queen.  
---
  But when it all comes together :D
---
I've got mostly trash so far as well.. but I did get a bloodied +10% aim dmg/ 33% less vats cost.  That coukd be sorta fun. I'm really looking for swing speed walking canes though.. lol
---
I don't know...  the Mire still can get really dark when you are under the trees.  Probably the only place where it can be damn near black at night.
---
Does your luck stat affect the RNG?
---
Ah right cheers mate I'll scope the area out at some point and see what I can do with it
---
Would it be a good idea to have some defences anyway? Although the reason I have my camp in the mountains is to get rid of said defences lol 
---
As for lung disease, I need it still for my challenge so there's that and I don't really mind it due to my mutation
---
omg thanks! haha
---
No, no it wont. You know nothing about what youre saying. First of all, kbb goes by dealer prices. Not private sellers.
---
More like the RNG try-hards.
---
Gotta love the people that really get sucked into it so deep that they firmly believe that their pathology is actually 'the righteous way to do things'.
---
'Don't begrudge RNG man; you have to repeat this circle of performing the same action over and over again with a completely uncertain outcome rather than investing effort in achieving an objective of predictable outcome to give it meaning'.
---
I do that all the time 
---
Entering with a pistol would be harder for me
---
&gt; so bought a really fast (gigs/sec) drive. 
---
Which one?
---
Any SSD you get will operate at SATA3 specs, so you are maxing out at like ~500MBps.
---
Then you wouldnt be going by that logic.....lol
---
Or people who understand rng
---
Ya, I'm level 215 and still get under leveled drops regularly. I just got a vanguards/wwr 3* last night at whitesprings that was level 15 off a max level ghoul. 
---
I don't even really need anything anymore and just farm for drops to use for trade fodder on rare cosmetics and plans. Lol
---
I thought there was one in the atom shop or used to be - got released with the coat that looks kind of like Preston's. But it could just be another version of a pirate hat too.
---
Forbidden snacks
---
You mean the western outfit from nuka world
---
FUCK YEAH. All the other maps suck.
---
If youve got nothing to do on 5 seperate characters, then go the fuck outside.
---
Yes fatmans and broadsiders are really common while fixer and handmade were virtually nonexistent. Bashing damage chance has been reduced though, replaced with aiming and vats chance.
---
Nice
---
I just teamed up with my wife when we played together and got it.
---
They did
---
Range. I got a faster swing bloodied combat knife +1 strength. Only tried twice. 
---
I didn't keep trying because I need stash space and wouldn't know what to scrip. All 5 characters are full of jewels.
---
No i don‚Äôt think anything can affect murmur. Luck affects the durability bar though.
---
It would be nice to have Hanukkah too. I really like your event ideas
---
Seems like it‚Äôs the rarest one, took me the  longest to get it and it sells for a decent amount on here
---
Only got 1 last night myself and gave credit to the shitty server theory. A bloodied broadsider double vats would anybody use something like that? Doing other 900 plus whatever can script today hoping for better...
---
As well as an extra fast travel point w/ scrapping ability. The scrap box should be a game wide thing with no paywall. The rest of it is logical, I guess?, to put behind a paywall.
---
I know but i think it would have been ugly :(
---
When I was there I never had any turrets or walls up. Never had any issues with wandering baddies. It's pretty desolate there. I tucked the CAMP device in behind the building by the crates and was able to build on both sides of the "road" and all over the coffee shop. Added tables, lights, decorations.
---
Was pretty cool.
---
That could be a new bug, I‚Äôve never seen that happen. But yea same here, i don‚Äôt think i *need* anything else atm to conquer the wasteland, just play to see what‚Äôs possibly out there lol
---
They have fixed quite a few that I‚Äôve seen
---
You can't revive someone that you are engaged in PvP with. Also I think you have to use the take revenge option to engage again or just shoot them in the face.
---
hell yea. i actually learned it because i want to make a bunch to sell. Hopefully i can get another. I've seen to only come upon 2 recipes i already have from biv. been doing the dailies for 2 weeks now.
---
Ill always collect it for u. I nvr optimize my foods.
---
Someone said Fallout 76 endgame is just dollhouses (camps) and dress up (cosmetics) Lol!! Can't say they are wrong!! üòÇüòÇ
---
I like it. There are a string of Red and White lights. They were in the atom shop. But I love it.
---
Idk it's tan with a red frock under it? //i could never afford the dlcs for fallout 4 sorry if I am unaware of things from it
---
A pop-up message prevents accidental destruction.
---
Each private world lasts around 5 minutes after leaving it. So you can switch characters or even restart your console/pc and it‚Äôll put you into the same world. So long as you do it within a 5 minute span.
---
There were not formal gowns in the bundle - it was 3 different suits that were black and white. As far as a gown - you can buy the red dress at Whitesprings from the fancy clothes vendor.
---
Responders!!
---
Melody Larkin the Firebreather chief is still possibly alive.
---
But why not add a little something for all the players!?
---
Enclave, BOS, Raiders, mistress of mystery/unstoppables, Mothman, Dane Rogers, Free States, Vault Tec, etc
---
I sat down this morning and put a Spotify Playlist together. I am not OP [https://open.spotify.com/playlist/332M1H8kquNxpRb3ROb1p4?si=Q91EI\_poT5O74Ubx9Ytd7Q](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/332M1H8kquNxpRb3ROb1p4?si=Q91EI_poT5O74Ubx9Ytd7Q)

I would love to see faction quests similar to ever upwards.  Let us aquire commendations we can use in vending machines for gear, cosmetics, camp decor, etc
---
It means: Happiness and health to you and your loved ones, bro!
---
Locked doors in general bother me. I guess I get locking your resources/water pumps, but really...what are you hiding?? We can't smash up your stuff, worst we could possibly do is leave fertilizer and an insult note on your bed (which I do sometimes if you have stupid prices or set up in the Mire or Bog and sell non legendary leather armor pieces and pipe weapons). I wanna see your camp bro, LET ME IN!!
---
Theres only 3 keys released but one didnt have pa paint plans.  I was thinking that when i was doing the dome quest.
---
Nice! During a sale is a great time to vendor hop, so many people with excess legendaries
---
So in theory, I could just team/unteam the same guy or gal 20 times, in the same play session (with no server hopping or re-logging) and get it to pop?
---
Sure, but then they will stop giving out so many free ones.
---
Not sure what you're asking, but once you learn the plan, the Fixer becomes part of the drop pool when getting itemd from the Purveyor.
---
I've learn the plan and had 3 drop for me.
---
Some 1* are worth 1000 or more and some 2-3* are worth scrip.
---
$9 pffff no thank you
---
Oh dammit. I've been selling this for 76 caps, like all the rest of Biv's recipes! What's it actually worth??
---
Yeah have the same, as soon as my caps go up from sales I‚Äôm back out there buying from others :)
---
I dont know about same server, but the same people easily.
---
lol i know! I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm actually visiting Allegheny asylum looking for nurse dresses, something I thought i would never do a month ago, shame shame üòÇ
---
Not come across a single 1 star that‚Äôs been worth 1000 caps yet, but I guess stuff is only worth what you‚Äôre prepared to pay, for it.
---
Just that. I learned once and only have had 1 drop in thousands of scrip. Thanks
---
I've not seen any high radiation fluids drop for a while now.
---
I got the IE Black Powder Rifle about three weeks ago.  It is a great sniping rifle.  I like to sit up on the cliffs behind Wes Tech and pick the Super Mutants off.  Can one shot them with a critical.  Of course though it is useless where an enemy can get to you.
---
Also a dog house that spawns a dog! 
---
Can't plant silt beans either can we?
---
I found a 3 star executioners explosive db shogun for 800 caps a few weeks ago. My buddy snagged a formula P recipe for 200 last night. There are definitely some good deals still out there!!
---
that i dont know but i knoe ive seen people selling it. read something about it being rare but no price tag associated with it
---
Reason is because it uses instancing technology. The stupidest part is only one raid per server so theres no real reason to make it instanced.
---
I've been using a 500GB solid state external drive hooked to USB 3.0 on a PS4 Pro and it cuts Destiny 2 loading times in half.
---
Ya, it's a great opener!!
---
Nice.
---
Also we share the same first name!
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
I really would like different forms of clutter as well. I feel like there's a lot that they could do with it. Like themed clutter - cult clutter / nuka cola/shine clutter (similar to the frat house maybe?) / scrap type clutter - like materials etc.
---
My camp is in the mire, it‚Äôs fine.
---
He says surrounded by as many missile turrets as the game will allow.
---
I agree we need more adult sized beds. Plus clean/dirty versions. I know a lot of people want clean stuff but I want some gross lookin beds too
---
If I may ask.  
---
What the hell does this have to deal with the post?
---
lol for walking canes you need to do the SBQ, i got two in a row üòÇ
---
I miss those spike poles with the skulls on them
---
Mire(black place), ash heap(gray place), the wild divide(desert), cranberry bog(red place), and I honestly don't know what the green area is called.
---
I think those are what they are called.
---
What bonuses does it give? I'm still running dailies to get it, I think it's my last one from ol' Biv.
---
Okay, give me q few minutes and I can join you
---
this latest update seems to have made the game less stable. I seem to be getting the blue screen even more often than before, and I'm not even doing those raids.
---
just got the recipe yesterday. havent made on yet. will make on here in a moment then let it ferment and let you know
---
Mong.
---
Agreed, spent 800 last night, all crap rolls.  Worse results ever at the Purveyor.  Only one somewhat interesting weapon, 3\* Assassin's Explosive .50 cal.  My Vampires, FFR .50 cal is my old faithful so I will give the explosive a test run though I don't do PvP.
---
If they are unowned (which is the case much of the time), just claim them like usual. There could be a period of time given, for example until the first workshop PvE defense event (that is triggered a few minutes after claiming) ends, that the newly claimed workshop cannot be contested by others. To prevent abuse, a cooldown could be introduced as well, so that a player cannot just keep claiming the same workshop over and over. On failure to complete a defense event, the workshop becomes unowned again.
---
If a player wants someone else's already owned workshop, and the owner is present in the workshop area, then it is more complicated. One possibility is to increase the caps cost of claiming significantly: it remains low like before for an unowned workshop, otherwise medium cost if owned but the owner is absent, or high cost if the owner is present and active. But a large percentage of the cost is refunded (e.g. 450 out of 500 initial caps) if the new owner successfully completes the above mentioned first "defend workshop" event. I imagine a system like that would discourage trolling, if you want someone else's workshop, it costs either a lot of caps, or time investment to defend it.
---
Another idea is to let the current owner extend the immunity to being contested by actively building something that costs resources. The important thing is to prevent both infinite farming with an AFK mule character, while also not making griefing and trolling too easy. Although to be honest, for someone who does not want to PvP, virtually anything would be better than the current system.
---
Thats a pretty good idea actually. Never thought of doing that
---
can't remember- it claimed to chuck out 5 gig/sec on a usb 3. Dont have any usb3 devices to actually test that claim. wasn't cheap, and trusted brand, but it plugs in anywhere and powers off the usb only. Would need to check if its ssd or not. ( I do remember thinking ' 5 gig/sec ?????' , but reviewed at the time as one of the fastest. maybe they fudged the fiqures and its 5 gig BIT/sec).
---
these are the blocked ones:
---
# KAY STARR - (Everybody's Waitin' for) The Man with the Bag (1950)
---
# Count Basie - Good Morning Blues
---
# Margaret Whiting And Jimmy Wakely - Silver Bells
---
Sweet I'm moving lol where is it? I can't find it on the F76 Map
---
Yeah that‚Äôs from nuka world lol
---
Ah okay then I have them all as well, I could have sworn someone said there's still one out there recently. maybe they didn't have all 3 yet, I'm sure they'll add it in at some point though, seems like all the Fallout 4 DLC PA paints were free open world items.
---
I bought a 3* Quad Assault Rifle - Exploding Bullets - and something else (Resistance or +1 to a special cant remember) for 900
---
Wait... You need the plan? Does this apply to all weapons?
---
Cause that means I have wasted quite some scrip... üòÇ
---
That's a great idea actually.
---
Something else important to remember is that dead in the water has a guaranteed 3star item in the blue steamer trunk in the pump control room after the strangler heart. This is the only guaranteed 3star item across all raids
---
Yes the community is "nice", and survival aspects are technically there, but it's all so infantile at this point. Survival is more an issue of constantly managing our excesses... where's the challenge in that? People are more interested in dressing up as Disney characters and giving noobs 300 stimmies bcuz they don't have space to hoard their millions. Don't you remember the genuine fear and challenge you'd experience in FO4? They've removed all that in lieu of gimmicky costumes, paint jobs, &amp; super power God weapons. The update material almost never adds actual immersion content in the fallout world, just new cutesy stuff &amp; fluff. They even took away the survival mode! 
---
As for name tags, they're just dumb. Can't even blend in, stealth, etc... not that it matters since PvP barely even exists anymore. Maybe you like the Hello Kitty version of fallout but that wasn't the core of the title. I don't want "my little pony in the comic book version of the wasteland". Maybe it pays them, but it's sooo far from the games concept, it's just sad. I like a challenge, maybe you don't, and fallout was always about that, with gritty realism thrown in. Not the baby game it's become.
---
They work quite differently, with VFFR you can stay alive with your eyes closed, but explosive weapons can injure yourself if you‚Äôre not careful when enemies come too close too fast.
---
Probably 75 cents on ebay, but eBay will take a dollar of that, so maybe just put it in your vendor for caps
---
He specified diluted rad x which does not stop mutation effects
---
Yesterday I found someone selling a Bloodied, Faster Fire Rate, 90 reduced weight Gatling that was like 2000 caps, an absolutely steal. Always look at vendors that have weapons even if they have only 1 or 2 displayed, their sometimes worth checking out.
---
Probably, SATA3 is like 6Gbps. So if that was a selling point, then they were trying to pull one over on you and others.
---
1TB SSDs are only about $100 these days. Get an external enclosure for ~$10-$20, and you have yourself a big and cheap external drive.
---
Happy to help! I do this kind of stuff more than actually playing the game these days, haha
---
I have a 1\* Instigating Handmade that I wouldn't part with for any amount of caps. Would love it to have more stars, but its such a beast of a weapon for my fully specced sniper. 
---
Also have a 1\* Bloodied Meat Hook for sale in my vendor for 1076 caps, I'm surprised no one has snatched that up yet
---
Sadly it does confirm all of them died out
---
I got bash and limb damage on all but 2 weapons.... Out of 25
---
Gosh why waste the scrip on melee weapons if you don‚Äôt use it. But yes bss superslege is very powerful, I‚Äôve been able to loot two of them from creatures, one is 1 strength the other is 90WR.
---
Yeah I had one of those for months and months. Then found a 2 star inst with limb damage and now have a 3 star explosive instigating!
---
I would prefer a loadable basement/cellar door mechanic since underground storage is used in WV in a lot of areas its doable, then i can move most of my function stuff inside it and have more decorations or structure to my camp.
---
Yep.  It's Wall Decor.
---
Yeah last sale I got two ghoul slayers gamma guns in a row and the first roll on my next character was a ghoul slayers gamma gun, fucking "random" right?
---
I built a floating camp my current location about L50.  Didn't take long to fill the budget.  Had floors, resource extractor, all workbenches, a 5 of each type of required plant adhesive farm, 4 turrets, 2 small purifiers, a few pictures, bobblehead display, 2 mag racks, 2 vending machines, and 3 display cases.  
---
Couldn't do full walls or a roof - out of budget.
---
same thing -saw other people massive camps, multiple missile turrets, couldn't figure out how.
---
At L148 or so, I scrapped everything in my camp except the fusion generator, including all stored items, then rebuilt from scratch.
---
This time, though, I equipped the contractor perk before I started building.
---
  My house is the same footprint, but on the ground.  
---
6 foundation pieces, walls, roof, 5 mag racks, 6 display cases, the resource extractor, generator, all the workbenches and turrets... mostly using oil lamp streetlights instead of electric light - no wiring needed.  still have the misc decorations.   
---
==
---
TL;DR: Some here have said player level and the contractor perk doesn't matter, so its subjective:
---
Comparing the two builds in the same location, rebuilding with contractor perk allowed a lot more stuff to be built.
---
  I may retry the floating build.  In he 100 levels I was floating, no critters were able to get up the stairs/inside and start destroying things.  
---
  Even though I have no doors on the  ground floor on this build, last weekend, had 2 scorched get up a flight of stairs, though a door, and down a flight of stairs to get inside and shoot up the place.
---
It never confirms Raleigh Clay‚Äôs or Abbigail Singh‚Äôs death, nor the crazy guy from the ransacked bunker who was going to the moonshiners shack by vault 76. Also it‚Äôs possible the Free States movement extended further into Maryland (which would make sense cause Maryland is nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Free State‚Äù) as Raleigh Clay‚Äôs bunker and Senator Blackwell‚Äôs bunker are TECHNICALLY in Maryland, not West Virginia (if going by real world geographics and how the Monongahela River is the border between the two states)
---
It's 5 minutes, according to a couple of older posts.
---
I would really want to try one. Not online until a few hours though.
---
Use it as a hat
---
Sounds like you need to go back to 5th grade and learn about probability, throw in some computer classes and learn how RNG works while you're at it. That's if you can manage it between your wailing and gnashing of teeth over a video game.
---
I 100% disagree...  I have the original Liberty Prime PA armors (I am assuming they act exactly the same) and I don't get why people say it talks too much??
---
It says a line when you get in to it, then it says a line any time there is a hostile in the vicinity.  Period.  
---
Which I appreciate because half the time he calls out an enemy before I even spot them... which is useful.
---
Are we really going to wattle into a monetization discussion again?
---
I had one settlement in FO4 that was nearly all cats.
---
It‚Äôs not necessarily creepy, it just gives that kind of dark ambience and desolate vibes that just make the area seem creepy.
---
Wear headphones, volume near max, and explore deep into the Mire at the far east!
---
I had a Suppressors Explosive Fixer once, sold it for 3500.
---
But that is a pretty amazing find you have
---
Yeesh. No need to be so snood about it.
---
Thank you!
---
Serums are easily available for 300 caps, making most mutation loadouts about 1500 caps. So for about 1 day worth of caps, you can have the exact mutations you want. 
---
As for card stacks, you will eventually need each tier for many of the cards.
---
Nice museum!
---
If I had seen that Hook, I would of.
---
I find Fixers in general sell for good amounts. Sold a 3 star medic for 8k caps
---
It's not a fast travel location. Go to the Welch Station in the Ash Heap and head up the stairs to the north. It's the little aluminum structure with the cat picture on the counter.
---
I have bunker buster. 
---
I've used it when I'm not up to meleeing a powerful enemy.  Like when I was in the ranger station tower and could see a legendary SSQ near that stand of pink trees.
---
Or from the roof of cottage row at WS to take out the L91 glowing deathclaw near the fountain.
---
Have also used it against mireluck queens and 3\* yogis.
---
300+ DMG, but only get about 10 shots out of it before it breaks.
---
At least bear arms drops the weight to something a bit more reasonable.
---
We need some mutated hogs
---
I sold it that low as the only good thing about it was the Explosive. Kept my BFFR15 of cause, well kind of.
---
*Everyone Liked That*
---
The red/white string also projects the Nuka Cola logo on the wall which would be awesome for this build.
---
All of my 1 stars are 100 caps. My 2 stars are 200 caps and my 3 stars are 300 caps. Sometimes if i smoke a lot, its even lower. But never above that. 
---
That goes for weapons and armor. None of it matters to me. 
---
Im not concerned with weapons or scrip as ive already got an arsenal for my character that i enjoy playing with. I dont do pvp, so crazy damage is useless to me. And i usually never play alone so i dont have any need to be able to dominate any bosses with one shots. 
---
Im also not concerned with caps as my camp is done so im not hunting new plans, i dont use PA so i dont need those expensive ass plans, and im already so mutated that im being hoisted as an FEV posterchild. Lol. I have enough plans to craft everything i need... Why should i go out of my way to cap gouge too?
---
*The jet will make you jittery... guess she was right.*
---
Well, I majored in programming, and umm you don't learn probability in 5th grade. I mean I'm sure you did because you're such a fucking genius. There's no such thing as random, learn about it instead of just throwing the dumbfuck "RNG" letters around as if you know what you're talking about. How does a computer get a "random number" I bet you don't fucking know. Here's a hint, it's not fucking random...
---
And a prosperous future to you and yours
---
Nuke dark gives 1 str and 1 endurance, can be boosted up to 6 of each if you have party boy and cola nut
---
Or, at least on Windows, being able to launch a game in general from right clicking the Bethesda.net launcher icon.
---
Meltdown is the most frustrating awful quest I‚Äôve ever seen in any video game.  Even if it worked perfectly and didn‚Äôt crash. You couldn‚Äôt pay me to run that again.
---
Fair nuff! I like collecting uncommon/rare stuff so that‚Äôs why I do it. Caps are just another means to buy them. What‚Äôs your IGN (PC?) I‚Äôll come buy all your stuff xD
---
I am also hoping they'll bring him back with the Wastelanders. Would be perfect time- "*this dog's been following the caravan but he doesn't belong to anyone. You can have him, one less mouth to feed."*
---
Instigating, Faster Fire and 90% WR would be my god roll weapon. The third star is just grave tho, I'd be happy with any 3rd effect other than 250 DR reload
---
Would make sense to WV too
---
PS4?
---
a fully grown deathclaw matriarch &lt;3
---
I really hope they build persistent workshops at least soon. And maybe a method to have your private world be separate from your adevnture world so you can always go back to private on the same instance.
---
They do need an option in the workshop to release it so you do not get constant retake events when you lose it.
---
With those two things we can truly start to rebuild the wasteland. A player could use workshops as extended camps in their constant private world and invite people in for tours. I would love to work with some folks and create a series of private worlds where we rebuild on a persons private world one section of the wasteland.
---
For instance one person could rebuild poseidon and a few of the workshops it powers like billings farm, sunshine meadows, the airport. Then invite people into your private world and you can walk around a rebuilt part of the wasteland and make small stories for people to experience. 
---
Also place your camp in the region to act as another building to explore.
---
Have another person in their private world rebuild another area with a few workshops close together. If we got a team of 4-6 people we could make it so people could wander in completely repaires wasteland and make a video series out of it.
---
As soon as an enemy is detected on your compass thing liberty prime will speak. That's why I like it. And that's why he talks so much at an scorchbeast queen event.
---
My husband always shares super duper when I am on my little toon and oh how much that helps me.  Also I have serums for a cheap price if your on xbox.  Stay filthy!
---
My GT is just my username with a space in between the s and the x. Lol. Couldnt put the space on reddit. 
---
Alas. On xbox.
---
Tl;dr: "Waaaaah! I didn't get exactly what I wanted!" 
---
"it's not fucking random"
---
That's the point, you absolute fucking mongoloid.
---
Why don't you cry a little louder and see if Mommy will bring you some tendies, you crybaby bitch?
---
You're not alone in noticing #10.

Not sure if anyone suggested this but using a shotgun and enforcer rank 3 will make it so tht you can get it stationary (hopefully in a close spot by targeting all 4 thrusters. It slows with each one that breaks and will stop completely most times on the last one. After that it just takes some time.
---
the 2 missles at once looks really neat though.
---
I have seen 2-3 hanging around that exact location before... never that many though! 
---
Almost spooky.
---
As serums are plentiful and cheap at vendors, I'm thinking of grabbing the ones I want to redo, then taking off Starched Genes before a cleansing rad shower.
---
I hope we get some Vim decor soon tbh, I'm on the same boat as you, I adore the theme of Vim and if they added more of it to the atomic store I would instantly buy it. I wonder if they would possible add Vim as a consumable in the near future as part of Wastelanders, like we got a shipment sent to West Virginia or some reason.
---
flat black, that atomic camo some people hate, and perhaps a desert/red camo would be awesome.
---
I know I would probably spend five times more atoms if the prices were cut in half. As it is I barely spend my falloit first atoms, they are just starting to pile up because at this price point I pick and choose maybe one thing at most. 
---
At a lower price point I would spend all my atoms and buy more so I could load up on outfits and camp items that may work together nicely for my concept characters.
---
And bring back the nuka set so I can create my dang nuka girl character! If they did that I would buy it all and spin up a new alt immediately.

To date, my AA LMG and resolute veteran do the most damage per hit.  IIRC, they hit in the mid 30's lower 40s.
---
 They far out-damage the vampire 50, which only gets about 20 per.
---
Fanboy/employee went full retard üëå

Looks great!  Also good to see that new wallpaper in action!  I am still figuring out where I want to use it.  Stay filthy!!

Look at today‚Äôs Appalachia‚Äôs reality: Players are hung through and through with uniyeld. armor; they armed to the teeth with bllodied weapons; perks + chems. 
---
These bloody b***rds are real death-machines of wastelands
---
Where is the interest to kill 99,9% of Appalachia‚Äôs fauna when these cute little (or big) animals &amp; funny green supermuts prepare to die only looking on such death-machine?
---
Save Appalachia for future generations! Kill players!

Occasionally you can get a handful of caps or a nuclear waist but honestly it‚Äôs so low it‚Äôs not worth it
---
I like that idea
---
What would be a very good reason as to why I haven‚Äôt seen it. 
---
Xbox.
---
Think I paid 1000 or 1500 for my 1\* Bloodied Assault Rifle.
---
Best caps I ever spent. Yeah, it'd be nice if it had more affixes, but it was my gateway into Bloodied and still my main workhorse while I await a better roll.
---
Though lately my 2\* Bloodied Pick Axe (faster swing) has been doing most of the indoor work. Cleared West Tek with it alone last night, including 2 3\* and a 2\* Legendary.

lol you‚Äôre a rich pawn-shop owner üòÇ

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Disease chance can be mitigated by legendary armor (-25% environmental disease chance), perk cards under endurance, and a higher endurance build overall. Radaway also increases disease chance by 50%. All that said, I still get sick way too often in this game, too.
---
This is the correct answer. I always buy them when I see them in vendors at a reasonable price. It saves me having to run around in circles taking pot shots with my lever action for 15 minutes.
---
IIRC, it's 180 world items and 60 containers.
---
&gt; As for card stacks, you will eventually need each tier for many of the cards.
---
I still wish we had the feature to raise and lower card star levels once you combine the cards.
---
So you just don't know what the R in RNG means, cool. Nice flailing 180 degree idiocy there buddy. And noone is mad, except you apparently, because you don't know wtf you are talking about.
---
sometimes you can find them in trainstation suitcases, cos thats where I dump mine. I'm maxxed out on scrip, wot do do with them- dump them. Worst thing is, i play late at night,3/4 left on server, I know there still sitting there when I log out.
---
I always carry Fireproof Level 3 so no problem with that.  Have a VE Handmade and a ZE Autocombat rifle I use outside blast zones in crowds with no problem.  Highly recommend Fireproof.   I stand in or on buses at WS that explode with no damage to me but take out Glowing Ones.  Also makes you invulnerable to SB sonic attacks.

I believe they are in

You can change the paint on those. Check the guys post above
---
Across 4 different characters, different servers.. oh well lol
---
I've done many of these things already and it doesn't seem to help. This is far and away the most annoying part of the game for me right now and actually making it unfun to play.
---
Balls moving by themselves! This game is scary enough, now I‚Äôm gonna avoid all playgrounds
---
So you just don't understand English either.
---
"How does a computer get a 'random number?'"
---
Your own words. Get back on the short bus, you utter spastic, nobody cares that you are butthurt because you didn't get the rolls you wanted. Imagine not learning probability in basic mathematics classes in 5th grade and still being unaware you're mentally deficient. Please cry some more, your whining is great entertainment.
---
Its not a bad game,I'm just not going to encourage Bethesda further.
---
Neither has it for me. I always fast travel to the same few spots, regardless of where I put the CAMP module, and other players seem to fast travel to the exact same spots in my CAMP as I do.
---
I mean bloodied, Junkies and certain Berserker one stars are worth 1k. I mean in the end game what is 1000 caps anyway.
---
would love to see snow in FO76 and in the high elevations all winter long
---
Never seen an Insta FFR handmade and I have a handmade dedicated vendor so am always on the lookout..
---
Yep Fireproof works wonders, but sometimes i still get myself killed when ghouls get too close when I‚Äôm firing. Maybe armor mods could help too, haven‚Äôt tried those yet.
---
Their cap limit resets 20 hours (in real-time) after you sell something to them. I think the same applies to the Legendary Vendor with scrip limits.
---
RIP your gears from throwing down many turrets at once.
---
I got a AA, ffr, fr tesla, and quad 25/25 handmade.
---
I'm still not butthurt and I'm not whining at all. The entertainment is in all this make believe shit you're imagining to make yourself feel intelligent. And you've had plenty of time to Google it, but still just shit talking as if you know something nobody else does
---
I've never had this but that sounds like a pretty shit time for it to happen lol
---
Hmmm, maybe if there were 5x as many legendary perks and there were a bit weaker but more interesting. As it stands most everyone would make the same 2-3 legendaries. 
---
Honestly I wish we had real private servers with the option to turn legendaries off.
---
Your bitching about the rolls you got is the definition of whining. Shut the fuck up or play a different game.
---
"Mommy! The videogame is being mean to me again! Please breastfeed me!"
---
My understanding is that it is 20 hours after your first sale after the last reset. 
---
So, if your first sale was at 9pm then the cap limit will be reset at 5pm the next day.
---
From memory somebody ages ago said the notification doesn't work but that you will get something from them.
---
I've never tested this by dropping every item I have and searching one though.
---
I've gotten diseases from mobs I've killed with ranged shots where they never hit me, so yeah... That said, the only truly overpowered contagious mobs in the game seem to be high-level diseased ghouls. They are basically a guaranteed radworm infection on the first hit.
---
Good explanation! So I bought more than just a fancy loading speed up ahhaha awesome thanks!
---
That'd be awesome! Heading to Salzburg, Austria in a week in part so my wife can photograph the Krampus March so it'd be extra cool to see that this year.
---
It's 20 hours after you first dip into that 1400 cap pool, AFAIK.
---
ammo is simple fusion cells. tesla is a regular drop from bos events like 'heart of the ememy'. cant think off hand wether there is a difinitive drop loc.
---
Just shop vendors until you find the ones that sell serums for less than 200 (not uncommon) and then buy them up. After that, clear your mutations and put back everything you need. You can find good deals on them if you look a little bit.
---
I get it from heart if the enemy quite a bit.
---
Maybe you'd like a dictionary for "pretentious"
---
Nitpicking. Now there's a word for your post.
---
Nice. 
---
Just don't be too dissapointed when the next update changes the build behaviour of some items.
---
This is a fantastic idea but the design and money Bethesda would need to spend to include this just for the festive season make it unlikely.
---
Maybe a Krampus head we can wear and terrorise other players?
---
Dense chest mods and max fireproof together are awesome. Now stand on top of exploding cars drop nuka grenades at my own feet lol don't even notice health going down!
---
Mamy thanks
---
Me jealous
---
Haha that‚Äôs an awesome picture, I‚Äôll have to try that üëçüèª
---
Thank you, I won't
---
Thnx!
---
Getting sick from killing something at range is pretty daft, but I just accept they did their best and there are fundamental limitations in this game engine or the developers to code stuff or they don't realise?
---
Lumbermill is just south of 76, Gilman's Lumbermill :)
---
That type of thing is what made me want to try it.üëç
---
Me too if you just wanna add me then we can try it or we can just team up Everytime we are on....no mic I'm antisocial too so no bigs.
---
Yeah the modulus on the number of seconds since 1/1/1970 isn't random, so it isn't RNG, it's other functions it is put into. 4 assaultron heads is silly lol
---
 I don't use either. Combat Knives are the bomb. I really doubt it was the same.
---
Thanks for that! If you scroll down in this thread I think someone linked a Spotify rebuild of the playlist. It's mostly accurate and should work for Americans. :)
---
Anything really, even like a wallpaper we could display the pictures on.  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs enough creativity in this community to come up with some awesome murals.  Even the billboards!  There‚Äôs so many options they could go with, but simple picture frames would be my top choice.
---
Sell within your means you greedy pig
---
If they were to do such a thing in fallout 76, it would probably be a boss variants of the normal sheepsquatch.  With a different fur pattern, more powerful attacks, and a large sack stuck to the back of its impaled through the spikes that is full and oozes blood.
---
Guess you could hide it behind some walls, don't even have to use it as a staircase really :p
---
Also saw a loading screen or something that showed it laying on a table.
---
Yep. They added this a while ago. So you've probably been missing out and/or didnt realize.
---
Tyty
---
Not the presidential PA, that's a possible event reward  you can choose from "Race for the Presidency" (if you win) that hasn't been released yet and doesn't look like the ones displayed in the promo's. It's most likely a Secret Service variant of power armor everyone has been saying it is. I definitely agree that it has to do with the Enclave though given the oval office being the overseer office in the bunker. The art for Wastelander's also displays someone in X0-1 with a plasma caster which screams Enclave.
---
PSN is the same.  Got it already just spamming invites.  Not too classy.
---
- Well, there is a taste for everything. I‚Äôm glad you like it, BUT I HATED IT!! lol
---
Seek professional help. Also watch "Hereditary" as it may explain the clicking sound.
---
Man i have hades in the past but accidentally scrapped it. I try and look for you as well
---
Oh absolutely
---
I don't like shitty games.
---
People keep giving money to shitty games.
---
They make more shitty games.
---
I don't like people who give money to shitty games.
---
Pretty straightforward logic.
---
The problem is mostly the cap limit. Good weapons sell for over 30k+ so people aren't going to put them in their machines.
---
Breaking up perk cards would be OP you should only be able to do it limited times though to keep it a challenge maybe once every 5-10 levels
---
Your taste in games is bad and you should feel bad.
---
PS: I‚Äôm not those guys that hate everything and unload their frustration on the Internet. But, in this case... I do!!
---
Nailed it.
---
I dunno, I feel like most of the vendors I go to have just a few worthwhile things, and either nothing else in their shop or they fill them up with workshop plans that are dime a dozen.
---
I think 120 slots for sale at a time is pretty generous.
---
As for items being tied to your stash, I don't see another way around it.
---
Are you suggesting unlimited weight for vendor storage? Or a separate weight limit? Unlimited weight would 100% not work. People would exploit that, and you'd end up traveling to a vendor that looks well stocked only to realize the owner is using it for extra storage space with all items listed at 25k so they don't sell, or something like that.
---
Best solution: don't fight diseased monsters
---
Maybe just a reskin of the Sheepsquatch?
---
That sucks. I was actually blessed yesterday as I rolled two Fixers one of which was a Bloodied! and a couple other pretty good rolls. I just got lucky because past experience always gave me complete garbage.
---
That would work except when it wouldn't. It's a piece of apparel, meaning PA would be unable to wear a helmet. A better system would be when you join a world you select Survivor or Raider. Survivors act just as the game does currently, with Pacifist mode on and off. Raider works as you stated, not knowing if someone is hostile or friendly but just a Raider symbol to alert them of possible danger.
---
True dat. Worth the 8000 caps I paid. Got a 3\* 2 shot yesterday. Finally a combat rifle worth using!
---
Didnt realize, usually cap scrips through vendor, then would move on to other stuff. That's an additional 50+ scrips a day that I just left unrealized lol. Could have been getting 2 3star rolls a day. Figured i'd post it for ppl like me who are not always quickest on the uptake.
---
Not all accounted for. The ones who were there at the end died. Several are listed as missing
---
As suggested further up they could easyly work off the Sheepsquatch-Model since Krampus bascialy IS a huge humanoid goat aswell. Just decorate him propperly and done
---
I would totaly dig that.
---
DELETE THIS. I don't want this fixed.
---
Not exactly, not so long ago there was a topic here with a requested to do something because Item had been lost, despote additional pop-up message.
---
Optimization as well, which I know some people scoff at, but it's true. I tend to not refill my vendors as often as I should because it practically lags my game out to go through the selling/cycling process and thats just for 30 in machine x4, so I wouldnt get much use out of a bigger increase cause I can barely fill them as is. The "item has been updated from server" or whatever absolutely murders my speed, rubber bands my game, and sometimes crashes me. I'd could agree for it not counting against stash, would be able to see a lot more heavy guns for sale.
---
Which is why in those old black and white film reels you never saw a red model T......... Oh, wait a minute. ü§îüôÇ
---
I've been playing in the same 4 person team for almost a year and we all got the trophy.
---
Is this a feature, like it happens by design? Or is it just something that tends to happen?
---
thanks! I appreciate it, i think they must be pretty rare
---
Sounds like a great plan! PSN is Unholy\_Camel, I'll be on most of the night tonight after like 6:00 (east coast time) ...we could boost the revive one too if you need that one, my camp has a perfect cliff behind it that will just barely kill you without an instant respawn if you jump off it
---
Learn something new every day. I tend to play around the same time each day and I dont think I've ever realized when it changed, just always knew it did
---
You dont have a BSS +1str combat knife. Quit lyin
---
This bug sucks balls. I got it again the other day after drinking out of a punch bowl. The first time it happened, I thought it was just because I left and reloaded mid-trip. But, nope, it‚Äôs just an awful bug. It lasts so freaking long.
---
That's because due to the mass production speed that Henry Ford had invented, black lacquer paint dried fast enough to be dry at the end of the line. Later Dupont would come out with a colored paint that dried fast and Chevrolet started seeing larger success.
---
I agree, an ass would probably hold more bullets.
---
Still no Nuka Fridge.  Only reason to log in is to get the wallpaper it seems.  Feh.
---
Not interested in any more turret or crafting skins unless they stop the ‚Äúoversights‚Äù and start being consistent across the board. 
---
The art team does good work and then it‚Äôs canabalized to hell and back for the AS which leaves much to be desired.  
---
Examples:
---
-	turret skins don‚Äôt have spotlights
---
-	nukashine bench doesn‚Äôt have a fermenter counterpart and looks like crap without it.
---
-	generator skins cover one, some, varying amounts of objects. 
---
 -	none for windmill, reactor.
---
Any patterns you see are just confirmation bias. It's not completely random but all effects are available all the time so the chances of a specific role are something like 214k:1. Somebody smarter did the math, probably some of the data miners have done it multiple times.
---
i was able to place it on the front drawers of the Thanksgiving display bureau as well. i actually
---
got it to work on some weird slanted walls where my camp is (not camp walls, existing building walls). it seems pretty flexible. it‚Äôs not big but it isn‚Äôt too small either.
---
Or why if you had to tune into a specific radio station and that would opt in to a fun PvP mode?  I wish the game would implement something like that
---
Precisely because of this attitude, the games industry is in the shape it is today. We like to blame the "big, evil AAA publishers", but they're literally just responding to what consumers are willing to buy. If there wasn't people willing to put up with cheap, overly monetized games, they wouldn't dominate the market. The consumer gets what they're willing to pay for, and because people buy brands "on faith", they slowly erode the quality of a given product. Let me put it to you this way:
---
If you buy a sandwich, and it has a band-aid in it, do you still go to that restaurant because they need your money to hire a better cook or clean their kitchen?
---
If you buy a TV, and it burns out within a couple weeks, do you keep buying that brand so they can invest in better QA and hope they don't keep using the cheapest components?
---
The free market only leads to better products and services if we actually vote with our purchasing power. If you don't have standards, then a company won't either, because that's not their reason for existing, they exist to maximize profit. Blind faith in a profit machine is a sure fire way to get crap product for a premium price. 
---
But I'm probably wasting my breath, people will still waste money on inferior services and keep lowering the bar. Like P.T Barnum famously said, "There's a sucker born every minute."
---
On PvP will be awesome!! I‚Äôll hunt them all!! XD
---
It‚Äôs to promote playing more so doubt it will change
---
i can try it on a world table in an hour or so if i want to hear back before purchasing.
---
Scorched earth and encrypted events.
---
If you do a silo run, you'll obtain a fair amount of cells, same with encryptid event. Other place is farming Whitesprings robots and watoga robots. I've got tesla rifles as drops through Robobrains, so any event that would spawn them would have a small chance. They also carry the Tesla plan, rare chance.
---
Naw
---
Im curious to know why you want to remove a specific mutation? Or do you mean you have one that you don‚Äôt want anyone?
---
Easiest was to do mutations is to get the serums from vendors for the mutations that you want to run, after you have equipped all the ones you want, put on the luck card Starched Genes. Job done....
---
Good to know. I‚Äôll try that! It‚Äôs sad because the armor is beautiful, but the voice kills it!
---
I‚Äôm not really sure. It might be I learned about from this video from InnovSurvivalist: https://youtu.be/0V8nA6os-S0
---
I don't think I knew there was one, I'm interested in this as well.
---
My bad. You know what game you'd like? Duke Nukem Forever. Its right up your alley I bet.
---
He is basically a commentator for the gaming industry and other forms of media very insightful
---
LK just has genuine concerns for the community around the game he dislikes the way the fans have been treated throughout the development of the game
---
Ohh ok cheers mate
---
LK just has genuine concerns for the community around the game he dislikes the way the fans have been treated throughout the development of the game, as a game designer myself I too have been bamboozled by Bethesdas creative decisions I'm just glad that there is still support for the Fallout franchise
---
I had always heard that only where it started mattered and moving it does nothing. That's also been my experience.
---
I hunt Scorchbeasts for food. Its something to do in the mire where I live.
---
Here, here. I've spent 6-7k scrip during past sales and got items somehow worse that what I was scripping. This sale, got an AA Vats Crit+50% +1 Per. The Fixer, a BE submachine gun, and a (lol) TSFFR Missle launcher. It's all random. Some times its good, and sometimes it's awful
---
u/Ladydevann please pass this on.
---
We could call it Huntsman vs Prey or something, idk
---
93 a day
---
No I‚Äôm not after any specific combination, I‚Äôm looking at the odds of one effect at a time, some (suppressor, stalker) have significantly higher chance than others (bloodied or AA). The result this time aligns very well with my last scrip dump during last ‚Äòsale‚Äô, the difference is it shifted from ‚Äòextra bashing‚Äô and ‚Äòlimb damage‚Äô to ‚Äòvats chance‚Äô and ‚Äò10 when aim‚Äô.  
---
I understand that they don‚Äôt want everyone to walk around with god rolls so certain effects WILL have lower drop chance by design. But this current rate is so much lower than before.
---
Blackwater Mine, especially Uranium Fever....East and West Big Bend tunnels...whole tunnel
---
Vault Tek agro research maybe for the robots, low level.
---
Well, that escalated quickly
---
Caps poor.
---
I got to "Pleasent Valley Cabins". I just kill everything there and loot EVERYTHING from their corpses and collect the tin cans from the tin can chims. Once done i find a workbench and put the "scrapper" perk in intelligence and scrap all the stuff i collected. Normally get 600-700 steel each run which lasts me for a while.
---
Hah. I actually have a bloodied explosive 25% reduced vats combat rifle sitting in my inventory. It‚Äôs the only item I don‚Äôt use that I‚Äôm not selling in my vendor. I‚Äôm holding on to it for direct trade purposes.
---
Tried the whole same server thing, got some good rolls with one character, swapped characters and it was all, every single one, awful. It's just random
---
Well, I don't want to do it on the fly, it's more of a "I moved one skill point and now I can't equip my five-perk card so now I need to get four more of the one I already have five of."
---
WV Lumber North West corner, super mutants, sneak and hide, I farm steel there often, loads of junk too.
---
Mine. Unlock the excavator power armor. Just west of where you unlock it, there is tons of steel to smelt.
---
I have sold several 1\* Bloodied items for 1000-500 caps, Handmade, DCG, Meathook. Sold a Junkies Gatling gun for 1000 a few days ago as well.
---
Just the usual separate limit for the vending machines, seen loads of people ask for that I know, would be interesting to see if it changed peoples trading behaviour.
---
There is a bunch that haven't been released yet tbh.
---
I have a lvl 45 3\* Instigating FFR handmade, it's been on my mule for weeks now, I'm on XBL if you want to make an offer on it.. I also have a Quad with FFR too - I think. (I hope I'm not mixing up the two, I'm farily certain the Inst. has the FFR on it.)
---
Doesn‚Äôt make it any less true that Bethesda monetized suggestions and will likely monetize more
---
The cap limit would be so easy to increase, massively too, surely no server load, but may it impact the Atom store?
---
Until they add 4 and 5 star legendaries, this is as close as I can get. My primed 3 star fixer looks cool because its got 5 lines of effect, but it's also cause its new and hasnt reached market saturation yet.
---
This would essentially be an exploit for added stash, put all excess ammo in vendor for 30k caps, put power armor in vendor for 30k caps, etc
---
I've never noticed that when I bothered to run vending machines but maybe platform dependant, I'm on PC? Only have one machine with ammo and 2 weapons at the moment. I'm just to damn lazy to bother and only have one character so can't stockpile on mules.
---
PSN is JerseysGhost Level 297 but still have yet to find a dedicated team to run these with .-.
---
I could see that, they would still have to balance it right. I will say (even though this might ruffle a few feathers) getting FO1st and the scrapbox took my vending game to the next level. 
---
I can now keep more stuff stocked in my machines, and I have greater quantities of junk stocked at all times. I can stockpile a thousand of the best sellers, then keep 10 bulk of each in my vendor at all times.
---
I will say, I think if they gave the scrapbox to everyone, it would help vendors immensely.
---
Not all plans, just for ones like bear arm and the fixer
---
Good show though
---
I enjoy taking workshops for the waves of creatures and potential legendary.
---
Heard a rumor about 'cross map sniping' and had not taken one since.
---
Thank you for explaining this.
---
I get it...  1800 atoms is a lot to spend and then not be happy!
---
&gt;the owner is using it for extra storage space with all items listed at 25k so they don't sell
---
Very good point, hadn't thought of that, bet it would happen.
---
I sold mine for 4k a few months ago. People like it because it counts as a soda and alcohol so it benefits from both perk bonuses. People are able to get +6 str with the proper perks
---
Can traps
---
I am all for new group events with boss creatures, so hell yes.
---
Sorry on PC :(
---
Except for all the beer and partying you can handle. Message is set to repeat.
---
No
---
no, go play fo4 instead
---
Good point, I love the Sheepsquatch, they should capitalise that good design.
---
There's a perk card that when leveled, gives you a 50% discount in the atom shop. Lol
---
What platform?
---
I wanted it to be to most simple and clean version possible :)
---
I had the opposite problem the other night trying to catch Whoopsies for the atom reward. Lucked into the perfect scenario in the bog and got one diseased mirelurk spawn to follow me into a building after downing the queen in the quarry, and had to let that little fucker wail away on me for almost half an hour before it finally infected me.
---
This would have been a great way to introduce the old survival server.
---
The biggest problem for vending is the cap limit. This is why you dont get great vendors. If I fill my vendors with good stuff, it sells. When I get close to the cap limit, I turn the vendor off, until I find enough ammo supplies in other vendors.  Most of the time it is off. 20k in sales in a few hours is normal. I cant spend it fast enough. 
---
But increasing the cap limit just increases prices.  So what we really need is something to spend caps on.
---
Wait...Organ music from the church...?
---
But yeah, the Mire is atmospheric as all heck. My first encounter with a wild Mothman was there, and I never saw it coming. I'm just creeping through this swamp, and I turn around and he's flying right at me. Cue me screaming and running like a madman.
---
Maybe the Mire is supposed to be creepy. Every...Biome...Has a certain feel to it, like a zone theme.
---
I definitely agree on your caps point. Inflation is a huge issue that I hope gets addressed. Would coins to scrip solve that issue? Caps become undervalued when you know longer need to spend them, while legendaries and scrip overvalued, so what if you could exchange caps for scrip, say 1 scrip for 500 caps. Even at a full 30k, that's only 60 scrip so not game breaking, but does give people something to actually spend caps on. Thoughts?
---
Fuck da blackbirds armor all me and my homies rock is patriot üòé
---
Do you have any Junkies or bloodied weapons, or Vanguard Heavy combat/Heavy leather with Weapon weight or food, drink, chem reduction?
---
When I was at lower levels Wade airport was my go-to. Near where my camp was (in the Forest), lots of steel, a fusion core can spawn in the tower and a short walk to Summersville Docks to scrap it (no benches at Wade) .
---
Or everything will be bright purple for a minute. I quite like that one.
---
it sort of could work, but i think the only way would be to have a dedicated computer in you house to act as a server, i don't see that happening in the near future :)
---
haha that is awesome!
---
I tried a roleplayed far harbour rad resistant character. Five leaded trapper pieces plus some extra protection from legendary Effects and perks plus under armor. I got around 200. 
---
It is good enough for radstorms, water, food, ghouls hitting you at Whitespring, etc. Like, fun all around. 
---
Not good enough for nuke zones. You still need radshield or rad x.
---
I get that one too!
---
Umm...
---
u/calgen said,
---
&gt; at this point i think we'll be lucky to get wastelanders or anything else added without having to pay extra for it
---
So u/gigaweeb responded,
---
&gt; Lucky to get Wastelanders at all. And it will almost certainly be the last big update for 76 unless it somehow manages to convince the entire Fallout fanbase to play it, which I doubt.
---
Hope that clears up the confusion.
---
how do i even catch a disease in power armor??
---
Wanted to update, after removing 500+ people off my friends list on PS4 it works again, and lots of other things have been working better in game as well.
---
down votes I'm guessing ?
---
Anyone up for it today?
---
Collect all the weapons your killed enemies drop and scrap them. You'll get mostly wood, steel+ unlock mods for those weapons.
---
Content for the BoS? How so? Sounds awesome
---
There is a poster at the train stations. Look into it!!
---
I'm sure he wants to make any statement with this. But he doesn't really have a conclusion thereü§î
---
Trick or treat is supposed to have the plasma grenade in the loot table. I've rarely seen it give grenade plans, but it has a few times.
---
My go to spot is camden park. Kill all the scorched and scrap their guns at the raider camp inside the roller coaster. There are can chimes too.
---
[Known]
---
Can confirm, this is my spot too. Good spot for recipes and plans too, there are several spawns along the outdoor market type thingie with the Raider PA deathmatch arena place. Yes, those are the technical terms.
---
How am I unhappy because you feel some weird need to lie about having that knife? Gauss rifles are pretty crap so I would hope youd give it away or scrip it.
---
Blight is almost a given down there. Sludge lung is the worst of them.
---
RIP snowglobes, meet your brother: billboards, your sister: turrets, and your cousin: brahmin pen.
---
I already have the adamantium skeleton. I had a low dt, speed/sneak/acrobat build going on. But I just don't cut it in that vault. Thanks.
---
You can never smoke too much
---
I see we both had very productive mornings.
---
I use a mod to silence the sound file on my end. That way, only other players get annoyed.
---
It is honestly scary what can happen in worse case scenarios. Last year when i bought the game on release before i stopped playing, i came towards the southern end of the mire and found this weird alien in some metal chassis, it honestly made me spooked.
---
Lol I know it's a inside joke but yeah..
---
I've only ever gotten two fixers and my most recent one is a lvl 50 jffr 1agi the fixer
---
Aren't some items instanced to each player and refuse to respawn for 20 hours of real world time, period?
---
I'm thinking of a guaranteed spawn of a handmade rifle on top of a roof in Berkeley Springs.  I would try everything to get that to spawn more often than every 20 hours and I could never make it happen.
---
I always spawn in my pond and get parasites everytime I log in. Fun times!
---
Corroborative and counter arguments, the usual. When you're looking to fix a problem you firstly want to be able to recreate it at will.  If you can't you've no way to be sure a fix you apply has worked.
---
1000 caps for a one-star? Well guess it depends on the effect, but still. I feel 100-500 caps is a better deal, depending on the weapons level and overall value (then again the game lowballs you at NPC vendors all times, every time). Besides we all know people are only buying one stars to grind into scrip.
---
Join when there‚Äôs a bunch of older players, make sure you land a hit on all the miners then you have more loots than you can carry.
---
would you like to know some American secrets? I have some.
---
Thanks!!!! I will finish up the Bos questline
---
There are 9 different spots to mine iron ore around Ft McClintock that I use everyday. Smelt It!!!!
---
It‚Äôs moderately good against scorched.
---
I would really like them to make 'Plague Walker' more useful. Make it so that when you have the mutation you don't cure illnesses on your own and add cures for each disease (I have no issue with VATS weakness illnesses but radworms pls no.)
---
But your logic is to base your prices of how high you are.. 
---
So if my prices are high because I‚Äôm high, that is indeed following your logic.. nice one downvoting a nice comment back on your reply, next time I‚Äôll just ignore youü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Farm sbq, farm legendaries, pvp, I have 3chars with 3 different but very specific builds. Do dailies, hunt for cool things in ppls vendors
---
I got that exact pick axe from AWOL armaments yesterday. My melee build needs one more slugger card to take it out for a spin
---
I‚Äôm spending scrip for my other character really lol
---
On a scale of 1 to 10 those are probably around a 6 or 7.
---
Black powder rifle might be more like an 8.
---
Ahh okay I actually didn‚Äôt know that.
---
Krampus wall mount?
---
I don't lie, dude. It is a game. All items are possible. 1200 hours playing you can bet I have bought, sold and scripped tons of weapons. When you play and visit vending machines long enough, you realise there isn't a shortage of godroll weapons. There are plenty for all of us. 
---
Remember Halloween? Bought two fireman outfits for 50 caps each. People were crazy, offering tons of ammo and max caps. I bought them right outside Whitespring. 
---
Supply, demand and hype set the prices here. Before bloodied + unyielding was a thing, I must have scripped a ton of bloodied items because I like high health. 
---
I promise I will sell it to you as soon as I get bored of it. Add me. Ps4. 
---
Only thing I never got were legacy weapons and my Moby Dick, which I am still looking for: anti-armor, faster swing +1 strength sharp knuckles.
---
You trying to give people heart attacks OP?
---
Good to know and makes sense really. Been trying to get setup with full Vanguard but will diversify. Now the question of Marine, Heavy Combat, or Scout. For looks ive been leaning towards a full Scout set. Is there a DR cap? Which is cheapest (material cost) to repair with White Knight?
---
It would be a cool event idea.
---
once you realize that the devs don't play their own game everything makes sense
---
to this date i would love ot see the dev team try to do the vault raids on expert using only crafted gear
---
- Bacteria/Virus too small for the air filter.
---
- Surface contact while repairing armor. (Effect immediate for game play &amp; technical reasons)
---
I would like to come see this dedicated handmade vendor sometime. Ign?
---
Damn Really? Ive been avoiding that one as the rewards never seemed to be worth the effort guess i will be hitting up Pumpkin House more when i log into take care of the Dailies and Atom Challenges.
---
During "Mischief Night," I got to Whitespring just after somebody had nuked it.  Nobody else around - 14 Green Bloaties and nothing but Glowing Blood and Ionized Meat.  The random drop list must be longer than just High Rad Fluids, Glowing Mass, and Hardened Mass.  Same result the last time I stumbled into nuked Morgantown.  :(
---
I had a deathclaw stick around for about 3 months. Then it mysteriously just crumpled up and dropped dead while myself and 2 friends watched. Very strange. They should definitely tweak out the system so they have more of a "durability" within CAMP confines.
---
Same as here (PC) stocks are a bit low - only got about 13 or so. Had 28 a few weeks ago
---
Weird.
---
Krampusquatch lol
---
Grafton steel. Don't claim the workshop. Just kill and loot the super mutants.
---
Ah! The Flatwoods Monster. I have only laid eyes on him once, but he poofed on me the moment I had my scope on him (I just wanted to observe). Never saw him, or Big Man the Moth again after those initial encounters. Granted I can head down to Charleston or Grafton and see a Grafton Monster whenever I want, but he's nothing to write home about. Looks like a tree and a Super Mutant had a baby.
---
But here's a tale of worse case scenario...Again, Charleston, and I hear a thumping and the ground kinda shaking...I'm like "Oh heck, that Grafton I saw in the ditch is nearby", and then my very first Scorchbeast just lands right in front of me, looks me in the eye and roars, sending me flying down the road. I screamed and ran for miles and miles and he was on me like a dog on peanut butter. Eventually I lost him and hid behind a rock for like an hour before I figured it was safe to come out, and I could see him circling Charleston. I was level 20, truly a beast worthy of my fear.
---
A Sheepquash, that has a bag of loot on his back, or dressed like santa. Or a super mutant dressed as santa.
---
Well instigating would serve not benefit on a mg42.  Now if it was furious, that thing would rock
---
Those fixers were a good find. I found a VE pump action and a JE pipe pistol this morning for 1K or so each, which I was pretty happy with.
---
the suit is waterproof yet i somehow still get sick lol
---
My first early leveled character had a habit of getting the random spawn points to frequently spawn in a vengeful(?) mothman in the Mire, I think that's the one with red eyes. I'd be running through the woods in the dark, turn and see red eyes, or the purple eyed ones, and start sprinting in a diferrent direction, hearing that *flap flap flap* and in pops up right in front of you. Dead. Terrifying. Although not as terrifying 200 levels later, it'll still make my butthole pucker up a little with headphones on.
---
This is a amazing idea, but Bethesda don't seem like they would put this in the game for all players, it would be in the atom shop and be in a bundle
---
A brown / charred Santa hat on top
---
I run primarily rifleman but I wanted to leave plenty of room to main other weapon types occasionally so I only have 7 perception. I run level 1 of each rifleman perk since the first 3 points there give you 30% damage and the next tiers are weaker so it would take 6 more points to get the next 30%. It is not a deal breaker as true min maxing isn't absolutely crucial in this game. My other perception perks are level 3 tank killer and 1 point concentrated fire.
---
It also increases the amount of materials you get back from scrapping. You get the same materials but more of them.
---
With Sim Settlements, I had cats in all my settlements, since they added happiness. The town I built at Starlight, had like 30 cats.
---
Can you clarify please: were you missing one item to repair, or couldn't find anything to repair?  The generator stuff is in Turbine Hall and roof.
---
These are the kind of builds I applaud. It's not a fort, it's not a farm, it's a tourist trap. I would visit this place.
---
Responders.
---
It's not even close. The group that was assembled to help the people by rebuilding the world? Yeah. We NEED this.
---
As far as I'm aware of, you only get plans at higher difficulties.
---
Radio vs no radio helps too. No radio on has a whole bunch of amplified strange, unsettling sound effects, especially the bunker sounds, while it's hard to feel creeped out hearing "he's hacking, and wacking, and smacking" cranked up to 11
---
Lol, that's pretty much the only thing i'm looking for right now.
---
The mire is my favorite. I run through the darkest places there no sweat. I know where things spawn and don't so I'm fine with little to no visibility. Plus I have vats ;)
---
This is an additional benefit for Bloody builds - unyielding armour provides 12-15 INT which gives +24-30% XP in addition to other bonuses
---
BOOMERS , FIENDS, AND KINGS OH MY
---
So, you get diminishing returns with upgrading those cards. IIRC, it‚Äôs +10% for rank 1 and then another +5% for each rank. 
---
If you only wanted to spend 3 points there, get each one at rank 1 only for a total of +30%. If you had just a single rank 3, that would be only 20%. 
---
But if you‚Äôre willing to devote 9 points to that stat, then go for rank 3 in all. That‚Äôs a +60% overall. 
---
It just depends on where and how you want to allocate your other stats and perks.
---
I'd say they're mid tier. Those are nice cause it's all just straight added % damage, combined with the fact that they're all high DMG per shot guns. Nice bargain setup for a rifleman build
---
I am seeing your wisdom, and indeed, the returns on upgrading appear minimal, but rather, to stack. And concentrated fire is not one I considered. I've been running Tank Killer myself. Maybe I need better Dakka (that's Warhammer talk for better weaponry). Been relying on a BOS Recon Rifle and a Furious Handmade, but I've also put a lot...maybe too much...into strength to pitch hit melee.
---
Alright awesome, so what do the difficultys change besides add a timer ? If you know :)
---
Aw that's stupid. They looked so cool stacked together
---
On the half price sale I got lots of fixers, the last two big dumps nary the one
---
The conclusion is a respect for the developers trying to fix problems that only happen some of the time.
---
I‚Äôve noticed because I played a 6 intel sniper build for 7* months , got to level 124 , I start a bloodied build and I got to level. 145 in 2 months , and I‚Äôm gaining on my dad which is a sniper build just like I was
---
I'm always wary of Marsupial because of that INT hit, but being able to get up to the high ground easier IS pretty good.
---
Speed Demon comes up in a lot of build lists, and it has good application if you're running with slow to reload weapons like the Dragon or a shotty. Healing Factor is either a yay or nay depending on who you're asking. I got Healing Factor once on accident, but I was in my teen levels so of course, it felt like god mode.
---
The Mutants Explosive is the best of the bunch.  Its a pretty decent gun.
---
The TS 10% lever is ok, I would rate it as a backup only, as you lose accuracy with the TS
---
The Black powder rifle is a great opener for a rifle build, but again, the TS loses accuracy.
---
Not a bad haul.  Much better than what I pulled from the purveyor this week.
---
You absolutely can and alot of people do just that. People could destroy your camp but you wouldn't lose anything but the mats to repair it.
---
Though I haven't met anyone that tried to destroy my camp
---
I just rerolled to a tank build so I'd be able to tank the pylons (if it works right)! I'll send you a DM with my ingame name and maybe we can try and do it soon?
---
Plus as your rads go up or health goes down you won't lose your DR buff like you do with vanguards.
---
And it's really nice, well done!
---
Have they actually confirmed in any way we‚Äôre getting a Christmas event? If so can someone link me the blog or whatever they said it in, thanks if you do! I‚Äôve had my hopes up we‚Äôd get a Christmas event but I got bombarded by people telling me I‚Äôm entitled for wanting a Christmas event a month after we just got a Halloween event?üòÇ
---
Oh dont be such a Wuzz XD Krampus is not that scary.
---
Jeez, that is nearly impossible to see anything 20 feet away, i wish they kept the Mire like that :(
---
Exactly. Fixing these things takes time and effort and if it costs what they consider too much, it ain't getting addressed.
---
Nah, not a supermoohtie. Since Krampus and Sheepsquash are both goat-themed it would make much more sense
---
You on PC? Might have been me, I sell all guns for 1250
---
If you turn off the radio the mire has a ton of eerie ambient sounds. Especially at night.
---
(Old voice) Back in my day we sold Legendaries at the vendors and didn't quite grasp what they were.
---
Lol yeah me too. Or leave them in suitcases at Whitesprings station
---
This is badass. I hope to catch you on so I can visit. I don't have any of the "other" nuka variants. I just have standard, nuka cola, nuka cherry, nuka quantum, and nukashine
---
I just verified this works, but only on the Urban variant.  My Forest pieces only have one "No Paint" option.
---
It works on the mask too.  Thanks for letting everyone know!
---
Aye. Sorry I got it like a "BGS = dumb" post.
---
At least no tesla.  Just want a good aim battle.
---
I received legendary ones and they are commonly for sale at camps.
---
Ummm if we are requesting black, I'd like to request more pink armor!!!
---
problem is if you can't place your base on the world, those items go into your stash, and with your suggestion that could cause people to go over 800 stash weight if they load into a server where there camp location is already taken
---
You‚Äôre actually spot on, it‚Äôs a thing in Virginia.  It‚Äôs called Krampusnacht.  You got an awesome idea.
---
I'd fucking love to see that, Bethesda please do this, keep adding cryptids to this
---
Anywhere you can find scorched or supermutants. Get the scraper perk and scrap the weapons they drop. You'll get lots of steel, gunpowder, bullets, and mod plans. I recommend Summerville and New Gad.
---
Good points, I've still a ton of stuff to accomplish so it might be worth another month sub.
---
No clue. I don't run the raid.
---
Seriously üòÇ? Tell me you're on ps4 lol
---
Check Top of the World. Between it, and the raider village behind it, to the cabins at the end of the road, you can get up to 2-3 Camp plans, 3 weapon plans, and 6 armor plans per run. Used to be part of my daily runs when I was still trading heavily. 
---
The Harpers Ferry display cases, and church for 3-5 more
---
I bought a faster fire furious Tesla for 1000.
---
Always has been, probably always will be.
---
There's a limit to the number of people in a public server right? Open up vault 76 and let people go back inside after completing a major mission to have public housing enabled.
---
30k? I hear those silly numbers but honestly doubt anyone ever paid that much for anything.
---
A bad build can be salvaged it just might take a giant number of levels depending on how bad you've screwed it up.  
---
If you want build advice post your build  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
I think it SHOULD be a heavy gun.  It should be like a fat man.  That only makes sense.
---
Priming it is the only option
---
My favourites are the guys on here ‚Äútrading‚Äù not even selling their garbage and looking for vanguard sentinel or bolstering sentinel lol.
---
For rifleman? Personally, I would run at least 12 perception. 3 for each rifleman perk and 3 for tank killer. Make sure you grab adrenaline rank 5 from agility and bloody mess rank 3 from luck. After that, it's all a matter of preference. My first character on Xbox took me until level 120 to fix. Now that I know what I'm doing, I can usually get to where I want by level 70 on a new character.
---
still haven't done this yet due to the scheduled maintenance. anyone looking to get in on a raid let me know! got a couple guys interested now
---
I know what you mean xD I've seen useless 1star legendaries, useless plans, useless armour mods, useless junk and pretty much everything useless or common selling for other 20 all at white springs xD
---
What I find it more funny when I see people selling some what rare stuff for more than 30k. I saw the level 30 Fixer you get free for 90k today :D
---
I have had no trouble with people destroying my camp, the community is pretty chill on PS4 at least. I met a couple idiots wandering about, but on pacifist you and your camp is just an ammo sink and you can server hop away. 
---
I play as a dedicated merchant, still building up my character but I plan on turning my camp into a dedicated hardware shop once I hit level 50. Part of my roleplay is I like to help other people with their build projects so I will be supplying a variety of bulk junk of all types and try to keep at least 5 units available at all times (once I build up my inventory). 
---
If you keep your prices cheap you can rapidly make caps whenever you get a buyer. You may lose some opportunity profit, for instance you could set your fusion cores at 40 caps and make more per unit... I set mine at 20 caps and people who need them buy ten or so instantly. You will see a lot of shops out there with high prices, it probably works for them, but I love playing the volume game and I think the game needs more of it. And despite selling cheap I am never hurting for caps (in fact I have been buying stuff from others for thousands at a time).
---
But raiding is not a problem in this game, they cannot do anything to you, and if you find the rare griefer they will not do any real damage and you will be able to pay for the repairs after your next customer easily. Most of my trouble is from monsters and they are usually fended off by my level 1 turrets.
---
I run full scout vanguards with various other perks.  I love it, rarely die
---
Yes you can, actually a lot of people have camps like that :) You're camp can be whatever you want.
---
I once overheard one of those guys on area chat mentioning that the insane prices were so that they wouldn't have to replenish inventory and with the insane traffic they get there with so many items for sale they get a lot of people who accidentally buy stuff or "maybe are just stupid".
---
The guy's camp looked like a pachinko parlor. It was easily the most outlandish build I've ever seen.
---
Not at all. I just wish the problems that need fixing were more consistent for all our sake. I'm sure it's as frustrating for them as it is for us.
---
You can get windmill generator from any power plant, Poseidon is the easiest.
---
I run weightless sentinal on my commando secondary with the Chameleon mutation. Works fine for me with a vamps handmade.
---
On XB1
---
Im picturing a sheepsquatch in a bad santa costume.
---
Nukacrypt.com
---
Lol people actual care about this game still
---
Lore? All I see in the lore is a chaotic and violent wasteland where more often than not survivors  prey on each other in a horrific crucible of survival.  Every other game had hostile humans by the thousands at each and every turn.
---
Players taking on the NPC role of "settler" and "raider" is the most lore friendly thing you can possibly do.  It will make ever more sense once Wastelanders drops and you can actually join raider and settler factions.
---
https://nukacrypt.com
---
I got my bpa+1str meathook for 340 caps the market dudes can suck me they want 70k caps for nearly everything
---
Damn someone's watching us
---
Anywhere you can find a lot of scorched/molemen/super mutants + scrapper perk.  Grab every gun and any metal shit you run past.  I usually run through harpers ferry a few times, and I'm good for a while.
---
If you just got the game a few days ago, might be a little harder to sell things that people are buying though, as those take some time to acquire. It is a very doable thing to do once you've got a larger selection of guns (legendaries) to sell though. Start with items that transcend level: ammo, stims, meds, plans, junk, etc while saving up legendaries to sell. It's a fun idea, I agree, but current state of the game I don't think you'll have a lot of luck selling low to mid-level non-legendaries. 
---
No one (Player Characters) will raid your CAMP unless you agree to PVP by fighting them. If you don't want to PVP, go to settings and turn pacifist on. NPC's can attack your CAMP but in most situations, a few well placed turrets will guard it.
---
The prime armor looks really good with some x-01 parts replaced, but I think it looks better with the helmet than with the chest
---
I just want them to fix the bugs and allow more CAMP space. The server mechanics can stay. They don‚Äôt hurt the game. Modding is cool if you want mods but this is a multiplayer game, not singleplayer. No reason to break the balance of the game just to satisfy the urges of a small minority.
---
Someone is fishing for a flame war.
---
Well i wouldnt complain as i long as i get to shoot them in the leg and cannibalize them
---
Honestly how I feel at this point, too.
---
All of the Biv recipes sell pretty well because a lot of people don‚Äôt do the daily quests. Nuka cola dark is the most valuable because of its name.
---
I usually sell them at 500 caps but someone else in this thread just sold it for 4K lol.
---
Yes very much casuls took everything from me already
---
I agree with you. Caps sadly have little value at least towards legendary items. Prices on all other goods are sort of regulated based on ease of getting said items (supply). What caps could end up being is sort of a gamer score. People will want to trade more via caps of they know they can be a wasteland millionaire. The game can also impose taxes on all transactions to keep inflation down and one could pay a fee for storing caps in increments (if you have a million caps you pay a monthly fee in caps to store). So many possibilities but allowing dwellers to store more caps would create a higher demand for them.
---
What is there to complain about?
---
Nah you probably go to eat them then die from scrubbing your toe on invisible rocks
---
Grafton Steel.  Its full of level 10ish super mutants, they drop weapons, and ammo. 
---
Scrapper + weapons = steel by the truckload.
---
And if your feeling saucy, there are a few steel extractors at Grafton Steel as well, but you must have some balls as it requires taking the workshop, and opening  yourself to PVP.
---
I think the vending machines are fine as they are, infinite stash will just lead to more hoarding, when what we need is commerce. Cap limit should go away though.
---
Something that happens in the real world, if you stuff is not selling at a high price, you lower your price. Than it will not be sitting around in your stash. I mostly deal in basic supplies, but if I was dealing in rarer weapons I would start it out at a high price, and just drop it every day until it sells (rate of drop increasing based off my stash size). Also if I am in my shop when people are there I always am negotiable on prices.
---
What the game also needs is a request price mechanism in the trade interface (or a true barter screen where you pick a bundle of things and a cap balance on both sides and both agree to complete the sale).
---
I put mine in didplays, lol
---
Cool but the most common image of Krampus is sheepswatches cousin just black and maybe give him a whip and bag.
---
Probably but Bethesda will probably make them oneshotable by foodbuilds so they'll feel powerful.
---
What if they destroy my super elabrate camp and kill me while I walk away from my game
---
11/10 on those terms.
---
I find it annoying and realistic. I am always sick.
---
You can set your camp up in any fashion you would like.
---
There isnt any *raid* mechanic like fallout 4 but there is potential for your camp to be destroyed by other players if youve instigated pvp with them.  If you decide to take a workshop, i would advise turning your vending machines off so your camp doesnt show on the map.
---
Otherwise it just random enemy damage and its easy enough to fix a wall here and there.
---
20 hours, I try to drop into a vendor first thing and sell at least one thing to them so the timer restarts. On a rare day I will get a couple resets in, but usually plan on seeing it reset about once a day.
---
All I want is Supermutants dressed up as elves.
---
Does it compound the effect of the scrapper perk? I've had a few people suggest I was lying about how much steel I was getting from that because they were getting half as much.
---
Whatever one suits your needs.
---
Yeah especially when you trying to just buy scrip weapons or armor ppl trying to sell worthless 3 stars for 5k plus.
---
All round,water or recourses if possible
---
What is your best source for regular Nuka cola?
---
There‚Äôs no ‚Äúbest‚Äù, what you like others may not like. What you need others may not, it all just depends on what you want to do
---
[deleted]
---
Omg yes they well
---
‚ÄúF‚Äù in the chat please
---
Also
---
*insert ‚Äúit ain‚Äôt much but it‚Äôs honest work‚Äù meme
---
the internet lol
---
Can't say for PS4 but it cut my load times in Fallout 4 in half on an xbox one. I was using a 500gb usb SSD drive. Can't even remember what brand anymore.
---
Junk,lead,aluminum and that type of stuff
---
What resources though? Again, it depends on your needs. I've moved my own camp a dozen times, at least, because my needs changed.
---
Where‚Äôs your camp?
---
Posiedan is where I got mine
---
Where is yours right now?
---
Hell, unless it's a three star, I generally won't sell above 200c. But if it's a three star with nocturnal or bash damage...I still sell low for those script hunters. Ha. I probably have sold some decent weapons for way less than I should...but whatev, glad to share the love.
---
They  just decreased the decay rate by 50% (maybe more) a couple months ago. I suggest you get insulated backpack mod
---
Ok yea, it'd be easy to see him too if his Brahmin had a light red nose.

I just want a Krampus Sheepquash tho too lol
---
Vanguard is really good, though you may which to mix it up a little, you might want the low health version (forgot the name) too as some people would prefer to have a more consistent DR. So for you that might be a good idea though personally i'd go full Vanguard and one piece chameleon.
---
Theres a location near fort defiance with lead/no water, site alpha has a nice view with water/no resources. Just google it and theres quite a few youtube videos with locations that have water/resources both
---
All recourses really but would be cool if it had water
---
step 1: make idiotic overly expensive outfits
---
step 2: wonder why the atom shop doesn't make any money
---
step 3: make fallout 1st to actually bring in money
---
step 4: make more idiotic overly expensive outfits
---
GJ Bethesda. I can only guess they are going full bore to capture the fortnite dress-like-a-dumbass crowd. How many actual post-apocalyptic themed outfits have we gotten that weren't ripped from another game?
---
Mine is near Pleasant Valley on an acid deposit.
---
&gt;As for items being tied to your stash, I don't see another way around it.
---
The values for weight are arbitrary in relation to server performance and stability. That's to say a 10 pound cookie and a 1 pound cookie would be just as taxing on a server. Make items in vending machines have no weight or do one of a thousand other fixes to solve this issue.   
---
There are few quality arguments against fixing these sorts of issues. It boils down to the fact that QoL fixes can't be sold in the atom store, therefor they aren't the priority.
---
Experience points are much less important than having an enjoyable experience. It‚Äôs not like leveling is important anyways, after 50.
---
Yeah I remember thinking egghead was a stupid mutation, hell I'll take it at level 30 now and slap on a starched genes
---
I get a ton of that from nuking morgantown. Usually almost an even 1/3 split with the other two things when I nuke there.
---
Thanks!!
---
No problem! Glad to help out when I can, I also move my camp a lot looking for a good spot
---
We can only have 30k caps. That it all.
---
*Sierra Petrovita would like to know your location*
---
Yea as a man of science you should know science isnt an off the cuff shoot from the hip gig. Come prepared with the right tools for the job *good with salt* or the refrigerated backpack mod
---
Mine is in the mire because I like the dark and moody atmosphere
---
I don't think it is supposed to be, but is for game play reasons so you don't drown everytime you fall in a puddle
---
It‚Äôs 72.5% reduction, but you do actually add the percentages together. It‚Äôs just that the AA prefix makes Stabilized and Tank Killer only get to apply half their percentage. So, it‚Äôs 50% + 22.5%. 
---
Depending on the target‚Äôs DR, if it‚Äôs high enough this has a significant impact. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre running a Bloodied build (in which case you should be using a Bloodied weapon instead), it‚Äôs the best combat-related Intelligence perk in my opinion.
---
https://fo76map.com
---
This should help you out.
---
Thanks so much!
---
bpa?
---
You're very welcome. :)
---
Vanguards ap refresh heavy combat sentinel or cav would be the best for full health.
---
Because they removed survival, so I needed a stable raid server. Plus they went cap in hand talking about how hard it is to get things working and, like a mark, I gave them the benefit of the doubt
---
If you have an AA prefix then you only get to add half the listed percentage of Stabilized or Tank Killer. So it‚Äôs 72.5% max for AA + Stabilized and 68% max for AA + Tank Killer.
---
;)
---
Bloodied Power Attack?
---
Is it a thing that Bethesda did? Then yes, there will be at least a dozen posts about how it‚Äôs the worst thing they‚Äôve ever done in the history of ever. 
---
Because crying about Bethesda doing anything is the norm.
---
Ignoring your condensation's you misunderstood a few of my points; however I get the basics of what you are saying. 
---
&gt;increasing the amount of legendaries you get on private would be farther into pay to win territory than beth could manage from a pr stance.
---
The increased legendaries comment was because several of us experience the routine decrease to no legendaries spawning on our private servers. We can fix this bug by logging out for 5 minutes and logging back in, but this is a problem that shouldn't exist on something we paid upfront money for and then now a monthly sub for.
---
&gt;I am ok with scrap box being sub only, I have played since beta and enjoyed the hell out of it long before scrap box was introduced. they sold me thousands of hours of entertainment for a decent price. demanding a scrap box as well seems like and entitle free to play mindset. its their product they can put a price on it. just dont buy it if you dont agree with it.
---
more entitlement feet stampy free to play mindset on display. 
---
That's great you are one of the few people who have enjoyed this game "as is" and feel you got your money's worth from it. I do not. The majority shares my opinion, however that doesn't invalidate yours. Just as your opinion does not invalidate mine. 
---
I paid $160 (2 games) for Fallout 76, played it with my son for a month and quit due to the bugs/other problems. The whole concept of this game is collecting scrap to support yourself exploring and getting weapons. Collecting Scrap is the core of the game. Having unlimited scrap storage behind a monthly paywall is wrong in a game you already have to buy. Worse it is super scummy from a PR standpoint. I didn't say I did not like it. I said I did not like that Bethesda took the scummy route of locking this behind a recurring paywall.
---
&gt;farm 20 cores per hour without worrying about hogging all the plants from friendly players or getting ganked by troglodytes.
---
it allows me to safely transfer items between characters. I don't have to bug my friend to hold shit now. that's a win for me and my friends. 
---
Good point on the farming and transferring of items. 
---
&gt;I want beth to succeed because I like playing 76. before the sub I was trying to spend 20 a month to support them but often saw nothing in the atom shop I cared about, with the sub I feel like I am paying them a fair price for a desired service. IF beth fails for whatever reasons that may be it wont be because I was a freeloader expecting a bunch of free crap and never spending any money.
---
the monthly atoms coming in has actually encouraged me to buy some silly things I wouldnt have considered buying before.
---
Accusing people who bought the game as being "freeloaders" because they feel like Bethesda didn't know give them value for the money spent doesn't help the discussion at all and makes you come off as a Bethesda employee pretending to be "just a random gamer" with a opinion. Regardless if you are a employee or not, keep the hostility to yourself please, I was looking for good faith dialog about a series I had a deep love for until Bethesda released Fallout 76.
---
1% isn‚Äôt that rare for what you‚Äôre talking about. They‚Äôd need event outfit status atleast, which is around .05% chance
---
They could almost make it like the scorch beast queen boss fight
---
Multiplicatively, so -50%, then -45% of the remaining 50%. So 72.5% armour penetration
---
Krampus! Yes!
---
Sweet, I'll send an invite tonight if I remember. Mine is also the same as here.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, coming soon, THE FLUX REFRIGERATOR- for only three payments of 49.99, you too. An actually use a basic gameplay item!
---
Joy.
---
Do a search here. There was a post showing the relative effectiveness of Vanguard and Bolstering. I believe that 2 Vanguard and 3 Bolstering or vice versa provided the best full spectrum protection since the Vanguard effect drops rapidly with damage.
---
Just a heads up, there will always be a group of people thet complain about any topic
---
It'll just be a mole miner reskin.
---
Ha
---
All this.
---
Picking raw flux without Good With Salt [Luck] and Green Thumb [Perception] is asking for disaster/wasted time.
---
why would you think that's an npc...it's clearly a player crouching
---
I've had four random CTDs this morning on PC. I can't even finish Final Departure as I have to keep re-clearing the area.
---
Then I will follow in my for father's footstep and wage glorious war on them
---
Heh. I once had a bug where my missile turrets would disappear, so I'd put more down. And those new turrets would vanish, too. Plop more down.
---
Then one day I log in and all the turrets are back, and I ended up with around 20+ at least. They randomly just popped back into existence.
---
Get a 90% reduced weight Missle Launcher, and have some fun with them instead of dropping them.
---
Yes. I get more mats back from scrapper when I have the 15 extra intelligence from unyielding armor then when I have lower intelligence
---
I second this, I haven't heard anything
---
üò≥that would be awesome!
---
I run a junkies commando that uses chameleon mutation and weightless armour. He's a little squishier than my vanguard's guy, that guy uses AA weapons and vats and that's pretty fun too
---
When I was low level missiles really helped me survive.
---
My alt just got a sloth, named him Flash. He kinda kills the local passive fauna though..He roams outside of my camp boundaries a lot more than my deathclaw on my main, he's kind of an experiment, see how long he lasts. Everytime he does his shaky shake thing though, my screen blurs, even when he's no where near me. It's kinda odd.
---
I am the rad worms lol
---
&gt;The values for weight are arbitrary in relation to server performance and stability. 
---
I never mentioned server stability. I agree, and also think there's truth to the fact they won't do it until they can sell it (we saw firsthand with the advent of the scrapbox).
---
I mean it wouldn't work because people would exploit a system like that for extra storage. Maybe it's just me, but I would be very salty if I looked on the map, saw a vendor with tons of weapons, armor ammo etc, only to fast travel and find 70% of it's items for 25k caps a piece, just so the owner could free up stash space. 
---
I'd rather them give the scrapbox to everyone else so they can enjoy the extra stashpace freed from the shackles of junk, but we both know that's not likely either.
---
Beware ‚Äî this is a long answer! This is a chunk of my personal route. 
---
Start at the NAR Repair Yard, which has a decent chance of spawning a legendary enemy. In the Quonset hut on the table is a plan spawn point, plus two explosives crates which have given me plans. 
---
Then head down the train tracks towards the station. About halfway you‚Äôll encounter a open boxcar. A plan can spawn on top of the wooden crates. 
---
Next, jump or hoof it to the Flooded Trainyard, which also will also spawn legendaries (beware of mirelurk kings and yao guai here). The FT point will have you facing some buildings. The one on the left has a plan spawn on a workbench table, along with a level 3 safe in the back which (if I remember right) have a 30% chance of containing a plan. If you go back out the door and jump the fence, there‚Äôs a fusion generator to check for a core. There‚Äôs another workshop between there and the rows of train cars with a level 2 safe. Slip out the side door of that building and you‚Äôll see a tractor trailer which has a level 3 safe tucked into the end. Then hit the three open train cars opposite the back end of the trailer ‚Äî one has magazine and recipe spawn points, one has a mod spawn point, and the other has a plan spawn point. 
---
Lastly, hit the station whatever they‚Äôre called ‚Äî tower? Tall wood building down the tracks for a final level 3 safe.
---
Drop site V9 has the chance of a plan on the bottom shelf of a small cart, as well as a level 3 safe. Drop site C2 has a plan spawn on the shelf on the left side of the interior.  Pylon V-13 has a plan spawn on a shelf next to the workbench at the bottom. It‚Äôs worth the climb for bobbleheads, recipes, a bunch of Mentats, and a couple of first aid boxes. You could do a circuit of the BoS camps down there too, but more often than not you‚Äôll draw in some scorchbeasties. 
---
There‚Äôs a bunch of level 3 safes to be found all over the map, which I‚Äôve started hitting myself with good success. WickedyChickady has a YouTube video that I recommend watching with the details. Either herself or another player (sorry, can‚Äôt remember) made up a public spreadsheet with what can be found in the safes in each region of the map if you‚Äôre looking for anything particular. 
---
So, yeah. Good luck!
---
Since it's one of the prizes from Biv, I would strike it off the "Rare" list, since you'll get it from a singular source. Never made it myself. Does it work with the "pour booze over person to revive" perk card?
---
Also my main is unarmed, but he uses 5 pieces each with a different -15% damage from a creature, with a few cavaliers and sentinels and he is pretty tanky
---
I just hope they buff it so at least Missile Launcher and Fat Man can one shot stuff.
---
resilient. My deathclaw used to do his attacks and no matter where he was in my CAMP I would get shaken and seem to take a tiny bit of damage lol
---
This was on a private world with 3 other people. Wasn‚Äôt on the map and no player name or yellow indicator. Also no option to invite for trade/team.
---
Support is a side gig at best...
---
I love support and healing and play healer in every mmo I've been a part of. There just isnt much room or love in this game for buffing/debuffing and healing. Even control is only good for solo
---
Healings ruined when 3 out of 4 people run a 10-20% bloodied build and those that dont already have defense and survivability built into their character
---
Radsponge could of been useful except those 3 out of 4 people running bloodied will kick and block you the second they notice it's on
---
Grab a shotgun w/enforcer and kneecap the fuck out of everyth-....oh well the bloodied/junkies/AA guys already downed the whole group so no need for that either....
---
Support is being a card slut...that's all you're really good for
---
Right.  I mean i pay a monthly fee at my bank..id. Pay a fat fee to appalachia to just be able to keep all my caps in one spot. I mean ultimately i think everyone kinda has that thought about being the millionaire. I dont mind the limit of 30k if i know i can just run to the atm and take out what i need. How many times have you been down to like 15 and see somethin in a vendor thats like 17..now you gotta do the boogie woogie to fetch a few caps off a mule. Really annoying sometimes.
---
1* Bloodied Meathook is easily worth 3k imo
---
Those aren't bos. Those are chinese.
---
I put mine on top of Seneca Rock Ridge, it's a less favoured spot because of FT problems, but there is dirt so I can still produce enough water, plant and no aggressive enemy ever spawn if the camp is set up correctly.
---
well I dont have private servers, but im pretty sure that on public servers, players crouching are hidden on the map, and so are their name and no interaction is possible.
---
Yes very good spot for a 25
---
And why
---
My biggest vendor pet peeve is folks who set up shop in the Mire or the Cranberry Bog with vendors full of non-legendary weapons and armors. How dare you? I traveled down there on the off chance you had a piece of armor for one of my random sets I'm putting together or a new weapon to tinker with, and all you have is a selection of leather leg pieces and fuckin pipe weapons?? I'll fight you. I won't, because I'm a pacifist, but I'll probably leave a bag of fertilizer and an insult note on your bed
---
Plus..theres tons of "business people" out there. I myself spent the first idk 6 months just setting up shop and buyin and selling old school hand to hand. But after a while you have to stop cuz its just to big a pain to keep movin caps. Give me a damn business acount. Ill pay 10%. If there was a 10% cap sink once a month. It would bring cap value back too.
---
They‚Äôre on Xbox posts all the time. These super damaging bloodied weapons or the unyielding/whatever it‚Äôs called that increases all stats or STR are mega valuable
---
WHAT?! I have been playing off and on since the Beta and never knew about this!
---
Thanks. Tonight I know what I'm doing!
---
Is it confirmed that the wastelanders raiders will be using nuke mines on us while we shop at robo vendors, craft at benches or use our stash box?
---
No BOS, the return of the bos would only cheapen  their sacrifice during Touchdown. The defeat of the Brptherhood os supposed to be the point where we realise nukes are the only way to stop the scorched.
---
Instead give the spotlight to Free States or a new faction, keep things fresh since we got 200 years until the bos come back East.
---
Took me a few to see it but it's right after you come out of Pip with 18 seconds remaining, right? Seems to be a man in a blue suit crouching?  Did you not notice it until rewatching the clip? Killed me you went right back into Pip so you only get a 1/2 second view.
---
It's great for lead too later on. I hate power armour, but I carry a set of excavator for Bunches of ore veins I come across and smelt it all. Takes some acid but definitely a great way to get metals
---
You can't see it, but I am making that "why didn't I think of that?" face, while my eyebrow twitches. Excuse me while I go scream into the void.
---
I don't run raids but on higher difficulties the number of enemies are unlimited, they'd keep spawning.
---
don't want any scrip from achievements!
---
If you are big into player vending then somewhere in the middle of the map. If you like water farming then near a body of water. If you lack a particular resource then camp near that resource. Some locations do all three.
---
Well, true, they can be really helpful at low levels.  But eventually you find better food.
---
So I do the whole mine thing and it takes quite abit of mines to kill someone like 10 minutes from full health unless there bloodied already
---
I just watched it. Then saw this post. Well done but I was still hoping for my white and red stripes! üòÑ You‚Äôre PS4, right?
---
Should be visible longer at the very end

---
At least with a deathclaw, when they roar, you know you have visitors, lol. Her roar just instakills eyebots and some of the other level 1 mobs, it's kinda funny. Like they were scared to death. Angel will chase enemies though, I live by a house between Camden Park and the Nuka Cola plant and she'll chase enemies all the way back to the bridge, usually a lvl 3 ghoul that wandered over or level 5 muties.
---
I wish I had that on PS
---
Get enough people in Scorched Earth and the game starts having an anxiety attack.
---
I am bloodied and had it tried once but even then it isn't immediate death as long as you're not AFK. I ran outside for them to follow and then blocked the door shut with 7 power armor frames to buy some time to finish vending. Hopefully the raiders we get are slightly more ominous than just mildly annoying jackasses.
---
Part of the Cult of atom I see
---
I‚Äôve got a place in the Mire near the Berkeley Springs train station that has a junk pile and water. Win-win.
---
Do you have a perk of something
---
Those kind of vendors don't deserve my business.
---
If a vendor cannot realize that like 75% of the endgame playerbase with large amounts of caps to spend run with radiation levels up, then they dont deserve endgame player caps.
---
That's fabulous!
---
The scorched bodies is just creepy lol
---
Well if any other games raider are annoying jackasses so good luck with that
---
Just for those daily Atoms. That‚Äôs about it, really.
---
All bloodied builds, and anyone using Nerd Rage or Radicool will have high rad levels.
---
That one power armored raider with the Fatman was kind of fun in Fallout 4. He wasn't really that far away from the starting area so I encountered him pretty low level. The rest much less so.
---
If you do that don't forget to walk up the conveyor belt that starts from the room just to the right of the "front" and grab the iron ore, too!
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radicool](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radicool)
---
Yes, they really need a buff.
---
-Fatman mini-nuke....the nuke that is shrugged off.ü§î
---
My main was an explosives build as soon as you get to late game I feel the class doesn't perform well. ( needs the 3 dmg buff cards that only effect Misslie,Fat man, grenade launchers)
---
I would over charge to the max just so stuff wouldn't use my stash weight. :D
---
They've said NW gets a Christmas event, because the Halloween event gets another few days up.
---
I haven't read about an Adventure mode event though.
---
Yeah I know about that even though nobody wants to play NW so idk why they continually put cool shit behind that god awful ‚ÄúBR‚Äù but they won‚Äôt stop anytime soon so can‚Äôt really complainüòÇ
---
Agreed.
---
FWIW, I call it vendor row and the arena, too :)
---
It's different for melee because each point of STR equals to 5% melee damage, 5lbs of carrying weight and more STR perks, which are mostly useful.
---
It depends on your weapon and armour of choice really, if you are using a full health non Junkies build, trying to diversify might be bad for your damaging capabilities because every bit of damage given by perks are crucial.
---
If you are using Bloodied or Junkies weapons, then diversifying wouldn't really hurt at all because the damage provided by these effects plus the 30% from rank 1 damage perks are already sufficient.
---
It's also super easy to irradiate yourself again or just not shop at that vendor
---
Do this Bethesda!
---
you earn plans and vault steel once per day, per difficulty.  Easy only awards steel, standard and expert reward plans.  
---
you earn 2 steel on easy, 4 on standard, and 6 on expert.  You also earn "bulk ammo scrap" items with a bunch of crafting materials to help you replenish your ammo.  
---
The primary rewards are the vault steel and the plans as the armor sets are very good, especially the strangler heart PA.  Once you get close to knowing all the plans the last 2 or 3 will take maybe 15+ completions on standard or hard to earn.  
---
There are 3 missions rotating weekly.  The main reward difference is one of them, dead in the water, has a guaranteed 3 star legendary item in the chest at the very end.  The other missions don't have a guaranteed 3 star, but all missions usually spawn at least 2+ legendary enemies.  
---
The main difference between easy and the other difficulties is the timer, though it feels like there's also more enemies in harder difficulties.  The standard timers are pretty reasonable and easy to complete once you are efficient with the various tasks to progress each section.  Hard requires a tight team of experienced players with at least 2 people who are intimately familiar with every section and task/puzzle as there is very little margin for error.  
---
My advice is run standard and hard on a private server if you can, as the lag will be minimal.  Barring that you really need to server hop until you find a stable server with little lag to complete hard.
---
I need photos of these. It's almost criminal to describe such splendor without photographic evidence.
---
I dont shop at those vendors.
---
Sometimes im in a bad mood and nuke them just because im an ass.
---
I have high hopes, that since Wastelanders was pushed back some, that we eventually see NPCs from the base factions starting to show up. I know I'm probably setting myself up for disappointment but, a man can dream.
---
I have a BE lmg with +250 DR.  Granted, I don't use it, but it should fetch a fine trade once fixed.
---
Lol I mean he‚Äôs right every post on this sub deteriorates into monetization paragraphs üòÇ
---
I think it would be nice if they reclassified rad suits as outfits.  Shouldnt be forced to choose between armor or rad resistance.
---
Yeah. Great gun right there
---
Morgantown airport.  Set off the event, kill all the scorched, loot their weapons.  Roam the hangars for lots of meds, and more steel.
---
Can kill more scorched on the way to the train station.  You can sell for caps or scrap for steel.
---
Well there is Demolition Expert. But even with that it is not enough. Explosives in this game are really weak compared with previous games.
---
Agreed. While at it, they also need to remove the Cap limit. 
---
This is the only online game I know where you can hit your money cap faster than in the Diablo games.
---
my Vampires Explosive +250 combat rifle is waiting.
---
ive got a full health commando build waiting to try it out.
---
Lol the quoted my previous post in a Kotaku "article". Where are my royalty checks? Rofl
---
This is why mine is way off to the side of my entrance.
---
Certain items do. I sold a rare plan for 17k.
---
Made me spit my coffee
---
- very funny
---
The Pioneer Scout quest.  You start as a Tadpole.  Get 3 ‚Äúmerit badges‚Äù And complete 2 tasks.  On complete, You get the standard backpack and become a Possum Scout.  
---
Complete a number of possum badges, and get mods/upgrades for the backpack.
---
True, players like this cannot possibly know the market value of equipment.
---
But that also mean they might price great stuff at a low price.
---
Still the chance of these noobs having anything good is pretty low, I'd just find those brick single widows to jump in or leave.
---
"Yes, 3 missiles!" said no one ever.
---
Yeah the game is ok, but thats about it.
---
I've played this game a whole lot, and I've loved it, but it amazes me the amount of bugs that seem to appear/reappear every couple of months, yet nothing is really done about it.
---
But they can add new stuff to the atom shop weekly, and add a f1 subscription, while all the bugs are still breaking the game.
---
Yes...yes...let the hate flow through you
---
thanks sherlock :D
---
I think I'd like to see the Grinch lol
---
Well you can cheat like everyone says here... or you can collect all 8 pieces and decrypt them using the keyword cypher. Keywords will be on those boards in the enclave bunker. It‚Äôs fun to do one time. It‚Äôs a bit tedious if you want to just launch a bunch of nukes and you have to wait until toward the end of the week to have enough of the keyword revealed.
---
Definition of griefing
---
90% of the conversation was him telling me I am pissed and whining about something and name calling. I wouldn't even call that an argument. 
---
My whole point is that people just hand wave it off as RNG but it's definitely something else going on in these rolls
---
People claim its rare but I've gotten it like 12 times. Not sure if that all my RNG luck being used there though.
---
Love krampus and the history. Not far off from ole sheep boy.
---
jffr lmg with 250dr :D
---
Missile launchers and Fat Mans should be improved. I mean jeez they are supposed to be endgame weapons
---
Beautiful weapon
---
...and if you haven't already done so, turn the game music off. The atmospheric sounds are wonderful in this game and often lost under the hammy music.
---
They‚Äôve already said they will be adding admin privileges to private servers in a future update
---
Maybe we don‚Äôt want you trampling in your radioactive dirt, blood, and guts onto our shiny new wood flooring!
---
I just run threw it and doesn't affect me most of the time
---
sad thing is i bought a second one for a lot of caps a while ago now i have two of them :D
---
sad there is no dualwielding :D
---
Happens sometimes 
---
Either switch worlds or reload
---
Truly. It will sell or trade for something good
---
It's where all the players go to sell their "scripts" /s
---
I think it goes off of some items that you keep, as well as some random effects. It's fascinating to me because I get bloodied stuff on my bloodied guy and junkies on my junkies guys. I had a dude with 4 various rad rifles and keep getting them on him. So it makes me curious what else is happening. Maybe it's just cognitive bias on my part, but it just doesn't seem wholely random
---
Definition of dont piss off a guy who can run the silo in 10 minutes with a bag full of nuke cards.
---
I like this idea but then PAs will be almost useless.
---
It's also logical that you can't fit in these suits while wearing armour.
---
I hope these could be modded for additional armour, and be put in the legendary pool.
---
I'd also like to see full armours like the dress from that superhero questline. These full armours should have unique effects and looks.
---
Because you don't know what you are talking about ....but you already know that
---
Good advise, gonna keep it and prime it, thanks!
---
I‚Äôve a single action revolver so the reload effect really works well with the gun, and it‚Äôs bloodied and explosive too
---
If you want free security BUT a lot of enemy raids. Whitespring
---
Ah ok thanks!
---
TSE are lackluster. 
---
Look into an AAE instead.
---
I have a bloodied, 10% damage while aiming, 250 DR reload crossbow. Considering that's what you spend 90% of your time doing with that weapon it should be pretty good.
---
That‚Äôs actually incorrect, I didn‚Äôt ‚Äòthink‚Äô when i visit mama murmrgh, it is what it is. But I can‚Äôt help noticing some prefixes are way too often yet some others are nowhere to be found. Like I said in another reply, murmrgh‚Äôs rng seems to be different than in-game loots, which is not so heavily biased toward certain prefixes.
---
I agree fully I left a camp without spending a dime due to that
---
Yea, i got rid of that one, i was kinda sad about the instigating tag :(
---
LOL better than my last sloth tbh. Mine just stood in one spot &amp; roared. Never moved. Never did anything. Just roared and made weird noises LMAO
---
If thats all it takes to piss you off then you would not have likes my trap/maze camp
---
I see a player crouching also, 'crabbyplayer3' I believe I saw as the GT.  Watch the vid again, anyone else pause to confirm?
---
this would be insanely op.
---
lol use that character when you visit murmur. I can‚Äôt confirm this but some youtuber says the drop can be affected by the character‚Äôs arsenal.
---
I'd just use a gun anyway as you'd not be wasting ammo if you're a melee build.
---
I'd honestly give you a few to be honest, they weigh like 1Ib and I can't help but to kill TBD cargobot every time I see one
---
Aae, aaffr, fe, f ffr,
---
Television, tabletop television, and modern television
---
Hmm I always wondered that.
---
BE 50 cal. It‚Äôs going to be god tier when they fix the bug.
---
Not quite in the same league but I used to put level 5 1star legendary equipment for next to nothing for the newbie's only for some high level players to take the lot. Do they mean that much to some people.
---
Yeah. Big defense and offense
---
I got more fixers when it first became available at murmrgh‚Äôs, then just like explosive and other highly sought after features it was a steady decline. Got zero in my latest scrip dump (yes those toons learned the plan)
---
Tse messes up the accuracy so much. I have a tse prime gatling that I pretty much just use when I can park in front of a scorched beast or something big and unload.
---
Imposter krampus outfit anyone?
---
"Definitely"
---
Prove it then, whiner. Anecdotes aren't any kind of evidence.
---
Combining melee and ranged will not be very optimized, unless you‚Äôre doing melee/heavies/shotguns. Better off choosing one or the other.
---
ah yeah nicely spotted, "crabbyplayer443"
---
I think it'd be cool for the christmas season but not really other than that
---
Swing by whitesprings and cure it for the cost of a fast travel.
---
I know, but I still call it whitesprings because I live by a tiny town called whitesprings irl
---
I'd honestly prefer to not get a reward than get missiles or 40mm rounds
---
I‚Äôve seen videos of people solo-ing the Queen with primed ones.
---
Quad assaultron head with it, and all you do with that thing is reload. I will be invincible!
---
Nice combo
---
I try to avoid fast-travelling to that area, first time I FT'ed to the Free States bunker and a level 45 is taking on 2 Legendary Scorchbeasts while being sniped by a Legendary Supermutant, I helped out as best I could but my build is flakey and I don't have a decent "monster-Slayer" weapon. Eventually we got them all, the SuperMutie glitched thru the swamp, but got a couple decent pieces off the SBs. Walking south afterwards I was stalked by a Wendigo but it got distracted by a battle between a Megasloth and a couple Shaggy Yao Guis. luckily I jumped on top of a semi and was able to get a snipe shot on all of them before focusing on the eventual winner (Wendigo!) ;-)
---
I want a bloodied one so badly. I don‚Äôt even care about the other stars.
---
I have a side door for you people xD Also a switch nest to it in case me or someone else left it on.
---
This is confirmed to be in next patch?
---
By Bethesda
---
The best non bloodied build dmg wise is Junkies&gt;AA&gt;TS and vamp is great for survivalibiltiy
---
And yes your weapons can get a whole lot better, and as others have stated you do not want to mix weapon types. Take your rifle and only spec to that for the best dmg
---
thats for sure at least üòÅ
---
This guys gets it.
---
id keep them if i could break them down... some gun powder some fuel and steel would be great
---
I just carry some spoiled milk to rebalance rads
---
This guy gets it.
---
Awe I got downvoted by foodbuilds lol
---
Stealth/crit/commando works great for me. Get a nice ffr or vats crit DMG handmade and your're golden.
---
Junkie's commando is pretty big now too, but that means the pricetag on gear is pretty big as well
---
The astronomical unlikelihood of getting two ghoul slayers gamma guns in a row is proof, then you have this guy that got 4 assaultron heads? Wake up bro, noone is whining. Talk to someone irl the way you talk to people on Reddit and let us know what happens lol
---
No no no, go back and reread the article, they‚Äôre fixing the ‚Äú250 DR while aiming‚Äù legendary effects, not ‚Äú250 DR while reloading‚Äù
---
Has to be a typo
---
I wouldn‚Äôt have took the whole lot.. but before I had some good level 5 weapons for levelling my alts.. I would‚Äôve definitely took some if I came across.. now I have plenty good level 5-10s so I wouldn‚Äôt need to! but I agree unfortunately you can‚Äôt do the whole cheap stuff for new players.. other players will just take it all :(
---
Would be great
---
Prime your Zealots and youll be good to go
---
This would be so useful when hiding in NW
---
As far as I can tell the owner of the camp will in many cases spawn in a different place than random people will.  Have a friend travel to your camp a couple of times and then you'll have the spot to build around.
---
Toxic goo works well too
---
I remember trying to use a legendary fat man for a challenge. It ended up being more efficient to beat enemies with the weapon than actually firing it.
---
There‚Äôs sad, then there‚Äôs Nerf nukes.
---
not sure
---
No, it's not proof of anything. You seem to have a lot of trouble with the meaning of a lot of simple words, do you have a carer to help you through this? I talk to everyone like this, and raging neckbeards like yourself meekly slink away to cry to Mommy again. Tell me more about how videogame mechanics make you piss your pants in a tantrum.
---
On my life Bethesda needs to do this. I love the Lore of Krampus
---
That should do it too! Have fun with the new hardware
---
The bugs are really annoying, but the art is very impressive and keeps me playing. To me the thing that‚Äôs most immersion-breaking isn‚Äôt the bugs but some of the low-poly geometries (weapons, enemies, etc). The game was definitely constructed by modelers of different skill levels.
---
It's called Nuclear Winter.
---
Yes. We have all been diseased about 97% of our playtime. Ty sulfur fountain for curing me
---
Yeah, it can get pretty crazy lol I have one camp on top of some rad toads spawn, but they don't typically attack my camp. I've only had SBs a handful of times, usually it's ghouls, supermutants, scorched etc. I did get a SB and mirelurks queens once, that was crazy
---
Dont worry I upvoted you
---
Please make this not atom shop related. Pets should be found.
---
I repeat. Pets should be found.
---
both good examples of a one star worth 1k.
---
There are several places with whitespring in the name, so the plural of this is whitesprings to refer to them collectively.
---
These would be nice fixes and make vendoring a lot easier. The main problem however is that the valuable stuff is worthy more than caps and is meant for specific trades. For more variety of stuff to be on player vendors all items need to be equalized a bit in terms of value, and caps need to have more value (lower cap gain, increased cap sinks, etc) so that ~5000 caps is considered a fortune.
---
I mean just because you think something is shity doesn't mean everyone else feels the same way. I think fortnite and pubg are shit but plenty of people play them.
---
I agree. I want some spotlight on some of the new factions they brought up instead of BoS and the enclave
---
These people in this thread telling you tse is bad are high.  It's a perfectly fine combination of effects especially on a handmade or fixer for a commando.  
---
That said the other effects mentioned in this thread are also solid.  Personally I'd probably tell you that it would be better to add in stealth for pve over 1 handed but hey, you do you.
---
I mean apparently a package item related to Senator Blackwell was found so we know the Free States have some sort of prevalence in Wastelanders
---
lol just try one starred ranged weapons, you also get to play a lot more than 2 and 3 üòÇ
---
i spawn at a different location than my friends almost 90% of the time.  its a very good method especially for vendor placement
---
It's ok, if I were to sell that I'd ask maybe 1k for it though.  You could probably get more for it but rifles are heavy as fuck and thus I try to under price them to move them fast.
---
This is in regards to a quest about finding 79, seems someone had found it and send bits of evidence to different people who'd actually look into it. But I have big feeling Free States will return.
---
My camp is just south of the crashed space station, there is no water BUT I have both a lead extractor and a junk extractor in my camp area. It's great
---
Yup.
---
https://youtu.be/dFQNd_ICRis
---
5000 INT^
---
BE handmade with it.  It's really helpful if ghouls start to swarm you.
---
Yeah very much so
---
a nice vampire efferct melee or auto would be one id pay 1k for on a mid level character. most of the time 1 star is script though.
---
I'm not pissed though, I'm really just curious how they have it set up. I do need to trim my beard again though, so I appreciate the warning on how my facial hair might be affecting how I use my brain. I'm sure you really talk to everyone like this, how old are you ü§£
---
Hey I feel your pain, this happened to me before also! It has been a long while, but I think you want to find the turbines sign and go there. Turbines are the generators, but the game does not tell you.
---
&gt;insulated backpack mod
---
refrigerated* insulated is rad resist iirc? but i whole heartedly agree. that backpack mod is great for flux farming
---
So first you have "proof", now you're curious. Your story changes every comment you make. How often do you crawl out of your basement?
---
Sorry to comment again, but after looking at a few things... I think the Chinese/communists are going to play a role in wastelanders.
---
Yes, it's been said hundreds of times before.
---
Simple, we put a santa hat on the sheepsquatch.
---
You didnt waste a key card. You wont have to put one in next time you run charlie.
---
Primed quad crossbow here!
---
It‚Äôs not the best weapon but she‚Äôs never let me down
---
If you temp build a second route to that level, you should be able to remove the stais after the temp route has been established
---
I have one with FFR. It's amazing
---
I knew that it wasn‚Äôt the best thing to do, but for melee I have perk cards in strength and for ranged I have perks cards in perception so is there a concern about the hybrid besides taking away perks points(by putting them into strength or perception) from other perks that contribute to specialization?
---
I've found so many plans that I've needed and legendaries in train stations suitcases. I even found one that had the jetpack for the ultra cite PA and a ton of full plasma cores. I'm always low on something that makes it hard to create the plasma cores.
---
Yeah, everything is subjective, but there must be some way to judge how good something is. Maybe, I dunno, some kind of aggregate review site where people can come together and share their opinions, as critics. Why, such a site would create kind of a collaborative meta-criticism. A metacritic, if you will.
---
I mean, I wonder what people on such a site would think of a "quality" game like FO76, since it's so beloved? I'm sure even if it has detractors, there's no way a Bethesda property would score as low as say, 2.7/10 for users, and barely break over 50% for professional reviewers. 
---
I mean, that would mean that the majority of people think it's a pile of crap. But that can't be so, people on this subreddit like it. 
---
If it were true, it's probably just a rounding error, or people mistaking "0" for "10" when they put in their review score.
---
https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/fallout-76
---
I meant that those similar pulls demonstrate that something else, like a character seed etc is going on. I don't know the answer but pulling 25 legendary ranged weapons and getting only two without bash or limb damage secondary effects is just weird, so I'm curious. I think maybe you're the one that is pissed, go get a hug or some chicken noodle soup or something and be nice to your mother gosh...
---
Meanwhile that two shot, quad, explosive double barrel you found...
---
as long as i dont have to walk through a rad shower, i would be fine with it.  I like maze camps, even more when you have a captive deathclaw in it somewhere.
---
Hahaha I agreed
---
Lol ok except you did. You literally said so. That is confirmation bias. It doesnt matter if it seems different to you, it's a proven fact it isnt any different getting stuff from her vs. regular drops. 
---
I'll recommend again you go look up the AMA on here. Happened maybe 2 months ago. They put a lot of silly rumors like this to rest.
---
I‚Äôve been looking at stealth; I just enjoy feeling like I can do things open ended without being confined to one play style. I‚Äôd think doing stealth all the time must get boring, but I wouldn‚Äôt know.
---
Really? That‚Äôs very interesting. I saw a model for Chinese Prototype Power Armor weeks ago. That could be introduced with the communists.
---
Yes but note that ppl have run the numbers and a scorched killer receiver tends to be worse off than a hardened receiver.
---
Instigating combat shotgun with piercing magazine. You can one shot just about anything. No need for low health of junkies. With four leaf clovers and each pellet counting as a shot you are a vats crit machine but its overkill because you already one shot super mutants with a regular vats headshot. I can clear out west tek outside it one magazine in under ten seconds.
---
As I found out now I just keep them in case I meet someone.
---
So don't claim proof you don't have, it's that simple. You're the type of idiot to lose all your money in a poker machine and then cry because the odds were against you. Shut up FFS, Napoleon Dynamite.
---
Fooooood buiiilllld!!!!
---
Thank you so much dude, I truly appreciate it
---
Also posted on Imgur
---
I‚Äôd love a lock feature considering I cash scrip in like I‚Äôm balancing a checkbook... I shit at least half of a brick every time I see a legendary effect of something I scripped that matches an item that I definitely want to keep.
---
Depends on which quest. 
---
 For the mysteries quest, as long as you have the original item, you can remake it at a higher level.
---
Same with the Excavator quest.
---
The one that starts at Wavy Willards, no, you cannot.
---
Around the hills above the amusement perk, somewere around were leader od the pack usualy procs.
---
Got like 3 cheap as shit, dont mind cuz was for my sneaky sneak rifleman, k8nda a little sad as the 250dmg resist never went away if was wneaking when reloading
---
Thank you so much :)
---
You as well thank you :)
---
One of the best gaming communities. Hope your day/rest of the week improves.
---
You may need to see some of his videos before the launch of Fo76 most of it is just positive yet sceptical because Bethesda has never really made an online game before... Plus he does highlight the positive stuff about Fo76 its just the negatives out way the positives from a technical perspective it's just the gaming industry is becoming toxic with half-baked live service programs that provide a semi-enjoyable experience I don't hate your love for the fallout franchise or the Fo76 because I too am a fan of Fallout but Fo76 fails to meet expectations from a AAA game company when it comes to developing and marketing a game especially a Fallout game.
---
The daughter set them all up or killed them herself. Why would she admit they were actually dead?
---
Reddit sure hates papers lol.
---
Two shot explosive  just sucks now anyways lok
---
It really is honestly! &amp; I thank you :)
---
I'll buy regular nuka colas if you sell them
---
The creepiest experience I had was at the Abandoned Bog Town. I just killed a 3-star legendary Super Mutant on one of the roof tops... and then FIVE Super Mutant Behemoths spawned on the same roof! 2 of them fell off right away, but all 5 started attacking me. Craziest thing I've ever seen.
---
I miss those days. It was nice being able to outfit my new characters with legendary gear almost right out of the vault.
---
Player vending is great. You can find wildly overpriced garbage or real gems. Plus serums are so easy to find now
---
I think like other aid items there might be two different goo's because ive also ran into a few that didn't give me rads after drinking it
---
Oh you don‚Äôt want bloodied builds to buy your overpriced 1* Bloodied weapons? I couldn‚Äôt tell!
---
My theory is that all of the factions that have been featured in the Atom Shop over the past few months will make an appearance in Wastelanders.
---
&gt;Granted I should slow down when and take my time but it can easily happen when you‚Äôre in a rush.
---
You can't have THIS Bethesda nanny-state you. Knowing them, the ones in the new special tab will be wiped permanently from your inventory.
---
It's the church on the hilltop, inside harpers ferry. There's a couple workbenches, where armor and weapon plans can spawn. Small chance of a legendary mutant inside as well.
---
You can see it to the NE from within the top floor of the ruined building where the display cases are. Lots of mutants and 2-3 turrets, up the stairs outside, that can cause some grief.
---
I use a guided missile launcher to get an SB's or cargobot's attention to bring it in range for my short range weapons, but that's about it. They're very ineffective even with 5 points in the Demolitions perk.
---
There's already a hidden vending machine for the Enclave that allows you to trade in commendations for weapons and armor ;)
---
Got the same roll on a Two-shot auto nade launcher. Too much fun!
---
Interesting. I will try this. 
---
Thanks
---
Or you could just, you know, not shop there... Just a thought.
---
It was sometime in the spring/early summer
---
I am on of the few always looking for missiles
---
Hahahahaha I asked this same question to someone who didn‚Äôt enjoy my workshop visit.
---
This is the only game I can play when a black mood hits. Almost every time it is a wonderful retreat, or an actual "fix" for the depression. Happy Thanksgiving, glad this community exists, helps keep me sane.
---
Oooo two shot would be awesome with those other 2. Nice!
---
Good to know, once I bought and learned all those from him I never really went out of my way to find him cause I didn't think I needed them. I'll start getting them again and tossing them in vendors for others. Wish I saw that more of the responder vendor bot stuff in vendors, I rarely see others selling the clothing anymore, and when I do its a clean space suit for 10-20k, which seems a bit high.
---
AA, Junkies and bloodied are the only options for an endgame build
---
I use my two shot rw missle launcher to shoot things like  keycard escorts because of the lock-on. And I shoot the sbq because she is far away and it's just fun to tickle her chin with missiles. And two shot missle launchers didn't get nerfed with the tse nerf. So technically each missile does 1000+ damage with Demo expert
---
This is the best Christmas ask post I have seen lol.
---
I think commando works better because of dps. I had a plain Jane full health stealth rifleman with aa and instigating guns, and it's great for killing most things. But against highly armored enemies in the endgame, it's too difficult to keep up. 
---
Having a high fire rate gun, especially combined with stealth hits and crits, makes it so much easier to blast away those enemies.
---
It might be preference, though. Which is weird cause in every other fallout, stealth sniper was my go to. I have tons more fun with my commando though.
---
I‚Äôm happy we share the same sentiment. Honestly I love this community for varies reason but that‚Äôs one of the biggest ones. I‚Äôm always available to speak to whenever as well!
---
I hear a lot of people always saying commando rather than rifleman so there must be something there, I'll give it a shot.
---
Handmade-wise, which magazine do people use? The high capacity ones or the armor piercing?
---
Well like you saw, I've got Nukas galore for sale haha
---
hmm I might actually have some somewhere (I have probably a thousand photos from photomode/camera).
---
Red rockets.
---
üòê
---
two shot on shotguns has been bugged since launch
---
That's so weird, because everyone I see spawn into my camp spawns exactly where I do. From what I can tell, the spawn location is *usually* a little over half the length of a camp zone towards the Northeast away from the module, which is just such a strange design for them to go with. 
---
What's even weirder is that I've noticed the distance you fast travel plays a factor as well. When I fast travel from far away I end up spawning in a completely different spot than when I fast travel from close by. It all just makes no sense and feels needlessly complicated for no reason. lol
---
nobody at bethesda plays this game
---
If it was possible to have a 1/4 trim around the bottom in white and 3/4 wall for the rest then you see a nice red/white stripe mix but with half walls it just doesn't work. Yeah I'm ps4.
---
Awww
---
I've got regular
---
I think they are.
---
Time to start stocking up on coal.
---
Maybe he bought a hard copy didn't like it so he traded it in....bet you was like "what you got banned for exploiting and dupping?  Good go to hell blablabla"... This community is great UT so many people with their finger on the trigger with even knowing the whole story...really sad
---
hehehe my fiance's second character will fall to his death if he spawns in before his house does, because he built it over a cliff. But I'm safe when I fast travel there, he didn't do it to be a jerk and kill other people. He just kills himself. Maybe this weekend I'll get him to relocate that.
---
I've known about this issue for a while now, and from what I've seen, it's mostly been people targeting Fallout 1st players.
---
Meant refrigerated!
---
Depends on what your legendary of choice is. On most handmades, I'd suggest armor piercing. My preference is piercing and stinging, so you can get faster reloads or more ammo capacity as well. That with tank killer is aces.
---
If you happen to run with an Anti-armor handmade, however, I'd say go for straight ammo capacity. Armor penetration caps (or has diminishing returns) at a certain point, i forget what percentage. But if you have Anti-armor and tank killer, you're at the cap and having armor piercing magazines won't help with dps as much as ammo capacity
---
I never said I didn't have anything to do on 5 characters. Reading comprehension is difficult, isn't it?
---
Yes. Every time I spawn into my camp it places me in the water and I almost instantly gain a disease every time.
---
"Here dearie have this berserkers missile launcher and 5 missiles and don't use them all on the same enemy." - Grandma Murmrgh
---
Don‚Äôt be a pushover, fight for your right to scavenge Appalachia. All you need for PVP is a good weapon such as a Quad auto Gamma or a good LMG, like Junkies exploding or Anti-armor exploding. They‚Äôll never see it coming. I‚Äôm level 157 and never initiate PVP, but I end it quickly. Just yesterday, a 150 ish shot me a few times, I give him the confused emote, waited till he reloaded and out comes the Junkies Exp LMG. No build can withstand an exploding LMG...
---
Worst thing about the whole mule thing is we still have no sepperate account stash like most online games have had for decades. But I'm sure they really like when people buy multiple accounts. 
---
It'd also be neat if we had Fridges that can sell food so people can open restaurants but they wanted to make it an unintuitive paid "utility" item that just wastes space.
---
I helped a low level out earlier. They were in the forest region putting serious work into their workshop which is conveniently next to their camp. There was wayyy too much effort placed onto the workshop which wasnt even locked in resources. He was very vulnerable to have someone pvp him and destroy his camp. I fixed his turrets and tried to team up with him but he didn't comply. So I left some plans and wished him goodluck because he's an easy target to grief.
---
Thats my point. You e obviously got stuff that you still need to do. Youre asking for more and havent even done everything yet. 
---
But conversation progression is difficult isnt it?
---
NPCs are in q1 next year
---
Sorry. I would offer to build you some. I am on the PS4.
---
If you ever see a two shot FFR faster reload one grab it. I have one and it's complete garbage for combat but LOL you can carpet bomb the hell out of stuff. I once took 200rds and cleared harpers ferry without even leaving the train tracks.
---
That was nice of you ! I‚Äôm a lvl 90 and everytime I come across a camp or anything I try to help &amp; fix stuff üòäthank you for what you do!:)
---
Ill adventure with ya and conplete your quests or help level ya, dextrouspick539
---
The Whitespring to me is a cross between some gypsy flee market and the space port Mos Eisley; and I love it! 
---
    You show up to some vendors place to shop and next thing you know some guy with a  butt for a mouth is barking and shooting over spilt blue milk or who the hell knows what. Then his buddy with a pig nose shows up talking about how they don‚Äôt like you and how they have death sentences on 3 servers. Then before you can react some lvl 600 jedi appears out of thin air, kills both with a weapon you‚Äôve never seen, gives you the thumbs up then vanishes. Your left starring at paper bags and dead bodies thinking and laughing what in thee hell is going on.
---
I believe it can be found on your loading screen :V
---
PC?
---
Ha!    PS4
---
I think I tend to underprice in my vendors, but I am sure you are right.
---
"I can't make a new character" is all that I said. I never said whether I agreed with OP or not. I didn't ask for more. Also, why do you care? Lmao.
---
I did the same thing recently. I have Unyielding Sentinel on my Bloodied Commando. My full health will be running Sentinel Assassin.
---
The problem with Vanguard is that you get diminishing returns on damage resistances, so amping those up doesn't help much.
---
If you're going for PVP, Sentinel Assassin seems ideal. If you're going for PvE, something Sentinel that also gives you resistance to whatever creatures you fight most often would make sense. +1 Agility and/or AP refresh perks would also be desirable.
---
blame reddit for their constant whining that resulted in tse and explosives overall being nerfed to the ground
---
the nerf was so bad i quit for months
---
Cool! I just pm‚Äôd you
---
Damn it takes that long now? I got 4 backpacks for all my characters in 1 day the week it came out... Sucks that you can't trigger campfire tales every night but good job I guess..
---
Thanks, I do happen to have an anti armor handmade so I'll convert it to automatic, buy commando cards and give it a shot.
---
So violence them back
---
Radiation helps those running Bloodied builds, as having the radiation cap your health keeps your health at the desired rate for the Bloodied effects to kick in for optimal effect. Putting the Radiation cleaners in a doorway is, while understandably appreciated, would be better off placed at a designated "shower" area, rather than making it a requirement...come on, it's not contagious...
---
Same reason you keep responding. We are both assholes.
---
I too roleplay a McPoyle.
---
I think Shell Shock is just liquid Aids you drain AP even if not shot at and it essentially kills melee and vats characters and it is aquired from the insanely fast and bullet sponge wolves.
---
No worries, I kinda like what I've got anyway.
---
No, there's only one of those here.
---
Bloodied combat shotguns are still good as long as you're inside the range drop off distance. Just don't bother trying to use a suppressor or it's worse than melee distance, which is sad.
---
I know exactly where it is but you're on ps4

Behold! He is coming with the clouds! And every eye shall be blind with his glory! Every ear shall be stricken deaf to hear the thunder of his voice! Let the men, women, and children of the Earth come forth to gather and behold the power of Atom! Let those who dwell here in his favored land attend now to the words of the Prophet of Atom! Come forth and drink the waters of the Glow, for this ancient weapon of war is our salvation, it is the very symbol of Atom's glory! Let it serve as a reminder of the Division that has occurred in the past and the resplendence of the promise of our division in the times to come! Give your bodies to Atom, my friends. Release yourself to his power, feel his Glow, and be Divided. There shall be no tears, no sorrow, no suffering, for in the Division, we shall see our release from the pain and hardships of this world. Yea, your suffering shall exist no longer; it shall be washed away in Atom's Glow, burned from you in the fire of his brilliance. Each of us shall give birth to a billion stars formed from the mass of our wretched and filthy bodies. Each of us shall be mother and father to a trillion civilizations. Each of us shall know peace, shall know an end to pain, and shall know Atom in his glory. I urge you, my friends -- come, drink with me and pray... Glorious Atom, I give unto you these feeble bones. I present to your will this frail body. I beg of you to use me as your vessel, guide me to your brilliance, divide each particle and give relief to this rotten flesh. Cast the fragile form of this ephemeral body into new life in the forge of your Glow. Atom, come -- bestow your presence on your unworthy servant. We stay true, until the Day of Division -- until the dawn of your return to His humble world.
---
Full wall and half wall. Just really tall ceilings next time.  
---
I‚Äôll have to find ya on PSN to catch your creations irl.
---
Well im sorry, next time ill try to be on your level and not be so nice. ;)

Nothing wrong with that, since they have a guaranteed spawn in 76, making them glorified trophy food, that isn't nearly as rare as it was in 4.
---
Oh no  haha.
---
It is awesome.
---
Lol it's a fact, ignore it or not, it doesnt change the fact. Your findings aren't enough of a sample size for you to speculate and suggest certain legendary effects have different drop rates, which is what you are doing.
---
I'm literally proving you wrong and you say it doesnt matter what I say. What a stupid way of thinking. Lol
---
Heavy BOS Combat armor gives you the highest overall Ballstic/Energy Resistance, but 0 natural Radiation Resistance.
---
Scout has the highest Ballistic Resistance but lower Energy Resistance and lower overall Resistance than Heavy BOS Combat.
---
Marine is an all-arounder that includes Radiation Resistance at the cost of lower Ballistic and Energy Resistances.
---
Marine or Heavy BOS combat would be my recommendation. As I mentioned in another section of this thread, you get diminishing returns with resistances. Also keep in mind that you can use a backpack to supplement any resistance you are lacking.
---
Or mininukes. If I wanted to tickle enemy supermutants, then I'd just use those instead of a feather. I kill them faster with the alien blaster.
---
Community is awesome, but the game is buggy and Bethesda have caught the monetization curse. I am worried for the future but if they worked on just making a great game and take bugs seriously they would do fine.
---
Just for fun against trash mobs, but that's only because I'm a heavy weapons build with a focus on weight reduction. I offset it with heavy damage primary weapons.
---
I believe that the place that you originally plant your camp determines where YOU spawn. The current location of your CAMP unit determines inbound fast travelers. You can move it to change inbound visitors on a horizontal axis only.
---
So, you can't even win the fake argument you were having with nobody, so you resort to poor insults? Lmao.
---
We all know damn well we just jump on a house with marsupial and heavy gun that bitch lmao
---
Thank you!  Love me some Nuka-grenades.
---
I love seeing these things in Nuclear Winter. The people who have them are usually trying to use the shadowy appearance to hide. It's always super awesome when a "bush" starts shouting about Communists.
---
Sigh. I can see theres just no progression with you. Congrats. You win asshole of the day. Funny how you are so willing to dish it out but start crying wolf as soon as someone uses humor. Jeez. Im sorry for whatever happened in your life that made you this way. If my hugs counted as much as the ones your mom should have given you, id offer those. But they wont.
---
I've got a nice berserkers explosive 50 cal. Curious to see how that might play out.
---
I prefer a more environmental approach: a bunch of guys invited me onto their team just to kill me. So when I respawned I led a Radscorpion over to where they were AFK and kept circling where they were standing until it attacked them instead.
---
Also I‚Äôve discovered if someone disputes your workbench and kills you, if you ignore them and don‚Äôt respawn for a bit the base defenses will attack. I once saw a guy get caught in a beautiful crossfire from the dozen of so turrets I setup.
---
Democracy spam is non-negotiable!
---
TBH I *want* to see all the comical ways people abuse a fast travel rug. It's worth the downsides just for the entertainment aspect, let alone the actual practical aspect of it.
---
I have no sympathy for all the cookie cutter bloodied builds. If you don't like the way I have my shit set up, feel free to shop somewhere else. Same for all those floating camps I completely ignore. People do their own thing, so there's no reason to tell someone else how to roll.
---
What the fuck is krampus? A German thing ?
---
It goes both ways :)
---
I've seen the crazy stuff too (and I don't do that, I don't think...) but I do have some things that people think are too expensive.  I had a guy get on area chat the other day and start ranting about how expensive my bobbles were.  In his rant, he said he'd give me some sage advice, and that if I wanted to make any money at all, I had to lower my prices.
---
If I am logged in for 5-6 hours, I can usually clear 5,000 to 10,000 caps.
---
I have experimented with prices, trying to figure out what to do.  There is some of the economics at play (supply/demand/ease of access).  I've seen the various lists that try to fix prices (never sell X for more than Y).  That's just pure socialism, frankly :)
---
I try to keep legendaries in my vendor, but they move too quickly at lower prices
---
For legendaries, I generally do $1k per star, with a +/- bump for good combinations, and I don't put in total garbage, I just scrip it.  But, it's hard to keep them in the vendor that way, they move quickly.  If I have something there for more than a week, it's probably priced wrong, I either lower it, or I just dump it.
---
Frankly, I move more on the bobbles/mags than anything else. It's nice having one place to just pick then up, and I think people appreciate that.
---
The reality is, I don't do it for the caps, I just enjoy finding stuff as I farm, and putting it out there.  I also give away a lot of things.  If people are cool, are willing to chat, that's worth more than caps.  I've given away god drop items just cause somebody was cool.
---
And my shop (at least right now) is the best attempt I could make to integrate it in -- it's "Platform 2" and looks like a north platform for the whitesprings station.  The cool stuff is underground, imho -- I created a small village/warren.
---
Sounds like you're the one here with a problem, I'm just having a good time. Hope you have a good day.
---
I do have a few crazy cool weapons, but I don't put those in the vendor.  So being cool and talking things up are the only way to get them :)
---
It'd also be nice if there was a level range indicated on the map.  It's a drag to zap across the map to find out that the gear is way too high or too low.
---
You won't permanently mess up your character, but having a build in advance can save you time. 
---
You can google one if you want. Otherwise use common sense and learn what the perks do. You can use nukes and dragons to create the build.
---
Junkie only needs certain addictions because some are less harmful than others to your build. You can google addictions and mutations to see what one's you want. 
---
Perk wise you can do what you want just don't focus on two different weapon types at the same time because you're only benefitting from one set of perks at a time. Consider how each perk scales. Junk weight reduction is only 75% but ammo is 90%. Blocker works VS everything that does melee and is significant, stuff like that.
---
I think some build sites break down the base perks that are really good to have in every build, but maybe someone will comment here and tell you what those are.
---
Sigh. Be creative. Just once.
---
I'm down. This could be the edge that berserker need. I already use a hazmat often enough one with reduced weapon weapon or powered would be super nice with a sneak boost or chameleon effect.
---
It'll get better, I believe in you.
---
Well, points for trying i guess. C minus.
---
I don't think it was a change.  But the personal cap limit for any character is 30k.
---
Ya it is idiotic to fight inflation in a game with an unbalanced economy to begin with. Let people get their caps, if they want to moderate caps there are other ways.
---
I have a more question, what does the cult of atom think of ghouls?
---
That's right, let it out if it makes you feel better about yourself. I can take it, even if you can't.
---
Ii get them quite often from treasure maps, but its completely random.
---
This ^.  You move the little foldy box thing.  It's hard to tell where it puts things, it feels random, but there is a tiny bit of predictability to it, so as you finesse things you can move it a little this way or that to get more precision.
---
Right!!  I can literally think of NO reason to lock doors.  It's not like we can steal anything!  I heard that somebody could steal your PA ... but I haven't heard that verified.
---
I can't deliver if no one responds
---
Thanks!
---
If I remember my lore correctly, the regular cult in Megaton hates them because they think they have been cursed by Atom. They "eat up" radiation to heal and don't die if aren't killed, so they don't reunite with Atom and their bodies don't give birth to endless new universes.
---
The Marie Curie III offshoot cult in Springvale, Broken Steel, worships them as champions of Atom and actively try to turn their own into ghouls.
---
No. Because if you can avoid getting addicted to drugs, it means you can take even MORE drugs.
---
Oh so basically they‚Äôre as split as the BOS.
---
True enough! Plus they're probably delicious!
---
Also as added Info: it would have a weakened effect on scorchbeast mostly since...well they are the main sources of the scorch (from what I know)
---
That's awesome glad ur days starting to go better
---
‚ÄúF‚Äù in the chat
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
This is amazing
---
I saw a group of  people doing this at train stations. They would drop a loot bag with some random scrap in to entice people into picking it up, and then they watch to see if they go outside and drop a tent to scrapbox it. If they do they attack them while they are in the menu. They had one guy at each station on the server, and all of them were under level 20 or so.
---
I watched them a bit and then took their bait scrap. With a hazmat suit on. After the second time they must have told each other because when I'd FT to another station they would grab up the bait bag and leave.
---
Good, they‚Äôre raiders id expect nothing less.
---
Addiction isn't a goal for anyone. It's just a side effects of their excessive drug use. The high is what they're after.
---
Nah, it should constantly pump you full of drugs instead :P
---
Im gonna move on with my day now. You can have the last word. Everyone reading this knows how bad you need it.
---
I haven't had that happen, but a couple times I've gone to the Morgantown airport and found Liberator bots in place of the all the normal scorched.
---
I also had a game where all the ghouls around fraternity row, VTU, Morgantown high school where spawning high level bloated and glowing like it was a nuke zone.
---
There‚Äôs an acid pit underneath a power transmission tower just south of the Monaghah power plant.
---
Cripple it with the Enforcer perk.
---
Use nukes and dragons. It'll let you play with perks until you fond something that feels right to your style.

Hey man I don't know what happened to you, but remember that it is only a question of time before the situation start to improve :)

Yup, and Tank Killer!

Ok cool I guess I will have to mess around and see whats what. Any good source for stackable items? (IE list)

Of course thank you so much :)

Steam punk builds for the win. I'll take a steam punk ffr handmade that gives a bonus damage for being well hydrated

The rose spot is good.
---
I think the CAMP owner's spot will move if you move the module, but the other players seem to go to the same spot regardless of it moving.
---
The best thing I've personally found to do it plop down the module, build around it, the move it where you want (maybe with some dialing in for your personal spawn point). Hasn't failed me yet. After building a CAMP I tend to find high ground and watch for player spawn and it has worked for my past 10\~ camps.
---
The other day after an SBQ a level 300 something started firing at everyone around with an explosive handmade as if he‚Äôs really looking for some ‚Äòpvp‚Äô action, when he shot at me I pulled out my quad auto gama, before i could go into menu and turn off Pacifist, he literally turned around, jumped into a ditch then logged off üòÇ
---
I just feel like helping out new players when I can. Good for you to thank us. Just return the favor when you get higher up.
---
Submit a ticket suggestion for it.  I did early after i posted.  The more people that do i believe they would do it!
---
The community is definitely one of the reasons why I stick around, well, that and a morbid fascination with all things post apocalyptic. But a good game and cool people to play it with can certainly ease hard times. Cheers! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç

True is just the mod on it I believe
---
Thanks dude! I will do ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Hate to break it to you but that was a free item, not even one that you pay atoms for so if they brought it back that's be a whole ordeal. 
---
There are around 8 different colors of the shaggy carpet flooring though within the atomic shop files. They only ever put out the white and the orange/red variant. So maybe someday they'll put them in.
---
This one is not "the action hero" it's a two shot explosive .50 cal machine gun labeled as "LEGACY" for sale in PS4 tho so it might be a legacy on PS4? Idk, the tse .50 cal is so rare I haven't seen or heard of it being dropped on anyone at all scince tse nerf

I've been given the goo by several people who were attempting to help get my rads back up, and all that happens is it makes the drinking sound lol. I've even asked them to consume some themselves, and it works for them.
---
How much you charging per?
---
Don't limit yourself to just the Syringer! I was hitting him with 2 different God-killer weapons. There was a third on my main character that would have been much better.
---
Yeah it's all good. Though I don't think you have a really maxed out char in two weeks. Just reaching level 50 doesn't mean anything. You need 3 star legendary armor sets and 3 star weapons and the right perk set and build in mind. Not to mention a base built around your char build.
---
Yau gui, mutant hound, sheepsquatch and glowing meat. Deathclaw for strength.
---
It's really fun to kill them when they have Godmode.
---
I was about level 130? I played like 12 hours a day(no life at the time).
---
Great idea!
---
Use descriptive titles when submitting a post. If the average user has to click on your post to understand the context, then it is not descriptive enough. If you're posting a question, put it in the title and give further information inside. Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.
---
Its below the new river gorge bridge heading to Flatwoods...
---
Yup just a bit
---
There is no such thing as maxing your char unless you mean you have all perks at all levels.
---
If you mean level 50 then go back and play the game in PC because the game is very different before and after level 50.
---
No problem. You just hang in there and try to enjoy the holidays. If you're on PS4 and want some company, just drop me a line. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
I recall 2 such pipes off the top of my head... were there more? One was under water and had a small loot container. The other was an entrance to a forked tunnel.
---
Okay maybe maxed wasnt the right term. But i was about level 130 on my char
---
What console did you play on originally?
---
Yes but if you can see you van VATS and kill even quicker.
---
Pc, but sold it recently and am using my ps4.
---
Thank you!!!!

They made a few horror movies about the creature. Most that I've seen are pretty bad, but I enjoyed [A Christmas Horror Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Christmas_Horror_Story), and [Krampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus_(film))
---
Everyone runs from the quad gamma...
---
Pretty sure I have 700+ hours and I'm still on the lookout for a small handful of plans.
---
True, but if they're using a stealth boy then you can't VATS them, at least not to my knowledge (I've tried, doesn't work for me). Plus you can just crouch, which that's all fine and dandy cause then you have to actually aim and then it's a battle of "who can aim better" lol
---
He also bleeds! I hope he's cool with all of the experimental stabbing.
---
They are no more expensive then Gold on World of tanks, or many of the boost items on mobile games.
---
They do look similar, but I've looked over the interloper very closely. The torso and head aren't similar enough to even say they're related.
---
I had all the main ones like house decorations, armour sets and most weapons, didnt have all attachments. I guess i could have worded my post better.
---
I guess it's possible if you followed guides to the letter but its not that fun
---
I have gotten a Hunter's The Fixer and more recently an Executioner The Fixer with 90% less weight with the sale going on now.
---
I've done some ground breaking builds which you can find on my channel (shameless whoring right there) but I also try to stream my builds at the end of a week sometimes. My camps never really last long cos I'm constantly building.
---
It was for the first week or so but very draining and i burnt out quick.
---
Glitch underground, and place it just barely off the edge of a platform so when you arrive you are hovering in air.  Then you have a choice... jump to the platform, or move the wrong way and plummet to your possible death (you will survive only if you have bird bones).
---
Haha yeah baby!
---
That‚Äôs why I think they should un nerf everything they have done. Then introduce a PVP in adventure mode for people like you that want a more ‚Äúeven‚Äù PVP. Like an arena that you can enter and fight 1v1 2v2 and maybe only 2 weapons, stims and radaway.
---
Should dress up grahm as santa and have him lead us in a fight against an evil santa(behemoth dressed as santa)

I think I said 5 caps to 20 depending on the type of Cola but for reg I'll say like 2caps per
---
Happy turkey day!  Depression sucks but this game rules so play on, playa.
---
Psst broken armour with legendary effects work for berserkers
---
Thank you.
---
Shit I'll pay you 5 caps per lol how many do you have available? Ide like to buy 20 to 50 of them if you have extras
---
Definitely sounds like it could be interesting
---
Nukashine is about the only thing I don't put in mine. I like it (and Nuka Quantum) better as a camp decoration. My punch bowl is usually stocked with whatever random booze I pick up or make for craft booze daily/weekly challenges.
---
Well on PS4 you'd need to pay for the PSN and you'd have to level up again, first 50 levels could be painful without abusing the game or help from others.
---
I'd go back to PC and farm stuff but again I don't know if you like simple farming. This is game with pretty routine stuff to do, really not much excitement.
---
Thank you and happy turkey day to you as well ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yeah I feel that. I drop non max level legendary weapons and armor constantly because who cares lol the community is great as I whole I believe.
---
You proved nothing no matter what you claim, which a stupid way of arguing. I kept track of all the drops ever since murmur came into existence, and my observation is certain prefixes saw a steady decline over the months.
---
Ok.  Which end of the bridge.  Mind you it's overcast currently  lol
---
You can't destroy Camps unless both players initiate PVP.
---
Yes def on PS4 üòä
---
I like farming for stuff but unfortunately I dont have my PC anymore so id have to start over.
---
It really is! üòä‚ù§Ô∏è

I went to the location the other day, wearing my very expensive full surround-sound headset with directional audio. The sound appears to be coming from an invisible above-ground source or *maybe* a source just below ground level. It didn't appear to be coming from inside any of the buildings or vehicles. I would always walk "past" the music as I approached the buildings or the vehicles. Not sure how else to explore this unless a camp can be built underground, close enough to get a peek.
---
Opeü§£ I forgot I modded it,  you're right
---
But the point of a stealth boy is to make you cannot be seen. And being unable to VATS them is a logical extra perk derived from the fact that you cannot see them.
---
I talked with some of the data miners, and they tell me that the dive suit is in the game files, but there's no legitimate way to obtain it.

I got 3 from 4 attempts a few months back. I've only gotten one more since.

Please keep me posted on this. I have one of my characters stationed in Harpers Ferry to explore :)

Now, the downside to this build is you have to run at less than 1/4 health. I stay irradiated, running on about 35-40 out of 282 hp. But, this puts me at 38 Str and my damage ataround 1800. Once you get the best armor you can (strive for +str on each peice) you could be pushing 44 str and 2500 damage. More if you use chems, deathclaw steak and whiskey!!!
---
nope got it from online, they said my key is not valid and I dont have the credentials, I gave the info they wanted but they said theres nothing they can do. idk been over it and is planning on rebuying as long as its more stable
---
Talking to the data miners, they confirmed that the terminal entry in the Whitespring Bunker was hidden from view until it was unlocked when the Burrows went live.

This guy mutates!

BrainRot31415, ill be on tonight.
---
I imagine there‚Äôs enough fools out there to make it worth it
---
Good God... there is hope!
---
Yup, but Prime the weapon and it's even better, against ALL enemies! You'll need to keep up with crafting the Ultracite ammo of course.
---
I've heard bad things about ps4 performance. But since I play on PC I haven't looked into it myself. Might want to check that.
---
Okay okay, thanks.
---
I can't really think of a reason to have it except as a back up to a bloodied stealth sniper build
---
I always go with the watoga highway, no resources but you can plant a water purifier underground and you're protected from any attacks. Nearby is a junk excess at the power plant
---
"Women's Clothes"... give her your shirt ya dick.
---
Power fists doing more damage than missiles is kind of funny.
---
I run a stealth commando build with a full set of chameleon sneak urban scout armor and I have an AAE handmade and an AAFFR handmade. I mop the floor with pretty much anything with sneak attack criticals and I never come out of caution. I find AA to be better than TSE but only slightly. TSE is perfectly viable if you have the proper build for it. Just because it doesn't one-shot everything like bloodied doesn't mean it's not good.
---
i like the idea id love to see some carawans with wastelanders
---
the problem is that 
---
first of all, they wont disable fasttravel because there would be an outrage so railroads would be obsulete (i hope obsulete is an actual word) 
---
and second, there are a bunch of locations were the railroads are blocked and those locations would nees to be changed so that using the railroads makes sense üò¨
---
Depends on how you play, you'll gravitate to a build. I was a stealth sniper (and some melee) as I felt comfortable and rewarding so I went with a bloodied stealth sniper build with 33 strength. I can usuallly have over 200 pounds of free space on my character as I hover at abput 430 weight I can carry. 
---
So the question is, how do you play? Bloodied may not be fun for some and junkied may not be either
---
What you looking for?
---
That's exactly what I'm trying to build, lmao. All I have to do is collect every single piece of bloodied now
---
Flower on the Map near TotW. Pond with a small cave and a little boat. Acid node under the water.
---
I have a bloodied ffr fat man. It does about 3500 at 30% health. I like the idea of melee being the most op because it requires close contact but that also means close access to the enemies vitals.
---
This. In real life. This too.
---
Bad luck bryan moment. Server hop. Also its possible that the more of a type of legendary gun you have, you will have a higher chance of getting it in return. Worked with ny two shots and bloodied.
---
The Dragon! I had it on my previous character but now I can‚Äôt get it at all
---
Same thing happens to my base camp. I just ignore it because they arent causing actual damage to themselves. Just sounds like never ending warfare.
---
No you didn't.
---
Mine has a switch and is usually set to off. Your choice then.
---
Heard that!
---
If you feel that you were done with the game already, you're probably not going to feel like much if anything has changed. You'll have to take a fresh approach, experiment with different play styles and savor the flavor. After all, this is a game that deserves to be savored
---
You can crouch, use cover, drain enemy AP with cryo damage, or use chameleon effects to combat Vats builds.

Tesla don't care if you crouched. It don't care if you in cover or invisible or whatever. It zaps yo ass no matter what. What do you do to combat stealth boys and teslas? You can eat some mentats and occasionally see some pink mist. Unless you have ultra high damage weapons (like duped legacies), you are stuck doing the same exact thing.
---
Even if they're not doing damage, the constant sound of meaningless gunfire would begin to annoy me.
---

---
Yau Gui, Mutant hound, Sheepsquatch and Glowing meat for melee damage. Deathclaw for STR.
---
Well there wasn't really a massive update, there are some short questlines, some more challenges, general QoL changes, bug fixes, perk and effects tweaking, legendary merchant, atom shop items, some new events including a robotic boss fight near SQB level, some new locations, Fallout 1st, a Raid with insanely short timing constraints, and a Battle Royal Gamemode.
---
A change you should be aware of is that both Two Shot and Explosive legendary effects had been nerfed to hell so whatever meta you were using is outdated. 
---
A major change to the farming scene is that you can now sell legendaries to a machine located at every train station for scrips and use said scrips to do buy random legendaries at the legendary merchant.
---
There were some seasonal events and frankly those were what most players enjoyed the most.
---
Google Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter for a brief view at what exactly did they add to the game.
---
Before i was rushing to best everything and this time i want to relax and enjoy it, just didnt know how the game has been over the past year or so with updates and all that.
---
Amen. Don't like the CAMP, feel free to move on.
---
Try to stay logged in more than a few hours without getting disconnected though.
---
Yeah it will eventually but I don't visit it often but when I do I welcome the sounds of war. Explosions and turrets.
---
Store the turret and and then replace it, seems to reboot the wonky IFF system on it.
---
Exactly what i was looking for! Appreciate it!
---
Max level Bloodied handmade with FFR and 250 dr.
---
Gathering dust.
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
Find a reason to play. Like go hunt all the big game in the Mire starting from the top. Then do the same for the bogg region. Have some fun bud.
---
Thanks man.
---
S...senpai
---
You're right, I didnt prove it. Other people did and I cited them, pointed you to the information, and explained to you why you have the misconceptions you do. You're actively choosing to be wrong - that is what I called stupid.
---
Results vary. You have noticed trends that others havent, and vice versa. This conspiracy theory crap that Bethesda is going in and tweaking drop rates so you dont get good gear is ridiculous. You didn't get the stuff you wanted and you're upset. Get over it.
---
Actually, you make a REALLY good point here. I don't believe that there is any lore that indicates other BOS factions on the east coast until the West Coast BOS moves back to the DC area in the 23rd century. If the BOS is to return in Wastelanders, remnants of the Appalachian BOS chapter would need to survive.
---
That also causes a second problem - there is no Appalachian BOS chapter in the 23rd Century. The West Coast BOS chapter ventures out to DC. You'd think if there was a local group available, the West Coast chapter would hook up with Appalachia before heading to DC.
---
That would mean that if the BOS Burrows survivors are still alive, they either aren't with the BOS anymore OR they are with the BOS, but they eventually die anyway. The lore timeline is a bit tricky.
---
I've noticed purveyor "streaks" as well. My last one was every weapon was coming out with 25% faster fire rate (FFR), which is awesome, problem was all of the weapons and major prefixes were kind of crap... I'm not going to build around a Stalkers Crossbow, even if it has FFR. Needless to say, I have the rest of the week covered for weapons to turn in for scrip
---
Not a nano person eh?
---
Let me know if you do find something. It would be interesting to find another clue!
---
Or shoot em and hit my explosive bullet on my unrendered brahmin and kill myself
---
I'm not even sure this specific spot exists in the game. I've been scouring the forest for the past 2 hours and there's no clearing that looks exactly like this, with these exact trees bundled up together exactly like that and the background hill looking exactly like that. The closest I got was a clearing near Tyler County Dirt Track, but like I said it was missing a few trees and such
---
An inoculation exists already, courtesy of the Responders. They figured it out just before they all died.
---
Duly noted
---
Vendor items are server based, vendor caps are player based. So server hopping should reset the items you are seeing, but not the caps left for that time period. If you can get to the Whitespring vendors (inside the Atrium) you should have more things to choose from on each hop.
---
Lol no one goes and talks to Biv- sell it for what you want. 
---
It‚Äôs honestly a sellers market for that one imho
---
I'd turn this in for script but yeah, that's just me. Here's my reasoning: Vampire is cool because of that heath Re-gen. But on a lever the benefit is minimal. With an automatic weapon however, you'd get the full benefits. Damage resist while reloading is a good one to have on a lever because, you got to reload the thing after 5 shots ( unless it is a quad ).
---
Simple, your title should describe the content of your post.
---
Lmao
---
I doubt they can even make anything like that on short notice like that. But i have no idea how it works lol. It would be impressive to me tho
---
Important to stay crouched with this gun due to the 250DR issues atm.
---
I've been infected by looting the corpse of a ghoul that I killed from a long distance...
---
(Sigh)
---
Nice one my dude! I gave it a try before but I‚Äôm pretty sure it kept putting me on the same server so just wanted to check! I rinse the vendors of most of their caps most days so I know caps don‚Äôt respawn till the next day! Thanks again Dude!
---
Wow, monster player kill griefer! =P
---
If pc whats your IGN ill play with you tonight! Only lvl 80 ish though
---
Ooh, thanks for the confirmation! And since I am, in fact, aiming for something with around 250 DR (BOS combat chest and polymer scout limbs, maybe some trapper for a smidgen of RR), those numbers fit quite nicely...
---
Oh yeah? What don't I know about?
---
 Player (Avengath) says it is below the new river gorge bridge.  It looks very similar.  Tyler County dirt track looked promising too, frustrating!    Who know you may be right.
---
Keep that gun as 250DR is supposed to be fixed next month ( December ) so it should be a good weapon.
---
Then get it! I love doing events with my crew, trading the absolute crap drops we get, experimenting with builds, selling the cool stuff I find out of my CAMP vending machine and making sure everyone has whatever they need to have a fun time battling whatever thing they want to battle
---
Nice gun
---
Where?
---
Inside the vault
---
It's almost like you guys are actively trying to get scammed.
---
If they add the railroad and disable FT to except Vault 76, camps, tents, and workshops, I think it'd be fine. Just keep the map markers and dont put FT to Fallout 1st, that'd make me sick. Also do it in a hardcore gamemode.
---
Blockades are easy, it's mostly just some objects that need to be deleted.
---
No PC just PS4 but I do wish to own one! One day ! Lol
---
Gotta love being scammed by shitty companies am I right?
---
I've found the community here and over at r/fo76FilthyCasuals to be awesome! Not sure what it is about a post nuclear wasteland that brings the best out in folks, but it's here in spades.
---
Glad that you took the time to post this :-) A very Happy Thanksgiving to you and enjoy your time exploring the Wastelands!
---
Well you're certainly making him look like he's right here by trying to defend scummy business practices.
---
YES! I‚Äôve realized that playing this game. I use to be afraid of I like gaming bc of how people can be but this game has opened many doors for me. &amp; thank you so much for your comment and happy thanksgiving to you as well üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yes for normal games, but fo76 is not a normal game. It's a Games as a Service mmoprg. That same logic does not apply in this case. FO76 is more comparable to Destiny or Warframe.
---
true. learned cuz i definitely want to make a bunch of it. hopefully get another to sell.
---
Because no point in wasting my time to go there just to have nobody except me be a pylon its annoying.
---
Keep showing to drink and hangout. It‚Äôll come again
---
Because the best thing you got from them was the fixer plan but almost everyone has them now so the value has dropped alot.
---
Is that still a thing? I have 50 Cal. with the 250 DR while aiming, I bring it to the queen and just keep it in aim mode all the time. I am pretty sure it makes a difference because her sonic attack does very little damage to me. That all said, I stay crouched and have been beaten up by cave crickets.
---
If you play explosives then you'd say it. Just not as enthusiastically because missiles still weigh too much for the damage they do.
---
You can only use it for this purpose, everybody is merchant in this game, and basically there is  almost no interaction with other players, just in public events, and without an engage in PvP your camp it's immune from player damage, and let's be honest only Legendary stuff got a real demand by other players, and since the maximum of CAP per character is only 30k your shop will be closed 90% of the time.
---
The event is bugged out.
---
This is why i like always having both a missile launcher and grenade launcher on me at all times, If i dont want to keep the missiles or 40mm grenades i can just lob them all at the next thing that moves, or just fire them off randomly for fun.
---
So long as your crouched your good. 
---
As for it not ‚Äúbeing a thing anymore‚Äù I haven‚Äôt seen it mentioned in notes as being fixed so I have to assume it lives!
---
My best guess is underground!
---
Isn't there some tool to open the map files directly?
---
Agreed!
---
I'm up for trying them out. I've only done them to farm Crickets for Acid but I'm interested in doing them properly. L182, Rifle/Shotgun crippler build, also a Crafter so can supply Ammo, PA and anything else.
---
Which items? I mainly deal in weapons and can have some pretty epic bloodied stuff around for 1250c for days.
---
You mean like literally every other npc enemy that no one bitches about? Unless you count how the AI tends to mildly cheese with long distance pokes, then folks tend to complain, only because the turrets we get have really crap range.
---
I find it hard to believe that the fixer plan is less rare. If they weren‚Äôt rare they would be sold in camp vendors
---
explosives builds will be the new meta in the future
---
Drop on the spot
---
not so far, I love it
---
It's not that they are less rare.  It's that the value has dropped because there's less of a demand for it . That's why it used to be sold for 20k and now it barely being sold for 10k
---
Buy also yes
---
I always find bags of missiles and mini nukes just lying around
---
Nothing in the shop is worth the atoms
---
Yup mine does just over 1100dmg. Great for clearing adds.
---
In recent weeks the cosmetic shop is terrible, have no idea who design those horrible items, they should just monetize big selling great stuff, but after 1 year I never spent a money on the shop since items are often not really good looking, and still I have plenty of Atoms from challenges.
---
Your first paragraph perfectly matches my own experience. I haven't yet noticed a correlation between the travel distance and which of the 3 or 4 possible locations I spawn in, but I'll try to pay attention to this in the future.
---
6 items on show, it's pretty good if you have a bar or something similar set up.
---
Glad to hear a positive. I think that most of the frustrated angry at the world DB's bent on trying to ruin this game for the fresh players have mostly moved on after realizing they can't win. Don't be in a rush and have fun.
---
I have a bloodied ML that on paper does over 2k dmg. When it hits the mobs however, I see numbers like 20-30 etc.
---
SBQ literally takes 1 dmg from it.
---
worst combo in the game. 
---
You are correct, takes all the fun out of PVP.
---
Its a one sided fight.  When I encounter one of these types of players, I leave the server.
---
It is a lot better than it was imo.
---
It fits in if you have a woodsy, traditional-looking CAMP, at least on the inside.  It can hold 6 items altogether.  The bottom two can be of pretty much any height.  The rest will clip through the shelves if they are taller than a teddy bear.
---
I put a Desk Fan on the lowermost shelf.  It looks nice.
---
Think it would take cups, plates etc? I want it as an old world crockery cabinet.
---
Thank you :-)
---
This game has folks from all walks of life, all ages, all backgrounds, coming together to rebuild Appalachia. For all the flap the game got in the press, it's contents offer a little something for everyone. Build, shop, mod, kill, whatever your vice, the game has got you covered. I've put in an embarrassing amount of hours already since launch, and anticipate an embarrassing amount more because of the community.
---
If I don't see ya in the Wastelands I look forward to seeing you again in the subs!
---
How in the world does someone just ‚Äòproved it‚Äô when even Bethesda itself admits its drops are being adjusted from time to time. Actually you‚Äôre the one who needs to ‚Äòget over it‚Äô when others voice their findings, unless it‚Äôs part of your responsibility to defend Bethesda of course.
---
Unless you are in an active lobby meaning a big turn out for the queen. Dont bother. Encryptid is just people sitting around ready to steal any loot. They wont revive, they wont really shoot and they absolutely wont be a pylon. Plus your most likely only getting a fedora.
---
I have a log cabin, sounds perfect.  Thanks.
---
Happy thanksgiving! 
---
Relax and play man, meet some fine people along the way. Can be magical in this game it is a great community sometimes.
---
~3.8k dmg on mine, one shots anything that's not legendary.
---
I'd bother bringing it more if it didn't weigh the combined weight of the moon and Jupiter. Of and the Silly weight of the ammo.
---
That‚Äôs really up to you to decide isn‚Äôt it.
---
It's because all the tough enemies you'd want to use a big, hard hitting weapon like a missile launcher on all have explosive resistance. It's so fucking counter intuitive and makes explosives fucking useless on certain enemies.
---
I never cared about getting the fixer plans, i want the imposter outfit, i got that plan on my 4th time lol
---
It looks so much better then the display cases imo, especially for cups, plates, drinks etc. Stuff like that looks really odd in the cases because their to small to fill all the space. It‚Äôs absolutely worth 300 atoms for me.
---
Nah, I vote for an actual Krampusnacht. Think of a week were our statistics are what creates the outcome. High pvp kills, you get attacked by Krampus, an immortal demon of baleful punishment. High pve kills, he leaves a single gift, and moves on. High pvp kills that are ONLY bounties, and he rewards you with a powerful weapon for acting as a karmic check, as he does. These stats reset every year, so you won't always be beaten to death with a bundle of switches, and it would act as a check to griefers.
---
I am constantly running short on 40mm grenades, theyre good with my 2shot auto grenade launchers
---
Horrible time haha
---
I figured that out after awhile... super annoying haha. The quest tells me 'Generator' but the signs are 'Turbine' and I didn't clue in because they were both 'Generator' for Poseidon, I believe. :/
---
I tried to get into that chamber last night myself. No key. Now I have to find it again! Odd that they removed it. But things that were odd are what led me to this post in the first place :)
---
Simple answer: 80% runs bloodied so they stay on top, rest don't know what a Stimpak is.
---
Yea I usually do that one but it wasn't popping.
---
Depends. If you sell a quad tesla for 5k, someone is going to buy that and easily resell it and 25k. I know many people who buy them at that price.
---
That's why i always keep raw fertilizer and toilet paper handy. Lock up yer beds!
---
I couldn't find the 'Generator' room the quest was telling me to go to. I didn't realize that Generator = Turbine for the signs, because Poseidon was just Generator.
---
Confusing and inconsistent, but not getting the quest tracker was probably the most frustrating part. xD
---
How specific of a gun could you give? I'm a vats rifleman build and have been looking for a two shot vats bonus type lever action
---
No problem, happy hunting!
---
 Player vending is awesome, at least for me it is. What sells: Serums, magazines, bulk junk, stimpacks, unusual clothing, 5.56 ammo and plans / recipes. What does not sell: bench made weapons &amp; armor, easy to find clothes, ( pastors vestments, really?) Grenades, missiles, food and any ammo except 5.56. I spend stupid amounts of time organizing, grinding for junk and stocking but it satisfies my inner shop keeper disease.
---
I used to game a lot on pc but hackers/cheaters put me off most multi player games. Some companies do all they can to stop them, kind of a losing battle with how fast technology moves, while other conpanies seem to do nothing at all. PC is a fantastic platform but with that comes people that are just as smart as developers and figure out ways to create cheats very easily. Bunch of websites that sell cheating software for a ton of differet games
---
There's 3 ways into the underneath of dyer chemical and I've entered through all 3 in the past. But now I can't.......I also checked again all 3 doors and I still can't get down there. All I remember about what was below is ghouls and flooded tunnels. But at the time I wasn't really paying attention to anything specific so I guess I could have missed some things.
---
Can only assume they've locked it to make some changes?
---
So just responder-free states?
---
Quad ffr faster reload Tesla‚Äôs
---
Jffr LVC fixers etc
---
You ask for a detailed explanation... and then shared the detailed explanation.
---
Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt by it. Did you buy it? No? Ten you can‚Äôt complain. Did you buy it? Yes? Ten cancel our subscription. And accept the fact it wasn‚Äôt what you wanted and move on. That simple.
---
Nice!
---
Bethesda never said they adjust drop rates before purveyor sales. What in the world are you talking about? Balance updates are not the same as what you're talking about, at all. 
---
You're not just "voicing your findings" though. And you know this. Quit being dishonest.
---
It can hold some junk items yeah. I have one of the House Teapots on it. Looks mega.
---
You don't remember where you got the teapot from do you?
---
So what is to stop us from releasing the cure into the water system using clean and clear‚Äôs infrastructure, it should seep into the bog and hopefully the saturation could at least prevent more life forms from being turned if not saving the life that already was. We could continue, treating other roaming individuals or packs with syringers, or modified cryolators we just need a plan
---
For Heart of the Swamp, that glitch can only happen if you don't wait until after the Strangler Heart "closes to protect itself"
---
Just use a less powerful weapon until this second phase starts. You'll no longer be able to 1-shot it, but you can still easily complete the event solo. 
---
I've never done the raids, but the same thing may or may not apply.
---
Normally attached in your Beth acc
---
Why though? Do you think it might help somehow or it is just fun?
---
Character is stored on their server. Youll lose your photos from 76 but they should still be on your HDD.
---
Good question. I'm not sure if the data is server based, or if your saves are on your system.
---
Nobody sells them, on PS4 would like to get my hands on one. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a successful run at that event. Like someone said, most people attack the robots and nobody takes the pylons.
---
I was camped out there for awhile, definitely a high level spawn area, but also so many things hide in those trees I decided to move camp (was during the free state missions)
---
Was it built so close to the white springs station that it nearly merged with the blue awning over the tracks? Ps4 Saturday night?
---
And the wendingo!
---
I think it's safe to say they are both some sort of FEV mutated creatures
---
I have yet to see anyone use missles, 40mm, or mini nukes as a practical ammo or primary weapon.
---
Biochemistry doesn't usually work that way. If I was Bethesda, here's how I'd address solving the Scorched Plague in a lore-friendly manner:
---
The Scorchbeasts spread the Scorched Plague. If we get rid of them, the plague can be contained. Bethesda already had a player initiative to kill as many Scorched and Scorchbeasts as possible before the PLANNED launch of Wastelanders. They could have plans to integrate that player effort into the launch of Wastelanders still.
---
When Vault 79 opens, word begins to spread of a massive treasure hidden in Appalachia. At the same time, rumors that the Dwellers of Vault 76 have eliminated the Scorchbeast threat, the Scorched, and they have an inoculation against the Scorched Plague. For the first time since the Great War, survivors outside of Appalachia have hope: Appalachia offers not only sanctuary from the horrors of the post-war apocalypse, but treasure. Dozens of surviving factions flock to Appalachia to start a new life.
---
That would also square with the timeline and explain why we didn't hear people talking about Scorchbeasts anywhere else. Scorchbeasts would have been isolated to Appalachia for a period of 5-10 years. Any rumors of SBs would have been dismissed as dragon-like fantastical nonsense.
---
Chuck on fireproof, genadier and explosive for more bang. Have the 3 shot gunner perks and like what the others have said, attach a prime receiver.
---
That's interesting, because West Tek's labs only mention 3 creatures - the Snallygaster, the Grafton Monster, and the Super Mutant. The pre-war government and the Enclave also documented several seemingly mythical creatures/Cryptids, and Cryptid hunters also documented a few. None of these groups ever mentioned the Interloper ;)
---
I completely agree with this
---
a terrible thought
---
Why no love for Campfire Tales?
---
Nah you already know.
---
U could make backup saves on ps plus cloud servers possibly
---
Dunno, I'm on Xbox lol. I think we'd need to find something new that was added after the Burrows though.
---
I wouldnt trust bethesda with my saves being safe these days lol
---
Yes that‚Äôd be amazing
---
And fortnights free.
---
What about mixing Exterminators, Hunter's, Troubleshooter's, Ghoul Slayer's, Mutant Slayer's. and Zealots? That's 15 *percent* DR per piece and it stacks. You may not need all of them depending upon what you fight the most, so you can double/triple/etc up on what you do. Having a full set of troubleshooter's for a silo run is easy mode.
---
Having Sentinel's/Cavalier's makes it even better if you don't sneak. Top it off with your favorite minor modifiers and you'll be good to go.
---
Combine that with Blocker and Serendipity and you'll be able to survive very well.
---
I knew I wasnt the only one.
---
Does a person have to click to post to understand what it is that you are trying to say? If so... that‚Äôs clickbait. Give us examples of titles you think are ok and I am sure people here can explain why they are click bait.
---
Don't forget that with the grounded mutation, your gonna get 300 DR from energy weapons. You just can't use an energy weapon.
---
I played NW the first couple weeks of it. It feels like a gutted battle royle. What i mean is, it is far behind bigger battle royles in the gameplay or mechinics
---
But Todd Howard probably is gonna be like fine wish granted but there‚Äôs a 25% decrease in legendaries
---
the best part is putting it at the edge of a floor with no railing 100 feet in the air and watching people fall to their deaths when they get off of it.
---
I'll give you 1250c for a bloodied FFR or bloodied explosive. I guess ill break bank and pay you 2000 caps for a QFFR Tesla. I'm on PC :)
---
Set up a CAMP on one of the many steel ore pits in the Forrest Region and build yourself an extractor. There are 4 such locations around Camp McClintock
---
It‚Äôs the other trials as well (I managed to buy stimpak diffusers from someone‚Äôs vendor and cleared the medic fast)
---
Some are harder than other on certain consoles I think (I have issues taking photos of animals) ((plus I have such a low storage on my refurbished PS4 that taking them is a bitch.))
---
People often forget how much impact a small nice gesture can effect others. Hope things get better in life, and you continue to have good interactions in gaming
---
or maby because we are "the best and brightest" we could fix up one of the abandoned motorcycles and travel like that for a price of uranium
---
You will lose your photos.  Everything else should be ok.
---
This combined all the ideas I've seen posted so far beautifully
---
true true
---
I don‚Äôt usually play with a mic because I like to play while I watch tv but I can help you out if you ever need some ammo or stimpaks
---
My gamertag is anferkneekeeng
---
That's fine just make them more quality and the 3* baddies drop 3* stuff. Then, in my book, you got a deal.
---
Its not fair!
---
Pretty much
---
Colonel Gutsy - doesnt matter which type is OP.
---
All explosives - UP
---
Gauss Rifle - neither, its a novelty that can be OP if used right, or UP if not used right.
---
Charred Ghoul - not OP, not UP.  Just right.
---
Are you on ps4 by chance killa?
---
Woah stop right there Satan
---
Light wood Laminate Light wood Laminate Light wood Laminate!
---
Gotta love the downvotes on this. No explanation but downvote!
---
On the one hand that would be pretty friggin cool on the other it would pretty much break the trading economy in the game and also on the other other hand they would probably nerf explosive laser/plasma weapons into the ground
---
1. Loot is personal
---
2. Fuck everyone else lol
---
Don't know about ps4 but on xbox that is never the case in any game
---
Or at least if u hunt down a officer it gives you a full launch code numbers (one time use).
---
Watch oxhorns video about iguana bits.. will tell you what it actually is
---
I hate how weak missiles and fatmans are in game
---
Ah yeah was it G2A? Or similar site? I've had issues with those sites in the past as well.. I prices are nice but always a risk.. But yes the game is 100x better whole different experience but it's not perfect it still has flaws and yes it still have some game breaking stuff that happens when they fix stuff but they are getting better and better with every update.. They are starting to learn not to rush stuff for the $$ and make sure to jot break stuff so they can keep us happier
---
Pvp is just dumb in general and shouldn't have been added to the game at all
---
The gutsy with a laser ain‚Äôt bad
---
I had a gauss rifle with exploding rounds and a Gatling with a exploding rounds, and the per round hit was way worse with the gauss.
---
