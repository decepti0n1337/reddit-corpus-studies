I can see why some fallout fans don't like it : it is missing some things fallout games usually have like npcs mods and a branching storyline. However I've been enjoying it since launch for the huge map to explore, the fun looting/shooting, and the big community battles. Recently bought it for a friend as thanks for a solid he did me and he likes it too. It is like a different game with friends but I liked playing it solo too.

How could I start it?
---
There are posters in train stations advertising the Sheepsquatch. Click them
---
The actual Sheepsquatch has not yet been sighted, but the Imitation Sheepsquatch (Assaultron) is a devil to kill. Seriously, if you do get the Encryptid! event on your server, be careful. It's heavily dangerous. However, you really should do the new questline and its side quests. Best of luck, investigator. Cheers!

But making it an option would be a nightmare in its entirety because one you die all your junk would be spread out in a giant pile like it‚Äôs Minecraft or something.
---
Cool, thanks‚Äô
---
I‚Äôve timed out (disconnected) several times since the recent patch.  Hope it gets better
---
Great, informative and humorous.  The events are riddled with problems and you've concisely identified them all here.  I hope BGS takes note and makes some changes!
---
Well, lady. You need to work on your reading comprehension. No where did I claim that runes or gems could have suffixes and prefixes. 
---
I said even if both games had the same number of prefixes and suffixes, D2 has a larger drop pool ilbecause of the inclusion of gems, runes, gloves etc. 
---
That doesn't mean ever item listed has prefixes and suffixes. Simply that even with the same number of prefix and suffix possible combos, D2 HAS MORE CATEGORIES of loot. 
---
And your whole thing about "Blah blah, there's like a handful of guaranteed drops" is absolutely moot.
---
You've obviously never  heard the term "The exception that proves the rule"
---
Your exceptions.....which I can count on one hand, which represent a sliver of a percentage of D2 drops,  prove the general rule that there are not guaranteed drops in Diablo.
---
Let me make this easy for you. 
---
"Birds fly".....
---
 "Well, there's a handful of birds that can't, so you're wrong. Birds don't fly"
---
"That's fucking idiocy. The few exceptions do not represent the entirety of the planet's bird population. Birds are characterized as being able to fly because you don't use the exception when making that characterization. That would be fucking dumb."
---
I genuinely hope you don't home school.
---
Who else but Quagmire?
---
üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Same here- PC - takes 2-3 swings to hit now
---
Legitimately think this is awesome and should be implemented right now. 10/10 dood! Love it
---
Gotcha, I'll just keep my eyes peeled for info, then. Likely gonna sell a few things off in the meantime. Thanks!
---
I made far more caps farming the plan with a buddy at an easy 3 plans a day and selling the hats is easier not so much as efficient towards general game/character growth, farming super mutants gets you further, cap drops, good weapons and ammo and far more xp
---
thanks (:
---
As soon as I find more I'll post it up
---
it can be a bit aggravating at times, but over on PC ive seen it happen less often. tried the event 5 times so far, and 4 times it was completed. i would always grab a Pylon and then focus fire on them with my Vampire's .50 cal to draw Aggro, out healing most of the damage (all of i slowly backed up while firing)
---
Yw.
---
YES! Putting paper bags of fertilizer on a CAMP doorstep just isn't cutting it for me anymore. It's still good for a laugh but it's just not the same.
---
Drop the questing part and do easy for your level events good xp, good loot and when you‚Äôre lvl 50 do the quests that rewards you weapons will get you max level gear
---
Man, I really hope it's not battle royale. I'm kind of expecting it to be at this point but I really hope it's not.
---
Looks like it. Wasn't there one in the Mojave too?
---
It would have to be a choice - like if you don't choose, or choose the default it's a bag.  If you want to specifically though, you could drop items in world to decorate.
---
Oh okay lol that would be a better option, I remember being able to decorate in fallout 3/vegas/4 so much fun
---
Yes
---
Vindictive coders who don't see the value of version control giving me bad karma.  Bah humbug to you, too.  This bug was fixed, meaning it should never show up again.  This is why version control is important.
---
Rofl d2 snt the only one with guaranteed drops the MAJORITY of online loot based games have end game bosses that have guaranteed drops. 
---
Keep digging that hole demonstrating your lack of knowledge on how online games work. Just further proves how little you know, and shows how easily your opinions based on ignorance can be ignored.
---
Sounds like you need parental locks on the store
---
You absolutely can. Maybe the friendly target fix will fix it, but I don't know gmhow many times I've one shot my own damn turret, when it auto target it, instead of the SB hovering behind it.
---
Hmm. Seems it was just bugging out, it is fixed now. I did not drop it, just so you know. That is how you lose your power armour.
---
Yes do this, I didn‚Äôt and now I‚Äôm stuck leveling slow as hell at lvl 58 :/
---
Yes :)
---
Most frustrating event like you one out 10 that‚Äôs 9 fails due to others
---
Same thing happened to me. At one point I had to be the conduit for all 3 pylons because no one was doing it. Spoiler Alert: we failed.
---
Hahaha, but "at least it's not raining!"  (Omg, what I wouldn't give to have Preston, or ANY NPC, by my side again üò≠).
---
I consistently was for all 3 until I ran out of stimpaks. Then I continued and took the 30sec respawn. Just wish we coulda got it.
---
For you, you should get 1000 steel 800 aluminum a group of players, then go to the ammo factory and spawn the vertibird kill it and repeat
---
What mutations would it run? The mutations box is empty on that nukes &amp; dragons page for me
---
honestly i feel like im defusing a bomb, but instead of the penalty being an explosion its me blowing my goddamned brains out with a TSE lever action rifle

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*

No unfortunately not

Didn‚Äôt know that, I guess on Tuesday?

Pretty sure :/

Damn, hooking it up to a pressure plate would be epic
---
Defusing a bomb is damn right. I‚Äôve been working on getting stairs to snap to floors the right way... still haven‚Äôt found out the trick.
---
Shitty, I love the new sheepsquatch event for xp, I just focus on all the adds from the roof go up an easy half level each time I do it
---
Not currently enabled. The flag is turned off and the event it's supposed to pop up at is also disabled atm
---
Make this a thing
---
It's still counterintuitive. Tab should never be used as a confirm button. I'm working on a pc mod that makes this be tab for back and e for confirm which will still stop space spamming
---
Notice how no one agrees with you and you are getting downvoted.

Someone give this man a nukashine

Figured their style as mad max raiders made them kinda obvious.

Mine actually disappeared during play and has yet to come back.
---
So you've bought a tattoo, the excavator skin, and wild man rags all on accident?
---
It sounds like you need a parental control lock on the store.
---
I think someone crafted and scrapped hundreds, maybe more than 1000, to get all the mods. There was a thread about it some months back.
---
Is English your 3rd or 4th language?
---
Yeah I also wanted 2K caps on this BS
---
The odds of getting an outfit even out of that many runs is going to skew a lot based on where you're doing the events.  For example you're going to end up getting a whole lot less out of doing a lot of Mire/Free State events since their drop rate is 0.02%, meanwhile Savage Divide events may have a 0.25% chance but if you hit that roll you get ALL of the drops.
---
That seems like a harsh response and a seemingly unnecessary jump to conclusions.  
---
Plus there doesn‚Äôt need to be such reactions to an innocent thought.  
---
Personally I feel that PA is way underpowered at the moment and it would be nice to have the option for us PA users to play with the legendary items a little too.
---
Besides, how many stories have you run into about a near immortal player in PA.......  just think about it before you blow your top.
---
What about QE?
---
This is cool
---
They are in toxic valley vendors and quest rewards as well as Watoga station vendor and grahm. They are part of a list that is very rare to pop up
---
F.
---
Here there be spoilers. Read on at ye risk:
---
The assaultron imposter sheepsquatch is the end of the Lying Lowe questine. That might be a bit unsatisfying, but I believe Beth is keeping their powder dry on adding a new cryptid into the game.
---
Now, we know there are gamefiles that features a deathclaw sized sheepsquatch cryptid, so he's in there somewhere. We also know that there's new dungeons (burrows) coming out next week and the ever upwards pioneer scout quest that's coming out next month. But I would not be surprised if there was another hint in the burrows quest with the Sheepsquatch making his formal appearance at the end of the pioneer scouts quest. (One of the conspiracy theory board pins points to a field behind Camps Adams -- the pioneer scouts campground. It makes sense we would 'camp' out there and then after out robot scoutmasters tells a monotonous scary story about the sheepsquatch BOOM, there he is.)
---
A full set can be installed to a frame which reduces the weight to 10 lbs. I had 8 full sets in my stash until recently.
---
honestly in all my time building camps, the shit with the stair placement eludes me; i have little to no idea how it works, and leads me to believe that the camp building system was made by monkeys
---
Is anyone on here that is truly against the legendary Power Armor pieces an avid power armor user?  
---
I mean someone who almost solely uses Power Armor in pretty much every scenario?
---
I smash buttons
---
They are very very low chance of about 5% per rifle to learn
---
So ... This is the same as when they made the Bobby pins heavy again ?
---
That's weird in my experience exeryone stops whatever they are doing, desposits junk in their S.T.A.S.H. and fast travels to the location.
---
Hah! Pretty sure that was me. Was the gamer tag FancyBulb and then a bunch of numbers?
---
Monkeys everywhere are offended that you believe they would design something so cumbersome and clunky.
---
I see your Albino Deathclaw and raise you a Scorchbeast Queen.
---
I'm pretty sure the calibrated shocks carry weight boost on the excavator doesn't even work half the time either, It keeps canceling out. I sometimes spend ages relogging into the game trying to get my capacity boost back.
---
A QE will still have that tight pellet grouping but won‚Äôt be nearly as effective as an AA when it comes to super mutants as they have very high armor at higher levels. A QE would shine on targets such as ghouls and scorch because they have little armor to begin with.
---
Glad you think so. Cheers!
---
I would still make it limiting though, otherwise it makes it pointless and should just have all perks unlocked. 
---
I think they should have a 2nd class slot. Same special points, but different perks selected. Then press up on dpad to quickly switch between perk class. Limiting them to what you can select die to what special stats you have still makes it not useless. 
---
It should be unlock for lvl 50+ and included with the prestiged.
---
I've had a problem where I get stuck if I use an emoticon. Happened two or three times. So now people will think I'm rude. Every time I use emoticons I have to restart and rejoin my team. It caused me to miss looting the imitation sheepsquatch the other day.
---
Location, location, location! My bar is right next to the Whitespring station and it's almost become a trading post.
---
To be fair one doesn't really need to read your post to get the gist of it. It's been brought up numerous times how ridiculous some of the challenges are.
---
Oh definitely for sure, I don't doubt it. 
---
I imagine if they hadn't borked the Fasnacht drops, I'd have gotten a couple of the rare masks. As prevailing theory is that any time you got 0 mask drops even if all 5 bots were alive, was a time you would have gotten the rare masks. And that occurred commonly enough that I noticed it.
---
Only if it just completed an event while drunk.
---
Isn't this pvp event? Went there once and thought I have to kill other players for candy or something?
---
No. Not preston.
---
Alone on the server? How odd. You do not usually see that. Well, better luck next time. Perhaps get some friends into a team to fight it? Cheers!
---
It's sacrifial blade mod. Cultist blade is a weapon
---
Could be worse... could've had this guy literally standing over me starring at me for a full 10 seconds waiting for me to die  so he could grab my junk... pun not intended... luckily someone came up and revived me.
---
What I vaguely mentioned still is being neglected
---
I agree. I've never farmed a plan. I farm Blackwater mine and the like for the mole miners. Xp, shotgun shells galore, weapons, and glowing meat. Glowing meat steak is 10 caps each. Most weapons are 20-30 caps. Plus all the junk...
---
It's going to be like other atom shop items. It's already in the data files and will be craftable
---
Its for raider power. Not excavator. So no yellow?
---
I do the mine, harped ferry and the big/watoga easily hit my 1400 caps with guns to scrap
---
U might want to check your description again it's for excavator
---
Yep. Finesse it. Finesse itttt...and it's fkn jumped. Ty Bethesda. Lol
---
Good stuff here. (Though there is a server wide alert. My squad and I usually take the time to stash junk and get into power armor before we FT to the event.)
---
I think it‚Äôs just the yellow rusted look, but I could be wrong. The few players I‚Äôve come across wearing it have the standard rusty excavator armour yellow on them.
---
It is the worst to trade with ppl who don't use mics,  I may make a rule saying no mic no trade
---
Huge multiple item transfers? Dupe much?
---
this comment is proof that gamers are the most oppressed minority
---
Ok, I gotta know.. how does one do that?
---
20hrs to game reset from last visit
---
I'd like a comforter like the one in the atom shop!
---
Have you done Watoga lately? Multiple posts report zero legendarys.
---
I was more referring to price range
---
Can anyone explain where to find both watoga vendors? I didn't know there is one, turns out there are 2??
---
Where do u find these drops?
---
That explains what happened to me last night.  Didn‚Äôt realize it was a bug previously.

Tuesday post patch I found 3 legendary bots, but the usual legendary scorched in the civic centre has been absent, however west tek I ran twice yesterday had about 10 legendary with shitty rng
---
We're still hunting for Bigfoot, loch Ness monster, chupacabra, etc irl. This sheepsquatch quest is all in alignment with typical cryptid hunting.
---
These are dummy placeholders. You'll see that in a lot of places before things are fleshed out
---
O no I‚Äôd ballpark AAE at double a QE price change. I don‚Äôt pvp so unless there‚Äôs some secret pvp use for em the pve use just isn‚Äôt as sought after
---
Hey that's me!
---
I'm getting constantly disconnected lately or the game just freezes. My one attempt at the new event and it disconnected me as soon as it started. You think they would fix this issue before adding new events. F'ing amateur hour at Bethesda.

I think all those damn gutseys are a little excessive, but the main part is fun

Maybe detonating a nuke could cause a region-wide rad storm for a few minutes. Like if a nuke hits fissure site prime, then all of cranberry bog would go into the radstorm state for 15 minutes or so (same goes for all the other regions if a nuke goes off within their borders). This would make the nukes a little more dangerous and make the surrounding area feel a little more hostile. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- or, on the flip side, maybe for the LAST 15 minutes and some time after the nuke event will the region be covered in radstorms, as if it‚Äôs some sort of delayed fallout falling from the sky
---
It's been so bad that I deleted the game and I am reinstalling it and patch to see of that does anything at the moment.

Gee. Why didnt i think of that

Really not sure, honestly. Reddit was a weird choice.

Ps4 will be more expensive than pc though, ebay is your best bet or wait for a sale.

I don't trade with people who don't have mic's unless we arranged it ahead of time on the trade sub. I'm not going to try to haggle over the xbox messaging system.

It launches them straight into the sky.....

Not to mention all the aid items and alcohol I pick up. Never had a problem finding something to sell
---
Thanks! I ran the golf club twice today. Everything was vendor fodder, but I did get a lot of weapons instead of armor.

I would say don‚Äôt look for a perfect place but look for a unique place, try the northwest or the southwest

I got 30 Harden Mass psn Merlance

No if i duped I wouldn‚Äôt be having this problem

Everyones been saying this since the Beta I really hope they fix the trading system.
---
Hahaha that's as useful as a Nuka World squirt gun!
---
A lot of people choose a spot by a resource deposit. Or a spot by water. Or a spot that's close to a particular location.
---
So there is no "BEST" spot, it really depends on what you're looking for.
---
And if there were a "BEST" spot, you can bet that you'd have the same spawn problem that you're having now.
---
I got one
---
You guys still on?  I have a level 15 1star bloodied handmade for him.
---
Look up the map of resource deposits and pick one at a unique location.
---
My experience as well... got a lot of fluorescent flux to make more recall cards but really don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Just as with every other thing is this game there are counters for VATS. The chameleon armor and stealth boys are the obvious ones, but if you sneak you can drastically decrease the distance from which you can be vatsed. Also, the high level PvP is all about map control and team cooperation. At certain distances VATS doesnt work at all. If you have a nonvats sniper placed strategically, and you deny access to him with rest of the team, you can prevent vatsers access to action. I just had an over hour long battle with a PvP group. 4v4 for most of the time. For sure I scored many dozens of kills, but I also died many times and from different tools. I think I was able to use VATS for less than half of that period, rest kills were done by hand. If you allow your opponents close enough to VATS you, you were exposed and played it imperfectly.
---
The one caveat to this argument, that its a minor cost, is in the form of expensive constructs like the decontamination shower.  Things expensive to repair. That said, That's what triggered my first selfish base blast. Dude had a shower set up at his camp in the middle of the room, and i didn't have starched genes yet, lost my marsupial and i was pissed! Leveled the place then went to whitespring to get rid of my bounty
---
Bethesda needs to hurry up and listen
---
The power station east of Watoga has a junk pile and a deathclaw 
---
It was a nice location to run ops out of, plus the added junk, xp and black T was a great bonus.
---
I tried Warframe, thought it was cool.
---
Realized early on that no way in Hell was I willing to let myself get sucked into a Pay To Cheat PC game.
---
I won't even call it "Win" if you paid instead of played to get where you are, it's simply not winning anymore, at that point.
---
Also, **Warframe was up front about being PTW from the start, right?  Well, with this game they promised NOT to sell any "non-cosmetic" items before we bought it!!!**
---
Not believing anything.  Verifying.
---
The "prime time" for this event is dying extremely fast
---
As someone whose been grinding it since release and finally got everything needed (except the fixer plan) I can directly attest that in the beginning, you were absolutely correct. The ENTIRE server hopped over to help
---
In the last day or so that number has dropped by at least half, there's an average of about 5-10 now (Xbox) and I literally had 2 people show up to one yesterday. *2*
---
LFG posts about it are dying off extremely fast and the rate of success (in my experience) is significantly dropping as well
---
If you're dying for something from this event I highly recommend doing it relatively soon because by next week I don't see enough people coming through for successful runs (unless a premade team obviously)
---
Bethesda Softworks isn't Bethesda Game Studios, theres a degree of seperation there.  And an MMO like ESO is very different from what Fallout 76 is/was trying to be.

Exactly right, it harms society.

It sucks, period.

Yeah it sucks. I wanna calibrate the shocks on my sick new bone raider excavator  suit but for now I just have to settle for +100 carry weight instead of 200. I NEED TO CARRY MORE, DAMN YOU,  MOOOORE!
---
That is a legit complaint!
---
So, here, I will at least start to address it:
---
Please read this other users post, he explains very well:

It depends on what you want to use your camp for imo. You can post up by resource deposits, or be like me and look for the nicest scenery possible to build a "home". I have mine on a waterfall
---
No offense to you, but I believe that people that don't know the goods and bads if given feature are not exactly in the best position to suggest their removal. From all these "plz nerf" posts your is characterised by very kind behaviour, I respect that.
---
No, those are punching attacks, so they are under Iron Fist. But also Martial Artist, Incisor, and Talons mutation.
---
This. I just do a few runs through Harpers and West Tek, sell everything that isn't nailed down.
---
It never left.
---
I'll be on, promise you don't give it away though. In my group my nickname is The Realtor
---
 Plastic forks are already in the game. Let me fork some lawns!
---
Ok, so I also accidentally bought the cowboy hat too, but that was good one. My char wears it all time time.
---
Ok, add me. BreakingTexas77
---
I think the vendor stashes don't change anymore. It's been the exact same stuff listed sinve the update. At least for me. Server hopping doesn't change nor does a   full 24hrs.
---
Oh for sure! I wasn‚Äôt trying to make those arguments and I don‚Äôt doubt that sniper builds contribute quite a bit. I just thought it would be cool if we could see how big our impact truly is like in other MMOs. Like a screen that shows a ranking for kills and other stats at the end of the event. 
---
This last event I did, there were 10-15 ppl going straight for the boss non-stop while the conduits sat untriggered and the adds piled up...üòë
---
I second that emotion. üéµ
---
This is how half my Cryptid events are. And the boss dies before its even loaded inn. GG
---
I think they do it on purpose though. But it‚Äôs nice to know I‚Äôm not the only one who does that. It really does feel you press x (PS4) to enlarge the picture. If it makes you feel better I accidentally bought the raider excavator paint job today doing the same thing. At least though I was considering it but wasn‚Äôt sure I didn‚Äôt want to save my atoms for other things.
---
I just googled. Seemed that guy was right. First result showed me a list of options and prices. 
---
Just looking at the prices I might actually sell my physical copy and buy it digital.
---
Can you send me a link to what you see? Because google is only showing me physicals or 60 dollar digital
---
Unfortunately asking for suggestions probably isn‚Äôt the best way to go about it, because then at least one other person knows about it- and that just increases the chances that it‚Äôll be harder to find a server where that spot isn‚Äôt taken.
---
But he was a good shot...
---
Yeah it sucks. Trying to join events is the worst. Finding a friend request...good luck...lol

Instigating is just first shot and when they‚Äôre at full hp. If they lose even 1hp point you wont get the damage increase. Bloodied damage effect is there regardless of the enemy‚Äôs health and boils down to managing being at a low hp but dealing double damage.

You've got a big beautiful feast - about to enjoy it with your friends when someone comes and takes a big shit in the middle of the table.
---
Then they say: "Now available, what our users have been asking for: The Shit Cleaner 2000" - for just $29.95 additional (limited time sale price) you can have a shit free dinner!!!
---
Maybe to you this "shit" is just one little rat poop, and you can brush it aside and just eat the foods that weren't touched?
---
To some of us, it's a big dark ominous thing over our heads - we don't want to see this thing that we view as horrible and Evil become ubiquitous, to be the new norm, and to have people tell us: *"dude, chill, what's the big deal, everybody does it!"* - no no no, that's a ***nightmare*** scenario!!!
---
Yeah, I was also kinda waiting on getting a few things trying to save up the Atoms but at this rate it's not gonna happen so I looked at how much Atoms are to buy. I thought, I have gotten alot of enjoyment out of this game. Holy cow they are expensive. I could go buy the game again for a friend instead of buying Atoms. I'll just be more careful.
---
There is no point for more than one chameleon. If you want PvE enemies to ignore you, its better to have escape artist perk, as well as 'harder to detect while sneaking' armor. I have been testing it against monsters and with 3 such pieces and sneak perk I can circle monsters right before their faces and they ignore me completely.  Suppose I go into a location where there are 8 monsters. 8 bullets and 8 "sneak attack for 2.5 damage" notifications later they are dead, none the wiser of my presence until its over. Spend remaining 4 prefix mod on something else.
---
Mods are broken at the moment. Go figure.
---
It‚Äôs bugged atm
---
Can I ask what you are googling?
---
A good tip to help with levelling is to use a melee weapon only. High damage and you can stockpile ammo, then find yourself a power armour frame and go farm events
---
Also the first thing I do when making a new alt is always buy the baseball bat plan. Very cheap to produce so you can mass scrap them for mods. This weapon will easily carry you through the early levels.

Rarely I'll find someone who pronounces it the same way and we normally hit it off well.
---
I saw 3 links on page 1 which lead to where you buy the cheap copy.
---
Alright sounds easy enough thanks for taking the time to help me
---
No, please read this user's eloquent post on the subject:
---
Luckily I‚Äôm doing a STR heavy weapons tank build, which can‚Äôt be done till lvl 50 anyway, so right now I‚Äôm deciding between shotgun and melee. Not a fan of melee, love shotguns, but may go melee just, like you said, to stockpile ammo and lead till lvl 50.
---
I would love this , it sucks having to switch from fast travel perks to my attack perks and getting attacked by adds during sbq
---
Its known. The radium rifle is the hardest weapon in game to learn mods for. I have spent around 15k and know half the mods. It's not unusual to break down 10 rifles to learn 1 mod or none.
---
Did you tell Sarge?
---
This is one of the weirder posts I‚Äôve read
---
That is genius, love the care and skill approach vs spray n pray. If BGS ever considers it I hope they design work arounds for those with disabilities. I don‚Äôt have those challenges but have read the posts, it ain‚Äôt pretty.
---
They screwed up by not making it basically peer-to-peer, private Servers on your own PCs, etc. 
---
But regardless, please read this:
---
Have noticed there has been a plan for this for sale at various vendors, and it doesn't show as know for the plan though I definitely know how to craft the SAH. Anyone know if this also "unlocks" the mod?
---
Just bought some weird outfit yesterday by dropping the controller... don't even know how much it was...
---
It's weapons and probably armors too. I think they know but surely it'll take some time to fix. Probably due to the repair kits they're wanting us to buy.
---
While what your saying may be true for normal circumstances... when I‚Äôm being attacked by two scorchbeasts waving my hands around for help is meaningless.
---
I try to invite high level players to my team but always get declined. Sucks that there isn‚Äôt a good mechanism to help fellow wastelanders when they are in dire need of support
---
&gt;If you could do everything in power armor people wouldn't ever get out of it.
---
If they gave people armor they'll use less stimpacks
---
If they give players bottled water they wont drink for the rivers and faucets.
---
If we give players NPC's they'll shoot them in the face...  oh wait
---
How about this.  In the middle of the 10 years it takes to kill the bullet sponge queen you cant get out of your armor to repair anything because the radiation kills you.  The only option is to teleport out of the event to a bench nearby fix your stuff then run back because you cant teleport into a nuke zone and hope the queen isn't killed in the mean time  Or you just stand around and let everyone else take care of it while you take the occasional pot shot.    Bethesda logic ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
It‚Äôs for excavator man
---
You must have joined an area that was an active warzone. These are not always obvious at first glance. You were instantkilled because the player properly aligned his build with his items. You don't need anything better than 1* items to reach these outputs so it doesn't necessarily mean they had to have an uber weapon. The guy didn't appear on leaderboards because other people who knew what they were doing killed him. Thats the most probable case when looking at this from perspective of one of those who instakill the instakillers while being instakilled themselves, if the enemy is godlike in their playstyle.
---
You can farm it without players
---
Where's the response?
---
Glad you liked it, thank you. The follow up will be War and Peace, The Reboot Manga.
---
I met grief
---
If bethesda had stuck with cosmetic only stuff in the atom store I wouldn‚Äôt mind buying a few supplemental atoms here and there but since they are heart set on introducing stuff that they will be balancing the game in the future to make it feel like work just to play it (not even if you want to earn the atoms) I won‚Äôt spend a dime. 
---
And honestly I would have preferred Bethesda do something like the devs of elite dangerous do, instead of letting you earn atoms in game to get cosmetics, make them reasonably priced (a few dollars per item) and  if you want these customizations you have to pay real money period. Then the game would feel less manipulative about how you earn atoms and how frustrating it can get so you just pay to get the stuff. Just be up front and make us pay. But they wouldn‚Äôt trick whales into spending as much that way.
---
Specific items drop from specific area events which is what makes data like this not as useful. Going for every event doesn't give you a higher chance to get them it jsut means you spend more time at events that may not have what you're looking for
---
Can't tell if troll or dumb.
---
Oh man, see..this a perfect example of why we need a confirmation before a sale.
---
Me neither
---
Didn't you know.
---
If you place a mortar at your camp and have cloth in a stash box next to the back of it it will shoot cloth rolls at the target location and it doesn't deal damage.
---
Pretty sure it doesn‚Äôt work on players either. Oops
---
Supposedly the vending machine will be in your camp. Once it's powered up it will show your camp location on the map. There hasn't been any details on how exactly the machines work. I'm guessing it will be just like a vendor bots inventory. Also it hasn't been said but I think the machine will be linked to your inventory similar to the way the fermenter works.
---
Good luck my game (PC) still crashes if I drink purified water too fast.  Make sense of that.
---
Didn‚Äôt know that :0. I‚Äôll googly the drop rate and loc info, thanks.
---
apply the Barbed mod to the Walking Cane and u can solo it
---
They should have made them passive abilities that unlock at certain levels of special.
---
I was just going to post this. If I remember right it was an insane amount of rifles he scrapped.
---
Actually I‚Äôm glad the deathclaw is small. I love deathclaws but I just don‚Äôt see a large statue fitting the aesthetic of my camp.
---
Nah, your connections about what you usually watch is what i sucks
---
Let me guess, the meteoric sword?
---
I'm just glad I still had enough for the tribal excavator skin.
---
Definitely took some of the joy out of my shopping experience though...(hint hint, wink wink, looking at you my mtx overlords)
---
If someone is killed do they get removed from the leaderboard? Is it just the highest killstreak not highest total kills?
---
Well damnit, I wish I had bought this instead of the excavator armor paint. Cheaper too.
---
I think the Atoms are over priced. I have spent extra on in game purchases before but as it is I won't. My super clicky ass will just have to wait. lol
---
God damn right mother fucker
---
In my experiences yesterday on PS4 7-10 people are there before I even move the cursor to fast travel over. The bomb bots and conduits dying too fast can add to the frustration but even when you lose it's wrirdly kind of fun. Harder than Scorchbeast Queen but maybe the difficultly increases the more who show up. I had one with 15 or 20 people there.
---
The Mothman shall embrace you, br√∂ther!
---
Check out the lighthouse event, ‚Äúpath to enlightenment‚Äù
---
I used to have an open camp but only took two griefers to damage it and now it‚Äôs like Fort Knox.
---
This sounds like a great alternative too
---
It's kills per current life. If you get killed it resets.
---
One drill and two wood legs so far, the sheepsquatch is the Insult Boss.
---
I'm on now if you still want the minigun
---
It's called caps. Put a cap value on your item instead of 0.
---
Good news is I captured the region and start loc info. Bad news is I didn‚Äôt think it was that relevant. Ultimately this was about any outfit vs a specific one, despite my wanting the BOS jumpsuit. I‚Äôll refine my Google fu, but if you‚Äôve got specific info please share. And thank you for the input, appreciate it.
---
Ok, you made me go look. I managed to not buy anything with my remaining 90 Atoms too. What tribal excavator skin?
---
Well then maybe bethesda can see how much it is annoying players.
---
I agree with the need for better testing by Bethesda.  Better Unit testing, QA, and a public test server would go a LONG way toward improving quality in Fallout 76. 
---
But do you truly think that a fix (even what appears to be a simple one) to any complex online game used by thousands of players simultaneously only takes a few mins to get through dev, test, implementation, and validation?  Think again.   
---
And yes, it‚Äôs true. 
---
Me:   IT manager of  a development team at a Fortune 500 company.
---
When your max caps and only want to do trades like a 1 for 1 you don‚Äôt really value caps plus you don‚Äôt wanna just eat caps
---
Ok.
---
Had this earlier. Not only was I conduit for all 3 pylons but also the guy that brough a cryolator. So, with an uncloacked, frozen sheepbot, for once all everyone had to do was shoot the damned thing. Still failed lol.
---
When I get home I'll pull up info on all the rarer outfits and let you know. Is there a list somewhere of which ones are rare?
---
Why don't people play the events more.  We put so much minimal effort into them - Bethesda Probably
---
Buy stuff with caps first then. Problem solved.
---
Is it the Sheepsquach Imposter outfit?
---
Crap sorry, i think it might actually be called raider excavator, but it makes me think tribal. Has a bunch of bones all over it. The face looks pretty awesome tbh.
---
If I remember right it was only on sale for like 3 or 4 days. Last night was the last one.
---
I'd be down
---
Hot fix is causing blue screens like crazy for me on Ps4. Long load screens as well.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôd buy them to supplement if bethesda hadn‚Äôt put me on no dime from me on principle mode. Meaning if I just needed a few dollars more worth to get something I‚Äôd consider it. But back when they introduced a one day only blackbird paint for power armor I would have needed to buy most the caps. And when that would have cost me 20 bux I just decided I could go without cause not paying the price of a full used game on one paint job. They at least reduced it but 10 dollars is still too much.
---
I demand TP grenades that cover it in mummy wrappings.
---
I'm on x1x and I got frozen or disconnected 4 times today in 2 hours.  Something is definitely off. Then again sometimes I get on a server that runs smoothly for hours...
---
400+ DR/ER and nearly complete radiation mitigation is underpowered? Gtfoh.
---
I wasn't blowing my top, the last part was a bit of sarcasm but the overall sentiment stands.
---
I would sooo use those..
---
Cultist blade is a random mod location spawn. 
---
Scorched Killer receiver you learn by doing he fire breathers quests.
---
A Mafia?
---
I‚Äôm starting a new character right now just to get it going! My gamer tag is the same as my name on here
---
Yeah that's the Bone Raider skin I bought. It does look kinda tribal. It's better than just the yellow for sure.
---
Ok let‚Äôs say we had a trade for a gun for gun I put my thing up at 10k and you put yours up for 10k then you just take my gun sure I get 10k but I could have been max caps already or that the value of the gun you took is worth more than caps and in the trading world caps don‚Äôt mean much anymore it‚Äôs item for item
---
We are STILL WAITING for our "event timers" so we dont waste 40 caps travelling across the map for Dane's that has 25 seconds left...
---
All the free loot!
---
Well now that you put it that way... yes haha
---
Alright, I'll make a new character as well
---
Weird I thought I did the fire breather quests. Don't remember learning that....
---
Aight.
---
How did u lose everything
---
I‚Äôll give you better example say you had a full set of heavy combat assassin sentinel and I had a vamp explosive laser rifle and a quad explosive laser rifle both are worth more than 25k no one is gonna put a cap value on a bulk trade like that because it‚Äôs just ridiculous
---
Everything is lol, the garahm mining was a nice color set too. Since excavator PA is basically my vehicle for fast traveling I don't feel guilty pimping it out. 3 base strength but 450ish carry ftw
---
You get it when you get the Scorched Killer weapon from completing the quest.
---
Was it your base? Were you in survival or adventure? Why not just block and report them to both Bethesda and Microsoft and go get whatever it is you need to fix or make new stuff?
---
Yes, Sorry for slow response.
---
I got confetti floor decoration plans from the fastnacht event. It was a relatively common reward I think; check, you may have it. You can use the camp build function in any teammates' camp. So A+B=Confetti
---
I think you should set the slider to the max in order to completely turn it off.
---
No worries
---
It‚Äôs your treat and you want it now!
---
Lol. Didn‚Äôt know you could do that
---
Yeah, it'ed be nice if the "no griefing in adventure" improvements would roll around.
---
if the scenario is what I think it is, sounds like yet another case of very poor coding on their part.  Integer overflow without bounds checking or something to that effect.  Sigh.   This is the kind of thing that warrants an official bug report on their web site if you haven‚Äôt already.
---
No that just makes the depth of field on at all times which I absolutely don't want
---
I also have calibrated shocks on mine and  motion asissted torso. I carry it with me all the time in case I get over encumbered in my x01
---
I‚Äôve never been robbed or scammed nothing of the sorts 800+ hours in the game
---
Buy their gun first. Or use a middle man. Or have a friend nearby to hold excess caps during the trade.
---
Bethesda is trying to tell people: no item is worth more than 25k caps.
---
I hope they don't "fix" trading. People should use them. It is the in game currency.
---
Because of a lack of reply, I have decided to implement it, and I will add your name to it of course! Ask me to make changes to your idea if you want, I don't mind.
---
Yeah i should be on,an hour or 2
---
Try tweaking with your .ini files. There should be some tutorials online for dealing with DOF.
---
Just did sbq again, got two one star.
---
all of my soldier masks now have a condition.
---
I died three times last week from dying, getting into a downed state near my friend only to blow up from my own grenade. 90% of the time it will do nothing, 9% of the time it will kill you when you had a chance to be revived and 1% of the time it might do damage to an unsuspecting player. I even had the mysterious savior show up and stimpak me only for me to immediately blow up. 
---
My bad forgetting that card on when it's not appropriate but atm its such a hassle to equip it just when the situation is right that you might as well just throw a grenade instead.  
---
Something that is quite fun though is using it with an orbital strike, it's a bit delayed so most palyers don't see it coming. Rarely gets a kill but it's a fun surprise, haha.
---
It's radioactive poison mist
---
so just go to your camp and choose repair all.
---
The defense quest at berkley springs commonly spawns angler waves too
---
reporting someone for playing the game as intended is a gross misuse of the reporting system and wont do anything but waste your, and others, time.
---
Joining your world now!
---
I think that‚Äôs a very valid opinion. Paid power-ups suck regardless of which way you look at it. I am one of those players who enjoys grinding and killing mobs to get the resources I need. Although annoying, I also in a weird way appreciate the moments when my goddamn excavator armour breaks and I‚Äôm stuck in the middle of nowhere with way too much loot; it‚Äôs all part of the immersion aspect and I fully agree that these types of upgrades can take that away.
---
The comment mentioned that atoms are really easy to come by; I think that‚Äôs where Bethesda messed up. I don‚Äôt even actively seek them out and I have more than I have use for. In my opinion they should have been cash-only from the beginning. While that would suck in the short term, in the long term it would have avoided issues like these where they have to add consumable and questionable items to the store to bring in enough money to both maintain the game and generate profit. Perhaps I sounded a bit too optimistic in my original comment - of course I don‚Äôt like the addition of these consumables, I was just trying to explain that Bethesda has dug themselves a financial hole and there is no single way out which wouldn‚Äôt cause a ton of backlash.
---
Anywho thanks for sharing! It‚Äôs always nice to read some properly thought out perspectives on controversial topics like this, rather than the ‚ÄúgIvE uS fReE sTuFf‚Äù mob mentality which seems to form rather quickly.
---
Also dies the barrel change which perks work.
---
Lesssssssgoooo
---
I got it and it is the yellow underneath, it does seem to be more shadowed with the extra bone pieces on though and is only really noticeably yellow on the upper legs section and back section.
---
Depends on if it was survival or not. If it was, then you're totally right, but if someone was just following him around in Adventure mode destroying his stuff, that would be griefing.
---
Honestly this should have never been able to get passed qa. It literally takes 2 seconds running the game as if you were playing to notice the bug. Hell the programmer should have noticed it themselves.
---
Yes, the description is not clear
---
Done a lot of trading the growing blacklist of traders redit names and gt/pan/pc names have been through the roof and ppl making ult accounts just wait till someone saids they‚Äôll trade you like a bloodied explosive faster reload handmade for your unyielding cav left arm and right arm then you put both your arms at 0 they take them then leave I‚Äôm not the only one to experience this thousands have been reported because they‚Äôre is no safe way to trade it‚Äôs just putting faith into the other player they won‚Äôt take your stuff
---
Agreed.
---
As a shotgun main, please come fork my lawn.  Please.  It would be the greatest thing ever.
---
So you wouldn‚Äôt value a full set of vanguard sentinel ap refresh heavy combat armor past 25k? Then you haven‚Äôt been in the trading world think of how long it takes to grind the perfect legendary not to mention a set of armor also if I buy then gun first that basically means they‚Äôre putting their trust in me not to scam them it‚Äôs the same way all around no matter the way you slice it traders that enjoy trading goods for goods instead of caps want to see a change for the better not for the worse making trading safer and more efficient
---
Thank you for the math. I definitely never maxed out END on any character. Even at 9-10 with Vaccinated 3 I would still get random diseases every game session. It didn't matter that the chance to get a disease was like 3%-4% when I was melee, since every 5-10 minutes of playing I would get one anyone.
---
That combined with how many hoops they make you jump through just to keep/stock any kind of disease cure made me quit the game. It was just too much micromanaging nonsense.
---
Sounds good, my gamertag is Randy H0rton
---
Im on now! Psn?
---
Does it need to craft 50 whiskeys first?

---
As much as I love my Mothman Pop, I scratch myself on his antennae every time I try to hug him. So yes.
---
I don't truly think its possible to do a quick fix after hours to any online game. It was a lame mid day random thought on my part. As a test engineer (Fortune 500 company as well) we go through validations that includes many groups before release. One great thing Beth has is the community support good and bad to make the game better. It's unfortunate the bugs that happen after the patches but we live with it until it's fixed. Thanks for your comment :)
---
It doesn't blue screen for me but that sucks. And load times are normal
---
Noscope_420bird
---
I was/am.
---
I wouldn't value each piece over 25k. The set maybe. Then your biggest problem becomes not selling more than 1 piece at a time. You'd take turns or again hand off caps.
---
Damn that sucks man, I‚Äôve done trades with some good gear, but hasn‚Äôt happened to me, one day would you every consider publicly sharing the list? I see you trading all the time on here all the time, you could help someone else being robbed
---
I got mine from EB Games (the Australian arm of GameStop).
---
All I‚Äôm asking is hopefully bethesda makes a more safer easier way to trade I think that‚Äôs fair to ask
---
It never changed. Immediately after the patch that fixed it, I got a drill.
---
That last one (the red one) looks like something that was inspired by Skyrim
---
Supposed lunch theres a vault up there that hasn't been completed added yet, got a vault door and everything.
---
Hopefully the legendary vendor works well and the inflated prices for perfect rolls comes way down.
---
Yeah, imo it just looks like it's a lot of religious beliefs. I really only like him as a content creator, and hence why I don't watch his live streams. Although a couple things one guy did say was that he should be shamed for smoking in front of 'small children.' Last time I checked Fallout was rated at least for teens. Then again, I'd assume most of his audience was older people.
---
how is the PC community activity??
---
GT: Player23man
---
I guess I was lucky all this time, this is the first time since that patch it‚Äôs happened to me
---
Seems great! Especially for the BoS Elites. I'm more of a lone agent myself.  Enclave want me to protect and start up their bots? Sure, i'll do that. Just to go and kill them afterwards.
---
Pretty sure they‚Äôre already adding a fridge
---
Dude... It's tomorrow!
---
Well if any case with the addition of the player vending system they‚Äôll add improvements to the overall trading system
---
Sureeee
---
I have mine set on a pond northwest of Silo Alpha, IIRC. Lots of purified water for me to sell, though you'll have enemies coming from all sides there.
---
Awesome, thanks :)  never found a list of rares with drop rates. Means little, tbh the effort I put into searching was minimal.
---
Price for Bos combat legs?
---
Adventure
---
I like the compromise, being able to teleport people unwillingly would be fun but being teleported wouldn‚Äôt be.
---
Thanks man!
---
+karma
---
If you will split up the BOS plans, ill do 2.5k each on the arms and legs
---
No problem
---
Did they talk or anything and if they did then those were Raiders. If they didn't talk or have any character at all (Character as in Raider or team like) then they were griefers then.
---
Oh snap, not sure how I missed that. Thanks, I look forward to seeing it then!
---
So now you're just making things up to help yourself not look dumb? Great idea.
---
This is important too. If they were RPing as raiders, that's legit too
---
The winner gets the buy-ins as part of the prize. That and the gun listed in the post, the bigger the buy-in pool the bigger the prize. I'm not keeping anything.
---
Same could be said for you. Btw, if you're spending 2k and 30 stims per attempt perhaps the problem lies in the mirror. But you're obviously not too bright, so it's to be expected. I've ran just as many free imposter events as ones I've spent cards on. That is fact. Prove me wrong. Downvote all ya want, you are still spewing false info.
---
If you activate a pylon yourself you will.take.constant electrical damage from it.
---
Take some jet you'll be fine just fine
---
Rifleman for semi and should be commando for auto.
---
What platform
---
I really would like the bos legs plan what kind of trade are you looking for ?
---
I can't place property the greek letter O on the outside of the brick wall, seems that Only that letter has problem
---
You should do what I do: Perch on the roof of your house in a Sheepsquatch costume and stare at people heading to the event.
---
Apparently 330+ people agree with me.
---
I‚Äôm admitting that for PVE the PA is great. Or for nuke events it is the ideal.
---
PVP, the PA isn‚Äôt great.  And why wouldn‚Äôt it be okay for a PA to have chameleon?
---
Do you use PA for your PVP events?
---
It‚Äôs not perfect , but it‚Äôs much better
---
&gt; It's bad enough that vendors already stock every single plan they have available 
---
No it isn't.   The best plans cost a hefty amount of caps and often require stabilized flux to build.   Getting enough caps and flux require a good bit of grinding.  
---
  
---
The old system was terrible because the plans were  rare to the point of being non-existent.   It also meant that role playing was dictated by RNG.    Under the old system, it was not possible to be a role play as a skilled craftsman with knowledge of advanced power armor mods because you simply couldn't build them.
---
I so almost didn't read this. Bgs probably won't though.
---
Good troll :)
---
I wish we had Raiders in adventure mode honestly or else it would break the lore too much for me. Cause the Capital Wasteland is nearby and the Pitt is right to the north. It would be strange for there to be a Utopia in a wasteland.
---
not if it's an intended part of the game, no.
---
which it is.
---
Best to just swap servers, block and scrub your hands of them. 
---
Do what you can to make and play with friends. 
---
Don‚Äôt be afraid to just walk away from pinheads. 
---
You can always bounce back from being completely smashed to bits.
---
Wait wtf, can you keep doing this for 100 fuel each time?
---
Mole miners count as human. And players are humans.
---
Oh ok this solves it, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm even supposed to fight in that condition
---
How much for it
---
Indeed, I'm glowing with hope on this.
---
Even if it were liquid acid, many acids give off potent and sometimes toxic vapors. Hydrochloric for example releases hydrogen chloride, a corrosive,  toxic gas.  In the US, it's IDLH is only 50 ppm. 
---
Who's to say it hasn't developed a more potent organic acid who's vapors can be carried into the building?  Should still do less damage as you're not being coated in it though.
---
&gt;You also need to fix the mobs in white springs that aren't legendary dropping legendary items. That's straight up insulting
---
They are legendary.  The ‚ÄúDiseased‚Äù prefix causes the ‚ÄúLegendary‚Äù to be hidden.  But it is still a legendary.
---
I was hoping that the mentioned prestige system would do. Something like that. But to a lesser degree.
---
They could happen across all servers at the same time, idk.
---
You left us in our hour of need. You abandoned us for 25 years. Unless you have a pink doughnut and say Doh then no
---
I agree. Even if it's something I'm not gonna want, like a 3 star troubleshooters whatever with no other interesting effects, a 3 star should drop a 3 star, at least a two star. A 3 star dropping a 1 star is just... painful. I think that's your gist?
---
Millions agreed with Hitler. And? You want a cookie, lol? Doesn't make you right. I had no qualms with your complaint/opinion of the amounts of materials burnt in the event, but when you essentially say "You have to spend 2k caps to participate". I'm in no way cool with that, as it's 100% not true. Can you? Yes. Do you have to? No. End. Of. Story.
---
Alright I should be on in 45-1 hou
---
Yea, that'd be neat. Nuked Flora could also turn inert quicker than it does from a nuke zone.

Use this to look for a resource spot to build a collector on if your into that sort of thing. And if your looking for a few good places that don‚Äôt offer anything but a good view. I may know of a spot or two.
---
If your character can't take the damage let someone else do it &amp; try to protect them from the bots as well as take down sheepsquatch.
---
I've been having the same issue...my whitespring floors clip like mad with my brick walls.
---
No regular SB will give you prime receiver plans but be warned I've killed 60 of them and have only gotten 3 plans so far.
---
Xbox and price I'd say 3000
---
Back to? Well gotta keep on fighting those legendaries.
---
Doesn't seem to have stopped the plethora of anti-armour explosive users who can kill you in 0.5s in Survival, though. I've given up on warning people to stop shooting at me, and straight to Axe-Time-To-The-Face.
---
Are you guys having this issue on the ground floor at all, or just once you go up stairs?
---
Congratulations. You bought a piece of trash.
---
&gt; I think you just need to admit that you don't trust Bethesda anymore, and learn to agree to disagree instead of portraying your opinion as fact.
---
Trusting any megacorp in any industry is a terrible idea. They never care about you. They never care about what you want. They only care about transferring the contents of your wallet into their own. If the means to do so happens to be giving you what you want, then congratulations, a coincidence lined up in your favor. If the means to do so happens to be shifting their cosmetic MTX shop into a P2W shop, then they're gonna bloody well do it.
---
*And make a fortune in the process.*
---
This isn't just the future of FO76. It's the future of the industry as a whole. MTX is basically a goddamn money printer and we're going to see pretty much every game released including them from here on out.

power armor has always been trash. what kind of idiots at bethesda sat there and thought "hmmm, the notoriously top of the line armor in our entire franchise is gonna be so weak someone running around naked with a deathclaw gauntlet can kill them in one shot"?? PA shoulda been something everyone tries to achieve. you should be a fucking tank. instead its the worst PvP setup in the game. yet another reason this game is terrible
---
I‚Äôve suggested this first like 3 times. 
---
D.E.C.K
---
Dweller. Engineered. Card. Kits
---
You get 3 decks. 
---
Level 1
---
Level 30
---
Level 50
---
You can add and many combinations as you have cards.  
---
There is a soft 2 minute cooldown between changing, mostly prevent any tomfoolery or bugs. 
---
As an added effect you can slot one shiny/animated card as a passive card adding 1 each deck totaling 3.
---
I wouldn't call it pay to *cheat*. Pay 2 win, yeah. And it's bullshit either way. But cheating is, by its very definition, modifying or abusing game code to give yourself an advantage. Exploiting, say, the Pocketed Armor Glitch is cheating. Buying carryweight perk cards is not. End result is the same, but only one's cheating.
---
Bullshit either way, though. Really shouldn't be in the game.
---
Why are you telling us?
---
I don't do PvP. The point is, power armor is supposed to be a situational tool that you use when the occasion calls for it. If you want legendary effects use regular armor. If you want to be a walking tank use power armor. Also, power armor does have chameleon in the form of the stealth boy mod.
---
Exactly thay need to increase the overall armor rating by at least 30%
---
Considering every single thing the person said was the OPPOSITE of what I said in the post, I'd say you do actually have to read something to comment on it
---
I've accidently bought shit several times. Just contact bethesda support and they will refund the atoms and even let you keep the items.
---
*interest not interstate.
---
I'm level 101 and honestly there inst a good spot thats going to matter to much. If anything, try for something central to reduce spending caps on fat traveling
---
Good to know. I will contact them.
---
This is something we should‚Äôve had from day 0
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs one of my favorite things to do
---
Maybe you should have to pay to have it removed, just like in real life?
---
I hear some FO4 Institute music lol
---
Yep happens to me too. I have to exit workshop and re enter every time i repair  or modify. Side note- complete lack of difficulty. No one is dropping nukes anymore. Ive found 1 code in last 30 hours of gameplay its getting a little stale. Im lvl 113 and actually love the game , but i recently sold my favorite melee weapon on accident n realized it far too late. And trying to replace it has been dreadful. Can i recommend random radiation event zones that are spawned in the environment and not by players?
---
&gt; If this were a single player game would people be upset about repair kits? 
---
Not really. If it was a single player game you wouldn't need to buy them on the atom shop, you'd just open up the dev console and use player.additem instead. Or download a mod off the Nexus that lets you craft them at a workbench just like we did in NV.
---
&gt; the fact that casual players find farming hard. 
---
It isn't that farming is hard. It's that farming **is not fun or engaging gameplay.** It's boring as fucking hell to sit there and grind items to craft consumables. I play Fallout to *escape* that sort of shit. It's part-and-parcel of MMOs, it's part of why I loathe that entire genre as much as it is possible to do so, why I'll never play another one.
---
Grind is not fun. Grind can fuck right off.
---
Incidentally, item grind is part of why I never crafted them in New Vegas, either, I'd usually just scavenge them off enemies or trade 183590 service rifles for a few from the major traders. And I seldom needed them anyway, at least once I got Raul in party, degredation was so slow that I might have only needed about 20 or 30 WRKs in an entire playthru, which is perfectly feasible to acquire without crafting a single one.
---
It's also why I use god mode when working on my settlements in FO4. I'll be damned if I spend three hours turning the Commonwealth upside down looking for teapots and alarm clocks just to move a couple walls around in my doom fortress. Fuck that. ~, TGM, enter, ~, adjust, ~, TGM, enter, save &lt;savename here&gt;, enter, ~, back to gameplay.
---
Microsoft tried to get them on board when they bought Minecraft. Sony likes their closed system. Same reason mods on PS4 for Skyrim and FO4 can not use external assets.
---
That is a possibility.
---
I've seen this on PC while fighting the Scorchbeast Queen.  The game will act like its frozen for 3-4 seconds, and then resume.  It doesn't throw a "Server not responding."
---
What if you had to pay to use VATS?  Or if you could pay to have higher accuracy, or better armor, or just a better weapon?  These are all essentially toned down versions of paying a hacker to buy an aimbot, or "auto fire" or a wallhack.
---
The game devs know that they want to rationalize the cheats they sell, make them seem less of clear violation of right and wrong, they want to slip in to a grey area and take your money.  And, they don't want to take too big of a step at once, because they want you to just be hooked on the cheats, so you keep buying them little by little, to keep up with all the other players who are doing the same, or, those few desperate fools (like us) who say fuck the cheaters, I want to grind my way to the top.
---
But, sadly, that's kind of like trying to fight the umpire, in the end, the dev can keep introducing updates that have "new improved weapons" etc. and you find yourself slipping behind the PTW crowd no matter how hard you grind, how good your aim, or how tenascious and patient your stealth.
---
yes, yes and more yes
---
Hey thanks for your support!
---
On PC you can permanently block from the social menu.
---
Just west up the hill from Appalachian antiques is a lead deposit. Set up camp there. It‚Äôs close as can be. Just mind the SB from line the same from time to time.
---
No, the gauntlets are classified as Unarmed and benefit from Iron Fist.
---
The one odd exception is the Meat Hook, a Unarmed weapon which benefits from both Gladiator and Iron Fist.
---
im pretty sure i saw another post where it was said the plans dont exist yet?
---
You can block permanently.
---
There are two block options:
---
- Block for session
---
- Block
---
The second is the permanent one.
---
What were you doing when you get kicked?
---
Nah keep it all rng (:
---
Its an burning, irradiated gas. Pretty sure its how they transform things into Scorch. Its sucks that it goes through buildings, but it makes sense.
---
Yeah they did a limited charr plushie sale I think during the 1st year of gw2 release
---
Literally nothing. Walking around? Messing in my inventory. It‚Äôs so frustrating.
---
No proof tho?
---
I run a pure Chameleon sniper build with my trusty Instigating Hunting Rifle by my side, though I also have a Dragon for big game (the lack of a silencer doesn't particularly matter when that thing one-shots Glowing Deathclaws).
---
I wish I did, I've tried getting it myself with no luck.
---
What does Luck of the Draw do?
---
These have been in the game for a long long time. Most likely dropped by bethesda
---
Yea I just don‚Äôt bother with survival on my main and my other two have just turned into cap mules, ever since the ‚Äúpatch‚Äù that made all legendaries drop proper weapons I haven‚Äôt had an issue, even noticed an increase of none legendary ghouls in white springs dropping 1* stuff more often
---
Yeah it‚Äôs at the very top of the map it will be cool to see what‚Äôs inside.
---
Just the title
---
Well if u block someone then there will only be 5 people on 76. Lol
---
Yes it's the syringer that no longer drops in legendary the flare and the drill still drop but they never said they took those out.
---
Chance to repair your weapon. Works beautifully - when it actually worked. I basically never had to repair my melee weapons. It was only effecting Grognak's Axe alongside the other bug with the Axe that makes it so you can't repair past 100%. 
---
Now it's effecting every melee weapon.
---
&gt;  it's not too late to fight back against this most awful bullshit greed.
---
Mmn, no, cat's out of the bag. Publishers have seen how it's a money printer, how just a couple thousand people who don't care will offset the millions who protest and don't spend a cent by such a significant margin that they end up making more money than they would have if they'd never bothered with MTX.
---
&gt; You Won‚Äôt Believe How Much Money Activision Has Made In 1 Year From Microtransactions Alone
---
It is safe to say that 2016 was a fantastic year for Activision. Thanks to their big name titles like Call of Duty and Overwatch the publisher had an extremely profitable year.
---
image via Call of Duty
---
According to  Activision‚Äôs full-year earnings report the publisher racked in an annual revenue of $6.61 billion for the full year; making this a new record in the company‚Äôs history. The publisher‚Äôs profits increased to 42 percent in comparison to 2015‚Äôs total revenue of $4.66 billion.
---
A majority of Activision‚Äôs success came from, Activision Blizzard, which made a 39% of the entire publisher‚Äôs revenue which was $2.43 billion. Most of Blizzard‚Äôs success comes from the critically-acclaimed first-person shooter, Overwatch.
---
image via VG247
---
In addition to Activision‚Äôs very profitable year, revenues from in-game content (which includes microtransactions) made approximately $3.6 billion in 2016. This is more than double of what, the publisher made in 2015, which was around $1.6 billion in profits from microtransactions alone. The microtransactions came in the form of Call of Duty supply drops, Overwatch loot boxes, and World of Warcraft pets.  https://www.fraghero.com/wont-believe-much-money-activision-made-1-year-microtransactions-alone/
---
With it being that profitable, you can pretty much kiss the days of gaming being an escape from reality goodbye. The industry's as good as dead, it just doesn't know it yet.
---
I've found myself spending a small fortune in RC lately. All the money that could have been going towards a new PC build(I'm still rocking an AMD Phenom II 720 tricore!!), toawrds new game builds, has instead gone to Flite Test, OS Engines, Cox International, Futaba, DuBro, Sullivan, et-al. Been building nitro powered foamies left right and center, got a couple of 1/10 racers in the fleet...yeeaahhh. hell if I had a waterway I'd be doing fuel-powered boats too.  And I'm probably going to be doing another short course build with some inheritance I just received; have a line on a guy selling a fairly mint Traxxas Slayer with a blown engine for about 200-250. I've always wanted to build one of those and that's a good starting point methinks.
---
If Bethesda wants me to stop buying glow plugs and buy their next Fallout game, it better be just like the Fallout games that hooked me on the series in the first place. **Fully offline single player** story driven experiences that I can throw mods at until either my computer crashes from the overload or the game's nigh unrecognizeable.
---
I've finished to entire questline for Lying Lowe and can't figure out how to get all the other mounted head plans I don't know if anyone else is stuck on my topic as well. If so let me know

Ive gotten disconnected a few times but its always been my internet cutting out. I play on PC though so maybe its a console thing?
---
Maybe

It does drop Molotov‚Äôs

The areas are scaled to a degree. Of you are that low and running into creatures that high level then you are in an area you aren't ready for.

Power armor pieces weigh when you are wearing the power armor

Had a pretty sweet spot far to the North East on the edge of a large swamp in The Mire. Loved the ambiance of the place but was so far away and secluded.. ill be back there one day
---
In my experience Speed Demon and RadAway don't get along, so I never use them or their diluted partners.
---
Nuka Grape heals HP and Rads with no side effects as does Brahmin Milk.
---
Level 205, Bloodied/Unyielding Sneak Crit Rifleman is the build I'm using and I only step into Power Armor if I need a Jetpack :)
---
Check out the new version please.
---
Wow, I've seen some people asking 25k caps + items...
---
Caused by the same thing, yep.  Human error is a part of coding though...hopefully it'll get noticed right away and sorted quick.
---
Could we add a communist NPC that is trying to act like and American üòÇ
---
If you don't see what the big deal is, then go look at War Thunder. Gaijooble's been fucking its playerbase for YEARS with premium vehicles that perform way better than they have any right to perform given their matchmaking.
---
If I were to reinstall WT and buy the SU-100y, I'd have a better game first five times I rolled out than I've had in the past three years.
---
Oh, and do I also have to point out that you can use their in-game currency to buy the upgrades to the normal vehicles that otherwise require *literal months of grinding* to acquire? I didn't? Well there ya go.
---
This shit is cancer. And it's reached Stage IV. The industry is dead, it just doesn't know it yet.

Here's a full breakdown of all the drops:

I play on Xbox and I rarely get disconnected, when I do it‚Äôs a crash never a disconnected from server

[I'm done crying. Chelsea used to be my best friend. Now she keeps saying all kinds of mean things. I know I'm smarter than her, but she's prettier than me. Why can't she be happy about that? Why does she have to be the best at everything? Just because she's a Wesley and the Wesleys are so rich doesn't mean she's better than me.
---
Chelsea wants to go on a picnic and play some games. She got so mad last time when I beat her. She cheats all the time and it makes me so mad, but I don't say anything. Dad says I have mom's temper and I need to control it. I promised him I would try real hard to not get angry if she cheats or calls me names.](/spoiler)

That‚Äôs right OP, fight for the gaymers!!! üòéüòéüòé

First off they weren't going to be in this patch in the first place. The article that talked about it was for things after this patch. Second they are still in the games files and the functionality for them is also already in the game they are just not enabled. What is happening is either they don't have a qa team or the one they have is very small or just not very good. As a programmer that's what these symptoms show and I've seen it many many times.
---
Im curious when we will all start seeing 4 and 5 star legendary drops. I feel theyre holding back to introduce with later DLC maybe even next year.

!remindme 3pm EST

I totally understand that. Just hope there isn't more detrimental things they did as well.
---
The new feature is mostly nice. The problem I have with it is that I‚Äôm a stealth commando crit build. I play on adventure mode and when someone attacks me first I can‚Äôt VATS them in response because they‚Äôre neutral. Even though they‚Äôre attacking me. Doesn‚Äôt seem right. I need my head shots.
---
I usually become full conduit because I don't die and Sheepsquatch can take damage the entire time, could solo the event but I am low on Stims ATM. Best advice, find a magazine that allows you to take -25% damage from robots and find a Furious .50 cal, use all you big gun perks and a big guns bobblehead, add a psychobuff to the mix and watch everything die very very quickly. You are Welcome!
---
Thank you so much!
---
np :)
---
Hey all we were out at dinner. He'll be on most of tomorrow while Im at bagpipe lessons, so any help anyone can share, it's super appreciated and will make a young fans day.

---
Still don't have my bag, BTW.
---
Its called art Linda, look it up!
---
I am not sure how you did not know people do that.  To a degree its part of the game.  If you play this game it is going to happen to you once in a while.  When something like that happens you best recourse is to log off that server asap so minimize the damage.  Some people enjoy causing others pain in life and in games.  Don't take it personally, take a break,  come back when you feel better.  It is very easy to rebuild most camps, especially if you blueprint it.  If you lost junk, well that is part of the game, it is going to happen more than once.  Junk can be replaced.  Best if you can find some like minded people to play with and help one another but even then things can happen. Life has its troubles in game and out.
---
&gt; What if you had to pay to use VATS?
---
I don't use VATS anyway lol.
---
&gt;  Or if you could pay to have higher accuracy, or better armor, or just a better weapon? These are all essentially toned down versions of paying a hacker to buy an aimbot, or "auto fire" or a wallhack.
---
The difference is these things are designed into the game code. Cheating would be using third party software to give you these things *without* paying.
---
If I somehow gained access to the devconsole in 76 and used player.additem to give myself a full inventory of repair kits, *that* would be cheating. The 'rules' of the game explicitly forbid these sorts of shenanigans and I would need to alter game code in order to do this. However, if I threw some real world dollarydoos at Bethesda and bought a full inventory of repair kits, it wouldn't be cheating. By putting the weapon repair kits on the Atom Shop, Bethesda are saying that it's perfectly okay for me to have an unfair advantage over another player as long as I pay them first.
---
Cheating requires breaking the game rules, and if you're buying power off the MTX shop, you're not breaking the game rules.
---
I had half a mind to reinstall 76 a few days ago, shortly before this news dropped,(I played about 10 levels worth, just long enough to get a taste of black powder weaponry as I had planned on going full Civil War with my build before I quit because the game memleaked so badly an hour's worth of gameplay nearly crashed my machine outright) but I'm probably not gonna do that now. I honestly don't give a fuck about PVP(IF I could flat out disable it I would), I don't give a fuck about cooperative play or raids or whatever, but I'm not gonna patronize their servers and dedicate 70gb of HDD space I simply don't have free if they're gonna make it P2W.
---
This has been driving me up the wall
---
Ol, now Im feeling stupid. Thanks for the info!!!
---
Yeah why
---
Because a power armor FRAME has no armor?
---
I would recommend you just choose one style. Either semi or full auto. Based on my experience and other‚Äôs gameplay videos, going full guerrilla is the best option for maximum damage. Are you wanting a fully optimized perk card setup or are you also wanting resource helping perks? If so, then you give up on some of the power for ease of convenience.
---
Cause it's the only one I know of that has the effect to deal +10% to humans.
---
Gotta sell them refrigerators.
---
The playtime paints look pretty nice though
---
And in Fallout NV? And in Fallout 3? That feature?
---
The last patch notes said they would still reset every 20 hours. Perhaps it's a glitch introduced by the hotfix?
---
It's not that it's the fact thay nerfed something already garbage and never bothered to tell anyone at least give the pieces an armor boost
---
Thank you. Could not find the last clue anywhere. And it was right in front of me. Derp.
---
Damn I like the syringer at least that‚Äôs useful scrap for me
---
Got a legendary berserker assaultron head with 40% bash damage.  Sold it already or I would of traded for a drill.  Level 135 and still have no legendary drills to my name.
---
I can only imagine - I was going to say.. was I going crazy? LOL
---
Best idea for it I have read. Now I'm gutted because I want this.
---
I‚Äôm officially starting a new phrase: Posted on Daily Basis. 
---
PDB.
---
where did the super mutant hurt you?
---
I have all of em
---
Oh lol
---
PC used to have a mod for this, but the update before this one broke all mods and it made the game unplayable. Now we are back to the crushing reality that this is a basic feature the game still doesn't have after half a year...
---
I just figured this out today! tank killer at 36% armor penetration, combine that with Superior armor penetration modification with 40%, you get 76% armor penetration. 
---
Basically your 350 Dr - 76%= 84 dr
---
Good
---
Mine are all over the spectrum.  Finding 0 over and over then one randomly has 1400 I sell a couple of things and then all are at 0 again.  I don't get it...
---
How much each / What's your GT?
---
I can join up and buy now.
---
Where do I sign up?
---
I've only noticed on upper floors.
---
Yep, if I have food about to expire I just sell it. There are plenty of food items in the game that don't expire to load up on.
---
PA in PvP is almost totally useless, regardless of how much they increase the DRs because the AA perks and effects make it as effective as wearing a wet paper bag. 
---
The AA weapon effect allows you to ignore 50% of the target's DR.  Tank killer (rifles) grants 36%. Stabilized (heavies) grants 45% while in PA. Incisor (melee) is easily the most insane, at a whopping 75%. 
---
It's my understanding these are multiplicative, not additive. Let's assume a DR of 500, using an AA weapon, without any of the armor piercing mods, and with appropriate perks your effective DR would be: 
---
Melee:  62.5.   
---
Rifle:   167.5.   
---
Heavies:  137.5
---
Which ones do you need?
---
I sold all 1400 caps worth of stuff then a minute later I was buying steel at the same vendor, and it was back at 1400. It allowed me to sell another 700 caps worth and when I went to my stash to get fodder for the rest, it was back to zero. But it let me keep the caps.
---
...are you kidding me. I've been working on the same project for a few weeks, just not at the rate you take down events. Good sir or madam, might I integrate your data into mine?

Really any of them - whatever is cheaper. Got a few friends moving from PS4 to Xbox, so I'm just snagging a collection of Serums. I may actually need more than 3 LOL. They can pick and choose.

It's not a bug. The perk was only meant to effect ranged weapons.

150/ea and ill pull out what i have made

Too many wikis, so if you're into wikis, it's really personal preference about which one you're going to be contributing to, and I'm sure there are at least some people already contributing to all of them.
---
On the other hand, social media is helping gamers with far less work involved. You have places like Reddit and Discord where people come and just ask for help - even when the answer is already out there (LMGTFY).

Lol too bad farming west tek gives better loot than the new event.

They are part of a weekly challenge during a brewing spotlight that hasn't happened yet
---
Go take over the hemlock holes.  You'll get that in no time
---
I believe it‚Äôs just the ‚Äòstandard ‚Äò magazine. The one that‚Äôs already on the weapon. Pretty stupid in my opinion. Why even have a mod for something that already comes standard on said weapon.
---
Says who
---
3 nukes today, back to back , no drops, no SBQ issues, no glitches.  It was glorious!
---
Awesome, one sec just buying some Bulk Acid from a guy
---
Just got a ghoul‚Äôs leather arm, at this rate I should be getting stalker‚Äôs tire irons by next weekend. Yipee.
---
 Can I interest u in the Milk of Human Kindness?
---
Also the fact that legendary items spawn outside of the body and then get placed in the inventory. Other enemies can pick them up.
---
That's the reason thay need to buff it in DR and in other ways like more mods like regular armor has the dense mod witch decreases explosion damage and so on PA needs to be a viable choice to players in pvp
---
I did my part. üëçüòõ
---
Stay next to the pylon you have activated and you take much less damage
---
There's quite a few people.reporting tbis issue now after the last patch.
---
Where are you located? 
---
In Australia here and don't have tjose issues plus plenty of folks playing when I sign in.
---
You can scrap for them, it just might take a shit tun of combat armor to get them.
---
Was able to run the new event once before I jad to leave town. Stupid squatch boss dropped a drill.
---
Seriously, f* that. At least I can sell 1* legendaries, a drill is an insult, it's not even worth picking up.
---
Very comprehensive and fun write up. I'm still going to tag you in every Junkie's post :) Bonus points for the name mention!
---
Extremely rude to those of us who can not afford them. My money is as good as anyone else‚Äôs.
---
I didn't say anything about noobs and no it's the exact same thing... 
---
People SPAWN into HIGH TRAFFIC locations you're CAMPED at then you KILL them...
---
You're not doing quests or events or exploring you're basically farming people mostly to earn caps as it was your main complaint when it was nerfed
---
People like you are why lots people wasn't playing SM so congrats on helping with the nerf with your 20-0 I'm sure you had a big hand in helping it 
---
And now with the cap nerf more people will play and less people have a reason to camp... 
---
TLDR... Play the game how you want man I'm just saying it's kind of a dick way to play
---
Flair checks out.
---
I use to love there for a while when the game first came out also has 3 random loot spawns and use to spawn with a cap stash when entering a server
---
Just so everyone knows drills and syringers are in the legendary pool. The only thing stopping them from being legendary is the lack of a legendary attach point of which all armor and weapons have 5. I need to double check but I beleive wood armor only has one legendary attach point.
---
Are you sure it was the post?
---
This was awesome man, very well put together and I keep trying to find Junkies items for you just so things like this happen! I'd upvote twice if possible haha
---
I‚Äôve died countless times with no issue.
---
This would be the hardest class to maintain. To always have to take these chems.... would be tireless
---
Haha that's hilarious
---
And this is potentially a major problem if they were to decide to make Mothman products to see. Sure it's a mythical creature and that can't be copyrighted or trademarked. But there are people already making products and there's enough legal grey area there that it's possible someone could sue Bethesda for making something 'too close' to their own Mothman merchandising. 
---
I'm not saying they would necessarily win that lawsuit, but the fact that it could happen might be enough for Bethesda's lawyers to warn against it. 
---
You can bet that Bethesda went to all of the real world locations that appear in game and got it in writing that they were okay appearing. And if you were to think 'oh that wouldn't happen' remember that Dion DiMucci sued Zenimax over the use of the song 'The Wanderer' in the live action Fallout 4 trailer. Something he initially agreed to, then withdrew permission after seeing the trailer.
---
Explain, proof?
---
...we can already grow some plants. Do you really think the reason we can't grow tarberries is a technical issue? omg lol
---
I mean there are quests that lead up that way as well as an event and a very popular random encounter location
---
I was buying BULK. That's a long time for Hemlock. Only 3 nodes and net you 90 every hour. So that's like 6 hours of perfect timing going back to them LOL
---
What level are you? Might be worth leveling up and gather supplies because the nuke events pre and post launch are highly resource draining, therefore you need them so stay in the fight.
---
Yep do this, then when sheepsquatch comes for you, just run around the pylon in a circle. Helps by time for other to peg him, and for you to stay alive
---
I last heard it was estimated around 400 to 500 meters. When I asked this question, a guy told me he was in between arkos pharmacy and gauley mine and could hit helvetia
---
Wish a syringer had legendary attachments, like chance to double effects, I only use it during sbq fights but it‚Äôs handy to have 
---
And yea I‚Äôve heard wood only has one mentioned before
---
Oh got ya!  That's a lot of acid.  Making tons of ammo?
---
yes but buying one kinda defeats the purpose
---
In case you haven't seen like any of my other posts/comments I am a dataminer and it's in the data files
---
1K for the 2 shot 10mm?
---
Sweet I love trash!
---
Hahahaha the sheepsquatch drilled you
---
This was happening to me and then when in the craft room of WS it didn‚Äôt ?
---
Or if you can just stand on top of it
---
Imagine legendary drills that are overrepaired. So much damage
---
Glad it worked out for you!  Seems hit or miss sometimes.  We had SBQ glitch the other day, kept glitching in and out.  We finally just called it and server hopped.
---
Same thing here. I finally got a level 50 two shot auto grenade launcher. Went to mod on the heavy barrel, and NO CHANGE to weapon damage. Wtf??? This is including max level demolition perk. Also? I have a level 40 two shot auto grenade launcher, same thing. Moded on the heavy barrel? No change in damage. I don‚Äôt get it.
---
I have no numbers, but, my camp is across from the Slocum's Joe in The Forrest and I can hit the Overseer's Camp no sweat. Haven't tested beyond that.
---
Did you ever find out a fix? I‚Äôm having the same problem rn
---
Ok well why wkd theey do that...
---
No idea but it's supposed to be another brew 10 types of alcohol thing
---
No. Hardin/Marion county.
---
Game performance has been quite wacky after the past patch. I‚Äôve been having issues since Tuesday night.
---
There's better fixes than simply buffing PA. Getting around to adding Legendary PA would be nice, but the current stock of armor mods can't be on it unless PA is limited to one star. 
---
First, the AA effects could have a max cap that only applies to PvP, say 50%. It would still be OP in PvE, but that's less of a concern.  They've already played around with what amounts to a max damage per hit in PvP to prevent one-shot kills, but that's a useless tool when dealing with full-auto weapons that can land multiple hits before the victim can even react.
---
Imagine putting on a huge auger bit would kill anyone with a solid head shot
---
U shld maybe post this in r/fallout. The majority of the community here in r/f076 are definitely biased towards the game.
---
Here are the facts: 
---
1) The game was horrendous on launch and bugs known years ago that were in fo4 were not fixed in fo76. And what is worse those said bugs were fixed by modders also years ago. 
---
2) Various scandals like the canvas bag, customer info being leaked on their website which is a serious breach of privacy. And the general direction Bethesda was going. 
---
3) The game has improved since launch. 
---
4) Bethesda is a profits oriented entity. So profits first. Customers second unless it relates to more profits. 
---
The so called herd mentality 'hate' didn't happen just because people who were mindless sheeps. There were valid reasons why it happened. People who credit the u popularity of the game to mindless 'hate' are just deliberately shielding themselves from the facts. 
---
Again post this on r/fallout and enjoy the game!
---
I was being sarcastic, still nothing and it upsets me.
---
It's been working that way since Day 1. 
---
The perk card does not say anything about only guns. It would specify guns. It specifies weapons. Just because "Draw" is in the name, doesn't mean it's referring to guns.
---
Oof, a 2 hit combo
---
Great post and actually helps me understand the junky build finally. Thank you for making this. The only discrepancy I noticed is completely unrelated and when you talked about TS Weapons. The TS modifier only lowers HIP FIRE and VATS accuracy. TS and Beam Splitter on Lasers behave very similarly, and after extensive testing of accuracy Beam Splitter also only affects HIP FIRE and VATS accuracy. All weapons ADS accuracy should be pin point accurate for TS and Beam Splitter Weapons :)
---
Caviler assassin's armor. Caviler is sentinel but while sprinting.
---
Just go to the other mode, and place your camp down like 5 inches to whatever direction you prefer. Chill.
---
Sounds rough man. Probably best to not play on survival
---
I was just saying it's a case of you don't have to server hop?
---
You're still able to spam stimpacks in Adventure. At that point you have to out dps the stacked healing effects. Auto-stim armor will proc a stimpack every 20 sec, perks will make stimpacks more effective, and Cavalier armors provides the same 15% dmg reduction per piece that sentinal provides, but when you're sprinting.
---
I had about 6 people aside from me join on the event mostly high level players.. the only low level was my friend and he and I(level 182) carried the other high level players.  They acted like the didn't want to be conduits. It's frustrating. My friend and I was the only one being conduits and kept dying respawning becoming conduits dying respawning cuz none of the other people wanted to do it
---
If I remember correctly, those things were plans you read in your pipboy and then could craft for your camp in the build menu. I could be remembering wrong, though.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt even server hop to escape, no one plays survival cause there‚Äôs no incentive. Otherwise I‚Äôm sure people would‚Äôve came and killed them.
---
Uh, welcome to unlimited pvp on the internet?
---
Sorry, I didn't clarify in my original post, I never got the plans for it in general? like they were never in my inventory to read/use
---
Lol I love the enthusiasm for them, I‚Äôm glad someone got some enjoyment out of the binoculars
---
Go to adventure. Survival is rough for new players, though they must have killed you a ton of times for you to be depleted of caps since you only lose .25 caps per level.
---
Mega handy if you dont feel like having a hunting rifle on you all the time. Just wish the zoom wasnt barely past my character's nose lol
---
No i didn't. I just had to level up the perks. I don't know if it was meant to be that way or not, but that's the way it is...
---
I used to have a really good spot right at the base of one of the monorail pillars down just west of Fort Defiance. Had a nice little pond for water purifying and all. Only issue is you have to build the camp in the air. But if you don't mind that it isn't bad. You also may get the occasional scorchbeast fly over there though
---
Just having a great party, is all.
---
LOL. But really though, smelting some ore is all :) I actually got what I needed though from Xbox LFG - So going to delete the post :D
---
I‚Äôm in the same exact boat, on my second respawn at the event, got the stuck loading screen. Still haven‚Äôt finished the event due to this.
---
Right? I usually use the regular ones because they have at least some zoom but the peepers have literally no zoom lol
---
+Karma
---
Huh. Maybe you dropped them without realizing? Or it glitched and you saw it as a reward but didn't actually receive it as a reward? Sucks either way.
---
I‚Äôd think it‚Äôd be patched by now but I guess it‚Äôs never a big problem
---
I know of plenty extractors. I only care for lead for the most part and the scenery is beautiful.
---
Thanks though
---
I'm having a hard time believing this is real.
---
Nice try though, "Verbally Insulting Bot".
---
Sure. In game for a few more minutes. Same GT as reddit name.
---
What foods do people make? I just have good doggy, cola nut, and party girl. Makes it easy to keep my meters up.
---
Yeah I thought it was really weird bc all the other rewards showed up just fine. But those were apparel items &amp; not plans so that could be why
---
Only weighs one pound so I can just sw8tch the two out when I see something in the distance real fast
---
ok gimme 5
---
I hate to be the nerd but super mutants where pre nuke explosion . Military super soldier type experiment .
---
Yea when I bought my JE Combat shotty from UQ I noticed right away that it‚Äôs Dmg was better than my TSE and I didn‚Äôt have to deal with the huge reticle anymore for hip-fire...it‚Äôs kinda what pushed my into useing Junkie exclusivity though obviously aiming also affects the accuracy
---
Ah ok, you may have roofs under your floors. I had to place roofs before I could do floors on the upper floors and after the update they started doing the same thing. I was able to remove the roofs and the floors stayed, just had to replace the stuff I had on those squares
---
I tried a junkies and berserkers build both are cool
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not bat. It does focus on objects a little better too
---
Bought the pre order and played the beta everyday it was on if I wasn‚Äôt at work and I had a decent time. Stopped playing up until a few weeks ago and I‚Äôve been having a blast. Haven‚Äôt gotten this ain‚Äôt a fallout game since NV. If Bethesda keeps up with the Patch‚Äôs and keep paying close attention to the players comments they‚Äôll have won me back
---
Thanks M8, I‚Äôm grateful whenever you ping me to let me know a new J Weapon is up for trade
---
You can mod a legendary armor piece you already have into bos. This will raise The stats of the armor. For instance, I have an unyielding combat armor chest piece, and put the bos mod on it. So now, its a bos unyielding combat armor chest piece. With higher dr/er than before.
---
Between this and the jumping when connecting wires... Man it's a hassle to build sometimes. I don't want it to be, because I love it, but...
---
The other guys nailed it. Assassin Cavalier armor will provide the same damage resistances of Assassin Sentinel, except the Cavalier effect applies while sprinting. 
---
If they spammed super stims, they'd be nearly impossible to kill, but that may not actually be the case here. There's a visual glitch with A/S and A/C armors. I've had several opponents mention me Stimpak spamming even though I rarely use them in PvP. The game basically shows the damage you'd have done against heir base DR/ER then it realizes their 10 damage reducing perks are active (5 assassin's effects and 5 Cavalier or Sentinel) then corrects their health bar. On their end they don't see this effect.
---
ok well it's 35 bucks AU down the road... I'm gonna go and buy it too and give it a shot now the dust has settled.
---
US North Carolina, I can fast travel when it finally lets me in the game every place except my camp.  I have been able to fast travel to train stations but the vendors never show up.  Really sucks, even tried making a new character but I could not get out of the vault before disconnect.
---
I literally mentioned this in an earlier post about seeds
---
Oh that would be great. There are still a few events I have never done... Like patrol duty and a few others being able to "notify me" on certain events would be great cus checking the map every 5 mins is tedious not to mention when u check the map and go to event (spending caps to get there) to load in and the event is over
---
Well I don‚Äôt die very much for one thing, also let‚Äôs pretend you die, lose all addictions and go through the 25 or so chems to get your addictions back and then die again shortly after...there seems to be a timer b/c sometimes it only takes 1 or 2 chems to regain the addictions in that case
---
Of course lol whenever I see one I instantly think of you haha
---
Gotcha i am going to gather a butt ton of lead and other resources
---
KEK - I didn't downvote you, even though I actually thought you were being dismissive to those of us who were uspet about this BS.  
---
Now that I understand, have a couple upvotes...
---
That should be interesting, was really wishing for something more involved also but anything would be nice
---
Worked on my handy buzz saw this morning
---
Well I was hard pressed to find a Berzerker weapon that I could use to compare..you saved my bacon ü•ì
---
I can help you with all of that in about 30 minutes
---
But has the message popped up since the quest line was added?
---
I‚Äôd ignore the quest lines for now and focus on doing events in the forest and Toxic Valley and really exploring those areas thoroughly. There‚Äôs tons of unmarked locations and random encounters and enemies won‚Äôt be tough but xp is xp and you can slowly expand into the Mire and Ash heap until you reach your frustration limit. Craft lots and scrap and sell lots and you‚Äôll be sitting pretty in no time.
---
It seems I have developed a bit of a reputation ü§™
---
First of all ,thank you for the quick reply .
---
Seondly , how is it possible to heal yourself that quickly while under constant fire ?  And how can you defend yourself against somebody with those kind of perks and armor specifically ?
---
Satire? üëçüèª
---
If you have the deep pocket chest plan I've got 500c for you :)
---
This is an excellent post. I wish you luck on your mission sir.
---
Definitely agree with using nukes and dragons. Create the build you want so that you know what you‚Äôre working towards. Just randomly picking perks (kinda what I did with my first character) won‚Äôt be optimized and you might regret taking certain ones down the road.
---
Personally I think they should just rework the perk system. Have crafting/utility cards be a new passive card type that, once you unlock it, activates automatically when the associated stat total is above a certain level.
---
e.g; you have 1 base int and eat something to give you +1 int, hacking 1 activates while you have 2 int.
---
It'd be nice for sure. For now though, ask for a refund. I got one easy peasy because I didn't like how something looked in game.
---
Wrong. They do zoom. Left bumper does it.
---
I find building on an acid node helps a bunch as lead and steel are quite common; helps with producing lots and lots of ammo. I  find these spots the best as I use automatic weapons and use tons of ammo
---
Ok ,now i got it . Thanks so much . That is just insane!
---
Barely tho
---
Just crossed the 400 hour mark yesterday.  I'm level 104
---
Yup, patch jacked up workbenches.  Adding clicks to repair and the bugs.  smh
---
Odd. Hasn't worked on..
---
Golf Club, Assortment of Grognak Axes, Super Sledges, All Rise specifically, Machete, Combat Knife, etc.. no results with any of them.
---
my friend says you're welcome!
---
It‚Äôs a global issue, everyone‚Äôs experiencing it after the last patch. Hopefully it‚Äôs fixed by Tuesday.
---
I lost a set back right after launch, then after literally dropping everything on the floor the missing frame showed up sadly the armour was gone, maybe you‚Äôll have better luck
---
But you wrote that they have ‚Äúliterally‚Äù no zoom. They zoom in multiple times.
---
Update: After being logged in for over 2 hours, suddenly it now looks fine again. All members of my team also found that the textures now display correctly after the same amount of time passage. Are these explosion textures several TB in size or something? lol ... wow, that was a long load.
---
If this was added as an easy way to repair weapons and armor then I could
---
Live with but how is it rational to make it the only way to repair weapons.  This is EA level mobile gaming Pay to pay level stuff here.   Yes you can ‚Äúearn‚Äù atoms to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù these kits but this disproportionately targets and exploits low level or new players. The exact players that 76 needs.  I created a new character to help a friend I finally encouraged to play the game and then this shit drops.  Bethesda did a great job of evolving the game to be better then day one but this shit is game breaking and is my breaking point.  I have been playing since data one B.E.T.A.  And I defended the game, had my I am quitting this. Moments.  But if this is the only way I can repair my weapons and armor is wrong.  I always liked materials to repair items, the weight limit made it difficult but perks balanced that and I learned to embrace it.  Now this removes those perks I worked for.  So if this is a permanent change then I need perks to be removed and allow me to redistribute because I have perks that allow for repairs of my power armor, armor and weapons to be repaired to over 100% so with this new turn why do have to keep these perks taking up space?   Those are my rational arguments and as much as I think about it repair kits are nothing more than a money grab.  Again I would love to see them as an easy quick repair option, but to make it the only repair option is my objection.
---
Don‚Äôt binoculars only zoom once though?
---
You can permanently block, but it doesn't really do much. You can still be placed in servers with them and they can find your base even if they don't see your dot on the map.
---
I basically have played FO76 the same way I played Fallout IV, except, without some of the cool mods I really liked.
---
I've had a ton of fun in FO76 with over 90% of my playing being not related to PVP, not involving PVP.  
---
PVP has been a mixed bag - occasionally, it's been a ton of fun.  But, it's to often ludicrously unbalanced between players where it's like a baby fighting a bear, basically.  That's no fun, no matter which side I'm on (me being OP and feeling bad when I kill people too easy, or the other player being so OP that I'm basically irellevant fodder - both really suck.).
---
Crashes, disconnects, etc. have been fairly annoying but had not been enough to drive me away from the game yet.
---
As I've learned about how to make my build more able to compete in PVP, I've tried to work my way to a point where I'd be able to fight back vs some of these OP guys - but, "Pay To Win" seems to be coming and that ***is*** going to drive me away from the game and demand a refund, out of principle, even though I've gotten more than $60 worth of enjoyment from the game.
---
One at the train station, one at the Super Duper Mart.
---
You were talking about the new peepers and said they don‚Äôt zoom. They do. And it‚Äôs a decent zoom. Clicking left bumper does it. I m pretty sure it zooms in twice.
---
Bethesda won't stop until all the loot is gone.
---
Southern savage divide.
---
I noticed this as well. Although my "good with salt" is only level 1.
---
I have alot more spoiled food and vegetables lately leading to excess fertilizer.
---
I hope its corrected soon
---
I feel like they will eventually. Like take into consideration what happens at the top of the world during the story, I feel like that quest line is going to be used to explain the return of raiders to the wasteland. And all the people got killed off by the scorched plague,  which there is now a vaccine for, so this theoretically means that it would be somewhat safe for vaccinated people to return to Appalachia.
---
Perhaps they could add settlements that would be populated by human NPCs that would act as some sort of player hubs ?
---
This will be the death of the game then so I hope they are prepared for that.   Because that is what will happen if this continues
---
I suppose I could have done it wrong? But I‚Äôm pretty sure they zoom once and it‚Äôs a really small zoom almost looks like they only add a binoculars texture around the screen to make you think you‚Äôre zooming
---
I enjoy the game too but this aggression shall not stand, it is my breaking point.  I want to keep playing but I can not with this bullshit
---
I fully expect there to be a big farming update eventually. Partially because adding a bunch of new plants to the build menu is a very low effort content update haha.
---
If this is satire, its not funny because its written so poorly.
---
If this is serious, you joined SURVIVAL MODE. You get what you get.
---
hey, my CAMP is in that area, and I like it nice and quiet..don't muck up the neighborhood man!
---
The spamming of stims was negated in survival specifically to prevent this. You can have one of each active and that's it. It wasn't removed from adventure because it's common in PvE combat too. Having Field Medic (faster effect of stims/radaway) and First Aid (45% extra healing from stims) means they can stack very rapid, very powerful healing effects by spamming supers. The only way to counter this effectively is to either wait out their effect (which can be difficult) or deal more damage faster than they can heal it (if they're wearing A/S or A/C this can be nigh impossible)
---
Countering A/S and A/C has two main methods.  First is VATS. Crits bypass part of the effects. Aim for the head to maximize damage. The second is staggering. This method will be about the only option (apart from death by a thousand cuts) if they're stealthed (VATS won't work against crouched or invisible players). Staggering breaks the sent/cav effects momentarily, allowing you to do much more damage. There are perks to facilitate this.
---
Nope, they zoom twice, and zoom a fair bit.
---
Has been a while since I tested it. Used to have my camp above whitesprings on the west side of Solomon's pond (the one north of the behemoth). Could easily hit the clubhouse.  
---
Pretty sure elevation helps to hit further out. Again, haven't tested this in a while.
---
Sorry the game is perfect. My bad
---
Could you link to pictures of these items? I haven‚Äôt seen them!
---
Is that when you are overencumbered?
---
These were in the most recent datamined atom shop thread. I guess they'll release at some point over the next few weeks.
---
I haven't seen many rad storms either. Maybe they shud have an appalachian weather reporting system. Like a location u go to (or ur terminal) that tells u wind direction chance of rain etc
---
No? You cant fast travel while over encumbered
---
High quality bait.  Success.
---
Red Chinese flag
---
You are using them wrong. 
---
Equip them. Look through them using right trigger. Zoom using left bumper. I am in-game now using them and they zoom in twice.
---
Honestly dude, my opinion is that stuff I'm not going to buy, but it's their IP and they can do what they want. If someone wants it, they'll buy it, and that keeps the game going and other content being developed. If I had to pay for the Nuka Quantum PO skin from FO4, I'd probably pay for it even though I can get it in the old game.
---
Talk with your wallet, if you don't support it/don't want it, don't buy it, it's all optional.
---
Ive already logged off for the day but dm me when you're on
---
Its been a long time since I laughed this hard, thanks.
---
For anyone who thinks the Pearly Peepers don't have a zoom: hot the VATS button while you're looking through them. :)
---
This is exactly  my problem if Bethesda wants to sell repair kits as a fast repair to for repair kits than I am ok with that.  What I am not ok with is making it the only way to repair items.  That is not ok.
---
If you can manage to get a jetpack and bird bones, you can put your camp pretty much anywhere and get free travel. Put down spring traps facing the direction you want to travel, stand on trap (while in jetpack PA), activate trap. Will send you sailing, just boost along till you are where you need to be. May take practice.
---
That's legitimately funny as fuck. I wish more people did shit like that lol.
---
Holy crap, its Q on PC. I did not know this and just learned it. Holy smokes!
---
Idk how you haven't found any codes i have all 8 of them just running through the brotherhood quests
---
Ok some time tomorrow work for you. My Xbox gt is the same name.
---
300 something hours in the game and I‚Äôve found 2rad storms.  Killing a glowing creature in a rad storm is like winning the lottery for all of 10 atoms.
---
GT: Deftestbred45 shoot me a dm on here
---
To make it not objectively superior?
---
Everyone is saying Assassin Cavalier but I have seen this exact same thing happen to a guy that I fought who was wearing excavator armor.
---
Yeah they messed around with a few of the common key bindings. A lot of people have sold the peepers already because they thought they were useless. Wait people!!
---
And its only the peepers with zoom levels as well. I feel this should be addressed!
---
Thanks for the new idea lmao
---
Then you sanity is not going to last long :)
---
Wow .  I was not aware of any of it . 
---
I dont pvp and avoid workshops as much as possible but now and again i get murdered mostly thanks to my teammates who engage occasionally in pvp and by default i am marked too . Just really frustrated for not being able to defend myself, but now you have provided me with helpfull information so maybe i will be able to become a little less helpless :) thank you !
---
Check the audio settings in game, I say this because every time I log in I have to turn the volume for chat back up. Hope's this helps.
---
Turned up chat volume and everything?
---
It‚Äôs about balance. Use unyielding get more special, have less damage resistance. Use vanguard or bolstering have more damage resistance but have less special
---
I did the same as OP. A few weeks ago I finally decided to purchase the game and give it a shot. I put in about 50 hours into the game and tbh I found myself not enjoying myself at all and overall regretting my purchase. I'm not gonna go into details for my reasons since I don't want to beat a dead horse. 
---
Regardless of my experience, I do agree with OP. You have to come to your own conclusions and can't always take other people's opinions as fact.
---
Me too man, been repeating those same old events so much trying to get the outfits and absolutely zero luck
---
I feel bad for you but you did get the option between PVE and PVP, you chose PVP so you cant complain when you get killed by a player.
---
You should definitely at least give it a chance. Add me on xbox if you have one!
---
They‚Äôre going to eventually do it so stop asking already.
---
Yes, I will, but is alright if I do it later?
---
I think the issue is the "entry fee" of 2k-2.4k caps. Like, no one wants to risk that much and potentially get nothing in return for it...or risk starting it and not having anyone join to help out.
---
I have not been able to get in and play since patch.  When I can get in the map is empty.  I have tried everything since something is fdup.
---
I have played for 500+ hours and never even seen a cavalier /sentinel so i   find it hard to believe that too but hey , maybe its just my luck ...or lack of it to be exact .
---
Yeah I'm actually upset about it too. I'm honestly surprised we weren't given a response to this.
---
Seems like the busiest areas are the worst. Tried Survival the day after the hotfix. It was almost entirely unplayable. Players and structures not fully rendered, inexplicable death after a hitching incident, etc. 
---
Ok, so tried a silo run. Had a few stutters along the way, but nothing too bad until I got to the control room. Evidently things still proceed as normal server side as it froze for a few seconds and I was downed by a bunch of bots that hadn't been that close previously after things started moving again. Nuke zone didn't seem too bad other than nothing appeared to spawn a second time.
---
Where did you find him?
---
Can I have a source for that? if it is fact that still doesn't change the fact that i'm getting around 10+ legendary items per run. Where is the balance? There's nothing legendary about it, it's in fact common.  I know people would be against it being changed because they obviously like it and it;s no surprise why...  There's no sense of accomplishment at all running through white springs and getting all of those 1\* legendary items from non legendary mobs.  Finding a 3 star feels good and the build up to what it might drop feels good. When it;s that one item that's just epic then it's a real sense of accomplishment.  I would expect between 1-3 legendary mobs per run with 1-3\* variation. Right now it;s just stupid and a clear balancing problem that's being ignored.

After lv.50 you can pick a perk card or move a special point from one special to another but you can not have more than 15 points on any one special. As far as server affects I dont know.
---
Of course! Take your time :)

On my latest trip bringing my kids to visit their grandparents in Japan I brought back an old RC helicopter their uncle had in the attic.  I don't know if I'll get it repaired and working or not, but I remember drooling after them in magazines when I was a kid.
---
"Toy grade" RC card are finally actually getting pretty good, picked up a pair of $100 RTR 4WD RC trucks for my kids at half price when amazon (accidentally?) combined a "flash sale" with a very good coupon discount.
---
I hated school up until my last couple of years of high school, to pass the time I would daydream and doodle, one of the things I would draw was an RC tank with suction cup treads that could go along walls and cielings with an FPV nightvision camera, and sometimes some type of gun, either a modified handgun, or a dart gun. 
---
I imagined it would be used as some type of espionage device.  This was around 1985 or so that I was making those drawings.  I also thought it would be fun to make a small plane that would be controlled by a cat.  I didn't imagine it would actually work - I assumed the cat would just be too fucking scared.  But, maybe, who knows?  Some dogs love to skate board, maybe a cat would love to fly and catch birds *in the air*?

Back to the MTX - I view them as basically just as bad as drug dealers selling crack.  I know the "war on drugs" is an abysmal failure, but that doesn't mean we stop trying to stop crack/meth/heroin dealers, or let them sell in our homes/neighborhoods, right?
---
It's time to stop letting companies get away with doing bad things "because capitalism", time to stop letting the few wealthy control the majority/corrupt our govt.  One person one vote, fuck Citizen's United.

We are brothers in arms, comrades and the living embodiment of Don Quixote. Welcome to do as you like with the data. I‚Äôll look at yours tomorrow. GF and I are catching up on GoT tonight.

If you have plenty of stims, the spamming is most effective in PA as there is no animation, just be aware the hot key uses the weakest one in your inventory, which is usually dilutes if you have them.

Dear kind sirs and madames of the FO76 moderation team!   
---
For your consideration I present to you an idea:
---
In regards to the stance of not making a user's post sticky on account of their likely and inevitable abandonment of said thread, I hereby formally request that a very-active member of this sub and also very active player of Fallout 76, be welcomed into the Moderation Team either fully, or partially, in effort to better help both the community *and* Bethesda by being granted the capability of running a "Bug Report Sticky Thread". As evident by said thread's title, it would be to track and document current bugs in the game, as well as help determine the validity of user submitted bugs by way of testing. 
---
Their title, therefore, is only fitting to be that of "Bug Hunting Moderator", or something equally catchy, but to-the-point. If the term "moderator" instills too much authority, then perhaps a rank which simply permits the capabilities to sticky their own thread and have a title of something to the effect of "Bug Hunter", "Cataloger of Bugs", "Bug Master Flash", and/or something-witty-etcetera-etcetera.
---
As such, I hereby officially nominate /r/fo76 user /u/Aten_Ra for this positons, as they have shown on at least two occasions in my short teneur on this subreddit to be all about helping the community and the game through their efforts in tracking down and documenting issues with Fallout 76! Example one is this very thread. Example two is related to [Fasnacht Masks](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5h3vj/pc_i_really_think_there_is_a_error_in_the/). Both of which are very thourough and well formatted. He is a testament to our community!
---
Thank you for your time! :)  
---
   \- *A humble FO76 player*

I got the plans as well, and I have a salvaged assaultron head, but it doesn't show up at all in the workbench repair/modify menu.  That might be where the trouble is, that it registers like some items that don't have modifications and only show up in the menu when they're below 100% durability.
---
near the freestates bunker (the most northern one i forget) if you go down the road south i believe you can find 2 glowing wendigos hanging off vehicles tangled in vines
---
I‚Äôve had this happen entering power armor.
---
U on still?
---
sauce?
---
It is known.
---
That‚Äôs where the real Sheepsquatch is actually located.
---
Yup, balance. I would like to add PvP is large aspect of this balance. And fighting someone with maxed out everything across the board would be too OP. It puts everyone on a level playing field.
---
On the PvE side of things (this is my opinion) it encourages team play while not forcing it. For example the new event would be a completely differnt ball game. The fair majority of players would all have friendly fire and other perks in the charisma to maximize DPS/ healing output. Having the cap at 50 really does make each toon unique to a certain degree.
---
Rationalizing Bethesda babying players with roleplay as an excuse has to be one of the stupidest things I have ever seen.
---
Bethesda doesn't give a shit which system better suits your RP fantasy, they did it because people were just complaining a lot so they went into overkill mode, just like cramming every single vendor in a single location.
---
How realistic is your roleplay that it makes any sense at all for your "skilled craftsman" to stumble on a robot vendor that just happens to sell step by step instructions on how to precisely replicate all the pre-war tech you want using nothing bits of scrap metal you picked up off the ground?
---
&gt; Cheating requires breaking the game rules, and if you're buying power off the MTX shop, you're not breaking the game rules.
---
To me that is a faulty rationalization and dishonest.
---
I don't agree, that just because the devs are selling the unfair advantage instead of a third party, now it's suddenly not cheating.
---
I just got a couple by doing the Lyle Lowe (sp?) quest.
---
Same.
---
I actually read the whole thing.  One of the best posts on the subreddit in a long time, and I wish I had the coins to give you a gold or platinum.
---
I'm an event guy myself, and I agree with every single thing you wrote.  Very informative.  I probably do 10 or so a day.
---
What's your take on the shielded raider plans?  I've been doing every event that appears in Savage Divide largely to get that specific plan and at this point I'd think it was a fairy tale, if there wasn't the odd person selling shielded suits on Market76 once in a while.
---
Drinking 50 beverages should be a weekly not daily.
---
yes. me too
---
Not right now on my way to the gym how long you gonna be on tonight
---
Na brav I already asked around reddit, youtube and in game but nobody knows how to get other plans for em.
---
Make a new set. Shouldn't take you all that long.
---
Yes. Son of Fluffy is part of one of the new side quests. It's partially related to Lying Lowe.
---
I‚Äôll protect you mlady?
---
Wat
---
My bad, I didn't actually read the post. Do the unsolved cases count as the law quests?
---
That's some vicious T-baggery...
---
probably have to wait for 16 then
---
Yeah it just requires a lot of materials, specifically black titanium which is hard to find
---
ohhhhh, I that makes sense, I thought I was crazy, I logged in one day, and all of a sudden I had three outfits I never saw before and had no idea where I got them... all three from uranium fever eh? thanks for the info :)
---
I can say after 800 hours it gets easier. ü§™
---
Once a drug dealer starts seeing the sort of cash they can make selling crystal meth, or fentanyl, what would they say if you said: "please don't do that, it's bad" if they knew that you couldn't call the cops on them and you couldn't stop them yourself - they would probably just decide they didn't want to speak to you about their business anymore, maybe?  
---
To me, selling MTX, particularly when it's PTW or "loot chests" with random prizes, the devs become no better than crack dealers.
---
yes, you can get 4 heads from quests but looks like there is no way to get other ones
---
It's all the way up right when I log in, I've tried the settings set at Auto, Area, and Team and none of them seem to work
---
I'm at 450 myself, I agree... but this would still be appreciated! üòÉ
---
Wow, a lot of work by our resident addict, well done. Carefully proofread as well, thank you! (Typo in UQ‚Äôs name, ahem.)
---
Please let me ask you this: When you die and lose your addictions, is there any ‚Äòhangover‚Äô period of lingering effects, or upon respawn are you fully recovered? You mentioned that you seem to be more susceptible to re-addiction if you get high again right away. But any other lingering effects?
---
I ask because, we‚Äôll let‚Äôs just say a friend of mine has a sweet 3* Junkie Lever with Crit Damage. Mightn‚Äôt he go Junkie for a lark until he dies, then respawn fully recovered to go back to his usual play style? Or will he be feeling sick such that the only way to get right is to start using again? 
---
Also, I think I‚Äôve asked you this before but please remind my tired, limited mind, when you‚Äôre addicted to these chems and carry around their respective debuffs, do those go away each time you take one of the chems? And further, do you then receive the buff from each chem to which you are addicted? 
---
Thanks again for the info. You‚Äôre the Junkie Man.
---
Always wondered if more than 3* is possible since there are 5 so thanks for confirming.
---
What are you playing on?
---
Check other posts by this guy.
---
ok what plans
---
Make sure your Xbox one is on Game chat and not party chat
---
Idk probably till 1
---
Yeah ok that makes a lot of sense from a game-making and actual gameplay perspective. I just found it fun too randomly make my specials ridiculously high in fallout 4 because who doesn‚Äôt love strength 200?
---
Any idea how to obtain them?
---
Same thing happened to me, submitted a ticket to Bethesda with no response but it‚Äôs definitely a bug. I logged out a few days prior to patch 8 dropping, as I had work related stuff to do and just never got around to returning to 76. I logged in two days ago to finish the quest and do the new questline and it was gone, and no amount of logging in, reading the poster, repeating the steps of the quest on my own, etc. triggered the quest so until Bethesda fixes it, were screwed
---
Happens to me too
---
Sorry, PC
---
RNG is fine so long as a legendary mob drops a legendary item (I wouldn't mind if a 1\* had a chance to drop nothing.) I mean we have non legendary mobs dropping legendary items and legendary mobs dropping nothing. It's nonsense.  Legendary is supposed to be something that's rare and rewarding even if it's a garbage roll item, it's still unique to the typical base items.  I can put in hours on legendary runs and get almost nothing, go to white springs and get an inventory full in 5 minutes. No one wants to complain because they benefit from it. I don't care, i'll happily say it;s a problem that needs to be fixed. There's more to this game than a golf course. Bethesda might as well add is a Donald trump mask for all those boring people that sit there all day.
---
Can u modify Armor too have unyielding or am I gunna have too farm a stupid amount of 3 star legendaries for my 1 Star Armor...
---
An excellent question...there is a ‚Äúhangover‚Äù negative effect you get from consuming alcohol which activates after the cool down, I‚Äôll find a place to add that to the body of the post
---
Interesting read. Don‚Äôt see many people with this build! I‚Äôm partial to AA weapons myself, but all I use are rifles. They stack so well with tank killer. I do bloodied level damage at full health essentially
---
Thanks for your empathy. :-)
---
vertical blur fo76 (google that)
---
*pets white cat* why do you act so disrespectful...
---
I play on ps4 or I would try to chat with you.
---
So if I have strength 11 and charisma 9 after level fifty I can swap them when I level up? Or even whenever I like?
---
Raiders!
---
I currently have 7 from playing over the past day and have also had 2 Nukes a day over this past week
---
It spawned at or near enough to my base that it aggroed on my tamed deathclaw. I'm nearby Alpha Silo and Fred's BBQ Shack.
---
You can move 1 point from any special to another every time you lv up after 50
---
I think I have one, or maybe just sold it to a vendor. Are you on PS4?
---
Oh, that's fun. My base is right where Tracking Terror ends, I guess he'll be a somewhat common guest.
---
Go for it lol don‚Äôt need to worry about armor
---
Yea I admit I have an AAE Weapon for every one of my Junky Weapons which originally was to hedge my bet...never use them lol
---
You can have my vote
---
Normal : All Junk
---
Survival: Presumable all junk and 25% of your aid items
---
I‚Äôd be curious if you compared junkie‚Äôs to AA weapons. The issue with AA is that the damage shown when you equip it is not actual. You would actually have to shoot someone to see what damage the two do against each other.
---
I like to PvP a lot. It seems junkies would be such a pain in the ass if you lose addictions.
---
That word gets thrown around to loosely now a days
---
I think they might just add more legendary mods, leaving the two slots open. That way, you can put 2 choice effects on your weapon instead of having to farm the event until you get a good 5 star.
---
It makes no sense to call it "Win" - it's not winning to me.  
---
Paying to skip ahead, without actually playing to "earn" the next level (being vague here on purpose) - well if we take that to it's "final form" then you simply pay thousands of dollars to get a screen which says "YOU WIN!", and the other player's game gets shut off and now his screen says "YOU LOSE, LOSER".
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I mean, so sometimes if I need that information I have to back out and open it again. :(
---
Buyer's special
---
Yea that‚Äôs the exact reason why I didn‚Äôt include AA in the study simply because it would have been difficult to get decent information on my own, if there is a hierarchy I‚Äôd guess Bloodied is at the top followed by AA, bZerk, and Junky with twoshot bringing up the rear
---
That crouching up and down is called teabagging son. It simulates a ballsack being dunked into the open mouth of your dead corpse. Presumably if you‚Äôre killed, you die with your mouths open in an expression of pain and shock. That is the perfect opportunity for someone to dunk their two balls into your mouth.
---
I‚Äôm on pc, not using any mods. The bug is just a part of the base game, though I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if mods add even more bugs.
---
I would agree with that. I hate bloodied and bezerkers build myself
---
But I would love a feature to hide certain map markers or as you said search for them. 
---
I guess they just at the moment go to work everyday with hundreds of things to fix some of the QOL changes are gonna be long in the future. I dont mind if we then get a less buggy game faster but I do admit some features has its flaws.
---
Worst one in my opinion is trading menu when trading with players. That you cannot inspect anything in their inventory. üò≠
---
Playtime paint is best paint UwU
---
But i love shooting raiders in the face
---
How does it track targets? What button?
---
Zoom in on an enemy and it will track with a diamond on them when you hokd it for a second or 2
---
&gt; Can I have a source for that?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apfqw2/did_anyone_else_notice_that_the_ghouls_at_the/
---
(Many other topics and comments about it.  Usually a "Wow, this Diseased Ghoul just dropped a Legendary!" with a "Ya, cause it was a 0-star legendary ghoul."
---
&gt;if it is fact that still doesn't change the fact that i'm getting around 10+ legendary items per run. Where is the balance? There's nothing legendary about it, it's in fact common.
---
Welcome to the Garbage Legendary Farm that is Whitespring.  Ghouls there spawn as No-Star Legendary very often, even when not a Nuke Zone.  And they drop tons of 1* garbage.  People drop that garbage off in the ice cooler by the club house and in the containers around the Whitespring Station.
---
Though it is not unique to Whitespring.  Ghouls everywhere can do it.  I find Diseased Ghouls in Camp Venture that are actually Legendary.  The Ghouls there can spawn 0-3* at times.  And occasionally the 0-Star is a Diseased.
---
It's similar to when you have a Light/Sturdy/Heavy item, then you apply a mod to it.  Like Heavy Leather Chest, modded to be Deep Pocketed and Studded.  Now it just says "Deep Pocketed Studded Leather Chest".  But it's still Heavy, and is different than a "Deep Pocketed Studded Leather Chest" that happened to start as Light or Sturdy.
---
Problem is ya can‚Äôt balance them both equally... most games I have played or all never get this right
---
The bunker sells gatling laser mods though not sure if I have seem that mode for sale
---
I've been low key spamming peoples camps with flamingos every time I get a random team invite...
---
I'm guessing that it's on your end. I play a lot and also am on PS4. I was on when the server dropped once this afternoon. I think I was online about 4 hours. 
---
Had one blue screen several days ago. And maybe one orher server drop within the past couple of weeks. I play amost every day.
---
I have the same exact placement and can confirm it stretches from the West to the White Springs Clubhouse and then from the East to the West Tek Research Center. From there, you can get a pretty good idea of the circumference of the range. I cannot confirm if elevation has anything to do with I.
---
You can do both on PS4.
---
Perm block is at the system level, I think. Not in the game.
---
Don't forget about doors floating a bit off the frames on the brick set.  Or the inability to make a straight line of neon letters.  Or the small letters clipping through the brick and disappearing.
---
I would
---
Say ok to that if they made power armor half as fast as legendary or no sprint
---
They stack bub I‚Äôm sitting on hundreds of weapons
---
Every time I get a random team request, I spam their camp with flamingos. It's probably my favorite thing to do in the entire game. And now you've got me giving away my secrets...
---
Well...  it wasn't the next patch but it's happened.
---
So you can make junk, weapons or whatever weightless? Damn, guess I‚Äôd better compete a set then. Thanks.
---
The hats were fun while they lasted..what really bothered me was when they devalued raw flux
---
I got plans to make The Fixer which was pretty cool being ableto craft it at max level.  Has anyone gotten the mounted head plans from this event?  I heard a lot of conjecture that they must come from here but have not seen confirmation yet.
---
I disagree, rng this rare keeps rare loot well you know rare
---
Let's say its a "puzzle" game.  If your game has levels, and one level is too hard, you might cheat to skip that level.  So if the dev sells a way to skip levels, now we can't call it cheating anymore?  I say we ***should*** still call it what it is, in sprit - don't deny the weight of this word "cheat" just because there's a loophole that some people feel should let them not call it cheating - now it's OK, because the company sold it to me.  No, I don't accept that.
---
I've probably got over 700 hours (just guessing) and have seen a radstorm maybe a handful of times since the first BETA Thursday, and one of which was on that first day.
---
It would be cool if a nuke launch initiated a worldwide radstorm immediately after detonation.  That would be something that players could control and plan for.
---
Maybe you‚Äôre just really bad at this game? Just sayin‚Äô.
---
weight reduction stops at 90% no matter what perks cards or legendary perks you have
---
As far as I know it won‚Äôt go past 90% reduced. I wear 4 pieces of fdc reduced and carry tons of chems.
---
Gave me a chuckle there. 
---
Just yesterday had my second TS drop and a LMG too (Heavy weapon build). Then I see it's two star and the heart rate rises even more. Added bash damage :/ Oh well, at least it's two shot.
---
Close to 250 hours now and only gotten one exploding drop and no TSE's.
---
Yeah of course but they stack
---
This looks really cool. I love the idea! How do I get the link to the discord?
---
at least 20k
---
Thanks for the insight.
---
I'm talking about garden plots dipshit
---
...yeahhhhh you druggie lol
---
I have a full power armor guy .. all the time power armor on.
---
I also have a armor guy that only puts on power armor for nuke zones
---
I would be for power armor having legendary effects if you would change it too have one of these weaknesses 
---
1. No sprint or  you could move half as fast as regular armor
---
2.  Not give a free 12 strength
---
Let‚Äôs be honest power armor has some really great benefits like free strength for carrying, great rad resist, and great mods for its parts.... also great dr and er
---
Regular armor has great defenses, better sneak, and is better at pvp
---
My take is have a set of each depending on situation
---
It's not that hard to see a title about the main quest and know you don't want to read anything about the main quest.
---
&gt; Don't forget about doors floating a bit off the frames on the brick set.
---
This was fixed a couple patches ago.  They don't float off the wall with a visible gap anymore.
---
Another player has to view the contents of the bag to make it persist after you log off. I think.
---
They plan to sell you the upcoming fridge in the atomic shop to store things so they dont spoil, thats the only explanation i can think as to why they increased the rate in which foodstuffs degrade.  
---
They will leave it in there long enough so people like you get fed up and cheer when the fridge gets added in the Atom Store.
---
Uh? Contesting a workshop isn‚Äôt griefing, though?
---
I rarely have a workshop contested, but it‚Äôs almost always the munitions factory for obvious reasons.
---
Does your fdc redux still work when you also have the perk card equipped that does the same? Mine doesn't, figure its a bug because weapon weight redux seems to stack with perk cards and the legendary effect.
---
I have a good solution for Bethesda: make atoms tradable between players.
---
You make good points and currently having a set of different situations is what is currently needed.
---
Xbox here too. "Sandhog"
---
It's a good game with multiple chances to try to exploit the core. Then bitch about it being trash. I played the game without looking for ways to cheat it, and always had a good time with it.
---
I don't get much time but usually hit it around 7-8 pm est . Only level 46 but having fun.
---
There are garden plots on top of the buildings in various towns, but you think we can't grow plants because of technical coding, and you're calling me the dipshit?
---
You know I a dude right
---
Asset=/=Working asset for player use
---
..... so not true... it takes what a hour of holding a power plant to get plenty of full cores
---
Not sure. All my perks are used up on other things. Now I‚Äôm curious though and will mess around with it.
---
I can see that. It seems like Bethesda and the museum have a pretty good working relationship, though- the museum store sells some 76 stuff and has promoted the game in the past. Plus, as someone else pointed out, there's already a fo76 Mothman Funko pop.
---
cranberries are the key all food and drinks made with them gives a xp bonus
---
200 a pop! I'll let you know what I've got when I get home!(in the next half hour)

I know I've got marsupial left for sure but unsure about the others
---
&gt; On my latest trip bringing my kids to visit their grandparents in Japan I brought back an old RC helicopter their uncle had in the attic. I don't know if I'll get it repaired and working or not, but I remember drooling after them in magazines when I was a kid.
---
I'd dearly love to have one, but there's two reasons why I don't.
---
* They generally don't bounce when they crash. THey just undergo spontaneous rapid unplanned disassembly.
---
* It's nigh impossible to get a fuel-burning RC heli that isn't one of those spastic 3D things. I don't want that. I want to fly the news chopper, or a skycrane, or Airwolf. I do have a micro heli though, 7" span bought off BAnggood. full 6ch and capable of 3D, but it's a scale model and I fly it as such.
---
&gt; 
---
Yeah I've been tempted to grab a WLToys 1/18 or 1/24 model for some time now. They've come so far I hesitate to even call them toy grade. Fully proportional controls, replaceable parts, upgradeable, tough-as-nails and fast besides...they're, at least to me, 'cheap hobby grade' rather than 'toy grade'.
---
The A959b is a little monster, too. Right out of the box that fucker'll do something like 25MPH and shrug off skate parks like it's nothing.
---
&gt; I need to get another source of income so I can afford to blow time and money on home made foam core RC aircraft - looks like so much fun now that brushless motors and lipo batteries give us plenty of power to weight without having to use a gas burning engine (those are cool, just not always practical). 
---
Funny you mention that, because I've built two Flite Test kits *and both have gotten internal combustion power*. FT Spear with two throttleable Cox 0.049s in pusher config, alongside tricycle landing gear, and an FT Mini Sportster with a single throttleable 0.049 in the nose.
---
I love engines. I could power them electrically, but I just don't want to. IT ain't the same grin factor unless it's screeching along like a banshee or buzzing like an entire swarm of pissed off bees.
---
&gt; Back to the MTX - I view them as basically just as bad as drug dealers selling crack. I know the "war on drugs" is an abysmal failure, but that doesn't mean we stop trying to stop crack/meth/heroin dealers, or let them sell in our homes/neighborhoods, right?
---
I'm not saying we should just 'shrug and accept it', I'm saying we should stop buying games that have MTX in them. And that's pretty much meaning we stop buying games in general, because that's the direction the industry is headed and unless it experiences another crash like it did just before the NES came out it's probably not going to change course on its own.
---
*And it's most likely to experience that crash if the majority of the people playing games stop buying alltogether.*
---
Thing that already exists, in various games Bethesda makes, and yet you think Bethesda can't make thing. Ok buddy.
---
Sadly, I've never gotten a random team request.
---
Dunno yet but it you fine a crew lemme know! I dont look it but I do good dps whenever she lends &gt;_&gt;
---
If it was codes the same, I would agree. Considering however they where in development at the same time they clearly branched out in coding structure a long time ago
---
yes but you made it sound like it stacked to 100% thats what he was asking
---
I got 2 cards but have never done a silo myself lol
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone knew that, no.
---
Rehashed post of an earlier one by the same person.
---
This, is the real game. If your clever you can clip wind chimes into foundations as well.
---
That's no issue, if you have them unlocked I'll run one with you to show you! Should be home shortly

Oh but no queen unless we have the firepower... massive waste otherwise
---
After having had my consumable buffs negated for so long when logging out, I do not server hop (barring the occasional CTD when using a consumable item.) Luckily, the logout buff removal bug seems to have been corrected with the latest patch.
---
Then why are there FO4 bugs in this game, if the coding is so different?
---
FO76 doesn‚Äôt have an option to select an audio input device. So it uses your computers default. Make sure your default is set to your headset/microphone.  I had this same problem. Nothing was listed as an input device it was just (default) which was nothing. Even though it worked with discord and overwatch
---
&gt; Crashes, disconnects, etc. have been fairly annoying but had not been enough to drive me away from the game yet.
---
I've only got 8GB of ram. Total. Windows 7 and Fallout 76 tend to have *words* when the latter has gone from using 4.5gb at first spawn to something around 6.5-6.75gb(roughly an hour into a sesh). These words...almost always mean my computer tries to lock up.
---
Could be alleviated easily enough if I could afford to buy more ram, alas, I cannot so I gotta play with what I've got. And that, alone, makes it a little bit annoying to try to play 76.
---
I don't even understand why, either, because 4 runs on the same engine and doesn't have that memory leak *despite being modded so severely it takes a good 4-5 minutes to load up the first time*.

I fix/maintain yao guai, death claw, mirelurk queen, scorch beast, glowing and mutant hound steaks. These are easy enough items to obtain, but, with the rapid degradation of foodstuffs of late, one has to almost stay in a retrieval loop to keep them on hand. Maybe it's just I focus on keeping too many of each on hand (hoarding complex I suppose.) I should *probably* correct my own habits in conjunction with the food decay, heh.
---
Heh
---
Yes.  I ran into someone I blocked months ago for blowing up my camp with an explosive shotgun, who again one-shotted me with a power fist while I was collecting ammo at the Munitions Factory.  My team-mate ported in to get revenge and retrieve my loot, but they alt+f4ed out before he could kill them.  Way too fast to be a fast travel or server hop.
---
Cool, hopefully a few more people chime in :)
---
Clear jello in the toilet... Muhahaha
---
I've just been taking workshops on the left side of the map.  There's the occasional person there looking to kill anyone in sight, but for the most part, people just want to do the defense events and move on.  They give you a good chunk of xp and if you do get killed it's really not that big of a deal.
---
Great addition. This definitely adds some control if it would seem too OP which it obviously can be.
---
The FDC reduction ability and the perks do stack additively. For example if you have two points in Travelling Pharmacy and one piece of FDC armor, Stimpaks weigh 0.2. Add another piece of FDC armor and they drop to 0.1 (or the same as Travelling Pharmacy 3), but that's as low as it'll go.
---
Weapon weight reduction stacks differently: WW armor reduces the weight of weapons \*after\* the perks are applied. For example a 20lb Gatling would drop to 4.8lb with two points of Bear Arms and two pieces of WW armor. I can't be sure where it caps, because I didn't have enough perks or WW armor spare when I tested.
---
Don't know if the horn is intended to be that way, but with the Hero Statue, anyone that visits always sees my explosion and vice versa.
---
Which ones are you looking for? So I know which to gather up?
---
Sentient deathclaws are a thing in the Fallout lore. I somehow missed it when I played but there's a vault of them in Fallout 2. Bethesda should bring them back.
---
So adventure mode a patch ago is what you want?
---
If not we will run the silo and judge the power before launching ;) no use rushing and I'll just guide you so you can do it alone afterwards
---
The 29 levels for sure. At higher levels you can level really fast. Drop a nuke farm Wes tek any number of exp farms while low levels have to do basic shit just to hit 50 before they can start to farm exp.
---
Whatever bud I don't beleive any of this you could have just logged out
---
I don't know how to reply to that.
---
Sounds a lot like what us Enclave are doing! If you ever wish to join up or ally this initiative just hit me up!
---
It‚Äôs a bug, they will patch it. 
---
Here to say, I am as well effected by the disappearing Nukashine quest.
---
The cards in each group would be ones you only have unlocked. It could be OP but the main reason i thought about it was mainly to not forget to switch to crafting or hard bargain when I'm mid way selling stuff.
---
Sounds good. I tried it a long time ago when I was like lvl 60 w/shit gear and perks and made it to the end and died lol
---
It can still happen though.  A guy I blocked months ago wound up being on the same server today, caught me at a workshop, one shotted me immediately after initiating a contest, took all my junk, then quickly server hopped or force quit the game after my buddy showed up to get my bag back.
---
I wasn't there, but he said he had the guy trapped in a small room, just about to kill them, then they just disappeared instantly.
---
You can swap one special point at a time at the cost of one perk point
---
Interesting. I had two different people on two different servers say they couldn‚Äôt see it or it‚Äôs explosion. Neither of them had purchased the item themselves. Both could see the horn but not hear it and they both had purchased the horn. 1 was a teammate and the other wasn‚Äôt. I wonder if owning it is part of the difference. I guess I‚Äôll have to test it more.
---
Don't get me started on that!
---
That‚Äôs a weird way to find sheepsquatch meat xD.
---
Marsupial and speed demon mostly
---
Well, that's great news!  Maybe I'll switch back from barn walls.
---
What specific point are you disagreeing with? RNG with legendary mobs? There's no argument. They have a legendary title for a reason.
---
Console only. Console gamers are at a huge disadvantage against PC gamers.
---
Also find this argument really funny since before Bethesda found out about it, we were able to plant crops in fires and carpets, but you think because of coding we can't place crops in dirt planters.
---
I can see this being implemented for Halloween time.
---
Stick close to the train stations and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
The guarantee, the mobs they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have legendary‚Äù in the name they do, it‚Äôs taken up by diseased  and pushed off too the side
---
I'm with you that daily challanges shouldnt be completely up to rng.  The only point I disagree with is the drink alcohol while level 21 or greater; either you have a character over level 21 or you're a brand new account and are getting the hundreds of atoms we all got when we started.  I had over 2k atoms before I even knew how to check what the daily's were.
---
How does if taste?
---
That's what I'm thinking too. Now I just have to decide if I want PER 15 so that I can max out my rifle stuff, including Tank Killer and Glow Sights at the SAME TIME, or I could drop to 12 so that I could throw some convenience points on STR. I'm used to STR 5, and I'll have to drop to STR 3 for my tweaks.
---
Anyway thanks for the reply!
---
Server hop
---
One of my good in-game friends has a penchant for "interior design", and loves "sprucing up" her friends' camps and the odd random person we see at events that accepts a team invite.  Giant statues, neon letters that say THOTS WELCOME, littering all the floors to confetti, stuff like that.
---
I'm gonna apologize coz i am one of those dickheads that runs around dying ( i mean i do run around nude with no armor....) I tried activating pylons because I at least knew that from beginning but...I still didn't get it.  Sometimes I go on there and given no choice to activate, and when i do i try to find sheep and attack it but no dmg...might have taken to long to look for it?  Still no clue wtf to do lol, are there suppose to be three pylon users or something?  I mean it was my first time doing it and no one was really talking in mic explaining anything lol.
---
If you hear lots of gunfire, go the other way. Most of the fighting is pretty well contained to small areas, most often around Vault 76 and Whitespring Station, though any spawn point can be dangerous. Avoid them and most people you run into will probably be doing the same as you, offer to team up with people that show up at your defenses. 
---
Don‚Äôt keep lots of aid or junk on you. Build a workbench and a stash at every workshop to constantly dump resources. If you limit your risk like that, dying isn‚Äôt a big deal.
---
I made a post about this and they replied they are aware and looking into it .
---
I rarely run glow sights. I deal enough damage to the ghouls already and I want to let other people around me get hits. Any other glowing enemies don‚Äôt need the extra damage because they are already so week
---
Yes, this.
---
Dumb post
---
TBH I feel like "power armor wearing rifleman" is a suboptimal concept in this game. The big advantage with rifles is that you can kill stuff easily from stealth. Non-stealth rifles works to some degree but you'll get through a lot of ammo.
---
With that said, you'll want one of either Blocker or Starched Genes, depending on whether you'd rather evade packs of melee enemies with Marsupial and/or Speed Demon, or just sit there while they smack you in the face.
---
The other one made me breath out of nose a bit harder as it was almost amusing. This is just pathetic, learn to troll please and thank you
---
Balloons, confetti, garland, Helvetia garland and I think the flag pole
---
Pretty sure the neon letters has been fixed
---
Everyone I know loves Mothman.  I love mothman.  I saw that a vinyl mothman toy exists the other day, and I think I need it.  The last toy I bought was probably 20 years ago.
---
I'd probably buy a stuffed Mothman toy, also.  If the mothman sleeping bag was real, I'd buy that too.
---
I'm definitely going to check that. Thank you!
---
Drop a nuke on Morgantown tons of ghouls. Or just farm Wes Tek over and over.
---
Looks like I'm going to have to get in touch with tec support. What is your Gauss damage at 100% health? Just to see if it's starting at a lower damage for some reason. I did change my mutation serum when it was bugged but i also run with quite a few others (Im level 225) Wonder if these are causing some issue so I think I will temove all and reapply only the basic ones like you have and see if this fixes it.
---
LOL.  They used alubnimum, titerniam and stiel they got from a Chinese street salesman on Canal Street.
---
&gt;Rationalizing Bethesda babying players 
---
What a load of bullshit. 
---
They aren't babying anyone.   The best plans cost 5,800 caps with all three levels of hard bargain plus stabilized flux. 
---
If you claim that there's anything easy about getting several sets of  plans with those kinds of prices and crafting requirements then you are trolling, plain and simple.   
---
T60 and T51 jetpack plans are  now available 24/ 7 from the brotherhood vendor.  To see anyone walking around with  either of them is still a rarity. 
---
That's because getting the caps for the plans and the needed flux is not easy.
---
My main gripes so far: blue screens, lag when switching weapons using the hotkey, getting stunned for no fucking reason when hit with a melee attack, if anything we should get knocked back, and the limit to our stash
---
Ok, I don't know how to explain this to you so that you will understand. 
---
Games dropping a few unique items from bosses is not the same kind of guaranteed drop as always wanting a 3*. Those few items are the exception to the rule. You get a SPECIFIC ITEM. One single item. Not a guaranteed drop out of the highest end of the drop pool. 
---
It's not the same thing. 
---
So take the Anni "guaranteed" drop. It comes from one source. And always has the same types of modifiers (though the value of some of those can change).
---
The equivalent in 76 is not a guaranteed 3* roll. It's more like the All Rise for example. Specific item. Comes from one source. Has the same modifiers. 
---
You'd be looking at that kind of drop, not a guaranteed 3 *
---
I agree on this one..yep playing sniper need to keep melee at a distance..i will take 2 cards back from that.
---
This happened to me twice today.
---
Or... You could've just switched servers...
---
Yeah same, I haven‚Äôt had any food problems.
---
I hate all PVP in this game. I was intrigued, though not totally for it, by the PVP upon the game's announcement but it has been a huge failure.
---
Sometimes he flees, sometimes he fights.  At some point you'll probably have a weapon that can one-hit kill him, which is preferable.  Mothman is a bad motherf\*cker when you make him angry.
---
Unless I have to fight one, I usually just leave these majestic creatures alone.
---
[Dead](https://imgur.com/UIf2uIN) or [alive](https://imgur.com/rgNPh7r), they are breathtaking.
---
I enjoyed the grind aspect of having to walk most everywhere. It's such a big map events and vendor spots are really the only times you see other players. 
---
When you do, if you're not a two-shot or super tanky melee, you stand NO chance. I'm glad the risk is lower but it's still there. I'd raise the cap loss to at least 50% of someone's level, if not 125%. I understand that the amount of killing going on is *already* gonna make cap loss massive but the amount lost definitely needs to be higher than a measly 25% of level.
---
Has this stopped, or are you still experiencing this?  I just got the game, but this makes me nervous lol
---
Just kill a lot of mole miners. It's fun and profitable.
---
This would be so much fun to do!
---
Yeah. Its really just down to 1 point I'm quibbling over really. Since my last post, I decided its really down to STR 3 / PER 15 versus STR 4 / PER 14. I would like to be able to run Sturdy Frame 2 and Full Charge 2 at the same time, so I can be lazy and move into or out of power armor without swapping  perks. And  maybe part of me wants to keep STR 5 so I could run Full Charge 2 and Pain Train 3 for giggles sometimes. But if I could ignore Pain Train, or accept that when I run it that the trade off is extra core drain, and if I could be non-lazy and swap out manually for Sturdy Frame 2, then I could do STR 3. I'm only quibbling because *sometimes* I want to run all the maxed commando perks along with ground pounder 3 and tank killer 3.  :)
---

---
They fixed that patch
---
And AA doesn't even do anything on a laser pistol :P
---
I guess they might fix that after another four patches.
---
Yeah, more useless clicks is definitely what we need for this already cumbersome and clunky UI.
---
As if "pressing any key to continue" at logon was not that useless and unneeded.
---
I dont think it was a failure, I think it was made for people who wanted to fight other people and that it was great
---
The new lag/staggering actually is for a lot of us ! Check my posts
---
Dude pvp in any looter game is a bad bad BAD idea
---
Thought I read on hear only the player using the horn hears it. Pretty lame
---
I guess it depends on the kind of rifle. 
---
But I have bandolier maxed for ammo reductions in weight. 
---
I went pure stealth scout so I try not to be seen. And my ads is good enough that vats hits are just for starting the fight or ending it.
---
I‚Äôve played every fallout for over 2000+ hours and all of a sudden I suck because it was switched to an unbalanced online version? Fuck that pal
---
I‚Äôd run 15 on perception. Whatever category you main weapon class falls into should be maxed. I use heavy weapons so I have max strength. If you put 15 into your main weapon all your other points can be spent on luxury stuff like weight reduction. Since you already have your damage covered.
---
Check out the BoS bot in Watoga it sometimes has mods for it.
---
I had over 200 legendaries but I couldn‚Äôt store em anywhere so I just sold or dropped all the 1 and 2 stars. Keep only 3 Star legendaries because they‚Äôll apparently give more ‚Äútokens‚Äù (or something to that effect).
---
It wasn't set as my default device. I will have to check later to see if it fixed the problem. Thanks for the help üëç
---
I just have a second character to dump all of them on. Find a friend you trust and the process is pretty painless
---
Gotcha. I didn't think much about the VATS usage. I wasn't planning on going hard with the usage, but certainly a factor. Is the sneaky rifleman the only way to go about it? Feels like it's that, or melee currently.
---
You can walk almost everywhere in adventure mode if you choose. My build is none of the ones you said and I do just fine. Any build can be good and can be killed by any other build. Like 90% of the people I used to fight in pvp were people who wanted to go in and fight and kill people  most weren't trying do quests and stuff. And the ones who were would shoot you as soon as they seen you no matter if you saw them first or not. They wanted to get that kill with all the loot
---
Any particular heavy weapon you like the best?  I‚Äôve got legendary mini nuke and flamethrower right now
---
You could always fight solo and not gang up on people, then you can stop bitching about having to share the caps. 
---
Caps are so easy to come by. The fact that you're playing survival mode and monetary gain is of any concern at all is quite comical.
---
What are, things that didn't happen, Alex.
---
That's why there are 2 modes. One for pvp and one without. The more restrictions they make on pvp so people like you who would never try it will start trying it the more the people who want to pvp will go back to what they were originally doing
---
It is an issue from the last patch.
---
If you‚Äôre on ps4 I can help transfer to another character. I get if you don‚Äôt trust a random person online, though. But yeah- distributing among alts is sorta the only way for now. I have one for legendaries to sell to other players, one for junk/fusion cores/heavy ammo. (No, I don‚Äôt have a hoarding problem, why do you ask?)
---
I was planning on going with a Gauss. Although, I'm down for dropping Batteries Included for Bandolier and sticking with a lever action or handmade. I played a bunch of sneaky rifleman in 3, NV, and 4. Wanted to try and strip some of it down. I appreciate the input man!
---
It is a conundrum, but I keep having to remind myself its one that I'm doing to myself. So far the only solutions I've found to help alleviate it are the more straightforward ones. For any Legendary armour I want to stash, I try to put light or ultra light mods on them. For any weapons I know I'm definitely not going to use, I try to strip out all mods on it to bring its weight to whatever the base is for it. Unfortunately, as if in karmic response, I've been getting more Gatling Guns and Gatling Laser Guns. Only so much you can reduce the weight on those to.
---
In addition, I've started only stashing armour and weapons that manage to be a 3 star, only keeping 2 stars if its a really great combo and a couple one stars because their the only Two-Shots I have. I don't know how the potential token system from the legendary vendor will work, just hoping 3 stars get more credit than a 1.
---
Also hoping maybe I can sell a couple of my unique 2 stars when player vending appears.
---
Did I say I was ganging up on people? I said I play in a group and most people we fight are groups. I'm "bitching" cus it's more beneficial to fight in adventure mode than pvp. Why should I have any more incentive to fight in adventure mode than the mode that is designed for fighting??
---
I'm actually on PC, I appreciate the offer though. Thank you.
---
I hope that fixed it for you.
---
if you on pc ill help you level we can drop a nuke on Morgantown for that quick exp
---
Save some for me if you don‚Äôt care! I‚Äôll come around in a few. Also have the lemonade vendor on me if you wanna join my world - psn is radiationdaddy
---
Interesting thanks. I use fully ranked bear arms and 5 pieces of WWR and they seem to all work together. For example if I have all my armor on, check my weight, then throw on the bear arms card, my weight goes down. I guess I should compare with the different ranks of bear arms and see if there's difference between them, might be wasting perk points. 
---
So just to confirm, if you have travelling pharmacy maxed, that's the most WR you can get in that category?
---
have not been able to join a playable world since the patch no answers from Bethesda or any of the other glitch fixes helps
---
So our character is ‚ÄúThe Late Savior‚Äù?
---
Sorry my friend's internet crashed! But enjoy the serum!
---
Ah. Gauss is good but I find better when aiming it your self. And the lever is beautiful. A double legendary is tops. 10 rounds makes it feel like the NV one. Instigating is way better but the double effect brings up the reliability of it.
---
It's not just x01, all non crafted mods
---
I been hanging onto the one and two stars with at least one good ability so long as they weigh 3 or less.  Three stars if they weigh 10 or less.
---
Nuke I find meh but it's my personal opinion, I use the plasma and flamethrower. I use a Gauss riffle for distance (I know it's not a heavy) but when they get close or I'm in doors mostly those other 2. Gatling lazer and 50 Cal are good but can be expensive to operate all the time just as a heads up.
---
Maybe. It‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve noticed while wandering.
---
Ty
---
So had I. Like we miss everything by a few days.
---
it's installing now. 59gb update is a bit rough when you wanna play your new game.
---
My alt's base is currently there. Reslly nice spot for a base.
---
Thanks for the advice appreciate it
---
Chameleon leather armor with stand fast.
---
Stealthy play with perks for rifles shotguns and pistols.
---
Currently using a executioners pipe bolt action rifle a stalkers explosive assault rifle hunters explosive combat shotgun and a stealth blade combat knife.
---
Sneak into a area pick distant enemies that are up high with the pipe then sneak in close for melee for the rest. When I get noticed I either switch to the assault rifle or shorty based on how many or how tough the enemies are.
---
Thats lit
---
I'm running a vampire's explosive gatling plasma (cheap ammo, easy weight carry) and with the right perks and full Sentinel, it tears through anything/everything and keeps you 100% hp topped off.
---
Exactly
---
&gt; AA perks and effects make it as effective as wearing a wet paper bag.
---
That's true of virtually any other game.  I know because AA is my go to weapon in PVP. I've shredded through any armor that I've encountered, not just PA.
---
Which is why there are no npcs. The lore dictates that we just missed the opportunity to save anyone, the only ones left aren't human.
---
Just had the chance to read this. Very well written! I‚Äôve always been curious how good a junkie build would be considering the amount of upkeep. I use to play as bloodied but grew bored of it and now run full health with tse/explosive only weapons. I still use my Bloodied power fist in PVE for when I get low on health and can‚Äôt pop a stim. Anyways can‚Äôt wait to see another study you come up with this was an awesome read and loved it! Thanks for doing this for the community Yab. :)
---
Meant to rely to you but accidentally to my post thanks for the advice I appreciate it.
---
There is a lot of us struggling with this atm. Check my post and comments and upvote so we get trough to Bethesda please. Many of us on ps4 have not played since the latest patch üò§
---
That's pretty hilarious, they sound like funny guys....if this were actually true.
---
I play with friends on a team and the split is 7,6,6 and 6.
---
As painful as it was to slog through all that,  believe it or not I did read it.
---
Heavy guns such as 50 cal, gatling plasma, gat laser, regular gatling are all very viable options... I run bloody 50 cal and I couldn't have asked for a more powerful build... you use far less ammunition going bloody heavy gunner as well
---
I run a vampire Gatling laser PA easy cheap ammo 50cal and 5mm are easy to craft in bulk 100 per craft without ammo perks, 180 per craft with ammo perks, so you can spray and pray if that‚Äôs your style , it‚Äôs mine, you can stagger sent Assassin armor, also stagger mobs by sprinting into them with the pain train perk, I think it‚Äôs worth it
---
I could be wrong, but I‚Äôm 99% sure you can jump to a friends server without exiting to the main menu. But I did have this looong loading screen (aka soft freeze) happen once a couple days ago and it kinda was a bummer until I reset my console.
---
As someone who contests workshops for caps, it definitely is a deterrent. I won‚Äôt spent 80 caps to contest a workshop owned by a lvl 100, too much work and risk for too little payout. For 25 caps though, game on
---
It's just silly at the moment. 25% is way too low, it should be a 100% WITH a max loss cap of 100 or 150.
---
Everyone I ever talk to about Fallout 76 is always like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs absolute and complete garbage‚Äù, THEY HAVEN‚ÄôT EVEN PLAYED THE GAME!!!
---
Alot of builds rely on vats to be effective. Critical builds dont exist without vats.
---
I have a feeling they will be unlocked with future content, I mean there is no way this Sheepsquach thing is over so I think perhaps whatever further quests they add, it'll unlock these plans. I mean hopefully, they all look pretty damn cool.
---
Worse than a smollet story xD
---
I like it, but I do think they need a pure pvp server, much like it was.. I like this survival version better because being able to be killed at any time with double cap loss limits those who can play there and have fun... I think a dedicated pvp server should be for hardcore pvp players, the best of the best.  Survival is for those getting better but are not yet ready for the excellent competition of the best pvp builds
---
Census violence rewards Shielded lining marine underarmor plan. I played census violence event almost exclusively for 1 month and was rewarded this plan. Did you or anyone else get this or any unique plans rewarded from events?
---
It doesn't help that it likes to bug out so you can't see any enemies, and sometimes the pylon status isn't properly reflected in-world or in the objectives.
---
Look. I think it's wise to do research before buying a title but those people shouldn't go around thinking they actually have a valid opinion. That opinion is based on second hand knowledge, where in the world does that hold any weight. 
---
76 has it's issues, "has" as in "on going" but the press around it has cemented in my opinion problems with most reviews. I argue that most "reviewers" haven't played the game enough. Count how many reviewers have said in their INITIAL review 76 has no npcs. Bethesda hasn't even said that, they said there's no human npcs. You don't have to play too long before you run into full npcs, top of the world where you meet Rose, although I'd argue that very first protectron I came across, worrying about losing his job to (non-existing) humans, counts. So we know they haven't gotten even 2/5ths of the way into the game. 
---
Hell there are "reviewers" that stopped playing the game because they hated it which is perfectly fine. What isn't good is putting out a review based on this limited game time, complaining how they "have to drag back all their salvage and weapons back to their camp to break it down" They didn't even play it enough to realize benches and stash boxes are all around or even that they can move their camp. YOU made the decision to stop playing the game, don't try to recoup lost time by making a half ass review. 
---
Funny thing is there are legitimate criticisms to make. It's not a deep Fallout type story, there is no choices to make that hold ANY consequence and it breaks lore. There's no defense of those points. 
---
So yeah. If you based an opinion on those reviews of course you're not going to buy 76 but we're at a time that we should start researching those who we  get opinions from.
---
Thanks man!  At the very least maybe folks will stop automatically throwing Junky gear away when the get one to drop and I‚Äôll have more opportunities to add to my collection ü§™
---
Fun fact the quickboys color can be changed in the ini file everything except hud color can
---
I think the Wastelanders DLC will add in human NPC's. The title says it all and Todd said it would change the game, has to be NPC's. Don't see what else it could be.
---
Oddly enough, I kind of wish we had more *non human* Super Mutant NPCs like Grahm. It'd be rather humorous to have other Super Mutants like him that you just catch fishing that could potentially even give us quests.

Yeah I've decided on [this build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f498b6&amp;d=s61sb0pd2pk2pl2pp2pa0p80p90e82el0c72cm2cu0cr0ic4id2a72ar2an2ao0a00lt2li2&amp;w=st1sy2pg2ph2pi2po2pe2e00ei2ev2i30ia0i50i71im1in1ii0ik0iq2ij2if2ie2ih2ib4ag2i61at1au2a30lm2l92l12&amp;n=Sneak%20XOR%20Power%20Armor&amp;m=). I have the bulk of the cards I need already, but I am currently 5 6 6 15 8 8 8 or something like that. So I have to shift some points around and then pick up a bunch of rifle skills.
---
Anyway, thanks for the advice. It helped me figure out what I needed. Cheers!
---
Still not better my friend? Just as bad here also üòû
---
I‚Äôm a PS4 guy sooooo
---
Thanks :)
---
I find this latest design choice... clunky.
---
Will download and endorse as soon as I haul my posterior out of bed.
---
Are there any plans to try to make those two mods play nice with each other at some point in the future?
---
Maxed travelling pharmacy should be the limit, yeah. IIRC when someone shared that, my stimpaks were still 0.1 weight.
---
I suspect that weapon weight perks and armor are never entirely wasted, but you will get diminishing returns from stacking both.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the stabilize perk. It decreases the enemies armor resistance while in power armor and I must say, it‚Äôs very helpful
---
Through that portal you can seamlessly cross between Adventure and Survival.
---
Something something *mirror universe*.
---
Thanks. I'm about to pass out right now, long week. But maybe I'll hit you up sometime and DM you here or etc. I appreciate it!
---
I believe you need space and the amount varies depending on what your taming.
---
*yip yip Martian noises*
---
Cool idea
---
They have human raiders in the game- they‚Äôre just actual humans this time. Take over a few key workshops- you‚Äôll probably meet them.
---
Very odd, will document and report in the morning and keep trying to replicate.
---
--close
---
Do you have the perks to effect the stealth boys duration?
---
So...  who's selling?
---
I don't even open the shop anymore cause of this.
---
pc
---
HOW COULD WE HAVE BEEN SO FOOLISH!? THEY EVOLVE FROM FLIES!
---
*furiously crosses out notes on chalkboard*
---
I‚Äôve had the SB attack me there while I was trying to take down the Deathclaw. It just ended up getting scorched and becoming stronger
---
Yup! I'll try to do something with it for tomorrow
---
Kinda look like skyrim
---
I‚Äôm waiting for Yongyea to make a video about this!!! Could be the final nail in the coffin.
---
In one of the Inside The Vaults they mentioned possibly adding fridges to the Atomic Shop.
---
Same here. Tried covering the flashing floor seam with a rug...kind of worked, but didn't entirely stop the flashing
---
normally it is 10% but there is a glitch where if you are completly full on budget it will still let you tame one
---
Strong back and life giver are terrible.  I'd bet you any amount that you'll get far more value from three ranks of traveling pharmacy then 7 ranks of those two.  No starched genes? Marsupial and to a lesser extent speed demon are better than any perk card in the game, aside from 1 rank of adrenaline which you also aren't playing. 
---
I play rifles and carry a pistol as well, in order to avoid using good ammo on shitty mobs.  I have no ranks of any pistol cards and I can easily kill the white spring ghouls and down. 
---
Tormentor is good in the sbq fight but for everything else you'll probably kill it before a broken limb would make any difference. I tried grim reaper sprint and wasn't a fan.  Better crits or crit savvy are both better. 
---
Hope this helps
---
Underrated comment of the year :p
---
The caps liss should not be tied to level at all. Everyone should lose 100 caps standered after level 50.
---
Until private servers and mod support for Fallout 76 are released, people will probably continue modding the older games.
---
Where is your camp located at or by??
---
This would really spruce up my poo temple camp. Genius idea ;)
---
In hindsight, it was so obvious!
---
You'd be better off moving on from this game..
---
"–ß–µ–ª–æ–º–æ–ª—å" –∑–±—Å) That's the way of things)
---
Oh maybe it's just you. I mean you got constant 3* items from sbq right? Why are you complaining that this doesn't give 3 stars? Just go back to farming sbq if you want 3* loot.
---
ok but WHAT aid items? literally anything in your aid section? is there the same % chance for you to drop your moldy food, salt or spoiled food as it is to drop a super stimpack &amp; nuka cola quantum?
---
can you over prepare your inventory with bad healing items such as toxic water to make it harder for you to drop your good items
---
Explosive ain‚Äôt worth it, other then that it is pretty viable.
---
To honor the Diehards, I sell chems to randoms.
---
I hope you would be satisfied by 2 500 caps?
---
Definitely too.
---
I LOVE my gatling gun. Its just a 1* ts, but it tears everything up. When I want to have more fun I use an instigating broadsider. Hard to find the bodies after though.
---
Music to my ears :)
---
This latest UI patch has fallen short of 'what an elegant implementation!' and closer to the realm of 'I may learn to live with it, probably'.
---
Maybe it's cause I'm on PC, but I've done it 4 times now and we've all worked together pretty well.
---
Same, but with a Vampire shotty. I love that thing.
---
My experience is that stims are over weighted to be more lilely to drop
---
Love my .50 cal and gatling plasma. Farm with melee to save ammo, pull out the big boys for tough fights.
---
I was in someone's house today and they had the same. Hopefully its been said enough to where theyll fix it in the next patch
---
Me and my crew are having the worst time with chat on PS4. You literally have to scroll through really fast through the options. Or flicker the volume control for the chat option. And most of the time it works
---
I don't mind new gamemodes as long as I'm not forced to play them. Fallout just seems like a very unfitting place for a battle royal.
---
Bethesda is just testing the waters to find the depth. This is the beginning of a longer process. When this dies down, perk card backs and loot lunchboxes are next.
---
Of course Bethesda will then claim "no one complained about Repair Kits" if they say anything at all.
---
What is wrong is the fact it has the atomic shop camo paint on the stock.
---
I feel like I'm going crazy, that I'm the only one...  PS4- when I approach a closed door and go to open it it says "close door" ghouls and enemies can walk straight through it, but I cannot. I have to close the closed door, normally a glitched environment behind the door briefly appears with the animation of the door closing, then I can open the door and go through. Drives me crazy but no-one else has said anything.
---
Bethesda - we'll give you a treat.... For 2000 atoms
---
If you like running around in PA then heavy weapons are legit. Shotguns also work well but you'll have ammo problems there too if you don't play part-time stealth rifle.
---
PA does make it very easy to play bloodied, so you can use that to mitigate some of the penalty from not using stealth. You'd want to chuck on Class Freak to handle Adrenal Reaction.
---
I wouldn't bother with the pistols except maybe for saving ammo when running around the Forest, and you don't need damage perks for that. Portable Power doesn't do anything useful unless you're carrying several chassis on you for some reason. Power Patcher shouldn't be necessary because PA lasts for ages. You'll probably spend far more time farming for ammo than PA repair mats.
---
Same problem here. Happened to me at Watoga medical.
---
Cavalier /sentinel   is the standard knee jerk answer to everything on reddit.  The truth is that over 90 percent of players you encounter aren't wearing a full set.
---
The one that fights the ants in watoga?
---
Yep. But it‚Äôs rarely legendary and for some reason it‚Äôs been speaking legendary repeatedly since I‚Äôve been on this server.
---
Then why I have a main quest there? The game led me to a location and then said ‚Äúyou are not ready for it‚Äù and sent a lvl 60 SB to destroy me and my camp located outside Flatwoods? I don‚Äôt think so. It is more like the enemies spawn when a player is near a spawn location. If the player is high level the game spawns high level enemies. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the high level player cleared that location. So when I walk in I ether see all enemies die in front of me or I just have to find a way to deal with them. This kind of thing brakes immersion because you are constantly being reminded you are playing a game. A very rushed one too.
---
Everybody knows about this
---
Yeah this happen to me today on Xbox. 3* super mutants at West Tek gave me a frickin drill. I saved the video, thought a out posting it because they said they fixed this.
---
I said I play with friends. Not that I gang up on people. And those numbers are to show how little you get. In adventure mode, the mode designed for not having pvp we would each get 25 caps. 4 times the amount. I'm saying I shouldn't feel like it's more rewarding to grief people in adventure mode than just playing pvp
---
50cal is probably the most reliable full-DPS. Gatling plasma WOULD be great if it benefited from any armor piercing. As it is it's still pretty good. LMG does insane DPS but it's way too expensive to keep loaded up (ammo crafts in really small batches) and has a fairly small magazine. Gatling gun is your best "trash mob" weapon. Accurate, high damage per shot, very ammo/repair efficient. Slow firing.
---
Yes! We need more infos on the mods for example. Indeed the fandom (it was renamed recently) is what i've used for all previous Fo games and IMO it is the best!
---
I thought the same thing
---
Luckily my sister also plays so we just made another character on her account that I trade all my gear. Although that account is overloaded now also, so I sold all the 1-2\* legendaries to the vendor since it's easier now to do so.
---
I would've built my CAMP more vertically for a better view if I were you bro lol
---
You didn't have to say it specifically.  It's clearly implied.
---
There's so many people. I frequently have to wait for people to leave servers cause they're full. That's more to do with how I server hop, but it goes to show that the game is indeed full of people that are active.
---
Ya that‚Äôs totally good sorry just saw this. IGN lazarus801
---
Added...let me know :)
---
Since you can't lock your crops (but you can lock an open top wheelbarrow literally full of shit) they should get a pop up warning the first time they do it.  
---
OR
---
If you don't want people picking your crops, put up some walls around them. A greenhouse option and planters would be a nice addition to facilitate this.
---
On paper it has the best stats, but it's a bitch to repair.
---
Are you using mods on PC? Sounds like you are. Update you custom.ini file with the new b2a files Bethesda added to the data folder should clear it right up.
---
Leave the world and join back. You'll be where you were before instead of having to go to Vault 76.
---
I've seen a few posts that say the same as you. I bought it, no issues for me. I'm sure Bethesda is aware of it by now though. Stupid bugs!
---
Like any other item in the game, you can only harvest/loot it every so often.  Plants don't appear to be affected by the visual affect that prevents you from seeing items you're on cooldown for looting despite the fact others in that world can see and loot them.
---
I'm not using any mods. I've already deleted everything related to Fo76  and reinstalled twice so my ini file should be correct.
---
according to the help menu in the game under legendarys, they have a chance to drop a legendary, so we get the short end of the stick on that deal, it sucks grind for an hour and finally see a legendary kill it for..... some ammo and caps.....yay
---
Like chicken.
---
Settle for a bean feast?
---
Then make a custom ini file and add all the b2a files that are in your data folder it will make them load into the game and that should fix it.
---
You get a few of each flux every time you drop the queen, if you're on a decent server you can do it 3 times in an hour giving you roughly 10 pure of everything
---
For certain legendaries (I haven't personally investigated if there's a pattern of armor type, primary legendary effect, or what), the +25 rad resist secondary legendary effect simply does nothing.
---
Bethesda would never reuse assets like that /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
I just imagine it's fart spraying me
---
Go away.
---
Sounds like some kind of revenge move,pissed off girlfriend ?lol...
---
How come? Its cheaper than X-01 to repair
---
Excellent, enjoy the binge! Our data sets are kinda different, I went a bit more detailed on the drops and possible stat effects, but you recorded more about how the events actually went. Definitely possible to merge.
---
Alright, tell me if you can‚Äôt join me
---
I'm just waiting for the ability to make a Cornholio Halloween costume. Just so I can run up to players and ask for TP
---
For some reason, with the latest patch, mods are broken right now. It seems that only plans will work.
---
So, the benefit: You get to run with full health. A damage boost about 2/3 as good as a Bloodied weapon and low health (Albeit without taking into account all the things that boost low-health Bloodied builds like Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage, Serendipity, etc...)
---
And the cons: A bunch of attribute reductions. Expensive chem use every time you die. No complimentary perks to increase damage. No stupidly high 1k+ damage (even MORE from melee builds) that Bloodied can do. 
---
This MIGHT be viable for PVP. Bloodied can be a bit risky because of that STUPID one-shot filter that got implemented a couple patches back. But the sheer damage it can do seems to still overwhelm the Asshole/Sentinels on a crit. But if you DON'T kill them in the first shot you are basically fucked. You just get spammed with explosive weapons along your line of fire after the jerk stims himself right back to full health. The junkie build might just make the Asshole/sentinels hit harder.  
---
**\^CRAP! Just what we needed, another advantage for those assholes...**
---
I had fun pranking people in ark, they give you a spray gun and every color of dye imaginable, go graffiti someones base completely pink. Good times
---
Thanks!!
---
ugh. I dont get why I should have to manually add files to load. I'm terrible with that technical stuff. I think I'll contact Bethesda support to check before I accidentally mess something up.
---
Maybe don't buy the thing? Seems to me plenty of people are doing it right now. I've done 3? or 4 and just learned today you can buy the boards and they cost 2K (which seems ridiculously expensive).
---
No no. I mean like people are still alive and we JUST miss them. Like if you see for example a deathclaw random spawn with traveling merchants. The bodies are in a condition that doesn‚Äôt add up with a Years dead but rather weeks/months. 
---
Like our timing is so bad that civilians and not the factions are trying to just live and we are always too late to save them or see them.
---
Yes I have lv 1 of that perk
---
It works do it if you want a quick fix or wait for Bethesda to eventually fix it up to you.
---
Happy camper here, haha
---
Thank you
---
Same issue here. So annoying, but loving the recent updates so far :)
---
Surely someone knows
---
Mabye, considering life does happe. How come it's the majority of people who trade who don't talk vs random in game
---
I once found scorched mirelurks that spawned at the Ranger District Office which seem to have been some kind of radroach hybrid. Some of them were labeled "Radroach", while some were labeled "Mirelurk", and most of them dropped radroach meat. And now this! Damn bugs are plotting something, I tell you! Probably n league with that dead deathclaw at the random encounter that's always labeled "merchant"...
---
This last reinstall fixed it. Luckily I have pretty fast internet to be able to DL the 55GB game 3 times over and not have it take hours and hours.
---
You shouldn't be repairing things in the middle of a SBQ fight anyway?
---
In the future that file will fix it if you don't wanna redownload.
---
I would love if Junkie weapons could become a thing
---
Do you think we could actually get an option too smoke cigarettes in the game like the npc can in fallout 4 ? Would be cool to be able too do small things like that
---
I think we‚Äôre overestimating how kind BGS will be when trading legendaries, ie. I think we‚Äôll be allowed, say, 1 weapon every 24 hours or something? There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôll let us trade 50 guns in one sitting and come out with all the best legendaries.
---
I am guessing cells make up cores? Weird guess but not sure.
---
In that solution I'm losing whatever I dropped. :(. But yes it does work.
---
found a new 1/2 
---
loose mods cant be used at all 
---
and new i think you cant learn any mods by scrapping atm
---
Lol, well I‚Äôve yet to die on the PvP servers, and got some good kills...but I‚Äôm 95% PvE so it‚Äôs a very practical build in that respect, plus I have friends who enable my chem habit and hold on to my favorites for me so I‚Äôm lucky in that respect ‚úä
---
Well I‚Äôve made a good market for them on Xbox...if enough folks read this post and give it a try it might become a thing indeed
---
and also quad assault tron head will deal - dmg and heal things it hits
---
Welcome to the community!
---
How does intentionally holding-off on fixing mod attachments encourage buying repair kits? Even if it was a conspiracy like you imply, repairing != mods...
---
Oh, another one of those posts.
---
Maybe. Fusion cells are weaker than fusion cores but not by that much. As a fusion core fires what 500? rounds in a Gatling laser so by that a laser rifle could at max capacitor need 13 something cells for that right?
---
The problem went away when I restarted my computer. How could I forget the #1 rule?
---
And what exactly do you need to sacrifice and how long to farm in order to get close to the effects of just pressing E near PA?
---
You get some PA plans for free. You get full ultracite PA for completing BoS quest. There are plenty of spots to grab near guaranteed PA parts (in Watoga alone at least 4). How long does it take to farm good mods and good legendary armour? Longer for sure.
---
Repost from the patch 8 bug roundup as requested:
---
 Been saying this since launch but class freak does not reduce the negative effects of empath mutation. There might be other bugs concerning class freak, strange in numbers and mutations but this one is the most irritating imo. Would appreciate if you could add it to the list for visibility. I personally submitted a ticket about the bug yesterday as I didn't know you could submit tickets for bugs.
---
I wanted to let them get all the bugs and kinks worked out. I've been playing about a week now and have been thoroughly enjoying it. I did the same with ESO and loved it as well.
---
i would totally leave the toilet paper up on my camp if someone did that
---
You know in Fallout 3 and New Vegas(and 1,2, and Tactics) all weapons had hard locked in skill and strength requirements... Right? Considering how weapons run the gamut of level requirements, you can usually find a version you can use. The level restriction is pretty damn negligible compared to the games before Fallout 4(in which you could use any gun in the game from the literal start).
---
If high level mobs are spawning in a low level area you need to be in? That means there's a high level player also spending time in the area. Which means either follow a side quest and go somewhere else until the high level player takes off, or server hop. That's more the limitation of an open world multiplayer game with RPG elements. It's annoying, but it is avoidable. Also mob respawns are pretty tame and they were at launch, unless someone came into an area you just cleared a few minutes prior.
---
Also not the whole of a group of enemies detects you when one does. Enemies can give your position away to their group, but if you take one down silently before the others notice, you stay hidden. That's even if the first enemy was on the hunt for you.
---
So another load of complaints that don't apply, because the person doing the complaining, doesn't actually know the game.
---
Sorry I wasn't clear what I meant. I meant the bug was probably introduced unintentionally by adding code for the repair kits. They're going to be interacting with the same objects (workbenches).
---
Have you noticed they added an extra step to repairing anything? That will probably be the place to create the kits later and my guess is it will produce a mod which is item specific but maybe can be used whenever.
---
If any case, they screwed with the repair section of crafting which is the same ballpark as using a mod. That's why I say the two are connected.
---
This has not happened to me on ps4 yet, but it sounds a bit annoying
---
Only if the Chinese knew how to properly farm bloodied and anti armor legendaries we would have never won in anchorage
---
You still got that deathclaw?
---
Love this game
---
Sry, JUST got booted from the server.   Got a solid 10 of them in a row though.  Of course nothing worth a shit but oh well.
---
It's cool I was interested in the exp lol
---
They're trying to *Drill* it into our skulls I guess you could say
---
I think they should just buff one handed altogether, with all gladiator perks my fully upgraded 200% level 50 vampire swing speed rev sword hits less than my level 40 unmodded sledge with no mods or perks.. 2h is completely broken and unbalanced
---
Attaching mods was broken in the latest patch.
---
A cursory look at the sub will net you many posts on this subject.
---
Interesting. The only Scorchbeast I've seen in the Flatwoods can't be targeted and don't seem to actually attack. They are usually there just to scare the player shitless. Now I'm kind of wondering if you haven't just ran into bug.
---
Do the same with others when you can :)
---
I'm not so sure he wanted to go in the dirt 10 times, win 1, then walk away at 120 cap profit.
---
I always thought the acid attack was supposed to get you out of buildings. Removing that would make scorchbeasts even less intimidating.
---
True, but it's only junk...
---
You ***will*** get more
---
That hasn't happened to me. I think your internet/PS4 suck. I may be wrong though.
---
I have Telus 150, and a brand new PS4
---
Should. Don't see why not. Robot Hacker perk also potentially amazing against the adds
---
Complaining about how survival is a pvp mode cliche
---
For real, I‚Äôm tired of cooking their meat. If I can‚Äôt make sushi I don‚Äôt want it üç£
---
I used to try and farm mirelurk eggs to make corn pone and pumpkin pie but the only spot I could reliably find 'em also had a queen. She ends up costing me so many stims and so much ammo  it's just not worth it. Either I clobber her for high damage and get wrecked or run away and kite the acid blasts behind trees.
---
I don't really tamper with the ini files. I'd have to go look up a tutorial on how to add the correct stuff in the right place. I remember trying to mod fallout 4 and could never get anything i did to work. All I ended up doing was corrupting the game somehow and had reinstall. This is why i dont mess with files.
---
In this game it feels like, while some things are going forward, other things go backwards. This particular developer choice is a backwards step, hopefully they change their mind and fix it next patch.
---
BTW thanks for your work with the mod. Will give it a go.
---
I certainly feel like I'm getting *drilled* every time I loot one.
---
I could tell about other bugs so if you want to create separate threads about them as well? Particularly when we just had a bug thread about latest patch.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbp7wy/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch_8/
---
TLDR - not worth it
---
So... what?  We can't add mods at all? :|
---
West tek 4min to clear 65% of a lvl repete
---
Wait, it does? Where?
---
As of right now, placing the Ps4 into safe mode and rebuilding the database fixes the issue. Got around 4 hours with no problems. Then suddenly as I am walking around I got a message stating Fallout 76 files are corrupted and that the game must be deleted and reinstalled. Just rebuilt the database again to see if I can circumvent the issue. Dont want to reinstall the game for a 3rd time today üòê
---
Guess we got to *drill* our way to the next one
---
\&gt; Saying she was *not* changed is complete BS. 
---
Strawman and moving the goalpost. That's your contention, not mine. 
---
However, your mere statements of 'she was soloed' blah blah blah is more bs. Why would I believe your word for being solo'ed when you provide no evidence beyond I said so?
---
The fact is, there are very few players capable of soloing the queen if not for any other reason than that there's very few players able to stay on a server long enough for it to be empty. Show me \*any\* proof you actually solo'ed the queen, AND that your evidence of ACTUAL difference in damage/health taken. Screenshots, video, etc. Just saying "I solo'ed it" means jack shit. Maybe there's naive fools that'll believe that. I'm not one of them. Show PROOF backing your claims, not just unverified statement.. i.e. bullshit.
---
I have not once said the queen hasn't been changed. I am calling out your bs about solo'ing the queen, and 'multiple people' soloing the queen with evidence. 
---
NONE of those patch notes has ANYTHING to do with her health, nor your bs about solo'ing her.
---
I had said this a while ago but a Bee barrel. you get bee larva from honey beasts and you give the affected target "hive scabs" which makes any damage they take have a chance to release a swarm of bees
---
Have you been taking workshops or accidentally shooting people with pacifist off?
---
I don‚Äôt understand how it works exactly but I think if you take a workshop, you can be freely attacked
---
Well?
---
Make new friends. Real friends.
---
Right now I‚Äôm just wandering towards players with copious amounts of razor grain soup and passing it out to them, Saying ‚ÄúCourtesy Of Fenrick McThane! Tell your friends‚Äù in my 1960‚Äôs radio show voice and it‚Äôs a fuckin blast.
---
All other online games are working fine for me . I redownloaded the game and installed ----&gt; did not help

---
Yes it takes hundreds of server hopping to find the Red, Forrest, Pink and lesser extent Blue Asylum Uniform. Most people know the location where the uniforms are spawned, which is the third floor of the Fort Defiance / Old Asylum building. There are three, not two locations on that floor that spawns the Asylum Uniforms. The Barrack bedroom straight ahead, the bottom right bedroom down the hallway, but the third is the shower room on the wooden bench. When searching for a specific uniform, don't pick up any other asylum dress, as it only spawn in that location every twenty-four hours. Also work out the specific time when the servers respawn usually 9am EST or 4pm BST, this way there is higher chance that nobody has taken the uniform.
---
PS. Hope you find the Red Asylum Workers Uniform.
---
with power patcher, armmorer and fix it good all maxed out anything is easy to repair. But some people don't like swapping perks out.
---
To be honest. I've run nuke zones SBQ in type t51b x01. All @lvl 50 all repaired to 200% and don't see much if any difference. The runs we're with the see group (no one useing rad reducing perks. And TBH I don't see a difference at all. But to each his/her own.  Play how you want to play and have fun that's what the games about.
---
On paper yes x01 out preforms any other for rad resist. T51 has better ballist defence. And type is CHEEP to repair. I only run excavator for mining lead. So don't use it in a nuke zone but I see others run it with no prob.
---
That happened to me while waiting for an sbq fight along with my sentinel stats not working, died and had to respawn at 76
---
Nope, sorry.
---
You can 'craft' the mod if you have 'learned' to do so but you cannot attach miscmods (hope that makes sense).
---
Sounds like you were overencumbered when you died. It forces you to only choose nearest location, or a teammate... and you had no teammates.
---
Technically you'd craft/find negative or slight film, develop it at the chemistry station, then print it to paper and frame it (also presumably at the chemistry station). Also assuming images aren't recorded to holotapes in this universe (future add-on?)
---
I shoot film IRL, and would totally love to be your wasteland 1 Hour photo!!! 
---
An in-game mechanic to share them would be even better. You could host in-game photo competitions with cap/item rewards, turn your camp into a gallery.
---
I should probably take real photos instead of playing this game... but i think it might accidentally get a whole lot of people into photography if sim'd accurately enough. Kinda like what Kerbal Space Program did to rocket science/ aerospace.
---
Outside of novelty youtube video I found it curious that anyone would actually use the syringer for meat farming. Well, it can be better than it seems.
---
Idk then, cuz if ur freezing everywhere and I'm not, then its something on ur end
---
Yes this would explain it I was in excavator and must've had the extra 100 glitch. When I died I lost it. Thank you!!
---
watoga vendor can have them
---
That feature isnt in yet. I have to start the game always when I switch char.
---
Now imagine the poor kids that never got to practice their technique via Tetris? Thank you gameboy. Never thought you'd help me out on a PS4
---
Yes, I have it too. The patch introduced this issue to all those heavy energy gatling weapons. It'll only work fine if I spin up temporarily, stop, do a full spin and not let go. Trying to do pauses mid way tends to eat up the rest of the clip on occasion. 
---
I'm waiting for that bug to be patched tbh, but do report it in the official forums.
---
Just server hop until you get the notification that the event is active, fast travel there and you can join for free. There's always a bunch of people there.
---
Some mods work, but overall yes it is pretty busted.
---
Yeah... makes sense... I feel bad as I've just sold some mods to someone - and bought one for myself. :|
---
Thankfully I got the rest of the set modded by a crafter.
---
I accidentally bought the Christmas wood burner when it was about 800... Pretty sure I'm the only person in the entire game who has it so I've dedicated a whole room to displaying it in my camp!
---
Someone should suggest a buyback option. If you‚Äôve sold something to a vendor, they should hang onto it for a bit! Just like in other multiplayer games with economies.
---
Thanks for the responses! They helped my ease my anxiety of my data being screwed. I waited this long for the mod, I can wait until the bug is patched.
---
yes if you own a workshop and someone contests it they can come kill you anywhere on the map for free even if you don't fight back even if you have passive mode on
---
Thanks
---
What kind of information would you like? Guides?
---
Are you hoarding ammo you don‚Äôt use often? Donate to the overseer‚Äôs stash. Banjo dropped like 50 lbs that way
---
On 4 we could make Rad storm shells from Artillery.
---
They buffed the daily / weekly challenges like crazy. :(
---
Try to memorize where the plants are before they're nuked-- but yes, sometimes they do get bugged out or don't properly turn into nuked flora despite being inside the blast zone... or if you've previously picked it, it'll still visually show as being harvestable, but not actually be harvestable. 
---
Nodes don't respawn on the same server for you. You'll have to server hop if you previously picked on that same server. The server remembers when you'ved harvested from that flora.
---
Yuuup. Good data, but over-all, "the reward system in this game is broken garbage" is the summery.
---
a RP only PC server would be the bomb. Solo RP'ing is no fun...
---
I'd pay atoms for an Australian Flag
---
Hopefully it will be fixed in next week's patch.
---
With the current server instabilities is not a good time to be doing a lot of back-and-forth with valuable gear in order to get it modded.
---
Hmm.. suspicious. If you reached end game by now you should have collected some recipes and be able to craft lv 50 weapons. A non legendary fire axe can be used to take down a scorch beast in t 45 power armor wuth full str. just last scorch beast queen my weapons were either out of ammo or broken after the fight. I used a pipe revolver i made in the warehouse and a hazmat suit with chems and blasted my way slowly back to watoga. I was super over encumbered but i had some great loot. My power armor was fusion coreless so i opted not to wear it since i moved slower with it on. I think your full of it.
---
they already made one
---
[https://www.gamingheads.com/fallout-deathclaw-plush.html](https://www.gamingheads.com/fallout-deathclaw-plush.html)
---
Definitely if you do the enclave missions it'll be fine but if you leave a server after shooting a robot and jump to another you should definitely be fine
---
The items will be available again in a pack at a future date. The fact that you feel am impending sense of doom means you got owned by marketing. Relax, don't take things stop seriously and stop working about what you think is not fair. You get tons of atoms in game. Go do those challenges and leave whitesprings you got this.
---
To be fair, i -have- seen someone techically one-shot with a drill. Admittedly, they used the drill on a plasma mine they were stood next to..
---
It is for me. Being Fenrick McThane is a jolly good time . (Yes I‚Äôm reading this in the Fenrick voice.)
---
I think the appeal is you can use a premium currency many never actually spend (I mean I do, but) instead of hard to find resources. Personally I‚Äôd rather use materials anyway but still
---
Bueller... Bueller...
---
I'm on my way now. I'll buy whatever you have left.
---
It also appears to be some crafted mods as well. Couldn't put third claw on DC gauntlet, and the only sight we could get the game to put on a lever action last night was the medium NV scope &gt;&lt;
---
Server/client communication issues, for the most part. 
---
Make sure you've been in the location with the same target for at least a minute before engaging it, and make sure to hit it directly (not indirectly with explosives), multiple times.
---
If you first load into a place, such as from server hopping, the server/client communication might bug out, and not register you properly killing/getting credit for said legendary. Same sort of thing can happen when you first load into say, the missile silo or the enclave bunker, run forward, and snap back a minute or two later because the game didn't properly communicate with the server yet.
---
So ideally, you want to avoid immediately instantly killing legendaries. 
---
In the case of having already been in the location for a while, it is possible the corpse just hasn't generated the loot yet, and come back in a minute or two and it'll pop up.
---
GL, this should help with your farming.
---
Confirmed.  I've gotten it in the same place.  Not the same license to print money as the other civil war gear but still really good.
---
Your teachers must be so proud
---
I sell what i see no use for to vendor. If i need to get legendaries for the vendor i can go get tons easily. They are not rare; certain types are but i do not think it will be like a 3 of a kind makes 4 thing. It will be something way grinder...
---
I said I wouldn't buy them cause you can get one from drops. I never stated that they were the same one.
---
....... that‚Äôs funny, reminds me of a person who picked a fight with me and didn‚Äôt think I saw the mine they tossed.......my vats did
---
Enclave helping? Lies
---
Version controll? Oh you mean the single hard drive BGS  uses. üòÖ
---
Haha so true
---
Don‚Äôt play endgame. It‚Äôs just a shitty race to ‚Äúmeta‚Äù and once you‚Äôre a god the games horribly unbalanced enemies are easy one shot and the game feels empty and boring. I retooled a toon and use shitty 1hand sword and rifleman, and I still one/two shot most enemies.
---
Most endgame u can‚Äôt solo anyways so just make a cats heal tank or something. Just play as u want and don‚Äôt worry about being meta. The game will be a lot more fun
---
X-01 or ultracite?
---
I put mine at the edge of my camp on the road to Blackwater mine from Whitesprings station. As a roadside memorial to the fallen
---
Heh, this was a friend of mine who was on my team, so the mine was friendly 'till he hit it, thinking it was a frag and would be funny &gt;&lt; 
---
For clarity's sake, we -do- throw a lot of frag mines at each other and then hit them for lols..
---
I‚Äôm not interested in a pissing contest, if u don‚Äôt wanna help that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm just looking for help here.
---
I second this question
---
Yea what jet pack plan are you talking about? I haven‚Äôt fought the queen since the latest patch yet I don‚Äôt guess.
---
The problem is that some information (mod locations for example) changes over time when new patches are applied. So it's understandable that sometimes people can't be bothered to write something up if it's going to be inaccurate in a month anyway.
---
Well that's bullshit
---
I'm not condoning them being buyable with Atoms, last thing I would want.
---
My main idea was why these were even being considered in the first place. I would love to build a bunch of these (can even be something like 5 or 10 of each "main" material like Steel, Wood, Screws, etc) to have if my theory about the dungeons holds any truth.
---
They should've left it as it was in Fallout 4...
---
Ah, no. I was referring to myself - I love RP, but go and no joy doing it solo.
---
It‚Äôs not a thing to worry about I believe. The items would still be in the source code (so other players who‚Äôve unlocked it can still use it) so there‚Äôs a high chance it‚Äôll return as a pack with other items or likely ‚Äúanniversary‚Äù items later down the line
---
Awesome, things to do when bored in the wasteland frag grenade baseball
---
If you need steel drop your camp at ve lumber or new gas and kill everyone end everything then served hop and kill again, each run I usually get about 255 steel and idk a bizillion wood
---
I was doing Census Violence earlier  tonight and a 2* legendary ghoul came in one of the waves. I let it regenerate, then killed it, severing an arm in the process. The main body loot was 4 caps and a wonderglue. I backed off without looting, intending too give it a few seconds to load.
---
Backing up I passed over the severed arm. There was my legendary drop with matching ammo. Baffled, I went back to the main body. Just the caps and glue still. Checked the arm again, gun and bullets only, nothing else....
---
Something is (still) supremely fucky with legendary drops
---
There is a giant collection of nerfs Bethesda "accidentally forgot" to put on the patch notes, so I'm not surprised they didn't mention it.
---
Roughly the same radius as a blast zone.
---
I made a simple camp last year and have not changed it or it‚Äôs location.
---
I simply gave up and concentrated on other things than my camp.
---
If I want my building fix I play Fallout 4 with all my mods.
---
T-60 plans for me
---
Find a good build that works to your playstyle and get all the perks and gear.
---
Be smarter about how you move. The element of surprise is actually important here compared to Adventure so stay crouched to avoid being VATSd and showing up on the radar.
---
Use Adventure if you're just grinding for ammo, mats, farming, etc. Use Survival if for faster level ups.
---
The reason for your lack of damage against other players is either you lack damage output with your weapon and perks, they have superior defenses through legendary armor and perks, or a combination of both.
---
These are scheduled to be removed in next patch this is not a *drill*
---
I'm still laughing from this...
---
Im having to be very ruthless in the scrap I keep.  I‚Äôll only keep ‚Äú10‚Äù of anything junk wise and ditch the rest.
---
I‚Äôm now having to look at possibly ditching any 2* items as well
---
WS train station vendor sells them, costs a couple thousand though.
---
Mods on the level 20  vs no mods on the level 50?
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying. Using your hypothetical example of them being created as a means to assist players in completing ‚Äò1 run or done‚Äô style dungeons would mean...Bethesda purposely designed the new dungeons/repair kits with P2W in mind.
---
Thanks. With my new character, I'm getting quite a bit of Quads, but still I haven't seen any Double in the past 1000 drops. I haven't seen Double at vendors either.

I‚Äôm gonna start to make a new build soon, as for me not being damaged, I have a tse handmade and pump shot gun which do a decent amount of damage so Idrk

Sorry to interject but he's saying he's "gotten them all" meaning all 4 available from the side quests. Nobody has gotten any others yet

Of course you weren‚Äôt. but I like your thinking for another way of doing it

This thought. This thought here. It‚Äôs plausible and I don‚Äôt like it
---
Yes, while wearing a bearhat (coming soon in the Atom store) and drunk on Vodka.

Not really a pissing contest when you keep piling bull crap on the table. Someone with a bleeding heart is bound to come along and fall for this. I just found your tale amusing. Hope to see yo

---
If the enemy has Sentinels or Assassin's armor pieces, they heavily mitgate incoming damage from. 
---
With the Dense Torso mod and Fireproof 3, explosive damage is almost trivial. You can't really on the explosive damage against them, so make sure you're shots are landing. I hear Anti armor weapons and perks are a good counter.
---
It comes from one of the other side quests posted on the board in Calvin's office. For the one you did that was the only reward for me too, the other mounted heads come from the other quests.
---
Aah. Well you could always get a group of buddies together or even find a group here that does that.
---
Seriously. It's like, "four walled shed with a roof? Nope, that's floating. You can check out the wooden spaceship nextdoor though."
---
For the custom flags, it could work like Call of Duty‚Äôs emblem system, where you can upload it to a database for others to download to represent. That could tie in with player made factions, where a hub in the menu could be created where you can look at factions (like Clash of Clans‚Äôs Clan system where you can see if a clan is open, or search it up, and could be level locked, like one faction could require players to be lvl 100 or above, whilst the other could be any level).
---
Also got t60 and t45
---
and occassionally player negligence... be level ??? outside of PA, stand by cliff, and get knocked off by mole rat. Fall down and die.
---
Btw i originally was gonna stroll by and drop off random jump but you can't be added due to privacy settings. Might wanna change that so your "hero" can come along.
---
Yeah that's true. An assaltron pushed me off a building in watoga once
---
The V.A.T.S bug is back too, you can have 95% accuracy and miss 50+ shots on the same target. Re-entering vats usually fix this, but it was fixed the patch before.
---
Bethesda have said they are aware and investigating, hopefully they fix it soon.

You'll need to use the most current version, and also follow the instructions to install, including making a Fallout76Custom.ini file with the sResourceArchive2List set up properly.
---
The most current version doesn't have saving of loadouts, only loading them from Nukes &amp; Dragons perk loadout URLs stored in PerkLoadoutManager.ini file in the Data directory alongside the PerkLoadoutManager.ba2 file.
---
If you need more help, ask in the NexusMods forum, you'll get more responses.

Bethesda customer service answered him in less than a week?! Story lost all credibility right there.

As someone that started Survival on a level 15 build and now at 56, I can tell you that it's far far easier than you think avoiding other people.

Despite the previous poster's unhelpful statement, you do need to relearn this game since the game mechanics aren't the same and  your previous experience doesn't always apply correctly (because previous series used different game mechanics)
---
I'm glad that other F76 player is able to hook you up with better gear. Since there's no cross platform play I can't be that guy. I do recommend looking for power armor as an alternate. 
---
Yes miniguns and occasionally missile launchers do shred you up. Sometimes they shred me too, and I'm in end game armor (usually because it is a crowned one / legendary SM).
---
/u/[ImmortalWhiteFang](https://www.reddit.com/user/ImmortalWhiteFang)  is absolutely correct about gear and perk choices, not level (in general). Being L60 just means you can equip any gear in the game, not that you have good gear or recognize how to get it.
---
Consider looking at where PA locations are, and take your pick of which PA you want. Since you're a strength melee/shotty build with decently high int, you're well suited for PA anyway, or build your own (X-01/Excavator being the easy to learn ones) or receive a full suit from the Raider faction questline, or BoS questline giving full Ultracite armor.
---
Any of those would be a huge upgrade from your current set. Regular armor only exceeds PA if it is a legendary set with very specfic traits.
---
1\* Exterminator/Hunter/Troubleshooter/Zealot's: Drum mag with 85 max. 1\* Quad: Drum mag with 145 max.
---
Could be due the reload animation not finishing properly? If I start reloading and then press shift + forward to sprint, the game of course won't sprint during the animation and only after it finished. If done the right time, the reload may even not change the remaining ammo and I have to reload again. In other terms, the game enables sprinting just before it finishes reloading which sprint cancels the last milliseconds of the animation thus the reload entirely.
---
Oooh which quest?
---
Grounded, Marsupial, Scaly Skin and Speed Demon would help it's tank the most.
---
1.5k and a thumbs up?
---
I think people were asking for them. You know so we dont have to go farm screws and junk. That seems to be something people are overlooking. The convenience of repairing your item and having extra time to find the mats youre missing to repair it past max.
---
2k
---
\&gt;  I‚Äôm avoiding them until I hit level 50 
---
PS most of the quest rewards are trash tier legendaries. Don't worry about them. They're entry level gear that you'll quickly replace. 
---
Ideally you pair up with a friend, and do uranium fever (and other high spawn rate events) and also spawn farm blast zones (being in a team, and reloading into the server for fresh mobs). I prefer nuking penitentiary myself, for the plastic from scrapping lasers (and gunpowder and screws). 
---
\&gt; Cons: I have to break up the runs to get ammo on occasion. 
---
Use melee. Ammo, what ammo?
---
Cool idea! I‚Äôd like to see more of this.
---
Also got the imposter sheepsquatch outfit set I'm willing to toss in as trade along with the 2k if you're down
---
Those stairs in particular. I‚Äôd wager the concrete stairs would just slot straight in. I don‚Äôt want to use the concrete steps! :(

I got t51 jet pack plan on my only fight since patch. Seems legit.

But that's exactly how you made it sound

---
Everyone on my team somehow got the max number of wind chimes hidden around their camps.

It‚Äôs a mystery
---
I have a fix for this for pc players in mod form
---
I have already been offered 250$ a week after the event ended, but declined it at the time, due its rarity
---
Stimpaks have a head over time effect. A diluted with first aid 3 completely negates the pylon damage for me for like 10 seconds. I avoid the sheepsquatch and kill adds when I'm a conduit. Get some hits in of course, but mostly just make it chase you so the pylons stay active.
---
Can we all stop validating our comments by saying we work for fortune 500 companies?

There is a huge haul of legendaries from a recently deceased prince with no heirs, but they are locked up in Nigerian customs. I can get them out for you but it will unfortunately cost 15000 caps to pay the release fee. I cannot pay this as I do not have enough money, but if you send me the caps I can get the legendaries and give them to you. He was a very rich and influential man, so these are 3* bloodied cavalier and other popular meta‚Äôs. 
---
Let me know if you would like to proceed, I have many other people who will also be interested so don‚Äôt miss your chance!

...yikes. so you posted here cause you can't post on the market reddit cause you know this post will get removed and blocked any time cause it's against the rules and I think illegal(?) to ask for real life money for in game items. Got it.
---
It is illegal to sell Bethesda's property without their consent. If they ever catch you - you will be permanently banned.
---
Depends on which PA you have. X-01 jetpack is sold by Enclave. Others can be crafted if you buy the plans

For those of you on pc at least you can use mods. I have made one to fix this issue

I'm pretty sure dying with so little to lose has no effect on him. The only consequence to death is losing caps and waiting to respawn. You inconvenienced him by putting him at load screens. I don't think it was worth the bother
---
Ah yeah, your logic is very sound. Indeed they seem to be unintentionally breaking lots of little things all over; my theory is that they're gutting the engine in the process of all these new features. Sucks right now but I hope it means great things for the future (especially next Elder Scrolls heh)
---
Yeah...no. Have fun with that. If I see you post on the market, I'm reporting your post. Have a good one.
---
Interesting. Food seems to not be spoiling as fast for me after patch 8 though still faster than before Biv and brewing/fermenting stations were added.

Yeah I'm reporting his GT on Bethesda's site

Except they are an unlockable item which in terms of Bethesda atom store is a one time purchase and then craftable
---
Go for it :)
---
Haha. Well I‚Äôm 51 and need a carry so msg me at DAPANDA280 when your next on
---
I highly and I mean HIGHLY doubt this will happen. It's a one line change in the esm to remove these and another for syringers and they have yet to do it. The only thing stopping these two items from being legendary is the lack of legendary attach positions. It's why you only find 1 star wood armor because it only has 1 legendary attach position.
---
One thing about Surface to Air... I would warn off anyone with epilepsy or an aversion to lots of light and the screen shaking non stop due to SB screams and rockets...
---
I ran it 20+ times because it can give you 100% perfect T51b power armor pieces.  Though sometimes it is broken and you sit killing a single scorched that spawns inside the rocket launcher...while no SB show up during the countdown.
---
Sure bud.

---
Still got it?
---
Never had this, or anything like it well not on PS4 anyway, are you on PC?  
---
I say that because PC versions of games seem more susceptible to strange glitches or unusual errors.
---
I think the simple thing would be to have special foundations that count as being plantable (but can't have foundations sunk into them) and transparent walls made using a small amount of wood and bunch of glass.
---
Acting like an asshole because you play victim and then proceed to attack anyone who doesn't believe you?
---
That's toxicity. If it was so true you wouldn't be so upset as it was truth, but your lie got called and it pissed you off.

Agreed it would be a good start at the very least

Yeah this is really frustrating. Makes me not even want to play the game until it‚Äôs fixed.

yes, unless they patched it out last patch. but if they do that then no one will use the flamer at all. since the Chem bench only grants 5 per craft, 9 with max ammo smith, 18 if super duper procks

I have on occasion blocked a player, not just in game but on PSN, although I am unsure if FO76 takes into account a player blocked on PSN and not in game.  
---
Mainly for overly aggressive players attacking me and hoping to goad me into responding and opening up full PvP damage, but it no longer bothers me, because they can't hurt me, as long as I don't return fire, so I just laugh at them and do the help emote. Keyboard warriors, so much meh.
---
Thanks for raising this! I've had this bug since the last patch in addition to issues with the Gatling Plasma not spinning up/reloading fully.
---
I‚Äôve seen them at Whitespring and Watoga station but I think you have to be certain level to see them? I remember I bought the brick wall set and it took me another 10 levels or so to see the metal walls somewhere. So maybe around level 25?
---
If you're on PC I'll give you one for nothing.
---
People keep saying that over and over without any proof while the ITV article very strongly suggests that it's not the case.
---
Is this another on of those things not mentioned in the update notes?
---
* getting enough multifruit, corn and tatoes for adhesive (needed that a lot as low level)
---
* don‚Äôt bulk items and then accidentally scrap it again ;)
---
* don‚Äôt put windows on the first floor if you don‚Äôt want everyone to gain access to your camp
---
Whatcha looking for for the 50 cal
---
Damn, and here I am having gone through several characters since launch without even having seen one :(
---
If Bethesda not do a maintenance, it will not change I think
---
I'm trying my best :(
---
I agree
---
Maybe for RM yes ;)
---
They dont want to give you a chance to change your mind
---
Info to those having the same PB, replaced the custom ini, and it works again
---
I had the same problem. Applied the ‚Äúpaint‚Äù and didn‚Äôt see it (didnt see the helmet at all) But for some reason I had to re-equip it in the PA station and it was vissible. Try that!
---
These are the first I'd seen. Be careful what you wish for, I guess. Could be you'll run into a pack of em. xD
---
Just take your time next time.üëç
---
Random drops. Got mine from the sheep event.
---
I dont get the windows on first floor thing?
---
Yea... I use scattershot, which makes shotguns weigh less. So I figured I'm better carrying all my shotguns instead of taking up stash space. It always changes my favourites ones for different ones in my inventory when I log in...
---
Not at that cost to me at least. The time needed to gain those caps while having fun is long.
---
I doubt in-game challenges will be as bad as the real-world ones, you know the social media ones that people re-create because they think it's cool but might actually cause harm. Stupid is as stupid does.  
---
Next, up the lemming challenge, join a group and all run and jump off a cliff, should remove some stupid from the gene pool.  
---
The in-game equivalent, the nuclear rain challenge, have a group bunch up, at least one person launch a mini-nuke straight up, and three, two, one, stand perfectly still and hope to survive.  
---
Bonus points for snapping a photo close to or at nuke impact.
---
If you put a, let‚Äôs say, armor workbench right behind a window, people can start crafting from the outside, meaning they will end up in your camp ;) that way a locked door won‚Äôt really help.
---
Sorry im not. Thanks though.
---
My weapon? A gtx 2080.
---
My defense? A stable internet connection.
---
I will keep that in mind. But I already fixed it by reinstalling the game several times.
---
Are you on Xbox ? If so I could probably sell you one.
---
Plan on it! Lol
---
Xbox?
---
Gtx 2080 would be nice I agree
---
Will there ever be an update where we can finally place junk in our camp? It seems like such a waste to bring out all this amazing collectible stuff we have never even seen in any of the other Fallout games, where we actually would have been able to make us of it, and then force us to scrap it all.
---
Yup.
---
I‚Äôm a huge Bethesda Games fan. I recently bit the bullet too. I‚Äôm loving it. I‚Äôve bought 2 copies so me and the wife can play together. Having a great time.
---
I have a cool new fedora, and that's good enough for me.
---
Yeah lvl up 3 times for a mere 10 atoms is a joke. Why they make it harder to earn atom is to boost their atom sales. Real sad move on their part.
---
Can we please switch back to the two click repairs dev team?
---
It means that the speaker is too lazy to type out "materials", that is the items needed to craft an in game object.
---
the whole new "examine to repair" thing really sucks, not only does it cause this issue you're referring to but it's also an extra button step for no reason what so ever.
---
To give benefit of the doubt, they possibly saw it as a minor thing and never considered the following:
---
They probably would have costed maybe 5 or 10 Atoms each (would be stupid if it was more than that) and were chosen as the product to feature that is non-cosmetic due to their importance in the dungeons.
---
Similarly like how I can use...whatever the currency is for ESO. Vanilla ESO is already such a bang for your buck that the use of original currency and microtransactions ultimately do not drastically affect your difference in gameplay or anyone else's. I can *choose* to pay irl money for this mansion but I can also pay this mansion with the Septums I earn naturally through gameplay. FO76 does not have this level of balance as of yet. I can only buy a Princess Castle Bed with Atoms and not with Caps, which is ultimately ok because it does not alter my nor your gameplay experience. What is not ok is *only* being able to buy this super-advantageous Rapair Kit through the Atom Shop and not being able to craft it whatsoever. Nor should I have to buy the Repair Kit first in order to begin crafting it. The fact that I can be forced to quit this dungeon because I have no weapons to use   but SwagDaddy420 can continue to go on because he paid slightly more money than me on this game is absolutely not ok.
---
You need to have Plan to craft or mod plans selling vendors mods also but they are random i have on sell plans t45 and t60 on ps4
---
People were asking for this when weapons broke as often as wet paper, which is no longer the case. Maybe it's because I've gotten better at item management, but I seriously can't remember the last time being caught off-guard by the message "Your ________ broke!"
---
3* lvl 50 with +50% limb damage and +1 agility
---
That was about 2 patches ago.
---
Huh I thought they patched it with patch 8??? Is the bug back after the last hotfix??? Unbelievable....
---
Good discounts? Atom Store or robot vendors?
---
I still today/ tonight
---
We had some weird issues the other night.  I rarely use headphones and mic, but spent a lot of time with a new friendand noticed problems with players hearing each other, etc.  I think it‚Äôs got something to do with bugs in the chat.
---
Anywho, if PC try having everyone set to Area chat, and retest. You may have already tried it.
---
Survival or Adventure?
---
Adventure my friend
---
Hmmm interesting.
---
I'm the new frat house
---
These are two things, a math that worked correctly and a bug of how its displayed.
---
Mainly, lets say you shoot a 300dmg bullet at your enemy. You see their health go down by 300, but then you receive message from the server that actually his armor negated 298 of that, hence ge loses only 2hp.
---
The armor used here has been cavalier armor that negates 15% damage while sprinting per piece. My cavalier build can sprint for almost two minutes and what yoymu describe is what my enemies often see. I get called cheater for that, but its just a build that has been completed fine. Use vats to take such guys down, not the only way, but the easiest one.
---
I understand what you mean but fallout4 only runs on one machine with one user meaning not everything is rendered all time.
---
It's hardly the same in 76
---
They literally used the word unlockable in the ITV and they are already in the data files as a constructable object
---
As a carnivorous cannibal, I too appreciate the value of a good meal! Sounds like you're doing the Responders proud.
---
Huh. So basically horde events are almost always broken. True in my experience
---
I looted one assassin cavalier and two something-else-cavaliers this week, survival has been good to me.
---
Incompetency incarnate.
---
Yeah that'd be great
---
I just recently picked up a Gauss Rifle and it makes the same sound as the Lever Action Rifle!
---
Not to mention bringing back the old overweight/vault 76 respawn bug.
---
It‚Äôs that very reason I have other characters with camp in very remote locations. And for that I always logout at V76 or a train station as well as sneak when fast traveling back home.
---
Is the tagging of enemies the same as using recon scope? As in changing equipped weapon loses the tags? (because strangely binoculars are regarded as weapons).
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the problem it‚Äôs brainless and takes a couple press of the buttons and then rinse and repeat lol I understand where this man is coming from I feel his pain
---
I use throwing knifes on my huntress character and I like the aim only skill shot part of them. For what they offer 75 damage for the knives it‚Äôs worth it. Adding them to vats just mucks up the flow of battle. 
---
Imagine some pinhead who builds a complete stealth build that just throws knives vats while chameleon‚Äôd and you have very very little to do
---
He's misspelling the common name for the headquarters of the All Russia Insurance Company, where nothing sinister ever happened at all.
---
They actually stack, so you can get all three in one go. Much better than the old "actually level up 3 times in one session, somehow."
---
No fight today..
---
You could try the "block from session" in the social tab. See if that helps.
---
Just like rifleman builds? Haha
---
Dont see the issue, its fallout, not CoD my dude
---
Own a workshop. If you have pacifist mode on they can't hurt you. Go offline in your systems settings.
---
Thanks for great posts.
---
Your ideas for drugdrinks are awesome, but the proposed quantities are too harsh. Its cool for the deathclaw morph one, as you'd need to kill a mothman and a deathclaw in quick succession to craft it, but the other values are extreme, 5 canned coffe? :(
---
There's a mine back behind the white springs train station. Visit there.
---
Oh well...
---
Depends on the perks
---
Nice guide. Something tells me a junkie melee build would be considerably worse than a junkie range build, just because of the loss of strength.
---
ü§î Hmm though.. That being said if you ran junkie melee with party boy / girl, one alcoholic beverage could probably bring you back up to neutral.
---
Might be tempted to experiment at some point.
---
I have a nocturnal explosive I would sell you,  the nocturnal perk is a crappy one.   I think I paid 2.5k caps
---
Yup, it's an Atom store thing
---
I've had stuttering and freezes more recently. Haven't changed my settings and my connection is fine so I'm not sure why. I'm on PC.
---
I have an anti armor dragon I‚Äôm looking to get rid of. Maybe you could defend yourself with it if you have a rifle build?
---
I love my tesla. I have seen recently people using the auto and it looks great. I hope they fix this.
---
They've all bought sentinel/assassin legendary armor, which makes them essentially invincible in PVP.  Assassin is -8% player damage per piece, and sentinel is something like +50 damage reduction while standing still.
---
You can literally google legendary items and buy them with real money from other players, no matter the platform. Its a booming business for multiple online games that involve any kind of trading system. You pretty much friend someone on whatever platform, join their world, and they give you your TSE shotgun or sentinel/assassin armor for like 20 real world bucks.
---
I post this no not so that people go do it, but so that BETHESDA DOES SOMETHING. Like take away all the god tier items, or break them into their individual legendary effects
---
What is AA? Sorry, haven't had the chance to play in a while
---
Ohhh no fair! Don't want to play?
---
How can you deny access with  vats please explain without the use of stealth boys I‚Äôve vats opponents from pretty far distances you have the advantage by far if your a vats build against a non vats build
---
Should of stormed in quicker next time
---
They do in fallout 4 even. So can‚Äôt be hard to implement. I imagine it‚Äôs the NetCode that‚Äôs in the way
---
This is the exact reason why I took mine off
---
Never thought he‚Äôd miss that desk job.
---
In survival mode during events people cannot be hit, and after its over its a free for all.. I kind of like it
---
difference between 5-45 yes, difference between 40-50 negligible.
---
I didn‚Äôt know about this ü§î interesting. However my junk extractor, purifiers and camp are open to the public.
---
I do not trade with other players, especially if they have a weapon equipped, even if this has been fixed.  
---
I get people asking for a trade, but I just emote no, usually they accept and leave but occasionally a player gets grouchy and either hits me or keeps asking.  
---
( A situation that translates to real life. I care not if you don't like my answer, don't give me a choice if you don't accept anything beyond what you just want me to say )  
---
\-   
---
Stocking up on trade items for when player trading machines actually happen, which is next month apparently.
---
I found this - obviously intended given the perk that goes with it - mechanic frustrating.
---
As such my CAMPs are extremely mobile and utilitarian where the most you are going to 'wreck' is the item I am currently using and only if you catch me off guard using it.
---
Needless to say no atoms have been spent 'purchasing' fragile CAMP items as there is little incentive to make use of them.
---
Until such time when private servers are a thing, I am no longer set up to be the source of someone else's fun at the expense of mine and I can finally oust the Fun Police for good a pragmatic approach is necessary.
---
All mods are bugged since last patch
---
It‚Äôs ok dude we‚Äôll get to -50 eventually.
---
Damn lol I've never been a fan of the nocturnal perk does it take away base damage during the daytime?
---
Anti-armour
---
Any idea if it effects all the armors or just the X-01?
---
Keeping ban lists forever would mean a database that Bethesda just doesn't want to have to deal with.  No profit in it for them.
---
Shhh...
---
You don't want them to fix this.
---
There's currently a glitch with adding mods (as in the boxes you pick up in the world), where the sound plays but they don't apply
---
Yes,  worse during the day better at night
---
That must be one of the dumbest posts I read in here.
---
First, if you have your own invisible guys placed such that they get line of sight to target only after target emerges from a corner, then you can shot them down before they retaliate, mostly. You also have the sniper guy behind that sees all and snipes the vatsers down. Long range headshots can be devastating.
---
When you sneak, the range from which you can be vatsed decreases. More sneak, shorter the distance vats works. More perception of enemy, longer the distance.
---
Any boxed mod can't be applied right now. Be it armor, power armor or weapon.
---
In my game it's 5:13 am and the gun says 64 dmg...
---
I'll see what it changes to
---
Gotcha üëç thanks
---
That'll be like using water gun with printer ink, there's never enough acid
---
Alot of weapons and armors are affected i have like 3-4ish mods ive tryed to put on things baseball bats to armor mods ive seen a couple other posts about it today hopefully its fixed with the dungeon rollin out here soon wouldn't expect anything till tuesday.
---
I place a portapotty if there isn't one already. We're rebuilding society. Society has toilets.
---
Trying to talk a customer out of a purchase sounds like a firing offense.
---
I know it would be where I live, and I live in *France* where it is famously hard to fire anyone.
---
This is good to know. My brother and I run a mod shop and was getting worried. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. Guess we just craft the mods till then. Thanks üëç
---
Not this dude again... one bullshit posts after the other.
---
You doing something to be a contrarian is not being a person of your own opinion. It's finding the popular opinion and doing the opposite, you're still a slave to what other people say/think/feel.
---
great article but a thumbs up just for ''Challenges became an Alcoholism Simulator game''
---
Thanks, is the 63 damage with no reciever mods?
---
Chill out Satan...
---
Same, I thought it was just the mics
---
I have it modded to powerful automatic receiver
---
Powerful automatic receiver
---
This has been my strategy too. I'm keeping all the legendary leather armor and super light melee weapons.
---
8:06 am 64 dmg still
---
Gather purified water. With hard bargain rank three, that‚Äôs 5 caps a pop. Get two workshops with purifiers plus your camp. I had over 200 with a few hours and this is just a background resource you can get while going out into the Appalachia and getting other things to sell. 
---
Harper‚Äôs Ferry is a great place to go to get assault rifles and laser rifles which sell nicely. 
---
Also you can equip green thumb and pick up the razorgrain and corn which sell for 2 caps a piece but you can get over 200 with a run. The farms are southwest of sunshine industrial. 
---
Watogo high school and sugar grove have lots of plastic so you can bulk up your extra resources. 
---
These are the methods I use to get my 1400 caps every day üòÉ
---
Hope this helps bud
---
&gt; Make sure there is a decent return policy. 
---
Bwahaha!
---
But... Is it the Deathclaw that has 10% health or should the player have 10% health?
---
Who knows, maybe they've legit got calibrated shocks. Doubt it though lol
---
Accidentally bought the vampire outfit a while back, never used them and don't want to, they should add a confirmation button, but also something like Fortnite, where you can self-refund 3 items per account, no matter the price or time passed.
---
This.
---
I have two executioner regular 1 stars, you can have one
---
Not 100% sure but I think I got them from Watoga Station. Were pretty cheap as well.
---
Yes, they're pretty standard for the Watoga or Boss vendor. Now that Whitesprings has all faction vendors and plans are no longer random it should be pretty easy to get it but if you have any struggle let me know and I can probably help you get it.
---
K thx
---
Beat me to it, they're this seasons explosive vents.
---
If your on Xbox, I would love to visit üòÉ
---
Just when I decided I need some explosive vents too.
---
I mean I dont think it should be removed but it should be made so that you cant hit critical with every shot. A sligth nerf at best. But like I said, pop a stealth boy and you are covered
---
I wouldn't mind some consistency. Place one prop and 75%+ of it is inside rock or the ground and it places fine, try with the next piece and a tiny fragment of rock or stick just grazes the prop, making 0.005% of the prop in scenery, won't place. There is zero consistency with regards to where you can place props.
---
Omg i hate that so much lol
---
It says your world is full can you join my game?
---
&gt; The game was horrendous on launch and bugs known years ago that were in fo4 were not fixed in fo76. And what is worse those said bugs were fixed by modders also years ago. 
---
That's not a fact, it's bullshit.
---
&gt; Various scandals
---
Nothing to do with the game.
---
&gt; the general direction Bethesda was going.
---
Where are they going?  West Virginia?
---
&gt; Bethesda is a profits oriented entity
---
No shit, Sherlock.
---
By the way, the plural of sheep is "sheep".
---
I have another handmade with the powerful automatic receiver,  53 dmg so the explosive is adding 11 during the day
---
In fallout 4 you could anchor certain items off of unoccupied power armor then move the armor.  That could lead to some REALLY messed up builds in 76
---
Thanks, I was a bit worried - I'll just wait until they patch it then.
---
Okay I‚Äôd like to test this sneaking out but I‚Äôve come to terms with me being a shotgun build with assasin sentinel if I come face to face with a rifle vats crit build I will usually lose the fight unless I get the jump on then
---
Yes, joining now
---
&gt; Objectively, it's a terribly put together game.
---
Objectively?  Measured how?
---
Thing is I don't use power armor, usually when I restart the game and launcher it fixes, I'm wondering if its from lag or leaving the game at the main screen afk for awhile before entering a world, etc.
---
I'm level 17 on PC. Discord is ChrisK#3420 for anyone who wants to play add me.
---
In-game I am Thugs4Hire.
---
Weird, I don't know why it's happening but it's annoying
---
Travel to Twin Lakes and follow the river to the right. Eventually you end up at a lake/pond with *something* in the water. Go poke it.
---
seriously?
---
It is an outrage that there's no recipe for a nice MLT (mutton, lure weed, and tato sandwich), where the mutton is nice and lean and the tato is ripe.
---
&gt; Well, you should have tried the garbage they released from day one. Crashing every 5 - 10 minutes. Losing gear and loot and progress. 
---
I did.  it didn't crash every 5 - 10 minutes (for me).  
---
&gt; You weren't playing before they broke out the PVP server and the main server. That's why nobody attacked you.
---
I played from beta on.  I was attacked twice, retaliated once, died.  Decided not to do that again.
---
&gt; It may seem like the ranting, raving and bitching was over blown. 
---
It was.  Hell, some people were so obsessed about trashing on FO76 that they started making up nonexistent bugs and exploits -- apparently there weren't enough real ones for them.
---
Bought the plan from the whitesprings brotherhood vendor this morning as it was unknown and when I clicked on it I had ‚Äúsavaged Assaultron head already known Sheepsquatch imposter Assaultron head unlocked‚Äù couldn‚Äôt find it in my benches either so this is where google brought me lol
---
&gt; I'm on PC and from what I know I think it is/was more common on consoles.
---
I'm on PS4 and never saw any greifing -- always thought it was all happening on PCs.
---
Nah, bunch of scruffy NPCs would just lower the tone of the neighborhood.
---
You DO have to if you want to do the event on your own accord. Server hoping for an hour to find one isnt practical. Your arguement is ridiculous and comparing me to Hitler is the weakest thing I have ever seen.
---
I agree and yeah but stealth boys aren‚Äôt working on the wheel currently which sucks
---
Given the difficulty of getting it,rare drop from tech data, and how good it looks,  its surprisingly cheap unfortunately.  Sub 1k for sure.
---
Yes but the whole point is currently those challenges bring 5 atoms.
---
Thank you I got it awhile ago and didn‚Äôt think much but saw some dude selling it for 1.2
---
Interesting theory -- Bethesda engineered the launch catastrophe so people would come in with low expectations and love the game more... :)
---
Does that bonus still work if you‚Äôve attached mods to them?
---
Extremely difficult does not mean impossible. They likely didn't remember they attacked you months prior and sought you out, they're just a dick to everyone.
---
I must have spent over an hour going top to bottom in that place and even after I read this post, I still took a while to even see the dang car. Talk about feeling stupid...
---
&gt;  Ive found 1 code in last 30 hours of gameplay its getting a little stale.
---
Just toodle on over to nukacrypt.  they have all 3 codes, good for 2 more days.
---
 I thought multiple people could harvest from the same crop.  
---
Is this not true? Huh.
---
Just rename all your gear to
---
**Roboto**
---
*High damage*
---
Etc... it will group them together at least
---
Ok, thanks. I can also, if I do it in the first 5 minutes. After 5ish minutes, I get a forever loading screen
---
nice, thanks for the PSA
---
Hi, can you please delete this post? The extra 100 is a bonus you get on load if wearing the armor. It's a bug and people don't talk about it because bethesda will fix it and we will lose it.
---
Many Thanks!
---
Well it worked lol
---
Assassin sentinel armor is only useful at extreme ranges, when the enemy can't vats you, or with stealthboys. Otherwise its trash, tbh. Not the best choice to go with shotguns.
---
You are correct, I can join a friends world without quitting, but the same thing happens. But it‚Äôs weird bc if I join another world in the first 5 minutes of play, it will load. If I try and join after 5ish minutes of play I get the forever loading screen.
---
If your Excavator-worn carry weighty capacity is in the 400's (avg. build) you're seeing it correctly.  If you're re-logging to get a higher weight in the 500's, you're looking for the carry weight GLITCH that is still present which (incorrectly) gives you an ADDITIONAL 100 capacity if you're already wearing the Excavator before you log in. This "glitch" disappears if you exit the Excavator and re-enter it.
---
If the legendary effect +25 Rads isn't directly added to the armors stats, it is broken.
---
Usually the 25 rads are added to the items stats in it's description.
---
Yes! I have a bloodied heavy gunner build and my 1\* Bloodied Gatling does something like 400 damage, it's fantastic. Kills SBs in a few seconds.
---
I farm tech data, the prices for apparel is depressing given the time involved. 
---

---
If you're on PC hop on survival and you could try and shoot me in the face all day. Unlike most of the posers on here claiming to be raiders, I actually wear raider gear, so I'd be just like fighting NPCs.
---
Oh wow
---
If its a trading post, sometimes the amount of inventory in one spot, lags the inventory from showing up in your pipboy and glitches the trade button from showing up for some parties.
---
It's good to dashboard or ft to the same spot, usually fixes that issue. I think I know which trading post you are talking about if you are on xbox lol the people trading are usually in their own group chat so they wont be able to hear you
---
You're going to get that guy trolled by wanna be raiders.
---
After server hopping and finding 4 servers that also dont have the 3 hour refresh timer active :P
---
Ive got them from the vendersupermutant that travel the world.
---
yes thats true \^\^ but i think it will be more accessable after a few days when everyone has done the questchain
---
i think with this share method you get more events/hour than just server hopping
---
I never knew this thing was 'rare'.
---
I have left quite a few of these plus bomber jackets and the rest in the 'drawers' under the 'mailbox' where you 'deposit' the Technical Data in my endless quest for the PA paintjobs.
---
I guess my perception is skewed by how very little success - and where I say very little I mean 'none' - I have had with the WS Jumpsuit etc vs these; I genuinely was under the impression that they were fairly common.
---
I don't really regret it though; I hope people found them as a nice surprise rather than just being eaten by the servers.
---
People were assaulting employees over not being able to get refunds due to the game having a digital code rather than a disc, they should have stopped carrying the game after that started happening and sent back remaining stock to Bethesda.
---
No.
---
Only yesterday I got 1\* and 2\* legendary items from 3\* max level legendary enemies.
---
In fact for me this remains the norm and getting a 'star appropriate' legendary drop is the exception.
---
Thank you. I don't know why I couldn't remember that, it's so damn obvious now...
---
I added a hardened reciever to that rifle and when I have it unequipped in the pip boy the damage says 103 but when I equip it, the damage goes down to 67. Any idea why?
---
I‚Äôve got the Exact problem, filled a ticket and they said it was my console, went and got my spare PS4, same problem, they then blamed my internet which is rapid and wired, they then blamed my disc even though I said it was digital, then finally they say to me ‚Äúthere is no known issues‚Äù

should I buy pajamas?

(YES! Chinese armor! assault rifle when?)
---
I posted about this months ago and got downvoted because people thought I was just insulting their mushroom towers
---
But the number of items to be loaded in for each camp had a hard limit on it, so it shouldn't matter where they are placed, just that there is only X amount of items to load in
---
I never team up with people cos they wanna talk, and I dont like using a mic. So yeah, there‚Äôs that
---
My legendary enemies disappear after I kill them
---
Do you usually submit one or two data at a time? I've mostly been doing one and I've got 1 bomber, 0 science scribes and about 10 of the various engineer type ones.
---
Wow so many people are having this issue can we bump this thread or something??

I get that there's nothing to melt or boil, but if its hot enough to burn/melt through steel, it can definitely burn through freakin leather. Now some kind of ceramic or space shuttle tile-like thing... that'd be friggin laser proof. Literally engineered to dissipate ionized air (aka plasma) coming down from orbit through an atmosphere.
---
I could buy that combat/marine/power armor is some sort of composite material that defends against both. I could also believe anything having some kevlar woven into it.
---
The real question is: what would armor made out of disco balls do?
---
I don‚Äôt wanna talk, I just want the benefits
---
I only get 3* stuff from the sbq, very very rarely seen another one, I cant even remember finding one
---
1k
---
To the people that build floating houses... use the Steel I-Beams so it looks like it is supported. But to be fair I am not a fan of the owners of these ‚Äòmushroom‚Äô houses. Usually dicks, I had one near me and I was thinking ‚Äòoh a neighbour, pretty cool except a bit immersion breaking camp.‚Äô All he did was sniped my Brahman and crops from his repunzel tower. Not the first time either someone was not nice using this building.
---
Yeah this happened to me.  Crashes to desktop every time.
---
At one point if you got a random invite they would just fast travel to your camp, break team and destroy it. If I get a message saying someone needs help or has mutations, I'm all in.
---
They're not great. Not terrible,  but there's better.
---
Make a laser fight look fucking awesome, that's what or would do
---
I sent messages too, no avail. I understand what your saying though. I don‚Äôt trust people either but I will say that it does seem like most of the raiders have switched to survival. I haven‚Äôt really had much trouble with workshops lately
---
Yet you ignore hellfire torches which are just like annis only the hellfire torch you get is random and can be for any class. Not a guaranteed hellfire torch for your class or skill tree. Which js exactly what people want here and are asking for. They arent asking for a TSE. 3* or bloodied/sentinals 3*. Just that sheepsquach will drop a random 3* legendary, be it a useless wooden armor piece, or rolling pin.
---
That is no different than how every other online loot game works, the end game bosses that require a very large payment JUST TO FIGHT the boss. There has to be a worthwhile reason to spend that much caps or the DLC will be forgotten because no one will want to waste that many caps for a boss that drops the same as mobs that don't cost 2k caps to fight.
---
You can't apply mods too - I swear, I have about 30 lbs of mods just gathering dust that I can't use. Very f'n annoying and tough on my storage!
---
30 lbs is 13.62 kg
---
Omg worth it!!!!
---
Sometimes we still visit adventure ;D
---
Easiest way to post pic is through Imgur and then copy/paste the link here
---
Also how exactly do tame animals? I assume i need a specific perk card but which one?
---
Only the other day I got a 1* junkies baseball bat from her.... not wasting my ammo anymore until it's fixed.
---
bad bot
---
Ha. Commenting about someone's karma and you only have 4k.
---
Nope it‚Äôs not instanced like looting from a safe be nice if it was
---
Well I have an anti armor and two shot dragon ready to fire side by side at your head when you show up üòÅ
---
Playstation?
---
I should not have to defend myself from assholes like that. Fighting 3 v 1 with an anti armour dragon makes no difference anyway.
---
I've got about 20 of them. Between 5 chars I've got enough outfits, ammo and gear to equip a whole BOS army. Still not got all the paints though.
---
Since survival got a cap nerf they will be back. I'm a xbox consol pleb also. I gotta crash but if you need a team for a stat bonus I will leave my GT below. I won't add items on your camp or even bother you as I farm for a store a lot. Leave me a message or send a invite. GT AquaticPlace960
---
Xbox
---
Foiled again! Lol
---
They broke mods the last patch. Wait for a fix.
---
Already did that but in order to do that..you have to k ow who it is you are blocking, whilst I am looking up their names ..they are blasting g shot out of my camp...pointless
---
I understand your frustration but I was just trying to help
---
From the outside it looks similar to mine but the inside is the complete opposite. Time, effort and care were put into it unlike me who has a ton of empty space and is missing half the furniture cause i cant find the plans
---
Good job
---
Best weapon is jump servers because Bethesda are failing us right now
---
Look elsewhere then then üëâ

‚Ä¢ [Bugs from present in fo76 that were in fo4](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/9xp6k6/bugs_still_present_in_fallout_76_that_modders/). If whatever the link is saying is inaccurate, i would be glad to know, with evidence of course. 
---
‚Ä¢ Not related to the game but still related to Bethesda. And i nvr said it was related to the game. My point for saying that is that Bethesda is incompetent in even managing such matters. And that is also a major factor in why people were 'hating' on fo76. 
---
‚Ä¢ The way Bethesda is sliding in quality of the game. 
---
‚Ä¢ I thought the fact that Bethesda is a profit oriented entity needs to be pointed out especially here. Because i have seen countless times where people were praising Bethesda for fixing game introducing new content. As if Bethesda is doing this out of the goodness of their hearts. They are not. 
---
They are fixing and releasing content to earn profits, not to please customers. From another perspective, they please customers because it earns them profits. They have already invested resources in fo76, they need a return on investment on fo76. 
---
‚Ä¢ I'm not sure why you seem so aggressive but i'm just trying to explain to OP why fo76 wasn't well received and it received all the 'hate' it got. And thanks for the spelling correction.
---
The easy way is with small rugs.
---
Thank you. Tbh I've spent an unhealthy amount of time just building in this game...
---
Normally 1 for me. It doesn't seem to change the odds however dropping 2 at a time will at least cover travel between Whitespring and Camp Venture, 1 loses caps.
---
I need to get one eventually.  I miss Gears.
---
Ok, are people understanding me, this is about camps not workshops. It's simple, disable player damage versus camps. End of.
---
I just had to dump my bunker buster.  Saved 40 weight in one go so I can keep more of my legendaries for the vendor.
---
Survival mode was never supposed to be just a pvp mode. Can we stop calling it pvp mode?
---
It‚Äôs a mode with higher risk and more punishing survival mechanics. Pvp is a part of that, not necessarily intended to be the main focus. That‚Äôs why I think they changed it.
---
i have maxed out perks equipped
---
and still cant attach purchased mods after the last update,press x and nothing happens.
---
these are mods i havent got from scrapping( like black powder bayonets)
---
Should I trade my TSE combat shotgun for a assassins hunting rifle
---
How do we get Todd's heavenly gaze on this idea? I want shiny disco armor now. Just don't make me pay real money for it.
---
Soo many amazing ones for the x01 already. So I think you may have missed out.
---
I really like the shield; it's unique and plausible to PAs yet gives an extra edge in PVP (outright disables 1-shot); needs a buffnerf like "strong explosion on shield death", "core battery drain on shield death", and "extra core drain rate" effect to compensate.
---
Dude, you should not have to hide a camp unless you are travelling Appalachia, the point is, these asswipes are just idiots who get kicks out of doing this because they want a response. Many are in groups and often sentinel armour or high spec, they want a fight, I won't give it to them.
---
I cant exit my game without it freezing on pc again
---
They're the worst possible. Assassins gives you 10% damage. Two shot gives you 25% and to every enemy. Furious is always best on high rate of fire guns. And bloodied gives you double damage with the added risk of having low health.
---
I get this exact thing too! I just attribute it to extremely high ping, but I haven‚Äôt really done any real experimentation with it.
---
Not talking about the paintjobs mate, like the new one with raider stuff, i want more of that stuff, that changes the vissuals not just by paint. 
---
And have not missed out, been playing since release mano
---
I wouldn't.
---
Something tells me you're not able to haul 300 pounds without your armor. The excavator is o ly supposed to provide an extra 100 pounds. Think about it.
---
This, I have two concrete stairs with a gap in between, it was the best I could do.
---
I'm guessing at least half my stash is legendary stuff that I don't want to sell for 6 caps to the vendors
---
Stalkers melee is the worst possible.
---
I don‚Äôt think that, yes this game was shit when it came out but I still had a good time during the beta. The devs have fixed so much since the game has come out. And yes I know this should have been done before hand but IMO Bethesda had become corporate and we shouldn‚Äôt be angry at the devs. They were given an impossible time frame to do something never done in fallout. 
---
Notice how Bethesda devs replied to all the fixes and request and things were going great but then the whole fridge thing came out among other things and there was a community uproar. 
---
Imagine yourself as a developer trying to fix the mess this game was and all the challenges it has to overcome but then realize the corporate assholes breathing down your back pushing for the max profit. There are many decisions made out of their hands. 
---
Make sure your anger is is placed in the right direction.
---
I have pacifist mode on. Idiots attack. I server hop. Game time interrupted. Minimal but sometimes substantial damage to camp. Costs resources to repair. Disruption is their enjoyment, a response is often what they seek. Bethesda have allowed this issue to go on too long, they could have sorted this in patch 8.
---
Pc has it only currently. From the dev room leak. Unless things have changed and if so.... I want one too.
---
This is happening to me on PC, yes.
---
My anger is not anger first up. It's well placed frustration.
---
Secondly, this is a major part of game development as players all need camps, it's a fundamental part of the game from the minute you have that tutorial in vault 76. 
---
Developers develop but basic game mechanics from the start should have been addressed, that was part and parcel of having a beta surely?
---
This is life, in everyday life if a problem affects many, often it gets resolved fast..in this case, it has been pushed back or not prioritised.
---
I'm having the same exact issue right now on ps4. I have the other two already done but the last one you cant complete because the quest marker is stuck on the elevator instead of the objective.
---
Not sure how to help but the bug is deffinately still there.
---
Executioners is better against players running Bloodied builds.
---
+50% if they're under 40% health.
---
I hope so ive only seen one and ive got around 150 hours into the game
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong bro, yes I want to party up and build new friendships but I don‚Äôt push it on people. I love building friends and I give what I can to everyone. For this situation I was just looking to to advance my perks and mutations. All in all, I am always ready to make friends with any vault dweller and work together.
---
I truly enjoy crafting new camps, it's a part of f76 that I love and make no mistake, I truly love this game. Stand up and fight passionately for what you believe in but let's not kid ourselves, many, many players have been calling for this update for some considerable time. 
---
I would also like to see harsher penalties for griefers, these guys hate the fact that slap damage was removed so they vent in other ways..
---
My wife hates to hear the radio so I hide them all around her camp and then turn them on.
---
It‚Äôs the little things that make this relationship work.
---
Did it unlock a new recipe?
---
I have several 'mules' that can legit amply exceed 400 lbs in Excavator using 2 x Calibrated Shocks, Motion-assisted Servos, 15 'native' STR and Strong Back.
---
However I don't really go 'Beth plz fix' if upon login I find that they have magically acquired some... additional capabilities.
---
Once the devs have fixed the 500+ documented and repeatable bugs that have been reported ad-nauseam and remain in most cases unacknowledged and unaddressed they can go ahead and fix this one as well.
---
The Fun Police has been clamping down too much on the fun and too little on the un-fun.
---
400 lbs is 181.6 kg
---
It‚Äôs using Wasteland Whisperer and Animal Friend. 
---
Funniest part is that you can pacify (but not tame) all Super Mutants, including 3*** Legendaries at West Tek. 
---
Their health bar turns white and you can interact with them. They only say one thing once you pacify them though: ‚ÄúGo Away Bleeder!‚Äù
---
Lolz.
---
im always dying to invisble enemies
---
Because it's a crappy game
---
Mine is, and the game loves it! XD
---
I agree Mike, I have a substantial amount of three star stashed away but I'm certain I won't get the result I want. It would be amazing even if I rolled for 10 new weapons from stash of 30. The tokens element is interesting though, it would be great for Bethesda to make it totally clear how this new game mechanic would work, it could stop people hoarding right now if it's unnecessary.
---
It is yeah - much improved since launch, absolutely loads to do but the core 'grind rep' is still a thing (you just have new ways to grind now). Now would be a really good time to come back actually, they're releasing a patch on the 30th that puts in a dedicated PvP mode and (drumroll please!) a 20+ hour story mode with cutscenes, voice acting, the works. 
---
Lots of the cool stuff though you may have missed as it was all timed events, but that's just the kind of game it is. The lore is all "hidden" and the community is required to uncover it patch to patch - check out this video about the ill-fated Wanda if you want to see an example of how deep it goes;
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddK7PMM\_jj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddK7PMM_jj4)
---
Do it dude :) even better if you can find some friends to play with, but I played solo for ages before roping my wife in.
---
The marker itself is hidden inside of the secret chamber. Cannot see it unless you close the door while inside.
---
&gt;so you have to spend around 2k caps to start the event.   
---
Huh?
---
Good bot.
---
&gt;Now, I'm not sure about what "mating rituals" they might be talking about,  
---
Lowe was trying to fuck an assaultron.
---
There‚Äôs some riders of the apocalypse ones in the data files, no word on when it‚Äôll drop.
---
Yeah I've been at your spot in game, working on the toons build. I have a few characters around lv170 and mules now. If you are looking for special mutations for your build let me know. After 800 hrs in game I usually just farm for specific items for crafting now. If I find a new player I hook them up with some basics.
---
Oh weird. Yeah, maybe they broke it again. I actually haven't played much since this last patch.
---
I want this too.
---
Now we can only use the 60 secs to take pictures
---
Ive seen a leak on it, and the xo1 looks like nuclear plague ish, sick af ü§ò
---
Yes, so you'll get +200lb carry weight in full excavator with calibrated shocks.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm pretty sure it was in one of the sales where they then remove the item from the store afterward. Maybe two-three weeks ago.
---
Ah, I think I‚Äôm needing to get the shocks then üëçüèº
---
I see what ur saying but blackbird, freedom states, even though they didn't add stuff like the raider, they are cool as fuck. Though I'm with you on the adding more stuff like this to the other part suits( raider pa still has zero skins)
---
Tomahawks are in game. I got the plans from an event. I haven‚Äôt even crafted any yet so I don‚Äôt know how their use compares to what you were asking. 
---
Just wanted to comment in case you didn‚Äôt know they were available.
---
I know they are in the game, i can make em ü§£
---
From what I gathered, currently not implemented as drops yet
---
those "kids" needed younger voice actors i thought they were adults at first
---
My dude, you need to know what‚Äôs actually going on here. I would be willing to pay money that the devs were just sitting in their office when someone came and said hey you need to create a multiplayer game now. They probably said ok well we need this and this and corporate said no your going to get this done by this time or we‚Äôll find someone else. 
---
Do you honestly think the devs would have released the game in the state it was in? No dude, they did what they could and it was out of their hands. What do you think the whole well let you play early if you preorder thing was about? They wanted sales. 
---
I can promise you the devs are probably as angry as we are. They were forced to do this and then now their the ones dealing with the backlash. And corporate is probably saying get this shit fixed even though it was entirely their fucking fault.
---
It's not gonna happen
---
I haven't played this game since the first month and the last straw was when I moved my base and couldn't rebuild because everything was way up in the air. I had had a lot of issues with building before that point as well. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the game. I was having a blast tbh. When I left there were lots of bugs, stash limit was hindering me, and my friends would get connectivity problems frequently. Not to mention when they would load into the game and fast travel to me all the enemies respawning. 
---
So I stepped away knowing I would be back once Bethesda had worked out some of the kinks. The issue in this post is one of those kinks.
---
If I'm alone, it's very boring. I was there with another player yesterday and it was spawning miners 4 at a time.
---
Yeah dude, I hear ya but they have had a whole stack of time since to get this basic and vital game mechanic sorted and still it ain't.
---
Doing good on basics but I could use some decent rifles bro. I only have caps to pay though
---
Could it be because unique weapons don't have paint jobs?
---
Same on PC, we had some trouble with someone taking advantage of the "if you own a workshop we can touch it and kill you whenever we want" so we blocked them, about 4 days later we randomly died by a workshop I took for a challenge, oh, look who it is, that person still on my block list.  
---
Funnily enough I have seen their name crop up in a youtube video about survival mode so they arent my problem anymore
---
Honestly I would like to just put the up in my camp as a display. Or if they could just add each type of power armor as it's own slot in the camp menu the if you purchase skins out of the atom some you unlock it for the camp display as well.
---
Oh it will. Noise creates response, it's just done on their time and not ours.
---
I don't think Bethesda ever got that specific with it. I believe it's a 25% chance accross the board. How we test this is beyond me but I'm just trying to share what I know to help who and where I can
---
Yes a lot of items gets removed to incite sales I guess.
---
I agree!
---
Yes, yes, a thousand times yes to ALL of this. I would love to be able to build a Power Armor display room.
---
What a excellent experience, thanks for sharing.
---
Good luck with the revolution chief
---
Doing it alone keeps that asshole who one shots the legendary before anyone can tag it
---
I see bethesda listened.
---
On pc you can get a mod to fix it, it's on nexus.
---
Sadly its incompatible with the save everything mod, so i haven't tested it personally but i'm sure it works fine.
---
The bug will probably be fixed tuesday, with the next patch.
---
How did you knew?
---
Noticed this one last night, too. Super annoying.
---
You should get 7600 Atoms for that challenge not   20.
---
As a first-time PC gamer as of a few months ago, I do not know much about modding and therefore I didn't realize there were even mods available for FO76 yet.  Sometimes ignorance is bliss, now I know and need to research haha
---
Instead of the dumb news post
---
I feel ya, my friend is running around farming while saving trade up for his new ranged toon. Dropping nukes and doing events, still getting ok loot with explosive prefixes. Most guns I save up for now cost about +10k now.
---
I kinda like the news post though... I don't read it but it also needs work. Like only popping up when news comes in. Once you read it I mean
---
Yeah obviously. I don't even consider that perk. Even vendors buy that with an angry face.
---
Maybe they will. Who knows ? Just wait until next Chinese New Year :P
---
Lol the Chinese don't have Power Armors. Chinese assault rifles, are they any good. The stealth armor would be OP. I would love anti-material rifles but that would also be so OP.
---
Yes. That's my complaint. I play waaay too much and server hop too much and fuck I hate that it's not even the same button to close it so I have to stop and look and remember what closes the stupid news screen.  
---
While you're at it get off my lawn.  Makes me feel grumpy and old.
---
*x-files music intensifies*
---
I like you, do you have discord?
---
Yup on PC it appears you can't apply A N Y mod to anything!  It started out at first with complaints about PA mods then by the minute it spread to everything...and they're 'looking into it'.
---
So stop 'looking' and start 'fixing'....to paraphrase your vendor bots 
---
I so cannot stand incompetency and this type of crap was NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN because after like Patch 1 you even stated Bethesda that you'd be "looking into" things that break while fixing other stuff and it won't happen again....go dust off that fake promise ffs and actually implement it, cannot trust you guys which just reinforces with every lying letter you publish.....
---
I found that auto didn't really work for me. Had to go to area. From there, I only really hear folks when they are 1. At a big event with a lot of players, 2. Eating, or 3. Talking to a friend that isn't in game.
---
Actually a friend and I both think that they DID mean to have AA work with ER, because the laser version of the Major Gutsy does pathetic damage compared to the ballistic verison. If the laser had armor pen they would actually be a threat. Same goes for all those turrets. They honestly just barely tickle. Agree though, assaultrons in general need to be toned down a little.
---
Happy cake day!
---
First they need to get around to actually adding more in along with more perks for them
---
Gotcha, thanks I'll check that out
---
Sorry man I dont get off work until about 5 CST... I dont usually work Saturday but I am for this one idk how long I'll be today either, but I'm still down to help when I can hop on.
---
Also Free State (Harpers Ferry)
---
I even have two bloodied Grognak Axes :) I seem to be really unlucky with legendary ballistic weapon drops but I got a nice amount of good melee weapons.
---
I'm waiting for the silver handmade and i can bet the gold one will come out first,making me extremely frustrated on buying it or not.
---
Yeah,I don't use it often. Aquatic #3898 is my discord handle.
---
I‚Äôd definitely like to see a Chinese base or even a dlc quest about it. (Not sure if that exists yet but I‚Äôm only level 30). So far I‚Äôve only seen liberators and that‚Äôs it.
---
Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!?
---
Oh, I get it....sarcasm
---
 My main problem with this mission is that often the legendary items are not max level.  When I did play it though I did notice what the other guy mentioned.  Spawn rates increase exponentially the more players there are.
---
I try to play with others, but I've learned not to trust too easily on this game. I've heard so much about the many cruel things people have done, that it's turned me off of teaming up with anyone other than my small group of friends.
---
I also hate, just absolutely HATE random invites, whether it's a party chat invite or a team invite in game. Call me old fashioned, but I think it's rude to just randomly invite somebody without sending them a message first to ask them if they'd like to join. I dunno, maybe that's just me.
---
Anyway, I'm always up to making new friends and helping others out. I'm the kind of guy who will give people things for free (especially friends), be it weapons, armor, ammo, or junk because I see no point in charging for caps. That and I feel that if you're truly a team that plays together a lot it makes sense to keep each other up to par so that the entire team can survive. But let's face it, caps are so easy to come by in this game, and it's so quick to reach the cap limit. Charging somebody for something just doesn't make any since with a cap limit you can reach if you're a devoted daily player.
---
Anyway, my GT is the same as on here if anyone wants to gimme a holler to play. Right now I'm taking a bit of a break from it to play some other games, but I still try to hop on daily to do a sales run, but I'll run a few quests too just for the hell of it or to help somebody out. I'm currently level 110. If anyone is interested just shoot me a message.
---
First month or two of the game i could get a legendary queen at macs farm quite often. Now i never see any legendary queens :(
---
   Ok. So when you are in the shop area downstairs, go into the little cafe area where there‚Äôs no vendor bot and go up the stairs.
---
Open door and go directly to your right all the way til you hit the floor length window.
---
Turn right then take your first left.
---
Bubbles
---
Took this from someone else after a quick google search cuz i didn‚Äôt even know a bout Bubbles
---
from my experience I dropped at least twice as much stims as spoiled meat even though I carried twice as much spoiled meat as stims
---
to start the event you have to craft an item. one of the items you need to craft costs around 2000caps. (in the questline you get 1 for free, but after that you have to craft it)
---
Down vote this. Or the nurf police will see it lol
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any in weeks playing hours a day.  But a month or more ago I saw two in a few nights.  
---
It‚Äôs just RNG it seems.
---
I barely struggle with building, but I‚Äôve had to learn 37 thousand tricks to make things work haha. In one way I LOVE how hard it is to build because anyone who has invested a lot of time learning it is going to look extra good but no matter what, anyone building is swearing a lot haha
---
All the sudden I was falling!   Thanks I will.
---
Submariner uniform worn by Captain Zao in FO4 was indeed a cool looking outfit.
---
10% if mutated +  1 endurance
---
Interesting. There‚Äôs an albino deathclaw that spawns to attack my base sometimes, is it possible to tame it?
---
Yep
---
You're asking for a miracle.
---
That quote made me chuckle. Thanks for posting though as the building can be frustrating at times as is, let alone with the tedious non issues mentioned.
---
One of his pictures is a recipe for mutton chops...
---
Pretty sure this happens when you try to craft the mod but don‚Äôt have the correct required perk cards. It‚Äôll sound like you‚Äôve crafted the mod but it won‚Äôt actually apply.
---
I played UF several times this week for the PvP event, and there were *tons* of miners through the whole thing every time. Got at least three Legendary enemies each run, too. And one of them dropped a Mutant's The Dragon for me, which was nice.
---
So yeah, not seeing what you were seeing. Maybe the extractors got damaged &amp; the miners weren't spawning because there was nothing for them to beat on?
---
Here, here!
---
I bought it on release and played about 40 minutes of it before logging out.  Feel like everything I didn't like about it was simply the consequence of reading why other people didn't like it.  I was the same as you and decided to give it a go again last night, thinking I'll play it on my terms and see how I enjoy it.  Turns out I loved it!  
---
Having forgotten what other people were complaining about, I was able to enjoy it without thinking 'oh yeah, I can see what they mean' every few minutes.  The perk system is really clever and the world and quests are pretty good fun too.
---
Looking at the patch notes and tweets etc from Bethesda, it thought it was very admirable that they are still working so hard on a game they got absolutely slated for.  I've even started coming around to the idea of there being no humans left.  I get it now; the fact that every real survivor you find is an actual person is actually pretty cool.  It's a nuclear wasteland after all!
---
Well done, Bethesda, for sticking at it.  The game is a lot more fun than (I'd assume) most people expect it to be.
---
Having the same problem. tried attaching 3rd claw to dc gauntlet. I get the success sound, but the mod doesn't happen. I guess we will have to wait it out.
---
It‚Äôs shit if u die at the white springs cause then all the robots hate uüò¢
---
it‚Äôs a PC exclusive because Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care about console users. We don‚Äôt even get the depth of field sliders...
---
Yeah, getting that Event notifier is fantastic. I'd love to get that for any event in your region, really.
---
I don't tend to preview items unless I think I might get them. I don't say this as a haughty take on how to live one's life, but simply that because they haven't implemented such a feature it's the only way I know I won't accidentally buy something due to a twitchy thumb hitting the button twice, or lag or whatever.
---
It's silly I have to do this but, well.
---
That‚Äôs a great story which encompasses what fallout 76 is all about for a lot of people. Those types of experiences you‚Äôre describing absolutely make this game great for me, and I wasn‚Äôt expecting it either at launch.
---
Ahh ok, thanks for the help
---
Same here it's getting very anoying plus why two buttons just to repair.
---
&gt; And it's most likely to experience that crash if the majority of the people playing games stop buying alltogether.
---
I *wish* people were willing to use their buying power to stop the game companies from behaving badly - they really shouldn't be selling gambling to kids (I'd rather they not sell it at all, I hate gambling beyond "penny poker", but I do buy a scratch ticket about twice a year) and I desperately want to see ***ALL*** forms of "Pay To Win" obliterated, gone, and forgotten.  Sadly, too many of The Sheeple couldn't be bothered to adjust their buying habits - they're hooked on Madden/Call of Duty/etc. and, at best, might hesitatingly agree, when pressed, that they don't like how much it costs to buy the game, then pay for "map packs" and other non-free DLC and some will even rationalize Pay To Cheat by saying: *"Listen kid, some of us have jobs and don't have time to play 100 hours week - grow up, it's not cheating"*.

This old gas RC heli I have is "barely" capable of "3D flight" (or so I read on some archived forum posts), some people say no, but then some who are better pilots show that it can be done.  So I'm guessing that the power to weight ratio w/this model is just high enough to fly comfortably, not high enough to make it zip like a mosquito on crack.
---
I had one of those plastic tethered planes powered by the Cox .049 engines when I was a kid - yeah, it was fun.  But it was so sad to just be flying in a circle, on a string, and not be able to afford an RC plane.
---
Eventually I got a 4 or 5 channel setup moderately large glued balsa shrink wrap covered plane with a .40 gas engine - I tried to fly it once, got damn lucky when it crashed that nothing broke, and decided "this is not the plane to learn how to fly on" so i took it to a hobby shop and traded the setup in for a 2-channel pistol grip car radio + speed control because my then college roomate had just given me his old Team Losi JRX2 carbon fiber 1/10th scale car, without radio.  He said he wasn't gonna use it again and when he saw my eyes light up when he showed me, he was happy for me to have it.
---
I'm not so poor now as when I was a kid, but I have two kids and got myself into a bad situation buying a car we couldn't quite afford because it was going to go on a company car plan, but when my wife was transferred to another position her new boss said "no, you can't put a car on the plan if your husband uses it" - her old boss had allowed that.  
---
So, our budget, that had already been tight, suddenly went down $500 per month.
---
I've been getting "nothing is selected" errors recently. I have to close build mode and reenter just to be able to place the object. Annoying
---
Thanks a lot .dude

&gt;Patch 8 Notes:  **Environment:** Rain no longer appears to fall inside of buildings and structures when moving the camera from side to side. 
---
**\[Bug\]** Not sure if the patch notes meant no rain inside buildings at all anymore, but it still does happen: [https://youtu.be/ZbxEGVstDBo](https://youtu.be/ZbxEGVstDBo)
---
You have to be double the level of the target but yes i think so
---
I‚Äôm 130something so maybe I can handle it. Guess I know where my next perks are going haha
---
There are throwing perks in perception, but would like to see more for throwing and more for daggers
---
I'm gonna have a heart attack one of these days from a horde of ghouls instantly appearing all around me.
---
While Bethesda are at it also fix the Brick keypad door. The keypad is on the wrong side üò™
---
I either let the other players hit it first or I shoot next to them to take half their health down.
---
Gyahhhhh!!!
---
Nothing wrong with that! I‚Äôve spent at least half of my 650+ hrs in game building various elaborate camps. Like what you‚Äôve done with the place, looks good
---
Thought it was just a bug but the more time that passes without them addressing it makes me more cynical.
---
I believe I have an extra one to sell if you‚Äôre on PS4
---
Its nocturnal, dmg inreaces with the night and decreases with the day and the pipboy menu shows its base dmg before the nocturnal legendary effect and when you equip it it adds the buff if its night and takes dmg away if its day
---
Sadly, I haven‚Äôt gone back to Fallout so I can‚Äôt say. But the issue didn‚Äôt come back after I stopped playing wired.
---
taking workshops
---
I agree but i think flatwoods monster is a worse offender. He drops literal s***!
---
 Nah its ok ive got one cheers anyway
---
Oh, you the guy with Hog Heaven, I've seen that some time ago, really nicely done. Dunno how I'm gonna go about putting player vending in this lil house :D
---
I just had to Google this, how have i never heard of this before haha
---
Clever title Dr. Strangelove!
---
They only do maintenance when you‚Äôre in the bunker or elsewhere.
---
Bunnies help keep the grass short.
---
This! Why the wooden stairs can't have that same triangular shape that fits everywhere like the concrete one
---
I would send a message. I know it's a pain, but too many bastards that just want to team up, and beg for stuff. or worse, team up so that they can hassle you about buying stuff from their "shop" of rejected items. Mostly, I find that most people want to team up to do some specific thing that doesn't interest me, and I would rather not waste our time. I almost always feel a little bad ignoring them though, so a short message could go a long way.
---
Thank you.  I'm also on PS4 experiencing all of the bugs you listed, and am a fellow bloodied build.  I'd also like to add that that powering up Poseidon causes a crash, and that strange in numbers is still broken.
---
Wait is this real
---
Shhhh don‚Äôt mention that here! Big Brother B will patch/break it. They took away foundations because everyone and their cat had to make a video. Don‚Äôt mention my only refuge of fun construction.
---
Just the one, I did a detailed thread about tech data here you might find useful.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ba3oyb/technical_data_hunting_some_tips_and_data/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
My Pipe Bolt Action Pistol and my Pipe Revolver both visually indicate a fire rate of 33. I'm 99% sure that the Bolt-Action is supposed to be at 3, which is roughly the speed its shooting at (the same as the default Hunting Rifle speed). I wasted materials building the Pipe Bolt-Action and modding it out because I thought it was going to be 10 times faster than the Hunting Rifle. No big deal but still annoying
---
Well damn ok then lol do you know what times the game considers it night or day? 6pm to 6am for night and 6am to 6pm for day?
---
There‚Äôs the mr handy sweeping up after all the dead bodies by the enclave bunker back entrance.
---
So you called Bethesda and asked them if they were planning on repairing their game and they just said "nah"
---
Those stairs make me so mad
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

Should have eaten it in front of them
---
Thanks, you might recognise my name in that thread ;)
---
Used it for months, although it is less easy to install now since BSG changed settings during patches. Relies on:
---
[dukes and dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) 
---
The mod developer is really helpful and is actively maintaining it.
---
I've been using it for months. It feels mandatory at this point :)
---
There is and it‚Äôs soooo trashy not even worth the mention, you will see it later
---
I noticed this also and sometimes they are only 1 star and drop below max lvl.  I run into all the spawn holes looking for them, sometimes they don‚Äôt come out.
---
They don‚Äôt have power armor but they do have paint, find power armor and throw some Red stars on that sucka
---
UwU
---
Raiders are just lazy griefers. I know this because I have put it up to test this last days. Taking over peoples workshops taking they junk and caps. I'm surprised how easy it's to get a lot of junk very fast. Junk people invested time to collect. After some time I felt bad. I probably ruined some peoples day. Now I only take over workshops that have their resources locked. If you don't charge I'll raide you.
---
Yep same system and I get it. Annoying .
---
Look in practically any outhouse.
---
Uranium fever is never max level, max there is 40.
---
It should always have 3 legendaries.
---
The number of general enemy spawns mostly scales to the players in the mine. I ran it last night on Survival and like 6 players were inside; every new wave was like 8 mole miners. It was a slaughterhouse.
---
Ha! Hey Snoop!
---
It sure feels like it. I might give it a go after the upcoming patch :-)
---
Thankfully new players can buy the fusion generator plan from vendors now, I remember crashing on Power Up Poseidon but I only did the event to get the fusion generator back in November so I forgot about that event.
---
Yes, but it scales based on how close to noon/midnight it is. Those are the ‚Äúpeaks‚Äù of lowest/highest damage.
---
I might give it a go. Hope it's not too tedious to install
---
It looks like the only mod Single Action Revolver has is the Prime Reciever other than the ivory grip.

---
The biggest problem with SAR is lacking of a reciever like hardened reciever to increase its base damage.
---
(Prime Reciever is just impractical for needing Prime Ammos.)
---
SAR &lt; .44 Pistol &lt; Western Revolver, in damage wise.
---
15 hours and only -12. I did this with no expectations and somehow I'm still disappointed.
---
first time i did the event got a 2 shot handmade with explosive. very cool
---
&gt; Yeah I've been tempted to grab a WLToys 1/18 or 1/24 model for some time now. They've come so far I hesitate to even call them toy grade. Fully proportional controls, replaceable parts, upgradeable, tough-as-nails and fast besides...they're, at least to me, 'cheap hobby grade' rather than 'toy grade'.   The A959b is a little monster, too. Right out of the box that fucker'll do something like 25MPH and shrug off skate parks like it's nothing.
---
I got a couple *these* for under $50 each:

Yes, which makes me wonder why Lewisburg was having a spring festival in October. Or did they just never take the banners down? Lol
---
Nice I‚Äôll try, but don‚Äôt know if I will be able to show up tonight. Next time 4 sure.
---
Armor weight affects stealth. That‚Äôs baseline game function.
---
I‚Äôve heard that the chameleon armor legendary gives a ‚Äú20% stealth rating bonus‚Äù (PvE) per piece. But I haven‚Äôt personally confirmed that.
---
A right PA mod to allow unarmed weapons in PA is a must
---
I thought they were adults since using adult female skeletons and adult bikes at first!
---
Gt is Astrocreep1138
---
Fo76 us the first games in ages where you can't just look everything up without having to dig deep into the messages boards and reddit threads. We have been to accustomed to having complete walkthroughs  available almost immediately after launch, its been kinda refreshing.
---
Workshops are pvp zones.
---
I think my comment was *deleted* because of the Amazon link, so I'll try again:
---
Amazon dot com /product/B07D15P19B
---
EDIT: strange, they still have the "Save 50% when added to cart" coupon that was there last year.  When I got them there was a "Flash Deal" 20% off coupon that stacked w/the 50% off one.
---
Wait so you're saying going to white springs and killing fake legendary mobs and getting 10+ it's and then doing  something like AWOL and getting nothing from a 3\* is just RNG and you;re happy with that?  That's not RNG that's just broken.  Like I said anything like a 1\* should have a chance to drop nothing, but 2-3\* should be a guaranteed legendary item from 1-3\*. I say it should be but i'm pretty sure it's supposed to be... it's not an RNG thing, it's something they have messed up which is why i said it needs to be fixed.
---
Just like that other guy said
---
Why not both?
---
Frankly I wish all enemies had a chance at legendary loot. It would restore some mystery and exploration to the game.
---
I barely did the level up once per day variety.  If I got it, fine, but I wasn't going to grind out experience north of 150+.
---
The level up 3 times doing weird shit should definitely be a weekly.
---
I just got the plans for the shishkebab and also have the extra jet mod. Didn't work for me ethier
---
I‚Äôd buy that bear hat and outfit. !
---
Thanks for the info, im gonna have probably turn down a trade since its much less useful than i thought
---
Them adding text chat would go a long way into helping me enjoy the game more. I don't like talking out loud and pantomiming stuff with emotes gets a little old.
---
just so you know your information totally changed my play style. I've mostly been using that meathook (and another) and they're so great. 
---
Thanks for the info! I was already favoring one-handed so slipping into using the meathook was easy as pie.
---
Yes. Goooooood idea.
---
I will definitely, (definitely?) *nooot* be the one filling your camp budget with toilets.
---
Most definately. Not.
---
Oh don‚Äôt forget about ‚Äúitem can not be placed in water‚Äù
---
#UHHH ITS NOT IN IT!!
---
I set up mine south of the waste disposal site with all the big spiky structures. I don't have water or a resource for extractor but I am at a corner of the map where if I go right of my camp I get a can't go that way and right in front of it is a cliff that also has a can't go that way barrier. Can only reach my camp by its left side and carefully jumping up the cliff side otherwise you get stuck or fall through the map. Only had small things like rats and wolfs attack it but a few turrets take care of em. Its got plenty of space for crops and small water purifiers. Best part of all it overlooks a cliff with a nice view.
---
Congratulations on not being co-opted by the internet hive mind :)
---
Gonna find you... gonna kill you...
---
Fairly big difference between ‚Äútame‚Äù and ‚Äúpacify‚Äù. You cab pacify most creatures and super mutants but taming is limited to those that follow certain criteria. 
---
Taming enables you to send the critter to your camp as a pet. Pacify just means they will no longer be hostile toward you. 
---
You can only tame creatures that have random spawns, not dedicated spawns, and even those random spawns must be solo, not with anything else. 
---
There are 3 dedicated places on the map that are well known as being random spawn locations for tameable creatures. 
---
They are Cranberry Glade (SE corner of map); I South Mountain Lookout; and way up northeast of Bailey Family Cabin by Car Henge.
---
This would be good, I accidentally fat-fingered a wrong button while inspecting the new statues and ended up with a purchase I had no interest in.
---
I love seeing things like this. I'm not on PSN or I'd happily donate :)
---
name of the mod to fix the crafting bug?  I can't find it
---
I‚Äôm not on PSN either, I‚Äôm a PC. I‚Äôm guessing you meant you ARE on PSN :)
---
The cake is a lie. The perfectly preserved pie, however, is so delicious and moist.
---
Agreed, totally happens now.
---
Upvoting because folks who complain about griefers don‚Äôt know about blocking.
---
That‚Äôs a cool request.
---
Or maybe just a PA only unarmed weapon

Human time is over! Humans weak! Supermutants strong! Supermutants time is now!

So it can drop that sweet wood armor....
---
Haha yeah that‚Äôs my place, thanks! I‚Äôve seen a few camps recently that have very small ‚Äúshop‚Äù areas that only take up one or two foundation spaces but still look pretty good. But you may be able to just put a vending machine outside with some letters.
---
I love that guy.
---
I haven't used any mods, yet. What is Bethesda's stance on mods anyways? I just don't want to go with one and one day all of a sudden be at the receiving end of a ban wave :(
---
I agree. Especially now with what appears to be a random encounter when you stumble upon a group of them. If I didn't have an itch to lob a Nuka Grenade I'd honestly just avoid them entirely.
---
Anti armor
---
I think I have like 10% budget left, might be able to build like a lil tiny 1x1 thingy in front of the house ... We'll see :)
---
Killed it on my third try and was rewarded with a mutants baseball bat.... Two star.
---
Why. WHY. Is that happening
---
I've had it happen before this patch, so this isn't necessarily new. However, this week, I've had the event only spawn one actual Supervisor (the other two were regular Crown Glowing Mole Miners). That was weird, and really annoying.
---
That's just asking to be griefed.
---
Exactly! Wish they'd release an official statement for allowed mods. I only have one play through and char so does my gf. If one of us gets banned we'll no longer play which would be unfortunate because we like the game
---
Runescape comes to mind.
---
Eccept they removed it because yea, why the hell should othet players get to gank you like thay.
---
hey do you still have serums available?  Online today looking for any of these: Marsupial, Scaly Skin, Speed Demon, Carnivore, Grounded, Healing Factor
---
Workshops flag you for PvP no matter where you are.
---
No, the gold paint works in medical malpractice.
---
If I can‚Äôt access my second level that‚Äôs **my** problem, Bethesda. You just mind your business.
---
This is so sweet and is what I love most about this game. The player community is (for the most part) the absolute best and stories like this make me feel all warm and fuzzy.
---
Seriously the keypad should be on the brick not the white interior.
---
+1 for this
---
It does too doesnt it. Weird
---
If you mean MrFluffy's son I think he's level 15, I wish he was 105 üòî
---
Hadnt started the quest, was able to kill him when the event popped up
---
I think they took it out to allow for people to use interesting head pieces. 
---
For example, I have a full set of combat armor, but I have the ritual mask on top and I look menacing. I would hate to feel like I need the extra DR of an actual helmet.
---
However, they could just do what they did with outfits and put a skin over top of an actual helmet.
---
You get a notification that the event Encryptid has started just like Scorched Earth for the SBQ.
---
Yeah, the only quirk is that even though it benefits from both perks, the Meat Hook *is* classified as an Unarmed weapon, so you can't use it in Power Armor, and you'll need to be clever to use it against the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Preach. Had a random encounter with four + glowing mirelurk kings near Watoga, would normally not bother sticking around unless one was legendary; but my first play in ages (wanted to start the new quests). 
---
Some meat is not worth the resources it takes to bring them down (4 mininukes, 2 plasma grenades and a few dozen 45 rounds, along with the accompanying lever action wear). I can't think of another game where the mechanics almost discourage you from tackling enemies.
---
I misunderstood. I'm on Xbox.
---
Really lovely, so well decorated and I love your Greek letters :D
---
If you fast travel to the Whitespring enter the door, take the stairs up on your right, go through the door way and go right you should pass through a bar and dining area that's green. Keep walking and check to your left for an area where the walls turn red and white, she's over there behind a counter.
---
Got it.
---
It's definitely a departure from FO4.
---
Thank you my dude, I really like it aswell :D
---
Obviously the owner gave it a really good wax job right before the bombs dropped.
---
Being able to do ballistic weave on head gear would be cool
---
I'll feel completed if instead of turrets guarding my CAMP, I can have a few Liberator's patrolling and propagandizing the perimeter!
---
i took out half a SBQ with ~1200 ammo back when it was broke!
---
This game is best when people treat it as a co op game
---
The same happened to me and it motivated me to get a mic so I could at least say thanks properly and from then on the game improved out of sight. I‚Äôm a first time Fallouter and was told the game was filled with poisonous, ADHD shitlords but I soon learned I had been grossly misinformed. To all the high level good guys I tip my FireBreather helmet to you.
---
Oh goody, so I'm just unlucky :P
---
If someone sold it for 4k then they didnt know what they had.  You can't generally even buy it for caps, let alone such a small amount on PC.
---
I agree, emotes are fine i guess, but limited character chat would make life so much easier. After a few misunderstandings last night it got really annoying that I couldn't explain myself, hence me buying a mic.
---
Just curious, where do you get the BOS paint plans?
---
I think i've done all of the BOS quests but the one at vault tech u.
---
Well, it could be that cosmetic headgear could go over functional headgear like some outfits do.
---
From my experience in Survival mode, I'm fairly sure you can fast travel even when under fire by a player
---
I'm open to playing. I've been wanting to find some people to play with
---
Rare drop from turning in Technical Data. I‚Äôve turned in about 100 since the new paints were added. I‚Äôve got 2 more to go I believe.
---
I'm unable to mod T-60 armor since the last update. Xbox platform.
---
Could even have it so a few of the power armor perk cards also affect the medieval armor in a similar manner.
---
Speaking of helmets and head gear, I'd love if those would have some armor value... like "imma put on this heavy duty combat helmet, too bad it's made out of cardboard..."
---
Have fun storming the castle!
---
Yup. Me too and it drives me fucking crazy.
---
Yes, I was thinking the same exact thing, I love the way power armor looks on power armor stations, and it annoys me when it come back to my inventory.
---
Seeing as how I built my CAMP on a waterfall, I get this all the time smh
---
Even before the separation of Survival and Adventure most of my experiences have been positive and rewarding, not something I ever expected from an online shooter. It's great.
---
yepp
---
Still have it?
---
A lot of robots keeping the whitesprings clean, could have decided to polish it.
---
I haul 285 out of PA. But regardless, this happened to my kid's character yesterday. She died in Excavator and could only respawn at the closest location because she was suddenly overencumbered. Her carry weight showed on the map as her non-PA capacity of 205 lbs. She was carrying 208 lbs of stuff and she should have been able to carry 300 or 305 in Excavator.
---
I feel that's ultimately one of the best things about 76 too - it's a game that encourages and allows you to simply be *nice*.  Pretty much every other survival game in the market is a dog-eat-dog, backstabbing experience that encourages players to be dicks to one another.  But how many games let you make someone else's day?
---
That's also why I don't complain *too* much about what remains of PvP in PvE.  Being nice matters more in the context of having the option not to be.  If players were forced to be nice, it would lose its authenticity.  I know that other player didn't need to wave me over to a 3\* Legendary so I could take a shot at it.  They could have killed it themselves and I'd be none the wiser.
---
208 lbs is 94.43 kg
---
This is really dope. Nice job
---
Couldn't agree more. I'm not an online multiplayer kind of person, but this was Fallout so I had to try. Glad I did.
---
That's at the Whitesprings right? Dude probably paid some extra mullah in order for to stay clean while he was at the hotel.
---
Thank youu :)
---
Good bot, have a treat.
---
Would be pretty great if that could happen.
---
You can't find any help about this game outside of reddit. Googling shit like "fallout 76 where to get X" comes up with 4 month old blog posts and "Fallout 76 fucking sucks" on the results page.
---
Like when do we get a recipie for a baked tato? They say hot potato and I want one! I want a treat too!
---
Would also love it if we could one day enter our own codes rather than be given one, QOL and all that.
---
Some people don't worry about that kind of thing. I have a jumpsuit because I was chatting with a random guy during one of the events that dropped it. Didn't get it, said I was off to find another event so I could keep hunting for it. He's like 'oh I've got that' and just dropped it on the ground for me. Wouldn't even take anything for it. 'It's just a game, enjoy.' and off he went.
---
Nay tis not EOS young Squire
---
I don't have raider armor, but I think the raider armor should get a skin with a deathclaw head.
---
If you think that's one of the things they have trouble with, you should see what they struggle with in terms of 'At it's heart it's a pure elderscrolls experience" and you just sitting there waiting to open loot boxes.
---
I‚Äôve been building taxidermy at peoples camps when they invite me lol.
---
I think Xbox/PS4 crossplay would maybe be okay but i definitely wouldn't want it with PC because of the different input methods, different settings and hackers/modders etc
---
It‚Äôs so Fucking autistic
---
It would be nice if we could manually recall our power armor. Just leave it where ever you want then open pip boy and press a button to recall to inventory. Also if you leave a server while it's still deployed somewhere it automatically goes back into pip boy inventory üôÇ
---
Right. It‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs an unbuildable zone above water no matter what
---
HEY! THIS KID STOLE MY LINE
---
Aww where's you go!
---
Your server ?
---
What about the gold! No one found his buried gold, right!?
---
Yeah I did it yesterday with 3 people and when the miners spawned there were like 7 at each spawn site
---
Yea I argree, Ive been working on my build and now Im doing 1.2k 2h damage. Its satisfying to know I can dish out this much damage but the game gets pretty boring when the only things you cant kill in 2 hits is the SBQ and a furry assaultron.
---
The alert said something to the effect "your world is being shut down for maintenance, please join another world."
---
Waa waa wubzy
---
Oh they do it on Tuesday also
---
That is his username in Reddit, not in Fo76.
---
The best part about helping others, is that if you enjoy things being a struggle for supplies and what not? You can offload so many stimpacks and what not on newcomers who need or want it. Then, you both end up having more of an enjoyable experience. :D
---
Definitely with you on the sentiment conveyed in your post though. It still honestly feels like a lot of the hate behind it were from people who never played it, jumping on the bandwagon because it became cool to hate it as a result of the controversies behind the game. But being honest about it? Even when the game was having servers barely functioning, it still wasn't a bad game (when you could actually play it). Bugs and all, it wasn't bad. Just wasn't necessarily "good". And it has definitely come a long way since then. All in all? I'm glad you're enjoying the game with the rest of us. :D
---
Is this something that happens when the game realizes you have all the Prime Receivers it could possibly give you? üòã
---
You have to sacrifice a ton of carry capacity for cores; or you have to end up sacrificing: 
---
* 3 intelligence for Batteries Included
---
If you're serious about using PA over normal armor you then need to sacrifice.
---
* 3 intelligence for Power User to lessen the need for a crap ton of cores.
---
So you've immediately sacrificed 6 stats/perk card slots. Not to mention the free plans you get are for the weakest PA with stats significantly lower than regular non-legendary armor. If comparing level 50 to level 45 (as Excavator cannot be crafted as level 50 gear.)
---
Your alternative is to grind up all of the materials to craft X-01 which is arguably worth it for Nuke Zones. Or use the ultracite given by the main quest. Except the ultracite PA requires you to farm ultracite which for the most part isn't worthwhile since you have to deal with Scorchbeasts around fissures to get it.
---
No other armor in the game has to deal with sort of resource head ache as the Ultracite PA.
---
No mods are working at the moment. Bethesda are aware and are workin. On it
---
The Enclave sure are helping, as the rightful government of this here United States of America, we are the best shot at restoring this nation to greatness. I‚Äôm sure the brotherhood can see this. You all were once apart of the fold. Differences aside,Something I do hope to see happen again.
---
I'm not sure what options still remain for pvp in adventure, but it makes sense that there should still be the possibility for aggression and you're absolutely right about being forced to play nice, it would lessen the whole experience.
---
I say just remove or greatly lessen the restrictions. If people want half their build to be inaccessible then let them
---
I'm in NSW; are you XBox PS?
---
I had 30 mini nukes i was saving so I went on a rampage and used them all. I also have been bulking my junk finally as with the new vendor cap limit its much easier to unload. I also started an alt because all my progress from beta never triggered the early level achievements so I'm just messing around to clean up those missed achievements. The start of the game is much more enjoyable now that you know everything and all the qol updates implemented.
---
Yeah, this is why I laugh at those people on r/Fallout who insist that there's no RPG in Fallout 76.
---
This was adventure mode
---
Dude if you're on PS4, itd be awesome to hang out sometime - I'm level 130 something and helping out lower level people is one of my favourite things to do ever.
---
Where I go is watoga high school just a few yards from the train station. If you go in and go straight ahead to the cafeteria, there‚Äôs tons of plastic on the tables.
---
They should do it only on Tuesday and during a set time window so their customers know when the servers will be online.
---
I played wow for years.  Do you know how many times we got an alert that the server was shutting down outside a scheduled maintenance window (screwing up in-progress dungeon and raid runs)?  
---
Never, Blizz wouldn't pull that crap.
---
Ran it solo yesterday and I had the normal number of miners with the three legendary, two 3 star and a 1 star. Got a nice 2 star troubleshooter combat armor chest piece, perfect timing to do the Cryptid event. As usual, I finished the event overencumbered from looting all the bodies. What I did notice, though, was a lot of them were staying in the spawn caves at the top and bottom of the stairs instead of coming out, so I would run in and slaughter them there after killing the ones attacking the extractors.
---
You don‚Äôt know how badly I want this..... But Bethesda usually doesn‚Äôt reply to any of this or has a active support team. But I hope someday this will happen *sniffs* someday
---
I also want friends.
---
Or seeing the fact he posted it on the subreddit of the game to get praises, a big attention whore!
---
I think it‚Äôs server lag.  I see em alive and then they make their dying noise and just a bunch of dead things.
---
Just wanna say maybe change the title a little bit
---
Yeah, but then you're stuck replacing it at camp every login. Creates an issue that would very quickly become annoying if you wanted it on display. I was thinking something like "dummies" similar to ones you might place normal armour on. Only in this case, you activate it to select power armor parts to display cosmetically over it. But to avoid potential bugs resulting in loss of armour? It is just the appearance and the armour itself stays in your inventory.
---
Seems like it but these 2 tricks will stop most of it! Developers hate it! (skip Horde events and reload events that fail to trigger).
---
Great idea for the unkillable camp update! Make it so.
---
Agreed!!! They give us the ritual binds and mask but I want more Cryptoid CAMP items...
---
Ok but the picture?
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm on PC, otherwise I'd definitely take you up on it.
---
Also can I get a broad sword for two handed n a flail or morning star for single handed melee!
---
Also check on the ground around the body. I‚Äôve noticed the actual item laying on the ground beside the body several times. When it first enters your inventory it won‚Äôt show up as legendary but after about thirty seconds it‚Äôs name will change and it will be legendary.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even care except that I was in adventure mode. I guess some people need to fight people that don‚Äôt fight back.
---
Awesome. There's interest in this thread about plans so I'll add that going forward. Eyeballing your file in a sec.
---
Workshops make a new toon run to a work shop and take it do the defend and sever hop
---
I just want to build a mountain top church for the moth. I finally spent all my atoms I collected on most of the Mothman stuff in the atom shop so I could get a start on it
---
Current bug equipping physical mods. Not sure if it's using the materials or not, but hopefully it get fixed in the next patch
---
There aren't too many.  Workshops, mainly.  Hunter versus Hunter.  Destroying CAMPs.  Those are the most hostile actions.
---
There are little things that are more a lack of courtesy than anything else.  Stealing a Legendary kill, spending way too much time at a vendor when you know others are waiting, buffing the Scorchbeast Queen when you know you're underleveled, etc.
---
Bone Raider is limited time, so it wouldn't have gone on sale
---
Someone needs to deliver the bagels...
---
Blizzard would totally do something that off putting nowadays, lol. They've gone to poo after Diablo2
---
I‚Äôve been seeing similar things with Bots on Parade in multiple locations, before the patch the enemies would swarm almost constantly but now i have to wait a solid 30 sec before one single enemy spawns and I kill it and have to wait again. Makes the event easier sure, but boring as hell now.
---
Yeah let's wait 3 weeks for that :D
---
Call it the death aura seems popular in watago and whitesprings with robots
---
You can add me if youd like @AdventureofKeita
---
Would make a good edition, and allow our stashes to be - 10 for each power armor. End game is x01 or ultricite. But we also have our all time faves like the t51
---
76 has been around a few months. Blizzard has been doing maintenance on wow for many years. Not really a good comparison blizzard doesnt have a reason to do maintenance outside of Tuesday. But they release a patch every week and sometimes there are. Ugs. Just the name of the game
---
I love the game and refuse to touch mods until they say which are safe.
---
...or... 2 1/2 days... But  yeah.
---
Robo-Rudy took it for a joyride in the Mire and still has no idea no one's coming back to find out. He just keeps cleaning it back up.
---
I didn't experience any crashes during previous patch but after latest update game has CTD 3 times during last 2h and server has disconnected twice...
---
They should have put Repair and Inspect on two separate keys/buttons.
---
Like on PS4 have Square be Repair and maybe L3 to view for renaming. (or at least pressing L3 does nothing other makes a clicking sound on PS4 like I activated something).
---
I hope Bethesda sees how much time people are putting into their Fallout 76 C.A.M.P.‚Äôs and adjusts resources accordingly. Meaning I hope they get to bug fixing some of these C.A.M.P. building annoyances.
---
Yes! I kept hearing scorched die when I was in the Nuka Cola plant, so I assumed there was another player sneaking around, but then later I saw some die right in front of me elsewhere. One died when I was in a firefight with his friends, but before I'd fired anywhere near him. I actually nabbed footage of one dying after I came around a corner, but I haven't had time to watch it back. It probably doesn't reveal anything exciting.
---
I expect it's a bug. I also noticed that the repair stations are bugged out, losing the condition stats after you've repaired one item, forcing you to exit the station and start again.
---
Actually, I think he hid it in the walls of his house.  Which, made it even more infuriating to come home and find the drywall having been ripped down, gold taken, and picture frame hung back up...crooked of course...just the way it was before he left for the vault.
---
I disagree I think items should drop at the enemies level like every other game
---
Hey, my wife has a camp like that and she's never been there aggressor in any fight. And one guy had this in the middle of Scorched Earth so that everyone could craft their flux in relative safety. 
---
I think people make those because the AI is too dumb to get up stairs. Whether or not they're assholes is probably undecided.
---
Agreed
---
It's so bad rn. I'm stuck thinking, are we going to get half way through The Burrows and crash. Cause then I'ma get real cut! Lol 
---
^gotta laugh or I might cry at this point :P
---
Thanks, I'm having a blast.
---
I assume a lot of the initial anger was simply because it wasn't Fallout 5, which i get. I was annoyed they'd released a game that clearly wasn't for me, so i'll admit i enjoyed the backlash at first, but once i'd watched a few gameplay vids I changed my mind. I'm so glad I was proven wrong.
---
You shouldn't use autistic as an individual on Reddit... We're all autistic here. *You're* the odd man out if you aren't.
---
&gt;buffing the Scorchbeast Queen?
---
Jealous. Im a filthy casual so i dont have that many Atoms sadly
---
&gt; To save you the trouble each addiction provides a consistent 7.33% dmg buff for a total of 36.5%.
---
The numbers you posted show 50% increase, not 36.5%...
---
Can‚Äôt you just log out? I thought it cleared bounties.
---
Sent you a message!
---
What platform?
---
u sure? i will try
---
You gotta work bitch
---
I feel compelled to point out that the UI on PC is a practically-unusable mess specifically because Bethesda based the entire interface around controllers and just forces mouse users to fend for themselves. Been like this in every game since Oblivion. Console is definitely Bethesda's main focus.
---
Also, depth of field is tricky to implement on consoles. Depth of field is a control to help hardware perform better under load (textures are loaded at a lower resolution and fuzzed a bit, leaving the GPU free to render the more clear textures). My PC is pretty beefy (for two years ago) and I still have to leave DoF at the default settings because the lag and hitching are unbearable when the game has to render everything at full resolution. I have to assume that a base-model Xbone or PS4 would struggle even more.
---
Worth a shot üòÇ if not and your pc I will help you.
---
That's chill - you're gonna have some awesome adventures. Keep an eye out on the 76 subs for weekly get-togethers. There's a farmer's market in flatwoods every week and it's worth looking at r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Not true at all. Mods still work just fine.
---
Whered you find it?
---
I guess it's all box mods. I think you can still craft them if you know the plans otherwise, we have to wait for a fix.
---
I like the idea, but alternative thought; a Power Armor skin that looks like medieval armor.
---
Not only is this happening for me as well(PS4), I'm also unable to attach mods that I find or buy onto appropiate weapons; which is especially annoying since some mods can't be crafted and can only be bough/found and attached that way.
---
Bethesda was clear from the start that this was going to be an experiment in continuous development from a minimum viable product and not a one-shot game from the get go.
---
If your a high enough level and doing it solo, it can be very quiet and easy to do. I've done it a couple of dozen times, never had a decent legendary drop.
---
What a bogus drop tho
---
What bothers me with pacafist mode as that even when you are killed you still lose caps so you are being punished for not wanting to foght other players, so in what fashion is the purpose of pacifist mode if it doesnt do anything but keep you from killing other players? I agree with you, there should be a world with no pvp period, so the people that dont want any pvp and be safe and enjoy themselves
---
I dont even use the preview option unless its for something I really want.
---
AVR Medical Center has a fair bit in the cafeteria as well.
---
it would be great if we could drive these little cars around the map and give them paint jobs lol
---
Thanks for the heads up, I'll have a look.
---
Or you could just go to west tek kill all the mutants and take their charging laser sniper rifles. With scrapper you get 11 plastic each, easy 150 plastic a time
---
It's been a long running issue. Guns empty, and second weapon unequipped or unfavorited. It's been this way for at least a month now for me. Just have to take the annoying extra step of loading up in sneak mode as soon as you spawn, and hope you don't get killed immediately
---
Chinese assault rifle could be a weapon skin for the handmade rifle.
---
FO4 has power armor display stations so they are in the "system" somewhere. Lockable displays would be great.
---
This has been around for a whike, not just the last patch. I have the same problem, but have had it for multiple updates now
---
On PS4 it's a different button...
---
Alerno, I know I've got 2 or 3 heavy weps stashed away. At least one is an LMG (or maybe 50cal) and explosive.. I think. I can check later today, will be a few hours. If you're on PC and it fits what you want, its yours.
---
DAmnnnn, that is stupidly nice! Nice discipline on only putting enough into each room, as not to overload.  I'd never be able to do that.
---
Heard one last night whilst I was in my concrete bunker camp just before I logged out. Only ever had them a few times on 450hrs playing. Hope you're right, I quite like them. Reminds me of Frost on fo4 üòä
---
Not sure if people are just sticking to Survival mode, server hopping to farm the new event, or just taking a brake from the game, but not only have I not seen a nuke zone since the newest patch, but there's only ever been at max 2 players around Whitespring(including myself) at any given point.  I also haven't had anyone show up for Uranium Feaver, which is odd.  I mean more loot/exp. for me and all, but it still feels off.
---
Oh yeah... what a ludicrously basic-ass game. It provides nothing new or original. Combat is adequate *at best*. And then loot boxes to kill any excitement from exploring dungeons. And to top it all off, you can't see shit if you're trying to play outside. 
---
I'm not one to hop on a hate train. I'm usually one to try and find the positive points in a hated game. But Blades is.. not good. 
---
People thought FO:Shelter was a disappointment... At least they one is actually a decent game.
---
Just you wait for when the clutter update comes... Hoarder home inc
---
Can definitely confirm it‚Äôs based on the number of participating players as well, I‚Äôve run the event solo multiple times and the spawn rate always rises noticeably whenever someone new joins.
---
The building was actually pretty OK in fallout 4 and in 76 its like a total regression. It doesn't work half the time, items are floating, stuff just won't place, tons of errors. It's really crappy imo.
---
Then people could just farm low level legendaries, like lvl5 super mutants. I do wish the levels were more consistent though
---
I really wish theyd allow us to have dressers and fridges that only take their assigned kind of items. Let me role play in my house damn it.
---
I'd rather this than actual some old suit of display armor turned into real armor.
---
But then we have to deal with even more Warhammer 40k Space Marine RPers...
---
Made my morning thank you
---
I really hope they overhaul this mechanic at some point.
---
Make actual animal companions you can get. Make it so they can't permanently die.
---
And then you're also getting ammo from them, and xp, and other stuff lol
---
I suspect this will be allowed once we can use stash items to decorate our camp.
---
You \*can\* buy your stuff back(at least on PS4).  Just exit and reopen the trade window.
---
I was wondering about this as well. Since there seems to be no further mention of them anywhere else, my guess is future content.
---
Interesting. I just noticed it with this last patch, but I was a heavy melee user before so it may not have affected me then.
---
word.
---
Well, the handmade rifle is based on the Chinese 84S rifle, so you have that.
---
They're really bad, almost like back in the day
---
Shit really?! Where abouts? I want.
---
I power it up so the surrounding workshops can get full power.  I like to try to get all three on any given server with my team.
---
Yeah, it is lol. X to bring the prompt up "are you sure you wanna scrap, then O to actually scrap it. I love it, it's so nice. I've almost scrapped my handmade a couple times pre-patch, but now I actually can't do that haha
---
Those stars don't really help it. 
---
If it had weight reduction that would be good. 
---
Honestly I'd probably rate it about 500 caps personally, as flamers aren't really useful as its difficult to keep them fueled. It does have utility in a support healing flames build though.
---
I don't team because all they ever do is go straight to your camp and start pissing about.
---
My guess is that collision takes a harder price when rendered.
---
Yeah for some reasons no one seems to be able to create or equip mods. And at least I have trouble getting any plans by scrapping armors or weapons, so far like 100 scrapped guns without single learned plan and 50 scrapped armor...
---
What is strange is on the same day that I got the DCG mod, I bought a bladed mod for my brass knuckles weapon and that worked no problem.
---
Lol, ty
---
Yea since the benefits from each drink we‚Äôre boarding on Legendary I tried to make each recipe prohibitively difficult in some way to prevent abuse
---
This happens to me about 2/3 times someone invites me to the cryptid event, and I have to server hop.  And I don't mean chameleon, like even when all pylons are active, he is just not there.  I have stood on the top of the building and sprayed the area with a combat shotgun and no hits register.
---
Lets not focus on rep grinds, it was just one possibility. Other and better ideas are welcome, I won't pretend to have all the answers (not the sharpest knife in the drawer). And you're right - I have no idea how any of this works other than RNG : )
---
South of the crashed space station down to the east a little, it's close to a shack that spawns a couple mutants, on the edge of some trees, the lead should be next to the trees, the junk should be close to a tiny pond, you'll have to place your camp right in the middle to clip both
---
I like fallout and nowadays every game I play is online multiplayer. Add them together BAM! good game! Lol one thing though is everygame i play takes about the first year to be polished and finished!
---
Blow that car up!
---
Same problem here
---
im on pc
---
Actually, I think we should be able to leave it on at any crafting station EXCEPT the Power Armor crafting station. How are you supposed to repair or upgrade the suit while wearing it?
---
Very nice! I love the attached garage/workshop idea. I've built myself a little hotel/shop on the golf course with all the crafting stuff upstairs, but this would make way more sense for my place.
---
If you love building, keep calm and build on! Once my level hit triple digits and I had gear coming out of my ears, my two favorite things are leaving care packages for others, and building.
---
If you keep walking the path through whitesprings you‚Äôll see a box with untouched or perfectly persevered Abraxo Cleaner n a scrubbing mop. These items are sitting next to a vehicle just like the one you have pictured. It would seem that shit must have been highly effective as a car cleaner. Whitesprings probably had a vehicle detailing service for their high profile clients and you stumbled upon the one of the last clean vehicles in the wasteland.
---
Well, animal companions and camp pets need to be treated as two different things I think, which enables both to be viable in the game. 
---
Their current mechanic is definitely flawed, but I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. The pet should be deemed ‚Äúessential‚Äù much like Bot vendors and thus cannot be killed. And the owner should be able to ‚Äúscrap‚Äù them like a workshop item if needed or the owner wants to. 
---
A companion on the other hand, opens up a lot of doors. I think it would need to stay rather simple, like a dog or a cat, and the animal would basically act like Dogmeat from FO4. They could carry things and be given a flat small carry weight of like 100 or 150. And the Atom Shop could ever get in the game by offering exclusive Doggie Armor for your pooch. 
---
Because the Camp takes animals can literally be anything from a squirrel to a huge Sloth, I don‚Äôt think they are practical or viable for companions, but more pets and protective guardians for your camp. 
---
Whatever the case, I‚Äôd just love to see Dogmeat meat a triumphant return to the franchise.
---
Just a post for exposure:
---
I ordered an American brand off Amazon. I received a Chinese knock off. Of course Amazon passes the buck to the seller. Amazon could careless. Wants the buyer to do leg work to make it right and wants to fluid the market with cheap Chinese products. Be careful what you buy off Amazon. Probably going to be some Chinese rip off.
---
Indeed. They need to implement a test server, like yesterday!
---
There's a pond so that means water is a go too? Holy shit I'm there. Thanks!
---
Killable
---
The water wont be in the camp unfortunately, it's just a reference point
---
In your last screenshot, you are clipping through the rock right at the bottom center, directly above the words "BUILDABLE OBJECTS". However I do agree with you that you should be able to build there. In fact, if they can make rocks and trees disappear from the ground, they should be able to make them disappear from the sides of hills like this, and build your structure "right into" the side of a hill.
---
Frankly I miss the functionality of FO4's mod Scrap Everything (or one with similar purpose named differently) where you can pretty much end up with a big dirt plain at your settlement and build precisely what you want where you want.
---
Would you buy it or not
---
Tried to get it today, did 20 events.. only 11 were showing towards the requirement.
---
Did another.. still only 11 showing
---
I'm like 93 atm, show me your big builds pls
---
So just not useable in vats then I take it?
---
I have everything in the post
---
Hmmmm. I don‚Äôt know them
---
I concur, but that's not what he's suggesting. He wants to be able to display his power armor at his camp's power armor stations.
---
Lol I was reading reviews on Amazon and 90% were just complaining about having to have Xbox live! Lol what games these people playing? The Flintstones? How you review a game you never played everyone thinks they are Cisco and douchebert.
---
No throwing wepon is useable in vats üò•
---
They hide in the water, with only their antenna poking out of the water, until you get close...or until you fire off a mini nuke in their direction!
---
Killing lvl 7 players... ...big boy ! üëè
---
Ah bugger... Ok water is kind of a requirement for me. I'll stick to my current junk spot next to a river. Cheers anyway.
---
That makes sense.. I did loads of them.. and was pissed off when I only had 11 showing!
---
I like that idea but there is a vehicle just like it at I believe Crevasse Dam.
---
Ah, I'm PS4.
---
When I have gotten wood armor from the sbq, I also have gotten several sentinel armors from events, including uf
---
I actually like this as it means we can wear whatever we want on our heads and not all forced to wear the same op one
---
Lol...I may need some help in the math department, just redid the math and I think we‚Äôre both wrong
---
Take the lever: 123 divided by 167 is .73, don‚Äôt know how my tired brain then moved the decimal place there but I admit even though math isn‚Äôt my strong suit that‚Äôs a big oopsy
---
You could just use some small water purifiers since they go in the dirt
---
I like this idea and have wanted to save/collect all the different stuffed animals in the game, but right now what's the point? Is there a way to display items in your camp that I'm not aware of? I can't seem to find a way to place items from your inventory, and don't see inventory items show up in the camp creation menu. Am I missing something? I've only been playing a few days so it's entirely possible than I am.
---
Lmao no, how do you expect Bethesda to keep milking this game otherwise? Get gud or buy more Atoms.
---
America could have won the war with China if we just sent a moderately sized army of Colonel Gutsies.
---
Is... This for real? How the fuck did I not know this????
---
–î—Ä—É–≥
---
In game lore makes it hard to perform the superfine movements needed for crafting while in power armor.
---
First you‚Äôre hands are operating the PA hands via what is essentially a pulley system.
---
Second there‚Äôs no tactile feedback only compression resistance.
---
Third range of movement is restricted at the waist, neck and wrists.
---
Tyvm for spotting my error
---
Yep, I only figured it out recently as well lol
---
www.google.com
---
This incredible website has all the answers you need. Use the power of google responsibly.
---
You‚Äôre welcome.
---
I'vr wondered why we can't have Power Armor displays like Fallout 4 did?
---
Fertile Soil and Collision Course are my favorites. Want to do Uranium fever (only did it once and got accidentally trapped in there at level 14) but the event marker never shows up on my map.
---
You've completely blown my mind and changed the game for me!
---
I'm sure they want to take your money and are working on the tech.
---
Anytime pal üëç
---
Keep on waiting
---
&gt;DO MAINTENANCE ON TUESDAY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.... DAMMIT!
---
Funny, Steam does it every Wednesday.
---
I can send you a screenshot if you cant find it btw
---
You on Pc? West Australian player here :)
---
If they are added later, it shows that these updates were mostly to patch in content that was meant to be ready for release. Even the scouts were marked as cut content on the wikis. Refuse to believe this game was meant to release without moonshinin' haha
---
Yeah well .. no it isnt. I need an account shared stash so I can keep my one flamer user supplied by crafting fuel on all my other characters.
---
Let me wander about for awhile and see how I go. I'll come back and ask if I'm lost.
---
Awesome....too bad I'm PS4.  I'd just love to drop by the shop cause it looks cool...
---
I feel like nuke drops have pretty much stopped so I too am having hard time with flux.  I cannot finish my daily for biv cause I can't craft the flux the booze needs. :)
---
This was something I wanted since the beginning. It would be cool to display
---
Have a sticker
---
Shoot me your name if you need help
---
Yeah, the nukes have surly reduced since this last update. Good luck out there.
---
Oh my god, I love the idea of wasteland sushi
---
1/3 year later and I‚Äôm level 50, and I‚Äôve just come for this.
---
Alright np
---
I assumed they knew I was going to murder them eventually, so they gave up.
---
You're saying it's not that...?
---
I started off with the same build it sounds like you have. But since level 100 I've changed everything to focus on strength for melee. It's hard to double dip with weapon types without a little drop in boths damage. If you want to slay easier, definitely get underarmor with + 3 strength, take whiskey, take chems, take glowing meat and also grab twisted muscle serum from the ws bunker. My basic meat hook can do 500 + damage with all of this. 
---
I also have 3 star perks in bloody mess, and the radiation card that boosts strength with rad exposure. 
---
I know it's a lot, but it's been working for me. Most enemies are 1 to 2 hit kills. Hope this helps/ makes sense lol.
---
Good, good.
---
Every player the joins the scorchbeast queen event increases her health by quite a bit. There is an expectation that you should be able to pull your weight in the fight if you join for the loot.
---
+10% melee damage? like there is not enough melee food? c'mon
---
But Tuesday is my day off. What did I do to deserve it?
---
But seriously, that sucks. They should've given sufficient warning.
---
&gt;talented players
---
&gt;fallout 76 pvp
---
Pick one.
---
i'd like to see liberator helmet
---
F for the money you wasted despite knowing what a piece of shit this game is
---
–¢–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏—â
---
Can you show your build you are using pls?
---
They already do, the buyback option isnt caps for caps what you paid though.
---
I thought I had a venderbot then it exploded right in front of me. Sadly you‚Äôre on PS4 and for some reason cross play doesn‚Äôt exist yet.
---
Does it change the model at all or just a visual glitch?
---
When I read this, my first thought was of Firefly. Bring those Reavers in game!!
---
Ha everyone thinks their character is god tier and they are talented at everything.
---
Sarcasm. Look it up.
---
Yeah i was in adventure since i have no ibterest in PvP
---
This game has come a long way since release. I love it! Here's hoping some of the naysayers and people who didn't like it come around and give it another chance.
---
Why use any stimpaks? I run in and die a few times spawn almost immediately and run back in. Seriously done it a bunch of times now. It's not worth using stims.
---
Cool, I came across a little fight club by my camp last night. It was not organized or anything...just jump in and fight. I just watched.  What's your ps4 handle? Same as above?
---
Stop whining.
---
Instead of restricting storage to specific items, I think it'd better if they just did it like Fallout 4 and let you decide what you want to put in each container, but keep the basic stash box function as is and let you manage your items from there, regardless of where you originally stored them.
---
At least you can make ribeyes when you are hungry.

I‚Äôve been wondering that myself...I predominately (in the beginning) was just using a Junkie machete with only 3 addictions just b/c it was the best melee I had at that time.  With Daddy-o, Daytripper, Mentats, med-X and Alcohol it‚Äôs possible to hit max junkie buff w/o a meg to str...this is my combination but usually with no alcohol addiction because I run vats crit ranged build and don‚Äôt like the neg on agi‚Äôs to get out of hand
---
I still wish drills had a legendary effect to panic robots I would enjoy chasing robots thru watoga
---
&gt; Raider out.
---
Sorry you need an incentive to kill others in games, but there are those of us here that enjoy killing others for the sheer joy of it.
---
When I invaded in Dark Souls, it wasn't cause I wanted humanity, but for the fun of it.
---
Horrible idea. Why don't you just farm level appropriate areas?
---
You mention Kinetic Dynamo and Dodgy. Has this been confirmed to be useful?
---
What platform are you on? If PS4 I think I might have a lvl 50 single action you can have.
---
I dont understand how ppl are getting one shot, maybe i have accidentally avoided all one shots but which attack in prticular is the one shot?
---
You will be able to display items later, it was in the roadmap.
---
I have yet to complete an sbq since patch 0/3
---
I was surprised I got through one earlier tbh!
---
Wouldn't need to be lockable really, when you place a power armour frame only you can interact with it
---
I did, but it said that it relates to something being witty or funny so I just assumed your comment didn't apply.
---
Her melee attack. The double sword punch thing assaultrons do.

If you're on Xbox I can sell you a single X-01 mod, I only have one though sorry :(
---
I had a pet megasloth once. His name was Henry. I loved him, he was the best pet anyone could ask for. But one day he disappeared with out a trace. I spent weeks looking for him only to find him in the mire completely feral and in death's door. I had to put him down for his sake and mine I'll never forget him.
---
R.I.P. Henry. 
---
We hardly knew ye.
---
I managed to drop 2 nukes on prime on the same server. Contemplated a third or hop... Was a pretty strong group on the server, downed her both times in 15min, (most times it's a fail) so I figured I'd try it out and drop a turd, but instead, the server dropped me like a turd. Oh the irony.
---
I believe it has something to do with context towards the ‚ÄúEver Upwards‚Äù questline in May 9th?
---
The Pioneer Scouts VS The Reavers kind of thing.
---
But this is my speculation on the matter, it could just be me over analysing the whole thing.
---
I can see that 6 INT for PvE is kinda necessary, tho with energy weapons getting buff and Gatling Plasma/Laser / Gauss Rifle also using energy ammo I think that you can get away in some builds with just 3 INT as a real cost of PA use.
---
For PvP you can swap those 6 to 3xFirst Aid + maybe 3xStabilized / 3xDemo Expert / Nerd Rage
---
Ultracite is indeed annoying to get, certainly more so than ballistic fiber required in some high level armour.
---
I'm not saying that PA does not need legendary pieces, it certainly does. It would give it more variety beyond just the mods and something to farm, but I believe that right now, at least for PvE they are in good spot or you wouldn't see so many people use them. I would rather not see every player with 50+lvl wearing PA, because normal armour ends up being garbage in comparison.
---
I think that maybe a system where the chassis can be stored in a power arm rack.
---
that's a very good idea!
---
It‚Äôs not a fun experience paying to fast travel , switch your perks on arrival , find where the group is , start getting her down then disconnect,..I‚Äôm playing to enjoy myself, not to be tempted to throw my controller,.. just saying
---
This capability was in fallout 4 no idea why they decided not to add it 
---
Probably because the servers can‚Äôt even handle a scorched queen battle
---
What system?
---
Because that is about 25% of the map. I would like to explore and use the whole map.
---
You can effectively tank with high enough DR and blocker, with a heavy Vampire weapon. Im using a vampires explosive LMG paired with a dense sentinel combat chest. Keeps her in place when she fixates on me so other players can attack her
---
Do what others do. Create a mule character to accept large payments and conserve storage space. It would be great if they would release a partner app so you could transfer items between characters. For now you just need a trustworthy buddy to do this
---
Never got anything with Vampire or Sentinel
---
I just run for my life while I take potshots.
---
I was excited this game would have CAMP building because I spent hundreds of hours making very elaborate, realistic towns in FO4. When I played FO76 though, I was expecting an improvement, what I got was a major setback. Now, despite how bad it was, I wish CAMP building was just FO4‚Äôs build mode.
---
I eventually just hopped on top of the shack thats right there, never died while up there, but then again no one went for the pylons.
---
I get that. But I think that instead of enemies dropping gear at our level, Bethesda should make servers where the enemies start at level 50 and move up from there.
---
that is pretty cool, I did not know you could be conduit to all 3... forgot about using the science books too.. pretty good video, ty.
---
I'd much rather get 3 star legendaries from 3 star legendary enemies...
---
So you're an a**hole. Noted.
---
+karma seller was prompt and trustworthy.  Will do business again.
---
Even if they let you equip an unarmmed weapon by sacrificing having a right bracer equipped id be fine with that. I just want to use my mole miner gauntlet in my PA
---
Yup. Seen this multiple times over the last couple of days. 
---
I think I was one of only a couple of people on the server and the others were hanging around whitesprings, I was around the mines and seeing mole miners just die as I got close.
---
I was the conduit and needed to maintain it so everyone could do damage to the imposter. If I died and respawned I‚Äôd have to go to all of them again
---
I'm not the one that made the sarcastic response. Next time check the name before you're an asshole. I hope your life gets better.
---
Would be a huge QoL.
---
I would say either the power fist or the deathclaw gauntlet
---
Sadly, you are true. I'm waiting for Bethesda to buff SAR and all other pistols in general. 3 god-rolled pistols are sitting in my stash box and collecting dust. Let's hope for it.
---
Workshop them
---
I've been getting a ton of crashes on PC. I stopped playing for a bit because I thought the game was a mess. Fun but, felt broken. Decided to try it again to see if they fixed anything. See you in another 3 months, fallout ;(. It's really tiring because I enjoy playing this game and Battlefield 5 but, feel like we were given rushed games.
---
PS4 Pro
---
Same for me in PC
---
How are we able to get the rest of the mounted animal heads if we've finished lying lowe
---
I'm on PS4 so I guess crashing is across the board :(
---
Well said.
---
Me too Jimmy, me too.
---
Yes the number is bigger, but so Is the delay :/ spent the first five minutes alone wondering what was happening
---
That happened to me last night. Fast travel to watoga to join in went to stash to get PA and bam crash!
---
I had to repair and exit out of menu
---
Yes, i had a load of robots in watoga spawn in the pods then die when they open
---
Ok, I'm over it lol. Just launched the game and it made this incredibly loud, glitched sound that made my ears ring. I get into a server and I have no footsteps, no ambient sounds, but have sound when I punch something.
---
problem is trusting others.. lets say you want to sell me a AAE Gatling gun for hmm 40k.. I already have 20k on my character, so i hand you my 20k and have to switch to an alt... you block me, take the 20k and never be seen again.  on the flip side of that.. you have a AAE I want badly but i have nothing of value to trade. you and your alts are already at or close to max caps. you cannot sell it to me for what it is worth so there is no sale. It is very frustrating to have caps and want something but find I cannot buy it because the seller is already maxxed on caps and only can take a trade that i do not have.
---
Thanks for this +karma
---
Sooo are rugs still a means of building in 76? That'd be a game changer.
---
posidon! üßú‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Lol! Do you have 15 luck. Maybe you should of :P seriously though, sucks so much!
---
I made a 4 star hunting rifle that did 0 damage to any enemy. Had to revert to 3 star
---
Eventually you start having too many, you get them as rewards and drops, find them on mobs... I think I have been sitting around 30 for 10's of lvls
---
I swear they're worse then the level 60 sentry bots
---
Since we are on the subject. I would love functioning magazine racks/shelves that act as static display to other people in my camp. Same for bobble heads. If the display objects get destroyed then whatever was on display is tranfered into my stash. Part of the fun of fallout is collecting neat trinkets, and showing them off.
---
I usualy capture the power plant in the South West which lets you produce them. Its been producing 1 power core every 10 minutes. Currently have 30 in my inventory so I am good for a bit. I usually do it whenever i hit 10 or so left.
---
Lol, I feel like I got -10 luck most the time. üòÇ
---
If you have about 50 bucks laying around, I'd suggest getting a solid state drive, and a usb 3.0 harddrive enclosure. 
---
I have xbox, and have had a lot less issues once I upgraded. Pretty sure the game straight up crashes when it cant keep up with loading, and everything loads about 50% faster now. 
---
The game is less than 60gb, so a small one is fine for 1-2 games. And the 3.0 USB have speeds way faster than what a spinning disc drive could ever do.
---
The legendaries are level 40 so the items they drop will never be above level 40.
---
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. It sucks to deal with. The core of the game is fun. Just frustrating to play when that keeps happening.
---
well i have tried using that little app, but unfortunately, all i get are videos and guides that say you have to buy the fecking things from the fecking armory at the fecking enclave. So unless you actually know something different from what google apparently knows, you're comment is as useless to me as a condom is to the Pope. :p
---
Watoga. There are five PAs to check.
---
Legendary item level is dependent on the enemy. It's always the highest possible of a certain item without exceeding the level of the mod that dropped it. Mole miners cap at lvl 40 (glowing) and can thus only drop lvl 35 or 40 items. 
---
Another example, if a legendary lvl 48 super mutant overlord would drop a lever action rifle, shishkebab or marine armor - all of which cap out at lvl 45 - the item would drop as lvl 45. If it'd drop a combat rifle, super sledge or combat armor, it would be a lvl 40 item instead.
---
Yup, just noticed it.
---
Broken in last patch hold on to mod until Tuesday hopefully they‚Äôll fix it then
---
I made a nice treehouse near the whitesprings service entrance, meanwhile my buddy was struggling to place a door in his camp.
---
What‚Äôs the gun and the mods?
---
I disagree that 3* should always drop 3* because the solution to keep legendaries rare would be to have 3* enemies spawn less frequently. Bethesda would reduce the spawn rate by 66% without 1* and 2* drops.
---
Which is dumb because I had like ten frames and I tried giving them to people, but had to junk them for no scrap.
---
To be honest, I just complain about it because I hate RNG. I would rather grind hours to unlock a super sweet gun instead of rolling the dice for a good roll.
---
Me, too.
---
But he dies in like 5 hits. He's such an easy fight and his attacks never land if you strafe.
---
Great idea! The game needs more fun, harmless ways to mess with people.
---
Continuing the joke or did you both end up with a similar thought?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bcgj8p/enough_with_the_false_advertising_bethesda/
---
thanks - but PC, thanks for the thought tho, just gotta keep grinding away.
---
Do you think it would be bad to have 3 stars spawn less?
---
That is understandable, but that is why they have survival rewards now I believe.
---
Oh no doubt. I love the game, just want a divorce from the crashes haha. Currently I'm building a new camp. So that's working for now. Fingers crossed!
---
Would be nice if there was a **timer** for events with a cool down on your world. Not looking at any 3 hour cool down event in particular...
---
That also tho he is an alien with lasers telaports And Simmons other monsters he should be harder
---
Thanks :D
---
Dodgy consumes AP like crazy. Kinetic servos on the other hand, just triggers a small refresh. It‚Äôs not very significant, yet noticeable. Together, I‚Äôd prefer core assembly and dodgy.
---
Had 12 people during one run. 4 legendaries spawned instead of the usual 3.
---
I'm with you, but it's something I've just added to the start and end of every session, a few server hops just for looks.  It's just part of my routine, and I know I'll find them.  If you ever run into a weird lady with blue hair and a bathing suit talking to herself in the bunker, say hi.
---
I want my armor displayed like the Fallout 4 menu. Shoulders hung on chains, the menacing expression of the helmet position, that would be great.
---
Fair call and that's something I am going to do for space reasons anyway, but I really shouldn't have to go the extra mile just to play the game. I have games that tax the system way harder. It's just the nature of this engine unfortunately. And it did work without crashes prior to the last few patches -__- haha
---
So it looks like you can  damage it when the shields are up, it‚Äôs just a very small amount of damage, am I correct there? 
---
One time when I fought it I guess we killed it when the shield  was up and the body was invisible on the ground, everyone ran around pointing all over to find it, and since it ragdolls different on every client it was slightly different for each of us.  Something to look out for during your fights!
---
Give it to them through trade menu.
---
Too true üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
On the bright side if you have knowledge to make a mod you could ‚Äúbuild‚Äù mods.
---
The attaching part seem to be broken ( yellow box mod)
---
Absolutely.
---
It's obvious that the spawn rate was reduced in the most recent update especially with the Watoga nerf. As a high level players with nothing else to do but hunt 3* legendaries the game has been extremely stale the last 3 evenings.
---
 A 66% reduction in spawn rate and you may go days without finding one. I personally enjoy finding them and getting a spin at the wheel over never finding them at all.
---
When I'm not located near Overseer's CAMP (free food for new players!), I like to set up shop on a mountain/hill slightly to the Northwest of the Morgantown Airport. There's an ore deposit and a beehive right next to me and just down the hill are a bunch of crops and the medical tents outside the terminal.
---
I pick up cups at the fair ground.  Quick and easy.
---
yeah i know
---
Ok, that makes a lot of sense now. You have a really good point
---
Yep, it's a mixed bag, honestly - no video game system should ship with spinning discs anymore. I garentee every system they test this game on is with ssd's. Its systems showing a lower price point with lower quality.
---
Also from WA and on PC
---
Someone keeps putting a toilet on my roof.  Like Wtf.
---
Nicely done  [Nurse Ratched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_Ratched) :)
---
You might had dupped them unintentionally, ask the receiver if he got something.
---
And if you‚Äôre trying to paint a bone excavator for somebody you didn‚Äôt drop it you destroyed them.
---
You can‚Äôt transfer or drop atom shop items, I will destroy them
---
Yes. Message me if you wanna fight
---
Yeah, you aren't penalized for not wearing a helmet
---
I agree. We also need a diff corner roof piece for inward corners, instead of only having an outward corner.
---
Can confirm the marine combat helmet is in fallout 76, saw a level 5 wearing one in white springs the other day
---
I think they're idea with the cap increase and no way to transfer between characters outside of having a friend to help was to limit the economy and discourage these high prices for items. 
---
But I totally agree with you, seeing as how people found ways around their limits (as gamers are known to do), there is no reason for them to be in place now.
---
It's extremely difficult to establish a foothold as a trader in the economy right now. You've got to be extremely lucky and find one of these pieces through gameplay, or you need to get lucky and find someone who doesn't know the value of an item and buy it for cheap.
---
Wait you mean the 400 lbs is a bug?
---
Wow never thought of that I thought it was power armor plus the 100 carry weight
---
Welp downvote this post to oblivion
---
I believe you're right. I'm hoping they continue this with raids or at least somewhere that's not PvP. It can get exhausting always looking over your shoulder.
---
The only thing that‚Äôs not safe about it is how addicting it is, you will not be able to play the game without it once you have it.  There was a brief time it didn‚Äôt work and a lot of people started questioning the game at all
---
There is a bright green car just by the junk pile to the south of Whitesprings. Look totally Out-of place
---
I was messing with this last night. I found, at least on my end, that if you repair an item and wait about 2 seconds for stuff to load before you back out to your other weapons, it should work fine. An indicator that something went wrong, though, is if after your repair, the stat window of the current weapon you just repaired goes blank. Then it's going to happen. But if you wait before backing out, potentially it'll work. Tried this like twice last night. Potential inconvenient solution.
---
At one point during beta, they did exist, then got patched out. The welcome mats in the game now are just for looks.
---
That makes sense, I just hope they save the REALLY good legendaries as RNG but that is just my opinion.
---
Welcome mats exist but they dont dictate where you spawn.
---
PC, sorry should have been the first thing I said lol
---
I just wish it was a little less awkward to communicate without a mic. I tend to be a little mic shy
---
No joke, I got a stim pack chest with +1 charisma from the first run the second run gave me a t51 jet pack plan and a TS vats revolver because vats works sooooooo well with TS. Lol!
---
In my humble experience, a good game + bad reputation = an amazing online community. 
---
Hopefully the assholes continue believing this game is no good
---
He buffs other creatures. I think he would be interesting as a high health boss in a raid, as he could empower creatures to distract you from him
---
Any high school is a good source in my opinion. That prison as well.
---
I'm with you and everyone else. It's annoying as hell to get bad loot.....I got 2 drills last night. But finding 3* legendaries is fun, it's exciting when you see one off in the distance and rush to it.
---
I came across a 3* ghoul last night fighting 3 super mutants. I was going to keep moving until the ghoul popped up and the mutants were about to kill him before I could tag him. As a bloodied build I had no choice but to rush into combat completely unprepared. Of course I didn't get anything good but the excitement of finding the 3* was more important than the loot drop.
---
You need to drop them instead of placing them out normally
---
The fusion cores I find in the wild have barely any charge anymore. Your best bet is to capture the power plants.
---
Trading as it is sucks so bad. Having to trust someone to 1 for 1 trade anything is nerve wrecking. It's like Craiglist but worse because if you get robbed you can't steal your stuff back. 
---
Dunno how they didn't think to create a typical trade window to swap items in agreement.
---
The reason a lot of people wear PA at the moment; particularly is the Excavator bug.
---
Excavator gives a base +100 weight, then you get +50 per calibrated leg for +200, and there's the log in glitch that can give you up to +300 weight.
---
Another reason is the fact that when comparing non-legendary pieces, you get better millage out of PA per repair resources even if you have to deal with the 3-6 int investment. 
---
But really I only see people running around in Excavator 90% of the time, the other 10% is folks using X-01 during Nuke Zones for the better resists.
---
I can't craft either. I try to change my headlamp on my t51 armor and it makes the sound but doesn't mod the helmet. I put on the vault boy lamp before the update.  Thought it would just be a green color, instead it has this big view-obstructing pip boy outline everywhere I look. FML
---
It‚Äôs a very fast notification, it fades quick, as well I feel like I haven‚Äôt gotten it a few times as well, but after really noticing how quickly it faded out last night, I may have just missed it every time.  
---
Also it goes SO fast after the notification now, when I saw it last night I dropped everything, jumped in some armor, flipped some perks, went back to the map to travel, and it was over.
---
Sounds good how many caps would you want for it
---
Like how it is with Sea of Thieves
---
Understood. It's frustrating when others wont help with the pylons.
---
Miniscule. Seriously doesn‚Äôt matter, and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not worth bullets if the shield is up
---
Only recently have I been having any problems from beta til about two patches ago I rarely crashed or booted
---
Why can't they repair the Damn fence by the snake icon on the map. My camp is there and I hate being attacked daily.
---
It's because the server software  fo76 Is running on is garbage and if more than a handful of people on a server have complex camps the server gets overstressed starts crashing and bugging ou.
---
Lol
---
Without the context of the deleted message, I'm curious as to what you mean.
---
As PA is currently useless in PvP, and I assume that's what you meant by unbalanced.
---
I had a pet mega sloth for a little over a month. Then when got the update that forced players to move their camp if it was too close to future DLC areas. I sadly had been parked right next to V96 for a while. After logging in and placing my camp down again my wonderful mega sloth had been converted to a radstag doe. Not 5 minutes later some random came over and killed the pet radstag doe too
---
That armor has next to no skins for it.
---
I laugh everytime I see it i wonder if they did it on purpose because one thing Beth does right is placement of objects in the world
---
Wouldn‚Äôt I lose my camp if I campfire the power plant though? Or no? I‚Äôm not sure how this works
---
If this was ps4, I'd give you a bloodied MG42 for the owl mask alone. I want that mask, and I never use the mg lol
---
It's taken me since the game came out just to find 1 calibrated shock üòÇ
---
The turret change makes those gatling laser turrets in the Silos a lot more formidable. kinda annoying to run them now tbh
---
Nah, its for sale in the whitespring bunker.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen it in the whitesprings vendor list but I do know that it spawns in the enclave medical vendor
---
That‚Äôs happened to me a few times on ps4.
---
It could be but I think when people were duping they were carrying tens of thousands of items. I would guess all the stash inventories on all the players on a server right now is a small fraction of what it used to be during the duping heyday.
---
Alot of people think its scorch beast queen like were they can just show up and shoot things luclky 1 player can conduit all 3 pylons but they will burn thru stims like crazy it really puts an emphasis on haveing a group of people to play with its not a solo show up and do scenario.
---
I have yet to see the Flatwoods Monster after 418 hours.
---
In my opinion the best way to handle it would be either:
---
* 1. Legendary effects on PA are half strength compared to non-PA versions.
---
or 
---
* 2. Legendary effects for PA are assigned pools based on the armor model. IE: Weight reduction effects are limited to Excavator, so on and so forth.
---
These are the only ways I really see Legendary PA being a thing without pissing off a portion of the playerbase that's 100% opposed to power armor.
---
I read about the enclave, but haven't been there yet.  I'm getting tired of server hopping to find stimpacks
---
Actually managed to not fail the event this morning, my 4th try, but after 3 failures I decided to fit the medic pump to my P.A, activate 2 pylons while someone else did one, jump on the shed roof to avoid Sheepsquatch melee and hit it with a troubleshooter powerful auto handmade. The medic pump stimpacks you every time you have low health so you need to have a bucket load as it fires a lot, it doesn‚Äôt make you immortal but it def helps you stay alive a bit more and be a conduit for longer
---
And its cheaper than all the other crap skins for multi armor
---
Mire dailies are bugged, I've not had any of the start in months.
---
There should be a plan for every real medical item available. I don't think they sell the various healing salves or anything. But stimpack plans should be there. Someone must have bought it before you.
---
Only downside I see to this is if they add anymore PA set bonuses similar to the having all five excavator carry weight bonus.
---
If that were the case, he'd have to drop a lot of them upon death for it to be useful, as I have 345 hours play time, and seen him twice lol
---
The new sheepsquatch insult bot dropped nothing but a drill and a few woods for me, at least mirelurks have meat for us to consume.
---
If you're getting griefed on adventure mode that's your own fault
---
Platform?
---
Seem since last patch that the song finishes 10 seconds abruptly and goes to the other one with no cross fade or anything
---
Really? I see them and kill them quite often near my C.A.M.P. in Savage Divide. Also seen in an open space in Cranberry Bog and in Berkeley Springs. Maybe I'm lucky.
---
That‚Äôs a shame I really want that tattered field jacket
---
I have an explosive quad double barrel
---
Perhaps I should edit my OP to add this unfortunate epilogue:
---
My Sloth was a Level 20. 
---
After spawning into my camp, there was a brief delay while the camp rendered. 
---
After the rendering was complete, my Sloth was flipping upside down at the hands of a Level 73 player who‚Äôs name I did not catch (not do I care, asshole) as soon as I was caught up in rendering, he had already left the server. 
---
Ok, well, lesson somewhat learned. 
---
I‚Äôm currently level 235. So I need to get the highest possible level animal to tame. That is, I‚Äôm guessing, a Level 91 Glowing Deathclaw. 
---
Ok. Maybe after another 50 server hops, I‚Äôll find him. 
---
RIP my nameless hideously ugly but adorable Sloth. I truly hardly knew ye. :(
---
Agreed, not sure why they didn't add a group finder. I'm pretty sure there is a lfg emote, but there should be a group finder option. Especially with them adding in group dungeons and raids.
---
My opinion is, its worth it. Im level 101 currently and I'm enjoying myself.
---
Indeed, alien blaster rounds are just so rare and can't be used practically.
---
This game should have been called Trainwreck 76... I just can‚Äôt anymore.  I swear you‚Äôd think they put their entry level/worst devs in charge of its development and on top of it didn‚Äôt tell them what QA and what change control is for doing software builds and revisions.
---
Everything needs to drop better loot
---
Nice, I ran it last night and it didn't even drop a legendary. Also got no plans and the white wolf fedora for the 5th time.
---
I've noticed this on the PC since the last patch, yes.
---
Also, my radio in my CAMP never seems to work now.  I know it normally doesn't begin playing until the next song does, but when I go back to my CAMP after being away, it's still silent.
---
I think its the rarity of 3* monsters and the randomness that annoys people. I'm at level 165 and have probably found 10 top tier items in all that time. I do farm a lot though. 
---
The worst is max level 3* enemies dropping under level and 1 and 2 star stuff. There is so much rng at play it's amazing anyone finds good stuff.
---
I think Bethesda needs to look at legendary modifiers and do some buffing. Right now there are too many chances to get worthless stuff. There was a good thread a few days ago on this topic.
---
Capturing the workshop lets you control your camp and the base.
---
Yes and no. 
---
I‚Äôm in the camp of ‚ÄúI understand this game is fundamentally flawed, but I still enjoy it on some level‚Äù 
---
It‚Äôs the best fallout game I‚Äôve played since new Vegas. 
---
But if you‚Äôre looking for an even better post apocalyptic experience, go for metro exodus! 
---
Hope this helps.
---
Buy the game.. it is full of bugs yes, it is full of glitches yes, but what you will get is started on a character. levels up, you will get the random freeby from the ATOM store, you will earn ATOMS for those 2 day only items that never come back, and just like watching cable tv you can turn it off and come back to it when you are bored with anything else in life. Nothing says you have to play every day, but you can enjoy the things at your leisure. graphics are pretty nice, ( Most people ) are pretty nice. overall, yes I'd say buy it.
---
Haha. I got a t60 jetpack plan. Which i dunno how I feel about!
---
If it‚Äôs a bag with items on the ground that a player dropped it‚Äôs fair game.
---
Still having this problem on PS4pro
---
&gt; This old gas RC heli I have is "barely" capable of "3D flight" (or so I read on some archived forum posts), some people say no, but then some who are better pilots show that it can be done. So I'm guessing that the power to weight ratio w/this model is just high enough to fly comfortably, not high enough to make it zip like a mosquito on crack.
---
Likely a side effect of engine technology of the day. A modern engine in that thing would likely have it zip around like a crack-addict skeeter as well. Either that or strip the spur gear and cause it to autorotate any time you tried...
---
&gt; I had one of those plastic tethered planes powered by the Cox .049 engines when I was a kid - yeah, it was fun. But it was so sad to just be flying in a circle, on a string, and not be able to afford an RC plane.
---
Yeah control line does NOT appeal to me in any way. But the engines do. They're so bloody adorable I have to tell myself not to buy another one just to bolt to my desk as a display piece! And I love running them too. 
---
The pistons are so effing tiny...half tempted to get an old junk reedie off eBay just to keychain the piston, but hell, these things are so durable you can usually get those to run again as well. Hahahahaha
---
&gt; Eventually I got a 4 or 5 channel setup moderately large glued balsa shrink wrap covered plane with a .40 gas engine - I tried to fly it once, got damn lucky when it crashed that nothing broke, and decided "this is not the plane to learn how to fly on"
---
That's why I'm on Flite Test speedbuild kits right now. Foamboard just sorta bounces. Worst case scenario if I stuff one of these is I need a new prop and about 20 minutes with the hot glue gun, yanno?
---
&gt; so i took it to a hobby shop and traded the setup in for a 2-channel pistol grip car radio + speed control because my then college roomate had just given me his old Team Losi JRX2 carbon fiber 1/10th scale car, without radio. He said he wasn't gonna use it again and when he saw my eyes light up when he showed me, he was happy for me to have it.
---
Mmmm. Cars. Makin' me wanna fire up my SC10GT and my Mad Crusher GP now. 
---
Just somethin' special about nitro that gives me a huge shit-eating grin no matter what. Even if the thing's just sitting there idling I'm grinning ear to ear. And the way they move out, the billowing smoke, banshee-like wail....mmn. Brushless may be objectively more powerful but I have more fun with nitro so I stick with my screamers.
---
If you wanna check 'em out, I've got plenty of videos of my RCs on YT. Too many to link in one post, [so here's a link to my channel proper](https://www.youtube.com/user/TestECull/videos)
---
&gt; So, our budget, that had already been tight, suddenly went down $500 per month. I could have afforded parts for a couple DIY planes I guess - if I hadn't built up a new bicycle when Trek finally gave me a warranty replacement on my old 1987 Trek 400 that was weirdly damaged back in 1991, just last year. 
---
I think we've got a couple of those in the shed somewhere. Iono. Bicycles aren't really my thing, though, if I ever do anything with them itt'l be slapping an engine onto one.
---
I'm....very much a MASSIVE gearhead. Anything internal combustion gets my whiskers twitching, as it were.
---
&gt;  My fault for "letting" him play Fortnite I think - he's hooked on that game.
---
*[Shudders in Fallout]*
---
'splain it to them Mandy! No, you should just sum up.
---
I'd add:
---
* Depleted Core Armament: When a fusion core is emptied your power armor automatically converts these into grenades. Similar to the [Nuclear Physicist](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nuclear_Physicist) perk in Fallout 4. Make them essentially identical to the Pumpkin Grenades in damage profile.
---
Gotcha!! Thanks :)
---
my bad. pc :)
---
that's some impressive tanking right there. i usually grab 1-2 pylons and hide on a roof like a little bitch xD full build pls?
---
Yeah happens to me too on the Xbox, though it usually only does it for 3 or so songs then goes back to normal.
---
for sale on pc?
---
Same, only thing I would add is also save one 3 star legendary of a weapon type you want so you can have it to reroll later.
---
OP I'm with you here. I'm probably the only one on your side here, but the pvp isn't fun for me anymore without the incentive of getting rich. It was the huge risk/reward of caps that I like with pvp on survival. I haven't been on survival now since the nerf because of it. I'm gonna force myself to get on it for the Sole Survivor today, but other than that, I'm not feeling it anymore. 100% agree with you
---
they probably slaved over a weapon bench for MONTHS on that rocket they shot you with, and that's how you think them for their time and effort? pffft ( ;) )
---
Enjoy the fun frustration of needing to scavenge for stimpacks. Once you get the recipe, it‚Äôs so easy to craft and the super duper perk is OP. You‚Äôll never run out of stimpacks ever.
---
There is no way that you wouldn't stash your Shit before a big event. Plus it's junk. You'll find more. You aren't dropping weapons.
---
For me, when I did it I got caught up on those damn green barrels, had no idea they were a clue, I was searching around for a good 10 minutes finally checked the terminal again, and those "worn barrel labels" turned out to be much more than a filler message.
---
What?! Insane
---
Really shouldn't happen at all and it happens on both consoles and the pc. So it shows the outdated engine and their lack of proper quality testing. Itll get better in future, I'm just annoyed now haha. As for discs, as a collector I need my physicals. Plus hard to sell a digital game - dont give sony any more ideas üòÇüòÇ
---
No, unfortunately.  They exist for Workshops, but not for CAMPs.
---
As a workaround, the player will always spawn a few yards north of wherever the CAMP object was originally placed.  If that point is unavailable for whatever reason, or if you are a teammate of the person who owns the CAMP, you will spawn where the CAMP was *originally* placed, even if that point is covered in foundations.
---
There are currently no plans for mods. All X-01 mods have to be purchased from the bunker.
---
Easiest way I‚Äôve found to do it (on Xbox at least) is to have a device with the Xbox app on it next to me and use Xbox chat vs in game chat.  On my iPad I can type fast enough to get most things across pretty easily
---
I really want to see this happen. My bar camp could use a power armor parking lot
---
Not to mention the gun itself that uses them does fuck-all for damage lol
---
I somewhat agree. I don‚Äôt think you should take junk if someone died, but if they dropped stuff ammo, legendary weapons on their own, or other items, it‚Äôs fair game.
---
What effects?
---
My counter argument to this; is the fact there's a way to get a guaranteed three star enemy to spawn via the SBQ or Imposter Sheepsquach. 
---
Making 3* enemies in the wild a rare sight honestly makes sense. And it makes encountering them and subsequently looting them a bit more worthwhile and memorable, even if you get a crappy roll on the three star item.
---
I have a marine armour mod and power armour mod I can't repair. I was just coming here to see if anyone else had the same problem.
---
Went in last night with an exploding gatling plasma and melted his combat inhibitor.
---
Anyone know a way/perk/mod to negate some pylon damage?
---
Put it this way, I don't think it helps.  I've found that I disconnect a fair bit more after Patch 7, but that's not necessarily true of friends because I can rejoin them.  One thing I want to try is off-loading every weightless item I can do my Stash, including Notes and Holotapes, just to reduce how much my player is lugging around.
---
No. Just junk.
---
I've had the witch spawn twice now and both times she's had no plans on her. I made my friend come to me and she had the witch hat plan on her so I got him to give it to me.
---
Since when? I posted here with that issue and everybody unanimously said to uninstall any mods. I had the most recent version of the perk loadout mod at the time, and it was the only mod I had
---
I have one away so I'm not sure which I still have. Either a  1* furious, or a 1* quadruple ammo. Im like 80% sure I still have the quad ammo
---
*Takishi shows up*
---
And here I thought this was going to be a commentary on that annoying News window.
---
I'm done with this game till they start dropping explosive energy wepons.
---
Just junk. People die really quickly in this particular event.
---
I‚Äôve got three mule characters at max caps at this point...
---
Jesus takes forever haha
---
I believe this game needs more of a precise adjustment in weapon balance. Pistols are very weak in general.
---
It's a good game right now. Not great but Bethesda has upped its game a lot recently.  It's worth the 40 bucks.
---
Server hop and kill assault bots at WS
---
The design of the game force people to stay around and farm gouls in whitespring area. It‚Äôs truly like a gamers resort, with easy access to everything including frail legendary ghouls. Scorchbeast and mirelurks drop poor loots because Bethesda simply don‚Äôt want us to go out and fight them, it‚Äôs that simple. 
---
They nerfed legendary robots in watoga too so people will not go there but stay in and around WS instead. If you want Legendaries, whitespring farming is the easiest and quickest approach. 
---
I got a max level three star anti armor gatling laser at WS yesterday, but two wood armors, a baseball bat and a tire iron from fighting sheepsquatch and scorchbeast queen. The message is pretty straightforward right?
---
Appreciate the offer but i dont need that one thanks!
---
They need to fix this fast. Your situation is horrible. Stuck with that headlamp, rather go in blind.
---
See, I ran this battle once with Born Survivor (which is essentially the perk card version of that).  Never again.  I burned through my entire stack of Stimpacks.  It's easier to accept that if the Imposter trains her laser on you, you're just going to die.  So, the more efficient strategy is to stash your junk beforehand and accept it.
---
It's because Bethesda doesn't know what QA is. This bug (among several others) was introduced in the last patch.
---
It was still misspelled as of two or three days ago
---
Server Not Responding Please wait.
---
Trade window, here is a thought for the devs.. in the pip bot add a trade window tab, so you can prelist and price anything you are carrying . so when you initiate a trade you and the other party immediately sees this tab instead of rooting through peoples personal stuff. and on items trades like ammo. make it a total sale, like i have 12635 rounds of ammo and i want 2k for it total, have an option for that instead of a mandatory 1cap per round, and lastly I would love to see a agreement option.. like i want to buy 1235648 rounds of you ammo, a weapon, and a piece of armor. so it shows all the items i want, a total, and you want one of my guns.. we both show the totals in a list and both have to ( click ) I agree to complete the entire sale.. it would fix trades as being secure.
---
I saved up 3000 atoms from when the game came out till like a week ago
---
Yeah I believe so
---
Same here buddy. We all know the blues
---
There‚Äôs a bug if/when you tame an animal is can delevel to a lower level version of itself. Happened to my sloth but not my deathclaw.
---
I have 3 spares if u r on PS4 u can have one
---
I agree, but my biggest gripe comes from people who don't assist in the event and take peoples junk.
---
Seems like stuff eventually comes back (except the blackbird pa paint). Last week they had tons of old stuff on sale. Hopefully it makes a return. I want the mezzanine tile floor.
---
I‚Äôm a strong believer that not buying them will be the strongest message even if purchased once out curiosity or anything , they win
---
Make sure you don't accidentally take your flux. Everyone thinks it's fair game to just take it. I personally would know üòÇ
---
Yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff that I missed. Either because of timing or no atoms. Cheers for the reply.
---
Like after event scavengers?  Yeah, that's a bitch.  But how do you know?
---
It's fair balance.
---
I was thinking this last night.
---
I went from finding a dozen 3* legendaries in a 3 hour session pre update to only finding half a dozen after the update. Ironically most of the ones I've found post update have been during the Encrypted event.
---
This format reminds me of Destiny but the problem I see with that is that Destiny doesn't have Stalkers rolling pins and all of the other crappy loot in their loot pools so a lower rate of legendary finds is more acceptable.
---
Since launch as a solo player I have logged in daily to run dozens of spots on the map looking for 3* legendaries. What a waste of such a large beautiful map it would be to reduce drops to only 3 or 4 events that rarely launch.
---
So whats special about a bubbles?
---
Only the Wolf, Radstag, Owlet and Yao Guai are available plans drops I believe thus far. You can also get plans for The Fixer and the Picnic Blanket Rug. I want my SBQ mounted head, I deserve it for how many rounds of ammunition I loaded in here face over the last few months.
---
My team, all 200+ level guys...enemies are level 40 dropping level 35 guns and mono perk armor...cool
---
If it was also explosive I would accept, and add 4k to it.
---
She sells all types if Nuka Cola, i just wanted a Nuka Cola Quantum
---
But the thing is though, people are going to buy them no matter what. That‚Äôs what Bethesda wants and knows. your going to have people who are thirsty for kills in the game and they always need their weapons repaired and required. Petitions are going to work better because we can get a bigger audience and a even bigger message to Bethesda. Trying not to buy it will never work.
---
That would make guaranteed 3* spawns more valuable. Imagine if the sheepsquatch event was actually worth paying 2k caps for
---
honestly, i hate how weak the story is,  how non alive the world feels with the lack of interesting NPCs to talk to (nothing but robots),  and how often you come to new areas...only to find htem cleared out by other players.
---
yet, despite this, the game keeps me coming back, and players have been the cause of any memories i've had of this game (ever been chased out vault 76 by a guy in a flaming head with a ripper?  yeah.  welcome to my first day.      or had someone sleeping in my camp's bed, then pulled out a ripper when i was on the workbench,  when i dropped my non use ammo,  he left me a handmade gun and left. good times)
---
still...it really could use more of the classic fallout questing/storytelling, and human NPCs to add life to the world. 
---
it kinda feels like all the humans just dropped dead the moment the vault opened...
---
I have the same problem, I hope I can get into the room again. It didn‚Äôt work for some reason.
---
Yeah, you can only repair 1 item each time. You‚Äôll have exit workbench each time to repair
---
That will be the best part, you won't know until you try!
---
This is awesome, but after all that work, stimpaks etc, you get a wood leg. üôÑ Same thing happened to me last night and is extremely frustrating.
---
It's a fun game, I've played it almost every day since launch. Yes there are bugs and crashes(nowhere near as common as launch), which can be frustrating at first, but if this is the type of game that you enjoy, then as u play and make friends, crashes start to annoy you less. And I think it's more fun to play with other people. Really the only time I play solo is when I wanna be productive. I'd say it launched at 3/10 and is now at 6.5/10. I think it's worth getting with all the new stuff being added
---
Yeah, same thing happened to me.  I got there, started firing, crash.
---
I tried to rejoin through a friend, but got the "Server is full!  You are in the queue" thing.  Followed several minutes later by "The world is no longer available."  Okay, so what the heck is the friend playing on?  The world had to go on without me - that server was still "full" 10 minutes later.
---
An ordinary person learns from his mistakes. In the case of Bethesda, there are no ordinary people on the development side.
---
yeh same..the enemies take a couple of minutes to render..u cant see them but they sure see you..iv died many times due to invisible enemies at this event
---
Seriously. I 100% keep subtitles on because of this
---
So basically a Destiny clone where you log in for raids and nightly events? They would need to drastically reduce the loot pool for this. 200+ weapons 90% of which suck and that's not even including armor.
---
I think they should just stick to being Fallout.
---
I think the main problem is that mole miners only spawn up to level 40. I would love to see all enemies in the game be at least level 50 at their max.
---
With that being said some of my best stuff has come from UF. It's probably my favorite event.
---
And the ghouls keep the greens well fertilized. :P
---
Give this man an upvote!
---
I'm Lionneserra on PC. My place is open, drop on by!
---
Damn. That's a hell of a price to me, but if I was on xbox, and had that requirement, I'd do it. Wish I was on xbox now
---
SO go and start one then and see if it works
---
Yeah they idiot who went into the event last night with 4 bulk springs, 4 bulk adhesive, 6 bulk steel, 2 bulk lead, and another 100lbs of other bulk and scrapped items deserve to have their bag picked up. You have plenty of time to place your stuff in a stash box before the event and if you want to risk it then that‚Äôs the name of the game but a lot of people don‚Äôt know how to fight the impostor and get whipped up by her. I found that bag and continued to smash down her health until we won.
---
I'll be on in a bit, celebrating my dad's bday right now. I Rawgu on pc :)
---
Check your speakers are set to stereo.
---
It's a tough spot right now. Wait until the legendary vendor comes out and we'll see a change in the market
---
I see. Would be nice if the CAMP machine itself and wherever it sits currently was the spawn point.
---
What ticks me off is that we continue to go through these phases of instability.  There was a time after Patch 6 when everything was pretty great.  Crashes and disconnects were rare.  And then Patch 7 happened and introduced a plethora of new problems and general instability.  Okay, tick-tock development and all that, Patch 8 should help.  No, it didn't.  It only made it *worse*.
---
Every time in a nuke zone at Whitesprings it stutters and then crashes on PS4 after about 10-29 mins. As they push the limits of CPU and memory usage perhaps they need to do an optimisation patch now to bring back stability. I can reproduce the error so I‚Äôm sure the developers can as well. They should trap the scenario of the crashes debug and fix. Hopefully every time I report my error on PS4 they are collating this info from all users to see the common errors and come up with a fix.
---
Also any one else not have it effected by the perk cards? Does the one you build from the plans get a boost from the cards? If not why?
---
True but i feel like they wont. Seems like its gonna be exclusive to Excavator and odds are if im going unarmed im looking to do damage over carry weight so id most likely be using t51 or something diff personally
---
Ya I get that every now any then. I think it might be a lag thing to re-sync the radio for everyone. But I have no idea
---
Ahhh I before they nerf it.
---
I had several at white springs that were standing still. I could run right up to them, hit them then they would come to life. It was odd.
---
killed a glowing level 91 3\* deathclaw hour ago, I got a 1\* hunters pipe wrench.  pretty let down after looting that. I fight lots of level 62/68 mobs and end up with a level 50 legendary mob that is giving me a level 40 item? and I'm level 180. just disheartened when it is constantly like this. fight all the high level mutants at west tek and end up with level 50 legendary mob . hate it..
---
Diseased is the new undercover legendary.
---
I care less about the star level than the item level.  If I kill a 3* lvl 20 enemy it should not drop lvl 5 gear.
---
I think I read on here that the diseased status overlaps the legendary status do a creature might be legendary but if he is also diseased then it won‚Äôt label him as legendary.
---
Indeed. It was a glorious time of no crashes. Then it's like, oh I'm sorry did you think this was a happy place LOL! All we can do is hope for the best. I just had to get it out cause I was about to pop a blood vessel.
---
spent a good 45 min trying to repair a power plant for 45 min and as soon as I walked into the control room to reboot the system - CRASH!
---
The only thing I can assume is there was a Blast zone at some point
---
Yeah, it definitely needs an adjustment to weapon damage
---
I think legendary enemies should be stronger based on the number of stars.
---
SO one star enemies are as current, they heal to full once.
---
Two star enemies also glow red after they heal, increasing their damage output by some factor (50%? double?)
---
Three star enemies heal twice, first time glowing red as two stars and getting the damage  buff, the second time they gain a speed buff and stealth.
---
Of course, the fixed three stars of the queen and sqautch shouldn't get these, probably, unless they get re tuned.
---
make three stars actually scary, dangerous opponents, then make them always drop worthwhile loot.
---
Yep i only go there when i need steel, all the low level ‚ÄòLegendaries‚Äô go straight to the vendor bot. 
---
All the events suck ass now. Normally i don‚Äôt do those because the bosses are always low level. Did a couple of hoard events last week, yep still the same, even when the majority of the mobs in the hoards were above level 60, the bosses were capped at level 32 or 40. They made sure the reward won‚Äôt be max level ever. Pure waste of time. Just farm at whitespring if Legendaries is what you‚Äôre after, which is really what the dev has been telling people to do. For events they think the action itself is the reward, so the loots need to be poor to balance it.
---
The Diseased enemy is actually a Legendary.  It just doesn‚Äôt show both in the name.   
---
It happens very often with Ghouls.
---
Ah right, yeah i was guilty of that with the sheep headed assultron quest, figured I'd take a look from the edge of combat, took a few pot shots to little effect and then got dead very quickly when it noticed me and charged over. I left my junk there in a little brown bag, by way of an apology  for thinking i was level appropriate for the quest. Haven't been back
---
Yes, we can only hope. They really don't interact enough with the community over these issues. They should be far more transparent, rather than trying to play it down. Honesty protects a brand and a product more than ignoring issues and pretending everything is perfect. We play it. We want to play it. Honesty goes a long way!
---
If you are dropping your shit because you didn't prepare that's on you.
---
This is more of a idea or suggestion of what should we do. I don‚Äôt have a change.org  account but I know how petitions work. Also I purposely put a question mark at the title to see what people think about this first before it actually happens. Seems like though someone randomly downvoted my post for no reason though. Must be a Bethesda employee lol.
---
2 things would help here.
---
1. Creating a gold/silver standard.  Gold scrap should be worth 5 caps and weigh .001 pounds. Silver should be worth 2 caps and weigh .001 pounds. This would make gold have a 5:1 value for a cap. Players could carry/stash gold and use it for transactions with eachother for high tier trades.
---
2. There needs to be a trade only window. You each select the item and you both have to hold a button to confirm. If anyone exits or disconnects the trade is cancelled.
---
Mole miners max level is 40, and enemies will never drop items above their level.
---
Yeh that's the shit that's like "bruh". So bad for morale!!
---
Didn't know that. Never had it before so I was quite Supprised just how many were dropping legendary items
---
No, I'm telling you.
---
Diseased now drop like legendaries.
---
No blast zone involved.
---
You'll see.
---
I think it's latency.  Someone killed them previously, and they spawned for you, only to realize "Wait, I'm supposed to be dead."
---
If the petitions get enough signatures they could have some impact. But in the end it's up to the developers in the end. And I'm sure you would need a large portion of the player base to actually get any results or feedback about it.
---
I've never experienced that.
---
My experience is if you kill a level 42 ghoul it will drop either a level 35 or 40 legendary. 
---
Maybe if you're a level 7 character and you tag a level 20, but I'm fairly certain that they always drop their level. This is why you don't do uranium fever if you want level 45 or 50 gear because mole miners only spawn at a Max of level 40.
---
I'm level 144, and still enjoy it myself as well, definitely worth it
---
This is more of a idea or suggestion of what should we do. I don‚Äôt have a petition account  but I know how petitions work. Also I purposely put a question mark at the title to see what people think about this first before it actually happens. Seems like though someone randomly downvoted my post for no reason though. Must be a Bethesda employee lol.
---
Oh that one also sucks. Thankfully only ever had it about 4 times but when it causes a rollback on a quest chain it's about the worst!
---
How do you know they didn't do that? Things slip through the cracks sometimes. That's how software development works.
---
I have the hearing of a dog but subtitles are essential.
---
This has been happening for a very long time and Whitespring is a good spot to encounter it. Enter a building and hear or see signs of a walker. Seconds later it dies. I have a theory that the newly departed are from a previous player's spawn and that server lag is involved.
---
I can see a legitimate reason why you may not want to use the CAMP machine - some players like to stash that away so it's more difficult to tell who owns a CAMP.  Or move it inside because it looks better that way.  Most players would want others to fast travel directly into their house.
---
But welcome mats?  Yeah, there's no valid excuse for not having something like that.
---
Not just now.  Have for some time.  Just search this subreddit.  2-3 month old topics about it.  
---
They are not just diseased enemies.  They are diseased and legendary.
---
Yes! That‚Äôs one of my points. It *might* get Bethesda‚Äôs attention but not buying repair kits or any of that stuff isn‚Äôt going to do anything. We want Bethesda to KNOW we‚Äôre upset. So we need a big audience to sign a petition to grab Bethesda‚Äôs attention on it. This may also open Bethesda‚Äôs eyes about what they‚Äôre doing.
---
Touch my base and I'll make sure you lose every cap you have.
---
In all seriousness, this is no way to be. I never really saw pvp to be worth it, but its definitely not the purpose of the game. I think the only decent pvp is going after the workshops, but thats kinda an endless battle.
---
My pedal cycle has got a puncture should I buy a repair kit?
---
Don't throw your own limitations upon others.
---
Mt Blair and the train yard have 7 or 8. 2 PA around and several gennies. Watch a YT video for all of them. 
---
There's a 50% core in the back of a van next to the crashed cars and bus between the golf club by the sulphur spring gazebo at Whitespring.
---
Nuka Cola plant has two.  One on the roof and one or two inside. 
---
Arktos Pharma had a PA inside security gate and a core on cabinet inside. 
---
There are several at the various abandoned mine shafts with one spawning in the middle of a radiation tower or on the yellow work cart next to it.
---
Blackwater mine has 2 or 3.
---
From the Welch station go to the back where the mole miners spawn there's a weapon's bench. jump the fence to the right of it go over the cliff and there's a dead red sentry bot with 3 dead assaultrons the core is in the bot.
---
Do Battle Bot event at Mt Blair yard and the sentry bot will have one and sometimes a core spawns inside the trailer where the master shutdown is.
---
At the train yard where there is a level 62 crowned sentry bot annihilator he's got one but be careful he's got missiles. Crouch on cliff above and wait for him to cool down. Nuka grenades with demolition expert take him out quick. 
---
You can find a few in Watoga inside the buildings. One in PA behind 3 locked door and there's a gennie in there and sometimes one also spawns on the racks where fusion cells are.  
---
Sometimes at the golf club at a higher level one of the ghouls will drop a 100% core. Or it will be in ammo container by door can chimes.
---
They drop in mobs and containers around cranberry bog.
---
That's one in flooded basement of Wavy Willards. Generator.
---
I think there's one at Hornwright industrial exec suite or basement. 
---
There's one or two at Monorail. One up top one at the gennie at the bottom. 
---
Robco has a fallen sentry bot on road leading up to it and a gennie around the outside.
---
West tek has a few. 
---
Generals steak house should have 2 and a chance for a third with boss drop.

Do Poseidon powering up fully. 
---
Claim workshop.  Craft bench.

Scrap.

You can get 8 an hour if you stay alive.

There are 4 or 5 also inside the plant. 
---
Check the abandoned plant expansion too. Beware ghouls. 
---
That's of the top of my head.  Good luck.
---
I just want to be allowed to craft kitchenware into a helmet. Collanders, stew pots, etc.

Travel down to the power plant outside Charleston. He frequently spawns in the river between the plant and the railway.
---
I'd also like to throw in a "ignore all events" checkbox feature, which seems to compliment the OP.
---
Sometimes I'm doing a very specific thing and I can't stand the additional location markers in my HUD. I then have to stop what I'm doing to open the Pip-Boy, find the damn event and unselect it.
---
It's a huge pain because there are 4 event tabs and then there are the Miscellaneous ones. It's an easter egg hunt every time I go in there!
---
I think it *does* notify you. For example, every so often I get a message to visit jack at the pumpkin house, even if i'm nowhere close to it.
---
I dress in women‚Äôs clothing and I hang around in bars üëÄ
---
I am a lumberjack and I‚Äôm okay....
---
Actually I did this ü§£ü§£ I totally forgot what I had on me and when charging into an event .. and then died like 3 times ü§£ it was nice enough to tell me someone else picked up my fallen stuff. But it was easy to replace what I had dropped.
---
Just dump your junk in some out of the way container then wander away from that container and message anyone on the server to come kill you.
---
Yeah, all the Mire outfits are cool but they were a horrendous drop rate even when the quests work. I'm not sure if it's just from dailies as I think there's a chance from events too.
---

It's just the garbage collector cleaning thrashed servers for reboot. Rare but happens sometimes and its good its happening.
---
I gotta say, all the jerks who have been complaining about how 'easy' the SBQ is and to give us a 'real fight' can just right to hell now.
---
Got any T-45 paints?
---
They should have just integrated Place Everywhere functionality from the FO4 mod. That's how building should be. If people want to make ugly immersion-breaking things, they WILL, even now. xD
---
agreed
---
I know a lot of people will always blame an engine, but I promise you that's not it. Engines are meant to be added to, not scrapped ever year. 
---
I have the disk as well, nothing is read out of the disk anymore since it's just making sure you own the game, I'm talking about the spinning disk drive vs a solid state drive. No reputable gaming system should have a spinning disc drive (hdd)
---
Can pulse grenades or nuke grenades damage it?
---
Sorry, nothing that‚Äôs not Atomic Shop which isn‚Äôt tradable.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really expensive in stimpack‚Äôs must admit but I wanted to try out being the conduit for as long as possible so I spent the morning before doing a pharma-pharma stimpack/chems run lol
---
Rip, thanks though
---
even if they buff the Alien Blaster, i agree Flatwoods Monster should drop rounds for it since it's a pretty rare encounter, but i especially agree if the blaster is kept in it's current state; it's absolute trash and yet the rounds for it are even more rare than they were in any previous game. I could understand the rounds being so rare when the game was a one-shot wonder emergency weapon, but in this game there's just no reason for the weapon to do such little damage AND for it's ammo to be so incredibly rare
---
Does anybody have a handle on when the Caps replenish, and if every vendor in the world shares the same caps pool?
---
Vats critical headshots with a rifle. Go stealth with Chameleon armor, use grenades. Assassin's sentinel is negated by stagger or criticals, rifles are good with both or heavy weapons for stagger with one gun army.  Wait for them to land from a jump to stagger them. Pump your perception to see player dots on the compass before they see you
---
I prefer the Gatling gun. It's  a heavy hitter with non expensive ammo. The .50 Cal is good too, but tends to burn through ammo. The LMG is worthless to me, it burns through expensive and useful ammo much too fast for it's relatively low damage.
---
Where do you get the mounted plans?
---
Awesome!!
---
People could exploit it for free fast travel, but I'd like if it only cost caps if you completed the event. Half the time you get there and it's failed already, or yea never even started.
---
I haven‚Äôt had any problems with them yet. I did notice yesterday while redecorating my camp that things would disappear and it was just super buggy in general.
---
Hi Jim, can you upgrade combat armor to BoS?
---
Most don't seem to have any sort of drop yet. A lot of bug ones seem to be tied to a quest called Stings and Things (which may not be implemented?), and others related specifically to the Burrows.
---
Yes I understand what you are saying. What I was saying is the engine needs further optimisation for the systems it's on. Engines also get updated with newer versions released, which is what needs to happen at some point, not just adding to it. I quite like their engine, there are however things that can be done better. Stability and building being the biggest two areas for me that I'd like to see them tackle.
---
I love Jon. He doesn‚Äôt try to use his fame to get things from others and it‚Äôs amazingüíï

I assume most of it will return in packs, and hopefully a bunch will come back for Halloween. Be nice to have a Halloween parade a la fasnacht

What turret change?
---
I think so. Stop on by and I‚Äôll give it a try.
---
Psn ?
---
Games been out for a few months and you think they should have taken popular ideas from the internet and either put them in game or announced that they will? Aside from the legal issue that could come up when someone sues demanding money for it, it also sh*ts all over their current employees. Petitions are a waste of time that only empower people who want to do the bare minimum while feeling like theyre doing something. With no regard to the time it takes to see those changes happen and even if they listened and implemented the change you wanted by the time it was in game youd of moved on and will still be annoyed with them. So no petitions wont work cause they take to long to appease the instant gratification of online mobs.
---
We aren't both wrong :)
---
It's 50%, but they don't show decimals so the numbers are sometimes off by one. In your example, 112/2 = 56 + 112 = 168, but it's rounding somewhere, so the 112 might really be 112.7 meaning it's 112.7 + 56.35 = 168.05, displayed a 168.
---
Level 71 reporting in (ps4). I server hopped for 3 hours last night trying to do this quest. Hit it 5 times, failed 3. 
---
Both wins I had to Sprint between pylons to only die shortly after from the DoT. All 5 there were 10-12 people on site, but noone else makes an effort on the pylons.
---
Idk about oneshots, in power armor I can take 4-5 hits from the Imposter.
---
If nothing else: **ACTIVATE THE FUCKING PYLONS IF YOU WANT TO WIN**
---
Higher level players have more history in their server saved profile. I‚Äôm level 209. Have learnt lots of plans etc etc. It would be interesting to know the level of other players having crashes. Could it be a well used profile with lots of learned items is much bigger memory wise than a new player. On fallout 4 the profile becomes more buggy the more you have done. This is a port of fallout 4. I have my fingers crossed the developers are managing memory correctly. I don‚Äôt know about you guys but my load time on entering a new world is getting longer and longer. I‚Äôm beginning to think don‚Äôt load plans or other items you really do need to keep your memory usage lower and therefore not have an issue shuffling memory with all your loaded items.  I hope I‚Äôm wrong and that I can keep using my hard earned character for a very long time. I don‚Äôt want to start again to stop the crashes.
---
Good point.
---
I built a stash box simply because I'd heard it was how one enables other people to access their own stash at your camp. Sometimes I set up in a heavily trafficked new player area so they can stock up on food, sleep, use the work benches, etc.
---
Yes this has been a slight issue for since the beta. It doesn't cut of much, but it would still he nice if we could adjust in game. Also you are correct ps4 display area change does nothing for the game itself.
---
Double agreed
---
Used all 62 of my stimpaks I had stored on 5 runs last night (TBH they were all gone by round 2)
---
Now I just need to go loot some SUPPLIES MOTHA F***A
---
I would love to see wallpaper or maybe even paint!
---
As a melee build, the only mirelurk queen that has ever given me trouble was the 3 star legendary from the Heart of the Swamp quest. The regular ones are super easy to kill, just stay behind her she turns really slowly so you can just keep hitting her in the back and she will hardly touch you at all.
---
This happens for me on ps4.  I was able to fix it by adjusting the settings on my tv.
---
I find max level, fully repaired T-51 helps a lot with stopping the one shots.
---
*did wear a helmet in 4 either* yeah totally
---
yeah one of my TVs has that option but not the other :(
---
So far there's only 4 that are obtainable from quests, no one knows how to get the rest yet but its suspected they might drop with the burrows dlc
---
This happens on the TVs in my house, but my projector in the basement displays everything fine. 
---
I‚Äôve tried everything in the setting on the TVs but it still cuts off, and then the projector displays it with no issue
---
As you say, too early to make any analysis on it. 
---
That said, people weren't expecting the lvl 70 Event boss we have now to just make mincemeat of them. Plenty of other imaginative ways to make lololololol DPS spam useless without tactics.
---
I might try this next time I already had a nice fellow from this sub helping me out.
---
Is my method of dividing the base Dmg by the max Dmg incorrect?
---
Yeah they definitely need a setting in game for that!
---
We all make mistakes. No reason to downvote. You live you learn.
---
So do you do Wasteland Whisperer to pacify the animal, making it no longer hostile, and then switch to Animal Friend and then you get the option to tame? And if you tame it, you then get the option to send to your camp? 
---
Does it work on hermit crabs?
---
There are certain spots, like my friend's camp that is a hotspot for the Alien to spawn.
---
Eh, matter of opinion. I enjoy killing others and taking their loot.
---
I think maybe when player vending comes out but hopefully we get a surprise and it comes sooner :)))
---
Better than adding fonv to switch
---
I can imagine the tunnels in the next update might unlock some of the mirelurk ones next.
---
I believe the difference is in damage and fire rate mainly for example I think the 50 cal fired slightly slower but does more damage and the minimum fires faster and does less damage
---
Im in the high 40s and I have had five 3* enemies all level 15 or 20 drop level 5 gear in the last week.
---
This is great
---
Awesome. Thank you!
---
When did they announce that it will be a wave mode?
---
"It's going to be playable for your average person who's put a couple weeks in the game, I want it to only be for the ELITE, I don't WANT new content for most players, JUST ME" shouts person on internet.   
---
Lets be clear here, level 50 is the max item level. Most mobs only go up to what, 68? And are kill-able by a level 50 player who's patient and well equipped.   
---
A level 50 character is   _maxed out_. Can have a full build, and can use those sweet duped 3* weapons you love so much. 
---
This post, and this viewpoint, is pointless, because it ignores how the game's actually structured. 
---
Shit's going to be easier for you because you've spent thousands of hours grinding, and or hundreds of thousands of caps buying max tier shit. But game content shouldn't be _targeted_ at the fraction of a percent of top-tier equipment having people.
---
It looks like we will need to go through it to reach the legendary vendor though
---
Well the fact they said it's doable solo,means it has no raid mechanics like the new event or destiny raids. I'd have liked those mich more than just shooting in a corridor.
---
It will be fun nontheless.
---
"I thought the game was gonna be crappy with other people, but since they give me free stuff its awesome!"
---
-OP
---
All of the vendors share the cap pool and it takes 20 hours to reset
---
That's "lag".  You're either on bad internet, and I speak from experience on that, or in a country very far from the servers.
---
Every time you spawn in I snipe the shit out of you, Insult Bot! Not giving me another one of those trash fliers!
---
The beat explanation here: the .50 cal eats ammo, medium damage, high accuracy. 
---
The lmg lower damage, cheaper bullets, eats ammo super fast.
---
 The minigun has low accuracy, high fire rate, lowest damage, cheap ammo, most bullets miss the target.
---
 The gatling gun high damage, super cheap ammo, low fire rate, no aiming, less ammo used per kills. 
---
The gatling I have is Bloodied Explosive and I got it to 829 damage, which can kill a scorchbeast in less than 10 shots. My favorite weapon now.
---
That would be cool. I've been hoarding junk and legendary items for the vendor in my stash and can't wait to finally get some more room lol
---
Yes they do. And from what I read, its 20 hours irl
---
I know Vault raids are forthcoming, but I think the disappointment here is that - look, let's be honest, the silos aren't that fun to run just for the sake of running them.  They are fun because of what results.  A big battle that unites half the server against a common foe.
---
Silos always tend to play out the same way.  The same layout (despite there being 3 different silos).  The same phases.  The same selection of enemies.  And it remarkably doesn't seem to scale that much based on the number of players involved - only the level of whoever started it.
---
The Burrows sound like they are just another silo.  A fixed layout, a fixed balance, etc.  I would prefer something that actually scales or is randomized in some way to keep it fresh.
---
It‚Äôs not a very convenient exploit when events are out in the wild and you have to load in, run away from any enemies that are there fast travel to another location or just continue running. Even if it was being exploited theres a better chance someone would participate in the event than to ignore it out right.
---
They they took soooooo mutch risk out of survival that pve players now grind in survival because it cost nothing to die there. They made hunting for players more lucrative in adventure by getting wanted there by blowing up bases and getting 100% caps from people hunting you. The last pvp batch went backwards. Player cap amounts need to be the same in both to fix this. 100% in both with a max cap loss of 100 or 150. Pvp players dont care about the xp they will follow the caps, things are going to get toxic quick if they dont fix it.
---
I have been listening to a few fallout 76 podcasts an led they mentioned that it would be save mode. I hope they are just misinformed. I have been looking forward to this for sometime.
---
Not everyone uses reddit. I don't think asking for people to leave your valuable junk alone will only do anything besides the complete opposite.
---
I knoww I have lots of teddy bears and magazines stored but can't use them xD
---
Five thousand centuries have not nearly even close to begun to think about passing since the release of the game. Jesus have some patience.
---
Aren‚Äôt you all worried griefers will steal?
---
This is a long-standing bug, "diseased" can over-ride the "legendary" title for no-star legendary mobs, and since it has no star, you can't tell it's a legendary until you loot it.   
---
It's usually a good idea to kill every diseased you see, as it \_might\_ drop a legendary item. Assuming your not one of those "I don't pick up 1 star" lucky assholes.
---
I was getting alcohol addiction pretty consistently while doing the alcohol daily challenges. I'd craft 25 or more of something and just down them at once.
---
I like doing only alcohol addiction and mentats because they balance out pretty well. Keeping up with more than two at once feels like too much hassle. I can maintain those two pretty effortlessly, even with only using found chems. I rarely have to craft mentats (but when I do, orange). I'm regularly taking grape at vendors which keeps it going too. If you use nuka dark and cola nut perk you can offset another addiction that takes away strength (but I use this to offset Bird Bones already).
---
Kk...I‚Äôll take your word for it since I seem to keep flubbing the numbers.  What you‚Äôre saying makes perfect sense I‚Äôll re-re-edit thanks again
---
I always pick up 1 star items. They sell well in my Shop
---
Seems to be across the board. Just certain actions are triggering it right now. They implemented a lot recently so it's happens I guess. I do know they said by removing the stash preview they got some memory back, so hopefully it ends up going to our stability haha
---
My internet is fine, and I live in Bethesda.
---
What are you talking about? The devs have implemented a lot of things because of the requests of people on here and on their forums, just because not every single request gets responded to doesn't mean they don't pay attention to what we want to see.  
---
The only thing I may agree with you on is the repair kits, but just refusing to buy them is probably the more effective deterrent to those than an easily ignorible petition. Also not everyone has strong feelings about them, fyi. Honestly if they help the game stay afloat monetarily and don't negatively affect my time playing without them, I honestly don't care if they exist or not.
---
There's a hardcore group of thieves around here who will karma bomb this post.   
---
They LOVE the unballaned and unfair system in this game that lets them walk up to your loot bag as you stand there, squat over it so you can't even \_reach\_ it and steal all your shit, because "that's part of the game".    
---
And yet some how \_this\_ form of griefing doesn't get you flagged for PVP, and that's just wrong.
---
This is a false choice.  A good design scales appropriately to anyone.
---
Nah, you're just a thieving asshat.
---
Nothing bro I've been submitting tickets trying to get through to them and haven't got a single reply
---
Lmao holy shit dude you sound like an entitled 8 year old. "Give me what I want or I'll break the other kids stuff!!!"
---
Personally no. But the dungeon is atound the corner so support items could go up in value later.
---
Having frequently rolled a legendary rolling pin, legendary lead pipe and legendary wood armor üòè. I think it‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôm not complaining about the legendary damage but the item itself that sucks.
---
A legendary rolling pin, a walking cane and lead pipe. If i could scrap the lead to make bullets it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad but it‚Äôs legendary so I can‚Äôt do anything but sell.
---
ATLEAST with the enhanced vendors, I can give BACK to bethesda What POS item they gave me
---
I'm responding to the post that exists, with a basic knowledge of what this dev  team is capable of and has done in the past.  Not putting forth some "dream dungeon" scenario.
---
Right, anything that's a Stash (not just a literal Stash Box, but anything under the Stash category) allows other players to access their own.
---
Dude you are a dick lol. Just a heads up, ANY question I see you ask in this sub I'll be copypasting your comment back to you. Thank you RES.
---
Assassins weapons are trash. It would have to be 30% for anyone to think about using one. At 10% just about any other prefix is better.
---
Since always. Don't listen to people who don't understand how mods work. Sometimes an update will break a mod, in which case you have to wait for the author to make an update. They are usually really good about that and have an update out within 24-48 hours.
---
That's not the issue you're referring to though. Sometimes Bethesda changes the ba2 files that hold the meshes, textures, and whatever else to make the game work. When they do that, you just have to change the list of files in your custom ini. The easiest way to do it is to look at the regular Fallout76.ini file after an update and compare it to your custom ini. For example, I have a number of mods that are listed after the "sResourceArchive2List =" line in my custom ini. So what I do after an update is go into the Fallout76.ini file, copy the entire list of ba2 files that appear after that line and paste them into my custom ini before any of the ba2 files that are added by my mods. Make sure you have a comma after the last official ba2 file and before your mod ba2 files and everything should work just fine.
---
You may also have mods that use lines other than the one I mentioned above. I have a map mod that is loaded with the "sResourceIndexFileList =" line so I have to do the same thing with the files listed in that one.
---
The reason people were falling through the ground is that Bethesda added a "generated meshes" ba2 file that contained most of the ground meshes and when people didn't have that in their custom ini their game wasn't loading the ground, basically. It's very easy to keep updated once you understand how the game works, takes less than a minute after each update.
---
Yeah, if you want to know what the multiplier was, divide the 'after' number by the 'before' number. 150 divided by 100 is 1.5, a multiplier of 1.5 is 150% of the original, or 50% added on.
---
What is only the queen and imposter sheep squat he were the only guaranteed 3*drops?
---
Mods are not working right now hopefully the next update will fix.
---
It caps somewhere around 50% and increases every time you hit the same target in succession.  I believe it increases by 5% for each hit.  So, it's not going to be that useful against random mobs, but against anything with a fair bit of health, it will show its strength.

Here is the original thread, the Prepper Trapper is under the outfits tab and the Travel Sticker is under the skins
---
Here's my honest advice. If you can get it for about $20-30, it's worth it. It's not worth the idiotic launch price, as yet. It probably never will be. The new DLC is a let down, though the actual quest and side quests are a neat diversion, the end game boss isn't worth actually doing unless some other asshole drops the 2k to spawn it.   
---
But it's fun for what it is, as a game. If you enjoy exploring the world of fallout 4, you'll enjoy exploring this world. There aren't nearly as many quests to discover, but there's lots of neat little scenes and abandoned shacks and bits of lore tucked away.
---
Ok thanks
---
Melee hits not affecting your target. Either not doing any damage or a small fraction of what should actually be done.
---
Odd, I just repaired a few weapons and it didn't happen to me.  It had before though.  Not sure if what /u/MayorOfMorningside applied to me, I'll have to check it next time I need repairs (should be soon :P )
---
It was likely this
---
They were never meant to show the nuka cola effect like the lamp at the frat house, it was a bug and Bethesda have fixed the bug so they show as plain white lights like they did before the nukashine quest dropped, it‚Äôs a real shame
---
hey do you still have plans for shadowed combat armour?
---
Good luck \_ever\_ getting this one to work. We know bethesda's track record on fixing these things.
---
Sure,I'd love to place infinite turrets like in fallout 4.
---
First time i did the sheepsquatch event I was rewarded a drill. Second and third time both wood leg armors. Killed a three star gutsy in the last event, got a one star baton. In all those events I was the main contributor who not only served as pylon god the whole time but also slaughtered the sheepsquatch with my primed TSE 50 cal from rooftop. The three star bosses are outright a joke at this point when I could kill a ghoul in WS with two axe strike and get better reward. The latest patch nerfed legendary so much it‚Äôs like why creating those events at all.
---
No. Because you're limited to, at most...what, 3k pounds? Where before, hoarders would have MILLIONS of pounds? Its not enough crap.
---
You need both?
---
Faak I acquired them during the bug and was madly in love with them. Damn shame
---
Railway spike access only.
---
Is it just the premade mods?
---
I made a set of fully modded t60 Thursday but that was using plans
---
Lack of experience and incompetence.
---
And recently disconnects seem to be decreasing, at least for most people - I know some people still have issues, but a lot of people have said that they get fewer after recent patches.
---
While that doesn't prove anything, obviously, it does at least point in the direction OP is leaning.
---
Can you seriously just let them work on whatever it is they‚Äôre doing instead of just complaining about it? They are aware people want a timer and are working on it, but it‚Äôs not just a flick of the wrist.
---
Then that would basically remove the main function of the CAMP being able to drop it by where you are questing to have a base to work from while you are questing in that area.
---
If they were instanced like you said then using them for fast travel would be pointless, having them near where you are leveling so you have access to all workbenches would be pointless, not to mention defending them would be a pain in the ass then.
---
Nope, there was no duping being done and I didn't get the warning saying it would be destroyed. 
---
I also had level 45 armour while They had 25 so if i gave them mine they wouldn't be able to use it
---
I‚Äôm ok if they make them rare and hard to find, but going through all the trouble to find and defeat them then being rewarded a drill or wood leg is the dev saying ‚ÄòF you and your time‚Äô to their players.
---
That is the grafton monster, isn't it?
---
The cap of furios is 30% damage!
---
Plans are working but not mods you attach.
---
Same issue I've been experiencing. I have to close and reopen the build menu after every other object.
---
i had a similar issue when i purchased them, an easy way to fix it is to place normal stairs and use the scrap/store menu to change them to the atom shop stairs. like how you can with walls, changing a normal wall to a doorway or window
---
Ahh shit, all I wanted to do was acknowledge their kindness but you're right. Damn shame.
---
Xbox but thanks dude!
---
Fallout76 could use the build anywhere mod from fallout 4.
---
Yeah, this 25k thing is...nuts. It makes no sense...the few people who are selling max tier weapons and armor often want 35k+ caps for it. So you have to have a mule with caps, and it's just a mess.   
---
People have argued that raising the cap limit would increase the cost of gear, and that's stupid, because \_most gear isn't available for caps now\_ that's worth \_buying\_. It's pretty much not worth LOOKING for high end gear, because it's only on the market for specific trade items of equally high value.   
---
AAE for TSE+caps, etc etc.
---
Thank you! That worked for the single stair but not for the platform stair!
---
Just in case you all have realized it- the reason none of this is in game, along with why we have things like camp budget limits, is for performance reasons. 
---
The more textures and models you stuff in one area, the more the game has to keep track of for rendering, collision, pathing, damaged etc. In FO4 it was single player. 
---
When you‚Äôre dealing with an online game, that still allows you to craft basically anywhere (name me one other game that does this other than Minecraft and some of the Survival games like Rust, which are all super simple models and textures for crafting placeable items) it‚Äôs a very major concern.
---
LOLwut?
---
Well there are tons of things people have been asking them to add and they said they would and still haven't. So sadly it is pretty much required to hound them about things to get anything done with this game.
---
Really the only difference having tougher enemies would make is that they would do more damage and take more hits. If a top tier player wants this to be more of a challenge they could always choose to go in with lesser armor, non legendary weapons etc. It would accomplish the same thing.
---
You are correct,  but the focus of the observation differs from my request. The notification(s) to which you refer are dailies and have a trigger in place (e.g. when you enter a specific area, get near a specific item, etc.) My post is directed at those events, other than dailies, which occur randomly across the spanse of West Virginia.
---
Yep, it is a nice idea, but I hope that there will be no glitch that power armor disappears after you server hop
---
I had hoped it would be the hunting lodge up near space station. 
---
Since they have daily game hunt type quests.. ah well
---
RNG is fine but don‚Äôt give us a three star to fight then throw a one star wood trash or drill and syringer at us as reward. It‚Äôs outright lies not RNG.
---
"Hey everyone let's start shitting on Bethesda again. Lol lol lol. New stuff isnt out yet but hey the fools gave us a description we can whine about!"
---
Give it a chance before you judge. The expanding world is still new and everything cant be the epic end game quest you expect. It's meant to be re-playable.
---
If they'd released this game as server code, I'd have been running this single player/co-op with a very few friends from a server in my house from day one and the game would be \_so\_ much more fucking enjoyable than this forced to play with griefers bullshit.
---
I got 2 drills from 3* legendaries in 2 hours last night.....WTF? I can't remember anytime when I got 2 handmade's.....2 lever guns.
---
The fact that drills are not only still in the loot pool but seem to be weighted is beyond annoying.
---
They have already negatively effected game play. They are why the repair function is all kinds of screwed up in workbenches now.
---
Better yet- why not a Protectron along the lines of the lumberjack model ones? Instead of having legs or treads, its lower half IS the mower.
---
Its been an on going issue. Not just the last few days.
---
It might not be. In one note, they discuss buying the van Lowe property before Lewisburg property prices plummet. The sheepsquatch may have just been a ruse to buy the land for less than market value to dig for gas. Ultimately, Calvin builds the imposter, but can't stop himself from adding the meeting rituals just in case the really sheepsquatch is out there.
---
Riiiiight. Sure. Makes a lot of sense smfh
---
So you want a tartarus (bad spelling? Dont watch the doctor). I actually kind of dig this idea. Personally I want a bunker door in the ground leading to my c.a.m.p.
---
Not really, because there will always be people who suck at the game who want any advantage they can get who will buy these. On top of the other things bethesda said in the post about repair kits.
---
I am online as we speak for the next few hours as well.
---
I‚Äôve been crashing much less frequently after shutting down steam, discord, Firefox and only running 76. Discord seems to be the worst offender, unfortunately.
---
Now when they replenish, is that always on the same clock, or does it start 20 hours after I buy something?
---
Participated yesterday. We just sat with ??? Emotes the entire time. When the terminated supervisor announcement plays, a single mole miner would wander out eventually. Not even legendary. 
---
However, the event at Robco research facility spawned 5, 3* legendaries!
---
Oh
---
Oh sometimes my first VATS melee does zero damage. So that? Very frustrating.
---
Hell yeah, I would love a power armour stand in my new trophy room I‚Äôm building.
---
Just like the others it had that option to press the button.
---
I appreciate the man in the clown costume baffled by how you solo'd that thing.
---
They are gonna be letting us do this according to Bethesda come some time soon with new armor stations as well. Least thats what ive herd an read.
---
Power Armor Stash BOX!   
---
It looks like Power Armor but it functions as a stash-box. So then it is just cosmetic. Game Changer
---
Bought a second account. 
---
Filled it.
---
Now im leveling mules for weight reducing armors. ~2800lbs each, here I come
---
In FO4 I had every power armor set I kept displayed on the roof of my home in Sanctuary (other than the 2 that were on either side of the front door)
---
It was the only thing I did in game that my husband told me he wished he would have thought of first.
---
Pretty sure that Vendor stash is set to a 20hr clock and not 24 hrs, so by the same time next day you shouldn't be having any problems.
---
I'll be on in an hour u wanna go to some high level areas lol
---
Go do the event Uranium Fever, loot everything from every miner, then over encumbered walk to Whitespring Station, and sell it all.  One event with max perks will cap the whole 1400.
---
Could just be a chance thing! Maybe specific weapons? I think the two it had worked on were a sniper rifle and a combat knife. Either way, it is definitely broken!
---
Nice! Congrats :)
---
Well, I mainly decided to put on butcher's bounty temporarily to double my rad ant meat for rad ant lager, but I kept it on when I was farming for acid with the bloatfly syringer.  I didn't really need the meat, but I guess it was a good way to get fertilizer as well as the meat eventually spoiled.  I went over to Helvatia so that the bloatflies would be low level and I just shot and bash attacked to turn a single scorched into pretty much infinite acid and meat.   At one point, I had the other scorched in the area helping me by killing the bloatfly for me.  I ended up with around 90 acid, 180ish bloatfly meat, and 1 Sheepsquatch meat before the syringer broke and had to be repaired.  Not bad for a few minutes of farming.
---
I wouldn't be playing, the game would be insanely boring. Those events are nothing like a raid in Destiny I couldn't imagine having to do them over and over to get 3* loot....... especially if my rewards were Hunters Pipe Wrench and the such.
---
My boi you‚Äôve had the answer all along. You‚Äôre catching on quickly! Statistics say that 99.98% of people who attempt to use google fail because of the complexity of usage, and hence we get the overload of questions swarming this once innocent sub. Now get out there and explore what else google has to offer, live, and enjoy your life, my sweet summer child.
---
But always remember what uncle ben once told a young man possessing this kind of power, - ‚ÄúWith great power comes great responsibility‚Äù.
---
No, and no. That‚Äôs not how it works. 
---
Not all animals can be tamed. But all animals can be pacified, except scorchbeast Queen. Even regular Level 80 Scorchbeasts can be pacified. 
---
Taming is when you can send them to your camp. 
---
Pacifying is just stopping the from being hostile. 
---
Pacifying is very easy and can be done anywhere in the wasteland. 
---
Taming is can only be done in very specific circumstances for it to work. 
---
To tame, the animal must be half your level or lower. So if you‚Äôre Level 100, the animal can‚Äôt be higher then level 50. 
---
The animal must spawn in a RANDOM spawn location. Not a dedicated spawn location. 
---
There are three known Random spawn areas on the map. Random spawn means that it‚Äôs not the same animal spawning in the same location every time. 
---
The animal must spawn ALONE. If it spawns with others, it won‚Äôt work. 
---
Your CAMP must be pre-existing and must have spawned when you joined the server. 
---
If all of these are met, when you point and aim a gun at the animal, you will have the option to Pacify or Tame (note, must be gun of some sort, this does NOT work with Melee Weapons). If you choose tame, another box will pop up asking if you want to send the animal to your camp. You click yes, and the animal will start to slowly walk. 
---
The health bar of the animal may not turn white. It might stay red, but they are no longer hostile. This can be done to Legendary animals as well. 
---
Do NOT follow the animal to your camp. You being there will cause the game to spawn enemies that may kill your pet. 
---
It can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 real time hours. It‚Äôs ok to leave the server in this time. 
---
When the animal is in your camp, they will defend it against low level attacks. The animal will also be hostile to other players. 
---
If you are on a team, the team members cannot hurt the animal and the animal cannot hurt them even if either try. 
---
You cannot kill your pet, but anyone else can, unless on your team. The player that kills the pet SOMETIMES gets a bounty. 
---
Taming low level animals is at your own risk. The lower the level, the less likely they will survive the journey and less likely they will last long in your camp.
---
So you think you're talented by using duped gear and attacking noobs' bases to start PVP with them? Absolute entitled dick here, folks
---
They absolutely Increased drill‚Äôs chance while they said it‚Äôs removed from loot pool. It‚Äôs an outright blatant lie. I‚Äôve been taking screen shots of all the drills and syringers after the patch, I‚Äôll make a big collage and let potential buyers of the game know what they are buying into. 
---
https://m.imgur.com/KfueGrz
---
It‚Äôs not 24 hours after you empty them.  It‚Äôs 20 hours after you first use their cap pool since the last reset.
---
What is this Watoga nerf you speak of? Did they make the bots impossible to be legendary?
---
This isn‚Äôt asking for an entirely new system, just a change of fast travel cost. Hell Bethesda said they take information about what people want from reddit themselves at PAX2019. Apparently someone asked for repairs kits on here so we‚Äôre getting that, people asked for mounted creature heads we got that but only 4 of them so far, people are begging for faction themed items, asking for a reduced fast travel cost to do more of their game content isn‚Äôt such a huge stretch
---
we need a "Place Everywhere" mod in the atom shop.
---
I think this would be a great idea. Many people buy the nice skins in the Atom Shop. Half the time you don‚Äôt get to see or appreciate it.
---
I wish I was on ps4 so I could help
---
The only way a bounty is removed is by someone killing you. Dying/changing server won't help in The slightest. It actually makes it worse as people will get the notification "so and so is now wanted" in the top left hand corner and will go and kill you
---
I am on Xbox!
---
Xbox!
---
Stop fast traveling and leave the beaten path, you‚Äôll find them then
---
I fixed my shotty and another weapon, pretty sure it was my sniper.  I use those most.
---
I'll see if slowing down helps next time.  It's a bug, either way, but they know about it so I'm sure it's being looked at.
---
For the love of God don't drop them if they're painted.
---
My friend painted my first set of excavator for me, we were both new to the game. He didn't get any warning menu or anything on PC, it just disappeared. We later learned you cant drop painted stuff.
---
Probably due to the bug from patch 8 that doesn‚Äôt allow you to apply loose mods to weapons, armor, or power armor.
---
I would pay atoms for a nuka girl wallpaper 100%
---
Don‚Äôt be disappointed when it‚Äôs limited to shelves and display cases
---
The cake is a lie.
---
Things glow purple when when you take grape mentats I think
---
How much for the  LVL 50 (3\*) Combat Right Arm. Chameleon?
---
Better yet please give us power Armor stand to display them
---
Looks like tis working with it!
---
Ufffff *logs in immediately*
---
Wait, what do you mean by 200+ weapons? I'm pretty sure there are barely 100 when counting both guns and melee, not to mention a good chunk can't drop as legendary. Unless you mean 200+ effect combinations
---
There already is one, you just have to be relatively close to the Pylon Ambush Site for the notification to pop up. I remember there was one for Fasnacht but it rarely alerted me because my CAMP was too far away.
---
Berry mentats, grape mentats help with buying and selling to vendors
---
I'm Amazed at how lived-in your camp looks even though things like OCDecorator don't exist in Fallout 76
---
One's light, one's mini.... you get where I'm going with this?
---
I also am on this boat. I personally think that drops should be directly commensurate with the about of perks you have invested in luck.
---
You've got 20 Luck rocking with perks, amour and various bonuses? Yep - a 3* from a 3* enemy is basically guaranteed. If you're rocking a shitty luck stat? Suck it.
---
My guess is that the number crunchers at Bethesda have a specific probability they are targeting per roll and the drills and syringes are just fillers that they add in to adjust that number.
---
I've ruled out incompetence at this point.
---
The same issue with Collision Course, used to be 7 or 10 scorched per wave, it 3 now.
---
Unfortunately, I don't think I can.  I would have liked to change it to put a question mark after "Sheepsquatch confirmed?", but it doesn't seem that it is possible to change the title.  However, I'm pretty new to using Reddit, so perhaps I am missing something.  Only ever used it for trading Pokemon for breeding a few years ago and now Fallout 76 trading.  Oh well, at least I have that second part saying that I found its meat rather than saying that I found a sheepsquatch.
---
Damn, thank you so much for this!
---
im not a witch, im your wife!
---
Yep.
---
It‚Äôs just a Special Effect that distinguishes them apart from regular enemies of the same type. Legendary Mega Sloths get a green, and Legendary Ghouls and Scorched get a brownish orange from what I‚Äôve experienced.
---
20 hours after your first purchase
---
They don't spawn as legendaries at all anymore after the last update
---
&gt;that doesn‚Äôt mean Bethesda needs to buff legendary drops.
---
Given how rare it is to encounter a 3‚òÖ legendary mob along with how there is literally hundreds of thousands of possible unique legendary drops and no way to selectively farm them, legendary weapons have no business being as rare as they are.
---
Oh yea you right lol. I couldn‚Äôt remember which ones lol
---
Agreed. As someone said, I wouldn't mind if there stars spawned less often but that means you're guaranteed a three star item.
---
Dude, punctuation is your friend.
---
I've seen quite a few of them around. Mostly in deserted areas - if you fast travel between locations instead of walking there, that might explain it. Once I found one a bit north of fissure site prime while I was going towards a queen fight. Other times I can recall were in the mountains near silo bravo, and in the hills east of camden park.
---
A lot off weird thinks are happening,my other workshop got attacks by 3 scorchbeast dragons in same time so I had to defend my workshops
---
No worries haha
---
Yeah, I've killed 25+ grafton monsters there and never a flatwoods monster. Although maybe they changed it at some point, I haven't been there in a while
---
I never realised how nice these look.
---
pretty sure those have been in place for awhile
---
THis! fucking love power armor. Fucking love this game. WHY do I always have to carry or storage my power armor. Couldn't you get apartments in fo3? wtf I want to play this game more than anything but I kinda need the devs to work with me a little.
---
I honestly didn't check. Whether it's 100 or 200 isn't really as important....my main point is that the size of the loot pool is massive compared to a game like Destiny. You can't have the same drop rate as Destiny if you have 2,000 (made up number again) more useless weapons added to the loot pool.
---
They where all called Super Mutant Primus I never heard about Primus Mutant
---
A set time would be nice actually, say 12am EDT as an example (or 5am to encourage the more addictive players to sleep, like me e.e)
---
You have to server hop the one place in the game where the rounds spawn, and even then it's anywhere between 5-25 rounds, if even that. On a weapon that can deal MAYBE 50 damage per hit with a perfect loadout, can not have legendary effects, and is difficult to get at level 50.
---
Nah, was still the Grafton Monster there earlier today at least.
---
Yeah, it appears that you always learn the most basic recipe for cooking something when you find a new type of meat.  It just doesn't announce it as learned like when you consume a recipe plan.  In this case, it was the mutton chops, not to be confused with mutt chops.  I imagine that there will probably be a more complex recipe that can be unlocked with a recipe plan though.
---
I think they said two level 50‚Äôs to make it clear that it‚Äôs not designed for solo... so don‚Äôt be salty if you cannot solo it and start finding friends if you don‚Äôt have them already. 
---
They‚Äôre not saying it‚Äôs that easy, but that it‚Äôs that hard. 
---
Just like ‚Äúan eye for an eye‚Äù isn‚Äôt a statement of wrath. It‚Äôs a statement about justice. It doesn‚Äôt say you must take an eye; it says you cannot take two! 
---
No ‚Äúif he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue‚Äù.
---
I'm not familiar with the one other title this dev team has worked on, did that game have similar features to what you're describing?
---
I can tell you 95% damage reduction + scaly + grounded doesn't do shit.
---
lol quit being so dramatic.
---
i use tank killer, riflemsn, glow sight
---
There's also:
---
1. Military duct tape - Go up the stairs left of the Overseer's cache to the second level. Walk towards the back wall and on the left, there is a table with a sack, and a bowie knife on top of a roll of tape.
---
2. Military Ammo Bag - Inside a long truck/bus in front of the barracks, on the right side.
---
3. Military duct tape - Sitting on the crates in front of the leftmost barrack
---
Huh. Wouldn‚Äôt the glass at least broke?
---
Also cathouse se of morgantown
---
Set time would be the best.  Other things like challenges and daily quest reset at the same time every day.
---
Yes, probably but the repair costs are high. I rather run around in a full suit of Excavator power armor with the new raider skin.
---
Nothing special they are just a higher lvl
---
Ah, I thought you meant the fog effect, they‚Äôre the apex super mutants, if my understanding is correct
---
It's visually bugged, but still usable (albeit frustrating). By negative impacts, my idea of that is jacked up repair costs for items or increased weapon decay, not an extra button press.
---
That pretty much nails it. I have a bloody explosive LMG that will cut anything down in three seconds flat... but dear lord, the ammo it uses.... I'd have to live at the ammo factory to use it on a regular basis. Super accurate. Crazy fire rate. Good DPS,  bad DPH.
---
Added to my "WTF was beth thinking?" mods.
---
You are a hero.
---
Bummer but I guess that‚Äôs fair. It was kinda like taking candy from babies.
---
Same problem PS4. Got right to the end and had to leave game. Now I logged back in and the quest and all the items for it are gone and I can't restart or continue the quest.
---
Why do you say that? 
---
The legendary vendor‚Äôs location is known. It‚Äôs the closed harpers ferry train station, just Northwest of the city. It‚Äôs not deep underground. You can walk right up to the door. You can already peek in the windows.
---
What hats fit with the gas mask exactly? The sack hoses?
---
Alright I‚Äôll try that thanks
---
Ya.  We noticed this yesterday when s cargo bot and escort showed up after the encrypted event finished.  And it stayed white until it was dead.  Hard to hit those motors without vats.
---
Yea like from the beginning
---
Because Fallout 4 wasn‚Äòt running on a server. If 20 people had their power armor lying around with different ids and so on, the server would crash.
---
Ok I‚Äôll try them thanks
---
Can you make me a twisted muscles and a talons please?
---
Commando is for auto.
---
Rifleman is for non-auto
---
Will probably not be addes due to server lag. I mean, we can‚Äòt even pick up little items, so dozens of power armor suits would wreck the server.
---
I'm glad that Excavator PA counts as raider armor thanks to the new skin :)
---
Gotcha.
---
Sack Hood gas masks do not support hats as they cover the whole head, but the Gas Mask and Gas Mask With Goggles support hats because they don‚Äôt cover the whole head.
---
That‚Äôs my quarrel with Urban/Forest Scout Gas Masks as they don‚Äôt cover the whole head either but act as a full head helmet
---
Ooo so a hand made is a non auto gun gotcha thanks I‚Äôll try that
---
Because from people that have glitched into it there is a big hole in the floor and it doesn‚Äôt seem like something they would make it easy to get to.
---
Yes please! Bought brick plans yesterday and ran into this today. The brick looks weird with the rest white
---
Why not? It is a free stuff.
---
agreed, also would be nice if they fix the power armor animation...
---
Thanks, that's useful. I checked the stats in-game, and they don't make any sense at all. For instance, the fire rate for my .50 cal is listed at 91, while the fire rate for my 2-shot gatling gun is listed at 400 -- but I know the gatling gun shoots a lot slower. The accuracy for the .50 cal is listed as 31, while the accuracy for the minigun is listed as 51 -- but I know the minigun is less accurate. It would be nice if the stats listed were reliable, y'know?
---
Yeah took me a few minutes to get it to become hostile. I guess its just a new challenge, not like it wasnt a pain already lmao
---
How do I apply the mods, I‚Äôve got a servo mod for raider armor and am about to get excavator.
---
My opinion: yes, but only if you plan on really exploring the entire game possibilities. Otherwise it can be boring and over quickly.
---
Also, getting better, they seen to be really listening to players
---
handmade can be either semi or full auto, it depends on the receiver you put on it
---
What you are looking for is the 'Pneumatic' affix, which can be applied specifically to chest armor. 'Pnuematic' is supposed to specifically reduce stagger (although, lately, it's effect seems reduced... if not absent; it used to be outstanding in reducing stagger. Now... not so much.)
---
I offer not only caps in exange, can be other ways of trade it if you understand ;)
---
It is much better now. For 11bucks it's definitely worth it.
---
O didn‚Äôt know that either
---
agreed! the lying lowe "quest" was pathetic. what was the point? terrible
---
I‚Äôd rather they stick to the wasteland theme, since they already have a fantasy themed franchise that a few people have heard of and is mildly popular.
---
Just the title is awkwardly named just wanted you to know
---
Yea definitely.
---
Yeah exploring is the main thing I want to do. My favourite thing in FO games was allways the world and art style
---
Not saying you're wrong at all, but there is absolutely no evidence to support this claim, other than pessimism.
---
I'm OK with pointing out the possibility that things may be problematic, but it's disingenuous to claim that something is a fact when have no evidence to back that up.
---
A well-timed screenshot can get almost all of the info, and a second one easily grabs SPECIAL stats. Just gotta get it right as the exp reward pops up, and then you get the item rewards (perhaps mid-fadeout), caps, exp, and often the quest title as well.
---
But yeah, I run vanilla. I‚Äôm totally open to contributors though, got a Gdrive folder where folks can just dump screenshots and then I process them into the sheet.
---
I'm trying to buy one on Xbox. Can't find one.
---
Maybe it should stay aggro, like the bots in watoga after the mayor quest
---
Make an offer.
---
Because i am washing it everyday.
---
What's your platform?
---
Pc
---
Let's be honest, Bethesda are fully aware that an MMO-esque game's end game is strongly associated, if not entirely driven, by gear incentives. The god roll 3 star legendary is currently what is appearing to give the game it's longevity through the guise of a grind.
---
All manner of ways that players found to most efficiently grind top lvl 3* legendary items have been nerfed since release. Yet, how long has everyone been talking about issues concerning mobs not dropping any legendaries, let alone the correct star multiplyer?
---
I enjoy this game and still acitvely play whenever I have time, but let's not pretend the current top lvl 3* attainment rate isn't by design...
---
I haven't been on in Xbox in forever but I have it for xv1 as well..  been trying to get ps4 up to snuff before j go to xb1 too
---
That‚Äôs why they are legendary.
---
thats a good idea, tho I will admit it took me longer than it should have to realize the bots were that way haha
---
I did that to preempt the argument that has happened to me in the past when peeps with less experience.    We seem to have upset or triggered you, and if so, I am sorry.    
---
Peace
---
Ahh damn,I'm Xbox, and it's still worth it to me lol
---
I know PC is 1000x better ~~for any game~~.
---
I suppose only if the skin comes from the Atomic Shop
---
What is it worth to you?  
---
I have a level 20 (1\*) Chameleon Left Arm which is worth 160 so maybe 500 for yours?
---
If we could get a pack Brahmin, it would get stuck on every curb, light pole, tree and rock in Appalachia, then teleport directly in front of us when we‚Äôre smashing down SBQ. I‚Äôm laughing just thinking about what a shitshow it would be. A+ for creative thinking though.
---
I mean I think it would give people who do these events, which cost so much ammo and AIDs a reward. I also see where you are coming coming from though.
---
I would love this option for my camp. It‚Äôs bad enough my stash is always full so leaving the power armor out would be great!
---
When you get on Xbox message me
---
Not really . For example not even try to play GTA online on Pc if you want  a normal experience. And it really depends on the Pc. I managed to buid mine for 200$ and it has a Gtx 960 wich is still pretty decent
---
It's much better now theres more things to do now
---
This is just awesome and so true!
---
Great idea
---
500 would be fair. I had it stored for awhile. Same GT as reddit name, in game now.
---
Is griefing the other people with my team counts as a coop gaming?
---
I see that so often that I call then stillborns
---
You have a chance to learn the plan from scrapping any piece of combat armor, excluding the helmet. I learned them all by crafting and scrapping light left arms because they‚Äôre the cheapest
---
I never spawn near where my camp object was originally placed (or where it is now).  I almost consistently spawn about halfway to the border to the north, though sometimes I spawn up in the air (I placed some floors there, and once in a great while I'll spawn on one, but I think they don't load fast enough).
---
I can see why the welcome mat idea may cause issues, but there needs to be something changed, it's a bit frustrating as it is.
---
He's great isn't he? Been following him for a couple of years now, always entertaining
---
What platform are you , I have 2 combat armor shadowed leg mods I sell for 150 Caps each ?
---
I'm pretty sure it doesn't it will usually say o  the description on the perk card.
---
This happened to me last night with two different horde events. Killed the 3* alpha to end the event and the body vanished as soon as it died.
---
Are there skins that don't come from the Atom shop? Genuinely asking. I thought all PA paint jobs were from the Atom shop.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why they would make so many unique variations on what could be considered the same outfit .
---
Mods are broken right now hopefully the next update will fix.
---
Love to have the Chinese stealth suit, recon suit, and some propaganda posters.
---
Except that‚Äôs not a function in the game. It doesn‚Äôt exist. So your argument is invalid
---
with exception to the named items, all errors clear with a relog to main menu
---
Lol, I get it...  But after all the wasteland is all about re-purposing and using whatever is available...
---
Yep. I don't have any tho. But I saw some, BoS ones for example.
---
Would love to have scout armor mask w the scarlet sniper hat
---
Then there‚Äôs the time I went to go help kill the guy camping the whitesprings station on survival and the victims killed me instead
---
This sucks! I like this game but its these little bugs that make me want to stop playing all together. This was working fine before last update.
---
Couldn't anyone just come up and take it that way?
---
I thought of that then I got technical and thought "Power armor is technically armor" so yeah
---
No problem. Thanks for offer.
---
Dozen three star legendaries killed today and all dropped 1-star junk.
---
Yeaa that's It is armour so I'd be surprised if it doesn't work for it then.
---
If legendary is a euphemism for "poorly designed loot drops" then yes; they are very legendary.
---
It‚Äôs an argument from authority logical fallacy. I‚Äôm not offended by it (btw thanks for the second misdirection), but nothing about this random factoid makes your argument more valid. I think your points stand well enough on their own without injecting a point about your employment into it
---
It still sucks no big youtubers like yong or quartering or upper echelon etc will not do any positive fallout 76 videos but oh boy did they jump all over the fallout pay to win controversy click bait ahoy I feel fallout 76 will never recover at all unless these youtubers actually tell the other side of the story but they won‚Äôt but digress it is what it is I enjoy the game that should be all that matters in the end
---
I won‚Äôt reply to your other comment, as I said. But this one is so laughable I couldn‚Äôt help it. It just proves that not only do you not know much about gaming and business and dictionaries, you don‚Äôt know about geopolitics either. 
---
Corruption did cause all that. And what created the corruption? The socialist system that allows the ruling class to steal the wealth from everyone. 
---
History proves this over and over. Denmark is outspending it‚Äôs intake. The children have spent their parents money. And as the EU legs in all the migrants, it‚Äôs collapsing everything
---
This is indisputable. Please stop lying to people
---
They do exist! i only found it once inside a supply drop at Arktos Pharma. It seems to be rare but it does exist
---
Not as rare as the Fauschnaught masks
---
Agreed, I have too. I found him when fallout 4 first came out and I‚Äôve been around ever since
---
XB1
---
Nice! I only have managed to get the brown and green and yellow and two white uniforms. There's the "clean" white uniform and the dirty white uniform versions.  Hope to get a collection of all of them too.
---
Could be worse, got repeatedly smoked by a 3 star lvl 45 assaultatron which spammed its head beam non stop, just to get a 1star lvl20 wood leg piece.
---
Juan at and sont ask this question.. if it wasnt worth ayin would you see anyone on here?? Pplask this all the time jus play the damn game
---
Ya I thought on this too. Then I thought there must be plans for the power armor display like in fallout 4 so I spent a month looking for them. I hope this can be accomplished in the future.
---
Your treat is a hot potato and you will LIKE IT.
---
what did we leaaaaarn?
---
Depending on your make and model of TV, there generally are options for this, but some might only be triggered (or become available) by a few certain aspects. *(Note: just in case you use that mode, none of the text-wall below is dealing with "game mode", but could indirectly disable it, so don't do everything all at once and there will be nothing to fret about. Just un-do the last thing and re-enable game mode.)* 
---
For example, I have a late-2010 model mid-range (D6050) Samsung 46" LED backlit TV. I use it for a PC monitor in addition to a TV.   
---
\- For the most benefit to things like input delay and features, it's generally ideal to use "HDMI Input #1" (HDMI1). This is the first "trigger" that can cause certain menu options to become available that don't show up when connected to other HDMI inputs. *However*, it's always best to check with your specific TV to determine which of the HDMI inputs is assigned this way, as I *think* some TVs have that port as the last one *(ie HDMI #4, or #3, however many your set has).* An easy way to perhaps determine this could be in the Source menu, like on mine it says "HDMI1/DVI", which implies that HDMI1 is the port to use when connecting to a computer with the digital HDMI or DVI interfaces (the older VGA is 'analog' and not ideal).   
---
*(Note: just because you're using a console, does not mean it won't benefit you, BUT some TVs have a port intended for PC connection* ***and*** *some intended for consoles, so again... be sure to check!)*
---
\- There is also things like the ability to change the "Name" of an Input. Again, using my TV (though most seem to have this ability), if I open the Source menu (aka Inputs) and highlight the source, such as HDMI1, and then press the "Tools" button on my remote, it opens up an option to "Edit Name".   
---
Selecting that, gives me a whole list of pre-define choices that I can pick to 'define' the function of this port. For example, there's one for "PC"... BUT! This does more than just *label* the port, it triggers a whole bunch of behind-the-scenes things. In short it disables a ton of the post-processing capabilities which further lowers input delay and makes the TV function more like a Computer Monitor. :)
---
\- Next thing to look for may not be as obvious for some, but again may not even be *present* in the menu until certain conditions are met (like what I've mentioned above), are options that indicate something like Aspect Ratio or Picture Size. On mine, it's inside the menu category of "Screen Adjustments" and the option is called "Picture Size". My choices in there are: Wide Fit, 4:3, 16:9, Zoom1, Zoom2, **Screen Fit**. Instinctively you may select 16:9, but actually it's "Screen Fit" that you'd want. What this does is makes it so there is ***no*** Overscan, and the entirety of what is displayed is fit within the edges of the screen. On that note, your TV may even call it "Overscan" and maybe an Enable or Disable option, but will do the same thing as my TV's "Screen Fit" option.  
---
Overscanning is an archaic thing used with video displays that heralds back to when screens were CRT *(aka "those big, thick, heavy screens before LCDs or Projection TVs", or in other words, all the screens in Fallout like Terminals and your Pip-Boy!)* as by design their edges were hard to get perfectly straight, so instead of seeing an oddly curved or S-shaped edge on the screen, they "overscanned" the image beyond the edge to hide that. Well on our digital displays we don't deal with that (note: the VGA input being analog does technically still utilize it). Yet it's still an option and still somewhat part of broadcasted television, which you can see the lingering affects of it through the logo of a channel you're watching. Notice it's never really at the absolute edge on some channels? :) They're accounting for TVs with lots of overscan and don't want their logo to be cut off. *^((lots of local stations are far worse with this as they still seem to be making sure weird folks who still use 4:3 TVs can still see what channel they're on lol))*
---
**TL;DR-** I can't, sorry. lol Sincerely though, please take the time to read all of that, as I took the time to write it all in an effort to help you out! :D   
---
I will *gladly* reply to help out anyone that doesn't follow **any** part of what I've said, and will try to break it down into easier brain-digestible portions, just point out which specific part has you confused.   
---
I'd even be willing to try and hunt down if your TV even has any of the abilities I've mentioned and direct you on how to access/enable it. If you'd prefer that, just tell me what brand and the model number *(Sony, LG, Samsung, etc and model can easily be found on the back of the TV on a sticker, or on the box if you still have it. Taking a picture of the sticker with your cellphone may make it easier to type here or to even see it at all; use your flash!)*
---
They do. Just got one a few days ago. Hve near 230 levels between characters and just now finding it but keep looking, it's out there waiting for you.
---
I dont even understand their argument either oh people could make immersion breaking things.
---
*cuts to people filling the ammo factory up with safes then cuts again to the same person making a bunch of stacked stash boxes to build limit with crafting stations on them*
---
Lol that Christopher guy is a living logical fallacy. He has all these crazy fantasies and conspiracy theories, and doesn‚Äôt believe the dictionary definition of anything. He just makes it up, and says you‚Äôre wrong because it doesn‚Äôt match the definition he just made up. 
---
That guy is living walking breathing cognitive dissonance. The mental illness is jaw dropping
---
Oh man, that challenge absolutely sucked. A few guys figured out you can fast travel to the event, drop out, then shred everyone in it, and they auto respawn back in the event only to be shredded again. I had like a 5 death loop going once. Dudes in events should have a sheild that prevents them from being atracked by other players. There was a queen fight, and 2 greifers loaded up on 50+ kills. The event becomes unplayable. The decrease in death costs was a good move, but that mode still needs work
---
BOS and Nuka Cola for sure, maybe others?
---
Add a slider with up to 400% volume increase for audio logs...thx.
---
You are absolutely correct and infallible.   Feel better?   üòÇ
---
I think I've seen them in the Charleston Herald, top floor in the office next to the 3 circular orange cabinets, on the table in the corner.
---
Ah, I'm guessing you mean the unintentional innuendo?
---
Okay. I didn‚Äôt hear the reports about the floor. I have no idea what that means.
---
Also, you get the plans for free doing the main quest
---
If I had infinite money and time i would play them all.
---
One time mods are broken
---
Nope. its still a infuriating buggy mess, was seconds away from finally downing the games big bad for the 100th time and like clockwork game crashes. Here lately they have been drip feeding new content but its painfully small and slow and riddled with delays. Imho this game is another six months from even being considered a competent complete game.
---
Thanks guys i needed a little nudge to continue the search, i was starting to lose hope.
---
I believe we're known as redditors.
---
Literally just made the same post a few minutes ago. glad i'm not the only one who wants this.
---
Guess that‚Äôs why it get recalled quick. It seems like certain items are stored on our computer hard drive, others on their servers. I don‚Äôt get which is which, but I guess power armor needs their servers. If not we‚Äôd probably have displays like Fallout 4.
---
This is a very good idea and shouldn't be hard to implement because they already said that junk items will be able to be displayed on your camp. Also, in Fallout 4 your PA stayed where you excited it.
---
Not originally. Lol sexual reassignment surgery was brutal back then. Glad you survived. Take care.
---
I use an anti armor lmg. Sure the ammo is hard to come by and expensive to make but I've got the base damage up to 80 with heavy gunner perks and the fire rate is crazy fast. I also have a suppressors explosive one that does around 84. The suppressor on is awesome for group fights on the scorchbeast Queen or the new imposter sheepsquatch. Paired with the endagerol syringer the combo is awesome
---
I see all the requests for camp items or cosmetics, bit rarely do I see anything asking for more depth.  To me this game is like a Fallout-lite.  
---
Hopefully, the new quest they mentioned which affects the game world or somesuch will have to make one think.
---
Nope doesnt work on power armor.
---
Renames the chassis
---
Same Xbox, just to tell you with last patch they messed up attaching mods but it will be fixed hopefully ASAP . Just thought I would let u know before you decided to buy anything and yes I have 2 shadowed legs , 1 arm and also torso mods if your interested 150 Caps each
---
Yep. ^^
---
In the meantime, a tip would be to either: stop by your stash and put them in before you scrap, ***or*** to put them in a container next to you before scrapping and then pick them back up *(similarly, to stand in front of the workbench and Drop the items, scrap, pickup contents of lunchbag; this drops it under you and players can't access it in my experience).*
---
Seen it twice but it just dips out when I get close
---
Thank you so much, I can't wait for the clutter decoration update to make it look better
---
I love this guy
---
What renames the chassis? Any piece I pick? I don't see an option to rename the chassis itself
---
I keep that and somehow managed to forget lol
---
Better yet bring back the power armor symbol on the map. Let you leave it anywhere.  If you log out it returns to your camp.
---
You‚Äôre math is still backwards. You want to do 167 / 112 = 1.49, reverse it and try 112 x 1.5 = 168, which is close enough to assume theres probably some rounding going on that shows 167.
---
Also 134 x 1.5 = 201, 1 off from 202 on the shotgun so once again the delta of 1 is likely from rounding. Either way close enough to say it‚Äôs a 50% boost at 5 addictions.
---
Still good, though I wish there was no limit to how much it stacked like in 4. 
---
For those keeping score at home, here‚Äôs how it stacks up against the other max damage boosting effects
---
* instigating: +100% (first shot only, stacks with sneak attacks)
---
* bloodied: +95% (5% health, stacks with adrenal reaction)
---
* junkie‚Äôs: +50% (5 addictions)
---
* nocturnal: +50% (midnight - 6am)
---
* beserker‚Äôs: +50% (0 DR)
---
* enemy-specific: +30% (side note: zealots stacks with prime receivers)
---
* anti-armor: +28.9% (effective increase)
---
* fire rate: +25% (effective DPS)
---
* two shot: +25% (side note: stat screen misleading on launchers)
---
* explosive: +20% (+32% w/ max rank demo expert)
---
* mutant‚Äôs: +10% (when mutated only)
---
* assassin‚Äôs: +10% (players only)
---
* hitman‚Äôs: +10% (while aiming only)
---
In my opinion junkie‚Äôs, nocturnal, and beserker‚Äôs all could benefit from being buffed to their fallout 4 levels. Bloodied is far and away the strongest effect and stacking it with adrenal reaction results in stupid damage. It also makes beserker‚Äôs pretty much irrelevant
---
That would explain it, thanks
---
Hit your right thumb stick on the chassis to view it, there should be a option to rename it. Or hit the appropriate key on PC to view the chassis details.
---
I've been there, I put a week's worth of time into a cozy brick house full of shut complete with power armor garage, fusion generator room, kitchen, water purifier plant and a guest house
---
Damn was really hoping it would because that'll would amazing. Thanks for the info
---
Yup.  Happened to me at Whitesprings a few nights ago.
---
Dont go to an event you know your going to die in, with tons of junk.......its literally your choice. "Life is tuff, its alot tuffer if your stupid" - John Wayne
---
I dunno, my endgame is just Excavator. Always need that extra capacity...
---
This has been an issue since beta for me
---
+karma thanks for stopping by.
---
Awesome! I see it. Thanks a lot!
---
Yes god please the brick looks soo good especially because it has the best windows but inside looks like a run down apartment.
---
yeah I love both the long time and temp friends in fallout - me and a friend have over 200 hours teamed and we just bump into another 2 man team go on 4 events together laughing and chatting then go our separate ways laughing and having a jolly time
---
Great suggestion. I hope they are listening.
---
I usually run solo or with a friend, I wish there was a way to set a difficulty, so my solo self or my small team would spawn more enemy's in events. It kinda sucks doing feed the people and get maybe 5 enemy's for the duration of 5 minutes.
---
Please bulldoze grass.  It hides all the smaller plants like carrots and melons and gourds and makes them hard to see
---
I doubt this is related to what you're experiencing, but some time back I caught on fire. I jumped in some water, and the fire wouldn't go away. In first person I could still see the flames flicker in front of my face on occasion, but in third person there were no flames. I don't recall if I was losing health during this time or not as I wasn't really paying attention to my health at the time. I didn't die at any point during this, so either I wasn't taking amy damage, or I was healing myself and not thinking about it. Anyway, after about 5 minutes it finally went away. I never checked my status either to see if it was any sort of effect. I know this doesn't really help your situation, but if this is similar to what you're experiencing, know that you're not alone.
---
No initiate though.  :(
---
I might be different than most. I currently have 3 or 4 thousand caps and a stash full of explody guns that are not for sale. Here's why. I put time in to get those. Hundreds of hours. Weeks and months of grinding to find those guns. They are rare, hard to aquire items. Caps are not. Whatever amount of caps you can offer, I can make on my own I can make 10,000 a week just as easily as you.. If I wanted them. I literally have no use for caps. What I do have use for is other rare, hard to aquire items that I haven't found.
---
I don't want to exchange hard to aquire items for easy to aquire items. it's not about cap limits at all.
---
Fuck me anyone complaining about legendaries being hard to get obviously never played a real looter game before.
---
Excellent info...upvoted
---
Tyvm
---
It would be nice if the power armor station had a charging port mod, so your armor could not only be left there but its core recharged.
---
Yeah this would be nice. A lot of the walls look kind of bad on the back.
---
That's a random load in glitch, had it happen myself more than a couple times.   
---
Question, does it seem worse in patch 8?
---
Without dogmeat, there is no companion.
---
Or carry more than one when the quest is active?
---
if you spend money you can equip less item maintenance perks and more offense and defense perks.that
---
Ok, will add that and see if it changes my success rate
---
I didn't really have a problem with it. I had *one* Event ruined by a guy that wanted to PvP (showed up for the Sons of Dane thing and immediately started trying to gun me down). The rest were just people trying to get the Challenge done, and 99% of the time everyone just left after it was over. I did get killed twice **after** events were done (both were "Feed the People," oddly enough), and one guy tried to kill us after a run of "The Messenger" (I fast travelled out after ducking around a building), but I got the whole Challenge done without any real issues.
---
I think the reason is that there are only so many buttons on a controller.
---
Mods don‚Äôt attach to power armor either (at least for excavator PA, they didn‚Äôt work.
---
I‚Äôm not the one throwing around some dubious qualifier to win arguments on the internet for imaginary points that mean nothing. This argument doesn‚Äôt have anything to do about me, you‚Äôre just trying to turn it into that.
---
Only one, Black Powder Rifle Bayonet is learned via scrapping
---
There are multiple threads exactly like this every single day.
---
So it's overflowing into the DMG glitch, will log and report, thanks!
---
Thanks!
---
yes or at least be able to hide ones you don't want to show
---
&gt;platform stair
---
Dont think the  platform stair i released yet, only the single stair, it's a separate item...
---
I use both the .50 Cal and Minigun and can confirm the weapon cards are full of shit. The Minigun has higher rate of fire then the .50 Cal, but uses heaps of ammo and sucks at range. The .50 Cal has far better range and is way more accurate but uses expensive ammo. The Minigun is great for ghouls, scorched and other more squishy things while the .50 Cal is better for Super Mutants and fighting the Queen.
---
Arians??? Cmonbruh
---
I mean I guess. I hate power armor but I can see it being a QOL thing for you guys. Take my upvote.
---
or Wallpaper, I can see it now, 3 Star Legendary Wallpaper
---
nobody will take them anyway
---
People MAke mistakes all the time. Gg on yours.
---
killer maybe 2-3 in 900 hrs
---
Survival should just be 100% of your level, that‚Äôs it. Or a certain max caps list on death.
---
Boik20 is GT
---
I'm RIGHT there with you! As a player of Fallout 3, NV, 4, Oblivion, Skyrim... modding is first nature to me lol I at least still have INIs to play with :P
---
But yes, I've been completely reluctant to install **any** mod, no matter how trivial it is of a change, because there hasn't been much (any) official word on where they're drawing the line. However, I completely understand their reasoning for playing it that way, because not only do you open up the floodgates to mods, but also to people in droves asking "can I use this, what about *this*, how about ***this****??*". It's easier to keep quiet to be 'fair' to everyone, and those who want to risk it... I'm sure their official response is "god speed!" lol
---
My friend would be absolutely *livid* with me if I got banned, and that is why we've both abstained from using any, despite her having found this mod and us both very much wishing to use it! :(
---
Got me
---
Good thought and Entirely possible, it's like switching weapons while reloading was a exploit used to make Dragons have the ammo capacity of a quad handmade.
---
Will play around with it some more tonight, let me know if you manage to isolate it further before I do and thanks again!
---
The Nuka Cola Paints, can't think of anything else though.
---
I think because people are seeing the updates and getting curious
---
Hmmm fire rate is the time between shots, now I'm curious and want to time the two weapons..
---
I'll give ya what, 2000 screws for the knight paint?
---
*sigh* I wtf am I supposed to do now
---
Yeah look how much people had to yell at them before they finally got rid of duping. 3 MONTHS.
---
Agreed. 
---
Though I did kind of have a thing for Cait. :)
---
The problem with that is; while most people would rather have a 'meta' 3* legendary, there is always going to be someone that wants a rolling pin and isn't memeing. 
---
So they can't weight the legendary pool towards meta drops. But at the same time; atleast if it's a guaranteed 3* it's going to be useful at the legendary loot vendor.
---
Uh, have you missed the part where you have to go into inspect items now to repair them, instead of being able to repair them on the fly at the work bench? That is evidence right there.
---
Is your PSN ID the same as your Reddit name as I am in the same boat as OP, just hit level 26 but never played Fallout before looking for some higher level people who are interested helping the lowered leveled players?
---
I can assure you that the ‚Äúyelling‚Äù in no way swayed their efforts. Again, Reddit is less than 1% of the community.
---
Happens to a bunch f quests.  It's still there,you just get no arrows nor indicators, which is a major pita,but doable.
---
Just use online resources and attempt to finish the stage your on.  
---
75% of the time it'll proceed normally but in multi stage quests like this, it can go on and happen to next leg too.
---
Yesterday Had same issue as you had
---
I dont want to sound like I'm bitching just genuinely curious lol
---
I would say making a function of the game more difficult to use is negatively impacting gameplay. That is changing something that worked fine and making it WORSE just so they can put the repair kits in.
---
There's only several posts an hour saying this since the update on tuesday.
---
Uh, are you okay?
---
I agree, I'm just thinking of reasons they wouldn't include it. The timer is iffy, since most events aren't time based to begin with.
---
I wish people would get curious about using the Search function :-)
---
But major news sites love to pick stories up from reddit. Which is why yelling on here to get them to change their screw ups works, because if they don't major news sites pick it up.
---
You need the same perk card equipped that you‚Äôd need to build that mod.  So I‚Äôm this case it would be the one for gun smithing
---
This may be misinformation but from what I‚Äôve been reading since the latest patch individual mods, you know the single time use ones that aren‚Äôt permanently learned, are again not working when being attached to the corresponding items. 
---
Sorry if that‚Äôs not completely accurate but it‚Äôs what I learned, hope this helps.
---
Good stuff. I miss the first week of survival!! It was a murder house on every server
---
It sounds like they're going to have it where you can tag items in your stash to be displayed on shelves and display type furniture. The fermenter operates in a similar way, minus the display part. So I suspect that power armor display is coming.
---
The main issue I see is that with power armor you have a nested container. When it's in your inventory you just see the frame and you have to pull it out to see inside it. That mechanic might be problematic for display purposes. In Fallout 4 it wasn't a problem because you couldn't store a frame and each frame was a discrete non - nestable container.
---
I'll have one for the friends list today as well
---
Yeah. That too.
---
But that‚Äôs not in the game. You equip and I equip perks for different situations. When I farm, I equip green thumb. When I sell, hard bargain. When I snitch, armorer and gunsmith 3 and 5. When I craft, super duper.
---
This is a function of the game. You level and gain cards. There is no function that you do not need perks to do things. Again, you‚Äôre making stuff up. The repair kits are attainable without spending money. If you loot everything like usual, you should have plenty of materials. I have hundreds of ballistic fiber, yet somehow this is ‚Äúrare‚Äù
---
Your argument is invalid. Again.
---
Ok thanks, you seem to be very knowledgeable in the sent type build so ima ask a few more questions.
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied build with 4 sent Assassin and 1 sent bolstering, I was wandering if it‚Äôs possible to take more than 2 hits from an aae combat shotgun. 
---
And does an anti armor weapon cut 50% of your 15% and 8% damage reductions
---
Does jumping reduce stagger likely hood, from the 1 test I‚Äôve done I know holding a weapon helps and was wandering if jumping would help
---
Glamour is the true end game.
---
Mostly because using 1 fusion cell for 36 shots is *wildly* better than 1 fusion cell for 12 shots. Since we can mod the mag size we need standardized per shot values to help make inventory management easier. 
---
Johnny 12 shot would need a laser rifle *at least* 3x stronger to get similar DPS, which is bananas if they're the same lvl
---
Yeah, started grinding for plans after initiate stopped dropping, believe me nobody is more disappointed than me.
---
I knew the top 3 would change. Ha!
---
I tried doing this, but my damn settlers lost them all.
---
When I left my armor in my C.A.M.P. it thought it would stay there. That's how I lost my fancy quest reward armor.
---
Thanks for posting these. I finally found my first colored uniform, a blue one, last night. Now I want almost all of them!
---
You have to take the fusion cores out!
---
Harper's Ferry, all those air conditioner-looking brown things sticking out of buildings. They were around in Fallout 4 but I don't think were containers at the time. They have coolant caps in them - LOTS. You're welcome.
---
Yep. I don't like power armour but I would totally display it i my camp somewhere!
---
It isn't like people don't know if you have junk on you when you die you will drop it. If you are dumb enough to go into an end game boss fight everyone knows you will die at multiple times carrying tons of junk that is on you, not the person looting the stuff.
---
It is literally a known part of the game, you can't act like you weren't prepared and got tricked into dropping your stuff. You just made a bad decision to go to an area you could die full of junk. Should of stashed it.
---
Yeah, I played with a team like that. Played, past tense.  Nothing you can do.  It sucks, but it's such a small fraction of players.  Most of us are nice.
---
I'm curios, show pics :}
---
I thought this today actually when I saw one
---
6k
---
holy wall of text. can we get a tl:dr?
---
Yes!  Something in pip maybe?  I agree that it is difficult to go between chats.
---
The question is, who will come out with it first, the modders or bethesda? The modders are going to be releasing the server code in a couple months and won't be charging anything.
---
Oh take that holier than tho art nonsense somewhere else.  Of course people need to repair in a long fight with a flying bullet sponge.  There is even a bench near by the Fissure Prime just for this.  My examples do stand.  And since you clearly don't have a worthwhile opinion on the matter please stay in the other room while the adults talk.
---
*insert thank you gif
---
If you upgrade your legendary non-PA armor to the max, it will be as good as, or better than, PA. The only thing non-PA armor won't do is rad resistance for nuke zones.
---
That's a wonderful idea!
---
&gt;***"Not the bees!"***
---
Has happened to me since launch, every play session. I thought it might have been related to my specific high level character but I can confirm it still happens on characters that I create now.
---
Still seeing people post about mods. Let's see if we can get this post up to the top so more people will see it before posting. Thanks
---
Tl:dr people were mean.
---
This was essentially my experience too as a first time Fallout player. Read the reviews after a Fallout veteran friend got the game and was like 'OK' sounds good. Played up to level 5 timidly based on the beginner's guides saying water and ammo is rare and level 5 is where things begin. Ran around with my buddy who wasn't really training me or propping me up so wasn't all that fun, it was total survival 101 which seemed harsh. Cue two guys in power armor helping us finish a quest we would have never finished and then bestowing on us mega ammo and nice long named weapons along with some armor and the game changed for me just like that. Rinse and repeat a few time and the game becomes most awesome. And I passed down that nice level 5 armor at the Observation Post to the next newer person. It was a good feeling. Now when I took over a workbench and was testing guns on the spawn and two 100+ guys came over and wasted me in a couple shots while I waved... That was a little lesson but understood and no foul. :) I just didn't understand that PVP was automatic as the game stated and everyone seemed so friendly...
---
Where did you get the info dc's were decreasing? Because from what I've been reading on this subreddit since the sheepsquatch patch server stability has been worse now than even back in the BETA.
---
Put them on the roof, then take down the stairs, so they cant get to them. That worked for me anyway, although Sturges would sometimes end up on a different roof, but never that one for some reason.
---
Dude sound like you had a bag experiance but you could always report him? 
---
Also workshops are PVP areas. If you want to build something beautiful just build your own CAMP. it's much safer and you can change servers  to avoid people
---
An anti-armor rolling pin is as legendary as any weapon a player crafts.
---
It's worth a buy. You have a lot of fun with it but eventually you get to my point where you've done everything numerous times and you get to just grinding it for me as a gamer at that point there's no need to play. Definitely worth to buy and you'll get your money's worth.
---
Just got it from Graham an hour ago.  He had two of them on him.
---
fuck man, that sucks. I think I've legitimately only run into like 3 people who were assholes since launch.
---
Its a known issue. The devs are aware.
---
I'm sorry to hear that, man. Some people are truly raiders, and like to tear things down just because they can. If you're on PC, and would like someone else to play with, I'd be happy to join you from time to time. Most of us are nice.
---
Marine or top notch combat does very well and if you get legendary effects so much the better
---
Why though? It literally does not matter. It's a box in a wall.
---
Just what we need, a two-shot explosive house
---
That has to be one of the BEST collections I have seen awesome job.üëç
---
thanks, looks like I will have to start my search
---
Known issue. Devs are aware.
---
Me too. PC.
---
I agree 100%.

But Bethesda envisions the loot grind as the way to keep players logged on. Only dropping 3* loot is a 66% reduction of the grind. That means that the average player will get their hands on the gear they want 3x faster and will then realize that there is nothing left to do in the game.
---
An increase in 3* drops at a 66% reduced spawn rate is the same. It only feels like you are getting better loot. This would be Bethesda's solution.
---
There is PvP armor that almost eliminates damage while they're standing still or sprinting (depending on which armor).
---
A lot more than 3k lbs using excavator armor,+ nuka black+cola nut to increase the + str bonus from it by 3, same with the alcohol version of the perk so you end up with 6x's the str from it, stack it with other food buffs like radstag steak, etc.
---
You can get quite a bit higher than 3k.
---
&gt; Pvp players dont care about the xp they will follow the caps

I was crafting in camp (you know where this is going) and was super excited that the new event popped up. Fast traveled, activated a pylon, watched my health tick down, then *all of a sudden remembered the 8 newly-stable fluorescent flux I forgot to stash*. 
---
Of course I couldn‚Äôt fast travel out (enemies nearby) so sorry teammates- I headed for the hills, ft when way out of range, stashed, ft back into event, activated another pylon, and made it just in time for the boss‚Äô final 40% of health. What a relief.
---
If I had died and dropped my flux into a nice paper bag, I would hope it wasn‚Äôt picked up, but I totally wouldn‚Äôt blame anyone who did pick it up- that stuff is fair game and I‚Äôm the one at fault for not dumping all junk before joining the fight.
---
Maybe I just wanted slightly more depth, like the Fallout of yore.

Its actually been 9 million.
---
You equip perks for different situations OR you pay money to not need to equip perks that make your weapons degrade slower.
---
Yeah this seems to be the case. Honestly this is the first time I've been frustrated at FO76 for a long time. I farm Watoga nonstop, it's basically the main thing I do. I don't mind putting in the time and effort because it yields consistent results. This feels like Bethesda punishing those who are willing to grind as opposed to duping or something like that. Really, really frustrating.
---
you can just kill your own brahmin and trade 1 steel + 1 razorgrain for 80% chance of brahmin steak
---
Nukapedia? It's a open wiki, should have access to anyone to edit accounts. I wasn't sure how restrictive it was so I booted my old fandom account I've been adding garbage for the past 2 weeks without much conflict.
---
It‚Äôs happening all over the place. Watoga I‚Äôve had 3 bots disappear (and no they don‚Äôt blow up and couldn‚Äôt find them).
---
Inside Fort Definace it‚Äôs non stop disappearing of ghouls and especially legendary.
---
Lost 1 three star on a Gulper horde that disappeared after killing near 15 of those POS.
---
I have the opposite with my PA. I tried to craft blue headlamp with plan and it wouldn't work. Attached the standard light by mod and it did (at least it ate the mod item). Trying to add sacrificial blade to a machete by mod doesn't work though.
---
Splendid news! Will load both later then :)
---
Yeah I would too, it really wouldn't be hard to add something more as is. I wasn't saying it's a bad idea, just if they didn't actually add anything extra it would be just another hole in a wall in a different area of the map.
---
OP; is the item you're trying to mod "over" repaired by any chance?
---
This is the truest post to a new fallout 76 player‚Äôs experience

Cap pools reset 20 hours after the first transaction.  This means you can get 6 pools every 5 days best case. ? Right?  Better than once a day for me.
---

I like it because now I can play with my 2 older characters who have tons of caps on them instead of my new one who never goes above 100. It also means I could spend caps on placing bounties now. Sure the rewards are less, and I hope they can add rewards for actually being in the top 3 and staying on the same server longer, but my reward personally comes from actually winning my fights with my new guy vs a bunch of lvl 200s with explosive shotguns. Just how I feel.
---
I'd like to be able to toggle it off or on somehow as an option for my CAMP.  I liked my tall grass and bushes and used them to hide floating stuff on hillsides, but I understand why people like the bulldozing too.
---
From my experience, when this happens, the body usually teleports back to where the enemy originally spawned. If you know where that is, you still have a chance to get your loot.
---
So it's not really despawning - it is 'only' teleporting.
---
yes it is just a raider symbol it's at a lot of raider camps....to me it looks like the Klingon symbol
---
Heh, I mean, you're not wrong. üòÖ

As I said I am aware of that and there counters and used the counters to that armor

---
Actually they are the most pure form of pvp players. They use pvp to continue pvping, other players caps pay for ammo and gear upgrades. Farming players instead of farming in pve. Kinda like survival was before they made killing players in adventure more lucrative.
---
Not in front of my PC right now but I believe they are actually.  You think that has something to do with the bug?
---
I've noticed this myself. If I play consecutive nights my Lego drops are usually trash. If I'm off for a week+ they seem to be much better and I find legendary enemies EVERYWHERE rather than just the common farm spots.
---
Paragraphs maybe.
---
Your camp is close to a spot that generates cryptids. I assume you get assaulted by mothmans very often as well.
---
&gt; I don't understand why bethesda didn't do that, they're pushing PVP down our throats left right and center, but some sack of shit can walk up, steal all your shit if you drop everything from a farming run to do one of their stupidly rare end game events, with zero consequences? 
---
Because that is how ALL online games work with dropped items on death. If you die and drop things they are free for anyone to take if they get to it before you. This isn't some "new" way to play online games. Runescape even had this 15 years ago and still does, no one whines about that.
---
How about get better at the game and don't die so often, or stash your junk in your stash more.
---
I go into places all the time that I know is gonna kill me, but I put all my junk in my stash before going anywhere I think I could possibly be killed. 
---
You just need to stash your junk more, go to less dangerous places, or get better at the game. Because dropping items on death for anyone to grab is an EXTREMELY common part of dying in an online game, it helps make death something you want to actively avoid instead of not caring about.
---
I am having the same problem on XB1. And same power armor.
---
What‚Äôs the best choice then?
---
The armor is soooo bad comparatively though. 
---
Is an extra 100 lbs really worth it?
---
I'm not sure, just a guess. I have a overrepaired machete that I cannot place a mod item on and had a normal repaired PA head that I could place a mod item on but NOT mod by a learned plan.
---
I‚Äôm also on XB1, just spent a fair amount of caps on the mods so I am hoping someone knows a fix.
---
Pls look around there alot of posts about this problem.
---
Yeah, I didn't read the body text. Sorry.
---
From what I have been able to gather the only for that are currently available are the radstag, owlet, wolf, and Yao guai. 
---
People originally speculated that you got them from the cryptid event the based upon the posts I have reviewed no additional plans have dropped. 
---
I do believe there is a side quest for the picnic blanket plans though.
---
I had warehouses! Spare frames in one building, on the metal see through floor and lit from underneath. Then one of each core type on display in a separate building, and finally the suit I used in my ‚Äúhouse‚Äù
---
Power Patcher is going to be your best bet for maintaining PA. I have it fully ranked up and I rarely need to repair my PA.
---
I believe I read that the fridge idea has or is being discussed.  Would be a good way to keep your food items from spoiling.
---

---
Huh, never realized. Surprised I didn‚Äôt come across any considering I‚Äôve been looking up this glitch for awhile now.
---
Character movements are significantly smoother as well... much better game dynamic, and this opinion coming from someone who also ran PA exclusively up to about level 35. (FWIW 184 atm)
---
It's not only Uranium Fever, I remember having to take down hordes of Super Mutants (8+) on Guided Meditation. Now it's about 2-6? and a Mutant Hound. 
---
Guess this is from the data they were getting about people not doing events as much?
---
Two different games. One loads data over the net. Are you wired or wireless? What's your network speed?  Probably more going on in FO76 as well.
---
He obviously can't read/comprehend or something and you want to talk to him about punctuation??...lol.
---
I like this idea a lot actually. And Mr Handy gardeners pulling weeds or spraying herbicides along with them
---
Ok sorry
---
Stash it before auto-scrapping if it's such a problem. Easy fix!
---
I had probably 75 sets of PA in FO4 in a warehouse I built specifically for the suits. This should be allowed when they give us the option to decorate with stuff from our stash.
---
What makes you think that this isn't already coming with the decoration update?
---
hmm... don't know why, but when i read this my mind reads it like "Free candy", lol
---
On top of all this, recently sometimes I Go to place and...nothing. No error, no green/red, no reason from the game at all. I can't do anything and have to exit and reenter build mode for it to even respond to me.
---
Well, your playing just above the minimum specs for everything but your CPU, so there's that. If I had to guess the bottle neck would be your ram and video card.
---
It would have been nice if the mods could have stickied a post warning about mods not working.
---
Wait a sec, what if they broke this sub's mods too with the latest patch? :P
---
Sillyness aside there are like 4 posts every hour about mods not working...
---
God yes. 
---
Spent ages trying to make a simple gantry pathway so I can connect one building to a staircase to the house above. Mostly to collect water from said gantry and not get irradiated. Simples. Can I do this? Nah. 
---
Then; check Reddit and someone‚Äôs built a fucking shopping center with curved walls somehow!
---
My internet speed is 80Mbit and im playing wired.

---
I'm not so sure. I think they're doing this vendor for their benefit and not ours. This isn't so we can get better items. This is so we can destroy 3 items with a chance at a better rolled 1 item. 
---
Every time someone deals with this future vendor it's -2 legendary items their servers need to track and load. I'm assuming legendary items being much more a burden to track with all the variables to them (rather than simple identical junk/aid items). I would guess they'd be all for us spamming trades to delete these hoarded lego's.
---
It's all good. I'm just really curious as to how lol
---
Hell ya!  Toasty and Mama
---
I was after the other one obviously, and in survival even a level 7 can take me down in few shots ;)
---
For me, Uranium Fever is the best steel farming event in the game. The enemies still seem to spawn, but when they do, they seem to stay contained to one room lately. It's odd. Instead of spawning over time all the enemies seem to spawn at once.
---
There are a lot of times where Ill be on long trips, maybe into a nuke zone for example, and i dont remember what i have in my inventory, so I agree it shouldn't be auto scrapped.
---
Yeah I'm getting some sarcasm vibes
---
I hardcore agree with the second paragraph.
---
No, they're the half-assed PvPers, unwilling to actually use resources to PvP.
---
Yes! [I asked the same question a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anvoxn/glitched_power_armor_xb1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app). Drop the armor as suggested and reclaim. Worked for me.
---
When you log in, exit your power armor, then remove all the armor from the frame, then get back into your power armor frame, open your inventory, and re-equip all your power pieces. This will restore the 60/60/60 defensive modifiers the frame is missing.

FO76 is still GPU led. You've probably maxed out your GPU memory. FO4 is 3 years old. Are you 1080p?
---
Noone buying them should be a hint. 1 cap/round is crazy for 10mm.
---
It do be like that sometimes
---
Yes. If you have the Nuclear Keycode and go to launch the nuke you can just put the solved code in.
---
Yeah, 1080p.
---
How‚Äôd you manage to get them all placed perfectly in 2 minutes, AND have time to set up the shot?!?
---
It's so much fun. Get it.
---
If I care about not scrapping something specific, I put in in my stash. If they add a system to tag specific junk items so they wouldn't be subject to this, that would be great!
---
With digested goo, I use it for adhesive so I would prefer if it was auto scrapped. Appealing to the minority isn't good for MMO's, changes should benefit everyone equally.
---
I have encountered this as well. My buddy and I killed a guy and then he proceeded to chase us all over the map trying to kill us (no caps/aid/junk). We each killed him probably 30 times in self defense as we were trying to complete events and then my buddy suddenly started dealing zero damage and could not hurt him at all. It has happened one time since.
---
yes, [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
So I just bought the plan resort planters. What is this?
---
Indeed, you don't need the codes if they've already been decrypted.
---
I've never personally acquired all 8, always just reference the online source cause they seem to get it out there before I ever could crack the code myself
---
Yes but I just figure those have been exposed to some toxic sludge or something and can cause a disease in you if they get in contact. The sheepbot has no biological systems to be affected by a syringer dart full of chems so it shouldn't be affected at all.
---
Yes!
---
I still get issues/stuttering on a 1070ti. It's poorly optimised.
---
It's not just the robots they changed but also the three stars that spawn in different locations in watoga. Actually I'm uninstalling the game today because the game is totally boring to me outside of grinding for three star weapons and armor. It's almost like Bethesda says it doesn't want you to play the game and have fun. That's fine because Days Gone is coming out soon and I'll be forgetting all about Fallout for a couple months
---
That's been there since and is probably the thing I hate most in the game. So loud, so pointless, so full of mole rats.
---
This is exactly the reason why I don't do stuff like this. I commend you on being the type of person who is willing to help. Lord knows this game needs more of you, but this is why I don't bother. I try to help others when I can, but usually in the form of donations or help with a quest. When I do take over a workshop, it's typically for only one of the resources (such as Lake Side Cabins for the lead), and I put up some turrets to defend it from mob enemies, a workbench to scrap at, and a stash box. If someone comes to try and take it over, I usually just leave the server or I let them have it and continue on doing something else. I've begun to notice that most players will leave a workshop alone when someone has claimed it, and the players who do contest a workshop just do it  because they have a build they're playing and wanna show off, they have active cheats, or they just want to fight. Basically they just to ruin someone else's fun. It's not worth my time and effort to blow through ammo on somebody doing that.
---
Again, I commend you on being one of the good guys. I hope this hasn't ruined your FO76 gaming experience and that you continue to be one of the good guys. I'm sorry this had to happen to you, but as they say bad things tend to happen to the nicest people. Seeing as how there are numerous servers on which to play, the chances of that guy finding you on again are very slim. If you have him blocked (assuming you're on console) he won't be able to join your game from your Gamercard, so that's a plus. If you're on PC though, I'm not sure how that works. Either way, good luck in your future endeavors and don't let this get you down. You're one of thr good guys. Stay the way you are ‚ò∫

I just barely made the cut and only got this 1 picture. Throughout collecting I've gotten pretty fast at placing them back to back. And renaming did all the sorting for me
---
Why not give all lv's a nukashine just before you use the recall card ? they would be all over the map before the event begins, lol :D
---
What was a pain is he was half my level and I was losing so many caps lol
---
If your not buying don't bother commenting
---
Hell could even make the suits rentable by visiting players. Set your price in caps per hour or something. Have the suits last even if you log out.  Then when thier hour or core is up they exit and it disappears. Suit could be rented by multiple sources simultaneously. Make caps with suits your not using. Atom cats 4 ever &lt;3
---
This post is very triggering. D:&lt;

Stash your crap. Game on.

---
I forget which item has ultracite in it, but i dont use the actual item, i scrap it. However, there have been times where ill need that item for its use. I think items that have multiple uses shouldn't be auto scrapped
---
Whole lot of whiners lately. For all the wrong reasons.
---
Yes since the update. Kinda jarring.
---
If you‚Äôre not offering sensible prices don‚Äôt bother selling
---
They've nerfed more than just Watoga. 
---
Whitesprings, West Tek, AWOL Event (2 times with NO legendary spawn), Horde Events (my last 2 had crowned enemies rather than a lego boss), YaoGui spawn north of reenactment map point.
---
Everytime people find a spot they like Beth kills it. It's egomania to make changes to prevent our playstyles because it wasn't THEIR intent.
---
I'm on PC and this happens to me, but only (now) in very specific circumstances. Prior to Patch 8 it was in SBQ fights, but now it's also in Sheepsquatch event fights. 
---
Before patch.... 6.5? It was only if I tried to visit Charleston, and a small random area in the middle of the Ash Heap along the main road. I think I only participated in 2 SBQ fights back then, and no issue at all back then. After patch 6.5 or 7 (whichever it was), I can now visit Charleston issue free, so that's been nice.
---
The freezing though, makes life difficult since it's these two end-game events lol It used to be super brief, but I did have to avoid Charleston completely...  
---
**Charleston-era** longest was probably 2 minutes, but it was usually back-to-back so I couldn't even TP away, and sometimes would never recover *(actual hard-freeze, and couldn't properly alt-tab to Task Manager, having to navigate it blind to end-task)*.   
---
**SBQ**, things are fine for quite awhile but eventually super-short freezes occur (5-10sec) but not back-to-back, then starts to creep up to 30sec duration or a couple back-to-back short duration freezes, then they'll last a couple mins. Longest during Patch 7 and 7.5 was probably around 7min before resuming and then being disconnected...  
---
**Immitation Sheepsquatch** is similar to SBQ where it starts out fine, however things progress far more rapidly here! The short freezes happen sooner, the change to longer happens quicker, and the debilitating long-term freezes come soon after. I reached and all-time-high duration two days ago at this event... Roughly ***25minutes******!*** However.... it DID recover (I started surfing the 76 sub on my laptop). Oddest of all, it didn't disconnect me after! I had actually just died when it occurred and the "Respawn in 2 sec..." was on screen, so when I returned I was spawned and then the game proceeded to play out the text events (activate pylons, pylon active, rinse repeat a few times), and then it showed the event was completed, I received my rewards, and no one had even touched my lunch bag so I was able to recover that! (Unfortunately the sheepsquatch assaultron had despawned, so I wasn't able to get a legendary reward off it.)
---
Overall and otherwise, with Patch 8 the game actually performs better than it has in quite a few months (been playing since Dec 4th), so I'm very happy about that aspect! Makes the game more enjoyable and less immersion breaking since framerates and micro-stutter are almost entirely gone once again. At least until I participate in either of these events ;)
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Every time it‚Äôs happened to me, I‚Äôve been lucky enough to find the goo pile after about 5-10 mins.

You are definitely limiting yourself with the GPU. And you probably need more ram too. I hover above 10gb oh ram usage while playing. Another stick of 8gb is a cheap upgrade. I can‚Äôt even do my job with only 8gb of ram because Chrome eats up so much ram...
---
Low CPU usage and high GPU usage definitely indicated a GPU bottleneck. What‚Äôs probably limiting you is the 4gb of ram on our GPU. I know FO76 maxes out my 6gb on my 980 ti. 
---
I have a 4790k CPU, 980 ti, 32gb ram, and a standard HD and get ~80 FPS on 1440p. I‚Äôve been meaning to upgrade to a SSD for ages, just haven‚Äôt, but I know my GPU is my bottleneck.

Also, having to Rene each piece of armor on the chassis is NOT helpful. Let us name the chassis

If your trash isn't selling on the trade subs don't bring it to a non-trade sub hoping you'll get naive views that may buy.
---
Unless you don't  work with it much and don't realize it will autoscrap. Will I be careful now? Of course. It doesn't change the fact that this should be fixed to help new players.
---
I rarely craft psycho, it was for a challenge. I loot more than enough of the stuff without trying.
---
PA will always have an advantage in some situations especially when it comes to rad damage. BOS combat armor can take a beating but if fighting high level ghouls it's the rads that will get you, same with Scorchbeasts. Other than that I prefer non-PA. The right gear will stop you being too squishy and gives far more scope for variety than PA.

Death is the treat silly.

I‚Äôm extremely unlucky; I found my first explosive weapon (SMG) at lvl 168-not even a 2-shot. Second weapon (Single action .44 revolver), also not a 2-shot, I bought from vendor in Watoga. I game Watoga, White Springs, Uranium Fever, got max caps, etc. Just UNLUCKY.
---
You could research some melee builds as they tend to be the most broken.
---
How do you double walls!?

I had left it alone. I replied to your post with constructive information with the assumption you didn't know. Then you made a snarky reply drawing one from me as well.

You don‚Äôt farm Xp?
---
"Roger! Have you been tweaking my .iNI files?"
---
No, you need Animal friend for somethings, and Wasteland whisperer for other things. You'll either get the prompt to tame, or you wont.  You can pacify most things, but taming is only possible on random creatures that are at least half your level. 
---
I attempt it on every animal I see, and rarely do I get the Tame option. I've gotten 1 deathclaw in over 600 hours. Her name was Steve, and my neighbor killed her for agroing constantly. Then she came back, then she was killed again, then she came back, then she was killed again, then she disappeared forever. RIP Steve.

No, but I can not use a leather dense mod I got. Same thing?

I use the wood walls for the interior of my brick house. But I wish it could all be brick.
---
Watoga robots go peaceful after quest. It was never meant to be a farming spot, it's pretty dumb to conplain about it.
---
Guess we will just have to agree to disagree. I have found zero risk pvp is boring and dominated by bad pvp players. With no significant penalty it's just zerging. The same guys you just killed endlessly running back at you after you kill them. They have no reason to use strategy or tactics because there is no need for them to.

Every item that is used in a craft should be skipped.  Many are.  But as they expand they miss/skip things.

---
It's a beta, they're adjusting it as they go. The caps lost was too high, now it's too low. Hopefully they'll just choose a set amount for players over 50. But I still don't understand the rationale behind charging people based on levels when their cap limit doesn't increase after level 50.
---
I've seen the Mothman three times and the Flatwoods Monster only once in 150 hours.
---
Ran it last night, 3 of us, all 150+. 12 miners spawned four times, with three management personnel.
---
I've also seen the behavior described above, however that was last  week.
---
Yeah, it's saved me a few times.
---
YES
---
That‚Äôs just insane

It seems to pop up every time I equip a legendary weapon..

I'm high level and still need help in that event. Jetpack mod has saved me when the evil sheep focuses on me.
---
Time for a GPU upgrade. 1660/1660 Ti would do you well.
---
I run F76 in 1440p w/ a 1660 (backup card while my 2080 Ti is ripperoni). Textures: Ultra. Water: high. Lighting: high. Shadow quality: medium. Shadow distance: medium. Actor, item, object, and grass fade set to max.
---
Generally 60fps+ with some occasional oddities near max budget camps. (But that happened even with my 2080 Ti seeing huge dips in heavily worked on camps)
---
Would recommend finding a 1660 or 1660 Ti with a proper finned heatsink rather than a solid aluminum chunk with fins for better temps.
---
The only time I've ever seen the teleport to player button not be there, either I was over overburdened or there was enemies around.
---
It's a random encounter. Easiest way to find one is fast travel to the relay tower near Flatwoods and start following the road back to town until yoi see a house on the left. A random will spawn outside. If it's not the reenactor server hop and try again.
---
1) "Mayor for a Day" is not a required quest.
---
2) It's a literal warzone and the last major city before the final fight of the game.
---
3) Unless you possess insider game development knowledge that I don't have, I'm not sure what credibility you use to justify the claim as to what Watoga was or was not "meant" to be.
---
4) Being frustrated at losing the location that I and many others have spent months farming and building legitimate vendor businesses off of is quite rational. The only way someone could label it a "dumb" complaint is if they were a troll or a complete simpleton.

Also kids, remember, apply lightweight perks to stashed armor that you're not using, takes less space in the box. :D
---
2 shadowed legs would be good. How much?
---
I'm not online now until tomorrow though.
---
Had this experience today in a pve battle at blackwater mine with a rad rat, tried every single weapon from explosive to melee, no damage whatsoever.
---
Sorry, just seen 150 caps each.
---
Agreed, and esc should always return you to game in one click (panic button if you're in menus).
---
But isn't modding forbidden?
---
Same thing happening at the Peninitary up north. Only since the latest patch.
---
pebkac city itt
---
building is a skill. Get better at it.
---
awesome.  heading home now.  i'll be online in about 45min.. are you on?
---
That quest has been there the whole time. 
---
You can't posts pics, you have to post the link of the image.
---
Thanks‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Yea that‚Äôs fine I‚Äôll hold on to them lol I have a ton of stuff and yes 150 bud
---
Kind of. The diseased pre fix seems to go over 'legendary'. So you can't tell until it drops gear.
---
I totally understand and thanks for your willingness to help. I'll be on later this evening about 8 CST - I'll check to see if you're around - thanks again!
---
1/2 my house is clipped in to a hill and floating and that's fine, but god forbid I be able to build stairs to access my second floor, on flat ground, in an open area üò≠ the mental gymnastics you have to do to make that make sense would earn u a gold medal
---
I think this may apply to not being able to attach weapon mods. That's also an issue right now. Same process, so I assume this is what's happening. Hang in there. üëç
---
I have not, but with my luck that sounds like a blessing.
---
I have a combat shotgun like that. Great weapon.
---
You mean 7?
---
I don‚Äôt think I will ever bother to login to Survival, I just like playing solo, if I get attacked now I just die and jump server. Easier that way.
---
I'd be interested in the headwear piece. Do you have the mascot version or white wolf fedora?
---
Modders cannot get the servers running. By that i mean it will be impossible for them to do.
---
There is a huge difference between changing textures and moddifying some papyrus scripts versus creating a multiplayer engine that has all the f(x)ality as the current server engine.
---
Ugh I know, this needs to be a thing **yesterday**.  I keep spawning under roads with literally no escape, so have to fast travel again and hope the game picks a new spot.  Just use the system that literally existed in FO4.
---
Tyvm, glad you liked it üòä
---
And not as for no the no deaths thing I‚Äôm very careful sniper dude, and I don‚Äôt PvP much so small sample size
---
7k is respectable, 34k is someone with no family, no job, and no life.
---
Preach.
---
For a 1*? You smoking crack lol
---
Starting to.
---
I spent alot of time building camps
---
That's against TOS
---
yeah I started noticing this during the Unsolved quests and just assumed it was part of them? (I thought it was to imply that smth was stalking/lurking and killing enemies or something) but now it just keeps happening at random
---
Its a daily quest called "Falsely Accused "
---
I hope you get banned.
---
Bloodied melee with unyielding and mutations. My 1* bloody grognaks does 1300 per swing and my bloodied bowie does around 300 per stab and i could do 1300 in like 6 seconds with that
---
What? We aren't creating it from scratch, were reverse engineering it. Just like how it was done with WoW or any of the numerous other MMO's that got private servers.
---
Could call it a Groundskeeper Protectron! And Mr. Gardeners.
---
How do I build that? Do you have a photo of your perk cards that you use?
---
Look up lady Janet‚Äôs soft serve surprise on youtube I have a video showing that area can spawn both the vendor bot and the cwr in close proximity

I have a 3\* TSE Lever. What items to trade?
---
I think I managed to mod some weapons, but applying mods that I bought doesn't seems to work now...

If you can not afford bad luck for yourself, I can certainly follow someone who is interested in the deal, I do not need guys like you commenting
---
Just go somewhere more legitimate. It's not hard.

Ya, I've seen that this last week as well. It seems like any location that lots of players are at simultaneously the connections get bad. SBG, BAA, Whitesprings nukes, fashnact parade etc.

I'ma PS4 loser üòÇüòÇ
---
I have noticed that since the last patch when I die I just need to pop one of the chem I was previously addicted to and I will become addicted again. Sometimes I respawn with the additions still too.
---
Are you on PC? Definitely agree on PC it's got worst. Someone on PS4 had to do a full reinstall just to play the game for more than 30 seconds
---
yep - same for me, but every few days, while i'm waiting for vendor caps reset. thankfully you can sell or your spare crap at once now. Makes buying serums a nice alternative.
---
why
---
Same thing with stashed weapons. If they have the ammo or you leave some in the stash they could take it.
---
oh Brudda! i soooo know that paaaaiiiiinnnnnn!
---
You know who spawns in on roof tops? Synths.
---
this is the only bug I want from Bethesda :D ba dum tsss
---
What you are trying to do is against TOS. It has nothing to do with how much money someone has. You are asking other people to break TOS with you, and risking a ban themselves. You are an asshole and I hope you get banned for this.
---
Nah PS4. It's been good tonight, but I spent 4 hrs making a new camp in the middle of no where. So nothing taxing I guess. Although the server I was originally shutdown for maintenance!
---
I have two level 110 characters. I have NEVER even seen a two shot explosive (TSE) legendary. Pretty sure I have been killed by them them though....
---
The last 3 days have been unplayable
---
Yeah, this game isn't CPU intensive at all I run it at 3440x1440 with a 10 year old cpu. My build is a AMD phenom x4 955 BE OC'ed to 4.5ghz, 16gig ram, and GTX 980.
---
The biggest bottleneck you will run into on this game is your GPU performance.
---
I want that TSE 50!
---
I missed the entire area early on, and finally found it from a random encounter (and that guy's holotape is so damn good, too). But then it was a huge disappointment finding it.
---
Mines kinda hodge podged to suit my needs but its still a bloody build. Hang on lemmie grab a screenshot
---
Yeah, this game barely uses the CPU at all, my pc has a 10 year old CPU in it and I run it at 3440x1440 without issue on it because I have a newer GPU.
---
Reverse engineering what? You most likely won't get the binary for private servers. 
---
You'd get to change things sure. Thru the Creation Kit.
---
Im level 270 using 5x Sentinel and 5x assassin. I got annihilated by a level 32. This made me stop caring about pvp entirely.

Its funny you think the same people that add items to camps in Fallout 76 are the same people that would be working on Fallout New Vegas for the switch.
---
Reported for rude comment, basic ppl like yourself allways do the same, yup internet is aweosome gor cowards like you, I never talked about real money, you suposed that, I just say there are many forms of deals
---
But have you considered that I am entitled to legendary weapons and outfits of my choosing? /s
---
RIP stash space.
---
I like how in these posts, they always end with "I love the game". Complaining is fine when you bring up a valid point. No need to justify yourself. If someone gets triggered by your complaints, it's their problem.
---
Reverse engineering what the server sends the game when the client sends certain packets. Then you can make a server yourself that mimics the exact way the beth servers react only with the ability modify them.
---
Best option is to start a new toon. Perception builds are only useful for rifles, while strength builds are useful for all melee weapons, heavy weapons, and shotguns.
---
That's how I feel guy :)
---
Yeah pvp is a shit show right now
---
What platform you on
---
Thank you! What mutations should I go for? I have never used mutations so I‚Äôm not sure how that works.
---
PS4
---
Lmfao.
---
good luck reverse engineering the Id tech network stack.
---
Ive managed to play for many hours, just lots of inconvenient crashes along the way.
---
Ohh that makes sense, thanks
---
Thank you, I was so confused lol
---
That‚Äôs terrible unlucky, or maybe I‚Äôm lucky. I have two level 60 characters and found a TSE SMG the other day, but that‚Äôs the only one I have seen. Most of the TSE weapons are all illegitimate
---
Ok thank you :)
---
For me? Yes
---
i‚Äôll join in. i don‚Äôt have mic rn tho
---
Add me im on now The_stoney_vibes its easier to talk rathet than text
---
Don't need to, all we need to do is trick the client into thinking the packets they are getting back is from the server. 
---
People said the same thing about WoW servers never being reverse engineered. You could always come join us on the nexus discord where we are working on it if you think its impossible.
---
:)
---
Makes me wonder if there's a buffer overflow issue going on here. Like, there's a list of weapons, with drills at the bottom, and the legendary list is *supposed* to start well above where the drills are... but an error is causing the list to wrap around and keep drills in the loot pool. Or cause your roll to underrun and go "below" where it should in the list.
---
This deserves more upvotes.
---
Plus i can send you the screenshots in game so i dont have to do the imgur shit
---
Yeah we really need fast travel mats. The only current way to fix this is by moving your C.A.M.P. module.
---
Pretty much every build is op if you spec correctly and the correct equipment. Look up Captain noob on YouTube, he does weapon reviews and has 3 characters and most builds showcased in the videos he does :)
---
You can still make this a mod and put it on the FO76 mod nexus.
---
Don't forget that every structural piece has to snap to a perfect 5ish-foot grid.
---
def not new
---
Yea that‚Äôs happened to me too but it‚Äôs a bit inconsistent...I‚Äôve yet to respawn and keep my addictions though
---
There are some aholes. No online game us without... i feel before they adjusted the cap loss/reward on survival it split them out rather well... now u get/lose fewer caps so they r all back in adventure....
---
Oooh surprise cake!
---
And yet I can use a .44 in PA?  [https://i.imgur.com/4DB5D49.png](https://i.imgur.com/4DB5D49.png)
---
Nice isn't it? When you absolutely positively have to kill every mother in the room.
---
We have a CAMP budget, it shouldn't matter if we place a PA model in there or not.
---
I recommend this be a robobrain so he can have witty personality + has treads already installed.
---
or.. maybe just paint. That way the base can still be wood/concrete/metal so we aren't listening to pay to win arguments. It would allow you to paint the inside  and outside of a wall.
---
also royal jelly for food, blood sac for skito spit, (also make it drop from enemies ffs) and a lot more
---
I eat it when desperate enough. Only meat though cause I run carnivore. Just easier than swapping in cannibal and eating the dead.
---
Yeah one of my buddies lost his newly earned Excavator armor to some troll who stole it once he put it on the stand.
---
Yeah I killed a 3 star glowing deathclaw the other day while doing side quests from the new patch. It collapsed down after a couple hundred rounds from my two-shot Gatling Gun only to glitch into the ground and vanish before I can loot it.
---
Is there a chance to get all the different colours in that asylum? If so I need to start farming them.
---
Yes.
---
Some jump glitch.  Some guy was doing it in survival yesterday and literally 8 people ganged up on him until he left.  You can kill them, it's a matter of resetting the glitch he's abusing.. not sure how exactly, but basically we didn't give him any room to breathe and eventually once he was dead we kept him from doing the "jump glitch"   team work is your best bet when dealing with a cheater ;)
---
If you're on PC, I *cannot* stress how good /u/Vernon_Trier's [ACME - Assorted Camp Modifications Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/253) mod will make your brick walls look (there are also textures for ceiling/floor/window beams and plywood). Lots of choices, and they're all great. He also has a separate mod for clean plaster wall textures, if you're into the vanilla look.
---
Here's a video tour of my CAMP with them, as well as his textures for the Dark Wood Laminate Floors.

Swapping between my weapons resets my ammo count to fully loaded. Give that a try instead of reloading, maybe it'll work for you, too?
---
Can we please have this already?
---
YESSSSSS
---
There is one grain of truth to your whole post there:  
---
Taking in a large quantity of poor immigrants in a short period of time will place a burden on their government's economy in the short to mid term.
---
&gt; The socialist system that allows the ruling class to steal the wealth from everyone.
---
That happens under any government system with a lack of oversight and transparency, where any one person or agency has too much power which does not have proper checks and balances in place to prevent such problems.  We have our own share of corruption and war profiteering here in the US, it's just that we were more able to absorb the cost/burden of that as we were an enormously wealthy country.  Things like a 6 billion dollar no bid classified contract given to a company by a Vice President that used to *run that company* and *still owns large amounts of shares in that company*, are relatively small compared to the US's GDP of almost $16 trillion.  
---
According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report published in October 2007, the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could cost taxpayers a total of $2.4 trillion by 2017 - thats a cost of almost $8 thousand per every man, woman, and child in the US.
---
Weapons and armor are tricky. It depends on the type (leather/robot/trapper/pistol/rifle/hammer/etc) greatly. 
---
I've sold an AA pistol for 1500, but an AA handmade I sold for 750. Also depends on the buyer. 
---
Chems and such are much easier. Lol. Standard stim packs I sell consistently at 10c each.  Highest I sold them for was 15c. Bobbleheads I've sold for 50c, magazines for the same. Some maps are as low as 20c and upwards of 75. 
---
The best advice I can probably give: check out the trade area. Search for what you have and see what others sold/tried to sell for. 
---
If your search has results where the seller said 10k! And there are no replies, chances are that is too high. Same item with a 2k or 3k tag with a couple replies on it? Chances are that is more of a fair price. Hope that sorta helps at least.
---
I‚Äôve seen people sell it for 10k lol but all good.
---
Haha I appreciate that! So the amount of AP consumed by Dodgy isn't even close to compensated for by Kinetic Dynamo, then? Time to go back to the buildcrafting table!
---
I will be in in a hour. 
---
Psn is yellowoptimist
---
That‚Äôs the most helpful thing I‚Äôve read, thank you so much
---
If on ps4 I'll by all nonforest maps at 50 caps each
---
As far as I know there are no official modding tools for 76, so it would really just be replacing the tracks individually for the existing station rather than adding it separately. Not 100% sure if people would be down for that, but I'm sure that's possible.
---
Will look him up!
---
You can use the same modding tools from FO4 they work on fo76 as well because under the hood they are the same game. That is why some fo4 mods even work on fo76 without changing them at all.
---
The problem with Fallout 76 is that there are games that do what it tries to do better. Survival game? Go for subnautica/the forest/dying light. RPG? Go for the older fallouts/elder scrolls/witcher 3/etc . If you have exhausted your options and want to play another survival/rpg game and want it to be fallout, only then would fallout 76 truly be worth it. While the game is getting better, the devs have shown bouts of incompetence time and time again as every update is two steps forward one step back. At this pace, it will take a very long time for it to reach a near-complete product. At the moment, the end-game is still underwhelming. There are also parts of updates that keep getting postponed (player-vending was supposed to already be in the game but was delayed by a quite a long time). Sooo yeah.
---
LOL and the cloaking device comes in the form of a 3\* legendary cloaking generator from the Atomic Shop xD
---
He also kills a scorchbeast with a pipe pistol to prove the build is the most important thing not the weapons or legendary effects  :)
---
No idea. Maaaaaaybe when the prestige system gets implemented, but don't get your hopes up.
---
Nope, can't yet.  They haven't given a date as to when.
---
I have this problem with voice in general in the game. Whenever people use the in-game voice chat it feels like they're at 25% volume, and I struggle to hear them (even when my slider is at 100%).
---
Yupppp agreed I want lighted power armor displays back
---
I just build my base separate from my settlers like red rocket or wherever I feel like it.
---
I'm running a full T-60 lvl 50 set, and honestly it's not much behind the X-01 and Ultracite in terms of protection. The biggest reason is aesthetic: I just prefer the design of the T-60 to the other armors. Plus it's dirt cheap to repair compared to the others. And there's a chance to find pieces in the field if something breaks, since T-60 is common at higher levels over the other types.
---
Having static power armor containers I think would be cool, so I could display the Excavator and Ultracite armors I have that are just taking up space. I don't want to add any overhead to the servers, though. It's already enough of a mess in the endgame. Silo repair is broken often, queen battles crash often, tons of camp issues.
---
Armor plans pop up at harpers ferry in the display cabinets . Got my full marine set server hopping
---
Haha no, as it would be impossible to look any dumber than you on this thread.
---
&gt;  I agree with you, there should be a world with no pvp period, so the people that dont want any pvp and be safe and enjoy themselves
---
It might be too little too late at this point, at least for me. And it's not just the PVP stuff. 
---
There was something about the new event contained in this latest DLC that just really infuriated me.   It really felt like the last straw for me. I haven't logged on to the game since completing it.
---
Alright, very co. Thank you!
---
Nah I am not Ps4 sadly thanks tho
---
Thats what I am hoping but I don‚Äôt want to hope too much
---
Get a homing missile launcher (bunker buster)
---
Three missiles will more or less destroy all the engines, and can be done easily at any range.
---
Alternatively spam an auto shotgun into the sky. You don't need to deal damage for the cripple skill to proc, or to draw aggro.
---
Or or maybe consider for a moment the loot system needs help
---
It really seems like you do a lot of damage up until he has a sliver of HP left, then he just becomes invulnerable.  I can't think of a mechanic that would do that.
---
Also, the fact that the player is so cavalier about getting shot is odd too.  Most players, when under attack, will scramble.  He's just waltzing around like he doesn't fear death.
---
Yes. On the third floor there are three spawn points that can randomly spawn a dress in any color. The first is straight off the elevator in the first bedroom, on the bottom of the bunkbed in front of you. The second is in the other bedroom (opposite corner of the elevator) on the second (I think) bed over from the doorway. The third is on the bench inside the showers of the bathroom. Run in, check those three spots, and relog. The trick is not to pick ANYTHING up until you get a dress you want, because looting any open world item with reset the timer and no dress will spawn for awhile.
---
You're not cynical enough.
---
They could be planning on selling 'Power Armor Locked Storage Racks' for ~~real money~~ atoms.
---
Well I guess now you know how the rest of us feel Mr 5x AssSen.
---
Sounds like your issue is you dont understand the mechanic you are complaining about. It already does exactly what you proposed.
---
I'm late, but nope. Bolt action rifles are affected too.
---
Legendary is not a synonym for rare
---
Mirelurk Queens aren't so bad for me, but I'm also not a melee player. Kings on the other hand absolutely suck. They are the most annoying fights I have in the game and offer nothing.
---
They nerfed all that shit and balanced it because the duper‚Äôs, sooooo everyone who spent or traded high pretty much did it for nothing. 
---
Same thing was happening to multiple friends of mine In Survival, they haven‚Äôt officially said anything but they told me they were getting destroyed by guys way below them with worse gear
---
Don't bother if your intent is to make Caps - they nerfed that pretty bad in the last patch.
---
You can do a hybrid and add versatility by sacrificing a little max damage... right now I'm 90% heavy/explosives but I can secondary with rifles as I kept 7 perception (this way I can still play sniper and 6 agility for the ap.  My rifles wont ever output the damage of my heavy guns but I like the versatility.  Tbh if I threw on an unyielding set my perception and agility would be plenty high anyway
---
And you haven't been banned for mods
---
I think I actually picked up this plan the other day, might even have it in my inventory still. I'd have to check, welcome to have it if I do.
---
That's something a synth would say
---
And fix the friends list, put everybody online together and alphabetically. 
---
Every time they patch there is more bugs or different bugs and it takes so long to hit fix.
---
Ugh. Well I WAS laying here Redditing.....back to Fallout I go. :)
---
How do you suggest fixing it?
---
There was absolutely nothing illegitimate about farming Watoga.
---
What‚Äôs your psn I‚Äôm looking to buy and trade
---
Same price as ultracite explosive vents I reckon.
---
Yeah, nobody wants to sell high end stuff for caps, you know how it is... If you're willing to give up that gatling gun for it you can probably get one.  But I'm sure you know that. I'm not even sure I would give that one up.
---
And sorry just hit me up whenever online my gt CJPISI
---
It‚Äôs my primary food source to avoid actually having to care about that meter. With lead belly, I‚Äôll scarf down tons of spoiled food regularly.
---
Dang
---
In FO4 I had every type of armor displayed in my Castle. Each type with each paint job available. It looked like a classic car museum or soemthing.
---
Meanwhile i found place where 1-3 star annihilator bot spawns 5 meters in front of me, today i got like 70 3* items in 2 hours. Dont remember the name thought and i went working to germany im coming back next friday so i will share with you guys.
---
5 meters is 5.47 yards
---
Yeah, there are at least 6 different BOS paints for the T60. I have two of them, seen another guy on PS4 that has managed to get them all. Then you have the nukacola paint for the t51 and the nukaquantum paint for the X01. Those are the only non atomshop paints I can think of
---
Level means nothing.  I had a level 12 running around killing lvl 100+ because my character was specced and geared specifically for pvp and I know what I'm doing. 
---
 Sentinel means fuck-all if you're moving, staggered, or if they're using crits. 
---
Player health is so low no matter what you do, so if a player can put out massive damage quickly you will die.
---
He's in Survival, where he belongs.  What more do you want?
---
I'm not letting go of my gatling. I have about 20k caps currently and a bunch of weapons for trade. Also got the sheep squatch imposter helmet, which no one seems to be offering for.
---
+Karma +rep
---
Well if my own decorations are anything to go by, it's probably "never took them down." I've still got christmas lights up.
---
which is what?  Thanks
---
I want him to tasty my salty, salty tears and weep for the caps that I have lost. Oh lord may he weep!
---
My roommate has it on xbox and pc but only plays it on pc anymore. From my experience on watching him back when he was on xbox, the comminity on PC is friendlier.
---
How did your weapon drop in a bag? The t and r thing has been there since the beginning, where you go to respec your perks and hit r instead. End up with a bag on the ground with whatever legendary was highlighted at the time xD I saved my buddies bos chest one time, saw a bag at his feet during the queen event. I've done it myself.
---
Also if you can't find your bag, you can drop a bullet in the same area and it moves it all into the same bag.
---
&gt; The only thing non-PA armor won't do is rad resistance for nuke zones.
---
Or jetpacks.
---
I crash literally any time I go through a decontamination arch.
---
A sneak based melee, using instigating or bloodied can do astronomical dmg.
---
For bloodied youll need unyeilding armor, a bloodied or instigating weapon, with faster swing speed as a second, and 3rd a str+ (if wanting to go max).
---
Adrenal reaction as a mutation. Nerd rage, and radicool as perks.. max str, and choose a weapon. Mine has 3 in unarmed and one handed i use the 1st star of each of the one handed (gladiator i think) cards. Since i use powerfists and knives.
---
When i am down to 20% life from radiation so unyeilding armor kicks in boosts base damage on powerfist is 490 i think (only wearing like 2 peices).. double dmg for first hit (using instigating 1* powerfist) and sneak bonuses and math i can depending on other perks do anywhere from about 2500 to 4000 dmg first hit, then i have an executioners to switch to if whatever i just smacked lives.
---
Not very much i cant 2 shot with it.. 3* legendary 91 deathclaw takes maybe three hits, mirelurk queens 4 or 5. Sb maybe 4 or 5.. queen of course quite a few but most everything else.
---
If youre wanting to min max.. 5 pcs unyeilding, bloodied/instigating weapon/(antiarmor good 3rd choice).. str 15, agi 15, the rest all it really depends on is what you qol stuff is.. radicool and nerd rage is needed so account for those.. starched genes, class freak needed in luck.. if ya wanna add in defensive stuff serendipity, dodgy and so on are needed.. int i run 8 so can equip 5* makeshift warrior and 3* weapon artisan for 200% weapon durability. Lck i think i run 9 SG/CF/serendipity..
---
Course all ive said i can run in to a bloodied build but i play more defensively so i dont run my health to the 20% i just run at full health nd as i take damage i do more damage. I find full bloodied builds are nice and all but truely a glass cannon something breathes on you wrong youre lookin for your loot bag.
---
I kept trying to warn people that Bethesda never intended for people to be walking around in full sets of this stuff and if they did  it would be nerfed.  I suspect that is what finally happened.
---
Because people are stupid.
---
To get the best out of it you should run nerd rage which means you‚Äôll need to run at 20% health
---
Oh nice nice. Thank you.
---
Also, the power plant events randomly give you generator plans
---
Heavy guns for max damage output.  Bloody preferably.  But like the other guy said, all builds can be lethal... all in your equip and perk cards
---
Essentially worthless as everybody has it. SBQ is dropping those plans all over the place.
---
Mine if full of legendary stuff waiting to ‚Äòsell‚Äô
---
Strangler Heart event out in the Mire my man.
---
Send you a pm
---
Yeah like Brandon Banks who was locked up for 2 years on false rape charges.
---
How do you double walls? ü§î
---
No, he had too much ammo and bethesda got salty.
---
Don't blame you. That thing hits like a truck.
---
My 3* Stalkers baton disagrees with you. You can still get terrible 3 star items.
---
I do have str toon invested more in 1/2H it might be easier to use that toon since itll only be 10ish lvls
---
Kill on sight
---
I never said you couldn‚Äôt. I mean when I posted this, I still haven‚Äôt got anything good except a level 20 TSE SMG
---
It‚Äôs definitely something with the Bethesda account for sure.
---
You wouldn't - that's only for teammates or if, for some reason, the spawn point that's some distance to the north is unavailable.
---
There seems to be some variance in that north spawn position, which is easy to see if you look at your surroundings when you spawn.  For me, it places me in a gap between a slope and a tree.  Sometimes I'm closer to one or the other.  And other times, it spawns me next to my stairs (the original placement of the CAMP object).  I've speculated this may happen when the random variance picks an invalid location either inside the tree or behind the slope.
---
These camps are the reason I craft orbital strike grenades
---
Anillop. The Fallout universe fundamentally takes aesthetic design of America's golden era, just after the World War. The 1950‚Äôs was the epitome of social change and this was highlighted by the unique local design and colour scheme of the Nurses Uniforms. Many of the dresses had to be individually tailored, but followed a similar design pattern partly influenced by fashion but lessons learnt and dictated by hygiene and welfare.
---
In essence having different uniforms allows the player options to individualise their character to make it stand out. Also provides players another aim especially if they're an apparel collector.
---
A lot of what Bethesda does seems motivated by an effort to slow the game down, and the way they do that is to throw players against randomized systems where the likelihood of getting what they want is very small.  It's the reason why 3\* enemies have an almost 50% chance of dropping 1\* gear.
---
Which would be fine as long as there was other stuff to keep endgame players engaged, but that's been pretty slow.
---
Yeah we need these.  That said, you can currently do this manually by having double thicc walls with the brick sandwiched between.
---
It's good to eat spoiled food  to get your rads up and get a disease for Plague walker
---
I'm not even prepping that man, I have like 3 weapons in my stash who would of thought 800 wood and 800 lead would equal so much weight üòÇ
---
I had rows and rows of them on the roof at at Starlight Drive-In. It was great. Really miss that. I'm hoping for power armor display cases in this game eventually.
---
Ps4, no problems on hunting rifle and lever gun so far
---
I‚Äôm looking to make a new raider gang called the Home Owner‚Äôs Association. 
---
Our job would be to clean up the unsightly homes, defense turret houses, stair/floors taking up the space that surround the White Springs.
---
Yeah I'm going to go ahead and call BS on that
---
Bulk your lead and lose the wood, nobody needs 800 of that LOL
---
From what I've seen, melee attacks have a kind of anti-armor property to them.  I ended up taking a couple ranks of Blocker to deal with it.
---
I think this was the point of the no human npc‚Äôs like a giant post apocalyptic social experiment
---
So the converter bot should definately be an in-game thing.  How many times have I looked at my 10mm pistol and wondered how big that is in inches.
---
Considering the rather extreme rarity of finding one that will actually engage in combat, I think they should have a chance of dropping a weapon or armour piece unique to them. Even if it was just a plasma pistol with a pink shot.
---
hahaha I was like 'is this person fucking kidding me' and then was like 'oh yes this person actually is fucking kidding me and i just got got'
---
Looks more like an AK
---
The thing I did notice was that if you don't start it yourself I had problems. Almost all logged when I started it or I was there when it started. I only had one event that I started and a guy came into half way that didnt log for me but it did for him. If you already have that many and try the method I told the other guy below, you should be able to blow through the last ones you have.
---
Those you stated before the hunted and hunter are pretty easy
---
Come on out, I'll make it nice and quick for ya!
---
You got me there
---
So the +3s for unyielding are at about 20?
---
Jesus Fucking Christ, I think you forget to put a full line of space in between a few sentences there.
---
Know why you don't see people with jetpacks so often?  Because they're a fucking novelty.  Anyone that cares about getting that kind of height out of a jump can more easily just get Marsupial and not have to drain a fusion core every time they want to jump and save that mod slot for something ACTUALLY USEFUL.
---
Wait i got bamboozled shit time to delete my comment
---
Yep same here, went looking for gameplay vids when Fallout 4 arrived, he's consistently good
---
I‚Äôve seen one in the far south of the savage divide and one in the ash heap near Camden Park.
---
I would gladly take longer loading screens if that means all assets are properly loaded once the screen fades into the game.
---
Why do people always want just 1 second of loading screen if they know that means the game still has to load 90% of the rest of the stuff anyway.
---
Only the last 24 hours this has been an issue, took on a pile of bears got staggered and killed all 6 with no issue standing my ground, couple days ago taking on scorch beasts lvl 80 no issue, last night spanked by a lvl 50 from screams alone I have dense and 1 fireproof even gun shots are tearing me apart
---
Electrically charged its broken and counts as player damage outside or pvp
---
Ive seen mutation go from 50caps, all the way to 1000 caps.
---
That's patched. I tested it.
---
Whooosh
---
Around there I think 25% health
---
I both did the salty tears thing and the lose lots of caps thing.
---
No problem. I respect your dedication to the junkie‚Äôs build sir. It seems both fun and strong. Never knew that about X-cell, fury, and overdrive stacking either.
---
It‚Äôs on my list to try one day. Just wish it was as strong as in FO4
---
Hit me up on ps4 SweetDeal2010 I've just hit about lv64 but really want a team to help me drop a nuke when they are ready!!
---
Yeah i saw that coming i commented on another guys thing saying i got bamboozled by it
---
Then you have my sympathies.
---
Thats what felt weird about this encounter.
---
I think it is sold by the Enclave vendor. Not sure.
---
I got irritated after spending hours making an awesome place for my alt, and then accidentally putting down the wrong platform in a spot, when I went to delete it, it wouldn't let me, claiming it was attached to SOMETHING. It was attached to nothing...
---
You mad man
---
Why not take 1 minute to realize that your mutation did damage to him, then clearly initiated pvp?
---
honestly I'd just have something like mouse button 3 for default push to talk and mouse button 4 for area
---
Did you have pacifist on?
---
I didnt down vote but i still have issues with electrically charged i have a feeling its damage range was reduced and thats why people hug you to make sure they take damage
---
Yea as far as the stacking that surprised me too...that‚Äôs why it deserves an grain of salt and I asked other folks to help me verifying that‚Äôs just a display bug or it actually does work that way for more than just me
---
That's patched. It was in the patch notes a while back and I tested it. What's with the snarky attitude?
---
Viable yes but expensive upkeep and heavy ammo weight is something to consider when using certain weapons. Since Heavy weapons recently recieved a buff they are now considerally better
---
Missle launchers and mini nukes are not covered by the heavy gunner perk but instead covered by Demolition expert. There is also a perk that increases the explosive radius and also one that reduces the weight or explosive artillery.
---
If your curious about which weapons are best check out Captain Noob's YouTube channel.
---
No but you dont have too.
---
I mostly agree, but it can take a stupid turn when the reputation is too bad. In theory, the fewer people there are (as a result of the reputation or other reasons), the more the individual player is 'expected' by the developer/publisher to spend on microtransactions. In a way, it makes sense to milk the last few hundred players you have before you shut down - and it definitely hinders content development.
---
I'm pretty new to Fallout 76. I'm enjoying it as a solo person. I'm not into typical 'endgame' stuff, but I like returning to games when new content comes out. I want this game to have new content for a couple of years. Developing said content _can_ work with fewer people, but there's a point in player numbers that, when reached, results in minimal new content, just to milk the last few players.
---
I don't want that to happen. I want more people to have a change of mind and support the game.
---
I've tested it a few times and couldn't get that to work. As far as I know that was patched some time ago.
---
If you tame a second creature does it override the one already at your camp?
---
Lol I know but it seems everything you scrap has wood in it these days I'm just to lazy to sort it out
---
Had a mythical flatwoods monster chase me on one of the new side quests. Heard everyone say how tough they are and it died in like 9 shots... And the loot was almost exactly what OP said.
---
Bounties are the issue i think not standard pvp since the person can already take full damage with no restrictions and obviously when he takes damage you are free to kill
---
&lt; 3
---
Cloaking house sounds awesome for survival
---
That's still less than It used to be
---
Even if that is the case then it's a bug and needs to be fixed
---
I‚Äôve had this happen. Don‚Äôt listen to the people getting shitty with you. There is definitely something functioning improperly.
---
I guess build one foundation, place wall. Build second foundation then place it's wall.
---
But you need to hit the 20% mark to get nerd rage to kick in
---
I‚Äôve done almost exactly the same, it was well worth spending the extra time on the build over the first 60 odd levels to enjoy the versatility of switching between stealth sniper and heavy weapons/power armour depending on my mood lol.  Currently level 107.
---
The main issue is obviously the bountied player will need to be "nerfed" to not be able to set off mutations or just make the mutation non triggerable by players
---
Yep. This had happened to me four times: twice at the WS golf club, once at the Waste Disposal against Death claw, and once against Scotched are big
---
Its ridiculous how people will blame the player who has noticed a bug because they are blind zealots for Bethesda.
---
Yea  grafton monster every single time
---
The dont help anyway. I'm thinking if getting rid of them.
---
Or your game gets corrupted on the next patch and you must redownload everything.
---
The enclave underarmor is best for a melee character. Make sure to use the shielded lining
---
The operative under armour focuses points on strength and perception
---
Supposedly there is a spot near Abbie's Bunker in the northeast of the map that has a decent chance to spawn one.
---
Happens to me quite a lot on ps4
---
That's the car you can win in the Grand Appalachian Sweepstakes. Wouldn't do to have it be a rusted wreck.
---
Been proposed.  Just be happy with backpacks.
---
Because people are lazy
---
had the same, even with normal quests, server hopping helped, but i had to exit entirely then load up again..
---
exiting to the menu and selecting play just ended up in the 'searching for world' and it never finding one...
---
I didn‚Äôt have any mutations other than marsupial and had pacifist on. Guy walked up to me and one punched me with a power fist right after killing someone else. We both reported him.
---
Where do I sign up? And do you have jackets and or cookies?
---
The real question isn't why players do it.
---
It's asking why Bethesda still considers that a valid space to build a CAMP in the first place.  Like, why isn't all of Whitesprings just off-limits?
---
People need to get a grip.
---
Glad I could help :). I don't know why the basic meat hook has so much damage honestly. Compared to all the swords and gauntlets it really seems strange a small butcher weapon is so powerful lol. It might be something the devs overlooked, Shhh....
---
Shielded Enclave operative under armor gives +3 Strength and +2 perception.   You have to buy the plans from the enclave after buying all the previous under armor mod plans.  What platform you on?  I can make them shielded if you can get me the mats/base under armor.  I‚Äôm on PS4
---
Even though they shove you into PvP, Workshops are probably still the best way to accrue CAMP plans.
---
It crashes for me only when i try to enter load buildings or the server will be down so i'll have to find a new one
---
Like my collection of different teddybears!
---
It starts kicking in around 50%.  It's higher than you'd think.
---
What system/PC specs are those of you who are getting a lot of crashes running? I had one unusual crash since the sheep patch and it was on initial load-in. Otherwise the same frequency as always. 
---
I'm on an i7-7700HQ (running undervolted and at 2.7ghz w/ turbo disabled), 16GB, GTX1060 6GB, SSD.
---
Something to keep in mind is that the game will freeze if your controller batteries are low and swapping in new batteries or plugging in the controller will unfreeze it without CTD, but if you leave it frozen it will CTD after a minute. On windows there's no battery monitor for the controller so you have to just keep a spare set on hand to swap in quick.
---
üòÇüëç
---
i built my base at whitesprings golf course so that i can get to whitesprings faster and also because occasionally things attack my base that give me items i need to repair my weapons and armor. i have never griefed anyone and never will. it is upsetting to think people will destroy my base just because of where it is located
---
The problem with the game is that the RNG has no skill contribution. A noob who kills one legendary can get a god tier drop while the hardcore player who farms 100 legendaries can get a pile of shit despite being the player with more effort and skill.
---
Also it doesn't help that almost every god tier item that players are wearing right now was created via duping. This means players doing legit farming have almost no chance of catching up to players who buy duped gear.
---
Strurges #is a synth
---
Absolutely not incompetence after so many patches and complaints. They‚Äôd be out of business long ago if they can‚Äôt fix something like this. It‚Äôs intentional because wood pieces aren‚Äôt insulting enough.
---
What? As soon as you enter a power armor frame it is yours. No one can take it or get into it.
---
I‚Äôve noticed a few issues the last 24 hours, my sentinel armour isn‚Äôt functional at all its like wearing paper
---
The system is so needlessly convoluted. Why even have different maximum levels for different weapon/armor types? Why not have loot drop to the player level instead of the mob level? It's not like there are tons of low level 3* legendary enemies that could be farmed, anyway...
---
Interesting
---
Yeah I‚Äôm ps4, how do I get the under Armor and what materials do you need
---
Yeah but I hadn't even initiated combat with this guy.
---
This reminds of when explosive and high rate of fire weapon damage would cause rapid health regen and invulnerability
---
Yeah I dunno, tried multiple servers, survival and adventure. In the past week think I had boomers daily once, and it canceled when server crashed before I finished. Must be weekly instead of daily.
---
Too many people think Unyielding means you need to be running around at 20% health. I run it at 40% and it doesn't set me back too much.
---
Yes, any item that is used in a recipe pre-scrapped should not auto-scrap.
---
Or let us edit our our auto-scrap list
---
It's a bug, you can't modify some weapons right now
---
I just end up wearing it everywhere, not only are fusion cores as rare as pigs on a farm, power armor hardly needs repairs, unlike normal armor. Also the extra carry weight you get isn't bad either.
---
You on PS4?
---
When you enter power armor you unequip all other gear. Even if it says it's equipped it's not. It will auto equip when you get out of power armor.
---
During the sheep event, I died to a bomb.
---
I respawn, and I notice I am using my fist.
---
I go to my inventory, and my anti-armor faster fire rate auto rifle is no longer in my inventory.
---
My heart starts beating real fast.
---
I jump to the spot where I died, and notice a bag, the kind of bag in which the items you throw are stored in.
---
In this bag is my beloved weapon.
---
At no moment, I could have thrown it by mistake. It is simply impossible.
---
It is exactly the same thing that happen sometimes when I kill mobs with automatic explosive weapons, they drop their guns on the ground.
---
Modding is broken at the moment
---
what sucks is I think when you report a crash on PS4 you‚Äôre only reporting it to Sony, I‚Äôm not sure if they share the crash data with developers or not
---
I get that, just saying lots of issues have been happening the last 24 hours and it doesn‚Äôt surprise me open pk is one of them
---
TLDR: Armor bonuses and Power Armor bonuses don't stack.
---
Slightly longer: Wearing power armor negates any bonuses conferred by any other armor you're wearing. That includes DR and legendary bonuses. However you do get to take benefit of the bonuses conferred by the power armor, which is nice.
---
There‚Äôs no way your damage is too high with any gun in those videos.
---
A 1 Star non explosive Tesla with a full health build has very laughable dmg, it wouldn‚Äôt even dmg my pvp character.
---
A quad double barrel will do zero damage to someone with dense mod and fireproof tank 3.
---
You were unloading that handmade into a guy with sentinel, and your dmg is so LOW that you didn‚Äôt hurt him at all, and your build sucks because you don‚Äôt have tank killer and didn‚Äôt stagger him once so that you could actually dmg him. Worst part is that whole time you had a crit ready, that if you used on his head, game over you would‚Äôve won.
---
The last fight seems the most close to an actual bug, but more like spawn protection protecting a newbie at his camp in the forest.
---
Your dmg isn‚Äôt close to too high, I 1 shot ppl all day with an 800dmg bloodied gauss that‚Äôs hitting 2.4k dmg with sneak attack. Same thing with my 300 dmg bloodied handmade spitting out 3 crits in 3 seconds all boosted by sneak attack damage x3 for a grand total of 5400 dmg in 3 seconds.
---
If my dmg isn‚Äôt glitching with those massive numbers, yours isn‚Äôt glitching with your tiny full health build dmg numbers and no sneak attacks.
---
Already announced as a coming feature
---
Also, only carrying spoiled aid items leaves a nice present for whoever kills you in survival
---
Exactly. The reality is full of deceit and disinfo so people come to the game world to relax, meet BGS who sell lies as RNG.
---
Yet people are downvoting me and acting like this is fine and I'm wrong.
---
This is a highly active topic, and has been since release. Bethesda knows, and has talked about it.
---
Why is this a spoiler?
---
***Successful completion*** of this event left me so infuriated that I haven't logged into the game since.
---
I finished it successfully it left me with no  desire to do it again.  I can't imagine what it must be like to have the game crash before completion.
---
You're fine as long as you don't have turret's pointed directly at the spawn point of the golf club. It's pretty obvious what we are talking about here.
---
Y'know, there's a fair bit I haven't been able to explain lately.
---
Like, for me, I've noticed that my Bloodied weapons aren't anywhere near where they used to be, even at extremely low health.  I know for a fact these things went into the 900-1400 range prior to Patch 8, but now they struggle to get past 600.
---
I've wanted to chalk it up to lag, the game not updating the numbers in the Pip-Boy.  It's hard to tell what's actually happening in practice.  I am dropping every Silo enemy in a single hit with my Bloodied Power Fist, which is supposedly doing a mediocre 450 damage.
---
Seems to spawn pretty commonly at the crashed space station
---
Started/Finished yet?
---
Bruh. My 1* quad automatic tesla with rank 3 tank killer would like to speak to you. :D
---
Damn, now thats messed up!
---
Probably don‚Äôt want people seeing this post so they can run the exploit, I‚Äôm spamming upvotes for you
---
Can you link to this? I've looked a few times but not sure how to word it.
---
This.  I gathered most this way, then the vendor changes a while back allowed me to buy the ones I wanted that were missing.
---
Hey man, drink this, it‚Äôll give you a good buff for the event.
---
Just PS4 Pro üòê
---
It's not even that is it? Spawn killing the ghouls with a turret accomplishes nothing. It's fine to have base there, just don't have turret's pointed at the spawns.
---
We're launching again soon
---
Crafting pschyobuff counts for daily. Psycho+Buffout
---
Yeah I get crashed after entering the building and trying to do something!
---
You need 11 ballistic fiber, 18 ultricite, and 4 stable crimson flux.  You can buy the under armor from the enclave.
---
Last night I literally Googled the codes, went straight to the silo. Had it all done faster than you'd get even 4 codes.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs it? It appears in the build menu
---
I'm bringing cookies.
---
So we are just going to ignore it literally showing their health go to 0 and then return over and over? Obviously I'm doing enough damage to make their health deplete to nothing so none of your defenses of this are valid.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Under the Wild Appalachia update, CAMP decorating
---
Right. And the one I was using was a 3 star.
---
I‚Äôm wondering if the recent hot patch has caused a bleed from survival
---
You can block someone. But if they can still end up on the same server with you, if the method they joined that server was joining on another play. The auto queue system will avoid placing you two in the same server, but if they join a friend in your server it will not stop them.
---
Maybe the threshold should just be lower.  Why not kick in at 2 players?  Or 3?  The likelihood of four players being on the same page about anything (outside of SBQ/Sheepsquatch) is fairly low, let alone when it concerns PvP which many aren't interested in to begin with.
---
I should clarify that it's only if I actually try to use it.  I can just walk through them without a problem but its instant kick if I turn it on.
---
Neat idea!
---
Lol. Thanks. You the real MVP.
---
And enlarge subtitles. I have to squint to see them.
---
So I was able to find Mr. Squeeze west of Graninger Farm and south of Black bear Lodge, in a parking lot. I was able to sell quite a bit to him and ended up walking to my camp, which was set up not too far to pick up some other things to sell and by the time I was back he was gone. It was not hard to miss him as the yellow and blue balloons caught my eye from pretty far away. Just like op said, he had 2 lemonade recipes and lemons for sale. Any questions and I'll be happy to help!
---
Funny you mention melee though I just got a pf I have 5 strength and unyielding gear and can do nearly 500 damage with no perks
---
Lmao please let it, I‚Äôm sure it will tickle me. Then I‚Äôll just 1 shot you.
---
I had every crafting station, turret, generator and resource collector as well as most of the wall destroyed when someone came along, stabbed me in the back and claimed the 310 bounty.  It was just floors and few walls left at that point. They had a full base here, not just a bare bones turret camp. With 4-5 gun turrets and 2-3 missiles all pointed directly at the spawn.
---
So should legendary drops scale with level, such as a level 100 player has a better chance of getting an explosive effect than someone who is level 10?
---
Big whoop? I‚Äôve got a bloodied explosive Tesla, 500 dmg, that‚Äôs a real gun.
---
it would be cool to just grab one at your house rather than carry around 10 pounds in your inventory for each one or have them take up space in your stash.
---
Nope, not yet.
---
It happens 75% of the time to me when killing Behemoths. Sometimes they even respawn instantly.
---
Imagine you‚Äôre a super mutant and you see that coming your way (provided they‚Äôre occupied). I think it would be a code brown moment.
---
"
---
    Player-built Turrets are now affected by player PvP damage rules, which feature damage scaling, as well as an increase in base damage for all types of Turrets, ranging from +15% to +100% damage depending the Turret.
---
        Additionally, Turret attack ranges have been increased to match players‚Äô weapon ranges.
---
        The Shotgun Turret‚Äôs projectile spread has been reduced to better match the Combat Shotgun.
---
    These changes should help Turrets in C.A.M.P.s and Workshops pose a bigger and more consistent threat against attackers.
---
Says player built but I swear on my life those laser turrets in the Silos have never hit this hard.
---
Alright, drop your IGN and lets go.
---
Will you be available tomorrow? I think I have all this
---
I'll be on in 5 - 10 minutes
---
Sometimes when I loot legendaries it will show a weapon or armour already in my inventory, after it fades away the current item will show up.
---
People are like tiny wieners they have to act out to get noticed, there‚Äôs loads of issues going on I wonder if the rules for survival are bleeding into adventure
---
Wow. You're hilarious. If you need to repair something in the middle of an event you're unprepared and playing poorly. Good job guy. I don't care that you're bad at the game, but trying to act so condescending is a bad look for you. Get better soon!
---
The worst part is that you lose all your workshops every single it happens, ironically usually happening RIGHT after you place all  your gennies and extractors...
---
Ok, you‚Äôre starting to ask for too much.  There‚Äôre no medieval themes or precedent for this, it makes no sense.  Power armor is what fills that role and fits the Fallout theme.
---
This is a great idea! I can't believe nobody has thought of this yet!
---
How do you know about the legendary trader?
---
Ok
---
Lol. Not the point. The point is that this guy is pooping on non explosive Tesla rifles and clearly doesn't know what he is talking about.
---
I‚Äôd love to hear you explain how medieval armor is plentiful in West Virginia.  It‚Äôs not.  You can‚Äôt sell us on this idea.
---
[Game of Thrones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNACsbSwAHY)
---
I have had this happen several times. Mood AF
---
Yeah.  That's why I went from Vanguard to Unyielding.  You'll only see the benefits of Vanguard if you religiously keep your rads low, which is tedious and costly.  Unyielding, you start seeing benefits at roughly half-health, and you *always have the option* of going glass cannon if you want.  Often time, there's no need.  But you'll be thankful in certain battles when you can.
---
You obviously haven‚Äôt pvp‚Äôd much. You get that health going up and down thing in about every PvP right. It‚Äôs just a visual lag between the server and client. It literally happens constantly, test it with a friend, you‚Äôll see his health go down and up, but he won‚Äôt see it move at all, most commonly happens with sentinel builds.
---
And my defenses are all valid, you just argue like a child, avoiding all logic, and you clearly have no experience to back up what you say either because these videos and this comment prove you‚Äôre a PvP noob.
---
You can do that I'll farm a new toon up to 50 in a day or 2 xfer my gear then funnel the caps back to my lvl 300 + .    or I can use a high lvl with zero caps in survival.
---
Ha apparently according to the other comments, they have. I hadn't heard anything about it.
---
Yep! My PSN is Blizzard‚ÄîNight. (Note the 2 - -, not one)
---
I dropped it and didn't pick it up, shortly afterwards my game crashed.
---
inside the vault
---
Great post and stuff like this is why I'm fed up with this game and haven't logged into it for a few days. That means an awful lot because I am someone who played it every single day since beta. 
---
Everyone has their limit, and mine was the latest event included with the DLC which felt like a re-skin of the scorched beast queen fight with the same underwhelming loot drop. '
---
It left me with no desire to play the game again.
---
Would you do 500 for the two shot m79?
---
I‚Äôm PS4, but I‚Äôve already had guys unload on me with 1* star bloodied Tesla‚Äôs with 400 dmg, it just tickles me. I have full sentinel assassin and 500 dr and 400 er, that thing isn‚Äôt gonna do shit lol.
---
The last time I did the event, I took two pylons and jumped on top of the shack. From there I took on the majority of the gutsys and the protectrons, while popping stims like crazy. That left one pylon and the boss for the other 7-8 players there. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what they were doing, though, as we failed it miserably. Wasted around 30 stims and a f**kton of ammo. 
---
I managed to stay alive for the whole event holding two pylons, but a third would be too much.
---
I PvP all the time and record this when it happens. You just put your foot in your mouth because your arguement was that your damage was higher than mine and it didnt happen to you but now you say it happens to you even more often than me. Thank you for proving my point.
---
Yeah you can only have one at a time.
---
I counted up all the * I had one time and it was like 225... I really hope the vendor works well... I have no more room
---
So you can pacify most anything with Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer but you can only *tame* randomly spawned animals. To find these random spawns you'll most likely need to server hop. I'd recommend looking up the random event map to see where all the locations are. Once you find a tameable creature and send it to your camp I'd recommend server hopping and fast traveling until they get to your camp. If it's a distance it could take a while, but I've never lost a pet or had them fail to show up yet.
---
Did you own any workshops?
---
I'm on now. PSN AndrewMosier
---
Make some healing salves in the meantime if you are out of stimpaks.
---
No
---
They're texture replacements.
---
I‚Äôm not saying they are worthless, but in your unspecced hands, it clearly is worthless. Any gun is worthless without the right perks behind it.
---
Oh my god I just realized that‚Äôs all of the people from the bunker.
---
Yeah, which according to the numbers, is where I am with Iron Fist 3, Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage, 4/5 Unyielding, and Talons.
---
Can't explain it.  The same setup would regularly put me at 980 and above before.
---
I froze the second it died and received nothing. First rage quit with any game in years. It‚Äôs infuriating that they introduce content but still cannot provide basic functionality to make the game stable.
---
Just placed an order!
---
Yeah my for some reason is like actually why better than my tse pump action shotgun
---
Hmm, I wanna say it was your mutation that did it, but they supposedly patched that. Not a clue then, that shouldn't be happening
---
No it's all about beeing a good or a bad player... 
---
You're visible with no covering startin shooting at players who're invulnerable due spawn protection an you wondering beeing killed?!?
---
Just a hint: Stay away from spawn point... spawned players mostly win 'cause they have the first armed Shot while you're wasting ammo and APs.
---
I have all the rifleman perks there bud.... what now?
---
Was your volume off?
---
That‚Äôs the thing, it‚Äôs not actually happening, it‚Äôs a visual lag between the server and client.
---
Like I said, test it with a friend with sentinel armor, you‚Äôll see for yourself. His bar will bounce down and up over and over, but on his screen his health will barely move if even move at all. It‚Äôs not a dmg bug, just a latency issue.
---
I was sippin a cold one down at the portside pub when a stranger entered the bar, moseyed up to me and took the seat beside me.
---
Son, he said 
---
If you buy me a cranberry moonshine, I‚Äôll tell ya the tale of the ol‚Äô legendary trader 
---
....and that‚Äôs how I learned about him
---
Yeah, I'll gladly take an extra 33% loot over a few saved stimpacks. It's not hard to find healing in this game  and worst case you just carry more around with you with the extra capacity
---
Yeh thats a bummer when that happens. Found a fully kitted out workshop I got to claim last night. Poor person built epic!
---
Nope, full volume.
---
Fair. It just seems a like an odd way to count ammo for four weapons when in all reality they operate the same. 
---
A laser gun is never gonna out class a ballistic gun in performance outside of the weight. 
---
It would be a lot more logical and practical to carry 60 fusion cells that function the same as a fusion core than to carry 5000 fusion cells.
---
I think everything is just fucked, glad I‚Äôm in the middle of packing and moving hopefully this all gets fixed by the time I‚Äôm done
---
Yeh I got you. Still sucks :(
---
Then I have no idea
---
Not gonna lie 10/10 until that end lol, but seriously appreciate you even offering.
---
Nope. Nothing need added. Sorry.
---
That was the joke.  This sub has degraded into people posting the same crap over and over as if for the first time.
---
I think it may be bugged at the moment, because I auto scrapped last night and it unbundled 25 bulk adhesive I had.
---
The things you need to worry about with a new patch are changing fallout76custom.ini to include the new data files, and checking with any mod pages you use to see if they need to be updated for the new patch. Nothing should be corrupting your game.
---
Thats a big collection, but a total waste of stash space. What is the point of having 50 power armors other than taking a picture of them?
---
I was wearing full Sentinal assassin in all of those videos. I know how it works and me friends with the same armor fight all the time. That's not what happens. When we fight our health just doesn't move, it never goes all the way down and then back up. I have tested it.
---
Really!? Or /s?
---
If you had tank killer then your handmade would‚Äôve staggered the guy and actually hurt him.
---
Hell I can shoot my 800 dmg gauss at a sentinel assassin players head when he is standing still and do zero dmg, but the second he crouches moves or staggers, it‚Äôs a 1 shot.
---
won't let me join. Server full? Privacy settings?
---
Nothing to see move along.
---
Bruh quad. a quad tesla with 60 round mag, automatic receiver, commando perks and tank killer will fuck your day up. 15 rounds from a bloodied tesla isn't going to do shit. Running assassins sentinel on a bloodied build. Real fun.
---
hmm I'll try this next time thanks
---
&gt;It's not just the robots they changed but also the three stars that spawn in different locations in watoga. 
---
You are absolutely correct.  I used to farm legendary gear at the emergency center and the civic center and those drops are now shit.
---
Watoga and the cranberry bog is late game, high level territory.  When they start nerfing that, then they have really crossed the line.
---
\_/^-^\_/
---
I can kinda understand how that would be allowed but does the image data change?
---
It's not that difficult to get to a point where the SBQ can't kill you.  The question is, how much damage can *you* dish out?
---
But basically, there's a [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) for this year.  So far, this has resulted in the new Nuka-Shine and Sheepsquatch quest lines (accessible from any train station's bulletin board), the ability to brew craft beverages, and the limited time Fasnacht event which provided a bunch of festive CAMP decorations and silly masks.
---
I have 37 bulk rubber if you want lol
---
It's done that for a while, I think it was an intentional change for some reason I can't understand
---
What's your GT
---
Yes on your screen your health won‚Äôt move, but while they are shooting at you, the hp bar they see for you will be bouncing down and back up. 
---
Seriously ask any real pvp‚Äôer, they will have all experienced this very often.
---
Honestly for that to work and keep your power armor after griefers raided you i would want first off to display it you would have to have the power armor in the stash first and have the display basically show what is in the stash box so no one can steal it
---
Gotcha, my appologies. Just coming back after a month long break.
---
Yeah, they added the Biv daily quests to unlock brewing and the latest is a Cryptid hunt looking for the Sheepsquatch. With those there's new crafting, camp stuff, weapons, and obviously the atom shop has been steadily updating.
---
If they are just jumping they have Assassin Sentinel, as long as they are not moving they have insane damage resistance.  For some reason jumping does not count as movement.
---
Currently the only counters I know to this build is.
---
Staggering them
---
VATS Crits
---
And the lvl 4 guy?
---
I used to do that in fo4. I had a giant floating warehouse in Sanctuary with power armor display cases. One for each paint job, per power armor. 
---
As it is though, oh my lord rip your stash space. I thought I had it bad keeping one of each armor on me.
---
Were you crouching?  Sentinel is broken and doesn‚Äôt work when you crouch.
---
hey i just wanted to say....i love you!
---
Forgot your platform my dude!
---
Thanks everyone. From your comments I learnt I was doing it wrong.
---
By thinking I needed to stand by the pylon I made myself the target for every robot coming in on that side, which was probably most of the issue with my health getting hammered. It also took close to the time limit to kill the Sheepsquatch on my first go (which I initiated) so that's a lot of time getting shot by Mr Gutsy's while standing stupidly in the open.
---
I've completed the event a few more times &amp; it seems to come down to the effectiveness group of players. 
---
For one I was a conduit for 2 of the pylons &amp; hardly used any stimpaks as Sheepsquatch was squashed like a bug.
---
In another I was a conduit &amp; (like the first time) it took ages to kill the Sheepsquatch &amp; I used more stimpaks than I liked.
---
Healing/ stimpak perks would definitely help too, I'm going to add those during my next few level ups so I've got them aside for this sort of tanking.
---
Lol a quad Tesla just doesn‚Äôt have the dmg dude, and you can have all the commando perks and a bloodied will still have twice your dmg, you would be better off smacking me with a shovel.
---
I have no doubt you folks are correct. For me, Fallout 76 is turning out just like 
---
Fallout 4 did. I'm constantly seeing and reading about things in the game from other players that I never, EVER see. And I've banked A LOT of hours in this damn game. :-/
---
Where you nuking?
---
You must understand. I am saying that my friends health doesn't do that. Why do you think you can make an arguement of authority calling yourself a "real pvper". Gtfo of here with that bs.
---
Just edited it. Thanks for reminding me haha
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
I have a Two shot one, might be the only legendary effect though..
---
I have 
---
Bolstering Combat LA and LL
---
Troubleshooters Combat LA RA and RL
---
Vanguards Combat Chest and LA
---
Weightless Combat Chest and RA
---
Lol I‚Äôve been playing since the beta and haven‚Äôt seen him once.
---
Wmcg204
---
That's a change.  You don't know why it changed, only that it did.  To claim that they're making it harder simply to sell DLC is a pretty big stretch.
---
Is it another step?  Sure.  Is it more annoying?  I'd say so.  Is there any other possible reason besides selling DLC that this may have been put into place?  Go with Hanlon's razor here.  Don't assume malicious intent when you can blame it on stupidity, or literally anything else for that matter.
---
I don't use PA atm and just may not in the future but this is a great idea!  I wouldn't mind visiting homes to see people's proud displays like PA sets, gun sets, strange doo-dads and baubles,  instead of just furniture &amp; posters :)
---
I‚Äôll be looking into making a discord when I get off work tonight. As far as jackets are concerned, as long as it‚Äôs an outfit and not showing you‚Äôre rusted looking armor, be a clown if you want. Maybe we‚Äôll hold a community party and vote on the outfit.
---
Fissure site prime cus why not
---
I don't know what GT is
---
Mix of 1 and 2*, I can make limbs BOS if needed.
---
Took me a few seconds to get it...god, that takes me back
---
 My psn is VillainesSarah.  I'm certain my main and possibly my alt have pieces for you.  I'll message you wth what i have available soon
---
Good idea with 2-3 players
---
Gamertag
---
I had the same but on the ground level...it was awesome like my own private army just waiting to mobilize at my whim :)
---
Like I said(most repeated few words to you) that appears to be the closest thing to a bug, maybe it has to do with the dmg scaling due to lvl difference? Idk about that one, but the others look normal to me.
---
And just because I‚Äôve been disagreeing with you doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt an issue here, I just think the issue is the latency with the server and client, not correctly visually representing someone‚Äôs health to other players.
---
Can I get 4 teammates and we all start hunter and hunted to do the challenges ? If we will turn on the radio at the same time will that work ?
---
?
---
Wow relax XD
---
The imposter sheepsquatch disappeared on me last night. Perhaps its a new bug.
---
It doesn't save enough weight to justify bulking IMO. Some junk even weights more if in bulk. I do it only if I want to sell junk, but selling junk isn't profitable enough either at +50lvl when you can easily farm 30-40caps weapons.
---
You have to rotate it. I e had that problem. Sometimes moving it away from the rest of the wall and rotate will work, and sometimes rotating it in place. Eventually you can get it flipped.
---
Yh sorry not too awake
---
CounterBloom26
---
It's true. At first it grates on me and I'm annoyed people don't use search or even read the front page, but honestly I'm just glad the game's active enough people come here and think they're the first with one of those ideas.
---
That doesn‚Äôt exist. Only perks make things degrade slower. 
---
Again...you‚Äôre not good at this making up problems thing. 
---
This is not the end of the game. None of this will change anything. Stop having a panic attack
---
It is even more annoying that we can't find recent players to rejoin our match. It's like adding salt to the wound.
---
The legendary system and throttling will kill this game. People will stop playing if they don‚Äôt get fairly regular legendary drops. I don‚Äôt need a god roll every time, but I would at least like a chance.
---
Kk awesome, I think we‚Äôre already friends, helped you with the sheep mission yesterday
---
That's better than what I've already got :) how many caps would you take for it?
---
Headed to your game. Hold on.
---
I just re log and it plays nice.
---
Nah... I use those spawn points to look for tameable creatures and I've never seen a single Flatwoods Monster there. *Maybe* it's possible, but no more likely than anywhere else. I see them a lot in the Savage Divide though.
---
Nope the track. But just on the map screen. I thought they would track on the game screen like quest.
---
Friend request coming your way
---
I have a couple thousand rounds that need a good home. What's your gt
---
Sweet yeah!
---
That‚Äôs not what an argument of authority is, I never referred to myself as a real pvper(although hundreds of PS4 players would agree that I am), I simply told you to ask one of them.
---
Your friend has sentinel assassin, dense mod, fireproof tank 3, adamantium rank 3, and you‚Äôre not getting the visual dmg thing? I would say in that case your dmg is too low then.
---
Have you tried "dragging" it backwards and forwards?
---
There's a point where it'll flip, but you might need to extend your floor for it to work.
---
Good advice. Definitely a lesson learned!
---
Model.
---
Great for trolling people....
---
ah
---
I found the plans for the shielded, but for some crazy reason it don't show up as I have it when I go to upgrade. I have 2 more of the plans, they shown as known. Not sure on what's going on
---
PREACH BROTHER
---
Well, "allowed" is a gray area, to be fair. I apologize for my prior response, it was snarky when it didn't need to be. Anyways, texture mods don't change the actual game files, rather, they put new ones in the data folder that override the ones you see in game.
---
Oh shit
---
Was it like dominos falling as they disappeared one by one?
---
I barely ever use vats at all. I‚Äôve always taken those assholes down with manual aiming and it‚Äôs always been a pain. I started using my two shot 50 cal to bring em down faster.
---
They are *never* max level because the mole miners are below 45/50
---
Its happened to me a few times, wouldnt let me remove even when it was only thing built. Had to move camp
---
they need to fix the ability to actually put mods on power armor again since the last patch before they worry about adding any new features lol
---
I think it depends on how many players attend
---
I'm getting it as well man. Both barrels. I got really frustrated and just decided to watch Netflix for a while. Maybe Hulu...
---
While fucking over a spawn is shitty, I'll grant you, it dies feel kinda nice to "join a town", as it were.  Watching purple do this during Fasnacht made me think it was kinda cool to join the neighborhood.
---
But as in most things, follow the golden rule: Don't Be A Dick About It.

&gt;First rage quit with any game in years. 
---
Hell, I rage quit after ***successfully completing the event.*** I understand you'll want to do the event because you want to experience everything in the game. But I truly believe that you really aren't missing out on anything by not doing it.  Don't take my word for it though, you'll see.
---
Taking a picture is the point + godda catch em all
---
We just need an "Activate a pylon" emote, my frail body can't handle all 3
---
Yeah. I never even got to try it on.
---
Going full two handed?
---
I think a dedicated cook would be great to have on a team. Feel free to add me on PS4, I'm Bravo1Gunner.
---
Awesome! I'm theaimpolice4
---
Watch jug‚Äôs video on 30 build tips, he mentions it there
---
No idea why you are downvoted. Killing others with your team is co op too.
---
Yep. Completely restarted AND deleted reserved space
---
Place a floor in front of where u want to rotate the wall.
---
They could add a "lock" mechanic option after placing/dropping them from your iventory
---
Delete or update youre mods
---
and has told us it's coming. very soon, too. as in the next few weeks.
---
Exactly. There need to be numerous, diverse locations and methods for farming legendaries.
---
Fast travel mats would be awesome. I always spawn 10 feet in the air and bust my ankles.
---
do you have discord for easy communication?
---
[deleted]
---
But... why?
---
Hey!  Somehow missed this earlier. I'll be on in a couple hours I had to run to some stores
---
Just happened (again) to me yesterday with a legendary glowing one inside Fort Defiance. Killed it and before I could take the legendary item, poof, gone without a trace. Has happened randomly since the launch. Probably a tough problem for them to fix, though they should try harder.
---
They need to make some walls even have TWO sides, if you try placing anything on any interior wall other than brick you better damn well want to place it on the beams otherwise the things just float there where the interior portion of the wall should be.
---
Thankfully tonight I havent crashed. Mind you I spent 4 hours making a new remote camp!
---
Are they only suppossed to fire 1 single missile down?
---
Lead and alu are the only ones worth bulking for weight savings
---
Mirelurk queens take longer for me to kill than a landed scorchbeast.
---
Absolutely! And there are many ways to do that which don't involve dropping 10 turrets 20 feet from a major spawn point.
---
I will purchase every Wallpaper because my inner Property Brother/Fixer Upper needs to be fulfilled :)
---
Must be nice...
---
For the first death there was only 2 people on the server. Me and a low level guy. The guy that killed me spawned in at some point between my checks and got me. I deserved that one.
---
All the other kills afterwards make no sense to me.
---
and complain why?
---
I see you also collected your goo before you got your med x/toxic soot flower
---
Happened to me before...I paid to "move" my camp and told it store all...worst part was I was not moving just changing design
---
So taming is different than animal pacify?
---
And there's always a dog near Tanangra Town. Would that count as a tameable animal, or does it give you a specific prompt?
---
They don‚Äôt have as much flexibility as they did in 4, but you can still build out and place things on them. They are worth playing with for sure.
---
I saw it a couple times, but wasn't until my perks and weapons were powerful enough to smoke it a one shot was I able to keep it from disappearing. Loot was...meh..
---
For $11, sure.
---
Can your p.a. be stolen if you exit it and don't immediately pick it up?
---
You guys are sad, bickering over completely broken and boring pvp. Are your dicks really that small that this matters so much to you?
---
Take a look in the mirror folks. You might be surprised at what you see.
---
And killing team alone too
---
Same. Can‚Äôt wait till that legendary vendor shows up
---
If your on PC ill buy your lead to save you some weight...
---
Basically what I just said.
---
Hows that worse?  You got a drop and they didnt...
---
GENERAL FYI in the asylum there is a One flew Over the Cuckoos Nest Easter Egg.
---
Yup same here. More insulting when you can actually see the loot window pop up and get excited by the type of weapon just a millisecond before it dissapears.
---
I don't even remember. Just got em off of dead enemies I guess. I have a 2* Troubleshooters and a 1* Troubleshooters. I just wish they would fix it so it can be over repaired.
---
This is either an Easter egg, or there is some weird lore behind it talking about how the Mr Handy's for some reason decided to keep polishing this specific car due to a weird mistake in their code
---
what a well written thoughtful reply - thank you for that!
---
I have a **Seiki SE39UY04**. The manual (p.8) shows you can access *Aspect Ratio*, but ONLY if you have the remote. Of course, my remote is in buried in storage somewhere and I've spent too many hours looking for it.
---
The menu (p.12), which I can navigate with the hard buttons, does not have an *Aspect Ratio* feature. It has a *Picture Mode*, but that's for the Dynamic/Movie/User/Standard settings.
---
Even if I do find the remote, there's no guarantee either of the listed modes (standard/wide/wide zoom/zoom) will be just right. For example, my other TV has several modes and none of them are exactly how I'd like it, which is without any stretching.
---
While it's true most TVs have a setting for this, they are not always perfect and/or there is user error (losing the remote) - which is why this feature would be very useful.
---
That's the first place I've seen it, and the place where I finally killed it.
---
Ouch. At least it doesn‚Äôt cost anything to craft those.....ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
8000 caps for a 1*exterminators wood chest piece?
---
Saw a scorched one in the cranberry bog at the fissure site near the big robot building.
---
I ran into one near abandoned bog town last night. Died several times. Then my teammate FTd in, we died again and then finally killed him. Tbh, I was just trying to find screws. Lol
---
Claim workshop after workshop on the same server, and place a bunch of turrets at each. You‚Äôll get a plan for claiming one, then periodically get more plans when your turrets defend the workshops. Or I‚Äôve noticed sometimes if I just fast travel far enough away from one that‚Äôs been taken back over by enemies, it‚Äôll pop saying I‚Äôve successfully reclaimed it. Maybe the enemies despawn if no one else is around?
---
1 star wooden wallpaper
---
Go to the landmark and find the x on the ground to get buried treasure. Its usually pretty good stuff
---
You're the guy from my math problems!

It's a treasure map. If you find the site where then x is marked and interact with it you'll get stuff

HOA is not a Raider Gang, it‚Äôs totally within our Vault-Tec charter.

Rebuild America. Turret bases are un-American.

I think it's worth ~1000. They don't get sold often, and they are broken with vats allowing both shots to hit the target.
---
I got t45 jet pack plan twice in the Encryptid event. I don't even have a t45 though.
---
I‚Äôd make another character.
---
A STR high character can swap between Shotguns, Heavy and Melee (all kinds) relatively easily. A PER or AGI build is going to have to move a ton of things around.
---
That‚Äôs kind of weird but it worked
---
My Friend with his PS4 Pro has no noticable faster and better performance then me on my regular PS4 in F76. I have a SSHD in my PS thou so im even faster then him in loading screens but thats a different Thing.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to the stone foundations that you see at the base of the log cabins.  Need those.
---
Shhhh before Bethesda sees this
---
Count me in my dude!
---
I picked up a single shot explosive railway today at the Uranium Fever event.
---
Cool. I should be back on again in a few hours.
---
As far as I know, it's only possible with brick.
---
Lay your foundation. Place a doorway wall where you want to separate rooms. Place another doorway wall on top of it (they will end up with both faces as interior, you'll be able to see the brick where they meet in the inside.) Then replace both walls with flat version, or leave for an actual doorway. *Voil√†*! You have interior walls.
---
They had them in fallout 4!! PA display stations (I don't think it was from a mod)
---
On that same note. your rare gun, ect sitting and taking space that could be sold for caps. those caps could be used to buy yet another rare weapon armor, ect later down the road. so you sell a 25k hammer, and next month you see a 25k sledgehammer... make sense? but i see your point too. 
---
or you see an awesome bloody weapon and the guy says nope can't sell it because i'm at cap limit and you have nothing he wants... that is my point. it runs both ways.  raising the cap limit doesnt affect hoarding weapons ect.. it just gives a little cushion for those who have caps and those who would sell if they could accept the caps.
---
ironically mothman and Flatwoods monster only show up for me after i fast travel to my camp
---
He will be killed by a player within 48 hours or you will log into the game and it will be dead (even though it was alive when you last logged out).  One of the two.
---
I've played on both ps4s and while PS4 pro is technically better it doesn't run especially great on either one. Just a little better on PS4 pro.
---
I picked the plan up from the responder bot in flatwoods I think I have seen it at the Charleston vendor too but not entirely sure.
---
Heads up, just youtube any treasure map. They have tutorials.
---
You can eat spoiled food regardless of what mutation you have (herbivore/carnivore). So moving this to junk would be a huge setback for some people. I have carnivore and usually just pick up plants and when they spoil eat them.
---
On xbox, Has anyone else noticed that the same few songs are playing over and over?  Its Like they took some out it seems.
---
I probably won‚Äôt return until it is as well tbh, it‚Äôs just how I play games, I play updates and additions to games in order of release etc.
---
Joking aside the weekly one is bullshit where you need to own 3 or 4 of the unstoppables costumes.
---
This happened to me the first time I did the Sheepsquatch event. What‚Äôs worse was that I was the one that initiated it...
---
Just checked my fulfillment status on the Bethesda site under my active tickets...it says it is still under "investigation on-going".
---

I have a sshd also, it does make a difference.

Wear it like a top hat, that would be pretty cool
---
&gt;"There are three known Random spawn areas on the map. Random spawn means that it‚Äôs not the same animal spawning in the same location every time."  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;There are way more than three random spawn areas.  The map is littered them.  I have tamed animals from dozens of different areas that continuously spawn random tamable creatures.   Just an FYI.
---
Please dont tell me youve been collecting the nuke codes before you launch a nuke?  
---
You only need a nuke card and the code that is available online
---
Good to know. I think the game just demands a lot from consoles. I've heard pc's even struggle to run the game efficiently.
---
A agree with the other comment, Handmade looks ak-ish, and who knows the Burrows could be where the Chinese where setting up a attack, only to find out that home didn‚Äôt tell them the bombs would go off
---
That would be good enough for me
---
I think it's just poorly optimized on a 15+ year old engine.
---
I stopped doing it weeks ago like you said it's just not worth it for me .
---
I didn't realize you didn't have to stick around and defend the workshop in order to successfully complete the "Defend Wokshop at X" style quests.
---
We don‚Äôt talk about the dark times
---
Spread the word, we will unite
---
Yeah the patch on Tuesday where they made them get affected by rifle perks seems to have enabled  them to be explosive too. Finally!
---
\*Triple-Digit Player in Power Armor comes* It‚Äôs demolition day!!!
---
Do all workshops share a loot pool or does it differ by region?
---
Place a floor or foundation on the other side. Should rotate then.
---
I was there today and the dam thing was killing the gold inside it was like omaha beach in there its just a lame thing to do and very selfish.
---
What are your main weapons?
---
Lmao. This is genius. BSG won't so the home owners assc will clean up the rif raff.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with camping at White Spring as long as you don‚Äôt put turrets up.
---
It's all good! My CAMP is a Zen Sand Garden where I destroy it myself in order to create again :)
---
Also interested! what platform are you playing on?
---
I can only talk on the tesla rifle as I have experienced the damage bug with that recently. It seems that overusing the weapon on a single server with a high fire rate on it tends to make this bug occur. I have not had this happen on any of my slower firing tesla rifles or my explosive weapons as none of them have high fire rates.
---
I have a bloodied explosive lmg, but wear dense chest and 1 fire, so explosions = 0 damage. It maybe a bug, or sounds kind of meant to be (if true). Like a stagger/drop they've added. I've seen mobs drop their guns too, thought it was random.
---
Time to start checking bags!
---
Its a Stealth Commando build so Handmade, 10mm SMG, Combat Rifle, and sounds weird but a automatic pipe rifle. (theyre surprisingly good with stealth)
---
OMG thanks for sharing üò±
---
Did you not think it didn't make sense? Or look at the pictures before buying??
---
It's almost like they want us to quit.
---
yeah, went and got the toxic soot flower and got other crap along the way, that's what got me.
---
Nice! I saw they drop now since update, what other effects you get? Too bad it's not max level
---
Its been a glitch since the last patch you cant apply loose mods and i havent found a fix for it
---
Don't use the drop button. if you use the "equip" button the PA drops but it can't be taken and it should end up back in inventory even if game crashes. emphasis on should...
---
P l e a s e
---
lol i thought nobody wants it any more, everyone is after AAE and bloodied after the nerf.
---
Just buy what ever looks good to you, especially if it‚Äôs a limited time item
---
Good to know. Thanks for the post, it's like tech data then
---
I got the ammosmith perk as soon as I could and it helped me a lot. I‚Äôm a junk hoarder, steel and lead are pretty common as well as plastic if you know what to look for
---
This is a known issue.
---
Put some points into the ammo finder perk and just farm the forest for a bit, it's not the best but there's plenty of ammo to be found. Server hop at the Fire Breather base for lead, and craft it up. It's never too late to rebuild a character.
---
Does that mean the Raider variant of the Excavator armour will be removed tonight?
---
but the right stick which is the usual examine button isn't used in workbenches.
---
You can craft any chem with psycho prefix btw. Psycho-buff and Psycho-tats counts too
---
I just got a Pro two weeks ago. I can say for sure two things; I can now turn on full UHD settings on my TV and the game looks gorgeous and has minimal input lag compared to my PS4, and I've noticed things load a little faster.
---
I say get one especially if you have a good TV or monitor.
---
Wow, didn't know that. Only got the game a few weeks ago lol
---
yeah i have scrounger... any specific places to farm straight ammo?
---
I hope so. I've always wanted to have dogmeat by my side again
---
Popped in to see what was going on after leaving in disgust. First thing I see is "we see you asked for this major QoL item so we put it in the cash shop!" Rolled my eyes, tried to log in anyway. Can't load any character. CTD on load.
---
This is not a business model that works.
---
The essential point here is that the repair kits were a basic QoL request, and no game has been wildly successful by nickel-and-diming basic quality-of-life features while the core functions are on fire. Case in point: SWTOR. Their original Freemium model was beyond anything you might call "a joke," and EA - EEEEE AAAAY, we're talking about - backed off the aggression a little. For them. Relatively speaking. 
---
Before that, it was hemorrhaging to death. Now they have a relatively steady state of their fanatic whales and casual gamblers (face reality, that's what loot boxes are), and while by normal standards their a la carte options are ridiculous, it's NOTHING like it was previously.
---
Hearing demand for a QoL feature and making it a cash shop item is a move that's part desperation and part delusion. It's this idea you can "force" people to pay more for the game to be \*less annoying.\* As opposed to quality content that makes the game \*more fun.\* Now, swtor's loot box items are popular with their playerbase - their players find them to have value. If Bethesda wanted the model that works, they would add items to the Atomic Shop that had positive value - if they had faith in themselves to do so - rather than nickel and diming people to make their own game less annoying.
---
Because Sony was ‚Äúthinking of the children‚Äù
---
When the Flatwoods monster is in the area, is there an accompanying soundtrack? Last week I was walking below a ridgeline (either somewhere in the Forest or heading west out of the bog - all I remember is that there were rockfaces and a lot of tree cover) when I heard a strange 50s sci-fi sort of sound - synth, maybe theremin. It took a second or two for me to realize it was something I'd never heard in the game, so I looked around, but the music stopped within a couple of seconds and I couldn't see anything out of the ordinary.
---
Think you need another player to kill it
---
I stopped playing because of the constant crashing since the patch, and I‚Äôm on a XB1X. Honestly though stability and performance (for me at least) has been down since the very first Wild Appalachia patch.
---
It happens when you have Wasteland Whisper or Animal Friend on, you command said Animal
---
Nah I just kill people in adventure again, survival ain‚Äôt worth the time, besides when legendary players come out I want one character so the prestige can be on him solely.
---
A dev forgot to put the dirty skin on the car model probably lol
---
Morgantown airport, and the other airport both have a few containers, as well as the military base next to the airport. Depending on your platform I'm sure you can find plenty of people that will toss ammo at you as well.
---
Great. Now they‚Äôll take that away from us too. Thanks for posting. Haha
---
Why would you announce that dude? &gt;:|
---
This for some reason reminded me of the time I got all the way to the end of the nuke silo and when it came time to insert said card, I didn‚Äôt have one...
---
This game needs stable memory. I used to run 1t command rate and it was good for awhile. Then started to get freezes at queen event. I took it back to 2T and looser timings, been good ever since.
---
I think if you log out and back on it will reset its location?
---
Hmm very interesting. I have also got a dog helmet in my inventory since launch, here‚Äôs hoping they add a pet. 
---
They would also make a fortune if they sold dog variants on the atomic store, I‚Äôd love to have a little corgi helping me out
---
what I did was to open task manager and kill 76 and the launcher then pop the launcher open and hit repair in the options tab top right
---
thx! time to have faith in XboxüòÇ
---
i get the same problem a lot and for me just restarting my laptop fixes it most of the time, sometimes it depends on whether i have my battery settings set on best battery life or best performace but i once had to go to my laptop‚Äôs graphics settings and manually tweak some settings to get it to work again
---
2nd amendment. Turrets count as guns, so saying that they're un-American means you're a communist and we don't have to listen to you!
---
Ta; will give that a go!
---
Ive done all that and all the other reddit posts i found on google. Even made a notepad file that kills fo76 too. But thanks for replying!
---
We are on the same page.
---
But I didn‚Äôt have anything tamed, nor where the perks even equipped
---
Glitch
---
The excavator armor adds only 100 pounds to your base carry weight. There is no bonus for regular power armor. Likely, it is negative, if you have any pocketed or deep-pocketed armor, since you don't get to utilize it. Get calibrated shocks on  your excavator armor to carry an additional 50 per leg.
---
I recently (earlier today) put down a keypad Pylon, and saw that the actual keypad didn‚Äôt stick to the pylon but was on the wall that I had behind it :/
---
No idea if that‚Äôs intentional or not.
---
Well, yesterday I received a drill from the sheep. Ridiculous that is even in the loot tables. They keep saying they are aware of the issue but continue to do nothing. How hard could it be to pull those from a table? An hour for your intern?
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
They had armour stands in fo4, why not just make power armour stands?
---
And now I had a whole bunch of new people know this it should have been reported to Bethesda not Reddit
---
No aid in adventure but aid isnt even worth a damn. At least if I get lead and steel I can make bullets!
---
I'm sorry it doesn't work.  the only thing I can think of is going into your program files then Bethesda then fallout then right click f076.exe and run as administrator.  only difference is you have to log in each time
---
I used to be there as well recently I've been kickout as well. Right now I am currently situated on the peaks of seneca rocks.
---
It's a bug since launch
---
What‚Äôs your psn
---
Two shot explosive guns do not drop in game anymore.
---
Thank you, I was wondering how each color looked.
---
So it should be giving me 200 or just the 100?
---
You can‚Äôt it equip either I don‚Äôt think, which makes me more curious
---
Same here. My neighborhood up there is a nice peaceful retreat after fighting monsters all day.
---
Same for me today. I use melee and i always make big damage on pvp. I hit many time my opponement without doing any damage.
---
It seems to be the only thread on the subject, so it is not a general thing.
---
I guess I have been extremely unlucky, at least I have learned to save the video if anything like this happens...
---
Yep, it is a true story. A rare bug I guess, but considering the amount of death by explosion during this event, it seems unlikely that I am the only one this happens to...
---
The issue is just a symptom of the real cause, once the legendary vendor comes out, we'll probably see a drop in these kinds of camps, until then we can only blame bethesda for horrible RNG on legendary drops.
---
Yep, I went and got my goo, got the med-x from a bin in whitesprings, jumped up to get the soot flower, got it, stopped at the train station scrapped my junk, went to my camp to make it.... goo is junk, back down to get more goo again
---
Sell unscrapped weapons, particularly larger ones. Assault rifles with mods can go for up to 70 caps a piece.
---
Deathclawalpha8
---
Caps shouldn‚Äôt be based on your level past a certain point (50, really). Maybe 3-4x your level until 50, then capped.
---
My number 1 method is crafting them with Flux and Super Duper. Second to that, take Power Plants and power up the Fusion Core Processor (if you take all 3 Plants, you'll be looking for people to sell them to). If you're on PC I'll give you some for free
---
I have only ever seen the fkatwoods monster once. I have 160 atoms waiting for this thing to be killed!
---
It‚Äôs gone already Isn‚Äôt it?
---
You can respec, I'm sorry it's not how you think it should be
---
With a full set, it should give a 100 carry weight bonus, and another 200 if you‚Äôve got Calibrated shocks on.
---
It seems to be a standard glitch, upon loading into a sever you‚Äôve got 200 instead of 100 (or 300 instead of 200), and as soon as you die, or exit the PA it will reset back to its actual carry weight bonus it should give.
---
(But don‚Äôt complain its a quite useful bug, just makes you trapped in that PA for a whole sever as a bonus, but I willingly take that XD)
---
Touch the pretty glowing pylons my child
---
Mirelurk Queens just keel over for no reason. Kinda funny when you see it.
---
How long has it been known for?
---
No one is forcing you to buy atoms. I‚Äôm 650 hours in, never bought any. You can definitely play the game without them.
---
I hit like 3 vats crits on his head and did no damage
---
Budget is typically based on complexity of the model and the textures. You happy with PA taking up 10% of your budget?
---
They should make it so that we can go to power armor stations and if there's a stash box then we can pick which power armor chassis we want from our stash. They should also make it so that it labels what we have on our power armor when we get it from the stash instead of it just saying power armor chassis, because I have 5 chassis in my stash and it can get quite confusing on which one is which.
---
No exactly what I was thinking. I was upset when I only had the 100 boost. Give me my 200 and trap me in my power armor all you want!! I'll gladly accept those rules lol
---
I believe crits ignore armor and it sounds like you got vats crit in the head. Maybe crouch next time to avoid vats
---
Since Tuesday we are hoping it will be fixed on the next update.
---
What is the proper way to server hop for these? Whenever I try nothing spawns, I hop onto a new server and still nothing, etc.
---
Also the red star pins from liberators should be wearable.
---
I know this is an unpopular opinion, but a fridge is something I wouldn't exactly mind in the Atom shop as long as it comes with extra storage space just for food.  A fridge isn't necessary for general survival in the Wasteland, but it would be great to save higher end food and drink instead of having to farm the ingredients fresh every time I want to make some and share it.
---
It is garbage. It's too easy to do and the legendary enemies suck. 
---
Rarely do I get a 3 star legendary uranium fever boss and when I do, I get body armour
---
The best way to get a lot of cores is to take over a power plant and put up one of the huge, blue generators (the one that produces 100 power), and come back every so often to grab them (maximum of 3). Make sure you lock the fusion core generator or every Tom, Dick, and Harry can take them. A lot of players won't bother trying to unlock them cause they'll get a wanted status, and there are several players who will hunt the wanted. Then there are those who just don't care and will do it anyway, but they're far and few in between. Just defend it every so often to keep it and you'll have more fusion cores than you csn count. Good luck ‚ò∫
---
I also have weapons!! :)  http://imgur.com/a/zj7sAw7
---
Recipes for serums can be a rare drop from SBQ, and the mutations can be grinded by just heavily irradiatiing yourself, and just using a rad away if you don‚Äôt like the given radiation.
---
But in all other cases, you have to buy them from the Enclave or a Player vendor (not a robot actual player selling them) or just buy the plans at the Enclave
---
I totally caught myself pulling a "well back in my day" talking about that with some newer players I was helping out.  Lol
---
They are because you can always swap them out when you run across said terminal or safe.  And use whatever useful perks in those categories when your just traveling around.
---
the worst I've had attacking or threatening in the area is a swarm of bees..luckily I had a can of Raid ;)
---
They have nothing to do with the owners collecting legendaries though. The owner of this one wasn't even around and never did show up. Their turrets kill the spawns faster than the owner could tag each one even IF they were there. It's not to farm, it's to troll. IF they are to farm, the owners have to be the dumbest people alive.
---
Well, it is identical to a 84S down to every detail, including the ammo-type. And yes, it looks AK-ish because the 84S is a Chinese AK-variant.
---
I seem to remember it being 200 originally, though I may be wrong.
---
I cant loot bodies when the scorched earth event is on
---
I am enjoying the game, and it keeps getting better.
---
There are numerous things that either have or continue to take up 10% of a budget. Why not PA? Further, if I can have my PA hang around in my house for 60 seconds and not have the game crash, I can see zero reason to not let us have a display.
---
It should give you everything for free lol. That's alot of work put into charisma buddy. IMO I haven't noticed a huge difference without the perks that lower prices. And rarely see any difference when taking grape mentants on top of the perks.. I could be wrong though
---
Nuke your camp!
---
My decontamination shower and nuclear reactor beg to differ.  Also fyi, it might just be me, but since the last patch no more warning that your base is under attack.   By the time I realized two lovely gentlemen had basically ripped my base a new one for no reason.
---
It‚Äôs still satisfying
---
That shit so funny, upvote lol hahaha
---
I will most definitely be turning on cannibal during this event now!! /s
---
Also had a legendary ghoul blow up on me like a robot after i killed it
---
I had an Enormous Sloth as a pet at my camp. He only lasted about 4 days. Then I got adopted by a Radstag. He liked to live under my house and poke his head through the floor. He didn't last long either. Now I want a cat.
---
I killed a three star ghoul in the swamp by Watoga. Bamf.
---
This is literally the only answer that is helpful here
---
So far no luck but thanks for the suggestion, going to mess around with this some more though.
---
Well just makes sure to server hop when you lose the bonus, it‚Äôll be back on the next server you jump onto!
---
I can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve done that! Too many but hell is it useful!
---
Can someone confirm this? I thought they retracted that
---
Potted plants have a plan that you can learn by purchasing it from the responders vendors.
---
in addition to picking up wood you also can have a lot of items that contain wood that you can scrap which is probably going to be quicker than running around through the forest.
---
if you want random players to find your home then it needs to be in some of the heavier traffic areas.
---
player vending is a new feature that has not been added yet and will not be until May
---
there are tons of flat areas around the map to use but I would recommend also being near a water supply like a river or a pond since it's easier to get dirty water that way.
---
computer terminals all sorts of things depending on what you hook up to it. You probably should just YouTube that!
---
Hell yeah!!
---
Thanks for the input. My decision was in the air hanging on my tax return and seeing how this initialize goes. I did upgrade my TV last month, but I'm not sure if it supports UHD. Just having a larger TV makes a significant difference to me.
---
Is this a serious question? I'm pretty sure with all the duping and how unbalanced they were bethesda said those two legendary rolls won't drop together anymore.
---
Trying to get those assaultron boards on the cheap?? If you get a sweet deal on them you could make good money under cutting the vendor bots! Probably the best you can do is test it will everything that lowers prices and again with no boost. Keep us posted. üòÅ
---
"Bay Skyrim human or i kill you!"
---
Aux is usually 3.5
---
I mean, sure, but I‚Äôd rather they fix the mods for it and added legendary variations first.
---
Thanks to all the responses, I have learned there are other uses for spoiled food.
---
Yeah, and then they crossed it out with strike through
---
Oh I hadn't noticed that my apologies. I haven't seen or heard of anybody I play with seeing one drop since they said that
---
Would be nice if they would be nuked, was in a server where 6+ people were hanging around there and a nuke came close but didn't hit it sadly.
---
I remember a Regular Show episode following a similar story. Benson gets his car window smashed and asks mordecai and Rigby to fix it.
---
They ask muscleman who asks a guy to make one for them.
---
They fit it back onto the car, the entire car explodes later on in the show but the window remains intact without a scratch
---
I thought that too, but i got a tse minigun of a ghoul way after tse nerf
---
Oh well I'm sorry for the misinformation. It  seems they cut the possibility of one dropping way down though
---
Where did you see these?
---
Cheers, chief!
---
Can you specify one of these flat areas perhaps, though? Again, thank you for your help!
---
Yeah I guess, still yet to really use mine
---
Some guy repeatedly bothered me at my own base, standing in my face as I‚Äôm planning out where I want to place things.  
---
When I wouldn‚Äôt accept his group request, he killed my (already nearly dead, tbh) Brahmin. Kept getting in my face. Then threw an artillery grenade at my base when I continued to ignore his group requests. Lol.  
---
I was laughing as I logged out and logged back in, making him waste a cool down. Level 10 supermutants did more to my base than he did.
---
He left the game after that. ü§ó
---
If you‚Äôre worried about your base getting fiddled with, switch servers. If the people follow you, report and block them.  
---
You could also hit ‚Äòmove camp‚Äô and place it to keep your spot but quick-hide and blueprint your base.
---
Same
---
It‚Äôs more than that. My testing has given a cap somewhere between 50-70%, but it‚Äôs hard to know for sure. Takes ~10 shots to reach the cap
---
&gt;Well, yesterday I received a drill from the sheep. Ridiculous that is even in the loot tables. 
---
BINGO!   And this is not the first time this has happened and Bethesda has been repeatedly warned to do something about this literally hundreds of times.
---
 If other people enjoy the game still good for them. Have fun. But I think I've had all I can take.
---
How do you polish rust? - Codsworth 2015
---
It is likely that your friends (who cannot see it) are running one or more MODS -- whenever the game is updated, they need to update a custom ini file with new texture information from the game or else their mods will not load the new graphics of the items added to the shop.  This is my guess.
---
It's so frustrating, too. I wish if when you first load into a server nothing could attack you until you hit a button or something.
---
Can confirm: watched a protection spawn in at Watoga, take three steps, then die.
---
Hi jims! Love seeing posts like this! Do you have plans or can you craft T-51b armor? I need a left arm...
---
Well that depends on how close you want to be to players for them to find you!  A lot of people like to build near White springs because there's a lot of flat area but that's completely up to you.  I personally have built my camp in the cranberry bog but it's a little bit dangerous!
---
I've had loading screens continue to be on my screen for half a minute after I could hear things shooting in the backgroud, "load" in and I'm dead. Yaaay. 
---
Doesn't happen as much anymore, but still occasionally.
---
Guess No Fight Today
---
This!!
---
Alright, thank you.
---
I don't recall the size rn but I would agree. It would be cool to have one be an event at a random location to either dispell it or spawn it.
---
Is no-one else experiencing this issue?  I logged in this morning and still saw the problem, so it seems to be this way until 2 hours have passed and then the textures start to look normal for that login session.
---
It's coming
---
I wish you could display them and have them pode
---
There's been a few subs about it. Right now attaching mods are broken...only crafted ones work..thanks to the latest patch
---
Same perks shared don't stack. Max discount I've ever got is 25%. So I think your base CHA of 15 should see that achieved.
---
I pretty much try to get onto the tallest thing around and pray nothing saw me before I got there lol
---
They just nerfed the tse's.  They still drop apparently.  I'm level 165 and farm a lot. I have never found one. 4 explosive guns and maybe 12 two shots. Never a tse. 
---
If you want one your best bet is to hit the trading subs.
---
I've seen the community rep reply to people that the dev team are aware so I think we've done all we can
---
Wait am I in /r/EliteDangerous ? This criticism is so familiar...
---
For real.
---
Also is it just me or none of the vendors at WS are holding ANY mods...not any of them?  I still have to fast travel all over the place checking what mods are in vendor inventories...seems to defeat their purpose don't ya think?
---
its cool, it was a freakout day on the reddit lol so it sticks in memory
---
Same here, it's all junk and i don't farm them so might as well keep them till i can sell them to the vendor.
---
After a lot of experimenting I figured out tamed creatures are attracted to your camp device itself. If you want it out just put the camp device outside where you want it to be. Not on or near any foundations or they could walk into one before it loads. Then just leave the cell and come back or relog and it should be patrolling the device.
---
I go after mega sloths and they are notoriously buggy for spawning into a foundation and dying. The only way I keep mine alive is to keep him away from my foundations. Figured this out the hard way.
---
Yes, and no... Every once in awhile if you pop a level 3 safe you'll get some decent goodies such as plans or something like that but later on once you reach higher levels and have yourself geared out and several plans that you have been looking for the time that and takes the swap the perc card in and out when you encounter is safe just really isn't worth it in my opinion. 
---
TLDR: at the beginning of the game yes later on in the game no.
---
Bloatfly ...whatever they're called, too. I want to make the Bloatfly mod on the syringer, but keep forgetting they scrap.
---
Sounds like a great area, especially for trading! Thanks for your help, chief!
---
That‚Äôs what survival is for
---
Beaily Family cabin is one spot.  I gotta think they‚Äôll eventually add the log cabin walls and stone foundation you see at that camp.
---
Thanks seems that's my only choice for one as never even seen one but some trade subs are asking 10k plus caps
---
Are you in Pacifist mode?
---
Great idea! I prefer this because it adds quests
---
Yet here you are. The irony is palpable
---
Nuke is hot. Join gt is same as here.
---
I'll check that out. Thanks!
---
It helps to be on a semi-stable server. It also helps if you get there ASAP, so it can take a minute to load, and not have to worry about it loading in the middle of the fight. Sucks because I like to drop my junk before I get there so no one steals it if I die, but NOOOOO. &gt;\_&gt;
---
Definitely a freak out day
---
Yep. I don't usually attack first.
---
Bethesda has a pretty consistent track record of completely ignoring any reported issues, at least if everybody starts doing it it's more likely to become a problem they need to address. They completely ignored things like the artillery dupe until people were selling hundreds of the exact same TSE handmades and combat shotguns for $15 each on ebay
---
Nuka-cola probably, if it's like Coca-Cola and I've heard it can aid in removing rust. So, i dunno.
---
That'd be so cute.
---
Tse's aren't the meta anymore. You can find them under 5k. Pistol tse's are even cheaper.
---
I‚Äôm new too (lvl 10) and the community is very helpful. Game is a lot of fun and very addicting once you get into it. I can‚Äôt seem to put it down and I stopped playing my other games lol
---
i will pay 15k for the elder paint
---
If you're looking for a tightly balanced MMO that you'll play for thousands of hours you'll be disappointed. 
---
If you're looking for $11 of Fallout fun you'll be pleased.
---
It's sooooooooooooo nice. Before I'd be lucky to hit half the vendors in a play session. Now I can actually make those 1400 caps a day.
---
The ‚ÄúLight Wood Laminate‚Äù Floor is definitely worth it.
---
Lol get rekt. Has to use stealthboy to get a kill lol
---
I always did the inverted, for what it's worth.
---
The stuff I'm kind of chasing out of those level 3 are the potential plans etc.
---
Lower levels, if possible, I'd personally recommend aiming for the damage output etc. Not to mention you can get lucky with perk packs &amp; not have to spendy any points (I got all 3 lockpicking via Packs on my alt). 
---
But that's what makes these games great, to each their own own, nothing is inherently wrong.
---
No picking on bricky!
---
I wouldn't know, I don't go into whitesprings resort to do my selling.
---
Suggested this to Bethesda the first week the game launched...  haven't seen anything from them regarding it, so I resolved that they wouldn't do anything about it.  lol
---
I have 6....never get around to launching a nuke
---
LMG- solid per bullet damage (almost as much as 50cal after patch 7), crazy fire rate, good accuracy, hard to control recoil if sustained firing. Small (for a heavy) ammo capacity. VERY expensive to keep loaded with ammo. 
---
50cal- all-around champ. Good damage,  good rate of fire, decent accuracy, controllable recoil, good ammo capacity. Easy to craft large amounts of ammo, although it‚Äôs relatively heavy ammo. 
---
Mini gun- I don‚Äôt use it. Poor per-bullet damage, very high ROF, poor accuracy, controllable recoil. Spin-up time makes it annoying to use regularly. Large ammo capacity, cheap to craft and light ammo. 
---
Gatling gun- my trash-mob bread‚Äôn‚Äôbutter. High damage, LOW rate of fire (can be improved with a receiver mod, and a 25% fire rate legendary makes it quite reasonable.) First shot is almost sniper rifle levels of accurate when aiming down sights. Sustained fire is still pretty accurate. Good ammo capacity upgradable to large, although I wouldn‚Äôt personally bother (more weight and less durability for a not-very-useful-on-this-Gun ammo boost). Cheap and light ammo. Thanks to the high damage/low ROF, it‚Äôs very ammo and repair efficient. 
---
Feel and sound like an anti-aircraft cannon when trying to shoot down SB.
---
On ps4, unable to mod weapons as well.
---
Here is proof.

You were on a team with matryoshka doll, who was attacked by the wanted person. Matryoshka returned fire which made you and anyone else on your team immediately eligible to kill.
---
I did this, too! I had a whole garage full of them and miss being able to display all the types I found.
---
I have a bunch saved up. I'll try and find you.
---
could be great i would love to kill ghoul with a crowbar and a trash can lid
---
To be fair Bethesda, this won't do. Working towards? It was working fine. You REALLY need to get this thing stable and bug-free before we see any fancy new content. Basics first.
---
It turns into tame instead of pacify. They're random event spawns though, they're not any creatures that are always anywhere. They're specific low levels. I've yet to see one over level 30.
---
Yeah, I got a 70 in Samsung last year. It's not top of the line, but it's big. The input lag with the PS4 on the highest TV settings meant I had to play in ugly "game mode"  which doesn't look as good. The PRO seems to fix that issue. Now, I just need that LG B8 and I'll be happy.
---
well thats the very same problem that OP is having just with less being visible. It is being loaded into the game and being attackable before loading has finished and one can move.
---
What I am advocating for is solving this problem entirely by taking longer loading times in turn for having the server finish loading you completely before anything happening.
---
I feel like adding display racks is definitely something that is gonna be added at some point
---
You are not alone. Been like this since the latest hot fix.
---
The other day my game told me that my nuke code expired... But I'm low level and never did any nuke quest stuff. I killed a couple of beeping guys and got some nuke quest items, but that's it. What did the message mean?
---
Depends on what you're into. I love camp building so I've bought just SO much for my camp. But if you like want to have a cool looking power armor, or certain outfit to show off to others, then that's good too.
---
There are some things that just clearly overpriced. What do.you have your eye on?
---
Doesn't prove anything if it's already accessible in the game through a different mechanic
---
I like this idea. If it could be done putting foundation on 'floors' which doesn't seem to be to complicated.
---
Its just random. I've found one TSE gun in my entire playing time. It wasn't good, too low leveled. so I sold it. 
---
Just grind the normal 2 star plus legendary spots or try to trade. If people will part with them.
---
Where the hell do you even get Digested Goo? I've been playing casually since beta and never seen it.
---
Uhm just wanna say we havent seen serum recipes drop from the queen since they became avalable at the enclave vendor.
---
Give me the fucking keys you fucking cocksucking motherfucker!
---
I had a Radstag adopt me. He lived under my house. He would stick his head up through the floor. He only stayed a few days.
---
This happened to me too, on PC. Restarting the launcher and game fixed it.
---
Lmao give him a break, he loves the game
---
Nobody can
---
but belief me you're not the only one...
---
1. the sentinel effect takes 1-2 seconds to kick in (like invisible fx on chameleon armor)... sometimes it takes a little longer... sometimes it doesn't work until you move and stand still once again.
---
2. There are so many methods out there to penetrante SA armors... take it as a worst case insurance... betting your last penny on it wouldn't be wise in my opinion.
---
Graphics card?
---
Just add a ‚Äúlock‚Äù feature to player crafted Power Armor stations. 
---
Having the station in ‚Äòlocked‚Äô mode would make it so only the owner has access to the Power Armor suit that is placed within it. The station would still be accessible to use to other players - just not the suit that is equipped to the station.
---
The locking feature would only be accessible by the owner of the CAMP in which it was placed to avoid griefers placing unwanted stations at other player CAMPs.
---
Power Armor stations found in the wild would not be allowed to be player locked and act as they currently are set.
---
Yea hard bargain 3 and a grape mentat,  I can't get it to get cheaper then that bo matter what else I use
---
Stuck between the light wood laminate or the dark wood laminate at the moment.
---
I‚Äôll do the Line in the Sand event near Watoga occasionally (2 free fusion cores) and I grab them from fusion generators when I find them and I generally have more than I need. If I get low I‚Äôll grab a couple of low power ones from watoga power armor chassis.
---
Exactly plus I was spending close to 60 caps in travel
---
One violent night is still ok. A bit on the easy side
---
Hopefully they add NPCs in the future. The game is still new and imo it‚Äôs just getting better. They can just keep adding stuff.
---
Well you can easily have better specs on a computer than a console so would say yes.
---
Also people have been speculating theres more younger players on console than on pc. If youre looking to avoid that.
---
This made things worse but easy enough to put back. Unless i missed something. Im not the most computer literate. Thanks for your response!
---
Good to know. Thank you. I was going off of a few YouTubers and from my own experiences in those specific spots. My best luck has by far been Cranberry Glades.
---
Doesn‚Äôt override the ability for property owners / managers or local ordinance (else there wouldn‚Äôt be gun-free zones). Also, turrets do not count as guns and I‚Äôd fight any commie scum who wants to call a turret base a well-regulated militia!
---
GUYS I FOUND TIMMY
---
Hmm, I have both and I think the light wood looks better in the end. But also depends your camp, theme you're going for etc.
---
I know I tried to have my friend attach it for me but it didn‚Äôt work for him either.
---
The carpet doesn‚Äôt match the drapes what?
---
 I've been having that happen to me on PS4 as well.
---
oh I'm sorry I don't know any other way than just uninstall and reinstall.  good luck and I hope you can get back in soon
---
This is happening to me too on PC after the last patch.
---
Aren't there two suits and head pieces not counting the fedora?
---
underrated post
---
Might get both since I have the atoms üòÇ means I can style the rooms
---
Toss your perk layout (current) into Nukes N Dragons and let us know what cards you have; then post it here.
---
Where are chickens at?
---
Oh damn seriously? I've never got any but I def saw others get them. Well I'll be damned, that's a bit bs
---
I seem to get them often from farming Whitesprings. Ghouls sometimes carry. Otherwise Wade airport, two power armor spawns.
---
Yea...I‚Äôm talking about the imposter head and imposter outfit, sry I didn‚Äôt specify..üòä
---
I‚Äôve seen him twice at Whitesprings
---
You want us to read inside the vault for you???
---
Can‚Äôt remember the last time I picked a lock or hacked a terminal. I just stopped at some point.
---
Lol :D
---
Bruh so check this out I‚Äôm lvl 166 and I‚Äôm a bloodied pure build with melee mutations going against lvls 70-100 in pvp and I had an anti armor power fist and a bloodied death claw I know I got crit hits on both of them and they took like an inch of health from both hits they def need to nerf or balance this shit out????
---
I don‚Äôt know what that is
---
It should be a one shot wonder weapon again. Frankly it‚Äôs current form is insultingly bad
---
Nope, it should be something you need to make a Chinese solider outfit, cloth, red pin
---
Might help to look at audio drivers? I had been getting hard crashes and complete system freezes occasionally since launch but not often enough to do much about. After the patch that added Fasnacht Day they got much worse. Updating my graphics driver didnt help, verifying the gmame files didn't help. I went through my installed programs and found I had a free version of Razer Surround which I never used. Uninstalled that and the freezes and hard crashes haven't happened since (still get disconnects from servers occasionally). I figure FO76 didn't like its driver.
---
yup, it's been in the build menu for a several weeks i think, but can't be used yet :/
---
agreed.  also huntign rifle needs 50 cal.
---
combat rifle needs different ammo types.
---
and so on.  and more storage space
---
Yeah I use if for my main areas, then the dark for like kitchen, workshops and outdoor decking
---
Crafting perks?
---
This. I did a bunch of testing during patch 6, and someone pointed me towards testing while bountied. Electric Charge would enable PvP if the attacker was Wanted. 
---
Yes, I‚Äôd call it a bug.
---
Exactly, lol
---
Asked early because I don‚Äôt want to have a crappy build lol (currently lvl 10)
---
I thought of that.  I have full armorer perk.
---
I normally do that but for some reason my base got demolished and I never got a message saying that my base was under attack. Because of that my decontamination shower MA nuclear reactor which I keep a very well hidden were taken out. It was just frustrating as all because I used to be able get those messages and just do exactly what you're telling me to but it seems like after the last patch may be there something that changed?
---
Fusion core farming has been severely nerfed since launch.  Less likely to spawn in generators and when you find them inside power armor chassis they are only 25 percent. 
---
One reason in a list of dozens for why I have not logged on to the game for several days.
---
Kind of got sick of it.
---
This would be also great for marketing with camp vendors. Think of it coming to a camp that has all these power armor and outfits in front to display like a real store.
---
Nope. Gun racks too, along with regular armor stands
---
Bethesda pls
---
I'll give this a try then. Thank you for the help!
---
No worries, just a game. I appreciate it.
---
I got that once, it said my workshop has been over running by sheepsquatches. This was actually 2 weeks ago, before the last update
---
Especially Anthem at the moment lol
---
you're welcome.  thanks for the appreciation
---
ill do that for sure later but its a joke currently... literally speced for commando(build) and rifleman(prev build) YOUVE BEEN WARNED
---
Unyielding has 3 levels. The highest level kicks in at 20%, which synergies best with a bunch of other 20% mark things like nerd rage, Emergency Protocols, max bloodied and Adrenal Reaction damage. That‚Äôs why so many people hover around 20% in bloodied builds.
---
Yeah thats why I posted it. Things should work the way the say they work. We seem to be playing a game where nothing works the way it's meant to.
---
Imagine 3 assualtron sheepsquatch coming in the first wave
---
Yup same here but it isn't a problem for normal floors just the atom shop floors. A fix for this would be greatly appreciated
---
I'm the same boat. If I get banned my gf and I will both stop and won't start new games. That and also the hassle of having to fix stuff after every update. Hopefully Bethesda implements it in game
---
its a game mechanic I dont like greifing but some casual canabalism isnt gonna ruin the game for anyone
---
Floating houses are an eye sore prove me wrong
---
No no wallpaper 700 atoms each.
---
Whoosh
---
As soon as floors or foundations build a ‚Äúfull circle‚Äù meaning the last foundation or floor touches the first one (every floor or foundation is connected from at least two sides) it will give you this message and wont let you delete them anymore. It has been like that feom launch.
---
This. Especially if you pick up a legendary that is the same type as one you already have. Got a ghoul-slayer axe, but picked up a executioner axe? You might see the graphic for the ghoul-slayer again.
---
Yet another bug.
---
This looks like the assembly of drones in Ironman 2. Great stuff. 
---
We need a hotrod red paint scheme.
---
Look won't lie kind of sick of waiting for people to activate the pylons so i usually end up doing all three and spamming stim-paks till the end of the event, i don't think people realise that you do near to no damage against the impostor when its in stealth
---
I should‚Äôve posted the link. Shit still has me in stitches. 
---
https://youtu.be/leeP6LgM8H0
---
You can make more, so it‚Äôs not one and done
---
Dropping a nuke on the base doesn't get you wanted. I may have done this a few times.
---
I meant, using...lol
---
I wouldn't recommend eating any power armor.
---
Definitely meant using
---
Make sure to run the game diagnostic report and attach it to a ticket on bethesda.net
---
The response time is usually pretty reasonable and they will offer suggestions to fix the issue if they find anything.
---
That one vault entrance is looking pretty green...
---
I have to do 3 challenges to "hit rock bottom" which is a single challenge for what, thirty or forty atoms? I actually mostly played to do the daily challenges so I have atoms for when I can devote longer periods to the game (vacation and such). I've overall actually reduced my playtime because after farming weapons to flog to vendors, there's no or few reasonably achievable challenges, so I stop playing and go do something else
---
There are 3 silos so you can always try again lol.
---
I just see people farming caps they go to the event and they just wait for people to die
---
Using is another story... excavator is the only one with a unique "perk" being attached, that of getting more resource from mining nodes.
---
T60/T51B/X01/Ultracite all have better overall stats vs excavator and can make use of the jet pack everyone had a hard on for a few months back.
---
Can't relate to this post because my anger in frustration didn't come from failing the quest, but successful completion of it. 
---
As per Bethesda's usual marketing tactics, this event was endlessly hyped as a super-challenging endgame content with a great payoff. 
---
Most people quickly found that it's none of that.
---
Defenses are way better on X01 and t51b. X01 is great for rads and energy. T51b great for ballistic and energy.
---
How Kong has this game been out?
---
Yeah. I killed a Angler once only for this to happen. I then remembered about reading about this and decided to search the area when the Angler popped out of
---
I ended up finding him after several minutes
---
Because Assaultron and aforementioned Death Star Laser spamming
---
A lot of stuff like curved walls and even simple structures that don‚Äôt work but should can be accomplished with some snapping tricks.
---
I recommend watching Jug‚Äôs YouTube videos! He shares a lot of great tips and techniques for advanced building workarounds.
---
T60 has a tad over 500 damage resistance energy and radiation and it‚Äôs the cheapest to repair
---
I used to build a base on the fairway with crafting stations so people could run over to dump loot and repair. I always kept it far enough from the spawns to not aggro anything that someone didn't bring to it. Most people liked not having to run all the way back to the resort.
---
Ahh a true intellectual I see
---
"...instead of rolling the dice for a good roll."

It‚Äôll bust the economy. I know people with 12 accounts with five characters per an account with max caps on each. Doesn‚Äôt do them any good but if they made max even higher he would fill them all up and just charge outrageous amounts because he can. Already if you want to buy Sentinel Assassin BoS armor you better have two accounts at max caps because minimum price is 50k. If one account could hold a 100k that‚Äôs how much those armor pieces would be but since cap max is 25k it just gets annoying bringing out other characters to do the trade and what not his causing the market to be not insane.
---
100
---
Same problem, but only with certain mods. Machette sacrifical mod for example. No idea why.
---
Assaultrons cut the grass with laser beam precision.
---
that‚Äôs the exact mod i‚Äôve been most focused on :(
---
Do u still have the extra  plans
---
Yep that's it.
---
I took that place last night. Two level 80 scorched beasts attacked.
---
I just left the server.
---
Very nice. Mine is very similar, almost like a little community
---
Let‚Äôs take a moment to break down your moronic response here, because it‚Äôs quite stupid. I‚Äôm actually impressed.
---
First, ‚Äúyet here you are‚Äù. This makes literally no sense in context. Nothing I said makes me a hypocrite for being here, which is obviously what you‚Äôre trying to imply. I‚Äôm not bickering over bad pvp and trying to show off how good I am on the internet.
---
Next, ‚Äúthe irony is palpable‚Äù. Is it really? Because it kind of just feels like you‚Äôre parroting that phrase, like 100%. Calling people out for bickering isn‚Äôt ironic. Those guys are, in fact, acting quite sad, and somebody aught to tell them don‚Äôt you think? :)
---
Try to think before you speak, or in this case type.
---
Yep. 
---
Server Not responding. Controls have been disabled. 
---
And......
---
9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2
---
1
---
Server disconnected.
---
Well you definitely can get them but you shouldn‚Äôt have them as permanent cards in your build. Use them whenever you need them and then switch back to perks that help you in combat for example.
---
If they are red, and you have that mutation that does damage to them, it does initiate combat. Doesn't if they're white, that was patched, but your mutation doing damage to a red still initiates. You can see it in the video, the blue lightning goes off, then you are red to him and he can do full damage.
---
I think it's just no damage. I tried a nocturnal explosive gatling plasma at it while it was night time (easily over 100 damage per hit), I saw the health bar go down and it went all the way back up to 100%  when I stopped shooting, similar to the damage bug before it was patched. When we had all the pylons, I killed it pretty much by myself with one core.
---
Does taming another animal help?
---
same thing happened to me at the powerstation in the mire, the day before the update
---
Soon atomic shop item.... too soon?
---
Keep it lore and code friendly: how about a Mr. Handy instead?
---
And make the notes legible as well.  I shouldn‚Äôt have to put my face up to my 64 inch screen and still squint to read a note.
---
Its just server lag. He is shooting him there locally but serverside the person wasn't there anymore. Thats why the hp keeps bobbing up and down. Client says hp should be this, server says no its this, client updates.  
---
The other guy was probably experiencing a similar thing on his side. The server just registered his hits forst.
---
In terms of utility? No. Exacavator has +100 carry weight when you have the ENTIRE set equipped, and doubles any mining yields with both arms equipped. You can stack that with any other body mods and calibrated shocks.
---
Some power armors have better resistances than excavator, although at that high of a level you're really just fighting over scraps. The difference in damage is a couple percentage points at most. 
---
However, the four main power armors can have a jet pack applied to them. It's a nice novelty, but doesn't serve too much of a purpose aside from a few niche situations. It also drains your AP way too quickly. If you want any serious flying done, you need to keep downing canned coffee or nuka colas
---
I know as a community we‚Äôre supposed to help each other and stuff but this is just lazy. There are tons of information online. In the time you made this post you could‚Äôve done a simple google search and you‚Äôd have all information you want.
---
Well it is challenging if you ignore the entire mechanics of it. /s
---
I didn't though really make the post to fuel Bethesda bashing. Regardless of your thoughts on that please keep that circle jerk to another thread.
---
Wow that last one hit hard.
---
I read that book for the first time like what, six or so years ago? And I know this meme has existed for a long, LONG time even before that. Makes me feel so old, rip
---
Rad X just turns it ‚Äòoff‚Äô for while. No it‚Äôs fine, I didn‚Äôt think there was a way.
---
Ive got a fedora for sale .......
---
Seems like it was probably client and server lag and miscommunication. The reason the other guys hp was bobbing up and down is the server was registering him as somewhere else and the shots weren't connecting. 
---
The player was probably still on his screen but the server might still be registering him as moving. But by staying still constantly eventually the other guys client and server would align and he would kill him easily. The other guy was moving around making the server and client miscommunicate on where the other player actual was.
---
I'd kill for that Chinese commando hat from Fallout 3. They already have most of the model with the lifted hunting cap!
---
It's used so that you can differentiate between characters.
---
Last laugh
---
Haha they think outside the box. Kids gonna go wild when they find out we programmed breaks for em!
---
I love taking out the adds in that fight, they‚Äôre ignored so that‚Äôs lots of xp for me
---
I actualy like this better. 100% yes
---
All dumb little kids, i heard them many times on their open mics with their moms screaming at them in the background while they ‚Äòomg omg another one‚Äô. No adult would do this.
---
Thanks, I've added you!
---
You're the 400th person to post a new thread about this in the past week.  We know.
---
^This. X01 is great for nuke zones while t51 is pref for silos etc
---
Sentinel is easily defeated in PvP. I'd guess it has more to do with the play base being more informed than it does with anything breaking it.
---
I'd love to see this. Often when I'm grouped I want to talk to the people nearby, but needing to tell my group 'switching to local chat brb' then fumble in the menu, then talk, then switch back is getting tedious. There's some good people out there I'd like to be able to speak to when grouped.
---
I sent you a friend invite. If I catch you/him I'll join up and craft you a nice set of armor/underarmor.
---
I had plans today so I wasn't on till later.
---
Yeah, this is exactly the kind of place Google should point **at** if the question is answered well. It's like nobody is allowed to ask questions here any more.
---
Another thing you can do, is store your shower when you‚Äôre not using it.  
---
That‚Äôs one of the more ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù things to fix that people aim for.
---
ü§£ üêî üçó üêìü§Ø
---
I have another one that will get to you, Sutton station has only 5 cars in the carpark, some different car brands/models all painted in the exact same blue
---
We need a stronger alien blaster too. Maybe they should reintroduce the Fallout 3/NV version as a more powerful variant, perhaps through a quest, event, or challenge.
---
Yep I forgot I had armour on that had a 50% chance to revive. So it revived me... and the 'nade killed me.
---
Perk card taken off and forgotten about.
---
The giant pitcher plants. You have a short window after it opens but before it sprays rads at you to harvest it.
---
Or for adding big water purifiers
---
I just want wood legendaries out of the legendary list
---
Yeah noticed this too (xbox).
---
Accept no substitute.
---
what the hell is the meta now?
---
It's used for Overdrive, too. Every time I accidentally scrap the stuff, my poor junkie of a character twitches.
---
First thing I would do is try to put the large water purifier in the pond to see if It would work 
---
I‚Äôve found a good spot, but no water source...
---
Prices don't change past 20 charisma.
---
I can get behind that
---
I hope Bethesda blocks off base building in that exact spot before they make C.A.M.P.s invulnerable to people playing in Pacifist Mode. 
---
Otherwise we may just see a crazy rise in turret C.A.M.P.s when noobs and low-skill players see nothing can stop their selfish Ghoul-spawn killing ways.
---
It's because he's wanted and you have electrically charged. That's **always** been the exploit and how it causes PVP. You're getting downvotes because you're claiming it wasn't because of electrically charged. Further, he two shot you. There's only certain conditions where you can 1 shot players, like if they're not topped out on health. You weren't. If damage cap is near 200, you have 20 rads, and the initiating shock takes 10 HP, that's close to a full HP bar for many players.
---
Hey come on down to Fenricks! I have a lot of dead scorched on my porch all the time
---
This is *one of* the reasons I don't PVP.
---
Well first off I don‚Äôt do pvp don‚Äôt even know where you‚Äôre seeing me talk about pvp, this has been a general issue where even a level 1 scorched takes out way more hp off me in one hit with over 400 ballistic resistance lonewander and full sentinel gear while standing still or noticing my stabilized mod doesn‚Äôt load this is a statement of things not working overall, not me saying I‚Äôm getting killed in pvp
---
Especially if you have good mutations and herbivore
---
Well fuck. I've just been avoiding those things because I never saw them as lootable, just "traps" for rad poisoning.
---
Same same
---
Wrecking ball 3 with TSE combat shotgun
---
Yeah i know i currently have 6 in my inventory, just been lucky and havent actually seen any of these bases in a long time
---
Last patch broke all mods. Wait for fix.
---
I am being sarcastic. Sorry. I was searching reddit for something in FO76 and read a little of the thread. For as much attention as this got , no one from Bethesda commented or said they would look into it or try to help and it bothered me. They should care that there is a need..and should help all people in the gaming community.
---
I mean why would people play adventure then? Classic just sounds like easier mode. 
---
I guess if new characters had to be made. But even then what would balance it out? Survival has more risk/ reward. While adventure is more casual. Classic would just be easier mode with no disadvantages.
---
Yeah that's not true. There's too many hug fixes to count, along with new quests and daily events. You missed a hell of a good tims in Fasnacht though. That event was only open for a week or two.
---
Sentinel is rampant in PvP. That's the connection I erroneously made.
---
But Scorched that melee you almost automatically stagger you, so if you're getting hit into a stagger that'll do it. You'll take full damage then. I have stabilized mods and they're working fine
---
Seriously.
---
That damn vendor needs to get here like last week.
---
I didn‚Äôt even think about it for water purifiers.
---
If I see that I'll destroy it and have my friends claim my bounty for breaking shit lol
---
I‚Äôve done the event twice and still have no idea what to do besides kill things. Doesn‚Äôt help that the message alerts for the pylons didn‚Äôt pop up until after the event is over (it‚Äôs a bit laggy right now). Part of the problem is that the event is broadcast to everyone and they fast travel there without knowing anything about it. I haven‚Äôt started the Low quest yet. 
---
I think it‚Äôs a problem that will iron itself out in a week or two as people become more familiar with the event. 
---
But relying on randoms on even harder content, yeah gonna have to assume they know nothing and hope solo players are paying attention. You can tell who is.
---
Lol just trying to bring awareness to it so it can be fixed. I haven‚Äôt see any other posts. You could read the title and know what I was talking about. You didn‚Äôt have to read the whole thing.
---
Ive only launched 2 nukes thus far
---
I thought he was saying after he loaded in invisible things were attacking. For me things start attacking before I've even loaded in.
---
Well it clearly says while ‚Äústanding still‚Äù and not while crouching. Nothing broken here.
---
&gt;It's about 7k. 7k is above average.
---
No, it really isn't. 
---
&gt;34k is someone with no family, no job, and no life.
---
Oh look you're wrong again. Someone could get 34k in one comment. I didn't but someone could. 
---
On that note :
---
You have 4,701 comment karma and 2,291 post karma.
---
Your highest voted comment is ~79. You have many many low voted comments
---
I have 34,704 karma and 72 post karma. 
---
My highest rated comment is ~1,647. I have three comments above 1k. My comment score is actually quite small for someone of my reddit age. 
---
&gt;Also you have 0 posts which is very suspicious. 
---
Oh no. I delete posts that aren't useful anymore. 
---
&gt;Kind of pathetic the way you have followed me around on reddit commenting BS 
---
I haven't followed you around you paranoid muppet. I happen to have commented on a post of yours, then responded to your responses then commented on another post that was effectively the same as the first one after you deleted the first one when you realised nobody was falling for your bullshit. I also commented on something that was on the same post that I previously commented on. 
---
&gt;commenting BS
---
Nothing I've said is bullshit, you on the other hand... 
---
&gt;downvoting everything.

I haven't downvoted anything of yours. Again you're being paranoid, get over yourself you're not that important.
---
Ikr
---
Cluck cluck, motherfucker
---
Just trying to bring awareness to it. I haven‚Äôt seen in posts about it. You don‚Äôt have to be an asshole
---
I do want. How much?
---
LOL the tears when CAMPS become invulnerable. Guess you're gonna have to go be a raider in Survival huh? You asked for it...
---
I think we just need a toggle button. If you could push to talk on area and team at the same time you'd also be able to hear both channels at the same time. That's a recipe for a lot of stepped on comms. I try to stay off area (PC) for the most part because people clutter it with voidfill chatter, but switch to it now and again to talk to randos.
---
I was just gonna give em to you I have no use for rubber and always find
---
Agreed. The workaround to this is to use stairs and floors to attach the piece to a new foundation, delete the piece you originally wanted to delete, then remove the added stairs and foundation. A tedious process, but it usually works.
---
Lol saw one today another lvl 150+ was there with me and he pulled a Colonel Gutsy on their asses.
---
Yep, that‚Äôs how I launched my first two nukes lul
---
Hell yeah. You on? Psn sneazel
---
Im grabbing food with me lady ill be on a little later
---
I thought this said soup suggestions. I was like yeah Id go for some atomic soup.
---
Grabbin food with my lady ill be on a little later
---
That‚Äôs kinda funny. I can‚Äôt get too upset about that.
---
You have to use both control panels very quickly for it to work
---
You have to do it quickly, it was intended for 2 players to hit the keypads at the same time
---
yes, it is putting a dent in my whitespring farming. some just croak with no one around. then on the flip side i'll get 10 charred feral ghouls swarming me where they never came that heavy before.
---
Yeah that sucked  lol
---
I'm away right now but if you ever want to I'm keen to spice up the mix given ive mainly been a solo player since i started
---
Oh cool I got it to work. Thanks. Is this a new event?
---
Combat armor
---
Personally I've never had to farm, I spend 100% of my time in my X01 suit and always have between 14 and 17 cores, I always walk/run places so you tend to find power armour now and then with a core at 25% but with the perk that doubles core longevity that's 50% plus ones you tend to find in generators now and then and occasional enemy drops, in fact recently I got 23 cores due to running into a succession of enemies with Gattling Lasers, assault bots, and generators.
---
If you really do need to farm then thunder mountain power plant is the best option, low level players won't be able to reach it and most people ignore it due to high level enemies and it's very out of the way. 
---
3 fully charged cores in about 20 minutes with the double length perk will last you ages
---
As a temporary work-around with the brick walls: place a brick doorway, then place another brick doorway on top of that. Both should have the interior texture facing outwards. Then, just press the scrap button on them, but instead of scrapping, choose the option to "replace" and switch both of them to normal walls. No more brick on the inside! :)
---
It happens to me too sometimes. Very annoying.
---
Right on. I‚Äôll be headed to work in a bit but I‚Äôll be around anytime tomorrow if you still have it.
---
Excavator has the carry weight bonus; pretty much all PA models have calibrated shocks, so the bonus on Excavator compensates for it's lower DR -- and gathering actual *ore* is somewhat time consuming along with eating all your acid to churn it into useful scrap.
---
Other PA will have more DR ;; which makes it slightly more useful for actually using power armor "as intended" - for defense.
---
Standing still implies not moving.
---
If I was drinking something I would've spat it out.
---
people like different degrees of difficulty, some would play classic, most would play adventure i assume, and some would play survival. Classic mode wouldn't even be all that easy, just the regular mode without the survival shit.
---
Definitely under armor plans and not mod plans?
---
Cool. Handy while it persists.
---
Oh well I just missed it somehow.
---
Just keep playing, no need to rush towards OP builds. Just take your time and explore wherever you desire. You‚Äôll stumble upon good weapons from quests or as random loot drops from legendary enemies. But don‚Äôt grind those out, wait til you‚Äôre above level 50 for some of the quest rewards like All Rise from watoga. 650hrs in and I‚Äôm still having fun exploring and interacting with random players.
---
Exactly shhhh üòè
---
I agree, and everytime the game pretend that there is an alive person to give us the quest, even if is obvious that will be a robot o some holotape.
---
Excellent idea.  It would be cool if they had mutated fish and we could actually fish them and cook them.
---
You are 100% correct. I believe that the design for PA to be recalled into inventory is because it is always tied to your personal stash or stash box. In the game the player truly only has 3 budgets. What they carry, the stash, and camp budget and the PA had to fit into one of those which is why you can‚Äôt display PA at a PA station as that would affect the crafting menu in some way. And if it didn‚Äôt affect the crafting menu then it would be like placing it back out into the world as it wouldn‚Äôt be a part of the character‚Äôs stash. I love this game but yet ANOTHER sacrifice to making this game an online multiplayer
---
Happened to me twice. Once at Whitespring, the second time at a rail repair place(?) near Watoga. What‚Äôs most infuriating is that both times, I had one more shot to go and they would‚Äôve been dead
---
I agree, I always love to take pics so I always end up deleting a lot because there is not enough room. Bethesda up the photo count!
---
I‚Äôve build in this exact same spot with a similar concept. Three separate buildings also incorporating that white snack shack. It‚Äôs looking good man, good build!
---
Now i will destroy your mind: the brick side should be always inside. If you check the numpad door, you will discover it.
---
I know the staggering effect, this is me getting shot, even a lvl 50 sb kicked my ass in three seconds from its screams I have dense and fireproof and had 0 issues pre sentinel gear or up to the last 24 hrs,  it‚Äôs since last night everything has been an issue where even two nights ago took on 6 bears and stood there lost a hair of hp as I blast them with a be rifle, used to get hit hard by lvl 62 ghouls and be fine, today I got taken out with one hit from one, there is something going on there‚Äôs a glitch affecting something like my mod working and not working 
---
I‚Äôm not a new player figuring this all out I‚Äôm just under 600 hours with pretty much only my main I play with
---
Meep
---
The only power armor that doesn't have a strong argument for use is t-45
---
Raider goes well at low level, being available 10 levels before any other (15 vs 25)
---
T-60 is cheap and efficient.
---
T51 is best for combat
---
X0-1 is king of rad zones
---
Ultracite is a powerful balance between combat and rad zones
---
Excavator is utility king.
---
T45 is better than raider but worse than t60, and isn't really worth hunting just to use for 10 levels. 25-35
---
another Monogah crash. this time on a different PS4. FML...
---
Yeah... Personally i think if we‚Äôre gonna have quests like that, they need to like, be more along the lines of the hunt for those Nuka Cola paint jobs. Have some sort of a PUZZLE aspect to em. If there‚Äôs no character interaction then just have us navigate a dungeon some paranoid survivalist laced with booby traps and weird puzzle doors to keep people out. Or even some weird mysticism shit like that quest in Far Harbor where ya join the Children of Atom; like you follow the Mothman Cult‚Äôs instructions on initiating new members and you trip balls across the wasteland and fight a Mothman or something. There‚Äôs a lot of things you can do without NPCs, and if we don‚Äôt have em, we need more variety.
---
Where is your camp I have a good deal of time in the game and have yet to see the mothman
---
\+karma
---
Yep, happens on a regular base for me. At the beginning I thought maybe the server has to load everything after I joined a friend‚Äôs game but I am simply not able to fast travel to my friends and teammates, no matter how long we are on the same server.
---
It tells us how  to kill the sheep, ‚Äúactivate the pylons‚Äù
---
People don‚Äôt listen or seem to know how to read.
---
I don't know how we survived. It's like Dial Up vs FIOS
---
It‚Äôs their fault
---
Or Add A Set That Takes Well Less To Make And Is Just Dummy Versions Of The Armor, And Have Stands For it
---
That's not true. Friend got one off sbq after the biv patch. I haven't been there since though, but they still drop since the vendor update.
---
Oh god the lag of them returning
---
In the first video our op was running around letting everyone know his location and not crouched so he could easily get vats on him. His attacker saw him and started firing before op even know what was happening, then he died. His attacker had plenty of time to get in several shots, and so op died. Yet he comes here complaining? A vats crit in the head from a lvl 30 fully modded rifle with the right perks will drop anyone quickly. Op is trying to use his armor to compensate for his garbage pvp playstyle
---
Might wanna save it and sell it for caps, because 99% of the time people are being frozen and having to restart the game. At least on xbox.
---
With the new 1400 cap on vendors, mutation serums are pretty good if you're able to craft at least one of them.
---
My camp is there too. I just love coming back to see all my crops destroyed.
---
Which makes it easier. Negates a lot of perks, too.
---
Coming on a thread where two people are arguing calling them out for being "sad" seems pretty pathetic too.
---
Sorry, it says ‚Äúwhile standing and not moving‚Äù, not ‚Äústanding still‚Äù. My mistake.
---
Ok how muche caps do you get per serum?
---
It‚Äôs the fault of who ever is at the event. If everyone is running at the thing and doing no damage. What‚Äôs the point in trying to hold the points if no one is going to stim you back up or do anything else.
---
500 POUNDS
---
I‚Äôve read loads on it, and am on Xbox myself, never had the issue myself I personally think the prizes for this event are garbage
---
In a way, I guess metal armor is sotra medieval.
---
Can we add to this that most of the time the event freezes people and sends them dashboaring on xbox. Can't complete it because it happens every single event.
---
300-500. Depending on your Charisma and rank of Hard Bargain you have on.
---
Easier doesn't make it less fun though, which seems to be what you implied, maybe they could keep the light pvp in. True about the perks though, cut them I guess?
---
It's probably the start poster for the Burrows.
---
Currently power armor mods and weapon mods are broken. They did maintenance during the week and it didn't make a difference.
---
I sell purified water, or combat shotguns. Every easy to gain all the caps.
---
if you get a purified water farm you can just collect it and just sell it all for no loss on your half
---
I‚Äôd say all the stuff you pick up for free is the best to sell, not hard to gather 1400 caps worth of guns
---
I hate it when the object is green but wont go down. Just make it red for god sake so i dont have to waste my time
---
that is why i said "ith less being visible" as in: you cant see anything at all because you are getting attacked before the loading screen disappears, OP can see stuff but cant move and defend either because loading hasnt properly finished in both cases.
---
Surprisingly game mode looks excellent on my Samsung in comparison to the other settings. I don't have the remote so I was limited to what was in the menu.
---
They posted the other day and said they were looking into the problem. Hopefully we get a hot fix soon.
---
Mods said in a post that they were looking into the problem. It‚Äôs been a day or two. Hopefully we get a fix soon.
---
Does that mean they can catch the virus that seems to kill random robots too?
---
Thanks. I think most interpret that to mean stranding still hence the confusion. Also energy weapons cut right through that armor. That is why there is a sudden uptick in interest in those weapons on trading boards
---
I think it's pointless, honestly. Not every game needs to be "easy".
---
I'm just waiting for all the people that build CAMPs next to workshops to have invincible turret farms within LOS of workshops to farm players. Seems like the next exploit waiting to come around once pacifist mode extends to CAMPs.
---
I did the event with my lvl 21 alt, almost lasted the entire event as a conduit. Just kept running in circles and stimpacing. So don't be scared of it low level friends
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b2vh4g/new_research_complete_guide_to_the_best_armor_sets/
---
Itll be here waiting for you guy reserved
---
You really sure?  Cause those "mutated fish" just might fish you and cook ya.
---
/S
---
that's why i'm not sold in the "beth pls give us robots to protect our camp"
---
i have like 3 whitesprings robots next to my camp and they are getting rekt by some chad ghouls or whatever enemy that spawns there lmao press F for my crops
---
I play mainly on PC and haven't really encountered/heard of it on PC. I would understand if that's a huge issue on Xbox why people aren't doing something/just standing there.
---
Oh yeah I love the imposter event l, well I would if I could find the damn thing whenever its vulnerable, every time I try to do that event it's just
---
"The imposter sheepsquatch is vulnerable!"and then
---
 .2 seconds later it tells me I need to fix the pylons again. Just repeat that for 5 minutes while I'm frantically looking for the freaking sheepsquatch robot thing and then we fail the quest.
---
gtx 1060 6gb
---
No one wants to go after the pylons. Everyone wants to wait for someone else to do it so they can attack. So the one or two players who actually go after the pylons time after time run out of stimpacks or deplete their aids trying to take one for the team and the event ends. I don‚Äôt even know why the people who avoid the pylons show up for the event. I almost ignore this event now
---
That is a very good question.. I'm pretty surprised that it let me kill them without much resistance.. they aren't very strong, and we're permanently dead.. I was able to loot steel from them
---
That's what i do, but it eats up CAMP budget.
---
This is the most wholesome thing I've read all day and my low-level alt thanks you kindly.
---
Serums. Some have pretty low crafting requirements and use common flux types. I get 350 per, so 4 per day and I max out. 
---
Beats the crap out of making 3 million hats.
---
It wouldn't really be easy though, easy being arbitrary as it is. Fallout 3/NV/and 4 were plenty difficult without a survival mode being on, or in the case of 3 included at all. Maybe beef up the monsters to compensate. That said there is the trouble of most of the perk cards being hardwired for a survival game.
---
I agree. I've only had the game for a week or so. I mean it's neat and all having needs, but it feels too much like Minecraft. I'd rather be able to go and explore without having the needs system. That's just me.
---
PS4 rip
---
Now I can fit my junk in stash.
---
But I still can't fit my armor and weapons in stash. And then, like, - The Fixer - new weapon from from quest line with around 13lbs, what stuff that I spent my time on, must be thrown out to put it in?
---
I've ran out 7 out 8 times in xbox and haven't crashed yet. Whatever is happening to you isn't universal.
---
The game is like that. Some areas and inside buildings it's shutters bad. The only fix is to wait for them to fix it.
---
They do??? Is there a reason for that? Tbh I can‚Äôt say this is right or wrong. But I had the feeling that I get wrecked pretty easy by Gatling Plasmas for example. But I thought the builds of my opponents are just good. So they just shoot through my armor?
---
I felt that was the answer, will here's hoping.
---
Mine always get deleted after every update...
---
If you go to lewisburg in the train station there are some notes. 1 of them will start the quest to investigate some missing persons.
---
Players can even build things that are not even connected to the ground. They're actually floating, and they can still be built.
---
Agreed. Everyone wants to be the big tough guy. And the one who takes the for the team gets the burden of getting nothing for the efforts. 
---
It‚Äôs just like the queen. Everyone wants to hit the queen but gets mad when the adds roll them.
---
I just want the plans and the experience to say I did the event and not paid way more caps than needed.
---
I know this works on brick walls, not sure about the others. So place down a door frame, than go to place another on on the opposite side (It should snap to it) once both are placed highlight one and replace it with a wall (using the replace option)
---
Heavy BOS combat armor
---
Server hop sometimes you damage them without knowing
---
Re log, and you may have pain trained them
---
I came here just to upvote that title. Bravo, sir.
---
Sadly i'm not on PC
---
People have been asking for this since launch..
---
There people with alt accounts with max caps, having a limit on the caps isn‚Äôt stopping people from hoarding wealth, just makes it a little tricky
---
I use the same wall and floor mods, my house looks 100x nicer on my PC than on my wife's because of them.
---
I gladly go for pylons, rather save ammo lol
---
It's not just for color purposes but texture ones as well I would love a double sided plaster wall.
---
For audio it is a 3.5mm Jack, charge cable is a micro USB.
---
&gt; I know this works on brick walls, not sure about the others. So place down a door frame, than go to place another on on the opposite side (It should snap to it) once both are placed highlight one and replace it with a wall (using the replace option)
---
Eh yeah do events the main quest gets pretty tedious to do alone so maybe find people to help with the later ones and just figure what kind of perks you like and try to focus on keeping like 1 or 2 guns and a melee because hoarding becomes a major problem fast
---
I've got a few complete sets and plans of the civil war clothing, you looking for plans or the outfit?
---
Looks like a football team ready to square off against a team of super mutts
---
You are standing at craft armor bench, you have the materials needed cloth leather steel (are these grayed out?)
---
If you feel there‚Äôs not point there is no point,  I‚Äôve failed and completed the event a few times each, it‚Äôs not overly hard, people need to adapt to the event, and not have Beth games hold their hands through the event, the parade event was for handholding
---
It wasn‚Äôt always that way at first when the event started. Most anyone near a pylon would become a conduit and there was more time in the event when the imposter was vulnerable and that time allowed for the imposter to be taken down. Now way too much time is wasted with the pylons not activated. My last time at the event I was a conduit every single time with another person but no one took the third conduit over and over and the event failed. The last minute of the event I stood on the top of the shack and just thumbs down the whole time. Haven‚Äôt been back since
---
Sorry, those plans are VERY rare. I can only craft the T-51b Left Leg. If I come across the Keft Are, I‚Äôll let you know.
---
Doing events, workshop defend, and dailies are a good way to level and gear up early in the game. Don't worry about dying.
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night
---
I am crashing all the time now no matter where I am, long load screens, I have even died a few times because I was somehow being attacked and it was not showing up on my health meter until after it has stopped freezing and then bang I am dead, so frustrating.
---
Has anyone else also noticed, sometimes when I spawn into Watoga that the robots just drop down dead as soon as you go near them and that there is hardly any Legendarys now, they must have nerfed it!!!
---
Free states flair? Common lol
---
I think I have adrenal reaction
---
the vast majority of players you meet will be like the guy you've already encountered, or friendly at least.
---
my advice to you would be, that when you inevitably meet that arse/raider player, don't get discouraged..FO76 is like life that way :)
---
I‚Äôm online now if you want to stop by.
---
^Me: *^Not ^Enuff ^Dakka's ^in ^the ^distance*
---
Combat armor: Bolstering sentinel/cavalier (depending on build) or vanguard sentinel/cavalier.  Cavalier is more suited to melee I think, sentinel better for ranged weapons
---
There will always be the old fashioned nuke.  One of the most rewarding things I‚Äôve ever done is nuke whitespring to take care of a couple houses.  You get to kill ghouls, nice legendary monsters....  and not a single wanted flag.
---
I think there's one at the Pumpkin House just southwest of the Mega Rocket workshop. I could be wrong, but worth a look.
---
I'm sorry, let me rephrase it in a non-asshole way.
---
I see that you are concerned about downvotes, saying that you don't understand why anyone would downvote it.  Allow me to interject if I may. 
---
This has actually been a very hot topic of conversation over the past week.  The people who frequent this forum would know that this topic has been posted many times.  Perhaps some of the people who saw your post felt that it did not add to the conversation, and downvoted it based on that.  Please don't take it personally.  Upvoting and downvoting is merely a reflection of group opinion on a specific topic/comment's value in context, and not a judgment of your worth as a human being.
---
There is a Search function here on the forum.  If you use that function, you will see that the topic has been addressed innumerable times already.  Pro-Tip:  Using this feature in the future may illuminate for you which topics you have missed.  None of us can be on a subreddit 24/7, so it is natural and normal that you have missed some threads.  If you put the word "mods" in your search for this subreddit and sort by New, you can see the some remnants of the flurry of activity that has happened.

Good luck to you in your travels, both in Reddit and in real life.  We are all just less-hairy apes trying to make sense of the world.  Please do not take my response as anything but one dumb blind ape trying to help another navigate through a confusing world.  May your day bring you good fortune.
---
I try to res people as and when i can in this event but when i change all.my perk cards to my fighting cards i am over encumbered to hell and can only walk to them and they die before i reach them most the time
---
They missed one hell of an opportunity by not implementing fishing with all of the fishing rods that can be picked up.
---
I agree 100%.  Hope they fix the armor resistance against energy weapons next patch :)
---
How much would you sell it for?
---
Have you used all of your treasure maps? I found a bunch of unknown plans that way.
---
Yes, please! Sounds like a lot of us like setting up displays and would love to be able to do this in fo76. Was just mentioning this in game today to a friend, oddly enough.
---
Scroll down, there are lots of options. Many challenge lists scroll.
---
Your clones are very impressive. You must be very proud.
---
Thanks, I'll just keep doing that then! The only weapon I actually really want is the lever action Rifle, but I'm patient enough to wait for the RNG gods to shine on me.
---
They already got a buff lol. It's just that even after the buff, it's still in such a bad state that they are easily the worst weapons in the game.
---
Here's the best part: some of the weapons in the durability buff got as much as 5x of a boost. The laser rifle, which had the worst durability of all energy weapons by a considerable margin? It got the lowest buff, only 2x. It still breaks within maybe 100 fusion cells.
---
Worst part is I think they were buffed recently lmao
---
Its not the world holding these back its the game engine, it lags to hell if theres too many built objects in an area, hense the distance between camps there currently is. You can sort of kind of co-op build in the sense that team mates can build in your camps and workshops but thats it
---
Oh Franiel!
---
Only 8 seconds?  You're doing better than I am.  Loading into the world is rough.
---
A real saint.
---
90% weight reduction, 50 less fall damage...and jet turbines
---
Why are these posts still a thing? Mild inconvenience among many others in my hundreds of hours.
---
5k? I‚Äôll hop on to make sure I have it
---
Some guy and me did that, and post-event he did the same thing, but with the angry emote.
---
Been seeing them go for about 2.5k. Can you go down to that?
---
Nty
---
They just need to fix the anti armor perks and legendary effects to work with energy weapons. Also fix enemy resistance as a whole.
---
Same with the last one I did. I just waited for the one legendary bot to spawn and cut my losses. The boss wasn‚Äôt event below 90%.
---
And we are talking 8,9,10 level 100s at the event and it failed. That‚Äôs pitiful
---
Isn't that common knowledge? Of course they won't allow infinite caps, people already worked around this by duping hundreds of thousands of nuka colas. 7 figures seems overly generous though, even if they ever buff a cap limit I'd say 200k tops. There isn't any need for more than that, even the most expensive recipes only cost 20k without any charisma perks. So far the only genuine cap sink in the game is the encryptid event, and even then it's pretty bad so far because the value is nowhere near worth it to the person initiating the event.
---
I wouldn't pick them at your level, just hope you get one or two in a perk pack.
---
You know the problem is the grounded mutation and class freak perk. Even with class freak you lose 50% of damage instead of 12%. Without grounded,laser,plasma and ecen the tesla rifle can it up to almost 200 damage.
---
Im sure they will do a CAMP update where you can place junk items like beer bottles, weapon racks and armor stands. Make shelves and desks usable.
---
Just like that ever elusive pie
---
You got banned, so did I. Deal with it.
---
I always assumed those were garbage. It feels like I have hundreds stowed away. How do you use those, anyways?
---
Outfit itself.
---
Pretty much everyone wants a way to sell or scrap excess ammo.
---
Yeah but it said the accounts would eventually be reactivated, but they haven‚Äôt
---
Thanks, i will check it out
---
Most people don't care about mechanics if they have other people there to do the work for them. Most just want minimum effort with maximum results. As far as the Sheepsquatch event it's either been super easy or a cluster fuck. If people hit the pylons and keep them going it ends in 3 minutes. I've also joined towards the end and seen everyone dying, doing little damage and not keeping the pylons on. Bethesda makes it too easy for lackluster effort to be rewarded in events. Reviving players, completing objectives, clearing adds and dealing damage aren't rewarded on an individual basis so most people won't bother like most games.
---
Just curious, after 418 hours of gameplay what is your lvl?
---
Get a job at Bethesda and help them improve their servers?
---
Problem solved! :D
---
Oh, 160 atoms are just too much to be missed! Get yourself a hard hitting projectile weapon and give him a sneak attack stacked with related damage increase perks, Bloody mess and Covert Operative. Good luck:)
---
Can someone provide details on this, I'm a little late to the discussion?
---
That's something a synth would say.
---
It's not just you.  It's been happening to me as well.
---
I shut down discord, steam, firefox, etc and it seems to have improved the stability.  I didn't crash at all today.  Granted, I was only able to play for a couple hours, but that's still an improvement from earlier in the week where I'd crash like once an hour or more.
---
I would assume the invincible camps only apply if you are not hostile to the player, if your turrets are going to attack someone, your gonna be hostile to them and they could retaliate on your camp
---
Also want to add, radio seems buggy and crashes games more on than off, theory. Also on xbox
---
Yeah loading into events like imposter sheepsquatch sometimes takes forever for the enemies to appear. Too many I guess. And yes, they did nerf Watoga :(
---
Bro what your lvl after that much time played?
---
Wait, you can run out? I can consistently search every trash can I find. Granted I don't usually sit around one area for too long, but that means it has to at least reset every once in a while
---
Oxhorn has an awesome power armor museum in fo4 check it out on YouTube is worth a watch. He's got every paint job on display
---
I would like it to effect more types of containers. Suit cases for example the metal lockers and boxes.
---
Everyone would be filthy rich. I vote no. Lol.
---
Haha, least someone finally acknowledged it. I can go to bed happy :)
---
I believe this game has hundreds you haven't searched......
---
If I don't have it already made, I can make you an outfit no problem.
---
A bunch of people duped or helped others dupe and were rightfully banned. Some got butthurt and keep crying about it.
---
Everyone would be filthy rich.
---
my main is 436
---
Eventually could mean tomorrow or 7 billion years from now
---
What? Literally the only reason for them to make any changes to how repairs work is due to adding in repair kits. I don't care if it was intentional or not, the change due to the repair kits have negatively affected gameplay.
---
So, lowlevels can be really useful during this event. Since it is not in a radzone they won't be wearing the hazmat suits so they are more durable and eye bombs die in one or two hits with any gun so long as they drop them away from each other they can act as a good screen.

Yeah sure Bethesda sent me this on February 18th

Not really, the latest patch has completely set back all the server stability they worked on fixing since beta. People are crashing more now than any other time since launch.
---
The DLC is extremely underwhelming. It costs 2k caps just for the opportunity to try fighting the boss and the boss has the same drop rates as any other legendary creature.
---
They are getting ready to add in pay 2 win with repair kits you buy with atoms.
---
There was just a level 230-something that just tagged it a few times with a shotgun and stood there giving himself stims when he got hit. Not even on being conduit! Meanwhile I'm a level 30 trying to be a conduit.
---
That's why I prefer the scrap option.
---
I think bethesda should say that the millitery tampered with it and fucked it up, then you could get  a quest to go round resaersh centres and figure out how to fix it.
---
I would assume new features would be rolled out without any play testing/QA. Kinda like how survival did, and generally every patch ever.
---
This should be adjustable. Personally, I think they're too loud.
---
As well as whitespring guests who refused to leave after the hotel was shut down for "renovation". Oh and probably quite a few scorched and ghoul skeletons from over the years.
---
It‚Äôs not worth it. If the whole group attending the event isn‚Äôt actively working as a team staying on top of the conduits and attacking the imposter then those who are actually trying end up losing way more than what they came to the event with in aids and caps spent getting there. The event is designed to go fast and be intense.
---
They reset after 24 hours or so.
---
Trash cans in whitesprings are my coffee supply.
---
You put a lot of thought into this. Have an up vote for good ideas.
---
Mine? It's on a cliff far away from critters.
---
Scrapping would be acceptable. :D
---
Loud??
---
Hey, Sorry for the confusion, posted to wrong sub. Delated and reposted here -

Visit the top of the world, second floor, 9/10 times it‚Äôs a crash for me
---
Christmas wood burner? Are you talking about the red fireplace?
---
Well survival is a beta, people are currently play testing it, but yes i do agree it will have minimum testing, probably quick load the game up, see if it crashes, if not its good to go
---
Ik
---
Bye, have a beautiful time!
---
get outta here pinko
---
How did you get to keep it?
---
Well, I have it so..
---
Go to lewisburg in the train station and read the notes on the wall.
---
Can someone point me in the right direction to find out why my username is not working for me on Bethesda.net, if I was hacked? I have password saved through Chrome so I know I owned the username, I can't get a reset password email and using my email address brings a "setup new account" email. Bethesda through support won't understand what I mean by saying that I'm the only person using the username everywhere.
---
I‚Äôve seen the Mothman about 4-5 times, but not one Flatwoods monster in approaching 300 hrs.
---
Wha. God oh God this is a bit confusing. Welp time for another Edit
---
Go to the train station in lewisburg and read the notes on the wall
---
They don‚Äôt for me. Weird.
---
I think that is where I was jumped by the Flatwoods Monster.
---
Just adding to the list of people this bugged out on. Got to the part with the riddle and quit for the night. Got back on after this past update, and I have the label but no quest and no way to reactivate it.
---
This would be an easy way for them to add* content. I would be all for it.
---
My email after that said I had 145K ‚Äúrare items‚Äù on me whether you believe me or not I didn‚Äôt have that. There systems flawed it counted each individual bullet if it was ultracite and if say you had 4 and dropped 4 then picked them back up it would read it as 8.
---
can you be more specific? what locker at grafton steel?
---
Oh thanks man, let me know when you want to meet up?
---
Cripple them with enforcer and stand behind them, if you have tesla coils you can just wait and they will die, even give you free xp in the form of hatchlings.
---
I like it
---
With vending machines coming in a future update, a cap limit will make no sense. Once you reach the cap limit, there will be no reason to continue selling items until you spend some or all if them. As difficult as it is, it's not impossible to have every plan and recipe in the game as well as the best weapons and armor (in your opinion), and once you do, then what? There's a lot of games that don't have a limit on the currency that arse dooing fine.
---
Taking the stacks of soda and other contraband was the first step.  The legendary guy could be the next step.  Who knows what that guy is gonna charge.
---
Same. The power plant workshop cores are the best. You need to claim power plant workshop then craft 1 fusion generator and connect it to fusion core extractor. Stay in front of it to collect the cores. Before leaving store fusion generator.
---
I had so many and didnt think it would be worth the hassle, but some were pretty fast to find. I found an interactive map, and another treasure map guide that helped. I‚Äôll link them. 
---
There will be a mound of dirt that you dig up(no shovel needed), as long as you have that specific treasure map in your inventory. It will use the treasure map up. If you have multiple copies, you can quit and server hop, and dig it up again and again until you have no copies of that treasure map left. 
---
Most of them have 1 or 2 plans, some caps, healing items, and random armor and weapons. I did find a few legendaries too, but rare. I just committed a few hours to hunting them all down, and between the actual plans and scrapping all of the armor pieces, i learned a lot of new plans and mods.

---
I can get on now if your on.
---
I agree. We need more flora to plant in our camps, especially to make more complex beverages and medicines/chems.
---
I already completed the quest for it. Thank you though!
---
As a low-level player, I would also appreciate the reverse of this: only players close(ish) to your own level on a server, so that if you get to an area shortly after someone at a much higher level, you aren't swarmed by enemies you have no hope of defeating.
---
PUGB frying pan armor
---
These hard to get I have almost all this hats
---
Need the reeds for sugar? Just curious, no offers from me though.
---
Not really farming, but I buy them from weapons vendor in Whitesprings (they are under ammo tab). Vendor should have one every refresh cycle. They sell for around 350 caps. Also pick them up from PAs I find while exploring. BoS camp venture has a couple that spawn every now and then when you get into the building that has to be unlocked via terminal + there is a PA in the courtyard.
---
I'll bring the buffout and whiskey
---
I'm not denying your experience or anything, but all yaoi guai do is stagger you (bypass sentinel), ghouls do unmitigated rad damage (bypasses sentinel), and I'm not experiencing any issues with already applied weapon/armor mods. If you're running a BE rifle, part of being bloodied is just that you're damn squishy. It sounds to me like you're experiencing a bug which is eerily similiar to my entire playthrough as a bloodied rifleman.
---
I'm on ps4 and I'll buy your lead
---
Yes, you are true! I maybe should make my C.A.M.P. into a tourist spot like Uncanny Caverns for it's a best place to spot out these mysterious creatures lol
---
I might've missed it, but I think you forgot to include the whole plastic covers over the limited edition rum bottles thing.
---
The other bad thing, is that you can completely ruin a server for trading.
---
Haha &lt;33
---
It's has a ceramic coating to keep it from Rusting so when it rains a the dust and dirt come right off.
---
The one you're visiting is a critter encounter, usually spawns fireflies, opposums, radchickens, cats and such. There's another type that can generate Flatwoods and Mothman.
---
Until recently I didn't kept notes on the locations as I thought they were trivial but I remember being close to one when I put my camp at the Ash Heap on the Junk Pile east of the elevated mansions.
---
Back in my day it was 200 pounds youngsters
---
Where do we find the serums tho? I didnt even know we could do that. When did that happen?
---
Or give us the ability to have different builds we can switch to when the circumstance dictates, like at the moment I am a melee build primarily but I do have some of the perks when I use a TSE Handmade but because of the weight of the damn things I can only take one into a fight and I would like to have a backup, if I went to a heavy gun build and had the ability to have my cards set for that build etc then when the situation demands it I could switch out the entire melee build and insert the heavy gunner build or whatever, just like I have seen a mod that allows you to do just that, but I don't use mods in this game. This way you could use up a lot of the perk cards, I have over 32 waiting to be assigned but I have the build I want for now and the prospect of keep moving perk points is a massive hassle.
---
Yes get level 3 for both, it allows you to skip a huge chunk of the nuke silo runs as you can level 3 pick a door to a room with a level 3 terminal and bypass a section that would otherwise take maybe 15 to 20 minutes to do
---
Was it originally 200? I don't remember, I played on launch day, you would think I would remember.
---
Yeah it was it was crazy
---
Well one my friend got it isn‚Äôt enough to convince me. All the people I know that is daily farming the queen 6-8 times have seen loads of recipes drop pre patch and so far zero after the recipes became available at the enclave. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong if there‚Äôs more confirmed drops I‚Äôll believe it still drops but nah not so far.
---
ok, I just need to check the stock on T-60s again?
---
If u are on at around 930 central I will give u the plans for the mask and the costume so u can make your own
---
Hey just wanted to know if you found out what he was actually doing cause I‚Äôve experienced this too and it needs to be exposed
---
Yeah I drop ammo and pick it up all the time. I works better after it was in a paper bag. I Totally see how this was not a result of duping.
---
But seriously you have no reason to drop and pick up that much ammo unless you're trying to use a duication glitch smh how is that even an defense.
---
TLDR; we don't believe your bs excuse why don't any of you just come clean. At this point no one cares and you're probably not getting to play 76 again (unless you have a second account)
---
I picked up a couple of these today, ran home, and put those in the stash IMMEDIATELY before I accidentally junked it.
---
I have to admit the blaster is worthless for now:( Bethesda,please buff!
---
The recipe plans are a random drop from the SBQ. I bought mine off other players.
---
Hello there, wow seems like you really know your stuff when it comes to a medic build! Is this the one you used? Did u make any changes ? If u even play 76 anymore XD (looking or a medic build that's why I'm replying to this 3 month old reply lol)
---
Just let me know.
---
Monster mask.
---
Something about the game crashing mid event then you keep the monster mask
---
This but dark wood
---
Hoarding wealth in the form of having items that are presently valuable, in the face of a potential mechanic that could easily make many rng dupe items obsolete?
---
It's the monster mash mask you can't actually get it
---
Happens to me the most at Watoga
---
Friend of mine got to keep it by very common means: 'Disconnected from the server' :P
---
Happened while he was doing the event.
---
Fun fact: If he wears the mask while someone is running the event he hears the children screaming as if he was doing the event himself :D
---
I have honestly been wanting this for absolute ages
---
I've had the opposite issue; I keep completing challenges (like leveling up 3 times or whatever) and having it not count.
---
I ran into this exact player the other night from your gif. He had 20+ kills and was dominating the server. I was able to kill him with vats a few times, but my friend and I honestly think there was some kind of exploit or hack he was using, and we both use tryhard vats PvP builds. His health bar would stop at 0hp and he wouldn't die, and even vats Crits to his head didn't seem to do much.
---
Well your buddy's a bit stupid, then
---
Honestly, for just exploring, it's always been worth it to me.  I've been playing since the beta and still haven't been everywhere. No human NPCs, but that doesn't really matter when you're exploring every terminal and note.
---
There were definitely issues for other things, but exploration has always basically been "Fallout 4 but a gigantic map, and occasionally another player".
---
Maybe, havent noticed that, but a different bug i have noticed is when picking up legendaries it displays the last legendary i pick up on screen, then when i pick up another itll show the one i got before ect...
---
Really nice! I tried to make a little enclosed fort but kept getting high level super mutants spawning inside attacking my generator.
---
Too late: auto-scrapped the piss out of it, learned it exists after. Nice legendary without the legendary "unscrappable" box ticked. Good job Bethesda as always.
---
Is lead like super high in demand? I've never had a problem with it, but then again, only ammo I craft is Shells, and the occasional bulk of 5mm
---
Some of my weeklies were completed upon login after the patch. Didn't get the atoms and support was useless.
---
Yup, I will take the Sensor Array and the Jetpack for the T-60. I can atempt to get the flux for the jetpack, though nukes are rare these days.
---
The costume looks like the Imposter Sheepsquatch outfit. I think the mask is a  part of that Monster Mash event.
---
Are you going loud and proud or hush hush rifleman?
---
Can confirm, recently got an adrenal reaction recipe from SBQ a week and a half ago.
---
This get them and swap them out, have combat cards in use and switch to hacking or crafting when you need the non-combat bonuses.
---
TSE can still drop, friend of mine got one last week TSE double barrel cant remember if it had a 3rd stat or not but i was with him when it dropped, whitesprings non nuke zone.
---
I‚Äôve never been so pleased *clapping intensify‚Äôs*
---
Same! If I get a team invite at an Event I add them because we were all there. 
---
Complaining about "them" being in the way and getting rewards for doing "nothing" is such a jerkoff thing to do, too.
---
Hush hush
---
Let me buy your one star bloodied weapons!
---
So as I was saying from the beginning that there is an issue, really pointing out facts based on what seems like an assumption that you just know better than everyone else, dude you should really focus on giving to the discussion vs trying to look like you  (an ass hat) have it all figured out, as my original statement was (now let me add I‚Äôve run a bloodied build with sentinel for about 2 months) and again the last 24 hours has been the issue, so watching you constantly restating facts about staggering really shows you‚Äôve nothing to give but spouting off your knowledge only to finish up with ‚Äúsounds like a bug‚Äù concluding an agreement to my comment to the original post discussing issues people are having within the game
---
I admit I was using mules but I honestly never duped I agree it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore though but believe me or not that patch hit people who weren‚Äôt duper‚Äôs I was just a trader w a bunch of stuff moving from character to character and if I got something good I‚Äôd put it on my main so most of the good stuff would get counted at least twice. But I see how easy it for everyone to say that I‚Äôm a duper and that I cheated I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy I‚Äôm just saying in the email it said i was ‚Äúsuspended‚Äù so at one point or another my account will be reactivated and Bethesda has said nothing more to me since February so duper or innocent their lack of communication on this is terrible.
---
I agree, most times I pick a lock only to find crap in there or nothing at all
---
It only takes like 40 weapons off mutants to hit 1400. Just grab a couple each run. I never understood the hat grind, especially since caps are so worthless.
---
Not just crying, spreading false rumors like crafting mass amounts can get you banned
---
Also on PC, but I've had zero crashes and my PC was built 3 years ago.
---
Invest in more sneak perks.
---
I could definitely settle for scrap and recraft.
---
&gt; while there are tons of duplicates out there that are illegitimate, that doesn‚Äôt mean Bethesda needs to buff legendary drops.
---
No, it would be better if they managed to get rid of the duped weapons.  But that's a very difficult path to take for various reasons, so we are left with the options of trying to level the playing field (most likely by escalating gear), or ignoring the situation.  The second approach is currently being taken and I'm not a fan of it.
---
Or as a counter to raising the cap. Why not just charge less for weapons and armour?
---
My last sentence was facetious. There is no such thing as a tanky bloodied build. You die a lot. No amount of sentinel, lone wanderer, or serendipity is going to make you last a long time. Sometimes you just die.
---
