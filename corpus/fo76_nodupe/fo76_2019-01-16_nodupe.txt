Would not think vats with a cryolator would be very good guess it depends on how much AP it takes

&gt;Always sell diluted Rad-X.

If you have mutations, radx suppresses them;diluted radx does not.
---
&gt;SAVE ALL DISEASE CURE AND ANTIBIOTICS. 
---
I think someone else mentioned it, but there's a sulphur fountain near the whitespring golf club that cures disease. Still worth holding disease cures for convenience, but if you're out, you can always fast travel there.
---
&gt;You need Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass, and High-Radiation fluids in equal proportion.  They are heavy but last forever.
---
You only need 1 of each for every 10 flora, and they are really common drops anytime flora are available. I wouldn't hold onto any extra of these.
---
Melee‚Äôs pretty good, I‚Äôve been using a blades tire iron recently because I‚Äôm such a low level it just one hit kills everything I come across( some how?) but I need to repair it.
---
What‚Äôs your gt? I‚Äôll send invite. 
---
Away with ye! TSE fuckboi.
---
Well chief. That‚Äôs because it doesn‚Äôt need to be said. 
---
Exploiting the map is cheating and obviously so is any route required for an individual to perform this illegal activity. 
---
Even if you were to argue the example that they unintentionally entered the area it would still be the players responsibility to choose to play by the rules and leave, or cheat and start building to manipulate the exploit to their advantage. 
---
These sort of things are obvious even to those with a sliver of a peanut for brains. So this basically tells me you‚Äôre likely an advocate for cheating or you are just attempting to be contrary for the sake of it. Either way, it would appear that you may have a learning disability.
---
Oh, and you really can't go wrong with the shotguns. When I was a young adventurer fresh from the vault I was grabbing whatever I could whenever I could. But mainly stuck revolving around the revolver, hunting rifle, and shotgun.

No one seems to get what you‚Äôre saying but I‚Äôm there too.  I can‚Äôt help you, found the two in the basement but those aren‚Äôt it.  If I find I‚Äôll update, very aggravating.

Are you a stealth sniper?

Great thanks for the answer.

They sure do love the "take off all your clothes" challenges...

Can confirm, didn't have a chance. Did kill one with an orbital though which was fun.

The Nocturnal effect is not very good it only buffs it by 33-66% depending on the time at night and debuffs it during the day.
---
And now it begins again! -_- played for hours just fine, then DC once and began to DC repeatedly before even getting in the world hahaha
---
I could see this with civil war attire
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can fast travel to any ‚ÄúEvent‚Äù even if it‚Äôs inside a nuke zone. ‚ÄúScorched Earth‚Äù is the Queen event
---
I agree with most of these minus not showing players on the map. You might want to meet up with someone, trade, or team up
---
Oh no üò≠ I‚Äôm sorry for you loss I can‚Äôt imagine not being able to say goodbye to one of my kitties. I‚Äôm sure your kitty would have been honored to have a spot in your game. 
---
The Watoga Warriors?  Base them off the Nationals or Braves.
---
Had this problem too while trying to build Prototype X01 armor.
---
What fixed it was putting all the materials in the stash. Somehow the PA station wants all the mats in the stash now. Its weird, but at least easy to deal with.
---
This x 1000. Even with everything bulked, I found I had like 60 bulk rubber and it sells for decent. Also had something like 300 fiberglass spools from telephones and cigarettes. Cleaned out probably 3 vendors just selling that stuff and freed up a ton of weight in stash.
---
I love the community of this game so much! Haha, I‚Äôll try to help them,  it I‚Äôm not very good at this game lol
---
Cool idea dude.  I play on pc so I aint looking, just wanted to give you a verbal upvote.
---
Hey man, not my fault they the most op weapons
---
Communication ban? Is that some kinda panzy ass console thing? The game is rated mature and "scumbag" doesn't even come close to that.
---
definitely some misinformation in this post
---
i wonder if Todd challenges people to that around the office?
---
Or about a unique experience that made your entire family cry tears of joy. Or about the extreme hatred you felt when you realized the game was broken* beyond your wildest dreams.
---
Thanks again! I'm asking for pvp, it's what I focussed on most since lvl 20 and I have 5 characters now.
---
I was hoping to hear it's very powerfull, cause I don't mind running around with 2 sets of armor and change to nocturnal when it's night. During my early levels I switched from leather to metal armor all the time based on which enemies I fought. NPC's are so easy that I want to focus my builds only on pvp. I noticed nocturnal is very easy to find as most players seem to sell it or give it away. Now I know it can be OP i'll be going after these pieces!
---
Another question if you don't mind. Have you ever seen chameleon armor pieces with more than just the chameleon ability?
---
I agree with you, but I need to make 'one small' ammendment... If you take 35 Rad-X you'll see standing side by side with someone in power armor in a nuke zone you take indistinguishable amounts of rads... It suffers from a 'curve' that decreases the effectiveness of additional Rad-X, and Bethesda's power armor buff doesn't seem to be subject to that same curve...
---
So there is nothing 'practical' you could ever do that would let you take comparable rad damage in a nuke zone.
---
:)
---
Where is the fluorescent in white springs?  All I find is yellow with a few cobalt. 
---
Power armor and radshield do the trick for me

There was a bug that carnivore/herbivore bugs out all future serums for only giving the negative effect. People left that serum for last. But i don't want to do that until i'm sure they fixed the bug.

What we really need are slutty mods. Every single one of them. A simple dress or swimsuit is not enough for my male character. I already look like a dork in RL.
---
&gt; One night my Mom was playing and I looked up to see tears in her eyes because she had ended up in a place where the things she needed to fight were way too high of a level for her. Someone came in, killed them all for her and gave her some gifts and went along. 
---
1. Does she play on PC?
---
2. If yes. Was the person who helped her wearing a yellow suit of Power Armor with a Tesla Rifle?
---
Asking because this story sounds exactly like something I did about 2 days ago. think I was at an airport looking for gears and springs. Found a player hiding from a bunch of enemies and I went around chain lightninging everything. After I cleared the area I dropped like 10 plans pointed at the bag (by shooting it with lightning)  and fast traveled away to defend my workshop.
---
Cause the game is shit... Sad part is that world design is one of the games few strong points..

Whitesprings bunker tends to have a lot of technical data, but you have to find it all on the first log in, or leave without taking anything. This is because the loot gets locked in the first time you take something. So it pays to scout out if you have a good instance of loot, and if you don't, log without taking anything and check again.
---
Last night I found 3 in the military wing desks. I took each one by one and turned it in. Luckily, since my camp is just south of Whitesprings so the round trip fast travel cost was 20 caps and you get 25 for each turn in.
---
I put 3 points in it.  Can‚Äôt kill my self with a tse anymore, so you shouldn‚Äôt either

Yeah why the hate for Preston?

The druggie chick was more trouble then she‚Äôs worth. I dig her accent though

crimsonfirecat on bnet, PC, windows 10; Game won't even get to the loading screen before the main menu before crashing ever since the hotfix installed. Have tried scan &amp; repairing multiple times as well as reinstalling the whole game.

Go to r/Fallout if you want to complain, I dont really care.

Most people with high end gear won't even accept caps and only consider trading for equivalently powerful gear.
---
This is already happening. I am a member of the Nuka Knights.

It's becoming more and more common.  The fact that you are making light of it means that you are part of the problem.

I use a 2 shot explosive lever action, but only when things get real tough. Most of my normal combat is me *powerfisting* my enemies to climax.

We need an emote that says we come in peace and the emote is ET wearing a vault suit ü§£

I keep asking until I sell them, otherwise I keep them. I saw an explosive 10mm go for 20k caps, so I think Im good with my set prices.
---
Bullshit.

Oh good, it really bugged me that people could see me but I couldn't do anything, and I'd just get a "you have declined the group invite" message.

There's no endgame. I decided to make my own.

I typically just use Radaway or disease cure

You always remember every time you forgot.

No doubt. Destroying your own stuff because you are mad is incredibly childish. Ive been incredibly angry before and not once have i punched a hole in my tv or thrown my controller

I'd pay Atoms for this to be a supersledge skin. Honestly my favorite weapon.
---
 Found a level 40 tse combat shotgun from maybe my 50-60th try at uranium fever, and just recently a level 40 +40% power atk dmg bloodied +1 str rolling pin from a random super mutant. 250ish hours.
---
The idea of balancing these choices is an illusion. There is no fulcrum to measure these things.
---
As someone who puts a lot of effort into their camps, has been griefed, and has had their camp destroyed multiple times, yes I personally do check pretty regularly to see if anyone is near my camp when I‚Äôm away. I like visitors but I‚Äôm suspicious. 
---
Right now, I‚Äôm near site alpha, and I get basically NO visitors at all but I have an open garage with workbenches for any friendly who comes along. Last night, I was finishing a daily and getting ready to get off when I noticed a player lurking at my camp. I had just dealt with an attempted griefer so I seriously considered server hopping but decided to wait and see what he did. 
---
I could tell he was at the workbenches for awhile, then he circled my camp a couple times and went on his way. Just a neutral lvl 25 on his way to Sugar Grove. I was glad I didn‚Äôt switch servers
---
My *total guess* is that if it was as easy as removing the "scrappable" flag from mod item types, they would just do it. Instead, it's probably more complicated like say, mods don't differentiate from junk to the engine, so making them unscrappable means someone has to go through and edit every single mod item individually to fix it.
---
On the other hand, they can fix one-off low hanging fruit like hardened masses and get a lot of good vibes from players about it, so that's worth doing. 
---
Yes Chameleon is a first tier ability and can combine with a large number of afixes, I don't think Nocturnal is one of them, however, I know for a fact you can run Chameleon with Agility +1, and if you're SUPER lucky get the 'decreases your chance of detection' ability that comes on Last Stand (It's an extremely rare legendary ability that pops up so infrequently that most sites don't even record that it exists, which really needs to be ammended). 
---
Honestly though if your going for a stealth build I would wait until they patch wood armor to be able to get three stars, unless your going for a 'hybrid' stealth build the idea is you shouldn't get into combat at all, so the only thing that matters is the stealth related perks.
---
I told him the same thing i got both for 800 caps plus 3 other 3 star melees
---
3* mob drops gold fork... nothing else.
---
There's plenty of good locations. Yes, you might have to deal with the occasional enemy spawn, but that just comes with the territory of camping in a post apocalyptic wasteland. There are literally hundreds of resource nodes scattered across the map, pick one you need and throw down a base there until you get the urge to move.
---
Check this out: https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png
---
Maybe just don't play it if you don't like the game
---
As an Australian, this would be a great idea, I could find servers that didn‚Äôt make me die randomly from lag. It would also be nice in the way that you could see how many people had bounties and all, if they were nice peaceful or gonna kill you (if that makes sense)
---
You took 15 minutes to write a paragraph containing literally the most generic arguments surrounding the game , I could sit here and tell you what‚Äôs wrong with all of them but I‚Äôll start off with the fact that Bethesda are investing in upgrading their engine for the creation of ESO6 and Starfield.
---
The serums are surprisingly cheap to craft.  It's just getting the plan that's a nuisance and those are starting to get around quite a bit now.
---
I've built dozens of camps in gorgeous spots that usually have water and a resource node.
---
How are you searching for camp spots?
---
Honestly feels like we got the beta, and the real game should be coming... but this is the full game. Smh
---
I don‚Äôt think people who used the stash exploit should be banned. It‚Äôs not fair that the stash size is so insanely tiny. I knew some players who never duped or even bought stuff off here and only ever used that stash exploit and the excavator PA one.
---
It's seems to be different for everyone. I've had zero crashes all day. Guy I play with had 5 in 30 min. 
---
If you have actually played ark you would know that, A. The pvp is absolutley shit and B. That the game was not designed to be played the way that the trolls and greifers are playing it. 
---
The fact that some paper weighs that much shows he has been wiping his ass with them.
---
I actually read a response from Beth statin they are doing it because it is easier to hotfix pc then console so basically PC is the guinea pig for console updates
---
Why?  Im low level and just set up there as I was trying to do a mission. No turrets at my place though I think they might attack the local robots that seem to be neutral. 
---
Agreed!  Thankfully I had a friend warn me not to repeat his mistake and delete the lvl 25 ones so I could upgrade it later. 
---
Why do you think he‚Äôs lying?
---
I'd rather have a short list of bulked items than a zillion unbroken items or even loose scraps. I pick up enough plastic it's almost never a problem and makes my inventory a little more sane. Also a bit easier to figure out exactly how much you have of something.
---
You ALWAYS have options. Not to sound dismissive but, when anything becomes work like and it‚Äôs no longer fun, that should be the bellwether test and to leave.
---
Or just take some time away from the game.
---
My second build has been stealth pistols mainly using suppressed pipe revolver. Everything was good until yesterday evening when at  Harper's ferry a level 130 popped in (I'm 47) &amp; my sneak attack bonus stopped working against the high level mutants &amp; they found me fast. I was doing very little damage to them &amp; they were all swarming my locations no matter where I was &amp; instantly went from hidden to danger each time I shot at one. Prior to that I have not had much issues when dealing with very high level opponents when stealthed.
---
Thanks for the info! Will stay and level up for now
---
Thanks for the stats. See also the other reply I received. Both his and your reply got me eager to find ands use nocturnal.
---
Over 50% is very much. I've always played with 2 sets of armor on me. I will only wear it when the buff makes the set stronger than the other set I have.
---
2 always spawn at the whitespring golf coarse
---
Ever seen one before cause i sure haven't. It shoots one pellet like the pistol too. Also the picture displayed when viewed/inspected in the pip boy doesn't match what it looks like when i actually hold it. 
---
I recommend Tame with animal Friend card. 
---
Yep, the dealer ghouls.
---
Was also kind of funny early in the game when you'd drop one that had literally 100's of lbs of "stuff" on it.  Remember many a time hitting one and having to sit and spam the "pick up" button in the middle of a fight wondering when the heck it was going to end.  I swear some of them took 10 seconds to clean out!
---
Yea its a good location, ive seen it before, but I usually stick to the south, dont want to spend too many caps, y'know?
---
Nah
---
Why do I feel this is because the content either hasn‚Äôt been added or that entering the door will be like entering a whole new instance inside of the Resort. 
---
Either way I‚Äôm excited to see these areas become unlocked! Thanks for the fun post. 
---
Half of the points you made were mere speculation, exaggerated or just not true. 
---
Of course prove me wrong by posting verfiaboe sources. 
---
There are a ton of good spots it really comes down to what you are wanting though. There are like 20 great spots for cliffside manors. There are spots that you can grab that have power sources you can tap into. There are small flats, there are areas with water that have prebuilts.   
---
There is a double building with already functional stations.   
---
Aside from my whitesprings vendor character, I never have an issue with my camp. Yes there are hotspots but there are a ton that are not.   
---
I am thinking of posting up in Charleston area now since I never see camps there and you can utilize the prebuilts.    
---
I mean if you want low chance enemy spawn and 1-2 resources in your camp area plus water well that is harder. If you are fine with the small waters and 1 resource and say you want junk there is about 20 10 of which has water 4 of which also has constant radstags/other good meats.
---
I saw some websites and forums for character builds,will check them out!
---
Yeah my game experience (pc) seems slightly different to what I read.
---
Today for example I took part in 3 back to back SBQ fights - as soon as she was dead another nuke was inbound minutes later. Most of the server was there. The queen didnt die in ultra quick time - took about 5 mins with ~20 people shooting her.
---
Then I decided to dump a raider chassis and a bunch of plans on a lv21 guy. Asked for nothing in return. Got a heart.
---
Then randomly found someones camp. He comes to the roof to check why someone is at his camp. I wave. He waves back.
---
Thats most evenings.
---
They can‚Äôt delete characters like that. I‚Äôm legit and my alt has over 10k weight from all the junk, meds and other stuff I keep on it because the stash size is so low.
---
Fucking lazy ass Bethesda...
---
200?
---
How Bethesda Can Fix the Duplication Exploits for Good
---
Patching an item duplication exploit only makes exploiters find other methods, so all duplication exploits can never really be patched. Duplicated items in F76 cannot be identified by the game because they do not have a unique identifier (I'm not talking about their object ID used to spawn them like in F4). If the game gave every item that is created a unique identifier with numbers (and/or letters), it would be able to detect duplicated items and then simply delete them from the server. This should not be complicated to implement in the game and would only require minimal effort.
---
Electric fences would be so cool too have also
---
if it was in the nuke zone, then they werent wearing the kind of armor that is better than power armor since it doesnt have enough rad resistance. high tier armor does not get one shot by TSE handmade unless they stacked a bunch of handmades
---
Isn't this a case of beauty being in the eye of the beholder?
---
What you may consider to be a good camp that suits your needs may not be the same as someone else's wants/requirements.
---
Alright why can I not find this dang stage lol
---
Pretty sure you can't fast travel into a nuke zone at all, event or not. 
---
My turret desteoyed half my base before my overencumbered ass saddled back there
---
Y'know, walking around, looking for a camp location, the simple way.
---
Fair enough lol
---
Or you can build it somewhere else. Just use a random PA station. You don't have to create the parts in that basement. When you are done go there and register the PA.
---
I accidentally scrapped the uniform
---
With Weapon Artisan and Gunsmith, my guns last a pretty long time, but when I do have to do a round of repairs, springs get hit hard. Same deal for Fix It Good and power armor, of which I maintain two suits. I max out the vendor circuit everyday, good for 200 credits per faction. I sometimes buy steel, I sometimes buy springs. However, I also farm Sugar Grove for 30-35 springs per run in a 24 hour cycle. When I know it's getting close to repair time, I stock up there a few days in a row.
---
ban this asshole right now, 2 lovely big juicy plump mouth watering melons, not on my watch
---
Doesn‚Äôt it tell you what perk or materials  you‚Äôre missing to create?
---
In that case, just wander the map and look for someplace with a nice view. I had a home on the south edge of the savage divide overlooking the bog and Watoga for a while, and it was nice. It also made for reduced fast travel costs.
---
Can you shoot a fatman at your feet to see if you die?
---
Does that mean you agree with me?
---
&gt;I can smell the downvotes
---
Yes , that‚Äôs understandable considering this post is just wrong and misinformed in so many ways ( in basically every point ) 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I haven't seen a single sentinel piece, what up with that?
---
You can blow up a car with just padded, though.
---
Do your limbs break? I fired an explosive harpoon into a wall and took no damage, but it broke my leg. Better than dying, but weird since there's no damage registered.
---
If you want even more damage resistance shenanigans don't forget to stack Nerd Rage, Empath, and Lone Wanderer.
---
I can‚Äôt tell for sure but your post tells me that probably think he killed all those people. He didn‚Äôt, he destroyed a camp.
---
It really doesnt sound like you have alot of experience in ark tbh. Ive never even heard of a server that rolls back for pvp (except the ddos'ers on official) its not the pvp itself that is the issue in ark, its the duping, the meshing and the ddosing
---
Maybe like an event, like the one (what‚Äôs it called?) where you have to find the food and put it into the thing? I‚Äôm not sure, but maybe an event so that it‚Äôs not always available but you could get some other stuff as well
---
No, it doesn't appear
---
maybe it gets affected by shotgun perks? I have one but not high enough level to use it yet.
---
I‚Äôve played for about 25 hours and found an explosive pump shotgun.while completing the uranium extraction event.\_‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢_/
---
It is a shotgun/pistol hybrid
---
Exaggerating much? Never had my base damaged as much as you claim is happening. Sure it's not players doing it?
---
These guys are great, they are my only source of grape mentants
---
Is there another source of grape mentants? 
---
MOOOOM AND DAAAAD COME TELL THIS DUDE THAT THIS IS TRUE
---
u/dyeforlove u/dyecasting 
---
I'm not sure if I would consider it lazy for them to not add anything behind a door that is usually inaccessible.
---
I'll bring you a Marsupial.
---
Ooftimus Prime*
---
FTFY ;)
---
You‚Äôre just being needlessly contrary 
---
You should ask them‚Äî u/dyeforlove and u/dyecasting! 
---
Thats what i thought at first, but it shoots just like the regular pistol and isn't affected by shotgun perks. 
---
I would recommend you think differently. The bad bugs have made it acceptable to grief on the pretense that someone with a lot of good items is a duper. 
---
Can you not get it again from the whatsimicator at the HQ?
---
Hey Mom was this them? u/dyeforlove? 
---
It does slightly more damage but has reduced range
---
Problem is you can‚Äôt tell if a gun is duped or not, and that fact alone should not stop people from buying on this marketplace. It‚Äôs nice to have the entire community of your gaming platform to interact with on here.
---
I'm having significantly more issues when first starting as well. Loading much longer, loading twice, etc. I've had 2 blue screen crashes in about 10 minutes as well. Yikes.
---
Thought it was just me. Definitely from the update.
---
For having areas that aren't ready for release yet? They'll get filled in later, if they are used at all.
---
Someone destroyed my CAMP today, in fact. And as it turned out, I didn't have all the resources needed for a 1-button repair.
---
My wife has one on her account it's pretty bad ass would love to find one for myself perhaps even a legendary one
---
How is that even close to logical lol, if a level 82 had a lucky drop then he would most definitely have best in game weapons.  Just cause it takes one person 1k or 2k or 50k legendaries for that two shot explosive, could take any one else 1 or 2 drops for it.
---
I got a tse gatling gun at level 52....
---
I'm a simple man, just need a place with some water and a view.
---
I checked it with shotgunner and expert shotgunner and neither one affected the damage.  Don't have the one for carry weight, but i imagine it wouldn't work for that either.
---
a blunderbus is basically a shotgun. it's a closer range and i believe higher damage version of the powder pistol
---
Sentinel is shorthand from fallout 4.   It's the effect that says "-15% damage when standing and not moving".  I found 2 on my own, traded for others.  The days of people with legit pieces is likely numbered as duping persists and now everyone wants it pretty much.
---
It seems to allow you to load completely before actually entering the game.  So no more waiting and being attacked by enemies with no way to defend.  This is at least what I have experienced.
---
Ooh I want that emote üòÇ but yes there nerds to ge more unique "I'm friendly" ones 
---
I have a daisycutter, I should try.  Went back to RDR2 for now though.
---
Good thing I make over 140k a year. I‚Äôm a hothead. I have broken a ton of controllers out of rage. People‚Äôs assholeish behavior really make me angry sometimes. I don‚Äôt know how people could just say ‚Äúaw, shucks‚Äù after hours of progress was destroyed. 
---
You should have seen me rage on Ark when my year old empire was demolished in 2 hours by an insider. That stuff should be considered bannable, way too hardcore.
---
Aaaaah gotcha. Thanks for the clarification!
---
What about a big guns character? Would T-51b (or other PA for that matter), not be better than regular legendary armor? I'm not sure but I've assumed big guns are better to handle in PA so I'm building my big gun char around T-51b PA and X-01 for nuke zones, based on this info [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0iq9v/all\_max\_level\_power\_armors\_stats/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0iq9v/all_max_level_power_armors_stats/)

Or maybe the door is inaccessible because they were to lazy to make a room. If there was going to be nothing there. They could of made it a bare wall. This on the other hand looks like they gave up 1/3 of the way and was like eh, lock them. 
---
&gt;However most games also have a sizable portion of their player base not engaging in the cash market. It fucks up the pure trade market for those players.
---
that's a non-issue. I'm a little confused here because you basically said so yourself, every game with a cash/black market has a significant part of the playerbase not engaging in it and that's their prerogative.
---
if it affects their make-believe currency that's their problem. not to mention a boatload of things could crash the market, not just the use of actual currency. I'm not gonna be mindful of other players, especially when I'm being forced to be online.
---
ultimately it's up to Bethesda. as it stands, the game has no personality. is it a singleplayer experience? or is it multiplayer? there's not enough content to justify the former and the mechanics are too constrictive to qualify as the latter. I guess we're both right within our playstyles, but they need to pick one and go with it.
---
Might be a silly idea, but try swapping JUST the lega with a different set of PA parts?
---
A set of Raider legs are easy to find, and cheap to repair. Just to see if it could be some unknown effect causing your breakages...
---
Some people are just dicks, even when theyre new. 
---
I offered to trade a low level some stims. I set 15 at 0 caps. He ignored them completely and requested the 53 I had on me. Like really dude? It'll take you 4 hours to find 15 stimpaks at your level and you wanna turn your nose up to them? I just exited the trade and he didnt get any then. He messaged me asking me to come back, I said no, you had your chance.
---
The guy likely had thousands of weight in two shot explosives etc. If so, he wasn‚Äôt legit. Without having been there we have to take the op‚Äôs word for it.
---
Better advice would be to never buy mods unless you can use them immediately. Even non-bulked, if you ever run out of something without out knowing it, they will get eaten up. It's pretty much a ticking time bomb and it's easier just not to hold them.

Congrats on an unarmed scorch beast kill. Now try fighting 3 at once.

Equip power armor and a different weapon + perks. The free All Rise you get from questing only weighs 2lbs so you can carry it around for this.
---
Yeah it kind of sucks but most of your stats &amp; gear will translate over to clubbing things with a sledge just fine.
---
Honestly, I would LOVE a backpack, like a military style camp back pack, because of the rule of ‚Äúit‚Äôs just cosmetic and doesn‚Äôt grant any in game bonus‚Äù it could give you extra carry weight or anything, but I would still like to see one 
---
Wait, so you‚Äôre telling me you are going to quit if the ability for people to pay for buffs/resource advantages/etc......but people are just going and buying all the best sets of gear, weapons, buffs, etc online right now and you‚Äôre still playing?
---
Where the hell is the logic here? 
---
Any melee build with incisor can 1 hit kill anyone in any armor including PA. most people know the op builds. So Pvp all about 1 shotting people nowadays

You can‚Äôt. Use a haz suit or take rad shield

My limbs do break, but then less than 30 seconds later, they magically heal.

I don't like low hp stuff, but I would think empath would be a bad thing.

And yes, the fact that it appears to be 0 damage is probably not intended, but who knows anymore.

After elderscrolls and this game I'm not going to be giving Bethesda any more of my money. I'm looking forward to this

Maybe going back to the original creators will bring back the magic they lost with this game. 
---
I like to dabble with DCUO as well but that's just because I can be all the superheroes I made up as a kid and it's awesome. It's also kinda clunky and the UI is a disaster, so I don't reccomend it to just anyone. But if you like an insane amount of customization on your very own super hero or villain, give it a whirl. It's free to download and play on all systems.

PS4, acatindisguise, game disconnected twice at first boot up, second boot up it spawned me into the world with nothing else loaded but I began taking damage, tried to get back into server and I‚Äôm getting a grid instead of a loading screen and it‚Äôs been over two minutes of loading now.

I see them all the time. packs, too. apparently cats are the only thing unaffected by radiation. they usually flock towards Mr. Veterinarians for protection.

they're aggressive but this one time a pack was walking towards their doom, a group of scorched, so I went ahead and brutallized them. to my surprise, the pack turned around and was now friendly towards me.

I  haven't done a very good job of scouring the Reddit and Internet for plan locations for each item. I posted the ones I have copied from the Where do I Get That community resource (last updated December 28th)  and added any I found and where I found them. Here's the link to the community resource:

Someone like you dropped a nuke on me for shits and giggles as I was taking over the Ammo Factory Workshop .. joke was on them as I was just completing one of my challenges of taking over various workshops, luckily had literally just finished. Someone messaged me "You Dead" (not the guy who dropped the nuke)
---
Complete  waste since there was Zero enemies .. I just smh, at least if you not going to do one of the regular areas, at least pick an area with some enemies, even Morgan Town would of been better or maybe the prison or something ..
---
What a shame, fun while it lasted.
---
You got it. I know it can tough being raided, but it's fairly easy to recover from a hit. 
---
I would really like to see the community band together and hunt the raiders. I said it in another thread, but there needs to be a rapid response network. 
---
For some reason my turrets wont attack anything anymore. I have the same issue with scorched.

Still up?

Still spawning nonexistent enemies, preventing workshop claiming. Confirmed on PS4

counter qeustion can you get it again without buying it or redo the quest to get a higher level one?

And honey beasts

They should just post as fakes looking for dupers gear and have 1 person doing this all day. Probably clear 50 dupers a day
---
that's a good idea but only if your camp is near the cat. otherwise it'd have to trek through Appalachia and face things like super mutants, deathclaws, etc.
---
and I don't think it'd survive.
---
As far as I know two shot and quad are on the same potential mod slot so u wont see one with both.
---
Yea, I made an explosives/medicine based character because I wanted to basically be a mad scientist, and it's a ton of grind for all the consumables I use, while being a lot weaker than just heavy melee + power armor in a fight, and my ammo is made of springs, aluminum and screws instead of lead and steel.
---
You sound so sure. The only event I‚Äôve seen inside a nuke zone is Scorched Earth. Next time someone nukes the fissure to bring out the Queen, try it for yourself. I‚Äôve done it about 10 times now. You can fast travel to the event itself, or if you have a teammate already there you can fast travel there for free.
---
If you try to fast travel to a ‚Äúlocation‚Äù inside a nuke zone, It won‚Äôt let you. Events and teammates are a different story.

Yes. I‚Äôm planning on hanging around for a while more.

To everyone commenting they‚Äôre going to quit the game if they introduce these.. wake up.

You‚Äôre already playing a game where this is offered.

People are already buying all the best sets of armor, the best weapons, the best buffs, all recipes/plans and all the resources they want around the clock.

If this is an issue for you I don‚Äôt even know how you‚Äôre playing this game right now. You are ridiculous.

Ah okay my bad. Thanks for the info!

Mine crashed 15 minutes in and it never does so im slightly concerned lol but sure its fine
---
Your just a superhero, berry mentats *never* work lol.

The reason I dislike posts like these is it detracts from the real problem. The game has allowed this. This is not new to Bethesda games, in fact it was why I liked messing around in them and tried to glitch everything out when I was younger.  
---
  
---
I'm tired of people blaming the players. This game is the problem, Bethesda is the problem. At the rate that they provide solutions, there are examples of mods that fix them made virtually over night.

OMG I want to try taming them with my Charisma Alt1!!!

Why do you teleport away? I've had a lot of fun with wanted players choosing to revenge and continue the fight. When they're wanted they're at a severe disadvantage and are an easy kill like you point out. Why not try to fight them at more equal terms?

I have other full sets of power armor, but I'm running excavator because I have almost 600 carry weight in it....and dont take enough damage to wear anything else unless vs the queen

I believe you can only see the plans on the vendor between lvl 15 to 20. They can be obtained by doing the event at the prison in the northern forest/toxic valley region.

Every post is downvoted. Don't take it to heart. There are some salty bastards that don't like you playing and enjoying it.

As folks mention folks who enter your camp won‚Äôt get agg unless you‚Äôve got locks and turrets.

If you‚Äôve got plants they can loot them too

I‚Äôve got useless lvl1 locks on my alt camp  because that‚Äôs her current lockpick level.

When she gets better I can upgrade the locks accordingly

But I‚Äôve got a couple of turrets for random AI. It won‚Äôt stop a tall griefer but it will buy me time to bail and logging off

Naa, just lock explosive to 10 damage and two shot to base receiver damage.

3 level 80 scorchbeasts, and a group of supers hit my base on login. Through sheer principle of refusing to give in I killed them all. Of course I could've just left server but that's no fun.

I might be bucking the trend but I enjoy always being on my toes 
---
First - Formatted for easy reading
---
&gt;Ok, so before I explain the post, its story time!
---
&gt; So i'm looking for a new base spot cause my base is kinda like toxic players, annoying as all hell. I find this great place, on a river, a view, and a mothman spawn location. I plop down my base, rebuild it and thats that. After a week, almost every server im on has my spot taken. I move, same thing. I start wondering why this is, and well, I have no idea. I start thinking about being a nomad, move from base to base, never have a home, etc. But, then I realize, is my base spots are really good, so all of them are taken. I pull a little test and I can confirm my theory. All the "bad ones" arent taken (horrible to build on areas, near enemy spawns, etc). 
---
&gt; (story times over kiddos)
---
&gt; So, this leads to this post. Why are there barely any good camp spots? I mean, most areas have enemy spawns, no water, or just plain look bad. I'm level 74 and i havent seen 10 good base locations yet, only the 5 I know. Are there a lot of good base locations an i'm blind, or are the base locations limited?
---
Quick answer? Because while large areas of the map with water, no spawns, and clean topography are great for camp builders, it's not very entertaining for actually playing the game. Larger areas fo the map with no action just leads to boredom.
---
Start with your must-have - do you want water? do you want resources? do you want a central area you can use for fast travel? Personally I am always running out of water, so the next time I move it needs to be by a river. So i am currently traveling any rivers I come across to look for a nice view.
---
Oh, don‚Äôt worry, I am. It‚Äôs a fantastic game, otherwise.
---
I would consider Psycho and Mentats also core chems (since you craft other chems using those), but those do appear to have recipes. I'm not sure why FO76 does not have recipes for Buffout and Med-X.
---
Yes. I've found it seems to occur more often when I try to open my pip-boy immediately after loading in, and doesn't happen if I take a step first.
---
Was your two handed All Rise
---
?
---
You can get right the fuck out of here with that "you are part of the problem" SJW rhetoric. I've got hundreds of hours on this game across multiple 50+ characters and I've seen one definitive bobblehead duper who was using it to chain farm the queen with 1 shots.
---
The dupers are dumping their horde because they know the ban hammer is coming, meaning more of them are trying to put their duped bobbleheads to use before they are forcibly removed. 
---
That doesn't equate to this being a prevalent issue.
---
I notice the jumping around seems to happen more often if you are using a non-default sort, but it's still a pretty annoying problem. I scrap tons and tons of weapons but I'm still super-careful when I do each one.

Oh ok

Do they work on corpses of freshly killed enemies as well or just the living?

Hi, texture user here.
---
I think you'll be banned if you inject anything into the game, rather than use Bethesda's existing file structure (.ba2, .esp, etc).
---
I have been using an HD map texture, cloud rextures, as well as glowing plans. I just hit my 200th hour with these mods installed last night and my ~270th hour overall.

Not that I know of.

And yes I do

Yes, I meant individually. Since then I got two explosive, several quads and a single useless two shot.

It was suggested in another thread (that person is making a spreadsheet for people to fill put what plans they have as they go, and they were missing these locations, and noted they got their info from your list so you might be missing them too!) that I bring these up to you, though I couldn‚Äôt begin to tell you what level I was when I got them. :( I‚Äôm on PS4, but cam confirm through research/reading the reports of others on Reddit that these are all verified locations!

The Enclave vendor will occasionally have the recipe.  That's what I've relied upon when I can't scrounge up enough from random loot tables.

Hmmm.

Could the items maybe glitched?

Ie: qhen you crafted them originally, they were a different level? Maybe the game has had a brainfart and doesn't adjust values to standard?

Just pulling straws here haha, but maybe a new set of legs?

Thank you!  Love the callout on diluted rad-x here and another comment, will add along with your nuke mats guidance with the next edit

That's pretty much what happened to me.I originally thought it was because i had joined a team when i logged in but i relogged in a different server and it happened again.

How about walking that talk and throw it out there for folks to see?

Now I love fallout..hell I love all of the games every single one including 76 but yeah imo they should work on a new build (or a megapatch) fixing all sorts of shit including duping. Dont release it until its fucking done. Once it is done "nuke" the servers (they should really release a ton of nukes and crash every server right before the patch) once the update is done you log in all characters gone they all died in the nukes start over fresh final fantasy 14 style shit with a twist.
---
But that'll never happen. One can dream right?
---
I get this also, this is their fix of the endless loading screen. So, it is better than an endless loading screen. Though I still get - Falling from the 2nd floor of my non-loaded-yet CAMP and breaking my leg - Invisible enemies fighting me; most times upon logging in. It is due to about a 4000-6000 ping I seemingly have from being routed to a German AWS instead of an Australian or even US AWS. &lt;shrugs&gt;
---
I don't sort my weapons at all. The only thing I sort is my food by spoil.

Oh, so like a team of 4 with empath and all using serums to suppress the negative effects?  wow, with the way the serums are duped and everyone has the  recipes now... dang that's crazy.

Oh darn, well I still feel pretty lucky considering it wasn't a super mutant or something sinister haha :) thank you for the information! :)

no compromise.

Maybe you should take a break if a video game make you angry enough to break your TV. Doesn‚Äôt sound healthy.

Ill have to give that a try. I'm trying to figure out what causes it and if there's any way to fix it once it happens.
---
Just the sound of that gun gets to me now.
---
Seen it, happened to my wife upon loading in. On xbox, she had to back out and load in again
---
This post is hysterical and to be honest never thought I would see someone post it. You literally can build a camp anywhere, there has to be 1000's of locations you can choose from. Sure some of the more popular areas will be busier, but just switching servers will get you your spot, I am speechless. The whole east side of the Savage Divide is filled with endless ponds from Top of the World all the way down to the bottom of the map, there some really cool spots right in the top right of the map, there is just no way you can't find a cool spot that no one else doesn't want.
---
Sure the mineral deposits especially the junk and lead are going to be busier, maybe you just too picky. I just build at a less than scenic spot near the Spruce Workshop just above huntersville I think it is called, not as pretty, but not bad, nice cliff view, decent location. Prior to that I tried to build at Lake Eloise at the lead deposit, but go harassed by Scorchbeasts, but beautiful spot.
---
There loads of pretty scenic spots, but depends what you looking for.
---
I personally loved The Wanderer from Fallout 4. I wished they added it into here too so I could actually have fun listening to it while wandering around.

I'm sitting around 102 and have only seen one or two people with explosive weapons on ps4. Myself, I've never even seen one drop. Found a few two shot weapons though. Still waiting for my two shot lever action dream rifle to drop.

You assume a lot.

You assume that I‚Äôm defensive when in fact I just take pleasure humiliating people who go out of the way to act like an ass. Your game is weak, and in turn was quickly destroyed.

Also, I hadn‚Äôt realized using talk to text for less than 30 seconds at a time would allow me to classify a few sentences as a novel. Does that mean I get payment on top of pleasure?

Turrets take up a bunch of space. Also, I believe any stored items will also take up space.

Every time I return to base.  Preston is there saying the same thing.

Then when I DO go help that settlement.  Wall it in, give everyone guns, put enough turrets up to knock down a supermutant bohemeoth..............if I don't go defend it every time it says............all the turrets are broken and someone is dead the next time they go there.  It's like the instant I leave, they turn off all the turrets, and throw the guns away, and wait for someone to come break everything and kill them.

With one perk Bethesda has nerfed explosive and PA in one fell swoop, of course, it's still OP vs enemies.

Well's there your problem, in my experience, the more turret's you have the worse the attacks tend to be, try removing a few and see if that helps.

if it doesn't then you may have just picked the wrong neighborhood.

The feathered dress!  In Fo4 i had to get lockpick 4 just to get it without killing or pissing off good neighbor but it was glorious and could be modded with balistic weaves. i had it way before final pam, but it would be fun for others to cosplay as her.  I also really enjoyed all the different masks from the nuka world raiders. Especially the operators had some choice looks! If i see these in the atom shop well shame on bethseda for trying to charge me to look cool but itd be a use for all the free aquired atoms i have stocked up.  
---
That's a really sweet thing for you to do.  I hope it brought you a little comfort :)
---
I got a nice 3 star twoshot flamer but the ammo just keeps on dying on me. Crafting ammo must be 50 instead that meager 5. 
---
What are you doing stepbro?
---
It's not glitched items, the third or so time they broke I made a new set of the armor complete.  Also had a level 35 set that by about 45 the legs were breaking.  The legs always consistently break about twice as fast as the rest of the armor.  Its 13 springs and some other crap to repair them, so 26 springs every 8 hours or so....not a huge deal but its definitely there as something I cant just equip and forget.
---
What? Scraps tell you the exact number, they take up the one slot, but if you have any number other than a round ten, then bulk will take two. 
---
But we can agree that not scrapping items is stupid
---
Thank you, this is good to know for when I view items in the future.

I had this happen to me a week and a half ago.  I figured since it was a head shot it was conceivable but then I seen he shot me with a busted ass pipe rifle plus he was only level 30.  I knew something was off.

Do you just need some chameleon armour to do this or do you need more than 1 piece, can you also do something similar in PA ?

It was so epic. At night. He was in full power armour with his headlamp on. Great guy. Thanks for sharing the story, @sonoallie.

Great to hear it's out there to acquire!
---
I wasn't asking for my stealth build. I feel every non-PA build should have one chameleon piece included because it's so useful in pvp.
---
Why would you value Last Stand ( decreases your chance of detection)? Does it increase the chance you do sneak dmg in pvp? I figured it was only useful in pve. But yeah agree that a stealth char is build around not getting damage at all.
---
&gt; I would wait until they patch wood armor to be able to get three stars

Interesting. Why is that? Does wood armor have the least chance for the carrier to become detected out of all armors?

I did and it is!

Did you eat it?

i remember thinking it was super fucking weird that super mutants were just standing there shooting my walls down, then fucked off after. why would they do this? it makes sense for them to steal food, ammo, or want to kill me, but why just shoot down my house walls for no reason?
---
and why the fuck are wolves trying to knock down my house? the base attacks make literally no fucking sense.
---
I have a pistol/infiltrator toon and while I love playing him he just cannot compete with any of my other builds in end game viability. I‚Äôm going to keep him around as a sink for all the 10mm and .44 ammo that I pick up with everyone else and keep crossing my fingers for an anti-armor/explosive 10mm to drop from one of my other toons, but yeah, without some better perks and better pistol hardware options (*please for the love of the game give us a .50 cal pistol that hits hard and reloads fast*) pistol builds are sorta DOA.
---
Oh man, I joined a random event way down on the far south of the ash heap. Popped in and it's a total zoo with mole minors and scorched that are fighting each other? total chaos. Then I realize there's a scorchbeast carpet bombing the whole thing. I gave up pretty fast and re-logged. All quiet this time. Then flap. flap. Relogged probably five times and every single time there's still a scorchbeast there that spots me immediately so I can't fast travel anywhere. Eventually just ran and kited it to the next town, where it finally gave up.
---
Yep. Pretty accessible since people sell serums for 100-500 caps and they're cheap to make from recipe.
---
I don't know for sure which ones are additive or multiplied or how it works but.... it is definitely noticeable.
---
I've taken a TSE double barrel to the chest pre-patch and lived to fire back.
---
Drop them in a paper bag and I'll grab them later. 
---
I think it's because my first game was Eve Online, I take as read that there are dickholes and the game doent care about your feelings.
---
So when a game even does a half asked attempt to make the world not sick, I'm OK.
---
That, and lots of medication.
---
I have 10 tatos, 5 melons a and 500 .38 ,final offer
---
You‚Äôre preaching to the choir of companies of modern day putting out unfinished games, including B.E.T.A. Only with pre-orders, and adding in paid content that should‚Äôve already been in it.
---
Nooo, I only eat ghouls, scorched and mutants haha
---
I'll try it and see. Always happy to learn new things.
---
Other rules may apply here, but this isn't witch hunting
---
Same.
---
It is not a glitch... 3* enemies have a chance to drop a 3* item
---
Name one instance, just one instance in collected human history, where a group of people were in a situation where something could be exploited to that groups immediate benefit and another groups deficit and the first group just altruistically decided not to do it...
---
Not only is that naive thinking proven wrong by literally centuries of historical record it's literally not how human psychology works.
---
For a developer to think: "well who's going to exploit this, are fans are good people" isn't just naive and childish it calls into question their decision making process and whether or not they should in fact hold that position. This entire situation wasn't just avoidable, there are literally dozens of mmo which have come and gone with the times THAT NEVER SUFFERED SIMILAR ISSUES.
---
Yes, people a fallible, however Bethesda gave them this opportunity to be terrible human beings. This is on them...
---
&gt;Bethesda should outline what is acceptable, and expand our possibilities in the future.
---
My God do some of you really need every game spoon-fed to you? What part of WE ARE THE REBUILDERS do you not get. In one breath you say you want more "raider-y" stuff, in another you say (twice, at that) you expect our overlords at BGS to specify just how much raiding is a-ok? Some raider you are. Go forth and terrorize, bro. 
---
Here's an idea: go find Grahm and then follow him around, charging anyone who approaches a "convenience fee" in caps to talk to him or else they get shot on sight. Guarantee you won't get banned for that. Btw you're welcome for the free idea, you owe me 50 caps or I'm coming to fuck up your base, you whiner.
---
Yes, please. üôèüèª
---
Yea, that‚Äôs my daily check now, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen any good plans yet
---
It‚Äôs the medical bay vendor right, not the genomics lab one? 
---
So it‚Äôs not a guarentee...
---
I think k they should also still maintain mixed servers then.
---
I like the role play aspect of players being raiders. It's awesome, and I'm not a raider.
---
Got my first one two days ago. 
---
Explosive Suppressor Combat Rifle.
---
Max they can drop
---
3* = 1/2/3
---
2* = 1/2
---
1* = 1
---
‚ÄúLegendary prefix‚Äù = 1/0 star weapons
---
Haven‚Äôt had that problem. But I‚Äôve have 4 blue screens in the first hour since the patch. 
---
Nope, just a Midrange Murderer. I'm running around with a Handmade and a Lever Action Rifle right now, but just highly modified stock versions with no stars of any sort. I need to get something two-shot before I Become Death.
---
Oh yeah I mean if you're ultimate meta is running a 50 cal or other big gun build and operating in the nuke zone to take out the SBQ, then power armor is your friend. It has it's place for sure, and arguably for end-game the 50 cal is 'one of the best' weapons.  
---
Of course there are people using two shot exploding quad double barrel shotguns that can out DPS that build as well, and you have the issue of having to farm a TON of ammo, and might not want to be doing that in power armor, but it's still one of the best builds. I don't know if the flechette harpoon gun glitch is fixed yet either, but that makes heavy gun builds 'reasonably' sustainable. All high damage builds suffer from the need to regularly repair your weapons except pipe rifle builds.
---
Yea I literally did another nuke right after, it takes me about 15 min. I got a laugh, they got a laugh. We all laughed. 
---
I have heard that the Morgantown area is another good spot. The prison is another interesting idea. The only problem I see is the limited spawn area, and the massive amount of people who travel to nuke zones to soak up exp. 
---
Also, I found out where not to nuke! 
---
&gt;Just got a TSE Gatling Gun on the weekend
---
Can't vats cameleon 
---
Oh great.  Lol well thanks for the heads up. 
---
Actually dig the space suit.
---
I agree but why is this something I see on reddit alot? One person complains while complaining about complainers and then someone comes and complains saying the person themselves are complaining about complainers and how it's annoying. For example someone made a post I complained more than I should have, they proceed to say I'm butt hurt over it when they themselves get butt hurt because I'm not actually butt hurt. Then proceeds them saying I'm retarded and I say that's insanely childish then they say I'm childish for responding? Why continue these ignorant loops. Why do anything. What is life. What is the meaning of reddit?? 
---
I'll give you my marsupial serum next time I'm on bud. My gt is the same as here

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

---
So it's the entire game that occasionally does this. I'm on Xbox. I know people were getting stuck in their power armor but they fixed it. It more freezes my game when it happens. They did your PC patch last week so I'm guessing they've glossed over this issue? 
---
Wonder why big bend tunnel is so bad. Off the top of my head, I'm not sure I've been there more than once. I'm kind of terrified of the entire south of the map. When I get the chance to play again I'll look for it and run it. See if it happens to me too. Maybe then we should submit complaints so they can add it to the patch list, whenever the next one is
---
Been a mod for this since release. 
---
No you can't get banned. It's a simple UI mod. 
---
Fun post. Great picture. üòª
---
Find a group to network with. I've got a network of a few folks and they'll make them for just scrap
---
This makes up for all the bugs in the game. I'm not joking. This is awesome!
---
When you shoot off all robot limbs they also go nuclear. 
---
I found a really nice place in a small canyon that had water and a good plot for crops. Also was right next to a regular scorched spawn point, so I'd come back and have walls missing and they are pretty much always grunting around outside or shooting every 30 seconds when I'm there. I think that lasted about a day before I moved it.
---
It's the same as Minecraft's ender chest. Player specific univeral inventory accessible from different boxes
---
And besides why do you care if I play? How does it effect you?
---
I thought it was 10 power no matter what. Maybe 25? The workshops are definitely only 10.
---
Go into workshop mode and highlight the power box. It will say.
---
agreed.   
---
HAHAHAHAHHA HAHAHAHA. SOOOOOO FUNNY
---
Nah, i just find bots a little annoying. I come to reddit to interact with hoomans. If i wanted to interact with bots i'd open up tinder
---
Yes.
---
But..... Instead of one I had 25 and a bunch of other duplicated crap in my stored tab so.... Free mats.
---
Praying to the RNG gods is unfair. At least make some effects craftable. 
---
i read it all.  im like that.  
---
but pacifist aint it, so we have limited options.  
---
Not all TSE players are dupers 
---
Too bad most the PvPers are also the dupers who've duped zillions of ammo/bobbleheads/etc and have it sitting on mule.    
---
     
---
Somehow these devs managed to FUBAR this game up so bad I quite playing a few months ago and never looked back.      
---
I might try it again in a year or so, but screw them on any DLCs unless they fix these issues and start a new set of servers so people cannot bring the duped mats in.
---
Just checked, my fire breather helmet does NOT provide any DR when at 200% condition. As for crafting, I heard that like with other helmets, you can learn the plans for these from scrapping them.
---
I was getting this issue, I disconnected and rejoined a few times, that sorted it out for me. No idea what else could have caused it.
---
I just had this happen. I could quick travel but no change.
---
Log out, log in. Fixed.
---
Yeah me too!
---
i just wish i had others to help y'know? i tried doing one solo and died alot, made it to the end only to input a recently expired code
---
It never came back after that?
---
I might just grab it if they ban me then that would just be my last straw for this game.
---
I'm on PS4 or I would. You have my condolences. Keep in mind The Rainbow bridge, always comforts me when a 4 legged family member passes.
---
I would also like to know, I use speed demon and hate it when it does it
---
Thanks!
---
Congrats, seems like good stuff is quite rare.  Swear a good third of drops are freaking wood armor.
---
Your idea is great, but I would be doing slap damage. Hence my point, I would would have to get a duper to get me hundreds of bobbleheads to be a threat. I wanna know if I can do that without getting banned, and I don't see it as something that ks okay. So it's doing nothing or too much. And trying to rob is a bit funny, but I have never gotten anything real out of it.
---
Really you didnt 'skip' anything. The main Path of the Overseer mission will take you from faction to faction across the map but they arent really related to each other and it doesn't stop you from doing them in any particular order if you stumble across one.
---
I guess the only real deterrent for lower level players from doing this would be because of what was in those caves :P
---
k bruh
---
If you know where to look you can find a full set pretty quick. Just remember where you found the frames and check em every now and then. They are alllll over.
---
Also to point out, it was the manufacturers decision to utilize plastic for the bottle to achieve a proper product, not Bethesda's. So yeah, anyones argument about that product is moot lol!
---
Ha. Just finished building mine. Except I have a problem where the left leg disappears when I enter my power armor. Any ideas why?
---
Thanks for the info. I think I won't do it now that you've said it 
---
I've not had an issue since.
---
Oh okay kool! Thank you for the info.
---
That‚Äôs true regardless of other players lol
---
It's bad
---
where did u get this drop?
---
Yet I haven‚Äôt seen proof of any of this. Just people manufacturing outrage about it. 
---
the real solution to griefing? put your adult pants on and stop being a baby. repairing your camp from so called "griefers" is inexpensive and we all know you have ample materials. if anything they're doing you a favor ny freeing up some of your stash space.
---
people "grief" to get a reaction out of you. if you don't give them one, they don't have fun. don't repair your base til they go away. once they see you don't care they stop messing with you. it's easy 
---
Well pardon the fuck out of me. Last I knew, it was my goddamn life.
---
That‚Äôs my understanding 
---
Finally, MTHS loot respawned, [got 122 plastic in one run](https://i.imgur.com/pL5jdBN.jpg) :)
---
I highly recommend the Spruce Knob area. It‚Äôs relatively central without being on top of Whitesprings, it has tons of water spots to choose from, it‚Äôs beautiful, plenty of land to place down crops, good hunting variety... 
---
It‚Äôs just a fantastic place. I‚Äôve set up shop there and couldn‚Äôt be happier. Working on a camp tour video that should be done hopefully this week. :)
---
Indeed haha
---
Guy below us in this comments section said it doesn't work
---
All the crafting assets. Elevators, weapon racks, concrete walls. All the Nuka stuff. They need to add all of it, and not lock it in the Atom store either, it should be part of the DLCs were suppose to get.
---
Yup
---
What bothers me is it suggests no other patches until near the end of the month..
---
Yea this happened while I was crafting meds too. It kept popping up and I just gave up. After few sessions I tried again and it worked, so just give it time and maybe it'll fix itself. Also it never came back. 
---
I'll give you 500 for the shotty
---
Best Bot
---
It's a tricky system. Hope it gets sorted out. I would be fully supportive if pacafist was a matchmaking option, getting you into servers with no wanted shit and no player damage
---
You can probably solo the queen just fine with a build centered around a TSE, no problem. I‚Äôve 2 manned it with ease. Your biggest enemy is other players as the add health but not much dps, typically. 
---
shame it's only for the T-51, but thanks for the guide :)
---
Xbox? Ps4? Pc?
---
Me too. I have 3, sometimes 4 turrets and try and place them up with the high line-of-sight. I rarely ever have a problem with enemies actually getting past them now. I also tend to try for naturally defensible locations, like up against a tall cliff, so you only have to cover 180 degrees really.
---
That's the dream! And if the dump it all in the atom store I'll be so disappointed in them
---
I bought mine from another player on here. 300 per mutation. Don't know why I got downvoted. Serum recipes drop from the sbq. Tons of players have them now. Doesn't require any server hopping.
---
Xbox
---
It actually just got fixed. Did a few disconnects yesterday with a full relaunch of the game and no fix. Thanks man
---
Right.  Plan: Grape Mentats seems slightly more rare than Plan: Skeeto Spit (oy), in my experience.
---
HEY PUNK GIVE ME ALL YOUR CAPS. Oh hi, Tommy, your room was right across from mine in the vault right? Well I need those caps pal
---
That's rough dude. I've lost many kitties and it's a sad thing.
---
Yeah I'm down join my party and we can discuss some trades GT SilentStrike935
---
Creatures. Yao guai for springs, deathclaws for gears 
---
If you move your camp, everything you have should get automatically blueprinted and those seem to ignore the restrictions. 
---
Otherwise you‚Äôll want to break your structure into placable pieces. I have one for the foundation I like to use and know if I can place that I can build the whole camp
---
Partially true, certain mobs have a higher drop percentage of certain items, for example lever action drops more often from animals such as death claws, bloated ones, gulpers,  fog crawlers, And a few others. 
---
Yes. I need more than a prisoner collar damnit!
---
Not calling you a liar mate but I have not seen the other dupes yet. I admit though that i do not follow tha youtube glitchers because I am usually busy playing or hanginf in this subreddit when I have free time.
---
Nor intersted in duping myself but I really want the dupers/glitchers gone. I understatand why people would do it for fun, to mess with people or just because it is possible but i truly can not stand people that try to make money of it. Kind of how i do not fully condemn illegal file sharing or the alike but i look down on people making money from it.
---
Sorry for the essay üòÅ. I just really hate what the glitching has brought with it for the economy and idiots griefing with stacked duped bobble heads etc
---
They speak the truth.. 
---
RIP to your lovely cat my friend.
---
i have a cat she is 7 and i dread the day this happens.
---
Be strong and grateful for the life you enjoyed together and love the fallout memorial idea :)&gt;
---
Keep your head up.
---
Can confirm, PS4 is bugged the same. 
---
I learned this the hard way. I just got full x-01 and the jet pack mod. Some grief era destroyed my entire base, stole all my junk (which I had on me to build the armor) and then my TSE shotgunned my armor. I was so fucking pissed. And then these guys were player camp hunting. Fucking assholes.
---
I swear to god, no matter which way you are facing, a mole rat will always spawn directly behind you.
---
If you want to get them all, fine. But if you want specific ones I stand by my point. Read my reply above. Also, you have to hop after each one too and that takes timem
---
Don't forget the LE BB gun from f1 and 2, you could genuinely reach endgame with eye criticals from those things. 
---
I had one but scrapped it, because it had the same stats as the black power pistol but had like 14 range. Didn't seem worth it when i already carry a shotgun with higher range lol.
---
Pvp exist in this game?
---
Cool beans bro but there‚Äôs a problem. I can‚Äôt get on buttt if you‚Äôre on in at 10 tonight (eastern time is where I‚Äôm at) I can trade. If not tonight then we can do some trading tomorrow from 9:30 to 12 I‚Äôll be on 
---
Oh you're going to play and YOU WILL LIKE IT.. 
---
Sorry, yeah I forgot we were talking about just PvP. For PvP the decreased chance of detection is useless as far as I know, unless perception actually does something to detect people with chameleon (It suggests in the loading screen that it helps detect players who are sneaking, but I'm skeptical). IT does nothing for damage. 
---
The thing with wood armor is that in PvE it has the best 'stealth' mod in the game, shroud which makes the user faster when sneaking, reduces the weight of the armor (which does effect sneak), muffles them, and decreases their chance of being detected in the dark, it's basically 4 mods all wrapped into one, but only comes on wood armor.
---
The problem with wood armor is that the 'best' legendary wood armor you can get is only 1 star, which means it can only carry 1 legendary ability. This makes other armors way more preferable even for stealth builds. If wood armor with 3 legendary abilities ever drops then getting all the abilities I listed would be the ultimate PvE sneak armor (And frankly good enough for PvP on the basis of just don't get seen in the first place).
---
Heheh.  Oldboyz sitting here remembering having to switch out 8 3.5" floppies to play Colonel's Bequest.
---
Sorry I do not. It may be worth looking into. I know all the substations have them though. But I had seen a house with it also in the forest but I can't quite remember where. I think it was up by the meth dealers place, uh the sisters something. 
---
I kinda miss having handcuffs, a feather duster and a yardstick lying on my bed
---
Oh thanks for the info! The player we met led us to understand that we may have done it in wrong order. He did not mean any harm tho so. 
---
What was in those caves was indeed bad for my sis but we managed. Me in power armor is a pretty good tank so we survived without any problems.
---
I'll be on for another 6 hours
---
It crashes servers, lags the game and gives people very op loot. Imagine 1000 stimpacks or mini nukes.
---
Did he really have to explain it?  
---
bruh..u don't know how many times I was gonna sell the black diamond..and just couldn't..its such a phenomenal weapon
---
It's not minor when you're trying to trade between team mates. It's awful. 
---
Holy shit bruh lit
---
would happily pay you for a serum if you have any extra
---
I still think its an interesting feature. They could just rework slap damage to have a hard cap.
---
It‚Äôs not just a video game when you spend almost all of your free time building something up for months, just for some psycho/sociopathic fuck to take it all away in less than an hour.
---
WOW
---
I‚Äôll catch you tonight. But if by any chance no will you be on tomorrow?
---
or if it made you invulnerable to pvp like it should.  
---
wont fight?  fuck your base!
---
i also think you should decide at character creation, to stop people from max levelling and then opting in with god tier loadouts.   
---
Yes after 5pm CST got a job lol
---
How does it require server hopping? You can take them all in a row and get the mutations. You don't even have to take starched genes off. I have 8. I bought seven of them and took them all without hopping.
---
No problem I used to run it for a few MMOs to power lvl and as a mule
---
Heat flashes might be from standing in fire/ being dealt fire damage, swamp gas is from strangler hearts from the mire, and I would try breaking a mirror for the whoopsies 
---
I didn't say you won't have them. I was more suggesting it is unreasonable to expect to have them, particularly if you weren't farming for legendaries constantly.
---
Context of my post was lost because of the deleted message I was replying to.
---
It is a big one since griefers use duped bobbles to get insane dmg that allows them to oneshot people in pacifist mode.
---
Their friend can just take the bounty away, rinse and repeat. Kind of a big problem.
---
If cloudatlas doesn't want it for free then I'll give it to you for free. Won't be on tonight though. 
---
I found areduced weight, faster swing speed, instigating Grognak. I let my wife use it and she won‚Äôt give it back.
---
###Please Help Me
---
I understand what you are saying, I even understand where you are coming from (and those who have left to wait for it to evolve).  I don't bash on you guys because you aren't wrong, it has been a buggy mess, which is why I always tell people I love it in spite of it's current flaws.  I am just one of those folks who has 340+ hours (as of this morning), has leveled so many characters to 100 that I have had to delete multiple characters to free up space (HATE the 5 character limit) and yet I still find so much to do, see, explore, and enjoy a lot of times because it's a multiplayer game this time.  Of course I wish it had launched more smoothly and that they hadn't rushed it for Christmas cashflow but... I also am glad I got my hands on it early and have had a chance to dive so deeply into what it is now and watch the evolution into something even better.  It's kind of like dark chocolate for me, it's not always sweet but it's still absolutely delicious chocolate :-)
---
Between watoga train station and this flooded traindepot is a little tower right next to the tracks. There can spawn different types of enemies in a pack of mostly 3. For me, it was a legendary cave cricket who dropped me the shotgun.
---
I tried it and it's just so bad. Even the radscorpion syringe is utter garbage. You would think in a game like this there would be a way to scale the damage or build some super overpowered ultracite-FEV mix for endgame viable damage. Instead it scales the base 5 damage from impact, so with 3x rifleman and 3x bloody mess, you can get a whopping 9 damage per shot before the syringe effect kicks in. You can one-shot a level 1 scorched with it, but only if you get a sneak attack critical to the head
---

sounds good man thanks

Right now 6.50
---
Happy cake day! Any tips on screws or do I need to just ravage homes?
---
No, for front page you have to start your title with 'Dear Bethesda' so everyone knows it's more important than others, then follow up with the most insubstantial request you can think of
---
Ohhh ok. So you‚Äôll be on all day tomorrow?

Auto team chat is buggy and literally only allows your fellow team members to hear you when they are also on Auto. Have to switch over to local for non-party members to hear you. 
---
You can raid bases, plus it lags and crashed servers.
---
Flatwoods monster works since it is a zetan, granted I have now only seen 3 of them they are around. 
---
Did some rough math and there‚Äôs well under a 0.08% chance that the legendary you pick up will be a TSE. And thats just that you will find a random one, not the multiple 50 cals and shotguns you see the most of. 
---
That's crazy talk! All you need is chems man! Just fill up that overseer box with chems!
---
Honestly I haven't touched 76 single the bulldozer patch. All my friends stopped playing so I'm completly alone if I do go back and play. The kicker is i got the power armor edition so I paid 200$ for something i dont play.
---
I tried doing this the other night only to watch a level 75 collect all of my placements then fast travelled when I said those were for noobs.  Really pissed me off.
---
That said, trying to approach a skittish new player to give them stuff is also tricky.
---
No, they dont count
---
1.5 caps
---
For mine I had to move my camp one more time. 
---
By ruining other peoples fun!
---
No after 5 PM CTS so basically 22 hours from now
---
It's easy when you have the map giving you the player's location....and don't need to expend resources to find them.
---
Right üòÇ
---
Yea exactly it never happened to me but ik it would ruin the game for a bit for me too. I'm pretty sure (I could be wrong) that the system works only if someone deals several rounds of damage before they become wanted, which could mean why they weren't wanted, considering they one shouted y'all. I've shot people on accident before only once and I haven't gotten wanted cause of that. 
---
Lol.  I remember those days to buddy.  44 year old 
---
I mean, I'm the same way at this point. It's just such a needed mod that it's annoying to not use it.
---
Lvl 82, just got an explosive 10mm handgun and got a 2 shot minigun a few lvls back in whitesprings, thats it. Have a new alt to test a stealth build and got a 3* lvl 1 shotgun by lvl 6, odd.
---
Windows? Doors? Locks? What are you people on about?

---
Just food for thought stacking bobbleheads and magazines is a intended mechanic had it pop up as one of the tips on the loading screen.
---
It would be great if people had an air of mystery when you found them. Not an air of a level 230 with maxed build perfect for a tse weopon and power armor while you are stuck with the basic shit after getting in some bad scraps.
---
Yeah, move it again and break down the blueprint should reset the ‚Äòstored‚Äô tab
---
Agreed bob.
---
Ok. So I‚Äôll be on tomorrow, in your time, from 8:30 to 11 in the morning. Is that good with you?
---
We are all having fun here.
---
its definitely fun..a lot of show-offs there
---
I REALLY want a 2 shot western revolver. have you seen any drop?
---
Sad but true. Done this a few times and it's always a deal-breaker.
---
Sorry for your loss, pal.
---
Ghost riders in the skyyyyy
---
Definitely Butcher Pete. Jammed to that so hard in 3
---
This!
---
Ditto never seen that happen before, only thing that fixes it is login out and back in
---
The more I look at it the more I regret putting it on my "bad" list. It genuinely is really cool looking,  I'm just a little salty that they're charging so much for a simple retexture. 
---
Only fun in low levels like 5-15. Pipe weapons or hunting rifle/shotguns, actually enjoying ourselves while running through cover and trees, with minimal perks for OP bs. Then everything gets stupid afterward, guns and perk and bobble stacking. 
---
Wow that is fucking annoying. Wouldnt be that bad if it did the same thing going right
---
Thank you for the info. I'll update the spreadsheet. Also consider adding your locations to the community resource linked above.
---
That's funny it is how I completed mine. Would you like a screenshot of it completed?    
---
I LOVE this guide. As a fellow altoholic who is getting ready to start his first alt I knew I had gone about things wrong on my first time through to 50. Please do more of these as you get insights. 
---
100% the wanderer
---
This post has restored my faith in humanity lol
---
Why Don't You Do Right?
---
If you've only seen one definitive bobble head duper, then  you must be the kind of person who ignores every team invite you have ever gotten and must have zero interaction with other players. Or you haven't played for as many hours as you claim. If you have leveled past 100 and have interacted with other players on a routine basis, then you know that this kind of stuff  is rampant.  
---
PRAISE THE LORD!
---
AND PASS THE AMMUNITION! 
---
OK but point being you wouldn't *have* to shoot them (most of them, anyway), people would pay up. Or, in the event of high level players like myself, I'd either think it was clever and pay a small tribute or love to get into PVP with you if I found someone ballsy enough to charge a Grahm tax.
---
I remember in beta there were people setting up toll roads to charge ultra-noobs to pass. If you're on mic you have even more possibilities, you could be like that scammer dude in New Vegas who charged newcomers an arm and a leg to get across Freeside and had his buddies fake all this violence he "saved" them from so people would pay for the protection. Just join up with low levels outside of the Vault and offer to escort them across the dangerous terrain, and set it up so a buddy tries to PVP you but you kill him and say to the noon "see? It was lucky I was here to kill that guy for you! How many caps do you have on you?"
---
All shit-talking aside, it's good you're thinking of "honest" ways to raid, you just need to think some more on it. There are so many ways to do it without being a lazy cheater, I'm sure you can find some. I honestly would LOVE to find a real raider out there in the world, I'd give one my shit just out of gratitude for putting some effort into this game.
---
I KNEW I WAS KEEPING THEM FOR SOMETHING!!
---
HA!!
---
dont run from me if you see me in the wasteland i have tse weapons but im not a duper or a griefer just a lvl 45 trying to get by ;0  
---
I call em Raver Ghouls
---
Civilization. Thanks for sponsoring this giveaway!
---
Thank you! I had fun chasing it down for a bit until it let me take a picture haha
---
I always use Local chat when talking to someone I'm not teamed with. However I noticed some noobs will still run away and not acknowledge me. I'm convinced those players just do not speak English and have no idea what I am saying. 
---
anyone know if the game runs better now on the normal ps4? played the game for a day or two but decided to wait for some mayor bug fixes etc.
---
hopefully ill get lucky one day and get to a vendor right after someone just sold a TSE..Doubtful tho
---
Until one day you hear the sickening sound of missiles destroying all your crops as it tries to hit that one bloatfly bobbing around your camp. 
---
I'm almost positive that was fixed in the last last patch. It was the first mutation I got. I've added 6 more since then and they all work perfectly. 
---
seriously? :'( I used tons of times to build it as I want it. But if this is the only way to fix it..
---
Oh really  haha.  I just park myself in a corner of the pro shop and slice and dice. Come get your medicine I yell...lol
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø  
---
thanks you too I guess :'(
---
Your character spawns in but the textures still have a delay in the load 
---
That's what I was saying. 
---
Really? I've killed 10 of them and they never counted
---
thx
---
Most likely not of it's the same as other things
---
What platform?
---
That's happened to me like seven different times, never figured out why either
---
I once came across two black cats while traveling down a road. When I got close to one, it just flopped over - dead - then a pack of feral ghouls spawned behind me. 
---
Not sure if it was a scripted event, but I‚Äôm wary of any black cats I come across in the future. 
---
I‚Äôd stick with leather armor until it requires ballistic fiber to craft. Level one leather armor is very cheap to craft, and you can repeatedly craft and scrap it until you learn all the mods. This lets you obtain much higher resistances than other armor at low levels. If your looking for low level legendary items, you can do the leader of the pack event, in the forest. This event spawns 3 legendary wolves, which drop level 10 and 15 gear.
---
For melee, it granted health regen each swing, didn't matter if you connected with an enemy or not. They fixed that with the most recent patch, where now it only heals when you actually connect on a enemy. 
---
It‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to for games of this nature. 
---
Oh damn...I hadn't tried that yet. That sucks ass.
---
Trading like a muthafucka. Buying low, selling high. Monitoring Reddit and Discord for deals. It's fun for me - I can spend like 4 hours in game without even leaving my camp.
---
I suppose the almighty Mothman embraces who deserve it and culls the unworthy. 
---
The interloper has spoken I guess. 
---
Just use 2 stims... who cares, they are everywhere. 
---
I have a TSE ultra cute pistol, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve seen as far as hand guns go. We have a few E revolvers but not TSE
---
I have noticed this as well. It's a much appreciated addition that wasn't in the notes, that I remember. Thanks Bethesda!
---
Now, if only I could get my game to quit freezing randomly... 
---
* If once player gets Wanted, the entire party gets wanted
---
* Just like blocking a player blocks local voice chat, have Wanted only hearing a garbled version
---
These would help take care of the rising instance of 'clean' players helping wanted find other player and camps
---
* Increase the wanted penalties. Make it a portion of their caps or value of their equipped weapons &amp; armor. And actually take it out of their bank.
---
Currently their bounty is too small to attract other players and isn't really any penalty to the greifer. And I agree no team members should be able to collect. maybe no recent team members either, put a 5 min timer on it.
---
HUH??
---
Sucks but using spec points on thirst buff perks is a total necessity. I have three ground purifiers going and am sitting on tons of purified water at the moment. The game mechanic is still annoying but I'm basically never thirsty now at least, and generate plenty of excess I can sell off.
---
There‚Äôs a pirate hat?!
---
BEYOND disappointed. I was saying this the other day, but got downvoted. I think Atom Store LIMITED items need to never be something like this. They should always be some sort of reskin or something like that. Im content knowing things like Fish in Lamp and the Nuka Cola Quantum sign will be there when i can/decide to purchase them. Would be horribly upset if met with items like this as a Limited item. If they start doing that, i fear my beloved Elevator may meet that fate.
---
Hope my paranoia makes sense.
---
Quickly slapped on pre-alpha pvp that less than 1% of people do. Meh, this exploit is a bigger problem in PVE with 1 shotting queen.
---
HOW IS THIS NOT FIXED YES?
---
(Also Hoping they don't nerf curator lol, I want that 1 bobblehead up on all times!)
---
Only ever launched nukes solo cuz im in the no-friends zone. But yeah, totes.
---
yeah..the golf club and the surrounding areas seem like the most popular area..I love whitesprings
---
The only person who can possibly believe that is someone who has played solo 100 percent of the game with zero interaction with other players.  If you are past level 100 and have socialized to any degree, then you know what the OP is saying is an indisputable fact. 
---
The constant flashing of my slave's collar is too distracting. Options would be nice.
---
I just hope they do something about TSE. This meta shit is boring as hell. 
---
i think i ran into a bug yesterday where all the legendaries i encountered EXCEPT the robots exploded.
---
I was thinking about possible pvp in the nuke zone. The SBQ or any npc for that matter have ceased to be a challenge for me, although admittedly, I doubt I can take her on on my own. Cause pve generally is no challenge, my builds always come two fold. Primary build focusses on pvp, trying to be as strong as possible focussed around one weapon type, while the secondary build on the same char, using the same special points, is for quality of life outside of pvp, with health and rads regen, lower food spoil, speed, carry weight and such.
---
I almost never have had an issue with resources to repair or for ammo. There's a lot of people getting wanted who are surprisingly carrying loads of junk on them. Their junk, in combination with what I pick up myself, produce at workshops and receive for free from friends who only play one character and always have stuff to give away cause having a full stash, have made resources an afterthought in this game so far for me. That being said, I lack experience in many area's and have not yet used very advanced PA and I read these are more expensive to repair than the T-45 and Raider PA's I've been using so far.
---
Thanks again for your replies. I've been looking for more info on pvp on this sub, but most of the time get drawn into discussions where people tell me to not pvp in FO76 because it's only one shots from dupe related players, which is far from the reality, so I get drawn into discussions around that and miss out on the fun of actually theory crafting builds and making tactics for my team. Cheers!
---
I don‚Äôt understand that a vendor has 0 caps, I buy something for 100 caps and now the vendor has 14 caps...shouldn‚Äôt it now have 100? ü§Ø
---
Yep it was the last one I had to do killed that floating purple bastard in the bog and it popped. 
---
Not sure why, I never used speed demon
---
I lurk the subs a lot though, so I‚Äôve seen a few reports of weird interactions with it
---
My boyfriend is having the same issue. It freezes as soon as he loads in. No blue screens yet. 
---
I was waiting for something scary to happen, honestly!
---
I would love to go against a relatively intelligent one, that knows how to dodge, and hide behind stuff whilst it throws rocks.
---
I did notice while shooting at a level 95 Behemoth  from atop a Whitesprings gatehouse, (which is safe btw) that they are BLOODY QUICK,  if you're not paying attention they close the gap even when you're running away!
---
It allows you to wear a hazmat without having to remove all gear and takes away the bonuses I guess. it‚Äôs a little beefier than the hazmat as well.
---
Buy one set of power armor skins, and you've spent almost double that 1k limit you set for yourself.
---
I really loved it to be honest.
---
I'm a ghhhoooosssst
---
Was it really 30 seconds?! I'd have a couple of seconds previously. On PC here.
---
With each other not with itself
---
Wendigos I think
---
It's been a long time since I played fallout so i dont know any of the music lol.
---
Try defending a workshop against someone with a TSE shotgun. Or participating in a group event when 1 player can 1-shot a whole wave of mobs, including the legendaries.
---
Actually, it looks  like OP is all for PVP, just against the current fad of a "clean" player teaming up with a "griefer" to point out soft targets for them to attack.
---
Haha sorry you did say exactly that, I remembered seein this earlier and didnt understand your post at first (autocorrect to stroll), I came back here and didnt reread it.
---
it specifically mentioned finding the same magazine
---
Yeah it's weird. There are basically just two perk cards that affect unarmed damage:
---
Iron Fist
---
Martial Artist (weight, swing speed)
---
Incisor I don't know. It might but I haven't done any testing with it and random mobs aren't what I'd call proper testing.

Glad I could help :)
---
That‚Äôs lame, especially if it‚Äôs level 5 gear they are taking. 
---
Are you using the power patcher perk?
---
I notice they dont explode for me everytime. I will hang back waiting for the explosion and nothing happens. The ones that spawn in Watoga get me everytime 
---
Literally both spawn in watoga and or harpers ferry.
---
That's... Actually a good question, I will test later.
---
Its annoying. I killed at least 10 3 stars today and only got 1 star loot. extremely unfun.
---
Yeah actually the FIRST time I ever experienced being wrecked by invisible enemies while loading in/unable to pull my weapon out was just now post-patch. This is very much still a thing. 
---
What‚Äôs the difference between underarmor and underarmor lining ? 
---
Why do I have to always kill the invaders my turrets never do the work
---
Yes. Stealth sniper builds are pretty common. Use perks like rifleman to increase overall damage. Many stealthy sniper builds use V.A.T.S with critical hits too. Usually, you should put your special points in agility, perception and luck. The best perks for this build are Covert Operative, Escape Artist, Mister Sandman and Sneak (all of which are in Agility). 
---
Same tho. Keep those shit eating turrets away and grind like the rest of us
---
You seem knowledgeable. What‚Äôs the difference between underarmor and underarmor lining ?
---
And it seems I have been proven wrong- props to your family for being cool! 
---
Ugh Iv been saying this since I found out this isn‚Äôt already a thing
---
Where is proof of this?
---
I can understand that but after all the posts I‚Äôve seen on here and directly at Bethesda on Twitter  about wanting more wasteland ‚Äúroleplaying‚Äùtype paints especially after the holiday paints/items they go and roll out perhaps the most 7-8 yr old gamer crap I‚Äôve ever seen in a game not rated G and on Nintendo. 
---
That‚Äôs lame, especially if it‚Äôs level 5 gear they are taking.
---
Flatwoods.  There are two strung up at the tents and they tend to spawn across the creek as well.
---
Yep, and post video of themselves doing it, pour encourager les autres.
---
My advice: pay attention to what level mobs spawn and find a place where it's manageable. it's tedious trial and error but ultimately that's what will fix this. Some places I would get enemies showing up 100% of the times I traveled to CAMP. Almost no place will be totally dead, but there's a big range between good spots and bad spots.
---
Let me tell you guys a little story about how I lost my x01 calibrated shocks mod after searching for a life time..  They scrapped them.. The end. 
---
Whoops
---
VATs possibly for precision shots but sniper perk my make that not necessary.
---
Min/Max-er?
---
That sounds lIke he could be naked since he was outside of the fight kill zone. Also excavator is the worst for combat by design. So your point kinda sounds off 
---
Fun fact (that I totally made up): Legitimately only six TSE weapons have dropped, all others are dupes of those original six. 
---
So the illiterate super mutants downvoting me because of ‚Äúcertification‚Äù  can very much walk into a vat of nuclear waste without any rad-x
---
Idk man. Stimpacks wouldn't be able to stack then.
---
So you are complaining that you were selling duped items and got banned for it? Seriously?
---
It's ESPECIALLY needed in this game where carry weight and stash weight are made such a big pain in the ass to manage. There really needed to be some QoL improvements on the weight management front that sadly will probably never happen. 
---
Our replies crossed, but yeah, cool stuff about the wood, didn't know that. It could potentially effect pvp, because you can do sneak damage to players you are engaged with in combat. I'm guessing the game uses at least somewhat similar indicators to determine sneak damage as in pve, so being harder to detect might help in increasing the chance you do sneak damage, but this is pure speculation
---
Nice one! 
---
Have you tried the eastern pennetentiary north of starting area? Loot the tin can traps in cell block A (steel + led) and kill all enemies (super mutants or scorched spawns there). Rinse and repeat.
---
They should do it like ARK. If you go too far over weight you can't move. It would be annoying but it would be a fix.
---
Ill give u 10 stimpacks and 10 purified water 
---
Except your arent invincible and just drop dead as soon as the load ends. 
---
It's now infuriating to try to sell something for less than 500 I mean 25,000 caps.
---
I've asked a few people so far where they got their explo shotgun from, iIrc there wasnt 1 who found one being under lvl 100. But I only asked like 10-15 people 
---
They seem to be extremly rare!(What makes the whole duping story even worse :/)
---
Hope your first explosive is the one you want, or at least one thats usefull! Patience :) 
---
My brother lost all his caps for defending himself
---
Some high traffic areas I found in my adventures as a trader would include:
---
Between vault 76 and Flatwoods for brand new players.
---
Near Morgantown for low level players. Somewhere between Morgantown and Grafton.
---
Dried up lake south of Vault 76 gets a fair amount of passerbys. More mid level players looking to get to the scorched area.
---
Whitesprings always has players but is highly likely to get nuked. The players can be of any level but are almost always busy grinding or going to the vendors. If you aren't part of the enclave then the one person who is *always* there is inaccesible.
---
The key thing to look for is accessibility. Make sure it's easy to stumble upon your camp. 
---
wait people still actually play this game? lol
---
I wasn‚Äôt selling them. I was a middle-man. I never touched them. 
---
I know right, he's not sure how it happened, and I hope its just a glitch
---
I like that everyone on the team is marked for PvP.
---
This one time, I got chased and killed by a guy. Okay, he was chasing me because I stole a bunch of legendaries he left on a paper bag at his Camp, but hey, if it's on the ground, it's fair game!
---
So, knowing that he had another two guys with him chasing me too, I seeked revenge. I run a Stealth Guerrilla build, so I killed the three of them in just a few seconds, took their junk, and put it in my stash on a train station nearby.
---
It's all about that sweet revenge.
---
I would if I was on PC but I'm on xbox. My condolences to you and your family. Max is up in heaven chasing mice and eating treats now
---
Very annoying for sure.
---
Power armor is bad for pvp in general 
---
So yeah, theoretically I was ‚Äúselling‚Äù them. My account shouldn‚Äôt have any red flags. 
---
lmao
---
Can‚Äôt get rid of them and the quest never makes itself complete, probably will be used with new content updates. 
---
You must or why would be on this sub. Lol. 
---
If you come across a new way, let us all know!
---
So you put people in touch with a duper to purchase duped items?
---
Whenever I fast travel to Charleston station my game does that same thing. Smh
---
Well from what I heard only a couple boblehead stack with itself so it really doesn't seem to be by "design"
---
Big fan of this post. I wanted to get it just for the completionist in me but the 20 minute videos telling me how cool the poster is and how hard it is were annoying. 
---
Wasn't duping patched with the latest patch? If so,then we just need to wait till they're out of them.
---
No worries mate love sharing stories with this community very satisfying 
---
With a Geiger counter in my hand I'm a goin out to stake me some government land
---
Uranium fever has done and got me down. 
---
Yes. I got 250 caps for every trade. 
---
It would just be a matter of time before dupe free servers ended up with dupers and duped items.
---
I mean unless they truly get rid of the ability to dupe and then wipe all servers and force everyone to restart theres not really a way to keep a server dupe free. 
---
And they wont do it because it would just make everyone po'd
---
The Wanderer - Fallout 4   
---
TY OP!!!
---
I have it set up next to the junk yard east of the Lighthouse at the moment. It‚Äôs a popular spot for power armor building.
---
I might have agreed with yoiu, but then you lost me with the words "gun control".
---
I stumbled on to that cave as well and skipped a lot of steps (I was in the middle of Roses quests at the time). Turned out it really didn‚Äôt matter, and I was able to level up enough to get the highest Black Diamond ski sword there is so that was good.
---
Great. I was tired of getting wrecked in pvp before I could even see the people shooting me.
---
I think that looks wonderful. My condolences. I am sure your kitty will be there in spirit.
---
The super mutants were all at or above my level, even though I'm over-levelled for the area (I'm 51)
---
One of my favorite in-game moments was standing on a cliff edge admiring the view, and got surprised by a glowing mole rat. It charges, jumps and attacks me, then falls down right off the cliff edge to its death, smacking a few times on the way down.
---
P.S. I guess you can place campfires on your roof and crops can then be placed in them. I haven't tried it but have heard that a bunch of times.
---
It's horribly unbalanced. Their is no parity for someone that plays solo. You basically become the bitch that has to do whatever your told.
---
On Xbox, but it seems to be crashing a bit more than regular for me. May have to wait for the post patch hotfix to play.
---
Pretty sure I'm disputing it, so not sure how it's indisputable since we are both working with anecdotal evidence, but go ahead and keep calling me a duper.
---
There are quite a few self admitted dupers in this thread, better go whoop whoop on their asses.
---
Once there's been more balancing I would love to try out a hard-core dayz like server. With no blips on the map and everyone does full damage ect.
---
Ha 3.5", try 5.25" for advanced dungeons and dragons pool of radiance
---
What is the ridiculous part is the duper wasn‚Äôt banned. That‚Äôs partly why I‚Äôm most upset about this. 
---
Yep, as soon as you place it your Brahmin will spawn
---
20 toys üß∏?
---
100% rad free ?
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ "dupe free servers" omfg I can't stop laughing
---
You have my condolances.
---
So sorry to hear, sending all the positive vibes your way. 
---
- Fellow Kitty enthusiast.
---
Same thing brah bye
---
Again: there's a pirates hat?!?
---
im doing this today.
---
Going to get a shitload of toys and goto a nuke zone naked see what happens :).
---
I have a 2 star legendary hatchet that ignores 50% of targets armor and does 40% more damage on a power swing (I think I remembered those numbers correctly) and it is almost as good as my Instigating Grognak Axe. 
---
Now I am looking for outfits so I can role-play as a Nord from Skyrim who got sent to West Virginia by a Daedra as a joke.
---
I really almost don‚Äôt care for it. Doesn‚Äôt fit my play style at all
---
Whitespring has always 2 spawning no miss 
---
One corpse along the way between Morgantown and vault 76
---
Just did sbq. All good,i'm solo but the only others on site are high level like me. Crashed.
---
YES I BOUGHT IT AND IT'S AMAZING
---
There's no locked order to the quests.  There's an easy lead-in for each one if followed in a sequence, but it's not a lock nor does it ruin any of the stories.
---
I actually did the Enclave Bunker intro before I even finished the Responder and Raider quests.
---
Unique sure but unlike most other companies they didn‚Äôt seem to be out to get rich no matter the moral cost.
---
I just got it today and lock that mut lol
---
Furious rolling pin...
---
Why do you like 76?
---
Yes
---
Lol *cough* feeling sick and need to go home from work *cough*
---
&gt; Beta Players remember how friendly and welcoming everyone was at the start. Something somewhere has gone dark, and I feel bad when I read stories like the trap above.
---
Pretty sure this sensation is felt by all founding/early players of all online games ever
---
And lose my deep pockets?! Never!
---
I'm afraid it's gone forever. A moment of silence for your dearly departed Grognak...
---
I got on tonight and I feel really disappointed in this update. Building just feels clunkier, my frames (on console) would randomly drop.
---
I'm glad that this update made this game more enjoyable for most, but I personally feel that my experience has moved sideways. Some things are fixed, but more things seem to be messed up.
---
I think you've hit an important point, which is that it's important to build off the beaten path enough that you wont have other players dragging enemies to your camp.
---
Basically no where will be 100% free of spawns, but some places are better than others I've found.
---
It sucks big time. Aside from sharing radsponge, you're not needed.
---
 Nobody needs to be slightly healed when you use a stimpack, or hunger satisfied a bit when you eat, or health Regen for a few seconds on the off chance they are knocked down and you're the one who rezzed them. Etc etc
---
You're absolutely correct. Since the initial post I have  tested both shotgun and automatic barrels. I'm impressed with the damage of both, not because its overwhelming, but because of what you get from it using cheap ammunition. The 15 round automatic's capacity is a disappointment, but I'll be on the lookout for a Quad/Explosive variant in the meantime. It's just a shame that because of the explosive modifier it stops performing like the weapon it is.
---
I really don't get this whole family online thing I mean the closest thing I had to this was 5 years ago I played bf3 with my dad and brother 
---
Way back home - Bob Crosby &amp; the Bob cats from the galaxy news radio :) next to that would be the enclave radio speeches and quotes from John Henry Eden. He always got me amped on my adventures. + fallout 3 was the first one I played and I fell in love with it almost instantly.
---
Fuck man you want them to live a reason for every single little change?  Why can't you just be stoked for any changes at all? Who cares why they make little adjustments here and there? Some reasons are glaring and obvious and some are probably for subtle balance reasons. 
---
Basically I'm saying just chill. People are never happy. We ask for communication and there is now, there is change happening, at a more rapid pace and I think people generally need to chill out about this game. What other game are you so ravenously angry about getting explanations on every little patch note and change. What developer even does that? How much more detailed can they really get? If you want specific information about a change ask around about that specific thing. 
---
The metal support beams do clip through terrain
---
I always have two rifles. A scoped high damage long range lever action and a reflex sighted closer quarters handmade with a drum mag.
---
Rank 5 adrenaline dramatically increases your damage output as you clear interiors and small mobs. Glow sight and tank killer are also very helpful.
---
Well it also effects quest rewards/event rewards. No I'm not needed but I wanna make one for shits and giggles
---
Same here 
---
Lol, I know some stuff :p
---
Underarmor is clothes, you wear it under your armor (e.g. chest, arms, leg pieces)
---
You (or someone for you) upgrade under at a armor bench with different linings
---
Treated
---
Resistant
---
Protective 
---
Shielded
---
Once you get an under armor upgrade, it‚Äôll grant bonus stats, like damage resist and +special stats
---
THE HOLY WEAPON
---
There‚Äôs one that pops up around the Capital building in Charleston ..near the apartments ..usually a level 10...he really hates that apartment building ..or he‚Äôs trying to fix it up with tar ...
---
What‚Äôs the max damage for the lever?
---
White Knight doesn't work for Power Armor 
---
I see those comments SO MUCH. "Downvoters must be dupers! Why do people on this sub downvote so much!"
---
It brings out the smartass in me.
---
Haha what are you doing subscribed to this sub?
---
Don't worry it's not time limited! 
---
Maybe you could tame a similar looking cat too, I've been trying to do that.
---
So your PSA is about what kinda 1shot? Or am I tripping up? Cause to reach 400k you would take at least 100s of the buff glitched. And yet u just claimed it's slap dmg now
---
Thank you! I'll look closer next time :)
---
If I recall, they do not.
---
You really think not mentioning going for supply drops now results in a wanted tag isn't worth mentioning?
---
They promised better communication and more detailed changes. I don't expect game balancing explanation for FOV changes or whitespring robot spawn rates, but there is a lot they're silent on when it comes to patch notes.
---
Underarmor are clothing that goes under armor and outfits that can be worn with them. There are six categories of underarmor: BoS, Casual, Enclave, Marine, Raider, and Vault Suits, and they can have different linings applied that boost ER/DR/RR and SPECIAL stats (in order of the benefits they provide): Treated, Resistant, Protective, and Shielded. Here's a link with more info.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/
---
None of them work with Power Armor and some (all but the Vault 76 Jumpsuit) cause the DR/ER of PA to be lowered. Here's a link discussing the problem in more detail.
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2omnz/psa_using_a_power_armor_dont_use_underarmor/
---
Personally, I think underarmor should work with both regular armor and power armor, but that's not how FO76 works. It only works with regular armor.
---
no
---
People will go so far to defend laziness. Such comradarie is hard to come by
---
Also any particular armor, I‚Äôm running Marine Armor with Deep Pocket at the moment (needed mats).  Have padded Marine Chest
---
might just be magazines that are intended then cause i seen it last night and was like wtf but what are the chances you find the same issue im like 200hrs in and never use them and maybe got 3 doubles

I said this long ago:
---
They effectively put themselves in a loop of "OMG we have to fix this now before we hemorrhage yet more money" ... "Ok we fixed what they were complaining about QUICK CAPITALIZE ON THAT SMALL AMOUNT OF HAPPINESS WITH THE ATOM SHOP" ... "Fuck!!!! Ok stop everything we have to fix (insert here now)...
---
Everything else went out the window. They are and have been in crisis mode and will be for quite some time to come...
---
Yeah just tried it a few times and im pretty sure that's what is causing it. Just wish there was a way to fix it without relogging.
---
People are that bored 
---
 If you have not actually achieved civilization, then the need for deadly force in your cities might be understandable.
---
People are constantly posting on here about being mad about camps near Whitesprings. Something about people putting up Whitesprings camps with turrets in order to farm ghouls for legendary drops. So they go out of their way to destroy camps in that area.
---
Dang. Was hoping for a way to find bodies after they roll down a hill or get lost in tall grass.
---
Ive had this problem as well. Tried "walling it in" with shelves and placing a small stash bot under the bottom part. No avail. Thought it would add a unique look to my workshop, but not in this state. Hoping for a fix.
---
Mine is almost like yours! The load screen ends and I can see my character on a terribly loaded place for 1 or 2 seconds and then it goes to a second load screen.
---
I had no idea it was thanks to the update tho, as I had upgraded my PC in the same day. I thought it was because of the new hardware.
---
I got killed/almost killed many times before because I had super long loading times (1m35s on a load screen), so I guess it just depends on how much time you stand there doing nothing.
---
Huh. That's rad. The one in game doesn't protect you from rads ( guessing because it's ripped ) and it gives you -2 perception. 
---
I don‚Äôt mind the small stash size. I think it forces you to craft and ration and think ahead to what you need. Honestly, it‚Äôs been kind of freeing in a way. I‚Äôm not constantly running back to my camp or a stash box every time I clear an area. Also, irl, you wouldn‚Äôt really have an infinite magic box to pull items from. Again, I play more of a roleplay style. So it works for me.
---
Granted, I‚Äôve crafted much of what I need now. Purifier, generator,etc.. so everything else except rarer junk, I bulk up and sell off to a vendor when I‚Äôm near one.
---
It‚Äôs freed up my stash to hold unique weapons or interesting outfits. I can store more meds and food and water. It lets me stay out in the world longer and I‚Äôm not constantly worried about scrounging things, except for the handful of items I have tagged for components. So I get more time to enjoy exploring and role playing in the world.
---
This is a topic that I've been hanging on since I took up the raider mantle. The line between raider and griefer is razor thin. Here are some raider tenants I've talked to my group about so we don't slip into full on griefer territory. 
---
1.) Don't follow servers: I consider a server hop a win. We often do patrols of the divide. If we destroy a base and someone hops servers the fight is over. 
---
2.) Don't follow a camp relocation. Same premise as above. Granted people not looking for a fight should block before moving. 
---
3.) Trash talking is fine, but hate speech is a not cool. This should be common sense. Not really a problem with the guys I play with but I've heard stories.
---
4.) Don't clear your bounty unless the game glitches and you can't fast travel. Having the bounty should be a badge of honor. 
---
5.) No bobblehead, or other game breaking, exploits. Since you can't really rob people the focus is on some fun pvp action. It's easy enough to one shot people as it is.
---
I have had a lot of fun pvp encounters and most of them start with raiding a camp, racking that bounty, and hunkering down somewhere. It's great when an equally fitted gang shows up to claim the bounty/defend the workshop/avenge their friends base. 
---
Any other raiders want to chime in. 
---
https://discord.gg/mUqHrrm
---
Same, i have many mods installed and hundreds of hours. I couldn't play without them at this point. Saved perk loadouts and better inventory change the game in dramatically better ways. 
---
We were actually griefing people and their workshops. My friend would loot all their stuff and then drop it all in a bush as fast as he could before they came back so they couldn't find it. On one of the dumps it forced him out of his armor and that's when there was two sets of it.
---
I can't even really tell if they're in crisis mode or still so wholly incompetent that they can't do basic bug fixes for this product.
---
Surely the BoS has hoarded some sort of tech that can CHECK the SPELLing of their missives.
---
If you're on PC, I have spares of both of these. Never bought them, so I guess they're common world drops.
---
Who knows lol. Dev don't it seems :'D
---
*presses F*
---
Head over to the county fair - get your toys for free
---
With that do they follow you everywhere? Or can you command them to stay put?
---
I really like Country Roads and 16 Tons, but I feel like the one that sticks in my head the most is the Congo one (forget what it‚Äôs called, bingo bango bongo I‚Äôm so happy in the jungle I don‚Äôt want to go)
---
So lining is the upgrade for an armor? 
---
Explosives were my go to when I was running my 15 charisma build. A flamer cryolator build seems like it could be fun. 
---
i was just think it would be obscene cause there  is a magazine that increases explosive AoE
---
Oh! So underarmor is the base, and lining is what makes it better!
---
I didn't know that. Thanks for the info. üëç
---
I'm pretty sure I picked them up for copper in fo4.
---
One thing I find most aggravating about it is the imbalance in payout vs loss. 
---
I was on a team of 3 (including myself). Some jerks attacked one of us and I took to their defense. Got something like 40 caps for killing a lvl 100+ player. Killed player seeks revenge. One shots me with a TSE and I lose nearly 200 caps. 
---
Plans and outfits are rare. It's obnoxious, but go ahead and keep grinding. If you have a friend who doesn't have that quest they can carry big stacks and hand them to you one at a time. That's been a decent percentage of my pulled from the rng table. I've dropped hundreds of 2mm and 40mm rounds, never mind all the water and stimpaks.
---
Whoa whoa whoa before you cause a riot over possible made up bullshit do you actually have any *proof* of the above changes minus the changes to Supply Drops? Too many people keep making up "changes" that never actually happened, so I'm being very wary of posts like these.
---
Does left trigger wrap also?
---
Still doing my bit. Dropped some plans I didn't need at the overseers camp tonight for a level 3. Might have been somebody's new character instead of a brand new player because they used the emotes way too well.
---
Either way I'm glad they went to a new home and regularly drop off 5 stims, radaway, food and water for new arrivals.
---
I pretty much block anybody I see with more than one TSE weapon
---
Butcher Pete choppin‚Äô up all the womens‚Äô meat
---
Probably just a lack of communication between teams. 
---
Lol &gt;.&gt;
---
That's what I was told was the problem when they published their first patch notes.  Well, looks like lack of communication is a popular theme at Bethesda, almost SOP at this point.
---
I move CAMP a lot and anecdotally, concrete foundations do seem to be an improvement.
---
So a team based 15 cha character for your own benefit?
---
Go ahead and make one, but I wish I just spent a bit more time looking at the perks before I invested so much time building my character. The team perks are terrible.
---
Totally, figured others might be interested in the logic as well.
---
Does not forgeting even helps? I always remember that because that explosion one shots me, but it doesn't matter how much time I wait, the robot never explodes unless I get close. I've tried shooting it, I've tried getting close while crouching. Nope, they always explode on my face. It's always "ignore the legendary item or die" for me.
---
Edit: Also, yesterday I saw a guy dying thanks to this explosion, I went to check his paper bag just out of curiosity, see what other players usually carry. When he came back he followed me for a while, I wonder if he thought I got something from his bag (I didn't).
---
Both bored and this. 
---
It was just individual server maintenance. The world you were on was being shut down. It even glitches when you go to the main menu and continues to count but you are able to join another world. 
---
Can power armor paint ever really be TOO gay?
---
Uranium Fever
---
I had this happen yesterday in Whitespring. A pack of ghouls would spawn, but as soon as I would get close they would all drop dead simultaneously. There were no players or robots around. 
---
Marine wetsuit and sackhold with straps is a good start
---
Eh, what can you do right? I'm thinking of using a cryolater or flamer with 2 shot
---
Relogging usually fixes this.
---
I saw a simple anti-duper solution I liked on here. Simply prevent legendaries before the patch from being sold/traded/dropped. 
---
What‚Äôs nice is there‚Äôs already code in place to do so. Any weapon/armor with an Atom Shop paintjob already has these restrictions.
---
&gt;Bethesda should outline what is acceptable
---
TELL ME HOW TO PLAY THIS OPEN WORLD GAME. Here's a hint, if you can do it then it's acceptable.
---
You get your 1 mascot mask and that is all. 
---
In all fairness it was an amazing drama fest for a while.
---
Pretty sure I saw all those changed mentioned in the patch notes other than the Gov Drops.
---
Also getting defense about potential downvotes isnt a good look.
---
Correct, all linings are under armor upgrades
---
If you learn a lining, you need to find the underarmor in the world before you can apply said lining
---
If you find the underarmor plan &amp; the linings, you‚Äôre winning
---
Anything shielded is generally **extremely** difficult to come by
---
Treated and resistant are generally found on vendors
---
Now that they claim the duping is fixed, introduce explosive ammunition, require expensive materials that didn't exist before the dupe fix, and make it a requirement for the TSE guns.
---
Got close to 7000. I bought the parquet and succulent( what scrub didn't) and use ultracite PA and only in nuke zones ,so a paint would be totally useless. I'm saving for weapon skins( that i use dammit!) or must have camp stuff....and i might buy the sniper outfit.
---
So the claim that these shielded plans can be purchased at vendors seems very unlikely.  The R&amp;G station is the raider station I hit every day on my vendor caps run along with Watoga and Phoenix, I always check not only the Notes section but every other section just in case the travelers leather coat happens to pop up etc...etc
---
For the S and Giggles of it I did hop the RG station for about an hour last night, no shielded plan, also very little there for my Lvl 170 toon that was new.
---
Also the Lvl 15 toon I have parked at Watoga hits both vendors there regularly and I made sure to get him the 1st 2 casual and 3 raider plans learned just in case...no dice.  On a side note it seems like in addition to the handmade plans being Lvl restricted the Cultist Dagger, Blade, and Ski sword recipes are acquirable there for lower lvl toons, The only plan I ever see on my high lvl toon is the stadium Rifle plan 
---
So can you please explain what the serum does?
---
Sorry to hear. Would place a wax candle in remembrance of your cat.
---
Yup. Many entertaining poops.
---
That is what happnend
---
Huh, I never found the space suit in game. I‚Äôm talking about hazmats
---
I've got an extra Nuka machine if you're on Xbone.
---
Huh. Could have sworn I noticed a difference but maybe I was fooling myself. Thanks for correcting me!
---
Yes. Yes it is. It also effects setting prices for Player to Player trading. 
---
The garbage one at the dmv
---
Hopefully the duping is gone! Considering part of the glitch was crashing the server intentionally, I hope they get banned for ruining other players experience. Pure selfishness.
---
Taking the serum instantly grants you the mutation (make sure to take off starched genes perk card). If you already have the mutation, the serum will suppress the negative effects for an hour. 
---
Heyyy thats how I use reddit too!
---
It‚Äôs yours! I got one. Thank you so much though!
---
Here's the thing, I personally thought about Raider RP when I first started.  I would actually engage in a play-along scenario with a Raider if they did any of the following:
---
* 1) They actually approached me and in Chat or the Text Chat Mod did something in-character, like charge a toll, demand a tax, or something that allows for an interactive response back.  Allow the other player to participate and be PART of what is going on.
---
* 2) Be greedy but not TOO greedy.  Go ahead and demand something, caps, ammo, mats, but don't be a dick and demand my Legendary gear as part of the RP.  There's being a Raider character and then there's just being a Douche Player.
---
* 3) Understood that everything doesn't have to end in violence or death.  If you got something out of an exchange or interaction, it was a good day.  Maybe I made you laugh.  Maybe you take a captive and roleplay menacing peril for awhile.  Maybe you're like the Dread Pirate Roberts and need a valet.  Just remember that players that come back are also a form of renewing resources.  
---
I usually criticize Raiders who whine on this Reddit because they claim to be roleplaying, but usually are just trying to cover up douchey behavior and griefing through the mask of RP.  But there are a few legitimate Raider players who understand that there's more to the Raider 'story' than just being a troll and a jerk.  The holotapes and Rose's personal storyline pretty spells out, they have human needs and desires too, and that's part of what is missing when people just go to the extreme you were talking about earlier.  I hope more follow you in trying to create a balanced approach.
---
This was a super great build!
---
My parents, my two sisters, my brother, my uncle, and my boyfriend play together. I like to watch and listen to them. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ
---
The same here, xbox one 
---
Nice try Bethesda fanboy. The other 3 points I mentioned are within their patch notes. Read the original post again if you didn't understand because you were too busy praising lord Todd.
---
Let me know if you need any supplies dropped off and I'll bring you what you need. Also as a side note, I'm officially on the hunt for the neon letters for you. :) The world needs more people like you in it &lt;3
---
EDIT: Spellcheck 
---
The locked supply crates are not new. If another player calls in the drop you get a bounty for trying to steal it.
---
Lower fusion core spawn rate was in the last patch, and included in the patch notes. 
---
All the crafting changes were well spelled out in this weeks patch notes. 
---
Tell him that one condition is he has to stop saying "bruh"
---
Edit: and "lit"
---
 Does that helm do anything? I've been making and selling them. That works. ;)
---
That helps for sure. Also, use the metal mesh floors for outside decking. Turrets can shoot through them at stuff underneath.
---
That's beautiful, friend. I'm sorry for your loss.
---
&gt;la
---
Read the post again. I know reading all the notes and holotapes takes extreme skill but you can do better than this surely.
---
mmm I moved my camp more than one time. I scrapped all the items and the blueprints too. always 30% stored. Dk really.
---
Shit. I saw people talking about that. Sorry about that 
---
You are too kind. I have been looking. The small letter set is usually easy to find, but even on my regular account my 125 character hasn‚Äôt found them yet.
---
Be safe.
---
I dunno about you but I'd run around in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with Yoga balls strapped to me. Any Super Mutant that runs at me will bounce off and pull a hammy
---
Mine too, im on xbox one. No CTDs it just disconnects...
---
I truly believe it's both incompetence and crisis mode. The combination is the only thing that can really explain what we witnessed.
---
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!
---
Hmm, pretty cool for a cat :P
---
Grants you a mutation you lost or marsupial?
---
Kill it and cook it‚Äôs meat. Black cats give extra bonuses. 
---
Doing this for a friend. Always wanted to play with him and want to surprise him.
---
Mr Five by Five
---
My first one after the servers were back online must have been bugged. She died quick with only a couple people down there. Didn‚Äôt have any stars either.  Significantly less cannon fodder as well. 
---
The other 3 times seemed much more normal. 
---
It was raining scorchbeasts for me today. Happened twice once when I was crossing the railroad bridge near the Charleston train station and a little while later near the overseer's cache. 
---
I don't know about yoga balls but Confucious say "Man in baseball wrong, man with four balls cannot walk."  Make of that what you will :-)
---
Atom Shop's Vampire Outfit might work well?
---
Or maybe the Civil War Suit?  You can find those ingame.
---
I‚Äôm 99% sure it‚Äôs ALL damage done WHILE you are attacking. Because of how much i see it dropping while hitting the queen; I know I ain‚Äôt doing all that damage.
---
Ran into one along the railroad tracks just south of Sutton last weekend.
---
All of you play on pc? 
---
Lots of people say this and I've for sure had situations where they did totally ignore attackers, but in general they seem to work ok. I think it's way more about where your camp is placed than whether the turrets suck or not.
---
Anyone know where I can find the Antique lights?
---
I'm wearing the Surveyor Outfit. Looks ok.
---
Wait what happened? 
---
I think so. I feel like I have gotten my money's worth. 
---
Here are the questions I have asked friends who have mentioned they might get the game but aren't sure...
---
Did you play Fallout 4? 
---
If yes, then when you finished the main story, did you keep playing, building settlements, searching for crafting components, hunting for cool weapons? If so, you will probably love this game.
---
If you felt the Fallout 4 was over when the main story completed, then you probably won't be into this game.
---
If you haven't played Fallout 4, I would suggest giving it a go and see how you like it.
---
Have you tried storing them and replacing them or server hopping to see if it's just a lag problem?
---
That can happen when your workbench hasn't finished loading or you build your bench in a tight space. Try again later or restart your game.
---
I wholeheartedly endorse such a notion. A gentleman must always look respectable and avoid distracting decadence when engaged in a civil dispute.
---
I've met that dude before but he had friends that took it way too serious. One blew himself up just to get me.
---
Randomly around the world or a guaranteed sighting after you complete the event to turn on the lighthouse near vault 76.
---
Rip Max.
---
I‚Äôve been calling them Dr Ghouls
---
If I had deep pocketed plans I would T_T
---
Me as well. My buddy got all bent out of shape because I finished Death From Above without ever doing the DMV quest. He asserted I was cheating... Heh, eff the DMV.
---
The problem is these coats aren't worth anything anymore so everyone is trolling you 
---
[deleted]
---
Sorry to hear bub I lost my little frida last month after 8 years. After I dropped her off at the vets to be cremated I sat down and played until I was no longer sad. I hope this game finds you peace like it did for me
---
Locked supply crates are new.
---
The rest of the adjustments include no notations towards game balance. That's what the issue is.
---
You'd think a bunch of diehard Bethesda fanboys who have parroted the importance of reading holotapes and notes to understand the FO76 world would at least know how to properly digest the patch notes and my post indicating my issue with the patch notes.
---
You claimed they made many changes without telling us, yet listed only one.
---
As for the why certain changes were made, everyone of them is pretty obvious. If you can grasp basic balancing without having your hand held, that's on you.
---
You are a paragon of virtue and humility, sir. Thank you so much for making that point on the interwebz for all to see. 
---
We are, truly, peasants in your humble shadow.
---
It was part of the patch. They lowered spawn rate to hopefully slow down the dupers that were farming that area non stop
---
Stupid question but is server hopping just quiting to main menu the loading back in?
---
Grants you the mutation of the serum. Each mutation has its own serum. So marsupial serum grants you marsupial mutation, healing factor serum grants you healing factor, etc. 
---
No, the supply crates ARE new. I haven‚Äôt called any supply crates since launch, but I‚Äôve looted plenty. They were instanced loot so it didn‚Äôt hurt, everyone got loot from them.
---
Death is that you? Stop playing games and get back to work!!!
---
About 10 times today yes.
---
If you want a picture *with* the mothman you can do the event Path to Enlightenment. It's at the lighthouse. After you complete it a non hostile mothman appears that you can "talk" to and he gives  you 5% bonus exp for a hour.
---
&gt; he was outside of the fight kill zone 
---
Yup, most of the time he was. I actually said he was sniping, which means shooting from a far range.
---
&gt; excavator is the worst for combat by design 
---
That's exactly my point. Despite it being by far the weakest PA, he still managed to be the star in a 6 men 30 minute team fight. This is response to 'don't use PA at all in pvp'
---
Oh look, it's this post again
---
I've been seeing locked crates since beta. Yes there are general crates which anyone can take but if I go to a tower and call my own supply, it is locked for everyone else. Not new. 
---
It's cool, if you want that marsupial serum add me bud. If not enjoy the game, remember life's a garden.. Dig it. 
---
Ps4 here, load ins at golf course slower and multiple disconnects
---
It's quite amazing.
---
Also.
---
The gauss rifle now falls under semi auto rifle jurisdiction 
---
And I will gladly trade you items from my other account in payment for helping me find the neon lights.
---
I played briefly in whitesprings and my experience was the opposite... While it wasnt nuke, the ghouls were spawning non stop to a point where i couldn't retrieve a paper bag inside the golf course building. Id kill them and seconds later another wave would hit me... Im on xbox btw.
---
Not sure about being locked, but I found one today that was empty. I guess they don't keep the stuff that was in Them for everyone else now?
---
Yes or going to Social from your map and hitting leave world. 
---
You still haven't done your due reading of holotapes and notes.
---
"accurate, comprehensive notes" indicates we would be told about the reasoning for game balance changes.
---
Keep studying the lore because you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
RIP Max. May you have all the yarn balls and fish. 
---
Probably wouldn't go bad with the Civil War Era Suit (what doesn't match with it?) or the Black Fisherman's Overalls (Atom Shop item)
---
There is a event that triggers sometime by the lighthouse in the forest. If you complete it "Wise Mothman" shows up and gives you effect. I forget what it does, but it was positive. 
---
While saying that got disconnected before even fully loading in at golf course, makes 11 or 12 in the last few hours.  These are disconnects to dashboard btw.
---
Okay can I dupe then? Hey, if I won't banned, I want people to find my corpse with a half mil on it.
---
Locked supply crates are from nuclear launch codes, not from other players doing a supply drop.
---
That is new.
---
Speed Demon reduces the effictiveness of all chems by 50-60% (or something like that). If you have max level class freak it's a negligible effect. That said, there may be a bug between the interaction with the new update. I don't know, I just got home from work and haven't updated the game yet.
---
Aww so good to hear order does not matter! As I said before we basically go with the flow so this is good news.
---
Found 17 frags on a supermutant once. Was like wtf
---
That's what I mean. Find a place that spawns like, lvl 5 super mutants.
---
Oh, yeah. :) 
---
All time favorite "Into each life some rain must fall" by Ella Fitzgerald 
---
I have speed demon and also see this issue. I slowly lose health over time near the end of a stim's duration
---
You know what's going to get you downvoted? The last sentence in your original post and the first in the one I'm replying to. If you want constructive discourse I suggest you remove both of those.
---

---
Same thing that happened to people's new years resolution.  It was an unrealistic goal from the start.
---
Is Anthem better at this point...looked promising but I havent kept up with it.
---
Whah.
---
Not saying it doesn't happen with default sort, just that it seems to happen more with other sorts.
---
It's gotten much worse with this patch. I've crashed 3 times in the first 30 minutes of running around Watoga on my PS4 Pro, and I've seen a post or two from others Reporting similar at the Whitespring. Wonder if it has something to do with protectrons?
---
Omfg u/befowler you should make a Fallout 76 bashing click bait video about it! 
---
So it did this to me but after the second load screen it did a pop pop and I could move around, my HUD was still there but everything else was all black. Had to close the application just to get it normal again. ü§î
---
DC after DC here lol.  Are u on ps4 pro perhaps, ps4 classic here.
---
Ok cool ill try that.  It started happening after i placed a tinker workstation near it i may need to move that. 
---
Yeahhhhh, but when you find that one sweet spot....you never leave. I‚Äôve had my camp in the same spot since Reclamation Day, I‚Äôll never move. On the extremely rare  (1-2 times ever since the update) time that I‚Äôve spawned in and my camp was taken, I just leave the server...gotta commit 
---
Holy shit this is amazing... Thank you so much for doing this! Gonna bookmark that for sure!
---
yea this guy was a melee build, he dropped me an extra sledge afterwards
---
Did you wait a minute to see if maybe the loot was slow to spawn in perhaps?
---
No, it will give you 100 rad resist
---
This happened to me when I fast traveled to Fred's BBQ shack. I thought I was being attacked haha
---
FO4 had way better looking free mods lol.
---
What gives.
---
Never knew that, thank you!
---
I'll upvote to that 
---
A leveled up Hunting Rifle got me through 40 levels....
---
Ohhh freaking awesome. Thank you. 
---
Thanks thats what it was.  It started after i built a tinker bench near it.  
---
Same here on PS4 game seemed stable 12 mins after patch so we decided to nuke whitesprings. 6 bluescreen crashes later we hopped servers and tried again thinking we just have had a rotten server.  Dropped another nuke. Same result. Five blue screen crashes and I quit for the day. Will log on tomorrow morning. 
---
r/fo76creations is also a great community if you are looking for even more content. 
---
Loved Rose's questline. And downvote if you want I did use the Raider Rp excuse once, but I realized that  I wasn't actually rping, I was just attacking a settlement and trying to capture it under bounty. Some dude who was higher leveled held it, but I got the upper hand, thus his message, thus my excuse. Never fucked a base like that since.
---
I really care about my karma.
---
"constructive discourse" when people come into this thread and completely lie about changes to the game?
---
thanks man
---
5000?? That is not worth it honestly.. 
---
Happened to me too on xbox... I couldn't move the character or the camera, no pipboy but i had access to the map. Very annoying, for sure...
---
So it‚Äôs a side hustle for you? Which ones do you have for sale? 
---
it would literally just be a flag on a character that would only match them with characters with the flag. 
---
They're also delicious.
---
Right? I don't even care that they charge for *palette swaps*, but even with in-game atoms, I'm absolutely bewildered how they justify these prices.
---
Farming Phoenix? What do you mean?
---
First post woot!
---
This more than anything. I didn't even know you could do this until I went to a PA station to fix my Raider PA *after* I died trying to build the excavator armor at the main office. Felt like an idiot when I realized you could build it anywhere!
---
Lol reported for lying? I've been using supply crates as traps for over a month. Try not to take a game so serious bud. Guess I'll stop arguing since your way too into it. 
---
ouch :(  sorry to hear.  I've had a couple disconnects in the last hour too :(  
---
Not sure if the karma comment was sarcastic. But if you cared about it you wouldn't be as antagonistic and defensive as you have been in your replies in this topic.
---
Hunters wooden leg over thisaway. 
---
Then mods should add it to the Beth Plz checklist. 
---
I was having that problem last night, about everything I was putting down for my camp was lagging and when I went to work on my PA it was just the animation. I was thinking possibly dupers doing their shit

I guess im gonna have to suffer a little. I should increase my mic usage, and constantly hold a small bounty. Wonder what would happen if I went into someones camp while they were there and started "remodeling" "my" camp.
---
I have four 2* firearms and two of them came from non legendary entities. A two-shot plasma Gatling with enhanced ADS damage came from a gangrenous feral at Whitesprings, and a high-speed shredding minigun (don't remember the buffs) I got from a cave deathclaw.  My saving grace has been that I know a guy who runs a knife-only build and I get really good bladed weapons (furious with extra limb damage, etc.) while he gets pretty good firearms.
---
Could be, clipping is sometimes an issue in this game. I would try that as well.

My experience...

I upvoted.  You sound more than invested into the *idea* of playing a Raider, and that shows.  Like I said, I just want people to put some fucking thought into their role, yanno?   :-)

Lol - still haven't got to play yet.  I have some crappy wifi and the DL took forever.  Ready now though

While playing no, while it does reduce breaks most people saying they never repair dont run that, and 3 points I'm intelligence isnt an option when I have to run gunsmith and demolition for my build.

I bet the dev's are having a good chuckle about it
---
TBH I‚Äôm sick of seeing these posts about irrelevant game features. Is this a good idea and do I want a pet? Absolutely I do. But know what I think is fucking way more important than that? Having the game not crash 11times on different servers just hours after a patch that supposedly increased server stability. Let‚Äôs all stop these BS posts and just spam Bethesda with stability issues.

I have adrenal reaction, bird bones, carnivore, eagle eyes, empath, healing factor, marsupial, talons, and unstable isotope for now. Always looking to add more recipes.

I do a lot of buying and selling on the side. It‚Äôs something fun to do in the end game.

Server hopping to change the vendors loot
---
Twin Lakes area is infested with Radstag
---
Did you see the redacted info on the patch notes? Bethesda doesn't even know what Bethesda has done ;)
---
I'll give this a shot next time. Thanks

Yes, im having these too. Also sometimes when i spawn i freeze, cant move at all, only relogging fixes it...

PA paints were always 1400+ atoms. What pricing adjustments?

I'm saying I think they're leveling with me. I've been camped here a while. They didn't used to be like that.

Patch notes say lowered robot spawns nothing about ghouls and nuke zones. In end game, nuke zones are where most of the fun is.
---
nope.
---
meh cool concept, but rad resist is usless. 50 rad resist isn't a lot and on top of that rads are never really a problem. i have enough radway and rad-x to put my local pharmacy out of business
---
Man, I didn't make any opinions here on that stuff. I haven't even commented on the patch notes. I'm just trying to help you with your approach. But you don't seem to care calling everybody fanboys and not listening to reason. Have a good one.
---
Black bird power armor? Nuke lamp, fish lamp? Old Possum Beer Sign?? 
---
Not the greatest but decent especially for free atoms received from doing crap in the game you would do anyways.

---
Dion got really upset that they used his song in a game with so much violence and tried to sue Bethesda. Probably has something to do with that.
---
Is what it is, I spend a lot of time server hopping anyways so for me it's not game breaking. When it happens I just recheck vendors and hit the golf course again lol.
---
Not gonna lie. I turned Hangman's alley into one big hunk town with a gay BDSM bar
---
Hmm, I'll have to look it up, but I thought there was something about them lowering the prices from their guano-crazy heights to something more reasonable for "micro"transactions.
---
Just eat ionadized meat 
---
I would probably say something like, "As soon as you can tag things you can't build because you don't have enough gears or springs or screws, do it and never turn it off, because you'll always need those."
---
Wrong! Just loaded in near fissure prime, was dead before game finnaly loaded! ( XboxOneX)
---
Happens to me on PC so often that it's really taking it's toll on my desire to play. Brother started playing after Xmas and since the last patch, he's freezing too. Every "fix" seems to break more and more shit. 
---
Oh, well then. That sucks, I guess I‚Äôll have to say goodbye to that dream then.
---
Sweet I am def interested in buying some 
---
Fair point, with the changes to fire proof and dense mod already around do you think another % increase is needed for the boom boom?
---
&gt; Is what it is
---
I feel ya.  I was hoping it was better.  I think they are trying to improve it.
---
Its true that they probably cant keep a server truly dupe free. But this shit was out of control for an online multiplayer. 
---
The option to re-roll on something other than the current cluster fuck, would be nice. 
---
It fixed it.   Thanks
---
Weird... I have not been disconnected at all today, have you erased the game cache?
---
Well sounds logical except if the player is like me and dosent go to camp unless something really important and I dont linger there.  But I do go afk at times in random locations so good luck.
---
I cannot even fucking load in. 
---
My graph would include a section between the two that says "Forgot I wasn't in power armor and jumped off of something."
---
Who says they can't see it? Of course they can.

This is the part that really rattles my brain.
---
Cash shops are fine... As long as there are some basic options in game already.
---
We do have BoS initiate and and nuka cola T51b, which is a solid start, but... We definitely need some more coming soon.
---
That's good to know, since I usually dump my extra plans into that first overseer's camp trunk intending it for use by other players.
---
WILL SOMEBODY TAME THIS MAN A CAT FOR HIS SETTLEMENT!?
---
Hell, remove TSE while you're at it.
---
It's no fun if some dickwad is one-shotting everything in sight, including Queens. 
---
On PC, I crashed about 15 minutes ago and have been loading since. Ended task once to be sure but now just hung loading with occasional Server Not Responding messages.
---
Half the time I disconnect from servers before I load in.
---
Is... That a thing?
---
I dont bother downvoting btw so never downvoted you.  Your right not everyone should expect to instantly get great weapons fast, but honestly....its all luck based.  That was the only point I was making.  No reason to assume I downvoted you because I commented on an older post.
---
OP is da MVP.  Thanks for doing that!
---
Have seen the black cat alone at the random spawn near Overseer's Camp several times and no tame option has appeared. If they can't be tamed, I hope that gets changed soon. I want that cat.

I'm currently using this build.

I'll show you how worthless they were before the patch. You just have to have the correct armor and play style. Jumping around while aimlessly shooting the ground like a dummy isn't a worry. ü§ôüèæ
---
The building is a real and it‚Äôs a shockingly close recreation if it. 
---
I made that mistake the first time I killed a legendary in Watoga and the first time I downed a sentry bot. Needless to say I haven't made these mistakes again.
---
Something weird happened the last time I killed some legendary robots in Watoga. After getting a regular protection to explode due to crippling both of his arms for some reason none of the legendaries exploded. Made me feel so damn paranoid waiting 3-5 minutes each time just to pick up their loot.
---
I dont like the idea of making peoples weapons useless. I think rather than nerf them they should introduce other unique things that can hold there own with the TSE weapons 
---
That load screen keeps showing me glitched out pictures instead of how it use to show nice landscape shots. 
---
Alright seriously though:
---
This system as described would rely entirely on whether or not the person checking that flag is telling the truth or not.
---
How would you prevent someone from lying and getting a fresh new char in the pool of servers, finding the new "it item" and using whatever the current method is for duping that item?
---
Because the sign that says "hey no dupes here" is gonna be a homing beacon for these people. 
---
They need to just fix the damn problem once and for all. For all servers, not just accept it as a cannon mechanic on some servers but not others.
---
I farm the uranium fever event for steel. When the event is over I go around and pick up every single thing. Then I slow walk to the workbench and scrap it all. I've got 400+ steel in one run before. This is a god send for crafting ammo but it requires me to be hundreds of pounds over weight for a short period of time. I suppose I could make several trips but I hope there is a better solution
---
Isn't the explosive damage a bug anyways?
---
Oh damn... I‚Äôm so sorry. I have a ten year old cat named Max as well, and he has had some health problems recently so I got an extra lump in my throat reading this. Take care of yourself, Pinky-Pinky, and remember the good times. 
---
If you run non-PA, you should invest in White Knight (Agility) and Ironclad (Endurance).
---
Interesting experience this afternoon on PC after the consoles got updated. Wandering around between the steakhouse and Watoga, and got absolutely demolished by what I presume were Super Mutants near Quarry X3 (or whatever it's called). Was taking ridiculous amounts of damage with nobody in sight. Finally ran out of the region and got calmed down, and *then* the game loaded in the muties and their little encampment.
---
Later, I was getting a ton of awards and bonuses/atoms for strange things, like "Number of kills while wearing a hat". I must have picked up 1000-1200 atoms this afternoon for all kinds of oddball goals.
---
I get the message that vault Tec engineers are hard at work to restore servers
---
I thought some of the younger players might like the armor paint this time and the toy box was pretty hilarious. Of course, I did not like it enough to buy it, but they aren't too bad. Hard to appeal to everyone I suppose. The hot rodder paints and the blackbird paints were all I purchased so far. Still waiting for something really good!
---

I know this post is almost a month and all but do you happen to remember where you found the random lvl 91? I never find them alone or it‚Äôs a fixed spawn point and neither cane be tamed that way. 
---
Not a huge fan of screwing over people who worked hard to get a weapon legitimately, but as you've already said the only other option that would really work is to wipe the whole server. Which would screw them a lot more.l, so idk. Maybe for the best.
---
Yah I know they are, but not a lot of server stability improvements for me in over a month.  Just got kicked less then a minute after load again....right after a death to mobs that hadn't loaded in yet.....lost 150 pounds in quality junk items.....oh well lighter for it I suppose lol.
---
Thanks for all the input, making me a little more at ease in making this build have a better look
---
I'm on PS4 and have had no issues today. 
---
Thank you, and good luck to your Max, I hope he lives many years more.
---
Reckon ol mate Bethesda is going to get on here to answer your specific question?
---
dude got so excited he fell asleep IRL rofl
---
Where do you get the mod from? I've worn pretty much every kind of chest armor and have never seen it.
---
My bad, it said glowing ones will no longer grant large amounts of xp. I took that to mean spawn nerf.
---
Its in the PC patch too. Nothing to see here, move along.
---
I like 76. I haven't minded the game crashing on me every couple of hours, or a disconnect here and there, and I've resorted using the disconnects as forced server hops to find a couple pieces of t45 and t51 I'm missing but it's getting ridiculous I spawn in sometimes and get a DC before I get to anything 
---
Yes, I commented in a earlier post. Blue screen 8 times within an hour and a half 
---
PS4 player here and the game loads in the exact same as before, for me. I was loaded into the foundation of my base when I first logged in today (my base has been in the same spot for a week and this has never happened). I fast traveled out and then back and the game crashed. 
---
You buy stolen items from a yard sale and get caught with them you would still likely get charged with theft. At minimum your stuff would get confiscated.
---
Personally I don't like playing with anyone who uses tse for multiple reasons. Obviously the likely hood they are supporting dupers at the least is very high, as everyone knows these items are 99% duped.
---
Then if you're trying to share an event while farming legendaries the tse guys are one shotting entire groups of mobs, not allowing anyone to tag.
---
They have completely destroyed pvp to the point that it's not worth engaging at all. Pretty much every high lvl player interested in pvp can one shot any build, and completely sucks the fun out of it.
---
I generally switch servers or at least leave areas with ppl using these weapons. Just my perspective.
---
I put my door on the roof. Only people getting up there are marsupials and jet pack owners. 
---
And it‚Äôs locked for good measure. 
---
Yeah I mean I own a few tse myself more than one of different kinds that I carry with not several pages tho just my usual 3 or 4 I use. Now if you see 10 of each. That‚Äôs shady.
---
I already have a set of power armor skins that I paid 1800 atoms for, I spent 400 for the floor, and 500 for a door. It's been 3 months from the Beta, that's about 1k a month on average. I'm pretty happy with my PA paint so I don't think I'll get another, at least for a long time anyways. I'm really looking for only certain things right now and I doubt they're going to release atom sinks, toilets, tubs, wallpaper, and painted walls all at once, so I should be fine. 
---
I want on your server üò¢
---
Sorry man, I remember when my cat Lou died. He had gotten real sick before, but I nursed him back to health. Second time was hoping it was just the same thing, except I couldn't get him to eat this time. Was holding him trying to feed him from a syringe when he started shaking real bad and tensed up. Kinda felt what was happening, held him close, got a good bye out, he meowed (thinking he was saying goodbye back), and then he died in my arms. Had to bury him myself in my back yard. Horrible day...great memorial tho, nicely done.
---
You duped the game?!?! Report!
---
You wanna settle this in Appalachia, friendo?

It's practically the most op weapons in the game it one shots practically everything and melts behemoths

I think they might be running experiments on vault 76 without notifying the overseer

Sorry for crushing your dreams. :(

there is  a ritual mask as well it looks like a skeleton head on the ground. easy to miss haha i did my first time 
---
Kind of what I thought you meant.  Meaning invest all points into those 3 specials
---
I was expecting a player sleeping on a sleeping bag.....a an actual player sleeping...Nice!
---
Its their game son, they can do what they want.
---
It wouldn't be an option for characters that exist. On character creation you check a box 'Fresh'. 
---
That character, when assigning a server at connection would only search servers that spun up after certain day. Only characters allowed to connect have 'Fresh' tags can connect. 
---
Anyway, deleted the thread as its apparently already been discussed and deemed stupid.   
---
Enemies never noticed me but rads sure did. D/C inside Whitespring while buying a nuke grape only to reconnect outside in a blast zone and the doors don‚Äôt work/pipboy won‚Äôt open. 
---
I'm so confused when I come on this sub. All the complaints over disconnects and freezing and I haven't had more than 2 crashes since the game launched. 
---
I'm on an old ps4 as well. Maybe East Coast has better server options? 
---
I don‚Äôt have a pro but I have blue screened 5 times in 30 mind at white springs. 
---
Lmao that reminds me. 2 days ago i was playing 76 with the roommate and we were at robco doing an event when a legendary shows. Im in PA and my roomie is just in armor. We kill the first next to a car and while looking through the loot it explodes along with the car while we search and he dies. Ok whatever its one dumb death... It happens 2 more times in the next 10 minutes while finishing off the legendaries. Then came the searching for his bag of junk (since he started attacking as soon as he came back the first time). On a seperate note i wish bethesda would leave a mark on your bag specifically and then have death markers.
---
After lvl 45 the pve became so extremely easy, im glad we can pvp and actually find a challenge and  good use for all the strong gear, chems, stealth boys etc. 
---
I see on this sub also the most interesting stories come from encounters with other players. The kindness of players to eachother also becomes more meaningfull when there's also options to be hunted for your loot or ppl attacking your camp
---
I can‚Äôt repair some items or build a trapper leg because of this issue . I have the materials. But it says I don‚Äôt . It‚Äôs not asking for another skill either 
---
I'm in West Virginia and I can't get into Appalachia :( lol
---
They are kind of cool, but it's like Eso. In the end every single person has a little pet or two following them and then it is overdone and .akes everything feel a bit odd to me. Like why do you have two house cats following you into battle? Then a group of 4 there's like 8 dogs and cats standing around the party.
---
No one has visited my camp.. it's hanging off the cliff face above Blackwater mine :)
---
I will never understand why people spend real money in the ATOM shop. I mean yeah it's faster than earning them in game, but still. 
---
I mean dont get me wrong many of the items are still asking for more ATOMS than they probably should, but that's even more of a reason not to spend cash.
---
Legendary super mutants and robo brains have always ran away, even since beta for me.  It's always fun trying to chase them down when I'm over encumbered
---
Im sorry dude. Remeber him with the good times he gave you.
---
I find with explosives being glitchy when firing over railings it's useful to be able to aim way to high and hit around 20 meters.
---
The number of times I've fired a missile/nuke over a railing or ledge and the hit detection screws up and explodes in my face is too many.
---
It‚Äôs gotta be a balancing act. I‚Äôm not a fan of adding stuff when the old shit is broke. I think buffing laser and plasma would be a step in the right direction  
---
Bethesda has *never* spoken about adjusting their Atomic Shop prices. The community here has repeatedly said they are too expensive, something slighter cheaper in the store is released, and everyone says "look, they did it!". 
---
I would like to see videos detailing the etiquette for things like doing a run through The Whitespring golf clubhouse. Let everyone get their hits in, point out legendaries to other players, make sure pacifist mode is on, etc. 
---
Or how to help out as a lower level player on the SBQ event, like don't bother attacking the queen and instead focus on the mobs to help keep the high level high damage dealing players focused on the queen.
---
Or interesting spots in the game that are off the beaten path.
---
Or tips on how to get the most out of that new legendary weapon you got but never would have thought to use that type. What mods or perk cards will help make it better. 
---
Things like that. 
---
Don't want, exploits, walk throughs of common quests, how to one shot people before PvP even begins, or complaints about bugs and design choices.
---
This has never been a thing.
---
Bugs the hell outta me too. 
---
Lol apparently they'll let ANYBODY write an article these days. That was some poorly written garbage.
---
Ban them.  Permanently.  Effective.  Doesn‚Äôt hurt random non-dupers either.
---
the only problem comes up when you try to run a low hp build with radicool and keep your rads at about 20% level to keep your buffs up which gives me max hp at 20%. it doesn't consider rad damage in the equation.. so you just end up auto burning through stim packs while in combat(this doesn't happen while not in combat..). But I can't manually stim with "max hp"  if I'm at max hp and can't manually stim it shouldn't be able to auto stim..
---
Can't find the Automatic (plain) receiver for the Combat Shotgun. I have a total of 4: Auto, Focused Auto, Powerful Auto and Tweaked Auto....

Sure, but most of them got their weapon from a duper. No way TSE shotguns are that common. 
---
pretty sure they themselves did.

Hugely disappointing. That was the one big that didnt need to be fixed.

People would have made the meta without the dupes 
---
moved it and the issue persists
---
 He has been on my case since I was level 13 or so. He has killed me once after tracking me to my CAMP near Watoga and has been a pest.
---
 Last time he showed up I showed him my new Combat Shotgun with the explosive effect. Just single, nothing TSE or anything. That cut his health in half and he left.
---
Server hop high level areas preferably at odd times of the day or night before someone has already taken it I get better luck in the early am or really late nights
---
I wasnt aware at the time, but I dont really care. Its a good location and the only people that whine about it are already server hopping. Chances are, it wouldnt have been there anyway.  
---
Your camp is likely over budget, things in storage still count towards the budget. Scrap some stuff in the stored tab and it might let you build.
---
Moved it, still have the issue, I think this is new I've never had this and build a lot
---
The CAMP system warrants an exhaustive patch all of its own. 
---
No worries brother, just trying to help out how I can :-)
---
This is why we need the default coatings we had in fallout 4. Explosive shielding or whatever it was called would help tremendously

Seen this all the time, it will happen

That's exactly why I tested it I wanted to get 1000 rad resist from toys!

If you blow all the limbs off a gutsy, he turns red and starts rushing you because he‚Äôs about to go kamikaze on your ass. Watched several melee characters rush in to meet this glowing limbless foe only to meet their end and lose their fucking mind over the mic.

Was farming some nuke zone legendaries from Watoga the other day and one of the low level players in a hazmat suit didn't know about the exploding robots. Needless to say, it was hilarious to watch his corpse fly through the air after the legendary protectron blew up in his face.
---
I hate nerfs of all kinds. Theres pacifist for a reason and nuke zone farming is the only time people play together so why nerf them?? This lets punish dupers and the hell with everyone else mindset is getting old. At the end of the day the cheaters will move on and the rest of us who enjoy the game are the ones who will be getting fkd.

If OP isn't interested (or not on PC) I'll take the poster plans. Don't want to snipe OP though, so I'll let him have it if he responds.

Sure, there is no current punishment for it so go ahead.

Oh. I haven't heard about people not using it. I've just been using it instead of gunsmith because the cost to repair pa is a lot steeper.

I usually wait till it lands and just plow it away with my melee weapons and kill it immediately

What proof do you have?

Why not non automatic rifles? 
---
props to you for not being a dick and killing him.
---
Do you still have the lever action rifle plans?
---
Yikes. They should be nerfed but not to uselessness. Explosive does serve a purpose and that is to spread damage around. What it shouldn‚Äôt do is vastly increase hitting power. And it should never stack with big damage boosting legendary effects like two shot.
---
Fix that and you have an effect that can damage a few more enemies at once but doesn‚Äôt actually hit any one of them any harder than a normal shotgun/rifle. There, done. Also, the AOE explosive damage component should be less than full damage. Real tired of these being effortless no-aim guns.
---
Done. Now it serves a purpose, offers something different while not being comedically OP.
---
Some numbers: base weapon damage reduced to 85%, and the removed 15% is added back as an explosive AOE effect. If you get the Demo Expert perk, the explosive component gets boosted to 30% base damage, so in total with perk investment it ends up as a 15% bonus past normal damage. So not bad! It beats Mutated and the 10% bonus while aiming.
---
But if you miss, at best you get 30% damage. And that‚Äôs a percentage so even a shotgun won‚Äôt make it crazy now. With how DR works, that won‚Äôt blow away anyone. So aim.
---
lol is all i can say to thinking tambo and meat hook were the same weapon lol lol

Once the amount of known issues reached four digits they thought twice about letting it out into the public, less they give youtubers even more cannon fodder.

Some dude basically one shotted me while I was in PA without even taking my workshop to initiate PvP, that's how bad this exploit affects people.

The 2/3 power armor spots down in Watoga is how I got mine. Luckily I have a friend who hooked me up with a jet pack for it üòà

That and 16 Tons are my favorite new songs in 76.

There's the article, so you don't have to go in the site if you want to read it.

&gt;  **Fallout 76‚Äôs dupe hunters are the new griefers**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The Fallout 76 community is turning toxic in its efforts to police cheaters.  
---
&gt;Whether it‚Äôs players burning with the flame of self-righteous justice, or a bunch of griefers just looking for an excuse to be utter turds, the Fallout 76 community has got a problem and its using dupers to justify it.  
---
&gt;Duping has been an issue in the game since the discovery of **an exploit that allows players to replicate items** in their inventory, resulting in a ton of high tier items flooding the game and being sold for real-life cash. People using the exploit create an alt character ‚Äì usually low level ‚Äì to load up with their illicit gear.  
---
&gt;So now, high level players who have been slogging their way through post-apocalyptic Appalachia, have taken it upon themselves to enact swift justice on likely-looking candidates, presumably meting out the punishment they feel Bethesda has neglected to enact.  
---
&gt;The problem with this is that no one appreciates it when jumped up prigs who can‚Äôt seem to mind their own business decide to police their peers. While dupers are annoying, Bethesda is taking measures to patch out the glitch with the [latest update](https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/10/fallout-patch-pc-perks-weapons-crafting/). Admittedly it‚Äôs not the first time the company has claimed to have fixed the issue, with a [late December patch purporting to have done the same](https://www.vg247.com/2018/12/20/fallout-76-last-hotfix-pvp-in-2019/). Regardless, it‚Äôs aware of the problem and is on the case, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped wannabe do-gooders from ruining legitimate players‚Äô fun.  
---
&gt;üì∑  
---
&gt;Take this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afhw3h/people_have_taken_hunting_dupers_too_far_to_the/?utm_source=reddit-android) in which TGriff97 introduced his girlfriend to the game, and built up a camp, only to have four high level players sweep through and trash everything.  
---
&gt;‚ÄúUpon messaging the guy to figure out why he leveled this base he said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not stupid, I know it was a stash‚Äô and proceeded to treat me like I am one of those dupers who are ruining one of my favorite games,‚Äù he writes.  
---
&gt;[Another Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afhw3h/people_have_taken_hunting_dupers_too_far_to_the/edzp6vb/?context=3) in the same thread recounts being killed by a level 170 player, writing, ‚ÄúI had a level 170 guy show up while I was giving away low level guns to out of the vault characters. He came and killed me and took my shit then was like ‚Äòwhat the fuck dude, where is all your shit, I thought you were a duper‚Äô. He kills me to be a hero and expected me to have stuff, which i didn‚Äôt cause I give it away, then was mad I wasn‚Äôt muling or duping.‚Äù  
---
&gt;The problem seems to be escalating, and a new thread on these **vigilante dupe hunters** popped up on Reddit [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afpg9f/more_examples_of_vigilante_duper_hunting/). It‚Äôs full of anecdotes of players being confronted by these self-appointed inquisitors, throwing around accusations and threats of reporting, and generally being annoying anal fissures.  
---
&gt;Self-congratulatory posts on Reddit are appearing with players patting themselves on the back for killing suspected dupers.  
---
&gt;[This particular player‚Äôs suspicions](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afw86j/i_caught_a_duper_on_ps4/) were roused when their target server hopped after realising they were being watched. Calling themselves the ‚Äúcop of the game‚Äù they followed their mark, lured a Scorchbeast to their location, scooped up the dropped loot once the player was killed, and dumped it all on another server. They even contemplated sharing the ID of the player they had killed.  
---
&gt;If you‚Äôre a low level player who‚Äôs been at the receiving end of a magnanimous benefactor, or have made an alt character to carry your perfectly legitimate loot around, just be aware that these sanctimonious little fart sniffers are out there.  
---
&gt;We can only hope that once the console patch [drops tomorrow](https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1083858081002541056), the dupe glitch will be gone forever, and we‚Äôre left with good old-fashioned griefers who mess up your shit just for the pure joy of it.  
---
&gt;While dupers may be a thing of the past following the update, some players are still filling up their inventories with ill-gotten weapons and gear after [accessing a developer room](https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/13/fallout-76-players-are-having-a-field-day-in-the-newly-discovered-developer-room/) that contains every item in the game.  
---
&gt;Bethesda is automatically suspending the accounts but that hasn‚Äôt stopped some people from transferring the goods to alt characters before they‚Äôre intercepted.  
---
&gt;If you‚Äôd like an online Bethesda experience that‚Äôs less fraught with bugs and a-holes, why not give The Elder Scrolls Online a whirl? Alex will tell you all about how marvellous it is [right here](https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/11/elder-scrolls-online-keeps-getting-better/).

The man sits on a throne with golden sunbeams cast out from his head. I cannot possibly fathom being such a spectacular human being. 
---
Watoga Train station.
---
It has advanced power connectors, brick, and barn sets. Server hop to find it.
---
Ive never done it before so might not be much help...sad face..
---
Where did you find him ? Spent all day at the Dirt track waiting for him, and he did show, we also took Sunshine and some other workshops with no luck .. 
---
I just don't understand why it's even in game, you can obviously tell when you go chameleon by the adaptive camouflage, so the flare is just there to piss us off?
---
I don't need help. You could just tag along bb. I just solo the whole thing.
---
the poor dupers :*( protect them
---
Nothing like scrolling through 5,000 items haha, what a troll of an idea; I like it.
---
Shhh
---
I have been encumbered since day 1 of beta.  I find the system ridiculous, so I do it my way.  I roll slow and heavy.  I'm not a terribly effective tank, and my dps is meh, but my survivability is decent.  
---
I pick up pretty much everything.  I use green thumb to get my vegetative matter, cook what I can, use what I can of that, and whatever spoils I turn into gunpowder.  Keep closing the loop, yeah?
---
Then it's grab and scrap of all the standard weapons and armor.  I'm in the 100s, and still missing a lot of mods for weapons, but I keep scrapping everything for mats.  I sell the heavy legendaries that I don't want or need -- junkie anything, etc.
---
I get disco'd a ***lot*** when I'm selling.  It's a hassle.  I log back in, load for a few minutes, enter Whitespring clubhouse, load for a while, drag myself over to the vendor, and get disco'd again.  After a while I stop trying.  I was carrying a lot of valuable mats the other day, and died.  Someone ninja'd my stuff, like 800 pounds of ulcite, black titanium, bulked springs, lead, screws, etc.  That sucked.  I was planning on making a new set of PA, and had to start over gathering mats.  /shrug.  I still get to play and kill chubby glowing ghouls, so whatever.  Being a thief, being an asshole, is that person's loss, whether they accept it or not.  
---
Game duped itself. I just wanted that music to stop and to be able to move my mouse to the outer edges of the map
---
I just wish there were more paints. I just wanted my character to dress like she's part of the Pack! With bright pink hair and a green baseball bat.
---
What would be funny is if a typo makes it into one of the nuke codes and no one could solve it for the week.
---
The substations offer a small amount of power (10, I think) but gain 100 if you power up their associated power plant. The 100 power lasts only on that server. If you log into a different server, you'd have to power up the power plant again, unless someone on the server already did it. 
---
fixed*
---
Agreed. Useless dumb event. 
---
My biggest complaint is they spawn INSIDE my fucking house. What‚Äôs the point of walls or defense when the bitch comes past my level 3 door and is in my bedroom destroying everything. At least spawn outside if you have to consistently attack me
---
gotta be 16 tons in 76
---
Majority of gaming articles these days seem to just be bandwagon garbage. First noticed it with GTAV and all I can figure is they were looking to get web traffic. Still my theory. I'd say it heavily applies to Youtube these days as well. Everybody and their brother has a "ERHMAGHERD 76 IS TRASH!!!1!!"
---
100% difference for ps4.
---
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs going to be a solution that everyone will like. This game desperately needs balance. Something‚Äôs gotta change 
---
I would so keep that.
---
I mean you'd have to be a bold face liar to say TSE weapons didn't make the SBQ a joke. People just point at the ground of other players feet and blast explosive rounds whenever new mob spawns come in
---
Classic here, him I'm not sure.

Oh I‚Äôm on PC...

&gt; But even that could have been manufactured rumor like the trade steal thing.
---
It is, there's zero evidence of this and plenty against it.
---
Yeah, it's reallynot hard if you have at least alright, passable end game gear and/or a full suit of high level PA and supplies it's just a pain in the ass to walk around completing all the time wasting mini quests getting to the control room while dealing with the robots.
---
That's how it always is on online games they always jump to hacker
---
Unfortunately the Scammers  (more appropriate name for the dupers) completely ruined the meta by mass producing extremely rare legendaries.  I have my own explosive weapon that I picked up from the queen but I'll happily give it up if that means fixing this mess.

The Preston Garvey and Axe retard role players look at you from the shadows, yearning for that respect.

Walk the monorail line from the Monorail Elevator to the west! One of my favorite things I‚Äôve done in the game. Can‚Äôt get up to the rail itself without marsupial or a jet pack.
---
I like how you think.
---
&gt;Lower chance of fusion cores spawning in world generators - why?
---
This is actually a welcome change, fusion cores were way too plentiful. Most people just toss them out by the dozen because they weigh too much and they can't really be sold (since they're so plentiful nobody needs them). 
---
Makes sense for them to be a little more scarce anyways. Realistically most of them would have been looted anyways.
---
That said I do think the lack of communication is an issue.
---
Idk how frequently I have to repair but all power armor legs definitely break faster then the rest of the armor

Well. I didn‚Äôt call them that, but now there‚Äôs no chance I‚Äôll come across one without thinking of this so. Thanks for that. Legitimately. üòÇ

look at me, i'm the camptain now
---
alot of Random number names are.
---
1. Alt accounts for ppl to dupe and exploit.
---
2. scammers like the chinese selling cheats and shit.
---
Dont get sucked in people communists are everywhere lol :)
---
All dlcs will be free, so you wont have to ‚Äúscrew them‚Äù. Whenever you decide to start playing again you‚Äôll just download the updates and go, free. I agree that a lot needs to change still, but I give them some credit for not creating a paywall.
---
Not that I pvp but I like the irony of the power armor, which was military, not being efficient in pvp lol.
---
Posted in another thread that I logged in, died from radiation before I could access my pip boy, then immediately got blue screened. Turned system off.

Still grumpy. No idea how much I lost to this BS

---
Not holding my breath, but Ive seen u/lonevaultwanderer respond to posts before, the irony is its usually to the effect of "the dev team is aware"... the very thing that im asking for in this post.  (And if they would release the list, they wouldnt need to repeatedly reply with said quote).
---
Location and faction lore
---
Is it confirmed a mutation thing? I've had enemies load in seconds after I died.
---
Unfortunately these childish scammers completely ruined the meta and flooded the community at large with super powerful and incredibly rare legendaries. Not only shoudl the dupers be punished but frankly anyone who enabled them. How could you people not foresee how these would make the game a dumpster fire in the long run.
---
I have one, and it's just weird. 
---
Classed as a pistol, does the exact same damage as a pistol, but range is *far* less (range 12 vs 204). Not sure why you'd ever use it. 
---
If it was classified as a shotgun it would be a meaningful difference, as of right now it's pretty much a worse version of the pistol, 
---
Watoga is probably your best bet. I have found pieces at arronholt farm as well though I can‚Äôt remember if they were high or low level. 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Survival diffulty in 4 wasn't too bad. It had tough moments for sure but the game still dumps a lot of loot on you.
---
Playing the Horizon mod with desolation mode and +1 difficulty was the toughest and most enjoyable Fallout experience I've so far. I'm hoping Bethesda releases hardcore servers in the near future that are similar (less loot and tougher enemies for the most part).
---
What'd these guys do to find it so fast? Get lucky finding two or three of the same type code really quickly and then trying possible codes from a decrypter script?
---
That's all I ever see, are people in jetpacks (used to be rare before the dupers came along) with their quad or TSE weapons just jumping around and shooting the ground.
---
That is a really sad story. I'd be broken for a long time from that. *hugs*
---
Nope. I have played the entire game overencumbered and sacrificed fast travel and sprinting. 
---
Leave me my jumping for the sake of decency.
---
I for one, grovel in humility and kiss the feet of these virtuous men! Saints be praised that we, wretched, and unwashed infidels should have such a shining example!
---
If it gets enough upvotes, one of the community managers will see it. Whether or not they *respond* is another matter, but even no acknowledgement or comment would be a response of sorts.

My character is stuck in white springs. I keep blue screening before I can get out.

...which is awesome. 
---
It was fixed. I and a friend of mine have used serums with carnivore/herbivore in effect and they applied just fine with no negative effects. (Until the serum wore off, of course. Then the mutation effects were normal.)
---
The chiming sound too. Why does it need that?

You should check r/Fo76bazaar

Lol. I'll keep an eye out, patriot.

I refuse to use power armor (unless my hazmat suit breaks) and I refuse to jump and shoot. üò≠
---
Beautiful memorial. Sorry for Max. At least he didn't suffer
---
Maybe that's what I read and confused it with a Bethesda statement, entirely possible. $14 for power armor paint is patently absurd.
---
Yessir

I have all the mutations. I wanted chameleon and it was the 18th mutation I got.

dont attack the whitesprings staff please this is against whitesprings protocol and health and safety guidelines.

If you do attack a whitesprings employee all whitesprings staff will immediately find you and eliminate you.

Thankyou for your patience this has been a pre recorded message in company with The Whitesprings :).

I actually found a few weird spots I'd like to try. The Dried Toxic lakebed in the Toxic Valley can be built upon despite being a named location. There's also a second lake near the Charleston Fire Department that'll take a build. 
---
Neither place ever has CAMPs, since they not classically 'attractive" scenery.

My current base is at a *very* flat cliftop east of Silo Bravo. No water, but there's so much flat land!

My excavator armor never went below 100% for my first 30 levels with it (built to 130%), until it was one-shot by a stacked nuke when I was in pacifist mode...

I k n e w something like this was gonna show up

Bethesda* they‚Äôre*
---
Wanted bounties do come out of their bank when claimed. Also if the bounty is to drain a player of all their caps they have a "Bankruptcy Penalty". This is active for 3 gameplay hours and results in half damage to other players. 
---
We organize everything so everyone has a job. 3 people farm the code pieces in game while everyone else clears a silo (one person per silo per server). Then i run the code pieces through nukacrypt. Once the possible solutions are found i create a list with all of them. Then i split the list amongst the people in the silo. The people got lucky that it was early in on their portion of the list yes. 
---
Grafton and patience 
---
Dude, look crafting fuel is bs because you get little fuel when you do craft even with super duper and ammosmith. If you regret it I'll buy it from you for 3k and also a TS lever action. If not that's totally cool.
---
i mean... shut up... jk... im not...

Biggest weak spot on robots if you can sneak up on them is their combat inhibitors. 1shot sneak kills even on top tier sentry bots with my rifleman.

This
---
Yeah this is terrible lol 
---
Counterpoint: You are probably a sad troll that doesn't even play this game. 
---
This isn't even decent trolling, I feel like you should get an award for effort because it is so pathetic.
---
Inventory items stored on your client (your console/computer side), get updated with their server.
---
If you're carrying items in 10's of thousands, you may get insane FPS drops and disconnection issues.
---
It interests me you mention disconnecting a lot with vendors. I believe this is related to carrying unholy quantities of items.
---
I would like to say its all on you.. but you might be actually causing lag for other people on your server.
---
You gotta let the hoarding go bro
---
300 atoms! 
---
lol thankyou solider ;) advictorium 
---
This is not new. There have always been problems with the servers crashing during nukes.
---
Also, my camp was on the main road to Morgantown for a long while, just across the river from Mama Dolces and VTU. Plenty of river water, close to a train station and you get some visitors (mostly lowbies). 
---
I've had several two shots drop and I think 4 or 5 explosives drop I've never had a two shot explosive drop
---
lol :) 
---
Haha damn patience. Thanks
---
good luck with that man by the time u craft it the fuel will be gone fun gun but it get old quick.
---
Thank you!!
---
I‚Äôll give ya 2 steel scrap for it
---
Yes you can. Locking the secondary account‚Äôs view (making sure it won‚Äôt go into idle rotating camera) by sleeping/sitting in a chair will help dramatically with performance after initial load in. 
---
What a worthless idea. 
---
TSE weapons are the only ranged counter for the 85% of the community who one shots everything with their melee build and essentially invulnerable power armor. You want balance to the game, nerf power armor while you're ruining ranged explosive builds and lets see the crows fly then. 
---
Nice, that's a good spot. 
---
O S H I T
---
I can agree with the laser and plasma buff. 
---
There are way too many twigs and 2" tall rocks I get stuck on just walking through the woods NOT encumbered. Youre one sick puppy to come up with such a sadistic notion.
---
I‚Äôm good just wow that much junk for like 5 seconds 
---
Ya
---
Yeah, it's annoying. Particularly in that it only goes one way, so if you have a stack of 200 purified water and you want to sell 5, scrolling too fast will take you past 1 and back to 200...but you can't go past 200 and back to 1. 
---
I think they aren‚Äôt worth the perks because they require someone to be downed...
---
(In my experience) most deaths come from self inflicted TSE misfires or similar situations involving damage that straight up kills you. I am rarely ‚Äúdowned‚Äù and more often than not, dead. If you were using the ‚Äúrevenant‚Äù with team and were intentionally downed for the the damage bonus I could see a use for it, but there are just straight up better cards and HP is easily restored via Stimpaks. 
---
Yep takes the right person to want it 
---

I ignore the clickbaiters and game writers now.  Not even worth my time to read their spew.

Put me in for Bongo,bongo,bongo (civilization song). Game would be for my buddy who likes to play sniper in every game we play. Hey he can do that while I wade in with my cultist knife and All Rise sledgehammer üëç
---
Well time to build I suppose.
---
If it ain‚Äôt broke, break it!
---
I just ventured out of my PA yesterday with a low health build. This is the primary cause of my deaths so far. 
---
Depends on the weapon that has the TSE legendary effects. Your correct that something like a (non blackpowder) pistol, smg, low damage gun in general won't always one shot you. (Though it will feel like you were due to high rate of fire.) However ALL higher base damage weapons such as rifles/blunderbusses/dragon/etc will 100% one shot you because they are doing upwards of thousands of damage per shot.
---
You asked "Why 500%?" Well thats because of the game's stacking damage bonuses. Lets say a weapon does... 100 base damage per shot, (which is well below a black powder rifle) now you add damage perks so you have +60% damage (160 damage) then you add base sneak damage +100% (320 damage) Now we add Two shot effect +100% (640 damage) Now we add explosive effect +100% base damage (1280 damage) now we add explosives expert +100% explosive damage (1920 damage) PER SHOT, and the explosive damage ignores ALL armor, in a massive AOE effect. And this doesn't even account for bobbleheads+20% each/chems+25%pshyco/Sandman perk+50%/assasain perk+25%/half a dozen other perks+50-300%.
---
Needless to say, this game's damage numbers are broken on a cosmic level for pvp. (And even for most of pve)
---
i bet you've wasted money on the atom shop

How do you get 600 carry weight??
---
The last 5-7 I‚Äôve done have been that way. But I already got and learned the brotherhood paint, and have gotten an outfit or 2. I don‚Äôt know if that affects it

So if you hit left trigger a couple it‚Äôll go to zero but what‚Äôre you do don‚Äôt use the joystick on accident.

You're welcome my dude.

Also I call scorched "spicy bois"

---
Ammosmith would make it 9 per craft, and Super Duper would sometimes double it to 18.  That is about the best you can do.
---
You don‚Äôt just ‚Äúpatch‚Äù duping. No matter how much Bethesda tries to fix it duping will always be an issue. People are literally always working on finding new dupe methods and exploits. This isn‚Äôt something Bethesda can win.
---
Xbox?
---
I've been using a Dense chest mod and it does most of the worst itself. I added rank 2 of fireproof, and now I'm pretty much immune to explosions. 
---
Also, scorchbeasts sonic spam attack is considered explosive so I take pretty much no damage from that either. Still wrecks your armor though. 
---
10 is too young.  Sorry.
---
Fair point,  but I dont want to have to return to camp to fix my gatling gun every 10 minutes.  Sadly Heavy weapons break quite quickly so it's almost necessary to run gunsmith.
---
I'm not wasting pistol tech and ammo on some cave dwelling n00bs when true brothers can use it.  If we just hand this stuff out to ignorant proto-raiders, it's as likely to be used against us as end up dropped in a lake.  BoS tech for BoS!
---
Serum prices are plummetting as more people get the plans.  It's like a 300cap serum on XB1 now.
---
Why would you have a camp at Whitespring to help people after the SBQ fight which takes place in cranberry bog? Seems a tad far.
---
I only really have a problem with people who put their camps right behind the golf club but some people will smash any camp in the Whitespring area.

I use a Bloodied/nerd rage/Radicool build so I tend to keep my rad damage just under 20% mark to keep all my buffs up. I wanted to start using Born Survivor perk because I'm not able to use stim mid swing, and even after the animation finishes stim can be very unresponsive. however if I put that perk on all that ends up happening is the auto effect eats my stims like Angelica getting into a cookie jar, despite being at max potential HP accounting for rad damage. I can't even manually stim before or after and it just goes off like clockwork every 20s... that's just too many stims being wasted. I can't imagine this is intended functionality of this perk now I could see if I took a sliver of damage say from hunger, thirst, ect. but I have max hp and it just uses them.. in or out of combat.

If you‚Äôre on PS4 I could make you a set if you have the mats

Wow

r/gamingcirclejerk
---
Dude I know you want it so bad you have made like 5posts I think I bought it from a guy that offered it to u and u declined 
---
I have one for 4k. 
---
Lot of good that did though, duping is still a major issue in Ark and new players still got stomped on from day 1 of launch.
---
Have ammo smith working to super duper
---
Oh no, that's horrifying haha
---
I can do the silos alone with no power armor, VATs or two-shot explosive guns. It‚Äôs definitely possible but my approach is not stealth. Hacker 3 to disable turrets, Picklock 3 to bypass the reactor room, a solid crippling shotgun to take care of Assaultrons and a decent gun or melee weapon to mop them up. 
---
Has been happening to me since the very first patch. Freezes and when I asked my teammate to fast travel to me to see what my character is doing, he said I was running. Since the latest patch teammate is now freezing as well. 
---
I haven't played much since this new patch but the hour I spent walking around Watoga was pretty interesting. Whole buildings glitching out so you saw through them, walking/falling under the map, and jerky server made it unplayable. I got 4/5 daily challenges done and had to shut it off. 
---
They need to get firing and hiring some mofos. This shit is ridiculous now. 
---
yeah pc is worse for most ive talked to (and myself)
---
I declined because he was selling it for a ridiculous amount. I didn't decline just because. 7k caps for a gun you can use for a couple seconds? No thanks 
---
*Imagine just being able to enjoy the game you'd like to play it without getting so fucking upset that other people are playing it differently then you.*
---
Oh dang, thanks for that. I've neglected workshops outside of junk. I have one in my camp now so time to expand!
---
I can trade you 2.5 k and a two shot explosive farming plasma with 3 star per plus 1 effect. Would that work?
---
People like you aren't going to be happy with any amount of reasoning behind a game balance change. Why? Because you just want attention, not actual solutions.
---
If you want to debate changes, go post on an official forum or god-forbid, over a post offering your own reasoning why changes should or shouldn't occur. 
---
Or you can just keep wasting bytes of our downstream.
---
No you 
---
Now this is the type of quality commentary I‚Äôm looking for! I see your point and agree. 
---
I say ‚Äúpractically worthless‚Äù as an exaggeration to make the point that some type of nerf is needed with these weapons. It‚Äôs a shame that a lot of the cool weaponry is overshadowed by one legendary effect.
---
It kind of reminds me how everyone back in Call of Duty: World at War online used the MP40 to clean house. 
---
Point being, more variety is needed and something needs to be done to lift up the other weapons. Your solution sounds reasonable and solid 
---
I've got a fast swinging nocturnal pool hook, at night time it does so much damage
---
Its simply busy work. Actually the whole game is. 
---
Nothing I do is a waste.  I am a gift to the world.
---
If you have Picklock 3 you can just skip the reactor room with the rads altogether.
---
I'm wondering around and killing sbq 3-6 times a day
---
Take armorer and craft below 25 if it's being broken down for mods, take white knight 3 for repairs(changes it to 1 of each material). 
---
I had the same issue, now I have 80ish fiber in my stash consistently.
---
Every time I respawn I get a misc. mission to pick up my bag of junk, with a quest marker on the bag. 
---
Ha I bought it but have nothing to spend caps on worse then minigun 
---
It actually would have been the tiniest bit useful if it was the other way around- i.e. pressing right would take it to 1.
---
Dont get me wrong, I would prefer that they didnt break it at all.
---
Ugh, this is going to be an annoying 2-3 weeks

I got one for you just for the caps
---
I think they did that because in all the games I would always cheese it it were I practically spent no money on a ton of stuff
---
Did? There's still new stuff being released there. Damn kinky stuff, too.
---
I know because... uh... reasons.
---
Sorry. I got confused. I forgot sit doesn't show up there. I had thought she showed at any nuke site.
---
Stupid fuck listen I‚Äôve played this shit it‚Äôs broken as fuck why would I even waste time trolling on this page I love fallout but this shits just sad 
---
Very fair offer, but sorry. I‚Äôm trying to get enough caps to afford a TSE Combat Rifle‚Äîonly reason I‚Äôm willing to part with a coat that was such a pain to get. 
---
Level 50 t51 found in watoga is stronger then xo1 and t61 and almost or maybe on par with ultracite

 I need to know that they know about the freezing. That is all I require to be content and wait it out. 
---
PS4, kevlar.x82, the game keeps crashing since the update. It just freezes and I have to go to the PlayStation home screen to close it. This has happened three times, two of them were 10 seconds in. The game is currently unplayable, I hope this is fixed quickly, thank you.

Ok nice what's your psn? I'd really appreciate it.

I did! I waited a good few minutes and then we even wrote a lengthy, whiny Reddit post while checking them periodically. Nada

My condolences, ive been there and i feel you

I've come across someone that set up like you in PS4.  It was so nice being able to scrap my junk and stash it, so I left a few stimpacks and a friendly wave.

Bad troll, sad troll, angry troll.

I feel for you, at least you get to vent, hope you feel better because you brought absolutely nothing else if value here.

Playing devils advocate, what kind of proof would you want? 10 minute video of being afk?

It doesn‚Äôt matter where the legendary enemies are it‚Äôs all rng. I‚Äôve gotten a 3-star exploding lever-action and a two-shot handmade at Whitesprings and despite the hundreds of other crap legendaries I got there, it‚Äôs as good a place as any.
---
20-30 seconds? Mine was like.. 2? lol
---
I reccomend sticking only to the forest, valley, and ash heap until you are 40ish. While there are exceptions, the lvls take a steep hike upon entering the divide. 
---
You'll want to be lvl 50 to take advantage of quest rewards being scaled to your level.
---
I was farming mutations. I already had healing factor and Speed Demon, and then I got herbivore. I use it right away and thank God herbivore disappeared
---
What's yours?
---
Yeah it is, just not according to you.
---
That‚Äôs not true. Overdrive is a chem that allows you to critically hit outside vats. It‚Äôs more useful on fully automatic weapons since they are not as vats efficient as single shot weapons.
---
Holy shit mate you got the big dumb tell me really how is this game good? It‚Äôs using an almost irrelevant engine it‚Äôs leveling system is broken to where if you add specific perk cards your unstoppable and a multitude of other issues so tell me what‚Äôs there to play 
---
It's possible the weapon mod list doesn't show the standard mods since you get those by default and done have to scrap or find plans to learn it. I included the default mods for armor for completeness, but I didn't do the weapon mods. Maybe post your comment on the original weapon mod thread linked above?
---
I'm at 585, I'm a melee heavy weapon build so 15 strength, marsupial mutation, radstag meat, excavator armor with calibrated legsx2.
---
And they have yet to fix the plus 100 carry weight on excavator if you logout while wearing it, whenever you log back in your plus an extra 100 carry weight.  But even without all that excavator will always be 100 more then any other power armor even if they have calibrated legs.
---
shhhhh
---
Sounds like a good question to me.  Also, is it just me or is sentinel armor the rarest of all the traits for armor?  I never seem to see it.
---
Because majority of fortnite players are kids who waste their money on a skin. Fortnite is F2P and has to use cosmetics to get cash or freemium. People don't bitch about it. Fallout 76 is a paid game. Meaning cosmetics aren't suppose to be that expensive. Since fortnite has to reply on sales and popularity to keep them going. 
---
Your points are valid and exacly what I thought initially.
---
But I've come to really love the healing factor mutation and started thinking how op would this be if it was active in battle?
---
Also for solo play I tried out the spiritual healer perk and it actually came in handy a couple times.  This card procs revenant, and if it also procced some kind of rapid healing that was active in combat, the right perks might cause you to revive into some kind of unkillable death machine for a while.
---
Dense chest mod + fireproof perk makes you invulnerable to explosions now, which are usually what cause instant death.
---
Not really, modern day insurance would only cover the ship that held the identity in continuity. So the if you replaced all the parts that is the original, all of those broken parts are salvage now.
---
That's not even really true. It never was. If you don't engage or retaliate, a good weapon/player can still whittle away your health in under 20 seconds. 
---
I used all rise for a long time until I found a 3* instigating Grognaks Axe.  Double damage on full health, +50% swing speed, +1 strength... with my perks loaded into strength and 2 handed melee, there are very few enemies that I can't one shot.  Pretty much everything but scorchbeasts, behemoths, and mirelurk queens.
---
I sent you the request from chaos that is me.
---
I've had that issue before.  It comes and goes.
---
I feel for you. I lost a very close furry friend very recently as well. Much love to you.
---
Please let me know when you are back online. I'd love the opportunity to swing by your camp and give the guy some recognition and pay him some respect.
---
Thank you. I'm sorry for your loss. 
---
You can tame most creatures to hang out at your camp if you have the right perk cards, but I've never tested it myself.
---
Try to simply step up the step at Fort Defiance entrance. Like what?
---
I've shared and posted my CAMP pictures. Deleted everything yesterday after my umpteenth triple scorchbeast attack. Funny it's still showing that a good 1/4 of my budget is used with zero items placed or stored. Kinda pissed about that . Now I'm homeless wandering the streets of Watoga. My kingdom of scrap for a decent place to build onto with no scorchbeasts. 
---
Or you should just do what the rules suggest and report them to Bethesda. Not use this forum for public shaming of players.
---
Harper's has it as well. Just gotta make sure your in that stupid level window (15-44 I've read, I certainly wasn't getting it on my main who is above there). Got it at Harper's the first time I hopped on my alt right at level 15. 
---
My r/oldmandog just passed a few days ago :( Everyone will miss your baby im sure. Stay strong. 
---
6 dollars for a clown outfit you can get in game? The fuck?
---
After 12 weeks of the game being available to play and it‚Äôs still pretty much a beta with how broken it is. Thanks for letting me pre order Bethesda. Just give me a call when the next elder scrolls comes out so I can blindly pre order another Bethesda game.
---
Just use the better Atom shop... eBay.
---
Thanks.
---
A man of culture 
---
Pretty sure it was the cause of most of my crashes 
---
I played for 3 hours after the update wth no problems and I'm going to sink another 4 in right now.
---
I suspect their netcode isn't lenient enough.  Dumping clients left and right due to blips in connections
---
done myself in a couple of times by launching a mini nuke too close
---
Logically duping is caused by the sever not saving your updates. If y'all placed DayZ you would know about 90% theory behind it because we had the same issues in that game/mod. 
---
Honestly most of the problems I see in fo76 we had in dayzmod
---
Well I use my shotgun exclusively for leg shots and it‚Äôs great (no VATs). There‚Äôs not much to fear from Assaultrons, Deathclaws, Wendigos, etc. when they‚Äôre just crawling around.
---
Yes. 
---
Try and imagine any instance where either of these cards would have been useful to you. Unless you're somehow constantly reviving people and everyone is taking aoe damage slowly losing health.
---
Well, fully repaired a few guns I know I dont have mods for, all level 45, popped some dady-0 .... nothing 
---
usually because most people i see with large bounties are killing peoples camps. Im not interested in fighting them, just trying to bring some wasteland justice.
---
The alien blaster was from Fallout 4. Every fallout has an alien reference.
---
How about lowered jump height as you become more overencumbered? Maybe when you surpass the 4x limit and can only walk, your jump is very minimal, even with marsupial?
---
What a beautiful memorial. Will definitely be paying respects when I play the game later in the week.
---
I don‚Äôt get how this story makes sense.  Duping is bad.  Cheaters are bad. 
---
But what is this I can‚Äôt even 
---
needs more raider themed furniture 
---
Its happened to me several times, the suggestions already posted here worked for me. It seems to happen most frequently right after exiting workshop mode. I remember once I got one of the prompts while sitting at a menuless workbench that led me to believe the game didnt register that I had closed workshop mode.
---
What in the goddamn?
---
It‚Äôs been this way since launch, and is intentional or at least rationalizable: think of the vendor‚Äôs number as ‚Äúhow much (more) the faction is willing to buy from you today‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhow many caps the vendor has‚Äù.  We don‚Äôt know why Vendor Bot Wallace was even willing to buy 200 caps worth of corn or unyeilding left legs.  Maybe his contacts outside Appalachia demanded this because they think all the Appalachians are dupers.
---
However, if what this post says is true that somehow sometimes you end up with fewer caps than you are told you sold the items for, then that seems like much more of a break in physics.
---
Leveling system broken? Perk cards unstoppable? Those aren't even real, legitimate issues with the game you big dumb. 
---
Lol, way to fail.
---
It‚Äôs pretty shit as a legendary. The base model gun is okay, but fire damage doesn‚Äôt stack, and with the high fire rate of the 10mm, you basically only get a couple ticks of fire for half a single bullet‚Äôs worth of damage while you reload. 
---
Anyone who‚Äôs played the game for a decent length of time and knows efficient farming methods would be so fucked.
---
This is a terrible idea. The very definition of cutting your nose to spite yourself.
---
There's evidence that every, all, or none of the many faction/countries/races all decided to send nukes at the same time.

Xbox One, Essa Blackburn. The game will not allow me to build certain weapons at all (such as the 50 cal.) and will not allow me to build most, if not at all, weapons past level 40. I have all the required perks and materials, and when I try to click the grayed-out weapon, it tells me that I do not have the required materials.

I make a nearly daily run to the cat lady's house west of Morgantown to pick up all the cat bowls. It's easily the highest concentration of plastic that I've found. Hit the high school after that and you're over 200 in two stops typically.
---
Fastest way to slogging through a long grind to collect the materials then equip ammosmith 2 and super duper 3 to get about 9 per craft with a chance to double. Then go fire your flamer for 1 minute and your out.
---
I absolutely do not like them, but quite literally the only way to use the flamer as a primary weapon is to get duped ammo. 
---
So those are your options, personally I recommend dumping it in your stash until they buff how much flamer fuel you can craft as it‚Äôs not worth it otherwise. Unless of course you don‚Äôt mind buying duped flamer ammo.
---
No.
---
Fun Fact: Ammosmith op if you craft your own ammo.

This is entirely odd-topic and useless but I love your username.

sorry for you loss friendo. Maybe make a thread over in r/cats so we can see the awesomeness Max.

I have 2 screens (one is from the laptop, the other is a monitos), the game runs well on the 2nd screen, but when i changed it to the 1st it has half the fps of the refresh rate (laptop screen is 75Hz). The only way to play on my main screen with full FPS is opening the game in the second screen then disconnecting the HDMI and the game goes well on my mainscreen, i have reinstalled the game, unninstalled and installed new nvidia drivers, but nothing seems to work
---
You could have recorded and reported them and maybe actually done something. Now they are out there griefing someone else
---
My condolences to your loss. Glad the community could give you some extra joy with the game.

not yet still stuck at work ill let you know

I understand where you're coming from, but you seem to misunderstand me. The existence of cosmetics that cost real money, while I still think is detestable, I also realize that it's an inevitability. My issue is not with the fact that you need to pay money for it, or at least, the MAIN issue is not. The issue is that they are charging waaaaaaaay too much. I would understand, for what it is, for the armor reskins to cost 2, 3 bucks, maybe 5 if it's a pack that works for all the armor sets, or if it were like 3 different colors of the same pattern, IE some form of camo. 18 dollars, for a product that most likely took them roughly, and I'm being rather accommodating with this estimate, one day to create, is frankly ridiculous, to the level where I honestly feel as if I've been robbed. I paid 60 dollars for the game, and they are asking for damn near one third of that price for a pallette swap. You need to understand that what I'm asking, at least right now, is NOT for the atomic shop to cease to exist. What I'm asking for is fairer prices, because the prices we are currently seeing are frankly abhorrent.
---
My guy what do you mean ? The entire game is broken that‚Äôs just 2 of its issues there‚Äôs duping everywhere so that makes it completely useless and pointless to even try to get things when you could just have a friend dupe one of whatever it is for you. Also yea perk cards can make you 100 % unstoppable with the right setup and a very easily big to manipulate you get 2 x speed and armor for doing this bug and with a super sledge you just smash people and it‚Äôs completely broken. Stash limit is weak. Bethesda‚Äôs money hungry so there selling there shitty looking costumes for money. They made a nuke dark product irl and it‚Äôs just a plastic clip together Mika cola bottle over a bottle of rum and there selling it for $80 come on dude don‚Äôt pretend this games good if you enjoy it that‚Äôs cool but don‚Äôt pretend there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it üòÇ
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty rare
---
They could "break" duping by unstacking a lot of items...
---
I totally forgot about that dog house box!! Saw it on my first time heading into sutton

Also, I apologize for the lack of line breaks, I have literally no clue how those work on Reddit, and it seems that every other attempt I've made at them has failed me, so I've given up on them.

I'm so sorry for your loss. I don't know which is worse though, to be there watching your cat be put down or being told about it later. I've been in both situations and the pain is immeasurable. I like to think my cats are now in a nice sunny, warm place now, lying there, looking down on me and judging me, as they loved to do. I hope you always remember the love and time you shared together with your feline friend.

600 carry weight, at level 35 it might as well be a pipe dream.

OK...I'm sorry if I'm not being clear.  let me start again
---
Solo play.  No-one is around to rev you.  If you die, there's a perk called "mysterious savior" in luck that has a good chance to auto-revive you.  Also life-saving legendaries do the same thing.  Stack a few of these and you nearly always auto-revive on death.
---
Auto-revives cause revenant (STA perk) to proc, which gives +50% damage for 2 min.  This is a pretty significant buff.  
---
I just have a few questions for anyone who has tested emt/spiritual healer perks:
---
1) is the heal active in combat?
---
2) how much healing do they provide?
---
3) do they proc off auto-revives, like revenant?
---
I haven't had a disconnect since like week 2
---
Kill them

Just decided to try location #4 even though I had no map for #4 and it worked!  Looks like #3 and #4 are just swapped!

10 is way too young. May the earth rest lightly upon him
---
Also why is it still happening? This kind of exploit in almost all games I have played is fixed in days if not hours. Often even before I knew it was a thing.
---
I get it tho, half the mobs in the game hit the legs, mole rats, scorched ect.  They to low to the ground to hit the rest.
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs bugged.
---
HA HA!!
---
How about Plan: 44? That doesnt give me a mathematical thing, it gives me a gun.
---
Worthless.
---
Your friend has to do it and you cant be on a team 
---
Horrible idea. First off Melee builds are the most over powered builds in the game. Melee builds can hit 10,000 dps. Gun damage is very bad. Honestly guns need a 30% base gun damage buff. TSE only allow guns to even be usable and compete with Melee. Now with the patch in PVP Melee builds can completely Negate the Explosive damage. Gun should have an advantage at range.
---
What needs to happen is buff base gun Damage by 30-40%. Then make it where Demolitionist can not be used by guns or only give a 25%-50% buff to Explosive guns instead of 100%.
---
Nope but thanks for playing.
---
You should go play some other game and stop crying, it makes you look weak.
---
If you're not good enough to figure out how to play the game while they resolve bugs and glitches and balance issues, that isn't our problem bud.
---
I agree. I love running into people and helping them out if they‚Äôre in trouble being overrun by ghouls, or teaming up to complete a quest and then exchanging goods before parting ways, perhaps never to run into each other again. Or, you can team up and make new friends and stick with them as you go, build friendships, and travel. It‚Äôs incredibly immersive. I love it.
---
Nah, level 35 is when you get excavator armor, while you won't get to 600 unless you luck out on calibrated mods, you can build excavator armor and benefit from the plus 200, which will get you to over 400.  Add marsupial which is farmable in an hour tops and you can get to about 450 with that and a decent food.
---
Sorry man. I had to put down my 18 (nearly 19) year old cat last Friday. I still see him out of the corner of my eye sometimes. I miss him on my chest/neck/face when I sleep. His brother is blind and searches the house for him.
---
Hm we tried that a bit earlier, didn't work
---
I disagree, events have their uses. personally i use events to collect a hoard of stimpacks.. easiest way to get them other than rng container looting. Also some plans are only gained through events and what about the mothman bonus from the light house event? 
---
I do agree tho that events need to be spiced up more exciting, eventually they do become part of the grind. but theyre still usefull
---
Then not sure, maybe it's the crazy amount of crap I carry because I have insanely high carry weight.

Ran into the same issue just now. Have the mats, but "Repair" is greyed out. Went Google-in', and came across your post.
---
Same happened to me just before 
---
It probably doesn‚Äôt help that the servers are capped at 24 players.
---
Usually when I login there‚Äôs 3-4 hovering around Whitesprings, 2-3 low levels people off questing near Vault 76, and 1-2 randoms in corners of the map.
---
The map always feels so empty.
---
Ok will try and see tomorrow thanks for the help

So if an event would give say a 1-5% chance to drop a legendary level 50 3 star heavy combat armor I would be more inclined to do that event. Is there any such event? People need a carrot, and if there are good rewards available people generally don't know about them. An invisible or unknown carrot isn't going to keep people moving forward, it's going to make them stop, that is stop playing, because they don't know where or how to get the stuff they actually want. SHould there be mysteries, secrets, hidden things to discover? Sure. But if it's too well concealed most people will quit before they ever find it. Line in the Sand is a good event to help with. Sometimes it's lower levels who haven't figure out how to fight a Scorchbeast or don't have good equipment for it. Being around to help with some DPS and revive them if they fall is fun. There's nothing worse than doing some big epic fight and getting a crap reward from it. Even if it was a lot of fun and everything was great. A crap reward is disappointing and anticlimactic.
---
LOL atleast you have a partial camp to come back to. I have had my camp just gone 4-5 times now. Nothing stored, nothing blue printed just gone. This game is beyond whack. If I worked at Bethesda, I wouldn't list them on my resume, and I'd be searching for a job at a real company, not this scamming hack company.
---
Exactly what the post is about.
---
I moved my camp. Started building. Went to adjust a wall and I couldn‚Äôt select any placed objects. (A) EDIT was grayed out at all times.
---
Full quit and restart cleared the issue.
---
Man you suck that Todd Howard dick hard. I‚Äôm not saying I can‚Äôt figure out out to play this ‚Äúgame‚Äù if you can call it that at this point.

No thanks, could just buff energy weapons. Melee currently is the modt powerful option with TSE weapons being a close second in power.
---
Weird... I actually didn't downvote you. Someone still trolling this thread maybe.
---
Then the enemies become passive.

Heat flashes I just got from a honey bee
---
They also could just like... fix the duping exloit and add a total limit of items in your inventory?
---
Totally agree, I killed 3 scorch beast in a long flight yesterday I got not one piece of armour or a weapon. So disappointed üòñ
---
On PC. Played for about 2 hours with no problems tonight. 
---
Even without all that I would still use or just for the laughs. 
---
I know, but the idea was solid. Bethesda might be more successful if they copy it. Stressing the word might here lol.
---
good bot
---
Watch. 
---
Press the transfer button, then in the menu there should be a button to transfer all (on ps4 it is the square button so I just click that twice to pick everything up - once to open transfer then a second time to transfer all)
---
It‚Äôs R R on PC
---
I am sorry for your loss, my friend.
---
I myself had a cat as my companion for 15 years. Her name was Mel.

It‚Äôs hard losing our loved animal friends, that we hold so dear. I know how you feel ‚Äî if you need, we‚Äôre here for you.

In Fo76, I sleep in my bed under the Mr. Pebbles, the First Cat in Space Poster. It reminds of her, and of how much she means to me.

The quad catling gun just sounds like the nyan cat video.

Disconnects here.   I think I am done playing in the evenings as the disconnects are far to frequent at this time.   The mornings (EST timezone) are better, not perfect, but definitely better.    I realize there are plenty of other people playing from around the world during my morning hours but the servers do seem better.
---
If we cannot rejoin the server we were last on can we at least not lose our daily quests?      That is by far the most annoying thing about the disconnects.

The vendor in Harpers Ferry will has the Brahman  pin plans. Like everything else he has it's a random but a fairly common random. I almost bought one this morning.
---
Just how it is.  Starts at 2. 
---
sorry to hear about your fur baby.  my condolences&lt;3
---
One thing to add, supply drops are no longer instanced loot. 1 crate for whomever gets it first.
---
True but I feel like you should be able to use it dorect battles too, I mean a syringe could be filled with any number deadly things that could kill things quickly. 
---
See. Wtf is this shit. Speak up or go home. 
---
I will join you @GTMBros 
---
Dupers.... wanna be cops.... both as bad as each other.
---
Neither of them are doing any favours to the players or the game. 
---
I tried so hard to make it work but it just isnt good.
---
Yes well a demon possed raider but yes his name is Faulksthadead 
---
Fair enough but when I want more hardcore gameplay I play dayz or scum. And realism isn‚Äôt a concern in fallout since we have magic bullets appearing out of two shot weapons, removable perks, everything we‚Äôre carrying up our bums gta v style and more.
---
I COULD live off the stash I have now, but that wouldn‚Äôt feel like a fallout game. Currently I have 10-20k weight worth of stuff on an alt character.
---
Wait. What? This is a game changer.
---
yeah for now I'm running white knight  just so I don't have to worry about that. 
---
I feel like such a noob asking this but what is TSE, I should know this I‚Äôm lvl 122
---
I started that quest at sub level 20 just to get access to the bunker and the stimpack plan. It requires lots of sneaking at that level but it‚Äôs doable. She‚Äôll still continue on with the earlier parts of the quest. Responders-&gt;Raiders-&gt;BoS still works even if you ‚Äúskip‚Äù to that point. 
---
You don‚Äôt have your perks or build optimized. I can reach over 3k sheet damage on my bloodied 1h melee build. Even when I was 2h I was doing over 3-400 with all rise

I have read about Death Claw's being tamed for settlements, I would find that bewildering if we couldn't get cats to do the same heh..my condolences for your loss.

*if you think there‚Äôs no actual problems that come out of duplicating items in a multiplayer game then you probably shouldn‚Äôt be playing said game. Plus that fact that anything that lowers the time and effort you put into a game make it worth just that much less, and ruins the experience for some of the people around them who spent actual effort on the game*

That's terrible.  I'm so sorry for your loss.
---
I'm on xbox too I will be on alot tomorrow and Thursday and most of the day Friday because finals are over do you mind playing with younger people and do you have a mic?
---
Did this remove the fusion core replenish glitch?
---
yeah, it‚Äôs on the schedule... somewhere.
---
Same
---
perks, drugs, bobbleheads, magazines (?), 3\* legendary weapons, maybe some armor legendary effects (?)
---
Have you tried stacking some bobbleheads? Works wonders.
---
Sorry, can you explain how you did this? What is 1h and 2h? What specifically are you doing to bump up the damage so high?
---
Take a work shop and defend it over and over easy camp prints or simply buy some off pc traders most sell for 100 caps or less or they will give them to you
---
Awe I‚Äôm sorry
---
Whitespring sells a lot of unique camp plans, but if i were you id take over like 3 workshops and bounce between the defense or retake quests and other named events. other than than visit the watoga and harpers ferry vendors often
---
Stacking bobbleheads? Shit I thought you couldn‚Äôt stack meds and chems and bobbles?
---
It might be fine if 3 turrets didn't take up 75% of your camp budget. Then you could actually defend it.
---
You sir are the real MVP
---
With damage perks, mutations, and max strength, you should see high 350-450 on your level 50 2h weapons.  
---
Next is just the right legendary effects and perks to get more damage that‚Äôs not shown on the weapon vats screen.  If you are doing melee 
---
Murderers don't get anything *necessarily*. But you do necessarily drop your junk whenever you die. It's the only thing other than time that's at risk in the entire game.
---
Spooky
---
Hmmm on PC still has a fuckin stroke upon load up, or entering any buildings, fast traveling. Same old song and dance. 
---
One and 2 handed melee. And basically just put points in the perks that raise that weapons damage. For a bloodied build you can probably google a better explanation but the just is you use a legendary bloodied weapon and play with very high rads and low health, then use unyielding legendary armor and the perks that increase damage with lower health and higher roads.
---
Ah ok np this trade is finished now anyway.
---
im guessing max strength/food buffs/unyielding/bloodied. what else are you doing to raise melee damage?
---
I currently have a trap base and have already killed 10 plus people so far..burn them alive lol I want to keep the bodies stacked in a room üòÇ 
---
I got some good news for you brother!

now if only some amazing modder would turn off that damn flare.
---
They do? At least when I have done it
---
People are downvoting this because it has nothing to do with fallout 
---
*takes notes*
---
Dunno if this was raider bait but a guy with a bounty approached my camp and gave the sign to shoot him. Some things gave me pause:
---
1) he was level 123 (I‚Äôm 117 myself) 
---
2) he seemed unconcerned about my heavy laser and missile turrets.
---
3) he followed me to the roof of my 3 story brick building, and continued to make the shooting sign.
---
I made like I was targeting something off in the distance, ignored him, acted like I was AFK - guy still wanted me to shoot him. So I bounced.
---
Last sounds I heard as the server disconnected were:
---
1) him pounding on my heavy laser turret
---
2) my missile, laser and shotgun turrets firing simultaneously 
---
3) his death rattle as he fell three stories and down a cliff when my camp disappeared.
---
Sorry guy, you seemed a little too desperate....
---
Xbox here. Just got disconnected running into another guy with power armor. 
---
When I joined another server I was met with 4 consecutive load screens. wtf.
---
not thru rocks tho which is annoying, because the code is there obviously
---
Alright, I‚Äôll do that.
---
There are a few that do cost more SPECIAL points at the basic rank. I guess that's because the perks are more SPECIAL than usual.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, never tried it that way since I‚Äôm usually running from something. FO used to have the option to take all. I‚Äôll try the transfer all like you‚Äôve suggested thanks!!
---
i'm making an automatic weapons mutant build just for this :P
---
At level 93? No thanks.
---
Would you take a pet in and just release it back into the wild? No, you keep them and love them forever and ever until they break your heart when they pass.
---
*laughs in 1800 atoms*
---
I try to help people outside vault 76 but they run away in terror
---
You think that because you're being downvoted that automatically means someone is stalking you?
---
I don't know what you're talking about but I'll contribute a downvote. 
---
Also check the overseers camp - I (and a lot of other players) dump extra plans there
---
It does.

Not directly related to fallout 7y

Disconnected multiple times, could not fix any gun, or craft ammo. So much for "fixing" bugs.
---
So screw mules
---
Gotcha
---
That was a tough one because there‚Äôs always a level 62 ghoul or two in that building. I waited for a nuke at Whitesprings and followed some higher level guys around to let them clear the way.
---
That‚Äôs sucks bro, as someone who‚Äôs had a lot of cats over the years I feel you. 
---
I'll be sending and accepting requests tomorrow. Thanks again everyone. I love this community!
---
No food or chems but yes max strength and unyielding gives me 36 strength. Then low health/high rads and radicool, nerd rage, all the weapon associated +dmg perks, a few mutations and boom! There‚Äôs a video of the guys build I used I‚Äôll try and find it and put it here in an edit.
---
It hadn't pressed my mind until I read this, that entire nonsense was amazing if you think charts and graphs are interesting to look at. RIP the pink partyhat.

The above video features a glitch in which I was taking damage from an unknown source over the course of about 6 minutes. Throughout the video, you can see my life bar decreasing, my sneak state constantly being in danger, and taking a slight bit of rads. To top it off, when I approached an event NPC, the invisible attacker assaulted the NPC and would continuously down him. You can also see the NPC trying to fight it, as if an enemy was there. This happened a little north of Watoga after I had been attacked by a couple of glowing mole rats.
---
Don't think that was a Raider, but since he came to your camp with a bounty it could be one of those camp terrorizers. He could've been a guy trying to end his bounty. It's annoying as hell to have a low one for so long, and you can't even find anybody to trade. But you got the reaction down. Us raiders cant do shit, leaving is the ultimate counter.
---
Some days, I really miss EVE. Then I remember Gate Camps
---
Yeah, that's not really true unfortunately. My game crashed as I exited Whitesprings bunker today (naturally) and when I logged back in after reloading, I was in a nuke zone. Completely unable to move while I died to radiation. When I respawned nearby outside of the nuke zone, I *still* couldn't move for another 30 seconds while the game caught up.
---
I did rifleman perks and made sure I also took full hacking and lockpicking so I'm not just a mediocre medic and everyone else has full build slotted and can do max dps.. And been running solo  silo runs to get my times down lower and lower finding every lil (legit) shortcut. Memorizing turret shut down locations etc. Have it down to about 20 min. Hopeing to hit 15. Tonight been a lil rough servers been extra glichy for me at least. (Side note: learned that super duper works on the mainframe things so I'm stockpiling them hope the shed a min or two off that section)
---
Can you be more descriptive like do you enter the bunker or is there a wall reach around the area?
---
It has to be a random spawn and unfortunately I don‚Äôt think cats randomly spawn anywhere, otherwise I‚Äôd do it for you myself. 
---
My condolences.
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
What platform are you on?
---
It completely passed my mind, you are entirely correct good sir. 
---
Thanks for the link
---
" PvP is just about as cancer as ark. " well te pvp on ark is pretty ballanced comapred to this..
---
i know why it happens, if you try to open your pip boy within like the first 90 seconds of loading in it glitches like that
---
I do hope you succeed in any response, but the games lack of a clan system really hinders anyones attempt to group up and do things together.
---
Ah ok I feel dumb now. Thanks! üòä
---
Ah ok, thanks!
---
I know. I figure it will be taken down by the mods, I'll remove it in a second. Having someone follow you just to downvote you gets old and this proved my point. I think.. 
---
I knew they were both different I just couldn‚Äôt understand why a 3 star was worse than a 1 Star weapon
---
You DO KNOW that some weapons upgrade at odd level intervals of 5, while others at intervals of 10, right?  Weapons of 5-intervals max at level 45. 
---
Build giant awesome camp... Find another interesting looking spot, destroy camp, build new cool camp, discover another neat spot, destroy camp, build new camp.... Rinse and repeat over and over for ever and ever.
---
yes i do this with my dupes. Im always leaving full sets of trapper armor
---
Funny enough, ESO also had massive dupe and exploit issues, and I heard similarly that it would never recover from the issue. If this is still true, I have no idea, but maybe they should really buckledown on that issue.
---
Legendary robots absolutely sometimes explode after they die. I farm loops of watoga all the time and I have taken to waiting 5-10 seconds after I kill a legend robot in case it decides to blow up. I lost track of how many times I've died to an exploding bot nowhere near any cars or vehicles of any kind.
---
It's not always though, maybe 60-70% they explode.
---
My thoughts were: if you need to lose your bounty, then drop your junk in your stash and head to whitespring. You don‚Äôt need to come to my camp....
---
I‚Äôm all about finding new and fun ways to shut down dupers, but I have around 150 bobble heads in storage because I won‚Äôt use them for some weird hoarder reasons. So I don‚Äôt like this idea 
---
Uh... you can.  Click R.
---
That would be godly for my main sniper/ unarmed character

The shop at the Welch Station has a chance of having the plans to make them in stock. You can go there and continuously refresh until they have it if it‚Äôs not there on the first try.

Sorry man.

Cats get a bad rap as these aloof animals that don‚Äôt care about humans, but that couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth.
---
As someone who owns 3 cats and who has raised kittens, lived with them my whole life, they are such affectionate and loving creatures. Mine are like puppies they greet me at the door, follow me around; if I take one step left they take one step left with me. Give them love and they return it 10x
---
You gave your boy a good life and he shared his love with you and you‚Äôll take that with you through your life and pass it on to others. 
---
May he R.I.P.
---
I had to put my cat, Scrat down in 2013, sucked big time! Had him since i was in highschool, i graduated in 01. Had him a couple years before that. He was an orange Tabby. Actually named him Scrat before the movie Ice Age came out, so i almost shit when i found out the squirrel rats name lol. 
---
I dread the day with my current kitty Moogles. He's a Russian blue. Incredibly intelligent and lovable. It's going to crush us. Condolences from the wife and i. 
---
I know where to farm them if anybody still needs to know...I know this is an old ass thread lulz
---
What basically was the old Clutter Decor mod in FO4?
---
just say: they banned peoples because called someone gay... but let the players duplicate and with the duped items ruin others gameplay...
---
I had to completely close out on ps4. Also bluescreening loke crazy now.
---
Mirv seems bad on fatman. Weaker damage and much harder to aim. 
---
Also with mirv the weightless attribute doesn't do that much, while stock fatman wth weightless is about 2 lbs I recall.
---
Maybe not when you're just a bit overencumbered but it would be a nice penalty for hitting double weight. Once you get it high enough you lose the ability to run, then stop being able to move entirely so it would be good to have an intermediate step
---
Na I am going to buy it
---
Deathclaw guantlet
---
Uh.  They do.
---
I had no such problem.  My only annoyance was someone else already had a camp set up were mine is so I had to jump servers for mine to spawn. Back in.
---
well that‚Äôs definitely an amount I would say nobody needs.
---
It‚Äôs X X to take all on xbox mate
---
because it makes all the sense to increase them by 5 and then stop 5 short of max level
---
Wish I could say the same for the XB1S, still getting constant crashes and framerate is horrible in a lot of places. In the three hours I played tonight I crashed 6 times. I probably will be taking a break for a few weeks until I can actually play a stable game. I've been able to put up with it until today but it seems that this most recent patch just made things worse for my game.
---
Thank you for those kind words, really.
---
You‚Äôre a good guy holding in him is last moments.
---
I know people who delivered their animals to the vet and left them to die with a stranger and nothing makes me sadder than picturing that :(
---
You held him and cared for him and comforted him on his way out, if you ask me that‚Äôs a pretty good way to go! My condolences 
---
Hun. They haven‚Äôt for me. Must be a glitch? Totally out of synch each time I‚Äôve tried it. 
---
I lost a cat of my own a year or two ago now. He was a good boye.
---
I‚Äôll try to make it on
---
Yea I‚Äôve never seen it drop just like a tse weapon 200+ lvls in, but just keep swimming I suppose.
---
I like the assaultron blade for 1 hand
---
he was lying to get people to pre order the game
---
That's the way! Have my upvote. Just don't shadow down vote me. I did this to prove a point. I'll remove the post. 
---
i have two star legendary deathclaw lapdog.. but have a really bad hit change against  small oponents like dogs or rats.
---
Go back to those bitches over at r/fallout
---
wait how did he find your camp if he had a bounty? He cannot see you on the map?
---
Either big iron cus' it's just engrained into my brain, or country roads because of all the hype it caused
---
Bingo bango. You are correct. From the way it seems that is what's happening. I made a few people upset on a sub where they were talking shit about me thanking someone for reddit gold (albeit it was a bit cringy but it was mostly all in good fun) and now they have nothing better to do. 
---
They don't increase by 5 they are offset by 5 ie lvl 15 lvl--&gt;25
---
thanks a ton, one of the few weapons i need that i give a shit about. F you tomahawk
---
Better direction would help with a few of the.. powering up the nuke plant was a pain because I couldn't figure out how to get i to reactor.
---
And the food one were you gather and deposit the canisters.  Just waves of this little china bots from no were with no reason even after we clear the place out.
---
Dont forget the plan: upstoppables poster
---
The last quest in that chain give you a full set of ultracite power armor. I think the lowest level it has is 35, so your sister wouldn't be able to use it for a bit. But if you wait till level 50, the armor will also be level 50, so you don't need to farm the scorchbeast queen for plans and spend mats to craft. Figured this info would be helpful if you didn't know already :)
---
They're worse on PC. I crash too often now
---
Well, Todd said a lot of things that aren't quite the way the work in the game.
---
I still want the fruit basket hat, idk if i missed it or it hasnt shown up yet.
---
The crashing on ps4 has got to the point where it is almost unplayable. Crashing barely a minute after logging in.
---
You DO KNOW that the ripper only has a lvl 40 variant right? Because I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be too hard to make it forty and 50 like the Radium rifle and like 2 extra damage to the Rippers 50
---
That was expected. It was mostly for the first few seconds it was up. I knew it wasn't fallout related and it would receive downvotes for that. I'm removing it. No worries. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. RIP, irradiated piece of toast.
---
This is not my experience on XB1 today. I'll load in, I'll be able to see and hear the game world, but cannot move or do anything for the time that it takes to load my camp or whatever is around me.
---
Weighless only affects the base weight of weapon. If a mod increases the weight of weapon by 4 lbs, it does it with or without the weightless.
---
So fully modded weighless weapons tend to be nearly as heavy as original.
---
In on this comment, I haven‚Äôt cooked at a station since Reclamation Day...
---
That's what I did. I wasn't going back down there until I absolutely had to. 
---
I noticed a few longer loading times but if that‚Äôs all it takes for the game to not slow down while playing I‚Äôll gladly take it.
---
I lost my shit when I found it.  With all my slugger perks, it does 283, so if the enemy has full health, it does over 500 damage.
---
Me too, although I'm on Xbox.
---
Big improvement for me on ps4. Game was a lot more responsive 
---
Does anyone know if this perk counts for 2mm Gauss ammo? That shiz is HEAVY!
---
So sorry for your loss. 
---
How do you tame things?
---
Non-binary.
---
I did the patrol duty event for the first time earlier today and got it on the first go! I had been looking for them also and never found them. 
---
I've seen level 45's.

*shrugs*

Oh hell yeah, I forgot today. Lit up a legendary protectron.
---
 ‚ÄúOh okay, another one star rolling pin...‚Äù 
---
Legendary Protectron: ‚ÄúYeEeET‚Äù BOOM.
---
So basically he fucked me twice.
---
Well, whether or not that's true, you've created a post here that everybody would vote down **anyway** because this subreddit is about Fallout, not about your karma.
---
But the Gimp's sleeping.
---
I have only tried with Explosive bobbleheads.
---
Depending on which instruments are being played together it can sound like an orangutan being stretched over a tennis court. 
---
cool. im tempted to get Grounded cause i dont use energy weapons, but have been hesitant. Only have a bloodied grognak and two unyieldings so far
---
Some mods*
---
Max was lucky to have someone who loved them so much. Thank you for sharing. 
---
Twice as many hours as you. I bought my TSE guns from the watoga and Harper's vendors. People were selling 2 and 3 stars based one the first buff, they weren't inspecting the items before they sold them. Got a ton of unyielding like this too before it become so popular.
---
Sweet thanks :)
---
Missed it. It's my favorite hat by far
---
Tysm
---
Call PETA.  They will come take it from you, then kill it through neglect.
---
Will do thanks
---
There is vids on youtube of ppl glitching thier way into the unopened vaults check them out
---
Sadly No. The terminal says you can only make one, and there is no option for my character to make another one.
---
Explosive is better, more accurate and possibly slighly better damage.
---
Plus explosive can be combined with some other good attribute like anti armor or instigating.
---
I happily would if I could! 
---
Don‚Äôt feel dumb.  It doesn‚Äôt make sense to us, either.
---
My son and I sing Big Iron all the time, and he always asks for Sixteen Tons now too. He doesn't have a copy so we switch off on my xbox. 2 favorites I guess. 
---
My best friend of 7 years passed last year. My orange furball. I feel your pain. I'm so sorry. 
---
The real deathclaws.
---
Fires twice. Two shot bullets like to fly quite appart, but at close range they usually connect same target.
---
It looks pretty good from what I've seen. A lot of demo footage is out right now as well. Soon there will be an open beta test as well
---
this makes trading with a teammate an absolute nightmare. you try to make something 0 caps and if you scroll too fast you end up at 25000 and cant go the other way back to 0. 
---
Or gun
---
RIP I don‚Äôt play on PC but I wish I could go to and pay my respects 
---
yeh farming whitesprings best bet or uranium fever.
---
i have a few tse weapons and am only lvl 45 so just grind the the grind and you'll get lucky eventually.
---
its like borderlands 2 with drop rates for legendarys you might spend 5 mins farming you might spend 10 hours its all rng :).
---
Good luck to you out there
---
I think the answer is they dont use it :(
---
I am a heavy weapons character and love my flamer but the ammo is horrible to keep up with.  Even with ammosmith and super duper perk you can only make like 9 (or 18 if duper kicks in) at a time.
---
I have even taken over specific workshops with multi acid resources to make ammo but for the amount of ammo you will make compared to how long the ammo lasts for it's just not worth it.
---
If they add a 0 on the end of the number when crafting it then we would be good with it.
---
This is a great idea, but I could see griefers using this to clear bounty then hop back in to continue annoying a person. Yes, the 2nd party could hop servers, but should they have to?
---
Wow ok where is that even at ? 
---
Nope. But I have them. I think one day I‚Äôm going to wander around giving them away to other players, but until then. 
---
So sorry for your loss. I lost a fur friend of 15 years just 2 months ago, so I feel that pain.
---
Someone said this to me once and it helped when my cat passed.
---
You will remember your cat for multitudes longer than their life. When you are old and gray, you will still remember them and tell stories about them. In that way they become almost immortal. That‚Äôs the cycle we all belong to, an unending chain of life preserved with memories and love.
---
My condolences. 
---
Does this still work? 
---
yeh i had trouble with finding the reactor also.
---
and the food processing one... actually there is a reason for the china bots being there.. maybe you should check out &gt;!under the plant.. theres a secret base under it if u like hunting for secret entrances ;)!&lt;
---
Same. 
---
My condolences, from one cat lover to another.
---
Can you explain how?
---
My wife got a max level explosive double barrel from a vanilla super mutant while defending the ammo factory. She was around level 80. It‚Äôs not two shot, but it still 1-shots pretty much everything.
---
Whatever. I have a fine collection 1* wood left arms. 
---
hey i got a tse lever action but am on ps4 and yeh about 3k to 5k is highest yo should pay.
---
There is a cat in Beckley I believe 
---
 Future content possibly.
---
I'm not worried about the karma. 
---
You can tame animals with a perk card, you can tame scorched, super mutants, and all that as well.
---
Hey there, I hope you are well. 
---
Just a heads up about update to XBOX1 today Jan 15/19 There are serious server problems, I keep getting booted every 15min on the hour, I have checked my Internet connection it is sitting at 75MBs? Other than that, It seems the other improvements are working well, and they are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and understanding in this matter. Profile name MenededManis1 
---
Kindest regards, 
---
Jay Bird      
---
What ‚Äúthing‚Äù is this?
---
I have no idea if it‚Äôs a random spawn point, but I used to have my camp just south of the creamery, where the road is broken and underneath the broken road there‚Äôs a tent and a dead raider. 
---
If I traveled down the hill from there, I‚Äôd see a cat every now and again, around the trees. 
---
I‚Äôve been experiencing this as well since the game was released. the patch today didn‚Äôt seem to make a difference either, sadly. i hope this gets fixed soon 
---
Don't know how seeing as they're not supposed to exist
---
Why would they do this?!
---
If you go under recent players you can already do this. So assuming your system (mine being Xbox) is working with recent players (mine has a 2 hour delay lately so it isn't helping me) then that doesn't really change anything.
---
But we‚Äôd need like 10 independent sources who all have the same issue to prove it‚Äôs not hardware related or bad internet. Or hijinks. 
---
Hey, same. Check out us old gamers hijacking the thread.   
---
Three hour download. Pfft. The first 700mb movie i downloaded took literally a week. In the 90s, one mp3 took 20 minutes. ...once they invented mp3s. 
---
*Johnny Guitar intensifies*
---
That‚Äôs awesome, thank you.
---
In between Morgan town and grafton. Just west of the damn 
---
I wonder if it is stressful on the servers to have so many people hopping in and hopping out all over the place.
---
I don't know I never use them myself because it makes the game too easy
---
Feels like borderlands 
---
But his friend without a bounty can....
---
I am good now but someone in the future might be interested. Might as well share
---
So, I know where this is at. It's just east of Vault 76, just south of the North Kanawha Lookout. It's underneath a porch with a hot tub and weapons bench on it, but I can not get onto the porch. If anyone figures out a way, please let me know. 
---
Ah, I dont think you can join on randoms unless you add them as a friend. (Ps4) I could be mistaken, I hope I am.
---
I believe I ran into plenty of them while doing story missions near the Free States bunkers, in the upper-right / northwest corner of the map. I think Scorched use them. FWIW, they're a bit underpowered as compared to the hunting, and especially the lever action rifle, which unlocks at level 25, I believe. The LAR is very nice now that the animation for it is fixed, since you can 'cut off' the reloading to fire a quick shot or two to finish an enemy off. 
---
I found a Baseball Helmet
---
Does that count?
---
  Get the plans and build them.  I have had very few combat rifles drop, like almost none.  Same for handmade and lever action, guass and probably others.  It is stupid, but you have to get the plans and build them to scrap.  It is one of the many stupid oversites in the game they need to address.  I enjoy the game, but there is a lot of annoying not fun grinding.
---
Its part of a quest that starts at tygart water treatment plant (if we are talking about the same sensors).. Lv 150 and just now stumbled on that quest (again)
---
If I had the PC version I would've shown up. I'm so sorry for your loss.
---
server hoping right meow... so fun 
---
6 charisma and whisperer perks. ther eis fw video on youtube. but u can tame only special event mobs.
---
And everytime you manage to knock a enemy's head off, there's offscreen cheering from an offscreen audience
---
Na, drops arent shared. If it drops nothing its just the server being a nobhead and deciding you werent a participant in an enemies death, happens sometimes.
---
Its freaking terrible thats what it is a broken terrible mess :(
---
Would you be on tomorrow around 1 PM? I'm looking for a middleman on xbox to transfer my head y weapons and power armor to my BOS character that I'm starting
---
Damn,that 10 Years challenge hit your cat rough 
---
 lone wanderer is pretty powerful, seems reasonable.
---
Level 89 and still using All Rise (all hail the All Rise). Zealot's Super Sledge is a solid back up in the Bog, but really itching for a TSE.  
---
A higher level player must‚Äôve come before you. Leave, probably to another server, and try again. They should be your level, if not, repeat. Worked for me. 
---
***Is that someone who needs me to kick their ass?!?!?!***
---
My alt soloed easily lv50 Scorchbeast with a pipe autopistol at level 33 and lv80 SB at lv 40.
---
Silenced autopistols with sneak/VATS/crit build are strong enough to killing everything so easily.
---
My main weapon is rifles but I sometimes enjoy myself with a non-legendary 10mm autopistol. It takes a bit more time and ammo, but much fun!
---
Here's a sample clip using 10mm autopistol fighting SB.
---
[https://youtu.be/HLmnlVwqZ3I](https://youtu.be/HLmnlVwqZ3I)
---
You need better gerars and more optimized perks/mutations for revolers though.
---
What do you mean "how" ? 
---
Mind blown!
---
Yeah I built and scraped a few already, thanks üëç
---
5k ? Hahaha you have no ideas 
---
This consistantly happens to me, it's my main cause of death.
---
Good directions, will lead people right to it if you follow the steps. Thank you OP and GL wastelanders!
---
Pretty sure you did.
---
sadly very true 
---
I've tried to sell flamer ammo but didn't seem anyone was intrested in it. 
---
I dont fuckin know, I logged in and in the top right on the main menu it said you can carry toys for rad resist
---
 I miss it, but I think it is an engine limitation on item tracking. Kinggath had a podcast that talked a little bit about some of the limitations with things like that in FO4 and had solid speculation that those issues carried forward in the engine.
---
love how he turned himself into ash
---
There is a current repeatable quest (idk if it‚Äôs a daily, event, or what, I‚Äôve only had it come up a few times) for them. You have to do an unlocking quest before they start showing on the map. It‚Äôll have you got to a random air, water, and earth sensor (1 each). They‚Äôre scattered all over the map. It starts at a power station northeast of Charlestown- Poseidon Power Substation PX-02
---
[found the dungeon](https://i.imgur.com/DDpWylt.jpg) 
---
Agreed
---
Fallout 1 didn't have any legendary drops.   Neither did #2.  Legendary RNG grinding is a very recent addition that sets loot gambling above other gameplay systems.
---
Where is that extra bullet in the two shot rifle coming from?  Why doesn't it use extra ammo?  How does this minigun magically make regular ammo explode?
---
Other Bethesda games had unique weapons.  Other Fallouts had unique items.  #4 and #4.76 have obnoxious, mostly pointless, sometimes nonsensical legendary drops - and the gambler in me can't get enough of them.
---
It probably would be a better game without them.  My playtime with #4 was better when I ignored/hadn't found any.  We wouldn't be arguing about TSE this or furious that.  Combat would be about skill and cunning and combat prep and teamwork.  It would probably be much easier for Bethesda to balance combat too.  The other Fallouts managed!
---
If there was a non-legendary server, I'd be there.
---
I found a pride of kitts underneath a billboard on the top of a cliff. I believe it was a ‚Äúblue zip‚Äù billboard. The black one came too close and I got nervous and killed it thinking I‚Äôd get a -2 Luck status or something. Instant regret when I found I could loot its cotton yarn. 
---
Not saying that your experiences aren't real either, but I have also read from a lot of people whose experiences were similar to mine. 
---
I can't explain the differences but would suggest that some of them might have to do with the quality of various connections. 
---
Another prevalent theory is that some of the problem has been related to doopers. Maybe i've just been lucky enough to be on when they weren't that active. 
---
I don't think so, kinda sucks as it's one of the best handguns
---
goes to show how bad gunslingers have it
---
I will test this tonight on Xbox
---
You can still get attacked between the end of the first load and the end of the second load. So you're still just as vulnerable, but now it doesn't look as ugly.
---
Keep finding Overseer holotapes.
---
Oh yea. I would use this but not a single one of my xbox friends bought it on the console, might have to switch to pc.
---
PS4 Pro, Lutherminator, Game version 1.07.
---
-Tried to give stimpacks and stuff to a newbie. Dropped them to the floor but no bags appeared. So i lost loot, bullets, radaways, stimpacks, etc... (Happened before also)
---
-Same thing happened when i tried to give him stimpacks for free via the trade menu... (A first for me..)
---
-I still appear to get hurt for no reasons randomly. (No damages appear to be done however..)
---
-I still saw foes moving while being perfectly still. Like t-posing..
---
-I still see the occasional visual glitch. A lot less than before however..
---
-I still get dropped from servers.
---
-The inability to sell or recycle ammo infuriates me as much as the low stash limit of 600lbs...
---
I saw one, unless I've gone crazy. Spawned just northwest of the mansion from the Mistress of Mystery quests. There's a spawn point there, near some rocks, directly south of another manor and right near the 'lake shore'. Sometimes there's beavers there, sometimes mole rats, but I've seen cats at least once.
---
It sounds like you might be taking advantage of rifle/pistol double dipping on your pipe auto pistol, and I'm not going to spec into rifleman just to double dip when I am pretty sure it is a bug due for removal. 
---
Auto pistols might be OK, they sure as hell will see more procs from modern renegade.
---
It was in FO4, not sure about this one.
---
That's a hilarious solution. It doesn't delete the items but it also makes it frustrating for anyone who has those in their inventory to actually navigate their inventory.
---
Yo both of you are salty seadogs but i have to point out thats an absolute falacy. It not only destroys what little server stability we have but also skews anybody's ability to participate in PVP, one way or another it effects EVERYBODY.
---
I have the complete opposite on PC since the patch :/ . Load times doubled, then the load screen background goes black and white, then you load in and can't move around for 5-10 seconds.
---
Ok. Shit I might have it then but just never tried it on. I‚Äôve been to the museum and got the garb so I probably picked up the mask too. 
---
Hmmm you can build there? ( I cant bother to test)
---
On console I won't find it hard to believe that people would give great gear for free. I've heard duping was more common there and many had just given extras to anyone who wanted to take any.
---
I originally hated the idea. At first, it (Fo76) was described to me as the next Fallout game. All things considered, I've been playing the game since release solo and with my fiance and her fam. Sure it's buggy and some things don't make sense but we all love it now (especially me) and I consider it money well spent; so long as Bethesda keeps delivering timely updates.
---
I know you were being sarcastic, but you have to admit the timing of the hotfix was perfect with your post.
---
Handgun? You mean sniper rifle ;)
---
I have no idea what those posts were but relax. It'll be fine. We'll probably forget about you in a few days.
---
It will only get worse and worse.
---
This in my opinion was a pain in the ass. I ended up finding a few out of order and never finished because I don't even remember where the next might be.
---
It's confusing, so don't worry. It's not just you. 
---
haha yeah killing yourself by accident happens alot with tse weapons :')
---
&gt; "It gives you a 30% chance to double the scrap via Super Dooper." 
---
I'm 90% sure that this got patched out for bulking items. I've bulked a LOT of stuff and it hasn't procced anything like that for a few months now. It still procs regularly when I craft other things, like ammo and diluted stimpacks.
---
I agree!!! It‚Äôs so annoying. 
---
Rough numbers, lol.
---
haha, true. the little beast even has a suppressor.
---
I don't know where I would be without you guys haha. 
---
Same, looks much smoother on xbone.
---
Found mine at BoS vendor but that was on Xbox. 
---
Report it as either a bug or glitch on the official BGS site and move one? Could be either case but either case worth reporting.
---
On Xbox via the friends tab or under the Social tab on the main menu you can pull up recent players profile from there you can click "Join Game" even without adding them as a friend.
---
Oh neat, thanks
---
only thing that comes to mind is assassin's gear. or are you talking about a bug?
---
because there are ways around assassin.
---
Sorry for your loss. For what it's worth, you obviously gave that cat its best life.
---
Server hop for plans, see "Assualt rifle" every hop.
---
I found mine at Lewisburg station. Server hopped Grafton the other night with no luck. Went to Lewisburg and it was there waiting for me 
---
I wish!  I stopped using it because of that.  A little QOL fix would be nice, tone it down, it can be blinding with certain lighting conditions.  In 1st person you see your hands disappear.  What more do you need?
---
Yay I'm not alone! How do they keep breaking these seemingly random things? 
---
Relay Tower DP-B5-21, right above Uncanny Caverns....there is always a random energy weapon spawn just sitting on the shelf beside the monitors...literally server hopped twice and found my Gauss...
---
I had honestly completely forgotten about it up until now. it was a stupid idea from the get go.
---
Have you ever lived with a cat? Most of them cannot be tamed. Lol
---
Two-Shot Explosive. Two legendary modifiers.
---
Have you ever heard that eye bot wandering around with the human male sounding voice talking about the readings ?
---
I've found several two shots. 
---
My best weapon is explosive instigating(double damage againts 100% health enemy) western pistol. That pistol is pretty great and two shots are kinda bare minium for high level char.
---
I think the daisycutter I brought from vendor is pretty cool too, it's really light fatman so I can collect some mininukes and then go dish them out every now and then.(it's a quest reward someone sold to vendor)
---
Damn maybe itll pop up again in the future :/
---
While I don't want to spoil too much, you simply have to find all of her holotapes. They document her travels on a similar path as yours. They aren't difficult to find, as they are in the more important/significant places in the game. Some are a bit random, but if you explore, you'll find them all with ease. It's not a quest you should make a priority. You will get them when you get them--there's no major reward. They exist primarily for backstory purposes.
---
I literally shot him fifteen or so time with a great shotgun, got him to one health, would continue shooting and he would just ping back to 100%health. Not upset, it just caps. I have the video on ps4 saved. 
---
There 8s a such thing as a alligator  turtle
---
It sounds decent, just literally nobody does it. I remember before the game launched people said it would still have PVP and said I can do the hunter/hunted so they didn't need any more PVP. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if it works with melee, but the scorched at the airport especially, fly if shot before they unfreeze. 
---
Power armor. He just couldn‚Äôt die. 
---
r/ihadaseizure
---
ALWAYS forget, then 2 minutes after it happens I forget again... From full HP in my PA without Lone Wanderer it takes me down from 100% to \~30%.
---
&gt; I say ‚Äúpractically worthless‚Äù as an exaggeration to make the point that some type of nerf is needed with these weapons. It‚Äôs a shame that a lot of the cool weaponry is overshadowed by one legendary effect.
---
Ah, I understand. Some people have actually asked to have them actually be useless, which I view as a waste. I‚Äôve seen developers do this in the past, and be slow to fine tune. Glad to see you‚Äôre interested in real balancing.
---
Go to the space station
---
Drugs. All the drugs. (FYI if you continue this it‚Äôll be butchered as well; energy weapons are pretty shitty currently)
---
So this is why everyone told me to not go for Explosive effect when I was looking for Tesla Rifle as mass-tagging weapon. Imagine if it would still chain and make enemies explode :(
---
This is the kind of stuff that should be at the top of this sub. Not some suggests to fix problems that affect the small percentage of players or things that really wouldn‚Äôt improve the overall quality of the game.
---
powered gates; just got them 
---
It‚Äôs all about location I have a spot where nothing attack‚Äôs my base bc it‚Äôs impossible to get there without a jet pack and marsupial. 
---
Get ironclad perk it adds 10 dr and energy resistance per rank up to 50 . No power armor though
---
Marsupial was my first mutation when I hit level 20-ish on XB1. Got it when I was diving into those mines near the whitespring railroad station and got messed up with radiation from all the barrels. 
---
I had about five minutes to enjoy it. I loved it. Used the decontamination arches on the way out (I didn't know that both Radaway and the Decon arches removed mutations) and lost it. I was so heartbroken. 
---
Level 67 now with a level 15 alt, haven't picked up a single other mutation since somehow, and I don't have starched genes at all.
---
Disk Inventory X is the awesome Mac version, if anyone is curious 
---
https://i.imgur.com/bSOBgcZ.jpg
---
Damn that's nice &gt;&lt; then you're totally right it should just have the button.
---
I‚Äôve died only three times: once because of this, once for spawning in the middle of an attack by multiple Scorchbeasts, and once for thinking ‚Äúit‚Äôs only one little Yao Guai‚Äù not noticing Mother Bear behind me.
---
&gt;energy weapons are *really fucking* shitty currently
---
Fixed that for you.
---
I'd maybe redirect my aspirations OP.
---
its a daily quest
---
Well that's no fun, God damn bgs..
---
The looping price setting during trades is absolutely awful. I truly hope they can fix this quickly. When trading items frequently within a team, it takes so long to hit that 0 cap spot now that one tap makes it loop back up to 25k. 
---
I've got all/most of the upgrades for it. If you want to hit me up, my psn is Niveousangel and I'll upgrade it for you for free, provided you supply the mats. 
---
And where would that be I‚Äôm currently exploring the south west area of the map .  I also would like the clown mask but I haven‚Äôt come across that yet.  Are there any other cool head gear that u could point me towards.
---
If you keep it tracked the pips will pop up over boxes you missed when you get close enough to them. Not a perfect solution, but it helped me get the Camp McClintock one which is arguably the most important lol. 
---
power armor? my guess is that you're simply not outputting enough damage. what weapon are you using?
---
I have a PA build with 600 DR that mitigates about 80% damage but that's still not enough for pvp.
---
Well, the items already exist in the world, you're just moving them into your inventory.
---
I guess I could go high Christian and share perks
---
man o man if it still chained and somehow made those chained enemies explode this would be a monster, sadly not
---
no cause the bonus stops at 10 toys  so i doubt its this
---
It unequiped just goto armour and requip 
---
Many disconnects are server crashes so might not be anything to connect to
---
same here, I was so glad to finally have something that made whitespring a bit easier.
---
oh i know marsupial helps
---
Pre-update, I spawned in near Charleston, and kept taking a rads but no enemies in sight. Maybe 90 seconds later, the ghoul mob finally spawned in and it made sense. :/
---
come to your base and initiate pvp? its a trap
---
Put them on weapons, armor etc.
---
Or throw throw them in a lake. 
---
In the toxic valley there is a crashed space station. 8f you look on the map you can see it. And I like the fashnat mask too. It is at the BOS main base cant remember it name it's the asylum place
---
You can only share 1 perk card at a time right now... I‚Äôm petitioning for that to change too.
---
I‚Äôve gotten three of the machines from treasure maps.
---
It would be a monster yea, a beautiful monster to look at
---
They already do! 
---
It doesn't tame scorched anymore 
---
Jesussssssss
---
at the end of the video i jumped and still killed myself with it ahha :')
---
What‚Äôs the mod called? I try not to use mods but man it would be nice to know what‚Äôs taking up space
---
I tamed another player once. 
---
We get to choose if we go to camp. We don't get to choose when we get blue screened or disconnected from server. Also sometimes your camp may be getting attacked when you load in.
---
There is a Red Rocket south of Harpers Ferry that always has 3 higher level Combat Rifles.  One on the roof by the bed, and two by skeletons in the road, on both sides of the Jersey Barrier.  It also has an armor mod plan inside, a cap stash, a recipe plan, a Power Armor spawn, and a rare Excavator mod spawn.  Great place to hit every now and again.
---
Lol!! 
---
Sad days.
---
Yeah I use it to reconnect after a disconnect. But sadly a lot of people server hop and the recent players list lately is unreliable for me.
---
So unless you have a friend in the same server still or remember some rando's name off the map, it's useless for the time being. (last few days at least).
---
This is good to know, thank you for sharing.
---
I shot him to 1 health 15 or so times with full build for a two shot explosive combat shotgun. The damage registered, he just couldn‚Äôt be brought to less than one health it seemed. 
---
PS4 Pro here. 
---
The 1st time i logged in, i was at lvl1 and the game was apparently frozen. Then, 1 minute later, give or take, it crashed and reloaded with the correct level (43). Servers also disconnected twice. I played for about an hour max. However, game feels more responsive and performance really improved.
---
This song to m3 personally is the odd man out but ‚ÄúWouldn't It Be Nice‚Äù from The Beach Boys. Reminds me of my pops.
---
the servers remained just as bad before, during and after the pocketed/stash glitches.
---
so I'm just calling bs on Bethesda's part. not like it's anything new when it comes to them.
---
Not really, the perk kinda sucked. In fo4 it would let the enemies you tamed fight other enemies but now when you tame things all they do is sit there and do fucking nothing 
---
Right, sorry, I meant without the clipping -- the clipping just irritates me greatly.  Ideally, I want these things to be built in to something that costs real world money, so I'm still disappointed.
---
Sorry if it seems like I'm moving the goal post, it's not my intention.  Really, it's just bad communication on my part.
---
That is what I was hoping for!
---
So you need them in your inventory when crafting/ modifying?
---
Ping
---
2700 so far.....nothing good to spend it on.
---
Yeah but there also isn't any speech checks or anything serious enough worth save scumming in fo76 compared to previous games.
---
Sadly no had to move them to strength because heavy weapons are fun.  Picked up a furious .50 1 star but it makes me happy
---
That's the bastard
---
Soon as I get to a high enough level to confidently go into nuke zones they lower the exp from glowing ones? I think I'm done with this game.
---
You drilled a hole and ran the wire through it. 
---
I loved the Somerville Special from Morgantown airport quest.  
---
Nothing yet?
---
I feel the same way. Most multiplayer capable games are more fun when played cooperatively or solo, in my opinion.
---
I found it at harpers ferry twice
---
yes there is...what you described followed by watching someone in PA roll up to your corpse and wait for you to respawn and drop all your junk
---
Harpers ferry
---
He is in my prayers friend
---
The atom shop plans include a clean helmet
---
Same here, but I found a mouth harp in forest and I am wondering what the plan would be for that. 
---
Super mutants and/or scorched use them
---
Yeah he was just asking were you get the suit so I told him anyways
---
Commenting so I can find this thread again I‚Äôll hit you up sometime.
---
in your inv or stash. but when you do repairs the game uses scrap&gt;mods&gt;bulk in that order. so stashing a rare mod for later is pretty much a guarantee that you wills crap it by accident. rip 2nd jetpack
---
hint: there's armor that just as op. it's just that people here aren't very good at the game and love to complain about tses without having the full picture.
---
so ten wooden blocks and im gtg?
---
When I exit the power armor it shows back up. I've even tried to un equip and re equip in the power armor station. As well as logging out and back in.
---
If you look in your challenges (under the world category) there is the entry for finding the overseer's logs. It lists the ones you've found, and *possibly* the ones you haven't I say possibly because other categories show all entries with checkmarks next to the ones you've done, but I can't confirm it because mine have all been found, and the challenges are account-based, so they're all checked off even on my other characters. 
---
yup
---
Except the fame hasn't changed at all
---
Not for me. Three game still lags behind. Water not loading, environment not loading, weapons not loading, camp not loading, etc for about 20 seconds. 
---
Game still crashes for me as well. 
---
PvP? No I meant kill my sloth not me. 
---
Sorry if I didn't make that clear
---
How to you get it onto the weapon? I‚Äôve got a super sledge mod but whenever I go and try to add it, it never shows up and I know for a fact I‚Äôve got it either on me or in my box.
---
I use TSE's. My build is built to use them. It makes everything stupid easy. It has nothing to do with being good at the game. 
---
Great idea! Looking forward to more. 
---
Lmao dude thats called pvp, if you shoot a player anyone from his team can initiate pvp with you and since he was behind you thats why you died you didnt become wanted at any time
---
I've gotten a 10 exploding pistol recently and way back when I was around level 40 I found a two shot tesla rifle. Every other legendary I've found between the has been bad for me or the level is too low. 
---
I want to be able to store more then 600lbs of stuff and be able to recycle and sell ammo. I don't feel like putting them on the floor when i could just recycle those .38 as some .45 or whatever else..
---
Does this skin work with ultracite?
---
Finally passed through Harper's Ferry for the first time and was swarmed with super mutants. I nearly shit myself when I saw four seperate legendarys among them..
---
Only for each of them to scream in fear and run away as I hid behind a house with a sliver of health while I reload my crapy 10mm.
---
World full, but good luck! 
---
are you sure about that? because if they nerfed explosives further, the game would become extremely unbalanced because of said armor.
---
Yeah I got one earlier today at a nuked whitesprings 
---

My condolences I lost mine last year but she made it about 17 years. The last year was rough and she was going fast couldn't keep food down. Always indoors I let her out that last few months to enjoy the sunshine and sleep on the backyard bridge by pond. Then she just disappeared. I have nice pics of her laying on top my old school computer monitors that made nice warm beds
---
I absolutely agree. If you think about it, they had to patch the game because tse weapons were so OP. 
---
Honestly, I think they should just make explosive weapons function the same way they did in fallout 4 so they‚Äôre only really useful with the explosives perk and they don‚Äôt do extra damage per shot just for being explosive. I think this could lead to more diverse builds, not to mention making other legendaries no longer irrelevant

I was so looking forward to playing after the Jan\15 update, but the game is worse than ever. After trying Power Up Poseidon event, the game froze on transition when trying to enter the building 4 times in a row. 4 TIMES IN A ROW!
---
The caps slider when trading is broken now. When trying to set price to 0, it jumps up to 25000. 
---
Had another player, lvl 93, kill me with a single melee punch (I'm lvl 73, full health and in power armor). That kind of thing shouldn't happen. He\she was attempting to take my workshop. Tried respawning at a teammate, put me back at the workshop, still owned it and enemy player no where in sight.
---
These tips are for your benefit, Bethesda. I won't be playing much more, nor will I wait a free months for you to get your act together. You've lost me for good
---
6600k is miles ahead of an FX6350
---
no it doesnt exist yet , i want it too
---
&gt;It's on you and you're too ashamed to admit it
---
I don't think they really care
---
or maybe they just can't hear you over the explosions or cash going into their pockets
---
You may be right.  It's a habit, but I always open my pip-boy as soon as I load in.  Before the patch, it was a way for me to see if I was fully loaded into the game, as my hand would be invisible if I wasn't.  
---
Your processor is below minimum specs, look it up
---
*laughs in dense armor mod as I stand in the explosion*
---
:p
---
If he's like me he has the perk the Born Survivor perk that fires off a stimpack when your health gets low, with only level 1 of that perk it stims when you get down to 20% health once every 20 seconds so it may appear you are getting them down low but then they're bouncing back.
---
Could also have Medic Pump on power armor for a similar effect.
---
The fact it is getting low but you're seeing it refill instead of then dying seems to support it being one of these perfectly legitimate methods.
---
Believe me in what way? I shouldnt be able to jump around with a mutation and shoot the ground with a TSE shot gun and kill someone with some splash damage so ridiculously easy. One shot to the chest or head? That's fine, but the splash damage is just stupid. 
---
They had to roll out a patch because the weapons were so OP, and now that‚Äôs it‚Äôs patched, people are literally killing the Queen in less than 2 minutes. You can‚Äôt tell me that‚Äôs not too much, especially when everyone and their mother has a tse Weapon of some kind. 
---
Buddy of mine hasn't gotten the game yet and wants it. Might as well give it a shot on his behalf.
---
I absolutely loved waltzing through the wasteland listening to "The Wanderer" 
---
Then again "Johnny guitar" just has a special place in my heart /s
---
&gt;You'll notice, that my CPU exceeds the specs for their minimum CPU specs- It's a 6 core 4.5 Ghz CPU. Here is my response:
---
CPUs are way more complicated then Core count and frequency. The 6350 is actually below spec but as you said you are not even able to log in so I would recommend to contact the billings department through the support page. You might have more luck on a refund with them then with the Tech support.
---
All I know for sure is how the perks effect explosive weapons. 
---
Heavy gunner still increases the damage of the explosive minigun, however so does demolitions. The same goes for shotguns, rifles, pistols etc.
---
How this all applies to damage resistance, though, is a mystery to me. Considering we can't see hit point or resistance values of enemies on console it will remain so until we can get an inquisitive PC bro on it. 
---
tses can't kill the queen in less than a minute. they're exploiting duped bobbleheads which Bethesda, in its infinite wisdom, forgot to cap.
---
Oh yeah that's a bit different. I run rifle/shotgun so only once every couple hours for me.
---
I‚Äôm sure you do but do you have the gunsmith perk equipped?
---
Camden Park. Every run I‚Äôd get at least (2) from scorched.
---
I have 2* unyielding robot right arm; +1 agility, gain up to +3 to all stats when low health
---
Nuke it
---
I have had experience with non legendary protectrons exploding as well.  Rare but it does happen and their limbs were attached.
---
Working as intended.
---
Get rid of TSE and damage stacking bobbleheads.
---
No more bullshit oneshotting of Queens, and also partially gets rid of the duping incentive.
---
There is a cat that hangs around just west of the Gauley Mine.
---
Yeah irregardless I know people with playing on worse CPUs then mine and have no issues. The CPU isn't even the issue, because when I log-in I get a communication error. Grrr I'll try contacting billing as you suggest. Thanks. 
---
Jingle, Jangle, Jingle
---
Agree
---
I'm not sure I believe your statement that your complaint "has nothing to do with being good at the game" because you clearly don't know what you're talking about.
---
the game is so broken it balances itself out. if you nerf tses any further, people will be able to walk around and do whatever they want because they'll be literally invincible.
---
you think griefing is bad? imagine those people sporting fatmans and no fear of reprisals.
---

Same dude. I actually just started 76 back up again a few days ago after taking a good long break because of game issues. I got a level 40 Two Shot handmade with a +50% VATS Critical damage attribute as well. Made it to level 50 last night and have been spamming 5.56 ammo with super duper. 
---
No thanks
---
There's two spots:
---
1) just south of Abby's bunker, on the road. There's a bus strung up by giant vines. That's where I found my megasloth. 9 times out of 10 it's a Wendigo there, though.
---
2) is difficult to explain. YouTube 'Fallout 76 animal whisperer'. Two good spots.
---
I am all for casually calling the company "Beth"
---
seems endearing lol
---
yes, because I'm dying to make a build around my nocturnal rolling pin.
---
explosives may be op but most legendary prefixes plain suck and are of no use whatsoever.
---
I'd like you to describe what is worse, since you claim your fx6350 is above the minimum specs when clearly it's far far below.
---
You are correct, that's my bad not being up to date on modern CPUs. However, it isn't even a CPU issue I'm having, it's a log-in issue. 
---
I still dupe and I could care less 
---
Yup, my fault there. Not a CPU issue anyways but a communication error.
---

---
It's not useless if you want to share a rank 5 card (Gunsmith) at 15CHA.
---
He didn't say anything about whether the dead player would drop their junk so that's a bit of a stretch in your interpretation. I agree the implication is sort of there when he says murderers don't get anything, but he didn't mention junk at all.
---
Thank ya, I‚Äôll check it out. The main spots I check for them are under the rail bridge near treetops and just east of thunder mountain substation 2. Haven‚Äôt come across a lone lvl 91 yet. Plenty of lvl 21s and sloths tho. 
---
I think you misunderstand. I‚Äôm not speculating here. I routinely run with two friends, and she goes down before the clock hits 26 minutes. I‚Äôm pretty much just there for emotional support lol
---
**One random spawn of critkets or how to spell it is next to lake between vault 76 and that lumbermill with yellow robots. You can have squirtels, beavers, rabbits, cats,.... i do daily challenges there, maybe they are tamable there!**

What I'm wonder is if you start at the Nuka Cola factory does it give you a quest to go chain of key locations?
---
I'm pretty sure those kids were doing something they shouldn't in those woods and came up with that story.
---
Thanks. I worked on this bit for a while but really it needs a lot of work and others to add good content. 
---
Yeah, you can see in my second screenshot, I have the level 5 equipped. 
---
I bought it on ps4 a few days ago
---
Of course you don't. God forbid I put in the effort to find my own weapons armor or junk or whatever you're too lazy to find on your own
---
The people downvoting dont want the information commonly known so they can abuse the game even more
---
TSE weapons are supposed to be super rare so better IMO to just delete all stacked duplicates. So if you have 20,000 stacked TSE Handmades you are left with 1.  1000 bobbleheads...pop you now have 10.  100k ultracite...pop...500.
---
Whatever they do they need to do a ambush update. no notice no patch notes until all servers are down, so people cannot find a way around this.
---
this of course only works if all dupe methods are fixed.
---
Nope, the event caps out at 10 toys, or 50 rad resist, or completely useless.
---
Good to know 
---
So what's the new dupe method after patch?
---
Oh? As one well versed in Bird Law, i can tell you that isn't against the rules.
---
26 minutes is plenty to kill her though. with any weapon and a decent build. but you said 2 minutes previously. two, not twenty-six.
---
it's only possible to kill her in two minutes with duped bobbleheads and maybe melee if the ai is in your favor.
---
Don't really one shot everything with tse especially if your a nice person and not use demolition or only uae it at like rank 2. But I see the point your trying to make.
---
Yea np, its kinda a stupid thing of them to do but whatever
---
Yep transfer button then transfer button again then say yes to take all. Works like a charm.
---
did some testing with another friend, it wasn't bloodied explosive, but it was two shot explosive vats critical sneak attack, barely did any damage.
---
number 3 sounds like a great idea
---
My cat Ollie also passed. I should do this for him.
---
Condolences, love.
---
Do you have to carry them on you or can they be in your stash ?
---
Something about leaving all your duped stuff in a paper bag and going cliff diving naked
---
You have to carry 
---
&gt;using TSE to one shot event mobs so nobody can tag them? In bird culture, that's a dick move.
---
and that's wholly your problem. go blame Todd for making this mess always online.
---
That seems to be a pretty terrible excuse. Your sayings TSE'S are the only way you can kill people, then accuse me/anyone who wants to nerf this stuff at being bad at the game? TSEs are clearly the biggest balancing issue present right now. I would say you are the one that doesn't know what your talking about. Take 10 minutes and go through reddit, it's every few posts that someone is complaining about it. I use em, it's completely unbalanced and is the first nerf needed before any other. 
---
TSE'S can easily still be OP without the splash, you just have to be slightly better than depending on shooting the ground right? 
---
Also a few inside the Graham mining Hq building before you go down the stairs and inside 
---
‚ÄúBefore the clock his 26‚Äù 
---
Eg. When it‚Äôs still above the value of 26. So when when it ends around roughly 26:45, that‚Äôs just over 2 minutes 
---
I can play Just Cause 4 perfectly fine, which is a more demanding game than 76.  The CPU isn't EVEN the issue, it's a communication error.  They are just using the CPU as an excuse to not issue a freaking refund.
---
It was kind of a janky offering, but I that's nothing new in this era of pre-ordering. 
---
I do like the PA skin, but I'm not an energy weapon or hatchet guy so those others were wasted on me (funny cause I was wasted when I pre-ordered it). I've literally never crafted the suit or that scary Pip-Boy mask, yet I've collected as many other outfits as I can find.
---
tl;dr pretty sure they are available 
---
I shoot him with one health left and connect, it isn‚Äôt a perk or a build. This is an exploit. Note that he is also stationed with a friend who has a 3k bounty. They know what they are doing. He knows he cannot be killed. He doesn‚Äôt even bother shooting, just chases me down with melee. 
---

Sorry for your loss man, my almost 12 year old Boston Terrier has bone and lung cancer, his leg broke from the cancer a few months ago, though aside from being on 3 legs he was doing mostly OK. Sadly, right now he's by my side and starting to really struggle to breathe. 
---
I'm selfish and really want him with me for one more day, but he needs to go to the vet at this point because he put his head in my hands and I can see in his eyes that he's scared.
---
You on xbox? I'll come see it.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
If you use the jump keys (L2 and R2 and I think the plus pad on PS4) it jumps in increments making this less annoying.
---
&gt;Take 10 minutes and go through reddit, it's every few posts that someone is complaining about it.
---
EXACTLY. thank you. that's my point, this sub is all talk and people here *suck* at the game.
---
case in point: you think it'd be possible to kill people in endgame legendary gear if they nerfed tses further.
---
well yeah explosive is obviously the best
---
but im looking for something less OP but still spicy.
---
wished you keep some animals as pets, like house pets
---
I don't have PC so I can't join your server but I'll pay respects here. 
---
Contact them. Shouldn't she get a ban mail with the info to contact?
---
Yeah true BUT the old duping methods never crashed the server Bethesda just wanted to blame someone for the server crashes. The new one tho does crash the server.
---
then they're either exploiting bobbleheads or using melee. that's just how it is.
---
Lol, no biggie man.  I wasnt trying to be confrontational, just adding that RNG is RNG, maybe others who read it will see that sometimes you can get lucky and not ride the game off if they didnt find a weapon they loved early on.
---
At 35 I found a vampiric 40% attack speed baseball bat that made me switch from sniper to melee.  Sometimes you gotta change your build to roll with whatever weapons ya got.
---
Anyways if your on PS4, good luck out there maybe see you around.
---
Hey man, condolences I know how hard it can be losing family, and as bad as it may sound to some people the best advice is keep your chin up... and I don‚Äôt mean that in the normal sense I mean it as keep your head clear and be as strong as you think you can and don‚Äôt be afraid to seek help when you feel you can‚Äôt.
---
Stay strong my friend, but remember to cherish every moment and memory you have.
---
Your little homie will live forever in the vast memorial that is the nuclear wasteland.

She did and sent them an email. I planned on giving a call down there tomorrow as they are closed but how can we prove that it was all legit?
---
Yah so about where it was at from e3, that's the last I looked at it.  Does look good but looks really similar to destiny....which is both good and bad I suppose lol.
---
like investigating *insert aliens guy meme here*
---
I gave up on my first fall lol.  I did attempt though xD
---
Because they're imported into Appalachia.
---
It's been worse. I start to move after loading in and the game just freezes. Have to close out, load in again just to end up frozen. I see 2-3x the loading screens now. 
---
she ever partake in trades with strangers? bought something off the internet? maybe an unique equip she was proud of, like those owl masks?
---
there should be a higher chance of a 3star Legendary popping in the wild.  The only 3 stars i see are nuke zones or WS.
---
Only seen a hand full in the wild.
---
Theres 2 nuka dark at the nuka plant under vault 76 on map but u cant pick it up
---
She doesn‚Äôt have any crazy amounts of items aside from a good amount of ammo which was purchased. She has traded with random players but then again who has not? 
---
It would be cool to carry it around and use it everywhere on the map - The same with all the other instruments.
---

---
Nope, I learned my lesson hard in fallout 4 lol
---
They have been in the "hours" for me in the past.  So yeah, that sounds about normal I think.
---
The vendor at sunny top had lever action plans today... I didn‚Äôt have enough caps... 
---
shit man, if Beth was going to ban people for every unintended bug the player count would drop to 0 in an instant.
---
people are running around with millions of tses. it's fine.
---
They may have a way to look deeper. If she is innocent, they won't have proof. If they don't have proof, why is she banned? Ask questions like that.
---
Scrap the extra items in question?
---
Yeah the one instrument my partner and I were looking forward to having in our camp.
---
Yeah I was referring to this new one my bad 
---
Did u kill the glowing ones at least?
---
what should u do?
---
Not worry so much, sell the armor if u want, scrap it, keep it. Ur not gonna get banned. Unless u inadvertently created 50k copies of it, i wouldnt at all be concerned.
---
He did, just not directly. He said nothing but the satisfaction of griefing would be given for killing players via slap damage. Nothing includes junk. I also made sure to let everyone reading this know that there are other articles that specific junk, which I link you to if you really want but it should be one of the top links on google depending on what you search.
---
Anyway if they changed it at some point or whatever so that slap damage killers do get junk, I think they should change it at least until the bobble heads etc are fixed. Or fix everything that allows instant slap damage kills right now.
---
It's 11pm in the EST timezone
---
What do you do with a drunken hillbilly?
---
Exactly I‚Äôm not trying to come across the wrong way and not get get the correct service in the same breath but it‚Äôs pretty irritating to know that people can end up getting banned FOR LIFE off of a speculation. 
---
F**k the government! Free States!!!

You wouldnt be bannned if you did it on purpose.

He will still see the tag and hopefully can look into it for OP when he gets into work.

I just want the fucking BEEP BEEP shit to stop pls
---
Accidentally duping a set of power armor won't get you banned. If you really don't want or need it, just scrap the extra. 
---
This worries me as I've bought supplies at vendors sold by other players. Who's to know the source of these items.
---
I wouldn't worry too much since it is a one-time thing and not a massive repeated action. This has been reported pretty regularly as a glitch during regular actions.
---
If you really want to be on the safe side, submit a report or support request telling them how it happened. It will help them fix the bug before people abuse it and they will know it wasn't intentional.
---
The day? Like the date?
---

---
Yeah it's the 24th not the 23rd any more 
---
Saying people suck at the game as a solution to the discussion of TSE's being too OP is absurd. I mean, arguably, if you suck at the game your best bet is to use TSE's.....the nerf I suggested wouldn't affect someone that doesn't suck either. So, your really arguing for being able to just smash the ground with aoe damage from your TSE so you don't have to actually aim at anything. In that case, I don't think saying other people suck at the game is a good standpoint against the AOE nerf
---
Wait...  wait...

What if it homeruns a Scorchbeast...

---
Yeah but its true this new one should stop
---
Its not just hard. If you were in a large tribe you probably know that people are duping and and ddosong and meshing. Thats the kind of shit im talking about. You cant fight back against people who aggressively cheat at games. 
---
Dupe bans are apparently from people with super high amounts of crafted materials according to posts I've seen. If she doesn't have stupid amounts of anything, she should be fine.

Someone dm on how to get in the damn room on console. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about the games multiplayer nor do I care to go online and shit on people who want to play legit. I just want to access the room so I can take my own personal picture of the warning it gives you for entering to show my friends. Don‚Äôt care about the limitless amounts of scrap bs. 
---
let's put it this way: what if there was a set of armor so powerful that made you invincible *unless* you could [just smash the ground with aoe damage from your TSE]?
---
yeah? now you get it?
---
That‚Äôs how I feel. I have to worry about a player who I don‚Äôt know getting me banned? That seems messed up 
---
that cutting board lol :))
---
They should give us some more leeway with building and intersecting. I keep getting the error about part of the structure being inaccessible when trying to modify my current camp, but it's not the case at all.
---
Something is screwed with weapons crafting right now. Earlier, I broke my mutant ski sword, my go to weapon of choice. It wouldn't let me repair it. I had the materials, it kept saying you don't have the required skills to do that. I didn't think there was requirements to repair, but started trying my different stacks of crafting cards and kept trying. Finally, when I loaded up gunsmith level 5, it let me repair it. When did you need perks stacked to repair, and why would I need gunsmith to repaid a ski sword?
---
What do you get at the end?
---
We aren't killing the queen with TSE.   
---
:( I know. I looked but couldn‚Äôt find anything on it being a bugged or scrapped.
---
Bloodied and Mods on the Weapon, Adrenal Reaction, Talons/Twisted Muscles or both, Unyielding Armor all stack make my Powerfist/Super Sledge hit 3600 and 3500 respectively. 
---
It isn't based off a speculation. If anything they are running algorithms on logs that are looking for specific behaviors.
---
If she wasn't doing it, I would suspect the ban will get reversed and they will continue tweaking their algorithms to reduce false positives.
---
Either way, it's a sign that more ban waves are incoming, which I welcome since they really need to curb the "everybody is doing it and there will never be consequences" mentality that many people seem to have due to sheer ignorance.
---
I found a TSE MIRV today... never firing that again... holy sheet.

On a side note did you know it‚Äôs possible to blow yourself out of skybox... space is pretty.

Seen this a few times since the last patch. Maybe get more aluminium and then try again?

In no way shape or form is any armor issue even remotely close to as big of an issue as TSE's in pvp.

Because it has nothing to do with if you did or didnt cheat.

What pisses me off about the atom shop is the opposite, the fact that you can buy shit on the atom shop that you can just find in game. Like they‚Äôre charging $4-5(can‚Äôt remember exact amount) for the greaser outfit when I‚Äôve found like 10+ greaser outfits in my &lt;20 hours playing the game so far. If you‚Äôre going to have a fucking microtransaction shop full of cosmetics then put worthwhile shit in there not stuff I can just find easily out in the world
---
Correct but it directly correlates to the amount of things you could or could not have in the game. I.e. a level 2 shouldn‚Äôt have 1500 shotgun shells where as a level 150 that‚Äôs a common amount  
---
thank you for illustrating my point perfectly. no offense, but you just don't know enough about the game. you're jumping on the bandwagon, because that's what this sub does, complain about TSEs.
---
so don't make such silly assumptions.

Is this not fallout?  I should be able to nuke an entire town with one round.   Yeah, sorry, but that's what this game is all about.  Lol

We did it with GF, 30minutes for some atoms and some fun, worth it! But she closed game when we started doing weekly challenges and we both had to kill 30 robots with protest sign, I thought it would be fun, but they are lvl 1 and in flatwoods there are only 15robots.
---
I've had speed demon and lvl 3 class freak for a while now, and don't remember it doing this before the latest update. I had it tonight, HP down to 15-20, stimpaking like mad to try to come back, and the needle would just bounce around. Had to run away from the battle, get to where I could go to hidden, and let me regen mutation bring me back up. Stimpaks were useless today. 
---
Kinky
---
Yeah take nukes out of the game too.  Why kill things in one shot with massive explosions?? What is this?? Fallout or something?? Oh wait...
---
I also have this happening. Persists through server changes, I can‚Äôt get rid of it. 
---
The extra load screen feels glitchy sometimes on PC. After the first loading screen, sometimes you get a glitched frozen dark view of world then it changes to a frozen tooltip/photo loading screen with animated gear frozen and then it jumps to second loading screen (with gear), and then theres that third short 1 second or so fade in loading screen with animated Vault-Tec logo.
---
There‚Äôs nothing there except a note and some junk and aid items. Not worth it if it takes you more than twice 
---
I saw a cat once ........ saw it a second time on my grill
---
multiple times I just fall through
---
Would you be willing to trade your sloth for 10 noodle cups? I have the perk.
---
You can look at your challenges to see which holotapes you dont have yet.
---
And iirc even if you 100% the current game that quest stays possibly for dlc related things.
---
My FO4 fatality rate was 95% my own explosive shotgun, 4% enemy grenades/missiles, 1% wtf!
---
"Only 2000 atoms for Salisbury steak add on"
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs not level-protected like the handmade plans are? Anyway, I got my lever action plans a while ago, and I think I have all the mods now. Too bad there‚Äôs no ultra-rare two-shot mod to scrap for...
---
Seeing how many ultracite explosive vent plans I can carry before my character gets crushed from the weight.
---
Trying to collect plans, its pretty lame that youre basically forced to endlessly server hop. Related, revisiting less visited locations to find plans that arent always taken. Found two places that always seems to have a mod (of course, its the 100th time ive seen "shadowed robot chest")
---
Testing out perk cards to max damage output, really enjoying using a nearly full set of unyielding armor, was getting tired of slogging around in PA.
---
This thread is lit 
---
This is the comments I was looking for.
---
I've crashed 4 times, once i had to hard reset after it spawned me with a black screen.
---
10/10 will be playing tomorrow. ps4 btw
---
I ended up using "switched power pylon large". Did the same as you. Power to switch to garage. Works up and down
---
We are in simulation, you didn't know?
---
That article is simply misquoting him. Listen to the actual video embedded in every one of those articles. He says "you get no caps, no XP, you get nothing". He doesn't specifically say loot or junk.
---
So yeah if you quote words he didn't say, sure...
---
Happened to me once before too. The server crashed on me while I was in my Ultracite PA and when I logged back on I had a second set that stacked on it. It vanished after I recalled to my inventory though. They're only banning people that exploit it, so I wouldn't worry about it. If you still have the second set either just scrap it down or drop it in an out of the way place where it won't be found until it despawns.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 3 weeks lvl 36, and I never see anyone else. Way across the map 10-15 people but never play with anyone. All my friends refuse to play 76. I‚Äôve not met one griefer yet. 
---
Now they are coming to find my camp and level it 
---
Started reading the title and thought it would be another one of the assholely post about "how to piss off everyone on a server and justify it to yourself by claiming to be killing dupers, all the while stealing and using their stuff and hypocritically profiting off their use of exploits."
---
I was pleasantly surprised to finish reading just the title and to find out that this was gonna be a wholesome post that's actually worth reading, and believe me, it was a fantastic post. If the bride and groom read this, congratulations! Great idea, and I think my wife and I will get married in the game too. If only there were rings in the game like there were in FO4 (90% sure I remember there being wedding rings in it).
---
You sure its not damage reduction armor and talents?
---
Same here, only LVL 27 but I'm starting to meet new people who play regularly and am learning some mechanics behind the game. This game is awesome. Not any major issues so far. The only thing is the social aspect doesn't always work. Was trying to invite my brother to the team and no matter what we could not get it to work. However it seems to be fixed now.
---
Came to the thread to comment about mxrmods. Not disappointed.
---
If you're not switching loadouts mid-fight you aren't living
---
Yah from what I can tell its roughly based on amount of ammo fired.  Guns like my legendary ts flamer break in about 2 mins flat.  Gatling guns break after 2 cores or so.  Even running the talent to fix weapons on hit doesnt help.  Gatling gun is the most usable heavy I think, get through 3 full clips before repair with gunsmith and that talent that repairs.
---
Does she know da wey?
---
Awww, I was hoping to be the Nameless King in DS3, using Tesla Rifle lightening people.
---
The other articles are misquoting what he says if you watch the actual video... So there's that.
---
I agree he said "you get nothing" which does imply no loot but it definitely wasn't specified so I don't necessarily think it is a bug.
---
Yes. I watched the replay. His health goes to zero, I continue to shoot him with the same one shot weapon. He just doesn‚Äôt die. 
---
Still same for me, i cant defend myself for 30 seconds and i hv to hope no ememies where i spawn
---
Thats cruel
---
Correct
---
I dont want to set the world on fire. 
---
I have a copy, but my girlfriend doesn't. 
---
We would love to play together. 
---
I know 
---
Thanks
---
I hate this course with every fiber of my being.
---
They‚Äôre technically still correct. The best kind of correct. 
---
And Nuka Cola, Cherry, and Quantum arent?
---
Good for him, and kudos to you for sharing.  I admit I get a little tse Cshotty happy in nukasprings...but I go out of my way during UF to make sure all participants get a tag in...I agree it‚Äôs good manners and etiquette 
---
Oh lord did the last patch fuck it up?
---
Try and see if you can craft at a public bench.
---
I encountered a situation earlier where it wouldn‚Äôt let me craft a Lv.50 pipe pistol. Switching servers and restarting didn‚Äôt help, but when I was at Camp McClintock‚Äôs Weapon Bench, I decided to take a look at it was available.
---
I hopped back to my C.A.M.P. and it was also now available.
---
Might not be the same bug but might be worth a try. 
---
‚ÄúTriple A‚Äù and ‚ÄúBethesda‚Äù in the same sentence LOL
---
Lvl108 why? And yes I am Xbox. Not on until tomorrow.
---
The only thing that breaks faster than both the flamer and cryolator is the plasma gatling. So even if you get enough ammo to reload it twice itll be broken on the third reload. And thats with gunsmith 5.
---
That's what people have said for every duping exploit and for the carry weight exploits and staff exploits. When are we just going to admit that Bethesdas servers are just fucking dogshit. I love this game but seriously servers have gotten worse on PC for every update
---
To me this looks like an experiment and they didn't want to create an OP 'sploit.Ôªø
---
I thought my buddy was just joking around and being a jerk when he tried to sell me 1000 rounds of 5.56 for 25k **per round**! Lol. Most expensive ammo ever.
---
Probably has a secondary character that this guy doesn‚Äôt know about. 
---
pacifist doesn't affect the damage dealt to you. it only nulifies the damage *you* deal to other players.
---
and to answer your question, duped bobbleheads. Bethesda unsurprisingly forgot to cap how many you can pop at a time.
---
Aw, I was hoping for some unique loot. 
---
It's 11:50, this post is fake news.
---
That's because a Knight wrote it, not a Scribe.
---
Rare is an understatement where over 300 combines levels of playing with most of that legendary hunting I have never seen a TSE or sentinel armor piece yet.  While someone else I've seen get that at \~level 30.  
---
If they address the drop weights to make it guaranteed for everybody to see them within a given upper range of levels then I am ok with that.  But otherwise you end up with the few that will troll the many and that's a immediate way to lose me as a support of this game and reoccurring paying customer of spending money on atoms. 
---
So if they want to lose a fan/supporter/reoccurring money source than that's their choice.  'It's mean to be rare' only goes so far as a statement that holds itself up the way this game is designed. 
---
I was wondering if it was level-locked like the handmade plans.
---
Camo McLintock was not good to me. The one where you have to shoot the targets in under a certain time. When shooting at the targets it does not register this failing everytime. Poop. Might give it another shot on the weekend 
---
Why is there some weird delusion going around that pacifist makes you immune to PvP? It just means you can't damage other players.
---
If he became wanted, he was high on bobbleheads, if not, unless you stole the workshop and became wanted yourself, then you're free to kill, other than that, I have no idea.
---
Haha!  I was playing my non PA toon tonight and killed some robots in watoga...boom.  I was like wtf?  Never hurt me in PA but killed my poor pistol normal armor guy üòÇ
---
I‚Äôve liked it. I had been running mainly a heavy build too. 
---
One sticking point though:  why isn‚Äôt the Auto Grenade Launcher considered a heavy gun?  The missile launcher and Fat Man are, but not the AGL?
---
You are not allowed to use peoples IGNs on this reddit. Id suggest redacting this post.
---
They seriously removed this post?
---
I think if more knew about it and were into pvp it would be well received. 
---
Yeah I think the window bars are missing collisions for that window, happened to me as well.
---
Wow sorry for triggering you over your TSE, sheesh. My assumption is that It's probably going to get nerfed, as it should but hopefully only an AOE nerf. I'm sorry you depend on shooting at the ground to kill people from the sounds of it. And I am not jumping on any bandwagon, it's certainly possible I've put more hours into the game than you have. 
---
When I first saw that it reminded me of that scene from Better Off Dead:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScbNp0-bvGU
---
Since Patch today I get disconnected constantly.   Sometimes before even full load into the game, often within 15 minutes.  Over 20 disconnects, mostly blue screen crashes since 6 hours ago.
---
System: PS4 classic
---
Level: 132
---
Character: H3adshotfox77
---
Yeah I think they might have. But I understand why, since I think I did break 1 rule and another seems slightly iffy. I just wish they had said anything to me about it.
---
I didn't know the gun was loaded.   ...And I'll never ever do it again.   Hilarious!
---
I went to buy one a few days ago. Guy was completely unashamed at being a duper. Showed over 50k of the gun in his inventory. Didn‚Äôt even try to hide it. 
---
Sniper unarmed? How does that work?
---
look, I'll simplify it as much as I can for you:
---
&gt;In no way shape or form is any armor issue even remotely close to as big of an issue as TSE's in pvp.
---
you see this sentence? you typed it out. it's wrong.
---
There's a huge lack of decoration in general. My camps end up being small and lame simply because if they're big they look empty and ugly.
---
I guess it could be worthwhile using for armor since no other armor directly effects their damage reducing stats without also being conditional. Though I did have have the numbers backwards it was actually 33% less during the day and 50% more at night (and then 100% for a very short time around midnight which would require more luck than anything for it to occur when yo really need it).
---
Swarm of Suitors often refuses to progress past the "one player must reach the island" step. Sometimes works though. Not sure on the causality.
---
Yeah the vault head one does.
---
I didn‚Äôt steal the workshop, it was unclaimed.  
---
They are trash for that. Just go to different vendor?
---
Yes, and now how do I recharge them? I had no idea it was a bug.
---
Gotta chatchem all
---
How about letting me sort by limb, or food type (meats, liquids, Chems, etc.). FFS.
---
Slow clap
---
Ok tough guy
---
I am not that high level, only 125 but I have definitely noticed lower levels being hesitant around me.
---
This is exactly how I operate though, I'll tank for the lower levels and make sure they get hits and don't take too much damage. I drop materials and supplies and if I can get on the mic I'll usually ask if they need anything.
---
It adds more complexity to the play even because you're not just worrying about hacking and whacking and slashing or mowing down the baddies, you also have to keep tabs on your "buddies".
---
I don't team up but use emotes and most of the time, if I'm in an area for a while I end up with some lower level "followers". 
---
Yea they really need to fix your own turrents attacking you, talk about super pet peeve as it's a drag to go store them, then have some damn rad rat come by an wreck my base while I'm away exploring. 
---
The only way to know for certain it isn't duped is to find it yourself. Even if someone shared video of them finding the weapon, you couldn't be sure they didn't dupe it after that.
---
I'm newer to the game, can someone tell me what TSE is?
---
This looks like some good action.
---
5 vendors are unique and not shared
---
Thanks! I have not yet known the pleasures of a TSE weapon, but I can imagine it's difficult to not do what it does best and joyfully decimate the enemy. Glad to hear youre mindful of others üçª
---
I have to agree, I am a rifle build but found a level 35 explosive double barrel and even without putting a single perk into shotguns it is the most powerful gun I have by far, no contest. They are way to overpowered I don't care what anyone says. A non modded, non specced, lvl 35 shotgun should not be exponentially more powerful than a decked out rifle with full perks supporting it. Hell it's better at sniping with iron sights than a sniper rifle, even with the sniper using vats and a critical headshot. Why can I snipe people from 300 yards with a sawed off shotgun, why!?
---
Honestly pacifist mode should make you immune to PVP because if your in pacifist mode it means you don‚Äôt want to participate in PVP. It defeats the purpose if people can kill you while in that mode. 
---
Either Bethesda needs to make PVP servers or they need to make people who select pacifist immune to player attacks and ineligible to attack players. Like in GTA. 
---
The intro song to fallout 4 when you are at the main screen that song gives me goosebumps! I‚Äôm new to fallout bought fallout 3 new Vegas and 4 for my Xbox one s hell I bought an Xbox one s just for fallout. I‚Äôm really looking to play fallout 76 but just haven‚Äôt had enough extra cash.
---
I know da wey
---
Don‚Äôt worry mate, I‚Äôve done it twice to completion and it doesn‚Äôt even award you anything
---
Pat on the head, you did it. Good job, here‚Äôs no xp and no rewards; now get the fuck out my swamp
---
Impossible to know if it's been duped unless you find one yourself. 
---
The only non-duped ones you'll find right now will be Hunting Rifles (If one has even been found yet on your particular system), however a new dupe glitch is slowly getting out there.
---
Reality is, the duped ones work just the same as the non-duped ones, and a ban for everyone that has one at this point would cripple the games population (and people available to purchase micro-transactions). I wouldn't overthink it.
---
I bought a few yesterday from some guy. He sold me a 2 TSE 10mm and a TSE 50 cal. For 135 caps. He did not tell me they were duped and I have no idea. 
---
Best way is to find them yourself. 
---
Kill him. 
---
In time I‚Äôm sure 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs happened to me sucks ass 
---
Only 2k?
---
After farming flux and steel I could easily make that much UC .50 ammo in a single setting, not counting what I was already carrying. If that‚Äôs the cut off, no one is safe, especially those of us who use ammo hungry weapons. 
---
It‚Äôs paint sorry conspiracies 
---
There are quite a few threads in this sub with tips and tricks as well as out on the web. Search and ye shall be rewarded.
---
I don‚Äôt understand cheaters in this game. You have to wonder if this guy/gal has such a shitty existence in real life that they have to cheat in a buggy video game just to feel some sense of accomplishment.
---
You mean paddle ;)
---
Sounds like my FO4 character after I found a two shot fatman.
---
Shit was his gt
---
Officers sword, some black powder weapons and and officers coat.
---
Buy them from other players is the only other way sadly. 210/300 myself.
---
Jet Pack is a Myth
---
Meh.   There are actually 2 easy solutions to dupers and cheaters
---
Ban them all as many times as needed or Create cheater servers and once flagged they can only play with other cheaters.   
---
I'm sorry but I can't decide between rocket 69 or the lone wanderer
---
Yeah she was around 2600 total idk if bethesda considered that to be HIGH RATE OF A DUPLICATING item ?
---
sorry, can't relate, don't have TSE
---
Absolutely. I‚Äôve played, I dunno, 5 or 600 hours and when I remember, I wait. And sometimes one standing there for what feels like 30 seconds and nothing, I walk forward and then tick tick tick BOOM. It‚Äôs ridiculous. 
---
That cat looks like the German Shepard version of the painting in Charley‚Äôs apartment from IASIP
---
Incidentally immediately after posting this I had someone come by and reward me for my efforts. [https://youtu.be/IFrugEEpgoU](https://youtu.be/IFrugEEpgoU) (mind the garbage Pandora music). To the stranger that made my attempts worth something, thank you!
---
No lie, how TF did they manage this? Is there like a separate outdated code branch they used for the patch and merged that had this crap broken?
---
Can someone explain to me why people dropped all their duped stuff before the update? Did the update ban players with duped items?
---
The game really should have stayed in development for half a year longer with an extensive beta.
---
Mine is more of an x-ray image or black screen with gold blobs that looks like it's frozen and about to crash then poof I'm in game.
---
That would make a good music cover image for Bethesda if there ever were a heavy metal release of fallout songs 
---
I mostly get attacked by wolves and mongrels so the six basic turrets I use are generally enough to destroy them. The only time I had some trouble was when someone lead a lv 50 Mr. Gutsy to my CAMP. 
---
Stacked bobbleheads.
---
Needs to be nerfed to 1
---
Until you play the game long enough to only have the never ending "Follow the Overseers Journey" and "Kill a Wendigo while wearing a clown outfit" missions on the screen....
---
I just want my photos on the loading screen all the time :P
---
We live together so yeah he would know if I had a second character which I don‚Äôt btw 
---
/ agree, at the least we need a turkey baster and a snorkel!
---
I think the name is misleading.  It definitely causes confusion.  Instead of ‚ÄúPacifist‚Äù it should be ‚ÄúDo you wish to play PvP? Yes or No‚Äù And when you claim a workshop the message should say something like ‚ÄúPvP will be engaged in the Workshop area for the remainder of the session or until you are killed.‚Äù Or something like that.
---
I would like to note that if you have a mutation, Rad-X will suppress it, but the diluted version will not. So for those who rely on their various mutations as part of their builds, they may find it more useful to dilute their Rad-X supply down before using.
---
Also, Starched Genes is a luck perk available starting at level 30ish (or was it 20) that lets you hold onto mutations, or prevents you from getting them. It takes two points total to get so level up luck once and grab the card a second time after putting a point elsewhere if you need to. It can be very helpful if you decide you like a certain mutation and want to keep it, or your first Rad-Away will likely cure it.
---
Not everyone duped becasue of bobbleheads and weapons.  Some did it for junk and ammo
---
I wish this didn't have the PA clause attached to it. Ive slowly transitioned away from using power armor to running around in BoS combat armor. The only time I'm ever in power armour is for queen fights to get that extra damage pen or to get into random spots with my jet pack but that's beside the point. 
---
&gt; crying about revoked keys
---
care to link even one thread?
---
Thanks for answering with out stating just the obvious, I‚Äôve lucked out and got a decent nocturnal explosive handmade and an anti armour shotgun 
---
Well I mean even dupers have to get the weapon originally somehow so they do drop haha. 
---
Same boat, went from almost never to non-stop CTD's
---
I was just having a lot of FPS problems after the update (X1X). Did a full restart of the console and the lag and glitches stopped. Maybe try that and see if it improves.
---
I met him thanks to r/fo76bazaar so I won‚Äôt repeat it.   But yeah. Didn‚Äôt even try to hide it.  When I went to buy he said I had to fast travel to him because he was over encumbered.  No shit. You‚Äôve got like 1M pounds of guns in your inventory.
---
&lt;3
---
It was double dipping from both heavy weapon cards and demolition expert. So they took the easy route and limited it to demo expert.
---
I killed one in Watoga today that immediately exploded when it died. Like, I punched it a few times, and at the same time I got the exp "ching", I got blown to hell in a nuke blast
---
Yeah probably comes down to if they farm white springs or not. I made it to level 50 something at launch and never saw an explosive weapon. Did get a 2shot dragon though 
---
&gt;*because we all know your game can‚Äôt function for some reason when your inventory has too much stuff in it* 
---
Incorrect. Some friends and I spent an entire day duping over 500,000 carry weight of things. Game was stable and there were no issues. Now, we can actually play and enjoy the game, for the most part since this game is absolute shit, because we have stuff to survive with now. Bethesda made the thirst and food degeneration too high to be able to enjoy the game for more than 15 mins at a time
---
I have not violated any rules. I am not giving out any personal info. I mentioned a PSN ID( which is publicly visible). I am in no way attacking anyone personally, just recounting my experience in the hopes that it may be avoided by others when possible. 
---
I don‚Äôt think so. I was in the process of converting the cards to digital files just so I could print up a set for my self. 
---
Can you dense up my combat armour as well please?
---
Must have not had a duper with millions of items in their inventory
---
Hope all goes well. I think im gonna take a break till first major content rebalance patch at this point. I need at least 200 more stash to do the build i want.
---
Kills me how uninformed people still are about PVP.  If you have a workshop and someone starts to take it over it flags you both for PVP regardless of pacifist settings.  What he most likely did was see you owned the workshop, found you on the map, started the capture, and then fast traveled over to you for the kill.  
---
Strong would say im Weakling if use TSE and he would Dislike it..
---
I prefer to smash things in Melee,, i've had one 1* two shot ultracite lazer and thats my ranged hitter,, i have 1* prime beserk wetern revolver and a 1* Anti armour axe.. And the Blade of Bastet.
---
Never had a TSE or explosive drop... Don't need it.
---
Nothing against TSE users your good to have as an ally but if you shoot at me with a TSE i will think in a Supermutant voice " Stupid Weakling ".
---
Maybe with the next update.  
---
I've done it with my group that I play with. All 4 of us queued and it started after giving a couple minutes to prepare. So how it works is you get a giant circle. About as big as a nuke circle to find your "target" there is also beeps to tell you how close you are. You have no way of telling who is after you or where they are. Only where your target is. You drop do not drop your junk when you die! ( Or at least my people didnt when j killed them ) 
---
It was pretty intense. 10/10. From me. More people should do it. 
---
same here on xb1
---
Which I don‚Äôt buy because it‚Äôs not affected by Bear Arms but the Fat Man and Missile Launcher are and take their damage increases from demo expert instead of heavy guns (which specifically says its applies to non-explosive heavies). 
---
So by reading this whoopsies you get from diseased scorched ants while doing the queen. Swamp gas from diseased bloatflies.
---
When they stopped posting I [started doing my own monthly roundup..](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab9i2i/bugs_observed_issues_list_including_multiple/)
---
My condolences for your loss. 
---
I like to think that Admiral Anderson from Mass Effect said it best: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjJPFWAtG4I
---
I just finished this today in the AM. I legitimately got tired of waiting for them after reaching the island so I jumped into the lake (in my power armor) and walked to the spawn area to chase them down. They didn't move towards the island. I agree that a lot of the events are bugged. It seems like the triggers for these events are not working properly. So if you don't trigger it in just the right way, the event cannot be finished. Luckily me going over to them didn't screw up the event.
---
They did not expect that someone will play their MMO so long
---
Try putting all your materials in your stash. I've been having issues with that bug and stashing my materials solved my issue.
---
I completely agree with your thoughts on "keeping tabs on your buddies". My main is only lvl 67,  but have been here since beta. I've enjoyed going to events in the forest to help some fresh faced dwellers complete without sinking what little resources they have. It's fun to look after a "flock" while in combat.
---
First time someone did this to me I just killed them with slap damage.
---
Can confirm this is inaccurate. Some friends and I duped like 500,000 and never had problems 
---
Honestly, the number of "issues" that are still in the game from FO4 is embarrassing.  I'm actually embarrassed that I have allowed myself to continue to play the game.... I just love the FO world.
---
Some big game online magazine should do a "shame on you Bethesda" article about the amount of "issues" that are still in the game from FO4 that modders fixed years ago 
---
Yes officer, it was this post here. 
---
The first week of streaming this I don't remember how many times I said, "This is where I would normally Quicksave."
---
Are you seriously trying to bribe redditors into liking you?
---
It seems the amount of caps you lose equal to your current level and the amount of caps you win are the other player's level. This doesn't include bounties.
---
Made a pretty terrific profit running around with a 50 cap bounty and repeatedly killing the level 120 guy coming after me. 
---
This is definitely a good idea. I spend a lot of time just flipping through my items to see what I can drop to reduce weight.
---
The mod itself is pretty cool, but it's risky, so it'd be nice to have this as an actual feature.
---
Most likely wrong.  He had a workshop which produces the same effect to players ignorant of the PVP system.  
---
Sorry to hear that, friend.  I am glad you had something to share with your father during his last days with you.
---
This is so annoying. It's just awful when it starts off slow, then speeds down and flies past the start. Then I have to do it again, and again, trying to be careful and slow to not pass the start again.
---
Also awful when trying to trade and give something for 0. Get to 0 and accidentally go past, and it's 25k and a nightmare to get back down. I have to back out of that item and try again.
---
I highly doubt it was about the ammo. Anyone who uses an LMG has to have obscene amounts as it burns through it ridiculously quick. 
---
My guess, they‚Äôre looking at a pattern of trading or a large number of particular crafting items in the stash, like having 2k wood (one of the duping methods requires you to make an obscene amount of boards).  Most people would dump the wood or bulk and sell it before they got that high. Is that a fair way to do it?  Of course not, but my guess is they‚Äôre not looking at ammo. 
---
If she upset someone it‚Äôs also possible she could have been improperly reported out of spite. Bethesda has a report system in the support ticket system for reporting cheating/griefing players. 
---
=X
---
So it‚Äôs basically ‚Äûthe ship‚Äú gameplay or ‚Äûassassins creed‚Äú pvp 
---
Stealing a workshop does not make you wanted.....starting a capture flags both yourself and the owner for PVP.   This was most likely not bobbleheads but an intelligent player taking advantage of how workshops work.  
---
Seriously, he can do that? I thought it was limited to the workshop space. I honestly had no idea it covered the whole map.
---
I only claimed the workshop for plans and to set up a few generators for random folks to grab stuff if they wanted it.  I guess I‚Äôll stop doing that. Oh well, live and learn.
---
You ballin! I like the different flooring.
---
Morpheus was right...lord oh lord why didnt i take the BLUE pill!
---
Don't forget about the father/gf/bf/uncle/pet who you loved to play with that died tragically.
---
Granted - but then while in pacifist mode you are not allowed to claim workshops.  THEY ARE PVP ZONES FFS!  When the PVP mode does come out the "normal" version of the game is most likely going to carry over the same rules for workshops given you are consenting to PVP by taking one.  
---
&gt;Most likely wrong.  He had a workshop which produces the same effect to players ignorant of the PVP system.
---
Nice, thx!
---
Spot on...maybe even a sibling who left for college or the military and used to play Tetris with the OP.
---
There‚Äôs some stuff on YouTube. Older stuff they all call it the West Virginia monster or the Braxton county monster. Hopefully the show you‚Äôre referring to can give some updates to it.

6 dollars for a completely clean clown suit. So, its if you REALLY want a clean clown suit /shrug

Big Iron used to be my favourite, but I have to give it to Country Roads, come on, it fits the setting perfectly. Now, I already have a copy, but it‚Äôll be for a friend.
---
Now for the lyrics!
---
Almost heaven, West Virginia
---
Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah river
---
Life is old there, older than the trees
---
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
---
Country roads, take me home
---
To the place I belong
---
West Virginia
---
Mountain mamma, take me home
---
Country roads
---
All my memories, gather round her
---
Modest lady, stranger to blue water
---
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
---
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
---
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
---
Radio reminds me of my home far away
---
Driving down the road I get a feeling
---
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
---
Take me home, down country roads
---
I just died because I rounded a corner as one exploded from someone else killing it. They got a legendary and my loot...
---
I‚Äôm sure that could play a factor we have a few players who get mad because the loose a round of pvp. But she had no crazy amounts of anything. I was trading her a set of armor when her game glitched out and then she was banned upon disconnecting. Maybe the disconnect did something? I have no idea but I know she has never duped anything 
---
In theory yah, in reality tho.  If they are not already using unique identifiers (an assumption btw) then adding those in would add substainally more items for the servers to track.  The servers are already unstable because they struggle to track the current item load....additionally load would make the game even more unplayable.  
---
Fixing one thing often breaks another, comeon reality.
---
Aid? You mean RAID!
---
Pc?
---
Ps?
---
Toaster?
---
That's not the AFK timer, that's just how long a game session lasts these days before the servers shit themselves.
---
So annoying!!! Was enjoying this new feature for a while tonight. This game is kind of like that episode of The Simpsons where every time Homer learns something new he forgets something he used to know.
---
Yes - it covers the entire map and lasts quite awhile but not forever.  If you take a workshop never go to your camp.  The only way remotely around this is to block everyone on your server every so often so no one can see your location on the map.  
---
And I, a LV 170 shall steal all I see! Hahaha the noobs will fend for themselves out there and I'll be collecting their sweet, brown paper bags!
---
Honestly looking for a solid team also, lvl 36 w/mic PSN: TBQuayvo. I play daily would like create a settlement if anyone is interested. 
---
Same issue, go through and upvote everyone with it please for visibility. 
---
Thanks! Looking at the pictures now compared to being in game it feels like they don't really do a great job at capturing it as a whole.  To me it looks a lot better in game, but it's the only way I can share it right now.
---
My base is north of white spring if anyone get owned. Feel free to load up and kick ass. Ps4
---
If this is true I will pay him to send me Allen‚Äôs pineapple lolli‚Äôs best damn thing on the planet
---
I had Breach and Clear screw up this morning. The machine came out and the event progressed as normal, but every box was empty. I didn‚Äôt get anything other than what I got off the spawned mole miners. 
---
Peace brother.
---
Im not sure. I know that the pipboy thing triggered it for me 5/6 tries. I wasn't overencumbered any time that it's happened so far. That may also be a trigger so I'll test that out when i get off work.
---
They wouldn't be worth anything in the traditional sense. They wouldn't be for sale for caps at all. They would only be traded very very rarely, if at all, for other extremely rare items or TSEs. 
---
Thats why i don't have a problem with duping. Its just random who would have gotten these god weapons. Nothing to do with skill or even time invested. RNG only. Im level 110 and only ever hit 2 shot twice. Only as 1 star, never max level, never on a gun anyone uses. TSEs are super fun, and IMO they're too rare.
---
The only thing I can think this issue could be is that they reduced the repair costs of weapons and armor (as stated in the patch notes) and they didn't implement it properly.
---
I got one for 100 caps yesterday and could have bought like 6 more from the guy. 130% durability some mods tse handmade.
---
Which 5 are unique? There are tons in whitesprings and enclave. Several responder and raider. Watoga shares with grahm but that doesn't really help. And then Wallace and Phoenix. So that's 3 unique really.
---
Yeah this is a pain and needs to be fixed.
---
Listening to people reporting them and working on them daily/as they come in is a good start.
---
Not once every two/three weeks.
---
I make them for free for people so...uh free?
---
I might be the only player who doesn‚Äôt use chems except rad-x, rad-away, and stims 
---
Someone give this man gold
---
Is this super high level sarcasm?  Because this will affect .0001 percent of the population and as mentioned 50 rad resist is nothing.... like nothing.  It more trouble to NOT scrap toys than worry about 50 rad bonus.
---
i believe ive tried this before and could never get it to snap. honestly the restrictions in camp building is kind of shitty :/
---
Same. Still crashed out like every 15 mins. I can't seem to escape whitesprings.
---
I haven't fallen into one yet but I did notice that even if you some how survived you're not able to climb back out. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I was disconnected right before getting the fragment twice. Ducking pissed so I took a break and played the next day.
---
Yeah, this was a major issue. I'm glad that it's gotten fixed. I just wish it'd stop loading me in beneath the ground.
---
My condolances, we both have suffered.
---
was hoping the dev room was behind that door
---
I will now devote my time to making this work give me twelve hours
---
There was explosive resistant paint for PA in Fallout 4, so here's hoping they eventually bring paint back as a mod rather than just cosmetic.
---
The amount of materials goes up the higher level you craft. You probably have enough for alower level
---
 But not max
---
Pro tip, aggro the Mirelurk and run it right into the Wendigo and hide. The Mirelurk makes fast work of the Wendigo, and as long as you have some stealth it will forget about you and go away.
---
Eh it was interesting to see it visualized but its was pretty much the original story. 3 kids saw a UFO crash into the woods by their house, the mom came out to investigate and saw the woods on fire and pieces of a possible spaceship scattered around. Then all 4 saw a humanoid creature around 10ft tall, it made some weird noise and thats when all 4 gfto. Some govt people heard about it went to investigate and took all the evidence and told the 4 that it was their anxiety and adrenaline that caused them to see what they did which the govt people said was just a large owl. But its basically the same premise as roswell and the weather balloon story.
---
Nope, but i had the same issue with crafting 5mm ammo, i had enough lead, steel a'd gundpowder and it was greyed aswell.
---
Maybe u need a required perk card for crafting the armor? 
---
Loaded in when I read this. I‚Äôve now been sitting for 2 minutes waiting for my camp to load. 
---
Sounds like the ones I‚Äôve watched. 
---
I am european and sometimes i play with my americano scorchbeast queen hunting squad. It takes few minutes till vendor loads and i can sell my shit. Sorry to everyone standing behind me, and yeah it is really inteligent to attack me, becouse i absolutly wont kill you in oneshot with machete, tse shotgun.
---
You found the developers room!  Cheater üòÇ
---
Thanks for the info. I‚Äôm constantly learning new facets of this game. 
---
first time i ever gave gold to anyone, ty for the lol.
---
I‚Äôm not that high level... *is 125*... I‚Äôm over here livin my best level *43*... &gt;.&gt;
---
We‚Äòll do that next time. It happened by accident once so we‚Äòll just do it on purpose this time.
---
2.6k is nothing, I usually have arround 60k 5mm on my heavy weapons character.
---
It's probably because it's an instadeath zone. It seems a bit uncharacteristically harsh of the game to instantly kill you AND lose all your junk, but since the prompt doesn't appear I feel like it's intentional. I only fell down once, and lost pretty much everything I had, including some stable flux. I'm a hoarder so I pretty much have to carry all my junk on me to use my stash efficiently enough to be able to run. Or rather used to, I've cleared out a ton of stuff since then and can store all my flux and the most important junk in my stash
---
Please no more cheers...I can't do monster madh again because of this!
---
My brother had the same problem today trying to do the miner miracles quest.  Said he had the materials but certain parts were greyed out and couldn't complete it.  No idea why that's happening.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs annoying. I actually installed the trading uncapped patch again, and that fixes it for now.
---
I was surprised to see this. Was at Whitesprings and ran into a guys destroyed shack (nuke zone) with bags all over the floor where the owner and his buddy died. 2000 (on the nose) circuits in each bag along with smaller even numbers of other scrap.  I have no idea why he needed so many circuits. 
---
it just works
---
This.
---
Try going back and opening up your stash, navigating to the junk tab, then closing it and going back to craft.
---
The hell are you doing playing around these pits anyway?
---
cringe
---
Also this.
---
OK kid we get it you made multiple reddit accounts.
---
Oh wow, very nice.
---
I'd like to take a minute to make mention of the absolute irony that three nuclear blast going off in the distance is a sign of progress.
---
Here's to the game continuing to improve.
---
Isn‚Äôt she 94?
---
And besides, no, I‚Äôm loyal as fuck to the royal family of the UK.
---
I have the recipe but I haven't been able to get the stuff to make them. I'll have to get that happening if I can be bothered.
---
I don‚Äôt wanna set the world on fire...such a beautiful lyric/song overall.
---
Just because the method itself didn‚Äôt tax the server more than the usual player doesn‚Äôt mean the dupers weren‚Äôt causing problems. Someone walking (or more likely standing as they‚Äôre too overweight) around with an obscene amount of items will no doubt cause stability issues. 
---
I also noticed that speed demon now affects the reload time properly. It's very nice.
---
Well it's a verrrrry long list
---
Well, compared to the 257 from the story I feel the same ;)
---
Oh no no no no nooooo... lyrics*
---
You need one for a quest I believe, check in your junk what they break down to might be useful 
---
i get this sometime when crafting away from my CAMP. game has some difficulties when the required materials are split between your inventory and your STASH, without a STASH box being nearby.
---
Break down the junk you need the put it into stash and use a PA station that has a nearby STASH box. Dont use the one in the bunker.
---
see of that works for you.
---
Quite opposite for me , no more blue screen trying to join , no more disconnecting  no lag 
---
I‚Äôm quite happy (: 
---
RIP dude, you're probably in the crosshairs for a ban now.
---
JK it's a known bug. Just scrap the extra for free mats yo
---
PSA: nobody cares
---
Nice attempt at karma farming on a dead game
---
blocked.
---
Bingo Bango Bongo, I Don‚Äôt wanna leave the Congo, oh no no no noooooooo.
---
Sure, the first person to see the other wins.
---
Completely shutdown your PS. If you've had it for awhile consider cleaning it, make sure it can "breath". Rebuild your data base. Reset your router. When you turn it back on reset your connection. 
---
They can make grenades.
---
Some say that it could be the longest book ever if they choose to put it into print. 
---
I‚Äôm also getting this annoying double loading screen which takes even longer for me to spawn into the game.
---
That's essentially the play with team option just for solo players
---
I don‚Äôt have this problem with any other game.
---
Pretty sweet. Always nice to have a camp with a view too.
---
Y'know I try
---
That happens quite a lot. In FO4 there's a raider variant with a fuckhuge **80 strength**. And the Enraged Fog Crawler had a typo with its ballistic resist, going to **4000** instead of the clearly intended 400 going by the previous levels of crawlers.
---
Ikr, I really love building camps in this game, but sometimes the build order and restrictions are just a bit wonky ='(
---
You sound pretty autistic tbh
---
L2 and R2 on PS4 are godsend. Especially I'd you dont have 50K of the same item
---
I would like to see this event come back *after* duping is fixed, and be turned into a hunt for toys for [Child's Play Charity](https://www.childsplaycharity.org/).  Bethesda could place a robot by Vault 76,  every toy you bring to him for 3-4 days counts as a dollar towards the charity.  Child's Play Charity if you don't know, buys and gives games for kids in hospitals and shelters.
---
Tgat's a funny idea, but I think we all know what will happen after such an update made by Bethesda.
---
Most probable scenario: Not only duped gun stacks stacks, but ALL item stacks will unstack, causing almost every player to scroll through thousands of mats, bullets and other stuff that they usually carry in bulk (but not bulked). 
---
Be careful what you wish for. It might turn out exactly like this :D
---
Jk, I'm here not to troll in any way and I like this game, still playing since beta. But despite all patches and qol changes it's still hard to believe they're able to solve some issues in a proper way.
---
Same on Xbox one, had worse lag + more crashes during my play today than I have in awhile. Could be increased traffic because of the update buuuut yeah, load timing is definitely not fixed. 
---
As a PS4 player I'm so sick of hearing about the PC mods that should be built into the game anyway... Man.
---
Each person should get their own different legendary.  I‚Äôve had it disappear a few times too and it always makes me sad 
---
I'm camped nearby that rock :p
---
you are too good for this wasteland
---
I found an explosive 2* smg at the watoga train station (presumably someone didn't inspect the weapon to see what it was). Got a 3* quad, explosive, +250 damage resistance while reloading harpoon gun off the SBQ. Also got junkies explosive .44 pistol somewhere... But my go to weapon is from a guy I met while checking out his camp. We discovered we live in the same city, became good friends and he sold me a quad explosive pump shotgun. I guess if be using the harpoon if I'd not met my friend, but coming across an explosive SOMETHING isn't too difficult. I just wish there was more variety to weapons besides amazing explosive, and non explosive.
---
I must have read your post three or four times and although I can‚Äôt stop tearing up we are all here for you and with you bro.  We love you man 
---
I see some people here can‚Äôt handle the truth, it is unacceptable that some issues can persist between releases. I‚Äôm not saying that Bethesda should use the code written by modest, but they should be more than capable of fixing their game engine if a fan can do it within a few weeks of release. 
---
I hope these dupers get home one day to find their family has turned into Plan: Single Action Revolver Ivory Grips.
---
I told my gf to not walk around it, becouse she can't play very much. Every time we are doing Scorchebeast queen and some idiot pull her near fisure, my gf falls in it, running away from mobs. 
---
Sniff it and scream ‚Äûwitness me‚Äú before running into a nuke zone
---
Edit: I like how user flair actually represents the answers 
---
Grenades and Phantom Devices
---
yeah i love it in some respects too, but its just so restricted compared to building in FO4, and not just in size. i want to place walls, stair s, etc. without it being on a foundation :(
---
Wooooooah. It's surely happens to me too. I had a Mega sloth. He was immortal so I asked a friend to kill him cause he's too loud. I just wanted to build my new camp in peace then I would be back to tame him. In a first moment I didn't realize the stored budget bugged. The sloth respawned just one time when I reboot the game. But at the end he went me. At the end atm I have 30% stored budget with 0 stored Items 0 blueprints and something like 400/600 on stash. Some fix? Solved it? I was getting mad cause of 30% is too much!
---
where is that ?
---
I ran into a guy who seemed to be using a lot of bobble heads. He was unarmed and able to mangle me in a punch or two. It put one arm of my power armor into the red from over 100% condition. Then he stole my precious garbage.
---
So I snuck up on him and one shotted him with my Instigating Dragon... twice. That‚Äôs MY garbage. Mine.
---
Yes but it doesnt stay like that if you die multiple times, at least in myself and my roommates experiences.
---
Thank you so much for helping out! =D I've edited the post linking an image of how it supposed to look like (when I got it working last time...), hopefully it helps! 
---
Not saying you do, but this will increase your PS performance across the board, and will probably help with stability in this game.
---
Same here dont know how but it work for me 
---
It can be used to make a phantom device, which is essentially just an improved stealth boy. Other than that you can just make those grenades (which I actually haven't tried yet but in F4 they frenzied enemies) or scrap it down for steel and acid(?)
---

4. Frequent disconnects from the server ( 6-7 an hour) making the game unplayable... I'm trying to defend Bethesda to my friends for this game but you guys are making it very hard on me... If you plan to continue to treat 76 as a Game as a Service, you need to have some kind of active support on hand 24/7. This is unacceptable.
---
Where did you get it from?
---
43 was one of the best levels in my life. One day you'll look back and wish things were as simple as they are now. *sips moonshine on a rickety old porch swing*
---
Came here to comment this
---
Probably not much, they're a fairly common reward from the technical data quest and the plans are easy to find
---
Thanks Bethesda for fixing something that should have already been fixed when released
---
You aren't the only one.
---
Tbh if you pair it with carnivore and the perk (cant recall off the top of my head) that reduces negative mutation effects its simply not an issue.
---
If the light or other item is too high to clip a wire too it, move it lower, attach the wire and them move it to its final location.

It takes 5mm? I thought it would take .50 balls
---
The one in the shop is a clean, undamaged variant. I don't see why they'd remove the soiled version from the game. Must be a coincidence.
---
I've found a nocturnal explosive gatling plasma. Maybe there's a connection between them
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs broke as fuck
---
Had it too
---
Happens all the time with Nuked Flora materials too
---
same 
---
ps4 btw 
---
Whats bird law?
---
at that price definitely duped. Even if a person did not care about them, there is no way they would sell them for that little after finding them
---
With perks like Tank Killer, Incisor, or Stabilized combined with AP weapon mods, your 600 DR means little to nothing. 
---
You can still find them in the world, it‚Äôs just also an option in the atom shop. If you didn‚Äôt see it again where it spawned before someone else just grabbed it already. 
---
This is your answer why this isn't a feature. There are characters that run around with 18 charisma. Get two of them on a team and you'll have two unstoppable tanks. Then those two tanks can become insane griefers. 
---
Killed her many many times. Sometimes server crash, sometimes only my game crash (but i get stuck in que to get back on server), queen get immortal bullet sponge, she fly away from map, her corpse change to meatpile in few sec and you spend 10+minutes trying to find it, someone with stacked boobleheads kill her in seconds so you dont get your hit = no loot,......       yeah sometimes it dont end well, sometimes (like 2x in 50+ kills) you get recipe for crafting mutation serum. This game is survival, try to survive boi.
---
These fucking meta posts about the sub and the culture around the game are getting really old. There is actually nothing in this post even about Fallout 76, just a bunch of loaded questions with no real contribution to any discussion 
---
Blue screened 6 times in a 3 hour window. I've never had it happen that much. 3 of the times we're attempting to play the 'Census Violence' event. (All different areas)
---
Funny thing is you can't go from 25000-&gt;0
---
See I found the plans so was not sure to be honest.
---
Wish the game had some kind of auction house or something to see prices
---
I saw a woman play the guitar with her feet once. 
---
you can still get the soiled version in game. its like how you can but a clean water purifier and generator in the atom shop but still get the dirty version in game.
---
Fair enough, my bad, I thought stealing a workshop flagged you as Wanted not just for PvP 
---
Theres a few places where you can place your camp directly on one.
---
Yeah! That'll be awesome if we can build walls and stairs without it being on a foundation, it'll give us so much more creative freedom! Since the game is still young, I'm really crossing my fingers for a less restrictive camp building system in the future.
---
I agree. I don‚Äôt see the point in having to switch out passive ability perks for stuff like those mentioned above. 
---
I try to only buy non-duped items but there isn't an item history you can check here. Best I do is just look through the seller's account history to see if there's something suspicious, and then try to search up that exact effect combination to see if an identical one has been sold. Here's a little tip, items drop with semi-randomized condition bars. If they have the same exact attachments, two different weapons will usually have slightly different max conditions while duped ones will have identical ones. 
---
I imagine this would make inventories take up way more server space
---
That's pretty sweet honestly.  I've thought about doing that before, and when I buy the metal walls I would replace the warehouse walls with those.  Probably gonna rebuild eventually because I'm never satisfied.  And I really enjoy seeing what I can come up with.  I like the location I'm in but I just wish there was some body of water nearby.  
---
They do sync, any past 5 it starts to get a bit funky though.
---
Yes, being able to swap out these utility perks  fso they don't forever eat up slots on a build for combat is just dumb. Sorry, it just is.
---
Or just use healing factor mutation and only stimpack when u get low in a fight. That's what I do. Also helps me know if there anything else nearby cause if you are detetced or in combat healing factor doesn't work
---
It's literally on the description for the arms when you craft them
---
Uranium fever?
---
lol these fake posts are getting worse and worse. "my mother was literally in tears playing this average MMO game", jesus christ lol
---
yeah id like to see some improvements on Camps down the road. i hope the impliment a 'Settlement' where people can buold small communities without camp barriers. 
---
I ran into the Charleston landfill glitch today with floating enemies. Cheers.
---
It's been pretty good for me today as well. It does a weird double load though going into Appalachia.
---
STEP 5: SKEWER THE WINGED BEAST
---
I have a temporary base set up on the mainland side of Deathclaw Island and out of the six or seven servers I've ended up on today it has been missing. I'll keep looking, just seems peculiar for them to advertise it for real money when there's something relating to killing Wendigos as a quest. it's misleading for people who haven't organically run into the item in-game, if it still exists
---
2 shot explosive legendary guns. Also known as TSE
---
It wouldn't be so bad if other people couldn't hear it. My position gets compromised if I move just enough to deactivate it. Totally usually on sneaking up to people :/ 
---
I know nothing 
---
Should confuse them. Weaker enemies may go into a frenzy and attack each other. I use the had to make the phantom device. 
---
Well I just found one and pricey though but the big boom is worth it lmao
---
Unrelated, but when I first got around to killing SBs with a 50cal, I jumped into one of the fissures on purpose because I wanted to know what would happen and it looked nice. It was about 4am\~ so it makes sense I guess.
---
Thanks for looking into it. Although with my lightning fast scrapping reflex I don't think it would benefit me for long lol
---
That‚Äôs fine. Pop a warning that says that world no longer exists. That warning is already in the code. I‚Äôve seen it when trying to rejoin my team‚Äôs server after a world crashed. 
---
Oh yeah that's what I meant. I'm aware it's still in the game.
---
Yeah I get what you‚Äôre saying! I think people just know it spawns there and it‚Äôs a quest item so it‚Äôs popular. Bethesda is just using it in the atom shop to capitalize on impatient people lol 
---
which is why I said it's not enough for pvp.

This is a pretty good guide.

What's the effect of 'confusing' a player? Screen blurs? Lowers VATS?
---
All these posts about this shite aint gonna stop shite.
---
The clean purifier in the Atom shop is just a skin for the existing(dirty) purifier. You still have to find or buy the plans in the game. I was misled about this by another player on day one. It‚Äôs nice to have the skin now I guess but I wouldn‚Äôt have spent the Atoms on it if I had known. It‚Äôs my fault for not reading the description but I just took his word for it. 
---
100% dumb and aggravating
---
It does exist and infact the wendigo quest will put a marker to where u can get one. as others have said, the atom store version is just clean.
---
Not sure if it‚Äôs been fixed but it has been very buggy, and there were a lot of hoops you had to jump through such as 
---
the enemy being no higher than half your lvl
---
Would Carnivore work with Cannibalism?
---
I was echoing that point. 
---
Besides, TSEs make it all moot anyway. Even without bobble heads or shotgun perks I can one hit anyone hostile with a TSE shotgun unless they‚Äôre using an exploit. 
---
Is it 
---
Indeed
---
why?
---
Tagging your mom on reddit is one of the coolest things someone can do. Have an upvote!
---
Anyone test this out?
---
Reportedly it does but I have no first hand experience
---
I tried this before, but it quickly becomes obvious you're feeding into a farming feedback loop. You're already likely using acid for gun powder, and then you're going to use it for ore. It won't take long until you're grinding for acid. 
---
My advice for people is to find ways to break farming feedback loops and do this more efficiently. 9 times/10, using less resources is the best option, and that means getting stronger weapons or buffing them with the right perks. 
---
I do not know and I'm in power armor 24/7 and always was
---
Yes! It will be so cool if we can build our camps right next to our friends' camps too =D
---
Yep. Had to experience this the hard way.
---
I fell in one of those once and didn't die. Still couldn't get out though.

Thanks OP, this has summoned a smile on my face and yeah, I too have grown jaded 
---
The only level 200+ I have seen voice chat on Spanish or Russian while they casually destroy my camp in the swamps. 
---
Wow! Thank you :)
---
If you are solo player you have to switch, if you are in team you should have someone to be lockpicker, someone to be hacker, like in old fallouts you had characters with different abilites.
---
Huh? How could they steal your caps
---
This is the curse of online multiplayer.
---
It's silly.  It's always silly.
---
This. It's sometimes easier to take all of them, scrap, and then drop the unneeded stuff since picking out the straws could slow you down
---
I normally ALT F4 straight away, then reload game onto another server.
---
Its quick enough for you not to die and lose all your junk.
---
This is why you should always carry around some bleed melee.
---
thats one thing i thought should have already been in the game. anyone thats in a group should have the ability to merge camp borders. 
---
pool cues give plastic as well. Anywhere with mutants tends to work. If you don't get steel, you'll get plastic

I totally thought in the picture that you all were sitting around with blankets on. I didn‚Äôt realize they were dresses. 
---
Freaking awesome though!
---
I was so disappointed when I first realized we couldn't do this. I knew the budget would start a bit small, but losing this critical tool for detailing camps feels bad. 
---
We need about 100 more budget (assuming a wall costs 1) and the ability to place looted items. Then I will be happy to level up multiple characters and enjoy building each of their homes. Right now it feels like we're being starved for decor and budget... and it's not not cool!
---
its a shill post, this sub is 80% shills hired by bethesda.
---
If so, it'd make for an interesting play style, having to only use one perk point for the cannabalism. Not to mention, plenty to nosh on while roaming.
---
Yep this is pretty common unfortunately. Just add it to the list. 
---
Fair enough, my bad, I thought stealing a workshop flagged you as Wanted not just for PvP. I don't tend to claim workshops, just travel to defend events for plans
---
Yeah! Also how are we gonna repopulate America if we can't have sex with whoever we choose, whether they want it or not?
---
I used to live in whitesprings and in my camp there was a skeleton on a bench with some beers so I put a tv in front of him.
---
Water is still an issue. My thirst bar goes down twice as fast as the food
---
Go into your power armor station in the craft option. Look at any level of the arms. It's there
---
That would certainly stick a finger in the eye of the dupers. I‚Äôm all for it. 
---
Good idea that.
---
Because thats all that can stack. Soon it will be none.
---
I did the Mr. Messager event once he ended up killing some bunnies, I legit stopped dead in my tracks looked both ways a good two three times like "Bruh wtf rly" then wandered off like you know what deliver your own damn message you bunny murdering jerk. 
---
I was playing yesterday normally just following the story and I found 7 legendaries yesterday. I was doing the story quest where Rose ask you to install a signal booster into the Radio Array. I'm level 51 at the Radio Array a majority of the super mutants were legendary or evolved to be 3 star legendaries and each ad every one gave me a legendary weapon. None I was particularly happy with though. 10mm pistol, gold club, spear, wood armor, knife, etc. 
---
The mod you have is probably for the normal sledge hammer. 
---
AFAIK the only mod for the super sledge is the heating coil.
---
I think we're looking more for the ability to place individual items we find in the world. It's been in the last several Bethesda games but they stripped it from 76, presumably because of performance considerations... though it's really strange cause I would have no problem placing them as part of my budget.
---
Possible, I did that. I won't do them solo again without an explosive legendary though.
---
Truth üèπ
---
I do understand that. I have Speed Demon and I'm constantly thirsty. I can hardly keep up with it.
---
Exactly, using a second or more of the same type, should simply reset the timer, not stack the bonus.
---
So was it ‚Äûstolen‚Äú or did the loot table just decided it didn‚Äôt want to be and removed ‚Äûonly his legendary‚Äú loot?

omfg it's so precious, I want it
---
Anything in the hole?  I‚Äôve gotten error messages for random debris being in the hole when trying to place one.  Also make sure the node is completely inside your camp. 
---
As for the others, just scrap them. Look for other duped items too as the extractor probably isn‚Äôt the only one. 
---
interior cells are unaffected
---
I am annoyed that so many parts of this game basically require you to run PA... Particularly nuke zones but this is another good example. There are some huge balance issues that need to be dealt with to allow more choice for players.
---
I wonder why they decided to make them brighter now.  They just increased night time brightness across the board last month.
---
I get what you're saying but the random gear drops are actually a bullshit way to gear up in this game. What's fun or fair about some people getting ultimate super weapons but no one else? I've got over 200 hrs and spent a lot of time raiding and never seen a TSE.
---
Now compare to like COF or BF where if you want a specific weapon you grind towards it and you can get it and everyone has the equal opportunity to get it.
---
Personally I see nothing wrong with the over use of TSEs. Now everyone gets to play the same game, not some elite few who the game gods smile on.
---
I do think TSE are fundamentaly broken and should not stack 2 shot with explosive, one or the other, I also think the Explosive part shouldn't stack on weapon damage but should be added like the radiation damage on Gamma guns and such. But for how they are now? Meh if everyone has one. Truly.
---
But like other posts say the TSE isn't an issue on its own but when stacked with duped Bobble heads it bypasses game mechanics and allows one to instagib instead of opt in PvP. Is that the TSE's fault or the stacking bobble heads fault? 
---
I have Daisycutter. Its weight is perfect for clearing mobs.
---
Talk about efficient. Thanks for the info.
---
That's ass. Sorry to hear.
---
Ironically, I've crashed at least once in almost every setting so far except for the Nuke Zones so I guess I'm pretty lucky.
---
I've had a few cats spawn near my camp and they're red like enemies but they don't actually do anything. I consider them like my outdoor pets.
---
Yep. 
---
Had the day off, thought I'd get some time in (too hot to go outside in this heatwave) ...nope!
---
Think I've had half a dozen freezes today, gave up. Hasn't been an issue at all for me, until the most recent patch.
---
just gotta put the FG down before you build anything above it
---
But now there is another duping method that destroys the server worst than the last one... 
---
Cooked Cat is the best thing to eat in FO76.
---
Nuke zones are places you going to meet other people and show off your stuff though.
---

---
Were your windows open? Could've been the Open Window Maniac of West Virginia teaching through example.
---
Because what OP said doesn't make sense. The devs fix known _duping methods_, but the goods in dupers' inventories will retain value, why would they drop perfectly good merchandise if they still can sell it after the patch?
---
What we need are some M16s.
---
Not [these M16s,](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/M16a1m16a2m4m16a45wi.jpg/300px-M16a1m16a2m4m16a45wi.jpg) just in case anyone was confused on how assault rifles would help us.

I wasn‚Äôt talking about 500,000 weight, I was talking about the fact that they‚Äôd have thousands of individual items in their inventory causing heavy lag in their pip-boy.
---
With placing that stuff there should be a way to toggle it as movable, or stuck in place, so people can't just come in and take all of your decorations. 
---
Its the internet culture of LOL I'M SO RANDOM!
---
I think it‚Äôs time for you to get a death claw pet . 
---
This exact thing happened to me this afternoon.
---
Maybe friends now look like foes. Like your buddy now looks like a Deathclaw to you and to him your look like one so you attack each other
---
yeah I just noticed the [disclaimer](https://i.imgur.com/8nXA6CO.jpg) they have in place for it. but it still doesn't specify that it is a "clean" variant and there is no full-body shot to verify (such as weighing a dirty one having tattered legs vs the "clean" variant having full legs or something similar)

I‚Äôm going to do this for my friend that‚Äôs wants the game and my favorite is Ol man mose from fallout 76 of course

Lock pick and hacker should absolutely be passive traits. Each acquired at level ups. Say 15 25 and 40 or something. 
---
Hard bargain I could also see passive but it doesnt bother me that much to swap that out to do a vendor run. 
---
They should be passively active
---
Boy I wish.

Maybe they make other players look like dupers... ü§î

You got baited. It happens all the time for me even when no one is around. Even when whitesprings isn‚Äôt nuke it‚Äôs still good spot to mine for legendary from the ghouls. I‚Äôm usually alone when I do it and the table always changes sometimes for the better but mostly for the worst. 
---
I'm down. psn- smogmonster512
---
The loot table switched on you,Ive heard it could have gone to another downed enemy in the area and you can sometimes find it again.
---
Yep I also extra protective about mine barely go to luck so I don‚Äôt take it off and I go two star rank saving my serum until I‚Äôm not over encumbered 
---
Yeah there's some cool stuff on the shop but I'm really disappointed with the paints so far.
---
Like what's the deal with that Pollock Painting vomit Metal armor paint?
---
Here's an idea Bethesda: Red paint. Or White paint. Or even Orange paint. Simple colors.
---
Revolutionary, I know!
---
World spawns are instanced for the most part. If you picked it up or looted the area, it won't be there until it resets about 21 hours after you first picked stuff up. It's so people don't farm rare spawns by server hopping
---
We don't really know if that's true 
---
Nah, I got it off some random ghoul in a nuke zone
---
Camp building is the gist of my end game.
---
Thanks, I almost got to launch the Nuke today for the first time. Unfortunately right after I used the keycard and entered the code me and the random both fucking DC‚Äôd. I‚Äôm taking a long break from this fucking game. Nice job though
---
Great story! Always warms my hearth seeing a positive one on this sub amidst all the moaning. 
---
I'm a bit lower than you at lvl.41 and I've only had positive encounters with higher level players. 
---
What was the legendary, any good? Although even if it's not, it's the journey and the friends we make along that count, not the reward :)
---
90% of that shit is duped.  Yours probably is too.

The difference in damage between explosive and two shot isn't that big.
---
&gt; under the premise that loot boxes are considered illegal in may places 
---
uh.. so u lied? sure lootboxes might be illegal, but FO76 doesnt have any... yet (maybe).
---
Goddamnit Bethesda 
---
IME Whitesprings nets me a 3 star legendary item once or twice inside of 2 hours. Meanwhile, clearing a silo and going after the queen gets you 2 items that are 1-3 star (quest reward and loot). It does tend to be armor though. Generally, I find higher quality stuff from that fight, but it's one of those catch 22's. Need good gear to fight queen, but queen drops good gear sometimes. 
---
When I was level 80, I kind of just surveyed the map and made a note of how many really high-level players there were. If there was at least 4, then there's adequate help to fight. Less than that and it might be tough. 
---
A third option worth considering is that not all 1 stars are useless. A quad cryolator is a huge force multiplier in the queen fight. She'll stay on the ground longer and take more effective hits. A two shot or anti-armor fat man/missile launcher (both types do comparable damage, but queen has a lot of DR) is a one star but also good. 
---
And also, it might be worth thinking outside of your comfort zone. If you're specced as a rifle man but all you're finding is heavy weapons, maybe that's a sign. At some point, your perks can't outrun your gear and it's worth building your character around the right gear even if it isn't your preference. 
---
Worst case scenario, getting adrenal reaction, a full set of 1 star unyielding armor, and a mr. handy buzz saw blade really does a lot. It sounds like a joke, but with a well specced character my level 155 friend beats out my DPS as a 280. He rebuilt his character and it paid off. 
---
Great account name and post history mate. Get on with your life and stop bothering those who are enjoying the game
---
They actually mentioned fixing a bug that previously made it so that 'wires' didn't affect the CAMP budget.
---
It could be that now that it's factoring in the wires, your camp exceeded the budget 
---
Yeah, it's nothing new man. Don't worry. It happened to me like 8 times in a row a couple months ago and I had like 1000+ walls. It was a lot of just sitting there scrapping extras. On the bright side, wood and steel weren't a problem
---
This guy also ate 3/4 of a Big Mac and got a refund. He didn‚Äôt like the direction the last 1/4 was going in. Fries were fine though. 
---
wow people here are desperate.
---
A day before patch day on PS4 I was on a server that had 2 nukes overlap at Whitesprings.. the server held up for about 10 mins then fried.   So yeah it sounds like progress.
---
Supposedly it's due to dupers using a new cancerous method of duping that involves crashing the server to force a roll back. 
---
Today this happened when i had a new hunting rifle to mod, i had all the materials for upgrading ammo clips yet i couldnt make them, i tried seeing if i could make other stuff and it worked then.
---
People who duplicate hundreds of thousands of bobbleheads and thousands of TSE weapons get off scott free dont sweat it.
---
Also please dont try to make it happen.
---
Use green thumb perk in nuke zones, More for you and everyone else
---
just trade for it if the price is right. 
---
Sooner or later Beth will strike at the people with 100s of TSE weapons. This coupled with a increase in weapon levels to level 80 with adjustment to mob difficulties across all zones will make all the duped weapons obsolete as soon as people start find legitimate level 80 weapons.
---
This of course assumes that Beth finally stops duping 100%.....this is a big assumption.
---
I've got a nice little reserve of Atoms I'm saving for some truly cool paint job. I've spend some on items for CAMP stuff, but mostly I'm waiting for something more Fallouty than what's currently offered. Outside of the PA camo paint there isn't anything that screams wasteland warrior to me. 
---
You got 200 hours of enjoyment for what, definitely less than 50c/hour, and you're having a bitch?  Well I'm glad, because we're all better off with you out of the community.

Fallout at it's root never took itself too seriously. I see what you're saying but one could argue playtime power armour is more fallout than camo power armour
---
YES! Especially considering rank 3 lockpicking/hacking is 3 separate cards. 
---
LOL! Nope, I just have cool parents. 
---
I‚Äôve had some good trades there. Sold off some of my legitimately acquired legendaries. Nothing anyone would want to dupe though, or at least I don‚Äôt think so. 
---
yeah some guy on reddit who claims to be your dad totally proves it wrong. i need time stamped photos of your entire family, or i'm declaring it a shill post.
---
Yea I actually just found a guy with one, I‚Äôve been saving loads of caps so 3250 wasn‚Äôt really much just a couple just a couple hours over a few days to sell stuff to make it back
---
It seems to happen when alot of players and mobs are in the same place at the same time,if you want to try farming map out common legendary spawns and run a loop see if it helps.
---
I do this type of thing all the time, you should be able to build the necessary support for that roof extension and then remove it after placing the roof itself, it looks like one edge of the intended roof extension will be touching the far wall that currently has a roof attached to it, is that correct?
---
Necessary support for the roof extension would include at least one of the following:
---
A) A wall (and maybe an extra half wall, can‚Äôt tell) with the backside facing to the left in your picture, may need an extra foundation under the roof extension space if there‚Äôs not one there currently.
---
B)  A wall (or half wall) stacked with that triangle shaped half wall piece facing towards the camera.
---
Either of those should allow you to initially support the roof extension, and for whatever reason you can usually remove the supporting structure afterwords if the new roof is attached to another structure with the supports removed, i.e. the existing roof piece next to it.
---
Hope this helps
---
I WISH I WORKED FOR BETHESDA OMG THAT WOULD BE AMAZING
---
I read that too but honestly it was only like 4 wires in my whole set up. I figure the scrapped floors and walls would have definitely made up for it. Besides I havent connected any wires yet. Thanks tho!
---
I understand the instanced bit but I highly doubt people server hopping would give up the [booblehead](https://i.imgur.com/Z1FpBOD.jpg) (screenshot just now on a new server) and take nothing but the clown outfit. everything else in the area has respawned, including the "instanced" full giddy-up buttercup
---
Sorry.. pc
---
Im not sure. I had 950ish on me, he killed me 2x for 230 each. So I didn't load in, and my team mate said the game loaded my avatar in without me selecting the respawn option. So I guess he was shooting the character that shouldn't have been there. I had 0 caps after that... 
---
I don't PVP so I'm not sure if that is how it 8s supposed to be. But it seems shady way to play 
---
Wow what a great read, this just made my day. 
---
Sir, last question; have you considered running for office?
---
Mistress of mystery. It's used to make the phantom device with a Stealth boy.
---
Your Credit Card company is going to revoke your card now.
---
Is there? Whelp. There goes the neighborhood.
---
that isn't how shills work. bethesda just hires a social media company who's job it is to make fake posts and use bots to upvote it. companies outsource their shilling, you dont' work for the company directly.
---
then again, "i wish i worked for x company" is such a generic shill reply, that you're just proving even more that you're a shill.
---
What I did was stay on the ledge and then threw a few Plasma grenades at it before I popped a "phantom device" and then shoot it while it confused. 
---
Tbh you were probably not expected to find more than two or three of the same kind, so it was never expected to be this problematic.
---
I just realised that I sent you the wrong reply
---
Was replying to 2 post and it them mixed up.
---
But the answer your question, no I haven't found it yet, not had much time on the game 
---
If so, that's the solutions, tyvm sirüòÑ
---
It feels so empty because we cant just place items to decorate. My settlements in 4 were dope af  my settlement in here is so bland and empty..... no life with empty rooms and shelves. I'm so used to hoarding vodka Bourban and whiskey to make dope bars but in this theres no point....
---
Yeah the load screens are crazy and I still spawn in before anything loads around me. In fact, it seems worse now than it did pre-patch.
---
I'm positive this is it, and some teams are more descriptive than others. 
---
When you look through the patch notes, you can see the same change added twice, but with different wording. That must be when two groups worked on the same fix. 
---
Well if people in the beta hadn't been rushing for XP we'd have fewer bugs.
---
Okay who let Trump finish his leftover Hamberders and get on reddit?
---
I think this game needs more nice people in it because even though I lost a day of random XP, I had a lot of fun.
---
There are wedding rings! My teammate has one. Finding them isn't very easy though. I've heard there's one in New Gad and one S of White Powder Winter Sports.

---
Someone is downvoting every comment on this thread, it‚Äôs not just you. 
---
Great reply man, I definitely see where you're coming from. And yeah, that camo paint looks awful.
---
do u know if its better than the super sledge?
---
I would also love to see weapons and armor organized. Guns/melee/throwables and armor/power armor. I hate in a pinch trying to cycle through a bunch of shit. It's worse after you've been looting a bunch
---
It was cringe at first for us. I grew up on Runescape and my roommate played Star Wars Galaxies. Weddings are common in both games. This was funnier for some reason and worth the experience.  
---
I can‚Äôt, and won‚Äôt, deny that they are hair pullingly annoying to fight, but the satisfaction of blowing one out of the sky and watching it lifelessly tumble and cartwheel to the ground is equally undeniable. For me at least. 
---
I hated this when I would join a map... I would be able to run around for 20-30 seconds but not interact with anything... then suddenly the screen would blink and I would be back where I spawned and now I am able to play the game.
---
Not true on PS4
---
I mean I'm sure there is something better just look on youtube but from experience it's just the University and any medical or science facillity. Plus the fog crawlers in the glass cavern and also there are some living fog crawlers at the treehouse village. Keep in mind to look for biometric scanners as well.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why bethesda made it so you could consume multiple bobble heads at once.
---
It should be one bobblehead max at a time.
---
Yeah OP post is definitely not true for console 
---
Haven‚Äôt had it happen with enemies, but bots at Whitesprings, the Enclave bunker, and Camp McClintock randomly die for no apparent reason.  
---
Well I actually got 7 legendary items because of this other players willingness to make sure I got a hit in with each legendary enemy. None of them turned out to be keepers, but like you said, it's the journey and the friends. I dropped all of the legendaries in the register at whitesprings. 
---
How do you know this? If someone giving it to you obviously they could have duped it or gotten it from a duper themselves. You are never safe from the dupes unless you get the drop yourself! 
---
are you playing on PC? PS4? I'm on Xbox and other instanced items have respawned in the area, including the bobblehead I grabbed at the same time but the bench is still empty
---
I wish we could sell missles
---
Yep :(
---
Fallout always felt more like dark humor. Maybe if the Let's Play power armor had a bloody hand print or two to hint that playtime is not always fun time it would fit more....
---
but that is just me.
---
You got a refund on a game that you played for over 200 hours? Sounds like you‚Äôre the one scamming.
---
I have a pretty high luck and max super duper and have never had it proc when bulking. Is this part of the new patch?
---
Hey, monkey boy, I didn‚Äôt say a word about ‚Äútrading for caps‚Äù, and I don‚Äôt think this‚Äôll fix anything. If anything, it‚Äôs just another ‚Äúlemme hope on the duper‚Äôs hate bandwagon because I‚Äôm honestly getting annoyed‚Äù post. If you can‚Äôt give it a little laugh, then why are you even here? If you know it‚Äôs not gonna fix anything, why are you getting aggressive?
---
I doubt he even had the game by the look of the reddit account, and how he has wrong info. Pointless shitpost should be removed tbh
---
In previous games selecting those bonuses was a permanent choice that either prevented getting something else (fallout 3 and NV skill requirements) or delayed those unlocks. They were also linked to SPECIAL stats in fallout 4 requiring at least a few points in either.if you wanted to do all those things in any other game, you‚Äôd have to make sacrifices to your combat performance. In this game, There‚Äôs no trade off. It‚Äôs free, except for a few seconds of your time. 
---
In this game you need a whole 3 points, and hacker comes from INT anyway which is almost a necessity to ensure you can at least craft all your desired gear. at least 3 in CHA is a must for sharing a perk, but you‚Äôd technically need 4 to run fast travel cost and hard bargain. You aren‚Äôt hindered by selecting them because you can swap them out once no longer necessary. If you don‚Äôt feel the reward of hacking/lockpick is worth it, why not just not do it? You don‚Äôt need in to every locked room/terminal. You don‚Äôt need to open safes at high level.
---
You‚Äôve been given a huge QOL upgrade over previous games in the series in that you aren‚Äôt saddled with an annoying perk/skill distribution forever. You just swap as necessary. You‚Äôre free to build for combat with only the mild inconvenience of swapping a perk for the right situation. I would‚Äôve killed for that ability in other games. 
---
So you lied to your credit card company and fraudulently claimed a product was illegal when i clearly it was not. After you played for 200 hrs.
---
5 star Legendary Dick move.
---
Don't know what else to say then. They didn't remove items from the game for any of the other clean items they introduced and I highly doubt they did it with the clown suit. I still have mine, so they didn't flat out remove them either. It's probably just about the challenge, like somebody else said; killing a wendigo with a clown suit comes back every single time. When we had that weekly challenge of leveling up while wearing a beer hat, the guaranteed instanced one next to the harper's ferry vendor was gone pretty much every single time I passed by
---
Love that event for the easy shotgun shells / steel farming, but need to run my non explosive shotgun in there for a few reasons. Suicide by TSE is the only cause of death I've had for weeks. And my 2-shot non-explosive shotgun does enough damage to drop the miners to 50% from across the room, perfect for tenderizing them for other players to get kill credit. A lot of the scrap from there is beyond what i need/can carry so i make a point of filling the container next to the workbench with anything extra. 
---
Makes me wonder about who people have run into when i join someone in the lower levels and they either avoid me, or i hear over area chat "Please don't kill me". 
---
Glad you found a community player, and hope this and future encounters help keep you from getting too jaded.
---
How do you hit 2000 carry weight in whitespring? There're only ghouls there and their heaviest drop are stimpaks that weight 1 each, and anybody with a lick of sense will run travelling pharmacy especially if they're farming mobs that are weak and drop a lot of chems, and as for junk they drop there are crafting benches even if you don't run pack rat.
---
You can check dupermart r/fo76bazaar
---
PS4 and yeah that still sounds like nothing out of the usual.
---
For example at Whitesprings, there's a golf skirts and a place a Bobblehead always spawns. Sometimes the golf skirts are there but the Bobblehead isn't. Or vice versa.
---
I wouldn't mind my Medical Supplies Market to be a front for a few cages and some meat bags in the basement. 
---
That makes sense the only reason they're alive is due to the Scorched queen.
---
iirc the lv52 gutsy can spawn with armor piercing yes. You can tell by the audio it's not that loud but hurts. some super mutants aswell.
---
There are dupers with thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of pounds on characters setting a cap at 5k would fuck most of them
---
Yeah, I feel like there‚Äôs not really any legitimate way to deal with the situation except for banning, which is a hassle in itself already.
---
There is a mod for PC that does just that.
---

---
No luck if you're on console though.
---
I'll email support and see what the response is when I have better quality screenshots. thanks for the help lad
---
Did you try smiling ? 
---
Yeah dark humour mixed with some quirk, I feel ya
---
No you wont be purchasing another Bethesda game because they will (and in my opinion rightfully) flag your account for fraud.
---
 You played a game for 200 hours and decided because some D list even for youtube personality bitched and moaned about lootboxes maybe being added to the game but probably not,you felt entitled to a complete refund having gotten your entire moneys worth already.
---
 Bethesda may have released a horrifically unstable and poorly polished game but its no excuse to outright steal from them,especially after you admit to playing for hundreds of hours.
---
If you‚Äôre already at Morgantown High School farming for plastic, you can stop by the science lab and grab the microscopes. At least there is a chemistry table there as well. 
---
That's nice, unfortunately I've never found anything at train station either in suitcases or registers. Perhaps servers are based on regions and this hasn't spread everywhere?
---
Before the duping became widespread people were already spending more than 25k for a single tse weapon. The game had a real chance for people to have a goal to work towards something they wanted. These weapons should be stupid hard to get they completely trivialize the game even without spending perks to make them better. Truly sad Bethesda sat on their ass and let the dupers do so much damage for so long.
---
Similarly they won‚Äôt clip through watery areas because ‚Äúyou cannot build in water‚Äù even though that rule can be disobeyed easily by other means.
---
Server stability is important.  In-game economy is not.   Why do folks ever mention game economy?
---
Clearly a Rockstar shill üòÇ
---
So we are literally thanking them for bugs now? This sub is something else.
---
I was in the middle of powering up Poseidon when the game crashed...
---
Yup had the same thing happen to me 2 days ago. Some fucktard launched a MIRV at her as the killing blow which caused half the server to DC and not get the loot. I did get the loot from completing the quest but nothing from the body even after server hopping around 10 times to find that server again.
---
0.002 percent of subscribers to the sub have upvoted your post and you write ‚Äúwow this blew up‚Äù
---
Always laugh/cringe when I read stuff like that. Reserve that for when you get like 10k or something 
---
And I know, it‚Äôs a bit of r/gatekeeping  ... before you sneak it in there 
---
Or an instigating rolling pin.
---
Same. Please hot-fix this one. I'm glad they raised the player-to-player cap, but the scrolling past the max mechanism is way off and annoying as hell.
---
That double loading screen is taking place of the lad you would normally hit when you log in.   Instead of seeing everything lag and eventually pop in, you‚Äôre not looking at another loading screen.
---
That's true. But I need stacks of 5. I'm making orbital strike beacons. 
---
Pretty positive I got a 2* legendary pitchfork from a 3* legendary liberator. 
---
&gt;my friend got 15 Luck points and he's been farming god tiers legendary which are 3 stars - 5 stars item
---
If you had a workshop it can be claimed and it automatically enters pvp with both parties. So he claimed the workshop and came and killed you since it tagged you for pvp. There was a post a while back about this but it was deleted. 
---
Once you claim a workshop pacifist mode does not matter. If someone comes to claim it you are tagged automatically for pvp. So the player simply claimed it, found you on the map, and killed you with no slap damage since you were tagged for pvp.
---
The weapons and armor weigh much more than stimpaks. I like to pick up all the legendaries I get there and go through them all at once when I‚Äôm done. I don‚Äôt mind the current penalties I receive to being overweight but penalties much more severe than they are now would be too much. And yes I always have travelling pharmacy equipped.
---
Also what‚Äôs with all the downvotes on the original comment I posted?! That‚Äôs so disturbing.
---
Or how about just make bobblehead bonuses not stack? How fucking hard can it be considering 99.9% of people who farm them are doing so because they explicitly know they are broken, and can last infinitely, and want to abuse the shitty programming by bethesda.
---
&gt; I've got hundreds of hours on this game across multiple 50+ characters and I've seen one definitive bobblehead duper who was using it to chain farm the queen with 1 shots.
---
What the actual fuck? 50 characters? You duping man? or just muling for dupers? Who the fuck has 50 characters already? I've been playing since BETA and only have 3. Jesus christ you're up to no good
---
I'm sitting on an atom stash too. I figure there will eventually be something there that effects gameplay and I'll want that. But the paints and costumes have no pull on me. I'd also really like to see more floor and wall sizes, not just colors. I'd shell some earned atoms for that. I can't justify putting more money into the game at this stage.
---
Compared to me at 290. Hard to find people to play with.
---
I forget how many there are in the lab. If you‚Äôre lucky, there are five. At least four from what I can remember. 
---
I dont really care for the silly look so I doubt I'll be getting anything from this batch, but I dont mind them adding stuff like this because others do like it and I'm fine with them getting stuff tailored toward their likes sometimes.
---
Besides fallout has always been silly. 
---
I'm a level 50, and i saw a level 32, i decided to be nice give him stuff like this epic handmade rifle , but then he started nagging asking me to drop my tse shotgun so he could "check it out". So i realized he was trying to scam me out of my weapons. All i wanted to do was help the lower levels
---
What should i do? Even if it is i have no way of telling. Everytime you trade stuff in the bazaar theres a chance of a dupe. Just because the market is flooded with tse doesnt mean no tse is legit. And im surely not gonna let such a chance slide. It would took me weeks to get one probably. Only thing i can assure is that he hates dupers just like me and i wont trade or dupe it. I just want this weapon
---
Have you tried moving the CAMP box around, btw? If you haven‚Äôt: you can move the little CAMP thing around within your build circle as you would with any other piece of furniture. Your spawn location is tied directly to it, so you should move it around and test your spawn point. You might be able to free yourself from spawning underwater. :)
---
The PVP you experienced is outside of the workshop experience.
---
I can PVP shop owners without becoming wanted by walking up to their bench and claiming it. It opens a Capture The Hill green circle area and then i can even destroy their turrets without becoming wanted. Takes about 1 minute to capture, should include whole teams.
---
Reads like you experienced a really over powered cheater / griefer if he could kill you with slap damage. Surprised you got revenge at all.
---
For disconnects i think your team mate has to actually go to the shop to claim it.
---
PVP is not disabled for any events as far as i know. Be careful helping shops - 1 stray bullet and you're wanted. Also if you pick random locked containers.
---
To be honest this made me laugh
---
You get faster swing speed, but the DPS is better on two handed.
---
I‚Äôll try moving it. We will see what happens!
---
I still think you should be able to play the instrument weapons
---
You mean in addition to the weekly In the Vault updates to keep us in the loop of all things FO76?? Yea they just can‚Äôt be bothered
---
Very nice. Certainly a lot better than most of the hobo shacks I've seen. :P
---
You take that back! The only thing more West Virginian than "camo for no good reason" is buying Energy Drinks with Good Stamps!
---
Yeah, just make it so equipping the card gives the bonus to make it easier.
---
It does though. People were buying what they could before the patch because once duping is finally patched (and they clearly weren‚Äôt sure if it would be this patch so they did this just in case) prices are going to skyrocket because everything that is meant to be rare will actually be rare. Not as rare as it should be, but enough to make it worth more than it is now. Buying up good weapons means you don‚Äôt need to pay extra later on, and if you buy extras you can flip them later when those weapons are in demand.
---
As for why dupers would drop their stock, you‚Äôre assuming every duper on earth fully believes they‚Äôll be safe from the ban hammer, but that isn‚Äôt true. Some think it‚Äôs possible they‚Äôll get banned, especially with the rumours going around of that happening. There would be some dupers trying to save themselves by dumping all their illegal stuff.
---
guess I signed up for it.  I've picked it up multiple times, I have 3 in C.A.M.P but after the update all of a sudden I can't farm it anymore. not that it was that interesting aside from the Wendigo quest, I was going to give it to friends after shying them into playing. decade long fallout player, only recently started a survival run on fo4 so I wanted to try it as a challenge and a friend gifted it to me. didn't start playing til the second or third of this month. been disconnected mid-quest been disconnected after getting xp for a quest and the quest being marked completed and the xp taken away. I posted on here for the first time about doing the Fort McClintock quest objectives for over 2 hours before the servers resolved themselves. 
---
seems if I want to avoid issues to purchase on pc, so if I do make the purchase that's where it'll be. thanks for the input 
---
They're my favorite thing to take pictures of. I have a pretty decent one of protectrons fighting ferals, and the white springs staff fighting glowing ones
---
The mod listed above does that. 
---
I was talking about buying each mutation from a different player and having to hop in their servers to buy them. It may be faster if you find a playrr who sells all the 10 mutations you need otherwsyx you hop 10 servers for 10 players selling 1 mutation each.
---
Why would you post on Reddit to announce you‚Äôre a parasite?
---
It's tedious AF.  I often just skip it.
---
well, why would I need faster swings if the dps is lower? :)
---
On PC this list doesn‚Äôt work at all (for me at least).
---
So you want to be able to equip all perks at all times?
---
It also affects setting prices for items
---
Yeah pretty recently I got into an arguement with a guy on here that thought Runescape had never had a duping problem, along with Blizzard, Eve Online and others....had to show him that every single one of them had that problem at some point lol.
---
Nice. Do you spawn off the cliff?
---
Or you know, just people with different tastes. Sometimes it's fun to look silly during the apocalypse. Lighten up a little. 
---
very nice, well played!!  I really like the Power Armor Station room... that's some sex
---
playing kingdom come. waiting for content.
---
I'm still trying to pick up the shiny toy truck in the shack next to the WS station...
---
Well, since it wasn‚Äôt in this update, seems like it‚Äôs harder than making the Lever Action prof it‚Äôs reload animation per bullet.
---
It gives you a warning?
---
got all the way to those last poles to hop on, slipped off the 3rd pole and never bothered again
---
i got a jetpack since then but havent bothered to go back
---
I just had my first crash ever... thanks bethesda :/ 
---
I‚Äôve never fought 4 at once, but I have fought and killed 3 at once on at least 3 different occasions. First at Monongah workshop, later on at a location that I cannot remember, and the last time was at the Converted Ammo Factory.
---
They were tough but fun fights. (I would like to thank my 200% condition Lvl 50 T-51b power armor, I couldn‚Äôt have taken the punishment they were dishing out without you.)
---
I had two show up at the same time up there when I was giving a tour to a lower level player...
---
We had to pop on power armour hop all the way down to the red rocket so I could get them to land and kill em. The guy levelled a few times, but it was embarassing since I had no turrets set up there, as I thought nothing spawned there...
---
Just a warning. Lmao
---
I actually spawn right on the porch looking at the garage every time.  It worked out pretty great. 
---
I've seen this happen on a friend. His theory was that it was because he took a chem that increased endurance/max health. Once it wears off: pop goes the weasel. 
---
But I can't say that was the responsible part 100% of the time
---
How was this not found when testing?  After 5 minutes of play I found it.  
---
So, knowledgeable leader, do you have the knowledge on what rolls can occur on weapons/armor. I.e. is an unyielding, plus 1 str, and quicker so refresh possible for BoS unyielding combat armor? 
---
Stealth, there is bigger chance to be spoted with 2handed from my experience.
---
Thanks! Haha
---
I'm using a power fist. High damage and medium speed. The only disadvantage i have, i can't use it while wearing a power armor.
---
that cave is barf
---
It probably is a private cell gate.
---
Aw damn, there is no recipe for Calmex?? Go figure, that's the only chem I use lol
---
You hit twice as fast. Compared with a two handed, you hit twice as much. One hit with a two handed, takes as much time as two hits with one handed
---
Well just hug your mom and tell her you love her because the dupers are coming and nobody is safe.
---
I must be lucky. I‚Äôve seen so many posts about crashing but I‚Äôve played several hours most nights without crashing. I‚Äôm curious if time zone somehow plays a part.
---
I know people that do that... They're from Ohio though. Right on the Ohio River though so close enough. Lol
---
I mean, Nexus and Creation Club both had 10x better stuff for FO4 and that was from some random people on the ineternet.  
---
Sigh. Whatever. And then you'll say it's a random family photo... 
---
Anyone want to play a game of tragic the garnering!?
---
Ive had this happen several times and its annoying 
---
Having the same problem right now. I built the helmet at the headquarters, then tried to build the rest elsewhere when I got more materials, no luck. Fast traveling didn‚Äôt fix it, restart didn‚Äôt fix it, just stays greyed out. 
---
With 1h 40% faster swing + martial arts can hit twice before you can hit once with 2h, same with unarmed melee weapons (unarmed weapon yeah). But I usually bring a 2h melee just to one-hit kill some annoying mobs. Unarmed weapons benefit from various armor mods so there's that too.
---
Shame too as it‚Äôs an excellent source of ores, particularly iron and lead.  It‚Äôs also not as aggravating as running the RockHound. 
---
Unpopular opinion, but I feel that with the state of the game being as unrefined as it is, it has driven a lot of players away and those of us that are left would (for the most part) prefer to hold onto what player base is left rather than drive them away, and this is made evident by the level of altruism seen amongst each other. Yes the disconnects and crashes are anger inducing, but the overall feeling of live-and-let-live is very much present I feel.
---
Not the least bit true. I'm literally nothing but heavy weapon perks and they are trash compared to melee and auto rifles. 
---
I could kill a scorchbeast faster with melee than any heavy weapon can. Its a horrible build
---
Duping is an exploit obvs. so im not the one who has to fear them. They have to fear Bethesda. Bc of them Tse is in a weird state of desire and hate. 
---
I'd go for that. I miss decorating my place. I decked the hell out of my house in Megaton in FO3, shit was dope man. 
---
I got excited when I got a TS pipe weapon, but it was a bolt action :_(
---
Hats off to you.
---
I've seen people's characters load in where they died but they are not really there. I mean it looks like they respawned right there but the game doesn't respawn people exactly where they die. I call it their 'ghost'. It's really weird. 
---
‚ÄúI want you to know that I‚Äôm grateful for the time we‚Äôve had, father. You‚Äôve helped a boy achieve his dreams.‚Äù

Or have swappable configurations.

Yeah i hope they work on this. 
---
What ‚Äúlobby‚Äù?
---
I get the best loot from SBQ.  I nuke that fissure all the time and finally today I got a suppressor's lightweight explosive combat rifle.  It takes a few tries.  I have dropped or sold at least 3 three-star auto grenade launchers that were garbage.  I have kept maybe 3 pieces from my 10+ kills.  Just do as much high-level content as you can.  For all the legendaries I've gotten at Whitesprings, none compare ti the quality of SBQs and the other legendary scorched mobs she spawns.
---
My camp is in a high visibility area. I haven't been attacked by another player yet. However, I was building something for a friend and we were trading using dropped bags. Some rando ran in and stole his bag of flux (was building a radiation arch). He fast traveled out and we just watched the map for him to appear static. So yeah, that guy had his CAMP leveled and we stole his loot. Not sure what your problem is.
---
Instigating Bowie with Ninja maxed is murdering Super Mutant Warlords in one hut.
---
Instigating Bowie with Ninja AND 40% swing speed is murdering Super Mutant Warlords, the 3 muties next to him, and the mutie hound running in wondering why everyone is on the floor. In like 3 seconds
---
However first loading throw you into same world as before, though now you don't see what is killing you thanks to that second added loading screen... they call it an inovation.
---
Good luck....lol   There's no way to tell.
---
Just make sure you do caps or trades..........don't give people $$
---
If I was going to switch it would be to a gatling.  Only good legendary heavy I have other than an explosive mini.
---
the same thing just kinda happened to me. i finally got the fusion generator plan from powering up poseidon, so i was going to replace my old generators with the fusion. i scrapped 5 large generators and a small one. and when i went to build the fusion generator it says budget exceeded and the bar is full. i can't even build 1 generator or even a simple light. it's like it never removed the old generators from by old budget when i scrapped them. i tried relogging 3x and still maxed out. i can't even power my purifiers now lol.
---
I hope they hot fix this soon. 
---
Much like Junkrat in Overwatch, I never seem to learn this.
---
PvP isn't "ruined" by TSE. Yes it is a problem that someone can 1 shit you with almost 0 effort or cost. It is the weird rules and mechanics that create awkward situations where you bait someone into being get or get bait. If its none of these then its hide and seek with TSE yes. Also high level does not mean you always come out on top. The scaling can make it so low vs high lvl player get skewed in favor of the lowbi in some cases. Of course with TSE it will be less/not noticable. Don't get me wrong I really do not like TSE in 76 but in the singleplayers fallouts it wasn't a issue.
---
It just works.
---
Enlightenment I think, but I've never been able to get the event to show up.
---
Trying stashing all the materials. 
---
I always use heavy guns and with one gun army I get so many cripples and staggers on robots they never get a chance.
---
Jesus there is not much else to do in the game to be honest.   
---
Running in circles in WS farming for legendaries is not exactly riveting content and those RNG loot tables are completely broken and ridiculous. I've seen vastly more crap three star sickles, lead pipes and switchblade then combat rifles, handmades and revolvers. Once you spent 25 levels farming there is no end-game content and there is no real content that you haven't already done dozens of times before. It only becomes a case of being able to kill the same Bloated Glowing One that you have already killed 500 times before. There is no incentive to explore once the main and side quests are completed.   
---
The only real entertaining thing to do is pvp and its so broken that it is nonsensical.  
---
I can't imagine what the hell you actually do with this time if you are actually trying to engage with each other. I  am bored beyond belief with this game. It dreadfully needs fixing.
---
Man just 30 mins and already 2 crashes. Fucking Bethesda, do something about these dupers! 
---
&gt; two shot exploding quad double barrel shotguns

Holy crap I can't imagine. I have an exploding db shotgun and I just can't imagine having it be a two -shot quad. It's already OP

Ive got this problem with many different challenges i thought it had fixed because i made a new character and it finally ticked off that i discovered wavy willards proceeded to get the last one on the toxic valley list grafton dam been there on 3 characters now an still nothing, all this talk about cheaters, when were all being cheated out of atom points they wont fix this shit because they make silly amounts of money if you actually bought it instead of earning it its putting me off just wasting time on daft shit

Happens in every online game. You're just a better player than me? You must be hacking! Ego can't accept loss.
---
I have yet to see a single piece of sentinel armor in this game :(
---
Maybe it was the new Berry mentats effect that makes enemy's have light pink clouds around them when seen through walls
---
2 in Whitesprings, 2 in Watoga, 1 at Harper's Ferry
---
I hate when I kill a non-hostile (even if red), a little part of me dies on the inside. Then I have to track it down and at least loot the body and eat it so it wasn't a waste XD
---
They also had a lot more time. What's your point? Your opinion of what's better is going to be subjective. I actually really like that new power armor paint. I like the more serious ones too. It's ok for people to like things that you don't. You are not the have all end all decider of what is to be liked. 
---
You clearly have never used a heavy weapons build, stop trying to stir up trouble.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve found a few of the small robot models in the world and I just keep scrapping them since we can‚Äôt place em :(
---
Bad loot. bad xp. No one does them anymore.
---
Sigh. Dead game?
---
There's always some asshole playing in god mode. fucking pussies
---
That still wouldn't cause rendering issues because the amounts are still the same. You don't seem to understand how coding works. 500,000 carry weight = a massive amount of items in inventory. It wasn't 500,000 of a single item, like stims since they're 1lb a piece, it was anywhere between 100 to 1k per item. Which means there were thousands of items loaded into the pip boy and still no lag.
---
Your idea is really stupid. If someone legitimately finds and saves every bobblehead they come across, or any other item for that matter, you're essentially saying that person should be punished for saving it in their inventory. Duping doesn't hurt the game. If it does, my friends and I would have crashed multiple servers several times over
---
I'd play more often if they did that.  So tired of putting 2+ hours into workshops only to lose them over a random crash to desktop.  I get disgusted and don't log back in at all
---
Modders had more time/resources than a multi-million dollar company?
---
That's kind of sad.
---
I mean, BGS should at least copy and paste creation club content into this game so the Atom Shop isn't so pathetic.
---
Exactly, people who do this only make it harder for real hackers to be caught which is bad for the game's company and us.
---
The Fuck is a crafting mat?
---
Sorry. Lvl 76 and don‚Äôt know...
---
that's what the time stamp is for, you know, you hold a sign with todays date and the current time on it.... or just put my user name on a piece of paper

It's somewhat clever, with all the kids toys in the game containing lead paint.

Whenever I do this event I always make sure that who ever is with me is able to tag the legendary‚Äôs that appear. I know that many people who do the event are hunting for legendary‚Äôs  
---
I honestly haven't seen any sentinel armor in this game yet. Maybe I should buy some off someone
---
I'd guess toaster :)
---
I don't want to know how they inject them.
---
I hope this isnt true. I have never duped in my life. I have however crafted LARGE amounts of helms to sell to vendors cause it takes 2 rubber 1 glass and 1 something else, but sells for like 40 caps each. When I craft a few hundred I get a bit of server lag and I know this is related to an old duping method. I would hope I was not false flagged due to this alone, and instead they are searching for people who have thousands of bobbleheads or something.  
---
Alright, will do. In the meantime, you can try to add me first, Vrigoth.

I think we might meet on weekends

I also noticed some pink or red gas around my character while (re)building my camp

Yeah it's pretty pervasive, Fallout 76 Trade Hub discord has players trading around some fairly OP duped gear. Since they all duped all the caps they need, they have no interest in selling, so it's all about getting other pieces of broken gear. The economy is ruined for anyone that's not already 'in'. The best you can hope to do is get a god level item, and trade for a different god level item that's more useful to you. However, you're unlikely to get a full set since most of the dupers made alt accounts that just sit with stashes full of hundreds of thousands of nuka colas to provide practically unlimited caps, and they themselves have already duped their own armor to oblivion so they can trade for other pieces. On the one hand it 'should' be useless to them, but they are trying to limit the power of other players, except where trading away items is beneficial to them gaining more gear. To that end in fact I've noticed more of these players refusing to do one for one trades, they will only trade multiple copies of their high end gear for multiple copies of someone elses, but they tend to do those deals under the table since obvious dupe trading can get you kicked off of the discord server.

Fortnites comic favor and appeal I can guarantee is affecting the direction the ATOM store is taking. there are WAY more comedic, cute, jokey items on there than Badass ones.

I do this all the time, and so do most people i run into. I even go to the trouble of equiping a bad gun or unequiping ALL damage perks so I dont accidentally 1 hit.
---
Honestly even 100x of a single type is waayy to many for any non duper to have. 10x of one type might even be a stretch. 
---
But i completely agree with a script ban. 
---
Fuck these ppl idk why they are even on the game... maybe theyre the same kids that grew up using the game genie for everything and just dunno how to play without cheating.
---
I sincerely hope that yours is not an unpopular opinion.
---
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
---
The ones in the Atom Shop are ‚Äúclean‚Äù variants.
---
The flipside, I have met a few players who have their mic sensitivity so low, you can listen in on whole conversations, on their baby constantly crying for several minutes ... or a TV show running 
---
Atom bomb baby is my all time favorite from fallout 4. I have my own copy for ps4 but my sister has an Xbox so I'd like to give it to her instead. 
---
There's an exploit that allows you to go under the map. Look for an oddly placed cooking or other crafting station and use it. 
---
I do carry in the neighborhood of 850 stimpacks. It's vendor fodder for me
---
Thank you!!! Now to find a server where someone didn‚Äôt get there before me üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
best to use melee weapon and a power armor chassis. Even with no armor pieces the chassis is superior to anything else at that level. Also it gives a strength bonus which makes the melee much better. It helps because you dont have to be starved of ammo all the time.
---
Also if you want lvl 15 power armor pieces there is a raider camp to the west of the crocodile water park at the top of the map.
---
I don‚Äôt want to set the world on fire, because secretly that‚Äôs all I want to do 
---
Aren't you adding to the crying by crying about it?
---
fair enough 
---
It's sad they had more time? Do you understand how time works? Whatever dude. I like it. Your opinion changes nothing about that. The sooner you accept that people can like things that you don't the sooner you can get over yourself a little bit and be a better person. 
---
Explosive perks don't seem to affect ultrcite laser pistols. 
---
I made no oath other than to be logical and angry while expressing a love of video games. 
---
I feel ya. I'm still playing but with the constant disconnects I keep asking myself why. I can't really do anything. Take a workshop-- disconnect. Launch a nuke-- disconnect. Jump in the air, look at my inventory, craft something-- disconnect/CTD. 
---
If I could afford to buy some other game I would. Next time I get paid though, I'm buying something else. This is getting really really really bad. This game is garbage right now. For me. For my buddy. Some of my other friends are not having the same problems. But some are. And we are migrating away from the game.
---
I don‚Äôt care about you crying about cryers
---
You can't tame cats. Everyone stop getting your hopes up. 
---
Sounds like crying.
---
\^This! Being able to place any items we find in the world, into/onto our base, during our adventures would be perfect.
---
Pretty much still Whitesprings.
---
The problem is how do you categorise it? Let's say you crash at a nuke zone, what reason did this occur? What was the specific error? Perhaps there could be several, intermingled, reasons, how are these presented on the list or spreadsheet?
---
Also, what if people start deliberately exploiting something on the list that wasn't popularly known, in turn causing more instability? Maybe youtubers wanting to film footage to show off the bug?
---
Perhaps we could be given a % completeness instead. Just a simple "we're x amount through our list of problems, and at the current rate of change will be finished by y" to keep us apprised
---
Perhaps we could have 
---
Whitesprings golf club. legendary ghouls are everywhere. Hope that there aren't too many people
---
When people complain about the real problems, like dupers, will cry to subtlety drown out their very fears to discourage the actions against it.
---
I turned my X01 tactical red on inside my friends camp and his response was ‚Äúholy shit did the gates of hell just open up?!‚Äù
---
The hypocrisy and projection is this post is astounding.
---
This post adds to the conversation regarding the game Fallout 76 how exactly?
---
yes
---
Well. In a way I‚Äôm crying about people crying sure. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs up for discussion. What‚Äôs your opinion? Because let‚Äôs face facts we are all smart gorillas just shrieking into the jungle anyway. Does any of this matter really? 
---
&gt; I‚Äôve lost SBQ loot dozens of times 
---
Don't worry it was probably just an Ultracite Explosive Vent.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to unironically make it a 10+ min video, most of which is about how greedy BGS are whilst fishing for likes and subscribes!
---
Exactly
---
I have noticed this on PC personally.
---
I'm very very happy for you, that you can play without constant disconnects but some of us have it constantly. Discoes and CTDs and glitches galore. I had my weight fluctuate before my eyes while looking at my inventory (it was going up and down by 5 lbs, just up and down and up and down)-- I had my character unable to get out of 3rd person or move at all. I had ghouls just standing there, killable but not doing anything. I had long stretched out ghouls. I had enemies falling into the ground. I could go on and on. its like the game is eating itself and folding in on itself, it's disintegrating for some of us
---
does the level effect the yield , can i make a shitty level 20 arms and use them to mine , do i even need the whole suit
---
THIS!
---
I would add that the HUMOR of the Vault Boy videos and shorts where propaganda made by Vault-Tec to sell a product to people. The actual game itself is dark with occasional dark funny moments.
---
But wouldn't that apply here too?
---
Sadly you can't tame cats. Just didn't want you to try and be disappointed like many others. 
---
It surely was, or the Ultracite helmet again. 
---
It‚Äôs a typo.  It‚Äôs meant to be a plan for a 404.
---
I feel like I'm watching some science fiction movie where a world is destablizing and folding in on itself and shit is going really, really sideways
---
Now this is a shill post.
---
Same here, would be nice if we could ‚Äûrecombine‚Äú three cards to pick a new one
---
Or at least be able to downgrade cards
---
Or combine all three hack and lockpick card into one so it‚Äôs easier to swap 
---
Oh good, a douchebag duper chimes in. Thanks for nothing asshole
---
He was using some kind of explosive weapon, attacked my friends camp and then called some buddies. I died thought I was safe, oh well lesson learned. 
---
I am on Xbox, and I know where I'm gonna be searching tomorrow. Thanks!
---
I think it should be talked about because it IS a huge problem that ruins the game, but I also think that it shouldn't be the only thing that's talked about.
---
Too late for me,  I already sold my 300+ Bobby pins.   Did I say sell?  What I meant was dump.  ...there are much heavier things to sell.   :(
---
What annoys me is Fusion coils are 3lbs! I had to throw away 40 of them recently because they can't be sold to vendors.
---
Fuuuuuu
---
You only need the arms AFAIK, but the two arm pieces weigh more when out of a frame, so best to attach them to a chassis
---
That's not new, people have been doing it for weeks
---
Its ok, I went there twice now.  Once for the initial build and second for the upgrade to level 45 Excavator!   So... I did not learn it twice.
---
No but to have one key to equip all combat Perks or one key to select all explorer Perks or even one set for in camp and one set for outside.
---
Having to individually swap out my ammo maker, scrapper, super duper and weapon repair and armour repair when I've come back to base to scrap items, make ammo and repair gear doesn't ADD anything to the game besides annoyance. It doesn't improve game play. And as you can select the cards as you want there isn't any drawback like in earlier Fallouts where you had to pick and choose your skills. Now you just select that other one you can't have while you have the first one selected. 
---
first good lol of the day...nice.
---
I‚Äôm just asking for your thoughts. Just because I think something‚Äôs useless doesn‚Äôt make it useless. 
---
Projection seems like quite a stretch. I just play the game. I have three characters over 50. This is my favorite franchise. I‚Äôve never cared what others are doing honestly. I just do my thing. But I do constantly see people spinning themselves up like duper‚Äôs are ruining their game. I don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs annoying to me to see so many of you so overly mad. Like, why you so mad? Why can‚Äôt you just tell me about some silly shit or fun shit. I want to hang out and party in the game. 
---
That awful news bro, I'm glad you feel slightly better because of us group of nitwits
---
From what I‚Äôve heard it does. I‚Äôve searched literally everywhere and it apparently when you try to loot or even enter the room a message appears about the avoid the dark ones eyes for they are always watching and if you do it again you get banned. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve read from a few other subs 
---
I used to use them for the &lt;10 amounts with vendors once you had sold all of the other crap.
---
Had to throw away even more though.  
---
Too many beans. 
---
Yes that's what I meant, I'm not disagreeing. It's just that dupers are better at crying than those that are affected from their actions.
---
Dupers cry in self defense about how *pointless* it is to complain about an actual issue.
---
Why? What does "Oh well?" mean? It means nothing.
---
It was just a snarky and petulant comment because you had nothing to say. People saw it for what it was and reacted accordingly.
---
Oh okay I misunderstood, my bad
---
You should atleast be able to bind some to buttons for a sort of ability thing
---
Yesterday when i was farming there on xbox there were lots of other players in every server 
---
Apparently, that's a feature reserved for the future then.
---
The only monkey in this topic is you. Your idea is shit, your topic is trash and your iq is probably hovering around 30. They should hire you up in bethesda because this trash of a game have alot of people like you working on it, trying hard to ruin everything that was good about the series since original fallout.
---
The only thing nerfed was the ghoul's xp, still hella mob traffic there with lots of legendaries.
---
I downvoted your comment 
---
Oh because I just finished farming and there was no one lol. Guess I was lucky
---
I have this issue on PC, but ONLY on Stimpacks.
---
You can always change perk points around later and get more cards later. You can fix it if you made a mistake. You might just have wasted a few levels but no big deal.
---
Check your emails. 
---
where is that lvl 95 behemoth? 
---
It's been happening since online games began probably. I remember it being constant in cs 1.6/ source. Sure there probably wasn't a day I'd play those games without coming up against a player with aimbot/wallhacks on the servers I played on but usually the admins of the server would deal with it quickly.
---
Now there are people reporting others for chearing/hacking in games all the time and then others complain about the cheater/hacker they reported not getting banned, but for every legitimate report there are probably hundreds/thousands from salty people who can't take a loss. 
---
It just gets worse the farther up in lvl u get.   So much so that I have 30+ unpicked perks.  Have a 1-2&amp;3 of action boy can be useful for mixing and matching in agility, but I very much agree with you.  The problem is the perk packs always seem to give me either crap or something I already have, plus the animated cards won‚Äôt stack on top of non animated....makes for a mess.  
---
I‚Äôd like to be able to select say 10 cards and use them to fully upgrade 1 card...even with 5pip cards it‚Äôs still more than a 2-1 ratio. Mostly I‚Äôd just like the clean out my card collection.
---
I‚Äôd settle for being able to select any card I want and ‚Äúhide‚Äù it so that I can reduce a bit of clutter
---
I did but nothing 
---
The open window maaaaaaniiiaaaaaac!!!!
---
Well, could be cool, but also would most likely make all that junk lootable then. Unless it‚Äôs secret stuff. But if you can pick locks to other players‚Äô camps, workshops, etc, why not let you loot other players junk they leave laying around?
---
Now are we talking 50 Shades BDSM or Marquis de Sade BDSM?
---
i‚Äôm pretty sure i‚Äôve seen a mob at level 97, cant remember which one it was though. it was higher than the queen at least, i was really surprised to find it because i thought the queen was supposed to be the highest level mob
---
High level MMO Players are either holy saints or the spawn of satan. There is no in-between.
---
$38. Extra. Atomic shop is at like $1500 now. And 
---
Still no news on new content from Bethesda...
---
Like to see some evidence to support this.  Which perks could cause you to bypass slap damage or cause so much that it 1 shots (without TSE)?
---
I think it happened to everyone ahah
---
We are all dupers 
---
If you get actions taken against your account you'll have an email from Bethesda as well normally. 
---
If no email has come through I'd guess just normal server issues. 
---
The last level 250+ I met sent me a team invitation and destroyed my camp when I accepted it :(

I've encountered a level 97 glowing something something deathclaw. Literally killied me in two hits at level 110 in my modded xo armor.
---
This is my favourite piece of internet so far today üòÇüòÇ
---
It should be included as part of the wind instruments plan, really
---
Ok that makes me feel better but everytime I try to log in it says "connection times out"
---
1. Them fixing a duping glitch does not magically mean that duped items will be gone.  There's no reason a duper would do this in a "panic" before maintenance. 
---
2. 8 people surrounding someone on a single server trying to buy duped items is extremely unlikely.  There's plenty of people out there doing this that 8 people wouldn't need to swarm 1.
---
3. The two-shot Fatman still would not kill anyone if they were not already flagged PVP, thus he would not get a bounty.  It doesn't make sense.
---
4. As a general rule, if there's no video, it's probably fake.
---
Brotherhood of shame
---
Very true. Diablo 2 taught me alot
---
Glowing albino deathclaw? Think that's just 91 
---
You are totally right. It sucks for Bethesda too. They have to fix glitches, deal with complaints, spend tons of time sifting through thousands of reports of hacking or "hacking", and trying to find a way to resolve all the dupers and duped items. People are.complaining about how Bethesda can't fix glitches quickly yet they're the ones who slow it down because they're salty.
---
I understand you not giving a fuck.
---
Can you understand why I don't give a fuck about you not giving a fuck?
---
Just imagine if you hit a mob for 90% with 1 hit from a 2h, and 45% with a 1h, assuming that your 2h is twice as slow as your 1h you'd need 4 hits to kill 2 mobs with a 2h weapon but only 6 with a 1h weapon (the equivelant of 3 hits with a 2h)
---
I'll add you once I'm home from work. What is your time zone and normal play time? 
---
I initially did it because the area is pretty central in the map and the ground is leveled. I'm not big into the camp building, so my camps simple. I've wasted way too many caps relocating my camp, only to not be able to place it. So this area I prefer.
---
That would affect the server as well as their client and destroy everyone's experience.  
---
That and they apply to all your characters so you don't have to find them again with each character.
---
ahh ok, found a behemoth there too. But i‚Äòm not sure if he will spawn every time i change server, like the behemoth at solomons pond which is always lvl 50 (atleast for me)
---
Could have been but was definitely 97 I took a screenshot of it because it made me pause. I was hunting some one for their bounty at the time.
---
I‚Äôm lazy and put my camp on a junk pile...empty my extractor every time I come home and more often than not end up selling or dropping a lot of junk...it stacks up fast when u don‚Äôt use it
---
lack of content in the game.  once youve done all the quest and events, gotta make our own fun.  It's what the devs would have wanted us to do. 
---
I will need video proof of this.
---
Scary. I don't dupe but my gf and I have 3 accounts. 1 for her and 2 for me. One account is mainly just used so I can transfer stuff between my main and alt when she isnt online. Just have a level 2 on second account of mine, but will eventually use it for something.

looks like "He's the hero Charleston deserves"

Nah, cannibalism.
---
Nah, he is rare, I've seen him twice and I capture that workshop everyday since game came out. 
---
Where is this looking for group thing i keep hearing about? Id like to get more queens in
---
actually Whether being stacked or not has the same amount of coding, it probably uses specific coding to reduce and condense the multiple codes to create said stack. Even if it doesn‚Äôt, that doesn‚Äôt matter, since individual items have their own code, own names, and fill their own slots in the pip-boy. In just about every game I‚Äôve played, having a huge list of items on a list that wasn‚Äôt intended to have that many entities on it causing lag or frame rate while scrolling. Also, looking through this reddit post, there‚Äôs been, although very few, people who have suffered from not being able to open their pip-boy do to risking crashes, because the it can‚Äôt load all of the items individually.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but no, it‚Äôs not a QOL update. It‚Äôs a different genre of game so it‚Äôs designed differently. If someone likes it that‚Äôs fine but it‚Äôs far from objectively better. I could go into semantics about why that design in 4 works for a more story driven game or what they were going for in 76 but it‚Äôs honestly subjective. As it stands, it‚Äôs just a nuisance. No, we don‚Äôt need all the loot in locked things and it‚Äôs seemingly less special or unique than 4 or previous titles, but it‚Äôs a mechanic in the game that‚Äôs essentially held behind an annoying menu screen. If the game wants us to rotate builds and the incentive to level past max is to get more cards and try new stuff out then why is swapping so tedious? Not only do I need to load my pip boy to load my perk cards essentially doubling the loading time but we still also have no deck mechanic or any way to save ‚Äúbuilds.‚Äù It‚Äôs just a tedious menu chore for seemingly no reason behind poor UI design. In previous fallouts sure the perk ‚Äútook away‚Äù from points that could be combat but the games also gave you other means to progress and get that loot whether it be finding a key hacking a computer talking to the right person or sneaking in some back entrance etc. In this game there are just locked loot boxes with mediocre loot that we need to spend 30 seconds swapping cards to open.

A normal legendary is without stars. I had this too while testing at westtek. But after some time it was a multible star enemy again.

I¬¥m just writing down what i¬¥ve been seeing. I hope that the community will test this observation in a wide field to get us a better understanding of the game mechanics.

I use Watoga for my legendary farming, and I finally wised up after a while.  I actually kinda like the randomly timed explosion (aside from sometimes having to hunt everywhere for the bot) because there's 0 danger after you completed Mayor For A Day.

I thought this was widely known on how to do this. It just dosent look that great.

You can also put stairs inside the tree so it makes it look like your base is floating if you really want.

I have this problem with most of the steeped tea recipes...more than enough mats but get the ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù when I try to make.

Around your level id claim 4 workshops as soon as i logged in. Then proceeded to explore the world and fast traveled back to the workshops to defend them. I gained levels pretty quickly. You go through ups and downs. I found id snowball up to three levels then have a slump for a little while
---
That would be an amazing idea. Each card widens the area for lock pick or lowers terminal options. Great idea. 
---
Pro tip for getting the violet flux. I can't remember what most of the plants give you, but if the Fissure Prime site is nuked, Mutated Ferns give the violet flux and they all spawn in groups around the leafy trees that are on their own or in small groups. Also equip Green Thumb for double the loot. Makes it easier knowing I can go straight to these things if I'm strapped for time or ammo.

Timezone is CET (UTC+1), I usually play from 5 PM to 11 PM, with a 30-60 minutes break for dinner somewhere around 7.30PM. I do not play each day, but most. 
---
On weekends, if nothing planned, I play from 12 PM to 12 AM, with a few breaks here and there.
---
So for you, if I'm not mistaken, that would be from 10 AM to 4 PM with a break around 12PM. And 5AM to 5PM on weekends, I guess :)
---
# Condolences, and thank you for this very classy post sharing your sentiment.
---
you get 1 SPECIAL pt in each category at Lvl 1. thats 7 plus 1 pt for each level to level 50 thats total 56 SPECIAL pts. You get to pick a Perk card very level forever with a pack give to you each 5 levels (4 free random cards).
---
At level 51 you can choose to redistribute a Special pt from one Category to another (ie -1 to str and +1 Luck) or pick another Perk Card.
---
Thats the basics.
---
As for Mobs they tend to pop in an area based on the level of the player that enters that area. You likely entered an area that a level 40 or so was recently in. there area some other rules regarding level ranges in certain area but that a basic lowdown.
---
Increased attack speed for one hander, increased base dmg for 2 hander.
---
Really just feels like playstyle preference to me
---
I use martial artist, with incisor, with gladiator combined with my armor piercing increased power attack dmg Bowie knife and just Merc about anything including scorchedbeast in seconds.  The pain that combo inflicts on glowing one once I add the perk that increases dmg against them becomes hilarious
---
Im imagining that xD
---
You are correct.  I will edit.
---
Hellooo cake day
---
I never litter Watoga with little paper bags everywhere...
---
Ah, but did you know that legendary sentinels trigger not one but *two* subsequent desolations? 
---
Like market bombings in the Middle East. 
---
First to create havoc. Second to kill whoever comes running. 
---
Yeah!
---
were they bought from other player?
---
You are spot on, As a level 290 who‚Äôs fully geared I spend more time being the tank in my PA at white springs for random 30-60s. Plus I try to keep spare level 1 hazmat suits on me to give away.  Incase I see someone who wants in but can‚Äôt. 
---
I need them to get geared and leveled if I‚Äôm gonna feel good about murdering them for their workshop.
---
Scrap them
---
Why?  There‚Äôs not a whole lot good there unless you need tons of concrete. Hemlock Holes is better for acid and Spruce Knob is best for gold.

I'm sure our paths will cross at some point

Opposite side of my camp at the map, saves me fast travel fees
---
Having the same experience and sometimes my load times are insanely long now. Things don‚Äôt seem much better overall, just different.
---
Are you sure? I was under the impression that I could get 8. Will test again. 
---
When I am doing uranium fewer, I usually kill all enemies as they spawn but legendaries I hit once and wait for others to do the same, but I get very annoyed when I am only one actively repairing those three mining thingies. And that happens a lot.
---
And no one cares at all about this little rant of yours. Such is life.
---
The heavy Leather can be modified with studded to get to 40/66 damage resist.   I have not found any non-legendary in game yet with better Physical/Energy resists.
---
Same on PC.
---
Dude, I've played 400+ hours and have only seen that vendor once...  Putting your base there when you KNOW it prevents spawns is small penis energy.
---
Okay hit the xbox button, bump over to Multiplayer. Start a Party, invitations, Looking For Group and Tournaments are listed. Hit LfG, Search or Create post then choose ya game. :)
---
Yeah, this is definitely old news. Still looks bad too. 
---
How long does loading take for you? It‚Äôs like a 1 second animation of looking at the pip boy. Even accounting for all the time it takes over time and doubling it for changing the perks back when finished the effort saves you more time in the long run by cutting down on cap costs/increasing rewards/higher trade value. 
---
Lockpicking/hacking in other Bethesda games are usually locked for the entire game, totally inaccessible, if you don‚Äôt take the perks. This game is way easier in that you can just swap in the card. You seem really down on the rewards from these so why complain/bother? In any other game you‚Äôd just opt out of lockpicking if the rewards weren‚Äôt worth it, so just do that. 
---
If it‚Äôs so consistent of a problem, why not make permanent room in your build for the perks? Then you solve this whole problem. Don‚Äôt bother with hacks, run lockpicking/fast travel perks, and put on hard bargain only for vendor runs or buying important shit. 
---
Exactly this.  I have so many challenges that are bugged and don't reward atoms.  Negates the whole argument of the game throwing atoms at you.  The game gives enough for a PA skin and some camp items.  
---
After that it's a grind with it taking 2 weeks to earn about 750 atoms.  When these challenges aren't completing because they are bugged, it's beyond frustrating.  
---
I usually wait a second, chill, listen to tunes and emote behind them and if I someone doesn't move after a while I just poke them to let them know there's a queue. If that doesn't work, slap damage kill it is. 
---
Thank you!!!
---
all I want is for Bethesda to let me adopt the baby
---
No problem bro
---
Alright, cheers mate
---
Well, there will be another banning method that destroys their accounts :) hopefully. 
---
Some say the book is a pathway to many issues some consider unnatural. 
---
Unless you were making racist or otherwise nasty area voice chat remarks, nothing stated would be considered wrong. Unless you used the bobblehead cheat to one shot and spawn kill, that maybe bannable but unlikely.
---
I saw! And the mod that shows you what plans you have whenever you're in a trade!  OMG so nice.  I'd like to see some stability stats of PC vs console though before I convert.. I suspect PC is a bit of the wild west.
---
I usually get one UC body part, UC Explosive vent (almost every time), and some prime plan. 
---
Why the explosive vent seems to always be in the list I don‚Äôt know.  There are some useless prime plans too. Pipe revolver?  Really?  I‚Äôm going to hunt SBs with a pipe revolver?
---
Plus they increased fusion core makers back up to 8 per hour
---
I'd even be happy to pay a few caps to amalgamate them, or even atoms to buy the upgraded card.
---
They think I'm lying lol

We never killed the guy but we messed up his base so I felt bad and messaged him to ask if he wants me to rebuild his base

No, and I think they should change the perk cards for passives and decks. I don‚Äôt agree with you or anything you‚Äôre saying and I shouldn‚Äôt be locked out of content nor downvoted or denied my point of view because of how confident you are it‚Äôs better and totally fine, thanks though.
---
This also happens on PC :/
---
Or have a minimum SPECIAL stat prerequisite but cost zero points 
---
Best stability in a long for me. I was on right after servers came back up. Was able to complete Scorched Earth 4 times without issue. No odd health glitches, minimal lagging, 0 disconnects. 
---
Only issue was she got stuck flying in one spot and wouldn‚Äôt land. 
---
(From memory, hope this is right): Standing at the end of the tennis court on the opposite side of the clubhouse, with your back to the clubhouse, you can see the top of the open gazebo, with a minaret at the top, slightly to your right, in the foreground with the Whitespring main garden &amp; entry beyond it. Within the gazebo, look for the drinking fountain: It's labeled "Sulphur Fountain."  And yes, it really does cure disease.
---
Don't know what's worse, a guy creating fake accounts pretending to be his parents or a middle aged man playing video games.
---
Nah, look for yourself
---
i just wish they'd add a clean suit to the shop. ie Clean tan suit, or something similar.
---
as well as a Chinese stealth suit. (non functional of course).
---
Maybe the 230+ upvotes are the ones that like it? Maybe? And it‚Äôs nice to know that you need to result to such heavy insults to try to ‚Äúput me in my place‚Äù, which is also a laugh.
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worse. 
---
Because I get the load screen, then I‚Äôm in the game with everything around me missing and I can‚Äôt move and then it goes into another load screen and then finally i can play. 
---
Do you have an email about you getting banned? 
---
If not reinstall the game.
---
Thats purely a technical issue. 
---
Im sure you're not banned ...at least for now.  If you keeps destroying others camp without a good reason .... You might end up getting banned for "griefing". Mark my words "justice shall be served".
---
I literally lost my hardened two shot handmade cos I couldn't do this (long story)
---
Even when I find the sentinel ones, they sometimes don't explode.
---
&gt; Edit: I‚Äôm betting most downvoters will be sympathizers or duper‚Äôs themselves. But that‚Äôs fine by me.
---
Or they don't like the impact such a suggestion would have on legitimate players. Many of us have hundreds of legitimate Bobbleheads total on our storage mules that we found ourselves.
---
I guess anyone opposed to throwing accused Witches in wells to see if they drown are themselves Witches?
---
Get over yourself, people don't like your suggestion because it's bad.
---
Well that's what lockpick card does (hacking just does a useless "reduce lockout time"). Just yeah, it'd work so much better, you just gain the ability to do lockpick/hacking at the normal unlock level and equipping the card just gives the other effect if you want it.
---
Anyone put a scortched killer receiver on a lever action rifle and it not showing up as a star for legendary? Its fukn annyoing n i dont think it activates doing 50% more damage to scortched
---
I don‚Äôt ever downvote on here. I‚Äôm simply pointing out that lock picking and hacking are specific types of content that Bethesda games typically do lock players out of for not actively investing in. The company has a long history, and now it‚Äôs better. You have every right to an opinion, but if you‚Äôre expecting a change to a system they‚Äôve used for 10+ years, you‚Äôre probably gonna get disappointed. 
---
Sure it should be a topic. And surely one that does need to be fixed. But for fucksake it feels like the only thing that is talked about sometimes. And no one has been able to convince me it‚Äôs a HUGE problem. It‚Äôs an annoyance maybe. But I just keep doing my own thing. Might log out and back in to a new server if someone‚Äôs shitting on it or wrecking my camp again or whatever. I‚Äôm on PC so maybe my mileage varies but I don‚Äôt see all the crashes and disconnects. Like, why are you guys so damn mad? I don‚Äôt get it. 
---
Could be worse like spending 30-40 minutes farming nuke zone for mats and going to realize your 2 lbs overweight, so the easiest thing to do is jog over to the PA Workbench and crap all your junk right?  Will save you plenty of room...  Bye bye Hardened Mass.   Prior to the patch, I think I wasted so many H-Mass this way over and over...
---
Not applicable to myself, my camp still takes ten seconds to load in
---
no u 
---
I'm gonna kill pretty much everything with one swing of 1h, then kill his buddy too while you're just dropping your first guy with a 2h.
---
Now if I use a weapon that say heals on every hit..
---
This needed to be said. Seems like too many people are busy policing everybody else instead of just getting on with it.
---
I have always been a game helper not a griefer, its just my style. You have to decide what YOU want to be.
---
As for what you did I think you are ok likely just connection problems. I would not message him any more as that "could" be considered harassing.
---
hope you get back on soon and return to the Light. Purge the Darkness my son!
---
video or it didn't happen
---
Heh, that is kinda unique.  I want to try this out.
---
Then why‚Äôs there 250 upvotes? And tell me without insulting the player base.
---
I absolutely understand. I posed the first anti-fuck. Yours is welcome as well. But do you have an actual opinion or discussion point? 
---
Plant the seed that will be harvested later. They're farming legendaries, you're farming them.
---
Brilliant.
---
Picking up the plans isn't enough, you have to go in to your inventory and click on it in order for you to learn it. If you've done that and it's still not showing up as a craftable item, perhaps you've got it set on "Toggle buildable objects" but you don't have the parts required to craft them?
---
He had 4-5 posts in the last week....hardly managing the community....
---
Honestly it's really overpowered on the build. I spec my guys for max damage and have 3 builds on falloutbuilds.com ; I run class freak because I have so many mutations on both. (The last one I am opting out so that i have to actually use stims etc. \[no marsupial or others\]) - It really depends on how you want to play; you can make due with either playstyle, and the one that is more fitting will be more fun for you. I enjoy running cannibal and no healing factor on my non-PA gunslinger. My VATS rifle build one shots everything from a distance so I never lose more than 20% health; I maybe hit 50% in the queen fight - I make sure to burn all adds as they pop up for max exp and to prevent the most damage. The other build is PA heavy gunner with Dodgy and he never goes past 90% even v.s. Super Mutants. Both builds run adrenaline so they just start mowing things down. I know it's been said - if you are going to take Healing Factor, I would factor in +3 luck for 3/3 Class Freak and go all out. The thing that sucks, is it is all chems, even Rad-X/Rad-Shield. So, plan ahead!  : ) 
---
Lucky you, I stopped claiming workshops because of this. Not only me, its been a big issue for many players
---
Yeah I've noticed this happening too ( ps4)
---
Items always dropped in a brown bag, no?
---
I level these bases and its becoming more frequent. Its dumb, you want tags? Use a tesla rifle for maximum efficiency. 
---
They need to restrict the build area so no one can build on the grounds at all.
---
Is C.A.M.P not part of the game? Or are they just not playing the game the way you want them to?
---
Edit: I‚Äôm betting most downvoters will be sympathizers or duper‚Äôs themselves. But that‚Äôs fine by me.
---
Calls people who think his suggestion is bad "sympathizers or duper‚Äôs themselves". That's not "perfectly pleasant" at all.
---
All.
---
Night.
---
Long.
---
So 32 seconds with 31 seconds of foreplay
---
Maybe there is nothing to show yet ?
---
I'd add my "share":
---
**Boost-crafting.**
---
A: Level up both "Fix it Good" and "Weapons Artisan" perk cards as soon as you can. If you need to repair some piece, equip corresponding card before (armor or weapon) . This will increase durability of your repaired item considerably, making it last up to twice as much.  
---
B: Intelligence stacking crafting. If you're into larger crafting session (for example, need to craft higher level power armor (x-01 or excavator etc), boost up your INT as high as you can. Munh that Berry Mentats for +5 INT, get a "Brain Fungus" soup (brain fungus is available in pretty much every cave) or maybe broiled Scorchedbeast brain (+3 INT). If you have any "unyielding" type of armor, equip it, lower your health (just radiate yourself or drop from height). The higher your INT, the higher condition item will be. If you're over 25+ INT, there's large change the crafted item will be with 200% or near condition.  
---
FIX:
---
**TSE Shotgun**: this is not how it works. TS (Two Shot) adds another projectile. Shotgun shoots pellets (for example, Combat Shotgun shoots 7 of them). TS will add just a single pellet, making it NOT that favorable prefix for Shotgun. There are better prefixes out there for explosive shotgun. For single bullet guns, sure, that's different, as it's technically double damage (except VATS, as "second shot" accuracy is way worse than main projectile).  
---
**Explosive Automatic build**  
---
This build is based upon "bullets explode for area damage" legendary affix and will work well with nearly any automatic type of weapon. Either handmade, combat rifle, any submachine gun, automatic pipe rifle, even 10mm automatic pistol would work. The main thing here is a) being automatic (fast fire rate) and b) low recoil and easy handling. While Shotgun fires shells (with multiple pellets per shell), it's fire rate is slow: 1 shot per second or longer (considering reload). Automatics can fire multiple rounds per second and can have larger clips, narrowing the gap purely by fire rate. The idea is the same, stack Demolition Expert perk (Intelligence), stack required perk (Commando for autorifles and SMG-s, guerilla for 10mm auto-pistol). The one advantage for automatic explosive build, is better teamplay ability. Lower per shot damage means many enemies will not die in a single hit, making experience and loot sharing a better experience. It's especially more useful for "carrying" someone lower level in higher level area. Just learn to single-tapping. Many autorifles are deadly accurate with single-tapping and have higher range than shotguns. If you run in a team, "two shot" prefix is actually not recommended. 
---
It's most likely that the loot table just decided to change suddenly, have also seen lots of legendarys just disappear into the ether in front of me :( PC
---
Not on FO4, when you dropped an item it would simply fall to the ground and you'd be able to pick it up and place it where you want by holding the X button (PS4) on the item.
---
No, you would just have a team of people swapping into those cards when the rare moment of needing those perks arises. People aren‚Äôt gonna give up +60% dmg or any other useful buff so they can immediately access a locked door once in a while.
---
YMMV, but I fought the SBQ 8 times today with a group of 6 and every time at least one person crashed out. Also plenty of issues with the silo (mostly the mainframe cores and DC/crash). The load screens are somewhat false. If I try to open my pip boy my character will lock in place until the world loads in. Other times I'll get 2 load screens and everything is fine.
---
The game seems to run better on the standart ps4. My brother and a friend both have the pro too, all uf us played like 300h+ and they had way more issues than me, heard that from other ps pro players too. Optimizing the game for the pro seemed to be more of a problem than for the regular ps4
---
You're right.  I will edit.
---
I just want the power arnors from new vegas, just that.
---
You can turn that awful clunking PA noise off and I agree that it would be great for this perk to be used outside of PA. I'd really like to play the game outside of PA but I really don't want to lose them perks for my beloved 50 cals.
---
What about completely legitimate storage mules at over 100k weight already?
---
Is fun a good reason ?
---
You gotta grab your loot fast, otherwise the explosion is going to blow the ragdoll corpse miles away.
---
I have never been able to remove the support for a roof. It has to have at least one support point. Even the metal posts won‚Äôt support it which is aggravating. 
---
Reconnect feature would be great, especially if it would allow you to keep control of your claimed workshops.
---
You're correct.  I'll edit the post.
---
lmao thats ridiculous! haha
---
I find foleplaying shirlock homes helps.
---
So I shot the ghoul here and it fell backwards down that hill.
---
No body but a car that has recently exploded, which would have forced it back towards my initial position over my head and on to that roof.
---
Ahaha!  There is the 3 Star legionary body...furious rolling pin
---
I noticed this and I'm grateful for it. No more 10-20 second freeze standing around like a lemon when the game loaded.
---
What is animal friend for then ? Pretty sure I‚Äôve already seen someone‚Äôs screenshot with a tamed cat at camp
---
Nope, no teddy bear room this time.
---
Whoa watch your tone white knight. What i meant is that availability of TSE weapons doesn't hurt anyone. Duping process fucking over servers of course does.
---
How did you do this? Was trying to do this the other night. 
---
The disease called cooties :(
---
I have over 10 of all Bobbleheads on my Storage mule (besides Leader, since I use those) that I found myself, why should I lose my Bobbleheads?
---
Given this is an online game, and items dropped in the world would have to be tracked by the server, this includes any positional data, however physics of objects is client based only. An objects physical position at your end may not necessarily be the same position as on my end
---
Yeah, have this setup since launch, allowed me to place the camp almost anywhere. Doesn't look OK though.
---
Do you routinely check the inventories of vendors? Always check the weapons and armor sections of vendors, *particularly* the ones frequented by SBQers (Watoga merchants), Uranium Fever players (whitesprings train) and whitesprings farmers (artisans corner in whitesprings). 
---
Assemble a one-star wardrobe/arsenal of your favorite weapons, and gradually start swapping with 2-star and 3-star as you encounter them.
---
I‚Äôve done so with a large bloodied arsenal, a large unyielding wardrobe, and religiously collect all weight reduction pieces I collect this way. 
---
Mod them for ultra-light for efficient storage. 
---
Any mechanic that makes you want to ignore game content is a poor mechanic, imo.
---
So they have to make cards not switchable? Most of build dont request all card slots, so you can sacrifice few for your team. 
---
yea i wanted mouth harp and also a specific drum that ive only seen at the morgantown airport but they dont seem to be buildable..... so mad
---
not possible for now, most likely due to too many player based items per server :/        
---
       
---
when farming trasure maps I accidently crashed a few servers just by dropping like 200-300 **different** weapons &amp; armors in a paper bag - my friends lost connection too...      
---
      
---
So for now servers are way to unstavle to handle more player placed objects.
---
I've seen it go the opposite way. Early on, people didn't want to get wanted for any reason and it was stressful feeling like you have a target on your head. Now we have players 200+ that don't want to lose 200 caps per death so they just blow up any camp they find for a 5cap bounty so they can pvp on the cheap. People are getting bored and restless, people are hitting max caps without even trying and the most fun way to give away caps is to get a high bounty and see who tries to kill you. 
---
Yes, Grape mentats, thanks!  I always look for one beginning with "G"
---
At least from what i can see they Frenzy enemies, meaning they will attack nearest creature, friendly or not.
---
so having a couple on hand can be nice when you get swarmed.
---
Okay, fair points. Erk hem. Point 1. Some people, not all, thought the update was going to get rid of peoples duped stuff that surpassed their carry weights. It was all over LFG and people were selling stuff stupid cheap. (I saw serums being sold for 2 caps on there). 
---
Point 2. I've seen it a few times. Okay 8 people at any one time is a lot but loads of dupers/people selling duped resources etc. have had huge queues at their stores. Look on twitch, I'm sure you can find a guy on there whose had stupid amounts of players at their shops. 
---
Point 3. You are 100% correct. My two shot fat man did not kill a single person there. Nore did I claim that it did. The bounty was for the damage on the guys shop.
---
Point 4. You've never known anyone to attack a dupers shop? It happens. Not that uncommon. But yeah I suppose with no vid it can seem like bs. I'm sorry you feel that way, have a nice day. :)
---
I‚Äôve seen this post almost everyday since I had the privilege to play this magnificent game on launch (and haven‚Äôt touched it since) maybe it‚Äôs about time to move on 
---
Lucky. Nuke zones are the ones that cause me the most issues. 
---
I‚Äôve also learned to quit scrapping assaultron heads after launching. For some reason I crashed pretty much every time (before the patch). First time it happened I was solo and launched on prime. Couldn‚Äôt get back to the server. Nuke hasn‚Äôt even landed yet. 
---
Angry logic. Lol
---
Nuke mine at feet then nuka grenades caused vendor to die then reboot kinda neat forces people off vendor...Xbox it works...
---
Saw it a couple times on xbox.  Almost like it connects then goes to the second screen to catch up.  Whole game was a mess tonight.
---
Why is it fun to wreck other people‚Äôs stuff? Would you like it done to you? What sort of pleasure do you get out of upsetting others? Why is this ‚Äòfun‚Äô?
---
Had this happen to me except it was a random scorched. At first I thought it was maybe a super mutant suicide, but nope it was a scorched with a protest sign.....
---
Has anything happened to that character? Stuff removed or anything like that? 
---
So I started a new character cuz I was using my beta character as my primary character and thought that the achievements would pop up once I get the main game. I get to a point where I try to meet Rose from the top of the world location. I finish her quest (forgot what it was, think it was installing a signal repeater or rose syringe experiment?) And I get plans for raider legs. Don't know where to get the arms and torso but I got the legs.
---
Pretty sure it's on the north east side of the map in the mire. 
---
That dense+fireproof thing is an excellent tip... thank you sir/madam. Time to spec 2 points into end.
---
I'm on Xbox, and it is the same as before. I walk in to a building, start walking, and a few seconds later in back at the entrance.
---
It's still happening... 
---
Not saying that at all.  ARK was one of the most played games on Steam a while ago.  I personally do not consider it an AAA title.   But I think the question was provide 1 game that is more broken than Fallout 76 using exploits.
---
Yeah I am learning them also but still no show, have all the junk and required parts to craft. Also know about toggling etc go it‚Äôs not that, I‚Äôm hoping they show after re-logging
---
Most stories I've seen on Reddit were stories about helping people and being nice, and they inspired me to do the same. Simple things like reviving a stranger while doing an event, or escorting low level around Whitesprings, or dropping some ammo and water to a new player are one of the best moments in the game.
---
nobody i know uses chems, surprisingly. 
---
Remind me tomorrow. :)
---
Hi. After my experience falling inside said pit and lost my loot I figured that if you spawn close by you can get it.
---
Find some loot such as a weapon, armor piece, food. Drop it close by where your bag is and the bag should teleport up to your recently dropped item. 
---
Not sure about the distance though, but this works unless they changed it.
---
I got an explosive flamer , not sure how that works, but I haven‚Äôt been able to use it much since ammo is so scarce
---
I mean this doesnt really bother me but I get it, what if as a solution/compromise make it so we can only switch while in *our* C.A.M.P. or something
---
I play on PC, and I'm also enjoying the improved load-in.  Much more stable.
---
I participated in an SBQ today and it was the fastest I'd ever done ever.  There were like 4 players there, all lvl 120+ and it took us less than 5 minutes to smash the queen.  Here's me running into the blast.  The queen was dead like 6 minutes later.  [https://imgur.com/Ha85LdJ](https://imgur.com/Ha85LdJ)
---
I dont mind the explosions personally but it's really irritating when I kill one legendary then it blows up and the robot body flies to somewhere unknown and you miss out on the legendary loot...
---
AP refresh speed and +1 Strength are both Major modifiers, so no, that combination is not possible. You get up to one prefix, on major, and one minor modifier. See this link for more details on Legendary Effects:
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
yep, just seen a few people saying that diluted doesn't effect mutations so I thought I'd try it out myself and lost marsupial hahah
---
If your on Xbox Im always listen in üòÄ DreadfulTurkey
---
Shhhh don't make me look like i don't know everything
---
You're joking, but it's true. I felt so cool back then with my normal lever action using vats until I realized a friend of mine that was 20 levels lower than me was doing better because of his gear. :(
---
I hear ya. It was funny to drop mini nukes on em but it didn't solve anything. If people can exploit the game then they will, hands down. Bethesda are responsible for sorting it and can't expect everyone to just ignore glitches and exploits if they're available. Agree with ya on that one.
---
On PC, I noticed a weird thing where after it's done loading, but then it stays in the loading screen and the color changes on the loading screen picture (usually turns heavily black/purple) and waits a bit loader before putting me in the game. I've still had instances of being unable to move/run, having my body missing, or not being able to use my gun for a bit after loading though
---
This was a nice read, thank you for sharing your experience :)
---
Same. I don't know if it's a bug or feature. Maybe they wanted to show is more default loading screens and our camera roll?
---
Thank you so much for this. I have seen this behemoth once and I remembered it being larger than the one at Twin Lake, but no one would believe my encounter with it
---
If you have a workshop you are a PVP target anywhere on the map.  Not just in the workshop area.
---
This is better than being immobilized and vulnerable for 30 seconds upon fast travel or log in. More screenshots to view and tips to read never hurt anyone, but fast travel lag has. 
---
And I believe if you have voice chat off you can't hear others
---
Apparently you know how to farm them, so what's the problem? Greed?
---
If it's asking you to reinstall that happens sometimes. Just click install and make sure it goes to the same path. It takes like 5 seconds. Happens to me sometimes.
---
Wanting to ignore content and being prohibited from accessing it all are very different. In a play through of fallout 3 you could theoretically run out of skill points and be unable to pick entire sets of locks for the entirety of the time you play on that save file. Same for NV, but you could sorta get past this with magazines. In fallout 4 you‚Äôd have to spend perk points raising special stats and then unlocking all hacking/lockpicking which just doesn‚Äôt work for some people until you reach unreasonably high levels (4-7 levels required for one skill depending on special distribution) . In 76 the only difficulty is that I sometimes have to open my pipboy for a few seconds. 
---
They‚Äôve continually lowered the bar and made more content available. They‚Äôve gone from skill point based to perk based, reduced the number of difficulty levels by 1, and let you change the perk for something useful when you don‚Äôt need it. In a game that has basically become an inventory management simulator it‚Äôs hard to justify being upset about a few seconds of changing perks to access anything I want. 
---
Artillery can‚Äôt hurt you if you‚Äôre Inside...with the ghouls
---
Same to all 100-200 level \*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* who do not have patient to wait 30 seconds so low level newcomer can sell some trash. How can someone buy few stimpacks if getting shot in back while doing so? This is it?
---
They probably have a character limit on their blog posts. 
---
Someone talking about hackin' and whackin' and smackin'? 
---
Same here, I thought either the game was borked or I was having driver issues at first.
---
Lol, then apparently not. I know PC already have a new one. 
---
Had this happen with a mole rat.
---
You know the drill op.
---
My favorite is always fallout 3 when I dont want to set the world  on fire plays. Though when I'm wearing hellfire armor I change to to I do want to set the world on fire.
---
Doesn't stay that way if you die before you pick it up. E.g. if you happen to get killed under way to your 'death point' by a third party (whether human or NPC), it'll refer to your new location, and your old death location gets lost on the map so it'll be hell to find your bag of junk back.
---
Wow you‚Äôre great! It sounds like sentinel is a minor modifier so it could appear on unyielding armor. Awesome !
---
They stopped caring about the game before it even released. It's been in maintenance mode since it started, only remaining "active" as long as people keep purchasing overpriced garbage from the ATOM store.
---
I have t-45 hydraulic bracers, t-51 nika cola paint, and pretty sure I have raider motion assist servos. 
---
As for mods I have t-60 emergency protocols and excavator Tesla coils
---
We cannot. 
---
This is likely because they intend to have Atomic Shop items or bundles to serve this purpose. Decorations in this game are limited to the very limited amount of plans you (or a friend can learn) to craft at your bases.
---
Because different people think different things a good. I think the idea is bad, which is why I downvoted it.
---
My issue was with you suggesting that those who do find your suggestion bad are "sympathizers or duper‚Äôs themselves".
---
Do what Diablo 2 did back in the early 2000's.  Each item generated has a specific ID.  When that ID is duplicated and shows up in any game with another item of the same ID, all of the items except the original would disappear.
---
Definitely can tell a difference on Xbox one x. 
---
I replaced it after the game replaced it, to get it replaced by the game on the next startup üòÖ
---
I already put the work in to get them, why should I have to do it again?
---
So, to clarify, if the other player doesn't try to claim the workshop, then you are not in PvP and slap damage applies, even if you are both in the workshop capture zone. Correct? He was pretty close to me, was maybe in the capture zone, but the capture zone was not active (i.e. he had not attempted to try to take the workshop). So, I guess this was a case of a TSE shotgun griefer with stacked explosive bobbleheads. He also became wanted, so I assume that's because he damaged the workshop's benches without first starting a capture.
---
I'm not sure how we were able to kill him. Maybe he had good offensive stuff, but not a set of assassin's + sentinel + dense + fireproof on. He was standing still, but was staggered by my Tank Killer or by my teammates shotgun, so maybe that cancelled the sentinel effect. Anyway, one clip (15 rounds) from my TSE semi-auto pipe rifle and then my teammates TSE shotgun and they were both down.
---
Thanks for the reply and the clarification. We have four of us on now and are going to do some testing of the workshop PvP mechanics to confirm how they work. I'll post my results here after testing.
---
Well, you have some good points here. Still, I do not agree with the price skyrocketing part.
---
Everything that meant to be rare is not rare at all \_already\_. And it will be this way if the devs won't reset duped items count to 0 across the board. Lots of people here (me included) saw literally thousands of rare guns, serums and hundreds of thousands crafting mats in dupers' inventories. It would be hard to believe that something would skyrocket in price that already exists in quantities that exceed the demand at the current scale. I saw one guy that could supply an entire playerbase with top-tier equipment, and it's only ONE person. Even if the price bubble will emerge at some point, it won't last for long.
---
I saw people giving away lots of top-tier gear pieces absolutely for free and after that it's gonna be borderline insane to believe it should ever cost more. The more people know this (and we have communities like this one to spread this info), the more would ever spend much resources on the duped goods.
---
I got lots of good equipment this way from these people. And yes, I still like to play this game every once in a while. (there's exploration, coop fooling around and such) And yes, I couldn't care less for people saying it's cheating or some sort o bullshit like this. Everyone plays their game the way they like best. I don't really support duping because it ruins the game economy, yada-yada... but I don't mind if someone gifts me good things or sells what I need for a price I find reasonable. I'm happy with the deal, they're happy, what else would I want from the game? -)) 
---
I have the nuka paint already but would give you 2.5k for the other 2 common plans. Not looking for mods.
---
Power fist is unarmed... not 1H

or you just use Perk Loadout Manager ([https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)) and you save up to 8 perk sets?
---
PS4 
---
I have an issue with fast traveling with power armor I get some what near my target destination but everything is black but I can still the power armor UI and weather like rain but I can move and everything but I can‚Äôt see anything 
---
Maybe in single players, MMOs are played mostly by competitive min-maxers who LOVE to optimise their setup in favour of performance over immersion and such. I'm totally in love with my perks load out mod, switching on the fly for better rewards is satisfying AF, since I've spent a good hour creating 5 different layouts suiting my needs.
---
Class Freak iirc. In the luck column. 
---
So your opinion is your own. No need to tell me to get over myself.
---
I'll need pics or video evidence to believe this. At most it was a bug, no pun intended, unless you prove otherwise.
---
Glad I could help. Happy hunting!
---
I am level 112 and today I saw the plans for the lever action rifle on the vendor at Grafton station. I hadn't seen them since I was farming for it (successfully) at lower level. Maybe they removed the level restriction with the patch.
---
I thought of this as well. Would make the play through a little smoother.
---
or if you want the TSE Lever or Dragon because those are the only from my list I saw pretty often
---
Thanks for the replies all. It's disappointing but understandable, and far from a game breaker.
---
Thank you! And after rereading it says that sentinel is a prefix. But it can be a prefix and a minor modifier correct? So it would work with other prefixes?
---
Do a category "unexpected shit" and put everything in that category.
---
And if you go into photomode to take pictures with the Wise Mothman, it seems like he sticks around for quite some time until you are done.
---

You literally called me a "sympathizers or duper‚Äôs themselves" because I have a different opinion to you. This is the exact Witch hunting many people are getting sick of.
---
Hey hey hey, I love my hobo shack.
---
It's so homely. And hoboey.
---
Good question but you don't need all locations, you only need 5, do the other ones.
---
Jingle, Jangle, Jingle!
---
I actually haven't had a blue screen or disconnect since the patch, but I have had some new weird bug where I can't move.
---
Does chameleon and the cloaked legendary effect make you invisible on the map?
---
Hey look at that, an idea to extend off of instead of insult me or the post. sounds smart though, someone should definitely try to get that across... though it might be kinda hard, I‚Äôm sure.
---
Always try, never have more than myself :'( 
---
not for me.
---
2nd or 3rd login, spawn at white spring.. stealth.. wonder why i'm taking damage.. wait...
---
ghouls expected but the scorchbeast landing next to me was a suprise.. somehow didn't die.. must be scorchbeast health reduction?
---
fun times in the wasteland
---
just gonna comment so you can find someone to help.  
---
I don't own this game at all.  
---
Good luck finding it.
---
I got my first explosive shotgun somewhere around level 250ish. Im currently 365 and got a second one a couple days ago. Shits rare.
---
From level 100-250ish i mostly used a furious, faster fire rate +1 agi pipe rifle and unarmed weapons. 
---
Have to admit, I‚Äôve been through Flatwoods countless times and never heard of it before FO76. Same for the Grafton Monster.
---
Mothman is well known though. Think there was even a movie about it. 
---
They already announced update with new content so... No.
---
The in-world "dirty" version is absolutely still available in-world. I saw it at the Pumpkin House and the Whitesprings vendor today.
---
Your first lever action is so cool...
---
I did some testing and i think ONLY the explosive bobbleheads stack, i tried small guns but that didn't work. It could be that you have to take them in rapid succession, which i didn't do though.
---
And btw. i'm such a noob, i though all different bobbleheads could be active at the same time which is not the case, so i wasted quite a few of them.
---
Or perma ban the whole account that has any character more than 5 of the exact same TSE.   Chances of getting just a single 1 is very very rare.  Chances of getting the exact same TSE twice?  Even rarer.  Chances of getting 5 of the exact same ultra-rare TSE?  Non-existent.
---
Now if they desire to keep trying exploits, at least they have to buy another account.
---
Oof, low karma too, rag?
---
I can't be the only one who notices your bad attitude either.
---
I am so sorry for your loss.
---
Dunno why you're being downvoted. The game is nice but it's technically a shame 
---
if that being in my post offends you in some way to take it to heart, then it‚Äôs really your problem, not mine. I‚Äôm pretty sure I did not personally brad you specifically, or anyone specifically, because everyone can easily say ‚Äúhey, that‚Äôs not me‚Äù and move past it.
---
I hope you don't have [this bug](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afhx6t/i_have_no_pipboy_or_inventory_im_naked_and_i).      
---
Could you use pipboy on relog?
---
I've had it since before the reload fix. Gonna carry this baby forever.
---
I did not know this was a thing! Thank you for clarifying 
---
Bro it comes down to how you play. You sound like skipping them is starting to bother you so maybe you should give up some perks to hold lock pick all day. I personally skip all locks. Not my style to pilfer every corner of every room. I know what I‚Äôm lookin for and what I want isn‚Äôt in that safe or behind that door.  
---
Sentinel is a minor, and can occur in combination with main prefixes. Assassin's + +1 Endurance + Sentinel is the meta in PvP right now.
---
ya there's no raisin to pvp once your high level unless you want to be dirt poor
---
i thought if you killed a wanted person you get the bounty of caps they have accrued PLUS an amount equal to their level....yet ive only ever got 5-10 caps from lvl 100+ people so are they just dirt poor? if so then why even bother going after a 10 cap bounty(aside from the challenge for atoms)
---
I love those things. Toss a cryo out then the orbital. 
---
Once, in Morgantown a player tagged someone on my team. Accidentally caught him in the blast when it dropped, along with multiple ghouls. I was reveling in the massive 4k XP when I noticed I‚Äôd also killed a lvl 127 player. 
---
Yeah, everything was fine on relog. On first log the only button that had any response was Options. The world map, social menu, etc was fine.
---
I've never had this happen before and don't recall anyone complaining about it in the sub. I don't know if it's new, but it's new to me.
---
Same 
---
Yes thought the same sine the beginning. They should be passive skills. Maybe they could even bind them to quests you need to complete. Why have we no rewards for events and cool quests like passive perks to learn or something else. Maybe with the next big content updates ;)
---
Granted. But I don‚Äôt know about buying another account, lol.
---
&gt;hurpity derpity I'm so infallible and my opinion is so amazing that anyone who disagrees with me is a cheater!
---
Since you seem to care about your fake internet points, your edit will make people downvote it more.
---
&gt;I am not that high level, only 125 but I have definitely noticed lower levels being hesitant around me.
---
Remember a week or so ago, there was that weekly challenge to take photos near to each of three different survey markers? I was at one of them near to the Top of the World. I'm about level 150. I saw this level 9 guy nearby and kept trying to indicate to him that the marker was like ten meters away, in the hopes of helping him along with his weekly challenge. He SPRINTED away from me, and as I followed after him, shouting that I wanted to help him, he booked it out of there. I couldn't help but feel like he had the impression I was trying to bully or exploit him just based upon the difference in our levels. 
---
Hehe. I did this in Watoga when I found a legendary bot. I used my tesla rifle on it and did the come over here emote. I recently turned area chat on (my mic isn't currently plugged in) but I heard the guy say something about me calling him over. Shortly thereafter. He comes over and finishes the legendary off. I quickly pick up the legendary loot but become overencumbered doing so. Knowing that the legendary bot is about to explode I walk away to a safe distance and then hear the explosion. The dude didn't get away and got caught in the explosion and had a laugh about forgetting to run away. Good times.
---
Point being, I now use the come here emote all the time if K know someone is nearby so that we can share in the RNG bounty.
---
Provide your account details so i can report your duping activities. 
---
 I am on the phone with a buddy of mine who works in the cheaters department, Bethesda will be banging you soon.
---
PS4 Pro, Me: Drkhrse62
---
Immediately after Jan 15 patch:
---
1st log in, trouble getting into game. Crashed after 5 mins. 2 hours of good play after re-load (logged of after that).
---
2nd log in, reverted back to ID card screen 3 times. Took a couple minutes to load. Game immediately froze after entering world (Whitesprings). There appeared to be a blast zone nearby.  Had to shut down to get out of freeze.
---
I think my fusion core was draining more quickly than normal after that.  
---
Why would the gamer be interested in the cause of the problems?
---
No matter if theres 20 reasons why it doesnt work. Bethesda is not the only one who has to manage this kinda stuff
---
Remove the roof tile above it so it snaps the the angled wall piece. Then replace the higher roof and it should snap to the taller wall again. Roofs snap better low to high. Camp building comes down to the order you do things usually. If it looks like it should fit together it probably will, you just need to find out what order Bethesda wants you to place things. 
---
there are a lot of strange bugs, at least you're safe ;) my main is corrupted for over a week now, patch didn't fix it :/
---
I'm proud of you, member.
---
MVP
---
I'm on ps4 and it takes my guy forever to load in and I try to use my pipboy it doesn't actually pop up but my movement gets locked as if I'm in my pipboy menu. Happened on both my characters.
---
I haven't even bothered getting perk cards for the last two levels I went up, I just can't face swapping them about.
---
Not everything. You forget the category, known at Bethesda "those goddamn sonsofbitches", which is things they knew about but hoped decency would prevent being exploited
---
I can understand the hesitation, a few events I've participated in accidentally whilst travelling  the map have on occasions been where high level players have tried to shoo me away.
---
I'm LVL 66, full power armour and this LVL 167 player was trying his hardest to hit me with a super sledge for no other reason than that I was in the event area.
---
No idea why he was being all douchy, don't we all get the same amount of rewards for doing It?
---
If your combat build doesn‚Äôt utilize all card slots, you‚Äôre not doing it right. There are far more useful combat perks compared to card slots.
---
PC here and yes, it is annoying.
---
Angry stupid little man took the bait.
---
&gt; Lock pick and hacker should absolutely be passive traits. Each acquired at level ups.
---
why tho? its not liek ive ever found better loot in a level 3 safe. jsut make it a difficulty range, like it is, 1 2 3 and anyone can open it if you can do it. fuck it, make them harder if they are actually going to put good loot in it. as it is, i dont hack or open locks unless i have to for a quest. its just more junk inside, free junk is everywhere. maybe there are legendary somewhere, ive never found any or anything good at all. its seems to be all random junk so people cant farm safes or locations.
---
Works the same way on PC.  Annoying when it happens and now have to spend twice the time seperating items because constantly stopping and starting to slow down the numbers so it does not go past 1.
---
Treasure maps?
---
I've never had anything more permanent or serious than the water purifier bug. I haven't even gotten stuck in power armor, believe it or not.
---
On PC I did, though. I also couldn't log in for a while after spamming just 8 treasure maps. :\
---
So if you're being kicked out of the server two times a play session, you know how long you need to keep your hopes up?
---
The more important question is, how do I convince my wife to let me build another games machine?
---
Only once during beta, only the last one new I was there is seems with how it only gives one target at a time. 
---
Confirmed. Jappens on player trades as well. Noticed it when transferring some stimpaks to my alt via mule
---
This has gotten me more times than I can stand. 
---
Bottom line:  don‚Äôt store mods in the stash and don‚Äôt bulk common materials like steel. 
---
I really like the single action. Hopefully some day I‚Äôll get a cool legendary one with furious or quad or something funny for farming but obviously not for doing sbq 
---
Is your camp just up the road from the random encounter spawn just downhill from Lucky Hole Mine?  If so, it might be me...
---
Re-crafting it is way too expensive for say.. legs? I think its something crazy like 45 springs.
---
&gt;Don't know what's worse ..... a middle aged man playing video games.
---
You know there are quite a few of us, right?
---
Country Roads in 76. Just seems to fit the game dead on
---
I wish people would gift my low level.
---
I came across one too. It was yummy.
---
I have encountered this only once several mole miners played the effect and then exploded 
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand what a shill is. I‚Äôm pretty sure an opinion (apparently an unliked opinion) on a subreddit about video games that talks about said video game and it‚Äôs community is pretty normal. Nobody bought me a sandwich to say this. Again, I‚Äôm just a guy with an opinion. I want to hear from the community here because I mainly read the posts here. The arrows up and down will identify if anyone agrees with me or not pretty firmly. 
---
Assistant TO the regional manager !
---
Only a few. In popularity it's (least) Battle That Never Was, Hunter/Hunted, and Monster Mash.
---
People still play Monster Mash and it's definitely worth running for the PVE XP alone. _You do drop your junk_ but most players don't pick it up.
---
You can definitely tell people are using Fireproof now because players in Excavator armor aren't dying in one shot anymore. ;)
---
It's not a legendary effect
---
extremely low - 24 players per server but probably 100k+ players. Of course there are regions, e.g. US &amp; EU servers but most likely every region has a couple thousands worlds online 
---
Each persons game is different, I would enjoy this feature and so would others. If you wouldn‚Äôt fair enough but no need to be a dick about it. If you don‚Äôt like these posts ignore them, Bethesda have just fixed like 120 bugs in the latest patch, is my post really impacting your game?
---
Had something like this happen to me today. I just put my mats into the stash and it worked.
---
&gt; They need to restrict the build area so no one can build on the grounds at all.
---
So you want Bethesda to [add arbitrary restrictions](https://i.imgur.com/E3UeuqQ.jpg) to the open-world gameplay based on how you want people to play the game?
---
Which was already being worked on before release. Dont be foolish. 
---
Well stashing the Technical Data does not work either.    I stashed 18 of the data prior to quest.  Finished the quest and went back and picked up 1 Data from stash.  No quest.   Repeat.  No quest.
---
So...  Later I found one in a toolbox.  Got quest.   Tried again with my stashed Data.  No quest.
---
I have been unable to get the quest to trigger when getting any technical data from my stash. So I just discarded the 18 stashed.
---
I can't forget what I didn't know in the first place.
---
Bans for using mods is fake news.
---
You cant build that close to other locations so yes, you internet troll.
---
Oh boy, you really got me. That edits been there since I had 0 votes in general, so good try.
---
Yeah, I think I did like 100+ maps :/ [Full story](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aechkm/i_permanently_corrupted_my_inventory_by_farming)
---
Plenty of it out there just look around
---
They could make it so scrapping decorative things could have a chance of giving you a plan to make a static placeable version of that item. Maybe it‚Äôd use just the item as the materials. 
---
Happened a couple of times that there wasn't enough damage to kill her, too many lowbies hanging around.
---
Since I saw a black paint for PA that were for sell for a few hours and for more than 1000 atoms, while me having only 200, yes, I start saving atom points in case something like that will happen again. The best PA paint, I'm just want to cry Beth why are you doing this
---
This is purely anecdotal, but a few days ago I was server hopping quite a bit trying to farm mutations and I defiantly ended up back in the same server (same enemies dead in the exact same places) on several occasions. So I don't know if servers are region specific or not but there couldn't have been that many unless I just got weirdly lucky (or if I'm mistaken about ending up in the same server but I don't think I am)  
---
I've done lots of exploring in whitesprings. The rooms are not loaded into the game yet, also the 4th floor seems to be eventually reachable, but the doors that open up to the 4th floor don't have options on them, what's funny is you can often see robots trying to climb up the blocked staircases, I imagine it will all be released soon. I've been into the presidential suite in the bunker and opened the safe in there too, nothing of interest though, but it cant be opened from traditional means. Dont want to give to many secrets away. I am just an unorthodox explorer. 
---
Just get the monorail to work
---
Yeah, it's annoying.. but I figured making a post wouldn't do anything. Alot of shit is bugged after that "patch". rip
---
Can I add you as a friend on both your gamertags? I need more awesome adult people in my Xbox life. This is such a beautiful idea. 
---
Seriously doubt it. You're arguably worse off than using a mouse and keyboard so it shouldn't be considered cheating.
---
Other locations such as...go on, list them. You might figure out the massive difference as you do.
---
I‚Äôm sure that works great on PC. No mods on console though. 
---
Look for a quad lever with +damage resistance while reloading. It would be a great roll.
---
No lag after joining server and no disconnects in 6 hours? 
---
Do not panic, but you just have very strong hallucination going on.
---
The perk system is halt thought out. sounds somewhat fun during the first 20 so first level, then by the time you start piling duplicate perks because of rng, a first level of frustration sets in.
---
Then by lv50-75 the tension between a "good enough" deck to avoid micromanaging and "combat efficient" deck to counter rising enemy sponginess adds another frustration layer.
---
Past level 100, the sheer amount of cards stops making any sense, the duplicates pile up, the BiS versus useless filler perks become obvious.
---
There are already a few threads proposing better mechanics and balance for perk cards so i'll stop here.
---
When I was a child, my mom had to beat some Metroid bosses for me because I couldn't. Fond memories.
---
I remember reading that. Sucks.
---
I was able to open the pip boy and mash tab and drop until I could eventually log in without crashing in a few seconds. It took _days_ of trying it on and off and that was only with 8...
---
... or maybe they fixed something behind the scenes and my thrashing around did nothing. No idea.
---
Good luck.
---
Yes, the OP was able to explain this in a few simple sentences where a Youtuber would  drag it out for 20 minutes just to get the next advertisement to show up in the video for extra cash.   Its rather silly, I have seen youtube videos that say "Here is location X", but the video is 38 minutes long.  Uh.. what?
---
So I close youtube and find a simple image of map online somewhere in 30 seconds.
---
Game is broken, and dumb. We know. We just can't stop playing cos it's Fallout, sort of. 
---
All your comments on all posts are negative and you never say anything good other than arguing with people. Everyone can see your post history. Put your base there, I'll level it, my team kills whoever shoots at me, simple. You dont like it? Crawl back under your bridge.
---
(Important opinion, priceless)
---
Right. I don‚Äôt support breaking the game in any way. Hell I don‚Äôt like console commands because I think it cheeses the games. Duping is dumb. 
---
What I love is the priceless culmination of a collective knowledge. My rifle build is glorious because I read so many peoples builds from their experiences and nukesdragons.  I would‚Äôve never launched a nuke without nukacrypt I‚Äôm sure. Lucky Hole mine never existed to me until I saw the posts here about getting more lead. My favorite posts today were sentry-bot radroach and mic not plugged in guy. Fucking lolscapades. I love that shit. 
---
All I‚Äôm saying is keep that shit up man. 
---
The more players fight her the more health and buffs she gets so if a lvl 1 joins in and shoots her once for a reward and then buggers off it causes her to grow stronger making it a lot more difficult for the 4-5 lvl 100+  who actually CAN kill her because she as an unbelievable amount of health, so it is only difficult if Timmy with the pipe pistol comes in and starts taking pot shots 
---
[Main cards for my build](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4AAAAEDgYBAQEEAgQNECJPAxMCGQNvBTkBjQEDswEDkwEC6wED3QEBNgJ5A80BAdsBA/ABA6kBAkEBAA==) Killing most things with 4\* machete, for bigger packs or big ass enemies i pull out TSE pump shotgun. With pistol build i would have more spare points. I could be my team hacker for example, but there is no reason to hack/picklock anything, as im too strong to take shortcuts or get addational trash loot. So i dont use picklock/hacking perks at all. I am just like ability to be different. I hate rpgs without roles like Tank/dps/healer, why would i want team with someone, if he had same role as me?
---
Thank you for the smile you created behind my screen!
---
Your story was as warm as the ground in Ash Heap.
---
As a dev (not game dev) I have that fucking list.
---
Go back to school
---
Think of fast travel as the bullet train/monorail, the cost in caps is the ticket price.
---
Cards should have tabs you can configure. A Damage Tab, Repair Tab, Healing Tab. Etc..
---
You configure these tabs and whatever "mode" you are in you can just click the tab and all the cards specific for that tab are activated. Saves time and head ache when you crafted all that ammo and didn't have the Super Duper and Ammosmith card activated. 
---
Mole rat in Ash near red rocket station and rail yard event does this sometimes
---
Man I have to repair my armor more than that with 0 pvp encounters because I fight a crap ton of scorchbeasts
---
&gt; They stopped caring 
---
They're fixing bugs. They care at least a little.
---
Great, cos I need a couple quality of life mods or I'm gonna scream
---
The scorch beasts spawn from places called fissure sites that are dotted around the map, they stop spawning scorched and scorchbeasts if you nuke the sites, there is one between whitesprings and Lewisburg so it must have come from there
---
How long did it take and what weapon did you use?
---
Sometimes world drops will be at odd or even higher levels. I had a level 45 ripper but scrapped it. I'm sure it was an event reward for BoS (Distant Thunder or Surface to Air, specifically, I think).
---
It's still a turkey carver posing as a Ripper. You're probably better off farming for one with a Furious prefix.
---
I didn't even take the cards on my latest alt. At level 44 now, got hacker through a pack, but that's it. I know none of the quests are blocked by a door or terminal greater than level 0. So suck it.
---
The safes aren't even that good anyway.
---
The emote idea is good, not sure why I didn't think of that.
---
His a guy next in line to be served. Listen to the announcements, while you are waiting for your turn that guy comes running in to attack you.
---
Ok cool i will but can you tell me where it is or nah. Regardless I'd rather discover it.
---
May the Interloper take you under his wing and grant you the warmth and knowledge he has provided to me, Wanderer. 
---
Yup. Had this issue as well on Xbox while trying to trade with another player
---
LOL.  I'm the Regional Manager now.
---
Huh, cool. Kind of spendy and overkill but effective nonetheless.
---
If you listen to the announcer when she asks for the role calls she says ‚ÄòJ47‚Äô which is the final number before yours, he is the boss at that location
---
Kind of a let down, the only cool piece is the nika quantum sign
---
Random Number Generator. Google would told you, if you asked.

---
just note if it's a trap or a defend workshop from scorchedbeast event is ignored the scorchedbeast will remain in the world and will path around their spawn 
---
I hate you so much right now. I've been doing nothing but Bog quests for a week or two now and can't get it.
---
What level are you? Did you already have the Prime receiver for it? Did you summon it with a ritual of some sort?
---
Where is this located?
---
Can confirm. I tried to gift some purified water to a new player yesterday and this happened.
---
I don't know how it scales but I usually do it with a group of 3-8 people depending on time of day. The usual 4 people in our group can easily 4 man it. One 2H melee, one heavy weapons (50 cal), and two snipers/rifle build. Me(HW) and the melee user decimate the queen on our own, while the riflemen pick up all the adds and shoot the queen when they can. If we get good staggers in, she is done in 3 minutes. I'd say the average SBQ is 5 minutes for us, just because sometimes she won't land as quickly as others. We *think* staggering her and damaging her in the air gets her down quicker. Our melee player hunts the pipboy games, so she sometimes has magazines that are super helpful, we all use the appropriate chems to max damage, and personally I buff up with as much food buffs as I can muster. Bobbleheads do occasionally come into play, those are the really quick kills.
---
Don't know, also like you searched for it. My guess it is Robco Industries at the other easy side of the bog.
---
I dont really like the idea of carrying around something i have to deploy if i have to go to the bathroom its way simpler to go sit on a roof because i have cloaking gear and marsupial
---
they produce more bugs than the fix, hence why the bug list has only gotten BIGGER since release :(
---
Have you tried turning it off and then on again?
---
He was just waiting his turn and you mowed him down. Poor fella just got a little excited about finally being called, did you really need to kill the guy?! Remember this next time you go to the DMV when your number is called.
---
i killed 2 3star glowing ghouls couple days ago back to back
---
neither of them even dropped a legendary item, i even stood near them for 2 full minutes incase game was having issues loading them in....nope just nothing
---
SO MAD!
---
This is funnier than you think. I work in IT üëçüèª
---
That's unfortunate man, this latest patch has been amazing for me and I'm on standard ps4
---
I am going to assume that he‚Äôs walking because he‚Äôs over encumbered, in which case, fast travel isn‚Äôt an option. 
---
I think it's not possible for now :/ I got like 1300 cranberry bog treasure maps donated to farm those to may get stacks to unload but I'm not sure if it will work, gonna try soon because I see no other solution as of now
---
Thru tho.
---
You in xbox? I'll bring you loot tomorrow. 
---
Just standing.
---
It's not all that rare. I usually get it with crappy rolls, like Hunter's Raider Left Arm with +1 INT... :\
---
Hey I'm curious, are you finding your play style to actually feel different with a new build?
---
The point of this comment (hit send early sorry) was that its likely most average players playing probably arent doing these things or are doing a smaller amount of these things. Choosing the correct perk cards make a world of difference as well, using the proper armor for your build. [I can't tell you how many times I've seen 1h weapons and the person is in power armor. Don't do that] using under armor, there is actually a lot available in the game to buff your character that a lot of players sleep on. 
---
i don't get it... i why would anyone need to spam bobbleheads? i have a lvl35 explosive shotgun i found ages ago, i am not even specced for it other than demo lvl5 and i one-shot everything in pvp
---
For that you would need 60 in charisma my dude. And you cant even have that.
---
I'll check better but I've been there so idk. But I guess thanks lol. 
---
Not correct. On existing legendaries if you added the receiver it added a star. This is why you sometimes see 4 star weapons for sale. OP try relogging qnd see if it corrects itself.
---
If only people didn't make so many idiotic comments to take issue with. Such as 'Hey Bethesda please remove PvP from your PvP game for me' or 'Hey Bethesda please add random rules to Fallout 76 based on how this subreddit has decided the game should be played'.
---
&gt;Put your base there, I'll level it, my team kills whoever shoots at me, simple.
---
Now now, careful there. Sounds an awful lot like griefing to me.
---
&gt;All your comments on all posts are negative and you never say anything good other than arguing with people. 
---
'Oh shit guys, I can't stick to the topic at hand, better check the other guys post history instead.'
---
yeah i had a post ranting about it then i realized its the clean variant and felt kind of stupid but $6 is still way to much
---
Each level of perk card requires 3. 3 charisma per chard √ó 10 cards = 30. Not 60
---
No, I am on Playstation..I do have an Xbox, but I don't have the game for it yet.
---
&gt; No idea why he was being all douchy, don't we all get the same amount of rewards for doing It?
---
Yes, if anything you would get more spawns too. Plus it's not like you're level 6, you do your share of damage. 
---
Well all your posts are shit so theres that. 
---
188, yes when i got it I had already unlocked all prime receivers for it and even used a ultra laser gat to kill the queen though im sure that's highly irrelevant, the ritual was the event haha. 
---
Honestly I wasn't even expecting it, the event was close to a place that I wanted to fast travel too and doing the event covered the cap travel cost. When I saw the rewards start being listed off I was like "oh great another ultracite laser plan" but then I saw the word gatling and was like "WHAT?!?!" I honestly didn't even know you could unlock the plan i was so surprised I thought it was some sort of error.
---
And may your neighborhood florish and thrive as mole miners in a tunnel :)
---
In your post apocalyptic fantasy you aren‚Äôt even the owner?
---
Every time I've done this event, which is a lot, other players have been very cool about the legendaries.  (on PC)  I've never had anyone blast a legendary without waiting for the others to get a shot in, even a lvl 200+ with an explosive double barrel shotgun.  He'd let us all get in a tick of damage and blast it to smithereens.
---
I have the same issue, double screen for the loading and when I spawn I have an invisibile torso and no camp for at least 5-10 sec.   
---
This problem pre and post patch and it's frustrating. Sometimes I can't see where my camp is and it spawns over me and I'm stuck in the middle of foundations  
---
Grind em up and snort them. Gets into your system faster.
---
It's not just the card swap, it's the minigame after. There's almost nothing that could possibly be in a safe to be worth that time. 
---
For the weekly challenge the General Atomics plant is any power plant I believe. At least It worked for me taking photo at Mohanga? power plant
---
Nope. I definitely ended on the same server once while hopping, unless several names I‚Äôd seen on the prior server followed me to the new one. 
---
Idk. The suggestion in the video may not be the best solution for sure, but I don't feel like needing to get certain armor or mutations should be a requirement just to safely afk for a minute. I think it would be nice to have a way for everyone to do it regardless of their build. But hey if it works for you run with it, but don't discredit the idea for others :/
---
But... that's not true at all.
---
thats 100% pure missingtexturite if you crush it into a fine powder and snort it you get sucked into a portal into the developer room
---
Yeah I get a longer load screen - a pain but yeah it beats me risk moving my character when the game is loading and then crashing
---
It might be possible you looted someone else's drop
---
Do you know what maintenance means ?
---
Sounds like you logged back in a dangerous zone, nuked or glowing infested. where were you ?
---
No. Its closer to Vault 96
---
It's a traditional title, the highest a Schrute can earn.  Regional Manager = King
---
Yes! Let us repair sections like workshops &amp; let us collect a fare if they use your ‚Äústation‚Äù. Would go great with vendor bots!
---
I get something weird on PC that's similar. After the first loading, I hear the sound you get when spawning then I see the map loading semi transparent and black textures before another short loading screen and them I spawn and I'm able to play.
---
Would actually be really nice if you could scroll past the top of a stack to go to 1, hope they expand on the bug and turn it into a feature,
---
You'll get a TSE way quicker by buying one off a trading forum. I would sell small stuff like junk and chems til you can afford one. They're a lot cheaper now since people duped them. 3k could get you one if you haggled around a bit, but I would come to the table with 10k if you want a better chance at getting whatever weapon you wish (not all are 10k or lower just most). I've played to level 201 with about 300ish hours of play and have had absolutely 0 TSE drops. I've had about 5 explosive weapons drop, and one mentionable super sledge drop. This was all post level 160, all more recently.
---
But as RNG works, you always have the possibility of having good luck. My friend has has 2 TSE gauss rifles drop on his account, one with +1 agility. He has also looted a tse 10mm pistol. I wouldn't risk those chances when you can put work in and earn it, and guarantee you get what you want.
---
Its because you didn't scrap the wires to your generators first, you may be SOL now, known annoying bug. Also remove wires first.
---
I somehow hate you even more now.
---
We're not far apart in levels and I've also used a Prime Ultracite Gatling to kill the queen. If any event pops in the 'bog I run it and even fast travel to Defiance consistently to pop LITS.
---
Various sources/wikis say _any_ event in the bog reward it and there is also a low chance from LR weapon events (like Penitentiary). The hand full of players I know that have it say they got it from Line in the Sand.
---
If you only knew how many times I've run Line in the Sand....... RIP me.
---
Much sarcasm on the hate remarks, of course. This stupid green pewpew is driving me mad and I really want to try it post-patch since they buffed charging caps.
---
Whiner. Get out.
---
Nope. Can't tame cats I'm 100% positive. You can tame specific animals and creatures. It has to be one that spawned during one of those random encounters. You may have seen one that wasn't red to someone, which just randomly happens sometimes. It doesn't mean it was their pet or anything. I wanted to believe too. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. On the other hand, with how often and easily other players kill your pets, it's probably for the best. 
---
Check your email 
---
Yes, someone already suggested me that, I'll try when I'll go back home. Thx
---
No offence but you have quite the vocabulary for a scorched.
---
Yeah, because you are the only one capable of a viable heavy weapons build. Take your gatekeeping bullshit elsewhere. I literally main heavy weapons, knowing they are garbage because I like the style and role. Your delusion is your problem. Heavy Weapons are and will be trash until they fix the durability and ammo crafting. 
---
what do you mean by "testing" ?
---
/s
---
Never trust the User.
---
That's rule 1 of development. (Or maybe it's like Rule 2 if you have rule 1 ["Never use regex to parse Html"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454) )
---
They don't. They're like PEZ dispensers where you tilt the head back and it ejects the pill. And in lore appropriate ultra-capitalist fashion each bobblehead only contains one pill.
---
rofl, look at this guy posting history, selling tons of TSE's 
---
Post is fake / The guy duped shitton of stuff and gave his girlfriend
---
Well first off, I never had lock pick any supply drop before. The first was my own supply drop. I guess it migh take of been cause I was the 1st one there to get the supply drop. Did they change it in the patch?
---
Go to the map, bring up the menu, it's called "challenges"
---
Yeh i had a mod that would only allow you to save by smoking a ciggie. Damn that was cool. Had the animation and all.
---
You either had to find packs of ciggies or craft them.
---
I love to sometimes pick up random guns off mobs and start using them. It's so boring just killing everything in one hit with melee or my bloodied explosive shotgun 
---
I did this event last night and had a similar experience. I say similar because the difference was the lvl 200+ player had at least a 2\* quad explosive dragon and kept making mincemeat of all the moles before I could get any hits in. I had to resort to camping at one spot to try and get them on spawn and still only got about 4-5 of them. Didn't even see the legendaries that spawn either. The player disappeared without even a wave as well, just logged straight out.
---
You can only fix what's 100% broken. 
---
I just spawned into a server, tried to open a door and DC'd.  
---
What?
---
no emails 
---
I was level 40ish when found my first Black powder Rifle.  Examing the damage, I was overjoyed.
---
Spot checking my ammo, I notice I have 6 shots.  Disappointing but good for testing, I excitedly aim at the Super Mutant down in the parking lot below...Fire, almost killed him in 1 shot.   Fantastic, then I begin reloading... and waiting... ow ow ow.  They are meleeing me.  Ow ow ow.   Still reloading the rifle.  Ow ow ow.  
---
Finally! BLAM!  The injured is dead.  Reloading, ow ow ow, still reloading, ow ow ow...  
---
Hmm Paper bag.
---
I used lockpick and hacker long enough to get their achievements, now I'll only use them if absolutely necessary. I've not had the need to craft and traveling costs aren't so great to compel me to use that perk either. I'm currently sitting on 12 level UPS just because I can't find anything that feels necessary. Well, that and I can't make up my mind on changing special points or drop current perks for others. Once I got the achievement for reaching level 100 the game has become meh which I trust hate as I've easily put 1000 hours into every Fallout since 3 and every Elder Scrolls since Morrowind.  
---
I would love to be able to add clutter but I feel like the servers would implode if the homes weren't instanced and it's kinda already bad enough, so I have resigned to making my FO4 homes my clutter zones
---
In my days Jet actually slowed down time.
---
I mean. I‚Äôve been punished for finding a bunch or guns in the same place. It was something like 5 pipe revolvers and 7 (I think) pipe rifles. And because I am a fairly high rank I thought nothing of it but when I scrapped them and logged off I tried to log back in and the same thing happened, long loading screens and errors. I think this means that either we have been punished or, it is just Bethesda being shit again lol
---
If you 'sneak' you disappear off the map, chameleon and cloak are not necessary to make you disappear. Since you have to be sneaking in order for chameleon to work anyway, for it, the answer is 'generally' yes.
---
For cloaking, I haven't tested to see if while you're invisible post cloak you can run and move at normal speeds while not crouched, and still remain invisible on the map, however, my instinct would be 'no' and even if you could remain invisible, cloaking only lasts 30 seconds, and requires you be hit, which likely means you've been detected, decreasing it's utility (Except MAYBE against scorchbeasts since they blindly fire in your general direction and land hits even when they can't technically see you). 
---
I play on Xbox. I used to play Skyrim on PC but never fully got into modding. 
---
Lead any nearby hostiles to them. Mobs aren't limited to slap damage.
---
Xbox here so feel your pain
---
Yeah op but it‚Äôs a choice. You can either keep them in for convenience or take the hit and lose out in other perk cards
---
but it is though? are you high?
---
i sure do. and this game is a prime example of that 
---
Most high levels are either really curtious and helpful to low levels or really big assholes, my main character is a lvl 172 max melee/heavy weapons build but lately I've spent quite a bit of time leveling my second character lvl 45 max agility stealth melee/pistols and honestly it's amazing how differently people treat you based on your lvl
---
It's been fixed. They also fixed Starched Genes - you can drink serums while you have it equipped now.
---
There‚Äôs that inclusive and supporting community I‚Äôve come to love over the past couple of months
---
damn have u figured out a way around it? and how is this even remotely fair if it is a punishment 
---
I run around with a tse 10mm, it takes a couple shots to kill enemies. Fun times. 
---
yes, not sure if intentionally or not, but the supply drop is now personal not instanced for everyone. So if someone picklocks you supply drop, then he becomes wanted and if he steals your drop, then you won't have anything in it.
---
You‚Äôve summed up my experiences :D
---
But when I pop that last cheevo - I‚Äôm putting it down
---
If you're disconnected and didn't get a warning like "Server will shut down in X minutes" - that's a server crash.
---
Since the update on PS4, I have been completely unable to login. It goes through the first screen with the backdrops and tips and such, but then goes to a black screen with a vault tech logo in the bottom right that typically pulses, but instead is frozen and it will not load any further. Attempted 7x in a row, complete with system restarts. My friend in the same room is logged in just fine.
---
*Also, please fix the camps. I'd give specifics but I'm sure others already have, and I'm typing on a phone and my thumb would cramp before I finished. (And I'm a gamer so just think about that.)
---
I kill people with bounties of 5 caps.
---
The support in this case should be the adjoining roof, it looks like there‚Äôs a sloped roof immediately adjacent to where they intend to put this new roof extension. Currently the engine won‚Äôt let them use the adjacent roof as a valid support because the new roof extension would be on the exterior of the home, or so the engine thinks at least, that‚Äôs how it decides whether a new roof section has valid placement, but the kicker is that the engine only looks to see if the roof has at least one supporting piece when you go to remove the extra supports, so in that case the supporting piece would be an immediately adjacent, i.e. touching, roof section to the left or right.
---
Hope this makes sense, it‚Äôs a lot easier to demonstrate in-game.
---
Every single time. 
---
r/iamverybadass 
---
&gt;They need to improve the quality of loot in the rest of the game so we don't feel compelled to live in the golf club. Maybe start with having legendary mobs actually drop legendaries most of the time equal to their stars (or at all).
---
In FO4 I loved collect robot-models and put some food in eat-o-tronic and I miss this feature.   
---
The problem is other players could steal/bring these things from your camp.   
---
And I spend 40 caps to do it.
---
Damn If I know this I wont just punch his corpse for 5 min
---
Nice dude I just met a random that had his camp SUPER close to my base. Some level 17 guy and I invited him to team then built him a fusion generator, concrete extractor, nice bed with pillows, sexy red couch without blanket, and many more things. Also dropped a few stims and various other chems as well as some wood for his house. It feels good to help people in this game. Not much else to do when you hit 100+ IMO. 
---
Karma, karma never changes.
---
And I swear sometimes there is no explosion. 
---
Oh, you better believe thats a paddlin‚Äô
---
Aaaarggh! Got me a pirate hat
---
Not sure why this got so heavily downvoted for any reason
---
Thanks for the info, I know now to avoid supply drops unless it is mine.
---
Wait... So does that mean it is affected by commando instead of rifleman? 
---
Was this on PC?
---
this is my problem as well
---
If only a Bethesda release only had 12 known issues. 
---
I got that today twice aswell, trying to get into enclave bunker. Nothing but fast travel worked
---
same
---
I'm 75-80 and every time I do this event, if I'm alone with a legendary, I use the "follow me" emote to warn other players. Almost every player who enter this event are here for the legendaries, I find it impolite to kill them alone.
---
Wait who is Wallace? 
---
Problem is Legendary items make combat roles superfluous.  With any decent Two Shot or TSE guns and the right Legendary Armor or PA setup you can facetank practically anything in the game and provide good sustained DPS.  Toss in 3 extra points in Charisma to share or have relevant team perks as your only specialization and everyone is a Tanky DPS Healer.  Only outlier seems to be Melee (which just ends up being a CQC High Burst damage Tank Healer) or Glass Cannon High Burst Damage Sniper builds. 
---
RNG stands for Random Number Generator. Pretty much if something is RNG based its random on, if, when, and sometimes how you will get it
---
Use the missile launcher they provide to skeet shoot.
---
check your pm
---
Totally. But maybe it's the way I overall play them. I also slightly roleplay them.
---
I'm at my third character.
---
**First** 
---
* Level 76 shotgun/sniper/explosive build.
---
* I don't fear much, anything melee receives a shell in the knees and just accept their fate to my shotgun in their face. Distance get sniped.
---
* I rarely use V.A.T.S.
---
* My C.A.M.P. is advanced, with a huge farm and water. In the middle of the map for travel purposes.
---
* I sometimes use PA (excavator)
---
**Second**
---
* Level 50ish no PA melee tank savage
---
* No food (cannibal level 3). I kill things then eat them (if available)
---
* No water (lead belly, I just drink from puddles)
---
* 15 Strength with no food, no water and only one weapon means I can just hoard junk.
---
* No V.A.T.S.
---
* Small camp with a small farm going on. Nothing fancy nor advanced. In the middle of the map.
---
**Third**
---
* Level 44 Pistol V.A.T.S. / Crit Sneak build with a side of automatic rifles
---
* Initially wanted to do a raider run, but just like in Dragon Age or Mass Effect, I can't get myself to be mean...
---
* I feel like John Wick. One bullet in the torso, one in the head. Pew pew.
---
* In V.A.T.S. All the time
---
* Very mobile camp with lots of water purifiers in a remote place. Moved willingly a few times already. In a remote area.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agixv2/ps4_watoga_weird_for_me_today_locks_and_reset_bots/
---
Same. I just stand very still for about a minute on login. Then I can run around.
---
I want to know the secrets too!
---
You can't board the bullet train with all those pieces of junk.
---
Why do you even PVP in this game?
---
You can check if your mic is sending something to the game by going into third person view. You'll see a tiny sound icon. 
---
Yeah I had two all day so far
---
Today's Wednesday and Saturday's pretty soon, so IK don't think you're gonna get their answer. Try on Monday.
---
First time I can play for more then 3 hours without any game crashes or disconnects. Before the patch the game crashes every 30 min 
---
A feature to set cards as a "class" or pre set to switch back and forth. 
---
I just found the perfect spot!
---
Out in the Mire, north of Valley Galleria, to the left of the Ramshackled Bunker if you're facing it. There's a place were you can rock club up the cliff face. If you place your camp just right, you can make use of the water at the bottom of the cliff while placing your home right on the cliff side. 
---
There are a number of small-to-medium sized ledges where a house could easily go.
---
Theres a PC mod for that.
---
Just doing my part!
---
It‚Äôs like there is 2 loading screens, but the second is invisible. 
---
Like the other poster said, just be a little patient and wait an extra minute. 
---
Wow! That's the main menu mutation, that's super rare. Lucky
---
It's the Matrix and you're like Neo bending spoons :)
---
nice that was a good run :) +karma
---
The thought has crossed my mind. What if all those bullets i left on the floor of vendors have been used to kill my brothers and sisters...
---
I‚Äôm well aware of that. When you try to join into a server that‚Äôs crashed, you get a notification saying your teammate‚Äôs world doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, or something of similar wording. It doesn‚Äôt say the server crashed. It uses a euphemism instead. 
---
Walk the cliff tops behind the Palace of the Winding Path, there is a beautiful spot by a pond up there. It's out of the way and remote.
---

---
So 10 baseballs are the best option as they dont autoscrap at benches then? 
---
Once you get some good legendaries you don't really need the dmg perks except for when you want to fight the queen. And when you're farming exp you just need enough dmg to oneshot lvl 68 super mutants and scorched and with stuff like instigating that is pretty easy.
---
Have you attempted to store the foundation piece and then scraping the staircase?  Something similar happened to me with walls.
---
Omg... thank you soooo much mate! I searched google, fo forums, reddit and even watched about 10 vids on youtube to dp with whitesprings. Not one i could see explained it like you have. Everyone just mentioned it is under a gazebo. I was looking for a canvas type setup, not a stone pergola type thing. I actually looked in there twice, but mainly was drawn to the drain grate thing with the fence on the centre.
---
Again, thanks pal! 
---
You should post the discord info again. I had to dig through your post to find it lol.
---
Sounds odd but I'll give it a try if I ever somehow end up in one of these things again, lol. Never thought it would happen once let alone twice!
---
Frankly if they don't have the caps to cover it, they should go into the negative and be literally unable to harm other players until they get into the positive again. Stops these people that just go around leveling camps and have no caps.
---
I was not exactly killed in one shot, the player was using a melee weapon but they managed to kill me in 4 hits, how?
---
I got one for ya. Yesterday I noticed some dead bots against a railing to the bog. I check one out and loot it for an eye popping 72 fusion cells then it explodes and kills me a couple seconds after looting. Not 10 min later after retrieving my dropped loot I'm still in Watoga and I see two protectrons walking around. One walks into a wall another into the robot spawner simultaneously and both fall over dead in that exact same moment. Maybe someone shot them dead? No one on the map in town besides me. I go to loot one and 52 fusion cell score from one. Before I can think about the coincidence, BOOM! Dead. 
---
One is a fluke. Two a strange occurrence but still probably a coincidence. If it happens again just like that I'm putting on some pw, approaching, looting and immediately running...then reporting the new glitch to Bethesda. 
---
Because "you never see a server". :)
---
And here I am building death traps at my base... 
---
I even it out by giving stuff to lowbies
---
People keep saying this over and over.   But not a single person has posted the exact set up to achieve this effect.  They all basically just say something close to what you said.  Why not just include a link to it?
---
I believe the raider chestplate is like that 
---
I am intrigued? What happened?
---
High damage weapon, can pick away from quicker and do larger slaps. Whenever someone dies, they drop a few caps .. bad game design, hopefully will be corrected in the future.
---
I gotta know, do you all put "I love this game but..." in these posts to protect yourself from the inevitable downvotes? Or what is it?
---
That's the same one haha
---
I had the same idea a while ago:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2p6f8/certain_perks_should_not_have_to_be_equipped_in/
---
However, I'm using the Perk Loadout Switcher from the Nexus which makes stuff so much easier.
---
I thought the title was trolling until I actually read the rest of the post. Yikes.
---
So i played with my friends after the update today and it was fine, maybe a little laggy at worst. i help my buddy make his base and while looking at the things that spawn around his base like tents and foot lockers etc. i find a bunch of XO-1 armor. i am very surprised but happy. what an awesome find. my friend tells me about there being drops from bethesda sorta like an easter egg or ive heard about higher levels putting things in overseers cache to help out other coming along. I dont know , but im not questioning it so i share with my friends giving some the armor or whatever they wanted. shortly after these 6 guys come out of nowhere very quietly and weird. they initiate combat and i dont really do pvp so i log out. they proceed to destroy my friends base but dont chase anyone or ‚Äúgrief‚Äù. i let my friends find a new server and rejoin. we play for a few and i decide to get off. i got to log in later to help a friend under attack and im met with long loading screens that all lead to on of multiple error codes. also when i google these codes nothing comes up. seriously one brough me to a bunch of train history.  why is my game all kf the sudden not working?
---
But you have good in your heart.
---
Happens very often on console as well. I just don't go after wanted players anymore.
---
I've had a few nasty bugs since the update (ps4). The Monorail Elevator's elevator is busted. Attempting to go up a level initiates a loading screen for a few seconds the screen changes to another loading screen, and I get spat back out at the base of the elevator. 
---
Really annoying, because this is one of the best concrete spots in the game. 
---
Same here, sow it only on raider chest. As deep pocket give you usual 10, I always assumed that as a bug.
---
Or he is dying in the nuke zone alot?
---
Yep. I‚Äôm not even a very high level (just hit lvl 50) and I don‚Äôt wear PA but low levels run away from me too. A lvl 16 tagged along with me during Uranium Fever so I watched his back. Afterward, we both went to the train station and I tried to give him a bunch of extra plans I had. I jumped and shot at the bag, eventually shot the ground near him. He looked at me from afar for a minute, then *bolted*. Like, dude if I was gonna kill you I would‚Äôve helped the mole miners do it earlier. üôÑ
---
Be very careful when pressing the R key to access containers, ect, as it's the same button to drop items and such.
---
https://youtu.be/6n3pFFPSlW4 my response
---
On PS4 Pro also. I had 3 blue screens today, and 2 lock up freezes. This has BY FAR been the most stable day for me playing this game since it released. In fact, I had a long play session today (pretty much since the servers came back up) and I didn't experience a single problem till later on in the evening. Normally I'd be getting a blue screen every other time I go into my inventory/talk to a vendor/trade with someone, etc. 
---
Nope still get hourly blue screens on normal PS4
---
Don‚Äôt see why that would be the case. There‚Äôs plenty of spots to respawn near the zones in both areas.
---
I was much better off before the patch. I had 7 bluescreen crashes in less than two hours.  Took a break and logged back into a server with a queen fight and immediately bluescreened, but was unable to get back into a world after that.
---
Oh son of a mirelurk! Just woke up without my well-rest, my bad.
---
Unless a friendly, overweight melee lvl 100 gave a newbie shells.  Like me yesterday.  1500 isn't much, dupers have 1000000.
---
All g Im in my sentinel gear. Mind you with bobblehead glitching it doesnt do shite. :(
---
This happen to me today , I was robbed and my camp destroyed , literally took my whole nuke site loot :/
---
This wasn't intended to be a recruitment post. I mentioned at the end to pm if interested. Wasn't sure on recruitment posts on this reddit.
---
I believe you have to learn the plan to craft the prime receiver for said gun, and that will in turn unlock the crafting for the ammo. 
---
Same on xbox
---
Having to switch them in and out when you need crafting/skills vs fighting...yeah that's pretty dumb.
---
They need to make it so you can save perk loadouts for various situations. Like give us the option to save up to 5 different loadouts. Then I could do all my crafting perks in one, my power armor build in one, my shotgun build in another, my rifle/sniper in one and whatever in the last one.
---
Yes there's a mod out for it but after rumors that Bethesda was banning people for mod use...I'm not risking using mods.
---
Well I'm glad that after all these weeks it just works.
---
90% of my deaths are due to "well fed" and END food buffs expiring... thus leading to a HP loss.. thus making my low HP nerd rage build fall over and die.    
---
    
---
Annoyed and confused the fuck out of me for ages until I worked out what was going on. Now I avoid END food and never eat to more than 50% of the satiation bar.
---
I love that pistol! It's fun for an off weapon for sure.
---
Don't see why this is a problem? It makes you strategize a bit than rushing blindly. Crouch, teleport, use stealth boy, scout area, make a plan, see is it doable by you alone? Isn't that much better than alternative?
---
I guess it depends where in whitesprings you need to get too during a nuke event and the closest port in spot at that time. It can be a hassle to get to the clubhouse from most teleport points....but that's provided he is even talking about the nuke event in the first place.
---
Any idea where I'd be able to get it from? Or what about converting it to regular .50?
---
There is no General Atomics Plant in Appalachia. Are you sure about the wording?

It‚Äôs so difficult without a mic isn‚Äôt it. I have one but I don‚Äôt really like using it and I‚Äôm not always in a position to use it at home 
---
The lookout tower to the West is the most convenient way to get to the clubhouse. I have yet to see it fall inside he zone. Barring that, Blackwater mine to the east if the train station was hit. 
---
I totally agree it is worse.
---
post it to their twitter and if nothing happens threaten to make a big deal of it
---
This is literally the moment my heart sank a little when I realized you can't drop items; bears.
---
&gt; I am european
---
Or be swappable only once a day.
---
(Which would be a big nerf as opposed to all the buff suggestions, but it would be another way to solve the problem and it might end up being tactically interesting.)
---
You can add "VATS hits on players don't charge the Critical meter" to the list of VATS issues. I have to charge my Critical meter on mobs because it refuses to when hitting players.  
---
Thank you for your work!
---
What's that wastelander, you wish to lock pick this level 2 loock. It's ok, just spend 30 seconds faffing around, unequipping your master rifleman, giving you 20% less damage.... all while being slapped by a level 62 charred ghoul.
---
Man, it is such an inconvenience. It does need changing, in any way. 
---
Ah my bad. I thought it was. I will withdraw my invite request on the discord then. Sorry about the confusion.
---
Wouldn't that only make it worse? Making it even more of a hassle to switch cards, when the problem from the beginning is that it is an annoyance to need to switch cards? Why make it even more annoying then? 
---
No, making things like lockpicking and hacking passive seems like a much more reasonable solution to me. Now that we have these cards and the game is made as it is. 
---
When you run a bp rifle you need to run a bp pistol. Shoot the rifle, switch to the pistol to finish the target off then reload. If you have the sneak card leveled up you can fire even a bp rifle without them discovering you if you‚Äôre a good distance away. 
---
They're really deep in past the mirelark kungs
---
Bethesda's MMO is celebrating its first lustrum this year.
---
Previously it would always reload 5 bullets no matter how many you fired. Which would take longer than it should if you for example were reloading just one bullet.
---
They have also sped up the reload in general on this rifle as well.
---
I just miss the stocks. They should add marcy long as the only npc in the game, just so we can put her in those. Yes, i know... like 100 years previous to fo4 whatever...
---
Have you ever played an item grinder before? The gameplay needs to be compelling, not the loot drops.
---
Another person posted this earlier with literally the worst grammatical errors I have ever seen. Thanks for reposting this with legible spelling.
---
Pretty sure they will add it later, because otherwise it would be called Tuba plan, not Wind instrumentS.
---
I see that now. Are those all lvl 50 like the one i encountered?  It also hardly took any damage with my shitty guns. 
---
I just don't build any turrets/defenses and very rarely get attacked.
---
I usually just start shooting. Sometimes they‚Äôll get nervous and I‚Äôll snag it when they check lol. I only do this if they‚Äôre taking forever obviously. 
---
Thx for sharing. 
---
From my experience they're not always there - I've visited that cave, went to the bottom and found only Mirelurk Kings, no Wendigo
---
So, if you do understand what maintenance means, and you do know they are planning to ADD things NOT YET in the game, where were you confused ?
---
Even if those things were already working on before release, finishing them and adding them means there's not only "maintenance" being done.
---
If you were being caricatural, it's unnecessary and not constructive.
---
I have n idea why Bethesda hant had that option from day one.  Especially with all the DC. Painful.
---
Maybe it's just me, but I've been disconnected from the server more frequently since the last patch. 
---
They won't decline because of the implication 
---
I think I'd prefer the possibility of turret malfunctioning in the future using bullets :)
---
Not hidden - in plain view right on the road. I think PS4 players' behaviour is more toxic than on PC.
---
How does something like this even get screwed up? Like what could they possibly have changed that led to the quantity scroller moving past 0 but not the other way? So weird. Annoying as hell.
---
You don't have to do it again, why would you? you don't use the ones you have.
---
It's funny because other than the odd shortcut, or hacking terminals to make launching nukes a lot easier, there's not really much reward to using either lockpicking or hacking. I mean the level 3 door at Harpers Ferry you can literally just walk to the right and there's a big opening, what's the point?!
---
Maybe if hacking level 3 safes had actual caps in for your troubles instead of average armour and tonnes of worthless pre war money it'd be worth the effort.
---
i think the full set still gives the bonus but if you log in while wearing the armor it glitches out and gives double the bonus and once you exit the armor it goes back to the normal 100 bonus. at least that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs worked for me so far
---
No more bathtub filled with Nuka-cola quantum. (Well this never really worked anyway since they fell right through the tub as if it was just a hologram)
---
True. Plain and simple.
---
I was talking about more the one-shot mechanic so there is actual PVP. PVP is fine... when it actually happens. The one-shot kill is pretty below average, like your comment.
---
Because they didn‚Äôt test trades apparently
---
Currently I'm blue screening about every 5 minutes. If the option of a refund was available I'd take it right now as it's a complete utter fucking shambles of a game!!
---
Some great info you've posted, thanks very much
---
Interesting. I wonder who it was worded then. like I said in the post I didn't notice anything in the past few days under "pause". Though I do find it a little funny because I am usually pretty terrible with grammar, spelling, or just typing... and I'm an American with English as my only known language.
---
I would be satisfied with just a perk card load out favoriting system, where I can set a perk loadout and switch it rather quickly. Not instantaneous, but bringing up the pipboy and selecting perk group 1 or 2, etc... I'd even be happy with only being able to store 2, one for combat, one for crafting/lockpicking/other tasking.
---
I launch nukes on griefing bounty hunter camps ps4 friend me plz... lots of xp building a new camp every day you log in.  Love bounty hunters,  I'm badazz I'm level 90 and collect bounties off of level 15s I'm super tough.
---
Sorry for your loss mate. It is a hard thing to deal with, losing a parent. I myself have delt with my dad's passing a year and half ago. It is good what comes from video games as a whole. They are good with keeping our minds occupied, whilst dealing with grief. Chin up fellow vault dweller.
---
Not sure on those sort of details about converting etc but as for finding plans just farm vendors and pray to rngesus you get it
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to figure it out either

I only object to people that I have not attacked being able to PVP me.

I lost a power armor set I found because it crashed as I was trying to enter it, and was despawned on every server I tried to hop to
---
Yes it does ive put th same mod on my tse shotgun n it has 3 stars now it works on everything ive put that mod on
---
Same problem here. Put that receiver on my 3* 10mm but nothing happen. I'm not even sure if it deals 50% more dmg to Scorched. 
---
‚ÄúDC‚Äôd‚Äù?
---
What spot is that?
---
Still an issue 1/16/19
---
Lmao that moment when TSE is so strong players have to nerf themselves to have fun. 
---
too bad I like my tse
---
So untill then it will just have to sit in my stash. Thanks.
---
And accidentally one-shoting really crap on the loot.
---
How do you clear a cache on PS4? 
---
i would assume that it changes the projectile to a hitscan explosion, based on how energy weapons' (or at least the flamer, cryolator, and tesla) energy visuals are gone (except for on impact) when they have the explosive modifier
---
Loading screen isn't my problem. I've also waited 15 minutes still not being able to do anything
---
Posting a wanted ad here is your best bet. Otherwise farm the queen and hope she drops that plan. 
---
I had a prime two shot explosive 50 cal myself. Couldn‚Äôt find anyone who could mod it back to having a non-prime receiver. I eventually just left it in the ice box at whitesprings. 
---
clearly you have no idea wtf you are talking about. god i hate mindless fanboyism. 
---
I was disappointed when I learned I can't stack chems. My Raider  character keeps 2 points in Endurance for Chem Resistant, mostly for RP reasons. I ditched the longer duration perks, they're useless.
---
So basically I was trying to drop my super sledge cos it weighs a bit. But I accidentally dropped my two shot hardened handmade. Normally this would be easy to pick up. But I had two griefers(people that just follow you around and hit you) so I was trying to pick up what was in the bag but it wouldn't load.  I couldn't wait any longer since I had used all my stimpacks from those two hitting me.  Eventually they got bored of me and went to their base which was near where they griefed me. I waited a bit longer but the bag wasn't loading. I figured that I didn't drop the handmade since it was still in my inventory. So I went to their base just to say hello.(Don't know why I did that) but they locked me in the base using their workshop thingo( they made it so there were no more doors. So I just disconnected from the server. When I came back I looked in my inventory and the handmade rifle was gone. Even though in the last server it said that I had it. So I tried to add everyone as a friend who was in that server to join their server and get back the rifle which was in a dropped bag. Nobody accepted and I got very sad lol.
---
FO76's economy is ridicolous. I can sell chems and stimpaks for 3-7 caps and if I wanto to buy them I've to spend less or more 36-70 caps. I don't know how people can reach 3000 caps and buy serums from Enclave. 
---
Any fix? This is happening to me and it's really aggravating me
---
There needs to be loadouts. Switching out shit every time you want to unlock things, craft things, build bases, and when yo adventure is extremely tedious.
---
Because this game has no roles, roles wouldn‚Äôt be hacker/lockpick either way. Stop making this game seems more intricate or deep than it is lmao
---
So PC is the one thats gets patched quicker. What does that mean? Remember the patch you had yesterday on console? Well, we had two patches and one day in which it was wild west because the first one, the 150fixes one, introduced like 3 game breakers.
---
There are upsides obviously: PCs allow you greater control over UI (modding), and if you're serious about em they offer unparalleled performance.
---
&gt; Behold my field of fucks and see that it is barren.

Of this entire post, the only thing useful is that I now have a new quote for my email siganture block.

Do you have an idea what to do? (Changing hardware is not an option.)
---
Thanks for reading :)
---
The bad news: you'll have to find someone to craft the ammo for you until you can find your own prime receiver plan for the .50. Unlike other weapons, you can not remove the prime receiver from the .50 Cal.
---
What boggles my mind is that there‚Äôs such an easy fix for this: Decks! These things are card, have decks that you can customize and swap easily. It‚Äôs such a no brainer and has been universally suggested by people here.
---
Once again, another time Bethesda need to look at the modding community from their last game and implement all the UI fixes they made. Why should it be up to modders to fix your games Bethesda?
---
Will using fix it good to repair power armor to 200% buff the stats too?
---
Gift them to someone who might need them. Caps still held little value when the dupers werent  as prevalent. Higher tier items were still traded for higher tier items in favor of caps, because people quickly realized there wasnt much value to having 5 characters cap maxed. The real economy is item for item trade. I've always ran into better deals this way. Caps are as annoying as pocket lint, unless you pvp as a career.
---
Not all exploded either. Sometimes I‚Äôll kill three in a row and they all blow up, sometimes none, sometimes only one. I don‚Äôt understand it 
---
That sounds expensive
---
I just stay still for a while after logging in. If you're in view of the Vendors it seems like it's safe to move once they've loaded in.
---
Thanks for posting that suggestion and link. That looks great and now I'm going to have to rebuild my base again lol
---
The skepticism goes beyond having a TSE. Daily, if I see new players in Vault 76 I will fast travel there with power armor chassis, spare ammo, and low level weapons and armor if I have them at that moment. I wait for the players to exit the vault and will greet them, using my mic, and offer up the goods to help on their early journey. More often than not they will thumbs down me and be on their way. 
---
I would definitely give the build a survivability feel with the autos. Commando perks, tank killer, (forget the name of endurance perk for +45 hp at max rank lol), adamantium skeleton, fireproof, adrenaline, class freak, starched genes, serendipitous. Possibly white knight if you want, but those are all the ones that come to mind for athat type of build.
---
It feels out of place.   
---
On the one hand, we have the realistic elements of a survival game. But, then there's this strange card-system for our skills and knowledge. It's like I'm Neo from the Matrix. Oh, I need to learn kung-fu now, better plug that one in...   
---
Just let me know what I know. 
---
It makes sense in an RP manner. They kill you, take your stuff, word gets around about their misdeeds and suddenly there is a target painted on them, either for being a criminal or for having valuables.
---
I noticed that but the mod I lost appeared in my menu.
---
found a mr handy with 3 cats and he was asking for help but talking to him doesn‚Äôt trigger a quest sadly.
---
Yeah, we definitely need loadouts.
---
Meh. I have level three Lock Pick on all the time unless I need to release a point for something else. I'll swap in the Green Bounty card (or whatever it is) if I'm specifically after a lot of plants. Travel agent is pretty much a fixture. The rest I tend to forget about. Though I do kick myself after I've bought something and realised I didn't have Hard Bargain (name?) installed, yet again.
---
If you find someone on your platform they'll probably do it for you for the mats.
---
Double check, but I'm pretty sure it's the normal materials cost plus 1 violet flux per 180 .50 rounds.
---
Nice write up, but I‚Äôd like to contest one thing, and add a second major thing you should have written and didn‚Äôt. 
---
1. Legendaries to look out for: TSE is overrated, particularly on automatic weapons. It can never hit all the shots from an automatic weapon because it destroys recoil. The weapons that can deploy everything in the clip reliably while scoring near double damage on each hit are Bloodied. You need a rad build to drive them, but even if you end up not doing that; they‚Äôre great trading collateral. 
---
2. What to do with excess materials. 
---
Make a million armor pieces and scrap them. Cheapest is always to make the arm piece. Scrapping it can teach you mods for arm, leg and torso of that type. 
---
3. The first set to do this with is leather. It gives back all but one steel of what it takes to craft, so once you‚Äôve got a couple hundred of each of its materials, craft 100 arms, scrap them, repeat until you have all the leather items. 
---
Always do this with the lowest level item to reduce material cost. 
---
4. As you find how to craft a combat, trapper and marine arm, repeat. Their lowest levels don‚Äôt require screws, only non-exotic materials. 
---
This is a steady way of keeping the quantities of low-end resources useful without needing to hoard (or bulk and sell) them. The armored 2 perk also helps reduce crafting costs. 
---
5. If you‚Äôre into it, you can later repeat with the screw-requiring armors (Raider, metal and robot). 
---
I've closed out my game a bunch reloaded. Just let it sit for 15 minutes. Started a new character..still frozen. 
---
I'll have a look thanks
---
I used to rodeo Phogoth in Destiny 1
---
I‚Äôd love to gift them, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôve set a goal out for my C.A.M.P., you know? I‚Äôm super anal about my builds, and want to make it look a lot nicer. Plans aren‚Äôt too cheap, and I‚Äôd love to avoid buying from dupers :/
---
Like stash menu?
---
Cause I'm not seeing it in my inventory
---
But I may at some point in the future, like when we get some content that actually warrants them.
---
Man, I'm super into BDSM.

**S**o
---
**M**any people.
---
Correct. Before the patch it was working (working by 76 standards anyway) now it‚Äôs unplayable for me. Think I might take a break from this game, there‚Äôs too much going against it right now.
---
No idea. :\
---
It's temporary for me.
---
I noticed a second load screen (or at least an extra step), but I still have to wait for everything to appear. Never been attacked at that point though, not once.
---
PC is likely to be the best running of the bunch because you can downscale it if you're having issues.
---
old bug. It's been around for at least a patch or two. Maybe more.
---
We learned the hard way in Fallout 4 that if you killed any robot, just fucking run away for it for a few seconds to see if it explodes.
---
I got better.
---
Ugh, for real?
---
I know it eats mods for ammo... This is news to me
---
That's a good idea. Crash their fucking saves so they lose everything, filthy dupers.
---
Literally the **only** reasons I check safes are for that juicy Tech Data.
---
I don't think you can convert it to regular.
---
I was hoping to build a florists shop.
---
I'd like to say I don't cry myself to sleep every night...
---
But I do.
---
I believe it puts most recent players at the bottom of the list. 
---
That's because they wendigone somewhere else ....
---
Egoistic comment with lots of misspelling and overal terrible english, i am getting downvoted lots of time, who cares, got egouth karma even with my raider posts.
---
Yeet!
---
Yeah but I'm pretty sure I heard before fallout 76's launch that loot couldn't be obtained by players who become wanted...
---
It is objectional as it is a way to circumvent the PVP initiation rules   
---
(lame as they are)  
---
My post is a psa and a suggestion for a rule change to take away this unfair advantage.
---
Very clean and efficient.
---
Yeah I'm not installing mods yet, new bans for mod related reasons are being announced weekly. 
---
I want to see this...so much lol.
---
Lol, shut up and take my upvote xD
---
well for me since im at level 91, I lost 91 caps... not a few caps, just another issue beth needs to solve
---
I wish the wood furnace had a fire on animation.
---
It's impossible to avoid them completely but good luck. Just remember items are more valuable than their cap amount if that makes sense. And if you have a rare item and someone is willing to trade you an insane amount of loot for your one item, you found yourself a duper.
---
I know...I hate taking pictures with my collar flashing. I wish we could have a dog collar made out of leather instead. Leather is so much...nicer on skin...
---
You shod have two independent sets of cards. Combat cards and passive cards that have separate point pools. But nope, it's "designed the Bethesda way" once again.
---
Nuke mines at the feet, step away, shoot the mines.
---
Even if it's just in the form of some furniture pieces having "anchors" that you can attach an item to. Like a metal shelf having 3 anchors per shelf, and you just select which item you want in the places the anchors are on. I'd accept that!
---
Yes. Skin tight dresses would be...fun :)
---
Sure, it makes sense from a role play perspective. It does NOT make sense from a Bethesda said we could opt out of participating in PVP perspective though.
---
I can slap on pacifist mode and refuse to defend myself in any way, shape or form. The player killing me despite that still gets rewarded and I still get punished.
---
That's NOT good game design. If we weren't given the illusion we could opt out it would honestly be fine. Instead trying to avoid PVP makes us an even more juicy target to high damage builds. They can likely kill me through slap damage before I can turn pacifist mode off and get a free stash. 
---
The one with the *soothing voice*.
---
simple fix: make all group players share wanted bounties (at least on My, part in THIS case)
---
lmao same, except luckily my loot was all stored
---
Do you know where the handmade spawn is in Berkely springs? (because I don't want you to go without a handmade now)
---
I mean, I dont know about that, but it's always been as is. Why would you take away the REASON to become wanted? I hate to admit this publically but killing other players is the quick way to farm junk in this game.
---
I actually jazzed my pants when I read your title.
---
It led to a heated breakfast conversation with my family.

Sent you a request

true, just that I'm realising it now lol

yeah, I don't often... usually just if someone smashes up my base.

floppies ? you guys are so entitled. I had to type my games in basic from a paper magazine. then save to audio tape.
---
Love how you gotta jump to vague accusations and condescending terms once you've been presented with facts and arguments.
---
I'm not a fan boy of bethesda. I kinda hate the fact they are in charge of one of my favourite universe, and I really wish many many things had been done in a better way for this license.
---
However, this game is two months old, under correction every two weeks, new content is in sight, and it's not nearly as bad as many people tell to surf some hype. If you think it's only under maintenance, do so, be happy and live your life. But the current situation is just not what maintenance means.
---
As a level 200+ I personally hate running into other 200+ level players, at least, if they are part of a group. 
---
Chance of them being awful from my experience is like 95%.  Solo, put it at even odds.
---
I was already used to legendary bots exploding thanks to Automatron in F4. So it came as a bit of a shock when one of the first few legendary bots I encountered in F76 didn't explode immediately, and instead waited for the moment I went in to loot...
---
what? am I having fun wrong?
---
It was a TSE handmade that I'm tryna look for but I'm fine. I'm a melee build and that was my ranged weapon that I don't use to often. But anyways thanks for the tip! (Might need to get scrap some handmades)
---
The only rules of Bird Law is that Bird is the Word.

During all this time you could server hop. Its shitty but if I dont wanna die I hit alt-f4. We were all ready to traverse our very own wasteland but we forgot some of us really liked the raiders. 
---
Got my new character good. My actual character is stuck in WS and of course I keep getting spawned into nuke zones and can't wait to long cause I don't wanna lose all my loot üò≠
---
There was also a lvl95 Behemoth up north at a small farm near the Water Park. The Area needs to be nuked I think (only time I saw it there was when nuked).
---
Well you have your own opinion, for me that would take all fun from already lame PVP. Whats the difference then from rushing to regular mobs? This guys, made a decent content and I applaud them for that. 
---
What is this a Facebook dog meme? 
---
I'm level 90, but I don't have any super-special hypder-damage weapons like you guys. So I usually hit the scorchbeast(s) with my Endangerol syringer once every two minutes, and spend the rest of my time with my damage-suppressing tesla rifle, trying to keep the additional mobs down.
---
its not nearly as bad, its worse. the fact that you cant even see THAT proves the fact that you are, indeed, a fanboy. the game is in a CATASTROPHIC state of miserable failure. it barely functions on even a BASIC level, let alone everything else wrong with it on top of that. like, wtf dude?
---
Just do some other quests and/or get a higher level and try again. You have to expect higher level enemies around Whitesprings/Golf course, it's a popular place for many to farm XP. Other way would be to invite a higher level player and ask to help out. If you are on Xbox I could help you.
---
This comment just proves that you have no idea about rarity or may just play with dupers all the time.       
---
Coal is indeed the rarest ressource. Fluxes, Ultracite, Black Titanium, Springs, Screws &amp; even ballistic fiber are easier to gather. There are on√∂y a few places where you can built coal extractors &amp; coal doesnt drop as loot afaik. You just get it rarely from some ash heap events, mines or extractors.
---
Nah dude with the lastast patch I'm immune to explosion damage 
---
Yeah, and players participating in PVP are perfect targets. I was told I can opt out, and I can't. That's really the problem here. A lot of people don't want to do PVP. Bethesda said "Don't worry, you won't have to". Turns out that's a lie.
---
A PVP server would be awesome. Honestly I enjoy PVP right now to an extent, but if I just want to hang out and camp build today I should be able to. Because I was told I would be able to.
---
Xerox things? What does this mean?

The problem is white springs is a hot spot for high level players due to numerous reasons so any high level player that happens to be around will trigger the high enemy levels I‚Äôd just avoid the golf course till your higher level or if you must go there stick to the main road ways that are protected by the security. I imagine all the security was put in to protect the low level players 
---
If you use the hologram version you'll never have that issue. 
---
I do not believe in bans for non-cheating client side UI  improvement mods. I do believe that changes in how items look (i.e. glowing magazines) indeed get you banned.
---
I don't believe Bethesda is stupid. They done a lot of unpopular design decisions that saves the game from more serious problems. Banning friendly and noncheating players is like ultra-stupid, hence I do not believe it to be true, especially consideres amount of fake news that is released by people without lives and characters.
---
Yeah they‚Äôre all +6x ghouls, in and around those shops. 
---
At my level I‚Äôm gonna need PA, stim, &amp; endurance or another body to tank ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If you are in a workshop dont carry shit on you. I can activate that workshop and anyone in my group can shoot you. This also applies to being across the map. I can activate your workshop, while you're chilling at home chatting with my buddy, who just turned red and shot you for whatever caps and junk you have. This also applies to anyone in my or your party, respectively. I get a little giddy every time I see a party of people at a workshop.
---
It's not just the dupers though. Other legit things in game makes an economy for basic supplies pretty pointless.
---
I just drop a bunch of chems and junk I can't sell to vendors quick enough. Same too with plans.
---
One time I purchased some plans off someone, a bundle of 10 for 500 caps. I did it out of charity more than really needing the plans. A good portion were ones I'd already learned too but didn't bother me.
---
Another improve one thing break something else.  Noticed it last night straight after the patch on Xbox.
---
Just thought I'd share that tidbit 
---
Give us your secrets :o
---
What do you mean can't be open from traditional mean?
---
It is shitty, you're right. I shouldn't have to quit to to desktop for ANY reason. Bethesda accidentally made a game where it's more rewarding and fun to be a raider. It's almost funny. Almost. 
---
At work right now, will check tonight, probably
---
If you're on PC, there's a mod on Nexus that prevent the scrapping of those mods. Absolute game changer. Same too with the latest one that shows you which plans you've already learned.
---
Wait, what's so good about them ?
---
If you're on PC there's a [loadout manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
It's been suggested a lot so hopefully Bethesda fixes it. It's so tedious especially if you need to do a quick pick/hack when enemies are around. Takes about 10x as long to swap out the cards just to pick a lot.
---
You can counter Explosive weapons with the new Fireproof perk. They added it as nerf
---
Ah this explains my disappearing mod! Found my first PA mod in the wild went to use it and it was gone! And all I'd done was scrap my junk, I'd convinced myself I'd never picked it up
---
Dear Bethesda: my game either gets disconnected or Crashed to Desktop at least 4 times an hour. What are you doing about this? It's happening to my friends too, it's not our computers, and we are leaving the game and looking for other games to play. YOU ARE LOSING US PC players
---
I just saw that will watching ghost story videos i fricking left when it shook and I looked and saw the turning photo stop and I left the game xD. **None** of that.
---
You can't tell me you didnt think once that some asshole (hi) is gonna enjoy accruing a wanted level so people hunt them down. Also if you're still banking on Hot Toddy's promises I highly suggest playing games from a different company altogether because holy shit they never finish anything they start.
---
Nothing to do with the patch, finally found mine at Grafton while being 62 last week. All it takes is a bit of luck and a copious amount of switching
---
I said you should be able to craft different level lock picks and hacking darts (got the idea from Bioshock) and got downvoted hardcore. 
---
I'd rather they spoil your roleplaying than have people asking 25K+ caps for a single-shot explosive that I'll never be able to afford or farm Whitesprings for months and get squat.
---
It's a change in the most recent patch. I was stung with a bounty too.
---
For any supply drops that aren't yours, you have to wait for the original person to unlock it before you can loot it.
---
Also you needn't wait long as they are separating the cry babies from the pvpers with servers and game modes.
---
I'm actually pretty okay with this part of it. I'm not sure how I feel about players being able to fast travel to me when they try to take my workshop, but that's nit picking. 
---
Workshops are PVP. You claim one and you agreed to PVP. If somebody guns me down afterwards alls well. It's my fault I took over a workshop and proceeded to run around with nothing but a pipe pistol lmao.
---
I'm in a clan that rps as raiders. If I had chosen any other faction to RP I'd be so damn bored.
---
Wasn‚Äôt there tame stuff on the computer about the lifestyle? If modding was opened up, you could have some really risqu√© stuff on there for a wanderer to find. Porn on a pc, who knew? I‚Äôd make it lvl3 hack though..
---
Harper's Ferry after 3 mins rounded up some ghouls, quick death for the AFK, killed the ghouls .  XP and more stuff to trade, winning.
---
I'm around 3500 and have no intentions on using them. Nothing worth spending for imho. 
---
I'm level 204 or so and I always leave stuff for lower levels (legendaries, mats, aid) after an event, I always let other people get shots in before killing, and I will stimpack you if you are dying and able to be stimpacked. You need not automatically fear us higher levels. I play solo a lot because I play when my friends aren't on yet; and I'm fairly shy too. I'm just as worried about you killing me with stacked bobbleheads or the like... 
---
If the loot is crap and obtaining it is crap, well, crap plus crap equals crap. You can make getting the loot as interesting as you want, but if the loot itself isn't interesting, then it's garbage. FF14 is currently suffering from this.
---
Kind of glad I've slowed down on playing now. Will probably stop all together if they do go through with it. 
---
Worldwide there's a ton. Anecdotal evidence of a BGS source talking to a youtuber put the number at 800,000 concurrent players about a month after launch. Divide that by 24ish and it's a ton.
---
As to how many YOU have access to though, that's another story.
---
&gt; I don't know how people can reach 3000 caps and buy serums from Enclave. 
---
That's really easy. 
---
I've sold an legendary Spear for 3000 caps a while ago :)
---
You can also easily sell unwanted legendary weapons and armor for 30 - 60 caps each if you use the Hard Bargain perk and/or grape mentats. I'm also picking up all of the hardened mass and glowing blood when I'm farming the Whitesprings nuke zone. Most of time I have so much loot after farming the nuke zone that I can't even sell it all within a day because of the vendor cap limit.
---
really? paranoia is getting the better of this sub.
---
you need to understand the servers are shit. with or without dupers. chances are, it was just chocking. the servers are so bad, in fact, that crafting *anything* in large quantities will mess them up- I was short on water on an alt, so I popped a rad-x and began collecting water. 1K units. halfway through the server started chocking. then I walked back to my camp to boil it. got at least three "server not responding" popups. when I was done, I drank one. got instantly dced.
---
hope it didn't boot anyone else, but in my experience the *old* duping method only affected people in the general vicinity and not the entire server.
---
Fairly sure he is saying duping by making a reference to a popular copier brand.
---
Isn't this month old news and was debunked as either leftover code from prelaunch or something to be a part of the weekly events betheada is adding to the game eventually l'm
---
It‚Äôs a quest you can rinse and repeat as often or little as you want, IIRC. You still get exp and stuff for each time you complete it.
---
being capable of making a build that makes you near impervious to player damage in a game like this is just silly heh. Like , you could be cancer to the community if you wanted, right? go around, destroying camps with no worry about being killed.
---
Here's an unpopular opinion, lets talk about perk cards and game balance. There are basically 3 types of perk cards: Essential Cards, Conveniency Cards, and Situational Cards. These types of cards are self explanatory, but lets talk a bit about them to better understand them. Each type of card has its pros and cons...
---
* Essential Cards are a must, without it, you wouldn't be able to perform optimally. These cards must be on your character at all times to be active, therefore, you'll be using plenty of slots since being optimal would require you to invest in multiple tiers (e.g. Commando, Expert Commando, Master Commando).
---
* For Conveniency Cards, they're not required, however, they will make the game less tedious. The fewer of these cards you use, the more you have to compensate through other methods, however, it frees up slots. This is basically determined by your play-style. This cards are required to be on your characters at all times to work.
---
* Situational Cards, similar to Conveniency Cards, except they're not required to be on you at all times, however, the con to them is that it's an inconvenience because you have to swap between them and remember to swap them out, doing so will net you extra slots. Be sure to have the minimum points required to fully use these cards.
---
So if Situational Cards are pain the in ass, then they're doing their job in exchange for extra slots. If you hate swapping cards, then redirect your points. Yes, it's not advised or it isn't the solution you want, but it's the solution to your problem if you refuse to compensate.
---
Duping
---
Noo, haha. Even though you got the PA satation plan for finishing the quest. Bummer...
---
So I have about 4 Tech Datas I've picked up recently, what do I get when I turn them in?
---
If they don't want to make them passives or something they need to give us load outs. 
---
That's ironic lol
---
pretty sure it's new stuff that just got added to the code. kinda hard to defend them now, huh?
---
Yeah except you're not completely immune, your ap goes down when hit and if a high RoF weapon fires on you for long you will die pretty quick, anything with a low fire rate however, cannot drain my ap faster than it can recharge, especially if they are reloading in between.
---
You'll be told it would cause severe server instability.
---
Then later we'll get fancy pool tables with balls in atom shop.
---
PS4: Listen, I want to play the game, I really do but now it‚Äôs just getting stupid... I‚Äôm getting 2 minute long load screens when joining a world only for it to take a further 2-3 minutes to even fully load in.
---
Not to mention in the last 4 hours I‚Äôve had more disconnects than a week prior. As a result I‚Äôve had to do the same quest 3 times because of the rollback!
---
I know hotfixes are hard to get out in a timely manner for console because the certification process, but I think something like this should try and be patched ASAP instead of waiting to the end of the month.
---
Also, I‚Äôm getting constant issues where ‚ÄòControls are temporarily disabled‚Äô shows up and disappears only for it to reappear a second or two later.
---
It‚Äôs awesome to hear about that. I‚Äôve definitely been at the butt end of bad situations in this game, whether it be griefers or people worried that you would somehow steal their loot. But it‚Äôs good to know that their is some altruism to offset the bad behavior. As of tonight I just started a new character (My previous build didn‚Äôt turn out how I expected due to careless perk picks and absentminded special choices) and as I left Vault 101 a level 120+ came over and dropped a ton of level five gear and some Stimpaks. They waved then simply ran away. As someone who has played before, I know that I don‚Äôt really require the extra help as if I were a brand new player, but the gesture was really nice and set me way ahead in terms of supplies and a full, modded armor set. I will be sure to pay it forward in any way that I can. 
---
Sure thing buddy.
---
It's wonderful that you still take time to read and comment on posts about such an horrific game. I suggest you find another occupation if the game is soooo lame and "catastrophic", and that you leave the people who remember it's a game to enjoy it.
---
No, the lunchbox thing is month old news. We've known since early December. And have yet to hear anything new about it since. 
---
Who is crying here? I paid money for a game, that game does not have the features I was told it would. No crying, just pointing out a fact.
---
As to accruing a wanted level, sure people will. Again, it's not that they can kill me that's the problem. It's that they are rewarded for it. Rewards make it a, well, rewarding thing to do. 
---
Rewarding somebody for something they, by the developers own words, ARE NOT supposed to do is bad game design. That's not crying. It's stating a fact. I like the game. I will keep playing the game. That in no way means I'm not allowed to be upset for feeling I was lied to, and that in no way means I can't call it out for being the bad game design choice it is.
---
Have some patience I get it you didn‚Äôt get what you bought but even battlefield has issues. Like only a few days ago I was fighting an invisible tank... 
---
I agree, it is content... But it only works by exploring a not commonly know rule (my engaging a wanted player allowing other players to ambush me) and thus is lame.
---
East of silo bravo there's a big open Clifton with a tonne of flat land. 
---
The problem is that I don't think Bethesda can tell the difference. They are detecting mods and banning people and it's not clear where they draw the line so why risk your account 
---
Sure they wanna piss off even more ppl  /s
---
I saw the a group of ghouls takedown mr. Handy leading a bunch of cats. He was on some mission to get them wixon or some homestead.
---
I watched a video posted a couple days ago (I think?) showing new code related to the lunch boxes.
---
Your build should maybe have included the "Text formater" perk, wich make it easier to break walls of text.
---
Sorry no room for it with all my agility and perception :/
---
The rule of regexes is you can use regular expressions to match regular grammars.  Regular grammars don't have nesting, so regexes can't recognise nested shit.  Like HTML and XML or LISP or....
---
Haha i knew people are just complaining noobs, pvp is not broken, you just need something like resilence in world of warcraft, **Make pvp build so you can pvp better**.
---
There is actually a store or something in the early parts of the game, flatwoods maybe?  That have two cats and a skeleton in a dress with 2 plastic cat dishes.
---
Which sucks, but will there be actual loot in it if they take it all? 
---
They actually tame \*you\*
---
Hahahaha. The bug doesn‚Äôt remove the bonus when exiting or dying. The bug is that you get double when you log in. 
---
Guess you‚Äôll have to learn to manage your inventory better, because when they actually fix the bug, you‚Äôll be screwed. 
---
So u need to kill those gouls at whitespring?
---
Cuz u can find them everywhere. 
---
The other day I got a "Disconnected from server". I was quite angry with the game, and I blamed Bethesda, the dupers, etc.
---
But it was my internet connection. It came back in a minute.
---
They‚Äôre several ‚Äòrooms‚Äô in.  They spawn in an area with a lot of somewhat fresh meat chunks scattered around. (you can see it better if you turn your light on) Typically there‚Äôs just one, I‚Äôve seen two in there on one occasion.
---
Ahh... Ok that makes sense
---
If it happens it happens. No skin off my nose either way. 
---
Look that from my perspective: See decent bounty, crouch(so that I will teleport crouched) and teleport somewhere near their location. Use stealth-boy perk with stealth boy , pop  mentats for enemy to glow, scout, look for sniper locations for chameleon effect. Sigh, just random thrasher. Pop psycho, one TSE bullet, done , go away disappointed.
---
Sad that people paid actual sums of money have less creative flair and passion than those working in their free time, for free. 
---
Agreed.
---
I‚Äôve had impatient jerks try to push me out cuz obviously they‚Äôre lives and time so much more important then some lowbie.
---
Scrap, leave or wait.
---
Yeah that's what I've been saying, people need to quit relying on power armor and get those legendary armors, even a set of sentinel without assassin is quite a defence buff, and anybody can run dense mod with fireproof for immunity to explosions!
---
Yeah makes sense but i use ultracite pa. It's so unexplained why they don't want skin for these two pa.
---
If I need to go afk  for a minute I just fast travel to a train station, dump my junk in the stash, and sit down on a bench like I'm waiting for a train. 
---
Someone kills me and I'm not losing much. 
---
Yeah... at the time, i was working on getting Rifleman perks and did not have any crit or sneaking perks.
---
I was hidden and tried to move around to get out of the area, but when moving, they detected me.
---
The Playtime power just needs a rusty van that has "free candy" painted on the side to complete to look.
---
Get rid of your tse and maybe you will enjoy the game more...
---
I totally get that. I don't blame you. Somebody needs to be the bad guys right, and sometimes being the bad guy is fun. The issue is again, Bethesda said we could opt out and we can't.
---
Wanted players are actively rewarded for getting players not prepared to fight. And sure, that's like the whole point of raiders. They don't pick fights with people that are going to cream them. They wouldn't be survive long being that stupid. Again, not the point. 
---
I should be able to opt out of PVP when I'm just chilling and building my camp. Not even because *I* want that, but because Bethesda said we could.
---
But that does sound like a good pvp 
---
The fuck?
---
We -are- supposed to be rebuilding after all.  Id love some ramshackle transport options like a junk train, brahmin caravan.
---
10/10 was in my stash somehow
---
TSE Instigating Anti-armor Quad ammo 5 star BB gun plz.
---
I understand it's just odd as I had been on for at least half an hr in watoga then whitesprings and no lag or server is not responding message. Only when I was in front of and around this guy when he was in crafting mode. Just odd as I have played alot fallout 76 and never experienced this even back on release.
---
I had think Jackson Pollack, lolz.
---
I agree, there‚Äôs plenty of paint cans. All over. How about letting us loot &amp; scavenge our own paint.
---
Well I try to make content for myself, so I appreciate someone else doing the same, even if it doesn't sound fair.
---
a video... from one of those clickbait desperate youtubers trying to avoid that  9 to 5. Fake News.
---
could you post a link to your build? I'm leveling one myself except I'm speccing for shotguns instead.
---
wanted something to compare it to.
---
I say the same thing I said to someone else, I wouldn't trust the company that regularly released unfinished games to make good on their word. I heard how bad this game was before I got it and was like yeah right its not as bad as new Vegas on launch and well, it wasn't. I'm a little shocked they fucked up an online game this bad but not surprise they released something too early.
---
I used to mod for Fallout 4, and despite the doubts exhibited by everyone here I can confirm that NPCs can spawn as radroaches.   
---
Cruror on the Steam Forums explains it thusly:   
---
&gt; I'm adding this for anyone else who finds this issue googles "raiders named radroach" This is caused when you are too low level to spawn the lowest level of enemy that should be there. In this case, you must have been level 1 0r 2 and the lowest level raiders able to spawn for that npc were say, 4. This bugged out the game and it tried to spawn the wimpiest thing it could, a radroach.  
---
&gt;This is a side product of Bethesda having to make everything super easy. God forbid you \*gasp\* died or got hurt my enemies too strong for you!  
---
&gt;To fix this issue, type "lcharraider" in the filter in the creation kit. click on the first lcharraider. You will see "calculate from all levels &lt;= PC's level" You can make sure different things will spawn at level 1, stopping this issue, and making the game harder, and more rewarding at the same time, as you can now find and kill a high level enemy early in the game. 
---
This doesn't mean this is the same glitch, mind you, but it's not unheard of either.
---
No in my crafting menu. In my case it was polymer combat armour 
---
All the prime receivers I got dropped from scorchbeasts or the queen
---
The sky is falling!
---
same. Some guy and his gang destroyed my based, then hid in their base, which was made out of concrete foundations and invulnerable upper floors so I couldn't retaliate. When I asked why they destroyed my camp, they tried encouraging me to commit suicide irl. I had a good laugh. This was the first time I'd encountered people like this. Loving the pathetic toxicity...
---
Also it was more than 3 it was about 30 not responding messages I have video which I will upload just need to edit it so don't release player's name as such 
---
Geez, that sucks! If you are on pc, i have like 2000lbs of hoarded weapons and apparel on a mule. You can take a weapon if you like for free? I had the same happen to me, with the bag not loading, but it was my "all rise" super sledge, when i was rocking a melee build. I was devastated! I started some shit with dupers, by stealing all their ammo in a bin. They caught me and we got into a fight. 3 v me is not good though. Dropped my all rise and junk to engage with them again, after getting it all back. Bad idea... server gone! I add people now randomly, just to have a server logged for that issue!
---
Me too. I was hoping the new update was supposed to improve the game. Now it is unplayable! 
---
The worst performance I have experienced since I first purchased it. Double loading to join a server that takes forever. Frame rate drops on everything! Not just combat but opening a safe even!
---
And then being dropped from the server.
---
Total playing time 10 mins.
---
I want a refund. This is ridiculous!
---
The "Two Shot" effect does exactly what it says in the weapon description: "shoots an extra projectile". For shotguns, it fires one extra pellet (9 instead of 8). 
---
Now, you're taking about Two Shot ***explosive*** shotguns. They still fire one extra pellet, but also add 16 explosive damage ***per pellet***.
---
What you see in your pip-boy is the total damage of all pellets added together, including the added explosive damage, after all damage multipliers (perk cards, chems, bobbleheads, mutations, etc.) Are applied.
---
Anyway, my original point was that the single extra pellet's small amount of damage can potentially be multiplied into the hundreds or even thousands if you use the right buffs. 
---
Eh, I would love them to make Exploding perk PVE like some other perks, but then they would need to restrict melee damage as well.
---
Best get farming then
---
I just find it odd that you people go to such lengths, dissecting every sentence, to deny the existence of lunch boxes.
---
so what if they're real? based on the source, they're tame enough to be something Bethesda would implement. the team behind worked on the mobile game, remember?
---
That's why I'm a sniper too. You can easily kill wanted players from a distance. I sneak alot and I have an chameleon armor piece, so good luck finding me.
---
This 100%, combined with configurable setups so we can change them our like for crafting since not every skill would work well to be passive.
---
The shit part is the is pretty much the only way people will see your camp. There needs to be town like areas that allow us to build close to each other.
---
Seems those lunchboxes will be interesting for pvp..  Not my thing anyway
---
Why are you trying to pick locks when you are in a battle?
---
This guy's a fucking genious! 
---
still checks out. the servers suck.
---
Every person who plays any game and cannot manage to simply kill one person, because they're simply more skilled, and know more about how to make builds and stuff that work great for this game, are the kind of people who call everyone a hacker. My buddies and I were playing earlier, and some level 70 or so comes up to the munitions factory, even though we owned it, and he started pointing his guns at us, shooting past our heads, and such. We finally got him to leave. Then we went to his camp, which was right down the road from the factory. And my buddy shot his whole camp to a bare foundation, with his TSE hand made rifle, and TSE pump shotgun, which does about 1,600 damage a shot. He then fast traveled away. And after about 20 minutes, my friend just gets kicked and cannot get back on. We think he got banned or something because of this kid not knowing how TSE weapons work. 
---
I'm ready for that yt link from the last week telling me that lunchboxes are on the way :)
---
Wavy Willards usually has a couple as well. Boring location but easy pickings.
---
Can‚Äôt anyone rant about game UX without it being a social media whore optimization tactic?
---
White patriot head, left arm and right leg. 
---
SR-71 torso, left leg and right arm. 
---
Legendary weapons should gone at all
---
i do the same whenever im at that event or others, im well above 160 by now and i bash it with my wep so i get a tag then kite it back for others to tag before i kill it, just in case someone else wouldnt be as kind :&gt;
---
even dropping all my crap legendary drops once the event is over at the bench there in case anyone wanted some of the 1-2 star crap and rare cases 3 star.
---
Maybe hes was creating huge amounts of stuff
---
Hi mate, are you able to craft me one as well?
---
Will pay or trade.
---
I don't know what I'm more sick of the bugs in the game or the people bitching about stuff like this... it takes 2 seconds to change your cards... it really isn't THAT hard or time consuming to do! You just want the game to be easier so you can then complain it's too easy Bethesda cant win!
---
It looks ok on combat armor, 
---
And ONLY on combat armor.
---
*genius   
---
   
---
yes. yes I am.
---
Picture this... in one of the 12000 buildings, with a locked door or safe. Try to access said door/safe. Muck about with perk card, ghoul appears to say hi. It normally happens when you clear an area, then another player comes to the area. That spawns in all the enemies you have just cleared.
---
I did this a few times now but i could never talk to the Robot after i killed J47.
---
I finished the recruitment quest at the fort befor and have my soldier certificat on me but the dmn Robot won't talk to me ...
---
All good my dude go get that well rested and well tuned bonus
---
I agree, some people can't handle getting outsmarted by others and want Bethesda to add all kinds of lame mechanics to cater their playstyle.
---
Wow, disingenuous too...
---
&gt; I‚Äôm just asking for your thoughts. 
---
No you're not. On the face of it it's clear you're not. There isn't anything that could even remotely be considered a question or request for comments.
---
The kind way to put it is to say that your post is a rant. It's really more of a whinge if we're being honest with each other.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt care if you are mad. I don‚Äôt care if ‚Äúdupes ruin the economy!‚Äù I do not give two shits if someone blasts up your mobs before you can hit them and they die. I don‚Äôt care at all if you saved everyone and killed the dirty cheating duper game time ruiners and dropped their loot in the ocean.  
---
&gt;Let‚Äôs even go deeper. I don‚Äôt care if you are quitting, or this is the last straw, or the game disconnected again and you are sad. I‚Äôve lost SBQ loot dozens of times, as have most.  
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt care at all if someone put on their wrecking ball perk and introduced you to their Daisycutter and you‚Äôre so upset. I do not care if you‚Äôre mad at someone‚Äôs turrets at whitespring.  
---
&gt;Behold my field of fucks and see that it is barren. 
---
You are so tsundere, it hurts! Wanting people to know how much you don't care by going on and on about it.
---
I'm surprised you didn't end your post with a "b-baka".
---
This happened to me while backpeddling away from a legendary frogcrawler. 
---
that's... not what I said at all. but OK.
---
Yeah, i've been wandering with a friend. He's 31 now and i'm 26. Going to the top of the world is doable, but doing the supermutant camp part of the mission is extremely hit or miss in terms of who's around. If we're alone in the region the mutants will be lvl 15 - 30, but if there's someone else everyone is 50+. 
---
Even in the forest and ash heap the monster will jump to 50+ if there's a lvl50 guy in that same region. Makes it hard to go through your missions and it burns ammo like crazy. 
---
Good, the games needs more!
---
I try a bit as well: I made a hunting lodge by Whitespring (no turrets) and have had some great times with groups of low level players greatful for some shelter while trying to say alive. 
---
From my experience, yup.
---
It isn't, you probably decided to rush in and attack and it's your own fault that you didn't have a good attack strategy. It's your own fault that you got outsmarted by a group.
---
I like what you‚Äôre saying. I don‚Äôt know if your solution is the exact answer, but I understand what you‚Äôre getting at. 
---
Does assassin and sentinel stack for &gt;=100%?
---
The clipping needs an overall overhaul. I found this sick raider base that I was going to build off of.. but I can't touch it. I can place my C.A.M.P there but there's no point.
---
They did for me and my buddy, though we thought the banjo sounded a bit weird with the rest of the instruments. We ended up making the banjo stay under the stairs at his house for being bad.
---
So looking at your screen your are using the perk loadout manager and i am assuming the better inventory mod (because why wouldn't you).
---
There has been issues in the past with some of the atom store items textures not loading especially after updates or if the ini files isn't setup properly. A good way to check is to go into the atom store and make sure you can still see the pictures of the items for sale. Make sure that your ini file is setup ok and there are no duplicates copies of it. Lastly remove the ini file all together to load the game with no mods to confirm if it is a problem with the game or the mods.
---
Not sure with the recent updates if we need to wait for any updates for the mods. Best of luck.

I have a great method which worked well with a friend.  
---
Go after them.  Take the first caps hit.  Crouch when respawn and have your friend 10ft away behind you.  
---
Look on the map for the bounty guy.   Cover his flanks and find the snipers.  Make sure to pop some stealth boys.  When you do find the snipers.  Don't crouch or hide.  Halo jump and rain bloody fire from above.  9 times out of 10 you will win the battle. 
---
Unfortunately, often times it is those same players who bash your bash to bits.
---
Its simple,  add the items as camp items,  have a plan for them or add a plan on use or scrap ect.  Then they are different items you can place in your camp but are not steapable as they are camp decor like a chair.
---
Normal mats plus the violet flux and 1 piece of ultracite scrap.  It‚Äôs only 180 per batch if you have lvl 2 Ammosmith 
---
God knows. I was in a nuke zone last night and only levelled up once so it must be quite different. 
---
Instantaneously swapable decks are not a solution, it equals to having all perks active all the time.
---
Seems like the way it should work is if you hold the joystick in a certain direction, it goes until it reaches the end, then doesn't cycle back to the beginning unless you push the joystick again as a separate motion. It should also work in both directions.
---
Have you looked through the challenges? Should say something under there if not, it might be a hidden achievement and if that's not the case, well, then there is no achievement for it. 
---
There‚Äôs hardly any enemies either. I understand they have to tweak it and keep it fair but now it‚Äôs rubbish! 
---
You can do something very similar to savescumming by logging out and in and checking the watoga or whitesprings train merchant (where SBQ, WS and uranium fever players off load loot). Same same.

It is a low health rifle build and my mutations are eagle eyes, marsupial, speed demon, and adrenal reaction. Coupled with my armor and a bloodied explosive Gauss rifle as my main weapon followed by my TSE lever action.
---
Happened to me aswell. Some lower level started shooting me. First i thought it was an accident because i was hammering ghouls but he kept shooting me. So suddenly i started to shoot him back and high level player appeared and he killed me instantly with a tse weapon. 
---
Well that is what community wanted. Beth gave 15 minute afk timer, but community wanted bigger timer. Here you go, now you have 45 min afk timer.

I had a strategy that a was assuming that pvp engagement in pvp was solo... Which was wrong, but had not come up in 200+ hrs... My post is to make other players aware of it

Hey doom sayer, wait til something actually happens before crying about the end of the world.
---
At least use a more reputable source. This dude has been crazy anti-BGS from no long after the Greenbrier event. Probably butt-hurt that they weren't invited.
---
The loot has been strange. Before the patch I was getting 1 star legendaries from normal enemies and then last night when I was trying to search corpses they were disappearing in front of me 
---
It's funny calling it a Wendigo Cave because there is literally only 1 in there. Ghouls at the front, Mirlurks furthur down, then Mirelurks kings and one single Wendigo at the end.
---
Exact same thing here haha, I was staring at a legendary Mr. Gutsy I killed waiting for it to go off. It hadn't after a little while but as soon as I took a few steps towards it *BOOM*. Killed me instantly.
---
That's what I think but that much to create lag must be spamming an item of some sort and was I the low Lvl area so as not to raise suspicion from lol in higher Lvl areas 
---
Unlocking a perk card permanently at level increments would be nice. At least for minor perks like hacker, lockpick or travel agent.
---
Maybe every 15 levels which would give insensitive to continue leveling. So 45 levels for a level 3 perk card.
---
Put them in your stash, once you've done some bos quests, take them out one at a time and the 'forbidden knowledge' quest should trigger. Only do one at a time though as they sometimes merge into just one quest item.
---
Nuke zones. Pick up all the ionized meat, glowing blood, and nuclear waste. The other items mentioned above are used for stable flux, and while valuable, would be wasted for cap farming. 
---
Without any perks/drugs and Charisma at only 3, I get 4 caps each from the blood and meat. It‚Äôs easy to pick up tons of each in a single run.  Nuclear waste also is 1 cap each. I have no trouble collecting my 1400 caps daily.  If I run out of these items, I just sell junk like fiberglass (just start picking up phones), asbestos (from cigarettes) and waste antiseptic (from abraxo after its been scrapped to get the acid)
---
From ppl not lol and was in not was I.

Aw, I wanted to create an place equal to  [Minefield](http://fallout.wikia.comMinefield/) in Appalachia.

That "bind key" is essentially what this thread OP meant when he asked if you wanted all perks on at once. Which is what the bind key does. Unless you institute a cool down or limit the area it fan be done.

Doesn‚Äôt cause issues anywhere else there are pool tables with pool balls. But that won‚Äôt really matter.

I realized later yesterday that my bugged budget increased when I moved my camp, too. I too have 30% right know.
---
I wrote a ticket and /u/jessbethesda got my game ID so the guys can find out what went wrong. I hope there will be a fix at some time.
---
Thanks, they vanished, i don't know why
---
Same here. Every single patch for this game has made it worse. Its to the point of being unplayable now. Its literally rolling the dice to load in and not get stuck/glitched to where you can't move, and then another roll of the dice about getting disconnected or the game crashing. Add to that the load screens now take much longer, and often I load in only to get a 2nd load screen, and I might actually play 20 minutes out of an hour. From a LONGTIME fallout fan, this is the worst halfa$$ cashgrab of an unfinished game I have ever played. There is a special place in hell for whomever greenlights these "patches." They address very few, if any, real problems, and create a multitude of new ones. Any other industry that sold a product in this unfinished state would be hit with a class action lawsuit. I highly doubt I'm alone in that I truly enjoyed the time I could actually play this game, but today did it for me. Bethesda has lost another loyal customer. 
---
Ok, just wondering cause someone else said different 
---
Solution to this would be to have the up and down d-pad  increment by 20, while left and right increment by 1 for all around convenience. If can't swap between 1 and max quantity, then wtf...
---
Yep, and a lot of bluescreens, like more in just one day than ive had in the past month. Hope we get a hotfix quick :c
---
Hi mate, are you able to craft me a couple as well? Happy to pay or trade.
---
What about mines of different type? Can you place 2 per type or just 2 overall?
---
Green Thumb plus Unstable Flux in a nuke zone sells for a tone. Run around and pick some flowers and sell to all vendors before it turns into Inert Flux. Easiest money ever.
---
Also as mentioned above while others are farming legendary weapons to sell all you need to do is loot the meat piles left behind (in a nuke zone) and pick up up the left overs (hardened mass and glowing blood) to sell.
---
I tried using the nailboard and fire axe but slow weapons don't feel as satisfying to me
---
I wanted to thanks u/BlackAccipiter for making that website, it changed my life.
---
Nope but stating facts helps keeps moronic individuals like yourself in the know. Anyone with a brain can see the failure that is 76, let alone the horrific condition the live game is in. Again, it barely functions. I don't understand how you can be so blinded by fanboyism to not notice how poor the condition the game is in. 
---
But in probably just feeding the troll at this point
---
That's not how the mouth harp works.
---
You don't blow on it when you play.
---
It uses the acoustics within your mouth to make the sound.
---
I‚Äôm on right now and can‚Äôt move, rip
---
It's currently bugged (at least on my PC account) - 3/5 regions I got showing progress "3/5 locations", while in every one of them I've discovered all listed locations. Problem is, you can't "re-discover" it :(
---
i don't see any problems. Workbench act like this since it's release, it's obviously not a mod problem
---
They didn‚Äôt.  OP is trolling.
---
As in, stop worrying about your build constantly and just play the game?
---
I mostly agree...
---
üò¨but my build *is my game*...

holy shit, you're living on the edge man. congrats. I'm going for a "regular" one but can't decide between heavy and shotguns.
---
does the lack of barbarian/evasive hurt?
---
I wondered that too, but then I started picking up everything in an area near a vendor.  It didn't take long to sell 200 caps worth and move on to the next.  Minus the cost to fast travel you can make 1400 caps a day.  So a few days of doing that you'll get the 3000 in no time.  
---
Game ran beautifully for me last night after patch. However for around 2 weeks before patch the game was unplayable for me. I'd get disconnect or blue screen crashes 3 or 4 times an hour. And that's something to be mad about
---
Safe to say we‚Äôre all having this same issue
---
Yeager Airport! 
---
Sorry, I live in WV and I‚Äôll never call these locations by their in game names.

Melee is OP. I was excited to be able to 1 shot just about anything, now I look for weaker weapons to ensure that legendaries drop loot. Somehow a boxing glove has become my favorite weapon in the game!

I just blue screened 4 times in 10 minutes üëç

---
*M O N E Y plssssss* 
---
^ this 100 percent. After reading the back and forth i think the ppl defending the system are completely missing the point. 
---
You dont have to choice either/or in this game. Its literally only wasting your time to switch out vards constantly. There's no "benefit" or "character design tree" that makes you choose between opening any lock or hacking anything. It just makes you constantly switch cards and its infuriating.
---
I honestly cant believe the other replies defending this setup. Its equally annoying putting on/off crafting cards. If you build has st least 3 perception and you have put in points to locking picking x3 then it should always be on as a passive. Same with intel and hacking. 
---
I can kinda see how the craftimg cards might get more tricky of you need gunsmith plus science x3 or some other combo 
---
But ffs lockpicking and hacking is a no brainer... same with home defense and carpenter (or whatevr makes base repairs/build cost less) all of those cards should be passives provided you have enough attribute points in said field. And it's not about making the game "easier" it's about making it less pointlessly tedious for no added enjoyability/gameplay element/story.
---
&gt;I need opinions on something
---
Paragraphs first please. Why make it hard on us to read your post to give an opinion on it?
---
The zero point cost is a great idea, hope they will modify the perk card from those categories soon!
---
This all sounds very familiar. I'm playing on PC and the naked / invisible things happens quite a lot when I fast travel to a mate. I can see his name floating around and things dying.
---
Never had the damage bug like that, so thankful for that :) But it's not the most bugfree experience so far. I like the game, but I do wish it had npc's and easier sharing of missions.
---
You are doing it! 
---
...Replace-ception ...
---
*DUUUUUUUNNN*
---
And who's the depraved fuck coming up with these "take a picture with nothing on/ only a hat on/naked in a group" challenges? 
---
Melee is all about timing, especially with slow weapons. 
---
The game caps your reduction so that's where the perk dodgy comes in, closing the gap and causing the damage to drain ap from you instead
---
Can't make that kind of commitment right now but I'd be happy to help out as a friendly wonderer from time to time.
---
Really dude? If you actually blame the devs then you‚Äôre just looking for reasons to be upset and blindly flinging shit to bring people down to your level. No reasonable person is going to try to compare people with bosses and jobs on the line to people that do something with little to no oversight as a hobby. And bullshit they don‚Äôt get paid. Making things up to try to bolster your points only weakens them. Plenty of them got paid in various ways. Shit I donated to the text chat guy just last month. 
---
We‚Äôre obviously just going to have to agree to disagree. I like the game, and I‚Äôll continue to support it and look forward to seeing what it becomes. I‚Äôm disappointed in some things, but that‚Äôs life. 
---
Strange in numbers for me removes all positive effects and only leaves the bad, except for heard mentality which boosts to +3 strength. Also my weapon damage on my super sledge randomly changes from 260 at lowest to 700 at highest, and anything in-between. 
---
Where can I find them reliably?
---
[Most impressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDLmlHD212s)
---
VATS and spamming a fast weapon seems to make up for my lack of skill
---
I just wanna bongo bongo bongo in the jungle mannnn
---
Yes. There should be perk cards, and SKILL POINTS for the various passive skills.
---
You can pick a perk card, or a skill point, but skill points don‚Äôt count against how many cards you have applied to your specials.
---
God damn, you could even make it so one point gets you lockpick one, but you have to spend two points to unlock lockpick two.
---
I don‚Äôt give a flying fuck, but those kind of skills should just be learned and you never have to fuck with it again, because it‚Äôs ridiculous that knowing how to pick a lock takes most of your available points, and if you want to actually use a decent build, you have to keep swapping shit out.
---
With unyielding set and rank 1 or 2 savvy your every shot is critical. Honestly low hp builds got damn nice damage stacking which goes well with crits not to mention unyielding provides high stats and with sneak perk you're almost invisible to enemies even without chameleon.
---
Fuck...I didn't think about that whole "if another player enters the building" reset. That shit pissed me off when I went through it.
---
Had a guy yoink my shit during a queen fight, I slap damaged him to death when he was a little low and was getting gang banged then took my crap back plus his then server hopes, scew the queen kill.
---
You think like a coder
---
I just want to tame a dog and cat so they can sit on my couch. Maybe some chickens to roam my garden and a squirrel for my tree.
---
Not in the slightest lol
---
Stop spreading this fake news. There hasn't been a single ban related to using mods. The bans were for people using external third-party tools and people who've been duping.  
---
Once again: Nobody has been banned for using mods.
---
Exactly. I don‚Äôt want to fix it up good as new, I want there to be janky, improvisational sections of repaired ‚Äútrack‚Äù in the gaps. 
---
And, perhaps not fast travel, but just &lt;i&gt;faster&lt;/i&gt; normal travel, with a train ride, of sorts. Players controlling the departure station get a third of the fare, the arrival station gets a third, with the last third disappearing (Bethesda‚Äôs version of ‚Äúthe angel‚Äôs share‚Äù, as it were). If you control both, you get both, so Whitespring &amp; Watoga would be coveted stations, enticing pvp. 
---
Plus, it would make train robberies possible!
---
I agree I never use my power armor. With the right perks and freedom of movement it gives you the edge over all the mele power armour builds 
---
They are not detecting mods and they are not banning people for using mods. They can't even detect your client-side mods.  
---
People got banned for using external third-party tools (Cheat Engine) and duping.
---
Damn lower levels, always expecting handouts. Let it be known we want them out of Applalachia. LET'S BUILD A WALL! MAKE APPALACHIA GREAT AGAIN
---
This is a good opportunity to be supportive! If the overall wants of the community go against what the OP needs then they're already at a bit of a situational disadvantage and need to be heard just as clearly as the chorus of the community. It's a game that can be played as though it's a scifi with a plasma gun and a vault suit, like it's a Cosmic Horror piece in suspenders and slacks shooting tommyguns at otherworldly horrors, or as a goofball running around in a clownsuit with a sledgehammer that looks like a croquet mallet - plenty of room for a diversity of playstyles, lol
---
I don't think the community specifically wanted to allow players the opportunity to disadvantage others by blocking aspect of the game while they pee, though?
---
PC - 9700k, 1080Ti, 16GB, Win10
---
\- LOTS of CTD's, most of them are when I'm in Watoga and I can almost guarantee a crash if I stay there too long. Seemingly random, the game just stops and bam, back at the desktop.
---
\- After loading up after a crash,  you can't move the mouse all the way to the right side of the screen. I have an ultrawide and it's like it's just a normal widescreen, but only on the right side, the left is unaffected. It also drops resolution. Quitting the game is the only way to fix it.
---
\- I only ever connect to North American servers, 250ms+ ping. I'm located in Australia, never connect to anything locally anymore, if there even are Australian servers. No VPNs or anything like that running which would trick the system.
---
What would you say performance was like before the most recent patch? How old is your ps4? 
---
Only ever played it on a friend‚Äôs PC and had a rough go of it
---
I don‚Äôt know, can you tell me?
---
You're spot on about progression being entirely RNG driven. I honestly dont think my character is much better since level 50 (now 115). Nuke zone after nuke zone. Quest after quest and nothing noticeably better has dropped or is now craftablr despite all my efforts. 
---
I dont need a rpg to have a completely linear progression, but feeling like there's nothing i can do except hope for some dumb luck is... bad design.
---
There are cool players at every level. Be one of those players.
---
Hey I found that too. Found a shrine around v76 area dedicated to what looks like aliens.
---
What??? With this latest patch it feels like the game is finally out of beta. Lots of bugs still, but no game crash or disconnect in 5 hour game session. Love it! ( PS4 pro)
---
For pve it's awesome too, I can literally stand in the middle of a room and take no damage from 8 LV 60+ super mutants shooting me, and I'm constantly below 20% hp. The real danger to me is radiation attacks like ghoul melee, the rads still build even with no damage taken.
---
I consistently do the same there, and a good number of high levels I know do as well.  I  also stay around 600 carry weight capacity thanks to my build, so after the event, any player under 75 gets all my built up legendaries and scrap and plans pr recipes.   Figure I would end up thrashing them anyways.
---
It's good etiquette to let people get a smack on the legendary.  The same etiquette isnt used at white springs and if someone walks into mobs I spawned 1 shotting crap I pull put my Two shot gat and just mow down all ghouls in about 5 seconds, if they are cool and try to do light damage on purpose I make sure they get hits in.

would be less of a pain if it worked like unlock expert hacker for example u dont need the hacker card no more or when u have the master hacker card u dont need either expert nore hacker card to unlock lvl 3 locks. but loadouts would be a better in the long term especially if they add new cards later on.

It's asks to kill the unruly gofer gouls or something. I've killed more than they've asked elsewhere. 
---
I completely avoided Whitesprings until I felt that I had a strong enough Power Armor (Level 35 Excavator) and a decent melee build. I highly suggest buffing out your melee build and getting a strong melee weapon that is 80 damage and up. I was using the Black Diamond Ski Sword and the Zealots War Drum.   I wish I knew earlier about the whole Whitesprings xp exploiting, as it would've helped me build XP much faster.

I'm on PC but thanks for the info!

---
&gt; This game is garbage right now. For me. For my buddy. Some of my other friends are not having the same problems. But some are. And we are migrating away from the game.
---
That really is it isn't it? Me and my friends constantly played and enjoyed this game, but the constant DC's and bugs have driven all of us away. 
---
We had so much fun, and maybe we will again if the game lets us play it in the future.
---
I logged on yesterday just to check out the new patch, I spawned in cranberry bog in one of the trenches and I got a bug where all non terrain objects disappeared around me. Think it's an issue with culling but I'm not sure. So yeah, guess I'll wait till next patch to drop in.
---
Or if you just got disconnected while trying to get your death bag full of goodies
---
It was on my PS4.  Everything was smoother as well.  Didn't even have to wait for my water purifiers to load up there inventory. 
---
I consider a game company fighting against cheaters and exploits that require no outside programs through legal methods rather than actually just fixing the game bad practice for consumers, yeah. It's the biggest waste of energy ever.
---
It's completely asinine to think that is the best route to go. If they can't fix the exploits they aren't smart enough to make a functioning online game and should have never tried.
---
It's working much better on my PS4.  could have just gotten a good server though.
---
If you are looking for one to do the "Kill one in a clown suit" mission you can leave it to later on as there will eventually be another Raider mission that takes you to kill the same Wendigo in that cave anway. Wear a clown costume and do two missions at once. Also that mission never goes away, it just keeps coming back.
---
I know there is a wendigo that spawns in the lower ground of the white springs golf club pretty regularly  but that place gets farmed so much you would be lucky to find one alive.
---
Other then that my experince with them have been pretty random. Found some in some trees before too, weird.
---
This may not apply but I super sledge people randomly all the time, but I do so with pacifist on so it doesnt do anything, it's just funny for some reason lol.
---
You didn't get the quest early - some quests come randomly depending on vicinity/actions/previous quests etc. and as other people said, enemy levels depend on who got to the area before you.
---
Is it the kill unruly golfers ghouls you need to kill? If so, that quest is a huge pain in the a\*\* - would recommend ignoring it for now and coming back when higher level. When you do come back to it make sure you hunt the ghouls wearing golf attire as the others don't count towards it. Imo reward wasn't worth the time anyway.
---
The Pollock painting skin is just reused assets from Nuka World. One of the raider gangs used it along with other similar items. It worked pretty alright with their theme and the environmental design of their areas. 
---
In FO76, maybe not so much
---
Yeah people need to settle down on crying duper or hacker at the first sight of an explosive gun, most people just demonize them and those who use them, so far as calling us unskilled or unstylish. I think the radiation has gotten to them. They are BiS and if you can, you should use them. Everyone did in fallout 4, I mean cmon, spray n pray anybody?
---
But what's the point in inconveniencinv players?
---
It's already established that the current systrm doesn't make you change your build. There's no tradeoff involved. It just annoys you when you want to hack/pick going in and finding 3 separate cards switching them on then off again immediately. The only thing it does it make gameplay less enjoyable.
---
There's no strategic value or story enhancement/rationale. It's only function appears to be making a buggy, laggy game that much more tedious. Why not have them passive as long as you have at least 3 int and 3 perc and have purchased the cards? How would that detract from the game in any way?
---
Nvm that there's virtually never anything of note worth the time to switch cards for in safes/terminals, but that's a whole other issue.
---
There aren't any gluten-free juicing vegan locavores in sight. 
---
3 seconds and an explosive gauss
---
Possibly. But NoClip interviews were 8 months ago, and they had locked the base game. Obviously there doing a lot of bug and quality of life changes to do after that, but two of the vaults were finished-ish when they were clipped in and leaked online. We know there's a new PvP mode. If come the beginning of Q2 we got a tease in the lead up to E3, where 76 will surely make an appearance, I'd be happy to see whatever they have. 
---
what about pvp? what exactly kills you? people keep bringing up ap which I'm assuming is for dodgy but the armor gives you 100% reduction anyhow.
---
isn't staggering more dangerous?
---
&gt;they are not detecting mods, or banning people for them
---
&gt;they are detecting cheat engine, which is a mod, and banning people for it
---
Are you okay? 
---
Mostly just to make it easier for those ass cheeks safes. But there are two trophies for it 
---
Happy cake day!
---
Yep, having 'decks' of cards, prebuilt for certain situations that you can swap out of or even better hotkey would be great.  To go from a ranged to melee build real quick, or to swap to crafting-mode when you're back at your camp.
---
HAH!  I didn't even think of that man, good catch!

Cheat Engine is not a mod, Cheat Engine is a tool for hacking.  
---
It helps if you know what you talk about when you talk about it.
---
Currently 5 in bout 20 mins in nuke zone for me. Friend launched on queen earlier and 10 seconds after he launched, got blue screened. 
---
It was actually fairly good connection wise for me the last week, now absolutely horrible. Worst it has ever been for me anyway.
---
Yeah, I already had that issue too but from what another fellow vault dweller has shared baseballs fix that issue since they don't autoscrap!  I had totally forgotten about that too.
---
It does lol, it's a good answer to people not sharing hits, light it up and the explosions tag everything.
---
An easier way to fix dupers would be to change the over encumbered modifiers. If x2 over limit then take small amount of damage as you walk, x3 moderate damage, x4 heavy damage. Force them to carry less like everyone else
---
&gt; The problem is how do you categorise it? Let's say you crash at a nuke zone, what reason did this occur? What was the specific error? 
---
"known issue , people crashing at nuke zones " done 
---
lame! I did not think that this was how the pvp system worked... I guess that I learned my lesson.
---
Well, lets set aside the insults and focus on the topic.
---
You're saying the game is in horrific condition, which isn't really something "clear and concise", but we'll try to work with that.
---
At release, the game was indeed barely playable. Aside from the crashes, which were something, the infinite pop of monsters scaled to the higher level player in the area, with an almost infinite range even for close combat and their relentlessly tracking were my biggest issue; but amongst MANY others we had power armor bugs, infinite xp/loot, the micro-stash pushing everyone to madness, the ghost weight glitch, the infinite weight exploit, etc etc.
---
Two month later, the game is still buggy, no need to say, but most of those bugs I just mentionned have been fixed. Not two weeks ago, a patch was released fixing ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY bugs. Obviously, if you need to release such a patch two month in your game, something went wrong, I'm not gonna argue that. And the fact there are STILL bugs after such a huge patch is food for the mind.
---
However, once again, your statement was "the game is only under maintenance". To which I pointed "well, nope, that is not true". Cue your rant and insults. 
---
This game is very young. As stated before, I don't love Bethesda. I hate Fallout 3 from deep within, and I've rarely been so disappointed by a video game than by the dialogue wheel in Fallout 4, let aside the immortals NPC or stupid main quest. 
---
However, and I'd like you to try to understand before you go in another of your anti-bethesda-hyped tantrums, there are very good points in Fallout 4 that immediately made me say "This is just a preparation for multi player".
---
The settlements, the moving merchants, the skill set replacing the more classical points to set were clear hints of 76. 
---
Now, obviously, and it has been stated countless times before, the game has been released in beta-state, way too soon and clearly unfinished. Obviously, many things are left to improve : player trade, camp usefulness, endgame content, game balance, .... long subject.
---
It doesn't remove that blankly saying "this game is shit" disregards the work currently done and incoming. 
---
Bethesda is clearly not innocent, but if the "beta-testers" (I have a hard time writing this without laughing) had actually beta-test the game instead of rushing for levelling, we might have had a better game. 
---
If the youtubers hadn't spent so much time listing the exploits and issues of the game, all hyping on the same hate-train, we might have had a few more players, which would have been an incentive for Bethesda to act faster.
---
The game works as well as Fallout 4 : you can run around, explore, fight ennemies, gather stuff, build your camp, with here and there the occasional bug that may or may not crash your game. That's not "barely functionning". 
---
It's not required to suck Todd Howard's dick to enjoy the atmosphere, the scenery, the vast landscape or, simply, to find it nice to be able to play fallout with friends for once.
---
So sure thing, Bethesda sucks. That's nothing new under the sun. Sure thing, Fallout 76 is far from game of the year, heck it's even far from "Survivalist game online in a post-apocalyptic universe set in a dystopian atompunk genre of the year". 
---
But you aren't bringing anything to the conversation by making false statements and calling everyone who disagree a "fanboy"; worse, that kind of behaviour actually devalue your position by making it less reasonable.
---
This is actually a really good idea.  Contributing to charity is probably one of the few ways they might get me to buy and use atoms at their current super inflated prices.  Good share mate!
---
you can rotate walls if the wall straddles two adjoining floor pieces. if the wall doesn't already have a floor in front of it, you can put down a floor piece, rotate the wall, then pick up the floor piece. Also make sure you attach the roof before inverting the walls otherwise the roof pieces will snap outwards.
---
raider/sniper hunting does sounds like fun to me
---
This is a great idea, I had completely forgotten that baseballs don't autoscrap because they are used for grenades!  Thanks for the tip brother!
---
To add to this what we need is the ability if we have our cards ranked up is to instead dictate how many points on an individual card we want to place if we have them ranked up enough.
---
Eg for strength , if I have 3 points on a melee card and 3 on a carry weight card but only 5 slots to use then I should be able to say I want my fully maxed 3 point melee card and use only 2 points of the carry weight card, (even though I have 3 points in it). Otherwise 1 of those cards I‚Äôve spent points ranking up becomes completely useless and I‚Äôm forced instead to invest 2 points in cards I potentially don‚Äôt want. 
---
I think this is only fair because we are limited in the skill points. 
---
I might have that couches plan if your on ps4 
---
I'm korean but I was born into a family of vegetarians. So I have never eaten meat (dog meat ? seriously ?!) in my whole life. Even in fallout 76 üòÇ I always have my green thumb perk enabled ! 
---
I don't know if they changed anything after the update, but last night I did my Watoga municipal building run and all of the safes had a lot better loot than usual.  Could have just been a lucky run though.
---
why did i read that as passive aggressive 
---
Cheat engine is a mod.... You know that.. Right? Look at the mods available on the nexus. "bag highlight mod" is cheating. "easy picklock mod" is cheating. "cap stashes highlighted mod" is cheating. I don't know what you think "mods" are but you clearly haven't even looked at what people are using and being banned for. If you think you are safe by only using mod that only does an innocent ui change, I applaud your bravery. I'll wait for it to become more official. 
---
The blueish walls are the 'Metal Walls'. The sheet metal walls are the 'Warehouse Walls'.
---
Wow! V rad!
---
See, the reason they aren‚Äôt just passive , is due to the fact that originally perk card packs were going to be available as micro transactions, but when bathesda saw what happened to battlefront 2 they did not make it so , he sent why some perk cards don‚Äôt make sense, and won‚Äôt be revamped for a very long time.
---
In my opinion 
---
Hi. Had this issue
---
I put the Display settings to 'Borderless Window' and then, on my Windows desktop, changed the output for sound from being the computer to being the television I had plugged into the computer via HDMI cord.
---
FO76 audio only works for me while NOT in fullscreen and with TV being the primary output instead of the computer.
---
Hope fiddling with these two items helps. DISPLAY settings in game are easy, but you may need google to figure out how to switch primary output for your setup. If you are playing with no TV output , I don't have any other advice :(
---
I'd imagine that'd be a tight squeeze. 
---
I admit I knew nothing about how the mouth harp works.
---
However, I watched a YouTube video on it and the guy breathes while twanging it - seems the breathing is an integral part of playing the instrument.
---
https://youtu.be/Mrxxed54hcg
---
Yeah staggering will do it but most of the weapons I've been shot by don't hit quick enough, except automatics to stagger and follow up in time to damage before sentinel is on again, the dodgy gives the 30 percent and the assassin gives 40 at all times then sentinel is 75% but the game caps you so you can't go over the like 90 something percent mark, so once dodgy is done, you're done. But this all relies on a weapon staggering and damaging you while explosive guns are essentially useless as well with dense 66% explosion resist and fireproof 30% at rank 2. Basically guns have to either fire fast enough and do enough damage to drain my ap.
---
 Because of that I intentionally placed my own camp on the train bridge to harpers ferry where people who fast travel load in.  Its steps away from load in and I get visitors all the time.  Did this for when player owned vendors come out which they said they are looking at doing. 
---
...
---
No. It's not a QOL update. In 44 there was ZERO trade-offs. You picked the order of how you gain perks but you were never made to permanently choose one or the other.  You want more points to equip more things? You level more! Simple! So there was never a need for respecing. If you wanted to go a different direction with your character, you just leveled it and picked up new skills!
---
This whole.. 50pts and that's it, is a HUGE QoL downgrade! How many people are rolling around in the 100s+  and are still limited to 50?!
---
Add in the fact that they've stripped out all the bobbleheads, magazine and companion perks and you have a REALLY restrictive perk system that is a giant pain in the ass with no upside. :P
---
Cheat engine is a modding tool, it's laughable that you think there is a difference between "mods" and "cheats". 
---
People go in there to kill it, probably not respawned
---
Little things like this make appreciate the fallout series. 
---
The fact that from a lore perspective, a few nukes later and a bunch of nuts all over go around making these elaborate scenarios with toys, mannequins and gnomes. 
---
It's as if this is almost a form of visual media for those poor irradiated bastards.
---
Sorry to bring an old post back, but did we ever figure out if you can keep it?
---
I agree with making it a passive. But OPs comment at least makes it a legitimate decision you might need to make with your build.... do you want lockpicking or rifleman? Right now its an artificial choice bc u swap them in and out on the spot as needed, which makes it inexplicable it's not a passive as long as you have the cards and 3 int/per. But if you could only do that at camp then youd actually have to choose one or the other. 
---
I personally prefer making it a passive, but i get what OP was going for... i think? Altho i assume everyone would just stop picking locks if it was a choice bc there is never any loot worth 3x slots in a level 3 safe anyways. Maybe if they upped the quality of loot it would become an actual decision what cards to run.
---
Radiation weapons I believe are gonna be the hard counter to this, however that banks on you landing enough shots, which is probably not alot to be honest on a low health build, before they shoot you back with most likely a two shot explosive of some sort.
---
If you want it fixed you have to nag Sony to fix it. That error code with the blue screen has been an error for the last 4 years and they haven‚Äôt done anything to resolve it. 
---
Underrated post
---
My game loads and then I have to white while if first person for a few minutes, if I don‚Äôt , it‚Äôll freeze up, brought up my pop boy and boom forensic for 5 minutes , also when fast traveling , it‚Äôll load show the environment and then bounce back to loading screen for about a minute 
---
It's double bad in my opinion since several of the cards (outside of stuff like the damage cards which I already hate) have what could be an active and passive side.
---
Gunsmith for instance, the passive half could be the crafting ability, while having it equipped could give the condition reduction.  Pick Lock passive allows the picking, active makes it easier.  Just as a few examples.
---
It is true. There is a new method. I don't know how it works but roles back the whole server including people who are just trying to play. So people who use this new method are scum imo
---
Agreed.  While some of what happens with perks in F76 can be tedious, and I believe there could be improvements to their design, the game does seem to ask players to make choices.  And while not all choices are equally balanced or costed, there is also a lot of forgiveness for making the wrong choice.  Or being able to change your play style without having to go through an intensive or expensive process.  (I'm thinking of WoW before they allowed a player to have two different specializations, or the dramatically increasing cost for a respec.)  
---
There's room for improvement to the current system, such as adjusting costs associated with cards (e.g., Hacker could cost one, but have Expert/Master cost zero if Hacker is equipped) or perhaps reducing the number of ranks associated with certain perks.  But it'll take a bit more data and observation before I suspect Bethesda will want to change the system they had at launch.  Though at least it seems like they are listening to player feedback and considering ways to make the experience better.
---
It's probably in flux, their marketing team is for sure on it, timing and all.
---
Get speed demon mutation. Seriously I reload my 5 bullets in under a second. 
---
Stop crying, if you don‚Äôt like pvp then don‚Äôt engage in it. Simple 
---
&gt; In a game that has basically become an inventory management simulator it‚Äôs hard to justify being upset about a few seconds of changing perks to access anything I want.
---
While this is painfully true, one huge issue doesn't negate this other huge issue. &gt;.&gt; They're both issues!
---
Cheat Engine is a tool to hack the memory of a running application, it's completely different than a mod. The Fallout 76 process has built-in checks for several executables, of which Cheat Engine is one. The game has no detection methods for mods and even allows you to load your own external B2A files.  
---
This is why people have been banned for using/running Cheat Engine, while nobody has been banned for using mods.  
---
Enjoy being a parrot that spreads fake news that all originated from a single person making a troll post about being banned for using the widescreen mod, even though the same person later admitted he did it just to show that people like you are gullible morons.
---
There's a good spot in the woods next to Cow Spot Creamery which gives a beautiful view out over the cliff edge. Nice little clearing near the cliff edge, it's pretty safe area and the ground is fairly flat if you place it just right. No water unfortunately, but there is an ore patch for mining. 
---
But what if they fix one of the issues, or a component of the main issues in such as way that the issue is relieved to a degree? That's all I meant
---
I just want them to let multiple people access a dam vendor.
---
I've afked at a vendor a couple times for a minute or two because a door knock ect. Happened.  But not intentionally,  it still shouldnt even be a problem that exists tho.
---
I'm not a White Springs farmer, but I still cleared the golf course lots of time, I'm level 120 and I'm still at 9/10 Ghouls killed. Don't try to complete the mission, you'll get it eventually.
---
I‚Äôd settle for one set when ‚Äúholstered‚Äù (weapon not drawn and not in combat and another for when your weapon is out. This would provide a seamless transition from combat to crafting.
---
Alternatively having some passive effects (like being able to craft lvl 5 mods for guns that require that level of Gunsmith) but without the bonus effects (weapons breaking 50% slower). 
---
Your CAMP seems so huge, full of parts.
---
Which lvl is your Charakter?
---
Cheat Engine is a hacking tool. It literally hacks the memory of a running application.  
---
Mods don't do these things.  
---
Maybe you understand it better in your own language: Squawk, squawk, screech.
---
&gt; but the game caps you so you can't go over the like 90 something percent mark
---
OH, so that's why. I knew I was missing something. thanks for clarifying.
---
And now after reading this post, it's gonna make me sad the rest of my shift lol. I'm really sorry that your dad passed away man. I'm also sorry if this comes off as a joke, because it's not. Hearts and prayers my friend.
---
Considering the bonuses that people want are all the non-combat things, all it takes is 30 seconds (when you're not in danger anyway) to use those perks for what you want, then you swap back off of them and go on an adventure.  It's just a waste of time at that point, since the only penalty is your (not the character's) time.
---
I really like the perk system in general, and I love the idea of what it *could* be, but swapping out cards every time I'm doing something different is ridiculously annoying. Claimed a workshop? Ok, ditch Action Girl and equip Home Defense for decent turrets. Going shopping? Oops, swap out Lone Wanderer for Hard Bargain or those leftover fluxes won't fetch shit...
---
I really want to be able to save custom configurations for CAMP, trading, crafting, etc. and swap them out quickly and easily that way. The system would be awesome then. I get bored easily, so I love the fluidity my character has. I've recently fallen in love with my plasma gatling, so now I'm picking up some heavy gun perks (and Bear Arms is a lifesaver. And just funny. I love terrible puns).
---
I do usually keep two ranks of picklock equipped for convenience, because I actually enjoy picking locks. Never hacker tho; in 85 levels I think I've hacked maybe 8 or 10 terminals that actually needed it.
---
PvP = Stimpack war.
---
Just get married, my wife keeps lvl 3 lockpick and hacker on so when i find something i call upon her, but all jokes aside I'll be sad when she figures out there's better cards and switches them out.
---
I don't buy your story after I read "I have a TSE lever action rifle" :-)
---
It's limited to items with over 39 in a stack so that may explain why you've only seen it there.
---
&gt;  limit the area it fan be done
---
That's a good idea.  Have 'all' cards active inside your camp or something, so at least you don't have to swap out for your crafting perks.
---
It is the marsupial mutation. 
---
No, ceaselessly crying about it is what‚Äôs small pink floppy energy
---
Now I‚Äôm going to start putting my base there again
---
Good point. 
---
Side note: I hate that gunsmith 5 is basically required along w luck of the draw unless you want your gun to break in 0.5 seconds. 
---
I want to love this game, but godamn they fucked up soo many things balance wise, end game wise, progression wise, not to say anything about bugs/glitches/server stability (all exaccerbated by duping, which went on forever and I'm still not convinced hasn't permantly broken the game... they should hot ban any account with &gt;100x of any single bobblehead type)
---
It's called marsupial. It also adds carry weight so as you might imagine it is what people farm for
---
When I first noticed this I did a little brief testing and figured out that it's limited to anything over 39 items in a stack or 39 caps. If you have 39 or less then it works as expected but the instant that stack / caps go over 40 you're stuck with infinite scrolling left.
---
Keep the day job.
---
Aye, make each level a multiple of 3 like the Charisma sharing.  Perfectly acceptable to me even though it'll lock me out of quite a bit between INT and PER.
---
Thank you!
---
I barely hit 80.
---
lol, guess you never played Killing floor 2 or Team fortress 2 eh?
---
I fail to understand the problem here. How has any of this anything to do with dupers?
---
I play since day1. I spend hours and hours and lots of caps ‚Äúchasing‚Äù players to see if they wanted to trade. Players lost interest in trading 2 weeks after release. Dupes didn‚Äôt exist or weren‚Äôt known yet. 
---
Lack of trade is a player thing. Don‚Äôt blame dupers. 
---
I don‚Äôt even ‚Äúfarm hard‚Äù and yesterday after going on my vendor route I had to throw away 50 stimpacks because of weight. I don‚Äôt need more than 15 anyways. How has this anything to do with dupers and economy?
---
Lets see how it goes when we get vendor machines. THEN there might be some importance to economy... and tactical CAMP positioning. 
---
(PSA) if you're at your camp for awhile, and some random players see you on the map and come looking for you, they are probably going to attack your camp to bait you into pvp.
---
Healing Factor reduces healing and chems effectiveness, not Speed Deamon. SD increases your water/food needs.
---
One of the reasons I was not going to jump on 76 was all the arsehats online brings. But I have grown to love the role players, community minded individuals and yes, the arsehats. It's a jungle out there, and I appreciate all the wildlife and players that make it an interesting experience.
---
I am ninja, so yeah, power armors sux. 
---
Grinding is the wrong decision.
---
Yeah, that stings tbh.
---
Hello all
---
the whole world is to learn of what Bethesda is doing at the moment
---
Everything started with a ticket. I have opened a new tick for my friend about my Acciunt. This ticket was about telling Bethesda Support that my friend (brother) was banned (during his lifetime). They ignore any response from those involved. Bethesda Support Bans not only the Fallout Account, but the entire Bethesda Account. a registration on Bethesda.net is no longer possible. Of course you can not open a ticket or check the status of existing ones.
---
When I wrote the Sipport ticket through my account to let you know that you should read the message from my friend who had to respond directly to the email.
---
After 12h you have also banned my account because of alleged Exploidausnutzung exploited (too large amounts of items on the account) for lifetimes.
---
The resulting consequences are no longer sustainable for this company. As the Bethesda.net account also syncs with the games Skyrim and Fallout 4, my Creations Club points (bought with real money) are also no longer usable - the entire Creations Club of Skyrim and Fallout 4 is therefore also blocked. My account is 12 years old and I have never acted lawfully or unlawfully. Likewise, I can affirm but also guarantee that I do not exploit exploits nor have any extraordinary amount of items on my account. They just banned me like that.
---
I am also ignored by Bethesda Support.

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren

Durch die von Ihnen get√§tigte rechtswidrige permanente Sperre des Bethesda Accounts, ist nun Zeitgleich der Zugang zum Ingameshop der Spiele ¬´Fallout 4¬ª und ¬´Skyrim Remastered¬ª gesperrt worden. Die 3 Spiele verwenden den gleichen Account und dieselben Einloggdaten wie es bei Fallout 76 der Fall ist. 
---
Die √ºber den Microsoft gekauften Creations Club Punkte sind ebenfalls gesperrt inkl. Der schon gekauften Spielinhalte √ºber diesen Ingameshop. Somit ist ein Spiel das nichts mit Fallout 76 zu tun hat, erneut unbrauchbar f√ºr mich geworden. 
---
Ich bitte Sie, mir diese Angelegenheit genauestens zu schildern und mir einen klaren und verst√§ndlichen aber auch nachvollziehbaren Grund vorzuweisen. 
---
Die Vollumf√§nglichen Kaufbetr√§ge des Spiels ¬´Fallout 76¬ª sowie die K√§ufe des Creations Clubs ebenfalls √ºber Microsoft Store f√ºr das Spiel ¬´Fallout 4¬ª werden von Microsoft zur√ºckgefordert.

Mein Account wurde von Ihnen soeben gebannt (lebenslange).
---
Der Grund sei es, ich h√§tte einen Exploit f√ºr Duplizier Vorg√§nge ausgenutzt. Ich spiele schon seit der BETA und habe das Spiel Vorbestellt (gr√∂sste Edition dieses Spiels f√ºr 120.00 CHF). 
---
Sie verurteilen mich, ich habe √ºberdurchschnittliche Mengen an Items auf meinem Account gelagert (GT: Airhaengers). H√§tten Sie meinen Account durchsucht, h√§tte Ihnen auffallen sollen, dass ich die Menge an Items absolut als normal erweisen. 
---
Ihr Banngrund: 
---
If you believe that this account has been flagged in error, please let us know by providing a short description what you were doing that may have resulted in the excessively high rate of item creation. Upon review, we may consider a lift of this suspension, if determined to be in error.
---
Bitte weisen Sie mir Screenshots oder Protokolleintr√§ge vor, die diese Anschuldigung wiederlegt und spiegelt.

Die Vermutung meinerseits ist es, dass mein zuletzt ge√∂ffnetes Ticket mit dem bann verkn√ºpft worden ist. Da ich lediglich einem Freund helfen wollte, werde ich mit einem Bann bestraft. Dieser Freund war ausserdem mein Bruder, der nicht mal im gleichen Haushalt lebt wie ich lebt. Mein Account ist 12 Jahre alt und ich habe mir nie etwas zu Schulden kommen lassen.

---
My friend mentioned that he received the heavy combat armor chest plans when we completed a horde event near the Atlas Observatory. He is level 112, and we were killing commie bots. 
---
Upvoting because this is one of the last fixes that is in the way of this game being what it should be. It is an incredibly clunky experience and I can‚Äôt imagine the devs intended people to be switching cards as much as they are for the reasons that they are. It makes a lot of sense to remove certain cards and give them a SPECIAL stat level requirement. 
---
I swear on the sweet holy mother Mary herald that I was gifted this fine weapon straight from a legendary ghoul's hands, I've never, nor will I ever, consider trading it to anybody, it's never left my hands and will never be duped. That's my burning hatred toward dupers because I earned mine, farming and farming for days after days, and they get it for free from their buddy and make five hundred more for their friends. It makes me sick.
---
what if you are the love of my life
---
They killed you for the flux you'd collected. It's a legitimate target in blast zones which is why I don't carry or pick up junk in them. I'm just glad they're finally ending the duplication glitches that allowed people to stack a hundred bobble heads to deal one shot amounts even through slap damage
---
Beautiful work on the external structure of the house. Many people can't see past a simple box, but yours is very interesting to look at. Well done.
---
I hear ya... I was a Xbox gamer for a long time. Back in the Skyrim days I got so tired of not having mods I finally built myself a gaming pc and haven‚Äôt looked back. 
---
Pull a hammy? Are Super Mutants just clones of Kevin Nash?
---
Very small circle of people will get this joke.
---
And how many languages do you speak?
---
Because of the huge level difference of people who don't have a lot of time. I can't walk through the golf course when there's 150+ people around. The base with it's turrents takes care of the mob that spawns and gets me XP and loot without having to spend all my ammo and stimpaks in trying to take down a level 50 monster spawn while i'm at 26. 
---
I could server hop untill my balls fall of to find a server which doesn't have these high level players, but that's so unlikely to happen that it's not fun anymore. I'd rather spend half an hour laughing at the massacre of the mobs and then going adventuring again with a level or two under my belt and perhaps a nice new shiny gun. 
---
I wasn't asking an open ended question intended to illicit epistemological nihilism, I meant seriously. If several bugs cause the same problem, it would be difficult for the community to know which bug they meant when saying "we've fixed bug in x place". 
---
You are right. In previous games it felt more worth while. But this game seems to treat ingame loot different 
---
Sorry üò•
---
Ok thx for it ... Would like to have that mutation 
---
Love it! 
---
I get attacked every time I fast travel to my camp, but the damage is always slight. I've started to rely on molerat and wolf attacks for meat. It's like a home delivery service.
---
seriously ? i tried killing my mate with a expplosive two shot handmade with all rifle man perks bloody mess and full demo expert , i gave up after 2 minutes
---
radium deals pitiful rad damage. a rad-x should suffice to counter it, no?
---
a week or two ago, there were 3 people (all max lvl 13) running around in wasteland and a the shooting sounds from far away, they were in big trouble. me in my PA runs as fast as i can and "joined" their party. they had big problems because of an deathclaw.
---
first thought: why the fuck do you guys get in such big trouble. everyone know: if you see an deathclaw, and you are under level 15+ you have to make sure that the deathvlaw did not see/saw you.
---
otherwise its really though ride with that beast.
---
so i did what probably eceryone of us would do: i helped them and killed that deathclaw.
---
after that you have seen that all the three guys where so happy and proud that they have killed THE DEATHCLAW and they shared stimpaks to me, because i've got bit damaged.
---
so after that fight... i was so happy to see that these guys are "jumping and dancing" around that deathclaw corpse.
---
i've decided to share all my receipts, support-holos and many thing from my inventory  to make their day even much greater.
---
so as you guys said: for me its just a bit of KK but for them it could have mean a lot. hope i have not ruined their game-experience (because they get it for free and them had not to fight or search for it).
---
it feelt so great to see these 3 guys running as a squad and hope they will stay connected as the day i saw them on the server.
---
THIS IS WHAT FALLOUT 76 TEACHED ME: in the apocalypse we will stay together... strong and united. i got some items from guys for free i will give them for free.
---
not like the duper guys for KK or selling them on ebay.
---
WE AS ONE UNIT! :)
---
Hmmm, but this is only game where this bluecreen crash occurs, at least for me. 
---
Other games like Destiny, Destiny 2, Warframe, God of War, Assasins Creed Odyssey and so on do not have this issue and run stable on my machine.
---
Doubt it is Sonys problem - can you explain\`?
---
I mean I understand your frustration but it's not the person with the Fatman's fault. You can't blame him for using a weapon that's intended to be used. 
---
It‚Äôs just Bethesda being shit dude, I know guys with 1m+ in their inventory worth of items and they‚Äôre still alright 
---
I got an Instigating Rolling Pin once. And I was grateful for it.
---
Kids today...

Semi auto is Rifleman, auto is Commando
---
Presumptuous Butthole, sound like good name for a rock band.....
---
Respectable response.  
---
I just wish there was more video evidence to accompany the claims continually made on this sub.  After playing D1 for two years straight, I‚Äôm used to the stories going along with an awesome video.  It seems like 90% of posts, especially the ‚Äúto the [noun] who [verb]...‚Äù posts, are simply false.  
---
Happend after taming a mega sloth, right?  Or after it died? I'm  not sure at what point exactly my budget bugged out like yours.
---
/u/jessBethesda, would you kindly look into this guys thread, too?
---
wheres pylon v-13

Get a deep stack of diluted radaway, stash your junk, then set up your camp somewhere near a strong source of radiation so you can respawn there. Then just absorb rads til you get a mutation. Take radaway if you don't like it, then hop servers and try again. Once you have it, never take radaway again until you have starched genes 2 available. Heal your rads through suicide instead
---
I don't really understand how this works.  You can stack bobbleheads?  I play normally, and don't really use magazines or bobbleheads that much.  If I find one, I'll usually save it short term to eat during a nuke if it's helpful for my build or dump it at a train station blue suitcase to rid myself of the weight.
---
Much appreciated! 
---
And yes the box CAMP structure mentality is one that's very easy to get trapped in. I was in it for months despite how creative I tried to get. Probably because it's so easy to cater to the organizational needs while you're in the interior.
---
People on this subreddit really inspired me to try building in more seemingly awkward/unconventional ways. And it ended up working pretty well! 
---
i was just hoping you were the one
---
PS4 Pro
---
Did not have time to play much after the patch yesterday. 
---
Went into whitesprings and got the usual bluescreen after about 10 minutes in WS.
---
Reloaded and spawned in a nuked WS. Ran around for about 15 minutes and it was stable and i think not as laggy as before the patch.
---
I am looking forward to todays evening session. After the last patch in December the game was stable on patch day - it went downhill the days after...
---
1. Platform: PC
---
2. [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Acc: iladrion
---
3. no value for a screen
---
4. If i go to Camden Park and want to do a daily quest there, i get one of the three assigned (would be more nice to get all three). But if i disconnect or change the world, before i finish this one daily quest, it totally disappears. It seems to me a disconnect or world change is counted as a "failed" daily. More World changes does not bringt the daily back. It is gone for that day without a reason
---
5. no ticket.
---
I'm just confused as to how the 3rd player way able to attack my super mutant character... Does my attacking the wanted player allow anyone in their group (or just anyone) to attack me? I thought that pvp was individual, but I was clearly wrong.
---
Mostly pve here.
---
Blue screens. Ps4 blue screens. All day long. This would be great. Lost numerous queens because of blue screens. Thats not server side
---
Riiiight because modding isn't "hacking" the game until you arbitrarily decide it is. There are literally dozens of mods that make bannable changes to the game like the easy picklock and retexture mods. I don't know why you think cheat engine is the only thing they ban for but you are badly mistaken
---
you can still buy duped stuff after duping has been patched though
---
Can't blame the guy.
---
I think if you are in a team you get involved if a teammate gets attacked
---
If it does that use left trigger(Aim, on xbox) to scroll left in chunks. 
---
This is one of the best designed and functional houses I have seen.  I can only imagine what kind of house of horrors you could rig up if they had manually triggered traps to pop from your hidey holes too.
---
I had this as well. Apparently the only fix is to remove pieces in the order you placed them
---
Two things... Not huge: when scrolling through trying to drop, trade, sell a certain quantity of an item such as ammo, the slider doesn't stop at zero and will continue through the end all the way to theax amount you're carrying.
---
Pretty huge: multiple infinite load screens on PS4 yesterday. I (knock on wood) have experienced a lot fewer CTD than I was before, but now I'm getting infinite load screens about five to ten percent of the time when I fast travel.
---
ok well grinding, exploring, events, workshops, dailies?
---
not a floating base, just a monopod base, that said you can build a floating that a player would need marsupial or a jetpack to get into.
---
I learned this while preparing to push a button in Belching Betty
---
you did the monster math
---
2 total
---
Best bet is to keep leveling and just swap a special
---
Switch servers and try again, you can only get 1 mutation per server every 30 minutes iirc
---
That makes good sense, I suppose my worry was that people would abuse the ability to mod the game in order to cheat or be nefarious.
---
why grinding, just play normally
---
I think the Enclave directly rivals the free states in every possible way though...
---
And the mirelurk kings, neither hurt nor tickle. These fuckers murder. 
---
Once you reach lv 50. every 1 level you'll be able to reset 1 point or unlock new perk pack.
---
Gonna need one of those to be replaced with bloodied 
---
While mods can obviously be used for cheating purposes, they are fundamentally different from external tools like Cheat Engine. Maybe your limited vocabulary is hampering your ability to differentiate between the two.  
---
Like I said before, the game actively checks for external tools like Cheat Engine, because they're used for hacking. The game is not actively checking for mods, because they're not hacking.  
---
This is not an arbitrary distinction made by me, this is a distinction made by the developers of Fallout 76.
---
TSE has been nerfed with the latest patch but you need the correct build.   Lvl3 Fireproof and a dense chest mod negates all explosive damage.   The ballistic damage from those who actually aim is still effective,  but without the explosive damage it reduces the OP on these guns. 
---
Every additional level up you can choose to either take a perk card or swap a perk point
---
Wonder why ;)
---
Doubtful they need therapy  because they want to kill you in a video game. Are you going to blame them or the broken pvp system that rewards you for pvping?
---
normally is relative
---
the reasons for it was in a previous post it was suggested in leaving the main questline to after level 50 due to how the rewards work
---
What's wrong with discussions ?
---
I will do 2000 for the two shot handmade plz
---
The cards are fine, swapping them in the field is the problem.
---
Either need cooldown, or camp-only.
---
After you get a mutation there's a wait time before you can gain another one.  I think it's around 30-40 minutes.
---
If you server hop you can avoid having to wait the 30-40 minutes, though.
---
Nothing at all.
---
I get it everytime i join a world i call it the  buffering zone. I have to wait 2-10 minutes for it to come around and able to play. (Ps4 pro ) also i get a ton of blue screens running the pro. Even on other games i blue screen with the same error code. No idea no fix in 4 month. 
---
normally is normally, grinding is grinding, why seems to be unclear ?
---
I run a solo rad build. 
---
Lone wanderer. 30%.
---
Emergency protocols. 50% / Serendipity 45%.
---
Dodgy. 30%. 
---
Blocker. 45%. 
---
You can see where I‚Äôm going with this ;)
---
Switch servers.
---
It's a daily quest called Ecological Balance. Go to Moo Cow's Creamery and loot the password off Amy's body then to Tygart Water Treatment. There is a little trailer outside the plant, unrelated to the water treatment plant, on the north side with a terminal. It has Amy's story, quite sad, read the entries and listen to the holotape laying on the floor to the left of the terminal. Reading the right terminal entry will give you the quest then every few days it will pop up again as a daily.
---
I knew I should have recorded it but you only get about 30 seconds of footage anyway. And I didn't wanna spout paragraph after paragraph about the fight that ensued after I took my shot or go into massive detail about sitting there watching them. Just the side I found funny about it.
---
And I get it, I've seen a lot of farfetched stories on here with no evidence. My instinct is to distrust it, naturally. But I have no need to make this stuff up I was just quite amused by this and wanted to share. But I hear ya, shouldn't trust everything you read :)
---
Just stop and think for a moment. A soul from a vault has been essentially forced to leave their home, the safe place they've known for years and possibly their whole lives if young. They come out to an irradiated wasteland of death and horrors you could only dream of in your worst nightmares. They develop a coping mechanism of viewing everything as just a childhood game. Hide and seek. Tag. Hunting buried treasure. They remember fondly their time with crayons and colouring as it's one of their few pure memories left intact.
---
Stumbling upon some power armour they see a way to remain safe(r) while exploring but the cold steel look reminds them of the war they've briefly learned about in their time outside the vault. A combination of radiation exposure and inability to cope with the real terror of the ruined land they once called home sends them slightly crazy. The devastation in the school coupled with their already fragile mental state cracks their psyche. After finding some crayons in a school they regress mentally to the state of a 5-year-old and begin frantically scribbling all over their power armour. A few hours later after a nap they wake to see the power armour and while understandably shocked at not remembering any of it they decide to leave it as the colours remind them of happier times.
---
This entire sistem is way too basic, and it needs a rework
---
Same as well
---
There should be 2 to 3 vendors per station
---
That seems ... backwards
---
At least now the mr fuzzy helmet, which can‚Äôt have its light upgraded like a regular mining helmet, is less of a terrible choice. 
---
I'm the guy who reminds my group of it every single time... except for the one time that it gets me.
---
Yeah I know. I hoped Bethesda would do more but clearly not. And I think the only people who dumped stuff did it just in case the rumours were true. Not claiming everyone did if you get me. 
---
Thanks - I had no idea! So I've been beating my head against the wall for days now doing this. Yup, I'm a DA...
---
Or just trade 400 caps for it :) 
---
They are probably testing the community's reaction to global events and benefits through them. Yet feed the people was fixed to not give out food to everybody on the server.
---
There are 18 mutations, thats not much chance to get exactli one. You will spare much time, if you kill scorchbeast queen and from that 400caps you get for completing scorched earth you buy serum from market.
---
Cancerous? What does that even mean, totally uncalled for.
---
Last time I was there, there were TWO wendigo!  The cave is actually a loop - there's a way out to a ledge above a room near the entrance, if you had marsupial you could shortcut the whole maze with a jump to the exit tunnel.   If not, then generally speaking, curve to the right, as that's the direction the cave loops around in.  The wendigo(s) are naturally in a room full of mess right at the end.
---
That error code is a general error. Something happened that threw an exception and stopped code execution. On the pc version it would be a ctd(crash to desktop) please feel free to Google the error
---
Before this patch I hadn't blue screened in a good month. Since the patch I have screened 10 times in an hour. A friend got 11 in 30 mins.
---
It's the rise of the Synths.  and possibly Skynet.
---
Btw, why is there a need to repair those? I did this event countless times throughout my 280hour journey and never got a chance to figure out what exactly changes if you don't repair the damn things. One thing I remember clearly: enemies continue to spawn even if all 3 exctractors are down. So what's the difference?
---
My idea is that these perks could have passive (always on) and active (on only when equipped effect). Like lockpick would enable picking tougher locks (passive) and increase the size of the sweat spot (active). Or Gunsmith would enable better recipes (passive) and slow down weapon degradation (active). Fire in the hole would show the grenade arc (passive) and increase grenade range (active). Some perks could even get combined into single perk where active effect is one original card and passive effect the other original card. 
---
I bet you think killing people in cod is griefing too lol 
---
F*CK YEAH. 
---
I‚Äôve been waiting for this (using tethering HUDs and missing my F4 junkie idiot savant on berry mentats). 
---
There‚Äôs nothing nicer than a fully loaded bloodied automatic rifle, 20 rounds in the mag, **alll** of which are about to find their target, and knowing **exactly** where the bastards are hiding. 
---
Berry mentats ftw.
---
marsupial with the strange in numbers perk, jump height gets buffed and with the perk it gets 25% better while in a team so you jump even higher
---
"Its the dupers" lol
---
my camp near the overseer first camp so i dump every extra stuff there. 
---
Ignore, Report, Move On. 
---
Glad they bothered to fix this issue in the two and a half years since it was introduced in Far Harbor. 
---
I just stopped lockpicking and hacking, it just aint worth the trouble for crappy loot 99% of the time.
---
Somewhere that my camp isn't! :) 
---
They‚Äôve been playing the game a different way than you have and you‚Äôve obviously had different game experiences. Don‚Äôt be a bitch.
---
Seems legit!
---
just did it;)
---
I have given this post platinum as it's high priority
---
Only level 43 just now. Ran into a level 85 last night. Helped him win the Posiden plant. Super cool dude, dropped me a bunch of stuff. Not the first time higher levels have helped me out. I'll be sure to return the favor when it comes. Pay it forward people.
---
I just ignored you got 90% shield along as you dont attack
---
Request sent.
---
I just want a "join same server as friend" option which I can use from the start/character screen. Logging in to a server and then having to join a new server is an awful waste of time, particularly when it then puts you in a queue or they don't show with a join option. 
---
They obviously didn't kill you unprovoked, the game doesn't work like that.
---
Price works the same way now.  Try trading between characters for 0 caps.. it loops back to 25,000
---
I will send a message to a low level usually when I clean my stash to keep a nice ratio. I go to them or they come to me doesn't matter.
---
It's been like that in every bethesda rpg. Loxkpicking only grants you some more basic (i.e. trashy) loot.
---
well for me i was selling to a vendor my extra chems and then this guy star jumping and flashing his PA light, i told him in to wait his damn turn and that i am almost done, then he started attacking me, I turned to him and one shoted him with my deathclaw gauntlet, got his junk and fast traveled lol, 
---
Well I am also unsure, though when extractors are up and running, you can hear that mining yield was increased, I think you can get better rewards from quest completion, problem is that is hard to try when nobody is repairing/defending them...
---
I think it's the second option, we joined a fresh server to avoid any problems and the bluescreening just kept hitting us, we couldn't even get four players to log on at the same time, it's really messed up
---
Thanks a lot, put a bunch of effort into this one! I'd totally love for there to be more traps and powered items for the camp.
---
If only the implementation of basements or building below ground level could be a thing.
---
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
If only... 
---
Now that I think about it, I would settle for a deployable anti-aircraft turret. An item in my inventory that I could "use" like a power armour to deploy it, which would then sit on the ground and shoot at anything hostile and airborne until disabled. I'm thinking a bit like a large, quad-barrel version of the regular machine gun turret, but a bit bigger and with the LMG for weapons. You would have to repair it when damaged, things like that. 
---
It shouldn't be able to take out a Scorchbeast on its own, and you could only have one, but it would provide some fire support. Also, for a bit of balance, it couldn't engage enemies on the ground. 
---
Thanks üòÄ
---
Some people are just dicks - online and IRL.  
---
Thanks all of you for explaining ..
---
Thumbs up to you all ...
---
Great community .
---
No, they‚Äôre throwing out hypotheticals. I don‚Äôt believe for a second they‚Äôve been on a team where all teammates went over each other‚Äôs Perks and rearranged it so each and every one of them has hacking/lock picking and other passive perks don‚Äôt have any overlap or any unequipped.
---
If you‚Äôre level 26 in the Whitesprings trying to farm level 40 - 60 mobs, and can‚Äôt do it without having a C.A.M.P do all the work for you, perhaps you should take the hint.
---
Location isn‚Äôt the problem. It‚Äôs whata being done with the base at said location.
---
&gt; So what's the difference?  
---
As far as I've been able to tell... nothing.  
---
Even if you extract 100% that just ends the event before the timer runs out, you don't get anything special.
---
With stacked bobbleheads and legendary weapons and perks it can at the moment unfortunately.
---
I‚Äôve been wanting a trip wire that turns power OFF when activated to make a trap. Tried a manually activated one with the garage door to make a trap. It worked. Guy threw a grenade to get out, not realizing it was my house, not the bait‚Äôs (lvl 10 with a bounty). 
---
It was entertaining.  Would have been better if my dumbass hadn‚Äôt have forgotten to put on my armor before dealing with the guy wrecking the place. 
---
Cheat engine have nothing to do with fallout. It is a tool to modify application memory with a few smart memory watches to make gamehacking easier. 
---
It‚Äôs become a lot more common of late. The previous norm was immediately outside the golf club with turrets but no artillery.
---
Oof
---
Bobbleheads stack? That's fucking stupid
---
Glad to hear it! Yeah boxes are often practical but rarely characterful, glad you were inspired to carry on :)
---
hahahahaha Bethesda is just incompetent
---
Nope. I don't use chems either. I would if they didn't increase thirst...maybe. I just vendor them for fast travel caps.
---
It doesn‚Äôt spawn on the traveling vendor bot, never seen it.
---
Then let's not set a cap at all and just ban people with 5k pounds?
---
I'm cool with having to swap perks and not have anything be passive, but it would be nice if we could make "loadouts" without using third party mods.  I don't want to get banned for the sake of convenience.  
---
Say I'm crafting at camp or engaging in a nuke blast, it would be so helpful to make a couple clicks and swap from a "general life" loadout that includes weight reducing perks to my desired perk loadout for common tasks like vendoring, hacking/lockpicking, camp crafting (I could probably make a single secondary loadout that would encompass camping, vendoring and lockpicking/hacking and swap in the odd perk when my weapon or armor piece is low durability and needs fixing) or a nuke site loadout that swapped all weight reduction for defensive perks.
---
It's kinda awkward to see a lvl 90 glowing deathclaw and have to stop and spend upwards of 30 seconds swapping in extra defensive perks and making sure Lone Wanderer is equipped instead of Hard Bargain/Travel agent, or seeing if I remembered to swap Bloody Mess back in from Super Duper after making a bunch of food and drink.  All the while someone else might come out of nowhere, jump 20' in the air and kill it offhand with a bird boned kangaroo legendary explosive shotgun build in a full ultracite suit.
---
Please streamline the system, because constantly sorting through a deck of cards is easily the most tedious part of my game experience.  I love the versatility, but having to sort through so many cards (even if I know exactly where everything is) just to pick a lock or make a bunch of food is getting annoying.
---
Mmh not keen on the idea, at least atm I can cater my builds to what fits the perks I need active at any moment, For example, I tend to take End 3 as that allows a lot of flexibility without taking too many precious special points (e.g. dromedary 1, dog food 1 and slow metabolism or the chemical length 3 usually). Having minimum values would force you to take special amounts higher even though you never use them. Say higher perception on non rifleman characters as its not used much elsewhere so why take it?
---
I still didn't launch a nuke, first time someone followed me in and launched just before I had time to (he didn't leave me enough time to get the code), second time the game crashed in the control room....  I will try again some day. :p
---
If they leave with a bounty and join another server they will still have the bounty,  but at that point you cant do anything about it.
---
Sorry... DEATHCLAW WHAT?!
---
Except when moving i like the pistol faster movement perk despite not being in combat at all. ;)
---
Maybe people don't put the tools back where they go when they leave. :-P
---
Hi and thanks for your good advice :)
---
I didn't know you could run FO76 in borderless windows - This is now enabled instead of Full screen.
---
I run a dual monitor setup (2 Dell 2412M) no TV.
---
As to the sound output in the Windows setting I'm using the USB Audio Interface controller, 
---
not the integrated sound chip/driver that comes with my motherboard/default.
---
If I go to Windows Audio setting and swap the output to another, there will be no sound.
---
Ingame the audio from music/sound effects is ok. 
---
It's just the mic that doesn't respond in any way.
---
Do you see the "hovering mic" when you speak?
---
You do realize you can still stack bobble heads. I've seen screen shots on discord servers of people with 7 and 8 hundred thousand of those things. Until Bethesda makes them where they don't stack, this will be a problem for a while to come....oh, they've already found another dup glitch.
---
LMG definitely needs some love. Despite the exorbitant cost of feeding it, it has a paltry base damage of 16.  
---
The laser gatling too.  Each core weighs 3lb before perks and aren‚Äôt super common. They can only be made using flux, otherwise you have to find or buy them. The fact that it does similar damage to the LMG is pathetic. Meanwhile the plasma gatling and M2 do respectable damage with less severe ammo drawbacks (50 ammo is produced in significantly larger batches and plasma cores cost less to make as well as weigh a 1/3 of FCs). 
---
Yeah that is really the issue here. They gave us a cool new mechanic where we can be flexible with what perks we use, and that's great, but they totally phoned in the implementation so it's a pain in the ass to actually take advantage of it. 
---
There's no game balance affected by making us manage the perks all by hand. It's just a crappy user experience for how they intended us to play. 
---
Somebody go tell that guy/gal whose cat died yesterday and made a post about it that there actually *are* cats in the game
---
I‚Äôm really enjoying Bethesda‚Äôs latest patch thus far. Their willingness to fuck the game this hard is allowing me to take regular breaks away from this piece of shit and work on my own goals outside of the virtual world. Thanks bethesda!
---
Yeah, dont build there beach! I had to blown someone house, becouse it was standing on place where my gf have camp. Make our cabin somewhere on edge of map, we dont want you here! (haha, no it was bad, after she killed me and we was finished with our fun, i repaired that shitty shack with my junk)
---
On xbox a guy is selling the mutation serum for 100 caps. 
---
He is awesome. 
---
Just make sure you have level two starched genes perk, so you never accidentally lose your mutation. 
---
Grow up.
---
It‚Äôs an online world, it adds to the realistic nature of there being other survivors, making their own decisions and actions.
---
Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt play. 
---
Ill try to find lower lvl's and give them a paperbag filled with goodies plus some armor and weapons that i craft.. or leave stuff at overseers camp .
---
You could also choose perks related to heavy guns (except for the non-explosive damage buffs) to reduce heavy gun weight, increase accuracy, etc.  I have a explosive build right now (not perfected) and I am having a blast.  Also, they changed the fireproof perk to include explosion resistance which I use to help not blow myself up.  Oh yeah, and there is a perk that increases explosion blast radius, it's pretty nuts
---
That happens to me sometimes on pc as well
---
Ahh, a larder.
---
Or when you joined an sbq event and didn't realize you were still swapped out with your crafting cards.
---
4/10
---
Lack of original thought, reads like an m night shyamalan movie, oh what a twist....
---
Next time try fir better bait.
---
Who are you talking to? You should reply to the respective comment, not write a new comment to the post.
---
Damnit, your right.
---
I don't want the rules to change. 
---
It is content. 
---
We need more content.
---
Is there a raider hunter subreddit?
---
Oh, and the Auto Grenade Launcher needs to be affected by Bear Arms. 
---
And whatever they did to it‚Äôs AOE with regards to the mainframes in the silos needs reverted ASAP. I used to be able to just pop a 40mm onto each console and wipe out all the cores. Now I‚Äôm lucky if a direct hit gets me even one. Meanwhile my TSE shotgun is wildly more effective in the same use. 
---
My impression of the overall answer was wait till 20 or 30 or 40, based on the difficulty of the area. Yes, many said that the quest item rewards have reduced power below level 50, but many more should also have said that the quest rewards aren‚Äôt very end-game interesting.  As melee, maybe the exception for you might be Super Sledge ‚ÄúAll Rise‚Äù rewarded by the quest ‚ÄúMayor for a Day‚Äù in Watoga, so maybe do that at 50.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of side questing and exploring to be done in Toxic Valley and Ash Heap as well (discovering a bunch of locations and murdering as you go).
---
It seems to be for rhythmic purpose and not the sound.
---
So the wind doesn't do much for the instrument itself.
---
But yeah, otherwise interesting stuff. Thanks for sharing the video!

Wait, so you didn't buy the Hotter Rod or Blackbird Paints when they were available?
---
Happened with a random scorched at the shed next to the MLQ quarry just above Watoga: ran in, got gunned down, animation and noises started sparking like a freshly killed sentry bot, then exploded like one. Normal trash loot like any other scorched.
---
'Always sell diluted rad-x'
---
Nope, not looking to turn off my mutations with the regular kind. 
---
I honestly don't understand why they put *so many shelves* in the furniture options.  What is the point?  I mean seriously, what were they thinking?  Why would we want to look at empty shelving in our Camps?
---
Very nice, like the double aspect room.  Might give that a try.  Inspiring.
---
I solved at end of beta and then it happened again with December patch so I retooled it, same method, and it worked again. So I haven't seen the scenario in months and therefore can't answer whether the mic appeared.
---
Rest assured this is the same scenario I experienced, as I too had sound for environment and music, but when playing with friends I couldn't be heard, then after jiggering I could be heard but couldn't hear my friends. 
---
I work in IT but couldn't solve it, I had to Google, and I had to endure dozens of garbage answers before finding the one that worked. 
---
Good luck :(
---
It's an improvement. Before, your have load screen, then the terrain would load, and your character would (maybe partially) load, and then buildings and enemies and stuff would start popping in, and then you'd be able to move (or if your already moved, you'd rubber band back). 
---
Seems like they added that second short load screen to give everything a chance to finish fully loading.
---
This is the only real "mod" I've downloaded, got it as part of the Imperfect 21x9 fix. Makes life sooooo much easier. Saved fighting builds, crafting build and hacking/lock picking build.
---
happened to me for a while on pc. when it says ‚Äúpress any key‚Äù if i hit space bar or enter it‚Äôll open up another game, ive had 5 open at once before realizing i have to click mouse 1 to actually continue. 
---
Well, the only benefit of the M79 I see over grenades is the ammount of 40mm you can craft compared to grenades per junk.  With perks, I can craft 9 40mm with one spring but only 1 grenade with 1 spring.  And springs are a precious commodity
---
If it makes you feel better, there IS tons of non-silly stuff coming to the Atom Store eventually, like Carbon coating Power Armor paint, clean suits and such.
---
Is this show a bunch of independent stories similar to X files?
---
I‚Äôve got it set to record in my Dvr just waiting for them to stack up so I can binge
---
If a player has a bounty you have free license to destroy their camp to get to them, so long as they maintain the bounty while you‚Äôre trashing the place.  I‚Äôve done it multiple times without issue. 
---
Just be careful with TSE shotguns. You can kill your target before the other shots land on a wall/item behind them and get a bounty pretty much immediately after clearing theirs allowing them to retaliate easily. 
---
It means you can glitch into it but otherwise can't get there
---
Get better internet then?
---
Just posted a suggestion that would solve this in the future ^_^
---
That is a fun one and has like 3 legendaries in it I think
---
That bug is not new. It‚Äôs been there for quite some time. 
---
Sorry, xbox. 
---
The wife smacks my arm if I zone out while at a vendor. I'm either tired or other.  
---
You could on another character? Maybe you didn't find the right locations or only "found/saw" from a watchtower 
---
LOL somewhat fresh, fuckit have an upvote
---
And they didn't fixed yesterday..
---
Not really those generally went for somewhere around 4k
---
Pay someone 500caps for one.
---
I never understood Second Life.  I tried it once due to the hype but couldn't see the appeal.  If you're on it, what's the deal?  It's not really a game, is it?
---
Sometimes that doesn‚Äôt even work. 
---
I‚Äôve had the issue trying to workaround the fact that upper floors aren‚Äôt allowed to snap onto foundations. Haven‚Äôt tried post patch, but the support columns would let me do it either before. Hopefully that‚Äôs fixed now. 
---
More people harder to kill due to armour increases depending on how meny players are in the event. As ive noticed if i dont get her killed while doing the event her health gose down a lot faster after we "failed" the event and people left thinking ahes going to despawn. 
---
Alien technology probably wouldn‚Äôt get this game to work either.
---
4/10 ? You are too generous...
---
Or in any of the previous patches. One might think they DGAF. 
---
Walk the railroad tracks south from Sunnytop station until you reach a iron deposit on the right. This is also on the cliff. This is where my first base was, forever....great spot and enough flat land to put your house right on the cliff. Not too far north of the observatory building.
---
Is this the first "event" Bethesda talked about when they said "starting in early 2019 we plan to release a variety of in game events that will take place over the course of a week..."? This is considered an ingame event? 
---
Spoilers!
---
Have jetpack and Marsupial
---
Can hit this ledge. What way to turn when i enter?
---
This would cost money. So it‚Äôs a no-no.
---
Didn‚Äôt you get the memo ?
---
"It's a fair cop, but society's to blame."
---
"Agreed, we'll be arraigning them, too."
---
And here I thought everyone was shooting at me because I was throwing Nuka grenades into the clubhouse at Whitespring during a nuke event.  (j/k)
---
Why do I not experience these issues on PC? I don't understand? Are we playing the same game? 
---
No, and if it would , i would alt+f4 at first sight.
---
I‚Äôm starting to dump things in overseer cache in flatwoods from time to time
---
Griefing camps more fun than the actual end game content
---
Tried it myself tonight, spent all my caps on plans and loaded up my TSE shotgun, equiped my bonus damage to structures perk went hunting. Stand at your base too long and I'll spot you.
---
Leveled this guys camp and killed him 3 times in pvp when he tried to stop me, made a nice 400ish caps from the experience
---
Good times 
---
(Inb4 downvotes)
---
I assume it's a bug in this quest that prevents the progressbar to get to 100% no matter what. And I believe this is the only criteria that would make a difference in quest rewards. Maybe there even should be a random legendary at 100%, who knows
---
&lt;cough&gt;
---
Man.  I thought I'd try out a bunch of Lover's Lab mods on Fallout 4, out of curiosity.  I set up a testing ground at the Red Rocket settlement.
---
...Shit got dark fast.  Human experimentation is not ethical, who knew?
---
I bought a TSE handmade for 1k from a Super Duper. 
---
Perks or SPECIAL ?
---
I know, I'm a pastor irl so I tend to be on the soft side when I'm judging people... Lol
---
If you do this to someone it's all laughs. If someone does this to you. You'd bitch and moan. My God this sub needs to understand what's griefing and what's not
---
Thanks for the support but I'm on ps4 unfortunately
---
Yeah a bit, I'm just a little soft on people lol
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. I‚Äôve sold so many to vendors. 
---
Ps4?
---
I think you are talking about the Handmade gun plans and not the Lever gun plans?
---
&gt; . I‚Äôve played, I dunno, 5 or 600 hours and when I remember 
---
Surely you should remember if you‚Äôve played five hours or six hundred hours üòù
---
You might discover there is a different world out there üò≥üòîüòâ
---
My load times have increased exponentially...
---
I swear I had never gotten blue screened when the game was released. It was really glitchy yes.. didn‚Äôt even get that many server disconnects. All this stuff started happening around the December patch, and this patch just now? Unplayable, it‚Äôs just not acceptable really. No amount of excuses and fanboyisms can defend what this game is right now.
---
Hey! Pretty happy to talk with you. I was sleeping sorry. I can't figured out very well cause I don't always watch my budget bar. But I'm pretty sure that it happened when he died. Btw I can say to you my route.
---
- moved camp
---
- mega sloth die
---
- reboot the game to see if he is really dead
---
- mega sloth alive. Killed again
---
- reboot again but finally he is dead
---
- moved my camp like 2 or 3 times cause I figured out I have the stored budget without anysense.
---
- deleted blueprints and scrapped ALL the items cause I was madding.
---
- surrender with 30 stored budget
---
"a little " ? :)
---
It had a preview of the paint on every pa model that it works on.
---
I‚Äôm sure my internet connection is exactly what causes Bethesda to constantly experience server crashes. 
---
It has nothing to do with internet connection. If you think it does, you clearly don‚Äôt play the game or have shit internet and think that‚Äôs the cause. 
---
I don't have alts right now and I'm not sure if atoms from alts sums up to (maybe they do, don't know).
---
I've been it those places and even done quests there, not only marked them on map from watchtowers.
---
I don't have that problem, my camp is isolated. 
---
Xbox :(
---
thanks for asking, wondered the same thing cause I feel like I run into him constannnntly
---
Or you two could have simply jumped servers and not bothered to ruin someone else experience.
---
It‚Äôs sad but the majority of online gamers are entitled crybabies who if things don‚Äôt go their way they stomp and throw a fit.  It‚Äôs just the world we live in today. 
---
I got  my TSE lever action for 1500caps PS4
---
Your comment is longer than my post. I‚Äôd say the bait worked. 
---
I count myself lucky then, I've dc'd sure, but never blue screened. My client hasn't quit to desktop since this last patch either. I have experienced some of these issues just in very small doses, other than blue screens.
---
Keep shouting things like ILL WEAR YOUR GUTS AROUND MY NECK and WE ARE THE FUTURE
---
Rose's quest that got me the Plan: Light Raider Legs is called "Signal Strength."
---
apparently all of the platforms got messed up after the patch, on pc the disconnecting was absolutely horrible. you should probably expect a ‚Äúhotfix‚Äù within the next few days to a week, at least we got one on pc after the server stability went to hell
---
If I fucking wanted realism, I wouldn't fucking play video games. 
---
Bethesda about to get #metoo'd
---
Exactly.
---
Sweet thx for that.
---
Had the same, moved away from watoga abd haven't crashed yet. Maybe some areas are a bit messy atm.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78HjBuy945Q  watch it here
---
*clearly* because that info just sticks out. My internet is fine and I guarantee you I've put more time in than you have.
---
Bethesda will properly put out a emoticon pack soon but bet you its going to cost the same as those Christmas emotes that were on sale. 
---
Alright man, I just didn't whana chrush the little guys soul. It is a straight 0/10, if we can a constantly growing negative variable / 10. Op need to get a life....
---
... This is why my church can't handle when I speak lol
---
I got heat flashes by fighting Honey beast.
---
I tend to stay away from that since those r from dupers and they ruined the economy I‚Äôm not gonna support them by buying their stuff
---
Thank the lovely people who abused the spawn glitch to mass level. The game wasn‚Äôt intended for people to level up so fast. 
---
Craft skeleton costume for a little cloth and plastic. Sell each for 60c for each faction vendor cap each day.
---
That‚Äôs it.
---
I wish I could do the mental gymnastics you are doing so I could justify using cheats in an online game and calling them mods. You seriously think the mods I listed aren't cheating? People have posted screenshots of their ban email and have insisted they only used retexture mods or other ui changes. 
---
Do you know any spots for honey beasts?
---
I saw a dude at 996.
---
One can only wonder.
---
Yes. I hope it too. I was so happy to find a better spot with water good position and good view. But another bug faced to me. I love this game. I just want that they fix all the things to play in peace like in every fallout.
---
I wrote the "route" I remember before I figured out my budget in my post.
---
I am pretty sure that some people crossed that border and this is why we hear about those bans. On the other hand, I myself consider the ability to adjust UI - just the damned UI, not the actual game - is like the best thing to ever happen in online game, and I really hope these things are going to be incorporated into the final product, as they are pinnacle of community-based gaming.
---
Your post is 31 words, mine was 23...
---
Shoot. I went up there and didnt snap a pic. I'll have to next time. 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox One X and can confirm the quick load. My Pip-Boy is usually the last of me to load in, and I can‚Äôt use certain environmental object, I.E. hand scanners, until I‚Äôm fully in. Other than that I‚Äôve noticed a marked improvement in my stability while playing; no D/Cs in three hours of play yesterday.
---
I don‚Äôt doubt it, given how fast you fell to your knees to suck Bethesda‚Äôs dick. 
---
Don't worry, they're not exactly rare.
---
Free Hat!
---
I'm level 122 and unfortunately I'm hesitant around anyone level 50+. I always do my best to accommodate people at events, but I'd say at least 60% of the time there's some super douche with a TSE killing four enemies at once and not allowing me or my team to get any experience or loot...
---
Yup its all the players fault. Again.
---
And that‚Äôs +8!
---
Well the same with the way it is now, it is even more over complicated because you have all the Perks you just need to manually swap them out, which isn't fun and just takes time away from actually playing. 
---
Are you okay, Annie?
---
Level 3 saves can have nice loot. 
---
I have travel agent always on.
---
 I got 3 perk sets via 
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
One for combat, one for locks and hacking, third for crafting and vendors.
---
Ah bugger. Sorry then. Yeah I wish it was already included in the game. The native sorting system is fairly useless
---
I've brought them. Only 2 caps a piece.
---
In that case I just leave, let all them lowbies die when the high lvls leave
---
Strange, my safes have been empty lately.
---
Had several server disconnects last night. Had a few here and there before the patch. Also started getting the issue when I would look at the PipBoy it would be blank. Didn't have any issues with the PipBoy prior to yesterdays patch.
---
Erm won't cost a penny on the pc version ;-)
---
Oh my! I'll try and brace myself then :D
---
I work with audio and IT daily so it's not the lack of knowledge in the area I lack either and that is why this puzzles me.
---
But if I understand you correctly (I'm a Dane so English is not my native language and I might miss out on something in your answer) I have to change the DISPLAY output in the Windows 10 settings? Not output in sound setting.
---
We your bait was horrible but the other comment on my post is actually pretty fun. Still though doesn't change the original score of the bait. 
---
I am just going to hang on to the nuke quest. No patience for expending all my resources on disconnect roulette. 
---
Seneca Rocks Visitor Center or the garden between the Whitesprings resort and the small lodges (not always). 
---
got my copy for 20 dollars, absolutely worth it.
---
Roughly how many items did this guy have/create? Could a normal player (without a mule and not duping on a console) accidentally do this? 
---
Now that the shitstorm has calmed a little, go for it. The game is more stable than it was at launch, and is definitely worth 10.
---
I'm the same, i sell all chems after they stack up to 20
---
You arent supposed too.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they add a cool down to perk switching later on.
---
Not sure what happened as the post has been removed but the impression I get is that you lost a cat? If so, sorry for your loss, I've always been a cat person and had some awful experiences losing them in the past. It's never easy.
---
Look for the event "Irrational Fear" they always spawn in that event.
---
To rebuild database turn off your PS4 then hold the power button till the second beep. Then scroll to rebuild database. controller has to be plugged in with usb
---
Except compared to consoles, PC is exploit heaven. It's far more complicated pulling off current duping and exploits on console without using third party software to hijack controls,  that's also why the fo76 caps market has over a 10x differential between consoles. 
---
Especially with this game, you're far safer and stable on consoles currently if you're playing legitimately, which is disappointing because I usually prefer my PC experience since it's a lot smoother graphics and hardware wise. 
---
i would recommend that game, i liked it. 
---
Fewer, not "none". 
---
But I guess it's easier to pretend it's all Bethesda. They are the one duping after all. And griefing. Todd Howard himself runs across the wasteland, destroying camp after camp, leaving a single line note : "BUY SKYRIM".
---
Sometimes at that freak show camp, just south east of whitesprings I think.
---
I was in Watoga and crashed a lot, moved and its more stable now.
---
I get you.  It isn't a big issue but strength feels like that stat now.  Making other's more important might be good to encourage trade offs.
---
Then again I think they could do things with the damage cards to encourage build flexibility so a perception character isn't pigeon holed into rifles.
---
Would it not be better to just ask them to clear the trash after tagging the SBQ? I mean, i get what your saying but i've been to fight the SBQ once and I was level 36. I hit the queen with every missile, mini nuke, 40mm grenade that I had and spent the rest of the time clearing the spawns. I didn't die once and genuinely feel like i contributed to the event. At the end of the day its an event and everyone regardless of level deserves to turn up to attempt it.
---
Did this one last night. Made for one of my best loading screens! Me in my whitey tighties and beer hat and my wife in girly unmentionables and a chef hat. It's great!
---
Then people like you are the problem. If you want destroy someone's base that they busted their ass grinding resources to build then play fortnite. 
---
Exactly, in the beginning it was all like "WORST GAME EVER FFFFUUUUUU BLABLABLA"
---
but last couple of weeks, people pretty calm about it and made me really wanna buy it . 
---
how are the servers so far? since i'm an solo player due to no friends that play this game 
---
makes me sorta hold me back for it to buy since i looooove to gather with people nad have random fun with it 
---
Not having passive perks or save able swappable "decks" was a serious design flaw. Also the fact you can't pay caps to redistribute special points, I would like to see an overhaul to the current system. Yes it's not broken, but it's not what I would consider good
---
Glad to hear somebody finally talk like this. I'm a bit sick of the daily "add perk loadout feature" posts. If people find lockpicking tiresome they should stop doing it or accept to lose 15% damage.
---
My build has all static cards (3 lockpicking, 3 super duper, 2 starched genes) and everyone here would probably be ill if they saw it. "bUt YoU aRe WaStInG sO mUcH sPeCiAl" Nah I'm just playing the game as it's intended. 
---
&gt; I do believe that changes in how items look (i.e. glowing magazines) indeed get you banned.
---
Hard to believe, those are fairly popular.
---
It's gone. At least you were rewarded for crashes/disconnects if you were in power armor before the fix.
---
How do you know they are AFK?  I know that sometimes I can take a long time at a vendor - looking for things to offload, buying something, looking for more things to offload.  From an outside perspective, it looks like I am just standing there picking my nose.
---
How many times do you need to be told that the emails about bans for using mods were fake news? Did you even read the links I provided you in another reply?
---
You will make friends on the game. My experience is that most players are there just to have fun with game and do not take pleasure in griefing.
---
I'm just putting my drop requests in my stash for now.  Hopefully this is a bug but I'm afraid it's another choice to "build drama".  They seem to want to push pvp even on people that hate it.
---
That would be nice, I was fighting a scortchbeast Queen and my game crashed 
---
Personally, I wish it was even *less* convenient to swap them on the fly. Maybe even charge a cap fee to change it. Maybe there could be a hardcore server option where this was so, because that would actually be a nice boon to roleplaying.
---
Much more interesting and fun (for me anyway) to plan out a build for each character and then stick with once complete, even if I am at a disadvantage. Screw minmaxing.
---
For fuck sake people. The best thing you can do is NOT PLAYING THE GAME. Theyll see the numbers go down and maybe hurry the fuck up and if not well too bad. Thats what im doing. Played for 2 weeks, got a lil bored and saw the issues. Now im waiting till they polish the game a bit more until dupers are gone and disconnects doesnt happen. Im recommending moving on to a different game or do something else and come back later
---
What is wrong with throwing away stuff that you don't use? 
---
Support staff can't see inventories, but of course the dev / database team can see everything. It's not like they applied hyper-secure encryption in the most inadaequate place (inventories) while at the same time leaving some of the client-server talk unencrypted (although that would be really funny), it's just that the devs didn't supply support with the tools to tinker with people's inventories. 
---
But I think those tools should indeed be available by now (programming them should not take longer than one or two days), after all the fire Bethesda has taken, maybe they are still conferencing about what policies the support team should follow using them: what limits on what items do you enforce so that it will not backfire somehow? 5k bobbleheads of every sort or more than 20 identical TSE weapons sound easy enough, but do you just delete / tempban / permaban? Lots of finetuning needed over that...
---
I think someone might have already claimed it
---
You would host the pts free for Bethesda ?
---
I did, and came to the conclusion that you're full of shit
---
It's "funny" that many dupe to sell in the real world but they're making potential customers quit the game due to frustrations. But yeah, this patch has made crashing/DCs worse for me on XB1.
---
If you have crit savvy instead of four leaf clover.
---
you can perform a critical shot every other shot with 15 luck. (if your armor has any +1 that's enough with your current 14)
---
Regular shot -&gt; crit shot -&gt; regular shot -&gt; crit shot
---
Who does it for battle.net ? They host themselves.  
---
Come on, it deserves at least a 5/10. 
---
I actually love the game, I didnt forget though that  bethesda seemingly never released this list almost a month after they said it was coming out ‚Äùin the next few days"
---
Oh I hope that‚Äôs not true. I need those 8 stimpacks. 
---
Yes.  I seldom pay attention to anyone and play solo and I restart way too much, but I keep wanting to play.  You will be pleasantly surprised after playing and wonder why all the negativity.  The game provides Events.  I like working with others on these, but apart from that I will always play at my pace.
---
There is a junk lead but it doesn‚Äôt have access to water and it‚Äôs on a hill so I don‚Äôt like the location 
---
Hardened mass: i have 7 but the Scrap All Junk ignored this.  Why?  It scraps into ultracite.  
---
Is there something that has Hardened Mass as an ingredient???
---
Well, a fool and his money are soon parted. Carry on.
---
Well I dare you to shuffle your perks during a glowing one horde spawn to adapt to team perks and so on.
---
I might be wrong but I swear in Fo4 there was an audio cue that would give a pretty clear sign that they would explode and when. But I‚Äôm just not hearing or noticing it in Fo76 at all. Died quite a few times because I‚Äôd kill a cluster with a grenade and when I go to loot one would explode without warning.
---
Personally I think making it possible at camps only would be the worst of two worlds, honestly. You would still want to switch cards all the time, but not be able to. Thus, more annoyance than now.
---
Making it impossible to switch cards (like in most other rpgs, including previous fallouts) would mean a choice that matters. That would have been my preferred solution if I had designed the game from start. But as it stands, the game is built around random cards which makes permanent cards a horrible solution for this particular game.
---
Also, as you say, the way the game is currently made noone in their right mind would choose lockpicking over combat perks. In a single player game this could quite easily be balanced by better loot in locked containers. But I think that would be less optimal in an online game. For the endgame combat is most likely all that matters. Lockpicking is more relevant during exploration. 
---
So my conclusion is that making a choice set of perk cards into passive abilities instead, and/or implementing a simple system for loadouts (which should REALLY have been an obvious design choice even before launch) would be the best possible way forward. 
---
Just say no.
---
I think you are misleaded. Swapping cards is intended to let you try stuff and turn round if the tested perk wasn't satisfying / fitting for your build. 
---
It's not intended to give you the almighty power to craft everything, hack everything, lockpicking everything, all while keeping your damage bonus. People would get that if perk card swapping was restricted somehow (inside camps and workshops? after sleeping? something).
---
I now just skip it too. Can‚Äôt be that good of stuff inside for the delay to switch them out and the chance that I forget to switch them back. 
---
Man, it's ok, it happens to the best of us. Sometimes we fail and it's just about getting back up and baiting again...
---
Been disconnected maybe 5x since beta. I don‚Äôt have that problem sadly. 
---
Its good idea and its nit hard to do. Dont let convince yourself by Bethesda that everything is hard to do just because they do their minimal.
---
I absolutely agree. It‚Äôs the worst part of the game and there‚Äôs a lot to choose from in that category. 
---
I had the same thing happen twice on ps4. I decided to change the layout during construction but couldn't.  I lost about 80 caps just trying to build a camp. 
---
Also on the hill between Morgantown train station and the junkyard. Just at the very top.
---
You mean my brother. Or myself, who had contacted Bethesda for a ticket with my account. So that Bethesda read his feedback about the "bannmail"?
---
on pc? selling it?
---
Yeah nobody plays this shit on pc bro üòÇ
---
there is absolutely no need.. im lvl 163 with a couple hundred hours in, I play one character with zero mules. I am able to craft what I want, make a new base when I want, make ammo, etc. all with minimal effort with whats in my stash and what I can collect in a short amount of play time. I do all of this with a non PA rifle build with 1 strength and usually have 10-20lbs of room in my stash in case i find a weapon. What on earth are you doing with 100k in weight?
---
Nothing I have ever seen costs 2000 atoms most I have seen is power armor paint for 1800 
---
I may be wrong but I am pretty sure in fallout 4 you could mount your weapons on the wall? I want one of those secret rooms behind a book case like in the films with guns everywhere 
---
I wish it were possible in some magic way to put items anywhere, without people being able to take them, it's one thing I really loved in past games. In FO3 and NV I used to hoard Nuka trucks and in FO4 it was a room full to the brim of Jangles the Moon Monkeys. I remember my brother used to fill his Megaton home in FO3 with body parts he salvaged from gore bags, haha.
---
I mean it's probably totally impossible for a lot of reasons, but how fun would it be to wonder into somebody's C.A.M.P and see a room loaded with skulls or something.
---
For your sake i hope so!
---
But power armor headlamps are brighter. Seems like a fair trade off
---
The rewards aren't huge  
---
One technical data:
---
* 350 experience points
---
* 25 caps
---
* Random Brotherhood underarmor mod and/or Brotherhood clothes
---
* Random consumables
---
* Random ammo
---
Two or more technical data:
---
* 400 experience points
---
* 40 caps
---
I misread that as Fawkes, and it made me get all nostalgia-y about FO3 :(
---
Here we go again with the grey markey "subtle" promotions. Proceed with caution.
---
We're all trying to read signs from smoke and wind, and there are no reliable answers to question: what can get you banned.  
---
This is why I believe that as long as you're on the safe side of "cheating" (i.e. nothing you do could qualify), you are safe. Changing the appearance of items to make them easier to notice in a game based on scavenging locations in order to find stuff of value does not seem to be on the safe side anymore. On the contrary, this is a tactical advantage.  
---
I don't want the game to be easier, I want to it to be less tedious. I want to concentrate on interactions with other players, not on looking for specific perk card in the whole lot unwanted perk cards I received from unwanted perk card packs across last 200 levels of playing this game.
---
I get it, everyone is a liar and a stupid trump supporter but you. It's the players that are liars, only accept Bethesdas word and blame everything on dupers. I bet you are the type that thinks the servers are perfectly stable too. 
---
Dude 50 rad resist is a LOT for someone outside of a hazmat suit or power armour. 
---
I imagine it was claimed pretty quickly.
---
Plus you can use the escape artist perk to become hidden in the middle of combat.
---
lol why would I listen to anything you have to say I literally just caught you in a lie you pulled out your ass
---
Just missed it. Lol.
---
I always kept them in FO4 because they were so rare, but yeah same here, you get into the habit in 76 of 'scrap all junk' and I've lost so many cool trinkets that way
---
"Sorry boss must've dropped my Driving and Call for Help skill cards in my locked car with the keys inside. Can't come to work today, nothin' I can do."
---
ever hear of 'Hoarders'? lol
---
Are all the problems fixed yet?
---
Take him chicken hunting with a BB gun?
---
The problem is the queen scales with the number of players present, if 10 lowbies are not doing any damage to it and there are no expoilters/dupers around...you get it.
---
I seem to always get that as loot. Thought it was just a fluke.
---
Up by the space station. Its hard to clip the pond and both extractors however.
---
I'm on PS4, happy to pay good caps for marsupial. Even more to craft it. PSN dtb7591.
---
Many thanks
---
Wha do you mean bro? I don't use reddit that much besides scrolling and stuff. 
---
yhea I had an idea that from lvl 50 onwards we should be able to make non combat perks passive, in the same style as changing SPECIAL points out
---
Or you know, you'd play games that are billed as realistic survival shooters... not Fallout!
---
Escape from Tarkov, SCUM, Rust... those are all great games based on survival, hardcore mechanics, and fucking peoples day up.
---
I thought we already had that, as in ‚Äúhere‚Äôs my credit card, go do this skill for me.‚Äù
---
Some of the Mole Rats in this game (especially the ones that spawn with Mole Miners) are strapped with Frag Mines. Could be possible you found one of those but the game glitched and didn't spawn the Frag Mine "outfit" for it. 
---
there are no perk points. there are only perk cards and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points. you wanna change S.P.E.C.I.A.L. point? you can do so after lvl 50 with every lvlup. you can change perk cards anytime as u go.
---
Ditto. I'm wearing lower-level armour I don't like now because of that. Before the patch I could make new pieces, if they broke, if I didn't have any ballistic fibre left. There was nothing inappropriate in doing that. The only places I know where to get Ballistic Fibre were miles away and it's really expensive to buy. Disappointed by this change when I'm an honest player who doesn't use any tricks. 
---
I like it.
---
The best thing about a melee build is hearing super mutants scream "RUN AWAY!!!".
---
Hahah I‚Äôm there now like on the ledge over looking the pond
---
Yup lol
---
Can't you scrap them manually? They don't get automatically scrapped when you use the scrap all junk button, because it's a crafting component for the ski sword.
---
They should have created like 10 levels or something where you eventually could unlock and learn these skills. instead of having to hold cards to use them.
---
I think for a shotgun anti armor is better but like two shot for the spread on my rifles so I can wipe out groups with explosive 
---
&gt; it equals to having all perks active all the time 
---
I do believe it does not because you are still responsible for managing these decks, modifying those decks as you progress, and making sure your decks are appropriate to the particular activity you are doing. I.e. combat perks and vendor run perks are rarely the same perks.  
---
But I generally agree with your observations and the only thing I'd add is that at 150 and 200 the problems of 100 go up by another factor.
---
It would be pretty cool if they had a junk tab where you could build 'new' versions of junk items to display. Like if you collect 5 desk fans you can craft a "New Desk Fan" for your C.A.M.P. Would be fun for completionists who want to go out hunting for some of the less common junk to show it off on their shelves.
---
Cheers pal! Imma get it in abiut 15 min.. 10 bucks doesn't sound so bad. Hope that my laptop will run it lol. 
---
It's all anecdotal. For instance, I've gone from 20+ blue screens per day to 3. I previously would blue screen 2 out of 3 times when opening my stash, a vendor, or trading menus, and it didn't happen a single time in 7 hours of gameplay since the patch. 
---
Same on XB1
---
Just tossing this gem out there: Regardless what YOU think {I've been reading the thread}. This is a online game with real live people playing it, they behavior isn't something you can dictate by using some moral compass of not fucking with others.
---
Not going to happen.
---
Mad people blew up your base cause they're upset you built where they did? Too bad, it's a part of the game you do need to deal with. If you're on a extractor of any material, junk, lead, iron, water or whatever. It's bound to happen.
---
There is a perk called contractor that offers 50% reduced cost in repairs. There is also the method people abuse of replacing your camp right next to where you placed it before so you can just use the blueprints for free repairs.
---
It's part of the game, learn to deal with it. Or like you keep saying. Hop to another server. 
---
Given the opportunity, people will grief and in this game .. you're kinda suppose to as part of the mechanics. I mean it's not like pvp is viable alternative, lol. The person who shots first generally dies first unless they're a duper with 500 explosive bobbleheads stacked.
---
Don't be a bitch
---
Maybe. But BGS is usually an announce a secret company, so this would be a cultural change
---
Yeah bro....
---
Check you apparell tab to ensure the chassis doesnt have two chest pieces attached. Sometimes that happens.
---
Right now we have a bug where you see people connected with other people names, you can distinguish your friends by the icon in this case. Then there's the offline bug, where you literally see people offline but they aren't.. this get fixed after a while (nothing seems to fix it, only time). I'm on pc too
---
Yeah, if it's supposed to be a feature it should A] go both ways (from max to zero, too), and B] STOP at either of the extremes, and then go to the other one when and only if you press the button / trigger AGAIN.
---
I've dropped weapons and stimpacks for low level characters but they never pick them up. 
---
I would get rid of the pick locks and Baker don‚Äôt do very much the loot from them is crappy I would invest it into strength more
---
I mean that grey subtle stuff. 
---
This is the sort of stuff that gives them a day off, you should be compensated, you're likely doing somebodies job. That they get paid for.
---
XBOX
---
Blackwater Mine is good to farm mutations too. They even have a decontamination chamber there so you can remove mutations you don't want. Unlock Starched Genes to max rank so you can lock it in and not lose it 
---
I discovered this yesterday when I nearly died to a destroyed Legendary Protectron. I thought it was just Sentry Bots!
---
Assistant to the Wasteland Manager
---
I too experienced the black pip boy thing twice.   I forgot about it till you brought it up.   The pip boy was black as night with nothing on it.  Eventually I had to kill the game to get out of it.  
---
I'd like this for my teddy bear collection. Love those cute little things. 
---
I spent 6x that and don‚Äôt regret it a bit
---
Lol I get that a lot as well
---
No, and No. 
---
north of sunshine meadows, though its  a popular spot :p
---
and it probably got resold on g2a :P
---
Sorry...mini nuke them. Shoot them all in their dumb faces. Bc wasting time by participating in a fake wedding is punishable by death.
---
a better way to have done it would have been random acts of gaming reddit with like a contest or a game. There are bots that just scan reddit for cd keys
---
This is me (minus the queens). Especially because after a client crash, the 'recent' tab is empty. I am not  a team player perk-wise, and so my only option right now is to spam friend invites. This is not elegant.
---
I hate this bug almost as much as mosquitos.
---
Yep, having similar problems on PC. Lots of us cant do the queen anymore. I havent played for days.
---
This has been requested repeatedly, and will continue to be requested repeatedly as it‚Äôs such a big hole in the CAMP system. I really hope they‚Äôre at least starting to work on it. 
---
Bad games are those where you have to play as intended to have fun.  
---
Good games are those which adjust to how they are played, instead of forcing the one and only proper playstyle that was intended in it.  
---
I do think F76 is a good game because it allows many people with different expectations to find their fun in it. I'm bit sick of the notion that anybody is in the position where they feel they are justified to define how something is intended to be used. 
---
There is no denying that perk swapping, with all its advantages, can be done swiftly or painfully. Current implementation is painful chore. Games shouldn't be chores, and we want better implementation of this mechanics, so that it can be utilized to its full extent.
---
This is exactly what I thought it was going to be. I took 15 intelligence when I set up my first  character. What's the point? Most demanding peeks are 5. Which you'd swap out when crafting.
---
It took me weeks to finish that quest, and at least once a log in/server hop I clear white springs. You'll get it eventually.
---
What platform you on? If you're PC you can have a marsupial serum.
---
Seems like they might think you and your brother are the same person or there is a muling situation between you or something. 
---
Were u teamed up?
---
What was first 
---
Do you genuinely don't understand error messages and codes or are you just ignorant? Because your comment makes 0 sense.
---
Fun for me and I‚Äôm in over 300 hours lol üòÇ 
---
"Soon". I look forward to that day.
---
Yep, you and me both man. I remember being level 12 in grafton getting my ass kicked by super muteys and the beast. Cleared the full town then BAM... muteys appear next to me! 
---
Yikes
---
There are at least 7 unique factions with their own pool of caps...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9z75c3/list_of_faction_vendors/
---
Whitesprings and Enclave bunker each have their own caps. These are the first two I hit every time. Then, Watoga station and Wallace (BOS). Harper's ferry for Free States and then to top of the world for Raider caps. Responders last.
---
Every day, there are several "Hey, is this game worth $10-15?" posts.  Those prices are only on key seller sites, which are sketchy at best (grey market).  Your post reads like an ad for one of those sites.  Or, at least an ad to search for those sites (subtle promotion).
---
I think the cryolator should really be an endgame weapon.  
---
If people want to PvP they can do hunter/hunted. If they want that "viable pvp" then there is a host of other games that promote, even encourage it. 
---
No he can't, because what he said is bullshit. I got the same blue screens playing FO76 until I had enough and deleted it. No other game EVER produced that error message on my ps4. None. Ever.
---
Even if it did cost money for them to do it. They can't really afford these constant fuck ups 
---
Do you really not know how to check your inventory before posting on Reddit 
---
However, this is not about other accounts, but only mine. And that bann, was only because of the demand of my brother's unanswered ticket. Bethesda writes in this bannmail that I have duplicated and my inventory accordingly exaggerated many items. But thats absolute nonsense. pity that I did not make a video or screenshot of my inventory content. But I can assure you that I have neither duplicated nor duplicated items ever stored in my account or in my possession.
---
Ah ok. Thanks bro wasn't aware of it. My. Apologies for that
---
The key is *I* have never seen (...)
---
Ahhh, fair enough. I shouldve got it for my ps pro, as i know like 12 people with 76 for ps4 and noone with it for pc!
---
Usually, the ones in higher level areas can be 65-80
---
but i don't want to lose my other mutation
---
Hey, bit old but did you ever get the drop? I'm looking for the event cosmetics as well. Have been doing the proper events only for the last twee weeks every day. Haven't gotten any yet. It is a pain since the dailies are bugged and for some reason I rarely get events in divide or mire. I am like lv 200 purely questing in the forest because of this..... Like I know the content is there but it won't pop up on my map. I have visited every location and roam through the areas for an hour or 2. But yeah I have done A LOT of quests and I'm kind of convinced its just bugged or people getting it after beta are exploiting or trading it from an exploiter. The rare cosmetics used to be lootable in beta. Have seen a guy in the BoS jumpsuit but this was after devroom items like tactical marine was already in rotation.
---
So far they seem to be quite cautious, and that is better.
---
Nah i don't think there's a massive problem with it. Having presets would make it absolutely perfect, in fact. I like that you have to invest into Hacking and Lockpicking, and contrary to what whiners here are saying i've definitely found worthwhile loot locked away. Defeinitely not a problem i have with the game, anyway. 
---
This. They‚Äôre protected same as beer bottles, hallucigen canisters, baseballs, and now hardened mass (i know I‚Äôve left something off that list, but you get the idea). 
---
Yeah i completely agree either passive or deck swapping is the way to go with how this game is setup. 
---
I'd like to see some better loot come from long/hard quests or the SBQ also. Or at least something besides straight up RNG to progress. It doesn't need to be entirely linear, but lvls 60 to 110 i don't see my character getting significantly more powerful no matter what I do (quests, sbq, exploration in high lvl areas) bc its almost entirely dependent on getting lucky drops and thus far i havent been very lucky. But that's a whole other topic.
---
It‚Äôs a known glitch, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn‚Äôt ARE YOU 100% SURE that the recruitment blues quest is active?
---
Thank you. I appreciate it x
---
For me the pipboy inventory lags or whatever in certain areas like the Rogers Compound. I drop an item, its still listed on my inventory but theres a delay, sometimes even have to re access the pipboy. And often the bag disappears basically like that one infamous stair the ghouls drop through, on the outskirts of Whitespring cottages.
---
you lost me at "social justice"
---
Like repair sections of the track with wood, copper and steel like we can with the Sam turrets
---
Countless times I‚Äôve sat there waiting for other players that never came.
---
You turn your ps4 completely off, no rest mode, completely off. Then pull out the power cord. Leave it for 1-2 mins and put it back in. Turn on your ps4. Done.
---
I'm on PC and i've been bullied and abused by an high level player, 114, naturally TSE.  
---
And it's not even the first time. I mean, i'm level 50, what kind of personal reward an high level player could get by killing me without reason when i'm minding my own business?  
---
I got killed again again again, i tried to fight back but naturally his weapon basically one-shotted me. It's not even the first time that this happened.  
---
What's wrong with the people?  
---
PS: to be clear, i can play only an hour or two a day, if not 3 or 4 times a week. Reaching level 50 was a milestone. I never realized that there's a pacifist mode to enable until the other day, but that happened only when i searched the web for a way to be more protected against this type of griefing.  
---
And getting killed all over again, because i've actually tried to fight back, basically made me loose all my hard earned caps, 300 of them gone.  
---
I seriously hate these peoples. I deeply, truly HATE them. I can understand the PVP engage if i'm at least on par with your level, if i can fight back, but bullying and griefing a low level player that it's trying to enjoy it's free gaming hour it's bad. Horrible.
---
That‚Äôs only $60 the normal price for a game
---
Great idea until griefers start to target them. Maybe adding some form of "grace period" upon stepping out. 
---
I'm level 580 with over 600 hours in, not sure why you think that should be relevant but whatever. 
---
Without a mule there's no point me even continuing to play, I wont find anything better than my best 800 or so weight and I've got at least a max rank of every perk.
---
That's not the kind of trade-off that makes a game better. Having to decide whether to increase your attack bonus at the cost of defensive ability (Berserker legendary) or chance of being suddenly overwhelmed/one-shotted (Bloodied, Unyielding) is a strategic choice that affects gameplay. Choosing between armor based on the balance of physical to energy to radiation protection is a good-gameplay choice. Even *inventory management*--having to choose which weapons and items to carry with you--is a meaningful choice, albeit an incredibly tedious one that I loathe.
---
Whether to slow down your game even more on top of ludicrously-long loading screens in order to use the skills you've acquired is not a choice about gameplay. It's just annoying as fuck.
---
It's nonsense to say you can't apply any realism limitations just because what we have now isn't hardcore realism.
---
I appreciate it thank you. Xox
---
Just saying, a lot of duplication glitches are caused by rejoining a server.
---
I have one with rifles and heavy weapons instead you can take out heavy gunner perks I used and put in shotgun perks
---
Thank you so much xoxo
---
It's much worse when you're trading a player and it asks you how many caps. Then it goes to max 25,000 caps but you can't scroll from 25,000 back to one, you have to go all the way. It's faster to cancel and redo it...
---
I don‚Äôt know who Angry Joe is and I‚Äôm pretty sure his opinion doesn‚Äôt matter to me. Loving this game.
---
My build evolved through 15END (I thought I could sprint indefinitely at 21END like in F4)
---
.. but no), through AGI15, to ultimately arrive at S15/P15/E1/C6/I6/A5/L8.
---
This again is you telling others how to play the game they bought just like you. No bueno. Hunter and hunted faces the same issue I just stated which sucks, cause it can be fun.
---
"The person who shots first generally dies first unless they're a duper with 500 explosive bobbleheads stacked"
---
The best solution would be servers that did and did not offer open PVP/Griefing. If you want PVP .. start a character on X server. Want PVE likewise just have a character on PVE servers.
---
That way people who want pvp don't need to opt into it or face the repercussion of "firing first dying first" thing that goes on with pvp now. It would also allow people who do not want pvp or griefing to play their own ways too on servers with like minded people.
---
I honestly don't think that would 100% fix it. But it would be a step in the right direction to getting better, likeminded servers up. If that makes sense.
---
I found a cat that wasn't hostile (red dot). I forgot the color/breed of the cat. We need cat snacks to feed the wild kitties.
---
It was a synth.
---
Its really dumb. Hopefully they will add in a passive function so we can have some cards equipped all the time.
---
Oh well if it is ANGRY JOE... *deletes game*
---
Yeah that's true and thank you xx
---
Awfull similar to my situation, including the mad scrapping. Only difference is, I was stupid enough to tame a new mega sloth, most likely living atm, but I don't know for sure because I rage quitted the game yesterday before it arrived at my new location. Didn't connect the bug with this specific pet at the time I tamed it, just hoped it would kinda reset the budget or something.
---
I really love the game, and I'm a passionate builder... I hope we'll get a fix. My character is ruined and for now I don't know if I want to start a new main character, start collecting build plans all over again etc...
---
I'm not even angry anymore, just sad.
---
A hundred even - not a thousand.  Perma ban their accounts and no more game.
---
In that case, you may as well call for being able to have all earned perks active at the same time, which is pretty much what this amounts to, and is even smoother and easier to set up. 
---
I'm trying a build of shotguns and rifles, it isn't doing so bad at the moment. Got level 2 damage of both single fire rifles and shit guns.
---
My biggest shit gun does 104 damage.
---
Im only level 29 so well see how well it goes when I get higher up and better perks 
---
You basically either need hacker 3 or lockpick 3 for QOL in some quests, but thats it. Hacker 3 is essential for smooth solo silo runs so you dont have to deal with the turrets. I have 1 PER and havent missed lockpicking at all.
---
My 3 star Combat knife (instigating, 40%swing speed, +1 strength) is just too damn fast and kills most ghouls and often super mutants in one blow. 
---
**10 MInuTeS Isn'T LOnG ENOuGh!!!**
---
this post is pretty pointless
---
Killer setup! 
---
This, exactly!
---
Strength has shotguns, Perceptions has rifles
---
It's a role playing game you ass and besides lockpicking and repair and hacking etc have always been investments in these games. I have 100% been lockpick guy as i had master before all my friends, and sharing the perk (an amazing idea that nobody seems to mention at all) has meant we can all open level 3 locks throughout the wasteland. Lmao at yourself if you can get past being sweaty in order to just relax and enjoy roleplaying and exploring, what the game is made for. 
---
Very possible. Depending on your definition of "strong" ofc. I run a rifle / shotgun hybrid. My build looks something like this: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=cf21aa5&amp;d=sa2sd2so2sp2pd2pk2pp2pl2pc2ib4ic4a71ar1an2au2lt2l71c50ee0&amp;w=&amp;n=Rifles%20n%27%20shotguns](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=cf21aa5&amp;d=sa2sd2so2sp2pd2pk2pp2pl2pc2ib4ic4a71ar1an2au2lt2l71c50ee0&amp;w=&amp;n=Rifles%20n%27%20shotguns)
---
Its not much fun though, once you have an explosive shotgun. Point it at stuff and stuff dies. zzzzz zzzzzzzz. Im getting rid of mine (which I got legit btw) and speccing into a pure rifle / VATS build. 
---
For other hybrid builds just look for perks and stat arrays that synergies. 
---
Maybe it was a different guy, this guy kept talking about hitting like molerats
---
Maybe things will stabilize today or we'll get a hotfix soon. I was doing some missions and mid-dialogue, the server kept losing connection and eventually kicked me to the main screen. The pipboy issue was annoying because like you said the only way to resolve it (or seems to be the only way) is to quit the server and join again.
---
That‚Äôs the problem, though. It‚Äôs not stuff tailored to their likes some of the time, it‚Äôs stuff tailored to their likes 95% of the time. There was sort of a balance between wacky and realistic stuff to begin with, but now it‚Äôs skewed too far in the wacky direction and shows no signs of letting up. 
---
It was driving me nuts until I figured it out. Now I just lay off the sticks until I'm completely out.
---
atoms are account bound not character bound
---
Then don't swap them out? If your character isnt building to be a lock picker or a hacker then don't use them.
---
It does feel like they don't have any UX designers hired at Bethesda sometimes.
---
Yes please remove all the rpg elements and just give every character hacking and lock pinging for free.
---
This. Mixing up paint jobs is the only path to decent customization now. The twin-tone helmet paint from the Play Time set looks like it could work great in combination with other sets.
---
Good thing that I don't have to decide and waste my atoms now, as this set is not time-limited.
---
If you have the plans craft a bunch of low level ones and then scrap them.  I might be delusional but it seems like there is a much lower chance of learning mods off of them if you don't drop them on the ground and then pick them back up again - so I'd try it that way.  If you don't have the plans they occasionally show up at the Grafton train station.  
---
Very much my favorite gun - someday I will get an instigating one and i will be so - so excited.
---
If they can‚Äôt get a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù right before launch I doubt a PTS server would do any good. 
---
Then what if this is a PTS for an upcoming game
---
I had to trade a bunch of stuff to a friend last night.  This bug is infuriating
---
Lol ok maybe need to hit Whitesprings instead got no messages and would be a waste to go after Queen myself 
---
PC too
---
Your laptop should run it fine... I run the same graphics card albeit on a desktop with more ram but it runs fine on high settings
---
If you really like rifles and shotguns max out both and you‚Äôll be doing crazy damage even without legendary perks, that‚Äôs what I did and I don‚Äôt regret going for a raw damage build one bit
---
There is one that reduces AP cost for Power Attacking, Optimized Bracers IIRC.
---
Then don't build for combat?
---
It's an RPG.
---
Do you expect warriors to have Stealth in wow?
---
Welcome to fallout 76, a community where the devs literally don't give a shit unless what you're doing effects the bottom line...
---
To answer your question, no they haven't banned them. At this point their numbers are so large if they banned them all the player base would collapse. 
---
I had one server session where seemingly a large group was nuking the prime site. Actually stayed in that server for couple of SBQ kills. Was pretty surreal.
---
On PC, there is an odd new loading screen that I guess actually grabs a snapshot of a location instead of storing its picture. When it pops up, the picture shows an incomplete load of whatever is pictured. A building with no walls, off colors, or just something doesn't properly render. But when that pops, I know the game is about to load, so I guess that's an alright thing to happen..?..
---
(XBox)  I went up two more levels in non-nuked Whitesprings last night.  The ghouls still spawn regularly, and the XP isn't so nerfed that it's pointless.  Before the patch I might've leveled up 3 times, so it's not terrible.  
---
Btw WestTek is excellent for level grinding as well.  Legendary drops too, although not as heavily as Nuked Golf Club. 
---
Actually I haven't seen a Nuked WestTek yet.  I may try this tonight and see what happens.
---
Assualtron head, deathclaw hand
---
I have started Teaming up with random players during events because of this, I sometimes team with a few regular game friends, but if they're not on, I simply team with some random that has requested, which always happens cause players are looking for a free FT, and to circumvent the server issues.
---
So I should purposely use crappy weapons to make the game not boring? GREAT GAME DESIGN BETH!!!! 
---
Yes that could be, it means almost the same as me and has the same email address except the ending. Only he is not alive in the household of me and owns an Xbox one and I have an xbox one x. I have nothing to do with my brother, he only came to me because Bethesda did not seem to respond to his answer. I then suggested to him that I open a ticket through my account to inform Bethesda about the open ticket. Since Bethesda, with no evidence or credibility, also banned my account, I will not receive an answer. The invariably ignore all responses from banned players. The deducting such a number is already a big thing. I do not even have my Creations club points and the purchased Skyrim and Fallout 4 content anymore. Alone, the spell on local game predecessor and their content purchased there, is absolutely not according to the terms and conditions or contractual agreements, which I have assumed.
---
Could you give me a hint on how to get to Bethesda, so that you can take it from me and I can explain it to you? I've always been behind Bethesda. But that's what subtracts me, throws me in a pretty big hole. pure disappointment :( 
---
Cool, another shitpost. Just what I wanted!
---
Silly.... Silly never changes...
---
Tryed for days now mate still broken!!
---
I have cards for like 20 something levels I haven't bothered picking lol. I really hope they implement some way of managing perks at some point. 
---
Yea I guess so. The page was full of people selling and trading shit in astronomical proportions. Damn I just want to play the game and hope to never come across these kinda people. So far so good. Fingers crossed.
---
Nice, I'll just keep doing what I'm doing.
---
Just love shooting from a distance and if things get 2 close and personal I use my 2 different kinds of shot gun and and normally 1 round kills them off.
---
I don't do too bad at the gold course with me shotguns.
---
How many guns do you carry?
---
I'm got 2 shotguns and 1 rifle.
---
I just tend to run out of shotgun ammo rather quickly but got lots of plastic at the moment 
---
ok, good to know, but still starting another character, and all this grind... No, not for me, at least for now...
---
And the assaultron circuit board too iirc.   It‚Äôs needed for the blade. 
---
Love and comfort, friend.  I lost my father to cancer 4 years ago.  I wish I could tell you the grief goes away, but I can't.  It does, however, get easier to bear over time.  Remember the good times you and he shared and he will be in your heart always.

This does not affect your game progress I had 3-4 blue screens average everytime I logged on after completing the above steps I haven't had a single one and my player was exactly where I left him I did not lose any progress.
---
FYI I did this a few weeks ago it works!!
---
Omg I'm not the only one. This has been driving me INSANE!
---
This is my current situation as well. I occasionally put the PA back on just to remind myself how much more accurate heavy weapons are with perk, and how much the PA limitation annoys me.
---
Are you able to confirm this? I have the BOS mod for chest, arms and legs, but have no option to apply any paint to the helmet.
---
I also found the lever rifle plan at Grafton station and I was way past level 50.
---
You're being downvoted because **NO ONE** wants items sold there that effect gameplay. Do you not see how bad that is? Paying to win is not a good thing.
---
Not really a plethora though
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the game is going to be glitchy and crash until: all duping methods are ended, and all the absurd stashes are gone. Those two things might not ever be resolved so it‚Äôs really up to you if you want to roll the dice üé≤ 
---
I don't care that you don't care. Your move?
---
TSEs aren't the problem, its bobblehead dupers.  The ability to stack them is going to be stopped in the next patch.  TSEs have been effectively nerfed in this patch from being OP in PVP with the ability to build your character to negate all explosive damage.
---
All the tech data I collected pre that quest did not count
---
Cheers bro. Appreciate ur reply. See you soon at the nuke world hopefully
---
Imagine that outfit + a room filled with lockers. THANK YOU SIR!
---
Only argument I have against that is there are allot of people that have hundreds of hours in this game and have multiple characters and I don't dupe but I have a mule character that I've moved a bunch of legendary armour pices idk if I'll use, a crap ton of ammo and junk and yeah if I leveled up so I could get weight redition perks on him he wouldn't weight 3k but then people could kill new and take the junk, and yeah I know it's not the intended way to play but with the limited stash I'm sure I'm not the only one
---
Was it since the most recent patch? Because you can now get up to 105% explosive resistance plus he has the buff from not initiating pvp. Those two combined equals either not taking damage or barely taking it.
---
Hacker 3 turns off the turrets in the silos and Picklock 3 lets you skip a room in there altogether, so I swap those cards in during nuke runs.
---
Check the cliff behind the Red Rocket Mega Stop. There's a path to the cliff down the road a little west, it'll lead you right to a nice big open clearing next to the cliff's edge. It's big enough for two camps and there's a lightly wooded area just north of it that you could fit a 3rd in if you've got teammates. It has a slight slope to it but it's still my favorite spot so far.
---
Lol.  So 25% chance of death with each trigger pull huh? 
---
Yeah I can perfectly understand you. I won't restart a new character for sure cause I've already 2 100+ but on the bugged one (the main) I simply leave the situation at that point. I mean I already builded the "chassis" of the main building. I have the fusion generator and water purifier with all the working station a stash and a bed. When they fix I'll go to decorate it. Atm I just play the game just hoping that they hotfix fast or something. I'm 140 but 30% is too fucking much. Just sad as you precisely cause when a fallout player decide to build something new in a new location with new ideas you have to build. You want to build. It's kinda a ritual. It's holy. This bug is the most frustrating one since the start. Can I ask you to write me if you know something new? Their answer or anything else? I don't send a ticket cause I don't think they can't fix it for a single account. But if they can I'll send it too. Btw If I have news I'll write you too. Let's prey!
---
This and nobody mentions the perk sharing either, which is a fantastic and creative addition to the perk system. Me and my friends habe gone through our perks and decided who can provide what bonuses when we squad up. People bashing this perk system are baffling me, it's amazingly well put together in my opinion. But that seems to be the thing with this game, find something to whinge about. 
---
Oh none said it was there to make the game better :)
---
Hey, quick question is there a ‚Äúlog off‚Äù button in 76 because I can‚Äôt find one.
---
That‚Äôs the sound that plays for me whenever I encounter and approach a lurking Mothman, only for it to blast up into the sky at warp speed in a cloud of black fog. I think its instance after you killed it may have been a bug - or there happened to be two Mothmen in the vicinity, one a lurker and the other vengeful, and the former flew away when you killed the latter.
---
That's what everybody thinks. 
---
"Luck is a measure of your general good fortune..." 
---
I can really only go off my own personal experience. 
---
Happened to me aswell. Outside Watoga High School, 2 crashes. The third time i could move away from that place and played for like 1 hour and crashed again. This was the first time in this game that i actually turned the console off with rage.
---
There were 3 nukes launch on prime last night on the server I was in.  Never crashed.  
---
Unfortunately I was too slow for the first queen and the second didn't give me credit for hitting it.
---
The downvote fairies are in full force but its the same for me on XBOX One X. Every couple loads the game goes to an eternal loading screen. Game fully freezes every 15 minutes or so. I have a couple hundred hours in this game and feel like I got my moneys worth, but Im happy to move on to the new games coming out soon. 
---
This option exists from the Social menu. You can choose any one of your online friends from the first tab and select "join."
---
Bizarrely so - you can put hearts, stars, diamonds after item names, but I have to look for the word ‚Äútea‚Äù to know if I can drink it... the most junior coder could solve this.
---
Indeed it does. I have played with a guy several times that has it. 
---
I honestly level up when I can be bothered it's a ball ache anyways to readjust everything, wish it was like the old style.
---
Saveable, swappable presets are a great idea
---
Not possible to reset, but you can just keep picking the same ones. The game will keep letting you pick them until you have enough of a particular perk to have one of each level. For example with a three level card, you can pick 6 total allowing for a level 1, level 2, and level 3 card. 
---
God what an actual baby.
---
You do realise you can repair your camp for a minimal amount of resources, right?
---
I appreciate the kind words. Thank you x
---
Paintings covering doorways! A Minecraft classic.
---
Also with what did you form the 'bar'?
---
There was a video showing the developer room with plans for every single item. There was no ultracite jetpack there, so I don‚Äôt think it exists
---
Do you get a bounty from that or is a 3rd hand death since it was indirect damage?
---
Punji board?
---
The best place I've found to get mutations is Blackwater mine (where Uranium fever event is held)
---
When you go in there are radiactive drums stand next to them to collect rads very fast. Then head over to the right of where you entered and there is a decontamination shower to remove the rads.
---
Server hop when you get a mutation so you can get another one just don't forget to keep swapping in and out starched genes perk
---
Commies are evolving
---
Thank you i was starting to lose hope but I'll keep trying for the queen and pray for rng jesus
---
I like inventory management, always been a big part of the game for me. Never thought of it as an issue, it's a bethesda game lol..
---
I‚Äôm partial to the tuxedos, myself, for that clean look. 
---
I have looked at the decompilec anticheat "detect" code. 90+% of the flags are directly related to common cheating programs. Ba2 based "glowing" cheats are not going to register as of the most recent PC  ersion, much less get someone banned.
---
put all but one in ur stash, then put one in a open world container wait a few secs and take it out again.
---
No he's exaggerating completely. Just an explosive modifier is not *that* strong.
---
That‚Äôs mine too but my character lol
---
I see I'll have to check that out
---
Wow, that's interesting and a bit disconcerting and misleading.  Not the information in post, but the mod itself is a bit misleading.  Who plays anymore with non-modded weapons???    
---
Weightless Weapons would be pointless.
---
You can usually place that type of purifier on a cliff's edge. I have 2 on mine, just rotate it till you find the green sweet spot. 
---
I‚Äôm curious to try an anti armor explosive gat on the queen to see if it‚Äôll help
---
With stabilized I‚Äôll have 95% armor pen
---
Half brick wall for the lowered ceiling and then then 3 short book cases in an L shape to form the farm.
---
Hmm...is this on all the bright mods? If so I have a hard hat i need to test (had it because my excavator PA set had a crap light (before the patch)
---
The thing is, this stuff is very much data-driven. You see people here going ‚ÄúI‚Äôd buy this or that instead‚Äù, but if they *actually* did, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd get. 
---
I have the same question, I bought the deep pocketed mod thinking it would give me more carry weight but only gave me 10 extra. 
---
I'm still not seeing the benefit of the Karma?   I know they are there, I can see them on others, but I never pay attention to them really.   I pay attention to the content and context of information provided by the poster.
---
Who cares if someone has been posting mediocre information on the boards for 3 months... When a newcomer posts extraordinary posts only 3 times?  I much prefer the quality post.
---
When I first started I kept only a pump and a hunting rifle just because 308 ammo and shells are easy for the level you‚Äôre at. Eventually when I realized I had an abundance of .45 I picked up a combat rifle (you‚Äôll want one of these too for sniping but it can wait until max level) but I‚Äôd say carry 1 shotgun 2 rifles and pick up some fun melee weapons to mess around with to clean up low levels when you don‚Äôt want to waste ammo. I recommend the double barrel and the pump just bc a combat shotty seems to burn more ammo than I‚Äôd like it to 
---
No. Kill them.
---
Might work I think it will take a percent of a percent not sure that it adds little that
---
THIS! I despise those gutsys -_-
---
Enjoy your 17 2mm rounds and 3 stimpaks. Or maybe that's just what I get 19 out of 20 times.
---
I played for about 7 hours after the update without any crashes. 
---
Middle mountain cabins usually has about 4 they spawn on the sides of every cabin
---
When I fast travel to my CAMP I always spawn on a firecracker berry bush and take damages. Does that count? 
---
lol.  I tried to think of all the "Dear Bethesda" posts made and cannot really think of any that were important, just like you stated.
---
I essentially never crash, but I did at the SBQ last night ü§î not that that constitutes much evidence but it suggests it got worse.
---
If you could keep getting perks ad infinitum, by level 100 every single player build in the game would ne exactly the same. That sounds so fucking boring, seriously. I actually disliked that you could keep acquiring perks forever in FO4, made the whole thing see, less valuable. Bobbleheads should be rarer and last for 24h, other than that i'm fine with them.  
---
I remember someone at some point had Super Mutant Behemoth Stomp thing item in inventory. So I assume ability to self destruct is kind of inventory weapon you can use and somehow spawn with it (looking at you non-legendary mobs that dropped legendary item)
---
I have about the same time and have no TSE drops.  Only 2 Explosive drops that were not worth keeping.
---
I always pick the banjo. Maybe this is why I don't think they synch up. 
---
Problem isn‚Äôt end game guns. The real issue is there is nothing to use them on. We have one true end game boss that isn‚Äôt even that much fun to fight. 
---
I have killed myself with TSE weapons more then any mob has. There is no real challenge to the game right now. That‚Äôs the problem. 
---
Here comes a lvl 95 death claw... two power attacks in a melee build and its dead. 
---
Why can I level up or combine hacker or lockpick? Just makes it even more tedious. They had good leveling systems in the previous installments. Why change something that works well? 
---
I could understand if there were classes or load outs so to speak. Quick click from solo to coop. 
---
I just don‚Äôt get it. If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it. 
---
I frequently been stuck at work benches unable to leave without logging off :(
---
I'd do 2.5 k for the plans. Think I have one on each of my characters in ln have to double check when I can get back on. My PSN is VikrimRay
---
I'm level 130 something and have built my camp where the ~~glorious~~ infamous murder oven of legend was built.
---
Built a nice, welcoming, cabin with all the workbenches, a decon shower, some musical instruments, etc. A nice garden in back and a pair of industrial purifiers top it off. Low-levels won't come near me.
---
I'm not wearing some silly outfit or anything or trouncing around in intimidating power armor. I'm just in the hunters coat and cowboy hat.
---
I always offer up some healing items, food, and a level appropriate crafted weapon to any lowbie that stops by. I'm just a friendly merchant, not a psycho killer, but they don't seem to get that.
---
Same I prejudged it thinking it was going to be absolutely amazing. I play the BETA and the graphics are janky af. The scenery is alright but goodness forbid you get a close look at something in the environment. 
---
No NPCs and just a rag tag bunch of ghost chasing quests. If I wanted to read a book I would do so. Imagine watching a movie and the movie is just a bunch of text on the screen for everyone to read with the occasional action scene and some audiotapes. Hard pass.
---
Am I missing something? I don't see a "surveillance room" or "peepholes" in any of the pics. 
---
They did copy a couple of bits over. There was another BS controversy about BGS "*making gamers pay for items they already purchased in FO4*". Was even posted to this sub with the shitty articles I think.
---
Oh and daily reminder for everybody: atom points are free. Nobody is making anybody pay. "I don't play enough to earn enough atoms to get everything"... well I didn't play Wolfenstein enough to earn fighting the final boss. Why is the boss restricted content and stopping me from accessing it?
---
I found the game has been way more stable since the update, hopefully the do a hot fix for people affected like you.
---
There are soooo many different geometric layouts you can make with walls &amp; rooves that the whole "object is colliding with another" needs reworking. Sometimes it's just straight up wrong, but on the other hand you can place flat roof directly inside an identical piece...
---
Combat armor 
---
Did you go to that link? If you had then you would know that it was a joke my dude.
---
.....and?
---
Sweet, I've got a few of those in my stash box
---
I actually have a cool melee weapon it's a spipked snow ski sword.
---
Damage is at 68 at the moment.
---
I always forgot use I tho and end up blasting low levels with my shotgun.
---
I'll have to try and remeber use sword for low levels.
---
Thanks for the tips. 
---
Keep seeing this in PC, too...
---
Never running low on stimpaks, though. Never needed em more than when I started launching nukes lol.
---
Right might be 75
---
Why do my guns take multiple long sessions before even come close to breaking? I only have gunsmith. Melee users aren't required to take gunsmith at all btw..
---
Well that's unexpectedly wholesome. Most people who don't have the game just tell about how terrible it is.
---
Yesterday after work, I was only able to play about 2.5 hours due to adulting. In that span, my Xbox One X crashed to home 8-9 times, completely quitting the game. 6 times, the game completely froze, and I had to force quit back to home. 1 time, the game froze while making a weird buzzing noise, and it made my Xbox completely shut off!! OFF!!
---
That reduced weight is a God send. That thing weighs a shit ton normally. 
---
Nice pipe pistol
---
Oh well that's a bit hacky but thanks
---
Blizzard management understand and shells out for PTS and general quality control, contrary to BGS management.
---
The current dupe method is going to be really hard for them to fix. 
---
At this point you can blame Bethesda, they put bandaids on something that needed stitches. There are many ways to DC from a server so I‚Äôm afraid there is no end in sight.!
---
Still really good then get some heavy gunner perks for more armor piercing could get up to 90%
---
Im gonna make my own youtube channel and make my own top 10 best games of 2018 and FO76 is gonna be on the list. /s
---
Why both rifles?  The weight with carrying two rifles are quite high!
---
I assume you got Handmade on auto?
---
Yeah, that is the shit part for sure. This place is kinda hard to stumble upon.
---
That, pretty much by fucking definition, isn‚Äôt ‚Äúworking‚Äù.
---
And some people complain about not having a large enough build budget...
---
That's a pretty awesomely decked out house. It's cute how you labelled the individual containers. Hopefully someday it'll be more than just a waste of build budget.
---
This person has their priorities straight! Extra 10 Carry weight FTW
---
I don‚Äôt think they patched it but use a skip method. Any indoor area with turrets on the ceiling and a shelf under can get you ontop of the map.
---
Same.  It's possible it's just the more populated areas where the high level players hang out?  Not one crash or disconnect since the patch.
---
Yes! AND they removed Bear Arms from affecting it, so now it's no good without weight reduction. 
---
I have found that most players in Fallout 76 are friendly and helpful. 
---
Making sure everyone gets a shot on a legendary is one one the best deeds you can do.
---
Lol grats, yesterday I launched my first nuke at lvl ~90 with my friend (After some tries where we got disconnected), and after trying to leave with the emergency exit my whole game got stuck in a loading screen and I had to restart the game... oh well.
---
I got calibrated shocks the other day from queen so I know at least that other mods besides knuckles and vents drop from queen!
---
When OP doesn‚Äôt understand that Bethesda would never be willing to pay for this and that‚Äôs the point you‚Äôre trying to make
---
I despise those trenches! What was that designer thinking when they added those &gt;&lt;
---
I'll have to try it out.  I thought I tried it but I didnt try in all the areas of the cliff edge.  Would make it a lot easier to manage that way.
---
It still does slap damage because they're your mines. But it blows them away.
---
Semi-auto is still Rifleman.  
---
Only the Auto receivers are commando.  Like handmade falls under Semi auto rifle for crafting but my rifleman perks work fine on it for semi-auto.
---
I will have to get commando perks for it, if I change the receiver to powerful auto.
---
Probably a typo in the records somewhere.
---
They must of fucked up this "rarely online" model as well, because it's been bugging so hard for me I've only been booted off once, for SCHEDULED maintenance. Can you believe it? 
---
I knew about it for days in advance and planned to not be in the middle of anything, but that is no excuse for maintaining your servers Bethesda! 
---
You should be ashamed. 
---
I would be happy finding a Furious Handmade.  I thought I did once when an event gave me a handmade and a furious rolling pin.   Usually you see the item reward without Legendary effects, then a note pops on screen with lendary effect.   So saw handmade and rolling pin, then saw the furious popup.
---
Not only did they pop my happiness-baloon, they shot a hyper-velocity harpoon through the thing.
---
It looks like a dick, peeking out from its foreskin
---
Yeah. I hope to find one of these. Then I'd start getting the perks for an explosive and pyro build. 
---
Pipe pistol is also BIS... j.k. it was a 3\* with +250 damage reduction during reload, I thought maybe I could use it as a def buff during bagel bombs 
---
Obviously built really well then, aren't they!
---
indeed it is.
---
No really, where is it? I want to see.
---
Two Shot Exploding BB's would be too OP. Especially with a supressor.
---
Dupers have not been banned. The only people who have been banned are either those who have been using cheatengine, or those who posted their duping to youtube or have maybe been reported in game by a player with video evidence.
---
If there is a massive banwave we will definitely hear about it from Bethesda since they will want people to know they did something about the dupers. Most dupers think there is "nothing" Bethesda can do, but thats just stupid. If you have 10,000 bobbleheads, that information is stored on servers Bethesda controls. If you think its impossible for them to figure out who has these items and ban them... you are delusional. Its just a matter of IF they will do anything and WHEN. Who knows?
---
I don't even pick locks or hack doors anymore. When this game first came out I said those should be passive perks, and I still stand by that.
---
I had heard that friendly mothmen are a bug so maybe it was meant to fly off but didn't and the sound still played?
---
Ether way I'll be researching it but thank you for the info
---
I did as well, so I grabbed it.
---
Usually it's whatever drug epidemic is on the rise being blamed for crime. Please link an article for "local council/policy force blamed for rise in crime" because I've legit never read about that except for possibly exposed corruption cases
---
Hopefully you mean Ammosmith + Super Duper...
---
I just found this out recently, traded for a TSE Handmade and went to nuked whitesprings. The one hit kills only dropped one item :(
---
Jesus Christ, I just realized my C.A.M.P. is driftwood shack trash. Good job! 
---
Done this earlier today but I still blue screen every 2-3 minutes after spawning.
---
I paid $60 and this mess of a game is what I get? I have very right to glitch not my fault they don‚Äôt have their shit together 
---
I guess it's somewhat gun dependent. Automatic guns and flamers break faster. Plasma Gatling guns will break fast, but a regular gatling will last awhile. A hunting rifle or gauss rifle will last awhile.
---
Ive also been blasting scorched and the sbq and high lvl yags and gulpers etc lately so that all take tons of ammo fast so that obv shortens lifespans of guns.
---
I made an update post: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afb11c/i_got_the_complete_responder_fireman_uniform
---
I never got the drop and I am as frustrated as you are. I think these cosmetics are not farmable. I had to trade for the uniform.
---
Oh they get it ruins the market for everyone else except themselves.
---
I've actually been noticing this glitch every time I melee VATS up the turrets. But I didn't think to skip the area like that! Will take note next time I go through it.
---
However, I gain like 1-2 levels from clearing the area and stock up on junk when I'm low.
---
There are some reports but doesn't seem to be THAT widespread in terms of banning. I imagine there would be a lot more whinging "it wasn't me, honest" kinda posts.
---
Or the people on the Facebook page were boasting and full of shit. It is the internet afterall... :)
---
Well, it's not a secret room any more.
---
I haven't run into that issue, but I have went to craft something and the crafting menu never popped up at my camp, but it did at least let me leave the bench.
---
I actually have an instigating explosive flame thrower... I've managed to use it without dying 3 times out of 6. It melts everything though, so if I run backwards it's sorta good. 
---
The only forms of obtaining armor piercing is the 
---
Stabilized perk
---
And the legendary effect
---
I‚Äôm not sure if there are any more forms for heavy weapons seeing I‚Äôll be using my Gatling gun
---
That sucks check Bethesda support they have a few fixes I havn't tried
---
I don't get why he dropped the bag? Wouldn't he want to hold inventory and raise prices b/c it is harder again to dupe?
---
Another moaning mini post or in this case moaning minion. If you're not good enough for the challenge then don't bother complaining
---
Couple of issues on XBox1
---
First i came across an issue with unyielding armour. While i was high rads, my current weight increased with the maximum weight limit. Than after removing the rads it reduced my strength to -13.  Current weight stayed the same
---
Also had the issue of disappearing mods, both from inventory and stash. Believe i lost the mod in my inventory while fast traveling, as i didn‚Äôt have any disconnects tonight. As for stash i‚Äôm guessing the update
---
As well as the disappearing ‚Äúbag‚Äù after i dropped some armour, wouldn‚Äôt have been in issue but it lagged an than proceeded to drop my under armour as well. Can i suggest removing the ability to ‚Äúdrop‚Äù equipt armour with out a warning or asking for confirmation.
---
You can compensate for luck with effort, just do it 1000 more times
---
Nice photo, although I personally don't trust these gnomes ( that and the manequins)  around the wastes.
---
They appear in strange places, often holding weapons, a bit unnerving if you ask me lol. 
---
Do you have other rare PA plans? I won't sell them that cheap - shocks &amp; jetpacks are pretty rare &amp; expensive
---
Sounds cool. Next on my list of things to find is a TSE handmade or a TSE gatling gun.
---
I had an odd thing where i could not longer jump higher with it on lol.   However equipping and unequipping semeed to fix it?  I'm not sure what was going on xD
---
On Xbox, I have found that using the Trigger will let it stop at 0, while buttons and pad won't.
---
Doesn‚Äôt the event normally run like 30 minutes?
---
So you had people sitting in the shed for 30 minutes straight?!
---
Same problem on PC......
---
I'm a maxed agility/luck VATS pistols and shotguns build. 
---
Pretty fun, pistols are light and longer range and my shotguns essentially auto-cripple (enforcer) and do pretty decent damage. 
---
Starched genes. It‚Äôs under luck. If you have it level two, radaway won‚Äôt remove the mutation. 
---
Some guy here ran some tests a while ago and it turned out that PA and hazmat suits have a hidden modifier that prevents radiation damage MUCH more effective than the same amount of rad-resistance (that you see in your pip-boy) stacked on your char with none of these suits. It doesn't help to have 500/1000/5000 rad-resist, you still can't effectively survive in a nuke zone without Hazmat/PA. The number I remember from their post was around 35000 rad resistance that is equal to what you get while wearing these suits. And other than in the nukezones rad-resistance is almost useless anyway.
---
So yeah, 50 additional RR is a mere joke, not worth any hassle. Like at all. What were the devs actually thinking when they made this event?
---
How do you have the camp budget for that? Are you at max at level 80?
---
Oh ya, ski swords are what I was using back then too since they spawn pretty much anywhere that has skis (all of Appalachia basically) also remember to scrap your weapons before condition runs out, you can get better mods for them and eventually a hardened receiver which will help you boost that damage some more. And no problem that‚Äôs what the sub is for haha
---
You need a Facebook account to see the link and then it's in Polish. Care to translate the gobbledegook
---
literally in the imgur link with comments....
---
hmmm i let everyone get a hit on the legendary but no way am I letting my armor get messed up from the small ones. I don't hog them but I'm not just gonna stand there either. 
---
Literally went through it twice.......
---
I'm laughing with tears coming out of my eyes, knowing modders put in a recipe checklist in the game before bethesda. God they are so incompetent not including such a basic quality of life thing. 
---
The amount of times I've been trying to drop plans and resources for low levels, furiously emoting and shooting at the bag on the ground, only for them to look at me like I'm insane or trying to kill them and them consequently running away.  
---
I'm a non-TSE owning high-level, I wouldn't be able to kill you even if I wanted to, just accept my bloody gifts, for crying out loud! 
---
For most weapons it is quite poor effect.
---
But unmodded missile launcher, 40mm auto granade or fat man is fairly okay, and weighless version of those allow you to keep them to use the occasional ammo you can find.
---
Skills made so much more sense.  They need to go back to those days.
---
It‚Äôs relevant because I‚Äôm doing end game stuff and don‚Äôt need even 1000 weight to get by. 100k is insane and taking hoarding to an extreme.. Sorry to say you can still play the game and hoard stuff without needing to hold 100,000 lbs of junk you are never going to use, especially if it‚Äôs putting a strain on servers when you load in. 
---
The best is when it's on a comment that's, like, 40 minutes old and only has a score of 0 or -1. Like, you've been downvoted *twice.* That's not a conspiracy.
---
I only have a player-made Handmade and I attend the SBQ battles, but I am level 120 with all perks centered toward Rifleman.
---
No I dont do massive amounts of damage the Plasma Gatling or TSE or Auto Grenade Rifle can do, but I feel that the SBQ is meant to be fought with all builds and not exlusive few or those very rare people who have legit TSE.  
---
That would be huge design flaw with the battle.
---
Some MMO actually have damage or contribution rankings of boss battles popup afterwards.  Something like that would be neat, especially if the top 3 positions got like 100 caps.   May not seem much but would be fun.  I doubt I would ever get that though unless I got better guns.
---
I never accept random team invites for that reason. My camp is well hidden and there are too many trolls on XB1. 
---
Literally who?
---
I've played over 200 hours and enjoyed myself, I got my $AUD50 for it. 
---
Is it worth it for 10 bucks? Yes. 
---
Same here. Often people gives the queen 1 shot for exp and then crawling away. It sucks 
---
See this game needs more stuff like that. We can repair the power plants so what if they added additional repair quests? Get a team and repair all 3 nuclear power plants and get a major reward. Then once that's done quests like clear out and rebuild such and such power relay station. Course I suppose it'd make more of a difference were there actual people still alive. Still, future DLC content maybe?
---
God, I love the perk loadout mod
---
Ways to fix....
---
-skill point lock certain skills example: science master req: 15 intelligence. ( you can then buff it to make energy weapons viable: add 5% energy weapon damage or something. Example math here)
---
-increase loot pool to add legendaries behind lvl 3 locks/hacks. Makes taking the skills costly but effective.
---
-only allow card respecs upon level up or alternatively only available at c.a.m.p. tool for increasing cap cost( lowered by each level up not used) with a cap of say 1k caps? Idk actual numbers here. 
---
Ideas?
---
You can‚Äôt really tag a sbq and hide. The more people the more hp the sbq has. If people notice too many people not pulling their weight they leave and no one gets anything. Just do white springs until you lvl up, that dose not spoil anyone‚Äôs work
---
Rumour had it bethesda were banning accounts blah blah and this guy wasn't muling on a level 3 character. A lot of people on LFG were saying to get rid off stuff before the update and maybe this guy spooked and dropped. Buttttt I guess it doesn't matter cos everyone kept their stuff and pretty sure people are still duping post update. LFG prices have gone back up. Bethesda just haven't sorted it. 
---
You are actually the first one to mention this. Whitesprings for me falls in the appalachia territory, so beginners terrain. Little east and south of the pure beginner territory. Am I that wrong? 
---
Out of Vault76 I went the east route and ended up at the top of the world at level 7 or 8. The mobs there were not that hard to kill and I could finish the missions pretty easily without getting into a pissing contest with the monsters.
---
It's only when there's players 20 levels above me that stuff gets impossible to shoot. And that includes the beginner missions at the airport as well. 
---
Am I out of place at the whitespring golf resort? Very possible, i'll admit. But when i'm fresh out of the vault and following the mission path and i'm unable to kill monsters at my third mission point because of monsters 10 levels above me spawning, something is wrong. When I want to level, but have to server hop because there's lvl100+ players everywhere I go that either want to grief me or spawn monsters so high I can't dent them then I say something has gone wrong in the zoning. 
---
I'm starting to think i'd be better off in the mire with my friend because there never seem to be players there. Sure, the mirelurk queen will take a while to kill but at least I won't be bothered by level 60 scorched continuously.
---
Ah, thanks
---
I just tested this out, with Fusion Cores. I crafted one with 18 Int and ended it up with a core at 117 (so this should confirm, that it is Int minus the base one that gets added to the CND.  
---
When I loaded the core into a Gatling Laser (with rank two Power User - +60%), it gave me a rather odd number of  943, when doing the math, it should be 936 (117\*5\*1.6).  
---
Also, as a side note, don't use these in PA, as it will remove the extra duration, from the core.
---
Submitted the ticket and haven't heard a word back from them. Apparently the other person still has access to their character as they leveled up. Sent in another support ticket today
---
One of the funniest bug I encountered was legendary ghouls exploding after their death like they were robots. It only happened once several weeks ago so it is probably patched now... unless they were some kind of whisperers synths (cf The walking dead). 
---
Oh thought you were talking about a mod on the gun 
---
Yes I‚Äôm definitely complaining, absolutely, I don‚Äôt have ammo to burn and I want those that don‚Äôt realise to know that the health scales with the number of players present, and what they are doing is not harmless, it‚Äôs not a question of skill or not being good enough if there‚Äôs only 2 of you engaging, that‚Äôs the whole point, I‚Äôve taken down SBQ‚Äôs before and I will again but it‚Äôs always gone more smoothly when everyone there is making an effort.
---
It also has the chance to reward a plan like lining for the BoS underarmors or power armor paint.
---
The Quiet ManÔªø
---
I would agree. I played the game for a month before I found out what it was. And that was only because people here we saying that nobody plays.
---
Shush! You'll get flagged!
---
The only plans I have other than previously mentioned are the ultracite explosive vent
---
Are the Western Revolvers that different than the Revolvers?
---
Where's papa-shekels, he was the number one captain of disinformation floating around the reddit " accept the dev room items, bethesda won't do anything TRUST ME"
---
Yea well I feel his pain. I dumped over 1000 Gatling rounds into the scorchbeast queen I know I at least took away half her health alone. So I was hoping the other 10-15 players could finish her off
---
Words of advice
---
1. Shotguns are absolute garbage against her If she has. High resistance
---
2. If you know you can‚Äôt hurt her be a pal and keep the deathclaws, sloths, other scorchbeasts, crickets, Yao gui, and other sorts of aggravations off the players who can actually kill her. Some people go for furious/ bloodied builds which require enemies to not ruin their momentum.
---
3. This is the only fight in the game that requires actual teamwork ‚Äúunless your some ass with bobbleheads‚Äù
---
So help your mates out. 
---
How often has the game crashed before this update? 
---
"Quality of life"? Spend more time managing inventory and perk cards then actually having endgame content to play...
---
I found a 3 star cryolator with explosive.   Explain \*that\* one.
---
Fun fact: it also doesn‚Äôt go past the max
---
Agreed... I can't tell you how many times I pulled the trigger and realized Chemist, Weapon Artisan, all 3 lock picks, Super Duper, Ammosmith and/or others were still in place.
---
Synth, radroach model 1
---
I would be happy if TSE were flat removed from the game. 
---
Still, there wouldn't be any need it it if they made crafting/utility perks passive in the first place...
---
Yes, all the time.  For extra fun, I had a legendary radrat explode on me yesterday, lol.  That was fun.
---
I've gotten this error message for every massive game I've played on my PS4. FO4, Witcher 3, GTA V, etc. I've done everything from uninstalling and reinstalling the games, but the crashes still come.
---
Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same.
---
You'd think stacked bobble heads would be removed from the game ASAP. Nope.
---
Yes, I think I go through about 1500 ammo for my semi-auto handmade.   Pretty sure my accuracy is high, I VATS snipe when I got AP during flights, clean roaming mobs between AP regen.   Then unload on her when landed.  So not really wasting bullets much.
---
No, don't drop them.
---
Lmao online for 15 minute bursts. 
---
Account banning has come for you dupers, and bethesda is its ShrooouudD
---
I didn't know more technical data changes the rewards.. I thought the extra data I've picked up just vanished into thin air, it doesn't show more than one in my inventory. :\
---
Sounds like Dense mod on the center torso would help alot...
---
It‚Äôs 75% Armor pen, I‚Äôve tested this.
---
The rule of thumb is for semi-automatic weapons, anti armor is better. For automatic weapons, two shot is better. 
---
It would be one HECK of a long list if they listed all the known issues. Currently, and in foreseeable future, they might as well say "Known issue: Fallout 76". I don't blame them for not doing the list.
---
Couldn't agree more, you found exactly the right words.
---
If I hear anything I'll let you know for sure!
---
I totally concur. I mean I get it, you want to be a hacker you'll have to sacrifice some of your dps cards or whatever. However let's just be real when anyone comes across a safe/terminal we just swap perks, it's just annoying and tedious. We need passive perk slots. 
---
My Counter Argument:  More Fortnight in Atomic Shop, More Fallout in Base Game
---
I do it for them thicc treasure maps you can find in them, personally
---
for sure, i run melee/rifle build, 3 perk cards for each and youre set to go
---
I mean I use a rifle and unarmed weapons like the deathclaw gauntlet 
---
It's not about the justice, I personaly don't have any of the above, it's just that some uninformed people TRADED for these and can get banned.
---
This. Welcome to the end-game, where your biggest enemy is not those that you face in combat but those around you and your own game /server stability.
---
is LFG like a discord? I keep seeing people mention it, but I only know the acronym for actual in game stuff, like running a dungeon. 
---
I've said from day one that combat and non combat cards should have different "stacks".  They can still abide by the same rules but having to have one or the other makes no sense, it doesn't impact how you play the game it's just negative on the quality of life.
---
I feel like the play time update was a commentary on the community "I don't care if its against the rules, I WANT MY TOYS NOW &gt;:("
---
Compare that 1500 rounds to using it through the rest of the game. How long would that ammo last you just going through a side quest or taking/defending a workshop. Hell, I only plug about 500 rounds at a Whitesprings nuke if I'm being trigger happy. Just saying, she is spongier than spongebob. 
---
Yes the same i have many more crashes after the patch . 
---
Fuck Bethesda! This is blatant disrespect and they obviously don't care. I won't be buying another product fun them until this garbage shell of a game is fixed
---
I honestly think its less about having a big build budget and more about people trying to cram everything in to the camp. OP has a single water purifier (the concrete foundation ones) and zero turrets. Most people try to throw in a few purifiers and 1-2 turrets for protection, which can easily take up around 40-50% of the budget.
---
I stopped keeping Hacker active and just use those points to keep Gunsmith and Makeshift Warrior active all the time at the same time so my weapons last longer in the field.  Haven‚Äôt needed to swap out for Hacker in quite a while.  Lockpicking, on the other hand, I constantly use to open doors, safes, and the like.  INT of 12.  Lets me keep Batteries Included and one other level one perk active at all times.
---
I actually started investing in lower levels of perks I‚Äôve maxed out to see the difference in my build and what is tolerable in the field.
---
It sucks when someone actually comes up with sources while you have nothing but hot air, doesn't it?
---
you get the option to move one perk point every level after 50
---
Unfortunately they only engaged for the first 5-10 mins then when the only other gun I could hear was a TSE shotgun I thought oh maybe they are melee builds and continued to focus fire on the wings to force her to land, she lands and it‚Äôs just me and the stranger with the TSE shotgun attacking her so once she launched into the air again I checked the mini map and there was a cluster of 4 in the shed behind me, I went in the door and there‚Äôs 2 right at the back, 2 standing in front of them shooting anything that came in the door, queen lands again and still they don‚Äôt come out. The event is 30 mins which always flies by for me but it must be pretty boring spending 30 mins in a shed but that‚Äôs what they seemed to want to do, my mind boggles lol
---
Not available for us console plebs :'(
---
willfully ignorant people.
---
You might find you have ‚Äúpockets‚Äù or ‚Äúdeep pockets‚Äù mods to your armour. They no longer count to your carry weight when you equip power armour. 
---
Looking for Group. People just advertise there, filtered in between dungeon running, new players asking for help and someone typically in need of screws/springs/adhesive. 
---
sry I have those too :/ the plans I offered are pretty rare but if you want some random PA pkans just farm treasure maps slowly ;)
---
Now we wait while people duplicate the items and trade them all over the place. Another delay on CS and releasing new content. Sigh...
---
Great advice üëç
---
Whitesprings is definitely a low level are, it's area quest kill feral golfer ghouls can't even be completed when high level people. Unfortunately it's in the Savage divide region, so the enemies scale in level, and the main quest brings high level people back to the area.
---
Since the patch i can't even go near the whitespring without blue screening or freezing. It's getting kind of ridiculous.
---
So dumb question. Is the gat a semi or automatic?
---
I was against that at first but now that it's gotten so out of hand it seems like a valid solution
---
When you design a game, balance and this thing called "quality of life" are important, if not difficult to implement.  It's not so much when you do it right, everyone notices, but when you do it wrong, it can ruin the experience.  This is clearly the case here.  People aren't necessarly idiots or bitching, nor RPG noobs.  This is just a poor design choice.
---
This has nothing to do with difficulty.  It's purely a bad user interface that impacts the enjoyment of the game.
---
Ah sadly you can put armor pen on the gatüò©
---
Did you not see the peep holes made from the picture frames or the secret false  end to the whole building pictures?
---
I'm pretty sure they will make an overhaul to this Perk card system. Right now it's pretty much unplayable without mods. I need to swap 10 cards to switch between my melee and heavy build, it's impossible to do it in battle.
---
And constant hacker/lockpick swapping is just infuryating. What's even more annoying is that otherwise I really like this system! 
---
I thought the update wasnt coming out till next week for console? 
---
Gat is technically automatic but has a fairly slow fire rate. I‚Äôve tried both and still prefer the two shot though. 
---
no way to get more strength without cutting into my health pool is there? I'm specifically avoiding that
---
It's nothing to do with the balance and interface. 
---
**You don't HAVE to take off your lockpick perks after every use.**
---
LOL! What kind of tardo failtroll idiocy is this
---
I bought my TSE guns off of this market place if you look at my posts some are inquiring about a purchase. This post is 100% real. We don‚Äôt duplicate our items nor do we know how.
---
Sorry to hear that, my friend, I lost my grandparents, who I was extremely close, to cancer in extremely short time span to one another. It does get easier over time, just keep your head up and let him live on in your memories! My condolences to you and your family. 
---
Have you noticed two shots breaking your weapon faster?
---
and do you think the animation change is a bug or does it actually hint the dmg type has changed?
---
I like it like that since it encourage team-work instead of encouraging greed.
---
Not at all, I use a two shot 50 cal on a daily basis and repair it maybe once every 5k-10k rounds? I do repair it to 200% and use gunsmith 4 though. 
---
Or they could just give all lootable containers a set carry capacity as well as making weapons and armor no longer able to be dropped and only traded or sold. When attempting to drop the item it will prompt you with a window saying that the item would be destroyed similarly to the way with atom  shop items so that the items don't just clutter about. With the new player stores you'd be able to still give away some extra items or legendary items you don't care for for some caps and the duplication glitch no longer works for legendary items as it should have been. 
---
This could similarly be done for other items such as food, drink, and chems as well as mods and junk items, and ammo. They would be immediately destroyed upon (dropping) much like other games. It would suck that you wouldn't be able to drop any excess items anymore, but would it not be an acceptable price to pay to stop item duplication?
---
Fake news. Photos or it didn't happen... OR, what you aren't telling anyone is that you had a huge wanted level, lol
---
I had to hit "8 more". Now I see it lol.
---
Just so you know, that seems pretty ignorant of you. Don't you have any plans learned yourself? Maybe some of these are not possible to get the legit way and hammer will hit you too? 
---
*Just think for a moment, it's not about the cheaters right now, but about people who can lose tons of progress for nothing but **trading!** *
---
Two Optimized Bracers(Arm)(Reduce AP cost for power attacks)  
---
Two Kinetic Servos(Leg)(Increase AP Refresh while moving)  
---
and for Torso either Kinetic Dynamo(Increase AP refresh when taking damage)   
---
Core Assembly(Increase AP refresh speed)or Reactive Plates(reflects 50% of melee attack DMG.)
---
That combined with a good legendary with +40% Power Attack DMG with perks equipped for it(Gladiator vs Slugger) and you're pretty well set.
---
It‚Äôs deep but it‚Äôs thin, see...
---
If they haven't been banned by now I doubt they're going to be.a lot of diapers also use alternate accounts to do their duplication so the one with all the good stuff is not banned. Bethesda seems to be unable to handle this much like many things lately
---
In contrast: I ran Uranium Fever last night and I guy with TSE was blowing everything away in one shot. Lucky I was able to find 2/3 legendaries and get a shot in before him. But what if that last one had a good weapon for me :(
---
I dont get the appeal of being able to one shot everything. Especially if I was using a non legit weapon someone else gave me. At this point anytime I see someone with a TSE, I immediately assume it's a dupe.
---
Nope, not a single plan. I even turned down a dupers FREE tse weapon, can't be corrupted and I won't be bought.
---
yes, switching up servers between pve and pvp makes perfect sense. It might not in the lore of things, it is survival and reclamation after all. But it does take away the frustration of getting oneshot by some guy because you looked at him funny. The current options of pacifist just don't seem to cut it and some people just want to play coop missions and have fun.
---
That or private servers.
---
Nope, none of mine do. Just increased AP on one item :/
---
8 Turrets?  So this was a workshop then?
---
Im glad they are doing something, but Im also upset that they can supposedly figure out who has a specific helmet, but they cant figure out who has stacks of 100k of items? If they can do this, they can ban dupers, and need to.
---
SO much yes. I really, really don't get those silly skins. But guess people like them more often then not, judging by the amount of ridiculuosly stupid un-aesthetic skins in Heroes of the Storm, for example. 
---
Robotic Last Laugh
---
Thank you for the kind words. And during his funeral he wants people to donate money to cancer research rather than buying flowers. So hopefully one day we can all stop this. Xx
---
You need a new "Any" button.  Common malfunction. 
---
I got two tse guns for my 1.5k caps, one 50cal and one lever action... So i got two guns at that price so it's possible to buy tse guns for 1.5k caps
---
lol please tell me diapers wasn‚Äôt intentional because thats an amazing name for them
---
A functional fridge and a shelf with my teddybears? Yes, please. 
---
Game engine can't handle moving vehicles and such.  Read about that a while back with FO4 and someone confirmed it (being same game engine) with FO76 - so that's the main reason why we don't see them.
---
Flying is a bit different because the object is in the air, doesn't need to follow physics on the ground terrain and such, etc.  I mean if you don't have enough proof on how bad the engine is with flying - just look up in the air when 3 Vertibots and the Cargobot are flying around - its like a 3 Stooges show.  They are bouncing off each other, defying the physics of flying and just not looking good overall.
---
So until their engine gets an overhaul and Fallout ??? comes out - don't expect this to change anytime soon.
---
A simple fence around crops prevents up to 95% damage to crops.
---
because I do not have flat land and some fences are clipped into the terrain, they are rather short and some can get over that spot.  But for the most part, it solves the issue quite well.
---
Fun toy!
---
From what I've noticed, there are guranteed legendary enemies at the 25, 50, and 75 % marks. This is announced by the 'terminated management' voiceline playing. I always repair the extractors so I couldn't say it also occurs if 1 or 0 of them are working.
---
Yeah I always call him diapers I'm weird like that. Mainly a stab at their mental acuity and ability to play this game naturally
---
It's not the PS4. It's the garbage game Bethesda sold us. Probably some sort of memory leak causing the system to error code. My game on base PS4 can't run for 15 minute without crashing. Just as a test I ran Monster Hunter World for a couple hours off of an external HDD and it had no problems. That is with HDR on and being in an online session while being in a party and recording..I have just about 600 hours in MHW and have never, I repeat never crashed. In those nearly 600 hours I've only had one glitch and I can almost pin point it was an internet issue. 
---
If you can take someone else's pet I'd be more than happy to give it to you! I wasn't aware that that was possible
---
It's the angle. Even without mods (console), if you rotate it to set it flat against a wall, it'll spin to that 45¬∞ angle.
---
Gotten used to placing it at an angle to avoid it, but it's a pain when it gets removed because the reset makes it clip.
---
After the queen raid (doesn't matter if we kill the queen or not) I kill often the people in the shed. Just for fun. 
---
All the time.
---
&gt; Recieve justice.
---
Checks flair and is a bit confused.
---
I want to be able to boing boinga-boing at home please Bethesda.
---
I agree there is more game crashing since patch yesterday. We have to remember they said we are getting another patch real soon. So I guess in a week or so the other patch will fix these issues. I hope and pray anyway!
---
And do you prefer explosive on all your weapons or other legendary major modifiers?
---
Isn't that from the map screen once you're in game?
---
Does the dense mod on armor protect from explosions?  
---
Hmm.. I can usually keep around 1000 rounds on me for about 4-5 events easily.   2 days of playing two hours each play session.
---
So yes, she uses 50% more ammo than I use in about 4 hours of play.
---
When your comment has more likes then the post 
---
I just want everyone who I am teamed up with to get credit for doing a mission period. Why do we each have to do a every part of a mission? It makes them boring and tedious. Just let everyone share in the mission.
---
Just downloaded update yesterday. Approx. 4gb
---
As an automatic heavy weapons user, I do. However for VATS / sniper type builds I would skip the explosive and go for one of the vats perks (or crit damage maybe)
---
I agree for things like Daisycutter.  Good Point.
---
I'd put Nuka Cola Quantums in the fridge. I have picked up every one I've come across and never drank it since in Fallout 4 I used them for decoration. For whatever reason I can never drink a Quantum because I don't know if I'll need it in the future.
---
People are so naive generally...also they bite at the hidden advertising the grey market sites are making around here "it's safe, bought hundreds of games there" types.
---
What are those things in the first room that look like slides? 
---
Whats tech data for? Lvl 24,already sold a lot of them :0
---
I‚Äôve been really digging my online interactions. Have had one low level player attempt to kill me wit a machete, he was easily dealt with. 
---
Every other person I have encountered had either waved, traded with me, or partnered up for a few quests.
---
When I was still low level in the game I wasn‚Äôt sure about bounties and camps, I came across some locked water purifiers, I unlocked on and it had 5 purified water in it! So did the next two!
---
Up to that point I was dying of thirst and starvation(too low level in a high level area) and thought this was my reprieve.
---
Ended having a lvl 100+ claim my bounty, and when I came back around to pick up my junk, he dropped food and water for me, waved and went on his way!
---
In loving this game and my experiences have been contrary to what everyone told me before I got the game.
---
I don't trust Angry Joe anymore, he became too bias. He doesn't even hide it anymore that he only likes singleplayer story driven games. He hates survivals and multiplayers with an unfair passion.
---
Yeah I always try and let other players get shots in on high level enemies during events like this. Last night though some level 72 in PA with a melee weapon showed up to this event and he trapped one of the Legendary Mole Supervisors in one of the spawn holes. With his large PA blocking the other 3 or 4 of us in the event from getting a shot while he killed it himself. 
---
WHAT AN ASS! 
---
He spent the whole event warping around in VATS one-shoting enemies while I weakened enemies then let those enemies wail on me while the level 18 who showed up got some shots in (also got the that player up a few times when he went down). 
---
In fact it lists all the stuff in the game since the game is pretty much a bug.
---
Awesome lol
---
Some people don't check the social media page/forum/Reddit sub, etcetera of a game.
---
Very true sir, I concede.
---
That was just the most obvious game that majority of users have heard about.   Same problem will exist with Dark and Light as well (Same engine)
---
Technically most helms are around $99 and I am sure the extra crap has a monetary value to it as well. You're just out the $60 like the rest of us who paid full price for the game.
---
Honestly man I‚Äôd just search lfg or the forums for someone who can put the mod on for you.
---
People  are pretty good about it. Figure out what the mats are though
---
Yeah the same here . 4 blue screen in 30 minutes. Any hint of what is causing them?
---
This is pretty good. Where do you get the outfit recipe?
---
Can you have more then 1 gamertag per copy of Fallout 76 ?
---
When I bought the game I associated it a named account, that follows me through my alt toons
---
Please advise 
---
ummm.. vats crits have been bugged since beta, all you ever have to do is fill your crit meter once, hit spacebar then exit vats, open vats again and your next hit is a crit without using your full meter. hit spacebar and exit vats and repeat and you never lose your full bar and you crit every shot.
---
I don't think he'd be AFKing. If someone killed me while I was AFK at a trader for whatever reason, I wouldn't mind.
---
Based on my limited play time after the patch I‚Äôd have to agree.   I had the blank/black pipboy thing and multiple lockup‚Äôs that required killing the game within a couple of hours of play.  Previously it would lock up every now and then but not multiple times within a short span.  Assuming they actually patched duping I don‚Äôt suppose we can blame dupers now:) 
---
Sadly once you make your tag that's pretty much it.you could contact support and ask them if they can change your name to whatever you are asking for it but I don't believe that's possible
---
Keep at it, i calibrated my second leg yesterday, on to the jetpack and targetting hud !
---
If anything it's probably a friend or friends of the people who got banned. You can't swing the hammer too hard if the entire community is guilty.
---
ikr, it happens so often to me lately. I see a Legendary Protectron, proceed to kill it, quickly loot it then run away from it expecting an imminent explosion, which never happens.
---
Yeah those people cost me any fight with the queen lots of ammo. So I change ammo for some fun at the end :) 
---
I just turn it on so it sends what is going through the mic to my headphones. Makes my voice have a slight echo, but at least I know my mic is working.
---
do you have a controller connected to the pc?
---
can confirm the same new feature with the loading screen
---
itjustworks.jpg
---
not very often for me. I was able to sometimes play a full night (for me, 2.5-4 hours) without a single crash or disconnection, or sometimes crashes would happen 1-2 times in that span. The game has been somewhat decent for me, but last night was insane!
---
Yep, I have combined my Rifleman build with melee. The melee part isn't the strongest but I can still kill the Whitesprings nuke zone Glowing Ghouls in 1 - 2 hits.
---
I can also easily switch to a automatic rifle or shotgun build.
---
Yes, this and the hand drum too! 
---
The only other game that has blue screened my ps4 is fallout 4 ironically..
---
I haven't personally connected one by my room mate and I share so let me check that out. 
---
I thought the same thing, but I didn't see anybody else bring it up so I thought I imagined it 
---
I think that‚Äôs part of future content they plan to announce soon but not in this patch.
---
There were players who found a way to dupe painted power armor pieces. 
---
They were advertising in the fo76 discord too. 
---
I found this out last night and i got unnecessarily wound up by it lol
---
For fuck sake, every fucking story I read now has "and I have a TSE ____", makes me sick.
---
I wish I had your luck, I'm lv 180 and ive founds zero assassins sentinels and only found one assassins cavaliers piece so far, I never even heard anyone talk about that set (it is like sentinels but -dmg while sprinting instead of standing)
---
This has been a complete game changer for me. Highly recommend 
---
I anxiously awaited my chance to log in, and saw no discernible difference, still about 70-80 seconds of 'loading' screen.
---
Based on what I have heard (but it may be wrong) yes. There is a jetpack for every power armor except Excavator.
---
I had this the other day after playing fifa. If the controller is connected, the mouse and keyboard wont do anything until its unplugged 
---
The only thing I want from the atomic shop is the hot rod power armor paint if that ever comes back. It'll go good with my leather jacket.
---
I lost myself right at the beginning
---
Thank you Snails22, very cool!
---
I realized that the base configuration items were not in there. Sometimes I ain't so good at keeping track of multiple things anymore! Couldn't remember if the Automatic was the standard or not. heh
---
Anyway, thanks for this! Very helpful to me until/if Beth marks known plans!
---
I just saw the black marine helmet at sutton station, like 10 helmets there. I bought one so it is mine now and if i buy an owl helmet or any of these items from a fo76 station then fu these are mine. Fair
---
I think hitting the dev room was officially crossing the line for BGS
---
Those are just the slanted walls pieces. They can be used surprisingly well as stylish little walls or railings. They're also used to line the balcony as seen from the first pic.
---
Lol glad you found it.
---
Nothing new here, it's a known phenomenon in the online games, they will know how to handle it best.Scare a few of the prominent ones and the rest of the sheep will shit their pants.
---
In 2015 it was at %70.  I don't believe that's how the pc sees it or how steam aggregates the data.
---
&gt; just look up in the air when 3 Vertibots and the Cargobot are flying around - its like a 3 Stooges show. They are bouncing off each other
---
Especially after crippling all 3 vertibirds engines with enforcer. They are like a toy sailboat on a pond, hoping the wind blows them in the right direction again so they can try shooting me. 
---
You get more Nuclear Material upon event completion, I have completed the event at 100% and gotten 6 or 8 Nuclear Material and under 100% awards 2-4 Nuclear Material. Not really a big difference for the amount of work required keeping those machines safe and repaired. 
---
Oops :)
---
I was in Whitesprings just taking out some scorched and I was apparently the highest level player there (albeit only in 70's).  WHat was happening is that I'd use the Tesla on the creatures to "touch" each at least once and then pull out the ole' fireaxe to mow them down with the rest of the team rather quickly.  Then I'd go in and grab all the stuff I don't want (armor mostly) and re-drop it for folks so they have higher level gear to "work towards using".  Its like watching seagulls going for a spilled bag of popcorn... but it was so fun helping them.
---
You're gonna make 'em nerf the guaranteed spawns, man
---
You don't need to dupe to get enough bobbleheads for this because the curator perk is also bugged and gives you infinite bobblehead effects.. so you can just server hop and farm them very easily, stacking the effects each time.
---
That's not the only thing that's confusing.
---
After level 70 I just started using it to clear silos in 10 minutes since you can do it after getting to the last mainframe room. No way i'm doing that stupid craft or find mainframe cores part. Takes too much time and isn't very fun. If you get lucky you can clear in about 7 minutes if you vats the turret above the computers in the hazard room and get up. Doesn't always work though.
---
TLDR but in most recent alt experiences as a lowbie, highbies w/TSE or
---
Chameleon just want to grief me or trash my camp
---
Imanobody, lvl17 just trying to lvl up like everyone else just seems imagriefermagnet 
---
Doesn't work that way. If i buy any, i'm doing it so I can dump them in the river somewhere
---
PC was solid for me
---
Maybe one day, but sadly, probably not during my lifetime, but one can certainly hope something will be done 
---
Youre so dumb, it's very easy to get 100 bobbleheads.
---
Anything that stops hopping is good.
---
Or make bobble heads and mags decorative only with displays for your camp the way they were in Fallout 4, I‚Äôd be up for that, would also be funny if duper‚Äôs logged in to find their 5000 explosive bobble heads had turned into camp decorations overnight with no warning and they were carrying around nothing more than camp decorations for no good reason lol üòÇ üòÇüòÇ
---
I haven't done a SBQ fight yet, but I can completely understand. But what I don't understand is why only 85% upvoted this. I swear there are people that come on here and downvote everything they can.
---
The fact that you can switch them out, is the reason why this game is not as ‚Äòmulti-playery‚Äô as it‚Äôs intended to be... why team up when you can do anything yourself... i set out (originally) to be the crafter of my team. And that is actually the reason that i eventually quit...
---
I quit playing around lvl 50‚Äôish, (the rest of my team quit after a day of playing) having 10 int already, and after seeing a yt-vid stating having more than 5int is a waste since you can just switch out the crafting perks, that was the straw that eventually made me stop.
---
Why would anyone specialise, if that is actually gimping yourself, if you couldn‚Äôt change them out, people would be more inclined forming a tight group, having a dedicated ‚Äòtank, healer, thief, crafter, sniper, builder, assassin, scout,...‚Äô would be so much cooler imho.. and you could still play solo if you wanted, but you‚Äôd be more jack-of-all-trades-y... 
---
This game has/had so much potential, but they rushed it, and essentially ruined it... i‚Äôm still hoping that in a year or so, i can come back (with my friends) and have the sort of gameplay i hoped this game would deliver.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, i‚Äôve enjoyed my time in the game, i am one of the few people that have been mostly spared of bugs, crashes, etc. 
---
But eventually the game gets so boring, even when i still have so much things i could do. Having gone for an explosives build (with the 10int) my rocket launcher should kill just about anything in 1hit, so i don‚Äôt get good legendaries at all. Since the legendary enemies almost never drop legendary stuff when you kill them too fast, usually just regular items. Or the damage doesn‚Äôt apply, since the game thinks you ‚Äòcheat‚Äô if you do too much in 1 hit.  
---
Fix your game Bethesda
---
Sorry for this wall of text.
---
Tldr: being able to switch perks ruins the coop aspect of this game, and then some personal ranting :)
---
I spent over 700 caps buying them from a vendor; I think they were 354 for each bundle. I will not do that any more. I don't earn enough caps to keep myself in level appropriate armor. Things worked fine before this patch. There was no reason to "fix" this other than it being the low hanging fruit.
---
It made me really happy about the 3-star legendary I've been lugging around, 50% AP, 25% RoF and reduced VATs. May not be a two-shot or explosive, but it does a damn good job and I love it.
---
This.  The only way, within reason, you have 50 of the same bobblehead is you duped then or bought them from a duper.
---
I have one toon with strong melee and decent shotgun but it‚Äôs nearly worthless against SB unless they land.    I figured  try something slightly different that has more effectiveness against SB.  
---
Chop that meat!
---
I'm not just talking about this even just in general 
---
Honestly the whole perk card system is very tedious, my wish is that I would‚Äôve know what perks to pick when I started the game. 
---
we'll need to route out the organized crime before that becomes a thing. 
---
I have to X01 Calibrated Shocks I can sell you on Xbox for 2400 caps

Someone took out all 3 Vertibots around the tennis courts and the shells of them fell down on the ground causing massive FPS issues, drawing problems, multiple car explosions and made the game almost unplayable for some of the players in the immediate area as they were saying on comms.  This was over the weekend so hopefully the patch fixes some of this.
---
I don't know what to say to you if you feel that everyone else is wrong and that nobody who dislikes this clearly ill thought out interface should play RPG's.  I guess that's the beauty of games, everyone can take what they want from them, and enjoy them as they see fit.
---
I could get into how non combat knowledge, in a survival game even as sparse as this one, would be acquired over time.  It's not unrealistic for people to have multiple skillsets IRL, why would it be in the wasteland?  Lockpicking, hacking, etc... All could be learned.  None would unbalance the game.  Considering that at the end game usually the limitations are gone and the challenge is large scale boss monsters and raids (lets not even get into what a mess that is in F76) the non combat perks aren't going to change that.
---
Combat perks on the other hand tend to have a devastating effect when abused, which is why I actually agree with having limited builds and loadouts.
---
There's a blend of what the game wants to impose and what is realistic for a majority of the player base.  Not everyone has time to level up 3 different characters to use in different situations.  And it breaks the illusion of being in the game world when you spend a lot of time managing the non combat perks.
---
Also you sound angry but I'm going to take it as passionate about the game because I'm all for debate on why something may/may not work for players.
---
Yea... I like watching his show, but I don't put much credence into his game and movie reviews anymore.  He's entertaining now, as a persona.  Less informational, more just...  a celebrity fixture of YT gamer culture.
---
How is everyone supposed to know what is and isn't in the game or from the devroom? Some level 20 or so might have had one of the things traded to them and they have no idea. Are they supposed to get banned because they didn't memorize every single item?
---
It really isn't hard to get many of the same bobbleheads without duping. You can very easily farm and trade them, then the curator perk is bugged to give infinite effects. Well played Bethesda.
---
Just fix the game, Bethesda are the only ones to blame for all this mess.
---
I stopped picking locks and hacking PCs above 0. The payoff is almost always disappointing anyway. Definitely not worth fiddling with my perk cards out in the wild.
---
I played on the PS4 all night when I got home from work without a single crash or disconnect.
---
Worst thing that happened is one of my teammates who was logged on first wouldn't see me and my other one as Online so they couldn't accept or send invites.  They just logged out and back in and that worked fine.
---
That and the PS4 update being less than 4 GB, and me having about 60GB free space, it saying I had to free up space to download.  But luckily I had a bunch of old installed games I could delete to free up another 100GB.
---
Hey at least that's something...  
---
No wonder I never noticed if that's the only difference...
---
I think they have bigger things to concentrate on than some guys getting 20 caps/3-5 minutes.   
---
Think of the dupers...
---
I have an odd issue with these. I have 14 in my inventory that I cannot use. I can't sell/drop them and I cannot use them to activate the quest. The quest only fires off when I pick one up. Maybe I am doing something wrong.
---
What is your definition of griefing used in your first example?  To me, killing someone repeatedly that doesn't want to PvP is griefing. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=skeleton+costume&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on
---
That's an interesting context - I tend to think of characters not as a perception one but as a rifle one... which means high per as a by product, same with I split characters into Vats/non-Vats etc. Problem is if you add minimum special values to using perks you will implicity hit other values particularly as characters get more and more perks. I tend to lose interest at about 100-131 and remake a new character but that 131st level character essentially has everything (some perks are so awful I've only got them from packs). If I want to tp my melee main just switches to "weight reduction" mode, then back to melee. I use the deck mod to make that super simple. Problem with minimum values is as you'd pick up more and more perks you'd have to reduce specials that were important enough to have high... just to equip perks which weren't important enough to be a key part of the build in the first place.
---
thank you :)
---
It might have been but idk for sure. I do know that gamers like r/omniscient_zero have made this game awesome. I have gamed most my life and the kindness of the Fallout 76 community is by far one of the best things I have ever experienced in any game. 
---
you don't have to remove your gear.
---
Totally agree! The whole mainframe core fiasco is tedious at best. Comment saved, fellow wanderer.
---
Yea I avoid using vats. Not heavy gunner friendly.
---
^__^
---
&gt;Also you sound angry
---
God when will this half assed response die? Redditors overuse this shit so much.
---
Yea, you're repeating bs lies. Why do you say it if you don't actually know?
---
https://youtu.be/aw4xomXVwpQ
---
That's why I don't see myself as a griefer. I kill to steal someone's junk and I won't bother them again after that unless they want to get revenge.
---
I used a super sledge, it too a min but it felt good doing it the whole time (afk at watoga station vendor, I went to see the boys vendor and came back to him still afk) 
---
Indeed it is very tedious to keep on swapping these cards out all the time. These definitely should be made into passive skills, and their respective "minigames" tweaked to support these changes. Just adjust the difficulty of lockpicking or hacking based on the skill rather than "you can't pick this lock".
---
Essentially allow players to unlock anything but if they don't have the skills, just ramp up the difficulty of doing it. I think this is what the Elderscrolls series does. You can break into anything but if you don't level up that skill, it can be very very hard.

They only say they are working on a list of future updates. if you follow  the "inside the vault" series, they said the latest patch was for bugs and stability

I try to be mindful if I see people waiting, even if if selling, I get out of the vendor to allow you to do what you have to do. But in general people need to chill ... if your being a dick I take longer. Patients kids.
---
According to some in this sub its only if it against them. IMO that is griefing
---
I like to think the downvoters and generally negative people online  are the ones that got out of bed this morning and stubbed their toe, made a patch to the kitchen to boil the kettle only to find their cats thrown up a hair ball on the floor and they just stood in hairy cat sick, then they turn on the tap to fill the kettle and there‚Äôs a sudden water pressure surge and the tap soaks them from head to toe lol, but seriously like they say you can‚Äôt keep all of the people happy all of the time, just they way of the world, and certainly reddit lol
---
I gave away a full set of lvl 20 light armor and a bunch of plans/recipes I didn't need to a lvl 19 yesterday.  It took FOREVER because I kept missing the 0 and it would reset to 25000.
---
It would be easy to fix with a custom, namable hot swap option.  You can have your lockpick loadout, then when your done, switch back to rifle loadout.  Or it in the favorites menu.  Done.
---
I find it easier quicker to just smash the turrets then go through the level 3 hacking, every time I do a silo with my friend by the time I hack the system he‚Äôs already destroyed all the turrets 
---
Get a shotgun and rank 3 enforcer as soon as you can. Just quickly, manually aim at anything's legs (both of them) and it will pretty much cripple them, then you can usually take your time killing it while it lies there.  Great for lvl 90 deathclaws and such.
---
Maybe 100x is too low. But 1000x... c'mon.
---
We can play it safe and just kick those with 10,000x. Last week i saw a dudes inventory with over 1 million explosive heads (and 309 hundred thousands plus of the others)
---
Ive maybe found 10x energy in hundred plus hrs of gameplay. I dont farm them though so maybe 100 isnt outrageous (?).
---
And yeah bethesda fucked up yet again. I still think this would be a solid way to weed out dupers if theyre capable of tracking invetories. Removing them all from the game is imperative to it ever functioning properly.
---
I often wonder if there are many other multiplayer games that have to deal with so much dynamic cluter over the map. most MMO have very static scenery, with only client side cosmetic clutter etc...
---
Maybe this is an overlooked technical hurdle of FO76... Just wondering.
---
I cant tell if you are kidding or not. All TSE are OP.
---
Not as rare as people who remember to put which platform they're playing on. There's someone selling it right now on r/market76 for PC.
---
Exactly! According to some if they try to get revenge they it's griefing
---
They see me trollin‚Äô
---
And baitin‚Äô
---
Shitpostin‚Äô
---
They tryina catch me breakin post rules
---
Its not because of the bobblehead bug, unless there is another step.. because I tested it and you can't 1 shot even with 200k damage.
---
It looks me forever to get Calibrated Shocks mods for T-60 and then I found two more for sale literally the next day.
---
I'm sure I'll have the same luck trying to get them on X01 as well.
---
You can start with the 1969 Montreal Riots. No extra drugs, the police go AWOL and (unsurprisingly) crime goes through the roof. But I'm sure it could all have been averted by just demanding that everyone stop being so 'childish' and act like decent human beings.
---
From there just go and check any of the myriad 'Funding cuts/Police policy blamed for rise in crime' articles that go through national news outlets.
---
Hopping servers does nothing when it comes to vendors refill of caps. That's tied to you, and you need to wait the amount of time regardless. 
---
Oh God won't someone please think of the dupers
---
So weird.
---
I'm on XBox.  I was getting very few crashes/disconnects for the entire life of the game from the beginning.  But right when I noticed that others were saying it was more stable, I started getting more crashes/disconnects (especially while moving Legendary weapons to/from stash).  After the patch, it's become stable for me again.  I'm not going to be surprised if it's buggy for everyone else.
---
Yes exactly. I still watch his reviews only for entertainment. But even seeing him trash movies that are perfectly OK to watch is making me put less importance on the final score he gives them.
---
Beautiful.

---
I have this happen to me on my 4 story camp with stacked stairs. 
---
The only way to fix it is to run stairs from the highest level of the camp down til you are close enough to the ground that you can terminate the stairs with a foundation. Then you can start removing the floors on the highest level and remove the stairs last. 
---
My camp is east of Whitespring, but in a relatively safe area. Someone had nuked the resort before I logged in (though my camp was out of the zone), so that could explain the scorchbeast). Can‚Äôt say for sure since I just sat there and soaked up damage until logging out.
---
Yeah, that's another good combo, I think sentinel assassin is best for ranged who can stand in one spot, while cavaliers assassin may be better for melee builds (sprint in fast as hell and smack you up close while tanking any hits they may receive).
---
I experienced that with automatron in 4
---
Mom goals. üôåüèΩ
---
If someone blasts your camp and dips, they should be in the recently played with social tab, yeah?
---
Good shit good shit
---
Yeah copying took waaaaay longer than the actual download. 
---
i would def get that spacesuit if i wasn't worried about a limited time only Silver shroud outfit around the corner heh
---
Mate those were French Canadians, and they're practically French which means they just look for reasons to riot on a Wednesday
---
i know i farm mothman eggs too, but its kinda strange
---
Then don't cry when you get locked out? lol
---
When I logged in on multiple occasions my co trolls were disabled indefinitely until switching servers a few times.
---
the camo looks pretty good on the X-01
---
&gt; I'm bit sick of the notion that anybody is in the position where they feel they are justified to define how something is intended to be used. 
---
But here that's just common sense. What could be, with the biggest probably and logic, their intention? Having players swap cards all the day long or just during their build testing phase?
---
Enjoy the lash of the spanking!
---
the guy stopped whacking stuff because he saw how well decorated it was and was like "i cant destroy this"
---
That is an evasive comment that ignores any valid points made in my posts though.  Are you interested in discussing why people feel the current system is less than optimal or do you simply want to berate those who disagree with you so that you can feel better about your own views?  Btw I never said anything is wrong with your views, as everyone can decide what they like and don't like in a game, I just disagree with them.
---
Well if you can get your hands on the illusive 3‚ô¢ Bloodied(or Anti-Armor) Machete with 40% swing speed, +1 STR, and add the Sacrificial blade mod to make it into a 4‚ô¢ legendary and it will deal poison &amp; bleed damage on top of its initial damage. With a ridiculous swing speed it will stack DPS fast with the right perks and mutations+ chems and alcohol.
---
Fair enough!
---
For some reason I had to free up 40gb of space to do the 4gb update. But I left mine doing it while I was watching tv so can't comment on the time it took. 
---
Was that the FO76 Update or the PS4 Update? Seems like they both updated on the same day. The PS4 Update took a while for me. 
---
It's still an issue sure, but having 1 less cause it's better than nothing changing, at least in my opinion it's an improvement 
---
What does your dps need to look like for you to be an asset vs a hindrance?
---
If someone doesn't want to fight you cant kill them unless you use glitches
---
Honestly, just taking on packs of low level mutants will rack up the caps quickly. Grafton Dam and the Penitentiary are always muties, I think. 
---
that one doesn't have lead
---
Tested with the [1.0.4.13](https://1.0.4.13) update and still the same issue. Made a [Screen recording](https://youtu.be/TqFR5QjI3kA), but that also crashes with the game.
---
Completely agree that perks should be passive since everyone can use them at any time, and there is no any specialization in the game
---
Only a couple people on PC have gotten in as far as I know, I dont think this is as big a deal as people are making it out to be. It's not good but its not the end of the world and people are getting banned left and right.
---
Hitting max caps without even trying, I mean it may not be hard to do if you don‚Äôt spend any for a month and grind the vendors out daily, but that does take some time and work, ergo they had to try.
---
Happens still on PC too, I couldn't claim 2 workbenches in the past few days
---
My camp had the unscrapable water purifier bug before the patch using 40% of my budget
---
The patch resolved the issue ... I just had to scrap 99 industrial purifiers from stock.
---
&gt;That is an evasive comment that ignores any valid points made in my posts though
---
You threw your valid points out the window as soon as you resorted to using generic reddit comebacks.
---
If you wanted a relevant reply, stay on topic in your own fucking comment.
---
Yeah, unfortunately I think you are probably right 
---
All I can think of when I see that power armor is the fucking animatronic from FNAF. We had camo weapon skins datamined on launch and multiple atom shop items had screenshots of poses with camo weapons. Where are those? Why are we months into the game and still unable to have a basic forest camouflage on a hunting rifle?
---
I'm on ps4 and have had the same experiences. I've met like  3 aholes in my time on Fo76 in 80 plus hours. 
---
Most people are either lone wanderers li r are more than willing to group up and cruise around.
---
Guess I'll die.
---
I often find it funny that someone wants to get revenge and doesn't know when it's time to give up. I killed a guy a few days ago to get his junk. I quickly stored the loot because he kept coming back only to get killed four times in a row before he killed me once. 
---
He left me alone after he discovered that he wasn't going to get his junk back. 
---
Sounds pretty damn tanky lol
---
Heh. I've had the same problem.  A few tricks I use now...
---
* I put my gun away.  Less threatening.  If I want to "point", I blink my gun in &amp; out of my hands and look down.
---
* I try to catch them at a vendor, so they're not already in the middle of something.
---
* I try to drop stuff where the bag will be really visible.
---
* I drop a water or stimpack quick.  If they pick it up, drop another 2 or 3.  Only after that do I bother trying to drop a pile of plans before they run away.
---
Too bad they don't give screws back (at least, mine didn't.... maybe there is a perk card?)
---
It really doesn't exist bro, sorry to say (as proved by it not being in the dev room). I'm sad too as Ultracite PA is my favourite. The only way to get around it is to use a different torso with jetpack, as the others apart from Excavator/Raider all have them. Probably what the other guy is talking about.
---
This cancer is partly why many fans of Fallout were gutted when they found out it would be a pure online experience.
---
The thing is I spend a minute or two making sure my combat cards match my weapons before leaving base. But I shouldn't have to. It isn't fun doing that. 
---
It's simple, the way it is now having 5k weight in boblehead just make u walk slow, make it so if your 10x your max weight u die and drop all your items. Boom no more infinite stacks in ppl bags. Also make duping a hell uva lot slower
---
This is so fucking wrong, there are a lot of players who have no idea about the dev room or it's items and have simply been given/traded these items.
---
You really have no fucking clue Bethesda.
---
im saving my caps just to buy a hat then i will be happy
---
Now that there‚Äôs this quantity scrolling feature? Bug? not stopping at 0 people will need more time at vendors to stop on the right number. I always take my time to make sure I don‚Äôt sell something I don‚Äôt want to due to surprise lag etc but this new scrolling thing is a pain. Please have some patience folks they may not be AFK they may just need extra time.
---
\*Need to know more Intensifies\*
---
Ohhhh that may have what happened to me. I don't often not click the mouse at that part, but that time I pressed the keyboard.
---
Still crashing and unstable on Ps4. Still loading in to invisible enemies. Nothing has changed but an extra tid bit of load screen. Where are you getting these Placebos? 
---
I was a pistol vats build, too, but since the december update, there was a vats glitch that would jump in and out of vats and aiming down sights and regular view that happened so often and was so persistent it made me change my build. 
---
That name means absolutely nothing to me. The fact that he calls himself "Angry Joe", solidifies the fact that his "persona" gives over-the-top and biased info. "Hey, look at me.. the angry clown giving bad game advice.. click subscribe to see more of my antics!"
---
Let this man SPEAK1
---
It's like these folks are jealous or something, this guy who shot me while I was wanted was screaming hacker because I took no damage from him in my armor, he said he was recording and exposing me. I laughed so hard as he repeatedly threw himself and his caps at me while saying "oh Bethesda is gonna love banning your ass!"
---
Nice build, I can see you went to a lot of effort. 
---
I just wish we had the bar counters from Fallout 4! Plus mounted creature trophies, I need some taxidermy. 
---
Where does one find BoS quests, though?
---
That's wrong, youncan stil kill them with slap damage. It just takes a while.
---
This. A thousand times this.
---
Fantastic.  Inspirational even. 
---
Thanks lol.
---
Awesome.  Really enjoyed this convo man.  Best of luck in the wasteland and it's great to see someone so passionate about the game.
---
Probably no or minimum turrets, those things take up a huge amount of your budget
---
There is also the close ranged Stealth/Pistol build which saves tons of SPECIAL points (no need for Perception), allowing for more pistol abilities, but you will still have to decide between them.    So that auto-pistol can do quite well.
---
Also there is a Stealth/Gunner - Mid Range build that does not snipe really from long distances but seeks to get close range and use Auto abilities from concealment.  I'm trying to do this type of build myself to avoid carrying around that extra rifle for those long distances.  Just too heavy for my 3 str.
---
Just keep trying.  I've gotten two, multiple jetpack mods (gave to friends) and couple of stealthboys.  
---
Just check in there every time you join a server.  You'll find them.
---
This i have said this before many many times. I might try asking u/LoneVaultWanderer and u/LadyDevann this time. They are already outshined by most things the least they could do is craft ammo in the correct amounts for the cost of the craft.
---
We need a weapon balance across the board before Vaults hit. Also would be great to know what the plans for TSE balancing is. So we can start planning for any balance patches..
---
Thanks you two for reading as usual. As always know that almost all of us appreciate everything you two do for us. :)
---
It takes one button press to counteract 5 minutes of damage 
---
My buddies like to hack the turrets, remove their targeting parameters, and have them destroy the robots, and then disable them. 
---
So I got a paintjob done from someone and Im wearing the bos knight power armor. Will I get banned now or what?
---
Great job!  I love to discover people's CAMPS!  I built a couple of fancy designs myself, I have a Wayne Manor/batcave one where you can find the code to the batcave hidden in pieces inside the manor, I like to make the experience fun for the people discovering my CAMPs 'cause that's what I like too!  Are you on PC,  XBOX or PS4?
---
Just look for videos on youtube it's actually quite easy. You only need either marsupial/jetpack and a power armor, the rest you need to search for.
---
Isn't that a positive thing? Now it doesn't take forever to scroll to higher numbers for large stacks. 
---
First cometh, first serveth. Now, that's in the good book.
---
The funniest bit is it doesn't work with arbitrarily small stacks. Try to trade with something in a stack of 10 you can scroll down to 1. Try with a stack of 100 and wooooo it just keeps going left around the world.
---
The growth things on the shoulders of Grafton monsters
---
You can get legendary items from it. I don't know what the frequency is, but I've gotten one.
---
It's possible the quality of the rewards is tied to the number of times you've picked up Technical Data before turning in? I should try to test that in a more systematic way. 
---
Not if you use certain builds. Some melee builds are still capable of killing someone quickly with slap damage.
---
I always try to loot them quickly, then run away, cause the explosion sometimes make them impossible to find, specially the Assaultrons.
---
Occasionally it causes a Re-Spawn moment. :-( 
---
&gt; If you know you can‚Äôt hurt her be a pal and keep the deathclaws, sloths, other scorchbeasts, crickets, Yao gui, and other sorts of aggravations off the players who can actually kill her. 
---
As harsh as it is a bunch of low levels who can barely defend themselves, if that, from the adds won't even be able to contribute as much as 1 or 2 guys with an explosive shotty going around practically looking those adds to death.
---
They'd honestly probably be more useful squadding up with that ally rad removal perk and just sitting in a shed. 
---
i mean what other game has end game content where low levels can just waltz in where everyone says "Ehh... just tickle the mobs for us or whatever."
---
Yup, I wish more people realized this, wish bethesda realized this.
---
Don‚Äôt waste your time with excavator armor unless you want the carry weight because that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs good for, if you‚Äôre having trouble with springs now just wait until you need to repair it haha
---
Hi there! To make your life easier maybe take over Gorge Junkyard workshop? The Junk Extractor will give you Springs and the Titanium extractor gives you Black Titanium and there's a Power Armor frame there as well. 
---
While the workshop is making stuff you can go farm elsewhere to speed things along. I hope this helps :)
---
Almost too bright.. somewhat blinding if standing by a wall lol.. oh well, better than the candle that the headlight used to have
---
I found a dog on the cliffs by Harpers Ferry with a few skeletons but couldn't do anything with it.
---
Much appreciated!
---
Yes, the legendary effects are permanent on the gun no matter the mods you put. Some legendary effect work better with different RoF and such. Like furious on an auto or instigating on a single shot rifle.
---
Dude, I totally feel you but there are so many nice high level players out there.  I'm level 171 and I always help out, it's what the game is for me, that said I had a few run-ins with total jerks but most people are real nice.
---
constant crashes to home
---
I don't really get it either, but I don't get a lot of things that people (mostly younger than me) are into.
---
Thank you! Yeah, it was quite an ordeal. From just having issues to place down the foundations to decorations. I'm satisfied with the build!   
---
I agree..I wish we had those bar counters. Even the longer ones you can see at some Diners in the game.
---
I think he meant the diary/weekly challenges instead of main/side quests.
---
I believe it's pretty useful since not everyone knows there is a challenge menu.
---
I had this happen after a small group of liberators attacked my camp...I assumed they hacked my turret because they had the perk card I guess.
---
Me too!  
---
Oh man that's actually an idea I toyed with in a previous building I made. It was a trick house. One of the rooms had a coded door proceeding to the next room. I hid the code amongst painting using those small metal letters plans.
---
On PS4
---
Lets just say it we need a proper heavily worked on weapon / legendary effects balance patch.
---
I killed the queen with my melee build just last night.
---
My furious gatling gun chewed her health up, so I would recommend getting something like that. 
---
Seems like I do dick all for melee damage to her anyway.
---
But dont hide in a shed. Id rather die. 5x than see a group fail.
---
Absolute opposite for me. The few hours I played yesterday were crash/lock up free. Loading screens were faster for me.  Even had better frame rates in the nuke zone.
---
It happens to me after any attack it seems
---
Swanky. 
---
There can be a pair of lvl 97 glowing deathclaws at whitesprings during a nuke.
---
same with xbox. For me, it'll leave the repair window, my guy steps away then back to the bench, and now I'm magically in the "craft new" window
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 too, let‚Äôs visit one another someday!
---
Whitespring pre nuke ghouls give alot of ok legendaries even a few 3‚òÜ. Then nuke the sucka and farm them for tonnes of Legendaries.
---
Yeah...not sure...that was the first time for me. I just stored the turret and put it back up and it was all good.
---
I‚Äôm bothered that in this subreddit that Bethesda themselves have said they read and post in often for game ideas as even before release they advertised this as being community driven and inspired people still feel entitled to come in and shut down suggestions cause they like something or disagree. You can disagree but to so vehemently tell players to just deal with the game as is is stupid and goes against the design principles of the game. But hey go you guys.
---
Yeah someone on my team was checking out my decontamination arch not realizing they took Starched Genes off. He lost several mutations. He was very sad
---
 We laughed. Good times.
---
Be better to just have a passive leveling system where after so many successful attempts you progress to the next difficulty of lock. 
---
But the question is - are we talking about actual use of programs during FO 76 gaming sessions, or fact that those are present in your installed programs? If it is running those programs, I have no objections that it is breaking EULA. But if it is mere presence in your system, because FO76 or its anticheat component scans your systems for those and you get banned just for the mere fact it is there but not momentarily runnning, then it is problem. And anticheats and DRM had been known to do this kind of BS of scanning and collecting various information about you system and send it godknowswhere (ya hello GameGuard!). The fact that you have a tool which could potentially be used for breaking EULA or even law does not mean you are a criminal. Like in [that joke about woman on a boat.](https://www.cleanjoke.com/humor/Reading-in-the-Boat.html) 
---
It's not new just uncommon
---
Lv141. I use  the "follow me emote" everytime in the uranum fever event for the fellow dweller i met there, i get my shot and wait for them to do that too. I also had 2 random wasteland wanderer doing it for me. Sometimes bump into player that did'nt care to share the kill. Always worth give it a try, u can get 1 or 2 legendary only by pure luck if it spawn near you, just need 1 shot.
---
Duping works by forming a stack of items larger than the game allows. To rectify this, the game ejects the player with the disallowed stack and resets their inventory to before the stack was created. By creating the stack to trigger the kick and then dumping as much as possible before the ejection actually occurs, the duper is able to "dupe" all of the dropped items: they're present in the game world (in some form) and also replaced in the duper's inventory when it's rolled back.
---
Not only does this make it extremely unlikely that duping causes server-wide instability, but it also means that your suggestion would make duping *easier*, not more difficult. Furthermore, if you think that instability is generated by the server having to track too many separate items, then your proposal is also advocating more server crashes. The kick/rollback triggered when a duper does his thing removes the problem stack (and the duper) to allow the server to continue as usual. This suggestion would, by Bethesda's own admission that maybe big inventories cause lag/crashes, make everything far worse.
---
I think that in game which revolves arouns forced evolution,  survival of the fittest and adaptability, maximised adaptability is the only Fallout answer to your question. Also, there is one resource which abundance has not been anticipated hy Bethesda and its the players cleverness. You can see it in various places, but I think that two-digit level slot on the map is the clearest indication of how they thought we'd evolve slower.
---
Existence of perk cards pack is another clear indication of their iterative approach. I'm now closing to level 200 and for me the whole odea of perk cards, which sounded cool up to level 30, is now a major perk card inventory bloating issue. I have tons of perks I never use which bloat my inventory, and in the ~200 levels I had I only received two cards I actually wanted. I can't store my unwanted cards in a 'freezer' it takes me few minutes of perk swapping just because I have to sort through all the unwanted cards, and I really,  really need a better UI to be able to handle those. 
---
I also have at least eight different perk settings I use depending on a situation. Non power arnor, regular power armor, nuke ready power armor, lockpicker, gunsmith, armorer, trader and builder. Well yeah I coule make sacrifices or I could stick with one build. But if I had to stick with one build, it'd be PvP one and my main activity would have to be PvP oriented, and that would just severely limit the amount of ways I can play this game for my own enjoyment.
---
If it has it I don't see why not
---
Pretty much this. No actual defensive items in the CAMP. I also saved the lighting for last so I could use it sparingly but sufficiently.
---
You need tormentor in luck for a rifle build or you will get overrun by non-crippled swarms.
---
Exactly, I tag components that I am running low of (below 100) and just get all that I see thats tagged.
---
Requires to untag components after some runs.   I just know that when I am seeking a critical component in greater quantities, I just plan a raid to a spot that may have more of that.
---
i.e. If aluminum shortage -  mine it with excavator, hit watoga robots, or Sugar
---
Plastics, hit the high schools.
---
Lead, hit the mines or anyplace with lots of cans/can traps.
---
It's not new.  Don't scrap. Store then put them back 
---
Wait?!  Some higher level dropped me a marine armor helmet the other day for fighting with him!   Should I get rid of it?  On Xbox 
---
Uhh, Perfect Storm is a beast at lvl 50
---
Hey, is there any information about what Bethesda is aiming at here?
---
First, i've heard that players who cheated in order to reach test room got banned.
---
Now, it looks like players that might have just bought plans or items from these cheaters or whatever are potential targets for bans.
---
A good question would be the following : What will happen to people that somehow obtained items that are obtained from test room, either directly (plans, raw items) and undirectly (crafted items, such as the helmet thing)?
---
I mean, there are plenty of players that often reach reddit or other platforms in order to get some news about the game, but assuming every player do that or assuming every player must do that is sort of an extreme assumption, am i right?
---
Then, i wonder what is gonna happen to the player that just plays an hour or two per day, that found some item at a vendor bot and bought it without having a clue of where it was coming from?
---
What is worse from my point of view is that there is actually no exhaustive list of the items and crafted things that come right from the test room.
---
I would understand any witch hunt no matter how extreme it is as long as it keeps things fair by warning people that might be just victims about what they should do in order to proof their innocence.
---
Anyway, i wonder how long this will last, i don't even know for how long players that cheated could access the test room, but what i don't understand is why it took so long to figure out something was done and some players could bypass anything that was suppose to prevent access to test room.
---
I hope it'll get sorted out soon and as clear as posible, that would be the best issue for everyone i think.
---
That's good to know thanks!
---
Ayep.  That is the purpose of the Dense mod, reduction from explosive damage.
---
I wasn‚Äôt selling any at first stages thinking that somewhere later there would be some use of it. Well, appears to be a quest item.
---
Here's to that!
---
No, it‚Äôs pvp
---
I am running a rifle and unarmed build that works pretty well. 
---
My rifle damage is kind of reliant on my 2 shot lever action, but I mean that's just part of it. I sacrificed some rifle perks because the extra damage makes up for it. 
---
As for the unarmed, I take incisor, martial artist and iron fist in strength and then run twisted muscles and talons mutations and it makes me pretty strong even with just a non legendary power fist. 
---
Basically: its possible and if you find a good legendary, you can make it a lot easier for yourself. 
---
I have read that, no, power armor will not produce mods from scrapping.
---
Exactly. It's annoying because maybe you're under attack and you have about additional 6 or 7 seconds of disadvantage
---
You're trying way too hard.
---
It's not new, I had this happen the first week the game was out. I had to scrap the turrets. Then place new ones.
---
It is intended for that perk to work with Gauss. It was supposed to be addressed in this recent patch. I have yet to confirm though.
---
For me this never happened until the new patch.
---
Cannot learn power armor mods from scrapping, no, sorry.
---
That bug is not new it's still present in Fallout 4. Just not as old as the dragon bug. But hey.. maybe they'll patch it eventually. They did fix the lever action rifle.
---
&gt; for filthy hoarders like you 
---
Have my upvote!
---
Open the map and hit L1 (or whatever it is to open the menu for you) and there is a "leave game" option.
---
Because its not a thing?  PA does not give plans from scrapping.
---
Finally got one yesterday, even just one was a glorious feeling as I was able to remove a weight reducing perk. Keep at it, they do exist albeit barely.
---
Correct, it does not exist yet, not found by any data miners or not even in the dev room video..
---
Stealhboy plans, headlamps and vats matrix is also missing, i just cat belive they made a great new PA and dosent promote it in any way :/
---
I love the design, with the chrome vents and all, lol
---
I've never encountered this bug in Fallout 4 since it's release (Always on Ps4, but also on Xbox One).
---
I don't think there there is a problem with allowing people to craft whatever they want. There are a couple of MMOs out there that allow players to craft practically everything but that is usually tied into a skill (or more) that the player has to grind for a good while before they reach "master" levels.
---
Plus there is not much going for crafting to be honest. Sure it will help in getting that one gun or armor, but eventually you'll find that permanent legendary. I haven't crafted a gun or armor piece in weeks because of the legendary items I found. Only things I craft now are ammo, healing and camp items.
---
Grognak's Axe, it's an item from Fallout 4 but it's pretty rare. I think you can only get it from legendary drops?
---
I've got an anti-armor one I picked up from a merchant some other player sold it to. It's fantastic. 
---
It's a grognak axe, it exists in fallout 4 as a unique weapon and you can get legendary variants here. Also cheaters in the dev room found plans for a replica grognak axe but afaik there's no way of obtaining a non-legendary one legitimately
---
Fort Defiance. And earlier in the Mire you‚Äôll see mention of BoS which will start the quest to find out what‚Äôs going on. I did encounter BoS corpses earlier but nothing triggered any quest.
---
Yup. The pipe guns are very underrated. Honestly if you were on PC I would trade you for that pipe pistol.
---
Happens to me a decent amount, it started attacking my friend randomly too but if you store them it‚Äôs ok
---
Angry joe came in first in most annoying undereducated you tuber for the 3rd year in row.
---
tyvm for the link. Good luck with it.
---
Enemies have infinite ammo, but they don‚Äôt have infinite ammo in inventory, 
---
Whatever the default increment of ammo is for an enemy who acquires a new weapon is the amount of ammo they will drop. 
---
Example:
---
- Enemy picks up Missile Launcher
---
- Enemy AI says shoot PC forever 
---
- Enemy shoots at you forever until you kill them
---
- Enemy drops default ammo stack 
---
Griefing 
---
- Killing people who do not wish to pvp (main reason we want pvp / pve server options. Thanks bobbleheads for making this so fucking broken...
---
- Destroying someones base because *rping raider* its not its just griefing without legitimate reasons. Like who the fuck finds it funny to wreck a setup meant to help people. FFS its free food, water buffs and crafting stations. Also fuck anyone that blows up rad showers because that shit sucks to keep repairing.
---
- Following someone to different servers and wrecking their base or killing them until they block you is griefing.
---
- Doing any of this to low levels is mega fucking griefer scummy shit.
---
Which BOS quest can you repeat and how? I'm down for anything that feels challenging besides nuke chasing.
---
I used a mod to quick switch its easier for me. 
---
Yeah, they have never said we couldn't have that weight so a straight ban with no warning or anything would be a little uncalled for I believe
---
Pretty much this. It's good to have an idea of what kind of things you want in the CAMP before starting. More defensive or resource productive CAMPs call for smaller structures. If you want to build bigger and still have the necessities, you have to plan for the minimum amount of resources and defense. I built the purifier and food first then stored it so I could build to the limit while still having space for it.
---
No crashes for me on a Xbox 1x. Have  you done a hard reset in a while to clear your cache? This is what helps me the most.
---
Well darn, any way to find the plans for X-01 calibrated shocks?
---
I seen 3 ants kill a deathclaw once. Fuck it was sad
---
I feel like I missed something, even after two reads.
---
There‚Äôs no minimum, you could stand there bashing a scorched over the head with a protest sign and it would still help if it keeps that scorched occupied and he‚Äôs not bothering the players focus firing on the queen, just needs to be maximum effort when it comes to rolling up your sleeves and getting stuck in. The shed dwellers tend to be pretty much AFK which is a total hinderance. They put a bit of damage in to ensure rewards at the end then retreat to the shed and go AFK cause the hermit crabs etc can‚Äôt get through the door.  Some of us run low health builds with the mutation adrenal reaction for maximum damage output so we can only tank scorched damage etc for so long before we have to break from trying to force her to land to deal with the ground enemies, so if you didn‚Äôt feel you were bringing the queens health down much with your usual weapon/build just taking out the ground enemies is really really helpful and will win everyone‚Äôs gratitude.
---
Actually a rifle/pistol build would work. If you got some decent pipe guns you could really squeeze some big numbers out of them. 
---
Applying this to legendaries would mildly inconvenience dupers and probably never inconvenience a player who only acquired items by intended means. Applying this to any item, including bobbleheads, which normal players acquire in even small stacks would mildly inconvenience dupers and frustrate the hell out of at least a minority of regular players.
---
Dupers store their inventory on mules who only pop up to sell stock. Scrolling would be a minor, very occasional, inconvenience.
---
OTOH, this would irritate the shit out of everyone who actually had to try to play with an inventory that was even more cluttered and unmanageable than it is now.
---
Be careful with that quest if you start it and get DC'd before collecting all samples the quest resets itself to the very beginning. The other super annoying thing about that quest is sometimes the sensor can actually glitch and become unlootable making the quest not possible for that session. 
---
Yeah.  It's one thing to abuse a bug it's another to data mine and use engine tools and the console to teleport around then take future content items and start duplicating and selling them. It's a real slap in the face to the team building the game. Undermining the games present sucks; undermining it's future is toxic.
---
For me I have seen no difference. I figured I would see something just from removing one perk card looking at the damage then replacing it, but I see no change.
---
Pretty much happened to me, I run a melee character with a mix of bolstering and unyielding, using a bloodied power first with +40% swing speed and +1 str which gets me to +33 Str and 1243 damage and whenever I one hit people who attack me I'm hacking because power fists aren't that powerful.
---
That safe still had stims in it for me but all of the other safes that you pick lock and most of the med boxes have been empty for me since the patch, or might even have been after one of the server side updates they did.
---
That has nothing to do with fo76 it's how Sony does the updating process on PS4
---
Check out any game while you download it, takes minutes to download a 10g update but an hour to copy it 
---
Sony puts 2 complete files on the system and when it scans it and confirms its updated and working it deletes the copy, I'm sure I'm explaining it badly lol but that's the basic idea of Sony's updating process 
---
You can get away with just 1 rank in can do and have plenty of food. Put one point into pharma farma instead. Get rid of 3 intelligence and just swap out makeshift warrior if you come across a terminal that needs to be hacked. Put those points into class freak (you have one unused point in luck in your build you linked). Get rid of rad resist you can just pop a few rad x (they stack) and put 3 points into fireproof, to resist explosions and help with scorchbeast sonic scream. Take extra points and put into agi for evasive for extra defences and greater sneak.  
---

---
It's a temp ban. They can report the trader and get reinstated.
---
You do realize, that IS exactly the point of getting a perk every level after 50, right?
---
Maybe my scarcasim.... guy wasted alot of time to end up with very little. :)
---
Not sure if I can find it but according to datamined info, x-01 plans don't exist. You can learn to make the base armor with prototype paint from the enclave, but you can't learn to make any of the mods. Every other PA has plans for at least some mods
---
I used that trick to 'raise' the base of my camp-in-a-High-tension-tower: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag9fzc/my\_riverfront\_high\_rise\_camp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag9fzc/my_riverfront_high_rise_camp/)
---
I tried to make it looks fairly well supported all around, rather than just all floaty. 
---
Hes made a "dont complain about griefing post"
---
"Playing the game the normal way" would mean playing with friends... If you had just 2 friends that also did what you've been doing for legendaries the chances are at least a few of you would have something you would call "legendary"
---
I play with a group of around 8 consistantly. I have less than 100 hours and we're all drowning in legendaries. 
---
When I see players cowering in the shed, I try to kite a mob to them, then jump on top of the shed and vanish.
---
No plans for X-01 can drop in the game. You can only get X-01 mods from the Enclave Bunker.
---
Snallygasters and the Grafton Monster tend to drop a fit bit of acid.  There's always a Grafton Monster to the south of Charleston Station and as part of the Grafton Day event.  Snallygasters are almost always found underneath the collapsed bridge to the east of the Charleston Herald (among other places).
---
Thanks!  Updated
---
Depends. If you are using VATS the two shot weapons are buggy and miss a lot. It would also depend on 9ther effects. For a sneaky sniper build using VATS I would go armor. If you manually aim and can crank out rounds I would go two shot.
---
Your Gatling sounds like a beast, just had a bloodied Gatling drop so I‚Äôm gonna give it a spin next time
---
You do realise that excavation power armor gathers 4x more ore. It is extremely efficient to have it. The 100 weight is just bonus.
---
Probably shares the account with all his girlfriends.
---
And I had the most stable playtime I've ever had yesterday. No freezes, no dc's, no crashes, just perfectly smooth gameplay for about 6 hrs straight.
---
Thanks, updated!
---
Same issue with the Urban Scout armor...can only buy the mods, not learn plans. Additionally, there are no legendaries with that set.  Makes that armor pretty much pointless. 
---
That's because the way Sony does its updating process, they copy the entire game file to take sure the update is working and then the PS4 deletes the copy 
---
That's why copying takes so long on PS4 you're basically copying the entire game just for a 100mb or what ever the size update is 
---
I'll add a note that this might no longer happen - thanks!
---
I see this post every day and I usually ignore it until it happened to me yesterday. Participated in a nuke zone and finally saw a scorched queen(been to a few nuke zones but never saw one). The scene must have been what Bethesda had in mind with this game. Had about 9 people there from levels 39-139. The lower levels were clearing out the spawns and the higher levels were taking on the queen. We all got our shot in when she landed. After MANY resources were consumed and the queen was almost dead, the server crashed. I haven‚Äôt played since. I didn‚Äôt collect any loot since we were all fighting and from following this sub, it‚Äôs bad etiquette to do that. I‚Äôm never going to get those resources back nor am I going to get that loot that I worked hard to get. It‚Äôs disheartening to say the least. If we could automatically be connected to the previous server, at least we won‚Äôt come away empty handed. Such a rollercoaster of emotion from happiness of seeing the games potential to the reality that at any point it can go poof and you can come away with nothing. 
---
They don‚Äôt always explode, that‚Äôs the worst part about it. 9/10 they do but there‚Äôs that 1 time they just make you sit there waiting for it and it never comes 
---
I think this illustrates one of the reasons why it seems weird to have to spend three slots on the three cards.  Because the value provided by the perks does not seem equal to the costs of the perks.  Especially since there are safes and terminals in the game that can be picked or hacked without the perks (e.g., "Level Zero").  
---
Aside from a couple of quests where hacking or lockpicking makes completion of the question quicker, you don't really need Expert/Master for most of the content.  So, if I don't need these perks to enjoy most of the content, why should I have these cards?  
---
Personally, I've allotted an extra point to Perception and Intelligence just to have the ability to hack or lockpick at a basic level... But I also didn't plan to min/max in my other  SPECIALS.  (And I think that's the source of a lot of the contention.)

Eastern Penitentiary, West of the Grafton Dam.
---
That‚Äôs what makes them unique!
---
Yeah I was getting that part, but it went from a bunch of details to a steep drop off.  I missed the "sick grief."
---
Yeah, springs seem rare until you realize that clipboards have them - and there are usually a lot of clipboards scattered around (particularly at Sugar Grove and other locations similar to that).
---
Plastic is basically plastic bottles, but even a dinky plastic spoon counts for 1 whole plastic.
---
Support will change your tag if you provide a valid reason or maybe even if you don't.  A number of us did this on release when we realized our site login was going to be our in game name.
---
Come on Charleston Landfill!
---
Love it lol
---
You need to get a terminal for your garage door and put a level 3 lock on it to make it VIP.
---
You can get several each run through the desks in the military section of the Enclave. I stop in there on my way to vendor, usually get 3-4.
---
The enemies, I believe, are 5-10. I got my handmade plan on the patrol duty first time. Good luck friend!
---
 Not a ‚Äúduper or sympathizer of duper‚Äôs‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think this would be a good fix at all.  I earn most of my caps by doing cap stash runs, along the route I use there‚Äôs a possibility of 3 bobble heads and 2 magazines to spawn.  That said I have around 40-50 bobbleheads of various types, not to mention magazines.  So your grand idea is I have to scroll through 50+ lines of that stuff? 
---
But then the durability is like nothing 
---
I just skipped on investing into hacker.

(xbox) My experience was very similar. Liked the game, sure, it has it's bugs and glitchiness but they were tolerable 90% of the time. I was very optimistic for yesterday's update, everything on the patch notes seemed promising. Logging in with decent timed loading screen to an instant freeze, pipboy all black, camera views in all opposite directions, can't move and my CAMP is still rendering more than 5 minutes later (normally only a couple mins). Then while staring into my friends eyes, I try to invite to game but can't because it says my friend is on another "world". (never have seen that dialog before and certainly not while they are standing in front of me) Server change. Another 5 minute rendering time but no controls. Hard quit. Tried another world, teamed up... all was good, until... fissure prime. I was gallivanting around the Bog when it alerts an incoming nuke. Cool... we'll (team) run over and fight the Queen. Smooth sailing on the walk over.. my team of 3 and 3 others heading in... still smooth. BAM, another 8-10 people show up which were more than welcomed and all turns to a living hell. Screen is jumping all around. Can't see enemies until several seconds later, all the dead creatures are in a spinning circle for loot. I die, which I rarely do out there. I can't even pick up my dropped loot - just spins and spins. Die another several times because I can't see what is happening due to ridiculous lag. As I am walking away after my last respawn on the field, everything just clears to semi-normal. Mutations sometimes only granting negative effects. Go to work on CAMP, it is placing ghosted items that I couldn't get rid of. All kinds of small bugs - for every 1 bug before, I have 10 more. However, I never technically crashed or was booted from the game. Regardless, last night was the worst session of play since release of beta. 
---
Just to note, I was 627 down and 48 up for speed and hard lined to the router. 
---
Devolving. If they are turning to suiciders, they are devolving.
---
Ok thanks 
---
Right here, friend. While I appreciate the shoutout, I don't recall ever saying anything other than that it's highly unlikely they will ban based on their previous actions. It's probably safe to say that statement is now wrong given that they also started banning dupers and youtubers that made duping tutorials since I wrote that
---
Is it this one?  http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Prisoner_collar
---
Yeah, I hit my limit a couple of weeks after posting this. The game is just too broken. Even if they get around to fixing everything that's broke, it's still wildly unbalanced and largely incomplete. If I hear good things in a year or so, maybe I'll come back. Otherwise, I'm pretty much done. 
---
Rather that than people selling these legendary weapons for the ridiculous amounts they were before.
---
thank you 
---
Go through military wing desks each enclave trip. 2 minimum each time, usually 3 or 4.
---
Updated - thanks!

Agreed.  The cost of the cards and the benefit derived from the cards is not equal as currently implemented.  Yes, it is one thing to allocate an extra point to Perception or Intelligence to have the option to do Level 1 safes or terminals, even that isn't exactly worthwhile during the majority of game play.  Not when you may need to maximize the benefit from other perks because of end game content or other activities.
---
Really oh my bad, never really scrapped power armor.
---
Ok cool. I've only been in a blast zone once, but was pulling aggro and chucking grenades (maxed demo expert) 
---
Yeah, inventory sim is one of the things that I HATE about this game. I think they need to be reducing the time in inventory. Not adding to it with trivial cards that you have to swap out. My argument is that running around and ignoring dates and terminals is removing fallout mechanics from a fallout game. Which, personally, I enjoyed back when they actually contained things that were worth it. 
---
Does anyone know 
---
The details on how concentrated fire actually works?
---
Do you actually have to be in vats for the damage increase?
---
I am noticed more often when I'm in PA. My non-PA armor is stealth focused, and I rarely get spotted before I have a chance to get chameleon running.
---
I can describe how they accessed the devroom and how to, it's not rocketscience, but Bethesda already had this kinda-anticheat from the start, it's just that the bans weren't instantaneous or they just lucked out.
---
After new patch, that doesn't work anymore.  You only get a little health back now and most of the rads stay
---
And why do they shoot at my damn plants?
---
Everytime I think I found the perfect spot, I find something better
---
That's good to know.  I'm not sure I've ever come across Grape Nuka-Cola in the wild.
---
What he meant was having mutations and starched genes.  When you are under the effects of radix or rad away full strength it suppresses your mutations buffs and debuffs.  As if you don't have them until it wears off.
---
I bought the marine helmet not that long ago thinking it was a rare drop from a vendor bot. Then I saw that everyone on this sub told me I was going to get banned for even looking at it's splendor, so in a panic I scrapped it, now I have the plans to make it. Am I going to be banned? If so, that's pretty fucking ridiculous.  
---
I feel a lot of the anger towards these dev room items and the people who have them is just misdirected frustration towards a pretty messed up economy of goods. Not everyone who has these items are hacking dupers, as not everyone who bought a TSE at some point somehow is "cheating" or "ruining" the game for others. The rarity of goods and the imbalance its causing in the player base is pretty depressing to watch.  
---
Also why the fuck is the helmet not even available? The hunter's hood? How does that create instability? 
---
And the loot from lvl 2/3 safes is awful.
---
I don't keep them on unless there's a door in my way.
---
Thanks for posting!  The mission of this guide is to help players know what to hold onto and what not to.  For legendaries that's based on what is currently trading in the reddit marketplaces.  So whether TSEs are overrated or not, they sell - which is why they are noted here.  If there are other affixes/weapon types missing from the list that sell quickly for good $ please do post them and I'll add.  Thanks again!
---
Will that stop the huge damage that a TSE could hit you with on accident?  Are there dense mods for all pieces of armor or just the chest plate? 
---
It's up to you. 
---
I've done it both ways. I actually prefer to be a nomad, but it's hard to give up a good spot when you find one. 
---
I wish we could have a main base and like a tent and stash and workshop you could travel with separate from that. 
---
But left trigger again brings it up to max that‚Äôs how I discovered it 
---
Tormentor is one of the most useless perks that have ever existed, hes using explosive weapons so crippling is a non issue also 3 points for 15% chance of crippling a limb id rather choose a perk that increases my dps 
---
I think the enemy level in patrol duty was 28 ish. Im level 150something.
---
Took me a long time to get the patrol duty event to show up, I think it helped doing the falsely accused quest first (wear prisoner collar, fast travel to wavy willards, run west till you get to an intersection, may need to server hop).
---
After that, I got it after my second or third patrol duty event. Before that, I only did patrol duty less than 5 times because it would never show up for me (the times I did it prior to completing falsely accuse, Im assuming another player was around the jail and spawned the event)
---
My camp had a similar bug.   Could not place a wire because I had apparently used up my camp budget.     The budget indicated I had plenty left but the little graph showed it with white at each end like yours does.  
---
I scraped all my stored stuff and it still did not work.  Then I scrapped 1 turret and was able to build again.    This was also on a PS4.   
---
Still makes it jump to max, that‚Äôs how I discovered it 
---
theres a social tab/option on the main menu
---
Well, I've never had to resort to that because I just take any duct tape and Wonderglue I come across.  It's certainly an option though.
---
Like chzaplx says, Anglers drop quite a bit of "Excess Adhesive" too.
---
Oh yes. Don't worry about that. I also now get PA head lamp when not in PA. Which, after the update, means a small circle of things that are too bright to be seen clearly, surrounded by things that are too dark to be seen clearly.
---
You need to say that out loud, then remember what sub you‚Äôre in. Lol. Joking aside, throwing away your garbage in a fallout game is pretty much literally throwing away your time spent. These games are all about hoarding for me. My fallout residence is ALWAYS a dump. 
---
PS4 player here, and last night the best experience connection wise I have had yet. Well done on this patch.
---
That‚Äôs cute as fuck. Some families go to Disneyland to have a good time and others go to the hellish post nuclear wasteland of fallout. I‚Äôd love to roleplay an NPC companion for hire for groups like that. 
---
You can usually at least in fallout 4 you can mod weapons that come in both rifles and pistols to switch between them
---
Stick to the greens. They don't spawn often. I'm level 140 and I only finished it the other day.  But the high level players will usually run a circuit from the golf club, through the apartments, into maintenance. So ghouls on the edges on the green should be lower level.
---
It‚Äôs extremely efficient if that‚Äôs how you play, I don‚Äôt mine or collect ore it has no use to me. Believe it or not everyone has their own way of enjoying this game, that‚Äôs why I told him to do it if he *wants* to, but thanks for the input you might not be able to tell but I really appreciate it 
---
i like my slow baseball hat just for base ball jokes
---
Someone tried this on me while I was trying to offload my flux from a day before. My flux spoiled as I had to wait for his dumbass because when I left the vendor to see what the fuck he was up to he took control from me. I spent the entire afternoon making sure he regretted that. Be patient.
---
It's just the PR talk, nothing to grasp from that statement really.
---
yeah same
---
I think even if you have pacifist mode on, you should still be able to kill bounties.
---
Ya i dunno on that part. Seemed pretty standard to me 
---
Always stay along the right wall and it will lead you down to the Wendigo.

Top 10 Twilight Zone episodes
---
1. Platform Xbox One.
---
2. GT: Rickstar 1984
---
3. Game breaking issue, making the game literally unplayable.  
---
4. As I load into the game, I sit through the famously long fallout load screens only to load in and get one of two messages on my screen.   
---
a. first message: "you have been disconnected from the server."  
---
b. second variant: your c.a.m.p. could not be placed etc. etc. \[click ok\] followed by the message, "You have been disconnected from the server."
---
5. This was the case for over an hour of trying to log in last night, I finally got fed up and quit trying.
---
6. Tried again this morning as I was getting ready for work, the result was the same.
---
7. (Me assuming it's my internet connection) tried logging into another game with well known server issues, and logged in in the regular manner with no issue.  
---
Note: I'm a level 59,  I have a carry weight of approximately 950lbs. I am a trader in the game (my roleplay) so i'm often over encumbered. I gather all my wares through scavenging and combat. I walk all over the map as Fallout is a survival game, I essentially force myself to play "hardcore survival" by not allowing myself to have the ability to fast travel. 
---
I don't have a ticket yet as I haven't gone to bethesda officially for support. I was hoping to get some information, see if there was an issue on my end, get theories etcetera. If an actual Bethesda employee see this and helps that's even better. 
---
Thanks to anyone who can help with this issue
---
I've been in the same general area since like week 2 of the game.  I moved a bit "down the road" after finding a resource  node after a few weeks.   and have been in that spot for about a month now.   This weekend I'm going to move to "recenter" my camp area but in the same location so that I have less dead space. I love my camp and my current spot.  I rarely have my spot taken (despite the resource) and its fairly quiet. Nothing wrong with sticking to a spot you really enjoy. 
---
they're great for that =P 
---
Abbie's bunker has a terminal entry that triggers the quest line.
---
Thank you everyone for your inputs the information was very helpful :)
---
i've been server hoping multiple times this morning looking for Patrol Duty. Over the past week, I've run it 4 times and still haven't got the Handmade plan. I've got different weapon plans each time, just not the one I want. It's a pretty easy event at least. Just wish server hopping didn't take this long.
---
I call that the Minigun Syndrom.
---
Initial load times for me seem to be about the same, load in and can't do much for 5-10 seconds, then it will load in some random mole rats/protectrons/ghouls to start attacking my camp and then the camp starts to fill in. 
---
What I did notice for me was significantly faster load times when fast traveling. It is probably about half of the time it used to take. This is on a ps4 pro w/SSD.
---
I haven't had any blue screens yet, but 15 minutes into my first game post patch I had it freeze up for 20 seconds, then disconnected me and rolled everything back about 5 minutes. Was fine for the hours of playing after that.
---
Now if they could just make it so that people in my party don't show up naked we might be in business!
---
Saving my atoms for when that sexy Manta Man costume drops.

Not to bad man, very nice looking.

I hope they figure out a way that will make every illegally obtained weapon/gear/etc. just simply disappear.
---
.......and this weeks weekly challenge (Xbox) is kill 30 robots with a protest sign lol üòÇ
---
Yeah I got a legendary handmade that does more damage to scorched, so I put a scorched killing receiver on it too and was like yeah this is going to be amazing.  It barely damages scorched and does nothing to scorchbeasts.
---
This youtube video shows the 3 table variations you get with high-tech table plan.  Jump to 2:15 mark in video to see the 3 tables.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0lYxa0SKfY
---
You need the Prime Receiver plan. Occasionally you will find them at vendors and they are also a mob drop. The SBQ is your best bet to farm prime plans.
---
I have a lovely spot and I keep looking for new place but I guess there‚Äôs no place like home because I haven‚Äôt moved in 3 weeks.  (I‚Äôve been camped at a pond on a hillside in the NW )
---
&gt;How is this armor anything more than cosmetic?
---
If you think there aren't at least some people who use things purely for cosmetic reasons, you're wrong.
---
You could make the same argument that several types of armor in this game are pointless, if you're only basing that statement on the comparative statistics.
---
Well then, my bad! üòâ
---
Ugh yeah - i feel like they could have and still could do much more
---
I am a PS4 player and played for over 4 hours with zero disconnects. 
---
I'll never forget the time I got mauled by a scorched deathclaw while trading with the Harper's Ferry vendor. I didn't even know deathclaws could spawn there and I haven't seen one since.
---
"I didn't believe it until it happened to me." Joined my first queen fight just now. And had my first queen fight disconnect right as she was about to die. (And then, of course, you get to reconnect right next to two fissures.)
---
It's very discouraging. 
---
True that, I try to only use it (but it's difficult sometimes when I carry a full set of every PA and they are all called Power Armour Chassis). At least resistance wise it is worth using, kinda seems like they won't even be adding the jetpack in the future though:/ 
---
Id use the 3 points on Agility for thruhiker instead of the sandman and adren.  
---
Get bloodymess in Luck 
---
Because that's how I feel about this towards Bethesda
---
Haha. Only someone that uses tsundere as a term for a person would consider saying ‚Äúb-baka‚Äù  ya fucking weab lol. 
---
My ‚Äúwhinge‚Äù is my own. The fact it‚Äôs tagged as ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù is why I want peoples thoughts. 
---
I so you feel so quite personally attacked. But I promise, I do not give a fuck. ;)
---
I was farming patrol duty and leveling up a new character to farm vendors, it was just easier to buy it off reddit. Farming stable flux to sell and doing cap runs is a lot more fun for me. 
---
I just sold three 1\* axes that came from the same nuke zone. I think there's another post that explains the legendary drops are specific to the server. If one TS drops, stick around and you will find more. It also seems like the type of weapon and armor is specific to the server as 3 Grognak's in one clearing of Whitesprings seems like crazy luck.
---
Yeah not worth having it as a main power armor, just worth having it in the stash for gathering quick materials with it after you have a lot of acid.
---
Yup makes you not want to play this game.
---
Thanks for the note, added to the older list and will be included in the next update
---
Am i the only one that never switches up their perk cards?
---
I moved mine a quite a bit at first as I learned the what and where in the game. Then moved it again around level 60 and then again at level 115. I'll likely stay where I am now - unless something changes. 
---
I think you can only find the Cherry and Quantum variants in the wild. The soda jerk has several flavors with different benefits. You can buy only one at a time though. 
---
I'm not sure if your comment is directed at me? I never said anything about duping and I didn't delete your comment. It's still there, just not visible because it's been downvoted so many times. Probably because it was irrelevant to the question. Smh.
---
lol then someone over there owes me a couple dollars ;)
---
Yeah it's the prisoner's collar.  I like to wear it under my (otherwise crippled) Nuka Girl outfit because it makes the inside of her helmet blink like it's powered up.
---
Only if one gave a shit intruding. 
---
myself am 1 or 2 lvls off 200 and in that uranium fever event on PC I have never ever seen anyone troll. I think every person I have come across does this. Shares the 3 stars. Recently I went into an area and was looking for leg spawns, I heard someone else arrive and when I actually found a leg I yelled out in voice chat he came running over to get a hit on it, then we were chatting away while in different parts of the instance and whenever either would find a leg we'd share. The truth is most of the time in the open world the more people around the more leg mobs spawn because more mobs spawn as other people arrive. So you may as well be nice and you'll probably be treated nice in return later
---
Not that far. You should still have to have the perk but them along with crafting ones should be passively active.
---
I have 2/3 bloody mess right now. I could drop 1 point in lucky break to max it though.
---
wait, this is the same game a buch of bearded men in dresses ran by me chasing a naked main a witches hat and a guitar sword right?
---
ok.  I bought up the original duping in BETA and everyone called me a liar.  So, I'll tell you this, there are forums for security and exploits, if you look on there, they have a lot of exploits.  I've been reporting them to Bethseda, but haven't received a response.  I'm not a cheater, just interested in it (I work professional in computer security, specially, software; I'm a bounty hunter.)
---
A friend and I on the PS4 played for about 4 hours last night with zero issues on the PS4.

Of course, I am everyone‚Äôs friend! Just so you have them both right.

Have fun out there and be safe.
---
Thanks! Also I think my Todd page gone meme'd by everyone :D
---
Nope. I've done this several times. I hope I remember next time.
---
I‚Äôm not dismissing the value/role of cosmetic gear - I often run around in a suit (business or clown depending on the occasion) but this set of armor falls far short as, well, armor.  I‚Äôm hoping they plan to do something with it in a future expansion.   I feel that far too much of this game is centered on weapons right now.  (Especially TSE crap). 
---
Hmm. Are robots considered creatures? Could you tame a robot?
---
Is it hard to "recenter" a CAMP?  I recently noticed there's a resource node at mine which seems to be slightly beyond the boundary because it won't let me build an extractor there... either that or I don't have the plans to build such things, even though I can at Workshops...
---
I agree and honestly I just pass them up if I have to use a perk. Not worth the time.
---
Maybe there should be some sort of system where you can submit issues directly to the support team. Like some sort of ticket system where they can judge the urgency and help people one-on-one with the issue directly through their Bethesda account ü§î
---
yeah...like a SBQ fight...
---
I'm your huckleberry, I think PA armor looks silly, ALL of them, these big clunky terribly designed exoskeletons look like something from a Japanese manga, no thanks, ill stick to the other armors 
---
Would've been better to tie them to certain specials as a passive ie level 3 in intel give you 1 passive skill in hack. then it grows again at a next step the more points you dump into the perk. Thats as far as lock picking and hacking. For crafting I think thats fine the way it is. It's nice to have points in crafting, but isn't necessary.
---
Or forget.  Like oops i forgot to put on hard bargain and lost a few caps on my sale.  Then equip it for the rest.  Then forget travel agent to the next vendor.  Then i give up and skip travel agent.  Or should i skip hard bargain?  Man i need an excel sheet to make the decision.
---
you can make more at a chem bunch. need the same materials
---
I like this
---
This happened to me in beta haha 
---
Yes. I have noticed that once the 2nd loading screen is complete, I don't have to wait for the game to load in while I stand there immobilized. I like it.
---
This is one of the big things keeping me from even trying 76. The addition of plans and cards makes the RNG progression of 4 worse by many orders of magnitude. You can't even do upgrades unless you find these plans.
---
It's one of those things that makes me believe perk card packs were originally possible lootbox stuff, then they backtracked on it once BF2's shitshow happened.
---
Form/function "balance", perhaps? Excavator PA is the best PA yet it's ugly as fuck and there were no skin for it.
---
More like ‚Äúflap flap flap‚Äù
---
Any ideas where you have find the Halucinigen gas and a stealth boy? I had only just got them through the quest
---
It‚Äôs surprisingly easy to find the supplies the hardest being a hallucigen canister. Google common hallucigen locations and I‚Äôm sure you will find one with a bit of serverhopping.
---
Yup that's it! Thanks.
---
The thing is it's just tedious as fuck to have to swap in just to pick a lock or hack a terminal for a minute, then swap back. There's no combat situation whatsoever where you need crafting and hacking perks. So why not just make them passive?
---
I‚Äôm still near white spring train station there‚Äôs a small patch to build bc I‚Äôm too lazy to walk anywhere
---
Never said a single thing about crashes.
---
ok; just like there wasn't any proof of the original duping ;)
---
I've been reporting the issues to Bethseda, but haven't receive a response.  I could make a youtube documenting it, but that would mean making it publicly and would give cheaters more ways to cheat.  Typically in this industry you want to give companies 90 days before going public with security issues.  If they don't patch it in 90 days or give me an response I'll make them public. (technically they are already public on some forums, if you know were to look, but it's no on gamer forums ;))
---
Check your stored tab..
---
Gah. I've done that site a dozen times and never picked one up. I will now! Thanks.
---
Can you use the brotherhood's air to ground missile on SBQ?
---
yes but from I've heard people are trying to sell it for 5000 plus caps. which is something I am no where even close to being able to afford
---
There's the weight dimension, I guess. Helpful if you've got the chameleon mutation. 
---
I'm carrying around the legendary chest piece because I can't think of anyone who might want it who doesn't already have it. 
---
Prayers offered to you and your family. I love playing with my son on this game, and I glad you have some memories to carry with you.
---
There's a crafter that will make every type of armor mod, BYOM. She has no armor mods for X-01, so I assume there are no plans available, as she has everything else.
---
If u have the one that looks like a diving mask then no, otherwise yes
---
I feel your pain. I've had pretty much identical experiences for the past week or so. The disconnects and outright crashes have gone through the roof for me, and I have not been able to figure out a solution to mitigating them. I've disconnected or crashed out of literally every nuke zone since the latest PC patch. It's starting to really aggravate me.
---
Enclave bunker sells once you complete quest line
---
Very cool have to try this
---
The accuracy isn't great in VATS, but I've had no issues when aiming down the sights.
---
Farming mothman eggs?  Well, it explains why he's so angry with me.
---
Radium rifle is only ever good for PvP and only 50% (I think) is actual damage, the rest is just radiation which ultimately effects nothing.
---
Do you have a handmade? There as good as you're gonna get as far as rifles are concerned.
---
You could honestly do that with a CAMP. Just find a van somewhere and put some letters on the side. I would also add that I would use one of the mascot heads instead of the PA helmet. 
---
I was hunting a wanted player last night.  Crept up and started blasting with TSE Handmade from 10yds.  At first I thought "he must be built anti-explosive, going to be a tough one", then when I realized he was taking NO damage I thought "God damn cheater!!!!!"and slunk away.  He followed me but did not attack.  "He must want me to clear his wanted status, what am I doing wrong?" 
---
....then, I realized that my dumb ass had Pacifist turned on.
---
I was one time throwing orbital strikes at the SBQ and I think someone went in front of me, long story short I killed myself and spawned straight away. My bag was sitting there with the loading thing and I had to watch as some guy took all my good junk and I couldnt do anything about it. Just junk i suppose but was still a crappy feeling
---
to everyone commenting ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not having any crashes‚Äù...I never said anything about crashes...y‚Äôall replying to the wrong post or something. I‚Äôm saying new bugs and errors that I never previously experienced. And ones that have existed and still haven‚Äôt been fixed.
---
Perhaps instead they need to make it more difficult to change your perks out, only allow players to do it at Stash boxes.
---
Taking a perk should be a deliberate choice, it should come at the expense of not taking something else. Right now that is not the case for many of the utility perks.

If Bethesda caves and gives us the lockpick/hacker perks as passive then what? Lead Belly is no different, in fact most of the non-combat perks can often be selectively equiped only when they are needed and then swapped back for pure damage perks. So what would be the reason not to make them all passives?
---
Should we go down this route perk builds will become incredibly dull, we'd all be effectively the same character. With largely the same skills and all running damage perks and weight reduction perks because thats the only thing left to perk for.

I moved mine by the bbq shack in the middle for 3 reasons one it‚Äôs a nice overlook over the creek(also the small cliff gives my turrets some help) and two it is close by a good source for food and wood, and three since I‚Äôm in the middle teleports aren‚Äôt too expensive.
---
Clever. I currently have a legendary pitchfork in my stash I'm saving in the hopes I can some day make a ghetto aquaman-esque transmog. 
---
Wouldn't you have failed if they never showed up anyway? Aren't you just complaining for no reason? What would have changed to make you defeat her if they never showed up? 
---
I've been in the same spot for six weeks.  And I play waaaay too much.
---
I'm actually wearing a piece of wood armor, mainly because it's life saving, but also for the shrouded effect. 
---
It can take about 2 direct hits, then it breaks. 
---
Jefe, do you even know what a plethora is? 
---
How do you know this?
---
Maybe if there actually was millions of player and meaningful content, it would make sense, but right now... Pointless.
---
Was talking about the monster that is there at every hop.
---
Not for free. A player could still need 5 perception to use level one lockpicking for example.
---
The answer is yes........it was rhetorical.
---
There‚Äôs one at fissure site prime I always grab when doing runs
---
Please cite specific examples of the same person telling a story about griefing someone and then later complaining about being griefed by being attacked.
---
Or hell, the same individual commenting on posts in the same way. You can't just go by upvotes because you don't know who is playing them.
---
We're not all the same person, you know?
---
As long as you have completed the quest that unlocks them  you don't actually need any to finish the questline.... but they are craftable at a tinker bench under Buffs.  If you need/ want any help on getting more DM me. I know reliable spawns for both stealth boys and hallucigen gas.
---
With fibre glass and dense mod my scout armor chest has ballistic resists on par with a heavy combat armor chest with BOS and dense mod. Its also much lighter. Even a weightless Heavy Combat with the same mods is only 2lb lighter.    
---
No legendary potential is disappointing its true.      
---
However, with the right build you can practically wear no armor at all and still be competitive. No need to min/max resists when the only enemy that's actually challenge is the queen.     
---
Style is everything though.    
---
I got a troubleshooters lever action off a legendary deathclaw last nite. 290 damage with rifleman perks. Need a hardened reciever for it to up damage some more. Is this reciever available?
---
Oh cool, just started that quest line! Thanks man
---
I'm not quite sure. Those two names were different than the people that I met earlier.
---
It does go along with their MO.... and they said their group was far larger than what I saw.
---
I have read elsewhere that you can find it in a container in the prison. 
---
Same here, friend.  I've seen no change.
---
Maybe it's just me but the current situation with game economy and playability says differently 
---
Lol it's been fantastic watching this "peace loving friendly community" suddenly get a justice hate boner for victims of trades, giveaways or looting. 
---
The games broken as fuck, move on.
---
Try crafting your own and modding them.  You can create new weapons at like... 10, 20, 30, even if they are the same types.  They have increased damage.  Same with armors and increased defense.
---
There is no proof that 100 of a stackable item causes more strain than 10 of that same item. The overwhelming majority of what I have stored are stackable items.
---
You seem to have missed the issue that I have no reason to play if I can no longer pick anything up.
---
Who says I'm never going to use what I pick up?
---
Nope, the Handmade is a automatic rifle or?
---
My Perk Cards are not automatic guns XD
---
&gt; You configure these tabs and whatever "mode" you are in you can just click the tab and all the cards specific for that tab are activated. 
---
You had me until this point. There should be a limited amount of utility cards you can equip that doesn't affect your combat card slots and you shouldn't need to switch back and forth.
---
I'd say you're 2 points too high in STR but overall it seems good for a non-VATS build. I find strong back to be worthless, you're better off maxing traveling pharmacy and pack rat and move the extra 2 points into sneak if you're using covert operative. 
---
Also... find someone to make you deep pockets on your armor for +50 carry weight.
---
UPON THY GOLDEN HORSE I SHALL JUDGE AND SMITE THEE!
---
Two shot increases spread and recoil, it's a poor choice for longer range weapons. You'd be much better off with instigating or furious depending on what kind of weapon it is in that scenario
---
Thanks for the tag. I will certainly add this to the investigation. u/JamesFlour, would you be able to PM me your BethesdaNet UN if you're on PC or your Gamertag/PSN ID if you're on console so we can look into it? Thanks again!
---
Well I am a lawyer during the day so I usually demand a source for any claim. A go fish via Google will usually mean that i just ignore the claim. No offense just saying that details are everwhere about the fist duping methods, the artillery or the mass board dumping.
---
Again not saying there are no knew methods, just that I have not seen them yet. Kind of like God(s).
---
Level 50 Combat Knife with Vampirism, thoroughly awesome from levels 50-125 with suitable perks
---
That should be the description for PvP in this game.
---
Did you drink some Rad-X by accident? I've done this several times.
---
Game has been crashing way more (on PS4) after the update. Not a fan of the loading screen that loads another loading screen when loading into the world and fast traveling either. ‚ÄúImproved stability‚Äù my ass
---
He's been quite engaging and raising valid points. All you've done to retort is say his position is invalid because you disliked a phrased he used that had no bearing on his retort while offering no counterpoints.
---
The game allows you to swap out skills, so one could say the game has the option of being played as a minmax/allinone. In a game so focused on combat, it doesn't make sense to not maximize your damage. Do you think the scorch beast is going to be impressed with my level 2 lock picking or do you think I'd be better equipped to have some sort of damage increasing perk instead?  
---
I believe the system they have now would work better if lockpicking and hacking werent cardable but passively learned. Wanna get better at lockpicking? Prepare to break a ton of bobbypins. Wanna get into that terminal? Expect to get locked out a bunch!  
---
I would love to hear your side on why you think the current system doesn't need any changing. 
---
Watoga has level 20s that I'm aware of
---
That is how I acquired my handmade and LA plans. I just got tired of Patrol duty. 
---
I love that idea!

I can‚Äôt wait for that owl mask tho . I‚Äôll buy atoms for that. 
---
My understanding of the chameleon mutation is that your armor must have the Weightless legendary mod for the mutation to work.   I got (and kept) chameleon when I was farming Marsupial but it never kicks in because I‚Äôve only found one piece of crappy weightless armor.  
---
It would be cool if we could find plans for the Little things, like teddy bears or Food items. Maybe they could be rare or they could be learned from scrapping. 
---
thats my 2 cents anyway 
---
This game fucking sucks
---
Just grab it. If somebody doesn't come back in a few minutes they're probably not intending on coming back. It is considered rather rude to swarm like vultures on a dead person's loot, but in all honesty it is fair game as soon as they die
---
Then how would using this demote hopping? Wouldn't it promote it? XD Bc it's there at every hop? Am I just dense now a d not getting it? 
---
I thought rad x was ok to use? I thought it was just rad away that cures it? 
---
I...did not know that! Thanks for the tip!
---
Negative. I have three of them. They can't be scrapped. Can't put them into a container because they don't show up on the list but when I look in pipboy they are there. Not only that. I just killed myself to get them to drop. Opened pipboy and they are still there. 2.4 LBS !!!! FFS .. That space is vital. People are gonna be picking these up to try scrapping them for the sport challenge. 
---
I was wondering around yesterday. And i stumbled across a place that had like 6 of the gas canisters lying around in a pile out in the open. And i said to myself "i nees to remember this place so i can come back and farm these"......
---
I forgot where it was. 
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate because I like game where you can switch it on the fly by just using one or the other
---
After going through the brief bit you shared. I‚Äôve gotta say, I like it. The drawings are awesome and some of the notes are funny and very spot on. Nice work üëçüèª
---
Anything on the ground in paper bags is free for all immediately as per legit game mechanics.
---
Agree with all apart from one row per legi would only mildly affect dupers.have you seen their inventorys? üòÅ
---
They are viable. You won't eat scorch beast like big guns but you can do good work. I run a Max luck VATS critical build. I don't have any astounding guns but if you do it right you can chew through enemies. I have a two shot black powder pistol that deals out over 500 dmg. Combine that with with VATS criticals and a sneak attack you can mess stuff up. My explosive 44 does around 300 dmg. 
---
If you get good pipe legendaries you can squeeze huge damage because they count as a pistol and rifle. 
---
I haven't done it yet myself but I think I am going to just move my camp to a completely different spot then move it back to where I want it.  Trying to fine tune it while stuff exists in the current location seemed like a pain in the ass.  As long as a resource node is fully within your camp boundaries you will be able to craft the extractor for that node.  No plans required. 
---
agreed
---
There was no ‚Äúsick grief‚Äù the 2h this guy wasted on obtaining hard mass from me I could of obtained from dropping 2 nukes at white spring .... it turns out I griefed him and his friends of there time.
---
I agree - the only difference to having passive QoL perks passive all the time and swapping them out is the same thing.  The latter just is more annoying and game flow breaking.  Make qol perks passive...only thing I can figure out that would fix this issue.
---
Your budget must be insanely high.
---
If anything I didn‚Äôt experience a single crash last night as opposed to a random crash here or there. My friend on the other hand, who has been a recipient of many a duped item, couldn‚Äôt walk more than a meter before his game would just completely lock up.
---
Not sure if you are referring to crashes. 
---
But I‚Äôve been getting a lot of blue screen flashes since I started playing Fallout. I was blaming the game. But since I switched games, it‚Äôs occurring in them as well. It would appear this is a known PS4 issue when you have your controller connected using a third party usb cable.  
---
Or they could just make it where you need the highest single perk card for both lockpicking and hacking equipped at any given time to unlock all locks and hack all terminals. I feel like that could be even easier to implement than making them passive, at least. (Why does a master need to know how to specifically pick shitty locks when they can already pick the best ones?)
---
Right now I have no viable armor to wear. I was thinking of getting a set together so I can take advantage of leaded + 3/3 fire proof, because really I kill myself more than anything.
---
I use excavator with 2x calibrated shocks for normal grinding and x-01 with 2x shocks for nuke zones. This is also why I have 13 int, to help offset the fusion core weight.
---
Rad-X suppresses mutations (good and bad) for the duration of the Rad-X. I popped one in a nuked Whitesprings and found out the hard way I couldn't jump higher any more.
---
Oh come on,that cannot be the reason.Otherwise they'd never make a handmade,combat shotgun,gatling gun skin because they're the overall best of their class.  Something tells me these two PA are new and they simply didn't code them to be able to have skins 'yet'. I hope so.
---
There is usually some tech data in the desks at the bunker. No need to lockpic 
---
Yea I keep it in my inventory just in case I need the +300 carry weight and to mine lead and steel.
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary, block B, all the way to the end. Pervert
---
this is a great idea.

---
Apologies, maybe i didn't expressed myself properly, i mean hopping as a mechanic for getting stuff should be phased out as it is certainly not a fun way to obtain stuff.
---
El Guapo, I know that I, Jefe, do not have your superior intellect and education, but could it be that once again, you are angry at something else, and are looking to take it out on me?
---
Well, you just told me that I had a plethora, and I would just like to know if you know what it means to have a plethora. I would not like to think that someone would tell someone else he has a plethora, and then find out that that person has no idea what it means to have a plethora.
---
I think it just points out, again, the problems with PvP in this game. 
---
There ought to be pacifist servers. 
---
&gt; I am not that high level, only 125 but I have definitely noticed lower levels being hesitant around me.
---
This has to do with the type of the game.
---
For example, in EVE Online, if I see someone heading towards me in null sec, it is never good news. I never had them pop up, and jettison some faction blueprints for me, and wave me goodbye. What does happen is, I get pointed, and a second later a gang of their buddies jump into the system. So a player heading towards you is bad, very, very bad. Run.
---
On the other hand, something like Elder Scrolls Online - the loot (even world loot) is instanced to player, and there's no world PvP outside of a very specific area, which is also instanced (you have to join it from the menu, you can't just ride or run into it). So a player coming towards you is a non-event. 
---
Also, given the state of the game, being approached by another player is a problem, if they exploit and stack bobbleheads and such, and just 1-shot you even through slap damage. Which, by itself, is pretty asinine, because unflagged players should be capped at 5% HP damage MAX, regardless of how much damage you have coming in. And since you drop stuff, AND people can pick up your stuff without even being flagged if they didn't attack you, but you WILL be flagged if you try to get it back? Again, just crap design. And in a game with crap design, it's best to avoid other players entirely. *Especially* if you can't properly communicate with them (not everyone has a mic, and there's still no text chat). Just no point.
---
Bottom line, in this game, another player is seldom good news. At the minimum, you'll be competing for world loot. And if there's a level discrepancy (we're talking lvl 22 and lvl 122), enemy spawning will become an issue. If enemies spawn for lvl 22, lvl 122 won't he happy. And if enemies spawn for lvl 122, lvl 22 won't be happy. In both cases, one of the players will get loot from kills that is  going to be useless for them (because it's too low level, or too high level, and stash space is limited). 
---
Bottom-bottom line, the game is poorly designed. Too many systems punish for being around other players, especially high level ones. And that's IF those players are benign. If they are hostile, it's even worse. 
---
They can be single fire, it's the receiver that matters. If you have an alt which is around 15-25, visit Harpers and Watoga vendors :) If you're above those levels, go to the Regional Penitentiary and grind the 'Patrol Duty' event specifically. You can server hop until you find it and you can trigger the events just by running half-way down the road towards the front door.
---
It might be a little dumber the way I do it, but I simply don't swap cards. I'm still at a lower level, so I don't worry as much about optimizing my character, but I just leave crafting and lockpicking perks equipped. In my mind, this has some similarity to what I could've done in Skyrim, where you can sneak around in your underwear and just pop into heavy armour when you need to fight and noise doesn't matter. 
---
Anyways, in my mind it's more of an "obvious exploit" to swap cards out, rather than leave them in all the time. You can't pause the game and some crafting cards have other benefits, so I believe they were intended to be left in. However, it's silly to put players in that predicament in the first place. 
---
I'm on Ps4. Have this problem as well. It's been like this for a while now. sadly.
---
 R E A L
---
Having to swap out the cards and having them always just passive is essentially the same thing.  You just have to swap then out...it's a needless game flow breaking step because everyone eventually has all the perks..  I just say make all QoL perks passive.  Only thing I can think of.
---
It's a remake of a 70's series.
---
Sounds like my sneaky stealth no PA pistols build is going to save me some headache time.
---
I found a node once and built a C.A.M.P. there but when I logged back in, it had gone and I couldn't remember where it was. But I like where I am now, node or no more.
---
I agree all the way, but I came here to say that metal armor has plenty of colors in game, based on the mod on it. Painted = orange, and there are other colors as well. 
---
I love tanking for lower levels like that.... In my Mr. Fuzzy costume.
---
I know afterwards they're just sitting there laughing saying "WTF- LOL".
---
Oh great ty. I‚Äôll look out for it
---
Jefe wasn't no dummy!
---
Ah, yes, I agree. I don't like the rng when it comes to purchasing stuff from the vendors. I think it's a cheap way to keep ppl playing. Rng is fine for the other aspects of the game, like loot drop.
---
How so with the new patch?
---
Give them enough time and they will do have proper tools, well I hope so.
---
Good point about the right build helping with resists/armor.  I‚Äôm part-way through reassigning some points into strength for the blocker perk card for that reason. 
---
I joked about needing 50 gb of free space for this patch on PS4 and got downvoted to the center of the earth, but lo and behold...
---
My pet mirelurk king keeps killing the ones that spawn.  But I'm not killing Jim Morrison.  Someone already murdered Jimi Hendrix (sloth) and Jimmy Page (deathclaw)  
---
If you aren't using Rad-X, then probably a bug. I'd test reapplying it, if it was convenient.
---
Platform? 
---
Both my friends I play with didn't either.  Cause when you go to the crafting screen those low level items just say "level 1" or "level 5" but if you select them, it gives you the option to craft even higher level versions.  At the expense of more materials.
---
Word of advice, at higher levels, the low level armors will require Ballistic Fibers or such to repair.  It's best to just scrap the item and craft/mod a brand new one.  Doesn't require the fiber to make, which is rare for lower level people.
---
Many times you just scrap out your broken junk and then make new ones until you get to the really good stuff.
---
It‚Äôs 15-19, not 20
---
Agree but it‚Äôs not ALL dark humor, there‚Äôs plenty of light humor throughout fallout as well, in addition to the dark humor
---
Can I be cousin Mose?
---
Constant crashing worse than ever. Not fixing small bugs and adding new ones. Just look at the new posts on this reddir
---
Some of the event quests are a pain without high tier lockpick/hacking.
---
For example the powering up Poseidon power plant quest. All but 1 entrance is locked behind a level 3 terminal. So you have to take a long roundabout path to get into the plant, and that same long roundabout path to get out if you don't have level 3 hacking. Real pain in the ass.
---
Hey all,
---
We're working on this list and are aiming to have it put together soon. As soon as we have it, we will post it to our official forums and on reddit, potentially on our website as well. 
---
A great feature would be to allow players to have two or three "profiles" of preset perk combinations that would be easy to switch among in the PipBoy, IMO!
---
looks like fun, wheres the exact spot?
---
Appreciate the offer, but I'm on the PC version.
---
Gatling- "give it a spin"
---
üòï im more disappointed I laughed.
---
Whenever she lands just lay it on her.
---
Its only a bloodied lvl 50 gatling. Not really modded. 
---
But she's pretty hard to miss and 250 consecutive hits adds up
---
Great drop but BiS this is not
---
In other words, if you want a reaction hit them in the wallet.
---
It‚Äôs inside the prisons, everywhere
---
I'm guessing you don't know how this fight works. The more people that are there, the stronger the Queen gets. 
---
PS4
---
No screens needed
---
I just want clarity im losing my mind otherwise.
---
WHY on earth is there a time after scoped in and shooting a hunting rifle where your completly defenseless, cannot move,shoot or jump? Your literally freezing for a second. This is by far the most annoying thing since i started. love the snipers but this shit makes it horrible. Is it intended or a bug? I HATE IT SO MUCH. I want to be able to shoot and immediatly run. the time i freeze is enough for enemies to kill me. 
---
If you're looking for a wendigo, I don't know if it's a random spawn but I killed one in Carrahan Estate 
---
ived daisycuttered some people and it did practicaly no damage at all, not even remotely close
---
No, pa mods don‚Äôt work like that
---
This makes me want to scrap my own camp and actually work on it for a few hours.
---
If we as a collective stop buying the crap, they will stop implementing them.
---
Speak with your wallet.
---
I agree, and you cannot have two partially ranked cards of the same perk.  For instance, you cannot have rank 4 in gunsmith and 2 in gunsmith.  The game will force you to fully rank one set out (gunsmith to 5) before creating another set.
---
Not 100% sure if it's always this crazy there. But I had a similar experience last night. With higher level spawns and I'm level 27. So I would assume it is always this crazy 
---
ive had problems with stranger in numbers when i leave a group, if you have it equipped id try removing that.
---
Oh right, thanks! Yeah that‚Äôs exactly what I did! Although the other day I was doing the scorched queen event and I used radX and I could still jump so I didn‚Äôt even think it could be that!
---
 My game is quite buggy though, for the last few weeks on the effects it says I‚Äôve got +100 speed but no reason why I should.
---
The entire perk system is bad. Even worse than in fallout 4. 
---
All perks should be interesting, all crafting/lockpick/etc should be skill levels on your character, and SPECIAL should have a much larger effect in-game. 
---
I aren‚Äôt wrong. Those perks should all just be passive, not needing cards. You could earn them either through quests or make it like Skyrim where your skills get better through practice.
---
Sounds like a great system for a single player game where you can pause.
---
Yeah, it makes about as much sense as a dozen other things in this mess of a game.
---
Well, it seems we will soon be able to buy stuff from player vendors , should spice things up a little bit hopefully.
---
This would also remove the dev cells, so yes, we need this
---
Oh nice! I've always hated that. Assumed it was just a design decision. 
---
Sure. Pm sent.
---
I remember it well. I figured I'd try to explore that area when I was too low level and noped the hell out of there. I'm just approaching level 60 and I am working on that questline and it's way better. The whole right side of the map (the Mire, and Cranberry Bog) are pretty intense. I used to call it where the big kids played. I kept to the easier quests and stuff when I was leveling up. Good luck out there!! :) 
---
Thank you, i will try that. :)
---
How much Damage does it make with the right Perk cards?(:
---
Put the materials in your inventory from stash.
---
No problem
---
TS isn't the best when it comes to long range weapons. Better off with Instigating especially for sniping. TS is better on things like pistols, or mid range rifles to get more damage up close.
---
On another note it makes Automatic weapons have ridiculous recoil, but if you have decent control over them they can be excellent when paired with explosive damage for crowd control.
---
Cause the 15% are the people who want to do jack nothing and get the loot.
---
The BOS paint is legit. I found that on a table in the bog a few weeks back on XB1
---
Friend had the same issue last night...idk why
---
If you seen them die, maybe 2 minutes, tops. Other than that, immediately okay to take.
---
Also be sure to check all armor, because two of my assassin sentinel pieces are titled Poisoners. With the effects in the second and third slots
---
I'm aware. I just domt mind players who paid to play the game.....playing the game.
---
Queen has crazy high explosive resist- all explosives do in a queen hunt is bog down everybody's frame rate.
---
I agree.  I put away my two-shot (non explosive) because I kept missing.  Two shot automatic weapons seem ok though.
---
You sure about finding the BOS KNIGHT POWER ARMOR paint? Im sure you misread something
---
That's two out of the five words of your own title. Just didn't see the point you were trying to make, but it makes a bit more sense now.
---
Actually the better vendor is at harpers ferry... tried multiple hours in watoga... no success  and once i tried harpers ferry it spawns 2/3 times.
---
Obviously they're shit at balancing, at least initially.
---
You completely forgot that TSE handmades exists in this game; perfectly functional, yet sexy as hell.
---
Pray their skin plans come up as rewards for the future vault dungeons.
---
Search r/fo76 using term "banned"

---
You'll be in the water, but taking rads really fast. 
---
Yeah pretty sure it's only the mods that are available
---
I don't see many people posting crashes. I see a lot of people saying it stable and no problem. I'm having no problems after the patch. 
---
Bethesda will never be able to get every bug out, small bugs in games are always going to exist. 
---
fallout76custom.ini doesnt work for me , this game is so broken...
---
It seems like in fixing one cause of Blue-screen crashes they may have caused another.  I run on a PS4 Pro and had zero crashes after 4 hours of play yesterday.  However prior to that I would usually get one or two crashes in a 4 hour session on the previous patch.  
---
I hope they figure it out sooner than later. 
---
You're constructing your own straw man there. I never claimed the OP said "nobody was wearing this cosmetically" either.
---
The title of the post was "Urban Scout Armor - why even put it in the game?"
---
My response was two-fold. First, cosmetic reasons are enough value in and of themselves. People like options.
---
Second, I clearly stated that several armor types have little practical value. Wood armor is a fine example of this, and Urban Scout Armor looks WAY better than wood armor, in my opinion.
---
If you question the validity of the addition of one set of armor, you should question them all. And when you do this (especially if you try to optimize for a particular mix of ballistic, energy, and radiation resistance) you realize that a lot of armor in the game is of dubious value mechanically speaking.
---
No you want skeet. 
---
The smaller cone will keep you from clipping nearby enemies and items that will kill you.
---
Bless you! If I can finish the quest without I shoukd be Okay but I will keep you in mind :)
---
Its scarcam bud. Glad I've managed to make a little sense for you :)
---
Bingo....
---
IIRC slap damage is a 90% reduction in damage dealt, if someone deals enough damage to one shot you in "full" PvP combat they can kill you in under 10 shots of "slap" PvP combat.
---
Another shout out to ball_of_plenty on ps4. Hooked me up with the prototype x-01 armor at level 40 and at level 66 I'm now able to pay it foward. 
---
The posibility of losing junk adds a bit of consequence to dying, which is already almost without andy significance in the game.
---
I don‚Äôt pick the other safes. Just rush to the top for stimpacks. Thanks for the update

"Hello Sir, do you have a moment to hear the good word of ***THE RAVENOUS HIVE MIND***?"
---
The only time that it would make sense for you to go into the shed would be to repair some of your weapons or dropping some ammo for others who need it. Why even participate in the event if you're not even going to at least contribute to the fight? It's such an annoying thing for people to do.
---
To be fair, we still don't have proof that bethesda is doing anything to people with these items. "We are investigating" is not "I had an unreleased item and got banned!".
---
Yeah blocker is insanely efficient. flat 45% dmg reduction on incoming melee? lol yes please. 
---
The only difference between the QoL perks being passive and switching them out is...switching them out.  You're not switching them out in combat - generally speaking you don't run around with them equipped.  It's just another step that really is not needed.  In the end we all have every perk so it's not like some people have this or that...we all have them all.
---
Sadly as a dad of four kids,  everyone of them prefer the blackbird skin over the stupid kiddie kid ones.
---
it can carry the most but it is also the weakest
---
They solved the dupe problem and made it so you can't repair duped items anymore...jk. just pull the mats out, it's a bug since the new patch. 
---
Quite a few middle-aged women too!
---
And my power armor helmet
---
Right now I use marsupial to counter ghouls getting up in my face. It isn't perfect but it works 90% of the time pretty well.
---
Note sure on the exact numbers but it's pretty damn good with the right build!
---
Obviously you weren't aware, because in your original comment, you had no idea what would have changed if 4 other people didn't show up and just sat in the shed not helping. 
---
I played for about 4hrs last night with no problems at all, and someone on the server went after the scorchbeast queen.
---
Glad I could help solve the mystery for you. Good luck.
---
Usually people snatch dead man's loot if Scorchbeast Queen Event is about to fail, so they at least get some kind of a reward. Good etiquette would be that you never take someone's belongings, unless you killed them, excluding last hit kill on low hp.
---
Spawn at watoga station.  Head north as if going towards the BOS vendor. You will pass a row of school buses then have to jump down to a road below.   On that road is a regular bus. Check inside. It will either have 1. A stealth boy and/or piece of clothing.  2. A magazine  3. Nothing. 
---
Keep going north to the bos vendor.  At the intersection he the is another bus turn left and head west. Go past the AMS building and follow the road west past the crashed verticalbird and you will see an orange-ish red building - the Watoga Civic Center.   There should be a fire escape like set of stairs you can take to the roof once on the roof continue going west. The will be an intact parked vertibird on a helipad. Intact (and broken) hallucigen canisters can spawn next to the vertibird.  You can also (rarely?) find canisters at fort (camp?) McClintock northeast of Charleston. In a back room with busted terminals and filing cabinets.
---
It is normally that crazy there, mostly a crap ton of high level super mutants and scorch.
---
Last time I was there 4 scorch beasts decided to wreak havoc to the place joined by a pack of anglers that joined for shits and giggles. Lots of fun was to be had for myself and two other mid level unfortunates stuck within the town's walls 
---
Did you ever do this? Very curious what happens. 
---
I use this rule.. If I know or see them perish I leave the bag.  If I run up on a bag and I don't see anyone in the immediate area or map, well.... the bag is looted.  I traveled to the White Springs Golf Club once and there were zero people in the area (not even remotely), and I came up on 1/2 a dozen full bags of junk loot throughout the club.  I looted enough crap to be well over 100 lbs overweight and slow-crawled my way to the nearest vendor.  Don't know what the story was behind it.
---
that area is level 35+, it‚Äôs meant to be a place low level players wanna avoid and the atmosphere does a good job at it. but it gets dead quiet after level 80, you see the occasional scorchbeast that really wants to ruin your day and maybe a few mutants or bugs which are usually nothing that would really bother or kill you but other than that it‚Äôs almost completely silent unless you go to a marked location
---
I feel your pain. Here, have a brahmin hamberder!
---
Maybe we should stop getting points towards SPECIAL at level 50, but not card slots.
---
Dillutesd rad x and rad shield are good to use to keep mutations online. I learned the hard way. 
---
Maybe other players could rob monorails? 
---
&gt; explosive shotgun
---
Sure, you don‚Äôt really need to aim anymore.
---
What happens when several people will try to buy the same item...this is a technical limitation,not a design choice.
---
Okay, thank you:) 
---
I give it a tryüòâüòÇ
---
Maybe 100,000,000 more times if you're looking for that .0000001% TSE 90% weight reduction LMG.
---
Cool a safe or terminal! Please be lvl 0...Please be lvl 0. üòë ‚ÄúShuffle your deck‚Äù.  NAH...keep it moving.ü§®
---
No with explosive shotguns (I know this because I have a two shot explosive pump action myself) you want to focus all the pellets into one doing the most damage as possible so here‚Äôs a little mini build guide. 
---
Get your demolition expert up to 5* as that makes the explosive part do more damage. 
---
Keep skeet shooter and get that up to 3*
---
Then get all the shotgun perks that make you do more damage ( they are in strength)
---
He probably would have failed.....and blamed it on the server not registering bullets or her never landing or something else. Everyone is entitled to show up to the fight. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. That's part of the game. 
---
Gorgeous.
---
Yep, the card design is fairly asinine. I think the idea was to sell card packs for real money (via Atoms), but they chickened out because the game wasn't in a decent state. But kept the design, because it was too late to rework it. 
---
Not that it's any defense or excuse, but why even have dev rooms in the live content of the game anyway?
---
I use all that for the same reasons but only have 5 pts in STR. I have a full set of legendary marine armor with Deep Pockets that I use most of the time to take advantage of stealth. I use a TSE rifle on most everything but I switch over to commando and a 1\* zealot's combat rifle for scorchbeasts. 
---
p.s. I also kill myself pretty consistently. ;)
---
Ok thank you all
---
I‚Äôm like 90% sure it was the knight paint plans. I know it was only good for the T-60. But I can validate that this afternoon once I‚Äôm off work. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt provide more specifics at this moment. 
---
I just assume that everyone is grinding like me.
---
What's wrong with red, white, and blue paint colors?
---
Lol, you should probably stay out of Cranberry Bog for a while, too!  This map shows the areas and what level of enemies you‚Äôre likely to encounter. 
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-zone-map-with-recommended-level-range/
---
I will sometimes check the map to see if their marker is anywhere nearby. If it looks like they're coming back for their loot then I'll leave it. I usually don't mess around with other people's stuff for the most part. I carry enough shit for everyone in the nuke zone most days.
---
Doubtful.  Wording seems to imply that it is when you either claimed a workshop that already had stored items or when you stored items in a workshop you claimed, and now you cannot place them again from storage.
---
I am pretty sure any stored items in a public workshop are lost to you when you leave that server..
---
Yesterday a guy with a two shot explosive shotgun killed all the legendrys before I even had a shot at them :/
---
I had been so focused on pure damage perks and carry-weight reduction that I ignored the basics like defense. I finally realized that I don‚Äôt need to carry 50+ stim packs - especially if I can beef up my passive defenses
---
My camp is by red rocket too. I managed to find an oul deposit which is nice. 
---
Yeah, it'll be kind of nice when youre trying to sell or buy 7,000 rounds of .50 cal ammo, but.... they literally broke the simplest mechanic in the game.
---
Find "Technical Data" anywhere, deposit in the mailslot in camp whatever out in the bog, receive reward.
---
That camp has a bunch of other loot and leveled scorched, so it's not too bad.
---
Thank you so much for the assistance! It is much appriciated. 
---
No he used an expression to help illustrate his point.  Not to be taken literally and you know that.  Stop trying to over analyze things and stray from the topic.  You would think someone who wears it cosmetically would not be against legendary versions either, and I don't think you are against it.  You just saw an opportunity to argue and took it.  Again, a straw man argument (an argument nobody is making) that just because we think one kind of armor should be buffed does not mean   we are not also of the opinion that "a lot of armor in the game is of dubious value".  However, I prefer to wear unyeielding armor, and most armour has the capability to drop with that prefix.
---
Those are called paragraphs. Its this old-timey thing that people used to use when they actually read books. 
---
Nope, fast travel mat still only can be placed in workshops
---
I agree, if I see them die I pay attention to whether or not they are at least trying to make their way back.  If they don't re-spawn close or head that direction I take it as a gift.
---
Had a feeling it was something like that. 
---
It's a very good quest line.  Make sure you keep the blade of bastet and voice of set. They can be upgraded to higher level versions by crafting (not modifying) at a weapon bench,  but they require the lower level version to do so.
---
There's no plan for the Ultracite JetPack in the ESM file (in the BOOK section), and no mod listed in the OMOD section. So no, it does not exist.
---
For TSE shotty you are gonna want the skeet.
---
Yeah the real question here is: Why was the devroom in the game to begin with? Why isn't there simply a dev server that only authorized accounts can connect to.
---
Yes punish the people who got into the dev room and started selling items, but this is bethesda's fault first and foremost. They screwed up here. But everyone seems to act as if bethesda is blameless.
---
Literally never found anything worth the effort in a locked box etc 
---
Fuck cranberry bog, I tend to avoid that place if I can help it, hate that place with a passion lol. I'm level 68 now and still shudder if a quest takes me to this location ( also doesn't help i cant fast travel the hell out once I'm there)
---
And wendigo and molerat teeth for some reason.
---
Hallucinagen canisters are used for Hallucinagen gas grenades and Phantom devices, baseballs are used for baseball grenades, beer bottles are used for Molotov cocktails, Assaultron heads and deathclaw hands for weapons , Hardened mass for flux, prewar cash for (I think) dining at the Whitespring.
---
I've never figured out what the teeth are for though.
---
Probably about 4 people will get it. 
---
Just check the desks in the bunker. 
---
Ya it is unless you show up right after someone else has done that same mission on that server. I had to wait till well over level 50 to do it solo. Maybe ask someone you know that higher level to go with you all? Or just wait till higher level. My 2 cents. I‚Äôm on PS4 and will volunteer to help you all....no charge... PSN same name as on here. 
---
What are workshops? I heard this same thing from a friend who plays on XB. She said that she will be playing, find and lose a workshop. I didn't get a chance to ask because I thought I knew what she ,meant, but I don't. 
---
Think I may have something. I'll check tonight after work. Uk xbox
---
Every melee build should carry two decent guns at least if only for Scorchbeasts.
---
I‚Äôve found plans and decent weapons in level 3 safes. An auto grenade launcher once, Gauss rifle another time. Last night I found the plan for the MG42. Nothing jaw dropping but they‚Äôre a lot better than the master safes in fallout 4 from my experience 
---
First come first serve.  The server rejects the second purchase attempt because the item no longer exists.
---
In the event that the system gets both commands at the "same" time, which ever it processes first wins, the second is rejected "Item no longer available".
---
The same system works on pretty much everyone MMO that has player to player auction houses or market boards.
---
If your not very high level, watch yourself on the right side of the map. Everything there can kill/overwhelm you. My first build was stealth sniper so I could lose things fairly quickly. Decided to stay on the left and farm levels when I was under 50. Now that I'm over 70 it's pretty easy. If you're low level, stay low and go slow. Always remember which direction to run in case you get ambushed. Never be over encumbered when you're in an area where you are under levelled. Not sure what your build is but if you're close quarters, being under levelled is going to suck for a bit in that area.
---
This is literally the top non-stickied topic right now.
---
I'm pretty sure kids would find the new skins lame as fuck too. Where are the tallymarks? The skulls our on shoulders? Wheres the blood!
---
Damn.  That makes sense though. I took this guys workshop and stored like 15 generators and whatnot and could never place them again, i was like level 10 and didn't have the plans for any of that and Was super excited to have a "headstart"  but could never place the stuff again
---
I honestly thought the vending update was coming as well, then I slowly re-read it. I'll be happy to get some more bugs out of the way first. They said that new content will come out quickly after the official announcement, so I'm hoping we are talking within the next month 
---
that would be a interesting way to handle it.
---
How have you gone this long in life without noticing that everyone else is typing *should've*, not *should of*?  
---
I'm one of those high level players, and I had the smoothest experience I've had with this game since release yesterday. 
---
I feel like the fact that different players, have vastly different experiences with the game, is one of the biggest issues they have to deal with.
---
A public test server is essentially just a patched clone of the live server. It really doesn't cost much to spin up a new server instance. It's not like they need new hardware for a PTS. Testing servers tend to be very low populated servers as well, so bandwidth is also a non-issue. The cost would be in manhours. Spitting the testing teams doesn't sound like a good idea. This game is so broken that hot-fixing is probably the best option for them right now. 
---
Oh hell, yes, you're absolutely right! I mis-"spoke". Thanks for correcting!
---
Great advice! I will keep that in mind. At least I accidentally got rid of the one that doesn't upgrade. I love the story of this quest so far. My character Rhett, he loves it but feels awkward because he is male and then mentally pulled a "screw it who cares, the world ended and I am trying to do sone good"
---
&gt; but they cant figure out who has stacks of 100k of items?
---
I'm sure they can, but as much as reddit likes providing solutions I imagine figuring out what the threshold is to ensure no legitimate players are banned is (hopefully) being a well thought through process atm.
---
Your weapon will kill you regardless of the tormentor perk... Also if that were true then all the weapons need their respective crippling perks, a rifle build can handle a swarm just fine, if youre unable to do it without the perk thats your problem but if hes looking for a min max dps focused build he shouldnt invest 3 perk points in that

---
I never pvp , I always have pacifist mode on. Pacifist mode does not protect me at all. I have been playing since launch and am now level 151. A player with bobbleheads stacked can one shot me , I never turn pacifist mode off, I don't claim workshops . I don't pick locks. I do nothing to initiate pvp. Yet at least once every other day, someone one shots me, destroys whatever armor I happen to be wearing. Pacifist modes needs to completely make player immune to other players . You can't fight back while it's on anyway . 
---
and completely redundent with the CHA based team support perks. heck you can even share team boosting perks. 
---
yet another proof that the perk system was rushed and isn't good game design.
---
The problem is game design. All these enemies spawned for someone else, not for you. I took my lvl 17 to Harper's to get Handmade plans, and had to deal with an army of lvl 60+ Supermutants. But hopping to another server resulted in population of lvl 16 Scorched, which were easy. It all depends on who was there, and for whom the enemies spawned. If a lvl 200 was there, and enemies spawned for them, you'll have a bad time as lvl 20. Even if you survive (which is doable), the loot you'll get won't be usable for another 20-30 levels. The problem isn't Harper's, the problem is crap game design.
---
Bear Arms doesn't work on Auto GL's now? F-THAT.
---
Yeah, I wound up with two torsos on one frame.  I took the second one off and gave it to a friend.
---
Interesting.   Was it a crater like thing to mine or was it just a little bump on a rock?   The craters are set spawns and shouldn't move around.   The bumps on a rock are somewhat random. 
---
Do you only use travelling pharma and junk rat with your 5 str?
---
So do all bots aggro when you attack one there, or can you kill one and still not get attacked by the entire town?
---
A wonderful design, but to be honest, the moment I saw the windowless section, I was thinking "Yeah, let's going in through this wall." But then again, that's me, I'm paranoid AF. I wanted to ask, though, how did you get the paintings on the doorways? I thought their attach point was in the middle of the things.
---
I can stop the swarm at the golf club from getting out the door with a two shot automatic and tormentor.   It‚Äôs a must have for rifle build as you cant jump away inside buildings most of the time.
---
I said it *wasn't*
---
But the definition straight outta Google is "a large or excessive amount of something"
---
Don't go to Watoga yet
---
I play an OG xbone  and didn‚Äôt have any issues during 4 hours of play. In my opinion it showed incredible improvement.
---
I agree with you.  I have been shot with explosive weapons while I was in my PA, barely did anything.   If I put Dense mod on my chest, I think I can achieve a good result on my normal armor too.   I keep reading people can 1 shot pacifists easily without bobblehead stacking, but I have yet to see all the specifics.  (Perks, weapons, mutations, ect).   This would either have to be able to side-step the slap damage or be able to do extreme amounts of damage so the slap damage would equal 400+ dmg in one shot.   Slap damage is what 1% of total?  So are we talking about 40000 damage?   Does slap damage apply to Explosive done by players?  If not then Dense mod would mitigate that too.
---
True, I just thought of it as a joke, lol. Idk how it would get implememted tbh. 
---
Why warn them? They should be banned. 
---
A pile of firewood would be nice.
---
online games have existed for decades at this point, besthehdia acting like this stuff is the player base's fault is stupid. Putting live items on a live server like that then just assuming no one could get there is a mistake someone would make on a MUD in 1982 or something, besthedia is a rich company, they are not some scrappy indie, they can hire people that know how to make games and deal with problems that got solved a decades ago.
---
skeet skeet skeet
---
I finally rage quit last night. I've had it with Bethesda and their inability to get a stable server. I get on after the patch can barely load into a server. It took forever to get in. Then I go and take time to go to a silo and launch a nuke with my friends. We take the queen down to just 25% health. Then everyone gets booted from the server. All the ammo and time wasted. No more. I'll lurk and watch the forums and Reddit for a bit to see if they fix it or solutions are made. That has a time limit because like most gamers once I lose interest it's off to something else.
---
workshops are little locations like settlements from fallout 4 where you can claim them and use them to farm specific resources. you only have the workshop for as long as you are on the server or until someone else tries getting it
---
I've noticed a bug that when sharing Strange in numbers and someone leaves the server (while still in the team) the shared mutations are totally suppressed.  If someone leaves, you can't even jump as high as you would if alone.
---
I've done it with 12 people and also done it with 2. It changes completely but I never mined low levels showing up to try and fight and explore.
---
Thinking it may be easier to track unreleased items in the world then items that are currently available.  I have no knowledge in that kind of data but it seems it would be easier to track something that isn‚Äôt in game.
---
No just bandolier and travelling pharmacy.  I found it was the best combination without putting more points in STR. I should also mention that I'm a VATS-crit build so I have a ton more points in agility, luck and maxed perception. It's a different style so more strength just isn't an option.
---
My camp is real close to that- it's always either Honey Beasts, Yao-Gui or Radscorpions.
---
My first idea of the perk cards was that around a certain level you would have access to all of them but when I started to get double cards in packs I got really confused. What am I suppose to do with two lock picks?
---
happened to me last night, half way through Powering Up Poseidon.
---
Please don't throw grenades and don't use things like minuguns since they cause lots of lag. Gatlings are ok since they don't shoot nearly as fast. If you don't do too much damage its way less of a problem if you are actively trying to kill the little guys running around since it lets the people who do focus all of their attention on the queen.
---
...and this aint first time. The fact that this is hidden inside some settings menu, is bullsh#t. Even Amazon, company that doesn't do games, understand that things like these needs to be easily accessible and visible to user.
---
I noticed 2 load in screens every time, *but* the caveat is that they are 2 shorter loading screens. 
---
OCDecorator was the most popular/famous, if I recall
---
Dupers dumping stuff. One of my chars has an explosive combat shotgun that I bought from the vendor. The vendor had FOUR of them, all identical. So I'm 99% positive it was a duper selling them. Not sure what the motivation for doing it was. 
---
bethesda has a big iron on its hip and the dupers are trying to get rid of the evidence.
---
I mean, it's first come first serve as is.  Just now you don't get to use the other items or sell things until that user is done which can take minutes if the person is sorting thru their aid / apparel to sell off their 200 caps for the day.
---
If they allowed you to interact with it together, it'd be the same as it is now, just no forced waiting.
---
I've had a guy kill me with a supersledge with 3 swings while I was in PA mode.
---
&gt; be a pal and keep the deathclaws, sloths, other scorchbeasts, crickets, Yao gui, and other sorts of aggravations off the players 
---
Honestly I feel that those give me better loot than the queen itself. If I just focus on the queen and the occasional straggler add that gets to me, I walk away with very little. But if I spend my time clearing all this other stuff, I come away with legendaries, screws, gears, etc.
---
Not for me.  If I log in with it on I have a carry weight of 540 which drops to 440 if I get out of the suit and back in.  I have two calibrated shocks.
---
&gt; Get your demolition expert up to 5* as that makes the explosive part do more damage.
---
Oh really? Do you know how much? 5 points is a big commitment for me with the latest XP nerf.
---
are you grabbing the jetpacks? you could probably trade those with somebody that is hunting jetpacks, but keeps getting callibrated shocks!
---
*holds out hand, Mona Lisa voice* MONEY PLEEEEASE
---
I dont think you understand what that means
---
I'd be cool with perks having an active and passive part. You need to have Gunsmith *equipped* in order to get guns to break slower, but passively, you can build level 5 weapons
---
Happy to help!   You can server hop for these.   It's also a great way to find magazines if you are achievement hunting. When you get to the roof if you follow a path back south to a set of stairs there's another vertibird that usually has power armor next to it and a few guns and frags in and around it.
---
Based on supposed drop percentages I would think 10+ of any specific TSE would be more then enough or 20-30+ of each bobblehead, etc.  This should not be hard to figure out at all especially since I've seem screenshots of people with 1200 of the same bobblehead.
---
Mine isn't two-shot, just explosive.
---
Yeah, I've started picking up clipboards (didn't know clipboards had springs), so my problems haven't been as bad, but I spent over an hour trying to find springs for the excavator armor mission because I didn't have any.
---
And my plastic problem is mostly from bulking.
---
But yeah, if you start scraping the junk that has them when you start then it shouldn't be a problem like it was for me, I just focused on screws and adhesive.
---
Imagine all the things that would need to be changed if your strength was able to be raised at 2 points each level to a max of 25-30 so you have the cards you need for heavy weapons and melee.  Or lets say the value of the cards was reduced so you could zero value cards, that is a problem if you using that value as a multiplier.
---
The perk/special system with the card swapping let them avoid rewriting code and testing balances so they could release the game in 2018, and with everything else they had issues with, giving the game and additional year to clean it up and flesh out some content would have likely helped with some of the reviews being better than they were, for what that is worth.  I have no idea how that would affect their finances and having to push back the development of other projects but there would be a substantial impact.  So yes it is not an ideal system, and it is annoying to have to manually shuffle through a lot of cards when you get to higher levels (and leveling in this game is too easy, exp awards should probably be halved ).  
---
Maybe we will get some relief at some point by creating predefined loadouts of special card allocations.  Until then I just imagine I am setting down my gun and unpacking my lockpick kit (why does the screwdriver never need to show up in my inventory?) when I am swapping out cards.
---
The main issue is the crashing which is effecting all platforms. Not sure what's causing it I have crashed and people next to me are fine and I have seen people crash while I am fine. We don't know What causes it so we cannot reproduce. If the game is unplayable for people that is unacceptable 
---
[I know this will be speculation] So if I bought it am I a target, or are they looking at accounts that have duping method items?
---
haha
---
Nearest holidays
---
I dont mind if low levels show up and actually try to do something. I do mind however if low levels show up and run around in circles, hind behind me, hide in the shed, shoot at me, spam grenades or use a level 5 minigun which causes more lag than damage, etc. Those people are a liability whereas someone who is keeping the scorched and deathclaws off of me while I kill the queen is a massive help even if they barely do damage.
---
At first my shotgun did 440 and now it is in the thousands and most of it is from demolition expert
---
We should be getting perk points past lvl 50 but o guess we have to wait for an expansion
---
Sweet. I've been waiting for more of these.
---
Gotta say again: Fanastic work!
---
If you're standing to look through the peepholes than it's useless. Plus your footsteps will be heard, I imagine.
---
Hell yes.
---
It doesn't fix anything. it's functionnaly the same has having all perks all the time.
---
With adrenal reaction I can almost do 2000 damage

This was changed recently and they do now require ballistic fiber to craft.

Problem:  Any time there is anything video intensive (swarm of enemies, exploding cars, explosions from rocket launcher, etc) the game crashes and kicks you out to the Xbox home screen.  This is AFTER the patch yesterday.  
---
Problem:  The larger your footprint is, the more likely you are to crash the game.  Taking over more than one work bench or travelling while you have a work bench, the game can't keep track of me, gets overwhelmed, and crashes.  This also magnifies the possibility of the first issue mentioned above.  
---
Not that I‚Äôm aware of
---
and it is extremely frustrating because the scrolling also speeds up significantly.
---
Have 100 rad-x you're trying to sell part of? Well the bar is going to decrease slowly, then quickly, then suddenly lightspeed and poof you're back at the max number again. It's such a stupid negative quality of life change...
---
Also, what rifle build is built to tank?
---
I thought the latest patch fixed it completely? Then again I haven't looked into it. 
---
Probably just got lucky with the server. I had the usual - heavy lag spikes when nukes went down, then eventual "controls disabled" started popping, and a minute later full on disconnect with a small rollback. 
---
Okej? I mean this was a month ago but yes, sure.
---
I crafted my level 30 Pocked Leather armor sets last night.  They did not require Ballistic Fiber to make (even though they do require it to repair).  It was after the PS4 update yesterday morning.
---
I think the peepholes need to be at crouch level instead of standing level. If you are standing in there someone will know you are in there which defeats the purpose of peeping. 
---
This does sound very creepy but it‚Äôs purely a technical viewpoint
---
snag aquaboy/girl if you get the chance.  I'm holding mine incase more water based content comes around.
---
Your explosive weapons do 100% more damage with the card maxed
---
Well honestly they are pretty pointless, mobs only spawn when you are in your base and a small amount to that are mostly weaker than you 
---
The entire perk-card system is a badly thought through, poorly implemented idea. Was I supposed to be able to trade these cards with other players at some point in development? 
---
We had functional, intuitive systems for 4 games. I‚Äôm not sure how they were scrapped in favor of this. 
---
I noticed this too. Game is running waaay smoother for me on PS4 so far. I'm liking it!
---
I heard this a lot so I tested with my brother. He took a workshop from me and while in the area he could do full pvp damage to me. But if he stole a workshop from me and I was across the map then fast travelled near me he could only do slap damage.
---
Just shoot the guy if he's AFK at a vendor? It wil get his attention or he will die. I won't take his junk because stealing from AFK players is something that even I won't do.
---
And if your on Xbox I can help you level up if you want
---
This is nice
---
Ps4 here. Way more stable last night.  
---
BoS Initiate paint is certainly legit and can only be applied to the T-60. After that I am not sure, which I appreciate isn‚Äôt super helpful.
---
Same, ever since FO3 and the Nuka Quantum quest line I cant part with it.
---
Simpler fix: When a player receives a bounty, he is automatically kicked from his group and can't rejoin while he has a bounty.  
---
Wanted players already can't hide or see other players on the map, so this is a simple fix.
---
There was a point where my weapons weren‚Äôt cutting it in that level range. I stuck around the Ash Heap for a while until I got a nice combat rifle and combat shotgun from the Molemen.
---
Honestly I keep them around bc the sound of them firing tells me I need to go kill some crap 
---
I've got a legendary urban scout armour torso, can't remember off hand what it's effects are at the moment though
---
My guesses would either be:
---
1) laziness, since they had one in fo4 and just ported over a lot of the same code. 
---
2) perhaps most of these Items are on timed release and it would be easier to import them to the game this way. 
---
I don't code so these are just my guesses. 
---
I'll echo all of these points. I think I was in the 30s when I first explored Harper's Ferry, and it can definitely be a bit hairy. If you have some decent power armor, it's a good place to break it out, since the damage resistance and Strength boost to melee helps. 
---
With that area and Watoga, which the story quests bring you to, it can be much more productive to just run in, do what you need to, and then get out of there. Things like gulpers, Mr. / Lt. Gutsys and scorchbeasts can be tough at any level under 50. 
---
The western half of the map is generally safer, with the possible exception of some of the mines and area near Welch, which has some mole miners that'll use rocket launchers. If you need things like stimpacks or purified water or Radaway, don't be afraid to re-complete some of the basic Event quests - Mama Dolce's, Vault Tec ag center, escorting Steelheart, etc. 
---
Great job! Very good use of an existing structure, I like to do that myself, takes quite a bit of re-positioning to get it right but it's very cool to use existing structure to make the CAMP bigger than the budget would let you.  Are you on PC, XBOX or PS4?
---
You just gave me flashbacks of New Vegas. 
---
Supposedly it fixed the main method, however there are still other lesser known methods 
---
New ones get found shortly after each patch unfortunately. 
---
We can tell by the first 5 mins if we are going to be able to beat the SBQ.  And Everytime we know we can't... it's because 8-12 people under level 100 showed up and most are sitting in the shed or hiding somewhere.  
---
This causes TWO big problems.  They aren't contributing to the needed damage  AND the SBQ Won't land if she's focused on someone on the roof or in the shed.  So, if half the group is hiding in the shed, she spends more time circling the shed than out in the field where she can land.
---
That being said, after 5 mins if we haven't gotten her to the 50% regen mark yet, we bail.  Leave those scrubs to their fate...  
---
I really wish this scaling would be fixed or this encounter be level capped somehow.  Something really needs to be done to address this issue.  People can say all they want that these guys just want to enjoy the content too... I'm sure they do... but their enjoyment shouldn't come at the cost of my time/resources/enjoyment.
---
I keep it as SBBJ (Scorch Beast Bugout Juice). When I just don't want to bother, I start running and pop one every time my AP nears 0.
---
There's literally no point in hiding in the shed. You're not getting experience for killing the high level enemies and you are probably causing the event to fail by not helping so youre not getting event rewards. If you're not gonna try to help with the enemies running around then don't bother going to he event because it's a waste of time. You don't even have to focus on the queen. I had a friend who would tag the queen with a pipe revolver at the start of the event and spend the whole thing killing the various deathclaws and scorched. 
---
Scammers are always finding new ways to scam.
---
Duping in fo76?
---
Nope, because a method that I've reported since beta still works.
---
I wish that some perk cards were passive. Namely those ones.
---
Or if another player does.
---
I've come back to my base with generators destroyed by mole rats and the mole rats hanging out around a wall in the back.
---
What do you mean? They are directly correlated as you can only equip cards if you have enough special points left.
---
This happens tons of times to me, its so fuckin annoying. Why does it take my character 10 years to sit in a chair 
---
always forget how young people on reddit are. It's from the classic movie - Three Amigos
---

---
You don't need situational perks... Ever. Just give you a advantage if you often do the activity. Convenience always will be a valid gameplay resource. A build to scavenger could have all the situational perks and focus on looting containers crafting and sell out. Combat could be secondary. Is just an option. Min-maxing all the gameplay is not necessary in this game. Multiple characters are fun. The meta is not the only way of play.
---
However, we need loadouts and a shared stash between characters.
---
Yeah lol I just have one as a defacto alarm
---
I find them to be useless and more of a lure. I do not camp build with them. You're better off building your structure to ensure your camp assets are safe. 
---
It starts below 15, I had someone do it at 13. It ends as soon as you hit 20. At 19, you still get it, at 20 you do not. 
---
As soon as I left the turrets off my camp build, it stopped getting attacked by mole rats, liberators, super mutants. And occasionally it will have a robot or scorched shoot at it but that is once in a blue moon.
---
Not gonna lie those are the only glitchy mobs that spawn for me, forgot about those 
---
I agree with you but I would also add a distinction of combat / not combat.  99.9 percent of the time you are fast traveling, crafting, vendoring, lockpicking you are not in combat.  The only difference between having the cards that benefit these situations is for you to swap out cards.  We all will have every card in the game so it's not a style or choice to have or not have these.  It's just a needless step.  
---
AUUUGH I did the same thing! 
---
I‚Äôd be happy if they just upped the till a bit. The bots only have $200 caps between them and they‚Äôre sitting on a million caps worth of gear, plans, and recipes? C‚Äômon, bots, you must be doing something seriously wrong.
---
This has nothing to do with the topic, I guess that's why you are getting downvoted.
---
I think since the game is so heavy into you finding resources to craft that the map should have the capabilities of allowing players to mark the map with custom markers. For example, if I find a resource of iron, I would like to mark on my map that it is there, so I can return to it repeatedly. With the map so big, I find it hard to remember where I have found things and really dislike having to put in twice the work if I want to go back to that resource
---
How about u just get to use all the perks you earn and not pick and choose? So much fun to have to constantly spend time in perks menu on a game you can't pause. Honestly I stopped playing and started RDR2
---
I feel less silly about it at least
---
Other than what's already been mentioned, good luck stat will give a chance for level 3 locked safes to drop heavy weapons.
---
On xbox1! 
---
Just luck and RNG. I had the opposite experience, leveled from 17-20 in Harper's, didn't see plans once. And by "leveled" I mean I server hop, kill the few enemies between me and vendor, check vendor, hop to another server. Gained 2 full levels doing this, didn't see plans. And, at 20, didn't see plans in Watoga either (because that's the cutoff). Made another char, went straight to Watoga. Boom, plans. Get them. Reload. Boom, plans again! Then 30-40 mins of server hopping, boom, another set of plans. And so on. It's all RNG.
---
I have one at the front entrance as a glorified alarm system for when i'm crafting and a mob spawns. Besides that I don't really use any defenses, I am my own defense lmao 
---
üóø
---
&gt;  Saved perk loadouts
---
I want to use that mod so badly. But having to unpack the games ba2 files to install it, and the fact that it saves your loadouts to some arbitrary server the mod creator hosts keeps me from installing it.
---
heh, yeah its all speculation but  I suppose it depends on how hard bgs wants to hit it. If any, the set might disappear but who knows.
---
I have an extra plan that I can sell you for 300 caps! It's cheaper than the Enclave price. I won't be on until 4PM EST today, but let me know. 
---
Yeah, I'm spoiled from playing so many sessions of FOnline. You die, you lose everything on you. All your ammo, all your superstims, that precious unique assault rifle with a -1ap cost modifier, everything. You get a chance to take it back if it was in a dungeon, but the enemies are almost guaranteed to respawn by then. If it was a random encounter, your stuff is lost forever. Compared to that you take absolutely no losses here...hell, the game is nice enough to restore your rad meter if you die
---
You shouldn't be broadcasting to tell people to drop items from there ... everyone who exploits or buys exploited items deserves to be punished.
---
I wouldn't be sad if that happened, but rip 2k caps, lol
---
Min-maxing everything is not fun. RPGs are about choose, this game is enjoyable when you use different builds out of the meta.
---
Yeah, but can I kill myself with my own artillery? That's the real challenge
---
That's why you downvoted, because I asked a question, a serious non combative question. Good for you.
---
I wish I had your writing.
---
Its a good thing.  Its ensuring all assets are loaded beforw plopping you in.
---
Hey now, it just works, ok? :D
---
That made me chuckle, Good etiquette in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
---
Paper bag o  the ground also works I think. Male sure to drop a single ammo first to make sure the bag shows up and doesn't glitch through the floor.
---
The 5% max slap damage is a great idea.  You should make a separate post about that,  see if we can get a dev to notice. 
---
A GREAT location to farm toys, including baseballs, is the fairgrounds in the northern forest. There‚Äôs maybe ten baseballs, but a zillion basketballs and other options to make dropping and scrapping easier.
---
Beware Poseidon Energy Plant Yard workshop for this. I've had plenty of players come and steal the workshop from me while I'm still building it up. When I begin to defend my self, his teammate snipes me from the top of Poseidon. There was no escape since he was so high above me he was able to get me in all directions.
---
I didn't downvote, I just offered an explanation why others do.
---
Had to go there for the BoS quest, glassed cavern is deffo not for the faint hearted, getting there and whilst in the place. 
---
Never done the SBQ yet but have been in a blast zone facing the enemies and radiation, didn't like it lol
---
Same so far here on PS4.
---
I‚Äôm like level 131 and I find this is standard behaviour I‚Äôve watched tse builds pull out batons so they don‚Äôt one shot legendary creatures and I‚Äôll not use Chems and won‚Äôt power attack in general I think most people are pretty good.
---
He said hes using pa...
---
I wouldn't mind the turrets if they reacted like they were supposed to heh
---
Looks like you got hit by auto correct from "severely" to "slightly"
---
Hmm, I'm having a Dark Souls flash back here.
---
If I recall correctly, high lvl people were trading modded/illegal items in the game, and basically after transfer the new owners were hit with warnings and account freezing.
---
I can just see it now, find a wonkie bad ass weapon in a vendor, then Bethesda locks your account. Forcing you to write an essay on cheating.
---
That sucks! Someone was trying to explain to me yesterday that PS4 doesn't really let you join recent players servers without a friend invite? Is that correct?
---
It could just make it so pacifist mode doesn't count when you hit a bounty.
---
Completely useless, take up way to much budget. And they take 10x as much time to kill attackers as you would, by the time they do kill the enemy the damage is done. I never put any on my level 90's (80+ hour playtime) home and I've maybe maybe had to repair 5% of my base 2 or 3 times. 
---
Dont forget you can get in through the door by the big head. 
---
And you can build a rifle-tank build its not like it has to be a glass canon ffs
---
Not True when used properly, I use a TSE Handmade till the Beast Lands, then switch to Explosive Combat SG and get up close for Head Shots which do very noticeable Damage to the Queen, specially when my High Sneak Character is in Caution most of the time.
---
If I am behind her, I will toss Nuka Grenades at her Butt for over 1200 Damage a pop, 
---
I'm not sure what makes people think that the SBQ is immune to explosive Damage when the quickest kills I've seen all come from TSE weapons with players obviously stacking explosive Perks.
---
I have witnessed 2 occasions where a player with a TSE Dragon took 30% off the Queen with each Shot, first one waited till she was down to about 30% then finished her, second fire early, then a second shot 10 seconds later and the battle was over with only 5 players in the vicinity.
---
This reply is so asinine it's not even worth reading. 
---
It's not nice to pick on handicapped people 
---
I had this problem once or twice with different power armor parts, and I think a weapon once. It seemed to happen when I had the exact amount or only a little more of one of the required crafting materials - I went out and grabbed a handful more of those materials and it seemed to fix it. 
---
Yup, **YOU** should be punished based on what you just said, you have no fucking idea if you have anything that's not supposed to be in your inventory, is it that hard to understand?
---
Awesome man, I'll take it
---
What platform and are you selling lol
---
You mean that books were not only used as fire fuel ?
---
Do new SBQs keep respawning if you kill the last one? I was watching a Rifle Gaming video where they tried to kill a SBQ with a second nuke but all it did was spawn a new one in the old one's place.
---
Same here. Entering a nuked zone is 100% crash rate for me. So I basically cannot do nuke zones unless someone I know is on that same server for me to join back onto. 
---
&gt;how young people on Reddit are
---
I don't think you can assume that but okay
---
I waited for everyone in uranium fever to get shots in and did that event all the way up to maybe a week ago when other people just started 1-shotting stuff.  After i saw maybe two or three people in a row not waiting and just 1-shotting the legendaries i just quit doing it.  In fact.. i've quit doing a lot of events.  I'm hoping the people who do this will get so bored of the game that they quit.  And wondering how long that would take.
---
Just sounds like you were wanted though? Or you shot back
---
I'm on PC but thanks.
---
Yeah he clearly did not provide you with a long answer before stating that you sounded angry. You are an idiot lol.
---
Just the explosive add-on effect right, not 100% base damage?
---
Xbone, and not at the moment. It's good for wrecking people who try to mess with me and my boys. 
---
125 Not that high level lmfao
---
Don't drop them, keep them and let the problem solve itself.
---
Cause you stayed on the topic with your last 2 replies, huh?
---
Some great tips from Tharo there. Also be on the lookout for the Agility perk, White Knight - it reduces repair costs for armor, and helps it stay durable. It is available at level 39, so you have a ways to go for it, but it is very useful. 
---
If you're level 30, have you tried out the lever action rifle? The plan is annoyingly tough to get - it is sold rarely by Responder vendors for 600ish caps, or you can get it on the FO76 Market sub for around 2,000 caps. However, because the latest patch fixed a bug with the reloading, it is now a really splendid weapon, and it uses 45s, which are fairly abundant. The hunting rifle is also nice, if you're playing in stealth or from range. 
---
The excavator power armor is actually perfectly fine, because it gives you a 100-pound boost to weight. The other power armors offer more protection, which you might need against scorchbeasts and in nuke zones, but you shouldn't be worried about hunting either until you get close to Level 50. 
---
A melee weapon that pairs well with the power armor at your level is the Blade of Bastet. It is a quest item you can get fairly easily if you explore Riverside Manor and do the questline related to it. (The Order of Mysteries.) Bonus, because the blade is a legendary quest item, you can reforge it at Level 25, 35 and 45 for more damage and durability each time, and IIRC it only requires conventional materials like steel, adhesive and oil to repair. 
---
I don't think the Overseers' quest is bugged, I think it's deliberately left open ended to allow for future storytelling. Just my two cents, could be wrong. 
---
I'll try that a thanks!
---
Oh... don't get me wrong. I hold them fully accountable for releasing an online game in this state. I would say it's embarrassing but they have no shame so I'll stick with insulting to all the fans and the IP which deserved better treatment. There is a kernel of a great idea in this game and it was squandered with this repurposed engine and sloppy execution.
---
So, if you follow the subs here you see all the drama around duping op weapons, so an awful lot (maybe most) of the super-high end stuff on the trading subs is two-shot explodey whatever... but if you have a few caps to spare, you can put a wanted ad out for a level-appropriate legendary that would be life-changing *to you*, but literal throw-away trash to other guys chasing the op stuff. You might be surprised at what you could buy for 500-1000 caps. 
---
I have had that happen to me a few times too and I've gotten to the point now where I just open the transfer window and it forces my bags to load instantly which I didn't know before a couple of days ago.
---
Before I'd get those stupid spinning arrows while it was loading the loot contents. 
---
Lost so much good stuff that way :\\ Not a TSE though. So, I'm sorry!
---
This is like telling drug addicts to ditch their stashes. They're all still fiends, and you are still a cheater. Just uninstall the game and play single player games if you want to cheat.
---
So once I got some more aluminum scrap, I was able to craft it. It seems like I needed enough mats for at least two items for me to craft one....
---
I noticed a similar issue with repairing my X-01. Something required 4 black titanium to repair, and I had 4, but I was unable to repair it. I'm going to go deathclaw hunting to get more BT, and see if I'll be able to repair it once I get 8 BT.
---
Blackbird marine armor paint please
---
Weapon Artisan and the Fix it Good perk both work properly now, so you can perk into them vs having 5 slots taken for gunsmith.
---
I use 3x 1* rifle perk cards for exploring  vs my 3* ones because it saves me six slots which allows me to have max picklock and other situationals perked when I dont need to do max damage. 9 slots = 60% boost, 3 slots =30% boost.
---
Also pay attention when modding your weapons/armor, most mods will reduce your max condition. So if your maxing damage/armor pierce/clip size on your weapon, you might want to play a little with your mods and sacrifice some performance for longevity ie condition.
---
I think something people are missing is that balance is more what you want to strive for rather than a min/max glass cannon. Maxing  damage means having to repair way more, finding a balance will mean less downtime repairing or having to use off build weapons.
---
Since hitting 100+ most of my cards I keep slotted are situational, the only damage buffing cards I run are incissor, tank killer, 3x 1* rifle cards and a 1* shotgun perk for spread. And since weapon artisan and fix it good have been fixed i've been running max demo vs max gunsmith. That leaves me 35 slots to spend how I want. I also swap enforcer in/out if im going to be coming across scorchbeasts.
---
TY!
---
Take it asap
---
You can store stuff in stuff that isn't your stash?
---
Sorey, I think I responded to the wrong message.
---
Says the guy trying to invalidate everything others say. Clearly, others are trying way too hard, not you. LOL
---
Where at?
---
Yup, 5mm
---
I know this will probably never happen, but my life would be complete if I could play an electric guitar while wearing power armor.
---
I‚Äôm level 110 and have never defeated the queen. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to die to this very issue. 
---
I have wasted so much ammo/stims, it‚Äôs just not worth it. 
---
I will add if you dont have a TSE weapon, maybe consider clearing adds BEFORE you shoot the queen. Had a fight Sunday night were it turned into a 10 FPS slideshow because no one was clearing adds, we obviously lost that event but it was frustrating to say the least.
---
You're a fucking idiot. I was going to go into more detail but.... Yea, fucking idiot is just easier. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, sad, I‚Äôd love to visit ;)
---
You need to be wearing a prison collar to start the falsley accused quest just run around with it on and some roobots will come attack you and on there bodies is a note that starts the quest 
---
I've found one. Targeting hud is about impossible. , and I still need a jet pack.
---
Reminds me of some kid the other night that had a bounty on his head, it was up on the bridge by the ice cream place above flatwoods. It was only 10 caps but I was close. one sniper shot to the head put him on his knees and he started calling for help, just as the emote went up...I fired a second shot and put him down. Got a nice bit of junk too.
---
Thanks for that information. I thought that where it says menu on the map screen it meant the 
---
pip-boy menu, only because the display size cut off the button prompt. 
---
Note: I have had this game since the beta.
---
They specifically marketed the game and the perk card system as swappable 24/7 on the fly. They boasted about it.
---
Bring up the map, then there is a menu option. Xbox is RB
---
Because you have 100,000 lbs of junk. 
---
Very nice! I love multi-level homes especially with this much detail. 
---
Good!  More ban hammers on the cheaters.  I do feel a LITTLE sorry for those who may have purchased the stolen items without knowledge.  I had actually been asking some sellers in the market about pricing on the BoS Paladin paints, glad I didn't get them.
---
I'll spend 60 caps to Fast Travel to a 10 Cap Bounty.

---
There you go. The idea is that the weapon does so much damage that even the slap damage is lethal. At even 1% damage, the damage from that The Dragon example would be 420, still more than enough to one-shot.
---
Welp trolls will be trolls. We can't do anything about it. Most pain is that beth don't give us too much if you want me to be honest. Game is glitchy (from yesterday patch some thing went to better way. Like full auto lag) and pretty annoying sometimes. As long as beth will do patches once per few months a lot of time will go until this game will be free from game breaking major bugs. Same with content. They shouldn't add new stuff until fix old one (witch they have a lot of problem. Like with dev room). 
---
Yes just the explosive effect. the shotgunner perk cards strength add to the base damage
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I get that I really do. I'm of the mind to let people play how they wish, even if they ruins my own fun for a short time, lol.
---
Private servers are the way to go, I can most certainly agree on that.
---
Security my ass! We all know what those "peepholes" are for!
---
I don't want such an option just because it would make it even easier for dupers. Yes, duping still exists. I still see a\*\*holes uploading Youtube videos on how to dupe after latest patch.   
---
Hey Bethesda, when are you going to fix duping for good?
---
Who has 100k of a single magazine or bobblehead or nuka cola legitimately?
---
Fuck you I love the Playtime Paint. I instabought. 
---
I'll try that when I get home, thanks.
---
Even WoW had places like this. It's a way to load assets into a world
---
If you don't mind them being dupes, than yeah, there's a lot on the market.
---
I quit "severely" anything with this game long ago!
---
I'd guess that most people who sell it to vendors either see no need for the armour for their own character, or they simply don't play with other people (Lone Wanderers), so selling to a vendor is the only option. 
---
The vendor bots are like the archetypal pawnbroker, except you can't borrow money. I've taken items to vendors and the offer is almost 95% less than the item's value--even as I know it's a video game, I actually feel angry at this cartoon robot in front of me, especially when I see that it already has one of the item available for the full value, so I know it's going to give me 23 caps for my rifle and then sell it for 475 caps. This has been so frustrating that I've literally given the item away to another low-level player rather than sell it for peanuts.
---
That said, I wonder if the ridiculous rates at vendors is designed specifically to encourage trading and selling between players. I heard once that the reason vendors only have 200 caps and have a cool down time for replenishing caps is to maintain balance and not allow any one player to amass a horde of funds to buy their way into an easier experience. One problem with this theory is that gear already has a level limiter---a 10th level player can't use or equip a 20th level item. Also, I've amassed over 9,000 caps as of last night, primarily because the only thing I ever buy from vendors is ballistic fiber and adhesive (seriously, that's all I ever buy); so the notion that a player having too many caps gives an unfair advantage isn't borne out by my experiences. 
---
Never had that happen to me.
---
Honestly I move mine to whatever general area I‚Äôm operating in/ exploring
---
I like to get bounties because it's fun to kill the bounty hunters. I've got a dragon and an two explosive rifles lol
---
Sorry that happened, mate. On another note players tend are starting to get bored so these things happen more and more often. Last night I was helping my friends lvl in a nuked zone. Some players 114-176 started harrassing them (lvl 49 and 61). I tried to kill them for my friends but there were too many of them and I was over run. I also didn't know that it flagged my friends for pvp...so rip, lol
---
Nice quality contribution bud. Sounds like you're part of the problem.
---
I have yet to do that one. I'm honestly happy I screwed around before doing some of these quests. Leveling up was the way to go. 
---
I was too busy picking flowers and building my C.A.M.P. to bother lol 
---
I ran with a hunting rifle for the first 40 levels of the game until I found something more powerful.  Gotta be pretty sleek because reload speed is the shits, but it dealt decent enough damage for the sub-50 enemies.
---
Only game ever played on PS4 that consitently blue screens like this.  Even when it doesn't you get shit like nuke zones where the loot simply never loads until Queen corpses despawn.
---
I meant when considering the 257 in the story...
---
Which if according to a person I tried to buy a BoS Paladin paint plan before discovering the cheat, he had bought it with cash from a person in a Discord chat.  So even they may not be the originating cheater.
---
I will start saving videos of it when I'm unwilling and one shot , you definitely drop junk when another player griefs you, worst of all , if you have all of your junk stored in stash, the game takes random amount of junk from stash to drop on the ground. Has been like this since launch . I am very meticulous about keeping exact count on all my mats. And I know exactly what I lose when it happens. Now I always grab a handful of bone shards before leaving camp, and I never res pawn near the griefer, so I can grab more bone shards.
---
Melee is king. What platform are you guys on? I could lend a hand if you are on xbox
---
Yeah really. I lost progress on Powering up Poseidon.
---
Wow it‚Äôs almost like there are multiple people with different opinions on the internet. 
---
He greifed me for awhile just following me around until I stopped running and just sat there, it was crazy, I got pissed and went for revenge and he one tapped me with it after that.
---
I hate those kinds of DC's.
---
It's funny how doors work in 76 to begin with. A lot of the time I click open on a closed door and it plays the closing door animation then I have to click open again to actually get the opening door animation.
---
 This is what your doors look like on drugs! Or maybe they need some mentats I don't know lol.
---
My favorite DC was when I bumped into another player walking through a doorway last night. The second we touched I got a DC.
---
Maybe I should post a Missed Connection: Dude in whitesprings with the American Paint Power Armor. When our PA brushed against each other I felt a spark........ but really we disconnected. Let's bump PA again sometime!
---
This unfortunately reminds me of one of the worst parts of Destiny 2 at launch; once you hit max level, you were doing a lot of grinding to get an item that was only *very slightly* an improvement over what you had before. Playing for hours just to see your average power level go up by... 1, is not a good feeling.
---
Agreed, a lot of things need fixing.  For the trolls, meeting these kind of people doesn‚Äôt affect me that much, the fact that it makes other players on edge when you approach them is what bothers me, you try to be nice and they usually misinterpret out of fear
---
Which platform? If it's PS4 send me a friend request. You can join me every time and if you need some help with griefers just tell me and I will take it for you :)
---
Nice view, but heaven helps anyone who misses that basket.
---
I didnt read the [PS4] part and was so confused on how you could get 4 BSOD with in 10 minutes on PC.
---
I have this fear of attacking a duper and being shot with so many stacking bobbleheads my character gets deleted.
---
Lazy youtube bandwagoning.
---
Tbh i don‚Äôt think it would solve too much. I recently met a duper online and he showed me some of his extra dump accounts, one of which having thousands of bobbleheads, 50 of each tse weapon in his inventory and there are supposedly hundreds if not thousands of other accounts like this, solely designed to churn a profit on these supposed-to-be rare items... the economy is busted, but if they remove all of the weapons in game then they‚Äôd lose a lot of their playerbase.
---
It would be nice to add a icon to players to show that they are in a team to anybody so you could account for situations like this, but for me I just go in thinking everybody is teams and to watch out for campers. 
---
Gotta respec to fireproof to see if that helps tank those little jackasses hiding. 
---
Capes? I knew it, you people are in kahoots with the Appalachia textile guilds!
---
Is the goal of this post to try and find a few people to play with? If so, posting platform and general play times would help. 
---
Generally, non-randoms are less likely to be jackasses so it might be worth it to build up your friends list.
---
It's a free kill. Nothing personal.
---
The Wanderer. I bought it on iTunes I liked it so much.
---
Was walking through work one day and this guy was saying people don‚Äôt listen to the music he likes anymore, and he started in on the lyrics. Three taps on my phone later and it was playing. 
---
He was impressed.
---
Go away, pathetic duper.
---
They are there in most games. They are usually better secured and the engines aren't always so buggy that everyone can bypass the security so easily. Sometimes you just need to test something in a live environment. Most MMOs had GM tools and rooms that were account locked or instanced. Bethesda appears to have chosen security through obscurity which never works.
---
It has been pretty stable since launch for me, but then yesterday's patch happened..... Lucky if I can play for longer than 20 minutes..... On a PS4 Pro. 
---
It reminds them of the Vault, returning to the Overseer‚Äôs Womb
---
I've tried a few times but never have it go through.
---
It's a trap, get an axe.
---
I think because some of the items/plans is for stuff they are going to release to the ATOM store.
---
I get you,  I've played solo until recently and now I can give items that are useless to me to my teammates. But yeah, I also gave the bulk of my weps away to other players. They just dont trust anymore. 
---
A fundamental truth with all AAAaaaaa publishers.
---
Sorry for you loss, cancer sucks the big one. The first year is going to suck but it does get better...don't be afraid to reach out. Like the game, there are lots of people out here that will help you along when you need it.
---
Stop the hissy fit. 
---
How do you know that they are going to lose tons of progress? Where's the proof?
---
Wouldn't be simpler, to temp lock the account, remove the items in question and then release the account back cleaned up?
---
Bethesda: What if we could save perk-card \*\*sets\*\*, enabling us to swap them out with a single click? Would be nice...
---
The insane and totally outlandish budget requirements a single turret has is just asinine. 
---
Everything that's happened has crossed a line, the dev room is just the easiest they can react to. Duped weapons aren't as easy to track down because a duped tse legendary looks the same as one you got as an honest drop, but all of the shit people stole from the dev room they know people shouldn't have so it's easier to single people out. 
---
To those so butthurt they have to downvote me, I don't give a shit if you claim bounties. More power to you. Have fun and godspeed.
---
But if you feel the need to stand up and brag about it, you're a bit of a tool.
---
Thank you! Yeah, I probably spent just as much time detailing as I did for building! Hahaha
---
Seen one several times at vendors, offered a +1 to some stat.
---
oh, one would assume so. I'm still in favour of turning the current marine helm into a dunce cap that can't be removed from their inventory for a few months.
---
Worse I got a message before saying my camp  could had passed as a part of the world and it was nicely furnished lol.
---
Later I realized it was a group of 3 
---
One high level 200
---
And two level 50 
---
And yes all running explosive weapons 
---
lol, exactly, these people practically branded themselves.
---
I don't want to speak too soon, but logged into xbx and did a SBQ fight with a lot of players that showed up after I nuked her and suprisingly the game ran smooth thru the whole fight.  Usually it tanks to FPS a$$ of like 10, but this time it was 20-30 ish from the looks.
---
Still had some situations of waiting for loot to load on dead bodies, but the queen loot herself came in instantly.  
---
Hopefully it's the patch but who knows, this was my first pleasant experience doing an SBQ in atleast 25+ runs of her.  
---
Im sorry, but no. You have the option, time is a resource. You can just have a second character with a scavenger build, with combat as a secondary activity. You don't need bother with picklocks, terminals, fast travel's cost or vendor prices... You only need choose. And in this game is very easy change your options, that's not a problem. Just choose.
---
I agree on this.  Im a mutant rifleman.  
---
6 in strength.  3 travel pharm, and 3 incisor.  For when mobs get close i switch to melee.  
---
Thru hiker/ travel pharm / deep pocketed gear/ marsupial help out alot in carry weight.  
---
I also have strongback 3 for that just incase i need more space scenarios.  Ill swap that in. 
---
Are we 100% its dupers? I mean what are the odds of me crashing 3 times and getting put into 3 different servers with people duping? I think this has something to do with the most recent patch as i maybe had 3 crashes for the entire month of December i played the game
---
do you happen to recall where/how  you got it?  Enclave mission perhaps?   I really despise PA and do not like wearing mismatched pieces from various sets to get the stats I want.  I have tried to purchase armor through the reddit marketplace but it seems that people either want actual cash or trades for those absurd TSE weapons.
---
I am going to hold out and finish the build.
---
It is a shame that pistols aren't even remotely viable until you get crit savvy, better crits and GRS, which are all pretty late in the leveling process.
---
I believe pipe double dipping is a bug, based on them removing double dipping from several other weapons, the M79 being an example from this last patch (it counted as shotgun and explosive). Obviously a dev was being lazy and either didn't apply programming that checks for stocks on these weapons, or there is a bug preventing the check from working.
---
Make sure you are modding your weapons, also weapons have levels. If you're level 25 and using a level 5 gun then you're going to have a bad time. Find weapons close to your level, same with armor. Use perk cards that increase your damage and always go for the head
---
Pay to win ruins games. Duh. But look at the creation club in FO4. At first it was cosmetics, then they added stuff that you could do in game like wave mode in the settlements and the like. I love BGS but I worry thier corporate side has more leverage than the creative side. I'm not saying they'll sell TSE shotguns. (NEVER DO THAT) but it's not an unreasonable fear. Emphasis on fear. I already payed full price for the game.
---
I only hunt bounties.
---
Munchkins vs Real Role Players LOL
---
This conversation is as old as the internet. I don't think anyone tries as hard as you to math it up.
---
If PC your welcome to add me ign Andychal11 iv build my character around grouping and you will be always welcome
---
 To use my home and any help I can give you your welcome to it 
---
Iv been lucky so far and not come across any toxic players but met a lot of nice people so I‚Äôd be happy to add ya 
---
If not pc hopefully you come across some nice people soon the community makes this game for me guess iv been one of the lucky ones 
---
I‚Äôm not really looking for a team, just wanted all those people to know I‚Äôm not a stuck up bitch. There‚Äôs a reason I won‚Äôt accept your (everyone‚Äôs) team invites. It‚Äôs just for personal protection. 
---
Thank you for the advice!
---
Crafting makes better armor and guns.  With better stats and... With the gun perk, keeps em from breaking as fast
---
If he bought it with cash, he already was breaking the TOS and should have been aware that it might not last.
---
Double barrels were my best friend all the way into my 40's make sure yoyr crafting guns that are your level or picking up and replacing old guns with guns your level I felt like I was not doing much damage realized I was using a lvl 5 hunting rifle crafted a new one and bam dropping muties like business as usual.
---
Story-wise, I agree with you completely. However, all the wikis I have visited do state that the quest "completes" once all holotapes are viewed. Currently it is still sitting in an active state in my log.
---
by "Went Straight to Watoga." do you mean leveled to 15 and went to Watoga of literally went straight to Watoga as a Lv2
---
Where the hell are all you bounty hunters on xbone? I spent like 2 hours with a 10 cap bounty for picking a lock on a supply drop I thought was a nuclear key card crate, lol. I shot down a drone and picked a locknand apparently it there was a supply drop next to the crate the drone dropped. Didn't see the drone drop, and picked the wrong lock simce they're both 0 lvl locks, XD
---
There is a camouflage one. Atom shop
---
Because these issues seem far and few between. For me and my wife on ps4 and ps4 lro the update has improved the game far more. Even the loot shows up faster without needing to wait for the server to kick up the loot in containers
---
Unreal. I wish there was a way to just make a private server to just avoid all of that
---
What is interesting about that is that I ONLY have Master lockpick.  I don't have any of the cards for lower level lockpick skills.  But when I equip it, I can only pick "level 1" locks or lower.  
---
With the lockpick cards, you have to equip multiple cards to pick higher level locks.
---
I had not heard of that requirement. I will try that the next chance I get. Thank you.
---
Very well done!  However I think your camp is missing a chandelier üòâ
---
I understand and agree with your feeling towards dupers. But there's really 2 things here that could be fixed to solve that issue.
---
1. Fix duping and my suggestion isn't an issue anymore.(Disconnects probably would be reduced due to increased server stability as well).
---
2. Fix Disconnects and my suggestion really isn't an issue anymore. (Assuming there are other optimizations on the network side to compensate for the server instability created by duping and crafting spam).
---
I've gotten several weapon plans from lvl 3 safes
---
Yeah I don't know why there is no hard carry limit. It's really dumb
---
That's what me and friends do, we get bounties on us just to lure these poor kids into traps lmao see how long it takes them to fall off that high horse
---
I got the handmade plans from, fuck what event was it...wasn‚Äôt the one near the jail, I wanna say Census Violence. Literally double taked when it happened.
---
&gt; No bethesda I don't want to paint my military hardware with hot wheels and toy themes .
---
Optimus Prime disapproves of this message
---
dammit...
---
Fair enough. Good luck out there. 
---
at the sake of destroying what game there was? Yeah, I didn't sign on for that.
---
Stopped using them altogether since my 6th move which is now in Cranberry Bog. Not missed them at all.
---
It's basically a large chatroom that uses a virtual environment rather than pure text channels, not a game. And it's not all kink -- I've run a very successful (as in 'put my nieces through preschool' successful) fishing game there for years.
---
Problem is it's got no growth potential, and the administration keeps rotating as people jump aboard with high hopes and then bail once they realize what a mess the company is. It's going nowhere but down, on a very, very slow descent.
---
I noticed that there‚Äôs a way to create a high wanted level just by destroying somebody‚Äôs camp and then allowing your team mate to collect the caps üòÇ lame since in theory you could set up a cap farm
---
Yes, but I don't feel safe unless I have both üòõ Lugging around 10,000+ rounds doesn't help either üòì üòâ
---
I have the Handmade modded with the fastest semi-auto receiver. Auto, to me, is too weak and wasteful.
---
Well, the glitch repaires PA as well as recharching, so maybe you're noticing it decrease since it no longer repairs. 
---
My exact aim of the game now I‚Äôve 100% it (minus every legendary) is hunting grinders, high levels especially because I believe that we should be helping lower levels and making them more interested than having them quit due to a bad time
---
I think I found that exact rock.  Was it at the side of the road near a 3 way intersection?  I'll have to get my photos out of my gaming PC so I can post them.
---
They did the same thing in Fallout 4. Well in that game you can place things using the workshop BUT they aren't static. I mean, if you put a lamp on a table it can be knocked off. So you could sort of decorate your house but when you come home everything was knocked off the table etc because a deathclaw had walked by or an npc had walked in etc.
---
There are mods that let you make things static in Fallout 4 (OC Decorator) and mods that let you put anything anywhere in your workshop (Place Everywhere) and mods that let you scrap every single item (Scrap Everything) etc. I assume that once we have private servers we can have these mods 
---
Maybe he just enjoyed fighting you and playing the game. Or he was trying to earn that trophy without getting wanted. I've been killed by people multiple times in a row. Very low penalty. Just some junk and caps. How else are you going to "git gud" if you don't try. Practice makes perfect!
---
while they at it, it could be better if same bobblehead increased the timer for extra hour (maybe with cap)
---
This would be great, but I would love to be able to have a larger photo album (at least for xbox idk if pc or ps4 have larger albums) 
---
Same. Not worth it. 
---
I've tested using more then one tech data and it makes no difference to the reward so don't waste them, just grab one and drop it then repeat, you will get better odds. I have been meaning to test if luck makes a difference by using a bobblehead but just haven't got on to it yet.
---
I agree that afking at a vendor is really poor to do.... but I would like to add that there IS a difference between afking and taking your time USING the vendor.  Some high level ppl are really impatient and start attacking or getting abusive if they're "in line" for the vendor for more than a minute or two. Five minutes sometimes while using a vendor and going back and forth to stash and checking plans and w/e isn't unreasonable.... esp if it is lower level newer players that are still getting used to the screens and things they need.  Don't be an ass to ppl.
---
A lot of the wikis seem to be getting things wrong though. I'd like to see how many people have had this quest actually complete. 
---
Well duh, come on man, fuck laser gatlings and gauss rifles, we all know the SB's weakness is pipe weapons. 
---
I do that every server :) just a loyal BoS Soldier looking to contribute to the cause.
---
If you do the Motherlode quest, it will unlock the ability to craft combat rifles. That's what I used
---
I agree this is a problem, but I don't think it's once we can just lay on the shoulders of the players. It's also a game design issue that Bethesda needs to fix. They could have it only scale based on who has done damage recently, or based on other factors.
---
Is there anywhere in game that talks about the Queen having different resistance based on nearby players? I don't know of anything else in the game that works that way. Most players are not on Reddit, and might not know.
---
Oh there are about 40 ghouls slapping me in the golf club.  Best take my time getting up, don't want to pull a muscle! 
---
Lucky lol. I waited a month for a big patch that creates more problems then it solves. I cant even play the game properly, and this is shit that i would never have expected on a console version of a game, maybe a PC version, but this is just ridiculous
---
a camo one to go with my camo combat limbs would be nice
---
And no I don‚Äôt do it it‚Äôs just I know how
---
Oh there are about 40 ghouls slapping me in the golf club. Best take my time getting up, don't want to pull a muscle! 
---
Power to ya.  I have limited time to play and am still lvl 27 despite starting shortly after commercial release.  The only time I ever had a bounty, I ran to the nearest dot on the map and ran circles around them armorless and empty-handed until they worked it out and capped me.  Having very little time to play, I prefer to spend it exploring and doing quests rather than rebuilding my fucking CAMP after some asswad levels it.
---
Go get 'em, Frank Castle.
---
I doubt it.  If anything it was Initiate, the BoS Knight paint is likely stolen and I'd undo it to something else immediately.
---
The root cause is that any client or server crash has the potential to dupe items. So they just find a new way to crash the client or the server.
---
Until there are no reproducible ways to crash the game, or they change how the client -&gt;server deals with items, then people will keep doing it.
---
From what I have heard the newest method crashes the whole server and potentially reverts everyone back about 10 minutes. So if you find something really good make sure to log out/in to immediatly save it to your account.
---
something new for me to try.  nice.
---
Fair point.
---
Found my 1st mouth harp, in Watoga last night along the water. Had.To.Mouth.Harp. Would do again!
---
Why?  I'd rather not have all vendors linked to same cap stash amount. 
---
I don't mind paying the caps to fast travel if it means being able to dump my bulk junk for caps to buy other stuff.
---
That's likely what it is, ATOM shop items.
---
This is me every day lol
---
I have an executioners explosive Radium and I‚Äôm a HUGE fan of the Powerful Automatic Receiver. I have a VATS-oriented build and it can deliver a ton of shots in one AP bar. It‚Äôs actually probably less efficient than a single shot version but damn if it isn‚Äôt more fun. As for the other options I haven‚Äôt many mods, but I suggest a glow sight and a mag that has more ammo.
---
Don‚Äôt use it on Ghouls. It‚Äôs weird watching their health jump up and down.
---
Mole Rat teeth are used in Mole Miner Gauntlet upgrades
---
Not everyone does that, maybe 5% of the playerbase will behave like that. I understand how it can be intimidating for lower levels, I'm level 152 and have people running when I show up and all I'm trying to do is unload my excessive amount of stimpacks. Having really bad anxiety is hard to deal with, I know from personal experience. But just in the hopes it comforts you, not everyone is out to mess with you, there are far more good people than there are bad in the game
---
As a counter to that arguement...  I run around in a creepy mask and a clown outfit wielding a chainsaw.  NOT as a fortnite "hey Look at ME!" thing... but as a creepy encounter in the wasteland.
---
So for me... this playtime armor was great!  Hoping out of that thing as the Appalachia Creeper Clown is just great.
---
Photo mode loading screens are one thing this game nailed.
---
Thanks. Thas good to know. I got my info from the interwebs. Now to go back there and get that 5th one!
---
Tbh when I get something too close and I cant jump away, I bust out my All Rise for it. Which I think why I've kept so much in strength + radicool. The PA let's me take some punishment and none of the big bursts of rads the ghouls can push out, and let me melee if I have to.
---
I had a server disconnect the other day. Then I realised I'd crossed my legs and kicked the plug out of the PS4.
---
I definitely don't think you're right about dropping them and picking them up again üòâ If you don't have a lot of mods, which I didn't with either the Handmade or the Lever Action before I got the plans, the mods will come really fast with the first ten or so you scrap.
---
Forgot about the maps! Great point. 
---
I don‚Äôt think so , it becomes part of the vendors economy.
---
If you try to sell these weapons you‚Äôre never going to get over 50 caps for anything.
---
lockpick is the worst.... Y 3 cards it's just plan stupid i dont even look at safes any more
---
Umm...it's not a cap farm since your friend would be taking YOUR 500 caps lol. 
---
Oh boy i cant believe ive done this. Thanks for pointing that out. 
---
We really need more stairs options for this game. The ones from FO4, L-shaped, U-shaped, circle ones and the ability to place stairs more freely rather than just at the center of floors.
---
Heres to hoping!
---
I always help lower levels as I level up. These assholes (and whomever is down voting ) don't make me want to quit. I;m also trying to 100% lol. Its been really fun!
---
2 shot is useful and even effective on big things, like Scorched Beasts, against smaller targets not so much.
---
Hand it in as repeatable Brotherhood Of Steel quest. Gives random rewards which can give BoS Mods/Clothes etc
---
The waiting time should be no more than 1 second.
---
Wow this is amazing! Wish I was on ps4 so i could check ot out for myself. Would love to see someone post a video walkthrough of it after exploring. 
---
Would someone really be so lucky as to have more than one of those weapons though with the RNG factor?
---
I don‚Äôt actually have that paint on anything, which is why I‚Äôll have to confirm what I actually have later today. I only have the X-01 and Excavator PA. I know, a lot of help I‚Äôm being right now, sorry peeps. 
---
Agreed. Im tired of it.
---
You can look at how to get the excavator power armor and then you can craft a full set of that. Also when you hit level 45 you can craft the highest level version that it comes in.
---
That would be cool!
---
Seeing how the guy is getting downvoted for a pretty classic scene that anyone over the age of 25 will know, seems like an obvious conclusion.
---
I believe there is a text chat mod somewhere for fo76.
---
I had to make a second character to get some of the achievements cos I earned them in the beta
---
They need to decide what is "too" much of certain items and ban accounts that have them. Not characters, but whole accounts.
---
For a game that doesn't rely on player base for anything really (no matchmaking, etc.) who cares if a bunch of accounts get banned. A certain number will re-buy the game and it will probably make them more money then they lose since word-of-mouth is already so bad.
---
IDK a single person that wouldn't buy a game because they "ban cheaters".
---
I try to do that when I see ppl enter the vendor area I'm using just to let them know I'm there and friendly and not afk.
---
It can be.  Harpers is a nice mutant farm location. Couple legendaries with sometime 1-2 3* ones.   
---
Treat it like any normal gun. A handmade does more damage than an assault rifle so a tse will do the same. A lever action does more damage than a handmade but less than a hunting rifle. So a tse will be the same. Literally nothing is different about the weapon except inflated damage numbers
---
played for a few hours yesterday and even nuked the SBQ and game was stable, no crashes on xbx.  
---
Yup I got reported two days ago because I beat this guy and he refused to get of his high horse.
---
I was wondering about this. I haven't spent much time working on my camp, or even playing if I'm being honest, so I was confused as to how this could fit the budget. I didn't think it increased. I didn't realize turrets took up so much of it. That doesn't make much sense to me.
---
A server crash is only one of the reasons you may disconnect without getting a warning not the only reason. 
---
She's been annoying for me.  Earlier this week I had to do the " Make 'friends' with a Deathclaw " twice... cause the first time didn't count.
---
Then she asked me to go steal from a Super Mutant Camp, and it didn't tell me where.  So I went to three different places I knew they camped out at.  None counted.
---
Yesterday though the Super Mutant marker updated and I was able to go find it.
---
I don't think it works like that. You get whatever caps they have on hand, so a 500 cap bounty claimed from a person with only 100 keeps is a 100 cap bounty. At that point they're supposed to end up in penalty, but that's uh... it's either inconsistent or the penalty just isn't high enough to matter for many players.
---
You can (as most players with large bounties do) have a friend wipe your bounty and split/pay you back the caps so you can go on your CAMP rampage for "free".
---
It‚Äôs to people who complain afterwards like ‚Äúwhy do people waste their time on bounties‚Äù
---
I'm getting tired of swapping the cards out as well.  FFS make some abilities just passive so we don't have to constantly shuffle cards around in perk screen just to pick a lock, hack a terminal, or craft something or repair something all the time!
---
Nice.
---
Heart emote.
---
This is just too lenient on Bethesda's part - they should always perma ban all the cheaters and exploiters.
---
&gt;  The whole need for a build thing
---
huh ? 
---
The damage resistance was most likely from the vanguard armor and a bunch of other stuff. It's often traded amongst dupers, highly sought after, I uploaded a clip yesterday of me nailing someone four times while he was standing still with a Tse gauss rifle that does 1.7k damage. His health bottomed out but he didn't go down, immediately roasted me with a shotgun. 
---
If it helps, I had this happen.  It didnt delete the character, but it definitely blew every piece of armor off my freshly repaired (200%) x-01 power armor.
---
It took me less than 20mins to get it all repaired.  It was hella infuriating, but it's not the end of the world.  However, I wouldn't mind if those guys did encounter the end of the world in a rather painful manner.
---
Great job!  Rustic looking, pretty nice!  Mine is on that spot too, I love the position and view.  The ground is teedious to build onto but the spot is real cool.
---
As stated already, updrade your weapons. Some are upgradeable at 10/20/30, some at 15/25 etc... Break down any duplicate (or lesser quality) versions of the same weapons you use for mods. The difference between a stock lvl5 whatevergun and a 'lvl20 hardened, armor piercing whatevergun' is night/day.
---
Also depends on your build and your tactics. My latest build is a auto pistol (guerilla) that on paper looks way underpowered but a well timed crit auto burst to the head from a lvl15 10mm only doing 24 dmg per shot can easily mow down a lvl68 Scorched conqueror. If I went all Leroy Jenkins on a high lvl mob i'd die right quick
---
I'd buy a handmade skin on the spot. At least it would justify my saving.
---
I had initially hoped that Straitjackets were another source of Ballistic Fiber, but the caps are nice.
---
Huh, I made level 30 leather armor and I'm 90% certain in hindsight that it did require it.  I've been wrong before, though, so I may be here.
---
I miswrote that to an extent. I know some people who trade up for items worth a lot of caps, legitimately with the hopes of selling them at some point. I was in a position where I had 4 tse .50 cals in my inventory all with the same legendary effects because the tse .50 with agility was being sold by multiple different people at low prices and I was thinking that I could make some $ off the top. What would stop me from getting banned? Also what about ammo or items that theoretically can‚Äôt have a unique id per item.
---
It‚Äôs actually a quite popular thing on this sub for people to sensationalize stories and even outright fabricate them. I‚Äôm just calling a spade a spade
---
Hmm okay, I bought one before most of the duping business so that must've brought the price down
---
The first time for me the Deathclaw didn't spawn in immediately, and nearly took me out when it finally spawned next to me.
---
Go to Gilman Lumbermill (you can fast travel to Vault 76) then go to the pond with the picnic table. There will be a black inner tube floating in the water.
---
Chickens randomly spawn here, could be radstags, frogs or fireflies or foxes.
---
If there's no chicken, log out and back in, you'll get one eventually.
---
level 100 + with bounty &lt; 10 usually isn't worth the effort.
---
It is behind awful in vats.   
---
Shotguns require you to get up close and personal to deal good damage, so maybe try a lever action rifle or a hunting rifle - which you can throw a long barrel on, or modify to a proper sniper rifle. Remember that you get a 2x damage boost from stealth, and then toggle to a melee weapon if you don't immediately kill the enemy and it charges you. 
---
If you're on PS4, let me know.  Ill hook you both up with pimped out weapons
---
I learned long ago (Ultima Online) that most people in online games are just turds. Make people autonomous anywhere (in a game or say in a car) and they usually act poorly. 20 years later, I dont even try to engage people.
---
I try and be that guy, I'm lvl 123 right now and have been helping lower level players as often as I see them. I drop plans, meds, ammo and scrap and also try and make sure if I'm assisting in kills they get a hit in to get the xp and loot. As a long time player of Fallout and Elder Scrolls I always wanted a co-op game to just this. I am Trillian69(69 is the year I was born) so if you see me say hi on PC version, my camp is player friendly now that my pet Mega sloth has vanished and just between the Twin Lakes marker and the Investegator's Cabin.
---
One at the top of the Poseidon Power Plant 
---
I agree, all these bounty hunters are bragging, so I was just joking around. 
---
Sure but where‚Äôs the cutoff? 10k? 5k 500? 50? 10?
---
I bought the brick set off the Harpers Ferry vendor
---
It's particularly bad in certain areas where you have multiple locked containers and enemies. I'll literally switch in my lockpick cards, unlock something, switch back to rifle perks to fight some ghouls, then switch right back to lockpick for a container in the next room. It's not fun, at all, and it's not skill-based. It's just pure tedium.
---
This is why I‚Äôm loving my tse harpoon gun for bounty hunting. Attach a scope and the flechettes mod and you get a heavy shotgun sniper with exploding shots. Even if the player has fireproof maxed out the shot itself will do more than enough to kill them. No need to expose myself to other players. Sight in, shoot, travel away.
---
Do you ever get on the mic and tell them this? I do. Get on the mic and tell them to clear out of the shed and fight something or you're going to come in and murder them all. Works sometimes. 
---
Mine just stopped appearing in my pip boy
---
So crafting will put weapons at the appropriate levels?
---
&gt; No he used an expression to help illustrate his point. Not to be taken literally and you know that. 
---
My comments addressed both the title and content of the post directly. Did you notice how the OP and I are not actually arguing about this? Did you notice how I provided other examples from the game to support the observation I made? Did you notice how the bulk of your comments are focused on your opinion of the validity of my comments rather than contributing substantively to the actual discussion? Which one of is truly arguing for the sake of arguing here? 
---
&gt;Stop trying to over analyze things and stray from the topic.
---
I think I'll analyze things as much as I deem appropriate, thanks.
---
&gt;You would think someone who wears it cosmetically would not be against legendary versions either, and I don't think you are against it.
---
Nobody in this discussion said they were either for or against legendary versions. Even the OP simply made the observation that they don't exist. You are the one here who is straying from the point and making points nobody is arguing.
---
&gt;You just saw an opportunity to argue and took it.
---
No, I made comments that were on-topic. Cosmetic concerns are enough reason to put something in the game. It literally answers the question "Why even put it in the game?" that was posed in the title.
---
Since the OP asked if there was a reason besides cosmetic, I also offered the observation that if you examine armor based on its statistics, many sets of armor really offer little value to players. This was not an argument. I was not disagreeing with the OP. I was offering reasoning (combined with my comments on cosmetic value) that statistics alone were not what justifies an armor's existence.
---
My actual point, and I apologize if this was too subtle and I did not state it explicitly, was this: Neither cosmetics nor statistics alone constitute a reason for something being included in the game. Some armor looks better than others. Some armor functions better than others. Most people will likely pick one that is the best mix of those two things for them.
---
Did Bethesda probably screw up by not offering as many customization options and legendary variants for this particular armor set? Probably. Does this set of armor appear to be a bit lackluster? I can get on board with that sentiment. Should this (the lack of customization options and legendary variants, at least) be fixed? Probably, but it's most likely not on the top of their list of things to fix. The thing you seem to be missing here, however, is the OP didn't actually ask these questions. They simply stated that these options were missing, and the only question they actually asked was "Urban Scout Armor - why even put it in the game?" And I believe I responded to that particular question in a manner that was distinctly on-topic.
---
&gt;Again, a straw man argument (an argument nobody is making) that just because **we** think one kind of armor should be buffed does not mean **we** are not also of the opinion that "a lot of armor in the game is of dubious value".
---
This might be a valid position if I was at all commenting on whether or not the armor should or should not be buffed or the OP actually offered an opinion that it should be. Neither of those things are true. It's interesting how you think the straw man claim only applies to people other than yourself.
---
I also noticed you used "we" here several times. You may want to consider the wisdom (or lack therof) of speaking for anyone but yourself. It's generally not a good idea.
---
&gt;However, I prefer to wear unyeielding armor, and most armour has the capability to drop with that prefix.
---
I don't recall the OP or I mentioning anything about unyielding armor. To quote you: "Stop trying to over analyze things and stray from the topic."
---
Even if this were actually on-topic to the exchange between the OP and myself, having the "Unyielding" prefix available as a possibility on a crap piece of armor doesn't inherently make that entire set of armor worthwhile and justify its inclusion in the game.
---
But please do keep telling me how I'm the one with all the straw-man arguments here and I'm the one who is arguing for the sake of arguing. If nothing else, it's entertaining and making me laugh, so thank you for that.
---
Thanks been wanting to find them for a while 
---
I had a guy report me and 2 friends because he refused to accept the fact his friend took off pacifist to fight us. They kept dying and he got mad and reported us even tho there was very clear evidence his friend was no longer in pacifist mode. Called us cheaters and hackers, some people never learn
---
A lot of enemies in this game are bullet sponges compared to melee builds, so you might consider trying that angle assuming you have been upgrading your weapon levels and with mods.
---
Probably not.  Concevible they have 2 maybe.  But a duper isn't making 5...they make hundreds.
---
The optimized servos is not showing as available mods?  Check the components that the mod breaks down into... if it's not black titanium then it's for a different power armor style.
---
Level 24 Assaultrons could still kick my ass at level 90 
---
Yeah, I thought that too but now that I think about it, we downed him twice (not once) in a couple of shots before he got back without taking any damage from us, he either equipped something new (but I don't think so cause he had a scout armor on and did not change it afterwards) or he used an exploit
---
The issue we have is finding weapons at our level it's very rare we find them or are underleveled for what we do find. Any suggestions?
---
I just assume most high priced bounties are traps.
---
Maybe. These guys are what you sound like IMO.

If you would actually scroll through the shop, you would see there is a camouflage scheme for both power armor and normal armor...
---
Then don‚Äôt play the game it wasn‚Äôt meant to be played.
---
Pick a build and stick with it.
---
Same situation lol
---
I have a base up here too, it's a little too popular. I'm not a huge fan of floating structures but I know it's difficult to build here as it took me 2 hours to get the foundations right.
---
It was deffo an enclave mission but uncertain if it was part of a reward for doing their main quest or the enclave mission that popped up at Harper's ferry 
---
And then raiders, attracted to the garish colors this simpleton is garbed in, in this bleak nuclear wasteland, cook this person with gamma guns, and eat them.  Play time for the Gormands.
---
There's a reason they're announcing these as soft locks and not outright suspensions or bans, contrary to popular belief Bethesda isn't run by fucking idiots.
---
They know that people are trading these things around and that many of the recipients are clueless as to where the stuff came from. Their priority here is not indiscriminate punishment. Their priority is to remove the items from circulation and then where possible track them back to who was passing them out in the first place. 
---
They've already did it before, with the Fasnacht Masks, after the latest update they've removed them from player inventories and stashes. I guess they're scanning for them now since they've been probably taken from the dev room again.
---
That's why this is a throw away. Just trying to help others that were scammed. You guys can defend your pile, I guess you're use too the stench so don't know it's even there.
---
Must have hit every xp hack in the game and played 18 hours a day.
---
Honestly I use a build featuring all the generic damage perks (bloody mess, tenderizer, adrenaline, gun-fu) and VATS stuff and I do a ton of damage with almost all ranged weapons. I can effectively use  10mm pistol zero star on anything not in a nuke zone, and either a .50 cal explosive or explosive automatic radium rifle for groups. The damage from Gun-Fu and Adrenaline really adds up fast, and clearing areas of multiple dudes from multiple angles is a breeze. 
---
There‚Äôs a little room in the build for a few points in either rifles or pistols perks. I don‚Äôt recommend this build for str based characters.
---
If you want I can link to it, but I‚Äôd have to find it on my PC.
---
best looking armor IMO. just wish the Gas Mask could be worn with other head gear.
---
Was it crap?
---
I find stuff that's Hunter's Raider Left Arm with +1 INT with Sentinel (-15% damage from animals, -15% damage while standing still, +1 INT) and that's just not useful.
---
The expensive stuff is Assassin's Sentinel with STR +1 or weight reduction, etc.
---
Wouldn't doubt exploits at all. Was trading with someone who had a mountain of bobble heads recently as well. 
---
My condolences!
---
Exactly. Although if duping was fixed, i would love to return to a previous server. Would be nice to claim a workshop, build it up, and be able to return to that server later on the next time you're looking for a world. Reclaiming a workshop would remove the hassle of having to rebuild a workshop every single time.
---
Show me where the raiders hurt you here on bubblegum bear. 
---
Or do you mean regular olive drab?
---
That‚Äôs a very functional paint I would also like to see 
---
Screws, aluminum, or acid, Ill almost always take those right away. Wastelands tough yo. 
---
I can't remember the name of the location, but if you are at the raider train station at the north end of the line, follow the line south. Almost immediately, you'll come across a dilapidated shack. I routinely find a number of chickens there.
---
First one is just ganking.  Griefing usually involves using the game in unintended ways to ..well..cause grief.  (Example being: using low level invulnerability to block a door or bobbleheads exploit or deliberately talking to trader and going afk so others cant)  Killing a low level is literally one of the definitions of ganking.
---
I literally have done no pvp in this game but I got it knowing that this is a game that has these things.   You shouldn't enter into a game with these rules if you're fundamentally against the rules.  Low levels can be killed, camps can be destroyed, say uno on your last card, do not pass go.    Monopoly for example, does not need a pve server, I will steal all your money if I play, because that's the kind of game it is.   
---
No it was assasins sentinal with 1 random special, 4 pieces
---
I like your taste in movies. I keep the collar with me always.
---
Please tell me Dynamo wasn't your favorite.
---
Thanks I'll check that out
---
Wow you hid them well
---
Which head? I'm not sure if I'm missing something 
---
For the first couple of weeks, there were a lot of high level characters and almost none of them got there without exploiting a glitch. Of course, as time went on, people quickly caught up legally, but during that short period high-level players got a bad rap.
---
Seconded. If PS4, I can hook you up with guns.  Wife with Melee
---
Nah don't worry about it.  Alot of people don't accept random invites.  Myself included unless in SBQ fight or Whitesprings.  You needn't feel the pressure to join when you see an invite.  üòÅ
---
One youtuber brought up that the "5 packs" look like something that would be way too easy to monetize.  God save us from that idea if Bethesda micros this even further....
---
Howd you get that green carpet? What plan was that from?
---
Yeah...  I did not really pay much attention to it at first, met quite a few dupers in 400+ game hours but I had never encountered this exploit before so I was a bit puzzled when it happened
---
Not much in this game is guaranteed. So because of RNG, farming is your best friend. If you can find enemies that are at or slightly above your level then you will most likely be able to get something useful. For mid 20s I would suggest the ash heap down south or the toxic valley up north
---
Wouldn't be so tedious is you could hot key perks, or mark favorites and show only favorites
---
Wish it was that lucky with the card packs I'm level 59 still haven't gotten master slugger got scaly skin and plague aura 
---
Howd you get that green carpet? What plan is that from?
---
I would rather not because what if he decides to kill you 
---
I'll check when I get home but I was able to turn my helmet the same dark blue to match the BoS blue.
---
Totally agree. Can't tell you how many times I've taken over the Landfill, Ammo Factory, or one of the power plants only to waste precious resources out of pocket just to see a Disconnect message.

Like really? ITS OKAY, not like I built 15 water purifiers or anything......

I've 100% stopped picking/hacking anything that isn't directly in my way.
---
what fucking nonsense
---
Why not try playing one of the earlier games and seeing if that's more your thing. There's like what 6? Games before this one.
---
No one cares.

I love the creeper peepers, OP. Nice looking house!

He just HACK

WHACK

CHOPPIN THAT MEAT

I had a similar experience after logging in and seeing a camp near mine. I went over to see it and drop some plans/recipes if it looked like the guy could use them. I'm lvl 90 something when this happens and the player was a lvl30ish, he took a few shots at me so I stopped and waved, no power armour or weapon out, they then just logged out. I actually felt sad that he perceived me as a threat.
---
You can still keep them but only equip them when you need them
---
If they are able to ban people that got items out of the "dev room" then they can poll users items for anything.  A duper isn't going to have 40 of one bobblehead and then regular quantities of everything else.  There going to have multiples of everything.  This really can't be hard to figure out.
---
If he was willing to lose 600 caps instead of giving up a 3 caps profit then he deserves what he got. Even trowing him a stimpack would have been enough but no he had to have principles.
---
Let people have fun! 
---
I have three turrets but will probably bring that down to two as I'm maxed out on my build budget and I want to add some stuff. I like them. They're company. And they chew up the ghouls, deathclaws and supermutants nicely. They have trouble with radrats and molerats chewing the walls though, since they're roof mounted.
---
Well they need to either 1.) change how the item system works so they can detect dupers somehow or 2.) do a sweeping ban based on pure item counts or 3.) do both.
---
The trick with number 2 is not setting the threshold so low that regular users get caught up in it.
---
I doubt they would ever punish players for having duped items, how are you supposed to know if those are duped weapons or not.
---
But someone with 10k+ of that gun across all their characters. Yeah ban them.
---
I think you would be a lot happier playing fallout 3, 4, or New Vegas. 
---
And your the reason why people don't like to have an input and the reason why games don't get sorted. 
---
These players are running the game. I'm only a level 22 right now but I had a bunch of bobbleheads, plans and recipes I didn't need, so over a few games I tracked down all the low-level players I could find. Not one could be tempted to trade with me and all I was doing was giving these things away for zero caps. Such a shame. 
---
That is the good part, the reason to follow this. 
---
After 8 tries, I got the blinded Bos underarmor plans.
---
So you're done playing fallout forever because something happened one time that would take two minutes to fix. Fuck, that's rough, man.
---
you seriously are talking fucking nonsense tho. anybody in the industry would laugh at your pathetic posturing.
---
Is the metal set only available at Grahan?
---
If you had done any research prior to purchase you'd have found that fallout 4 is not the same game as fallout 76. Its a spinoff not the next big single player fallout
---
It's back to normal now.  They must increase server resources after a patch then scale down after. 
---
I've heard rumors that if you're on top of or in the shed, she won't land, explosives make her take off, leveling up during the event crashes the server, and that if she falls on the fissure site, she falls in and you can't collect the rewards.
---
Remembered where I got It, enclave quest : officer on deck, reward: last bastion, +5% accuracy with ballistic weapons effect.
---
Wait until you're in your mid 40's and heat flashes will come to you just fine :p (kidding!)
---
But for serious: harass some bees
---
Darn, what did I miss? What loot boxes and how could they be illegal? 
---
Yeah. I have seen weightless armor. 
---
Someone gave me the impression that really light armor woluldn't hinder it. 
---
Need source on this one.
---
Take my upvote you sneaky bastard!  Props to you!
---
This. Even keeping an eye on vendors can give you a boost. The quad lever action I bought from a vendor was a huge upgrade. 
---
I have a completely sealed building with just the nuclear generator in it and wild dogs will spawn ***inside*** the fucking thing. 
---
Yup Im done with it. It should be fixed properly before release you know before they take people's money for a game that doesn't wotk
---
Duper
---
Actually you don‚Äôt.
---
My suggestion allows folks to choose  which missions they want to
---
Complete and cooperatively
---
But I‚Äôve noticed some items you could loot are no longer allowed if you don‚Äôt have the quest 
---
Be a better person? What in the world does that have to do with the Atom Shop OBJECTIVELY being in inferior to a literal handful of Armor mods from some dude in his basement that didn't have a multi-million dollar budget and huge team behind him?
---
Granted, though honestly how will they be able to police that other than doing a 'sting' where they buy the product from someone and then ban the seller?
---
Again, is 40 the cutoff? Are you certain anyone that has 39 is legit and anyone with 40 is a duper?
---
where the drops for the handmade rifle also tied to the level? I am level 107 and cant remember when I got my last Handmade rifle as a enemy-drop until yesterday were i got 3 rifles.
---
I'm not really scared of that. I just store my junk before I attack the guy. What else can I lose? A few caps, but at least I waked the guy up.
---
Unless you log out at whitesprings. Then don't take it off unless you put on a hazmat suit after.
---
Tigle is not self explanetory because i don't know how duping works.
---
I've seen this numerous times. Fixes that I have personally noticed:
---
* log out / log in
---
* oddly enough, share quest with a team and \_they\_ can see the marker
---

I want them to introduce a Morse Code device you install at your base.  Then you could communicate with others who have one. :)
---
Sorry, I play on toaster PC
---
Stop spamming this sub. We heard you. Go away.
---
Hey you, not sure if you knew but you can get these to be in the loading screens for the game.
---
This game is the worst version of the prisoners dilemma I have ever played.

Would love to know what they really are 
---
So by committing credit card fraud you can get a refund?
---
Luckily you can still go exchange it for fallout 4 if you want.
---
Too bad, I've really been enjoying my time in 76.
---
It's not for everyone though.  Hope you have fun with your next game.
---
We are the thee aaaaaaaaAAAAmigos! 
---
That‚Äôs how I woulda done it. Their scripted tool pulls up a lot of information, including Mac and
---
IP address, dns &amp; host name.
---
Do you really think anyone in this game legitimately has 40 of any TSE?  Do you think anyone, legitimately, has more then 1 or 2 of the same TSE?  Highly doubtful.  So for a TSE you can see if they have more then 5 to identify the account then go from there.
---
This isn't rocket science.
---
This right here , exactly another issue with this system lol 
---
Don't see why you couldn't ban someone for having 20k of something in their inventory. Plus, couldn't you detect the duping itself?
---
Honestly, 300 hours in and have never ever found one.
---
5 points for 100% damage. That's all that you should need to see to decide if its worth the trade off.
---
Compare to: rifles, pistols,shotguns,melee. For 5 points you can get at the most (10+10+20) 40% damage. Or for 9 points you can get 60%.
---
Demolition expert is what makes TSE weapons so overpowered
---
I've seen them several times at that cooking station between the Vault and the Moonshiner's Shack.
---
ripper or chainsaw, make sure you overheal it as much as you can.

It is a queenkiller :)
---
Hey, I got a dumb question: Aren't all containers linked, making separately labeled boxes like "chems" and "ammo" pointless? Or did you just do that cuz it looks cool? Or am I wrong about how containers work?
---
No, you used the same excuse as countless others, "a better informed public." Problem is, nobody gains anything from it but dupers. Non-dupers won't do anything about it, and are already riled up, so their voices will get no louder. Dupers, meanwhile, specifically the ones who are not smart enough to figure things out for themselves or limit themselves to keep from crashing the market, gain a leg up on their effort. Yes, they'll figure out eventually, but you causing it sooner does nobody any good... except for you, who gains the clicks and attention.
---
No, Bethesda hasn't does anything to the others yet. The key word being \*yet\*. They may not do anything at all. But you leave yourself open to litigation if you willingly and knowingly share this sort of thing. Is that somehow worth the hypothetical nothing you gain for being a "good citizen", or even the hypothetical clicks you could gain?
---
You did your part in reporting it. If you're really driven by altruism, there is nothing to gain by publishing.
---
This makes no sense.
---
Fair enough, I genuinely wouldn‚Äôt be that mad if they created such a system, even if they removed the weapons from people‚Äôs accounts to save the game in the long term.
---
Is your game installed on the PS4 Pro hard drive or on an external one? I‚Äôm starting to think the problems are because my game is installed on the external.
---
Ayyye... I got the same one
---
So 2 star with sentinel?
---
Probably crap. I sell Assassin's Sentinel to Watoga if it isn't 3 star with +STR, weight reduction, etc. There's not a whole lot of point in keeping it otherwise. Maybe the person who sold it to Watoga was clearing out their old set.
---
Or maybe they just didn't know how to check the second effect and thought it was just PVP armor. :P
---
Shit people gonna shitpost.
---
Seriously

Luck hasn't rly gone my way for the most part, [but I got it in my first Patrol Duty ever](https://i.imgur.com/Cwj0ejF.jpg). I know that doesn't rly help your luck but I though maybe it'll be a confidence booster to keep grinding.

She landed at maybe 75%, and died in seconds at the most.  Think this was a dupped bobbleheaded using melee?

I play the game. But even I have to admit Fallout 76 is not the best look for the Fallout franchise. Try the earlier versions. 3, New Vegas and 4. All single player. 4 has a terrible story but I had fun playing it. Even on PS4 there are tons of free mods for Fallout 4 that improve the game drastically. 
---
Why not push for a spiral staircase? That would be awesome. Even if it took 2 floor spots!
---
Looks good.   What's the location? I love cliff camps
---
Ask for help and list your platform. There are crews of SBQ killers who would love a good reason to kill her for the 500th time.

Judging an entire series by a spinoff that has negative to mixed reviews.
---
This is some next level stupidity. Next you're gonna tell me you're never gonna play another elder scrolls game cuz the only one you played was a mobile card game.
---
Fuck outta here.

Change the paint or remove the paint

Thanks op for making me laugh.
---
If you dont let other people tag legendaries during public events, you're a cunt.
---
When the dupers outsell the Atom Store thats when BGS steps in.
---
Right, like, 20k of wood and boiled water wouldn't make sense. But 20k of TSE weapons is an obvious.
---
belgium's gambling commission decided after looking into it that loot boxes are gambling and fall under the laws governing such. other countries has started looking into it (including a couple of states in the USA).  
---
as far as loot boxes in fo76 a while back some data miner found lunchboxes in the code, but as far as anyone knows it could have been leftover code from programing the atom store and testing buffs. there is currently nothing to suggest loot boxes are coming to fo76 other than fearmongering attention seeking trolls.
---
This is wonderful it looks very well planned out. You did a great job!
---
Real cute! I'm going to have to stop by sometime after I get off work and check it out! You should dm me your gamertag!

In 2016, the Reddit user base was 64 percent between the ages of 18 and 29, and another 29 percent were between the ages of 30 and 49. Only 6 percent of Reddit users were found to be between the ages of 50 and 64, and just a single percent were 65 or older.https://www.techjunkie.com/demographics-reddit/

If he's seen and know of three amigos it's a pretty safe assumption to be honest... 
---
I was broke a week ago due to buying a ton of mats, I'm now over 10k just farming the vendors and cap stashes. It is damn easy to be a rich player without exploits in this game. Crafting meds with Chemist and Super Duper is so insane for returns I always have way to many stims and rad away which I convert to diluted versions and sell or hand out.
---
I found one "crossing the road" next to the station behind The Top of the World.. near the lake
---
Since you're on PS4 feel free to PM me and give me the gear you won't be using.
---
Good luck finding another game that suits you better, sorry it didn't work out!
---
Lol no problem. I really hate that the screen is cut off. How is that not fixed yet?! I spent at least 10 minutes fiddling with my tv settings and Playstation screen display area settings trying to fix it..... But nope! Its a game bug.
---
Remember the time when people would defend BGS saying hacking won't be any more of a problem for fo76 than any other online game? 
---
for how smooth this shit has been running for me, and the lack of crashes and overall jankiness at vendors, im cool with this.
---
Diluted Rad-X or Radshield won't suppress your mutations. Only Rad-X will.
---
Oh, I see. I thought you meant the set had Assassin+Sentinel and then pieces with one random special.
---
No idea.
---
Dollysods Campground is my favorite spot for building a whole bunch of water purifiers lol
---
My fee is 0 caps. Just here to listen.
---
Be safe!
---
They would collect TSE weapons isn't Apalache.
---
I haven't either, but I'm that guy that goes "Ooo shiny" and then spends the next 3 hours looting some random buildings I chased it into. 
---
The vendor bots available caps are based on faction. Overall there are 1400 caps you can make every 20-24 hours. 
---
The mire is where the non cautious go to die.

T-51 Specific paint =(
---
I'm already on X01 PA
---
I claimed roughly 15 bounties yesterday. Levels ranged from level 9 to 75. I don't care, you broke the law. Your caps, life, and junk is forfeit.
---
Yeah, recently I‚Äôve actually been shot at when I try and give away items. I guess people have heard too many stories of shitheads who mime generosity as bait to kill you, steal your stuff, or learn the location of your base, in order to maliciously level it, etc.  Ironically, such players are representative of the most probably reality of a post-apoc experience, but that doesn‚Äôt make me feel any better about them. Oh well.
---
Isn't that a Minigun or am I thinking of a different spot?
---
It's weird this wasn't a thing already. Like why go through the trouble of making different color paint cans in the game world if you can't use them? :(
---
I get hard for data like this. I spent a full hour doing the math to explain how much energy it would take to convert sea water into clouds, after someone tried to use a picture of a ship with steam coming off of it to say it was a government boat used to cause the flooding on the east coast. 
---
Man I knew I had to save them for BOS at some stage, had about 20 by the time I got the quest and they got merged into one. 
---
You don‚Äôt learn mods from scrapping power armor.
---
I run with gatling guns. Id live to use the vampire plasma gatling gun, but its so damn fragile. 
---
Oh ya, I have found that enclosing it with actual walls/roofs make it worse.
---
Instead I just put a two concrete foundation on the side of my garage, placed the Fusion Generator on it, then on the three sides not against the building I put the wood barrier defense.  I have never had them spawn inside and attach the generator anymore.
---
If it has only been a few like 2-5 people I‚Äôd call it viable. Anything over ten def duper‚Äôs.
---
No worries, I'm on my phone at school so my replies are a bit rushed between classes. 
---
Moderate chuckle. :)
---
I have been trying to get the paddle from Camden just for the humour value of using it in pacifist mode, I'm around lvl 125 and once I have it I'm gonna "hunt" the highest lvl player I can find on the server, wish there was a laugh emote.
---
Personally I like the reasoning they came up with for the BoS to be in WV. It makes sense that military personal would try to contact any other branch they could to see what was going on. and given maxson's going AWOL and being considered a traitor it makes even more sense that he would try to pull people to his side after a governmental collapse.
---
That was awesome, you defiantly have skills
---
Is that a new thing since the update then? Because I‚Äôve reset my Xbox and now it actually says that it supresses mutations. I‚Äôm like 90% sure it didn‚Äôt say that before
---
When you craft weapons and armor, you will get to pick what level to craft at, usually in 10 level increments. At level 23 you should be able to craft level 20 weapons and armor, although some items go 15, 25, 35, etc.
---
Extremely simplified version:
---
Player does a dupe glitch at 2:00PM. Gets disconnected at 2:01PM.
---
Server says "Something @#$! weird happened at 2:00PM. I can't trust what happened after that."
---
Between 2:00PM and 2:01PM the player dropped all their stuff.
---
At 2:02PM the user logged back into the server with all of the actions from 2:01PM rolled back, so they simultaneously dropped all their stuff and did not drop all their stuff. Duplicates.
---
I got like 4 tech data and I don‚Äôt know what the hell it does. I was about to drop it but I saw someone buying them on the fallout market so I kept them. 
---
Add me on psn malduke i have one i can give you, at work now but ill be on later

It's because they were gonna sell that stuff in the baton store lol
---
There is a workbench inside, isn't there? Are you sure they were not trying to scrap junk?
---
Beets, bears, Battlestar Galactica.
---
Yeah, like, things that have literally no sense of being even close to amounts like that. 
---
That would be a grand slam of epic proportions.
---
*Game called on account of a Deathbat impaled into the scoreboard*
---
"she asked for it" 
---
It builds character
---
Nope. Chances of actually looting the exact same 2 or 3 star weapon twice:
---
1. Find a 2 or 3 star Legendary monster.
---
2. Have it actually drop a 2 or 3 star item, not a 1 star (seems heavily weighted to 1 star).
---
3. Get the exact base item and level. There are a lot of base items; every weapon, every armor and every variant of every armor (normal/sturdy/heavy).
---
4. Roll the same prefix and suffix(es).
---
This gets up voted, my similar but ranty post gets down voted. Guess it's in how you say it! 
---
&gt; Because you have 100,000 lbs of junk. Start using it. If you did use it, you wouldnt have so much. 
---
I use it as I need it.
---
&gt; If you play so much that you have so much junk stockpiled (whatever it is), you will also acquire more of this same junk as you're using it...making have such a ridiculous stockpile completely unnecessary.
---
Sure, I currently obtain it faster than I use it, but that might not always be the case. For example, we don't know what the junk obtain rate might be like from Vaults and they may become the most efficient thing to do.
---
&gt; I hope you dont keep so much junk for "future use" in real life. That's a real problem.
---
I save money in real life, yes. I would be against a limit in the real life adventure game on how much I can save too.
---
&gt; Either way.. you do you. 
---
This is the crux of it, it's my stuff, I already have it and it's why I continue to play.
---
I'm happy for people to play however makes them happy as long as their happiness doesn't hurt other people, it's the people like yourself who seek to tell me how I should play which is the issue.
---
You do you, I'll do me.
---
I would reduce intelligence and put glow sites instead of pick locks 
---
I think that may be more accurate... when things go completely cockeyed in the game (a few times a day) my wife and I tend to just have a bemused chuckle and mutter "oh, Bethesda...".
---
Sorry one more question. Is it better to use unyielding or the other perk that gives +35 damage resistance at low health? Since str has a damage max which you would already hit with 15 str and radicool etc, would the damage resistance be more effective for survivability?
---
I use to do it but accidentally finished the quest so roses syringe rifle got taken from me. I can confirm it works though
---
Tormented is only good on weapons with a high rate of fire, like automatics. Otherwise, limb crippling happens so infrequent that the points are better spent elsewhere.
---
dropped about 600 2mm cartridges and my buddy dropped about 400 5.56 bullets last night and barely got her to heal because a bunch of idiots were hiding in the shack
---
Butcher Pete wins
---
This sounds.......interesting 
---
Awesome! I'm eve deified. I'll drop a couple follows in a bit. 
---
In addition to what has been said about crafting, you need to pick a playstyle and pick perk cards for that style. If you want to use semi-auto rifles, get rifleman perks; automatics get commando perks; melee weapons have perks in strength that increase damage. Best to focus on one style though.
---
There are always skaters trying to profit on others hard work.
---
Sorry if you wasted a perfectly good nuke.
---
Right! I noticed this,  forgot speed demon sped this up.
---
Every one who says they should ban based on item amounts doesn't realise the owner of those items may bot have been the person who duped them 
---
Ah! Thanks!
---
I off loaded some to that vendor yesterday (PC) so you might be talking about me!!
---
Why? I play 100% lone wanderer, I do not PVP and I run pacifist, I can't scrap it because it was legendary, and I don't interact with other people for trading (I'm too lazy to make a post in fo76 bazaar), there really is no way to advertise in game,  I don't have any in game friends, and lastly I'm a power armor HW build that relies on stabilized.
---
There are no BoS in Appalachia. They died fighting the scorched.
---
Before the patch it was bugged. Works correctly now.
---
I didnt get a collar until after Falsley Accused started (got it from the very prison you're asked to go to)
---
I just wandered around northeast of Vault 76 and randomly got it. Though it didnt trigger till i was around level 55, so it's definitely random.
---
He's talking about to players not robots 
---
20-30 of each bobblehead is way too low - I had that many legitimately at one point just because I never used them (since sold 'em all for stash space).
---
Not a popular post but I'll say it seems the servers have been much stabler lately.  I mean sure I get disconnected still but it seems less frequently.  
---
 Is it better to use unyielding or the other perk that gives +35 damage resistance at low health? Since str has a damage max which you would already hit with 15 str and radicool etc, would the damage resistance be more effective for survivability than unyielding?
---
Report them to Bethesda in a support ticket. I'm sure they'd appreciate screen shots and video.
---
I already stated part of the unique ID of the item is tied to the person who originally owned it.  
---
See, I thought that just frenzied them.  I'll give it a shot!
---
 I've got a level 50 two shot gauss rifle, non-explosive, and they just seem like crap compared to Fallout 4.
---
I think the damage on this one is rated at 209 with the first star of each of The Rifleman cards but unless you get a sneak hit it really doesn't seem to be that great. Also doesn't seem to be terribly accurate, especially in Vats charged.
---
I'm on XBone, but maybe the dude had the same mentality as you. 
---
More likely selling legendaries from nuke site. More often than not you can find legendary weapons and armor at the train station.
---
Thanks! I'm down to like 12 waters and the power plants only let you use the smaller ones without a water source so maybe I'll check it out to do some water farming.
---
Saw your post yesterday, thought it was fucking great! I love how the community is becoming more involved in helping eachother
---
Your "fun" ruins other people's game play and their fun
---
'modding' when it comes to online games is just a PC way of saying cheating, some advantages over other players are smaller than others, but its still terraforming the playing field all the same, I remember modding eotechs into day of defeat, just a skin nobody else could see but it gave a huge advantage over having to use iron sights like the rest of the playerbase was stuck with, or the bright colored skins in other games so opponents stand out like a sore thumb, or multi colored so you can see the various hitboxes
---
getting items from dev room that aren't supposed to be released yet, that's cheating, someone sat there and researched the shit to be able to do it, it was premediated, no accident or faulty development on bethesdas end
---
they should be banned
---
The slap damage thing doesn't apply to your camp.  If some asshole starts wrecking your camp, will you just stand there and watch? Of course not. You are going to open fire. And when you, you end up vaporized in one second. 
---
Kudos to whichever artist posed all the stuffed animals around the wasteland.  Many excellent and photogenic.
---
Radium rifle is basically a combat rifle with slightly worse ballistic damage, but additional radiation damage, which deals a percentage of enemy health.
---
If you downloaded it via the bethesda launcher, you're all set. The day 1 update happened when the game was released a month (or more?) ago.
---
Most cloud stuff has a devtest and post dev preproduction environment 
---
I like to think of it as IV&amp;V. But hosting additional  instances cost additional money. 
---
That‚Äôs tough sell for something you buy once and use a lot of.
---
As said. You got the Technical Data drop of but also there's a daily called Surface To Air *(I think)*. There'a also another one I can't remember the name of, starts near Watoga.  
---
They're always worth doing, high chance or almost always a random PA Plan.
---
I have blue screened more in Fallout 76 than ALL other games combined.
---
I remember finding this exact spot months ago. I thought for sure no one else would find it as it's so obscure.
---
Alright, well let me explain. Essentially all duping boils down to trading over an item and then disconnecting from the server so that on your return you roll back to where the item was still in your inventory but the person who you traded with also has the item you traded. 
---
I wait no more than 1 second before that bag is mine!
---
And I expect the same if I kill myself with my TSE
---
Good old Graham doing Graham things.
---
Wish we could find lore as to who he was prior to being mutated.
---
Well if it makes any difference, my deathclaw turned into a level 21 after I tamed it.
---
Happened once to me too, wrecked my PA bad as well but to be honest I move on pretty easily in FO76, as soon as it was obvious the guy was not only doing insane amounts of damage to me and my armor but also was not receiving any damage whatsoever from my TSE shotgun, I simply hopped server and moved on, no point in making this last any longer :D
---
sorry to hear you are on PS4 i would have loved to stop by and check it out in person. Its a very creative, well thought out design. That being said i see no reason to insult us Big box builders, Sir! =P (/JK)
---
I am a bit stuck in my box for the main reason that i like it so much. Perhaps, as you said, because of the ease of use interior.  Perhaps because i hit my budget before i finished my Perimeter Tower fencing. Each level adds a bit more and its almost come full circle. (Currently Level 128). One thing i will say in favor of a big box build is that when it comes to hosting parties, having your entire team in the house, big space is better. Easier for multiple people to run around without clipping problems. Having multiple beds, instruments and cooking Stoves helps a lot. 
---
I did have my Rad scrubber griefed once by a trio of fools; who were then promptly introduced to my Insta Kill Hammer. It was almost worth the Flux repair costs to Hulk smash them. To that end i have been looking at ways to add trap floor, or other defenses against players.  
---
Anyway this is great build, can you walk through those Painting over the faux door?
---
Okay I thought I was the only one. I've got a two shot non-explosive Goss rifle that I've been experimenting with here and there but it really seems to be kind of terrible.
---
Twin Lakes
---
updates tend to override files (unless they are adding new content.) The last update for FO76 on pc was on jan. 10.  I would imagine that anyone downloading the game after that would already be up to date.
---
okay, but as I read the patch amounts to additional 59 gb, so should my version not be missing something?
---
Its funny how dupers are scum yet people dropping all their stuff to put on a mule charachter is far more common and just as damaging to the server and those people are totally cool.
---
Could you export &amp; DL the files ?
---
I'm on a PS4 Pro, and the game was nigh unplayable for me last night. Wandering around Watoga, I blue-screen crashed 3 times in the course of about 20 minutes. Thinking it might be related to the area and the protectrons, I started roaming the Mire a bit. I played for about another hour with one more blue-screen crash and had a 50-50 chance of being disconnected from the server every time I arrived somewhere via Fast Travel.
---
I'll give things another shot tonight playing on a low-level alt, but if it continues like this, I'm out until the next stability patch.
---
The day 1 update was so big because stuff had to be repackaged from what I remember. 
---
It makes sense if you know how duping takes place. 
---
It‚Äôs your console. Not to brag but I have the One X and the game runs basically smooth as butter, and I would imagine playing on a one s wouldn‚Äôt be bad either.
---
A wise assumption indeed
---
Store all materials in stash and try again.
---
That's the funny part!
---
Trouble is players are more creative than the devs. Players are breaking the game in ways they never saw coming. Also did anything reported in beta actually get patched ? The new dupe method was reported in beta. Yet not fixed.
---
astro turf from the atomic shop
---
I'll likely be doing another craft-instead-of-repair tonight, and will doubt check.  But I never have Ballistic Fibers because I have not progressed very far outside of the Forest and don't find Ammo Bags / Military Grade tape.
---
I did one repair of two level 30 leather items and it consumed the 8 total fibers I had last week.  Ever since then I instead just scrap-replace, and I did last night after me and my teammates went thru hell at the Pleasent Valley Ski resort with two waves of level 40+ glowing molemen, trying to help one guy get his Mistress quest steps done.
---
(I did it already but when I went there it was level 50-65 Scorched.  Which are SOOO  much easier than two waves of 2-3 dozen glowing molemen).
---
But not if you also know how saves work.
---
I like it. Maybe it's frustrating for others, but it adds a layer to the game of "direct engagement \_not\_ gunna work here". :shrug
---
How come this message doesnt show on the english Fallout?
---
Bethesda has it so that most updates are replacing files. You downloaded the most recent versions of said files.
---
God I miss those days... please blizzard give us a remaster so I can play my foth pally again and one shot everyone 
---
I can‚Äôt even share perk cards. It stops sharing after about 3 seconds. 
---
+karma
---
It replaced a lot of stuff, but it didn't add 59 more gb.
---
Make sure there isn't a high level player in the area.  If the high level player entered that area before you, the enemies scale to their level.  Server hop and get a new server without a high level in that area.
---
Also if you're low on stims and ammo, drop back down to a lower region and farm some (forest, etc).  When I was between 20-40 I'd frequently go back to the forest to get more stims and ammo off easier enemies.
---
Nice !
---
I don't know how much baggage Creation Engine is carrying since it birth, but devroom might have too much references in code or sth. After all, previous games had room for dead NPCs. I think that if they can't remove devroom, they should at least clear it when deploying servers.
---
Loolllll to Tru tho my main is an energy weapons build and uh... Surviving is hard.
---
yeah...I'll give you that.  But they can use that to at least look at a account and then see what else is up.  Honestly if they fixed the bug/exploit in stacking bobbleheads then it wouldn't matter for those anyway.
---
Personally they should just go after the TSE's.  Combined with the bug they are skewing the game against legitimate players and allowing "slap damage" to one shot people.
---
Dogs do too but are more tricky and secretive with their intentions. 
---
I‚Äôve launched tons of nukes and have now killed 3 queens. Nothing. I have found three 3-star legendary weapons which were pretty much three useless things stacked.
---
Sad part is, I've actually been thinking the exact same thing...big bummer cause I love the FO universe.
---
I just downloaded a mod to make perk card presets
---
I used to sit on my Destiny 2 app looking at my loadouts, perk tree and all that. Would LOVE to be able to access the fo76 photo gallery on my phone :) Checking my loadouts and stuff would be cool too. 
---
YES! Last night me and some random guy killed one of the Wakanda Government Robots in Wakanda(lel) and booked to grab the loot, got a Two Shot Radio Rifle I can't even use yet(level 50), while we both were looting the scraps the robot blows away, leaving the poor guy on his knees, but I was there to help him with a Stimpack, he was surprised I survived the explosion, I'm a tank man.
---
The Darling Sisters Lab northwest of Vault 76 spawns like 4 of the Halucigen gas canisters (unruptured of coarse)
---
Hope that helps. 
---
I couldn't disagree more, I love my TSE Handmade.  I have it setup with Short Scope, Hardened Receiver and all of the Recoil compensating mods.  Love it and have zero issues taking out multiple opponents rapidly with minimal misses.  Good example would be Westek Headquarters.  Tons of Super Mutants, engaged from 100-200 yards.  Can clear them all in about 10-15 seconds.  
---
FO76
---
Should be 1 in each of the little shacks. 
---
Rather have them keep cooler stuff for dlc/expansions and have this silly stuff in the atomic shop. Maybe some cool stuff though like new vegas ranger gear
---
That spot is the best for loading screen pics!
---
I had the same problem. Finding them in the open world is all that worked for me. I still need 10 more for the achievement. 
---
Same! I also love the idea of adding the photo gallery too. I also use the Destiny 2 app and it feels so smooth
---
I have to do this constantly and it‚Äôs so annoying they should up the limit so you have at least 10 standard on each perk slot and then you can use around 40 points from there to add on to the standard 10 points, it would make the game much more appealing and less annoying to tedious; especially for new players. Due to tediousness of this system  I‚Äôve found my self even going back to fo4 or New Vegas when I want I less tedious, relaxing fallout game to play where I don‚Äôt have to concern myself on broken systems like perk slots points.
---
It was that article about the guy who became an EndBoss and a meme with Lucy‚Äôs Shack but it had Peanutized Doc Brown and Marty McFly instead of Charlie and Lucy.
---
Th idea aligned with me advocating for mental health and disability so I decided to bring my passion into my gaming life. I really want to do this 24/7 so I decided to make my down time also dedicated to helping people.
---
My intentions are not all purely altruistic though. I am having some sibling rivalry with my brother as to who can save the world more. I can only see one bad outcome to this rivalry and that is him being the one to help fewer people than I will.
---
I really like it, i would love to model my C.A.M.P after yours
---
1000 hours? Does this person know what sunlight feels like 
---
Fuck i was expecting something more self incriminating. This can actually happen to legit players by accident.
---
There aren't any BoS in Apalache. They're all in Appalachia.
---
I just wanna play Monopoly where nobody takes my money :(
---
Using bugs or exploits to gain advantage over fellow player should always be cause for immediately perma-banning. Especially considering the known flagrant abuse of such things recently in Fallout 76. At this point it should be Zero Tolerance. It's destroyed the game for many by causing a race of "who can exploit / hack / cheat more". Play the game according to ToS or GTFO. 
---
Nope it's always been that way
---
Nice job!  Great looking CAMP!  I love discovering people's CAMPs, one of the things I love about this game, of course, I prefer to explore them "live" but seeing them is also cool ;)
---
I‚Äôd buy this. Awesome work.
---
Late as hell reply, but have you found any decent locations that spawn legendary large monsters, IE: Deathclaws, Fogcrawlers, Sloths, Grafton Monster, ect.  
---
What I have noticed is that there is substantially more chance for handmade and lever actions off of those mob types and I would like a legendary one of either lol.

At the mid-20s?  That's pretty typical of Harper's Ferry and the eastern portion of the map.  I don't think I first went there until the 30s, and it was a very dangerous experience even then.
---
There are some areas of the game that, if you aren't a high level or prepared, you *will* get hurt.  But honestly, some of my favorite moments in the game came from pushing myself to go ahead and explore dangerous territory anyway.
---
Dropping stuff like this is an interesting idea but unsatisfying for me, as you never know whether some of these actually getting the stuff. Instead my group gets together a huge moth ball of plans and we fast traveled to whatever low-level folks we can find at the end of the night and give it directly to them. This way we know at least somebody's picked it all up. Granted, they may not need 17 copies of an ultra cite explosive vent...
---
If they really wanted you to stick with it you wouldn't be able to swap perk cards out whenever you want.
---
You need to stop doing loops while fast traveling, putting yourself through too many G's my friend.
---
Where did you get that outfit? Looks great
---
I'd agree but I think its also because Fallout has alot of smaller files it uses and the unpacking of those files can be tremendous if there are alot of them that need to be opened.  1.3G is the download - but as we've seen with alot of things and other posts people have put up that could translate to files several times larger which means it could easily be 10-15Gb of files in total once expanded.  Copying 1.3Gb of files even on a 5400RPM drive can be tedious but not as long as this took to do.  Expanding a 1.3GB file into thousands of larger files - that can take a while.
---
As mentioned - I've had PLENTY of other game updates far larger that never take this long to copy.  They are usually pretty quick.
---
Where do you turn in technical data? I have a bunch stores up I just dont know what to do with them
---
Robobrains do make a sound before explode, something like the Assaultron's laser bean charge.
---
I'm also a big fan of it - its been my primary melee weapon since I got it. 
---
Just now I had some fun at your expense, and you will never know what. It's fun to have fun with other people's expense.
---
I had a situation where I was scouting enemies in a town(may have been harpers ferry even) using my long range scope. When I was done, I switched weapons quickly to my melee, and the scope view kicked back in. Spent the next five minutes trying to get back to normal, but nothing worked. Ended up logging out to main menu and back in. 
---
So i went through the rickamaroo of finding all the keys just to find myself at dome 03 with the door already open and everything gone. 
---
So I server hopped, just to find the same thing three times in a row. 
---
On the fourth try, I found the dome wide open and the plans sitting there. 
---
So if anyone wants to avoid going through the long arduous task of getting keys, just go to Dome 3 and server hop.
---
That's the spirit!
---
It's in the dev room
---
Allright, thanks for all the plausible answers :D

Have just reached level 36, I‚Äôve set up camp in five different locations across the map. At first, I had the intention to set up a brand new camp in each region I was exploring, with its own unique layout and flavor, but I soon found myself wanting a definitive place to call home. I‚Äôve just recently built what I hope will be my permanent place of residence along Route 108 in the area where the Savage Divide, the Mire and the Cranberry Bog meet. It‚Äôs situation on the map more or less mirrors Vault 76, so between those two free travel points I can theoretically save the most caps while exploring the West Virginian Wasteland. Right now I‚Äôm working to set the place up as a welcome rest stop for travelers that come across it.
---
What in would suggest instead is the artillery. Takes way less space in the budget and if you put your camp in a tactical position it can help in some areas. Never really use the turrets except at the workshop things you take over.
---
You probably feel pretty good shooting someone from a position of virtual invulnerability. Maybe you need a lesson in how people can exploit the pvp mechanics to flag you and take your caps.
---
I've seen the blade and voice of set sold a few times at the Raider station that is near Sutton too. 
---
It's very good. The base damage alone is much higher than most other medium melee weapons, and the additional armor pen makes it even better.
---
TLDR; you can just equip the mask and afk on the statue (jump on the bench then by the tail region of the lion then walk to the head) you can occasionally get a ghoul or two up there so watch out after the first round you'll be in first place and not need to retrieve the mask and will get exp rewards for the next 2 rounds then the event ends, then server hop
---
too high level enemies? just world hop  
---
also a great chem farm cause ghoul drops (even had one drop 2 xcell)  
---
I thought this week's theme was a reference to the Childs Play Charity organization. 
---
What‚Äôs that 
---
As a rifle dude it's my melee option. It does good damage without perks and is light. I have Vampires machete I made 4\* and it's still better damage.
---
I'll have the irrigation suite please 
---
I can only run so many White springs and Queens before I go hunting for more content.
---
Another thing Bethesda should add, FREAKING CAPES.
---
i hear theres a mod on console that allows you to create decks you can easily switch between. idk why we havent gotten a similar feature on console yet
---
I can't understand how the vendor can be instanced to each player but only one at a time can use him, If we each see a different inventory(I know this to be true) and the caps are also per player there's no reason all players present shouldn't be able to trade. The only thing that you do that another player may see is the items you sell, but even that is oddly random, my friend sold some gear, I looked for it and it wasn't in the vendor but our other friend saw it there after me so I went back in and nothing.
---
TSE in PvP ain't all that anymore. Everyone is building to counter TSE now.
---
I do prefer my ‚Äúinstigating‚Äù sledge over any firearm when that sucker lands.  Makes quick work of a level 50.  What is the damage on your sword?
---
That wasn't my experience on Xbox. If anything, it was worse. Three times I got locked in a loading screen and had to quit the game. When I joined back, there was still 10-20 seconds where I was frozen and my camp populated the world.
---
I wonder if it only counts for each unique toy, or if you get multiple bonuses for multiple rocket ships.
---
See the first picture!
---
Bethesda hear our cry! 
---
Think Mad Max
---
Hell, think other fallout games. Give us seriousness! I want to look like the raider I‚Äôm trying to be. Let me have spikes with skulls on them for arm pads on my power armor. Let me frighten the low level characters as I shake the ground as I walk by in a cloud oh dark smoke.
---
Make me frightening and I will give you all my money.
---
I recommend going to watoga station and dropping them in a suitcase that's a common place to drop of goodies or take the batteries included perk to reduce their weight by up to 90%
---
Get outta here cop
---
I hope all the dupers are banned so you can stop using them as a scapegoat and start looking to the real problem, a broken buggy game.
---
I haven't duped and this problem with bobbleheads would exist regardless of the duping exploits. 
---
But keep telling yourself that the players are the problem, that will definitely fix the game lol
---
That is interesting I‚Äôve never had this problem 
---
* Vendor Bot Phoenix is BOS and Wallace is at Harpers Ferry
---
I love how the mods are removing posts because it helps players get their money back. Thanks for enforcing the opinion that this sub is as bad as the game itself. Going to go get a refund now. Thanks.
---
I'd give anything for TSE Flare Gun or Bloodied Swing Speed Drill
---
Shhhhh that one doesn‚Äôt need to be fixed 
---
On the cheap white Xbox
---
I'm sorry for your loss *hug* 
---
What sword
---
Had to do that a few times.  Had a team mate run through a few thousand rounds and needed more ammo.  Also had to trade weapons once.  Had so many people at the SB that the lag meant it took over a minute to just do a simple trade.  There were some low levels kinda hiding in there, but we still managed to take her down.
---
What is sunlight? Oh boy that‚Äôs a problem
---
Weird huh?
---
Lmao 
---
I don't take paper bags that weren't dropped just for me, but 20 minutes later?  Yeah, I see no problem with that.  Generally, people will either go and get their bags immediately or they won't.
---
The map itself isn't necessarily a reliable indicator, because people are hidden on the map when they sneak.  It's possible a low-leveled played might be doing that to reach their bag in the Cranberry Bog, but again, 20 minutes is 20 minutes.
---
I actually build bases for people and really enjoy it they select the location and then drop materials and I go nuts building 
---
built a automated door that opens as people walk toward it and my friend freaked out as he kept running back and forth through the door 
---
I really wanted the toy set for my raider PA, I'll just walk around looking like rust and duct tape then and keep my atoms.
---
I found 6 nodes
---
Which is why I don't accept random team invites.  It makes your camp vulnerable
---
Even just a gift box emote
---
No need to apologise, although considering what you've said, an option to disable invites (for that session, like Blocks are) would be a useful addition.
---
"We are adding a 'This is for you' emote.
---
^for 5000 atoms^." - Bethesda
---
Nope
---
Iis that the marine helmet that looks like snake eyes from gi joe? 
---
So that's why it was telling me I didn't have enough space for a 3GB update. I had more than 75GB free!
---
The idea is neat
---
The execution is less neat
---
If we could swap out to different builds, like some mods have created the ability to do, that would be more ideal, especially since the perk card UI is a pain in the fucking ass to navigate.
---
Is the new Fire Proof 45% damage reduction enough?
---
/u/BethesdaGameStudios_ This is what we want and I would pay real money for this. BOS, Enclave, Raider PA &amp; weapon paints/shaders is what I desire everytime I visit the Atom Shop. Please make this happen.
---
Ohhhhh I know now that thing hanging from the middle of the ceiling that you can turn off and on 
---
Also happened to me at the SBQ. They jumped in front of me, so i shot them with my TSE handmade. Died, they also took my stuff. i have also been gang raped by teams in the SBQ event. Kinda my own fault there though, forgetting to put passive on.
---
I wish we could trade in ones we don‚Äôt use for atoms or other cards
---
Had three blue screen of death today, one while fighting SBQ. Then of course server was full and I waisted half a days worth of ammo and supplies. To top it off, when I got into another server. My character was surrounded by what might have been every creature in the Bog. While the nearby fissure site keeps shitting out SBs. 
---
Fucking still love this game though. PS4
---
How is this witch hunting?
---
I agree with Beth that the XP on those guys was way out of wack. (Yes, it was fun and helpful, but pretty game breaking. Especially since it helps high level players level even faster, and is hard for a low level char to do alone.)
---
I think a better idea for people with multiple chars, like us, would be that once you have a main character above a certain level (50, 100, 150 or something) that you can create an alt character with either an XP boost, or a automatic level up to 50. That way the XP at Whitesprings is more in line with the rest of the game, and people like us aren't forced into a tedious grind to explore multiple char builds.
---
Yeah, I'm not advocating that people break the game, just observing that the only thing that seems to trigger a swift reaction from Bethesda is somebody threatening their current or future loot.  Like if there were a way for my glitched Atom Girl costume to harm their revenues I bet it would be fixed in 24 hours.  Instead it is still broken after a month and a half
---
My friend plays on a X on a 4k and his does the exact same thing. You notice no change at all in framerate when you fire a mingun?
---
We‚Äôll go with that lol
---
Exactly, for games to update on the PS4 there needs to be enough hard drive space for the entire game file to copy itself 
---
we really need tiers of defenses like light machine gun turrets come 1-4 and all cost the same budget wise but not resource wise and have a lvl restriction (plus normal restrictions) this would let us upgrade bases
---
also I think we need a standard wall over haul as well like lvl 1 walls look ratty and made with things you found on ground then lvl 2 looks like a normal wall and lvl 3 is a reinforced version of the wall
---
this would give us the ability to use more material types later in the game as well for more themed towns that don't get nuked as easily by that one angry scorch beast stalking me
---
Ouch yeah that sucks big time, i would of only expected a few caps. Probably just like moving your camp. Last night I moved my camp and it said 5caps and then took 127 caps to move my camp 2 feet away
---
So what happens to those who traded for BOS paint plans and were told they were obtainable from Technical Data turn-in from those trading it?
---
Also a laughing emote, and a sorry emote.
---
I have 4 rocket turrets on L shaped wings on the roof.
---
Hard to describe, but get the turrets off the roof and away from your base a bit.
---
The L shape is 1 x half floor and 1 x quarter floor.  My base is a basic 2 x 2 x 1 square.
---
That way my turrets can look down at the walls outside the base.  100% fixes all molerat and mongrel dog problems.  Can even deal with some single or double ranged enemies IF they don't start shooting from outside turret range.
---
Once I did that, I came back to a lot less rekt camps.
---
This happened to me with strange in numbers also.  When i unequiped and reequiped it went away for a short time but kept coming back.  I checked my mutations and saw that all of my mutations only has negative effects listed. 
---
Indeed lol
---
I actually use it to route the power to the garage door on top.

I'm really, REALLY digging Orange Colored Sky from Nat "King" Cole.
---
It might be my favorite ever.
---
Yeah, my first time across that bridge, the hermit crab was level 41 and fighting 2 level 28 radtoads and then a scorchbeast attacked. Sprinted to Harpers Ferry and have to fight off waves of level 40-68 super mutants (higher level player just south of town).
---
I haven‚Äôt fired a minigun yet but when I‚Äôm around friends using it or fighting an enemy that has it I see no frame drop
---
make it weigh 50 pounds
---
I walk up to cars hit them with a weapon till they are almost dead slide a mine under it then wait for the wanted player to get close remote detonate the charge then unload on him with my rifle
---
luckily I don't like pvp much so its really only when people who are wanted start messing with lower lvl people
---
One step at a time.
---
Bethesda needs to actually test their shit internally before pushing it to anything public.
---
I showed up quite underleveled to one and even then I still contributed.  I don't think I was doing much with my two shot lever action but it still felt good to help.
---
I agree - the Excavator Armor quest really brings these issues to the forefront.
---
Screws, in particular, end up being the weirdest bottleneck because you'd think the numerous cars and motorcycles would have literally hundreds of them.  I wish there was a way to machine them at a Tinkerer's Workbench out of Steel or something.
---
Apparently any toy will give you +5 up to a total of +50 max. So col ideas about lugging around a lot of toys to get a lot of rad resist, even in such a short limited time as quashed.
---
You need to do the Brotherhood Quest. Believe you get it from Abbie's Bunker in the Mire. 
---
But to answer your question you hand it in the Safety Deposit Box in the basement of a hut in Camp Venture.
---
I found an orange cat once. I think it was at a mine in the Ash Heap. I think his name was Murgle. He was friendly. I took some pics.
---
It capped for me at 50 RR/10 toys. The type didn't seem to matter so you can have multiples of the same item. FYI wooden blocks seem to be the lightest toy. 
---
Even if they can‚Äôt do much or any damage just running around getting attention of mobs and running in circles trying not to die is still at least somewhat helpful 
---
Hear Hear, this is ridiculous to see, I hated the rave paint in the Nuka World DLC and fell that bethesda is forgetting that a large portion of the players have been playing these games for a couple decades, meaning they aren't children. I hope they are collecting some atats on what gets bought, how soon after release and if it was earned in game or purchased atoms and then pays attention to the numbers to improve the items offered and the prices.
---
I highly recommend [https://nukesdragons.com/](https://nukesdragons.com/) for character building lets you come up with ideas you never would have came up with otherwise since you can see all the points and perks 
---
If it was just you and another dude vs the SBQ then you're not going to win, so why pump 3000 bullets into a lost cause in the first place? The other 4 in the shed wouldn't have helped you kill the SBQ unless they were bobblehead dupers. When someone triggers SBQ I see how many people are there before I decide to join and waste bullets and healing chems. You should've cut your losses before the 3000 .50 cals.
---
yes !!!
---
Amazing.   How does the budget allow for this?  I am so confused.
---
I think first I built the stairs, and then the fusion generator next to it. Only after that build the floor above the generator.
---
But it's really a tedious process sometimes to get things right with that build system.
---
Butcher Pete for sure. 
---
How do you have time to adventure to make a story and draw these?
---
If there was a built-in loadout switcher then it wouldn't be so bad.  I've been using a mod that does such a thing and it's much better that way, I promise.
---
I'd say about 90% of the time I have gone, she has died, with the only non-deaths being due to her bugging off the map edge or below the ground.

**Game crashing to home/freezing/powering OFF Xbox AFTER latest patch**
---
Yesterday after work, I was only able to play about 2.5 hours due to adulting. In that span, my Fallout 76:
---
\-crashed to home 8-9 times, completely quitting the game.
---
\-6 times, the game completely froze, and I had to manually force quit back to home.
---
\-1 time, the game froze while making a weird buzzing noise through the TV speakers, and it made my Xbox completely shut off!! **OFF**!!
---
**I was 100% in Whitesprings yesterday**, and I'm not  sure if location had anything to do with it. I wasn't able to even try  to leave the area due to crashing. I'm still going to play the crap out  of the game, but I might try to get out of the Whitesprings area to see  if that helps. 
---
Sometimes this would happen while just running/standing, a couple times while doing the initial load (I could see the environment but couldn't open the pip-boy or switch weapons.. then freeze/crash), a few time while in a PVE fight, etc. 
---
I scrapped mine. Sad face. Anyone wanna sell me one on ps4?
---
"Need for a build"? Are you saying you think the game REQUIRES you to build a CAMP? my friend is lvl 91 and still doesn't have a CAMP dude lol. You don't need to make one if you don't want, but trust me, you will want to.
---
This isn't FO4... What mods/content you install also affects other players. This is a living game. You can't incorporate game changing items for sale without damaging the player base. That's been made patently clear by EA.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm not saying that Bethesda should use the code written by modders
---
I am saying that. The code is already there, just plug it in. 
---
I need a minimum of 8 for Gunsmith 5 and Weapon Artisan 3 when crafting/repairing my guns, but otherwise I agree.
---
Yup, plus a few other things. You'd need Dense mods on your chest piece (Marin armor) and Adamantium Bones (endurance perk card) at lvl 3 gives you ZERO limb damage, which reduces flinch (flinch counts as movement with sentinel gear). But yeah, can do much if they're staking bobble heads/magazines/meds. 
---
yes I know that and is what I told the other 3 people who said this exact same thing (points to the post right next to this one)
---
lols ohh well it happens
---
Legendary drop.  If it is 1H, that is probably better than your vanilla 2H.
---
This happens nearly every time I work on building a camp and try to use any crafting station afterwards.
---
I get that occasionally. I think it is when the server is lagging. I haven't seen it since the patch though.
---
Most of us grind.   Stop being so pretentious and telling others how to play.
---
Argh, I agree, I have SO MUCH STEEL.
---
Why are you going gung ho building up workshops when you know your eventually going to get dc'd and lose everything? 
---
Spend the time and reasources on your own camp. And when you build up a workshop, only use items of your own that are plentiful/easy to get or you have a lot of. I can usually build 3/4 reasource extractors and large generators with out using my own materials. I quit building fusion generators and rely on larges because it burns less into my materials.
---
And if someone takes it or you dc its easy to change servers and start again and your only out a few materials and time, but you get 2 events exp and loot when you reclaim the workshop on the new server.
---
I need to check, but I'm fairly sure I've received one or more of the Brotherhood of Steel paints as a reward from Technical Data turn ins.
---
Absolutely incredible. I thought my bar was nice but what you did with those half walls is genius
---
How badly do you want the servers to crash?
---
I tried to be helpful last night, I was looking for a better camp location near the river on the far left side of the map. Just north of the hotdog place. Saw a Lv 7 guy all alone and getting swarmed. Decided to help and finished off a couple for him. 
---
Afterwards the guy pulls out an axe and tries to kill me. I proceeded to end him with a board (for posterity reasons). Thanks for the 7 caps and some junk I guess. 
---
I have all of the tapes and the mission never completed. I assumed that it was meant to be that way. I wonder if anyone here has that quest marked as completed.
---
I mean the presidential suite is easy to get into, the safe requires a little more. If you have ever been in there you will notice the safe on the wall cant be accessed, Bethesda has a habit of putting a little barrier in front of things they dont want you to access, but not behind them. The safe is a level 3 that can only be looted once, as far as I know. I have been back there a few times and there is nothing else in it after its picked. I've looked at the science lab and it's just rubble, no room is there at all. Same with the other ruined room. 
---
Edit: can*t
---
I've been seeming level 50+ liberators the past few weeks. I think the highest I've seen was around 84
---
I vote for a fixed slap damage value of one hp. 
---
I put in elite sangerous the other day and was disappointed my screenshots weren't the loading screen
---
You could also have an out of usual location SB due to a workshop defend event.
---
Not recently... I used to get it all the time. I sorta figured it was do to the speed of my connection. (Mine sucked) I bought a new service plan And haven't gotten it since. It still could be the speed on their side if this is a new occurrence to you.
---
So i had another encounter today.
---
It was at Charleston Trainyard. I saw a Eyebot playing a flute this time and with 5 radrats behind him i have a screenshot but im currently not behind pc.
---
I hate floating structures too. I put a pole now on the lower platform next to the water purifiers so it looks somewhat statically reasonable...
---
Alas no, the memo budget was reallocated to fund atomic shop hat production
---
Basic colors should be free and attainable I'm game. The silly and over artsy stuff is meant for the atomic shop
---
Yeah, it's definitely higher than the base level of Super Mutants in the Forest.  I don't know if the Protectron's HP scales to compensate.  It's not a particularly difficult event, but is an extremely slow, tedious one.  Just like *everything* involving Protectrons.
---
Have notices the rad bonus likes to stick around even if you've scrapped the toys and put the parts away. True for anyone else?
---
i didnt have a jetpack so i took the elevator to the roof and jumped down, a marsupial jump got me in

Literally the only reason you should think they are garbage is if you have a bad build or use the wrong heavy weapons for anything other than a meme. It‚Äôs not gatekeeping or anything, you are just bad. I‚Äôll admit it though, they do need a very dedicated build to be good, but they are certainly not garbage. They are easily S tier up there with melee and rifle crit builds.
---
Lastly, your complaints about durability and ammo crafting tell me everything I need to know about your heavy weapons build. 
---
Weird. Is there a static spawn for plans?
---
Every one in their stash that disconnected would hate this... 
---
Can't work today, I don't have room for my responsibility card anymore cause I just got this great Attractiveness card
---
Welcome to fallout 76
---
Needs a you have been disconnected from the server message at 0:59
---
I will say that I found a workaround for this. Aside from losing the workshops, which BLOWS because of all the caps spent, if I get booted I go to my recent players (I‚Äôm on XB1) and hop back in. All my workshops are still operational, I just need to claim them again. 
---
Sibling rivalry!? Everyone's been there it's just a matter of time to see who wins
---
Yeah that has happened to me a few times. A fun little tidbit however, is it seems to follow whichever bench you tried first. I went from armor to weapon to cooking, to see what would happen because why not. It had a small heart attack and put me in the armor bench menu. Couldn‚Äôt do anything though lol
---
At least you got to the point of actually making all the motors. Some of us are stuck.
---
Nice job man, this is beautiful. I gotta ask one thing... in the picture of the bar, how in the hell did you get that metal support beam placed in the corner there? 
---
Same, Store all your Junk in Stash and it's corrected.
---
No I meant a "build" as in like the type of cards you use. I haven't played much so i definitely don't know what its called. But the cards you get when you level up. So I was told be sure to use the right ones. I do want to build a CAMP and Ive seen some really nice ones here to inspire me. I'm just curious about the other stuff. I think I will just hop in and explore and see what happens lol.. also ty all for the replies and help I appreciate it.
---
As much as I  agree I can't pass up a level 3 safe. Way back at level 45 I got the gauss rifle plans from the safe near the entrance to black water mine. I was so happy I ran straight to build that sucker. I've been dumping charges instead of shooting enemies ever since.
---
Woopsies is from SBQ fight. Not the queen herself but one of the scorched variant enemies. Can't remember which.
---
My cat's name :)
---
Those are the same paint cans from FO4. It would've been more work making all cans the same color
---
How do you make something 4*?
---
I keep thinking this would probably be the best approach - you still need to put points into the stats, so you're not just getting the benefits of the perks "for free", but it gets rid of the constant hassle of going in and switching the cards around before and after every little thing. Really, the only issue I'd see is when multiple cards have effects that could be active simultaneously, mainly just the food and drink perks, but...honestly? I wouldn't even be too bothered if this switch would let you 'cheat' a bit, having more of those cards active than is currently possible, because, frankly, the whole hunger and thirst thing gets very tedious very quickly.
---
they did

I played for about 6, and also experienced no issues. They really need to get to the bottom of it, and find out why so many users have different experiences.

Yeah I went th......wait a minute......

Same, I don't mind Add duty. As long as everyone is attempting to do something.

Idk. I can usually one shot people and I don‚Äôt use bobble heads. Just stacked riffle, explosive perk, tank killer, bloody mess, and explosive size. 
---
Then my TSE handmade or combat riffle melts people

Doesn't have to be digital I'll use mats for ea h separate picture if this was an option
---
I know a way that doesnt require wall breaching, just marsupial, on xbox one. I just happened to find it on accident so I dont want it to be patched, it might be known already. It's nothing complex
---
Who hurt you!?
---
They should be able to track how much of an item you had 1 day then had the next. 
---
If you go from 0 small arms bobble heads to 30 your account should he flagged and more closely monitored sure maybe you got 30 from trade or got lucky finds. But monitoring you won't effect you unless you are duping.

Same here. Pick on up and use it. I have no problems when a npc or player uses one. It's when I use it. My brothers xbox S does the exact same thing.
---
It's not just the hiding, it's how they refuse to do ANYTHING to help even if they can't fight her directly.  I run a pure melee build so I'm usually on trash detail when she's flying, but I discovered that when she lands I can use my +40% swing speed legendary grognak's (+Martial Artist) to basically keep her stunlocked on the ground if I spam attacks right into the front of her face.  She just lies there like a pancake and doesn't even move much for like 5 minutes at a time.  And still those folks refuse to even come out of the building and shoot her even though there is almost no risk. I've also seen them refuse to spend even a single stimpack to revive a guy who died right outside the doorway.  It is infuriating, they need to overhaul the entire quest/timer to make mooching impossible.
---
I find it pretty funny when I get called a hacker. Had some dude come hunt me down for my bounty the other day at the pond by 76. 
---
Got him and his buddy but the game during the course of our engagement had the health bars showing all grey on my screen like the old heal damage stuff from b4 a older patch. So I just keep hammering him figuring hes aggressively smashing the stim button like I am. I take him and his buddy down and dude comes back all "hurr durr I see you are hacking. Im gonna report you blah blah". I explain to him that 1, if he was seeing what I was seeing its the game lagging damage behind and I was smashing my stim button also. We begin round 2 of combat, it does it again but this time he overcomes. Starts saying all ha how do you like that hacker blah blah. Seriously IF I had some god mode hack on (does one even exist?) he wouldnt have been able to best me in combat. 
---
Its aight tho, I took his and his buddys junk from the first fight and went and hid it before he was able to return. He might have got the 50 caps or so but he lost more in junk and ammo. 
---
Reward from mistress of mysteries quest line
---
Along with those clean suits and pilot helmets that are missing from the game
---
What kind of updates/mods have you done to it? That's the only melee weapon I have but normally use a rifle (stealth build).
---
My observation they randomly spawn, rotating between things like cats, foxes, squirrels, rabbits, etc.
---
South West of Ft. McClintock but not past the train tracks there's a tree with honey/bees (the exact area gets tagged if you do the daily event for the tea place), I've seen chickens a few times.  But like I said it varies with what spawns there.
---
There's a lot of us high levels that do this! Never be worried about going and joining a high level imo. Most of the bad ones have already quit the game or been banned. So all that's left are those of us that enjoy the game and have a lot of time on our hands)
---
I feel like each Special should have a passive card/skill associated with it;
---
Like Perception @ 3 gets tier 1 lock pick, 6 points gets tier 2, 10  points gets tier 3, 15 points gets 'lockpicks don't break'. Strength could be strong back, Endurance *should* be blocker or lifegiver, Charisma no idea, Intelligence could be Hacker, Agility could be Action Boy/Girl or sneak, Luck could be More Crits/Bloody Mess/ Chance to revive?
---
Maybe don't carry so much shit that the game has to load.  Its why we have  a stash limit.  Hopefully they'll make it more stable, but for right now, don't make it hard on yourself.
---
How many lock pick (lvl 1) cards do we need?  so badly thought out LoL
---
That's completely untrue. I have several cards that are partially ranked and swap out as needed. For example, I have all 3 slugger perks and all 3 shotgun perks at rank 1 and rank 3 so that I can choose between full melee, full shotgun, or a mix of the two depending on the situation. 
---
Yes, it asks you if you want to rank up when you grab a duplicate, but you can just select "back" or "no" or whatever.
---
You can craft the sword again at a bench.  You can even craft a higher level of it.

So you can one shot a level 13 player with pacifist mode on and no "exploits" like bobblehead stacking?  If so even more reason to limit damage.
---
Hey! I got an Instigating Pitchfork from a three-star Super Mutant Overlord just last week... OKay, I see what you mean.
---
It would be extraordinarily nice to have some method of "crafting up" crappy legendaries. One possibility would be the "Grindr" mechanic from Borderlands. Dump in, say, six crappy one-star legendaries and get back one three star legendary. The "recipe" concept would ensure you got at least close to something you want: dump in all armor and get back armor, dump in all shotguns and get back a shotgun, etc.
---
Sorry - that veered off topic. Yes, mobs should absolutely drop legendaries commiserate with their difficulty!
---
Wait I found my mask in the world legally are you telling me they weren‚Äôt supposed to be in the game and now they removed it???
---
I appreciate the bounty hunters. I hated the few times I had a bounty. Hate to wait a week once to for someone to kill me.
---
Wouldn't be the first fallout game with the famous blue box lol
---
Well I've got some bad news for you Skippy, you are royally screwed.  Yep I'm talking no lube, no kiss, just screwed.    Why you might ask?  Because I've had this same shit for over a week now and NOTHING fixes it.  I mean nothing!  I'm sitting at 89% stored and nothing is stored.  That means I get 11% to build the absolute basics.
---
Here are things I've tried:
---
* Delete EVERYTHING, wait for 10 minutes, log all the way back out to desktop.  No luck! BTW I've left my game in the "empty" state for over 24 hours too and that didn't help.
---
* Dupe the base using the door trick to create 5 copies of the base.  All it does is push my base percentage out over 100%.  As soon as I delete the stuff from stored, I'm back to 89% stored.  No Luck!
---
* I've tried building one of every item I had built before to see if one was "holding" hidden objects like wires.  No luck!
---
* I've moved my base 15+ times trying to get it to sync or some shit.  No Luck!
---
Long story short, you are screwed.  Oh and for laughs, open a @#$@#$ Bethesda Ticket.  They will send you a canned response that indicates you don't know the basics on camp management and then when you add to the ticket, they will simply refer you back to their original crap message.
---
In case you aren't getting it yet, you are screwed.
---
Go away Todd

You may want to get rid of your duped helmet.

Are you sure that this is the way the queen works? Others have claimed from testing that the queen difficulty is based on the level of player that first approaches the fissure to spawn the queen. Personally I have not noticed the queen being tougher with more people around. It may just seem tougher when people are sitting around when they should be trying to help. 
---
Part of it from what I read is the higher level you are the less building things take up your budget. But you have to scrap what you‚Äôve built at lower levels in order to take advantage of that. Also, it‚Äôs only worth it once you‚Äôve hit level 50. The guy who posted about it scraps things and rebuilds every 50 levels. 
---
Aside from that, turrets and big lights take up massive amounts of the budget. 
---
Literally since the beta. 
---
Yep, I've experienced it. Yesterday, I was STUCK in a workbench with no menu.. just animation. I couldn't leave, craft, or pull up the start menu. I had to quit and log back in. 
---
I only played an hour or so last night and it was much better than previous play sessions
---
I mean, perk cards aren't that much different than the perk system in FO4, you can just change what you have equipped.
---
I feel like they don't explode if you one shot them. Maybe it's a fluke 
---
That was a waste of my time
---
This. When I try to craft immediately after working on my camp. Kind of fixes it if i walk away, then return.
---
Well, I could. But not with my riffle.
---
My two shot fatman is a different story :)

1000 is 41 days. This game has been out for two months.

Only this mask.

Na, I'm gonna keep buying my atom shop content.

Where the codes made up and the bugs don‚Äôt matter 
---
You need the sword to craft it to a higher level
---
Rumor is that you have to open your Xbox and physically climb inside to get into the dev room.  Put it in the microwave for 4 minutes to make it more malleable. 
---
I found a SB in the forest. Anyone else have a problem with that? A bit unbalanced? Yeah, I almost bit it.
---
Now that's Heavy metal!
---
Getting even 2 of the exact same item is a statistical anomaly. When you clear a dungeon and get the weapons to scrap, you may have 20 of the same gun but each will have widely varying metadata
---
Already done
---
You need the original sword to craft higher versions. I've tried before. I think. I haven't found any way to get another one. 
---
It exists in the files. They're probably holding off on it as an atom shop release 
---
Butcher pete with sheer strength, pig-foot pete with prep time

Between this and explosive weapon self-killing, the totem of FO76 players seems to be Wile E. Coyote.
---
Only the Fasnacht Man Mask is obtainable during the regular gameplay (and the Monster Mask, but you can't get it out of the High School unless you do some kind of a glitch) and it wasn't removed, I should've clarified this from the beginning.
---
Someone gave me the helmet after completing an event together. I wouldn't have known the helmet was from the dev room if I didn't read this post. What would happen to those who absolutely had no clue? 
---
Lol I'm pretty sure that its not just high levels downvoting.  A lot of people don't like the "Make it easier for ME ME ME," narrative.
---
Really great job with the architectural design, kudos to you. Definitely going to take some ideas from this for my cozy wooden bungalow, especially your solution for the bar. Also nice job tying your formal living room together with a more formal flooring, especially considering the lack of large, nice rugs in this game.
---
A few suggestions:
---
Go ahead and spring for the succulents in the Atoms shop. Your tables and cabinet tops would benefit from using some additional items, color and texture. Plus, you get like nine different plants so you have some variety to use.
---
A tried and true designers trick is to group decorative items in threes, with each item of varying height and shape. On one of your sideboards you have a vase in the center, then candles on the left end of the piece. I recommend getting the succulents and then [group your White Springs vase in a cluster on one end with the candles and one succulent. Then try and replicate this with varying items on different surfaces throughout your house. Also, items layered together](https://www.papernstitchblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/inside-midcentury-sideboard-drawers-open-3.jpg) add interest. 
---
When you get the plans, add  piece of luggage just visible under the bed. Ditto the blue cooler - would add some interest to the dining table. 
---
Finally, and this is just me, but I would probably eliminate all of the tall display cases that are sitting empty for lack of items to put in them. Or at least have only one. All the empty shelves just highlight how little CAMPers have to work with.
---
Again great job! One of the best houses I've seen so far!
---
Sacrificial blade for machete adds a star. With guns, adding the scorched killer receiver can add a star too
---
Just a heads up the plan is also named Handmade Gun. Not rifle.
---
Took me 3-4 hours and about 75 hops to get one pair. :(
---
Thought the old sword was part of the recipe to craft a new one
---
Or be like practically every other mmo ever made and allow a respeccing system that doesn't suck. I shouldn't have to level up 50 times to respec my character. Perk cards are just an annoying take on talent trees.
---
Honestly it sucks, but until servers are actually stable, sometimes the best thing to do is exit to the menu pretty soon after you get something good to "force save". Definitely should not be that way
---
There were others.
---
Can we just admit the Perk Card system isn't very functional?
---
It seems cool in theory, but the more you play, the more you become aware how dumb it is. The cards, by their definition are non permanent, encouraging players to be able to modify their build. I don't think Beth intended for players to be swapping out cards at every safe/terminal, but it's what we're forced to do.
---
The game isn't casual, so why make the Perk system casua? Bring back the Perk Tree like FO4, 3, anything prior.
---
can you hit the lake up there? 
---
I got a 2 Shot Lg42 as a drop while farming Nuked Whitesprings last night. I can't wait to use it and be mislabeled. 
---
Because the larger problem is that this game has a complete witch hunt going on and people are confusing Role Play with Mob Justice. They're inpatient due to BGS' lack of response.
---
Honestly if some kid wants a rare item as a one off then let him. What sucks is there are those openly trolling on both ends at this point. And both are ruining the game. The forerunners of this witch hunt are as toxic and bad as the dupers at this point. 
---
Yep. Sitting at around 4 crashes in about 30 minutes
---
You can use bakka. The centralized sever I get but no one has figured out how to do local saving yet. 
---
There is absolutely no reason to make non combat cards like this always passive...we switch them out when needed.  Why put a barrier up to use them...we all have or will have all the perks so it's not like we're creating a "hacker" build...everyone is a hacker.
---
lol.  Still gonna go with a set value.  :)
---
I liked the idea but the extra 5 carry weight from black diamond made it my melee weapon of choice
---
They're talking about an owl mask.
---
Exactly this, I don‚Äôt really give a shit about exploiters, I don‚Äôt take the game seriously at all it‚Äôs a hobby, good on you for warning people.
---
You can sell junk, but you have to bulk it first. 
---
Wow that sounds cool actually. I still just have a treehouse looking base for max mobility but I kinda wish I could settle down somewhere permanently. 
---
Does the grenade perk work on it?
---
I did not know. I look forward to them when they are released!
---
Considering you have to both damage each other to engage in PvP, I don't think it's really necessary. Most people will assume friendly until shot at.
---
It's the thumbs down emote, since it had no other use other than being a dick, and you actually point down with your thumb at the bag.
---
No one has any idea man
---
This is pointless. Newbies and others who are curious will always show up and realized they are out gunned and hide in the shed. I totally get the frustration of loosing a ton of ammo and getting nothing. Its happened to me a few times. It‚Äôs really up to Bethesda to make the event more fair
---
Cut these numbers by 3, since there is no crossplay.  (PC players will always hop to another PC server.)
---
Also, there is every reason to believe that servers are regional.  Certainly Europe is isolated from US, but is US East isolated from US West?
---
No one here knows how regional, so estimates will range.
---
Time of day will matter; 9am will presumably have fewer active players than 9pm, and therefore fewer servers will be active.
---
I imagine that one reason Beth didn't want to go through Steam is that they didn't want the public to have data on concurrent players.
---
Having a point in SPECIAL does something other than just giving you card slots.  The reason they cap it at 50 is so people don't have like 100 strength, etc.
---
Optimized servos is not for the Torso, it is a leg mod.
---
Or how about don't warn the cheaters and let them get locked out.  Except, you're probably one of them.  Nice name.

Well he had the head start last year he was far enough along in his therapy to be able to become an advocate for his cause, good cause, but very localized.

Mine is much broader and a global issue. I have always outdone him in anything I set my mind too. He hasn‚Äôt beaten me in a video game in ages. (Unless the controller was too small for my hands... looking at you GameCube...) 
---
Yes, probably one got it wrong and the rest copied the first
---
I did not know that. Thanks
---
You can't add mods to it but you can craft a higher level one by using the old one in the crafting.
---
Adding melee perks such as gladiator this weapon can deal a sizable amount of damage
---
&gt; So I was told be sure to use the right ones. 
---
It's not critical and only really important if you are trying to "min/max" your char. Don't listen to the idiots that say you MUST play some specific way. 
---
being belligerent is a fast way to not get a response or even any attention payed to your comment by the devs, they don't need players swearing at them. try and act like an adult.
---
Where the more you play the game feels flatter 
---
Oddly enough I think my real goat is my nuke mines. Love peppering people and waiting for them to follow me to my mines
---
Maybe but..
---
It‚Äôs still on Bethesda to improve their QA before releasing to prod.
---
We are customers and users for a product that we are licensed to use but not own.
---
If bethesda really wanted to crack down on duper‚Äôs they‚Äôd have used their tools to flag which accounts are sitting heavy or pushing server utilization. It gets flagged every time there is a spike.
---
The duping problem is still theirs. 
---
I have my CAMP setup for mobile deployment.  It's a basic 2x2x1 with 4 rocket turrets.
---
HOWEVER because of the "your base is floating" bug, I can't move it anywhere.
---
I hope they fix it soon.  No sense in having a mobile base you can't move without 100% rebuilding it :(
---
I've been called a hacker for my current build, it's all in the armor and I could switch to any other weapons but I prefer rifles and perception.
---
Easy way to solve it, cap ALL sources of slap damage to a percentage value and have whatever damage is dealt regen back. Like 0.5% max health per hit cap with a regen tick every second. Not even people with TSE Miniguns will be able to kill you.
---
Usually just a wave and/or thumbs up. I will then drop what I am giving away and shoot the bag to draw the other player‚Äôs attention to it. 
---
Agreed.  Crafting should transition you to that mode which has a preset configuration of cards.  Exiting crafting switches you back.  Plus, it would make the wait while your char prepares more bearable.
---
East of the Top of the world, there is a farm. Go to the farm. When you spawn, go all the way to the back, past its little pond. You'll reach the cliff edge. Look for the billboard below you. If you go the billboard you'll see a little camp. On the sleeping bag, a plan spawns. Around the camp are normally 6 or so kitties. 
---
I love the place because kitties. But I hate it because my mutations kill them. :(
---
Actually it is true...try this - try ranking your rank 1 perk to rank 2.  It will only let you rank the rank 2 perk to rank 3 first.
---
No you can‚Äôt. He means kids who have initiated combat.
---
Dude, im lvl 270 and i try giving away decent legendaries and stuff all the time........people get freaked out and shoot me then i have to kill them but sometimes its cool and they take the 3 star legendary thats no good for my build üòÇüòÇ
---
No one sent him the patch notes that whitesprongs was nerfed. 
---
Wait it's Pig foot pete? I always thought it was big foot pete... TIL
---
The wetsuit helmet is obtainable through normal play (the plan is found at various places around watoga). The assault marine helmet is not and looks more in-line with the other marine armor pieces.
---
First showing of Ghouls gone wild.
---
Honestly curious: How much time past between picking up the gift bag/s and when you get disconnected? Even though I've read that the game is only auto saved every 10 minutes, I find it shorter than that on PC, at least in terms of recognizing what items I have in my possession (seems like it anyways). I once picked up a new weapon but was killed a minute or so later, just to come back and still have that weapon on me. I was killed though, not disconnected.
---
You know where those dupers went wrong?
---
They targeted gamers.
---
Gamers.
---
We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.
---
We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.
---
We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.
---
Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.
---
Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?
---
These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.
---
Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.
---
It's working as intended, bobbleheads are not.  Why so much anti pvp?  You get a huge advantage being the defender.  My base was getting wrecked once, guy was wanted, started beating on me, I turned off pacifist and one shot him. Was fun.  Bobboleheads need fixing.  Nothing else.
---
Also certain items of junk do not need to be billed prior to selling. 
---
Oh, I'll have to find out then
---
Awesome mate, what perks have you gone for?
---
Actually. They allow you swap perk cards any time because it‚Äôs dumb to not allow people to customize their build.
---
It‚Äôs not meant to be changed as you are playing. If it were meant to, they would have made the UI different.
---
No, they cant. Dev items have are basically like a "control" variable in a science experiment. Static 1 spot drop, static 1 method spread, static 1 item code available to delete or detect across the board.
---
It almost seems like bait it's so traceable. 
---
TSE's are on every legendary enemy loot table. Theyre dropped thousands of different ways from different enemies, vendors, and dropped bags. Perhaps on a small scale an items drop durability could be taken into account as whoever got the drop had their luck play in. Unfortunately even with luck variation in the playerbase, tons of items have dropped to different players with the exact same numbers as somewhere else.
---
The original drop after duping would lever be able to be traced. Dupes and original are on a technical level the same. Perusing the game files with totally allowed programs, you can see every tag and table involved with items. Theres nothing tracing unique inventory. This might seem like an extreme oversight, but to be honest with how many individual items come in and out of our inventories as well as dynamically from the game world, recording ownership would be one hell of an endeavor I'd imagine. When one player can interact with thousands of items in a play session instead of a few assigned body loots like say an MMO, things get convoluted.
---
I usually wave, motion to come over and if they are newish, I'll fire off a few rounds with an unsilenced weapon at the bag on the ground to signal them to look. 
---
Occasionally, I figured it was server lag. 76 seems like a bandwidth hog, and whenever my husband is also playing online I get mad lag. 
---
take the materials you need out of your stash, for some reason certain materials in the stash are not being recognized by crafting tables. I have had feedback that this works on PC for sure.
---
Got a counter to the other Handmade?
---
Can you go back to the fabricator in the Manor and try to make a new one there...? Not sure if that's possible, but worth investigating. 
---
Add No Mans Sky and its the same for me.
---
Well.  People used to be able to get onto the GM Island in WoW with some effort.
---
I'm an old RUST player so I usually just jump up and down by habit.  Not sure if anyone really knows what I'm trying to say or if they just look at me and say "wtf is this guy on".

Would a TSE hunting rifle technically be the top damage rifle?

At wich location did you pick this awesome screenshot? 
---
I started out with just a deck and the basics on it. Moved it wherever I was currently exploring for the free travel. Finally decided to plant roots and build a better base in one spot. Built a base with water, crops and power, and found out I was on a spawn spot and had to kill stuff every time I came back, so moved my base to the next puddle down the hill after a few days. From there, I noticed I often had neighbors at the next puddle down, and when I went to look at one of their bases, I saw why. Better space, junk pile, and nicer view. I stayed where I was as I leveled up and unlocked items till I felt it was time to upgrade and moved to the new hole. It's a popular spot, and about every tenth log in, it's occupied, but since I'm solo, it's no big deal to respin a new server. 
---
As a big PvPer, honestly I vote that you can‚Äôt damage someone unless they accept the engagement. There‚Äôs really no point to it outside of killing someone AFK‚Äôd at a vendor - which is solved by a two minute vendor timeout. 
---
Definitely viable.. do you want to focus on VATs or no? I could share my build that I've been trying to tune towards PvP, but its more of a VATs rifle build. I'm sure you could build a viable setup without taking the VATs perks in Luck that I have though. 
---
It's the initiate one 100%. I have it too, and received it like 4 times already, this it the only legitimate one
---
Thank you for sharing this. You did a wonderful job capturing the essence of your adventure. Almost like picking up a holotape.
---
I still have mine, but I found it legitimately.
---
My girl likes FO4, but doesnt like online games. Doesnt help that she's seen my camp get attacked by dickheads as many times as she has.

---
I had no idea about Belgium or any US states with laws about lootboxes. Interesting! Yeah I remember seeing the data mine but I really don't think actual random lootboxes are coming. I could see 5 % exp boost or speed boost though. Or maybe lunchboxes will be out in the world. Cap stashes I only find maybe 1 a week. Maybe they'll be like that.
---
I put the game down a few weeks ago until they fixed things. Went for about 20 minutes last night until the blue screen. Welp, guess I'll put it down for another few weeks .
---
Yeah. I think it may have something to do with the proximity of the bwnch you are using to other items. Although I had it work out for me for the better while fighting a scorched queen and repairing my guns mid fight without a table.. Hahah. 
---
I'm not sure. I think it required quest items to build, so I don't think you can do it again afterward. 
---
Find different locations to hop to.  Sugar Grove and the secret room in Abandoned Bog Town have better springs.
---
What would make this even better is if there was a nuke that just touched.
---
Think about it, it‚Äôs like that scene in Titanic, the band played until they died, same with the survivor, doing something they love even though he‚Äôs staring death in the eye.

No one has any idea dude, also, [is this the helmet you are talking about?](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/1/13/Assault_marine_armor_helmet.png/revision/latest?cb=20160620180542) If you are talking about tactical helmet then there's nothing to worry

It's not "this person".... It's ma'am!!!

Gauss rifle would be but if you want the TRUE top damage rifle it would be the dragon. I can get mine to well over 4k damage

Sadly this happened to me last night, I dropped a nuke and only 8 people showed up. About 10 minutes into it and only a 1/4 of health gone I posted a LFG and more people joined. About 15 minutes into the fight it was at half and all the Sudden she shot up to full health and she only got down to 1/4 health before the timer ran out.
---
Players that take advantage of bugs aren't any better - you sound like you're stacking those bobbleheads and are afraid of getting banned because you have a bunch on your character.  Why else would you have a problem with this?  And if you bought bobbleheads, there's no way you can know if they were duped ones.
---
Yeah, murder due to vendor AFK does seem acceptable.  :-)
---
hahah. nice
---
They say Karma is a bitch. Especially Wasteland Karma.
---
That was my thought when reading this unfortunately. Fix the rest before trying to add something else that will break it, haha.
---
I'm on ps4, and a builder. I have nearly every item in camp, I can build what you want on your camp! I saw that you were using furniture as a placeholder until you get the items you want. 
---
Sure, please share your build mate :) I'm interested in a VATS focus as it seems like the best way to maximise damage.
---
That's a good point. The wikis also claim that there isn't any reward for completing the quest, so perhaps you're right.
---
I moved my camp frequently when I was low level and still exploring the map. Just had a fairly basic survival base supported by one foundation so it was easy to move in a pinch.
---
Now I‚Äôm level 70 and have a spot that I absolutely love and I‚Äôm very proud of it so I‚Äôll probably stay there for awhile. 
---
I'll still be spending my free atoms, but why would you ever buy them?  
---
They're FREE!
---
A weapons workbench - I run there when my gun breaks mid-fight.
---
Or I could just do what *I* want. 
---
No sir, it's you that is misleaded. If they didn't intend for us to change perks at will, they would not have allowed it at all. 
---
FO4 traumatized me of mannequins. Way too many times did I find synths trying to blend in with them then attacking me
---
For all of you that want lots of caps, quit going to the vendors already.  That is the slowest possible method.
---
**Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.  Sell legendaries, ammo, mats, plans, everything there.**
---
Never worry about caps again.  I haven't sold to an in-game vendor in about a week.  Never have to make the dreaded 7 vendor run and wonder what 500 pieces of whatever I need to sell to all of them.
---
I'm sitting at just about 21,000 caps right now, and I can't make a trade deal with this guy that just messaged me because I'd need room for another 8,000 caps.  Trying to find something to buy on the market.
---
That's captain nark to you!
---
6-8k in some cases with the right mutations and a team to abuse the team buffing mechanism. 
---
The BoS though don't just acquire tech weapons such as plasma etc.. 
---
They try to acquire any advanced tech from pre war from falling into less reputable hands. This would include nuke silos, robots and any fuel sources to advance their goals
---
Wow. Way to make me realize my CAMP is a shit shack...
---
He hacks
---
He whacks
---
He smacks 
---
But most importantly 
---
He chops that meat
---
Oh yeah, I've spent many hours on that site. It's just that my other two builds have been focused on melee / shotgun / or automatic rifles.
---
I've never seen either of these what do they do?
---
I‚Äôm surprised no one said the ‚Äúheart‚Äù emote. I always use that one to let people know I‚Äôm friendly.
---
I do it on me melee character because the bleed damage seems to bypass the damage scale. Not even worth the ammo on my guns character. But still overall it‚Äôs a stupid concept - either make everyone take full damage no matter what or make it a choice. No point to scaling damage, it‚Äôll literally just be abused when possible.
---
It just shows that Bethesda might be greedy but people are just as greedy selling stolen items for real money even selling weapons or caps for real money but people will blame Bethesda for being greedy and it's their fault the ingame weapons or stolen dev items are being sold for real money 
---
Try it with the eye of ra! Makes it have 100% armor pen
---
I get so hapy when people are on Add duty. Ive lost momentum before when running a melee berserker setup that required having low health, as well as having no power armor on and having a fuck ton of different chems, cooked food, and whiskey. It infuriated me to see level 10s and 20s doing nothing while I can do a shit ton of damage to the queen, but everything seemed to be aggro'd on me alone. 
---
crap i traded for a assualt helmet, and had no ideal it was from the dev room :( ... guess i will scrap it tonight
---
This happened with every game I've had since I've bought the console, with some games taking up to 1 hour to copy the files.
---
Try putting the mats you need into inventory and not in your stash, this is an issue on PC since the patch there as well and having the mats on you as opposed to in the stash seems to fix it. I have had positive feedback on this working.
---
100k dude... 100k.  An easy to agree on state of their inventory that can beyond a reasonable doubt be attributed to duping.  That's a start, right?
---
**Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.**  Both of those items go for about 3,000 caps.  People sell them frequently.
---
If you don't have that many caps, sell some stuff there.  Buy, sell, buy, sell.  Pretty soon you'll be swimming in caps and good gear.
---
Me too, don't even remember how many I've dumped
---
Grind out daily/weekly challenges to get Atoms if there's something you really want.  Yesterday was do things while wearing a hat, so slap that hat on and earn those CAMP upgrades.
---
It‚Äôs not even just inventory management. Half the time in the inventory is spent dealing with the shit UI Bethesda constantly reuses even though modders are able to fix it for every game they release. It‚Äôs just laziness stacked on top of more laziness on Bethesda‚Äôs part.
---
I started as a nomad just dropping workbenches and stash boxes when needed. Since level 30 or so I pick a spot and stay for a few weeks.
---
You'll get a plan from scraping it, which is another thing that's from a dev room. Just drop the thing man, not worth the risk
---
Don‚Äôt fucking warn the cheaters... 
---
At 0 karma for it lol
---
Well because I usually only run the workshop long enough to collect what water/resources I need then leave and let someone else take it over. When you have 15 purifiers it doesn't take long to get the water you want and you don't have to babysit your workshop all day collecting them.
---
So assuming I don't get DC'd right after building. I usually am set within 30 or so minutes which is a reasonable time not to expect a DC.
---
Spiral staircase is also a great idea!
---
Lol, it's like they aren't even trying. Give me ten minutes with the texture files and I could make better palette swaps that the crap they've been putting out. 
---
If this doesn't work try having all your materials on your person. I had this bug with a piece of armor and it was the only way to fix it.
---
I fucking love that bar, I did something similar on my CAMP for a security room with my fusion generator in it
---
Thanks for the replies!
---
Ultracite scrap goes for a decent amount 
---
At 0 Karma for it. lol
---
I would say it would be really hard.
---
With dodgy being an issue for you. Dodgy would make it so you‚Äôd have to shoot someone a few times before they take any real damage.
---
However, you have chameleon and weightless armor, you‚Äôd be pretty much invincible at long range
---
I'm running this:
---
S-1 (rank 1 blocker)
---
P- 15 (rank 3 rifleman, rank 3 expert rifleman, rank 3 master rifleman, rank 3 tank killer, rank 3 concentrated fire)
---
E- 2 (rank 2 Fireproof) planning to make rank 3
---
C-2 (rank 1 lone wanderer)
---
I-8 ( rank 5 demolition expert, rank 3 nerd rage)
---
A-14 ( rank 5 adrenaline, rank 3 covert operative, rank 3 gun fu, rank 3 dodgy)
---
L- 14 ( rank 3 bloody mess, rank 3 grim reaper sprint, rank 3 better criticals, rank 3 four leaf clover, rank 2 starched genes)
---
My build is low health, using a bloodied explosive Gauss as my main weapon, I use the mutations; adrenal reaction, speed demon, marsupial, and eagle eyes.
---
I'm never in power armor so I'm quick and stealthy, and can switch the stealth and escape artist in if I want to.
---
My armor set is mixed but my important effects are Sentinels and assassin's on all pieces. With dodgy you get 75% (sentinels) 40% (assassin's) and 30% (dodgy) damage reduction from other players. The explosive resistance in my armor and from fireproof makes weapons like TSE shotguns and such tickle me. As long as standing still I can vats with my rifle all day and take no damage for anything over or PvP, until out of ap from dodgy useage. I can even shoot things point blank with my explosive weapons and take zero splash damage, it's great!
---
It looks good, highly reminiscent of warframe in certain ways. 
---
I'm kind of surprised you lost it.  In my experience, the game tends to quietly autosave whenever you walk into a named location on the map.  In the future, instead of trying to place your CAMP, you might try walking to a nearby map marker instead.
---
I mean, they're a bug because... Moth. Don't mind me.
---
But the friendly Mothman is definitely supposed to exist. Afaik though it is only in connection with the "Path to Enlightenment" event.
---
I usually drop 1-2 turrets to keep out the mole rats, zombies, etc. when I'm not there. If I'm in my camp I kill whatever's there myself. Definitely not worth putting more than a few turrets. 
---
Obviously 40 identical TSE shotguns would be duping.  Let's avoid things like 40 bobbleheads that can be collected/traded for legitimately.  And suggesting that doesn't help the situation.
---
If carry weight was the issue it's to late for me to rectify that unless I can log back into my character. being a measly nine hundred and something pounds, I'm a little skeptical that is the only culprit considering I've heard/read reports of dupers with over a million carry weight and I, myself have carried over five thousand pounds with little to no effect on server stability let alone not allowing me to connect at all. Thank you for the comment, however. 
---
Dang, but of course dps factors In where the handmade shines. I was considering finding a TSE dragon for those opening stealth shots on high health enemies then switching to the handmade for clean up . Might be the way to go 
---
This is why, when i do play, i use the loadout mod on nexusmods
---
I was hoping for more of a "Let's go bathe in the blood of our enemies, and drink from their skulls" emote... but your idea works too
---
Ah I see. Ok thank you.. sorry I'm super new
---
I don‚Äôt. Who cares about the experience? This is like the fourth exp nerf. It has one purpose exclusively: To extend reaching end game because they‚Äôre losing players due to lack of content. 
---
The game is over at 50. Levels don‚Äôt matter, they don‚Äôt give you and edge whatsoever since you can build your dps perks more than enough by 50. After that it‚Äôs convenience and min/maxing. 
---
Its. Not. TSEs. It's the bobbleheads. I can shoot you all day with my TSE and likely get myself killed when you get close.
---
Whip out my increased attack speed 10% damage to player shiskebab, and the slap damage you're about to get is going to knock off 5 percent a slice.
---
Most ANY build can weasel it's way around slap damage totals. One gun type isnt to blame. They all can hurt. Its the multiplicative bobblehead glitch.
---
I say they just do a patch update involving carry weight, resulting unfortunately in any character with exponential weight like a mule would have would crash itself on login in an attempt to load. Maybe have it fail to load inventory like that Power Armor glitch did near release, made my character unusable till patched so I leveled an alt to 50. Only people that lose would be those with real stock meant to be sold or exploited. Legitimate mules walking slow like mine have quite a bit, a few thousand (why tf do I hoard 1 and two star garbage? When am I really going to outfit that fresh 50 alt in average items?), but it's not 50k.
---
The thing about set values is a lvl 5 with a mini gun (just and example don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs possible) would be able melt anybody screwing around in their menu without having a chance to react.  Don‚Äôt think this is the workaround. Also, the bobble head dmg 1 shot with pacifist is a dubious claim at best since there‚Äôs no actual evidence supporting this and in fact [here](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af6kei/_/edw2m98/?context=1)  is actual real evidence against it.
---
Put the map related stuff in a separate package and put the dev code that is able to access the room in a separate conditional block in the code.  When built as retain the code isn't compiled and the map package isn't included.
---
PSA: press the L2 or R2 buttons to jump down the sliding scale quicker.
---
Here's hoping the next step is to ban anyone with that obvious a cheat in their inventory
---
When do we get raider atomic shop items Todd?
---
I've gotten quite a bit of 1 ping legendary combat armors from turning them in
---
They didn‚Äôt, some dumb ass in YouTube made a clickbait tittle about so now everyone in the collective hive mind thinks it‚Äôs true 
---
For Tech Data, check out the room with all the desks in the enclave.  At least 7 tech data in the desks in that room alone last time I checked.
---
Nope. They said another update towards the end of this month. But idk if that means new content.  
---
Never but since Lunchboxes have been datamined (and although we don't know what's in them, it acts like a consumable with a fanfair when used or gifted), some people want to act like "Reeee these are lootboxes wtf Bethesda smh!!!!1!1!1!1!"
---
Walk right infront of the TSE douches, the simple joy of watching them kill themselves and having to walk back makes my day even if I dont get a decent legendary.
---
Sooner or later they get the point or get salty and leave, either way win win.
---
I like melee /w incissor at events vs guns. Less oopsies and exploding cars.
---
I place down a  bag and teabag by it
---
I know a guy with 4 level 100+ characters no XP glitch and barely touches whitesprings.
---
Your inventory doesnt create a log like youd think. Unless Bethesda took a snapshot, if they look at your inventory, they're not going to be able to see what it looked like 2 weeks ago. That MMO breadcrumb super structure just isnt a part of the framework.
---
yep will be dropping it them
---
That quest was spot on. Especially with how long it took and attention to detail. I enjoyed that troll.
---
The relationship is, 1 of a dev room item is obviously obtained illegitimately.  Where 100 identical TSE's in a single person's inventory is obviously obtained illegitimately.  The later of the two takes one more step in a query to discover.
---
Best advice I can give is to contact Bethesda Support on their website. 
---
Sadly I don't know the game enough to know what's causing that issue. 
---
How many Atoms you purchase?
---
tbh if you look at the Play Time pieces individually, they combo well with other paint styles for some great variations that don't look stupid.
---
For example, I'd probably pick up all of those Play Time helmets if they were sold seperately. It's really just the chest piece that's putting me off.
---
I always figured this was because people don't know how to sneak properly, damn my naivety. 
---
As a side note, you can always hop on the umbrellas and then up to the roof when people do this.
---
And how you have no idea how close you are to being called since the numbering system is in blockchain or some shit.
---
Always on when under 20%
---
That is the counter, for both/all. If you wanna add Dodgy lvl 3, Empath and other mutations with Strange in Numbers, plus meds/bobble heads/magazines lol. You'll be unstoppable. This game wasn't made properly for PvP balance imo. 
---
I'd like to see some coyote tan or dark earth tbh 
---
I really don't get it, seriously. This is suppose to be how they make money off the game but they are, like, quarter-assing it. I can't even compare it to fortnite as the mtx in that game are original models and textures, and dances, and actual animated emotes. In this game we can't even get basic palette swaps ffs!
---
This is what really makes me think they are just incompetent and out of touch. How could they fuck up something so simple when real money is on the line. What are they thinking with weird toy box skins, seriously. Seven year olds would look at this stuff and go "meh." I mean it, this doesn't make ANY SENSE! Why do they not want to make money?
---
The BoS don‚Äôt just horde plasma pistols dude. Nukes count as tech, a pretty massive reason to be involved. In addition to that it was research and tech that created the scorched, super mutants, etc. and controlling or removing it is ideal. 
---
Then there‚Äôs the enclave and their middle system, etc. like what?
---
they dont take that long to piece together, the most time is taken up in painting these, and I used a few old paintings to buy me some time too and re-use. I've found painting on a half page is the fastest thing, too. So... economical time management?
---
I‚Äôm level 47, nothing good as far as weapons, (yet) I show up, put a few tags into the queen and focus on the hordes. At least then I know I‚Äôm doing some damage. 
---
My weps dont do anything but warm the SBQs skin. They work on the rest them knuckles though. I got a good crippling build so at least it slows the big ones down. Plus, with passive mode on, I don‚Äôt have to worry bout grenade splash. If the nuke is in the right spot, I‚Äôll lead the horde to a missile launcher. Glowing blood, hardened mass, ionized meat, all prime sellables
---
 as that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm after anyways. 
---
Y‚Äôall big guns can go after her, leave me to play with the mob lol. 
---
Favor to ask from the under 100 guy, if you see me swinging away at the mob and I go down, help a brotha up, I always try to gift back stims used after battle (most tell me not to worry bout it) but to the dude that literally stood by me and waited until I died, then took my loot, hope your happy with the wood I was harvesting you dick bag. 
---
Why deal with a moron that shouts at you ? Hey the metal set goes for around 500 caps from Phoenix in watogs
---
Why not just have a separate crafting card setup that's always active? The system should be reworked, what we have now is atrocious and tedious. We already have access to all the cards, we just have to take the time to swap back and forth. Why not just give us that QoL change and give us access to those cards without needing to swap constantly? 
---
That aside, I think lockpicking, hacking and perhaps a few other essentials should just be granted regardless of cards. When you hit the level the card requires to equip, you just get them instead of having to unlock and equip the cards.
---
So everyone is still going on telling us to not buy something that doesn't really exist.  
---
Perfect.  So glad to see that this sub is still mostly crying about TSE/Dupers/non existant stuff.
---
And the loadingscreens made it even better.
---
I'm assuming but idk
---
It was -3 when i wrote that. 
---
When you kill a Legendary and loot vanishes in splatter
---
Your intuition is on point
---
If they aren‚Äôt in combat with you then you can‚Äôt one shot them. 
---
Tse shotgun or nuke launcher don‚Äôt matter. It can‚Äôt happen. Even with your damage stacked to crazy amounts. People have tested this all on YouTube. 
---
Your name is Exploit or "EXPLO1T".  If you don't see the irony of someone calling themselves Exploit warning cheaters about being locked, then there is no hope for you.  Just holding an item huh?  "I swear officer, those drugs aren't mine, I was holding them for a friend."  Brilliant!! 
---
Ok, I thought so but I didnt see the number change when I did it last night.. Now inslut me not.. 
---
I have no idea what time management means. Probably explains why I didn't make it past my first year of college
---
lol.  What are fog crawlers anyway?  Some kind of mutated beetle?
---
Oh yah I did one for page 1 https://imgur.com/a/KBUcW8N and a few other things. Its rather pleasing when my own art shows up too.
---
I've been doing more and more of the challenges not just for the Atoms, but because they are a nice starting prompt for your own daily adventures.
---
More to come!
---
-luck &amp; -endurance I believe
---
thanks!
---
As somebody who has been one shotted, while pacifist mode was on, with no bounty, with full health, I can unequivocally tell you that it is possible.
---
While its more convenient to have safe spots to fight the queen from outside the blast zone, maybe its time to just nuke the prime directly and make people actually venture into the heart of the nuke zone to fight the queen.  This should at least force them to pause and they have to make the walk over to get to the queen fight if they're interested, plus deal with the radiation, etc.  
---
If you're prepared, it shouldn't be too much of a hassle to deal with fighting the queen in the middle of the nuke zone anyways.
---
I glitched both of mine to go through the wall, it takes some effort but doable 
---
Not as helpful as not increasing her effective HP by not being there in the first place. If we weren't so focused on the SBQ (since that's the whole point of the event and all) then there wouldn't even be any adds for them to play around with since me and all the other guys with end game gear would just be instantly blowing them away like farts in the wind the second they spawn in.
---
The only problem is that pesky SBQ who is literally the only one there we're worried about DPSing as much and as fast as possible. When enough enemies actually pile up around me that I can't ignore through outhealing their DPS I could just spend all of 3-5s switching to an explosive shotgun and killing them all. Just saying that it would be much appteciated if people could help kill the one thing we need help killing instead of just swatting the gnats surrounding said thing.
---
you da man
---
Please post evidence. That‚Äôs all you have to do. There‚Äôs tons of evidence it can‚Äôt happen. 
---
Thank you! If you like rustic, you should have seen my swamp house in the Mire: https://imgur.com/a/7iZz1gH
---
Thanks for listing your build! Made a new character after realizing that when you get to level 50 it‚Äôs not a points reset so this is the perfect time for me to find a build to work towards.
---
The worst part is, her health and damage resistance scales with the amount of people doing the event. So when people are in the area but hide in the shed they are not only not helping, but they‚Äôre also making the fight harder
---
My sons character was Overweight by 20 some pounds yesterday when he tried to log in.  If he moved he would freeze and the only thing he could do was to open the map screen.  He of course couldn't fast travel being over encumbered.  I finally was able to get onto a server and got to his pipboy before the game froze dropped a bunch of stuff and then he was able to play.  I didn't have time last night to try it again to see if it was repeatable but I plan on doing that tonight and send off a bug report.
---
this is family goals
---
Wave emote is my go to for "friendly".
---
Come here emote and crouching near the bag is my go to for "here take this bag I dropped".
---
Disappointing I thought heat flashes would make fire damage hurt more and whoopsies would make your weapons break faster.
---
Better yet whoopsie should make you randomly unequipped weapons while firing 
---
Nah.. let them release what they want.  If some people like one thing and not another, and other people like something else and not the first thing, that's absolutely fine.  It appeals to a wider base.  There's already PA that fits right in and its free.  And from what we've seen datamined there'll be plenty more lore style skins.
---
If i were living in fallout and I were somewhat psycho, i might paint "Play Time" on my PA and go creep people out with it.  It's psychological warfare.
---
how?
---
Where I just wanna do gay stuff with Colin.
---
Thank you very much! :D
---
It's ok I locked myself out when I uninstalled after week 3
---
In bird culture this is known as a 'dick move.'
---
Yeah, that's an old design I had back in Fallout 4, it still works like a charm! 
---
I feel at the rate dupers are using bobbleheads if there isn't a new duping method they will soon run out 
---
I've never paid attention to these maps, what do they reward you?
---
Yeah me too :D
---
That's why I love the bunker. It isn't ever a problem there. 
---
It also seems like a great opportunity for cheaters to try and find exploits before its released to the world.
---
No thanks, just fix what we have.
---
Good question, what I did was I used the Stairs, which have the metal beams built into them. Then I just had the stairs themselves placed at the very entrance block to my home.
---
What about the bug that causes advanced power connectors to place on the floor above?
---
If I remember correctly, I built the wall, blueprinted it and removed it, connected my conduit and the. Went back into my blueprints for the wall to be placed back in the original spot....after a little messing around it let me set it down. I‚Äôve got 2 outside my camp. You can also try connecting it through a window 
---
I just plain forget. I often end up wandering for hours with the shop discount card instead of lone wanderer @.@
---
But what about someone with 99 identical TSE's. 5? 3? 2? 
---
Totally different and incredibly more dynamic animal. In one you're making literally 0 assumptions, in the other you're assuming the actions of thousands and thousands.
---
The conduit that kinda looks like a shower is designed to clip through walls. 
---
Pretty sure Butcher Pete is a song about a rapist. 
---
My moneys on pig foot. 
---
I don't see why you would be sorry. It has been in every game and has stayed the same but in 76 you have to switch the cards to do tasks that normally would be completed easily is kind of dumb. Either they shouldn't be cards at all and every player should have the skill starting with 1 and has some way of ranking it up or if you do have the cards it should be just one lockpick/hacker card that you level up OR it should be passive altogether. It is like my player knows it by heart one day and wakes up to forget it the next. I don't know.
---
yeah except they can with duped bobbleheads unfortunately. I see your point though
---
The way I do it is put a half wall by your generator and then use the sloped wall on top of it it'll cover most of the generator and leave a small opening you can get a with through
---
And I thought I made homey camps
---
I understand the feeling! I'm LV 170 and still trying to move a point around and get like 3 more crafting perks. I can honestly say I'm 99% sure any build with this armor, or maybe cavalier assassin for melee builds, will dominate in PvP when the server's go live. I also predict alot of ignorant people claiming hacks.
---
 I've had several people fight me and have no idea why they do no damage, and they don't get a clue when I walk towards them to let them kill me through sentinel. The majority of people I've heard from don't really fully understand endgame PvP building and don't realize that power armor is a liability. It's worthless in PvP against a tuned set of legendary armor. 
---
I randomly ran into a pack of 10 or so supermutants, all way higher level than I. I killed all of them but died in the process. So after I killed the last legendary super mutant and went to get my junk I got disconnected from the serve!!!!!!! It was honestly the single most infuriating moment plying the game. 
---
Once you find a weapon you like and start investing into that you'll find that it's kind of hard to waste points having perks equipped that you only use here and there. 
---
I use a rifle. In order to boost that damage I have to use most of the special points in perception for damage, not unlocking containers. 
---
Yeah as the game is now, tse handmade is the best weapon for dps in most conditions. However if everything went perfectly, an unyielding bloodied powerfist build would actually be the best dps weapon in the game. But that's a crazy risky build
---
LOL!  I actually had to look up my P2T key this weekend when someone was trying to talk to me!  (I wound up resetting it to match what I use elsewhere...)
---
I don't think that would come across like you think it does, but I like the creative explanation. üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt think I ever mentioned that I was three caps short, I just said I didn‚Äôt have enough.
---
I never noticed the workbench but if it‚Äôs at the back they would have had their back to it I guess as they were all facing the door
---
That Drill might actually be broken
---
I was level 45 a 2h melee build. I saw the SBQ(first time) being spawned. I thought let me see what i can do. Only a level 145ish (not sure if that was the correct level) with bigguns and me.
---
Turns out melee is fun and all but vs the SBQ is a bit of useless so i was a mate and i kicked the shit out of all the mobs so that the 145ish could do the damage. 
---
As soon as she landed i hit my super sledgein the face as much as i could. 
---
We got her to 50% hp and after that we got some help of some higher levels.

She was dead with in a couple of seconds maybe minutes. Good times, shitty loot but still good times!
---
For dps you‚Äôd want a tse minigun or .50 cal machine gun. I‚Äôve got one of both and the minigun does about 250dmg/shot and the .50 cal does about 550.
---
Slap an accelerated barrel on the minigun and you‚Äôll empty a 500 round mag in like 20 sec. 250dmg x 500 = 125000 dmg over the course of 20 sec. 
---
So the minigun would net you approx 6250 damage per second.
---
oh neat, I'll try that, thanks
---
I mean if anybody has a better idea? I'm all ears.
---
oh, I'll try that as well thanks
---
It‚Äôs a random event and the wire that needs to be cut is random too
---
Fuuuucck people are discovering my location. I've been there since literally day one
---
thanks
---
hey, there are couple of blow up houses, i couldnt locate one with dresser on 2nd floor, which side should i look standing near wallace ?
---
It's to bad this game sucks
---
I would just farm the armor spawn points looking for cores.  You can get a map of the armor locations and just pull the cores out. You can also take over the plant that creates them.
---
Localized or global both(I'm assuming your doing relatively the same thing) their both great thugs, and looking back at it the GameCube did screw slot of people over
---
I think Pig-foot Pete would die first and then Butcher Pete would later succumb to his injuries. 
---
Back before P2T I was rummaging around the mining shop basement and could hear someone upstairs.  At one point she sneezed.  By well trained habit, I said "Gesundheit"...
---
Cue slightly freaked out conversation between player and SO/brother/whatever.  Followed by me explaining how voice worked (at that time)...
---
I‚Äôve noticed this happens some time if you use one of those mesh steel staircases. Those things are bugged to no end.
---
Sounds like Dead Money to me. Big heist
---
A Wave is always the best way to start.  I'll usually do a Come Here if I'm going to drop something.  Generally, they'll see you using your Pip-Boy and wait.  I'll Heart if they seen antsy.
---
One trick someone else mentioned is to keep a Miner's Hat/Miner's Helmet on you.  In first-person, the headlamp aims wherever you are looking, so you can literally put a spotlight on the bag.  Other than that, teabagging seems to get the point across.
---
It's been worse for me honestly.. I crash constantly now. Love the game but man does it drive me crazy.. Oh well. 
---
Yeah, that would be nice.
---
Also wish the .50 hunting rifle was better than the .308 version.  No idea how they got the damage wrong on that...lol
---
Is the chance for a rad shower plan higher on the Queen? Got mine completly random. 
---
You said it brother 
---
You can convert the hunting rifle to .50 caliber but the damage is terrible and not worth it unless you have an excess of .50 ammo you wanna waste
---
Yeah, that's crazy.
---
Nice. I haven‚Äôt gotten that far in the game yet. But I have 23 of them in my stash. Thanks for the helpful tip. 
---
Have an upvote!!
---
Oh God, that quest. I've never seen a game so faithfully recreate the tedium of dealing with the government. 
---
What the guy posted below is accurate sorry at work didn't think to explain :) Gl!
---
Can't help you with plans, but you can get cores from the workshops at the power plants. You can farm sentry bots, they're always good for a core or two. Hit up the Free States bunkers once a day. In fact go anywhere that you can recall finding a fusion generator once a day. 
---
if you have learned the plan for 'Advanced power connectors' it has some specific conduits and components that let you run power more easily through walls and ceilings/floors.
---
They can sometimes be tricky to line up and get in the right place, but it's normally easier (and looks a lot better) than glitching a loose cable through a wall or using windows.
---
I see a lot of people complain about this but I honestly I understand why they did it. Since players have the ability to share perks ot makes sense to me that players have to equip it I dont believe its dumb at all
---
It takes a bit of getting used to, but it's not that bad. I don't like it as much, as far as how it functions, but I don't hate it. You can't build your character up as much, but I guess that just adds another degree of difficulty to the game.
---
Yes, of course.
---
Fallout 4 had **no** native .50 weapons.    Only a conversion for the old hunting rifle.   
---
Fallout 76 only has one native 50 weapon I believe, and the usual  conversions appear again, only they're worse because they don't boost damage in a substantial manner.
---
This game really needs a native .50 anti-materiel rifle.
---
That's backwards to me, they need to fix that.
---
The steak house has a fusion core spawn on the second floor sitting on a barrel, there's a generator you can pull the core from in watoga behind a lvl 3 locked door, and either Dyer chemical or sugar Grove spawns a decent amount of robo brains you can potentially get them off of.
---
Well my house just burned down.. oops 
---
It's a random event.  I've seen it in a few other places.
---
You need Advanced Power Connectors Plan (not sure if that's exactly what it's called).
---
That allows you to build conduits that will pass through walls.
---
Is there even any point to the drill? I‚Äôve messed with it around flatwood but it still just seems useless. Maybe it was supposed to be a nail gun? Like a scaled down version of the rail road gun. 
---
The fusion generator is a power supply, it doesnt give you fusion cores
---
No worries. And sure I've seen people like you before, but I had to pay an admission.
---
Beep boop. I'm a bot.
---
of course!
---
Blind hope I guess, I thought that if I kept hosing her with bullets and they could see her health bar had come down to 50% and there was still time they might shift themselves into action rather that end up with nothing, lesson learned though lol
---
Colonel actually. Fr tho I just want that marine armor helmet 
---
I dont think the fusion generator makes fusion cores. Its produces 100 power to plug into
---
Pig foot pete
---
.50 weapons dont do enough damage either.
---
I used to move my camp almost every session, until I discovered a junk pile behind my camp one day. Built an extractor, and haven't moved since.
---
Yes, there is a community called /r/Market76 that just 1 week ago was over these helmets and bandanas, but noone cared as why would they? They just wanted a nice looking item, it's not going to harm anyone. As of right now people could get banned for basically nothing because they traded some apparel back and forth, just so you know, that's a really bad comparison with drugs, because anyone who has a brain knows these are illegal, the items from devroom don't have that warning sign when you see these, you have no idea these could be from a illegal source. The fact that you need it explained is mindboggling, the only thing redeeming you is that a lot of people here can't think just like you do right now.
---
Yep.

I just remembered, in Vegas I'm pretty sure the magazines didnt stack their bonus, they just reapplied the bonus. Why the Hell didnt they keep that in the engine. =\
---
Gotta ask "Why not?" I mean, I've had lvl 68 Scorched Conquerors on top of the Poseidon Power Plant in the southern Forest, on the border with Ash Heap. How is that good? 
---
Normally, I would totally agree with you. Because something like this would be *by design*. You start in an area, and the developers want you to explore this area, before moving to the next. And they do this by limiting the areas by levels. Some do it strongly, others weakly. For example, recent Assassin's Creeds did it very strongly - you can handle 3-5 level difference between you and enemies, but anything beyond that is untenable, where a simple guard NPC with 10 level difference will just 1-shot you. Others do it softer, like this game, I took out a lvl 50 SB as a lvl 17. But there's usually a **plan** to it, the world is laid out a certain way.
---
In this game, this is not the case. As soon as you move out of the Forest, and sometimes not even then, the game gets stupid. I mentioned lvl 68 Scorched in Poseidon. I also had TWO lvl 50 SBs attack me, also in the forest, in mid-20s (at the club thing near Morgantown). And once you start doing Ash Heap or, god help you, the Divide, things get REALLY stupid. I was on my way to see Rose, and the bandit camp on the road was lvl 60 Mr Gutsy Colonels, which just SHRED at that level, and no build has armor penetration at that level to deal with them efficiently yet. Exited server, hopped to another, bam, lvl 16 Ghouls, entirely manageable. See, that's the problem, it's not **PLANNED**, it's all completely random. There's no rhyme or reason to it.
---
Oh its extremely backwards, people have been complaining about it since the game officially released, yet they still havent done anything about it
---
ITS TIME FORRRR.... THE BANNN HAMMMERR!!!
---
Although I partially agree with this people have shown screenshots of inventory with tens of thousands of bobbleheads. It's still going to take a while.
---
Out of curiosity, is there a CAMP object that does?
---
Oh ok I didn't know, thanks
---
I CAN EXPLAIN. IT WAS FOR SCIENCE
---
Excelsior!
---
Omg yes plz!
---
If we ever get to place them, just head to RobCo Research Center. Got like 8 different ones in one clear.
---
Ah right okay sorry lol 
---
Ah, excellent info. Thank you.
---
I figured this was the case and it‚Äôs been mighty frustrating. But I‚Äôm starting to actually get used to it. Knowing that there are times when some areas are ‚Äúno go‚Äù but not knowing it until I‚Äôm in the shit adds to the hostility of the Wasteland. 
---
It's so fun, dude. You'll need the luck card "starched genes" to keep any mutations permanent. Definitely my favorite part of the game.
---
He‚Äôs five feet tall and he‚Äôs five feet wide
---
Ah great thanks a lot
---
Wires go thru windows. That's how i do it.
---
Height can be an issue but you can use various conduits to get around it.
---
But they made sure to fix those darn power cores recharging upon disconnection.
---
God I wish some of this stuff was in game, I want the sentinel BOS paint and the Hunters hood so badly
---
Great one too!
---
Thanks a lot I will do 
---
Nope, best bet is to occupy power plants or run around trying to find power armor spawns. Sentry bots drop them with usually 80-90% core left or sometimes more
---
I did that yesterday!! I‚Äôm level 130+ and a level 25ish came by and I let him get shots on the 3stars
---
It was me all along! I was waiting in the bushes and as soon as you left to collect scrap, I too was collecting. Reaping the bounties of your camp! Haha I just love the free water and corn and Tati's. Maybe I'll share some with you... NOT! Sorry what's that? I can't hear you over me chewin' on this here corn cob.
---
Yeah, that lockpicking/hacking was how fallout 4 worked.  You get to the right level to unlock the ability.
---
Still a while it will be like a crack addiction plus you know those dupers are sharing that shit with everyone they team up with 
---
So let me get this straight.
---
Because I have the Curator perk card equipped and it's bugged, so everytime I get disconnected or log in/out it resets the effects so it never runs out, it's my problem and I should just *not* use this part of the game?
---
Great stuff, excellent logic, 10/10 game mechanics. 
---
Here's a AAA game, but don't use any of it because it might be bugged and people will get mad!
---
Again, I hope all the dupers get banned so you can stop using it as an excuse for Bethesda. 
---
I have a big problem with people being banned from software they PAID to use because it was developed so badly it's full of exploits.
---
Direct your anger to the people that have been paid millions of $$$, or keep crying for a banwave that will NEVER happen.
---
Oh his is all about immigration advocacy, mine is all about mental health and disability advocacy. His whole mission is pretty much focused on ICE and the border wall and it is a great and noble cause, and I even did some fun little phone pranks and call campaigns to further his cause while I did therapy. Small stuff.
---
Now I had my galvanizing moment and it pushed me into advocating for my cause. Part of my whole mission is getting people heard. I‚Äôm already loud and outspoken, and can get people to listen to me very easily. What my goal is is to be and ear and not just a mouth piece.
---
Also if needed and I can swing it for certain cases I plan on showing up in person to solve problems. Hence the Merc part of the name. Those instances if someone wants to compensate me I plan on just telling them to donate time or money instead elsewhere. Pay me by paying it forward. 
---
I had no idea legendary items could have multiple effects when I played the beta and thought that the Troubleshooter's Pump-Action Shotgun I found could be leveled up based solely on the 1/5 filled diamond slots. I thought it'd make sense to be able to use rare mats to level/rank up a legendary item to rank 5 or something in order to keep it relevant as you progress. 
---
I gave the game a break before the new patches to give it time to figure things out. Played last night and went into my first nuke zone to see what‚Äôs going on. Managed to kill a 3 star bloated ghoul, after depleting my shotgun ammo. I was so sad when I got a 1 Star pipe pistol and some caps 
---
Like some other men do... 
---
do do dooo do do do 
---
That one is so great 
---
About 1 or 2 minutes. You dont lose weapons when killed only the junk in your inventory 
---
Alright thanks I was thinking of claiming the power plant so I‚Äôll try it out thank you
---
Ah right lol I‚Äôm a noob
---
With fireproof can you not die from blowing yourself up?! If so I‚Äôm gonna level that up first once I get it lol, might save a few level ups until I get it.
---
Great read ! Thanks for the laughs.
---
There‚Äôs a Mirelurk queen 3stars floating too.
---
The hermit crab is ok my tank will
---
Go 1:1 with it but having the others aggroed I‚Äôd have just respawned someplace safer
---
fuck fuck fuckit
---
Why the hell are people downvoting this, it's a serious issue that doesn't seem to be getting better. It's probably the last thing which truly affects the framerate negatively 
---
I don't mind silliness if it's for a good cause. Like, when I saw the "Child's Play" in-game notice, I thought they were doing something for the [Child's Play charity](https://www.childsplaycharity.org/), which I thought would have been really neat. 
---
Missed opportunity IMO.
---
That's good to know.  I didn't realize there was a formal way to do this.  I ended up putting a discreet half-wall gap under my roof, but this would be much cleaner.
---
How is the plans going? All good?
---
Mantis Shrimp.
---
With fireproof, you take an extremely small amount, paired with a dense mod on your chest piece, it's none.
---
You use the water for trade? 
---
I run 3x small purifiers at my camp, keep 20 ish waters in stash, 20 ish on my persons and run can-do rank one and generally come out water positive in a playtime w/o hitting my camp more than 1 or 2 times. I find more purified water spawns on the east side of the map vs the west being more boiled water.
---
If you using it for vendors, check out Charleston Landfill, it can be highly contested but the industrial water purifier there actually seems to put out 60/hr and 3x junk nodes helps for screws and springs. and you dont have to build the purifier, just run power to it.
---
i‚Äôm not sure about the crops but i find that sometimes my purifiers don‚Äôt show the actual amount of water in them, and i have to hit ‚Äútransfer‚Äù and wait a couple seconds before it shows the inventory. usually it will show no water has been produced, then when i transfer it has max. 
---
Robobrains no longer drop fusion cores.
---
How long is a typical load for console players?  I'd always thought the the moaning around this quest a bit hyperbolized, but it makes a bit more sense to me when considering that you have to run in and out several times in addition to the events.
---
As far as we know the BOS paints are going to get ingame when some PVP stuff comes out, when that is we have no idea
---
interesting...i will have to test this out.  I have a full set of the Urban Scout  - most of it modded (the purchased mods).  Will put it all on, holster the weapon, and see if I disappear.
---
How many people are spending money buying atoms I wonder. Just from playing the game I've bought Camo PA paint, the Christmas T-51 paint and the Blackbird PA paint. I'm back up to 2080 caps looking at buying some camp stuff. The game throws atoms at you just for playing.
---
Where fighting the Scorchqueen turns into a Powerpoint presentation
---
awesome I'll look for those!
---
Can whoever has aggro on her walk into the shed to make her sonic blast and poison cloud in there? Shed people need to be subjected to all that she has to offer. 
---
At least he probably got off to his fate
---
As far as I know, the only assured location you can get plans is from Phoenix the vendorbot in Watoga. But you have to get the lack of the draw, like plans with any other vendor 
---
Just curious, i moved more points into cha and started getting better stuff of the vendors too
---
Me and my friend have had pieces un-equip when we fast travel.  No idea what is making it happen.  We're able to re-equip them from the pip boy while wearing it.  Jet pack still works even if the piece is unequipped.  Some random bug I guess.
---
Hate that quest. I'm not american so my government systems aren't like that
---
Was happening with my leg but I noticed it was a bit low in health, once repaired it worked correctly.
---
What about that wrestling heavyweight with the penchant to try holes his dates do not appreciate?
---
Thanks! I've got a lvl 45 lever action rifle, again a friend gave to me. I've also just unlocked the Blade of Bastet yesterday, so I'll have to give that a go. 
---
I paid $400 for brick building plans @harpers ferry.
---
Wooby was banned.
---
For the record though - the Fusion Generator Plans (for the CAMP object that produces 100 power) should drop from the Power Up events.  You have a 1-in-3 chance, and the game apparently ensures you get all three before cycling again.  I believe this is also where the Nuka-Cola vending machine and Windmill plans can come from.
---
I've tried that but nothing is listed in the menu. Do you mean it still goes to your inventory even though it shows it empty?
---
Add the drill bit mod. Then with Weapon Artisan repair it to 200% - it gets a decent damage bonus. Add melee perks and it's fun for lower level enemies.
---
This applies to the chainsaw, ripper, and Mr. Handy Buzz Blade. It's really nice for tearing through a group of ghouls.
---
so just a random reward then. wish we could repeat those missions.  
---
Yeah but we have another update slated for the end of this month so we will see what all they do. Hopefully this is one of the things included, I would love to have incentive to use my hunting rifle again
---
I think mutated Crawfish
---
Then why not take heavy weapons, almost same range but with weight reduction perks?
---
Hey guys what's goin on
---
Get the speedy receiver for it. Really ups the DPS and some vendors sell the mod if you can't craft it.
---
Aside from the Advanced Power Connectors, another option is to put the purifiers inside too. I build over water, and my ground floor has a 1x4 section with no foundation in the middle. I place my purifiers in the water, surround them with foundations, and then put fences on the inside of the foundations surrounding the purifiers, so you can't fall in. I put a single fusion generator behind the purifiers. Then I build walls around the whole thing. The 2nd floor is where I have my actual "house."
---
They have an "AI" looking for critters,which itself uses server resources (the finite thing limiting the 24 player camps). And then productive items like purifiers have timers and conditions to meet aka power, so those also use server resources more than the XYZ location of a wood floor vs the environment floor.
---
I'd like a lot of things from NV. But it's not gonna happen sadly
---
You can but there better options especially if your are trying to min/max
---
Not only the Owl Mask, there was a whole bunch of other masks that were distributed:
---
- Faschnacht Death Skull Mask
---
- Faschnacht Devil Mask
---
- Faschnacht Harlequin Mask
---
- Faschnacht Merman Mask
---
- Faschnacht Napoleon Mask
---
- Faschnacht Owl Mask
---
- Faschnacht Second Man Mask
---
- Faschnacht Witch Mask
---
half wall and half wall work just fine
---
Ah okay that‚Äôs strange I got the windmill twice in a row and then the large generator maybe I should try again 
---
I'd like to see any colour. I mean we collect tons of paint in cans. 
---
Ya I feel the same. I only have 1-2 hrs in game but from a few streams that I have watched and articles I have read I always feel nostalgic for Fo4. But I realized that they want this to be more of a Rust like game so I am in since I'm a fan of Fallout in general. Cant lie though, i am definitely excited for Fallout 5 lol. 
---
Also, thanks for all the help guys. I do I appreciate it
---
Poseidon energy plant and I think monongah energy have fusion core things that make them if you are occupying the workshop 
---
no the menu switches from empty to showing a full inventory. but it sounds like this isn‚Äôt your problem. which purifiers are you using? i had really slow production with the small purifiers but since switching to the industrial ones i‚Äôve had less problems. 
---
Just like the people who had items stolen from there inventory only to find out that they was clicking to fast and selling stuff without realizing it lol. 
---
I‚Äôll wait for proof. üòÅüßê

Here's hoping

Nope, I scrapped the gun and didn't relies you can upgrade it. Went back to rebuild and it wouldn't let me build a new one

I believe the word you‚Äôre looking for is holds. Also he‚Äôs not even a contender, hes still in physical therapy for the gunshot wound to the knee that ended his career.

Nothing that great, but there's a (small) chance to get power armor and power armor mod plans.

I have a luck of 8 now, so I think I'm going to collect a whole bunch of maps, stock up on level ups and luck boosting items. Then, when I have enough, I'm going to max out luck and dig them all up at once and then restore my special to previous levels.
---
It seems to be the only way to get those plans for me, because the stores have been having the same plans for sale for the last 80 levels or so.. :(
---
THEY WHAT. Aw hell no. No. NO. Spank my ass this is what i feared.
---
Yeah, it's so much less dumb to be forced to waste points permanently to have those things......  
---
right?
---
Why not? Nothing from NV?

Facing towards Wallace, to his right. Should be a two story house with a dresser on the second floor, I've seen helmets there. On the first floor there is a chair, I've also seen them there too. Remember to not pick them up if they're not the helmet, just server hop until you see them.
---
This happened to me a few days ago. Every time I loaded into an area, teleported anywhere, or got out then back in my armor, the left arm would not be equipped. Every time.
---
I realized that all the other pieces were repaired above 100%, but the left arm was probably around 90%. After repairing it above full, it stayed equipped. 
---
I would bet if legendary equivalents of those weapons existed, they'd be dropped there. I'm going to guess the issue here is the game is trying to drop legendary equivalents of items that cannot be legendary.
---
But yeah, it sucks when that happens.
---
I think it comes down to where you build. I had my camp at that drained lake for a long time, and it hardly ever got attacked, and when it did, it was something small and easy to kill. Since then I've moved to a cooler, more dangerous spot, and I get attacked pretty regularly. And those attacks have included glowing ones, deathclaws, and most recently a legendary wendigo. So my heavy machine gun turrets have been fairly useful in that location.
---
Just read this post and went to Welsh train station. 3 server hops later I got a Calibrated Mod pop. 
---
OP CONFIRMED.
---
&gt;i hear theres a mod on console 
---
I also sold or scrapped the gun - I couldn't think of a situation that I'd really use it in, so I didn't want it clogging up my inventory. 
---
Except there ARE no areas that are no-go *consistently*. You can go through a location without any trouble, head to the next one, realize enemies there are too high, backpedal to location that you just cleared, but now that location is a no-go as well, because a high level passed by and spawned lvl 68+ enemies, and you are lvl 15. There's no consistency to it, the entire thing is entirely random, and thus encourages server-hopping, which harms the community.
---
I don't mind hostility of the wasteland, I get it, but they fucked that up as well. Survival elements (food, water, rads) are beyond trivial in this game, when they could have been challenging. They could have made the wasteland feel much more hostile by means other than randomly spawning insane bullet sponge enemies for you.
---
And that's another thing - how about making the game about SKILL? The difference in difficulty between lvl 11 Supermutant and lvl 68 Supermutant is how much HP it has, and the gun it uses. That's pretty much it. By comparison, a game with decent combat system, could give higher level enemies more attacks, but ones you would have to actively dodge, block, take cover from, etc. Make higher level enemies actually dangerous, not just bullet-spongy.
---
But even if you were right, and this was on purpose to make the wasteland hostile and unpredictable, what about loot? OK, so I'm lvl 17, and I ran into a half dozen lvl 68 Supermutants in Harper's. Not great. It's an 8 min battle, I spend almost all of my ammo, and I'm down to 3 Stimpaks, but I won. And? Did I get massive XP for it? **NO!** That was day after the patch that nerfed XP from high level enemies, it was in the patch notes. So I'm punished for that, for winning against difficult odds. Did I get excellent loot for it? **NO**, I got some guns that require lvl 45 to use, I'm lvl 17. What the fuck am I going to do with lvl 45 guns!? The entire fight was entirely 100% pointless waste. It wasn't fun, it wasn't profitable.
---
Bottom line, I'm still gonna have to go with shit design. It's too consistently shit designed, across too many areas of the game. 
---
I just think like it must suck to put so much work into something and then it not turn out exactly how you would have liked, probably because of deadlines etc. I wonder if all of these companies will learn that it's better to take their time with beta testing ect. rather than having people pay full release price to beta test and then losing the trust of the fans etc.
---
Just need to stock pile bullets now.
---
WHERE DID YOU GET THE DOG!?!?

I WANT THE DOG!
---
They havent banned very many. Only people who's free speech they disagree with and some people who got into their dev room (which shouldn't have been on public servers).
---
The difference between this game and previous titles is that this one is a multiplayer game. While past titles allowed you acquire every single perk in the game, eventually making you OP, this one limits you to keeps the game relevant after "finishing" the game. The only strategy you got from previous titles was the order you unlocked them. Aside from strategy, it adds game balance, especially for a multiplayer game. You either have to focus on one type of weapon, or you can focus on multiple, but doing so requires you to adjust your play-style. The game allows you to run a single weapon type build, however, if you want multiple, you're going to have to change your play-style.
---
Now this part is important, as I mentioned above, the cards you choose will determine your \*play-style\*, for example, you can choose to run Thru-hiker, while not needed, it makes it easier to keep your character well fed and hydrated at all times, which works well with Rejuvenated. However, instead of keeping large amounts of food and beverages on your person, you can acquire food at each location you visit to satisfy your needs. This adds difficulty, but rewards you with extra cards slots. In the end, you're determining the level of difficulty of the game, since you can't just change it in the settings because this is a multiplayer game, but doing so rewards the player. The game allows you to run a single weapon type build, however, if you want multiple, you're going to have to change your play-style. This method of character building makes every person unique.

As you mentioned, lockpicking and hacking is not required since the rewards aren't much different than what you get in events, quests, etc. You also don't always need 3 lockpicking or 3 hacking, so instead of having multiple cards of the same, with different ranks, they have made it so you can select the number of cards you need to perform these tasks. If you hate swapping cards, while it's not advisable, then re-allocate points to keep them. I can't stress this enough, the game rewards you for difficulty.
---
While I wouldn't make them passive or add a swap build feature, because it defeats the purpose of the cards, I would allow you to tag cards as favorites so they show up in the beginning of the pile since you can eventually get overwhelmed with duplicate cards.
---
Can't believe bad players are downvoting you for this.
---
What if, one of them didn't know the gun was loaded?  Or, in another scenario, maybe kicks the buck-buck-bucket?
---
True but it isn't very good.
---
I've seen a frame drum at the welch station that there are not plans for either. Not to be mistaken for the snare drum.
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôm gonna stick around the Poseidon plant for a while thank you
---
You aren't the boss of me! You aren't my real dad! 
---
Same happened to me and a buddy. We were hammering away at the Queen and this assclown kept one-shotting us... like why? Buddy and I are both high level and like to PVP but turn Pacifist on in nuke zones, especially when the Queen is involved! 
---
I normally think these "PVP is bad reeeeeee" posts are a waste of text but in this case you're right, purposely messing with people in nuke zones is straight up shitty. Unless it's some moron who built their turret farm base right behind the golf club, in which case game on.
---
My gatling gun does lots more damage than a minigun.  But its rate of fire is slower.
---
GG is the best heavy weapon period. It hits hard and is very ammo efficient. 
---
That's exactly what happens. 
---
I'm not on to compare, but i thought gatling had quite a bit for damage per round.
---
.....wow
---
On PC there's a mod that does just that.
---
I'm sad I missed out on the hot rod paint jobs though. 
---
Saves ammo as the bullets do significantly more damage. The only time dps matters is on tanky or high health enemies 
---
All the time on PS4 Pro.
---
The perks are way more interesting than in Fallout 4. Like, did you even play Fallout 4? 
---
You're as cold as ice. 
---
Did it really? I had no idea. That does explain why I never had to do repairs. I just thought maybe it was really tough and since I basically only use it for FT and occasional nuke zones it simply didn't get the chance to become very damaged. But I've definitely noticed that its condition has been going down, now.
---
I appreciate what they were trying to do with that quest, but at the same time, I hated it.
---
I'm sorry for your loss! Misread and thought they gave you weapons as well. 
---
Rare junk is tough to lose acquire. Wanted to mod my handmade (I'm low level) but it called for black titanium. Check stash; only one black titanium ore from the Mother Lode quest. Not that rare, but bah, not sure when I'll easily find more (I know, I know, workshops, but the last time I took one, some high level zoomed across the map and one-shotted me).
---
That happens to me. I think it has to do with the perk that consumes less of your crit meter. It seems to go away after I kill the enemy that triggered it, but still super annoying. 
---
My bad most of the people on here at just like "I want free shit, i dont care if you have to pay for servers to host my data"
---
I can agree the prices a bit high, the best advice i can give you is to just not buy anything you feel is priced too high. Sales metrics is what will lower the price, eventually they will see where a price point appears that the player base starts to buy more stuff. 
---
Try playing warframe and you will see where im coming from, its not that uncommon to have the new hottness released that costs you 80.00 real cash or you can farm in the game currency and buy it for technically free as well. 
---
The level 45 LAR is worth holding on to, just in case you don't run into the plan. I lucked out massively - I got 3-star legendary LAR drop, which does extra damage to super mutants, adds damage resistance when reloading and also reloads faster, IIRC. It can be tough to find enough of them to scrap to get proper mods, but even unmodded, it is still one of the best non-exotic weapons. 
---
The issue was happening to me for a couple weeks on Xbox. Its usually my right leg and arm.. sometimes the helmet. The pipboy shows a mix of PA pieces and regular armor equipped.. it;s weird!
---
PS4 - and I definitely appreciate it, but I'd rather do it myself :).
---
There are more interesting perks than in fo4. The system is worse. 
---
Those are two different things!
---
Unfortunately, you cannot actually OWN this dog :/ But if you want to find the dog and take a picture with it or build your camp here, check out this youtube video. Not my video btw

---
I saw theres already one wallpaper in the datamined atom shop stuff, im hoping there are more options like we have for floors at the moment
---
Nope. Dude came in, shot up my camp, drop bag of some one star legendaries as a consolidation prise, and then message me to kill him.  I refused and he hit me with what looked like a super Sledge, single shot and I was dead.  Never hit him, never had a workshop, didn't have any turrets.
---
I dunno, I think half the ones doing the vigilante duper witch hunting are just dupers themselves (or using gear bought from dupers) looking for an excuse to grief people. Me and my friends were at my super out of the way camp last night, just crafting, repairing, and dropping spare ammo plans etc. on the floor for each other to pick through (as you do). Some guys show up, attack my camp. I took the bait, killed the wanted guy. Now I'm being one shot by three different guys using explosive guns. Dropped all my junk is just bulked (yeah, I should have stashed that before investigating). Wrecked my decon arch. I just said hell with it. Cut my losses. Ignored them, looked them up on PSN and blocked them, hopped to a different server, and moved my camp to rebuild it.
---
I'm sure they congratulated themselves on bringing the dupers to Justice. Stressed I haven't seen a post about it somewhere.
---
If having a couple people in the shed means you couldn't defeat the SBQ, then you weren't prepared to defeat the SBQ in the first place. That's not on them homie, that's on you.
---
There's a nanny bot around there that gives you stuff for listening to a children's story for her.
---
I really like the idea of some legendary mods like that. Would definitely add some nice variety. Maybe make players consider using a different weapon because they rolled a great mod for it. Plus you can mix and match the effects (limited, as you said, by how many legendary slots they use) for some interesting builds. 
---
It shouldn't cost atoms, interior walls should already be in the base game.
---
This is encouraging! Do you have a link at all?
---
You‚Äôre welcome 
---
Half the time they don‚Äôt even fire for me. A mole rat will be wrecking my shit right in front of a turret and it just watches...then sometimes fires at **me**. 
---
You hit enter or the return symbol if your on mobile. 
---
Yeah for sure.. like "oh i got my TSE free from a friend, i never duped or cheated"
---
thanks a lot!
---
No date announced, no announcement of all future content, just a confirmation that quests, events, vaults, and player vending are coming. I'm being optimistic and thinking next month we hear something, then the update won't be far behind the announcement. Plenty of other redditors will tell you Bethesda is cutting its losses and closing down the servers. They aren't, but that's what salty fanboys will tell you
---
I agree. It's dumb because it actually makes those perks pointless. Like... there is no trade off there other than tedious nature of having to switch. Gameplay wise it makes the entire thing pointless. If they want them to be perks then there should be some cooldown on switching perks or something. Otherwise why do they exist? 
---
If Marine Armor had its stats buffed a bit I'd appreciate that too.
---
Whyyyyyyy does the trade price loop back to 25000 from 0? That's incredibly annoying
---
I'm using the small purifiers. I might end up having to move near water or just make more of them then.
---
I should clarify that I'm not convinced Luck is a determining factor in these, I've been unable to find any conclusive stats on this. The post I've shared mentions their luck stat, but... People are saying that the level matters (so definitely hang on to them till you're at least level 50), so maybe it was that what was causing the difference in loot.
---
It‚Äôs honestly annoying being in power armor all the time, I‚Äôm using Excavator because of the carry weight bonus at least until I find some better armor.
---
It's probably the last couple of sentences that got the butthurt stirred up.
---
PS4- SCORCH BEAST QUEEN.
---
I had a scorchbeast queen bug last night. She was down to 1/4 health, flew backwards  all the way off the map until she was hardly rendered off in the distance. Its extremely frustrating to put all your resources into taking down a queen and have her peace out like that. Please fix this. 
---
That's a shame 
---
More damage per bullet so uses less lead. Speedy receiver should be fast enough. Also apparently you can throw in Martial Artist. Not sure if that's a bug.
---
Yeah ofc there should be base items. I just meant that Bethesda has some motivation to implement this as they could do some Atom Shop ones too.
---
The minigame is stupid. 
---
I have 13 luck. If I equip all the hacker cards, all I have to do is find a couple of the bracket pairs and I'm left with 4 words so I just brute force it.
---
Lock picking isn't difficult and I never run out of picks. Just drop us into an animation but have us auto succeed if the skill is high enough. There's no real chance of failure. Minigame adds nothing. 
---
Fought her for the first time last night and rad shower dropped for me. Probably will never build one though because I can't find at least 10 of a given flux in a blast zone to purify one :(
---
I mean are any explosive weapons? Even the Fatman is disappointing
---
Eeeeh, debatable. I'm quite fond of 50 Cal, it strikes a better balance between rate of fire, damage and ammo. It's not as wasteful as a minigun, but not as punishing to missed shots as the gatling. 
---
Minigun also works amazingly well with explosive two-shot, whereas gatling benefits the least from it. So it also depends on the kind of the gun you get.
---
"it just works"
---
This would be a good solution. 
---
So far none of the datamine posts on here have a picture of it, all there is is the name, and its called ‚Äústar burst wallpaper‚Äù or something like that, its the same design as the carpet floor that has like star shaped designs on it, for some reason theres like 10 floors coming in the atom shop and only one wallpaper
---
you don't need flux to attach a bought mod, only to craft it if you have the plans.  
---
when you go to attach a mod, it still shows you the needed mats as if you were drafting it, but it will still attach
---
After you complete the mayor for a day, only the one you attack defends itself.
---
The gatling is far more ammo efficient because of the low rate of fire, hits like a truck, and also doesn't need the spin up time. But it comes down to personal preference. If u like spraying ammo with the minigun then use the minigun. 
---
&gt;almost no risk. 
---
Except for the constantly spawning level 60+ deathclaws, yao gui, anglers, ghouls, scorched, the random nearby non-queen SBs, etc.   
---
But yeah, almost no risk. 
---
That was actually my favorite quest in the entire game. I thought it was hilarious 
---
Wow.
---
I've already been there with my level 80 buddies. I promptly got my ass kicked.
---
Anyone how or if dense and padded stack? With each other or on multiple limbs 
---
Do they not realize how hard this is to sell something for 0 caps, or any amount that isnt 25k? Press left one too many times and you gotta spend another 10 minutes playing operation 
---
Right lmao
---
I just loaded into a server, and first thing I noticed was my camp wasn't there besides a couple of walls. As it slowly began to form completely, my char got frozen and I couldn't move. I could only access the map and fast travel, nothing else worked. After fast travelling a couple times I was still frozen, unable to do anything besides opening and looking around the map.
---
Not even a minute, mate. I waited maybe a couple of minutes for the guy ahead of me (he was fine) and then when it was my turn I had less than a minute offloading my stuff when a pair of 150+s rocked up and tried bumping me off the vendor.
---
I'm hopeful that the tools will get bored and leave. The community as a whole shows little tolerance for this so it's only a matter of time. 
---
Ghad help these folks IRL. Life is a mega-b*tch and  is more than happy to punk yo' a$$ for being a dick.
---
Only after adding ones for each building type for free.
---
Yes. He is making assumptions but the devs know the exact percentages of drop rates and can quickly extrapolate from that real numbers than can be applied.
---
Well damn, sorry about that, I didn't notice I usually just take all from the dead not really look at their inventory. The other two spots still work though I can't remember where other generators spawn unfortunately.
---
...... you never noticed the workbench?   
---
Bruh this must have been your first SBQ fight then. Sounds like you shouldn't be talking shit.
---
TSEs
---
Instructions clear, trapped in xbox. Send help.
---
Yeah whatever man, please implement wallpapers Bethesda!
---
I believe it was meant to be humorous.
---
Yeah unless you're trying to set something for 0 caps and are at like 1378 and you think its safe to hit R1 and it takes you back to 25k
---
I like the variety of building materials we have, perhaps levels for each of them so that people could still have the look they want but levels of protection like you said.  I wouldn‚Äôt mind small grids of squares in certain areas the encompass the camp build circles. We could have twins and the server would select an open spot in that area that anyone‚Äôs camp would fit within. 
---
it is certainly possible that I sold/trashed it in my pointless pursuit for perfect gear.   lol

**Post Patch issues encountered last night:**
---
1. ***Frequent Game Loading Freezes***, also occurs when Fast Travelling forcing a reboot.
---
2. ***Enemy Loot not Loading after kill***, many enemies were not Lootable as they were stuck in a loading sequence, returning later (more than 5 minutes) would yield loot about 30% of the time.
---
3. ***CAMP Could not be placed***, had to server hop about 8 times to get my CAMP to load, even though I had another character (separate account) in the area, and there was never anything in my CAMPs location, a friend was also having the same issue,
---
4. ***Events not completing when they should***, "Line in the Sand" took more than 10 minutes to complete after the last enemy was killed.
---
&gt;Welcome
---
This is what I think they should do. Simple solution seems to be if someone has pacifist mode on they can take and give no PvP damage, no damage to player camps, etc. If you want to battle someone, it's easy enough to turn that off.
---
Shooting the paperbagallways does the trick with a thumbs up emote. But yes its a QoL in this game.
---
However there are more pressing matters imo.
---
Always thought the low drop rate was was an intentional choice. It's a similar design to World of Warcraft's farming/raiding/grinding for Loot/Gear.  And anyone who has played WoW before knows how often Raid Bosses actually drop something (not considering when Boss drops were shared)
---
Not being hostile dude, just saying we shouldn't have to pay for them to fix a mistake.
---
Maybe they realized the list would be too long to post on a page. Lol
---
I think I did that, bit I'll have to go check
---
I want it as an item i can break out and play anywhere, not just in as a static feature in my camp =P
---
Aside from the two standard paint, those being standard and prototype, none.  The paints that are available for X-01 are from the atomic shop.  The limited ones have been tricentennial(preorder), hot rod, and blackbird.  Might be missing one but I think that‚Äôs all the limited ones.
---
Well, I just feel dense now. Lol.
---
100% agree. Card swapping passives is an absolute chore, at best. No, I should not need a mod to alleviate the issue either, it should be baked into the core game. Passives should either have no SPECIAL cost to equip in their current form, or make them completely passive and require 3/6/9 points in the respective SPECIAL category per rank.
---
Example:  
---
Picklock = 3P
---
Expert Picklock = 6P
---
Master Picklock = 9P.   
---
Then make locked items produce greater rewards based on the lock difficulty level.
---
Durability is the Size of the bar (Ie the items health), Condition is how much of it is full up to 200%
---
Never thought I‚Äôd see the day when we actually *thank* Bethesda for a longer load time.
---
Regardless, it was a much needed and welcome change.
---
They should use the current "carry toys to increase rad resistance" event to detect dupers by seeing who has a half million rad resistance.
---
Even in the fallout universe, freedom of speech protects you from government censorship. It is in no way shape or form an actual or intended protection of that right on private platforms.
---
Yeah, I was thinking about the fusion core change for workshops to. Was supposed to be 8 and was put in a .8, then reverted.
---
Absolute unit
---
Can‚Äôt you just enable your mic to area and drop the loot?
---
Definitely easier when everyone gets stuck in like that üëç
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks internet stranger!
---
Whats your Ps4 gamer tag same as this one?
---
I only wreck bases that arnt up to code. Like screw your ugly floating plateform base, I'll level that every time. Someone puts time into a pretty little cottage I'll let it stand.
---
That may be the problem I‚Äôll check when I log back on. To be fair I thought it produced fusion cores so I‚Äôm not too fussed on missing out on it. Would be nice to have it like so I‚Äôll check thank you
---
Isn't that what custom location markers are for?  I don't use them but I've accidentally created a few and have had to remove the markers on the map. You can move the marker as well after you've created it.
---
Its redundant and makes the community hostile and negative. Its like some Red Scare level shit. YOURE a commie, YOURE a commie.

Are we roleplaying the encroachment of communism (dupers) on capitalist society?

Is this the Vault test?

ohno

You could also have the wire go through a window,  and then hit "Replace" on the wall and change it to a closed wall. This at least works for brick walls.
---
Yeah lets see 200-600 a day divided by 3 million is anywhere from 5000-15,000 days. Yep real soon.... No joke either I know a few players that have in the millions. Some more conservative dupers only went between 30-40k worth of everything.   
---
Oh and if you think they are sharing the issue they already have and many mules have the millions range.

this is an awesome idea!

You can obtain these items without knowing how they were loaded into the game. It's possible to buy them if they're sold to a vendor, people could have traded or paid caps for them not knowing they were exploit items, etc

I would love for this to be my main as I have a anti armor Gauss rifle, but it's so damn heavy as well as the ammo, for the damage output I'm seeing it's just not worth it.

Yeah ok
---
Butcher pete, cause hes hack and whacking and smacking.
---
Do you mean you didn't tell him? Because you mentioned it.
---
Haha na. Early on alot of threads popped up assuming it as bugged.
---
Just bethesda being cheeky
---
I'm sure it's coming.
---
Advanced Power Connectors plan will give the conduit pieces to go through walls or ceilings. You can buy them at Harper‚Äôs Ferry or get them from a random drop after capturing/defending workshops. The wall pass through conduit was bugged for me but there are pieces that fit together on a ceiling that will effectively pass power through the structure, one points up and the other points down. Just place one and the counterpart will snap onto it. 
---
That makes sense. Thanks for the info.
---
still better than a wood armor piece 
---
Haters will say it's fake. \~smh\~
---
Nah. Most kill 1-3minutes
---
I hope it was this, I like that idea.
---
It's annoying to see youtubers criticize Bethesda for this particular move.  They've done plenty of stupid shit but to be against this move just seems petty.
---
Let's hope there is something coming soon.
---
I have no idea what you should do. I'm just another player. I would be upset too. 
---
I used to think it was kindergarden because that's where you started growing the kids
---
Oh boy. lol Someone really dislikes this thread.
---
I hope they'll release more, but try fighting team vs team, that's lots of fun.
---
I tend to stay in one place, but I'm always up for moving if I find a cool spot.
---
Butcher Pete has a fiesty way about him, but Pig-foot Pete is an absolute unit. I think based on willingness to chop, Butcher wins.
---
Thumbs up
---
This was a good read. 
---
Yup pyrogirl8 lol
---
If you have 100 explosive bobbleheads you can just use all of them at once and they will all be active at once. Same with 1000 or any amount dupers can have
---
In week one in my first nuke zone at level 40, I got an explosive executioner shotgun, level 45, couldn't even use it yet.
---
People don't like watching me solo stuff. Never have. Whip out other weapons so I don't one shot anything with other people around unless the cleaning up would be beneficial. Always a little sad because I really worked on my character. Character creation, CAMP, build, outfits. Feel like most of the random trades I've accepted and had nothing offered were people just checking me. Shit yall if I could wear an ID badge I would.
---
You know chems dont stack right, can only have one active at a time.
---
Can confirm there is a visual bug on the damage screen with explosive cryolator a that have the crystallizing barrel attached. Comparison below. 
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/G6u2pst
---
For some reason the ballistic damage doesn‚Äôt show, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it scales with demo expert nonetheless. And even if it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs damage is still respectable enough that it‚Äôs unusable for most enemies. At least for me
---
I don't even know why they are afraid to die,  Just don't bring any junk with you. If you die respawn and jump back into the fight.
---
Word
---
At one time the changlog said it fixed drops and this is what we get. Smh 
---
would you make a thread asking if hong kong phooey could beat goku in a fight? i'm trying to be realistic here, easy pete is OP
---
&gt;It seems super slow and does basically equal dps as the minigun
---
So what you're saying is it wastes less bullets? And that's bad? Somehow? The fuck?
---
All hail the Emperor! 
---
Yeah, they didn't put it in the patch notes, but the fusion core and PA repair were linked,  i think. 
---
I've found that on occasion the "scrounger" perk will come up with fusion cores in ammo boxes when searched.  This being because they are used as ammo for some weapons as well.
---
I think they tried to speed it up and accidently broke it.
---
Anybody else not bothered to even go to Morgantown in 50+ levels? 
---
You can still get the handmade plans at 43
---
Happened to me on ps4 pro. Had to close out completely to fix it.
---
Actually there is consistency once you get to know the areas that have caps on levels.  From what I have seen the Forest is safe and decent until you get into the 20's.  The Ash Heap is also pretty much hard capped at 40's from what I have seen.  Savage Divide, Cranberry Bog, and The mire have scaling from like level 15 to 68.  Which, once you get to the higher levels 45+ becomes the opposite problem.  You're trying to do content to do quests or just kill and loot but some low level recently passed by causing everything to spawn at level 15 when you just want to kill level 50+ legendary creatures...  
---
My suggestion to lower level people (which includes when I level up other characters btw) is to stick to the forest until the mid 20's, then head to the ashe heap, then do the main story like once you get into the upper 30's.  Once you hit the upper 30's or 40's the max level creatures are totally manageable.  Also note, having the crazy run for your life encounters are MUCH more fun than being able to relatively easily kill whatever.  This is mostly a problem if you tank build your character with lots of defensive perks and wear power armor all the time.  To keep the game fun, I made characters which eschew power armor for normal armor or just the mistress of mysteries armor...  It's more fun when you can't just stand in the middle of a swarm of enemies and let your max level x-01 power armor with medical mod + 100+ stem packs make you pretty much unkillable outside of truly insane mobs of monsters with you just letting them beat you to death...  (which is mostly only with ghouls thanks to the rad damage making it so you could end up below 50% due to rads...)
---
for me it depends on where my camp is. i had no turrets and no attacks when i was built just across the road from harper‚Äôs ferry, but when i was in cranberry bog just southeast of watoga shopping center i had like 8 turrets and had a scorchbeast problem. currently i‚Äôm north of new gad and i have two turrets mostly to alert me when there‚Äôs enemies to be killed, since they‚Äôre all mostly level 5 or below i normally wouldn‚Äôt bother but i have these unwelcome guests rather frequently. 
---
Ahhh that‚Äôs useful I think I have that perk will try that out 
---
Still none, but I did get a power armor paint, some pipboy skins, portraits and camp stuff from ingame rewards. 
---
Only works if they have area on too, as far as I've seen most don't have area on. (I personally don't normally.)
---
Or you could just not buy a duped TSE?
---
Why get an endgame gun and then moan when it is too powerful for anything else?
---
If I'm rocking my TSE I'm not looking for a challenge. I'm looking to kill enemies as quick as I can with as little ammo used as possible. If I want a challenge I won't be wearing over repaired power armour and carrying a gattling gun. Duh. 
---
Yeah. 
---
I have an explosive nocturnal dragon. I'll pull it out to go bounty hunting but that reload and the ammo weight make it useless for most other tasks. 
---
Why not allow the vendor to talk to multiple people? lol
---
Not really, I tried it a lot this weekend by attempting to gift nuke cards and ore to level 15 to 35 players and most just stood there looking at me then ran away. I tried both shooting the bag with a laser and smacking it with a ski.
---
The asset is there since it was a paid add-on for FO4. You'll probably see it again eventually.
---
This, exactly.  In FO3, there was a train in the Broken Steel DLC.  The game engine doesn't having moving vehicles very well, so Bethesda cheated, and made the train a **hat you wore during the trip**.  They just adjusted the camera so you saw the "interior" of the train car.  
---
That's right, you didn't *ride* in the train, you *wore* the train.
---
https://www.geek.com/games/a-train-you-ride-in-fallout-3-is-actually-an-npc-wearing-a-train-hat-1628532/
---
I think he left out that his base was next to the whitesprings clubhouse, so the nuke was going there anyway.  And i bet there was also a bunch of turrets on it =P
---
What you said is interesting to me, because I've been considering going down in luck and going away with the critical perks in favour of some more armor boosting perks, I don't know if it would lower DPS, mainly against the queen or big enemies where you can crit them multiple times over and over.

I have been recommended as well to switch out four leaf clover for critical savvy? I haven't looked into the differences between the cards but doesn't critical savvy make criticals take less of the bar? So it would be recharging more often Vs draining slower but haven't tested it. The fella says you can do a critical every other shot with savvy, so it might be worth it. The critical spam seems worth it for my build as I use eagle eyes and better criticals, it is just counter intuitive to use up my ap and leave myself vulnerable.
---
Been getting that for a while now
---
In other news, dupers would love this feature.
---
As much as I would love to see this feature, I vote against this feature until all the desync duping methods are fixed.
---
Unusable or usable? I've lost you in the last part. xD
---
Yep, one of about 10 different things that can spawn in locations like that.
---
I am a simple human with a large amount of cash, when the poor whine I spend.  Now get back to the mines, and make me more money.   
---
In all seriousness I will spend MY money how I please and you can rightly fuck off for telling me otherwise. If you want to boycott that is fine go start a blog about it. Maybe you can get some of that money from a go fund me and hold a demonstration outside of their headquarters. No go back to class. 
---
The same person responsible for the BOS "DMV" mission at a guess.
---
Option B is incompetence which, looking at the attrocious state of the game and just how lazy/ill thought out it is (but still enjoyable to a degree), is probably the actual reason. Oh - no Beta testing either. They simple didn't play their own game or riddle me this - at the BOS mansion house (Fort Defiance?), why can't you walk up the steps to the front door and instead, have to jump over them? 
---
This means nobody at Bethesda play tested that mission. If they did, they couldn't be arsed to fix it. I don't know which is worse....
---
The problem with banning dupers is its going to be a large portion of their player base. When the artillery worked I didn't know any one that didn't abuse it. 
---
The game's mechanics just make it entirely unfun to play for a lot of people that were looking for the FO online experience without all the survival mechanics constantly dragging it down. Survival mode was fun for a very specific way of playing the game, but it did not work to fully embrace FO4 mechanics. 
---
Who said anything about buying duped weapons?
---
This is true on the flip side. I was quick to hit level 100 from the BETA to just days after the game released on PS4. Lower level players have always been afraid of me. I remember entering the baseball field to give someone some plans I didn't need. He removed all his STASH boxes (not realizing I can't access his STASH) and wouldn't approach me. He even got on the mic saying, "Take whatever you want but I have friends coming to kick your ass." Not sure if he found the bag. I decided to stick to the Mire since then.
---
Stopped leveling around 170 for weeks. Only recently have I hit 230 and now many players are close in level or even past me. Even still, lower level players are terrified or see it as a personal challenge to try and kill me. I don't one shot my event mobs if others are around. I never lock my doors or workstations. I really couldn't tell you anything about the Forest but I know the Bog and the Mire like a father knows a thermostat.
---
Good point with the 50. Cal even though I still think the gg wins by a hair. Also, I wasn‚Äôt even considering Legendary effects when I posted my comment. TSE minigun is stupid op and doesn‚Äôt count lol
---
I didnt know there was an anti material rifle in fo4? 
---
Other than reskinning the weapon, what exactly does that do?
---
Why are they drip-feeding us the marine helmet? Should‚Äôve just added it to the game already. The other stuff, understandable.
---
It's fixed slots, but the big problem is that it's random, and there's no way to alter these things.
---
So, for a weapon, for example, if you want a specific prefix, it's 1 out of 23 possible variants. If you want a specific primary stat, it'll be 1 in 7 possible varaints. And if you want a specific secondary stat, it'll be 1 in 9 (iirc?) possible variants. So if you want a 2-shot explosive 90% weight reduction gun (ANY gun, including pipe guns), it's 1/23*1/7*1/9=1 in 1449 chance. If you want this to be a specific gun, like Handmade, the odds of that are even worse. 
---
So, say you want 10% damage resist if mutated, strength +1, and reduce weight on all 5 pieces of your armor, and you don't even care what kind of armor this is (Leather, Metal, Marine, etc.) That's 1/23*1/10*1/12=1 in 2760. PER PIECE. You will need, roughly 13,800 legendary drops to have a half-decent chance of getting a full set like this. And realistically, you'll need WAY more than that to get a set like this. 
---
Which is why most intelligent developers will give you some leeway. For example, the traits on gear in Elder Scrolls Online is random, BUT you can go to a transmutation station and change it to something specific you want. In The Division, you go to recalibration station, and reroll a specific talent on the gear if that you don't like. It costs each time you reroll, and it's still RNG, but you're typically fishing for 1 in 8, not 1 in 1,500! In Diablo 3 we had reforging. And so on, and so forth. Heck, back in '09 Borderlands proved that pure RNG is bad. How? The game had 17,500,000 guns, which sounds good in theory, but in practice it means 17,499,001 crap guns, and 999 good ones. So your odds of getting a good gun was 999 in 17,499,001, or 1 in 17,500. Which made the game pretty pointless, because you could play it for years and still not get a good gun. 
---
This game's itemization is **AWFUL**. Completely and utterly awful. 
---
Let's say some crazy person actually played the game 8 hours every day. It would take 950 days (or 2.6 years) to get complete this challenge. Even if you left the game running 24/7, and never logged off, it would take 317 days.
---
You could count Prototype aswell
---
i would move near water and go for a better purifier. the problem doesn‚Äôt completely go away but it‚Äôs much much less of an issue. i usually build in water with two industrial purifiers and usually i come back to camp and am able to collect 10 purified water. 
---
Most of those only spawn when she's airborne, and if people can't handle or evade even one of her trash mobs long enough to walk outside and help kill her that kinda proves the point of this overall complaint.
---
That's true. Can't get it back once you paint over it on that set.
---
You sound upset
---
Their servers are amazon cloud service so as long as the contract holds they'll be up, but I hear you. I just want to have a reason to tell my friends to come log back in since we've all been done with quests and our characters for about a month now.
---
I miss my Giddyup Buttercup collection.  And I'd definitely be hording teddy bears if we could decorate with them.
---
I don't have quad lar but I'd probably end up reloading about 7 shots in
---
Awwwwwwwww yeeeeaaaahhhh!
---
This isn't directed at people who bought these, it's for the people who are planning to exploit it. This is also a post by a guy literally named EXPLO1T.
---
I check every game I log on to. It's my ritual. Nevermind anywhere near 7 though. Highest I've had is 3 from that one room.
---
Mr. 5X5 of course!
---
We need a responder paint job
---
I‚Äôve given up on ES6. Especially since news came out it was gonna still be on the same engine. I don‚Äôt care how good the story is or how charming the world is, I want a new game, not Skyrim 2 unfinished boogaloo
---
I was hoping for the repair kits when I saw durability was going to apply again. I was very sad to see it wasn't. It's basically a stimpack for your weapon! I also loved the ability to use weapons of the same type to repair eachother, it made using only one or two weapons for extended periods viable, plus in real life guns don't break anywhere close to how they do in game, I could see with the buttstock bashing and pistol whipping, but these guns are meant to fire the rounds they do, except pipe weapons, and would not wear down like that.
---
If you walk the main road that runs E-W in the Ash Heap, there are like 7 different power armor spawn points with frames that will have cores in them unless somebody has already looted them. Thats' probably the easiest concentration of them- just hit PA spawns.
---
I hear you. I'm still trying to get geared up for whatever content rolls out. That and working on the camp with randomly exploring is mostly what's left
---
They should've just gone back to traditional skill tree with option to respec every ten levels after 50 if you want. You can still add perks and people can adapt their play style if decide to. 
---
Regardless of his ability to do everything he says, why the need to attack poeple are trying to be helpful?  If he see's bad information,  then help out and add to the thread.  
---
There's no telling how much time you spent making the OP, not to mention responding, and updating, and 99.9% of us appreciate it.
---
I'm going to check the locations for plans, and do some looting at the same time, I'll try to update with what i find.
---
Thanks ConfusedSwitch:)
---
I just take a seat and wait my turn.  Forced RP'ing ain't that bad.
---
Adding that many extra ID's to the game would be too taxing on the system to keep track of.
---
Too drastic. Bobble heads need patching so that they won't stack, and the duped items can be fixed by introducing 4 star legendaries that go up to level 60 or 70. 
---
Lack of communication is a problem. I don't think you should be able to mute other player's area voice chat by default. Make it easier to mute individuals, but force audibility by default. 
---
I've tried to tell people useful things so many times and it's clear they can't hear me. 
---
A name on an account = deserving of my vitriol, telling him he has no hope, and questioning his publicly kind intentions because he is instead a BAD person. I know this because of his name. I'm good with people see, I know who deserves to be treated like shit from my feelies in my tummy. I'm a big boy with good good reasoning skills, very socially aware of my actions and how they affect those around me! A real people person I am.
---
Just killed the queen with my first alt. A reset would not be so bad, did it to myself for fun after all
---
Thanks. Meant for satire purposes. appreciate the look 
---
I want to cry.
---
Once, in atomic shop were a blackbird paint for PA.
---
The best one, in my opinion.
---
But for 1800 atoms.
---
And it was avaible only for a few hours.
---
W H Y.
---
I just give duped stuff out for free, who cares at this point. If giving people stuff makes them happy and it helps them actually enjoy the game while it still lasts- I just like to help. 
---
Jesus that scared me. I was thinking what if my TSE shotgun was duped...  but than i thought i dont have a TSE and i am only level 12. 
---
Am I the only one who has to build their camp from scratch every-time they relocate out of necessity?
---
For any number of reasons my meagrely spaced house never seems to wanna fit. 
---
What is your account name?  I'll have my buddy show you a few, make sure you are recording because you'll only be able to see some of this once if you know what I mean ;)
---
Nice straw man. Try again.
---
Then why are you saving your atoms to buy those items of they ever come about?
---
What's overheal? I got a legendary ripper the other day but sold it cos it just did too little too slowly to seem worthwhile. 
---
I love the photo mode. I have like 8 dope album covers. It's amazing 
---
Gotcha but if yours is on area broadcast 
---
You‚Äôre telling them the loot you just dropped is theirs.
---
You don‚Äôt need a response from them for message acknowledgment.
---
Yeah I invest bare minimum in WS because of this stuff. I know it's only a matter of time before I DC so I'm not using a bunch of supplies for nothing
---
Sure, but it's a good PSA to people who might have any of these items and not know they shouldn't 
---
Won't happen, but even if it did I'd be okay with it honestly.
---
That's debatable since the game makes it exceedingly easy to log off and switch servers to avoid it.  It was fun for about a day for me, but got old quick.
---
Even if say someone did, not all those people are youtubers, and some may have lost so much faith in Bethesda for ignoring reported dupes long prior to them becoming youtube famous that they are just not bothering anymore and keeping it all to themselves. It's not like you can lag yourself through the world in a loop to land in a room(s) or anything hypothetically...geez.
---
Ah will have a look on the map for that thanks 
---
Fuck that.  Treating them like special fucking snowflakes is the reason we're at this point in the first place. You wanna play goodie goodie, go back to the scouts.
---
Obviously a sniper pvp build comes without PA, but I do carry PA with me in case it comes in handy, like in nuke zones. You also want a chameleon armor piece or the mutation. Just minutes ago I took the sniper perk card that I'm eager to try, but before that I used the mod 'stabilized' on my arms and it made my aim super stable. Here's my sniper build [http://prntscr.com/m82h0w](http://prntscr.com/m82h0w) and here's my PA build for sniper [http://prntscr.com/m82jwd](http://prntscr.com/m82jwd). And here the mutations: [http://prntscr.com/m82kho](http://prntscr.com/m82kho)
---
I think a low health build like VerballyInsultingBot suggests would be better though.
---
I go back here all the time. It's a good place to replenish healing chems if you have the Pharma Farma perk.
---
Staw man implies that I made something up... you defended censorship. Try again.
---
You can really see the spread if you ever use a TS fat man.
---
look for more of those robots flying around. That's how you get them, or buy them if a vendor has it.
---
This sub complains about TSE/dupers because it is an important issue, but also has useless shit such as ‚Äúdear Bethesda‚Äù or I want X feature in the game. The made up stuff is misting r/gaming and r/fallout coming in here and spreading false info 
---
Charleston Capitol building has 2 fusion generators. Alternatively you can make them at chem benches if you have the flux and supplies. Not as efficient as simply picking them up from the plant shop but still works.
---
Shh...
---
If you do the daily challenges and as many of the weekly you care to get in, you don't need to buy any atoms.
---
I am having a blast going around and whacking robots with my people need jobs protest sign for the weekly challenge I think I'll get 20 atoms for whacking 50 robots. I finished all the dailies this morning and got 60
---
So, Hotrod had flames? I missed that one. Was it just for US market, or did Europe get it too?
---
That's just how daily quests are. They should call them "session quests". Misc quests have a similar problem. Some of those switch quest locations on each session. I've paid to fast travel to a place for a misc quest so many times and gotten disconnected  before completing it, only to log back on and find the quest moved to another map location.
---
I've noticed this as well and it's definitely new as of the recent patch. If I had to to guess it's been an intended feature that they just got working for some reason with diseased enemies risking disease and glowing ones giving off rads. 
---
What would be?  Two-Shot+Anti-Armor+Weight Redux?
---
two months of progress and I'm fine with it. "Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee."

Doesn't that get you a bounty?

Not a rapist just a fuckboy. His ‚ÄúPrison‚Äù is marriage, his ‚Äúcell mate‚Äù is his wife. The second song continues his story.

He‚Äôs just a crazy fuckboy who can‚Äôt keep it in his pants

Also checking the vendor bots for their plans and mods. 
---
8m also on my 3rd alt. My main is 110. 
---
I killed a legendary that dropped a normal syringer 
---
I know, right?  they might sell a decent legendary.
---
My luck frankly sucks so all of my best legendaries are vendor bought, sadly enough.
---
I've got like 3. You don't need the quest or whatever. Just shoot it down when you see it 
---
&gt;It's annoying to see youtubers criticize Bethesda for this particular move.
---
Anything for a reason to make another video.
---
Also, if they remove the exploiters and dupers, that takes another thing for them to bitch about.
---
top 10 anime battles

I went to claim a workshop and DC'd
---
Took my caps anyway, though. Thanks Bethesda
---
So much work in to something? you do realize this is the same engine as FO4 with 95% of the textures copy and pasted from FO4 right?
---
Sounds like the old Skyrim backwards dragon glitch. Bethesda really can't do flying creatures, can they?
---
I'd be on that in an instant.  The endgame (and pretty much any other interaction with other human beings) just isn't fun right now.  I'd seriously rather choose elective dental surgery over wading into a nuke zone at this point.
---
I've been continuing to play the game sporadically as effectively a single player, doing new runs with low level characters and trying different build styles and perk strategies.   But all that ends once the tarmac runs out and you end up in Watoga or Whitespring farming legendaries and dealing with all the senseless drama and cheating.
---
I started a fact and made no attempt to defend anything. 
---
All markets, 1 day atomic sale :(
---
Make sure to only wear the harness and a cop hat with it to really show off your kink
---
Whoops, sorry for the misinformation.  I am a pack rat and kept the sword.
---
Adding a display case for our camps to show off these quest rewards would be nice.
---
150. I sit patiently on a bench nearby and fuss at people cutting in line at Watoga.
---
&gt;Only people who's free speech they disagree with
---
What specific free speech are you talking about?
---
Do you have any exact examples?
---
It was a paid Creation Club mod from Bethesda, like the junk shotgun or BFG-9000 or the plasma thing. Never bought the A-M rifle, but the other guns pretty much sucked, IMO.
---
You can start a new cargo bot mission from the same terminal that you started the first one at. Whitesprings bunker military wing.
---
As others have said, the Atom Shop. I was skeptical at first, but since I had a few K of atom just sitting around from challenges I bit. Glad I did. Because not only did I get a snazzy hot rod paint job for my X01, but I also now have an atom indicator next to that PA. So I can easily identify my Excavator from my X01 in menu's.
---
Harper's Ferry isn't so bad once you're familar with the layout. It's a lot easier going when it's scorched instead of super mutants (one option might have been to server hop to get scorched instead of super mutants) but even then you've got to pace yourself. 
---
Mid 20's sound painful, once you hit mid 30 low 40's it should be a lot more manageable. I usually hit up the vendor there on my sell run. hitting up the display cases for marine armor plans.
---
It's like the disease aura mutation effect, I think it wasn't working before.
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôll struggle for materials in all fairness thanks for the info though 
---
Go back to the Enclave bunker. One of the terminals will locate another drone for you to shoot down.
---
Latest videos show a reduction to radiation, bonus to exp, damage, health regen. From what I understand there are videos of the actual animations, so I'm guess they will be implemented.
---
Is it only the legendary ones? That's a relief. I hadn't noticed and thought it just happened randomly
---
Jefe was the chosen juan
---
It‚Äôs a balancing mechanic I‚Äôd wager. Ammo is too plentiful to sell and integrate into a working economy. Having to pay to fast travel is also a cap sink, also to balance the economy. It‚Äôs probably also the reason the merchants only have 200 caps.
---
Go to the control room in the enclave and request a nuclear keycard from the computer.  It gives you the exact location of the cargobot you have to shoot down

Thanking a tone deaf company making money hungry power moves on their loyal community.

In the room before the whiteapring bunker vendor, there is a red pc. Enter it and click enter on the first line. They you get a quest, where you can see the flying robot on your map.
---
Kill it, open the crate, take the card.
---
Relog and change server and repeat.
---
Yea, now Bethesda can go back to selling items from previous games ion the AS! :D
---
Yeah, look up the dudes who got banned for life for joking around with each other and saying they were "hunting gays". It isn't "politically correct" but it is free speech.
---
U finding your stash crashes your game? I had similar where wood armour had weapon stats and I used to crash out when using stash. 
---
Why does this work while enforcer doesn't?

Dam.....must have been on a day I was not on.....sad now.
---
I‚Äôm level 100 and nobody has ever done this to me.

Closest was some asshole at Harpers ferry peppering me with a TSE while I was in the vendor. 
---
I just left, circled back...and collapsed his skull with a broadsider 
---
Same here. Error code ce-34878-0. Literally stuck in Whitesprings and I can't get out. Overburdened can't fast travel away. Crashes before I can dump the weight.
---
So far I rebuilt the Database. Now I deleted and am reinstalling the game. 
---
This may be the last straw. I'll go play MHW or something that isn't buggy as shit.
---
I know all about that.
---
It wasn't a joke. It was harassment and gay bashing. 
---
Sorry, that not free speech. Also, free speech doesn't apply to a video game.
---
So any other examples?
---
That's how it works.  Legendaries (which the SBQ counts as) will always regenerate to full once they hit 50% HP.  If you can take them *under* that threshold in a single shot, it won't proc, but with something as much health as a SBQ it won't happen.
---
They can enjoy that content when it's their time to
---
Which is dumb.  Why can't you get it back?  It makes no sense.  I guess they need to add the paint job plan for prototype, but you should get that upon receiving the x-01.
---
Damn! Amazing 
---
The main issue right now is damage control for the already duped items, which can only happen after the big game of whack-a-mole that is making every random dupe method impossible.
---
Best way is to find PA spawns and then take the fusion cores out. Even the fusion generators will spawn less now .. just write down all locations where you find a core, pa or generator and go back later in a week to go collect again.
---
I've just found out, there was a 1 day sale of the Hotrod paint in the Atomic shop. 1400 atoms.....
---
Happens on PC, too. It wouldn't be so annoying if it went both ways m, but you can't go up from max to 1
---
I've found random squares of water before, as well as water that just suddenly ends 
---
Serums, maybe? 
---
as you should be!
---
I'm not suggesting it, I really hate the prospect of this happening. I'm a legit player too and don't want to be penalized   because of the few who ruin the game for everyone 
---
It's like their corporate culture wants to pretend NV never happened. I understand why, but if you want to see the cosmetic stuff they're hawking in Atom Shop really move, put a Sunset Sarsaparilla t-shirt in there and stand back.

Complaining about glass cannons being made of glass?

I'd pay atoms for a slideshow of my own screenshots to display at my camp
---
Dismantling is more for the parts. I was thinking selling for lower levels that don't have the perks to make the ammo weigh nothing. 
---
That's a valid point. To clear things up, I specifically mean those people who took the time to cheat their way into the dev room to get these items. They know exactly who they are.
---
I sat at harpers ferry the other day and farmed because people kept spawning there and every enemy also. Helped some low levels but most importantly I got lots of weapons to scrap lol
---
Dealing with the radiation is child's play even with a hazmat suit.  It's really not a deterrent.
---
I hit a person I was "teaming" with (we were coordinating via Discord, but not on an in-game team) by accident during the fight, and he later blew me up with an explosive weapon-- so there is *some* set of conditions under which you can deal damage to other players in a SBQ fight.  I'm just not 100% certain what those are.
---
His female companion was not aware the firearm contained ammunition
---
Have they tested stacking bobbleheads to get 300,000 damage?
---
1% of 300k is still a one shot
---
Makes sense, I like having that timer hidden away too. Logging into WoW to see I've played for 400 days on that specific character makes me die a little on the inside each time.
---
I miss my crippling Sniper Rifle.  I'd hit a few shots from a distance then walk up and use my western revolver .44. 
---
How do you get to 950 pounds of carry weight? Honestly curious.
---
1st. The guy he was saying it to said it didnt bother him, you can watch the video of it and everyone is laughing and having a good time. 2nd Even "gay bashing" is protected free speech. Also, if free speech doesn't apply to video games then why did you even ask what free speech instead if just saying that.?

I just want my NCR ranger mask and helmet

THANK YOU! I have known about this for a minute but for whatever reason could never find it. Thank you for posting this in video form!
---
Yeah my main thing is that I like to carry like 100+ of stims and dogfood and I can only do that with Excavator, the slow movement thing is torture for me lol.
---
The junk extractor outside my house always gives me some
---
Agreed. I don't see any sensible reason for not being able to paint it again.
---
I mean the "legit" players are few and far between, most of you were complicit in enabling these jerks. It's time to go full third impact Evangelion style
---
Oooooooooohhh, I see it now haha. Thanks! 
---
I don't like it. Feels cheap getting diseased just by being close to something, especially when they have things like diseased radroaches spawning a foot away from you when you walk into a room. 
---
Maybe the best and cleverest camp I've seen so far. Definitely have not seen anything close in my travels. I'm not far along enough yet to build a really good camp, but this is definitely inspiring.
---
Nice job!
---
I don't know they are just a general pain in the ass.   I can usually kill one  solo, but it's still a major headache with no reward for the amount of first aid and ammo expended.   I try to avoid the areas where they usually spawn- not because I can't handle them, but because I don't want to.
---
The game doesn‚Äôt save if you force a disconnect. That‚Äôs how people actually duplicate stuff, they drop items then force a disconnect so the stuff will be back in there inventory and there friend can then trade back the dupes. 
---
In theory, there is consistency. In practice, there's not. I specifically mentioned lvl 68 Scorched in Poseidon Station *in the Forest*. That shouldn't be happening. But it did. In Divide, you can get anything from lvl 6 all the way to whatever the max is. And very low-level quests send you to places in Divide, where you may run into these things. There's no hard caps that I'm aware of, because I've seen absolutely obscene spawns in areas where they do not belong. Including a lvl 65 SB in Ash Heap, which spawned lvl 60+ encourage of Scorched land troops.
---
What you mentioned as being a problem later on, when you're 45+, and end up fighting low level critters because a lvl 15 passed by? It's THE SAME PROBLEM! Like I said earlier, take 2 players, one lvl 22, another lvl 220. It is **GUARANTEED** that one of the players (50%!) will be unhappy. Because either a lvl 22 will have to deal with lvl 68 enemies, without getting massive XP for it (because Bethesda nerfed it last year) and getting loot they can't use for 20+ more levels. Or the lvl 220 will be unhappy, because he'll be fighting lvl 15 enemies, and getting loot that is too low level for them, and no XP because they're killing lowbie trash. Think about it. There's NO OTHER POSSIBILITY, 50% of players in this situation will be unhappy! That's how bad the design is. HALF the player base is guaranteed to be unhappy.
---
The only way this sort of works is if you group up, with players of your own level, so that a large percentage of the people on your server, in your area, are your level. Which, theoretically, will spawn level-appropriate enemies with decent XP and loot. But any kind of level discrepancy, or a lowbie wandering by, can wreck that still. 
---
The solution is really super-mega-simple, something Elder Scrolls Online (another ZeniMax game, by the way, same owners) did a few years back, with *massive success*. Everything is scaled to your level, and world loot is instanced to player. Meaning if you are lvl 10, and engage an enemy, enemy to you is lvl 10, gives lvl 10 XP, and drops lvl 10 loot you can actually fucking use! That same enemy, to a lvl 50 player, looks as lvl 50, gives lvl 50 XP, and drops lvl 50 loot that a lvl 50 player can actually fucking use too! And when these two players walk into a room, and see a piece of bread on the table, they each can grab it, and bread (for them) will disappear, and nobody  gets short-changed. As opposed to this game, where someone might clear out all the plastic from Morgantown school, and leave behind relatively high-level enemies, and then a lvl 4 goes there because the early game quest sends him there, and encounters ZERO supplies AND high level enemies which do NOT give good XP AND drop loot he won't be able to use!
---
The system this game implemented is THE absolute worst approach possible. It discourages grouping, it introduces randomness, it punishes any level discrepancy in both directions, it limits toot to first-come-first-served, AND rewards with useless/unusable items. Worst of the worst of the worst.
---
If they can't fix it, I'd honestly be ok with a reboot at this point. 
---
Oh you might be correct...I forget which one it is
---
I've been a strict PA user since I never worried about cores. Now that this "feature" has been fixed are you all going without PA until you get into a sticky situation or a rad area? I dont have any armor aside from PA so I guess I have to have two sets now...which makes the limited inventory and carry weight that much harder..
---
Ughhh YEAH or when you find a gun the same as yours- just repair it real quick on the spot. I miss a lot of features they took away.
---
You don't see an obvious difference in those examples?
---
I came back to my camp last night. It's defended by a single heavy laser turret (level 25) with a good field of fire.
---
My water purifiers were all busted, my plants were all torn up, and about 15% of the structure was destroyed, and two level 3 dogs were chewing on a staircase.
---
I watched for about a minute while the still intact, still powered turret did nothing to the two dogs which were right in it's main search arc, then smashed them, fixed my camp up, and scrapped the darn thing. I'll just live dangerously.
---
&gt;hey'd honestly probably be more useful squadding up with that ally rad removal perk and just sitting in a shed.
---
coming to the event increases the difficulty for everyone. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what type of scorch beasts you were fighting in the past, but that‚Äôs ALWAYS been how scorch beasts have attacked me, non stop bursts of their stupid fucking screaming attacks. The only normal one for me is the queen. Such a broken enemy. 
---
This game sucks. Move on and give your money to companies that actually deserve it
---
They what a consider a rare animal surprisingly .. there is a big chicken on the map, go there and you will find a variety of animals. You will find a tower in the area and animals around, keep server hopping until a chicken spawn. Also along the railway tracks from morgan town to garily mine and further. Just find a spot where animals spawn and then server hop ..
---
Here is another way to find it .. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evusG1A7iyw&amp;t=551s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evusG1A7iyw&amp;t=551s)
---
Took me around 15 server hops to get it find one, it is tedious unless you get lucky. I think I will try the chicken area and see if I have better luck.
---
&gt;Let me know your favorite spots to farm for screws and springs. 
---
So I have to compete!?  No way...
---
And what happens when a new exploit comes out huh? You want to reset us AGAIN? Ive put 450 hours into this character to get to the point I‚Äôm at, and i have a whole squad who has done the same, if we get reset, im just gonna quit playing and wait for personal servers and mods
---
Ew. Floating houses are the worst
---
Weird flex but ok. I feel like you completely missed the point of my post. I have tons of atoms saved up and I'm waiting on something worth buying, but we keep getting silly stuff I don't care about. Hence the rant.
---
lol.  We really try hard not to bail on conflicts.  Just before this I lured a lvl 81 deathclaw into the thunder mountain power plant area which was covered in turrets.  I hid in a tent and took pot shots at the beast to keep him in the line of fire.  The turrets did the work for me :)  However, that Harpers Ferry shit was ridiculous.
---
I get it, but i run rank 2 pharma and usually have to sell excess chems every few days just to keep the weight down without farming a specific area.. That thing ***works*****.**
---
I wish I had more thumbs to up you give. Sure, let's go with that.
---
surprisingly I've never had an issue like what you're describing. Mine is immediate, as soon as my character appears on the screen it says "you have been disconnected from the server" or whatever. There is no time for me to bring up my pipboy there is nothing, like i said in the op I tried for an hour or so last night so I don't know how many servers that was, but they were all the same outcome.  I'm waiting to see if it's on my end with my ISP before I jump to conclusion but yeah. . . I just wanted to see if other people were having this issue.
---
Thanks for your response.
---
There are several locations in the world that you can visit every 24 hours to pick up 15-20 scrap ballistic material (military duct tape and ammo bags laying all over). I usually hit two of these spots every log on to find one location that spawned the stuff. Use the perk card for reducing armor wear that also reduced repair costs and you'll end up with enough ballistic scrap that you'll be selling the surplus for caps.
---
Like I said, I know all about it. I watched the video. I read all about it. 
---
Wrong, gay bashing isn't protected speech. Sorry, you are wrong. It falls under hate crime laws. 
---
You also clearly don't know what free speech is about. 
---
I didn't ask what is free speech is. I asked you for examples of when someone was banned because of their free speech. 
---
You are wrong, and need to shut up, because people like you put out this kind of bullshit statement, and others think you might be right.
---
Whitesprings has a few buildings with fans and toy cars for a decent amount.
---
The Charleston DMV building also has a decent number of typewriters and desk fans. 
---
I've had 2x two shot drop, a bolt action pipe &amp; last night a 44 pistol.
---
Haven't used the pistol, not spec'd for it, but the bolt action has been a good bit of a kit for many levels now. It's a level 20 &amp; I can one-shot a mass majority of enemies with it from stealth. Has quite a massive range as well. 
---
It is worthless in VATS however, and I see that exact v pattern bs happening. 
---
Thank you 
---
I‚Äôve come across maybe 4 total *normal* ones
---
I travelled IRL for a while after release, so I only made it to level 15 or so and decided to remake when I got home (This was 3 days ago, I'm still only level 6). I was dreading the leveling process because I knew everyone was going to be much higher level than I was and assumed I'd get griefed or at the very least excluded from events. I do get ignored a lot, but the majority of players I've run into have been very welcoming and helpful. I even had one (level 88) run across me in Flatwoods, use "follow me" to take me off way further than I'd ever been and protect me while I discovered a bunch of new locations. This will certainly make exploring and leveling way easier. Shoutout to whoever that was!  
---
There was a thread on the front page yesterday about the surprising lack of toxicity a player had encountered, and one subthread theorized that there's a huge difference in the community depending on what platform you play on. I don't want to add to the potential misrepresentation of friendly players, so I won't get specific, but it is an interesting idea.
---
6 times.
---
Does anyone have a video of anyone being one shot with pacifist on? This is fake news...
---
I've never been in a position where it was in any way advantageous for me to try to kill one. The rewards are not even remotely worth the ammo/stims spent taking one down. If I can't get away from one I'll just jump servers. After having the satisfaction of killing one, it's not really worth the headache of doing it again.
---
I've had several issues since the new update.
---
Firstly, while there are certainly times that the game has become more stable (as advertised), and my friends who crashed frequently no longer do (also as advertised), the game has become almost unplayable for me.
---
I crash several minutes after loading in, and crash upon subsequently loading the game. On the occasion I *don't* crash immediately after loading the game, I'm totally unable to move, shoot, open the pip-boy, etc. 
---
I've tried clearing my cache, and am currently in the process of reinstalling the game. Hopefully that fixes it. 
---
PS4 Pro, PSN: Cupusnaku
---
I've been to bunkers in the mire, and do recall a mention. It also lead me to...well, it was an interesting interaction after I found signal sources.
---
May have to take another look.
---
No
---
The logic just can't be reasonably blanketed across the player base purely based on stack numbers. Too high a threshold, every duper gets a nice tidy still sellable stack of stuff. Too low a threshold, potential innocent people get caught in the crosshair that aren't nearly as in tune with the social media presence of the game, and for whatever reason what they believed to be theirs legitimately is wiped. One case going very poorly could start a PR bonfire out of the dumpster fire already happening. Working their way down to what they're comfortable taking action on is a bigger ask than you think.
---
The dev room items are like doing game maintenance in a vacuum. Lower volume of players, clear intent, static items, etc.
---
The next throws in random variables that come back to community opinion,  player enjoyment, and future revenue streams. I guarantee the meetings for how they should approach the duping issue have a WHOLE lot more big heads than whatever came together for the dev room. The risks and impacts from a dupe fix are much, much higher.
---
Also, id love triangle foundations and floors which can allow for some octagon/circular shaped builds.  
---
Noticed this as well when trying to sell stuff. Please fix this it's super annoying!
---
Thank you I‚Äôll do it now 
---
Ammo consumption of a heavy automatic vs a semi auto Handmade I guess. Plus I already have the TSE Handmade and no heavy weapon. Working with what I have really.
---
Are you asking if it doesn't work or why tormentor over enforcer? Cause it does work for me, based on the mongrels I've just shot.
---
Honestly, I forgot about enforcer, that should work, although Tormentor has the range benefit. I only use it to get the SB out of the air and harmless, after that it's melee until it regens the limbs. Rinse and repeat. 
---
I had mentats do the same thing
---
Where did you find the brick wall plans? Ive been searching forever. The house looks amazing btw, i may take some insperation from you to use on my shop/diner!

Oh yes, it does work very well.

Well, that would explain it. Thanks!

Replying so I can load this up in Nukes &amp; Dragons later. Thanks for sharing, looks great!
---
I was killed by a bunch of invisible ghouls post-patch.  You're not any more safe than you were before.
---
Thanks. 
---
You may be right and I only get X/hr for all purifiers put together, but their inventory is separate, which means I come home to 15 water instead of just 5. Which isn't a big deal I guess but it's something. But I'm not really sure either way. They don't take up much budget though, unlike the turret, and I've got power to spare with the fusion generator.
---
Yep, wait til 50 to do mayor for a day to get the robots off your ass. Run like hell until then.
---
Fireproof is your friend. That plus Dense armor or PA will make their blasts tickle. They still won't be fun, but you can laugh off their sonic attacks.
---
You can double up walls by placing door frames each way then replacing them for walls. I do this and it works wonders.
---
I would love a Vampire Drill 
---
Nah they won't, they will lose there player base over night, it will never happen trust me.
---
If it would fix it once and for all maybe, but it won't, so there is really no point in doing it. What they could do instead is maybe delete all the explosive guns and do a reset just on those, but that would miss off a few minority who legitmatlly found one or bought one without knowing, but I doubt even that would happen.
---
They need to start fixing the bugs and nerfing certain weapons and finding ways to stop people ruining the game for everyone else like a proper passive mode.
---
I have Vault Tech and Camo, but that Hotrod looks good.
---
Well what I suggest would stop a lot of duping.

Is this still bugged?
---
yup, most commonly occurs when I try to cook.
---
&gt;Since everyone is coming up with convoluted ideas on how to stop duping and diluting the FO Community here is my idea.
---
Continues to say a convoluted idea on how to stop duping as well as diluting the FO community.
---
So we just make it so friends who play coop, or anyone for that matter, just can't trade? In a loot based game?
---
I don't want a reset let alone if any other exploit gets us a further reset. I also play no man's sky and anyone who knows that game we've had a universe reset with each new update. Every thing including player discoveries GONE. 
---
The community just gets on with it and rebuilds

are you telling me they‚Äôre fire based attacks?

I did a bunch of experiments with this a while back. Here are the results:

shit, sorry wrong subreddit.... derp

Get the hard bargain perk cards and it's about 200 per bundle if you happen to run out of it, and you get a ton for selling it if you collect more of it than you use.
---
If easy pete is too powerful then you fallout 76 players can't  handle hard pete

I never said it was bad. I'm literally asking what the benefits are. And I'm actually learning a lot thanks to people who give constructive answers.
---
What?! It is not illegal to say anything at all about gays. All speech in the US at least is protected except speech that is inciting immediate violence hence why even the KKK is legally allowed to have public rallies so long as they get a permit and time slot for what ever venue they plan to attend. If it were illegal then those dumb asses at the West Burrow Baptist Church wouldn't be allowed to say all gays are going to hell and then stand right outside of children's funerals with signs saying it was God's punishment for people accepting gays into the community. YOU ARE WRONG. I can name a million and half examples of people legally "bashing gays". I dont agree with it but the only speech that is not protected is speech inciting immediate violence. Stop talking out of your ass. You are the one spreading misinformation.
---
Pssh, that‚Äôs a quitters mindset lol

Why isnt 3 stars a guaranteed for 2 star reward? It makes no sense.

This just started happening to me about a week ago.

That request is great until you find out the hard way the server literally shit the bed and can no longer be found.
---
Had this happen 2 times so far.

Vote for Gatling
---
I think more people should also start nuking prime far enough west so that people can fight the SBQ from the military base outside of the blast zone.  Us non-PA users really appreciate that.
---
I read a post last week where someone suggested using one of Four Leaf Clover or Critical Savvy in a max/high luck vats build, but using both was overkill. Critical Savvy at max ranks saves 55% of your critical bar, lessening the need for Four Leaf Clover to refill the crit bar since you'll have it back quite quickly anyways. I was using both and took Four Leaf Clover off in favour of Serendipity and havent noticed a big difference in my critical's or dps.. but it likely warrants more testing. I think where you're build is going to out dps mine right now is with more intelligence so having more explosive damage + nerd rage.. 
---
This was going to be my response as well as this would make player bending unusable. But before I got to post you already chimed in. 
---
Sugar Grove. Clipboards and desk fans galore. 
---
I mean, clearing out some "dungeons" wandering the waste collecting junk and, ammo, and weapons to sell or use for crafting. Pretty simple actually. I mean my carry limit is like 430 or something so. . I just collect stuff. It's how I've always played  fallouts 4. I mean obviously there was not a stash limit in fallout 4 but  yeah. . 
---
If there was no trading, then players could drop the items. (Unless you mean that the item would be tied to the original's account) Of course the Fo76 community (Most of them at least) would like to have duping fixed, but if Bethesda were to remove trading armor and weapons I'm sure players would be outraged and it would just fuel the anger more.
---
Agreed.  
---
They should cost zero points. The inability to make perk loadouts is time consuming. Imagine having a 2hd/rifle and then switching to a 2hd/shotgun build when enemies get close.
---
wait, that works? :S
---
Sounds like it would be but it isn't. I'm the add custodian most of the time as other people with decent gear tunnel vision. I'm constantly having to save someones life in the corner of my vision because they think strafing is all they need to do to get the enemy off of them, oh, and the 3 behind them they aren't even noticing.
---
I mean, I'm kinda fine with it because I run Adrenaline. Knowing I just stacked the fuck out of it and made someone floundering have a moment to breathe is cool. Honestly prefer a group with everyone contributing and just picking off my adrenaline procs from the horde gathering on our melee. 
---
Yes, but it does require you wear the dress which replaces your armor to equip the eye of ra.    
---
I'm 90% sure you are right, they changed it so you are only supposed to be able to have one at a time. 
---
How are your nuka grenades doing 1200 damage? I have explosives 5 and mine only do 600
---
I feel you there. Not a single doubleshot with explosive has crossed my path. 
---
The legendaries I have on my high lvl rifle/heal build is a quad gauss (20 shot clip), quad assault rifle (80 shot clip), vampiric tesla, and vampiric shishkabob. 
---
On my lower level (lvl 44) pistol/healer build I came across a level 50 explosive single action revolver. Not doubleshot but hey should be fun testing it out.
---
Abso fucking lutely. No trading in a co op gaming. Does it suck? Yeah but guess what? Diablo the king of loot based RPG co op has this same method implemented, destiny another loot based co op game that I play doesn‚Äôt let you TRADE ANYTHING. So the world won‚Äôt end and in the long run items will just feel more rare.
---
To add on here. Miniguns i have found hit for 25dmg per bullet. My gatling gun (not legendary) hits for 135. It's a no brainer for me. 
---
100dmg in 4 bullets compared to 540dmg in 4 bullets.
---
Bout the same on ps4
---
I was hoping they‚Äôd add a build bar where you can swap between different perk builds on the fly 
---
How does one acquire a junk extractor?
---
I agree with what you say, with exception to the person that launches the nuke. If a level 10 some one managed to get into the bunker and clear the nuke quest and launched the nuke, by all means camp in the shed mate. 
---
Yeah, love this fountain.  Will fast travel to Whitesprings just to save my disease cures for when I dont' want to fast travel...lol
---
It makes zero sense
---
My camp is a stone's throw from Harper's Ferry, on the opposite side of the water from the bridge. I've been there since level 40-ish.... I'm now level 86. Aside from the Hermit Crab that lives just down the road from me, it's super quiet... and I love Harper's Ferry. It's a quick easy junk run once you know where everything is, and no... it's not always so crazy there. 
---
As multiple people pointed out here in previous posts.... Yes, there is level scaling, but there are also caps to the levels that spawn in an area. The Mire is probably too high level for a 20-something... tread softly.  
---
I have to be honest at this point, I don't run a melee build, so I can't be sure. Certainly with my rifle build the 30+ perception giving me an automatic 95% accuracy at my rifles maximum range is extremely nice, and more valuable than resistance.
---
That said, I can see more 'utility' out of unyielding, but for strict combat, the damage resist is probably more necessary, although people playing bloodied builds optimally (At 20% health) really are better off learning to avoid getting hit entirely, vice relying on their armor to save them.
---
That said, perhaps the 'best' strategy is to have multiple sets of armor for multiple purposes. IF that's your end game, I'd say start with the unyielding since it has other uses as well, such as boosting carrying capacity, decreasing merchant prices, and increasing sales prices, increasing odds of getting mods when scrapping items, increasing cap rewards from group team missions with charisma, also allowing you to share cards with your team even if you have horrible charisma, increasing critical regeneration, and more.
---
It's just 'very' broad use, and so hard to dismiss. It's not that it's better than Vangaurd or Bolstering, because in the proper use case these can work much better in an optimized build, it's just that early on in collecting valuable armor, the 'amount' of things you can do with unyielding armor vastly exceeds the other types.
---
Those are examples of *quests*.
---
I noticed that last time I was in the dmv I‚Äôll have to check it out again thank you!
---
It really reminds me of the hotwheels toys.
---
He walks by my camp *all the time*, to the point where it‚Äôs gotten annoying. If I‚Äôm ever at my camp for more than 10 minutes I‚Äôll suddenly hear a super mutant voice and perk up like ‚Äúoh shit, it‚Äôs on...oh, never mind just Grahm again...‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm sorry in advance for not disclosing the location of my camp, I already get the ‚Äúcould not place camp‚Äù notification about 25% of the time. 
---
That must be a thing with Spruce Knob. I take that place all the time and the turrets are so useless I don't even place them anymore. I just manually defend the place. Just wait till you get a molerat attack there. It's terrible. They get stuck underground and in spots you can't kill them.
---
Report them Bethesda has been banning griefers when reported I‚Äôm sorry that happened 
---
Except I don't want this same mechanic go off on my junk stacks.

Lol welcome to fallout be it white knights or raiders this stuff happens in the wastelands get used to it

The Secret Room in the top of the tallest building in Abandoned Bog Town (get to the roof, jump down the elevator shaft)

Both of those have good springs and screws.

Alternatively you can always visit FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.  People sell springs and screws there for 3 caps each all day every day.
---
About the same or little longer on PS4(feels longer).
---
I guess both, since enforcer doesn't work with my exolosive shotty on normal scorched beasts. But you covered both of them, thanks!
---
Sounds made up, on the off chance it wasn't these are people who are just using current events to troll. The moment I get confronted by anything or anyone weird I immediately just go to menu and switch servers. You should do the same, it really works :P
---
It's just a couple of trolls who claim to be doing stuff for the "greater good".  anytime you see that crap, block them and switch servers
---
Your question involves a false assertion about what I said. Answering that question implies that I have validated that assertion. I'm not going to do that. 
---
If the situation were reversed, I may have asked you a similar question. You support homophobic bullying? That's not what you did though. The question is disingenuous. You falsely asserted a protected right in a setting where that right doesn't apply. I could honestly ask "do you support people being able to say whatever they want on a private platform?" So if you ran a website, would you support people saying anything no matter what, on your website?
---
If you had asked me the same question, I would say no. I don't believe you should be able to say anything you want on a private platform. 
---
&gt;  How have I become this jaded? I totally assumed a players etiquette and altruism based on their level. 
---
You got on reddit
---
Enforcer doesn't?... Confirmation on that? I chase the SBQ around and shoot up. Getting hits and seeing damage fall... Feel like my equipping my shotgun after someone finally gave me ammo as I was out was the only reason she landed 30 seconds later.
---
Same here and I'm sticking with it. Just have to keep a sharp eye on the supply :-)
---
Looking for that on Beth page all day, but no avail until now.
---
Hmmmmm. SPEAK TO THE HAMMER! 
---
The point isn't whether a card is for combat or not, it's how the perk card works to provide you the benefit. Majority of the combat perks require them to be on you at all times to work, with exception of Tank Killer/Glow Sight or Exterminator/Glow Sight, which could change in the future if they decide to implement more enemies of this type. While you can have every single type of card, you don't gain the benefits unless you equip them. Past games allowed you to earn every single perk, eventually, made your character overpowered. This is not a single-player game, this is multiplayer, you need to take game balance into account. 
---
I mentioned in some of the replies here, the perks you choose not only determine the play-style, but also determine the level of difficulty of the game and the game rewards you for doing so with extra card slots. Your standard build will have you proficient in one type of weapon, but if you want to be proficient in multiple weapons, you're going to have to adapt by changing your play-style. So as you rock a sniper rifle, instead of carrying food on you at all times with Thru-Hiker, you going to have satisfy your hunger and thirst at each location you visit to net you 3 slots if you wish to also increase the damage of your shotgun (which I would grab Normal/Expert/Master Shotgunner for 30% instead of upgrading a single card for 20%).
---
I wouldn't call it needless because the method of swapping between cards is saving you multiple free slots which you can use for Conveniency Cards. Think of it this way, you're building for your primary cards (Essential Cards), then building for your secondary cards (Conveniency Cards). Keeping Situational Cards just makes them Conveniency Cards at the expense of wasting slots.
---
Yeah but unless you build +9 charisma, sharing perks is fucked. 
---
That‚Äôs weird, I did one the other day and I never noticed it‚Äôs health going full once it hit 50% maybe it glitched or something.
---
It definitely helps üëç
---
I detest using that conduit that goes through walls, it takes up so much space and it looks horrible. There were simpler mods for fallout 4 that worked the same way but looked better and didnt take up so much space.
---
Anyway, another option is to use a wall with the door/window, and have the cable go through the opening. Then select the wall and when it gives the scrap/store/swap(or whatever its called) option, use swap and swap the wall to the solid one. and the cable will stay connected through the wall.
---
if it aint broke you're not trying - red green
---
Hey, its easier than listening to the community
---
Same goes for fighting Legendary Supermutants and getting a fucking Gamma Gun. Why is it that almost every enemy drops from a loot pool that they don't even have.
---
Crap, I've been immoral too many times.  Gotta go to church :)
---
I don't want trading to stop.  I'm currently looking for better armor and more plans.
---

Lolol, yah I dont mind it, let's me farm whitesprings 5 or 6 more times without getting encumbered.  The way I see it, it's fair trade for the disconnects that rob me of my Junk cause I DC right after a death.
---
Otherwise they already know about this one and fixed it once, but their fix is what caused the excavator armor to give 0 carry weight unless you logged off naked then got back on and equipped it.
---
They rolled it back without saying so, they claimed it was a fix for that when in reality to just reset it to how it was.  And from the fact it's not fixed yet they may not know how to fix it without breaking something else yet.
---
Place your camp somewhere else. All destroyed items will be available fully repaired on the stored tab.

&gt; What a toxic jerk community

Good idea to judge a community of hundreds of thousands of people based on the actions of 3 players.

You can also sell the junk that's unbulkable. Examples include, gold, silver, ultricite, fiberglass, asbestos, crystal, black titanium, screws, etc.

Money is def on pig foot. 
---
No... not wooby. how could they
---
Anything to avoid having to go back to that JCpennys job
---
Some people are just idiots.  I believe you can block them and they can't see you or your camp.  Most people that I have run into so far have been pretty decent.  Sux that you happened to run into a group of morons.  
---
I'm from Sweden and I've not even seen the quest, we don't have a government (yet)
---
I have yet to do the SBQ but I've seen several posts echoing your sentiments about people hiding in the barn/shed. It seems that could be fixed relatively easily by Bethesda by either removing the door to the barn or having adds go in there to attack AFKers. Maybe even add a small AoE tick so people standing in there are forced to either heal or die.
---
It is very far from challenging.  You find tech data, you return it to the smaller bos base.  Along the way you might have to kill 3 or 4 ghouls and another 6 or 7 scorched.
---
Bethesda is not restricted by the first amendment, they are a private company and the game world is their property. They are not the government, the first amendment only prevents the government from limiting speech.
---
Thanks, 1800 atoms = 18 $, maybe it looked amazing, but that was not worth it ! and imagine of much matter you could have IRL with all those real atoms instead ! 
---
ok Yoda, if you can't see a person with the name exploit... (aka Cheating), warning people who have illegal items to drop them being hilariously ironic then I cannot have an intelligent conversation with you.
---
Well my friend already tried what you said. The problem is that it seems to be set in a different game cell, so it is harder to reach on Xbox than PC
---
Quick way to puss off Bethesda: ask for obsidian fallout features. Lol.
---
They shouldn't reset. There should be a option to opt into new servers or old servers. That way people who want to keep everything and play with everyone who may or may not of cheated that cool, and let the people who want nothing to do with any of that make characters on a fresh server.
---
Uhhh you can't drop those. I'm not sure how some gave them to you.
---
You might be bugged and need to start over.
---
Try relogging?
---
I really miss festooning my living space with gnomes and my wife wants to collect one of each kind of teddy bear.
---
Where ya located?
---
That‚Äôs why in my original post I stated they can have the implementation of if thy FOUND the item they can trade it to a friend on the same server but only for 3 hours. And your right but any damage boosting items in that same category.
---
I feel like this is the best method.
---
That is right over the spot I build on.  I was wondering why my camp could not be placed 2 logins ago. 
---
I agree with that statement and it is factual however that doesn't make my 1st comment any less true. They did in fact ban people for having views or in my opinion (a since of humor) that they did not agree with. I dont agree with that. That's all.
---
So next to the dome structure by the golf club house? Your couldn't type that? Had to link to your video? 
---
Because you can buy stuff of a vendor someone else sold to them. you would be able to duplicate items if that wasnt the case. we dealt with this in dayzmod
---
Actually yes in that case you‚Äôve got a good point üëç
---
They were banned for hate speech
---
I was gifted an Atom Cats paint job when I traded for a tse lever action. Guess he was a duper. Meh. I learned them, didn't know they were unobtainable, but haven't used them nor plan to (don't care for the paint job). But I'm slightly worried now. 
---
Tactical does exist, the assault one does not.
---
Today me, tomorrow you 
---
Can confirm this exact item, as I was recently level 40, got disconnected from the server, and logged back in, and boom, back to 39.
---
of course, they don't see it that way immediately but all you re doing is pushing them towards the end of the games progression cycle and atm thats farming for loot. Congratulations, you got them one step closer to being bored with the game and uninstalling. Thanks Helpy helperton.
---
I can‚Äôt remember exactly but I‚Äôm pretty sure they traded them to me because the couldn‚Äôt drop them
---
The Ag Center has a couple of boxes of loose screws near the main entrance's reception desk, and usually some typewriters or phones on the upper floors. Since I usually spend the five minutes to do the event each day to stop the annoying messages, I'll usually clean out the upstairs while I'm at it. 
---
If you've completed the Brotherhood quests - Fort Defiance usually has tons of misc junk, especially if you use the elevator to get to the third floor, clean out that area, and then just go right up to the fourth floor. From there, you can fast travel without having to worry about the enemies on the lower floors. 
---
Even the raider gankers I run into end up being friendly eventually.  Lol
---
Yes - if you're stacking bobbleheads over a known bug - you are just really really lame.  If you're stuck with a single never expiring bobblehead, then its not your problem.  But stop trying to blame lame player behavior on bugs.  Just because someone left their lunch in the fridge unlocked doesn't mean you should just help yourself to it either.
---
And what's to stop dupers happening on the new servers, it'll just happen all over again. Creating new servers won't make this problem go away 
---
Daily reminder? Fuckkkkkkking kill me. 
---
Might be a nice to have, but as people have said, disconnects are mostly from server crashes so there's often little value. Except for one case, which is disconnects from client crashes, which are often related to duping. Currently dupers need a friend or an alt so they can find the same server and collect their duplicated gear.
---
so tl;dr: Adding this option in the current environment just means it will be much easier for dupers and have almost no benefit to anyone else.
---
Rather I am telling you they are explosion based attacks, which, as of this update, Fireproof also resists.
---
What's stopping a duper from just putting 1 mask or 1 "unobtainable" item into the first Overseer's cache of the game and server hop/repeating? A bunch of new players would get their accounts locked?
---
We always win.
---
What you said he said.
---
What watoga quest?  The mayor one?
---
Its just server desync.  
---
Just as an fyi, but the Green Thumb perk (PER) will double the raw fluxes from plants.
---
The event quest for the queen kill will also give 1-2 stable fluxes each of 4 different flux types.
---
Same. Sometimes won't come up for about 30 minutes. Ran off to do SBQ once and in the middle of the thick of it, the menu came up. Lol

Mr. Sandman would terminate both

It wasn't "hate speech". Watch clothe video, it was some dudes messing around and having a good time. There was no hate or malice what so ever. If every person who ever made a gay joke was guilty  of "hate speech" then 70% of America would be in trouble... hell 100% of our military would be.
---
I get what you are saying, but that seems like such an exaggeration.
---
Surely the person has more time to play then just that if having so much ammo is a problem.
---
Because how would you be able to gather or make anything in that little time. 
---
And if that's all you have to play, then why worry about getting caps? 
---
Absolutely, great idea üëç
---
Yes.  Didn't want to say here because of spoilers.
---
That's how it used to be. In Fallout New Vegas, anyone could pick any lock or hack any terminal, it's just that obviously, the higher level ones were going to be harder, but if you thought you could do it, they weren't going to stop you by having you unlock perks just to be able to activate a door or computer.
---
In fallout 4, it sucked because you had to have the perks to even use the door or computer, but at least you didn't have cards on limited specials to switch in or out based on the situation.
---
To quote someone from this subreddit, "it is as if Bethesda looked at the fallout 4 perk system, already inferior to those of earlier fallouts, and said, 'how much can we fuck this up?'"
---
I just used that wall conduit, it glitched upstairs and is behind a workbench, so it's a bit hidden now
---
that what a SYNTH WOULD SAY ! 
---
Dear diary...
---
We don't care
---
At first I sucked it up and made sure to allocate 3 points into perception for lockpicking, 3 for intelligence for hacking, two points of agility for ammosmith and 3 points into luck for super duper and made it part of my spec so I wouldn't have to swap all the time. Then I started to notice something. Locked doors usually have a different way in, and locked containers have randomly generated loot that is -NEVER- anything useful. I've never seen a terminal that needed to be hacked have any sort of reward other than shortcutting through a quest by unlocking a door in an area. At this point I've settled on never lockpicking or hacking unless the skill check requires 0, even then I question if it is worth my time. I will keep using Ammosmith and Super Duper as well as Travel Agent because I am lazy, but the lockpicking and hacking part of the game has come up sorely lacking. Unless you know, I'm hurting for pre war cash...
---
Depends on where the fight is held. In an small room, butcher pete. In an open meadow, big(?) foot pete. 
---
Not so rare anymore but nice pic! 
---
interesting question. gonna have to think about it.
---
 I was reading about that the other day. You all have... counties or areas where people are in charge of things but its really at the will of the people correct? 
---
No worries brother, glad I could help!  Stay safe in the wastes!
---
I do sometimes
---
That's some solid advice! Thanks guys!
---
It most definitely did crash the servers lol
---
This stuff needs to be recorded so you can submit it to them to get those players perma banned. 
---
LOL, if you even have to go into the shed you weren't prepared to be at the SBQ.  
---
Sneak attack= 2.15x, I am virtually always Hidden, or in Caution
---
Nah, it's cool. Don't have to do them again
---
I think it would cause a lot of people to quit myself included. All that progress lost because they were stupid enough to not have a proper testing phase to work out the kinks before launch.
---
What about Borderlands? WoW? Well, any MMO? Path of Exile (better than D3 anyway)? Diablo 2? 
---
Whelp... time to start over
---
Because not everyone who traded items from other players knew they were obtained via cheating.
---
Sounds like witch hunting
---
I'm also PS4 - SGreenwell, usually on around 8 a.m. EST and the 6 to 8 p.m. EST range. Now that I've gotten most of the story quests out of the way, I'd be happy to help you out if we're both online at the same time. 
---
They probably won‚Äôt add a ‚Äúthis is for you‚Äù emote for two reasons:
---
1. That would make it just a touch easier to communicate without a mic, which they really want you to do.
---
2. They already have a Trade system in place, and even tho it‚Äôs a goddamn unintuitive nightmare to use, they probably spent a lot of time designing it, and wouldn‚Äôt want people to just flat-out disregard it thanks to a super quick and much more simplistic technique like an emote.
---
Personally I have a mic, so when I‚Äôm using it I‚Äôll usually just tell the person that I‚Äôm dropping them a gift. When I‚Äôm not using it, I‚Äôll use the ‚Äúfollow me‚Äù emote to get them to come to me, then I‚Äôll point my gun down at the bag a few times. A thumbs up gesture never hurts either.
---
kill them 
---
Yep I know a lot of them, and the ones I do not know I hunted down and stole all their shit I could thus making me just as bad  as a human but without the cheating. Good thing I did that on my raider character I RP with. I know I will never need 158,000 of each flux but I got it or 13 million ultracite 5mm rounds or 180,000 stimpacks and so on.  What is even funnier is it is all on a high level character. 
---
Lazy loudmouth.

You just want to run your fingers through his... Oh wait..

I **did not** understand that reference.

Lol I‚Äôm lvl 20 I don‚Äôt want toüòÇ

Never heard of him

yea as long as you arent in middle school..? lol I've got a mic that i literally have never used since getting an Xbox One... I am also taking a couple sick days tomorrow / Friday so hit me up!

Here's a map of the resource nodes you can build extractors on:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png](https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png)
---
Drop your camp near one, and put an extractor on it.  Needs like 10-15 power.  If it's a junk extractor I recommend putting a lock on it, otherwise anyone that walks by will farm the junk out of it :)
---
never heard of him. 
---
I deleted it ages ago, I imagine if they ever had some kind of a PTR we would have enough time to download it again
---
Oh I thought that was on my end I'm glad its not
---
Welcome to the club my friend! Probably it's a "new bug". Invisible stored budget will be there until they fix it. Btw like u/wsdlolicantmove we got bugged by a dead tamed mob. Don't know anymore if the mob cause it or just a new tricky bug. I think we have to wait the Bethesda For now I suggest you to report the bug to u/jessBethesda
---
I actually didn‚Äôt know that either until I saw the tip like 70 levels in. I was usually using Med X and then Psychobuff when I was playing melee. How am I supposed to know how many things are shooting me and then do mental math to see I‚Äôm missing out on a little DR?
---
Yeah, why do these posts gain traction? This is a minuscule problem. I'd rather they focus on stability, known plan marking, better / more varied nuke zones, Camp Fast Travel point, or other things that will enrich the game rather than some pvp thing that really anyone hardly runs into.
---
Completing the camp McClintock trials earned you a certificate of completion.  That is all you need - so congrats you have already completed that task :)
---
I'm level 64 on my alt. It felt great leveling.
---
At launch i leveled 20-50 faster than 1-20. It was broken and its fixed now
---
I liked this one so much it's also my background: https://i.imgur.com/PqVYyuA.jpg
---
Of course, more often than not, this one where the power armor glitched, pops up frequently: https://i.imgur.com/yUeRqs6.jpg
---
Sure hope starfield turns out better! 
---
Pumpkin grenades, 3\*Tenderizer, 3\*Suppressor. I run this every SBQ. I do pretty decent damage, but honestly feel like these make quite a contribution when I have them on. Really wish there was math on how much they really help, could all be in my head, but I haven't lost a SBQ fight in ages, and everything feels like it speeds up when I remember I'd crafted another stack of pumpkin grenades.
---
Focus hard on limb crippling during flight, Vats if you can, cripple doesn't need to do high dps. Maybe get a semi decent level 45 Cryolator and freeze her in place for everyone. Keep debuffs up on her during fight while maybe getting mob attention off others and leading them into the tunnel vision sightline of the explosive minigun guy who hasn't stopped shooting once. If damage seems to peter off half way through a long fight, get on voice and ask if anyone is out of ammo and needs some more, carry a big pile in of some spare. Entire kills have happened when I realized I was the literal only one that was non-melee fresh 50 with my All Rise and actually shooting her to any effect in the sky. Straight up said I was responsible for all of those big dips they just saw, and I need a stack of shotgun shells. Boom, 300 on the ground. Game over.
---
Come in with resources if you're not going to be shelling out the bigger hits. If you think you can help, you probably can.
---
I tried this a few times, and all it did was encourage really low level players to join making the fight harder than it needed to be.  I intentionally do it on fissure prime to weed those people out.
---
Okay I will I'm 17 so i was just wondering. I have a good headset i never use because I'm the quiet type alot of the time
---
Okay, thank you! 
---
Doesnt work for the ripper so i doubt it would for a drill anyways
---
Are you sure it's not just the legendary enemy 1-time regen? They will continue regaining HP until they are at 100%, regardless of how much you pepper them. It's best to just wait when their regen triggers (under half hp)
---
Just wondering if this on the peak right by the golf course everyone nukes cause I had my camp there for the first month
---
Thanks. I've got one place that is usually reliable but I have been using those materials to repair the two legendary items I wear. Prior to the patch it was easy enough to manage.
---
Lol you can thank my fat fingers. It‚Äôs very usable in my opinion. It‚Äôs one of my go-to all purpose weapons. And the freeze effect is a nice bonus too. It‚Äôs a bit of an ammo hog so make sure you have plenty if crystal to craft with. 
---
And they do. But private parties have a right to manage their own platforms as they see fit. No person is under any obligation to host, or be apartied to, anything they don't want on a private platform. Businesses are not obligated to employ people who hurt their business by words or actions. 
---
The fact that someone has the right to free speech does not obligate me to listen to it. I will leave platforms that endorse content I would call "toxic". 
---
Bethesda sees this situation as a threat to their business because people will leave, to avoid "toxic" hate speech. 
---
Terminating several accounts prevents the loss of hundreds or thousands. Would you ask Bethesda to sacrifice an indeterminate amount of money to grant toxic behavior and speech a safe haven? Then how should their share holders respond? I'd sell that stock so fast it's not even funny. Without sufficient shareholders, a company like Bethesda will collapse in short order. If companies were forced to do business in a way that ensured their collapse, then our economy would never function correctly again.
---
Once again, on your website, do what you want. They've got a business to run.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the quick response!
---
It's been happening to me randomly since release, also if you hold back on the analog stick when exiting the workbench (to start moving in that direction) it will load you right back into the workbench.
---
That sucks then. That character is probably garbage now.
---
Run with a friend, equip Rad sponge rank 1 and share it.  Never worry about rads again.
---
I'm hoping this bug gets fixed quick, cause its really annoying to select your quantity, then go to set the price at or close to 0, only to have it jump to 25000, and force you to reattempt the entire endeavor...
---
Isn't Hack 3 somewhat useful for going through bunkers to launch nukes?
---
The 90s called and want their Extreme Edge back
---
Enforcer did work for me a month ago but seems less effective now. 
---
I....am not sure....
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I haven‚Äôt completed the missions tho
---
Man, I fucking love you guys. Shit like this is just solid gold.
---
That would cause extremely bad publicity. Seems to me that they wouldn‚Äôt want to give people more reasons to hate this product.
---
Great point. I'm still learning how and when to switch perk cards. It's easy to forget and complete the transaction/repair/whathaveyou without equipping the proper perk card ahead of time.
---
I like this idea.
---
Ahh.. FONV... Anyone else have "Knock-Knock" and a bunch of pool cues for repair?
---
Don‚Äôt quote me but if they somehow spawned with revenge I think they can still initiate pvp
---
The answer is for people not to be so selfish as to afk when at a vendor. It‚Äôs not that hard to have some manners.
---
You can't drop or store any quest items
---
Awesome man thanks for the info 
---
&gt;fallout.gamepedia.com
---
Fallout Gamepedia always seemed to lack a bunch of information compared to the fallout wikia to me
---
mouth lazyloud
---
And they wrote like and share on a Reddit post. Top keks. 
---
I am on PS4 Pro. Are you as well?
---
Does it add weight to add this mod?
---
&gt; Why so much anti pvp?
---
Because until now, Fallout has been a single player game, so most of it's fans are not big into pvp.
---
And because it's a stupid system.  They should have just had pvp and pve servers.
---
I think it would be awesome if they added it in a dlcs and the model is already done since they can just use the one in the creation club from 4 smae with the homemade shotgun
---
Yes I know this
---
Ok, I'll answer your question. I would have free speech on my website and have the option to block people you dont want to interact with (which they have). Next I already said you were correct in their right to ban these people, I just said that I didnt agree with it. I am allowed to have that opinion.. unless Bethesda finds out about it maybe. Lastly though they definitely wouldn't have lost thousands of players for those few players views being tolerated. 
---
Look. I breeze through flatwoods and the lumber mill to collect stuff then I bulk it all or scrap it. When I do that it lags. I think you are hoping people say duping but I mean there is no way to prove that it was duping just because of lag. I lag out of ark servers and there isnt duping
---
Xbox has been running smoother if anything, didn't have a single disconnect yesterday
---
You know I really can‚Äôt remember at all haha but it‚Äôs extremely worth it IMO 
---
Either team up with a high level player who can escort you through the area, or server hop until you find one that doesn't have high level players in the area. The enemies there scale their level to the first player in the area. 
---
I do the opposite now. If I show up and the ghouls are low level, then there is probably a low level player in the area, so I will change servers so I can get a decent challenge. 
---
 Ahh.. FONV... Anyone else have "Knock-Knock" and a bunch of pool cues for repair? 
---
Welcome to my post comment.  Today I'm going to be commenting on /u/DJQuamme's post.  If you look on Reddit, you can see that DJQuamme posted:

The first time I defended, prior to the patch, my turrets worked fine defending against liberator robots. Second time I tried was after the patch so I made the assumption the patch broke it. Definitely something not quite right with the area then.
---
This could be a fix for people dragging around thousands of pounds of items, but what happens when mule characters have reached that limit? 
---
I have a secondary too where I drop ALL my legendary stuff to that my main isn‚Äôt using. I like to collect those for friends looking for something specific, or noobs just getting into the game. That need an upper hand. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to have to make a third if there‚Äôs a total weight cap and now remember what each mule has. 
---
I'm in agreement with you.  I like to be the first one to jump in and tag her... it's not about the level of the player that starts the fight.  I've done it back to back at level 140.  First time, there were 6 of us and we dropped her in 7 mins.  Next time, the entire server showed up and we couldn't even get her to the regen mark at 15mins in.
---
If there are less than 10 people there, I can watch my vats crits knock 2-4% health off every hit.... when it gets over 15, her health stops moving.
---
Of course but tormentor isnt one of them
---
Add me kb8378 and we can chat
---
Maybe pacifist mode prevents it
---
Yes. Idk what they changed. But alot of my blue screens came in watoga
---
The 90s left a message they wanted me to pass to you, that joke was never funny
---
wouldn‚Äôt the servers slow down even more if they added something like this?
---
!00% agree though I would add a cooldown for enabling/disabling pacifist mode to prevent abuse.
---
I agree.  IMO the scaling should be removed completely.  If the entire server shows up to help, we'd stop being angry about it and start thanking them for their help!
---
I wish I'd known. I'd have forked out Atoms for that!
---
And I thought Raiders were the scourge of the Wasteland.
---
Hrmmm, that inventory point is a good one.
---
Yea I completely agree. Have been scavenging Lucky Hole Mine since I swapped to it,  but all worth it!
---
I‚Äôve snipped the mini nuke a super mutant suicider was carrying and it exploded.  Not the same as your question but if one works I expect the other would as well.
---
Tried to nuke whitesprings and bluescreened every time I left the vicinity of the clubhouse
---
Honestly, the game has been ruined from launch. And as long as they‚Äôre not effecting other players in PVP I don‚Äôt other people‚Äôs enjoyment should matter to you. There‚Äôs no saving the economy, so just enjoy the game for what it is *shrugs* 
---
Lol I've heard about this but i thought it was supposed to be in that circular cage and i thought it was bugged
---
Never heard of him, but as of now YouTube just isn't really worth it for Fo76, you'll get better info and actual responses from this subreddit.
---
There's still a little cancer here, but less than YouTube.
---
Its a fix for you spawning into a world and being killed/attacked/drowned before you can actually move your character and react to said threat.
---
The first load screen loads the map, the second load screen loads all the items/buildings/mobs/  around your character so that when you see your duder, you can play. And you no longer have to wait for things to pop in or load after your UI has popped up.
---
I like the load screen vs being invulnerable at login as im sure someone would find a way to exploit the invulnerability.
---
So now we got the griefers acting like raiders and the anti griefers becoming the Brotherhood of Steel.  This really is Fallout
---
It's rare, but I have seen her not regenerate... 2 times out of 30 or so attacks.
---
Really, very impressive. Absolutely brilliant design. You deserve to be seen, and we deserve to see more from you in the future.
---
Ya you shouldn‚Äôt be there, fallow your main quest line and it will teach you everything, give you what you need to explore seeping into Appalachia
---
Trying to get that same one for order of mysteries
---
Ignores 50% of target armor!
---
Can‚Äôt wait wished I hadn‚Äôt pitched on my main
---
Add me to the list of, "Never heard of him." 
---
I also don't ever watch any videos with commentary or opinions on video games. I personally find this sort of content worthless.
---
Not really because then dupers just dupe 90k &amp; then stop. Even if the limit is 10 they just make 9 &amp; stop. Until they find a way to prevent it &amp; identify duped items I‚Äôd rather they focus on that rather than putting band aids over the problem.
---
3 of my disconnects came immediately after i started the 'Census Violence' event

Camp McClintock has loads of battered clipboards

The amusement parks for toys.

They offered a game at AAA prices, including very expensive CE editions: they delivered a product that would be considered, on Steam, early access.  There are, and were bugs, in the game from the commercial release of Fallout 4: this includes any mention of two-shot explosive shot/guns - they were also in Fallout 4 and grossly OP.  There are literally bugs in release, patched out by fans, years ago.
---
The stability issues and duping are separate issues that need to be addressed (for an early access game), and shouldn't be included in the final product.
---
As a fan of the lore for Fallout, I find the implementation of Fallout tropes (Deathclaws, BOS, Enclave, Super Mutants) to be exceptionally lazy writing.  For a company that takes the time to include many "West Virginian" content, they shat all-over the Fallout source material: going as far to say they don't care about the timeline.
---
You mean you could literally vanish into thin air from the griefer's game instead of rage-quitting the game and writing a novel on Reddit about it? What good would that do?  ;{}  lol
---
Not disconnects. Blue Screens. I mean i was disconnected, but the game crashed.
---
It's like you can't read. Players in proximity to the boss increase boss HP. They all had to "tag" the Queen to get loot chances so they're going considered engaged. 
---
Wow I‚Äôm going to try this later if I have the budget. 
---
The more pertinent condition I'm thinking of isn't the bonus effects and the item/level, so much as the effects, the item, and the specific max condition since those have some variation.
---
The chances of getting everything identical seems small enough to warrant removal, unless I'm very much misunderstanding how condition works.
---
So now he killed you with a super sledge? I thought it was from stacking explosive bobble heads ? Bruh. Please get your ‚Äústory‚Äù straight. 
---
You seem to have farmed that location a bit, have you noticed Scorched dropping 10mm SMGs with any regularity at higher player level? Supposedly they drop them at "high level" but I don't know if that is referring to player or enemy level. 
---
This is awesome! Great job! I love that people are making restaurants and places for social interaction.
---
Actually, it does matter to me a lot Scammer. Because of all the help you and your cronies gave I now have to deal with every event and boss fight ending almost as soon as it began with a sea of people just like your "Friends" all jetpacking around and shooting the ground with their TSE weapons
---
How are you clueless enough to conflate caricatures of groups and a logical argument?
---
intelligent people don't jump to conclusions.
---
How would introducing new currencies and 4*5* legendaries minimise the impact of duping? 
---
My only issue with this quest is replayability. It's funny the first time but with subsequent characters there should be a trick to skip this sequence. (Is there a trick? I tried some things \[don't want to give spoilers\] but it didn't work.)
---
To be honest, no that really doesn't help unfortunately.  By coming in and not attacking the queen, you've just ensured that the others have to do more work to kill her.  The adds are meaningless.  In fact, I run adrenal reaction and prefer to keep one on me to keep my health low so I do more damage. 
---
The adds are not the part the high levels need help with.  It's getting damage on the queen when the event is over populated.
---
Instead of hitting d-pad for selecting amount, use L1 or R1. Then use d-pad to get exact amount. Holding L1 will not exceed and wraparound to max value
---
It seems that if you one shot kill a legendary, you will get only a one star weapons, no matter how may stars they have. I read that in a few places and it seems to hold true when I do Uranium Fever. I  like that mechanic, especially while doing WS and Uranium Fever.  Just wish it was advertised more so people will just tag things in groups rather then TSE kill everything, this just leaves everyone with nothing and only gives you an Item you are just gonna drop anyways. 
---
Fuck yeah! Wasteland Bard!
---
I was on the other end of this last week. I ran to the event, and even though I‚Äôm only lvl 45, I was focusing on the sloths and scorched mainly, then pouring bullets into the queen when she landed. There were people on the chat telling me to ‚Äúget the fuck out of here‚Äù and ‚Äúpeople like you make it harder for everyone.‚Äù I was just thinking ‚ÄúAm I not out here burning through ammo with the rest of you?‚Äù
---
I never internalize anyone else's judgement on something, but it's interesting hearing all the press about the game.
---
Happens to me once in a while on PS4 usually when I have my benches too close together or when there are objects too close at the back. If I spread them out it doesn‚Äôt happen.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Did your change as well?
---
I just want specialized ammo types back. Is that too much to ask?
---
See my comment above. L1 and R1 not hit with this issue
---
I consider hitting me once with a super Sledge being one shotted.  You know there are bobble heads that affect melee too, right?  Point still stands.
---
I'm on an X and my frame rate is stable when firing on auto.
---
I have done the event probably 15 - 20 times. 
---
5 times we haven't been able to kill the queen. 
---
Well I‚Äôd keep the stash roll back as it‚Äôs because it saves each time you exit it. Of course this would still effect people‚Äôs inventory so you might lose stuff if the servers crashes when putting stuff into your stash. 
---
Arizona Ranger would destroy them both.
---
Right on thanks guys I didn‚Äôt know this was possible
---
&gt; max condition
---
Forgot about this one. Another layer of RNG.
---
Also this would be a very good key for Bethesda to use to wipe out the existing duplicated items. As long as it's not account banning, I think some amount of collateral damage is acceptable in this action.
---
Hail Centurian üëç
---
What they had said about what was said.
---
It's as if a crime has been committed and you're supporting the position of the person saying "Destroy the evidence!"  What more conclusion would you like?  
---
Well I'm not sure how much energy a power plant if the fo universe creates but instead of states the US has 13 commonwealths because we got too big because of the annexation of Mexico and Canada. So I'm guessing Appalachia is in the same commonwealth as boston
---
Then you shouldn't be there dragging the event down for others =/
---
That would be the wise Mothman variant (with the purple eyes, when I completed PtE - which isn‚Äôt easy when you‚Äôre a solo player, I found üòõ). Friendly Mothmen being a bug would make sense; I think them lurking is intentional, though.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I have been resisting going TSE, but it seems that I cannot pvp without it
---
Oh so you get to pick and choose which bugs are okay?
---
Curator perk bug - k never mind
---
Bobbleheads stack bug - dirty duper get banned
---
It's so dumb, just like your 'lunch in the fridge' analogy that in no way represents what is happening here. 
---
It's more like, I paid for my lunch and it is full of worms. When I mess with the worms I get shouted at for playing with my food.
---
Bethesda enabled this behavior, if you used any logic you would understand that.
---
Are you me? 
---
I'm sometimes under the impression that Beth treats Fallout like a red-headed stepchild they got on their third marriage:  it can never and will never be better than their own Elder Scrolls - and intentionally use it to test out ideas, indifferent to the results.
---
Fixed damage, only counts on first hit. What's the point of even allowing players to be evil, on a non-pvp server? If given the option to be evil, some people will always take the option, so take that option away. This is an online game, you don't have to worry about freedoms... Later when an actual PvP server is introduced, you'll have the option to be evil and grief.
---
That was awesome, the boring tone of the robots, the robot taking a coffee break and his counting down gets slower and slower. Even a named ghoul with a number.
---
Exactly. The thing they put so much work into was fo4. This game is just reheated leftovers and table scraps from that and other games.
---
It's a trade secret, you need to join your local Masonic Lodge and *pay your dues.*
---
YES
---
The perk card that lets you over-repair the weapon beyond 100%. 
---
They don‚Äôt stack. Just the explosive ones stack. Try again. 
---
I mean considering I can't go into an interior cell and be able tk move properly he may be loud mouth. But he is also not wrong about some things. The game has a long way to go til it is a proper game in my eyes. As far as I am concerned the game is still a beta. Don't get me wrong I still like the game and it is fun, but they really should have done more work before releasing this title.
---
Yet another goddamned crybaby post.....
---
My money is on 16 ton. That kid picked up a shovel the day he was born and loaded 16 ton! 
---
Oddly, I kind of like it when my teammates don't take down the adds. That means I can look down from shooting the queen every 15 seconds or so to refresh my adrenaline stack. I put tesla coils on my t-60 so I can get a distinctive audio and visual cue when something is near me - it's so chaotic with the screeches and screen shaking and shit flying everywhere that I honestly almost died a few times without even realizing. Obviously that is time and damage wasted, but being able to consistently keep up that damage bonus really helps when it's a gatling laser or plasma doing the damage
---
Same applies for mindless anti-"fanboyism".
---
RB? Not LB? I'm pretty sure RB is the Social Menu, where you can mute people who are playing music at home with their mic un-muted.
---
I've only seen his video about being sent a free PA edition of the game from Bethesda. Personally I didnt care to watch additional videos of his because nothing really snagged my attention and he sounded a whiney, which may just be personal taste idk.
---
To be fair, I don't watch many youtubers, I enjoyed the older WTF is videos by TB and follow some BF5/PUBG updaters.
---
Sorchbeasts are stupid in current form, they machine gun their sonic blast from any direction.  Hell event the queen doesn't do that BS.
---
My group killed SBQ with literally two seconds left on the event timer the other night. As soon as the corpse went limp, server crashed. I wish I could just enjoy playing the game but it's getting more and more aggravating. 
---
I usually tag the queen a few times + every few minutes for good measure and then attack whatevers on the ground while also reviving fallen players. Now that i have a TSE shotgun i can actually do more damage to whatevers attacking players. 
---
For sure. Pete don't care whose meat he chop.
---
Some weapons like explosive weapons are affected both by the main weapon perk (rifles, shotguns etc) and the explosives expert perk in intelligence. Together it's +160% damage. Add two-shot to that to double it, add bloodied to that to add hundreds of damage if you are on low health. My bloodied explosive gauss (not two-shot) does 1113 damage per shot when i am on low health, without chems or bobbleheads.
---
Legit question, is shotgun + Enforcer useful? Or does she kind of ignore crippling/etc?
---
Cool. I had my camp near the McClintock until recently and was just looking for items to build my Excavator suit and came across it and thought I'd see what quest I could complete, lol. I was just curious what all was involved with the Enclave, and found out it was so I didn't mind to, but was hoping I didn't have to do the trials again. Although I could use some more clipboards and fans...
---
Borked lol
---
But it isn't really a mistake. There's no reason for us to have a natural expectation for there to be interior-only walls. It's a purely cosmetic/QoL add-in. FO4 didn't have interior walls either.
---
To be fair, it's mostly the energy weapons that break in a single clip. Maybe we're just using all the crappy prototypes that never should have left the labs. But in all seriousness, even being able to repair with extras would be nice. I would not mind carrying around ten gatling plasmas to be able to use mine for a nice long chunk without it breaking
---
It still wouldn't make sense, in my opinion, to have ads mentioning Boston in this city, as Watoga itself was made to be completely automatic, and in it self was much more impressive. Hence it would make more sense advertising for powering Watoga as in "we can power an fully automatic city!"
---
As I wrote above, I'm sure its just a small oversight when the reused the images from Fallout 4. I don't mind at all, I just think its funny. 
---
Well if you get frustrated from spending hours of grinding for crappy drops like the majority of people are experiencing- shoot me a message and I‚Äôll hook you up with whatever you‚Äôd like
---
I‚Äôm nuking the dmv because of that quest
---
Or it's because it's a copy pasted asset from fallout 4. 
---
Yeah, I don't blame you.  I'd try to dig up the name of the person, especially in game name, that traded you those items and be ready to provide them to Bethesda if they contact you and explain the situation.  Hopefully innocent people won't get caught up in it, and they'll just remove the plan knowledge from your account, but we'll just have to see.  Let us know if Bethesda does approach you.
---
You know. PC is able to save different card configurations..... why aren't consoles able to? 
---
Username checks out...
---
That can't be all, because I don't one hit kill much and I see drills and flare guns drop from legendary enemies. Or nothing sometimes.
---
could you uninstall the game, because that's my request.
---
There are a lot of cool things you can do to spruce up your camp but it takes patience and a lot of finagling lol
---
Honestly, just wandering past, I wouldn't have guessed that it was a camp. 
---
That‚Äôs terrible, sorry to hear that, clearing out the ground enemies is really helpful, I‚Äôm always grateful to any player, any level that gets stuck in keeping the hermit crabs, sloths, scorched etc off my back so I can plough everything I have into getting her to land so we can all pile in and melee for the win, i run a low health heavy gunner and melee build for SBQ fights with adrenal reaction so I get max damage per bullet and melee weapon swing but it‚Äôs hard to stay alive if your getting slapped in the face constantly by wendigo‚Äôs etc so someone like yourself is vital to the end result, sry again to hear you were treated like that :(
---
I had the Destiny 1 Beta on my console for about 4 before it turned into a black box
---
I want to have towers. Right now, you have to make a huge base foundation, so you don't have a lot of budget to go up.
---
The regular ones never drop anything worthwhile. I spent a good chunk of time killing one about 30 mins ago - not because I wanted to, but because it wouldn't push off and leave me to it. I was in a large building and it kept hitting me through the walls no matter where I was and no amount of max sneak would get it to unaggro. Ended up wasting a buncha ammo to kill it and got nothin' for it. :(
---
What is this Perk you all talk about ? :)
---
I have a crit build as well, so replying to keep this active in my history. I will be eager to see what you come up with. Now all I need is a explosive pipe rifle.
---
I guess bud , but for me theres tons of places that extra jump comes in handy
---
It makes sense since it is short for Massachusetts Fusion -- "Mass Fusion was an energy company in [Boston](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Boston) before the [Great War](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Great_War), and was the primary power provider for the entire state."
---
Ok where can I find the plans for brick walls because I seriously need to redo my camp!
---
...Jesus Christ
---
Tell me more.  I know not of this thing.
---
All the damn time. It's been happening for longer than I can remember...maybe since launch?
---
Hyperbole much? I'm currently at 250+ hours played. Still having fun, and the game does work. That's not saying it never has problems, but you're just flat out trolling with your hyperbolic rhetoric. Just tells me you either a. have not played the game. b. haven't played it since beta. Or c. Just live to troll.
---
Also the quest resets if you have to stop playing for any reason.
---
Had my game crash three times, repeating most of the quest each time. This kind of wore out the joke...
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking, nobody is that high of a level and playing legitimately.
---
Oh sorry? I'm just trying to maybe explain 
---
I still can't continue on the Brotherhood quest line because the quest Recruitment Blues won't trigger and I can't get my government ID from the DMV even though I have that soldiers note.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. Lvl 23 and am still using a lvl 5 revolver cause I can‚Äôt find anything better and constantly run out of ammo/stims taking enemies down. Not sure how to consistently level up as in going for a pistol/vats build.
---
Yesterday I crafted a full set of Excavator armor for a new guy, was lvl27, he thought it was a blast. He also told me his wife will be jealous because it was her character he was playing, lol.
---
i literally just found one near the vendor bot in downtown grafton, do you want it? free of charge of course.
---
YOu need the advanced power connectors.
---
Looks noice mate
---
To have a building system with tons of ways to make your camp look neat and new and lifelike, interior walls of all things not being included seems to me like a mistake. I care alot less about a bear rug or an ugly broken toilet than I do about being able to make rooms in my house and I'm sure most people would agree. I mean making rooms seems like a basic core idea when building a house of any kind.
---
The loot is mediocre at best and has modded weapons you could probably make on your own
---
Yup. And again, these communication methods go back *literally decades*. Like, OK, they don't want global text chat. No idea why, but they don't. Fine. How about chat bubbles? Something that existed in games 20+ years ago? These are local. Only players in your immediate vicinity see them. You can also color code them, so that "/say Hello" or "/s Hello" results in a black text on white chat bubble over speaker's head, saying "Hello". And a "/yell (or /y) Get out of the fire!" results in a red chat bubble, so you immediately know something urgent is being communicated. These can even be toggled, for the purists. Elder Scrolls Online does this, you can toggle bubble chat on or off any time, you can set the timing for how long these bubbles persist, you can turn the global text chat on or off, you can join or leave specific interest-based channels.
---
EVE Online has an entire newbie help channel just for newbies, which is monitored both by older helpful players, and company employees. The game came out in '03. If you ask a stupid newbie question in that channel, there's thousands of players there at any given time, and someone will respond to you. Heck, I came back to the game, and out of the blue one of the customer relations team started talking to me, asking if I needed any help or if something wasn't clear, because I was gone for a while. A little creepy, but also made me feel incredibly welcome. 
---
As far as this game does, imagine I got a lvl 35 two-shot Handmade. Not particularly great, definitely not worth the trouble of posting it on the /r/fo76bazaar, so I just vendor it, since I have no more friends that still play this game. Now, imagine the same scenario, but in Elder Scrolls Online. Trade chat, zone chat, guild chat, you name it! AND you can **link** the item in chat, so players just click on it and see all the details! No need to describe it, just link the items you want to see. Someone wants your Handmade? But they're far away? They can ask you to mail it on them COD (Cash On Delivery). You click their name and mail them the item, and when they accept you get the money. Easy-peasy. How awesome is that, compared to the shit we're doing in this game? 
---
It's all about communication. Some games give you tools. This game doesn't. And yet this game, more than anything, relies on other players, because all drops are RNG. Meaning odds are incredibly high you'll get an item you don't want, but someone else does. And yet, the game makes it as difficulty as possible to find someone who wants your item, or someone who has the item you want. Asinine. Completely and utterly asinine. And utterly embarrassing, for a AAA-priced game, released in 2018, by a major studio.
---
Deep breaths...OK...sorry for the rant.
---
Skyrim has a separate Dead NPC room with green and purple walls that I accidentally found once when trying to find out why my follower had gone to and used the teleport command to get to them to find out where the heck they had gone only to find them (just out of interest) but standing alive next to a pile of dead guards from previous dragon attacks
---
Does it work on the x01?
---
Bethesda usually tries to avoid doing anything that Obsidian did in New Vegas but yeah repair kits would be nice.
---
It could easily be balanced like having it repair weapons by 25% durability per kit and having it only be capable of bringing the durability back up to a max of 50% durability so if you want a full repair or a "double repair" through the weapon artisan perk then you need to find a workbench.
---
watoga has 5 (that i know of) PA spawns and a fusion core generator. i farm mine there.
---
I understand.  The actual discovery would be trivial.  They would need a method of suspending accounts which they seem to have.  All told, it's a simple process they've chosen not to do for some other reason.
---
Dude, get over yourself.
---
Same! I feel sick. LoL
---
who?
---
Of I can't open something up with level 0 lockpick, I just skip it now. I don't need more prewar money.

Just because of that comment I‚Äôm going to dupe more TSE weapons, serums, etc. and hand them out to people
---
I guess.
---
I casually do whitespring nuke zones in my hazmat suit just because i can jump.
---
Did it alot at level 35 actually.
---
this is a good idea, if you play with friends alot just have one guy be the repair guy and carry those and drop em and stuff like a gun medic.
---
Care to justify that? I havent referenced myself once.

Tried to nuke whitesprings twice since the update, both have resulted in crashing to the xbox home screen. Did make an attempt to contact your support team at which they advised me to turn the xbox off and them switch it back on and keep playing... ill be honest im not going to stop playing the game but there is very little incentive to launch nukes whilst the game is in this state. I get no reward for the effort i put in, and when the game does crash there is nothing i can do to get back onto the same server because it wipes my recently played with and then connects me to a random server. Now im not sure if its possible on your end (by that i mean if you could be bothered) but allow us to pick what server we connect to, number them make a server list or so on, i also presume this may help with lag as we can select servers with higher ping rates/lower amounts of people.
---
My favorite passtime :)
---
Reminds me of my first bounty at a lower level, which was a blast actually. Picked a lock at a workshop (wasn't owned, use to be but they logged out, I guess), got a bounty. Waited forever until some level 90 in x01 PA came after me. Well, I was gonna make this guy earn his 10 caps. So, here we go, an epic chase through half the damn map, me trying to find a place to hid with my chameleon armor only for him to find me and me to run again (mind you, I'm running around in the tattered mole costume, hehe). 
---
I still had the mistress of mystery quest going on, so the veil was in my inventory. Ran into there and into the underground lair. Heard a lot of fighting upstairs, figured it was time for me to go, fast travelled to white springs, jumped on a piano to play some tunes. X01 guy shows up, helmet off and wearing the veil, lol. But he doesn't shoot me, is well mannered enough to let me play, then I get up, run outside, him on my heels, and almost escape again by jumping on a car and towards a wall...which he promptly explodes the car and claims my bounty. 
---
That was a lot of fun. We both gave each other a thumbs up and went on our separate ways. 
---
From what I've read, none of the continuous damage melee weapons work with Vampire illness you use the power attack.
---
No worries. At the minimum, I can help you with mods you might not have yet.
---
Wait a couple minutes and loot. A couple nights ago someone logged into a nuked Whitesprings without PA and died at my feet. I sat on their bag for a couple minutes until they got back.
---
I get the one where I exit the crafting station after fixing my weapons or armor then the game brings me right back in as if I'm trying to modify or craft something. 
---
lol.
---
WHY!? Why do people not team up for this event.  Waiting for people to tag is a serious drag.  Team up with the person, then you'll all get loot either way.  The event is over faster, everyone is happy!
---
(unless this is about xp, in which case, see a shrink.  xp is far too easy to get)
---
Slugs should come back for shotguns.
---
I have been wondering that myself. Looks like I have a new experiment to try out.
---
I have never turned pacifist mode off, ever. I do not claim workshops, I do not pick locks, I do nothing to initiate pvp, I have played every day since launch, from 5 pm until 10 pm, on weekends from around 10 am until 2am. You can claim this in misinformation, I'm sure you will, but you're wrong . At least 15 times now I've been one shot by people using the bobblehead glitch. I change servers , sometimes it's days until it happens again. The places I notice it happen most often is farming white spring, and the queen fight.
---
this has been going on PC for some time now.
---
It's one of the few mutations that I must have. I had it for a while and lost it. Maybe you should take some Rad-Away and see how much you like playing without it.

---
Well let's see. Prior to the duping crazy my friend was roleplaying an arms dealer. 
---
He'd have 15-20 of many high end weapons. 
---
He'd get them through trade. Trade em for a higher value. 
---
How do you separate him from the dupers? 
---
Make him prove all of his trades via Reddit posts and discord screenshots?
---
Even after the patch this gun still is in limbo with it's weight.
---
Pixel cosmetics from the dev room dude. They aren't running around with god guns. It's SILLY HATS AND SHIT. 
---
Your solution to someone having a silly hat before you is to take away a 40-60 dollar investment, along with any time spent enjoying the game enough to get a real kick out of getting an ugly helmet.
---
You're equating it to crime. There is your SERIOUS issue with putting emotional weight on something. Take a step back and forget that you spend all day on reddit and the internet. You're equivocating it because it's that big of a deal to *you*. Your viewpoint makes 0 sense from an objective prospective. It's literal Nerd Rage, you know the perk. Bethesda is used to the type of attitude.
---
Again, pixels. Its people enjoying the product coming across someone else offering to make their gameplay more fun. No they're not the devil. And no they don't have to deal with your catty bullshit where you're attacking their moral fucking fiber over their decision over whether or not to equip a god damn hat.
---
Grow up. Until then, shut up. Listen instead.
---
Thanks so much for linking that post, looks like this is yet another one of the hoaxes people love spreading around here. Either that or just people inattentive to the fact that they have bounties
---
Vampire barely gives health back as it is, I only carried around a knife that had it before they fixed it to where you could proc it anywhere. After that I sold the knife.
---
When that event pops up I always check my map to see who is there. Number of players and levels. If there's only 2 or 3 I'm not going in. That event is end game type shit and requires a good number of players to do it effectively. Otherwise your basically just wasting a lot of your resources. 
---
Yeah, it's supposed to be funny, I think. Problem is, server stability is a major issue, and this particular quest doesn't have any checkpoints. If something happens at any point between the beginning and the end, you go all the way back to the beginning. I had to do this quest maybe half a dozen times before it finally worked. Not only was it not funny and tedious and shallow, but because of server stability I was force to re-do it, from scratch, many times over, or I couldn't finish the game, because it is part of the main quest.
---
Is "Old-Possum" a euphemism?
---
I've seen this come up A LOT today, and most people suggest to pull the materials from your stash into your inventory, or vice versa.. it should work after
---
maybe next patch, \*crosses fingers\*
---
Back when you wondered if something was going to hand your ass yo you...  118 now, haven't died to anything but the lag beast in a looooong time.

This is implying they fix the dupe issue. 
---
Any idea what time they usually come out?
---
You're not worried about the constant wave of base griefing?   I'd like to spend more time on an elaborate home, but mine is constantly being leveled by dbags as is.  It'd just be too expensive to build more complex structures.    
---
Dope af base, regardless.
---
I hate this one.
---
Well, the more people that know about an area the more likely it is to be emptied when you log in and go there. 
---
Or a better solution would be to realize that we're in 2019 and that designing a multiplayer game that locks vendors to one player at a time is not acceptable.  The correct solution to someone being afk in a vendor menu is to make it as it should be -- not a problem by allowing any player to interact with the vendor simultaneously with other players.
---
Gimme that gun!
---
Its the reason you can crit so much.
---
Same like those people that got into the dev room - bam, banned!  Just because you can doesn't mean you should.  And no - you paid for access to a game as a service, provided you follow the terms of service.  Break them and you lose access.  Nothing unfair about that at all.
---
By your logic, because the game is broken, its ok to dupe, stack, etc.  No, its not.  Yes, its the players that are the problem, players so rotten to the core they're full of worms themselves.
---
Haven‚Äôt tried in days but the Morgantown school gym is better.

oh my the amount of effort you put into this is amazing! Good job! 
---
No. That's dumb. Getting two identical items may be uncommon but it's hardly a statistical anomoly. 
---
And you're assuming the only way to acquire these are via drops. While trading allows you to single out specific items.

If others aren't getting the same results as you, it could be a calibrated excavator armor glitch specifically. I have same power armor and def my legs need repairing way more often as well.
---
I‚Äôve only ever found handmade plans reliably with a level 15 character, but that was a while ago so maybe they changed it
---
I don't know any dupers that only carry some weapons or some bobbleheads. Every screenshot I've seen they have thousands of everything. Again, somebody looking and it should be able to tell the difference.
---
in all honesty, the atom store is just for fun, you dont like the paints? dont by them.
---
I agree that one is terrible, but if someone buys it, they like it, fair enough. 
---
It‚Äôs happening on pc too since we were patched. 
---
the main crimson spot is in the dump &amp; generators area outside the back entrance for the enclave: there's a big spot for brain fungus (like a dozen of plants, more or less); cobalt is found along the main road outside the east exit, there are some slit beans (and also over the main entrance of the enclave bunker)
---
They flat out suck in VATS. I'd gladly trade my TSE rifle for another legendary rifle without the two shots effect.
---
Going SBQ at Lv.102 with my best weapon, a fast firing TS Pipe Sniper, doing 134 dmg. I feel so useless.
---
Still waiting for a TSE, TS crippling or Anti-Armor Hunting Rifle. RNG Jesus gives me tons of crappy armor parts and low level anti-mutant/insect weapons.
---
Didn't they always do decent damage?
---
Yes. You‚Äôll always find more. Sometimes in the same place. 
---
Not like this.
---
Sorry to see you're being hassled.  I usually play by myself for this reason. I have found a few people who are really nice and easy going. It can ruin your playing especially people looking for a fight.  I just ignore them and change servers. You can add me if you want. I'm older, have a mic, easy going and always enjoy helping other players. Add me on PSN if you need help. PSN: R-C-MAN 
---
It's either bobbleheads or , what would be worse, what if for some reason the game reads that a player has initiated pvp and hasn't . Just the games pacifist mode itself failing and not working.
---
Ooh yeah, I didn't even realize that. Regardless we need this ;)
---
I've done that too, but I feel that building the set for them takes the experience away from them, so instead, I take them to the terminal that starts the quest, then after they figure out what to do, I escort them to the location and help them get the plans.  Then I supply them with whatever components are needed, or show them a location to camp that has a black titanium resource.  Then when they're ready, I walk them through the creation of the armor (at my camp because it has both a power armor station AND a stash box) and then take them to have it registered.
---
If the person isn't into having the experience, then I'll just make it for them.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bork#Bork_as_a_verb
---
I dunno. Making top end gear easy to get seems flawed.
---
Arguably duping has done that and....well....the game is stupid easy because of it
---
Obviously that method wouldn't catch all offenders.  You don't everything over X amount.. clearly you'd suspend the account.  Leaving them with nothing on that account, not some tidy still sellable stack.
---
I did say an obvious amount.  Some number they're comfortable won't catch any or as little as possible legitimate accounts.  Clearly it won't catch everyone.
---
What's a "static item"?
---
and just  how do they make challenging events when dupers ensured that everyone and their mothers have the best weapons in the game
---
There is ALOT of room to move things around. A pipe weapon is not mandatory at all. Mine doesn't even double dip with the pistol perks(only bolt action does).
---
I'd just find any bloodied/explosive ranged weapon to test. I do not currently know how important the +15% fill is to achieving the 100% critical rate. 
---
I vote for 0 HP.  What point does it serve to have ANY slap damage?  Those who don't want to PvP can be griefed too easily.
---
Ya. I have the camo paint on my XO-1. I like it a lot. It‚Äôs the only paint scheme I own. 
---
I thought I read somewhere that they fixed this and added a checkpoint or something. 
---
I farm whitesprings whenever I get a chance, never dupe and sell all my legendaries to vendor bots. I have a 3 star mutants combat shotty that I'm either gonna try and trade or have already sold to a vendor. Can't remember. 
---
They will often not drop good loot if killed too quickly (and if they run away they drop junk!).  Making sure that they heal and re agro and they give better drops.  
---
I have started carrying some light damage weapons that will not 1shot them for these situations.
---
Ah yeah you can see when a new player is in vault 76. I usually put water on the dead person by the lamp post when I see them inside. I think it's more fun when you get the gear yourself
---
TSE shotguns can't be traded for legitimately?
---
40 of them, is not all that difficult to trade for if you have time to put I to the game and offer a fair deal.
---
No reason to be sorry at all! I enjoyed your comment, as I know nothing of U.S geography. 
---
It was a good explanation as why it might have an ad with the Boston name it, In Watoga. I just don't believe it, personally.
---
Don't have the plans, but they're relatively easy to get from Responder robots when you are past lvl 25. The good places are the train stations in Grafton, Welch and Lewisville. It may take a few server hops to get the stocks to update, but the plans appear quite frequently.
---
Conversely, wait a couple of weeks. Supposedly next patch addresses the issue of vendor stocks and plans. Not sure how, exactly, but it was specifically mentioned in the last news. 
---
Ouch
---
It wouldn't be.  You can have a script run off peak hours (Again, similar to Dark Souls 3) that goes and checks for unique ID copies. That way you don't have anything persistent running. 
---
Oh, ok. Why does that make a ripper better? 
---
&gt; they are slowly (but surely) making this an ideal game
---
Way too soon to make this kind of claim
---
Stories like this are why I‚Äôm on this subreddit. This game is so fun. Can‚Äôt wait to get home from work (17 days) to play again!
---
It is a myth
---
If they have unique identifiers, it would probably, eventually, get out of hand. Really, they could use data mining tools to detect specific patterns across their players' inventory databases, watch the patterns when anomalies are detected, and then correct the issue as well as ban the offenders. 
---
It's easy to track database transactions with tools like Splunk. Most anomalies would appear like massive transactions, anyway. Utilizing tools that monitor container changes that are much larger than a certain threshold is much easier than manipulating a system that's already ok with adding another variable that may cause inventories and drops to consume even more memory to render. Plus, if you go back through and issue the identifiers, it will take a crazy amount of time to reformat already existing inventories, not to mention the stuff that's already there. 
---
This game is drenched in inexperience. I don't think it was wise to give a fledgling, unproven studio a big name like Fallout. I don't know what Bethesda was thinking (I do, it was the Atom Shop).
---
Beauty, I‚Äôve been eyeing it but read mixed reviews on if it works on the x01. For the price of the paint I was scared to test. Guess what I‚Äôm doing after work! Haha 
---
Again drop rates aren't all that matter. 
---
People trade for things. People role play traders in game, and will actively use discord and Reddit to build inventories with multiples of the same item
---
I am SO PISSED I sold my to a robot when it was just level 25.
---
Yeah, I'm kind of actually in the same boat about this. Griefers = raiders. Vigilantes = BOS. Now all we need is some role played RR and Enclave factions and we're pretty much set.
---
Seriously.  I feel like most of my time "playing" is spent in game menus.
---
I was in Whitesprings for a couple hours last night, and it was crash after crash on my Xbox
---
Also play on PS4 here and I respect that you want to do it yourself, I won't just give you stuff but I'll show you how to farm it yourself if you're interested. PSN is txcowboy69 if that sounds like something you're interested in.
---
I want dual sided brick walls...so damn bad, but they will probably make them Atom Shop items...
---
Atom shop purchases fuel future content and keeping the servers running 
---
Damn. I regret it not being an out of touch dog meme now. Politics are boring. 
---
I've recently tried making an alt. Got 10 mins in and went back to main, the vanilla jumping is horrid after playing marsupial
---
Thanks mate! 
---
As a helpful side not you can SKIP this quest. Granted you skip it you can't complete the BoS questline
---
We should play together, at least we'd know what to expect 
---
Sure, but I do both.  Plus, the Cat Lady House is faster - no Scorched annoying you.
---
I have never been in a battle that took more than about 15 minutes, but a friend (who doesn't use Luck Break yet) ran to the shed the other night to repair his broken TSE Gatling Gun, and had a hard time getting to the Bench due to 7 level 45 &amp; under players crowded into the doorway trying to get a hit in while hiding.
---
A similar issue occurs at WS Golf Club where the low level players gather on the wall behind the planter area and try to tag everything with their 10mm SMGs, but won't get off the wall to help spawn more. for those I hope for a Wendigo then use Marsupial to jump over them and leave them to their fate, cause the Wendigo can still get you on top of that wall.
---
I really don't mind that they get on the wall for protection, but if you're going to be there, at least make a run into the Golf Shop to spawn more Ghouls.
---
Something like that. The swedish people have three different votes where we decide which party will have the power to decide in each municipality, the county and lastly the entire country. This means we can have two large towns close to each other being run by two different "rulers" meaning different taxes, better/worse schools, nice or bad roads etc, rich people live in better municipalities.  
---
The problem is that we have fake democracy, even though one party gets most of the peoples votes and should win the other parties then join each other after the voting is done to get more votes in total meaning they can take the power. We have one party that got around 20% of the peoples votes (3rd biggest party in sweden) ** BUT** they are being excluded by every other party just to make sure they get nothing to say. In other words, Sweden is blatantly ignoring the problems and wishes from 20% of our people saying they are idiots and should'nt have a saying in things.  
---
So on Friday we will probably have a government for our whole country, a mixed team if you like consisting of 5!!! different parties, one who got many votes and the others almost got nothing because people don't like them. This leaves out 3 parties, two of them got the 2nd and 3rd highest votes of our people.  
---
Essentially you go into a station, let's say armor to repair your armor. You do whatever you need to and press B, as in on Xbox, until it gives you the option to exit the station. You press A and you exit the station but in a split second you re-enter the station as if you're trying to repair or craft a piece of armor. 
---
It happens to me maybe 3 times since the middle of last month.
---
So you're saying someone was able to successfully trade and build up a stock of 24,000 of the same bobblehead?  Or 1200 of the same TSE rifle?
---
I got it once and accidentally lost it. I still miss it. 
---
Why does everyone just keep chalking up odds vs RNG
---
People trade for items all the time. There's no RNG there. I want this. I trade for it. Rinse repeat. 10 TSE shotguns later.... Start trading em
---
Oh I know! My budget is almost full without a single turret... lol
---
lol i did love it however, did we really pay 60 for a game just to play DMV simulator 2018. i had to go to the DMV today and thought... NOPE and walked out lol.
---
The game should make lock picking and hacking passive and institute a one hour lock out timer for switching a card
---
Could it beeee because you are turning 40 today?
---
I think you just gave more ammo to the "lazy asset flip from Fo4" detractors
---
The "beta" was a farce to begin with. It was two weeks before release. That's not a beta test, it's a hype generation method for a broken game. People still cant even play for long stretches because of constant server disconnects that happen every single play session. That ALONE warrants the title of "unfinished product" 
---
Word thanks mate! 
---
Heh, it's my second explosive weapon to drop. My first was a TSE SMG. I'm holding onto both! =)
---
On paper I considered the +50% more critical damage superior to explosive when my critical rate was 50%. (Ideally, you want a 1% crit chance for 10% damage ratio). Right now explosive is what I believe is the culprit but I will test more tonight. 
---
Meh.  I'm not a fan of impossible construction.  This ain't Fortnite.
---
Ppl know about it so they go there alot.
---
All the well known spots are like that now.
---
when you spawn after fast travel to the back entrance of the enclave bunker, just turn 180¬∞
---
Because Obsidian: Interplay may have sold the IP to Beth, but the heart and soul is still on the West Coast.  Taking something from NV would be admitting something to themselves:. The OG content creators can still do better.
---
Ya, it worked for me. I have a level 50 XO-1 and I added a jet pack to it. It seemed to glitch out in third person but after logging off and back in, it fixed itself. That‚Äôs the only issue that I‚Äôve run into. It‚Äôs worth the purchase, in my opinion. 
---
I started watching Yong when he first started out on YT. He got a shoutout from a channel I liked and I checked him out. I liked his videos and his critical nature when it came to unethical biz practices in gaming. This was probably a year and a half to two years ago (guesstimating here). 
---
At the time what he was doing was novel, at least to me. As time went on we got more and more YT channels that made similar critique videos. Eventually there were dozens of channels all covering the same content with the same negative slant and his content no longer was unique or interesting to me. You could watch any one video from CleanPrince, Laymen, Yong, Downward Thrust etc. and know the other channels vid would offer nothing new. Additionally, these channels all pumped out almost exclusively negative content and I just got tired of it. The dollars started flowing in for negative content about games and they capitalized. 
---
I don‚Äôt blame them for providing what the market demands, but I unsubbed from all of these channels a long time ago. 
---
Not sure why, but I'm on PS4 and have only had 1 crash in the last two weeks or so. Original 500g PS4. Though only get to play weeknights and weekends so not sure if that's a reason or not.
---
Having the option to "hide" or "favorite" perk cards would be a really nice addition and QOL improvement to that part of the UI.
---
Think you could send me a clip of you firing full auto through Xbox live? My gamertag is orgrum.
---
It's still annoying.  I'd rather they have 1 loading screen than 2.  Seems really lazy how they have coded it.  Sometimes it shows the character before loading another screen so it's still vulnerable to attack.
---
No.  Clean your room.
---
I thought this was debunked already.  Does anyone have video evidence of this happening?
---
Closest I've heard is if you're teamed up with someone who is Wanted, you can take full damage if you're not, but that's not specifically Bobblehead stacking.
---
Appreciate you taking the time to reply, its interesting how different countries manage themselves,  the US has gone from a republic, to a democracy to all but an oligarchy. And we are wayyyy younger as a country.
---
Yea I don‚Äôt doubt at least SOME people have died but I think it‚Äôs grossly misunderstood how pvp actually works in this game and what can initiate it. Admittedly even to myself, still learning everyday about what triggers wanted vs pvp vs people seeking revenge, etc.
---
Another thing to watch out for is the 'Diseased' title can override the legendary title.
---
Which is expected in an online game. But that‚Äôs why I server hop.
---
You are so right, when Obsidian got their hands back on Fallout they created new Fallout content - pushed things forward, didnt stand on the original material.
---
YOUR HEADPHONES ARE ON BACKWARDS /s
---
This game stopped being fun for me unfortunately. I still like to check in to this sub every now and then to see if anything good is happening with the game. 
---
Everything feels like a chore though. There‚Äôs so many quality of life changes needed, on TOP of bug fixes, sadly this game I was so hyped for, it didn‚Äôt take long for me to realize that I was logging in to do annoying busy work, then logging out, while having zero fun the whole time. It was just a grind. It *is* just a grind. 
---
(I only made it to level 80 before I got burnt out, but from what I could understand I was in the end game, ready to launch a nuke, then there was the bug making nukes impossible, so I quit and haven‚Äôt booted up since.) 
---
The whole process feels like a giant oversight on BGS part, like a proof of concept pushed out before even becoming an actual finished product. Fuck man. It‚Äôs a shame, there are redeeming aspects of the game, like the map is beautiful. I really wanted this game to be great. Sadly I‚Äôve lost any remaining respect for Bethesda, and I don‚Äôt see it worth while to give them another shot, 76 left a very bitter taste in my mouth, especially after the time and money I put into it. 
---
There are just too many other worthy games and studios deserving of peoples time and money to stick around and *wait* for Bethesda to deliver on promises. 
---
The Grinder is such a great thing. 
---
I don't know about jumping back up, sounds like speculation, but SB and SBQ have explosive dmg resistance. However, even with the resistance, TSE still wrecks havoc.
---
Yea I agree with OP.
---
It never did noticeable damage to the bar and now it does.
---
There was 100% something not working.
---
Anyone who hasn‚Äôt noticed it must have never used one on SQB lol
---
I just farm firecap at Slocum's Joe and blood leaf and snaptail  along the river that runs behind Flatwoods. Can usually make 3 or 4 disease cures with the mats from one run.
---
I know it's lvl 45, but I can't remember the damage right now. 90, I think. The best feature for me, though, is the FAST RoF. When I'm mobbed by Scorched, getting in the hits is more important than hitting the enemy for twice their health.
---
Get a Gatling Gun or. 50 cal gun and become a big gunner like me üòã
---
There is a mod that makes it very easy to save card sets and swap them in and out.
---
haha for sure! i figured anyone taking finals would be in high school or older 
---
It's a design choice created to address the need to allow all characters to (in principle) do everything on the one hand, and the need to give players meaningful character design choices on the other.
---
The former means that, somehow, a single character should be able to do anything without requiring ridiculous amounts of XP earning as in Fallout 4.  The latter means a character shouldn't be able to do all things at one time; they should have to choose what they want to be able to do at the moment.
---
The card system does this, but in my opinion it makes changing abilities too easy.  In too many cases the limit on what your character can do is your tolerance for fiddly UI and tedium, which is poor design.
---
In my view, the ability to swap perk cards should be significantly more limited.  It should only be possible in the vicinity of workshops, CAMPs, and stash boxes.  You can shuffle things all you want when you're in a "safe" location and are doing building, crafting, and trading.  Once you leave that area, you're locked in; choose your adventuring perks wisely.
---
This would force more meaningful choices on players while also reducing tedious card swapping.  If you want to pick locks, you're going to have to sacrifice something else.  Crafting ammo in the field won't receive benefits from Super Duper or Ammosmith unless you choose to go adventuring with them.  It could also make character roles in groups more viable, as you couldn't have everyone doing everything.
---
I used to enjoy his content and he made a big deal about being objective, lately he's become another dime a dozen pundit that just spouts his often badly informed opinions as if it's news and uses awful clickbait editorialized titles. 
---
Started happening a few months before F76 was even out, so it's not something that's only been happening with this game.
---
It's alright on my explosive 10mm submachine gun.
---
Only alright though.
---
I got the game because I like the series, but honestly I think I like FO4 more because of the mods and because having NPCs provide lore is more fun IMO. That's just me though. FO76 is a glitch/disconnect-fest. SUPER annoying.
---
unless they can ban hammer and or level reduce the 100 plus people a day I run into with hacked or duplicated weapons and items they used to max out there toon, gonna be a long way to go. however im super happy they are being active in fixing the gaem and listening to the players.
---
If you server jump will it leave a ‚Äúghost‚Äù of your base that they can destroy? Or does it just pull it and those goons just get bent?
---
That video is far from evidence.
---
They shoot each other and still do no damage to each other. And neither flags.
---
That would mean they both have pacifist mode on....
---
Asd bird bone and faster sprint speed. Ill never go back
---
Cage elevators pls
---
Because 4 star and 5 star legendaries would be better and more in demand, reducing demand for the 2 and 3 star legendaries that were duped. Nobody would want them anymore, or at least not as much.
---
If you introduce new currencies then it reduces the value of caps (which were massively duped). You would need to collect the new currency to get certain in-demand items.
---
You obviously can't totally erase the impact of duping, but you can devalue the stuff that was duped the most by nerfing that stuff and introducing better stuff, and by coming up with new ways to distribute that better stuff.
---
Yes mate
---
Would the RR be a safe haven for dupers lmao?  I don't really know what the Enclave would do, I feel like them and the Brotherhood kinda overlap.
---
How would the enclave faction pan out? People protecting the grief raiders for a bit of the profit and items?
---
What was said about they and what you said when they said it
---
He was really wanting some extra carry weight so I figured I would help him. He did complete the quest and knows that he can build the parts at lvl35 and 45, so he'll get that there.
---
It makes sense, kinda how you only want either lone wanderer or action boy/girl since there are diminishing returns, it would be awesome if critical banker was a perk in this game, and you could save up multiple criticals, I've always been the type to absolutely maximise damage, even sacrificing quality of life perks for a small diminishing return. I just want to see those MAX numbers. So for me max rank bloody mess, nerd rage, and demolition expert are staples in my build and I cannot bring myself to swap them for anything. 
---
we demand an hour long buff after hanging her head outside Stormwind in a grand procession!
---
Yeah, you can shortcut it by going straight to Enclave. I saw a lvl 6 inside the Enclave bunker once, shopping. Totally floored me. Still, if you want to actually finish the entire main quest, that quest has to be done. 
---
I've found a few two shot guns, and a few explosive ones, but exactly zero TSEs. 
---
Fuck these wannabe white hat vigilantes, they're as bad as the dupers themselves.
---
where can I get this mod for xbox?  Thanks.
---
\*laughs in level 18\*
---
sonofa...
---
I was doing some cleanup, and sold hundreds last night to a vendor.
---
Go to any school. Morgantown High School can net you almost 100 plastic.
---
Yea when I get on tonight I will. Since the patched fixed combat rifle receivers I switched over to Commando and found I can kill a scorchbeast in less than one magazine with a 1\* zealot's. I'll video that.
---
What platform
---
Have you used it in coniunction with strange in numbers? Lol.
---
Its crazy.
---
Why don't you guys flag when you shoot each other?
---
Do you both have pacifist on?
---
Portable repair kits are just another bullet point on a fairly long list of things that 100% should have been in this game at launch that just... Aren't.
---
Yep, I'm aware.  I like to hit up Morgantown HS, then swing by the Cat Lady's House for some bonus plastic.  :)
---
Once you get used to marsupial and speed demon on a main and go to an alt fucking hell its miserable 
---
If you build a floor on the outside of your wall, you will be able to rotate your wall so the outside is facing in. Then you just remove the floor on the outside. 
---
I'll show you dickless.
---
Thanks!  I'll keep that in mind when I do a melee build!
---
Yes, let's make it even More tedious and annoying. 
---
waaaaaaaaa.....why can't I get a 3 star legendary on my 1st legendary kill....waaaaaaaaa. These posts need to go  /s
---
No problem! I am more than willing to help anybody try to optimize and discover new optimization for their builds, were gonna need it when the other vaults open!
---
the best mod, really. I can't think of any that come close for improving the game.
---
Lolz it would‚Äôve been a great YouTube vid.
---
It‚Äôs like a Greek tragedy or comedy of errors
---
...and the stash limit thus becomes even more annoying!  
---
Mules, upon mules, of worthless 1* legs waiting to re-craft! :)
---
Did you say....Girls watch out! watch out! watch out! there is a two legged animal walking about
---
Agreed. Bring this back, too. Along with repair kits.
---
They have a chance to drop either 1* 2 * or 3* items. If they just dropped 3* items all the time then nothing would be worth farming for.
---
The Truth. The truth never changes. 
---
Especially with incendiary ammo!
---
Gk to the asylum and get the buckets 
---
Ok i kind of get the idea of 4-5 star legendary bit ( as long as the dupers dont find a way of copying them too)
---
But introducing a new currency when caps have been the staple of fallout games from the beginning would be difficult to implement lore wise, it's like saying septims aren't the currency anymore in eldar scrolls  
---
So you're saying your friend is a duper and we should believe you?  Umm, no.  But in either case, regardless, slap damage should always be capped cause its just a good idea anyways.
---
If you're going to let a couple idiots ruin your fun, then online games aren't for you. Stick to single player.
---
In my nearly unplayable fight with her last night SBQ actually spent most of the time on the ground and nearly every player was using an Explosion variant weapon.
---
It would be epic if we could "color" each piece ourselves in RGB and add patterns. You would have infinite variety and customization. A "paint shop" where we could colorize our armor.
---
Also T-60 BoS initiate paint and Shielded Marine Plans. I would assume the other paints will eventually drop from this too when they're actually added to the loot tables and not taken from the QA room.
---
In FO4 You can get BOS OD GREEN for your PA. As long as you have the mats to paint.
---
No Purchase needed, batteries not included
---
Where is the emotional investment in the story? Which dead bodies by the wayside do you care about while shooting the next Scorchbeast? Who are you saving, and from what grisly fate? What would happen if you simply weren't there? Who would suffer and why do we care about them?
---
Imagine Skyrim but the dragons already killed everyone and the only quests come from scratchings on walls and charred notes.
---
Repair kits need to come back. Preferably with the ability to completely repair a weapon, maybe based on perk levels.
---
&gt;It's obvious that the game sold nowhere near what it was suppose to sell due to the lack of human npcs.
---
Where in the fuck did you get that idea? I have a feeling there are *very* few people who didn't purchase it due to that. There are still NPC's in the game.
---
Oof. That‚Äôs a feelsbadman
---
My .50 is my main during that event. Love that thing. But I just didn't wanna be chucking my nuke grenades when it's not really helping the team bring her down. 
---
You didn‚Äôt watch the video *sigh* please watch the video before commenting on it. Guy getting shots starts at 100 hp, proceeds to take 240k slap damage til about 75% full
---
I roam around with a dragon and gatling gun wearing a bowler hat and civil war suit indiscriminately blasting any wanted player in the face. What am I?
---
You are now John wicks rifle toting father from a parallel universe 
---
I get the extra load screen and still get invisible enemies afterwords.
---
Man you're lucky.
---
I did see a thread on here stating +crit damage raises ap costs of crit shots.
---
Not really a big issue with high agi and pipe weapons.
---
I run an anti armor explosive bolt action pipe as with a stock it benefits from rifle perks. But only 6 shots which i easily go thru with enough targets to splat.
---
Have a nice *day...*
---
Love how this is at -4 even though its true.
---
To be completely honest the regular harpoon gun with flechettes is kinda op even without two shot or explosive. It‚Äôs literally a heavy shotgun sniper. Not much you can do against that in pvp if you are wanted. Can pretty easily hit 600+ damage with a regular harpoon gun so you really don‚Äôt need tse unless you just like overkill. Which I do, but that‚Äôs not the point. Explosive isn‚Äôt as necessary for pvp as you think.
---
It started around the time of the Metal Gear: Survive drama (which closely mirrors fo76's drama. Spinoffs just aren't popular anymore!) from what I remember
---
I want a legendary chainsaw 
---
Jist sayin
---
It doesn't make sense because they wouldn't advertise keeping Boston running down in WV.

It's a franchise based in an apocalypse where limbs go flying and everyone dies to plague.  The franchise went multiplayer and pvp is a way to do that.  The only thing dumb about it is the slap damage instead of just full damage.  MOST fans aren't playing due to bad reviews and bugs.  I'm not sure how you can speak for them.  That said, this subreddits has a particular carebare crowd to it, I'll give you that.  Which pushes people that like pvp away.  Does not mean they won't crush your camp, just that they won't be posting it on this sub because it will just get downvoted lol.  Now I haven't done any pvp in this game myself other than kill a wanted guy who was attacking my camp, but I'll never understand the desire to lessen the pvp aspect of this game any more than it is. For such a violent storyline and premise it's so odd to have such a mindset and also enjoy such a storyline.  It's not like the single player fallouts just dissapeard.   Stop trying to change the fundamental gameplay of this one just because you like the gameplay of another.  You don't play Monopoly co-op.  Pvp is a game mode (Monopoly will cause more rage than this ever will - yet people still play it).  All I'm saying is don't go into a monopoly game asking for co-op.  Just play a co-op only game xD
---
yup. And the rest...
---
What are you talking about?
---
Why didn't they tell us about this earlier?
---
They have explosive resistance? Damn,that sucks. So am I just wasting my nuke grenades on her?
---
But how would OP farm Karma?
---
Or have some other benefit. Why doesn't scrapper highlight junk with components you've tagged? Something like that for every perk card that's too situational right now would be good.
---
Thinly veiled complaining about not being able to have all perks active all the time. 
---
Sorry, but that's just the way I see it.
---
I have a lot of fun in this game, while not even worrying about perks. That's probably because I don't try to min max the shit out of every game I play like so many of you seem to do.
---
space of two wastes.
---
I have been playing since launch and only level 40. I think people went the easy xp and equipment route and screwed themselves. I have a few pcs. of armor a hardened snirer rifle and a few shotguns. The game seems pretty tough when you don't cheat yourself. 
---
I have been trying to do it with only stuff i get and not tag mobs with one hit to get legendary crap or 600 xp per kill. I knew i was going to stop to smell the roses in this game. The world is to nice to rush through and its a challenge trying to conserve ammo and stims to make it to the next level of power. When i get a perk card pack its like christmas when your a kid.
---
That would be waaaay too funny!
---
Agree, those three may not even be part of this community
---
Too much work, I would not mind it if I could do 3 or 4 presets.
---
Combat
---
Recovery
---
Travel
---
Crafting....
---
Something like that.
---
They can only run scripts if the data lives on their servers. If it lives in a Abe file on my HD they would have to do the writing as part of a patch. And assigning those unique ids could stop duping going forward by not retroactively.
---
Items are also such a big part of the game that quite a bit of code will need to be rewritten to account for them.  Well, that or expect to see every item in your ‚ÄúAid‚Äù menu unstacked.
---
My favorite part was the named ghoul showing up, whose name was J28 or whatever number it was that was given "last call" over the intercom after not showing up for 20-something years. My favorite quest so far!
---
Except "you" died like three times more than I did :)
---
Or simply allow dupers to learn new methods ahead of the patches being applied and not reporting them.  Normally, a PTS would be a good idea.  For this game, I'm not so sure.
---
Lets be real, Carnivore is the only one that really matters..
---
It's a matter of perspective. The party he's talking about is a xenophobic nationalist party with nazi roots that constantly have to let people go because they get caught making hateful comments online by the media. They are just nationalist hardliners that are putting on a softer image to gain the family votes. 
---
Let's do a raider-style witchhunt of the SJW's on there. Full fuck it.
---
I did watch it.
---
2 guys shooting each other in pacifist mode.
---
Pacifist mode reduces outgoing damage.
---
I asked the creator the same question.
---
I don't think you know what "tedious" means.  And by "annoying" I assume you mean "I won't be able to have a 100% combat optimized build *and* get all the non-combat card benefits at the same time".
---
TBF, it does increase the excitement of finding them. If I already have a strength one and find one, in your system, it's "Oh, I already have them all, I don't need this. Yawn". 
---
That argument is already lazy as it is.
---
Plan is called advanced power connections, or something to that effect.
---
Craft a new one, u should have the plans
---
Prefer to dump the Perk Card system, feel very strongly about this.
---
Just move to "skill tree" system.
---
Shhhh dont tell anyone
---
As much as I love this game, I feel like you may be overestimating the size of the community a bit. 
---
You are the enemy of the people
---
I don't even bpther running Pharma Farma and then every once in awhile I'm scrolling down my aid menu and then go "fuck 200 stimpacks again‚Äîtime to drop 100 or so I guess..."
---
No problem, facts are always interesting rather than complains that often are misguiding.  
---
Oligarchy does'nt work at all in Sweden due to everyone joining forces to stop each other **BUT** what does work in this country is to promise a lot of stuff that sounds good even though there's no way it will work. Unfortunately not many people are interested in politics and swedish people are also extremely acquiescent, timid and loves to go with the flow, this means that a lot of people votes for what everyone else in their closeness does without have a clue of what they are doing
---
I need me one of them TSE gatlings...
---
Mines a shack in the middle of a glue farm. Yours looks much better 
---
If you can deal with a level 100 something almost-past squeaker who wont be in for 4hours I'm down. GT is AnyAPerson420
---
I'm shocked that the recycling of assets was poorly done!  It's almost like,.how could they expect a two shot exploding shotgun from Fallout 4 would behave exactly the same way when they copied it into Fallout 76?!
---
I was getting some weird sound issues but I discovered it was due to Win10 and setting that particular sound device to 5.1 versus stereo. Was essentially only hearing the center channel. 
---
Or a portable repair bench you can deploy as a one use setup, lasts an hour before despawning.
---
I would have told them simply in my best English accent "Begone foul trolls, you will find no goats here!" Then hit them with my Rocket Sledge! 
---
Tell you the truth am enjoying the community on 76, arsehats included! They make the game interesting! 
---
Quests like this help remind me why we need weapons with the Troubleshooter (+30% damage to robots) modifier. Payback!
---
New Vegas had three different currencies. Fallout 76 has candy. Alternative currencies already exist in the game.
---
I'm not suggesting that we completely replace the Cap, just that we introduce additional currencies that can be used to buy specific things.
---
World of Warcraft still functions under a gold standard currency but has hundreds of secondary currencies that it uses for all sorts of things.
---
If I'm not mistaken I read something that a content update will introduce presidential seals that can be traded for high level stuff. That's the kind of thing I'm talking about.
---
Theyre not. West virginia is part of the eastern commonwealth and Boston is in the New England commonwealth. 
---
While we're at it, FO3's capital wasteland is in the Columbia commonwealth. 
---
you need an old one to craft a new one
---
I would be happy if they stay in the game, because I'm not blaming them - I'm blaming Bethesda. If they get banned, oh well doesn't matter.
---
If you don't release a broken mess, you won't get people using exploits. Simple as that.
---
I think the ppl have hack and dupe here will move on to the next game they can exploit as they're bored with this one.
---
First you have to do a little physical mod on the Xbox. It involves attaching a "for sale" sign.
---
Then buy a PC. ;)
---
but seriously, I forget there are console players in this game. 
---
Maybe some Abbath facepaint (since they seem to have the Crow?), spiked gauntlets, a firey spiked mace, something dead or decaying, anything.
---
I think we were a little too hopeful...  guess we'll have to wait for October 31st...
---
Apparently you broke the console version. 76 on ps4 is crashing every 5-10 minutes today.
---
I ovoid exactly what it means. And yes, that is what I mean. It's annoying enough that you have to use half your points on weight reduction bullshit to even play the game. 
---
Bring back the ballistic fist!!! And the Pushglove thingy, and the bumper sword, and the rebar club, and the Riot armour (ALL VARIANTS PLZ)...
---
#BUT BRING BACK THE BALLISTIC FIST!!!!!
---
That's the definition of anomaly in science: something unexpected considering the data you have.
---
&gt; An example could be that we expect all of our observations to be the heights of kindergarten students, but one of the observations is the height of the kindergarten teacher - then the teacher‚Äôs height is an anomaly. However if we were interested in the heights of all the students and of the teacher, we would anticipate and use the height of the teacher also - and in that case, the teacher's height would not be an anomaly. An observation of 0 would indicate a serious measurement error, and would still be an anomaly, though
---
We expect that no two weapons are the same. If there is an exact match, that is an anomaly. It doesn't mean the person is cheating, it just means something unusual and unexpected happened and may need to be investigated. 
---
Have to promote my channel is all man. I am very passionate with what I do. If you watched it thanks. and yes to answer your question. That and I get straight to the point in my vids as to not waste time.
---
Did I now?
---
The quest itself is kind of similar to swedish bureacracy, like trying to find a specific blue form to fill in and having to call around to 5 different separate entities that keep redirecting you to other people.
---
After doing a Nuke Zone in Charleston, my first thought was "*This would be much better if I were following that quest right now*", since the mobs seem to re-spawn every time you come back in.
---
There was a post here yesterday or the day before that showcased stacking bobble head explosive damage.  The damage numbers on the guys gun after stacking were insane.
---
ayyyooo thanks much appreciated 
---
In the likes of Destiny you don't need trading because you can dismantle the shit you don't want for materials. F76 doesn't let you do that with legendaries and we're extremely limited on how much we can sell to vendors. 
---
How about they just fix the whole server rollback thing that the dupers are exploiting?
---
oic.   I have a PC, I just bought it xbox so I could sofa play (and my doggo demands sofa cuddles).
---
I'm a level 78 running shotgun and rifles. 12 str 9 per and at least 3 in agi to get enforcer maxed out. I have all three shotgun perks maxed and 2 rifle perks maxed and the boost in str is to run melee as well.
---
tbf you can make so much .50 ammo it's not even funny. I feel like that balances out the .50 hunting rifle being weak.
---
Seriously, got Ammosmith rank 2? 180 rounds for a pittance of lead, gunpowder, and steel.
---
Clearly we need a middle fimger emote because that one will better catch their attention and be less likely to ignore you and walk away.
---
[https://discord.gg/4d6xP4](https://discord.gg/4d6xP4) Come have a chat or read our lore :)
---
any time glad you enjoyed.
---
Honestly never seen it happen since release but know it would suck to endure such a thing.
---
You can also sell junk that's not scapped. Just throwing that out there.
---
Save your Caps Love, I server hopped at Welch yesterday and got it - lvl 112.
---
but what about the poor innocent players that don't know that these are duplicated dev room items and buys them 
---
I'm not trying to be the hero. There are a million bad games where you could save the world. I'm just a guy looting through the carnage and trying to make it work till help comes.
---
PC users have the ability to save different configs by pressing alt and a number. I think it's only up to 5. If you look at the special menu on a PC, you'll see the option at the bottom. 
---
I've noticed it by looking at youtube videos by PC users. 
---
Is VATs aiming with gauss rifle still terrible?
---
Don‚Äôt have a gauss in my stash to test it right now 
---
Ok wow, I don‚Äôt think you understand what the issue is with your statement. The uploader. is NOT in pacifist. So he has a 240k shotgun and is using it on a player that IS in pacifist. They prove he is in pacifist because they start the video with him shooting the uploader for 0 damage. So what we have now is a HIGHLY buffed non pacifist player shooting a player in pacifist. These people claim that that should be grounds to 1 shot kill the other player but he proves that‚Äôs still not possible.
---
It's the edgy 16-year-old's definition of free speech.
---
I've got a Gatling Plasma that seems to like it. 
---
That was  beautifully, annoyingly perfect.
---
Only if real money sales dry up
---
I don't think it's technically a bug, just a lot of lag.
---
Not really if you have magnetic personality at rank 2 that's plus 2 Charisma per teammate and since the hacker and lockpick perks do not stack you only need 3 charisma to actually share it since you can only share 1 perk at a time
---
It‚Äôs Anti-MaterIEL, not Anti-MaterIAL rifle. 
---
Materiel means military hardware, like trucks, generators, etc. 
---
Anti-Material rifle should fire antimatter =) 
---
Don‚Äôt take it as being a smartass, i just think its a cool military fact. 
---
On the senty bots it works 100% was level 30 and took out a lvl 60 that way
---
[PC] kinda curious on why accounts are being temp suspended for people just having the dev items considering half the people that have em don‚Äôt know there dev items and think there just rare cosmetics
---
Link fixed sorry if the link was not working for some of you. should be now though
---
Definitely works on sentry bots. Done it many a time.
---
It's the law's definition bud.
---
Here's a unpopular idea, give refunds = less cheaters.
---
Nice great find 
---
Agreed. 
---
I've heard of ppl using a syringer and a chem the reduces dmg resistance by 25% so she goes down faster. I have to look into it for details
---
I know that I was just saying compared to the scenario he presented where they do nothing but "help" by slowly clearing mobs that any well-equipped player can easily deal with themself.
---
I agree with you on this, and have said the same thing. I think they‚Äôll wear out, then the legitimate and enthusiastic Fallout fans will remain. The duped items are out there, but I‚Äôm hoping we‚Äôll see the impact of them lessen over time.
---
I see you too, found the toilet corn. That corn began a long line of adhesive producing vegetables for me.
---
Honestly can't remember the other currencies in foNV it's been that long since I've played it lol, candy? 
---
I was in one last night and had her down to 50% in the first three minutes.  Then, every level 20 on the server, and their baby sister all showed up at once lol.  Still managed to bring her down somehow with less than 40 seconds on the clock.  That scaling damage resistance is almost too much.
---
Between the reputation of "all kink" and the (in)practicalities of doing anything in the game engine way back when (huh, didn't know they open sourced it), I was astounded to find it was still running. I kinda assumed back in 2006 it would be dead in a few years.
---
Nah, your not seeing it. But that‚Äôs ok, not everyone has your play-style.  
---
By taking on the mobs, it frees up the higher level players with better guns so they can focus on the SBQ. 
---
Even with adrenal, just stand by a fissure, it‚Äôll lower your health just fine. 
---
Find power armor around the map, they usually have fusion cores in the chassis. There is a map here that shows most power armor &amp; fusion core locations: fo76map.com
---
no one uses explosive bait anymore?
---
I‚Äôve had this happen when my stash was huge because I had just scrapped all of the items in my camp that kept being duplicated when that was a bug a while ago. I had hundreds of corn and tatos and fertilizer and mutfruit in there (and the stash box weight was something like 300 over the max.) Once I got rid of all of the extras the lag went away.
---
There's even stuff on some roofs that aren't normal jump accessible. 
---
How many hours do you play in a week?
---
The meta is using 2h to handle Hard Peter...
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll show myself out. 
---
Did this last night and wanted to throw my controller at the TV
---
I have a level 25 (or was it 35) lever action I can give away to you
---
Neat fact, upvote for not being hostile about it. I think people get the point though.
---
Wait, but I was explicitly told that I was SOL when I deleted the wrong character because they had no tools that allowed them to interact with characters on a direct level. 
---
So...now they do?
---
Nope, launch day ps4
---
My game crashed near the end of it and I had to do it all again. Fuck, that was horrible.
---
Lmao, mine is UNDER that same bridge. 
---
Definitely a squirrel 
---
My old pit stop camp looked like this with an added outdoor toilet :)
---
However it didn‚Äôt allow you to close the toilet cabin while sitting on the loo and when you stand to close the cabin, your character had no space to have the sitting animation 
---
Even with that, since I have it maxed, the extra points do not count towards your overall charisma. Unless they fixed it. You still need 3/6/9 charisma in your original pool in order to share perks. 
---
Which perks?
---
Thanks I'll definitely check this out
---
The bayonet on it seems unusually powerful, too! I'm not sure if it's just me or if it isn't commonly known since the bayonet is kind of rare and bashing isn't usually very useful, but it's really fun.
---
Then maybe this game isn't for you, since you're not supposed to be able to have a 100% combat optimized build and do everything else as the same time.  It's part RPG, and that means making choices about what your character can do, and it's part survival game, which means there's a lot of stuff to do that's not combat-related.
---
Suspending any account over that amount doesn't just ban dupers, it bans customers. That could be any joe schmoe who got a friendly bag and ignorantly kept it. 
---
That's a different approach to what we're talking entirely. That's some serious potential cross fire I just don't see happening. Bans will likely fall on those with definite evidence of the act of duping. This has been pervasive for months and months. Trade discords are full of liars pretending to be legit selling duped everything. 
---
Just not even a question. The item filter we're talking would never be the ban hammer, and the amount of items it'd catch to delete would be so damn high that there's no way they'd have the man power to audit that many accounts.
---
Fact of the matter is, there simply isn't going to be a log or definite marker on an account for Bethesda to look back at all the way to release in order to to feel comfortable enough to ban and alienate a customer(s) over it. A duper and an ignorant player would not have any differentiation that they could see.
---
You can't make an entertainment industry product business decision along the lines of "there will be casualties" for the sake of a quick fix for balance. You can't consider a situation where "as little as possible legitimate accounts" are effected. It's wayyyyyyy too sensitive. 
---
There's other avenues to take to fix it while maintaining the health of the game. Ban waves that catch beyond the clearly obvious sounds like such a dangerous idea. If I was in a board room talking about how to handle this and someone suggested that, I'd ask them not to come back to the next meeting unless it needed technical input. That attitude has no place in company-customer impact relations.
---
I was on PS4 after the update yesterday by myself in WS. I stabbed a 3 star ghoul with my spear his health went back up I stabbed him again his health went back up again I hit him twice then n killed him. It dropped a 1 Star Death Tambo. I killed several regular legendary ghouls later with no legendary drop n occasionally I would kill a regular ghoul n find random 1 Star legendary wood armor or leather armor. I do agree it‚Äôs really frustrating not finding appropriate legendary stuff.
---
SBQ ;)
---
Saaaaaame.
---
I found I got enough flux from running the Queen a few tunes to build the arch.
---
Radchicken. Little bastards are fast....
---
heh, I wish I got stuff like that from them.
---
So, is there a particular circuit or something you follow in Watoga? I only know of one place that often has a legendary, and was wondering if it's location based or truly random.
---
Maybe the slap system is just a bad idea in the first place and servers should be regulated between PvP and PVE. 
---
8 to 12 hours

Well lets look at that assertion about "thousands of players". Estimates are that Fallout 76 sold 1.4 million copies as of mid-December. Estimates put the "queer" population in the US around 3.5%. If we assume similar global numbers, that's around 49,000 players who are gay, lesbian, or bisexual. With the explosion of that video, we can easily assume that 10% of players heard about it, but probably a lot more. 4,900 players just to be as aggressive as possible with these numbers. That would mean that less than  20% of offended parties would need to take action for a one thousand player impact. Lets be more realistic though. The LGBTQ community is typically very vocal and active. They're known to stand by the courage of their convictions, and vote with their wallets.
---
Let's be a little more generous with our numbers. A more current analysis says 4.5% of people identify as LGBT. 63,000 players. Now lets say a viral incident reaches half of them. 31,500 players. Now we say 20% of a typically very active community takes action and leaves Bethesda entirely. 6,300 players. What if, every person who left had one ALLY leave with them. That's 12,600 players.
---
Without actually working in the video game statistics industry, I don't have hard numbers for this next part. I'm a hobbyist in economics, so I'll do my best to be honest here. Each and every customer has a lifetime value score. How much money will they make the company in their lifetime. 2 games at full price? $120? What about other merch and micro transactions? $200? $300? I've heard some companies can expect up to $2,000 per customer, liftime. I can personally attest that I will conciously spend $60/year on a game that receives reliable content updates and remains fun to play. I'm worth $120 to Bethesda just for fallout 76 if they can keep my interest for a year. Lifetime I've spend upwards of $500 on the fallout franchise alone. Nevermind the elder scrolls and other properties. Just at 20% of the LGBT community they stand to lose a million dollars this year on the low end.
---
If you doubt my math, do some research on how Subaru finally succeeded in the US market. Spoilers: It was by subtly marketing to lesbians back in the.... 70/80s I think. May have included the 90s.
---
That's how business decisions are made. Give a guy a bunch of statistics and have him model the backlash of incidents like this. Companies have spent millions knowing how things like this affect their bottom line, and they act accordingly.
---
If you disagree with the way companies handle this type of business, then I would challenge you to stand by the courage of your convictions, and vote with your wallet. 
---
Don't do any of that in any of my videos. Unlike some I do not waste peoples time. but hey thanks for your opinion I feel the same way for the most part. Cheers-
---
Yeah, the New California Republic used Dollars, and the Legion used silver and gold coins. You can add poker chips to that too if you want to be really technical.
---
Yeah, there's an event in Watoga where you collect candy to get stuff out of a vending machine.
---
Didn't know that about the fissure lowering health.  Unfortunately, she's almost never close enough to a fissure due to people being in the shed =P.  But, I'll try that when I can.
---
Maybe you are right about some people needing help clearing out the adds, though it's not really an issue for me and the guys I run with.  We have a significantly harder time when the event gets bloated with non combatants.
---
Opossum! But hey at least they make good bacon.
---
Still junk for sure but all two shots are pretty bad
---
Robo brain?
---
If it looks like a duck?
---
Did they fix the invisibility thing?
---
Whenever my friend and I are on a team, we are invisible to one another.
---
What help?
---
static meaning each one had only one potential source point, and each after that was either from the same place or duplicated. 
---
ensures that we know there's literally 0 legitimate versions available of them.
---
It was Bethesda's idea first though. Weapon repair kits are just renamed and remodeled alien epoxy from Mothership Zeta.
---
But why let facts get in the way of a good ol' Obsidian circlejerk.
---
Yeah, I understand. I still think it‚Äôs a shame though, and ended up just dropping all my government supply requisitions. They might not have dropped anything great especially for higher levels, but it was still exciting to stumble upon one I didn‚Äôt request and get a canned dog food, maybe even a stimpack. The little things. 
---
I wonder if they have any intention of packing them with goodies later on.
---
Scrapped junk should just weigh 0 to begin with, I'd even be OK with carry weight and stash weight being reduced to keep balance if they implemented it. 
---
Exactly. There needs to be some sort of DPS check - like the old hammer-hit-the-bell carnival event. If you can't do X dps, you can't get in the event... It would block some of the support builds, but there needs to be something else.
---
I'm on PC and Whitespring is a crashfest for me since this latest patch.
---
" This could be implemented as simple as: Junk weighs 0 in the stash. "
---
No. Its nots that simple.
---
I wish the Camo paint for Combat Armor was for all Military Armors.
---
Super annoying when you're trying to sell multiple of the same item to vendors
---
Heavy Guns can get armor piercing via Stabilized as well, though it requires wearing PA and yeah that minigun doesn't last very long (think I gunned down about 5 mole miners before it broke). 
---
But it's outdoors, I mean - anywhere is a toilet.
---
&gt;This could be implemented as simple as: Junk weighs 0 in the stash.
---
Bethesda Devs: Oh shit is that all we need to do? Damn why didn't we think of that!
---
Has happened on multiple servers today 
---
Mole Rat or Blood Bug.
---
I'd love to see A LOT of the weapons from older games come back, really. I mean, heck, they don't even have any 'ordinary' semi-automatic pistols, despite them being visible on a couple of the perk cards. And, last I knew, World War 2 was canon to the Fallout timeline... do they really think not any of the survivalist types found in the Free States would have held on to a classic 1911 .45?
---
Are you using rank 3 Thru Hiker? If so it won't work. 90% is max. 
---
the toy bonus caps out at 10; so no one will be duping toys
---
Omg I just did that quest and I think I laughed through the whole thing 
---
I‚Äôm also scouting for the jet pack with the enclave dude, that with marsupial seems so fun!!
---
If you played 3 hours without using a bed and died, that's on you. There's nowhere in that game that's not within 5 minutes of a bed.
---
If you‚Äôre asking which perks are now working that were previously not, that I don‚Äôt know but I imagine it was tank killer as the dmg numbers haven‚Äôt changed. If you‚Äôre asking what my perk load out is. It‚Äôs rifleman/adrenal for the queen.
---
I understand that. I‚Äôm lvl 120 now...this is something new going on
---
Welp i concede then. I didn't notice the uploaders health not moving and mechanically that makes sense.
---
So the one shots are just team related at this point basically.
---
Or some hoax/unproven thing. 
---
Suck my dick

~Todd Howard
---
My point is that in a democracy you should'nt exclude people like they are doing, over 50% of the people actually want the other parties to at least talk with our nationalist party. It's like you say, a matter of perspective. It's good that those existing problems that Sweden have now have a larger focus and for that we actually needed our "nationalist party" but now they can go away, they have laid the foundation.  
---
TIL about that event lol do you get any nice stuff? ( not surprised I didn't know about that event I tend to avoid cranberry bog like the plague lol)
---
*STAN BUSH INTENSIFIES*
---
Since seeing that post, I tested it myself, and found it to be bs. I get crappy 1 star items from 3 star enemies, whether I let them heal or not.
---
Honestly I did too. It‚Äôs amazing it‚Äôs held out this long when it‚Äôs death is predicted year after year. But honestly it‚Äôs not all crap and there‚Äôs just enough fun and good community there to keep it juuust hanging on even if it‚Äôll never really grow again. 
---
I find Grounded to be helpful. Energy weapons are trash, so having lower damage doesn't matter, and the +100 energy resist is great for reducing damage from robots.
---
Also, if you have 3 PER to spare I find Glow Sight to be a game changer in nuke zones. +60% damage boost to glowing things makes it easy to one shot the bloated ones even if you don't have some god roll weapons.
---
Drop a nuke on mama dolce! TONS of flux items if you use Green Thumb and Super Duper when refining. And then head into the town to kill glowing ones for the non-flux prereqs.
---
Only the lvl 62 has pacifist mode on.
---
Unless something changed that's not how pacifist mode works, though. Players can still do damage to you, you just can't damage them. It really only prevents accidental PvP, like grenade splash damage or friendly fore, it doesn't make you immune to player damage.
---
I do agree it should though. Both for you and your base. 
---
PvP is an optional challenge system anyways. Nobody can really kill me if I don't fight back anyways so why take damage at all?
---
Nice. Loading sound is that low pitched shit they do when they're squaring up. Empty sound is hissing.
---
The vendor cap limit is only meant to extend the grind, which is just an arbitrary design decision. All it does is make the game more tedious and less fun. 
---
I have a few legendary weapons that ignore 50% of armor for enemies including an auto grenade launcher.
---
Seems this is already a thing.
---
prob better off having someone turn off pacify and getting PVP bounties to annoy the AFK'ers.
---
It can't tell you why kids like Cinnamon Toast Crunch...
---
Hey, you be you man hehe. Just know you might get downvoted for calling people liars without proof that they're lying. Cheers!
---
Eyebot for sure. 
---
Nice, I had heard it was level locked like the handmade plans. I hadn't seen it again til yesterday, though I wasn't actively looking for it.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. They need to take a different approach to "skill check" perks
---
Then you‚Äôre not equipped for the fight, and shouldn‚Äôt be there.
---
Turning up like that just ruins it for everyone else.
---
Not if is bloodied
---
Bethesda Executive: Hire this man, right now.
---
Thanks for copying my video pal üëç
---
1 robot and 1-2 pc  to not ruin the immersion  \^ \^
---
they don't think it be like it is, but it thru tho
---
So it's not just me, then? I'm always confused by the loading screen hint claiming it's the next best thing to Power Armor, yet the in-game stats don't seem anywhere near as good as plain Combat Armor...
---
&gt; from this moment on I stop to play this game. What a toxic jerk community.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
She would drop a drill.
---
Had something similar, in my case I had to close app and re enter
---
That would be bad, then I could just use a minigun
---
Thanks, I just had a blast killing SBQ‚Äôs yesterday with it. 5 fights 5 fast kills only used about 100 prime rounds per fight and didn‚Äôt even have to repair it very often
---
That quest glitched for me and I had to do it twice. I had gotten to the end of it the first time but there wasn‚Äôt a quest marker to go anywhere
---
Thank you for this. I've saved the comment to spread the word.
---
It was linked to me to prove me wrong which it does.
---
Your hp not moving shows the other is in pacifist mode.
---
And thats saying nothing for people that do White springs server hopping. I remember before Duplication was a major issues vendors used to hop servers repeatedly for VATS hand made rifles thats all they would look for sure if the found a TSE they would keep it but the 10,000 caps was on the Vats so it was not uncommon too see someone with 100 vats hand made rifles from farming them    
---
Yeah ok buddy. Your gate keeping skills are more effect than heavy weapons. But you keep being a delusional moron all you want. 
---
I took these photos in beta to demonstrate a bug I'd found, and I swear, it never uses the top one, always the bottom one on loading screens. [https://imgur.com/a/Klp1DiX](https://imgur.com/a/Klp1DiX)
---
And I know, I could always delete it...
---
Except that you sent factoring in that just because they make up that percentage of the population does not mean that they make up that percentage of players. You have good points but here is the thing, let's say your numbers are correct. The people who get offended by things very rarely actually boycott the product. I have plenty of gay friends, none of which were offended but that is besides the point. Take chick fil a for example they had a contraversy with the LGBT community some time back and they did not suffer any less significant enough to be quantifiable. I feel that he type of people who get offended enough to boycott someone over not censoring others likely aren't playing a game franchise with common themes of rape, murder, and death anyway. Again you're points are solid but not enough of their playerbase is sensitive enough for that to make them quite.
---
The idea of capping the vendor bots AND having them offer what, 5c on the $1? is overkill. I'm literally sitting on about 2k caps, the same I have for the entire game because I don't trade with the bots. There is no reason to. Except for plans, the world provides.
---
I also couldn't be arsed to visit 7 different vendors to max my caps. Batter things to do. 
---
When I see a group hiding in the shed, I go join them. Let them know that *nothing* will be done while they sit there (I don't think any of then get it, but it makes me feel better).
---
Grow up?  Really?  wow...   I see that your moral compass is also off.  A truly moral person would had instead have said, "Hey, so people were hacking the game.  Bethesda is locking people will pilfered good, if you have items X, Y or Z, hold on to them and try to remember who you bought them from.  Let's put a stop to people screwing up a game we enjoy."  but you refuse to see it that way.  You're thinking, hey... just a little hacking, what's the harm....  just a few pixels... hell TSE's are just a few lines of code.  You're on a slippery slope.  Maybe you should be the one to Grow up, shut up and listen.  Please feel free to respond.  I'm done after this but I know your ego will make you have the last word.  I encourage it.  It's the only way you can think you were right.  
---
Haven't played in a while;
---
That bug was around from launch day on, probably started from lag (whether from server traffic, or duping/etc).  It's probably some kind of desync that doesn't allow you to craft because the server doesn't think you're close enough to actually use that station.
---
what *can* fix it: open the map/pipboy or whatever action causes the station menu to appear properly, then go use the station.  Don't try to use the crafting menu with the map/pipboy/etc. open since it's still not really registering you "at that station" with the map/etc out, and won't properly craft items or consume materials.
---
Just use your junk, man.
---
Collect recipes and build stuff whenever you get a lot. Got a thousand steel? Make and sell 100 tire irons that day. Collect the experience and the money. Break them down and make more.
---
Download a list of every weapon mod you can get by scrapping and start making and scrapping those weapons to unlock all the mods.
---
Build and scrap stuff at your camp for experience.
---
Sell it to vendors.
---
You don't need a thousand pounds of every type of material on hand. You just need like 100 of each. That weighs very little.
---
Line in the sand is the one with the annoying generator you have to defend from scorchbeasts, and Distant Thunder is the other one!
---
"I got an idea, let's make their mere existence lag the server instead of only when they dupe!"
---
I must be a duper. Jesus.
---
All good points and it's too bad they probably wont listen to that.
---
Good man :-)
---
This makes complete and total sense, we should all embrace our inner ass hole at end game ;)
---
You can put them on the armor and weapon indicated as if you had the plan to build it. It also includes the materials for the mod. I like taking ones I pick up for weapons I don't use and slapping them on low level versions of them. Then giving them to low level players as gifts. 
---
Hmm I'll take scorchbeast for 100 Jim 
---
Try like... 40 or 50.
---
Wait until you're trying to find a *specific* one and you'll find the true meaning of frustration! ;\^)
---
Surface to air grants you a power armor piece not a plan afaik
---
I had like 3 in each of 5 sessions i was in.
---
To offer a counterpoint here though - If you outlay the caps for Healing Factor, then wouldn't that free you up to use some different perks or armor that offered different benefits? 
---
You just said the mobs are too high levelled for you to solo without cheesing it.
---
Doesn‚Äôt that tell you it‚Äôs out of your current capabilities?
---
Do the quests. Play the game. Explore. Farm Whitespring when you‚Äôve finished the quests and story.
---
Yeah especially with it stacking previously, they should have added a small nonintrusive pop-up that says so when you try to stack
---
That was a predictable answer, it's more complicated than that, read the other replies.
---
Card slots are irrelevant; active cards are what matter, which is controlled by SPECIAL points. 
---
[Yes, they do](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad6bxr/bethesda_please_fix_this_gamebreaking_damage/), but again, zero evidence you can use it to one-shot a passive solo player.
---
Just because you mentioned the toilet... I'd love some non-busted bathroom stuff, too. And kitchen stuff, like a refrigerator and working stove. Maybe a washer and dryer, too - dunno what, if anything, those would *do*, but hey.
---
I'm honestly not sure what to believe anymore about obtaining plans. I thought my chance was long gone to obtain the lever gun and there it was all of a sudden. Meanwhile I must've done Patrol Duty about 15 times now and still no handmade plan in sight. Always get either crossbow, 10mm smg, submachine gun, plasma gun or a shotgun.
---
Haha ok.
---
All that means is that you're probably just gonna have to save my ass a lot
---
Lvl 50 should be the minimum. I know you can get to the point of launching the nuke before 50 but it says "OPTIONAL nuke FSP 8+ players" meaning, sorry little fellas, gonna have to keep drinking your milk and getting bigger and stronger. 
---
It depends on your build.  Ranged builds will need different mutations than melee builds.
---
I use the Good Doggy Perk and Purified water for food / drink so I don't need / want carnivore or herbivore.
---
Take a look a the perks and see which ones make "sense" to you.  Also make sure you have Starched Genes and Class Freak on to keep your mutations and reduce the downside 75%.
---
Even just for looks. They dont need to DO anything. Lol
---
Has anybody else traveled to Harper's to be greeted by an unobtainable floating Tech Data folder? Happened to me a handful of times now. Frustrating. 
---
Whether you have pacifist or not people still can only do a tiny bit of damage, depending on their actual damage output. Pacifist simply prevents you from accidentally flagging yourself for pvp by shooting another player of their CAMP or Workshop. Basically it prevents you from doing any damage, it doesn't prevent you from taking any.
---
Wow, didn‚Äôt expect you not to escalate the disagreement so I thank you for that but honestly I think people are dying in unexplained ways and this is the go to excuse when it could really be the very confusing pvp mechanics where seemingly one thing starts pvp while another may leave you wanted or with nothing at all. Combine that with ‚Äúseeking revenge‚Äù mechanics and workshops and it‚Äôs just very unclear why sometimes people can attack us for full damage.
---
You can turn them in for stuff like junk (adhesive is one of them), and at higher rates random prize boxes which may content legendaries.
---
&gt;Give 
---
you don't think the literally copy/pasted code from skyrim/fo4 isn't lazy?
---
Not really, it proves against it. If you're capable of handling the SBQ, you're capable of handling the mobs. If you're not, you're not.  
---
i would agree but not til duping is fixed. 
---
If i have too lol
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
Most of the ballistic guns have mods like piercing or perforating magazines that offer solid armor piercing at the cost of a slight durability reduction.
---
Energy weapons are so under powered right now that they need to balance buff the shit out of them before they even consider adding armor piercing perks. 
---
I don't even know who u are. and was looking hard for vid like it as to see if anyone has came out with a video like that. the footage I used was mine and mine alone. mind linking your video. Ill take a gander at it.
---
Assaultron Dominator!
---
A Radtoad - I'd been told he'd move to my new CAMP location, but he's just vanished into the ether. That's what the used, non-invisible budget is in the screenshot.
---
Yeah look at the weekly challenges on the menu! :( it's listed as a factory..
---
Also along with creatures to kill there is 
---
"Kill an alien"
---
And no its not the Flatwoods cause right by its there's
---
"Kill the Flatwoods monster" so they're separated. 
---
I've been wondering if these are things yet to be in game.?
---
I found the jet pack mod in the armory in the Whitespring bunker. It was only like 500-ish caps. Best purchase ever, but they DRAIN fusion cores like nothing else
---
4pts in charisma for lone wonderer is huge.
---
All damage reduced by 20% and 30% ap regen.
---
Blocker in str is crazy as well.
---
Those are the corner stone of my no pa no melee build
---
&gt; Grindr
---
Someone's autocorrect needs a talking to ;)
---
That would be sweet!
---
&gt; besthehdia acting like this stuff is the player base's fault is stupid.
---
Yup. Expecting people to behave themselves and act with a modicum of honor is totally unreasonable. /s
---
Cool, I may give this mission a try sometime, ty for telling me about it
---
True might be worth it but my endurance is mainly set up for keeping me alive but I could run all of it at once (regen leg, photosynthetic, sun kissed &amp; healing factor) and probably have to use 1 stimpack every large fight
---
This makes sense.
---
or that gun could appear on the workshop that you are missing just one  adhesive or one screw to finally upgrade that stupid gun you finally have the right perk card for...I mean this is a great Idea I love it.
---
Can also confirm, was at my base scrapping and fixing gear yesterday. Got the "you have been disconnected" message, logged into a new server and had to rescrap and fix everything again, not a big deal because I got the junk back. But if this happened after a SBQ kill or finishing a quest and getting rolled back and having to redo will make for some real salty players.
---
I can craft it along with hardened and silencer for you if you want gt- vespaboy1975
---
&gt; Title
---
r/titlegore
---
It's called Monster Mash. It's a PVP event at Watoga High School (right near Watoga Station).
---
YES!!!!
---
I'd be fine with a stronger King, but he's got to land.  How the heck would melee players ever help kill him? lol
---
Well, I'm glad someone else is having the issue and not just me.  Going to that substation bugged for me too.  I've just been avoiding the area for the past week.
---
It's probably a server synchronization bug.
---
The Enclave Officer uniform certainly has a ... style to it
---
Snore.  Part of the game.   
---
I‚Äôm looking for an excuse to get rid of all these fusion cores. Was hoarding them early game for this moment. I played most of the game out of power armour too. 
---
I had no idea there were chainsaws in this game. 
---
Last night I fought 2 scorched queens at fissure prime with probably 10 other kids(ps4) I looted 8 acid from one, and meat from the other. Player that dropped the nuke kept throwing up the ‚Äú???‚Äù emote so doubt he got anything from them as well. I got better loot from the scorched herd 
---
I've seen it work decent with double barrels but even then not with using compared to raw damage mods.
---
Opossum
---
I think the word is remind.
---
There have been a number of YouTubers making videos about how this subreddit hates them or asking for additional likes because we're some vindictive entity out to get them right? These comments might make it into his next video.
---
Do you even have any proof of them being ‚Äúshit weapons‚Äù? Because I have plenty of proof that they are not.
---
This has been a thing since FO4.
---
Had a HC level 99 Burizon that I &gt;LOVED&lt; hearing someone decide to go PK on a hills run.  I had so many ears!
---
I had a 3 SB spawn defending Abandoned Bog Town when he showed up. SB's melted his ass multiple times though it allowed me to put ranged shots on them.
---
I hated they had no npcs in the game but i got used to it but it feels lonely in the game 
---
That should also be fixed. Why even have the 1-5HP damage to people who dont have any interest in PvP? I say pacifist people should also be invulnerable to player damage. They said people could play this game solo and enjoy it just like their single player titles but that isn't really true if other players can come blow your house and up and chip damage you to death.
---
I just want the capability to scrap .38 ammo and convert it to something more useful like 5.56  wp
---
Im mainly a jack of all trades but focusing a bit on  rifles and melee (11, 4, 9, 5, 10 &amp; 9)
---
Any 3* modded with a scorchkiller reciever will be 4*.
---
I think a machete with sacrificial mod too
---
Is there 4 star enemies in the game? I thought 3 was the highest at this point
---
The more health a weapon has, the more damage it does.
---
0 legitimate sources because they haven't been released yet.  Got ya.  Also why downvote every single comment?  Is that how your normally discuss things?  Kinda sad.
---
I am playing on PC and I can only place one marker.
---
Did you guys just assume their gender? Damn that's cold
---
They don't drop, but you can artificially inflate a legendary item with a  Scorched Killer's receiver. You get the recipes for them at Charleston Fire Department. They add a star to the item's quality.
---
is this whitelisted? aren't they going to ban me for using this mod?
---
Might use speed demon, eagle eyes and healing factor
---
Pacifist mode does not affect the damage you take.
---
Its only function is to prevent you from dealing damage to other players and/or their CAMPs. 
---
Has to be the never ending sonic blast attack of the glitched Scorchbeast, aka Sir Spam A Lot.  You can run, but you can't hide.
---
Isn‚Äôt it already a... oh, OK.
---
It doesn't cost much to repair your base, especially with Contractor perk. And you can simply eat some food or use a stimpack and they just wasted a minute chipping away at your health. Or you can server hop or fast travel or something.
---
Bloodied Pool Stick***, Hunters Rolling Pin***, TSE everything.
---
Nuke grenades are great at clearing the fodder.
---
The pvp system is kinda bad unless it's organized pvp battles. So it should get a revamp. This chip dmg is so weird, i guess it's so that ppl can kill an afk guy or something, but still: revamp imo
---
It is an actual quest. You go to the DMV in charleston and get a number to get a military ID, only for it to take 5 minutes to get your number called. After it is called they say you need to go get something and come back. Once you do it makes you wait for a number again. You do this 2 more times before you actually get the quest completed. It is a living hell that you never want to go back to. Worse part is it is mandatory to do any BoS quest
---
Right to the part where you get attacked by a mod of hooligans trying to get served ahead of you when your number is called.
---
If legendaries don‚Äôt drop drills then how the hell is my handy manny build going to be competitive OP?!?!
---
What's amazing is that my friend and I got disconnected from the server about halfway through this quest and were forced to start over from the very beginning. We ended up loving it because it somehow made the DMV even MORE immersive.
---
Its the most realistic and relatable quest in the game. Its sad to see that the DMV still has not gotten any better that far in to the future. I mean i like how they even gave the robots the DMV attitude it really made me chuckle. 
---
Eh no? Wasn't me? I don't mess with scores. Most of my convos are deep thread 1 on 1s so its just 1 to 1 back and forth
---
Being permanently over-burdened like me headed that list down to three things. Still obnoxious as fuck. I'm betting there's been talk about selling permanent skills in the atomic shop. I'm more annoyed by having to have three separate fucking perks and level those fucking perks up.
---
I for one believe your story, because [I had already posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag2ghn/now_for_something_completely_different_legendary/) how these items will completely ruin PvP more then TSE weapons.
---
Say that about a fusion generator or especially a decon shower.
---
So, I have done as you say, I see options for "installed" "games" "classics" and "tools". No fallout classic, is there some code I need to input so they know I have fallout 76 on Xbox?
---
I'd love if you could grind to get your perfect build.
---
Let us LOCK items in our pip boy so they can't be dropped, scrapped, sold, or traded.
---
Then give us the ability to SCRAP UNLOCKED legendaries for a 5% chance to pull one perk off the legendary as a one time use mod.
---
That would give you the ability to grind your gear.  And it would screw over the dupers as well.  Why pay dupers for mass duped standard weapons when you can grind your own perfect weapon for your build?
---
Well, i'm always trying to sell materials cause I have a ton of them. Mostly the basic ones, wood, steel and such. Im on ps4, maybe I can help with stock, at least.
---
Its been bugged for awhile I believe. When I go to "research the key" or whatever the terminal doesn't provide me the appropriate option to further said quest. I was hoping this patch would've addressed it, as I hate active quests on the journal tab, but alas was disappointed to find its still bugged out. 
---
They weigh so much that I try to keep 4-6 only. I don‚Äôt loot any others. I ran into a blast zone and didn‚Äôt realize the power consumption until I had 1/4 of a core left with 8 glowing gouls chasing me
---
4 star bloodied machete with sacrificial mod was a beast - Sold it though - regret it now lol
---
You have to do it at some point, You go to the building for at least two different quests. The second time depends on when you decide to do something else. Boring when I did it around 50 something, pain in the ass when I stopped by at 20 something.
---
I believe you actually can work your way to everything inside the capital building without having to step outside, with the exception of the governor's seal you need to stamp with.  But yeah, going in and out is just faster. 
---
I get a sense of pride and accomplishment when my Lvl 70 character fights a lvl 68 3* Scorched just to find a lvl 25 wood leg armor.../s
---
Honestly you don't need a godly weapon if you have a solid VATS-crit build like the OP. I can crit kill a scorchbeast in less than a single magazine using a 1\* zealot's combat rifle and commando perks. My build is similar to what's shared but I can swap out Riflemen and Commando as needed. The only real difference I see in my build is that I use Four Leaf Clover in addition to Better Criticals, Critical Saavy and Bloody Mess. I also maxed all the Riflemen/Commando perks.
---
Putting the FASH into fashion.
---
&gt; easy to get
---
That's relative. Splattering some ghouls at Whitespring is easy, *relatively speaking* spawning the Scorchbeast Queen and killing her is harder. They shouldn't both drop a 1* Ghoul Slayer's Wood left leg.
---
Beautiful!  Wish my camp wasn't so small due to having a few turrets. Do you have any problems with it being attacked by mobs?
---
When did the Quantum sign come out?  I never even saw it.
---
Seems like it, yeah
---
I think it is fine, but there are those on either side that can't distinguish between hating on a game, and criticism. 
---
Woops sorry I am tired af
---
This is what I suggested at launch. Have lvl 1 lock pick passively at 3 per, 2 at 5 and 3 at 10 or something similar. Then leave the cards for people that don't want to invest in perception. Same for INT etc. 
---
I had the ultimate minimal OP base design with 5 missile turrets and a single heavy laser turret setup in the Cranberry Bog back on my main character before Scorched Beast were nerfed to prevent infinite wandering. Base setup had everything enclosed and I saw it melt waves of Scorched/Scorched Hermit Crabs/Mirelurks/Scorchbeast you name it. I can say that rocket turrets by far are the best and if I went about redoing this I would have added a spotlight over the heavy laser because otherwise turret AI sucks. If you aren't constantly around your base and you have a base setup in spot where people run through often you need turrets; if you are remotely located don't worry about turrets because only you going to your base should spawn enemies.
---
Its "on you" for having a decon shower? What? 
---
Do you really think he had a battery, err, you know, up there?
---
That sad thing is so fucking boring in the perks are so pointless that I generally stopped leveling up at all around level 80 except if I decide I need something I read about later. But there have been multiple times when there were like five or six up levels that I ignored for a while.
---
Yeah and I one hit email star legendary enemies all the time and still get 3 star loot so I really don't know how it works.
---
It gets marginally better with a scope (or my mind wants it too, not sure)
---
Sure it would, because chances are even at 3\* it's still going to be wooden or trapper armor.
---
Dual power fists with medic legendary affix. The 'defibrillator'
---
They'll be temp banned. Explain their situation. Be reinstated. Learn a valuable lesson about trust.
---
The part that killed me:
---
"Oh, this line is for *renewals*. If you want a new ID you need to go to Department C."
---
*go to Department C*
---
"This number is for Department B. You need to go get a new number."
---
I said "he or she" tyvm ;)
---
That may be true, but doesn't mean the inverse is not true. Killing a legendary mob with 1 or even 3 stats will obviously result in a few crappy 1-star weapons sometimes, but 1-shotting a 3-star legendary mob may still be a smart way to say "this mob was obviously not a challenge for this player, give him a 1-star or crap weapon drop all or most of the time."
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm gonna hate it :D
---
I don‚Äôt see why not, so long as it‚Äôs not the same thing that the other 1000 people last complained about. My qualm is an unending supply of people complaining about the same thing like it needs a daily thread/video even though numerous people already have done so lol
---
that would be ccol. would also like to see real Bows added. Wooden bows and composite compound bows.
---
more LARGE 2handed would be great. every person in PA looks like they have a Toy in there hand.
---
Completely agree. I'll even go so far as to argue in favor of the game being released just the way it was, bugs and all. Because releasing the game was *by far* the fastest way to identify bugs, balance issues, etc. while finding out what aspects of gameplay would ultimately prove most enjoyable and fun so they can be built further.
---
I'll also argue that 76 runs on a fine engine‚Äîone with quirks, yes, but that's what I'd expect from a game with this variety of gameplay experience and mechanics, not to mention the first multiplayer title in the franchise. And the actual *content*‚Äîthe variety of weapons, armor, perks, mods, creatures, locations, events, etc.‚Äîgoes well beyond any previous Fallout.
---
There are things about 76 that have genuinely frustrated me, but I see Bethesda actively engaging with the community, responding to feedback (remember we started with 400-capacity stashes, no PTT, and a lot more pesky bugs), and overall doing as well as I think any other studio/dev would.
---
Sure as long as you believe all duppers should burn in hell and have absolutely nothing bad to say about Tod Howard or fallout 76 :) in all seriousness, probably not tho.
---
I did the same for atom points
---
You don't need to collect junk though. You just need what you need to build. There's no point to hoarding so there's no real reason Bethseda should worry about the limit, 600 is more then enough.
---
You can critique the game for sure.
---
Just don't call the people that are enjoying it stupid or chromosonally deficient.
---
I love the game, but there is a large list of stuff I would change moving forward.
---
Man, I'd love to see pics of this place. Two fusion generators.. wow!
---
Alot of the armor plans are actually just mods that you add on after you craft the item and even than you have to have the plans to build said item
---
only if he swipes left instead of the right decision

Jury Rigging, one of my favorite perks. I could listen to that duct tape sound effect all day.
---
I (level 103) just finished doing the same thing with a level 40 something in tow. I assume it was his first time because he wasn't looking out for the legendary enemies, so I threw on my mic and started talking him through it and basically acting as a damage sponge while he got a couple hits on each one.
---
Once we finished I dropped all the miner gauntlets and shotgun, told him to have fun scrapping or selling them, and went on my way.
---
Wv lumber co.
---
This is a major problem because i'm trying to do it all without buying crap and saving. I need more storage asap
---
Played for 100+ levels over two characters.  ZERO meaningful legendary drops so far.
---
LOVE this whole project!!! Do you have an instagram I can follow? &lt;3
---
I took the armor / weapon crafting perks to change add/mods on those, I personally don't think they are dump or worthless ... in lower level you are able to enhance your legendary armor/weapon with the appropriate mods. AND if you don't need them just change the SPECIAL perk card(s)...  Cheers ;)
---
Yeah. You're in a post apocalyptic world with Raiders and Super Mutants etc. who can show up and destroy your stuff at any time. Just because it might be a player doesn't change anything. If you don't want to lose it and can't afford to repair it, then store it when you're not using it.
---
I was hoping to discover the same thing. No response though .(
---
I think a metal spiral staircase (can use the same exact skin they have now just wrap around themselves) would be an easy first step that would go a long way.
---
But I agree, U/L shaped stairs are my dream.
---
YES!  I love this idea, I slap you silly with an up-vote!   I wouldn't mind if they were semi-rare to make or get (like no flux required to make them).  Having guns break like they do mid-battle sucks a ton when you end up having to carry multiple guns and metric fucktons of ammo to down the SBQ.
---
Love my buzz blade. Like mowing the lawn.
---
lol im level 217 and itravel around the map. on the rare occasion a 3 star appears its very unfun to get a drill. im not asking for a 3 star TSE, im jsut asking for at least a 2 star or 3 star item, coudl be cloaking wood leg with breather underwater. thats better than a drill. 
---
Just wear the chest and shadow some leather legs or combat. Then your choice of arm wear. You'll appear less bulky if you do.
---
anything on Inside the Vault for this week?  
---
Waiting desperately for news on new content.
---
Not that I‚Äôve experienced- I‚Äôve got my weapon artisan and luck of the draw both maxed out. I very very rarely have to repair at all. I haven‚Äôt noticed but I‚Äôm pretty sure luck of the draw isn‚Äôt repairing to the 200% that Artisan gives. I just know that with those two perks and maxed out white knight and gunsmith I almost never have to repair anything (with the exception of after raiding nuked white springs or SBQ)
---
I just want to display Comrade Chubs and friends and have a pool cue and balls on the fricken table.
---
All my friends who haven't done the quest, I get all giddy and they're just oblivious on what's to come.
---
"You haven't done the DMV? Let me watch you do it."
---
How do you get this quest
---
*Waits 5 Minutes*
---
Sorry, but you need a house address, go fucking dumpster dive until you find a letter and come back
---
I've renewed my license at that very DMV in real life before.  Can confirm that the experience is accurately simulated.
---
Don't say it isn't screwed if you use an controller instead of mouse of keyboard. With mouse and keyboard it is a shitshow.
---
A king with no wings similar to how Mirelurks Kong‚Äôs have no shells would make sense. They‚Äôd have to make it a more difficult fight though since  only reason the queen can be tough is if she doesn‚Äôt land. On the ground is the easiest phase of that fight.
---
The brick looks so good for interior walls though!
---
Okay, that is probably it. I use both rank 3 of that perk and the one that reduces chem weight. That's good to know because now I can swap some of those cards out for other ones.
---
I use my perks to determine what is "unreasonable" in my inventory. My stance is that my weight disparity should be small when I switch from food/first aid/ammo/armor weight perks. It was this that got me to finally start selling my chems. "Okay, so I save 20 lbs of ammo...but if I switch to this I save...80 lbs of chems. Wait...how many friggan chems do I have?"
---
Glad. I spent 45 minutes completing it after I crashed.
---
So glad I live in the UK and never have to deal with DMV‚Äôs
---
We really do need a rebalancing update. .308 doing more damage than a .50 makes absolutely zero sense to me. A lot of perks could use a second look at too, scrapper for instance giving you 1 more steel... wow... amazing.
---
What lvl are you? Some can't be crafted until you level up
---
this happened to me for the first time last night... Guy had a TSE Rail Gun with Flechettes I know it was this because I have friends that have this same setup and I know the look and sound. I'm lvl 99 and not in any n00b gear. Ws just standing in WS cuz I just loaded into the server and I always have Pacifist mode on. Guy comes up waves at me, I wave back. He starts looking at his Pip-Boy and then points his gun at me then shoots me and I die instantly... then like that he was just gone... It happened so fast and I didn't expect it so I didn't even see his name... I was just like WTF! I had just read the PSA about griefers stacking 100s of Bobbleheads and was like I'm pretty sure I just got bobble-headed... It was getting late and I was just put off so I just logged for the night... I'm HOPING Bethesda puts out a hotfix that makes it so that you cannot stack bobble heads and can only have 1 active at a time no matter what kind it is. It's insane that this is even a thing...
---
apparently data-miners found a compound bow, so maybe soon.
---
Yea, I spent a lot of time trying to get those plans and was pretty disappointed by how lackluster the protection is.
---
Generally this game needs to stop being so damn power armor centric. The soul of any MMO is build variety.
---
Two separate bases. 
---
That's probably their slogan
---
Everyone's getting SUPER FUCKING SALTY in here...
---
...and I agree this is a little silly...
---
...but it sounds like all you'd have to do to avoid this is open a trade with that guy for all of 5 seconds and then they'd be on their merry way.
---
This is really, really far from the worst grieving I've ever seen.
---
Like. Really far.
---
We have no accurate/verifiable records of how many copies the game has sold.  We have even less indication of precisely WHY a given person did or didn't buy a copy.
---
Having said that, I agree that of the people that chose not to buy a copy, only a relatively small percentage chose not to do so due to the lack of living, human, NPCs.
---
I can. LOL
---
People act like this GAME is their livelihood.
---
The challenges for plans and recipes are fucking broken, too
---
I don't find squat for armor.   I would rather not use power armor.  Finding armor plans is ridiculously hard too.   The farmers are always about on the servers I keep landing on.
---
I‚Äôm level 35 (but I‚Äôm pretty much a noob)
---
Are you on PC?
---
Just found it again and you are correct sir! Went there to grab a bunch of plastic and found it in a little kitchen room in south west corner of the gym. Good looking out! 
---
There is a very good one in the desert amusement park region(don't remember the name). It's more to the right of it(very detailed, I know), and you will have access to a small toxic pond, but it's enough to build 2 big purifiers inside. To know exactly where that is, just search google for a detailed resource map and look in the general vicinity of the area I mentioned. My base was located at that place for quite a long time, it was good, and very rarely taken by another C.A.M.P. if u can't find the spot, I will help you pinpoint it on the resource map.
---
That's dumb. If you want to experience the game solo (Like Bethesda said you could) then turrets would kill any type of enemy in the game once you set them up. Players on the other hand can just blow your house apart with TSEs and orbital trike beacons or whatever. Players are not at all comparable to any AI enemy as they are infinitely stronger and have infinite respawns. That's not a good point at all.
---
Props to Bethesda for doing this but also fuck you Bethesda for doing this. üòÇüò≠
---
On one hand, good!
---
On the other, I did want that PC back :(
---
Awesome bacon in fact
---
Fo76 is a corporate trash PRODUCT that solely exists for making money. I miss the era where games where passion pieces made by devs who weren‚Äôt shackled by evil investors who don‚Äôt care about gaming. Some people have the ability to not support these trash games because they know it‚Äôs the only way to change the industry. But with you, you‚Äôd rather get any little enjoyment possible and berate others for critiquing it so that you can validate your enjoyment of the game. Sorry, but some people have the strength to show beloved franchisees tough love, you clearly don‚Äôt have said strength.
---
See [how to get plastics](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag8z6j/a_beginners_cheat_sheet_on_what_to_keep_and_what/ee4warh/) if you need to farm plastics...
---
94 range?  You could snipe with that wank bag
---
Okay, I bought the bos combat armor arms, legs, and chest 
---
Cute
---
Damn dude you've got a pretty harsh personality.  Imagine if you actually did manage people?  You make some good points but really it's not necessary to try and shit on people while having a discussion =P
---
You make some good points.  Catching someone up in the ban wave would suck for them.  I mean.. that's what happens.  People get caught up in ban waves.  They open a ticket and someone investigates and if it was erroneous, they can reverse the ban/suspension.
---
You seem to be missing the point on what the query is though.  You don't audit each account that's returned.  You just suspend it.
---
Also a good point about picking up a 100k lb bag of whatever and not realizing there's something wrong.  That'd be a person that was seriously ignorant, not just in the situation with all the duping going on in game but.. in other areas as well.  Fair point though they shouldn't be suspended and would have to open a ticket.
---
Yes, all this would be a PR fiasco.  I couldn't imagine it not getting picked up by all the same game sites and youtubers that already trash on the game.  Nothing different there.
---
First time through, it was great. Playing on my Alt... just annoying and felt like a waste of time. 
---
Still, great quest design. I just wish there was another way, like if you find a ghoul with a higher ticket number you could skip all the waiting, or something. 
---
being able to switch out perks at all kind of defeats the purpose... Special points stop at lvl 50, yet you can still level up cards and swap them on the fly, why? all that does is waste like 30 seconds of play time to swap a card, do a thing, swap it back. even making it so we can set up whole builds to be able to swap perks on the fly serves no purpose except to be tedious. especially now that you can move a special point every level after 50.   
---
really they should just let us keep dumping the special points in until we run out of cards per category. it's essentially the same as being able to swap out cards and readjust points just without having us sacrifice our time to do it.  
---
or they could just lock out points and cards at level 50 n piss everyone off, but that would just be dumb.
---
There's only like, one static spawn in the entire game.
---
Yeah, I got that exact issue.  Fixed on relog like most quest bugs.
---
Try making them and than checking modification tabs
---
I don‚Äôt usually PvP but there are occasions when I do. I couldn‚Äôt agree more with these suggestions. If any of you are familiar with borderlands, I believe they had a system where the second person had to accept the PvP engagement. 
---
Hey look it's one of the same couple of complaints that always get upvoted on this sub.
---
Same shit happened to me, I almost threw my Xbox out the window.
---
Fair enough
---
You an idiot, there are tons of legitimate players, don't be ignorant just because you cheat, doesn't mean everyone does. 
---
yep. i always do Munitions and Charelston, junk amd ammo and nice far fast travel points for free :p
---
No, because if it were than virtually every sequel game would be guilty of this. Sequal games are most often built on the engine of the previous game and reuse assets to save time. No reason to reinvent the wheel every game, that would be stupid.
---
Just look at Borderlands or Mass Effect. The sequals to those games reuse code and assets trhoughout them so if you want to bash Bethesda for this, then I expect you to go bash gearbox and Bioware for it too.
---
Hell, Fallout 2 did the same damn thing from Fallout 1, so go bash Fallout 2 for being an asset flip.
---
Besides, if you weren't so dense, you would see they still did make a ton of new assets for this game, they just reused assets where needed and wanted to maintain the same style from Fallout 4.
---
happened to me when some1 launched nuke, wanted to repair my weapons, after 1 minute i said fuck it. during SBQ fight my handmade got broken and 2 sec afterward i got the menu so i could repair it LOL.
---
I'm sure with dlc's and expansions over the years they will add to the game and we will see more. This is just the start and the basics to what is on the way. We will see more story,more npc's, more weapons and armor, I think we might even get vehicles one day. This will be a 10 year game till next Fallout
---
They need to take a long hard look at weapon balance and perks in general.  The current damage booster cards have a lot of room for improvement.
---
Right, fair point. But I think the explosive guns and weapons are ruining the experience for people. But you right, they need to put a end to it if they can, I am just not sure they can. They will patch one hole and they will find another. Just like GTA, Rockstar has to endlessly patch to keep up, it's really a cat and mouse game. Bethesda need to do the same thing if they want to save the game.
---
The bos combat armor does not appear
---
When anyone hits me with slap damage I give them the terrified emote and just make sure I deposit my junk just in case. 
---
Did he have a bounty?
---
It's right there in the patch notes, the Gauss Rifle now benefits from Rifleman. Up to 72.8% more damage if you have all three ranks equipped.
---
It will considering this was Bethesda Austin first game with the creation engine they were literally taught how to use the creation engine from using fallout 4 that's why alot of copy paste happened they were thrown in tbe deep in to learn to sink or swim 
---
Did you read the plans after you bought them?
---
Maybe Bethesda shouldn‚Äôt publish such a readily exploitable game in the first place.
---

Massachusetts currently sources natural gas and some small amounts of coal from West Virginia. This is not just about producing electricity in West Virginia and transmitting it to Massachusetts. WV provides the fossil fuels that are converted to electricity in MA.
---
He probably just wanted to enable pvp with you or he wanted to get a bounty off of him. 
---
Probably because he was wanted. You could have gotten some free caps. 
---
Damned, its been unkind to me. I've tried it here and there countless times and it never rights itself. 
---
Assuming you have mats, which rarely seems to be the case.
---
You can play solo, but it's not a solo game. It's a multiplayer game. And depending on where you build your CAMP some mobs will wreck your CAMP.
---
What is there was a TSE drill
---
I could just give you any weapon you want in the game, instead of wasting your time in the mindless, time wasting grind
---
Please cut the server stability crap, this would not impact them. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
Dang I don't know than lol
---
I'd say for all the newbies and low levels.......kill the mobs for me please.  Also that frees up your TSE players to shoot the queen instead of playing jump and dodge and shoot the mobs.
---
As a level 150+ with an end game sledge, yes I can 1 shot most of these the mobs.  But we need that damage on the queen.  I can't simultaneously fight the queen and all the little mobs.
---
I noticed yesterday after the patch was released for Xbox the game would start the animation but then delay the crafting menu for a couple seconds. Didn‚Äôt run into an issue where it would just appear later however.
---
Yeah. They are actually fairly straight shots. Not sure why it tells you to go outside.
---
I had a [pretty slick getup back in Fallout 4](https://i.imgur.com/z2GG0zO.jpg), would love to bring it back to 76. Maybe one day...
---
There is no limit as far as im aware. I have at least 15, probably more.
---
Yeah, love turning them into burning piles of goo.
---
Mobs wont be able to wreck your camo with the right turret set up. I have 300+ hours into the game and have never had mobs successfully destroy more than 1 fence 
---
im not "hoping for anything like i said just looking for opinions.
---
open to anything people have to say as i am unsure of what wa happening either.
---
I use it solely as a Fast Travel perk.
---
Does it scale with people around her or with amount of people that have event started? What if I can't deal any damage to her? Should I just quit the event and forget about it?
---
There is just such a resource fortunately!
---
It is called the players judgement.
---
Unfortunately not all players have the judgement perk loaded.
---
Indeed. So what is floating again?
---
If part of your camp is damaged, other players can see the health bar I think, that's probably how they knew it was a player's camp
---
Marsupial is just AMAZING. Especially if youre a stealth sniper type build. Pair that with Speed Demon and its a load of fun. 
---
Release better gear once they fix duping and jack up the difficulty level of some mobs? Killing trash enemies should feel easy, some enemies should feel like they're difficult, and at least a few should feel like you need a friend
---
yeah
---
Pretty sure nearly every community with humans contains some toxic jerks and I think all of us have encountered them at one time or another.  You decide if you want to continue to enjoy the positive things provided by the Fo76 community or surrender that because a couple of social knuckle-draggers caused you some pain/disappointment.  Hopefully you are just  venting.
---
BOS Combat Armor legs, chest, and arms are mods.
---
Marine Armor Leg is an armor piece.
---
Combat Armor Chest is an armor piece.
---
90% of what's out there for plans is...........mods.  Actual armor pieces are pretty rare.  I still don't have a full set of most armor pieces at level 150.
---
Your camp is completely separate, you can only own 1 camp per player, but you can take every workshop on the map if you want, there are currently 22 workshops as far as I know, so you could have 1 camp + 22 workshops in theory. Remember workshops disappear once you change server worlds or log off. Camps are persistent when you login, so they disappear when you log off and reappear when you login. If someone is in your spot, it will place it next time you login. So don't move your camp if this happens, change worlds until it places your camp properly else you can still have issues if you try manually place it.
---
Well thanks for trying!
---
...tasty too!
---

Tic?

She has explosive resistance only in her wings. When she lands shoot the ground under her and she‚Äôll get wrecked. 
---
Damn! This helps a lot thanks for clearing this up for me!
---
I have the same problem. I wonder if the problem is that I took the ticket number already once and am retrying the cycle again and i need to take it again and somehow the logic is broken? i don't know. 
---
Where are you being spawned when you fast travel there? Guess it's not at the foot of the mountain.
---
I've seen this weapon.
---
Looks like the dupers got hold of it though....lol  BTW it had terrible perks.  That makes me worried for the future of 4-5 star weapons.  How many millions of hours will you have to play to find 1 perfect weapon for you with 5 perks? lol
---
I really like it from the outside, so here it's just taste. Curious about ur build.
---
I‚Äôve never had any luck with deathclaw friendships. I don‚Äôt have charisma or animal perks. It  usually ends up with them on the menu.
---
no joke I'd just come over from a thread where some kid was being realll smarmy, think I responded to you like I thought it was him? Was trying to make a point about his decision making process. Didn't mean to harsh lol.
---
Imo just revamp pacifist mode to not allow you do damage or be damaged by anyone else. Camps should still be fair game though.
---
Fallout games have never allowed dual weapons.  It's sort of the same reason there are no player-driven vehicles.  Game settings are art and branding and not just standalone gameplay experiences (i.e. they need to sell Fallout 5 soon, based on what the public expects from "Fallout"), and need to "feel like" the other titles in the series.
---
Took me 3 tries with the Deathclaw. First one someone built a camp nearby and their turrets killed it. 2nd time I made friends and the option to kill it popped up after making friends so I did...and it didn't count anymore. 3rd time made friends with it then power armored my azz off the cliff to get away and that one finally counted
---
Fast traveling only takes you to map markers. If you fast travel to a teammate, it takes you to the nearest marker (for free!). If they happen to be nowhere near a map location, you'll need to run the rest of the way; fast traveling again will just take you back to the nearest marker. Respawning works the same. Nearest map location. Most of the map is fairly dense. So fast traveling to a teammate or respawning will usually put you pretty close.
---
0 is the lowest possible number actually. I went there yesterday and found jack shit.
---
Just keep an eye on vendors. I see Daisycutter, Blade of Bastet, Voice of Set at least once a week.
---
It's easily a [top 2 DMV reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHVDN3M_hc8)in pop culture from the past decade.  
---
It doesn‚Äôt look like it intersects with yours. Would be cool if we ended up in the same server and it looked like two bases merged into one big ass base. 
---
When you're there maybe. If you're not there, and somebody spawns in the mobs by being in the area, and with such a small budget, and in certain locations, your CAMP can be wrecked by mobs but that is beside the point. You're playing a multiplayer game.
---
I had a guy follow me around for an hour last night begging to fight. Pvp is broken with all of the 2se weapons out there. I ignored him, so her shot up my camp.
---
Im not certain that you would have the same experience, but I would not pvp in this game. It is a land of one hit kiss, broken armor and camps.
---
Apart from the one platform (which has a pillar now) nothing there is impossible to construct.
---
Yes we are all jealous of how you british people fly your broomsticks everywhere
---
IMO, 3 star legendary creatures need to be a LOT harder to kill to drop 3 star gear
---
Frankly I'll take any "cool" paint job for any armor at this point. There's so few of them and most of the few are not really my style.
---
They don‚Äôt have the infrastructure and I can‚Äôt imagine them even being capable of implementing it. But I agree with you.
---
Well in FO4 Two Shot added an unmodified second bullet to the weapons damage, so it wasn't a straight up 2x buff. If that's the case in FO76, then Instigating would do more damage... at full health. 
---
Scanning, scanning... scanning
---
Yes pls
---
Buy a 20$ headset, problem solved.
---
I'm not at all trying to down play the serious Duping problem going on.
---
But statistically speaking, the longer the game is out, the more people play, the more legitimate TSEs exist...
---
What armor are you trying to craft?
---
Your question is too vague... 
---
Mass Fusion:  We keep Boston running, and some of those other little pissant hillbilly towns too"
---
Some of us totally would, if FO76 offered 1p game option. 
---
You sure you got a legendary pipe **revolver**? If so, they forgot to add that in the patch notes...
---
My perks were decent done around 240 DMG a swing, and that's with me using my perk cards for my TSE shotgun .
---
As far as etiquette, all please be be aware of your surroundings. I‚Äôm tired of getting killed from someone running into my line of fire. 
---
I have never successfully moved a camp. Before or after the update.
---
Black powder rifles are my go to. 
---
But i was singing anti material rifle long before.. and the different bullets. Oh how i miss ap exolosive and incendiary rounds.
---
Don‚Äôt move if you like the area.  Only move when it‚Äôs too much of a chore to where you work vs where you camp
---
An end game period would be nice.  I don‚Äôt see that there is one.  SBQ is the closest thing that would qualify, but that‚Äôs a stretch.  Without an end game, there‚Äôs no motivation to get better items because why do you even need them?  You‚Äôre already one-shorting everything anyway.  
---
Bos combat armor but I was just told that it is a mod
---
Find another game
---
The flamer looks so cool though. I guess it‚Äôs time to trash my 1 Star furious one that I got. :/
---
It pulls it. I got to witness a player logging out last night and his base went right behind him. 
---
And Bethesda said you could play it like a solo for those who dont want to partake in the multiplayer aspect. Take a step back for a second duse, you are arguing FOR griefing. Come on, stop playing devils advocate ok? Its not conducive of a productive environment.
---
Going to give it one more try tonight then I in a PC player and pony up the caps.
---
thats alright. as-long as you can get a base done at least once a week. there really shouldn't be a problem. 
---
Preach it brother. 
---
Yeah, anything besides running through and ignoring/destroying them in small rooms where they're annoying due to the sound effect is a waste of time if that's all you care about.
---
And where did you pull this Fallout 76 Dev Roadmap from?
---
I was really down to play this as a kind of FPS Diablo but there isn't enough repeatable content with a genuine feeling of reward :(
---
Drills are melee not ranged all it can't be TSE.
---
This, exactly. In FO3, there was a train in the Broken Steel DLC. The game engine doesn't handle moving vehicles very well, so Bethesda cheated, and made the train a hat you wore during the trip. They just adjusted the camera so you saw the "interior" of the train car.
---
That's right, you didn't ride in the train, you wore the train.
---
The only thing he doesnt also kill in one shot is the queen, and she has enoug hp that his dps wins out easily
---
If you get one of the special receivers (like Hasty .50 Cal.) the damage is comparable (except to a Hardened .308). The .50 receiver sounds louder though and ammo is a little cheaper to make (for some reason).
---
Its where you go to get a Government ID. Multiple quests require it. 
---
How do I level up my lock picking and hacking? There is an option to rank up on the lock picking card but it‚Äôs greyed out 
---
Seems minuscule to you because you haven't had to deal with it much. Many people aren't so lucky, and would rather see shit like that gone before other QOL improvements.
---
I get that. I grabbed a wirelsess keyboard/mouse set and ran HDMI to the living room TV so I can play games from my recliner.
---
That‚Äôs very similar to mine.  I made friends the first time and then killed it.  Second time I made friends and it killed me.  Second time counted and Rose laughed at me. 
---
I wish all leveled things could be upgraded like that, power armor in particular
---
I still want it lol.
---
I run a vats build but I'm a bit luck starved due to mutations. 
---
I use an anti armor explosive bolt action pistol but i wish i had something better in the 45 caliber.
---
Hmm i might track down a lever gun actually
---
I get it and the my character keeps forcibly going back to it after i cancelled it. 
---
Ok. You leave your collection of antique gold pocket watches on the table in a diner. You go to the toilet and when you return they are gone. Who is that on?
---
Thanks for the quick response.
---
I‚Äôll plan to have to rebuild from scratch if I attempt to move my camp.
---
I really wish they‚Äôd allot some time towards solving this long-standing and easily corrected bug.
---
That‚Äôs fine. I wasn‚Äôt talking about whether or not the system should be changed. 
---
I just saw that you misunderstood what Pacifist Mode does, and wanted to clarify for you.

Sucks for you. Agree to disagree.
---
Yea. I miss the hot road paintings from FO4, obiouvsly not the pink one. They remember me of american fighters in WWII and in the '50s, particulary the sharky one
---
I would enjoy an antimatter gun.. ya know.. like the alien blaster that does less damage than my 38 pipe pistol...
---
Just put anti aircraft missiles and guns around the area for people to manually use.
---
Say you are fighting things with 100 hp, and you can deal 100 damage with one hand every second, versus 300 with two hand, every two seconds. On paper, after 10 seconds, two hand will have some 1500 damage, and one hand will have done 1000. But one haha will have killed twice as many things. If you can kill something in one hit with 1 hand, you will kill twice as many things in the same time period, even if two hands does more damage. Overkill damage is wasted damage.
---
Oh?
---
I know one has a low chance to spawn at the top of the Hornright Estate tower
---
Where is Carrahan Estate? And is it a frequent spawn chance?
---
Pause $60 for the Edition that comes with the dogshit mask and outfit and don‚Äôt even use them 
---
&gt; I bought the bos combat armor arms, legs, and chest 
---
These are modifications for combat armor. You need the plans to make combat armor, which you get from one of the main quests.
---
I would love a bigger budget  I would love a height increase too
---
Someone on here posted the other day that killing the adds causes her to land. So, always kill the adds.
---
That is not at all comparable. Again, no point in playing devils advocate here with me. 
---
I was able to successfully move mine prior to update.  But I have not tried after yet.  I do plan on moving mine to a junk pile location one day though.  
---
Login at my house. 
---
Go outside and harvest crops for making cranberry relish and razor grain soup. Then cook said meals. Make sure I have enough purified water on me.
---
Check my junk and bulk/remove excess of each material in preparation for selling. Tag any resources I'm low on in my pip boy.
---
Check my gear and repair anything that needs to and grab any ammo to top off what I like to carry.
---
Make my rounds selling to the vendors. But I stop at flatwoods if I am low on sugar or disease cures and trot up the river collecting supplies.
---
Do whatever I am going to do for the day. This part changes from questing, just hanging out or farming legendaries, even workshop rounds if my buddies want to.
---
I end each play session making sure I am well fed, well hydrated, well rested, and well tuned.
---
It's just the point of it really. It's no one's fucking business what's in OP's, or your, or my inventories. Not sure where you're from but in the U.S. we have laws about unreasonable search and seizure. Law enforcement can't search your property without a warrant and probable cause.
---
And probable cause leads to another point, these chuckle fucks were harassing a lone player at his camp. As far as I know, there are no duping methods that can be done as a single player on a server so they had no reason to suspect OP was actually duping. They were just being dickheads.
---
Mhm and did you think the loot and XP you got was worth all that hassle?
---
I know what it does, I guess I didn't think people would interpret my post as a misinterpretation of the system.
---
Actually, this is not.  I play no PA and no TSE because I think they are overpowered.  Changing some of the perk cards to passive all of the time would make zero difference in the game except saving some time to do more stuff in the game!  Everyone eventually has all of the perk cards.  Heck I have two toons who have every crafting, combat perks they want - they just pick stuff now.  What is the **game balance difference** difference between stopping and switching out perk cards every time you pick a lock or sale something and just having those cards passive?
---
Look, the whole perk card system itself is just dumb. Why? Because it's 90% the exact same as FO4, except worse. I could go into a lot more depth (and have on numerous occasions) but I'm kinda getting tired of it, because this topic just keeps coming up and Bethesda seems to have little or no interest in actually fixing it. And no, patching up or balancing individual perks isn't going to do shit. The whole system needs a rework.
---
Until that rework happens (I expect never), I just can't bring myself to play anymore. The card system is just too limiting and frustrating. I'd rather just play FO4 instead.
---
Its cool.  Anyway yeah ultimately it comes down to the bigwigs and how they want to handle the situation.  I'm throwing out easy to implement ideas.  They've i'm sure heard everything I could come up with and more and decided against it.  Quite possibly because of the points you bring up.  
---
I'm clearly biased since I don't stand to loose money on the failure of their game lol.  And I'd be glad to have all the dupers removed.  They have to balance between the people who may leave because of all the problems and the people who may leave if they get banned.  Maybe they think the people who exploited are the money makers.
---
I thought the game was broken until I realised Beth was trolling meh
---
Don't hit each vendor for caps.  Takes too much time / effort.
---
Visit FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits to trade.  You can sell legendary weapons, armor, plans, ammo, materials........all to other players for caps.
---
I have 20,000 caps and looking for serum recipes and power armor plans.  When I hit less than 5,000 caps I go back to selling things.  I haven't visited a vendor to sell things in over 1 week.  No more 7 vendor runs for me.
---
I have a Hunter's Hood, I traded for it so not sure where it came from as I havent seen it anywhere else.
---
Super sledge
---
I loved when the Ghoul's number got called and he came running out.
---
To be fair, gunsmith 5 is pretty essential for any type of guns build. Maybe not as necessary for low RoF sniper-only builds, but still. 
---
Same goes for melee.. makeshift warrior is invaluable. 
---
Wv lumber co
---
At the Tyler County Fairgrounds iirc, there‚Äôs a bunch of Nuka-Cola Cup &amp; Straw
---
Only the weapon one stacks with perks not sure if bug or intended.  
---
Events for me at this level (39) really help out.  So I have quite a few events I pop over to on every session if I can.  The experience and loot help keep me going, and those sweet, sweet fast travel caps keep coming in as well.  
---
Bear arms in str reduces the weight by 90% and 5 in int is pretty mandatory for anyone that shoots a gun
---
The game has systems. Like resource systems. These are known as loops and sinks. You need to spend resources repairing things. So you need to collect more resources. It is a part of the game design. And by the way in my 300+ hours of playing no one has ever even touched my base, except for a few groups who wandered by to use the workstations. So maybe your CAMP is in the wrong place if this is a common occurrence.
---
Can confirm it works on Sentry Bots. Not on players, naturally.
---
Don't have marsupial: "huh, looks kinda fun."
---
Have marsupial: "ha, this is pretty cool!"
---
Lose marsupial: "OMG HOW DO PEOPLE EVEN LIVE LIKE THIS?!"
---
They drop 1 star items when they don't have a chance to regenerate their health. 
---
I have an explosive rifle with vampire. The trick is to hit a group. Makes a nice bump on health. But i also have a regenerative bit of armor so thats nice too
---
How does one actually boost the camp budget?  I can build two sticks = max budget.
---
I have the plans and I will sell it to you for 1000 Caps. Gt themisterphenix Message me
---
Honestly I feel like the gun durability card, melee weapon durability card, and armor / power armor durability cards are mandatory if you‚Äôre using said items. 
---
The armor / weapon repair durability bonus cards are also mandatory while doing repairs imo.
---
Everything breaks far too quickly in the game without them, and unless you‚Äôre one of those individuals with 3729483992 of every resource, the repair costs add up and become far too encumbering over time.
---
Bethesda would just use the same lame and outdated excuse Blizzard uses for no PTS for consoles. So only PC could be tested, and Bethesda has already admitted consoles are the ones that need more testing.
---
The only time I have an issue is during the queen.  My gatling will break before its done if i don't use gunsmith.  But I only have 5 points and I go for the armor pen.  They need a buff to where they can last like.. 1 average length queen fight.  Not 100% firing, but account for focusing some on ground stuff.
---
At the end of the day, I bulk all unneeded materials, drop stuff I don‚Äôt want to sell and restock with food and water. At the beginning of the next session, I can directly do a quick vendor route across all 7 vendor types. Takes like 30 min and after that I‚Äòm ready to go exploring or grinding with plenty of space in my inventory and stash. Rinse and repeat.
---
They're doing Player Vending sometime soon.
---
I just hope it's indestructible terminals in the basement of Whitesprings please.
---
I do not want to mark my base for griefers on the map, or compete for land around Whitesprings, or have to travel to multiple camps everywhere only to find pipe pistols, .38 ammo and spoiled food.
---
I am sitting at 404 AP Max. It currently uses 22 AP per shot or roughly the entire mag. With the build I nearly regenerate all of the AP while reloading.
---
What do they have for licensing?
---
A L20 wearing the big-headed Americana outfit who insists on trying to initiate PvP while I'm crafting
---
My camp is never attacked my dude. My low lvl friends are as stated in the post. Nice try attempting to make me the problem. I already said that there is no point in playing devils advocate with me and arguing on favor of griefing. I am not gonna continue this conversation any further.
---
Let me know how placement goes when you do. How large is your camp? Do you use the single foundation tile w/ stairs connected to your main floor setup?
---
Naw if two people with over 5 million weight is near one another it crashes one of them or normally the server. This applies to those that had the stash glitch.  But I get what you are saying. 
---
I like your advice to keep things simple, I see these giant empty monstrosities all over the place... meanwhile I‚Äôm running out of budget trying to decorate a single 2x3 L shaped cabin with built in porch and a 1x2 shed. 
---
As a duper i'll admit it! i have over 1 Mil of all aid and about 600+ All explosive weapons, and god knows how much junk, but its a little to late for that champ. I always said the best way to deal with dupers is simple, but they don't ; listen two words "Private servers" or my personal favorite.... &gt;:) do an Oblivion... Overweight? you can't move. Put a trigger on the feature. You passed 1000 Lbs? You cant move a single inch.   
---
Always right after I build my camp.
---
It's pretty good on the Grognak Axe.  
---
Asset reuse is not inherently bad. I think there's a point though where it crosses into "flipping" territory. It was bad enough when the frozen clocks in New Vegas were still set on Eastern time because they were reused from Fallout 3. It's worse in Fallout 76 because so much stuff was reused. 
---
New Vegas at least had the benefit of being set in an entirely different environment compared to Fallout 3. Even though West Virginia is quite far from Boston, 76 and FO4 look a lot more alike in their environments than NV and FO3. That makes every instance of asset reuse that wasn't strictly necessary just that much more glaring. 
---
I'm not going to fault Bethesda for reusing weapons and armor from Fallout 4 in 76, but carelessly reusing building assets without even bothering to check if they have great big billboard-sized ads on them that are in the totally wrong geographic region gives the impression of lazy asset flipping.
---
I saw that too, but anything they have dropped stays. They left power armour chassis and 2 bags just floating in the air when the camp disappeared. 
---
It works almost every time for me.  I shoot for the base of the wings and they land shortly after, Queen as well usually.
---
So you have an unlimited amount of stuff to sell?  Or do you have to go farm for stuff as part of your daily routine?
---
Here you go brother, this is my playlist of goto plastic farms for when I need to craft up some more shotgun shell hell.  Hope this helps!
---

ps4?
---
I keep around the same on me, but my stash has a bunch. I did similar in the blast zone forgetting i had just been there in my previous session and I had no stimpacks. FAIL
---
It works.
---
Yeah it escaped me but I‚Äôve had ammosmith since it became available at whatever level it unlocks haha. 
---
Not to mention their damage is pitiful, got a pretty sweet LMG today, 10% damage when aiming down sights and 50% faster fire rate, imagine my surprise when it took a whole drum mag to put down ONE level 68 super mutant... this is with the appropriate heavy weapon perks.
---
Marine chestplate with bos arms and legs. The BoS armor color matches well 
---
I feel like we should provide awards to all the DMV administrators I the US and they can be little robots with quotes from the game. Inspirational awards for game quests! 
---
Yeah, it makes sense. But I'm not sure about oneshotting things with 1h weapon.
---
Thats the only one? What about grognak and fire axe?
---
Thank you. My wife and i hate pvp, but we love the FO series. We were hesitant to buy FO76 because it was online only with no PVP avoidance built in. Now you've told me which armor to get for both of us to help keep PVPers from ruining our fun together. 
---
Super Sledge with heating coils mod. 
---
Just fill out a form online, all done for you
---
You probably know the answer to that haha
---
In reality though, I knew about the underwhelming results but since I wouldn't be wasting ammo with the super sledge I decided I'd do it just so I could have that under my belt at least.
---
Got some 40mm grenades and that was it apart from the meat, organs and **ridiculously** heavy bones.
---
Pacifist mode doesn't stop you from taking damage from players so I don't understand why you would expect it to stop your camp from taking damage from players.
---
I jump around and do events.. reward lots of chems, purified water, stims.  Toward the end I sell off excess of that stuff, if the vendor is near a good farm spot, hit that and sell all the weapons I get.  Like harper's ferry for example.. run through there kill and loot everything, then sell it.
---
\[Xbox\]
---
When I first started playing after the patch, the game was an absolute slideshow in Charleston and the Ash Heap. I think this may have been an issue with my internet though. When I was downloading the patch I kept getting spikes and lulls in the download speed.
---
Later on though, I did have two crashes to home screen. I was able to get through a SBQ fight that was actually quite smooth.
---
I've tried to actually make hand offs like this before too but the guy I was trying to help wouldn't take the paper bag. Think he was sketched out by it and thought I was going to kill him.
---
I had a power armour vs unarmed battle.
---
Ended with the electric proc as we smacked one another, both dying. 
---
Real superman shit 
---
I got a stalker vampire pipe wrench with extra 50% limb dmg. Even got 17 caps off it. 
---
New building out the front of vault 76 please and thanks for free fast travel...
---
Low levels have decontamination showers now?
---
What about fire axe and grognaks?
---
Is Vampire any good for Deathclaw Gauntlet? Found a level 50 one at level 16 and wondered if it's worth keeping in the stash until I'm able to use it? Is the health Regen based on damage done or is it a flat rate? Thanks
---
Possibly, I sold mine back in November o think lol, just haven't been in the market for another one try
---
I‚Äôve done that too. And RadAway. I‚Äôve run out of both before. Not my best moment. 
---
Chances are there are multiple tables for loot drops.  Anything up to a legendary has a series of tables.  Adding a legendary star adds another table that is a separate roll.  Additional stars likely have more lucrative tables, but again separate roll for that table.  The drills, flares and junk stuff come from the first roll.  The 1 star item is probably a low roll on the legendary additional table.
---
At least that's how I'd do it if I were designing the loot system.
---
Maybe an update were dmg is done and calculated by the bullet not the weapon. There is no sense in .308 rifle does good dmg but mg42 is like a peashooter
---
Why a dress.. uhg.. its like the reason i wont wear use it. Cant hide that under an outfit or anything has to be all look guys ima crossdresser! -*scowls*-
---
Schorchbeast vs. Schorchbeast Queen
---
Paperchase quest in Witcher 3: Blood &amp; Wine does a better job. Check it out.
---
I don‚Äôt think I could play without Class Freak. Makes using mutations less of an issue.
---
That would be awesome! Unfortunately the 30ft rule applies to other players too. 
---
Also yes, that is what that means!
---
Ive seen a few bases there when mine wont place. One of them was literally just crafting benches in the water. I was a little disappointed and upset. 
---
Every weapon can be legendary except; flare gun, drill, and chainsaw. Personally I've never seen a single action or western revolver be legendary but that doesnt mean they dont exist. 
---
Its the highest but also the heaviest.
---
Fireaxe / grog are much lighter
---
yeah if you can lin it thay would be great , normally it takes me a few characters to finds out what build i wanna do
---
"logging in to do annoying busy work"
---
Spot on!  Thank you.
---
thank you mate, im glad you liked it! Im praying too haha!
---
Yep. You make regular combat armor and mod it to be BoS
---
Yes, I have that problem 100% of the time.
---
In the past either last patch or several patches ago I could move my base.
---
It's a simple 2 x 2 base that's meant to be mobile, and it sucks that I can't move it because of the "base is floating" bug.  Just a FYI even a simple 2 x 2 now with just FOUNDATIONS, WALLS, and CEILINGS has this bug.  It's not how you built, that part of the game is broken.
---
A dogshit mask?
---
Low levels have decontamination showers now? Or do they simply have to spend a few wood and steel to repair their CAMP, which is nothing, and really only an inconvenience or incentive for the player getting the bounty?
---
Pc, Yes sir! IGN mck
---
Harvest crops
---
Make boiled water/ soups
---
Farm 1 or 2 place for supplies
---
Farm whitesprings golf course
---
Sell to vendors stuff you dont need 
---
The Vampiric Telsa rifle is my go to for following around a low level to help them out as they progress their questline
---
Yes, that will work. From what I can tell, there's a hard cap of 25, but you can stack various things to get there. 
---
The only modifier that would be able to do more damage is frenzied but that would have to be on a gun with a moderately sized magazine, such as heavy weapons. Bloodied does a ton of damage but not quite as much as a 2 shot, atleast not for shotguns
---
Stash is not hard to manage. Since people usually have a certain character build. We dont need the space for legendarys 
---
My primary is the super sledge, but I found sometimes it bugs out and doesn't work, so have to keep switching it. Some of the fire axe's with legendary effects works well especially the ghoul effect with %40 damage for ghouls and I jut got the grognak which seems to work fine. But I keep like 10 super sledges on me, so it is easier to get to in a pinch when you one breaks ..
---
Also the All Rise is useful  as it is light weight so do the Major for a Day quest to get it, 90% reduced weight. I also just got an instigating super sledge which I am going to test out more .. bottom line super sledges are easy to come by.
---
Ah i  see that cleared that up thanks.
---
I had no luck so far
---
The presidential vault boy outfit 
---
Those are good too, but you asked for the best base damage, and the super sledge has everything else beat. Although if you really want you can make the axes work too, especially if you get a good legendary effect on em.
---
Hmm, I was wanting to craft a regular LMG but after reading your experience I think I'll have to pass on it since it would probably require even more ammo for me to down similar stuff.
---
If you are on Xbox One, his gamertag is "DrippyDude666". If he's in your server don't invite him or follow him around and you'll see this glitch for yourself.

Armor, Under-armor, and consumables (food, drink, chems) can all break the 15 barrier.

Go on passive so your explosives don‚Äôt trigger pvp with everyone.

Gotcha, so probably worth it to grab a couple unyieldings to compliment my bolstering. Thanks!

Server hopping.
---
This. This is the equivalent to "The check is in the mail." We believe you Bethesda. /s
---
So why is it 2H when I hold it in 1 hand ? How can I tell if it is a 2H or 1H weapon, anywhere on the info of the weapon ?
---
Where?
---
I'd love a ladder as well!
---
Ok 
---
I'd be good with that as well.  Good idea :)
---
The whole system is screwed and griefing is in the uptick
---
Crafting with high INT only increases the durability, and only that.
---
You have to take the armor off, leave the server, enter a new server, and equip that piece again. My chest piece reduces weapon weight and does the same thing sometimes
---
What about that comment actually proves anything other than that he's right, and people who can't handle the ads shouldn't be there at all?  That's the point of the post.  
---
Tell me about it! I can‚Äôt understand how they made it worse than it was in Fallout 4.
---
You know how less base damage a fire axe has?
---
So your saying even if I get my intellect to 38 it treats it as 25?
---
So they won‚Äôt repair to any percentage over 100% even with Weapon Artisan and Luck of the Draw equipped at the same time? 
---
*FYI...I‚Äôm not the one who downvoted you. I save those for abusive trolls.
---
Your title said ‚ÄúPacifist mode should ALSO affect your CAMP‚Äù, then you proceeded to talk about incoming damage. 
---
The first person to respond to your post wanted to correct your apparent misunderstanding of what Pacifist Mode does, to which you replied:
---
‚Äú...it does make it so that they only do the tiniest bit of damage‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs clear from these early comments that you didn‚Äôt realise that Pacifist Mode doesn‚Äôt affect incoming damage to your person, but I guess you certainly know that now, so have a nice day!
---
When this happens to me I strip naked "in the game obviously" stash all my stuff and follow them around giving them the thumbs down emote untill someone else kills them. I often get killed by random enemies but it's worth it to hear them bitch about how annoying it is. Let them shoot up my camp, I'm a hoarder lol I'll just repair it.
---
This comment. I have an automatic handmade with 50% ignore legendary perk and it shreds everything. This with the 36% from tank killer ignored about 68% of my targets armor. I presume it could dip into the 70s percent if you used a stinging magazine instead of the drum like I do.
---
I would really like to see any dedicated sniper rifle... it was really disappointing to see, that "sniper rifles" are just modified hunting rifles... and that hunting rifles are better...
---
What does the assassin perk do on armor?

Definitely a beaver

Dual medical scalpels - "the surgeon".  Goes with the new mask.  Add lab coat to suit.

---
Problem with this is abusing server resets. Since the game only saves every few minutes they‚Äôd have to make the grinder auto save the game on use.
---
And the menus are amazingly user friendly for both console and PC!
---
I haven‚Äôt seen it happen 
---
I sell whatever I find or trade for.  Ammo, mats, serums, armor, weapons.  People buy and sell everything there.
---
If you find one item that will sell on the market for 1,500 caps, you can skip that day's worth of vendor runs :)
---
Yeah, unless they buff it don't bother at the moment. The gun isn't worth using on end game enemies (levels 68-80) and it chews through ammo like a mo'fucker.
---
Loot grinding games aren't my genre typically, but you would think a 3 Star Creature would drop 3 Star Gear, no? 2 Star drops 2's, 1 Star drops 1. 
---
No which hunting 
---
Meh.. i don't see how it'd break with the style of the game at all
---
Good luck!
---
Specifically one that can stack up on itself to make a huge spiral
---
Found about one of each type of gun in a 2-shot... Never found an explosive anything.
---
There isn‚Äôt a lot of proof of a big ban wave. Just rumors and a couple of people claiming to be banned. So we really don‚Äôt know.
---
But because they have Bobbleheads doesn‚Äôt mean they are a duper. I bought a lot of Bobbleheads for 10k Caps. So they could have bought some from a duper or middle man.
---
Whitesprings? Maybe we could rent or buy hotel rooms. 
---
Ah ok, I'm still working on that quest now. Maybe I just haven't got far enough into it, thanks.
---
That's just pa doing that. Display bug i assume.
---
In 1st person i think it shows as 2
---
Just a really rare combination of effects for a legendary weapon. Because it is so rare it is a prime target for dupers.
---
‚ÄòUseless,‚Äô against SBQ and for PVP maybe. But when I‚Äôm running around the Forest at level 80 I like to bring my gatling gun to wipe out all the low level scorched so I can save my good weapons for tough enemies.
---
What they really need to do is let perk cards affect you AND your stash, not just you
---
Naw, but I got a twitter, tumblr, deviant art and the like. https://twitter.com/overshia for my sfw stuff and the tumblr link is on the pages
---
Meanwhile I get some a-hole who comes into the whitesprings golf club one shots all the legendary ghouls and me, then taking my stuff and dc-ing.
---
Fair enough. I play shotgun so I get shells and plastic at the same time. 
---
Sometimes you can still kill her.  I just bail on them now, but if the other guy is suggesting 2 people can't duo her they're confused about the easiest way to kill SBQ - the less people the better.
---
Yesterday, I believe! 
---
He probably has no caps on him. Unfortunately the game is a greifer's paradise atm. There are so many ways to abuse the PvP mechanics it's insane. 
---
Does rad-x suppress the negative mutation too?
---
My camp is just up the hill from Morgantown high school. So the location dictates my order.
---
I head down the hill and take Grafton steel pub shop for random plans and to set up the extractors in case anyone wants them, I don't lock them.
---
Put on hard bargain and mag personality (if I'm with my friends) to start daily vendoring. I always get every cap I can from vendoring. So I sell 300 caps worth, buy the things I want, then sell again to get the fraction caps that generate from buying.
---
First I got to Grafton, I'll check with both vendors for plans/mods, after i sell. I'll do the parade event but not the protest march.
---
Next is Charleston station to see if I can get the Responder Bot vender to spawn.
---
Next is Whitesprings service entrance, I sell, then check the wings for chem/serums recipes and of course the military wing for the XO1 jetpack. I also check the desks on the way up to the military wing vendor. I find a tech doc 90% of the time in there, it's so common it's a part of my routine.
---
Next is whitespring station, get my 200 and leave. He rarely has anything worth buying unless a nuke was recently launched there, and people sold him thier unwanted legendaries. Got a two shot gat gun that someone else didnt want a few days ago. 
---
Next is Pleasant Valley station. Sell then check in with my favorite vendor in the ski lodge. The raider one that talks about you thinking of him when you kill something with his weapons. 
---
Then to Harpers ferry. I check the level 3 safe and locked footlocker in little building that's just off to the left when you fast travel there. Then through the broken wall that leads to the vendor. Check the display case against the far wall as some armor and under armor plans spawn there. Sell, buy, sell.
---
Next, camp venture to turn in the tech doc that I got from WS bunker. I also loot the area, have gotten some decent mods/plans from the little armory room directly to the right when entering the front door. I also grab the lead weights from the bunk house if I need them.
---
Then I head to Watago shopping center to trade with the BoS vendor. Then finally Watago Station where I sell, the drop off anything I wasnt able to sell in the stash box. 
---
Then I usually check for events like Distant Thunder or Line in the Sand bc I'm trying to get PA crafting plans. If they arent available I'll loot Fort Defiance for crap to sell tomorrow. Then just do random events or play with my friends.
---
i have dismantled like 40 bp rifles and have not gotten the bayonet yet

Not very big. I was in a nuked whitesprings last night on ps4 and literally out of the 10 others there 9 had TSE
---
I have a legit TSE combat shotgun with all of the shotgun perks and demolition and it will one shot kill almost anything in the game. No duping required! to answer your actual question though, I think you just got lucky. I haven't heard of anyone getting banned for duping yet.
---
With what you tried to pull on the other 76 subreddit then no
---
I heard a work-around is to build a small enough base that you can highlight it totally in one player-made, anemic blueprint that is connected to a single foundation tile by stairs. Then blueprint everything yourself aside from the foundation tile.
---
Then, when you move your camp, scrap the stored camp blueprint and rebuild the camp out of your player-made blueprints by placing a new foundation tile and snapping the player-made blueprint onto it via the stairs.
---
I know this will work, but talk about having tiny, sad little camp all for the sake of mobility üòï.
---
I'm experiencing this everyday, since day 1. Mostly it takes 1 to 5 minute to open the crafting menu, but I've had to wait as long as 10-15 minutes for it to prompt 
---
Deffo a scorch beast or queen, especially the can't see rant lol

He‚Äôs saying that once you do them then you just get the same companion back again with not much interesting dialogue.

I never tried spec'ing into pistols, I just assumed that they were used with both hands. Otherwise, what would be the point?
---
Our own personal toilets to drink from. Living the dream.
---
I go for aesthetics over practicality/defense. I want my house to look nice and the turrets take up a fucking ridiculous amount of budget. Built my base in the Savage Divide and never had an issue with anything being destroyed.
---
Not all people who have TSEs are dupers though in fact most probably are not
---
The only two-shot weapon I've found so far is a black powder rifle.   OMG it's glorious! 
---
The mandatory Enclave Grinder Lottery is back again! Mandatory tickets will be mailed to your home soon.
---
Exactly, there is no game play balance that is being gained or lost by making us stop, enter the clunky pip-boy interface, go to perks, shuffle around some cards, exit and then repeat after opening the lock or making a vendor transaction.
---
I found one in a hardware shop in Clarksburg.
---
Ilthats not what the patch notes say. They say the gauss will now be considered a rifle and Benicia from related perks. Before the patch and after the patch the damage is the same with the rifleman perk cards on.  They were already affecting the weapon.  If you had the rifle and did he research you woulda known that. Or clearly reading the patch notes woulda helped too.
---
What sucks for me? 
---
The rank 5 in demo is enough to one shot kill anything i whitesprings but the Scorchbeasts. Singel shot explosive shotgun is enough. üòÅ
---
Because it takes away Adrenaline stacks from those of us who couldn't care less about the weak mob damage while fighting the queen.  If I turn around for a tap to keep my multiplier and a level 40 is kiting around a pack or there's nothing, it's a massive DPS loss.
---
Plan or mod?  and is it for the X01 or T60?  I had no idea those were a possibility there.  I'm guessing it's at the military wing?
---
You get better gear, you get accustomed to it, then you‚Äôre back here asking for more better gear. 
---
Could it be the new duping system?
---
Thanks a lot! Given I always repair my weapon to 200% I guess I dont really see use for Luck of the Draw now then, thanks so much for testing!!
---
I dunno about the apartments, but Watoga is a pretty good center. Many people go there for the vendors and SBQ is pretty close. I'm hoping for Watoga becoming a place to always meet with trades and whatnot in the future.
---
My dcs have been less and blue screens more.
---
I'm on ps4 as well
---
Mine was bugged, and never triggered the next monitor in the sequence (I eventually found that you need to drop the numbered tickets from your inventory to reset the quest).
---
Yao Guai. How did you get "Garus"?
---
&gt; Before the patch and after the patch the damage is the same with the rifleman perk cards on.
---
This is where you are wrong.
---
Yeah, on PC we found out last week how bad the patch was. Visual glitches, crafting issues with inventory vs cache, load times. It‚Äôs all shit.
---
No problem, good luck, have fun!
---
Strictly against the rules to post people's tags
---
It was all a dream...
---
Or if youre on Xbox or PS4 just locate the headset that came with your console.
---
There's no ghost of the camp; everything you built vanishes instantly.
---
To verify, take off your power armor and go visit somebody who has built their CAMP over the edge of a cliff.
---
It was not a good day.
---
Oh look you toxic griefers wanting full reign. Just so you know bethesda is releasing pve servers have fun without the easy targets.
---
Drop the tickets from your inventory.
---
That doesn't meant anything to a TSE rifle though, especially to camps with the Wrecking Ball perk card.
---
Interesting.  I say duping because I actually know a guy who could one- shot kill everything and he basically told me he had duped a bunch of bobble heads.  I'm not saying it's necessary for one- shot kills in all cases. 
---
If it's because of dupers, then every single server has dupers on it. I figured maybe I'd get a server that didn't have that issue, but I tried six times before I just gave up.
---
Duh, man, you're supposed to play with your friends! One of you is the sneaky infiltrator that gets you in to places, one of you then goes in loud and clears the place while your friends clean up, and one friend cooks to heal you up and another fixes your gear!
---
Once you buy the game you‚Äôre free to play it.
---
I'm lvl 196... I knew that in pacifist mode you take tiny chip damage. Have a good one dude.
---
We can all say we were there... we were there, the day things changed.... we were there, the day it all went wrong... the day the robots knew it was us or them...
---
I helped 2 people out that were running around the ash heap but they didn‚Äôt see me until the very end of the conflict. I sniped some miners off of their backs and then I approached the 2 and dropped some stuff for them. They thanked me and then we were on our separate ways. 
---
That, to me, was incredible. 
---
I checked it myself... I‚Äôm not sure where your getting your info, but I‚Äôm getting mine from my eyes. 
---
\-dies
---
\-rages
---
\-makes post
---
\-"nuka cola sound" ahhhh much better.
---
It makes you not able to do damage to other players which helps you avoid slapping someone for PvP.  So for your OP, you are saying you don't want your CAMP to be able to do damage to other players.  That's how it already works though =P
---
100% this. 
---
This is false. There is no hard cap. You can get as high as your gear will allow. 
---
Where is that?
---
Nah. Max sneak ninja skills. Bog runs are fine. Slow but no major drama. 
---
Powering up the plant tho.. jesus. It was way worse than Poseidon 
---
will report if that works when i try tonight
---
It is my humble opinion that you would be absolutely incorrect
---
I didn't say they were dupers because of TSE. I'm talking more about bobble heads. Duping bobble heads to raise the damage threshold to insanely high levels is actually a thing. 
---
Ok dude. Nice troll. You are choosing to be willfully ignorant to the meaning of my post.
---
My vamp combat shotgun has been a (literal) lifesaver.
---
Honestly I'm okay with getting that stuff, as long as they drop SOMETHING. I'm getting sick of getting nothing from legendaries.
---
It's definitely predicated on the number of people.  There's plenty of video evidence of this, but simply go solo nuke and get some hits on her one time before "the gang" shows up, it's dramatic.
---
I would not say bloodied is a drawback when there are so many supporting factors. Unyielding armor(Enabling Barbarian &amp; Evasive). Serendipity. Adrenal Reaction. Nerd Rage. 
---
Well now I‚Äôm on the road, look for it late tonight
---
How would giving a game away make it better?
---
When you want to allocate perk cards, you are limited to the amount of points you have available in that attribute. For perk allocation you are limited to 15 points. It is also important to note that any SPECIAL attribute gained through armor or perk cards cannot be used to allocate perk cards with.
---
The passive effect of your SPECIAL attributes is not limited to 15. If you have 15 strength by default and on top of that you have 5 Unyielding pieces, you could boost your strength to 30. You would still only be able to select perk cards for up to 15 points, but the passive carry weight and melee damage increase would representative of 30 strength.
---
The same goes with the passive effects of the other SPECIAL attributes. My build has only 1 charisma, but thanks to 5 Unyielding pieces it goes up to 16 instead. This allows me to use one perk card, which is going to be either Strange in Numbers in group or Travel Agent when playing solo. It does give me the opportunity to share 5 levels of perk cards (3 charisma per level shared), because I have 16 charisma.
---
I would prefer to go for a full Unyielding set and not Bolstering as the SPECIAL attribute boost is big. Just check the link in my post about attributes to see which bonus a fully stacked Unyielding set can offer on top of your own chosen stats.
---
That would be awesome! What would also be cool is if we could have shelves that work like the bobblehead stands that can display our items like: Nuka Cola, those teddy bears, picture frames etc
---
I didn't mean they were dupers because of TSE. I'm talking more about bobble heads. Duping bobble heads to raise the damage threshold to insanely high levels is actually a thing.  I know people who have openly bragged about it. 
---
Yeah I think once you're at the point where you just roam around slapping people with your TSE shotgun and have nothing better to do, it's just a matter of time before a new shiny game comes out that catches your attention.
---
Yes sir! Feel free to come have a chat! :) 
---
[https://discord.gg/4d6xP4](https://discord.gg/4d6xP4)
---
Lol go buy the game..
---
Where you have to repair the module cores.  Inside the one room is a tinker's crafting station.  On one of the tables by the door was the plan.  Granted, I've done 10 or so runs out of Silo Charlie and only once was the plan there.
---
An Angler? Their antenna thing looks so much like the weird orange glowing mushrooms you can't pick that I keep jumping out my skin at plants now  coz I think it's an angler under the surface!
---
Sounds like a pain to balance but maybe it can be a future perk card
---
We're these signs in fallout 4?
---
I personally hate the mechanics. If it‚Äôs going to take s perk it should just make it a button push. Making it a gate to even use it is just fucking stupid and wrong
---
Nope. People put time and energy into getting what they have, even if some people cheated. Rather than a wipe I think the best option would be new currency, new weapons, etc
---
I‚Äôm max budget.  One story house with 3x3 concrete foundation,  1x3 concrete front porch and 1x2 concrete side foundation for fusion generator. 
---
Main 3x3 foundation is split into a 2x2 metal warehouse garage and the L around it filled with house stuff like bed and instruments.
---
Roof on top. 
---
I one-two shot everything at whitespring with a power fist and no bobble head, it aint that hard and I never duped a thing. I have a legit furious explosive machine gun too for big stuff. 
---
I would love to visit your camp dude
---
Sure i guess once im off work
---
It's a 50/50 for me here on PC. I've been gone for a month and I hopped on today and it's either one crash/disconnect after another or the server is extremely stable and my framerate is consistently high.
---
If they go the free to play route it would be a year or 2 from now. They still have DLCs and Expansions to push. Then Finishing fixing the game all the free content to added which is actually a lot. 
---
Then after a couple DLCs and Expansions they might make the game the Base game free to play at that point.
---
All the weapons in the game need balancing--some more than others.  I started out a Heavy Guns build and quickly realized it was fairly useless.  Fortunately, STR of 12 allows a quick transistion to 2H melee, which is the opposite end of the spectrum.  
---
LOL - exactly.
---
Got mine and I'm never looking back.
---
he helped me, opened the door for me and accompanied me through the questline. you need to open that door 3 times in total until you are granted backdoor access
---
Gonna need an invite :P
---
Let's see...the game was released on 11-14 or so and it's 1-16 or so.  That's roughly 32 days...
---
So this guy has been playing...31.25 hours a day?
---
That doesn't seem entirely kosher ;)
---
The best is when there‚Äôs a second person there doing it with you or multiple people there doing it running around all impatient pressing the button to interact with the DMV bots over and over it really makes the pain of repeating it worth it hah hands down my favourite quest for accuracy though
---
You get access to a bunch more cap stashes. At least 3 in Morgantown alone. Plus higher chance they are there since most users don‚Äôt have the mutation. Add cap collector to the mix and you can make some extra cash.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but how the hell did you drop nukes when you were level 5
---
What are your AP regen items, or do the short bursts just not consume much AP?
---
Right in front of the main door, which is on the other side of the house, where you come up the mountain. Was curious about that too, luckily you always spawn on the top of the mountain.
---
ok
---
Sheer laziness or incompetence. Take your pick. They had 8 more days to test the patch for consoles (yeah yeah they get days off) and they still couldn't figure this shit out? Maybe they did find it, and couldn't figure out how to fix it. Makes sense, considering how many small bugs are just now getting fixed after two fucking months. So, expect a patch for this bug sometime in March.
---
I had 5 players just chilling in there yesterday. So I lured over a few enemies over there and rage quit. My buddy who was in the game said the enemies then targeted them, and killed them all. They were like level 40 or under.
---
Great thanks mate!
---
Yyeah, that post seems to have speculation about it increasing, but the lvl doesnt increase the def stats. Confusion could be about the lvl of the armor they crafted, since there are some variation.
---
As others have said, critique is fine. If you just want to talk shit in purple who enjoy the game, I would say don't bother.
---
If you don't like the game, that's fine. If you want to discuss what you don't like, definitely go ahead.
---
I saw the body of your post on the r/fo76filthycasuals sub was deleted, so I'm guessing it was not an actual critique, but some insults hurled at the FO76 fans
---
No it isn‚Äôt, shoving online in is never easy or cheap and they had to redo how the engine fundamentally processes everything, which used to be where THE player was and what they were doing.
---
There‚Äôs a reason they could never shove online in as dlc and call it good.
---
I haven't noticed much of a change at all.
---
Yes happens alot to me.. annoying as fuck
---
your on xbox right?
---
Yeah, Vamp on the right weapon is great. Just the other day I was using it during a SBQ fight and as long as I was firing I could basically ignore any and all minions attacking me. 
---
Had one turret next to the main door, which is on the other side of the house, where you come up the mountain. But so far I did not encounter any creatures (few days). My bet is that they spawn at the foot of the mountain, but are unable to reach/shoot it. Now I removed the turret to build a deco arc and maybe a brahmin pen :P
---
Yup. My bad
---
I'd build a lighthouse.
---
If they do this then everyone will leave, look at the games coming in the very near future. Bethesda doesnt stand a chance and they know it if they wipe the slate clean. People will give up on this game and move to something else
---
Or they could just stop making shit code that allows duping. Have other online games like this suffered from duping so much? I honestly don't know. Nothing else I've played seemed to have any issues with duping.
---
lol... the lesson of trust nobody ever trading in games in case you're banned by the devs who were too inexperienced to anticipate this? "When the dupers outsell the Atom Store that's when BGS steps in" - /u/Prototype2001
---
I like it on mine.
---
theres nbo rush dude , thanks tho 
---
Yeah, I go in prepared... and by that I mean my guns are 200% condition, I've got over 2k ammo, my armor is repaired and I have fusion cores.  I'm stocked up on food and water, and if I can find any, I use some bubblegum to make it last longer.  I use AP regen foods, and Per bonuses as well.  I'll use a magazine and bobble head if I can.  I'm constantly pounding psychotats.
---
My TSE lever is listed at 3k+ a shot depending upon how much health I have left.  All that, and not a single cheat or exploit used to accomplish it.  So when I start in on the SBQ and see her dropping 1-3% health on normal hits, and as high as 5% on vats crits I know I'm doing something right.  But, by the time everyone shows up, I stop seeing her health bar move.
---
Honestly, I'd just love to see them adjust the scaling, or at least cap it out somewhere reasonable.  I wouldn't care if 40 people showed up if I could still kill the queen I'd be more than happy to help them enjoy some content.  
---
I was thinking of starting a new guy anyway. 
---
Fair enough.. but no i'm not ignorant of the intent behind your post.  I don't see any reason for bases to take damage in the first place.  While I do agree, I think the whole system needs a revamp.  That part is less of an issue to me personally than say.. attacking a wanted player flags you to their whole team.
---
For the base part, i think it shouldn't take damage until you flag yourself with someone for PvP.  So if you weren't in pacifist but just didn't attack anyone it would also be invulnerable.
---
For me I don't need to worry about the the negatives of the ones I'm using. They lower stats that I don't care about, but I've heard class freak is pretty nice with alot more mutations.
---
No, keep playing. -Bethesda
---
He was asking...
---
If your armor is Dense, I read you do not need R3 FP
---
I hope Doom Eternal isn't coincidentally on Mars.  I'm sure it will just be a coincidence though.  Same Outpost too? 
---
Yes, i'm lvl 247, btw.
---
But as someone said, new weapons would pretty much solve most of the dupes. That is if they were as good or better.
---
This guy gets it.
---
Ha, I've actually had the opposite happen - Things have been great and smooth since the last patch. 
---
You're talking about a modicum of honor in relation to a game with a release like Fallout 76's went?  I like the game and this is just too much.
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
Which is why you're a player and not a game designer.  Branding is important.  It's why people bought this borderline dumpster fire of a game, despite all the negative press:  it's **Fallout** and not just some random post-apocalyptic Ark clone or whatever, and we loved Fallout and spent a billion dollars on Fallout 4 just a few years back.  And we'll do it again for Fallout 5.  You don't mess with branding.
---
Consoles need more testing because they are charged per patch for ps4 and Xbox. The bugs on console is same for pc like the blue screen on ps4 is a crash to desktop on pc. The cause is the same
---
True, LMG sucks which is sad.
---
Two shot 50 cal wrecks the Queen with the right build. Anything above that is icing on the cake. I prefer the 50 cal and gatling Gun over all other heavy Guns. Have traded and looted for a long while and have quite a few different ones that kick ass. If have a TSE 50 cal too but that makes the game pretty lame. I prefer different 3 star normalt two shots. Prime receiver is nice on the Queen but teedious with one more ammo type to farm.
---
Two shot gatling with rank 3 martial artist and all the other standard heavy perks is cool to.
---
Happy looting for one of the avove mate!
---
Fair enough. I also play no PA and haven't gotten any decent legendary weapons that match my play style (rifle sniping).
---
This is an RPG and we're meant to make meaningful decisions on how we want to build our characters. Sometimes we have to choose one thing at the cost of losing another. In this case we can choose to equip that lockpicking perk while losing this other one, but we have to find somewhere to stop and do that. That's a meaningful decision that affects the style and pace of gameplay.
---
Many people try to play this game as a twitch FPS. It has some aspects of that, but ultimately it's an RPG. I think any aspect of the game that causes a pause in the action is likely there on purpose and to slow the pace down. Changing perks on the fly with one button press would cheapen the experience for me. If I had designed the game I doubt I'd even allow perk changes, but if I did it would only be an option when in CAMP.
---
My problem is it seems to delete whatever blueprint I made and include everything in one generic CAMP blueprint.  Like it merges your blueprints without you doing it.
---
Wipe items I could live with, wiping characters I would not like. 
---
I found an quest item in a container that wasn't marked as a quest item. It advanced my quest line when I removed it. Maybe try emptying every container in the dam?
---
Yes but it requires you to log in, which is sketchy at times of game instability, and once in, log out and log into your friends server. All while things are dicey. 
---
It wouldnt hurt to keep around, depending on any other mods, your build, and if you have better.
---
oh lol i was messaging a guy with your gt on xbox. lol. ill see if our ps4 guy can help you out!
---
It was annoyingly funny haha 
---
Really, I thought the 'remote' ones were only using junk from your inventory?
---
If not, wow, this is very informative. Thanks!
---
you probably are the only player left in game :D Its like that movie with Will Smith 
---
There won't be an event marker, or just few if any players in the area.
---
I'd argue Whitesprings is better for flux especially behind the resort, equip green thumb for lots of it.
---
Every active game license is a money maker. In their eyes I imagine they want to retain as much of that as possible, innocent or guilty.
---
I imagine they'll be looking to try and find that compromise and level playing field customers need, only the adjustments will create positive feedback loops instead of the negative. 
---
Maybe cut inventories with a focus on keeping a little excess so anyone legit is a non-zero issue. This would still leave dupers at an advantage total item wise, but at this point just patch and develop in a way that TSEs no longer hold top tier trade value. Sure they'd be good, but who wants a load of 200-300 cap guns when they were just 2-3k?
---
Kill demand to where anyone that abused it in order to manipulate future markets just wouldn't be able to create and adapt with a "vanilla" stock pile. Limiting reagents with crafting, new more common legendary affixes that can provide better utility than a toned down but not destroyed TSE build.
---
Everyone gets forward motion, even if there's a grumble or two. 
---
I dunno tho. They seem the slow and deliberate type so I have tepid faith.
---
Doesn‚Äôt the bones scrap to ultracite?
---
No I wouldn‚Äôt play anymore.
---
Same here I‚Äôm on PS4 
---
They do this anyway. At least this way it can be dealt with in an isolated space 
---
Yeah they do but I dunno if 2 Ultracite is worth the 4 carry weight they have
---
Buy the duster and the cowboy hat and be a Regulator.
---
The real question is why was coal necessary and why did we have a resource war with China? Fucking Codsworth hasn‚Äôt had his batteries changed in 200 years and lots of shit works just fine so how was a resource war even a thing?
---
do you have a bos paint for it by any chance ?
---
Sbq is a scorchbeast. Are you saying it doesn't work this way for the queen? Given the copy and paste nature of a lot of the four programming did they make her different?
---
My invisible friend always tells me to report bugs to the support team instead
---
i can make it only white and green lol
---
Happened to me after entering an elevator.   I had to close out the game and load into a different server before it corrected.
---
Upvote 
---
The only problem I see with going this route is people who bought a dumped item on "good faith". I imagine those people are probably few and far between though...
---
Yeah, i mean that makes a lot more sense now, i played no mans sky for a little bit after they finally added the multiplayer portion, and once my character disappeared i was just done üòÇ
---
No. They've wasted enough of my time already with bugs and server crashes.

As soon as you go into an indoors area (i.e., a bunker), it seems to desync periodically and I suddenly appear in different parts of the room or change directions unexpectedly.

Some 3 star armor will sell for 1.5k depending on the perks.

Any two shot weapons for 1-2k.  Not sure on explosive weapons.

Good 2 star melee weapons can sell for 1-2k.

Serums sell for 500-1000.

It's not hard to find things to sell.  Just gotta jump in and figure it out :)

Dear Deleted, it's almost f2p as of now. Soon it's the price of Coca cola.
---
I'm approaching 50 and this is exactly what I've done the 2 times I've joined the fight. Unload my explosive dragon into her, once it breaks I just go on mob control with a Vampires Pick Axe. I don't feel so bad about being there at a somewhat low level since I'm staying in the fray and not hiding in that damn barn, aside from changing favorite items when I run outta grenades.
---
I don't usually play games for that long and if I do it's all about the stuff I collect and the characters I make. That's what keeps me playing or coming back if I get bored and it takes too long for new stuff to get released. When I run out of things to do, when I get bored doing the same things over and over, the stuff and characters are why I keep playing. To have fun with the game after all of the boring stuff is out of the way. And that's what grinding for gear is. Boring stuff, and even worse when the game is crashing and servers and disconnecting when you're trying to do that boring stuff.
---
The duped ones had to come from somewhere right? I did get my lever action TSE legit, it dropped in front of my eyes, I was even like, oh cool another just 1* two shot and I continued farming. 
---
At the end of my run I checked my gear and I was remembering the lever action, and how it came from a three star ghoul, and sure enough, two shot, explosive, and 230 dam resist while reloading on that baby! I will never sell of trade her either because I KNOW I don't dupe, and it will remain one of its unique id. I hope that the duped weapons get popped so that I'll be one of the few legit. Not to sound elitist or boastful, but I put alot of time into getting it, and it's nearly perfect for my build. Honestly though bloodied is better on my character than two shot anyway.
---
I would think the death claw guant.
---
What a shocking move from no content andy,
---
She's different.  If you notice, there's not just a pack of 5 schorched that go along with her.  There's tons of stuff.  Sometimes there's nothing on the ground and she's in the air and sometimes there's tons of stuff on the ground and she lands.
---
It sucks. This game has created a toxic community. Bethesda failed on the most crucial part of making an MMORPG, you have to facilitate a community.
---
I'm just going to go ahead and block you because what you said is the rantings of someone that clearly has problems. 
---
&gt; Unyielding armor(Enabling Barbarian &amp; Evasive). Serendipity. Adrenal Reaction. Nerd Rage. 
---
The drawback *is* having to invest in all the supporting perks and gear. If you don't focus on low health you don't need 15 perk points you just mentioned.
---
Also as a reminder you basically need Fireproof and Dense armor mods or you will die from a single grenade or explosive shot - players normally have 0 explosion resistance. So 3 more perk points and at least some of your armor mod slots.
---
Is a TSE flare possible? I want it so bad
---
I just tested and the perk cards are working for me:

Sounds like an unrelated bug.  Don't take it so personally.
---
For springs go to the battlefield Cemetery as a bear will spawn there which will drop 4-14 springs
---
For screws go to the tree house in the mire and kill the mega sloth there as they drop 4-14 screws
---
Then as a little extra for gears go to the cranberry bog on that one farm. On the map it‚Äôs a shack with cranberry‚Äôs around it then kill the mirelurk Queen there and she will tend to drop 4-14 gears. 
---
Place the door before the rest of the house and you can turn it the way you like!
---
I just read something about deliberate server crashing for the rollback save to dupe now. I have also been hearing about PS4 stability issues too but I played for 4 hours last night without a hiccup, night before had big problems though.
---
Can you not explain it?
---
But like, for real, if they reset shit, im just going to wait for personal servers and mods because fuck getting a new character past level 300 legitimately, i have worked so hard on bargaining and shit for weapons and made too many friends playing this game to just get shafted üòÇüòÇ
---
How is it broken?
---
Absolutely nor for now sadly
---
side note where do you get the powered doors?been looking for them
---
You can block from session or block the player and server hop if the are harassing you. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a game with integral pvp, it‚Äôs a part of the game.
---
I‚Äôve only found it on vendors or sometimes pre-attached. Charleston station seems to have it somewhat regularly.
---
I found a "Tactical Marine Helmet" at the Harper's Ferry vendor. Looked like someone crafted a bunch and sold them off. Would that count?
---
Yeah but the keypad is on the white side...i want it to be on the brickside..
---
OH SWEET
---
Exactly. It doesn't matter how much damage you can do if the other guy is "invincible"
---
Just thinking about the lottery gives me the s-sh-shivers!
---
I've never seen any other colors man, I know that marine helmet is black but most people are freaked out over it.
---
No.  I haven't duped or anything and don't see why I should be punished for the actions of others.  If anything, I feel like Bethesda owes me for helping them QA their own game for free, to say nothing of stuff I bought from the Atom shop that doesn't even work right.  If they can come up with a surgical way to punish the dupers/cheats I am all for it, but lumping the rest of us in with them is just collective punishment that won't even work since the people making real money off the game will just find another bunch of exploits and leave the rest of us even farther behind.  I mean you'd basically be giving them a million new level 1 characters to sell stuff to.
---
Not if teammates are booted as well. But what your telling me is it has gone perfect with no problems? Because I have problems all the time. Also I am on a cable internet connection and my friend is DSL. A slower connection. It is better that I connect to his server because I connect quickly. 
---
I'd like to see paint mixing.
---
Finding paint in the world and mixing it for the color you want for your power armor 
---
I get my best stuff from 1* 
---
Remember when youtubers tried to use this quest as a point against this game?
---
\[PC\] Terminal where you deposit Technical Data in Camp Venture can not be targeted/interacted with. Tried reloading, restarting, even uninstalling the game and reinstalling. The red drawer is just not intractable.
---
2) Preyfar (PC)3)  
---
Pretty much this. It's a Fallout thing.
---
Arrive early, drop a camp and wall off the shed opening?
---
I was able to stock up on Screws, Gears, and Springs in a fun way. I can't promise that it will work for you, but I now typically have 200 of each in my stash since I started doing this.
---
Build an awesome C.A.M.P. in a high traffic area. I am across the street from Slocum's Joe. Give stuff you don't need (extra plans, ammo, etc.) to players who stop by. If you don't use a mic then somewhere in your camp use the Small Letters to write I NEED: SPRINGS, SCREWS, or whatever you need. After giving the player a gift. Lead them to the sign. Most will drop you what they have of those items. 
---
I love crafting stuff, so I use up a lot of these, and since I started doing this, I haven't had to grind to keep my supplies stocked.
---
And the syringer!! I would also like a posting of the loot table‚Äôs so at least I know what to farm for the things I want!
---
I totally agree the sentinel and assassin's combo is just as bad as TSE for being overpowered. However people tend to look first for the weapons that are op. Once they can kill anything, they think they don't need to worry about armor or simply think power armor is good enough, but these people haven't fought other players much. On the other hand, it makes the PvP ALOT more interesting knowing that I won't be one shotted, I would love a mirror match against someone using a similar build, it would be super tactical and positioning and such actually matters.
---
Is there a limit on how high you can build?
---
Can't say. I did some "lan partys" with friends and it all seemed equally buggy. However, it was with prior versions. 1.07 almost eliminated visual glitches and really improved the performance. Wait and see as i say...
---
Great, another bug Bethesda can't figure out. I'm still not going to believe they've fixed the stuck in Power Armor bug either. 
---
I take my hat off to you
---
you might get your wish, it could be packaged with the silver shroud release.
---
I got lucky twich...first time were near deathclaw island the other time someplace i can't rember the name now
---
Bill Burr's "No reason to hit a woman" comes to mind, since you're being dramatic.
---
I'll sell you a door that opens into a solid wall for 1000 caps.
---
Dont the explosions hurt you too, like people die if their tse shotgun clips a doorframe next to them and stuff.
---
Yepyep and yep. Looks like the game is not updatable. It's leaking from all over the place, and bandage patches just break down after a day. We need real work on it or this is gonna be a total fiasco of the century. Seriously
---
I really REALLY want to buy this.
---
Have you considered prints, journals, etc?
---
You could do really well here. You're extremely talented.
---
I cracked up when J47 ran to the front desk after their number was called.
---
Oh man!  I walked right by this camp as mine us near...was afraid to get shot at so I didn't hang around. Lol
---
Yes. Hell, it is cumulative with the jetpack.
---
a Fire fly hahaha
---
Teawithakoko
---
My camp has been glitched for the past couple of weeks, I thought I'd wait for the patch to see if it would fix it before I made a complaint. Budget is always "exceeded" despite deleting objects which means I'm stuck with what I've placed. (I deleted a water purifier to see if I could lower my budget and I can't replace it for example) After the update, duplicates of several items in my base appeared in my previously empty storage (Like 2 of big items like walls and workshops and *25* duplicates of all of my crops) I went through and deleted everything in my storage but the budget is still locked at exceeded. I'm tempted to tear everything down and start fresh but I'm concerned that will leave me with no base and a full budget. 
---
Yea, I don't recall hating Halo 2 because I could dual wield stuff
---
Even before the nuke? I thought flux required a nuke. I‚Äôve never seen anyone drop a nuke anywhere besides Whitesprings
---
Share damnit
---
Personally I have had a lot of fun with the game. I have apparently been lucky and not encountered a lot of crashes or disconnects. I did encounter the damage bug a few times before it was fixed but that's really about it. 
---
I know this isn't a popular opinion but I have, generally speaking, liked 76. I would probably keep playing if servers were wiped, but then again I am getting down voted for even asking for people's opinion on it... lol 
---
There might be better ways to go about fixing things, but I honestly cannot see them being willing to expend the time and resources required to do so... so a wipe just seems like an easy way to really start fresh without everyone in the game running TSE weapons and being cap maxed on 3 different characters.
---
Your camp budget increases with your character level
---
Funny how that works huh.
---
This is everything now. The internets made it clear that we want peoples opinions on EVERYTHING and that people are not only entitled to their opinion but should be empowered by having the "right opinion" free thought is dead, liking things the mob hates is wrong and you are a trump supporting racist that loves apologizing for Bethesda.
---
Yes.  It works quite well.  So does Bird Bones
---
Alright sir
---
Absolutely! I recommend getting a dense mod on any chest armor combined with rank 3 of fireproof (endurance) ASAP. This will nullify explosive weapons against you, effectively making them standard versions of themselves.
---
Absolutely not, Ive already lost a bunch of stuff to the game crashing/bugs, don't punish the people who play it properly for duper's/exploiter's poor behaviour
---
if you need any help or bodygard, feel free to add me :)  cheers! have a nice evening!
---
I think speed demon and marsupial should be a  standard benefit while wearing power armor and it not be a mutation. Fight me
---
As a shotgunner with a TSE, I'm always on trash detail, until she comes down and I can point-blank some boomy buckshot into her bulbous butt.
---
Cheers mate
---
I killed a 3 star last night and it dropped the PC versions of Fallout and Fallout 2.
---
Ah okay thanks
---
Interesting, this is the same format that my wife and I use to find other swinger couples. Except, you will be receiving a lot less dick pics, hopefully none.
---
Why would we expect no two exact weapons?
---
With unlimited drops and a limited number of weapons , limited effects, identical items aren't an anomaly, they are inevitable.
---
Leave the server. If they follow you, leave again.
---
If they follow you again place a harassment claim to Bethesda. Record any dialog with then for evidence.
---
I love the game but go for it. There are plenty of things that are shit or could be better.
---
It‚Äôs stories like this that make my heart a little warmer.  Well, that and the fusion core shoved into the back of my armor.
---
Ah thanks mate I‚Äôll check it out
---
It's the fanboy equivalent of having the worst case of beer goggles: if you can look at it without having your eyes combust, can interact with it without having an irresistible urge to lobotomize yourself, then 10/10‚Äîmaybe not absolutely perfect but still absolutely perfect.
---
Yes, higher (or lower) intelligence will change the ballistic defense of armor and power armor.  My initial at launch was build was a 15 int crafter, when they did the patch that allowed you to move perk points I took some out of int.  Next time I repaired my power armor the ballistic stat went down.
---
Did some research on here and found out about the Int impact on defense.  So next time I repaired some armor I equipped some +int armor... And now the defense stat went back up. 
---
Farcry primal has the same map as Farcry 4. Different textures of course.  Just because it's a practice used by a few of them does not make it right.  If they are going to recycle assets don't charge me for a new game.  Todd Howard stated it was the biggest undertaking yet by Bethesda, so big in fact there were several different devs helping out.  What exactly were those extra devs doing?  Lies lies and more lies. 
---
I'm sure some of you fanboys will argue my point, and that is fine.  At the end of the day they still treated this franchise like Tupperware, getting as much use out of FO4 as they could before throwing it out.  How in heck can you be alright with that?  
---
Why is it doubtful? 
---
If you're playing a trader and have the time, it's a pretty easy task. 
---
Probably not, sunk a lot of time into my character and havent duped anything. It‚Äôd just be irritating as hell having to farm and earn all that again. Especially my awesome weapons and 14 mutation serums. Thats a lotta caps.
---
If you really want to get to them, unsub/block and get them off your recommended.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlKao_Pox5A they might do more to for content than read the first article that pops up on a google search.
---
My character actually did afterwards. Forgot to put that in
---
I want a dunwich themed anything. There's so many Mines idk why they haven't done anything with the dunwich lore, there's the lucky hole but from what I understand that's just mothman stuff. With the cult theme in this one as well I would love some more backstory on it. 
---
It's an infection you willingly catch that makes the game boring.
---
Any dupers inventory spread sheet üòÇ
---
FYI ‚Äúhigh level‚Äù is basically meaningless in this game, we all are capped at 50 SPECIAL it‚Äôs just after 50 you have more perk choices/ better developed perks 
---
Something kinda like GTA 5 did
---
I looked last night and didn't see it, I'll have to check again, I hope it wasn't one of those 1 day listings.  Nothing should be shorter than a week.
---
Yes. This is why the roof looks like it does. I cannot build any higher.
---
It's the best worst quest ever. 
---
I love to hate it.
---
Ah, yeah, it needs a mirror of the original.
---
That's fair. I haven't participated in the economy purely out of the concern that something like that might happen. Didn't want to be left with a level 20 weapon and nothing else or get account banned at some point for having duped items. 
---
I guess just a statement on what is considered a punishable offense and what isn't would also be nice. 
---
I gathered
---
I am spewing that I missed out on the Blackbird paint job because I didn't have enough atoms and was too cheap to buy it. 
---
I hope it comes back one day. 
---
‚ÄúSir/Madam I challenge you to a duel!  Do you accept or are you a coward?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúI.....am a COWARD!!!‚Äù
---
Ugh yeah I log in and a lot of times there's a drought of events.  They reduced spawns on enclave stuff.  It didn't seem so bad then.  Now it just seems downright weak.  There's a few good events for loot but they're boring.  I did .. project beanstalk yesterday for the first time.  I'm 205 and my buddy with me is like 120.  We got 5 mole rats.
---
Its like you got to clear that trash for something else possibly good to spawn.  I just want like waves of schorched coming at me with like a sloth in the back.  They really need to up their game.
---
Oh damn haha, my bad, sometimes I just take things too seriously.
---
I know exactly what you mean. You basically have to be prepared to scrap the pre-made camp blueprint and rebuild everything out of player made blueprints
---
I love those guys.  You can also occasionally find them in the wild.  Best I've found is this sort of barn due south of Sunnytop Station right along the railroad tracks.
---
yes, these are perfect parallels to violence against women...
---
Yeah, totally went over my head. My bad.
---
Meaning
---
Yeah it being 3 separate perks and not just one rank-up-able one doesn't make sense
---
Why the fuck do you need 600 weight for legendaries?
---
What about with weapons?
---
I completely agree. It‚Äôs absurd to have to scroll around for 3 different cards to pick a level 3 lock. Perk cards for special tasks like locks, hacking, harvesting, and crafting should not need to be equipped to be used.  
---
I was under the impression based on the videos i've seen that the explosion based builds seem to do more cripple damage which keeps her on the ground.  When you see her lit up orange she doesnt fly off
---
Yep...\*Cries in Blackbird paint\* Still mad I didn't get that paint job...
---
Happens ocdasionally.
---
Eventually the server comes right or crashes.
---
The important thing is...we‚Äôll know
---
No it doesn't ü§î
---
It gives -8% damage reciever from other players, if you have all five pieces, that's -40% damage. You combine it with sentinel or cavalier, which is 75% damage reduction while standing for sentinel and sprinting for cavalier. This effectively makes you an unkillable tank combined with dodgy. Dodgy is at rank 3, 30% damage reduction at the cost of 30 ap. So whenever you're shot or smacked, your ap goes down a little (then regenerates, unless they are hitting you with massive rof weapons) and you take no damage to your health bar.
---
Gunsmith is required for sure, but rank 5 is probably overkill unless you're starved for springs. I generally use a bloodied explosive .50 cal and have found the best balance for my STR/INT weighted build to be Gunsmith 3 and Demo Expert 5. If I ever get rid of batteries included I'll probably go back to Gunsmith 5 tho.
---
Well I still haven't found the Ultracite PA in any BoS quest so far (maybe it's behind a locked door and I didn't have the picklock skill at the time?) but if I do I'd have to think about using it. I only use PA so it's not a dilemma between regular armor and PA but more like a debate between Ultracite, Excavator and X-01. I think I'll stick with the excavator since it does the job protecting me and gives much better mining yields and a strength bonus.
---
As for Ultracite weapons I still haven't found any of those either (I haven't got a single legendary yet as a matter of fact) but I don't think I'd be much of a fan since the ammo would be (I suppose) a pain to find and craft compared to normal ballistic weapons and I don't know if the damage benefits would be worth it.
---
By the way I might not have understood your question correctly (I'm not sure if you're saying there's a BoS specific ending to get Ultracite PA and I have to side with them to get it or if you're simply asking if I'm planning to use the Ultracite PA when I find it) and if I haven't please try to be as spoiler-free as possible if you correct me.
---
Definitely understand that point of view since I would be in a similar boat. I'm not that hardcore but I have had a lucky drop here and there. I agree it would suck, but can also see where there could be some longer term benefits to the game's overall health.
---
The Gilded Grasshopper from Fanuiel Hall is in the Antique store near Watoga. For some reason.
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/The_Gilded_Grasshopper
---
I agree with both, but I think the later makes even more sense since expert/master are behind a level walls. 
---
I thought that was hilarious the first time I saw it, and most times since.
---
They ain‚Äôt seeing nothin. (Wish there was a laugh emote) I‚Äôll just keep on walkin. 
---
I only have to follow Bethesda‚Äôs TOU, not some random twats. If they wanna get ripe about it, orbital strike at your feet good sir. 
---
They ain‚Äôt doin nothing wrong. They role playing. But I‚Äôm not participating. I‚Äôm just exploring the land, waiting for my buddy to catch up to me in the story. 
---
I dont follow. I play on PS4. I launch the game, press a button. I am at the menu. I then click social and then see my online friend and join his game. No multiple logins. I am now online in my friends world. I then go to the map and say team up. Done. 
---
Respawning after an actual death would be impossible.
---
I got disconnected when i was almost finished. Had to do it all over again
---
Nope!
---
I am Lvl 119 and I have worked hard to get what i have. I have never used any xp cheats or duped anything. I spent 10+ hr just getting my CAMP right, Hr and Hrs of server hoping and vendor checking to get my Calibrated shocks and Jetpack.  Way to much mindnumbing WS runs, just to get decent Legendaries for trade. 
---
To have all that go pop...I would just move on to another game altogether, sadly. I really love this game and the Fallout series in general.
---
Oh it definitely does, Max your camp and gain a few levels. You aren't Max anymore
---
Serial killer role play huh noice
---
It's probably intended to prevent one team member sharing lv 3 lock picking with the entire group. 
---
From all the evidence provided, that doesn't really seem to be how legendary spawns work. There doesn't really seem to be a connection between how hard an enemy is for you personally to fight, and the quality of the legendary drop.
---
We are psyching up to do this at the weekend. ..üôÅ
---
iirc it's -50% damage against players for 2 hours? Something like that. But it really doesn't matter when it's pretty easy to boost your damage ridiculously high.
---
None so far, but it's a pretty fresh post. 
---
Before the game came out I thought they were going to use more of a learned thing like how in gta the more you run the longer your stamina becomes. 
---
so you selling that Tse dragon?
---
Even if they did wipe the servers and duping was completely impossible, people who want to PvP in particular are still going to have TSE weapons. They will have them pretty much just as fast also. They will just buy them for caps from the market for whatever the going price is. People are still going to be running around with explosive and TSE weapons. Though now they have been heavily nerfed in PvP with the Fireproof perk, so maybe not so much. It would just be some other imbalanced one shot weapon that people would complain about.
---
Same with pc.
---
In skyrim there are no grenades. How would dual wield even work?
---
Maybe take a break my man. You're allowed to play other stuff too.
---
Of course I would.  In fact, I would gladly embrace a wipe if it removed all the duped items and put TS and explosive in the same legendary slot.  
---
I found an anti-armor 10mm SMG and I loooove it. 
---
Awesome! My place is pretty close to you on a cliffside and most spawn lower and are dead before they get close. Some spawn inside and make holes in my defensive walls
---
Whoops. Typo.  I meant the Mg42. 
---
With a bit more tweaking that would be a cool system.  Need to prevent the dupers from getting that one-time use mod and duping it.  Maybe make the mod also trade locked.
---
I replied to your tag in another post, BUT just for exposure on this thread as well, our current plan is to post this week's Inside the Vault tomorrow (January 17). Thanks!
---
I love it! Unfortunately I have a Punching melee build with Talons mutation so the bleed damage always kills them before I can eat.
---
Glad i could be of assistance. 
---
I've noticed. My son put it on his t60 and it looks like ass imo. But on my x01 it's a beaut!
---
Trying to lol no one seems to notice or care so why not the wastes are lacking on quality villains so I‚Äôll take up that role
---
You can't fix methods you don't know about.  In this case, the dupers will just exploit the PTS server to discover new methods, not report them, and when the patches are pushed into production, bam, they're instantly back to duping!
---
No.  Stop telling others to stop telling others what to right jerk off.
---
Then they release more content
---
You use the replace feature when editing the wall. Change it to solid version of wall place item then change it back to window/doorway version.
---
Not at all dude, that's the legit one
---
I had another player unlock the trailer at Gorge Workshop. Waved and off he went. Didn't need the power armor, but I picked up a couple other things in there.
---
Im gona be testing this with scorched beast tonight n find out if it actually works n let you know
---
Wow, had no idea that 3*s were that rare. Then I guess when you consider trash drops and affixes, the odds of getting something useful to you decreases exponentially... 
---
It's my favorite quest. the Ghouls coming out after each number followed by me annihilating them with the Gatling gun slayed me
---
Since the patch I always get at least 2 loading screens whenever I log in or fast travel. It hasn't become an issue for me yet but I wanted to say something since you were having a worse example of the issue.
---
(psn - Teawithakoko)
---
I believe she evens lands sooner if you kill all of the scorch minions
---
Fair enough. I've done it so much though I basically don't have to think about it and they are all done in a few seconds.
---
I have zero terminal skills. I'll do easy ones once in a while but it really just takes too long.
---
How does branding have anything to do with wanting to dual wield weapons? Didn't think multiplayer would ever come to Fallout and here we are, the times... they are a'changin'.
---
And the pts would be monitored? I'm try to be positive here. Jeez
---
hehehe... I had Travelling Pharmacy 3 and Thru-Hiker 2 when I installed that mod for the first time.
---
And found I was STILL carrying 180 lbs of aid. Mind you I had something like 200 rad away which isn't affected by the TP perk.
---
Idk, with a Gauss rifle I can do sustained DPS all fight (while she's flying and grounded). The shotgun is only going to tickle her at that range so cut his number in half about.
---
Get used to it.  Either the reviewers think that this game is worse than any genocide you can pick from a history book, or he thinks it's the second coming of Jesus himself.  Both of them will screech loudly if you dare to question their beliefs.
---
I don't know which side is more obnoxious: the haters who refuse to see any of the good things that game from this game and harp on about how this is the end of Bethesda and how they'll never buy another game from them, or the fanboys whose blanket response is "well I didn't think that was bad, you're just some moron drinking the kool aid" when you point out even the smallest flaw.
---
Lol why should i? 
---
I like the idea but I can't not wonder why the in-game PVP (no, not "CAMP busting") isn't more mentioned.
---
Have you done _Battle that Never Was_ with more than 4 players? It's great. _Monster Mash_ is a ton of fun.
---
I would absolutely love to see a PVP group that leverages these events. There was a group that posted before about a Thunderdome-esque club with fight rules but why not exercise old Monster Mash?
---
BTNW is 4+ players
---
Hunter/Hunted is 4 players
---
Monster Mash is 2+
---
I would definitely join something like this for Hunter/Hunted or Monster Mash tourneys.
---
I want a TSE BB GUN. Should have been added with the atom shop child‚Äôs play pack 
---
So ... take a break?
---
If you look at the trophy stats for PS4, for example, less than 10% of players have launched a nuke.
---
This means that 90% of the people playing, at least on PS4, still have things to do. This is not indicative of the game dying soon.
---
Everyone has always said it increases with level up to 50; is this just a myth?
---
Some mods are unlearnable through dismantling and can only be used by buying or finding the mods/plans, I'm 95% sure that is one of them.
---
I suppose you would say, that bloodied requires a tailored build. (duh)
---
Not really a draw back when you do extreme damage and are unkillable.
---
Thats my guess as well especially because legendary armor effects. In PA maybe super sledge, but I really like the pitch for for non glowing enemies. 
---
I've been using a gatling for weeks now. I prefer it much more than the mini. This is mostly based on the cost of the ammunition. When I'm shooting something with the mini, if I stray off target for a quarter of a second, that means I miss like 20 bullets. With the gatling I might miss 1 or 2.
---
Mine was an armor piercing, medic, supposing smg
---
It will be because 90% already stopped playing 
---
Just completed the quest. No luck with respect to plans. 
---
Stayed and went all through A Block checking containers and even stayed for a while after another player turned up and triggered the quest again. Would have helped, but I was pressed for time. 
---
No plans from the quest, or in containers. 
---
Level 81. 
---
I always leave the workshops with whatever I've added. Leave the resource collectors unlocked as well.
---
That exists. You can use the Social menu before joining a new world so that you can immediately join a friend.
---
At what point do you go ‚ÄòHmm, maybe this is legitimate‚Äô. Oh NO, now players have been sucked into the YouTube lies, they should play the game for themselves and...wait a minute.
---
Yeah same here. But what you gonna do, they‚Äôre literally unolaceable so they are just junk üòë 
---
Yeah but you have 'mines' in the form of runes. So the idea is still there. And it would work pretty easily imo. 
---
Can confirm martial arts works, but I'm pretty sure it's a bug
---
you got a rolled back server meaning you went back to the state of which you were in before you met this guy so you never kept the stuff.
---
Have a 3* single action
---
Nothing like a legendary max level piece of wood to make the whole trip worth it. 
---
I have a level 140 and a level 75 and have never had this happen.
---
Oh, look, someone else must've gotten paid a nickel to make this post again.
---
Shoo.
---
Realistically, fallout 76 is still balanced around a single player experience. I really don't think the game would be losing anything if pvp were removed or if you had to designate a character flash pvp enabled and those characters were grouped onto servers with each other 
---
That said, the problem with TSE weapons right now is the sheer volume of them floating around. Though as you pointed out, maybe the fireproof perk changes will help balance that out a bit.
---
Yeah I'm about tired of killing 3* legendary's and either getting  1* item or nothing at all 98% of the time it's ridiculous. It should be set that if you kill one you get a 3* item even if it's a crap 3* item it should still be that way. They are at least worth more at vendors then 1 or 2* crap. 
---
so buy and wear only shielded mod its the highest r8?
---
It's beyond that, I had a character 83 at Max budget couldn't even place a power connector. Got to 95 and had a decent amount of free space.   And my level 140 character has a noticeable budget advantage. That one has a 3 building town going fully decorated
---
Read up on the FO lore when it comes to fusion cores and such. Given another few years, fusion tech would have solved all of the problems that started the wars, but sadly it didn't have time to spread around the world
---
Sure you are ;)
---
can i still do missions and explore? 
---
It may show that, but do you actually notice any increase beyond 25? I boosted my CHR to 30 something once to see how low I could get vendor prices, and once I got over 25 it stopped making a difference.
---
I'd be more okay with it if the locked chests had anything of value. 
---
I use the PC Mod Perk Loadout Manager and that is still "too much effort" cause I Just assume the locked container's content is gonna suuuuck.
---
Been meaning to get the hacker cards but there is even less incentive there, plus by design they don't lock you out entirely if you lack the skills. 
---
Huh. Seems like dual wielding is less of a jump than introducing multiplayer and taking away NPCs in a game series that established itself with a focus on single player and great NPCs....
---
I use a toolbox-style stash at workshops. Makes me snicker... LOL
---
Happy cake day‚ò∫
---
Ooooh, I'd like one of those. I've yet to find a 2 or even 3-star weapon that wasn't a lvl 45 melee. Haha~
---
I love the multiple black powder weapons. I am thinking of turning my character into a steampunk duelist. I have a couple of black powder pistols with legendary effects (nothing as sweet as those dragons though) and a few more regular ones so I set it up so I had 5 on my favorites wheel. Not sure how this works on console, but on PC those favorites are assigned to your number keys. I pull the trigger and then switch to the next pistol all the way through the 5 guns. It is pretty fun.
---
Yup. I bought it and didn't preview it like an idiot.
---
I do like the toy paint job helmet though. It's white with a red stripe down the middle 
---
Changing those two affixes to the same slot is certainly an interesting proposal. 
---
TSE weapons seem like a lot of fun, but they are inarguably overpowered.
---
I've tried that as well hitting them letting them heal and then hitting them a few times to kill them and still get the same results 
---
Not to mention the 3 cards aren't even next to each other in the menu, so you have to look around for them which just wastes more and more time. And for me (level 182) I have so many goddamn perks it really is a bitch and a half to equip and de-equip these fucking things.
---
Although... to be fair... at level 182, lockpicking isn't even worth it to be honest, half the time it's just some money or an armor piece I'm never going to put on.
---
It's Tibia rules man. 
---
Hi
---
Sell Morningstar
---
*doesn't say goodbye and the next person can't interact with the vendor*
---
I would say another player 
---
The duplication glitch is apparently easier now after the patch...
---
are ultracite explosive vents really common? or am I just getting wierd rng?
---
Please correct me if I am wrong, but it was my understanding that armor with condition higher than 100% had bonuses to ratings.  So while higher INT for crafting doesn't actually give you better stats, repairing with perks that increase condition do...at least temporarily.
---
the exploration is fun, but 70% is dead ground with nothing They said that it is 4 times bigger than the fallout 4, but it is also 4 times more empty 
---
I don't like that the quest indicator over the terminal would linger after you booted up the correct department. It meant that you couldn't tell when the quest was bugged (as it was for me) to where it would not continue. For some of us, the confusion and tedium were much-heightened, beyond the intended experience.
---
That would be the downside to dual wielding.
---
Can't use grenades, can't use sights, less accurate
---
Perhaps allow players to zoom in like in Killing Floor 2.
---
I believe they did it that way so that a buddy could lend out just one lock pick skill. Otherwise your teammate would need a charisma of 5, i think, to share out master lock pick.  The way it is set now, a teammate can shade out just master and all you need is base + expert. I think it could be handled better. But what do I know I am just a shit farmer. May I interest you in some fine brahmin doody? Got myself 3 high quality brahmin, that' 6 head. The are hard workers churning out that poo. 
---
5? 11...
---
Problem is that each weapon, armor and item does not have a unique ID. All Base crafted Gauss rifle have the same ID so there is no way to know which are crafted and which are Duped.
---
Best way forward in opinion is to search for people with multiple super rare items like 100 TSE shotguns cause it is impossible to have found so many and wipe all but 1.  MATS leave all but 1000. plans all but 1. This would wipe 99% of the dupers inventory.
---
Then allow MAX weapons and armors to go up to level 80, thus eventual making all remaining God items obsolete.  Adjust mobs levels so that if a mob is hit by a weapon more that 20 lvl below the Mob they get -90% dam taken. this would force people to get lvl 80 weapons as soon as they can.
---
Ya there will be a lot of moaning but its the only way that it would work IMO.
---
*jetpacks away* 
---
Actually, haven't been paying much attention to this sub lately. I apologize if this has been asked multiple times already. 
---
Yes we had weapon racks that would display mounted weapons 
---
With the right gear, perks, mutations, definitely. Depending on my radiation/hp, my unarmed damage can get up into the 1000s, without any buffs from food or chems, and I'm still a good ways from having a perfect gearset or fully optimized perk loadout.
---
as an actual west virginian i can say we are all super interested in who supplies power to boston. like its all my fucking office mates can talk about before noon
---
Pretty much.  And how exactly has replacing well-crafted NPCs with griefers and cheaters worked out for them? :)
---
Don't mess with branding is all I'm saying.
---
Well if you had more SLOTS, you'd have more ACTIVE cards.
---
Let SPECIAL points and SPECIAL card slots be unified until Level 50, and then just add slots and not points.
---
We're not talking about what is, we're talking about what could be.
---
Still happenning in January, lost 1300 10mm rounds, needless to say I'm facking angry
---
Why useless against SBQ?  I don't have a heavy gunner, so I am curious.
---
Thanks! You too! I'm looking for the traveling leather coat. If you come across it please let me know. It's green and grey 
---
I found a couple. Not good though. I need an explosive or ts lever action. The ts first 
---
So many times it isn't even funny.
---
I don't think I've seen so many people post about mythical server wipes on an MMO as there have been in this sub. Pretty sure 80% is intentional FUD.
---
It ain't happening. Wipes went out of style with text based MUDs.
---
Nope. I have earned everything I have in game and have never exploited or dupes. And honestly I dont understand why people care so damn much what guns and items another player has. 
---
If someone else has "the best gun in the game" by duping or earning it, it doesnt effect me even slightly. 
---
Griefing and the general pvp system is what most people have a problem with. I think if they made pvp free servers so some of us can just do our thing without dealing with other players wrecking us then that will help. 
---
If someone wants to use their duped super special tse gun in white springs and take all the kills, well so can someone who earned their gun thru hours of play. Nothing is going to change that.
---
This game is not a competition with other players for who has the best gear. It doesnt matter. I'm still gonna grind along and do my own quests and play my own way. Why is everyone so up in arms over what other people do. 
---
*let me note if its causing server instability I absolutely agree it's bad. And I agree if it's not causing instability it still should be stopped on Bethesda end. I'm in no way condoning exploting a game. I'm just saying ultimately it doesnt impact the honest players games and bo one should have their account wiped because of some bad people who choose to jump ahead of the game. 
---
And if you bitch about an in game economy I'll laugh. Because it's already been broken from the get go with vendors who barely give caps, cap limits etc. Some of us dont trade outside of our team at all. So the idea of an actual economy is silly. 
---
Would be 9 char to share a L3 LP FYI
---
Nope. Hopefully in the future. That‚Äôd be sweet
---
It really is so. You can say you need a break, but it wont stop people from leaving and choosing other mmo where theres bigger end game. It doesnt help if you blame the person. The game lacks stuff to do. A lot of stuff to pick, but for what?
---
If there was then duping would be even easier tbh
---
The often drop a uranium ore or two, should you accidentally kill one.
---
You can exit from the RB Social Menu as well. Go to list and select your icon at the top. SubMenu has a ‚ÄúLeave World‚Äù option. 
---
Good luck with that. I don't tend to grind for legendaries (I just take them as they appear) but I did get lucky during a nuke event at the Whitesprings where someone dropped an explosive pump-action shotgun in a bin. Monstrously powerful when I can get in range, haha.
---
 If there's a nuclear apocalypse I'm pretty sure playing Fallout 76 would be the least of your problems. 
---
the live action trailer for FO76 has a girl dual wielding 10mm sub machine guns and spinning while killing it... was so hot...
---
I wouldn't imagine they'd be absolutely draconian about it. There's a difference between removing 30 TSE from an account and removing the only one.
---
Despite what everything people scream and yell about, Bethesda has been quite reasonable about things.
---
All that said, never buy digital goods from a person. It is usually against ToS and can get you banned/suspended/electronically spanked of some form.
---
will do!
---
I notice this sometimes even while over encumbered. Might have something to do with your AP cards in agility, but when I hit a log or tree it goes back to normal, probably a bug.
---
Yeah I know I‚Äôll never get it, but that‚Äôs what I want 
---
Same, I basically can't use any lighting or turrets because I want to build a large structure and lights/turrets take up so much of the budget.
---
The max build height is also really small. I can't add a roof to my 4th story tho this may be because I place my C.A.M.P. at a high altitude.
---
Fair enough, I apologize for cluttering your feed with this post. 
---
As far as server wipes going out of style... that may be true... but, honestly, I cannot think of a AAA title release that has been botched as badly as 76's. ü§î

That would be a nice idea, especially because it balances itself around not being able to aim. LMB/RMB is no longer shoot/aim but hip shoot left/hip shoot right.

I have few free hours for my work, I wait fallout for a long time, it is not fun to enter 2 hours and the only thing left to do is grind 
---
You never know! 
---
Xbox and seen static item drops like not paperbags but actually items on the ground that were loot off a corpse have a video of it to post later after work seen it happen 3 times in a mater of an hour.
---
I would.   
---
Was too stubborn/lazy/stupid to use a Perk Planner so I went a bit willy nilly with some of my choices during the first 35\~ levels. I mean, I knew generally what I wanted the character to be (stealthy rifle build) but without knowing what cards were going to be unlocked when and not fully understanding how everything meshes together...some stupid choices were made that I'm now rectifying.   
---
That said, I'm rather pleased with how the character has turned out and I'm adding the final touches post level 50 (86 as of writing) and I would rather not start it all over.   
---
But I really wouldn't want to gather back all my plans. 
---
It'll be epic coupled with the Lunging Dive perk! :)

Social
---
&gt; 5% HP damage MAX, regardless of how much damage you have coming in
---
Could still easily be lethal fairly quickly with extremely fast RoF or damage ticking weapons.
---
[Like that](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agoup7/wheres_the_dual_wielding/ee81904/) I guess. Grenades would still work the same way. 
---
have a 2\* explosive single action. they exist.
---
We definitely do the pvp events, but it normally just ends up with us fighting each other. 
---
These events are fun, but I guess we are looking for more of that open world pvp. Some of the most fun I've had in game is trying to take a workshop from another equally matched team, or being chased down by a gang of bounty hunters.
---
We also have a boxing ring and death match style cage setup. The cage even has audience controlled flamethrowers. Again, it ends up being us just fighting each other.
---
I should have mentioned in the post but the pvp we planned to propose to those that reached out was essentially capture the flag but with workshops. 
---
First team to capture the opposing teams workshops wins, or something along those lines.
---
We've already have a couple likeminded people in game that we hit up for pvp. Be it raiding each other's camps or fighting over workshops. I was hoping to expand that network and give others the chance to do the same. 
---
I do fine with 5.
---
Weapon artisan repairing guns to 200% allows me to run demo expert on sqb.
---
Everything else in the game is a one shot with or without demo expert on a tse
---
Two of the three collectors were locked, but I gained access as soon as I claimed the workshop. Thanks for the reminder, though, on keeping them unlocked.
---
Well it depends! I've come across some fantastic looking camps in my travels. And also not everyone has the interest in setting up their camps for both aesthetics and utility. My first camps started off pretty abhorrent, but overtime I learned how to integrate the two and end up with something like this. Hell most folk plan their Camps, by drawing first then theory, then assembling. I just looked at the spot and knew what to build! 
---
Having a single perk card we could add as many points into as we wanted is a way better idea than having to deal with multiple cards, and all the stupid extras you end up with.
---
I can't think of any drawback unless Bethesda wanted to deliberately hamstring new perks so people could not instantly max them out. Also limits the net variety of perks we can have access to, because we have to pick duplicate cards with each level-up. Those might be intentional to make it more grindy.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
You know, I honestly thought that's the way it was spelled in the game. Could my brain be trying to tell me something?!  ;^)
---
I have a ghoul slayers meat hook, with a third hook and I'm heavily specced into the melee cards that support it and I can two swipe kill the 68 level ghouls. 
---
I've never duped. I've never exploited. And I try very hard to never take all blows on a white spring run unless I'm getting my ass handed to me in a swarm. 
---
Point is, without cheating you can get some powerful ass weapons. You cant chalk everyone you see as being as bad duper exploiter. 
---
ESO.
---
The first month of ESO was naked toons swatting invisible bees because the instancing made no sense.
---
Ask people what they think of ESO now.
---
That's a recent and pretty related example.
---
Take a close look at the brick wall power door.  On the keypad power door, the only option is to have the keypad on the white side.  That make it the outside.  If you look at how the doors fit the frames and the walls and roofs come together.  You will see that the brick is clearly the inside.
---
Similarly, every hand scanner is on the right side of a door, but uses your left hand.  All rifles are used right handed, but are left handed rifles.
---
Fixed that, and Ghoul as well. Thanks!
---
No, unless condition bar is regarded as a stat.
---
For the third time: Take a break from Fallout 76. Play something else. Many, many other games exist.
---
Pleaseeee give us loadouts and a way to get rid of duplicates!! It's becoming super tedious to switch them out all the time :(
---
All of this plus the grinding I did for mats to learn mods with. Nah I'm good.
---
You call yourself a gamer yet you're defeated by a perk menu, GG lil bro
---
I don't get it. Where is that you're finding these high level enemies? Maybe you should do lowlevel events until you find/craft better weapons?
---
When server connects happen, everything gets left in place. Even if I logged off I would leave it in place for the next player. I also don't lock anything so if I get DC'ed everything is unlocked and can be looted even if people don't take over the workshops. I also built a bunch of water pumps for weary travellers
---
Shit it is 3 per... I only have 3C.. So thank you. If I see you in the wasteland a bag of the finest brahmin excrement shall be your reward. 
---
If you have the transactional data you don't need unique numbers. You can verify things from boss drops/loot pickups.
---
But yes, those character mules that have large quantities of goods on them should be adjusted.
---
They messed with branding a hundred times over already. Hell, bringing the game into 3D was messing with branding
---
*Spoilers* after you get the quest to investigate the fort of the brotherhood of steel (in the old insane asylum), you go to the top floor to access the archives, which need an official id, prompting the start of the quest
---
Damn that‚Äôs cool 
---
Yeah, I tried with 6 people and we got melted. I put maybe 500 explosive 5mm rounds into SBQ (probably 20 stims into me) and the health just didn't move. So I bailed. I had another encounter and there were 20, it was insane, the lag was real! But we did it. Was a better experience + experience!
---
A mini-nuke lobbed at the nearby Grafton Monster (while waiting for more fusion cores to collect) was also quite heart-warming. The waste acid was very helpful in all the smelting of aluminum and lead that I had to do.
---
Could it be that new duping methot which crashes the whole server
---
Im maining a Sniper to the dragon. Love the Black Powder Rifles. They are my favorite weapons. 
---
On console more then 2 doesnt work sadly. Multiple Dragons, first instigating and then the tse should take out every enemy tho. 
---
Put a support ticket in.
---
Also make a video that sounds hilarious.
---
Heh, fair enough, I didn't play ESO so didn't know it was that busted at the start. I do appreciate the fact that the example that came to mind was another Bethesda game though. 
---
The ghoul really was the icing on the cake haha
---
Thanks! And don't worry about the downvotes dude, that's some great advice.
---
So, like Xur?
---
Awol armanents and uranium fever are where I find 80% of my decent drops.
---
I believe the one in question is called Marine Combat Helmet, not Marine Assault Helmet.
---
Yes, since the beginning and before and after every patch. I once sat there for 10 minutes until the menu loaded. Lag? Idk
---
"No, this is Reddit!"

I heard of one l33t haxor managed a respawn after death.
---
In most cases, high level enemies indicate high level content intended for higher level players.  In some cases, a higher level in the area will spawn a group of high levels.  The later is usually in the grindy spots.  If youre in the grindy spots, that's kind of how it goes, "tag" and hide.  If youre not in the grindy spots, I cant really imagine this being a constant thing.
---
I just claim it defend it get my plans and leave it I really don't see the point as I can scavenge for materials but that's just how I do
---
WoW was like that for a long while. The only stuff people did back then was grinding dailies faction rep and running instances. It got old pretty quickly
---
What does the Brahmin pen do?
---
I have the same problem. I've resorted to using a garage door with a level 3 locked terminal on it. Not as secure, but at least the intruder has to deal with being wanted.
---
Nothing of what I said pertains solely to bobblehead or magazine exploits. A decent  Two shot explosive weapon still one shots every enemy in the game besides a SBQ and it is retarded
---
"Good sir" 
---
I have had luck finishing them off with a 10smg
---
You and me both my friend... I think losing the plans would be the most painful part of it... that or maybe my spring collection...
---
Can we share?
---
I‚Äôve got a similar one
---
I get what your saying but it sounds a little selfish. No offense. 
---
I‚Äôm not going to show up or start a SQB run and ask everyone what cards they‚Äôre running. And you really can‚Äôt expect people to know how your stacked up. 
---
There are plenty of things that will whittle down your health. Got an explosive rifle? Round or two at your feet would hurt a bit right? Surrounded? Grenade at your toes. Your constantly being irradiated (slowly if in PA) but that eats health too. 
---
I mean think about what your saying. Your asking me, (other players) to not kill things they can kill so you can kill something you want to kill. 
---
So who has the murder ‚Äòright of way‚Äô so to speak? 
---
Don‚Äôt worry low level folks, if you see me chop chop choppin that meat, jump in the ruckus with me. You go left, I‚Äôll go right and we‚Äôll meet in the middle. 
---
You too Mr adrenaline tank dude. I‚Äôll turn off passive and take the 5 wanted if throwing a few rounds at you helps keep your ball rollin. 
---
Bottom line? 
---
When I show up, I show up to put in work. Not sit there while billy badass takes on the entire area. 
---
We‚Äôre doing the very beginning of the main quest line so, yeah, I don‚Äôt get it either :/
---
You bring up a pretty good point. Looks like I'll need to do some more renovating.
---
Nah the robots will be a problem and new players would struggle to make it down there. I think flatwoods would be a better option.
---
I'm surprised it didn't drop Skyrim. 
---
I get why it's separate cards. They don't want you to get the Master level in consecutive levels. They wanted to spread them out more.
---
It is what it is. Hopefully Bethesda do something to make it less annoying to swap around.
---
Maybe loadouts that you can hotkey hotswap without needing to go into your Perk menu.
---
Ill be happy to take some off your hands on pc, im fusion core poor since patch. I guess i had too much jetpack fun.

---
Feature change request regarding respawning on player entry to an area.
---
I generally play solo and like to use a lot of stealth. One significant annoyance is that if another player enters the area you are in, all of the enemies often respawn. This usually causes death unless it's a really low level area because you're suddenly surrounded by enemies that you've already killed, and have no time to get to hide as you are instantly spotted. 
---
A better system would be to respawn enemies when a player enters only if there are no other players in the area already. Players who want to play that area from scratch can come back later when it is not already being used or they can assist the first player with the existing set of enemies. It's not very realistic to have a bunch of enemies appearing right next to you out of thin air.
---
Holy Jesus!  I wonder if that's always been there?
---
Have you set the nuke off yet?
---
Purely just to look cool :p

Regen armor only works out of combat, right?

Yeah. I just discovered HF last night at Lvl 51. Taking it slow.

I can easily just blow the whole camp up with my TSE shotgun, and since you have a bounty it would cost me nothing to destroy your buildings anyway. And since I don't keep any caps on my character you wouldn't gain anything from killing me back.

Orrrrr the most annoying drops that drop from EVERY 3 star enemy: assassins leather armor pieces ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
It would be nice if there was a way for you to decon legendary weapons and armor to get a single spring or something equivalent of value. I dont like hauling heavy weapons and armor around to try and sell. At least give us a better option than dropping trash 1 star legendary stuff. Dropped loot has to be bad to some degree for servers. Just let us scrap them.
---
At minimum, if you have already maxed out a card, it should not give you any more copies of that card when a pack is opened.
---
They probably break that fast cause we never clean them
---
The hardest part about this will be autoscrapping toys.
---
Funny enough, there's a reference to that at Camden Park.
---
Boxes certainly get the job done! And no, the paintings can't be passed or shot through.
---
Couldn't agree more, stability and the nuke zone thing. Bethesda here our cries!
---
Does having your lamp on at all make it drain faster?
---
That could actually work, and making a build arround it, you can't use grenades or aim, but you have an insane DPS. 
---
Not everything is fallout, I understand, it's not the only thing I'm playing, but it makes me angry to have paid so much 
---
Why would you encourage them putting this as an atom shop item and not an obtainable in game item?
---
Oooh, I like that idea. Instead of losing everything just give us the option to play on "untainted" servers. 
---
Don't judge the way I live my life.
---
It also makes it a blast

I‚Äôm in! 
---
Right. Unfortunately you do drop your junk.
---
I don't think you drop your junk or lose caps in H/H or BTNW.
---
I have many cards unlocked so it's not that bad to make adjustments.
---
Also have a variety of weapons / armor in my stash in case I want to mess around with a different build down the road.
---
I found a nice spot SE side of the map everything 30 caps distance from me or the vault and since I max my money daily 30 caps isn't that big of a deal any more
---
Given you can switch cards and gear at will not sure much else is needed.
---
Or, in the extremely common cases, they drop absolutely nothing! I mean sure your three star legendary is cool but... I didn‚Äôt even get a weapon from mine jokes on you. 
---
I‚Äôd at least like my character to not be a little bitch and to stop holding pistol with 2 hands
---
I just got mind today and not only is it flimsy and poorly made, the stickers are not even place properly, and I'm a huge fan and this will probably be the last money I ever spend in anything Bethesda
---
Lol no fooling?
---
The fact that pvp interaction is exceedingly rare speaks volumes to how uninterested most of the fanbase is with PvP.
---
Fans of the franchise are playing it *despite* the pvp aspects, not because of it.  Bethesda knew this, that's why they included the slap system.  Except what was to be a compromise just ends up being unsatisfying to both pvp and pve play styles.
---
&gt;For such a violent storyline and premise it's so odd to have such a mindset and also enjoy such a storyline.
---
Not it isn't, there are what seven or so games in this franchise with no pvp to them?  
---
Add duping and exploits to an already poorly designed pvp system, and what you get is the nonsense we have right now.

I don't think you can get the pond, I had a rough time as is trying g to get the lead + junk

&gt;A small, collapse tent with some scorched. Minor loot.
---
If its the same thing, the small burning tent surrounded by scorched often drops plans.
---
slap damage should be a constant fraction of available health. This way the first hit is substantial but every subsequent hit becomes more insignificant.
---
If you equip and in equip them together they should stay side by side 
---
How hard did you power level to get to this stage? Have you explored all the story and lore in the game? Doesn't sound like it.
---
&gt; Bethesda usually tries to avoid doing anything that Obsidian did in New Vegas
---
this old canard
---
Someone else already mentioned that Bethesda had Alien Epoxy in Mothership Zeta for Fallout 3, which does the same thing as weapon repair kits (and it's not exactly a unique and original idea to have consumables that repair your equipment...). But are you maybe forgetting that the first game to even officially *have* weapon modding or survival mechanics was New Vegas? Did you miss the multiple references to New Vegas in Fallout 4 and its DLC, or how Fallout 76 brought back the Grenade Launcher and Auto Grenade Launcher that were introduced in New Vegas?
---
I was confused too. It‚Äôs a little confusing. Had no idea that the fusion cores regenerating charge was a bug until yesterday :( 
---
This is nice, but I prefer it untouched because I have to pay extra for all the stuff that someone already built. IMO it shouldn't cost any more, it should just remove the spent materials from your resource pool.
---
Im on PS4 :(
---
It‚Äôs a genuine problem don‚Äôt be a jerk about it. 
---
Actually they did, kind of.  In the vault dlc you could make your vault with each piece having decor belonging to a room.  Such as kitchen, maintenance, overseers, and medical Bay.
---
I have an instigators grognak axe...that thing was scary! A week or two ago though it was not doing nearly as much damage, then really noticed it was only doing half damage this week...sad panda.
---
Good point. I figured charisma would be an easy one since each point equals a 1% increase in selling prices. I tested using a bobblehead since they're worth 100 caps and it's easy to calculate percentages at a glance. Once I got charisma over 25 the price stopped going up, even after equipping hard bargain.
---
Who knows, maybe it it's a hard cap on vendor pricing that doesn't impact other stat increases, but at this point I don't have any unyielding stuff to test it with.
---
I'm at 106 and while I'm not worried about my playstyle being nerfed any time soon, I am getting a little bored of blasting everything with a shotgun. I don't really need perks for my build anymore so I've started to think about taking perks to move into another weapon type just to keep things fresh.
---
A testament to the game sucking me in that much that I was too busy enjoying it xD
---
I put in a support ticket for this. They responded by sending me an email telling me to update my video drivers (which are up to date, by the way). Why the hell would video drivers make the server disconnect? Dicks.
---
One guy buys duped TSE gatling.  Two other guys buy duped TSE shotguns.  The two guys ALSO dupe bobbleheads.  Game, set, match.  PvP at it's finest.
---
I think it's more that they just half-assed it. I can't imagine they did any sort of playtesting and didn't realize that people would be maximizing how they could swap cards around without needing to add more points to an attribute. It feels like they just wanted to do something a little different, and made it functional but certainly it hasn't been given a lot of thought.
---
I just did that one last night!  I thought it was great.
---
I thought the same about vendor prices. 
---
Yeah I totally get that.
---
Wonderful
---
I‚Äôm interested to nuke Grafton steel
---
At least in the NA region, it's active enough that I can't recall ever seeing the same person twice. Being a merchant isn't really well supported at the moment, but they plan on adding some form of player vending in the future.
---
I have the leg mods that regen AP while moving but I'm not sure if they work in the air. The bursts also consume little AP.
---
really if someone is in pacifist mode they should just be unable to be harmed - workshops disable this as does any wanted tag to stop people from shooting and running 
---
at same time they should really have some kind of full pvp mode tag that gives the player extra bonuses for playing in it so that pvp heavy people can get a bonus and pve only people can get a bonus 
---
When she is in the air, all the Grognaks should be whacking adds, when she lands....SWITCH!
---
The ‚Äúmeta‚Äù right now is to drop it at fissure prime in the bottom right of the map, or to drop it at the whitesprings resort. Or if you‚Äôre after flux, people drop at harpers ferry
---
It's been running fine on Xbox. I had one DC, but that was because Comcast is shit and my internet flaked out for a minute.
---
We all paid for the game. To get where you are at, you had to have put what, 80-100 hours into the game? I'd say that's a pretty good value for the amount of time you spent playing.
---
It's a bug with that weapon. 
---
That's an ad for Mas Fusion. A building in Boston.
---
The real sin is not having new decals for 76 in itself.
---
I never thought about it like that. Yeah it is like battle bots haha
---
I like the timing aspect you suggested. I'll suggest that next time we set some up, thanks.
---
The obstacle course idea is cool, but I think we are more about the combat. I hope someone see this and makes one though.
---
A better informed public wasn‚Äôt even one of my reasons. Cmon man if you‚Äôre gonna respond you gotta do better than that.
---
That's brutal. Has an Interview with a ~~Vampire~~ Cannibal vibe to it.
---
Block them before responding to give yourself a head start =P
---
Ah gotcha
---
Well I never take junk into MM
---
I know what we‚Äôre there for :p
---
I actually don't like the look of the camo paint job. wish it looked a bit better.
---
Height increase so much. I spent 2 hours building a hotel only to find out it was too tall to put a roof on.
---
Golden Holotape. Single tamable creature, the glitched out "left leg" note that never awards you anything and wont be out of inventory til you log out and back in, Scavenger which marks a location on the map and directs you to the steamer trunk to loot, Open grave with union or confederate outfit plan, 4 mannequins and a note of remembrance, Treasure hunter has a treasure map on him, The broken tent has trapper plans, and the one where they are ranting about the government.. female name starts with a "K".. that's all I got. 
---
Burn Deathclaw! Burn! 
---
great job but you might want some downspouts around the 2nd floor deck.  Water runoff will lead to rot eventually :-)
---
Thank you, I was bummed that it was not working but I have other melee weapons.
---
But he's saying the ad wouldn't need to be in WV. It's liek So Cal Edison (power company in Southern California) having an advertisement in Alaska.
---
Nah, I am with you. Played for 6 hours straight after the patch. Didn't DC once, then a little later in the day was having some issues but that was only because I accepted a game invite while I was already loading into a world. Smooth sailing mostly though. 
---
Lvl 205 and don't notice much of a difference between that lvl and a lvl 60 alt.  
---
I‚Äôd pewp there. 
---
*tomacco flashbacks intensify*
---
yes it's a well known problem, hope that Bethesda do something about that, it's my favorite melee weapon
---
We are all pretty much settled in the end game so we kinda just consider the caps the price of admission for pvping. 
---
I've put in soooo many tickets. They stopped replying. 
---
Being lvl 267 implies a well above average time investment grinding the end game, (that or the old trap exploit) as well as the obviously higher chance of obtaining OP gear. As stated in my post, I concluded they were probably going to monopolize the event and rush through it without caring about others.
---
 The entire point of my post was to illustrate the assumptions I made towards their etiquette based on their level, and how I was wrong. Not that he was inherently stronger from leveling up.
---
Well the dense mod is I believe 66%, from other people's tests. Then fireproof is 15 30 45 so I think at rank 2 you are still taking miniscule explosive damage. Not very much at all but a tiny bit. So I'm guessing that's where it's coming from?
---
Lmao. Exactly why it's not rare: Extractor.
---
I don't roam around and hope for the loot, I get 14 every 30 minutes. You sad little thing. I don't use this often: git gud kid.
---
And have to fill out a form 9999?  I don't think so!
---
95% of the assets in 76 are just from 4. The only new things really are some of the villains.
---
The best part of the frogs at white springs is that there are often 1-7 nuka colas/cherries/quantums just right in that swimming pool area.
---
Not at all. I've actually had that in mind as I stated before.
---
I just view resource gathering and attacks from players as part of the game's charms. 
---
With the ability to repair easily, I don't mind spending some time grinding to fix the place up.
---
And surprisingly, I've never actually had people that weren't bounty hunting coming to my place to trash it. And most of the hunters were actually rather polite when it came to scouring my house :p
---
It doesn't require power leveling or grinding to get all of the story. Hell, I've frittered away a lot of time and have still explored almost every location and caught up with all of established background.
---
Can't wait for Faction PvP.
---
You know, this idea of maybe a "trade in any 3 1-star items or 6 1-star items for a random 2 or 3 star item of your level would be a great way to put junk 1 stars to use. maybe make its level related to the level of the items put in? So if they are all level 50 you get a 50.
---
anyone been hit yet? it's bullshit that I have to be punished because of their incompetence.
---
I was genuinely curious if you could get the marine helmet in game, even made a thread a couple days ago. I was offered a couple and figured it was OK since you could scrap them to learn the plan.
---
now I'm kinda stuck. even if I drop the original, I still have the plan.
---
I had a lengendary, 3\*\*\* broadsider drop for me yesterday from the queen. Ended up in a bag, sorry. 
---
But isn't the idea that it penetrates material?
---
This is incorrect, they can trace every single item from every single player at any given time. 
---
Check map, last clue is at a far away farm/ house if I recall.
---
Show on map in the data tab on quests is your friend.
---
Can‚Äôt switch special points at will though and good chance if you need to switch from melee to rifle you‚Äôre gonna have to get an extra 20-30 levels to switch all the specials and get max ranked new cards
---
Between the caps, stims, and other rewards from completing the defense events I feel like I always come out ahead, even if it does cost more to claim.
---
There is no such thing as Marine Combat Helmet, I made the same mistake by crossposting this thread:D The name is Tactical for the wetsuit and Assault for the actual helmet
---
Its a fertilizer resource. It makes 5 before you have to empty it. I currently have 3 Brahmin, making me 15 bags of the finest excrement in the wasteland.
---
Correct. But while sneaking you have a lot of time out of combat lol
---
Enforcer and she stays on the ground the entire fight
---
I loved the Fallout Franchise from 1 through to 3, 4 was iffy but I want this disgusting practice of releasing broken games and stuffing microtransactions in to stop by 5. So yeah monitoring how well or poor the community reacts to shit EA catches flack for is important.
---
No worries i just want to know if it can drop as legendary and you just confirmed that for me, thanks!!
---
Doesn't affect us, we have too many points to care.  If anything we would love to see more imbalanced nerfs and buffs.  Changes the game.  if Bethesda really cared about bringing this game back, they can increase the Armors and Weapons levels, getting rid of the duped market.  Can't sell shitty lvl 45 or 50 weapons if weapons scale to 100 :) Ignore those idiots that say those can be duped too. but to farm these type of items. get them and then dupe them takes a long time and who says they have to make it lvl 100 now. do them in increments 5 to 10 levels a few months at a time.  This can definitely drain the dupe market considerablly, look at me rant on about nothing you posted on about lmfao.  In otherwords, we are just waiting for the next new rage to farm for tbh. (i am level 270 atm)
---
Glad I'm not the only one who noticed this.  I came here recently looking for the story of what's going on.  I figured, "a subreddit devoted to Fallout 76 should surely let me know what "the haps" is, as the kids say.  If Fallout 76 is all they discuss, then I should find reviews and information!"
---
What a fool I was.
---
Hunting deathclaws was good sport in fonv. Make sure to sweep the leg when they got close. Easy peasy
---
If I'm logging out for the day and have workshops claimed I always try to find a lower level person who might want it and ask them to team up before logging out. That way I know that my work won't go to waste, and they get some free materials and fast travel spots.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just unlucky. Seems everybody is having very different experiences with this one. 
---
I would love if they brought back upkeep you could do to weapons and armor on your Pip-Boy. 
---
I think a huge problem is that for many things which should be default QoL features, they've just punted and said "oh well. just make it a perk." They are absolved from fixing/adding stuff people want and people more or less accept it. 
---
I get that it's a survival game, but it seems like level 1-35 is harder than anything past that. You can't really start to customize a build because of all the "required" perks you need for food and water and carry weight just to be reasonably functional.
---
Tank hunter in Per.
---
And buggy broken game.
---
I have a couple of TSE in the heavy weapon category but  I generally only use them for the queen.  In most other situations I just end up blowing myself up along with the enemy.
---
Early version 
---
Doesn't mean it doesn't happen for others, I also had a pretty good experience. But I also noticed when i entered certain areas, like I would enter the bog and it would crash consistently on the same server, 5-6 times every time. I switch servers and it works fine. So it is definitely server dependent. 
---
Don't forget the dupers, you might have just been lucky not to have dupers on your server, if two people are duping at the same time it will crash the server. Also dupers know how to crash servers for shits and giggles
---
Yes.  Since beta. 
---
No worries brother, I was really hoping it DID work too because it would help extend the useful life of over repaired chainsaw, rippers, mr handy buzz blades, and the high speed shredding chain gun melee.
---
For the interior side, I actually just picked the paintings that were large enough to fit over the actual doorway.
---
On the bricked side, I would sometimes need to stack multiple paintings atop one another because from that side some of the wall decor doesn't go onto the wall right.
---
I don't understand why. If they hate Fallout 76 they should only downvote the ones speaking good about the game but if they love the game they should downvote only the ones speaking bad about it. But as you said, everything is downvoted which makes no sense. Bots maybe?
---
I love turning them into food, just so they don‚Äôt grow up into rad toads
---
Same happened to me yesterday. We usually spend 10 minutes at most with SBQ. There were at least 4 hiding in the shrubs after hitting the queen twice. It took us 23 minutes to kill the damn thing. 
---
Idk where it is on the map yet.
---
If you spent 300+ hours in this game already - take a break until new content is released. This game is not meant to be played like your traditional MMO game.
---
Meanwhile the largest post on front page is complaining that they NEED perk card changes because lock picking is so incredibly important.
---
After level 50 i never opened a safe worth my time either. Y'all need to stop being so basic and literal.
---
I'm agree. It's just difficult finding people willing to actually do it. 
---
Right now we have to resort to accruing bounties to get something going. 
---
Community is pretty great. I'm at about 175 hours and have only run into one griefer. On the other hand, I've run into dozens of folks who give me free stuff and I have a solid group of good friends in the game now who are active and amazing.
---
I play on a gaming laptop, it has a GTX 980M and 16GB of RAM and it runs on Ultra just fine. 
---
Player trading is reportedly coming at some point.
---
SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!
---
No, I would love that though. A pistol in 1 hand and knife in the other would be lots of fun.
---
You can get it $20 bucks online however I don't wanna wait a week for it to be delivered, but it also costs about 15 bucks more after tax in-store
---
If you want funny, get the VOX quest and hopefully get the option to tag a possum.
---
So its the fertilizer resource, and when you do a Brahmin spawns with it, if they die the unit is destroyed :( 
---
is it higher than Black diamond with armor piercing mod (spikes)?
---
Yes. Stats have diminishing returns but as someone else pointed out, carry weight and melee dmg still increase with every point 
---
Same issue with that axe is preventing it from benefiting from Luck of the Draw perk
---
It doesn't matter how many people agree, they will still do it. If this post were to get 10000 upvotes it still probably wouldn't change the people who don't do anything.
---
What do you play on? My group is looking to find other teams to go against. 
---
PS4 here.
---
The durability thing is in the text under the luck special when you level up
---
my corn soup keeps disapearring, i had 100 corn soup and 30 minutes later i had only 15
---
Well that doesn't answer if condition greater than 100% gives bonuses to ratings.  I'm pretty sure I have seen where it does, but it could have been a bug.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/actfam/lpt_for_ps4_users/
---
That might help
---
I dont know off hand. I'm at work. But I know every piece is deep pocketed and my carry weight is nearly 400
---
Frog
---
Yes, especially since it is a GaaS type game now instead of a single player campaign. Had it been single player, we would have required more in terms of quest lines, NPCs, and engagement. But since it's online co-op(?), lacking the things a single player campaign would have, they still have a long way to go. 
---
I will add, I have had a lot of fun playing the game since launch (and play it daily for hours) but close to ideal, it is not. We will have to go through more iterations of patches and balancing as well as new content, which will probably introduce new problems and issues. This game will have to be out a at least 6 months before we can start stating it is getting to be ideal as well as how BGS handles problems and content deployment down the road. They didn't do themselves any favors by releasing the game in the state it was in, as well as a total lack of communication right off the bat. 
---
I'm on PC but I'm not that high a level yet. I don't want to become the very thing I said I don't want others to have to deal with.
---
I really don't like "git gud", however next time hit her with the endangerol syringer and higher DPS and she is always way, way faster with &lt;10, preferable just my squad of 2-4.
---
I need a video of this!! :)
---
Organize something with reddit. PVP, role play, or invent your own new mini game. MMO's must be pretty boring if all you do is colour inside the lines.
---
I've been running into this quite a bit as well. There's a place in the Forest with over a dozen safes next to a trailer. I tested it out there once. Only two of the safes had anything in them, and I hadn't been there in weeeeekssss üò≠
---
Thanks, I did this last week and it helped a lot. But between yesterday and today, not even kidding I‚Äôve had about 15 blue screens. 
---
That and the US refusing to share fusion tech after it was invented
---
&gt; unkillable
---
There are a few niche weaknesses, but yeah for now. I expect this and TSE weapons to get a nerf at some point.
---
I would be fine with this.  Honestly this game needs more boss like mobs the queen just isnt enough.
---
bamboozled again. 
---
And for me, the time it saved me was well worth some extra caps. I barely had to do anything before getting to the "good part" of workshop ownership.
---
Did that one already but I used it on a deathclaw. If/when I start a new character I will definitely consider finding an opossum.
---
Please bring back the prototype/ YCS gauss rifle designs back too
---
I'm with this guy. I've got almost 200 hours in and like where my character is with perks, items, etc. I wont be putting that much in to get back to where I am. I've got other games to play.
---
Gotta love those Epic Rolling Pins.
---
I was just thinking about this last night! I'd love some sugar bombs or nuka cola wall paper! 
---
Thank you! Glad to help! 
---
Yeah I think Xbox got the better side of the patch.  Most complaints have been on ps4/PC.
---
It's hard in the beginning, but trust me it gets better as you level up, you become demi-gods .. try avoid the enemies if you can until you ready. Melee is the way to go until you ready, weapons are tougher unless you get the right perks .. take a hammer or pick axe and it will take care of most problems and mix it up with guns when you feel they not doing the job. I sort of went from melee to guns to melee because I felt melee wasn't doing the job. Once you get to later levels you will be cruising thru these guys ..

4: Any time I'm around Poseidon plant, I get intermittent freezes. Screen freezes, no buttons work. These freezes can last several minutes before resuming action. Have been able to repeat many times. Even when not frozen, it will be very buggy. Ex: I will try to fast-travel to my camp. Click fast travel, it does nothing. I end up fast travelling about a minute or two later without warning. Checked and CPU is not maxing out or anything; it averages 40-50% utilization. Memory utilization is nominal.
---
Place your camp apx 3 stories up. 
---
A good place for a height measure is in the pylons - the horizontal beams can be easily climbed to.
---
I did forget about that perk, I'll admit, so what we're really debating is the DPS numbers between a Gauss rifle and any of the three shotguns, double barrel I'm sure cannot keep up, combat definitely can and pump, probably. But nobody has tested the weapons hard DPS. Both with fully optimized builds mind you and, identical targets and conditions, as well as bloodied and explosive.
---
I love the response you get.  It's just proof that this subreddit is just a circlejerk that despises opposing opinions.  "This attitude problem is bad."  "FINE WELL YOU KNOW WHAT LEAVE, JUST LEAVE, REEEEEEEEE"
---
It's the bomber jacket from the shop
---
On top of that, I'm sick and tired of killing 3* legendaries to have nothing spawn st all on them. 
---
bring back dr mobius' glove
---
I got 13 players on a PS4 message group; want to organize workshop PVP with us? Maybe even start at level 5 so we don't have to play with your lame legendaries.
---
I like the groups because it flashes on screen when playing. PSNid Enterres
---
So we should be happy with how it is because it could be worse? That's never a valid argument.
---
I like a lot of things about the perk card system, but the fact is they just implemented it really badly.
---
Well... my build consists of an Auto Grenade Launcher/Explosive Combat Rifle/Explosive Combat Shotgun/Handmade Rifle/The Dragon/Two Shot Western Revolver/Super Sledge &amp; a Power Fist. I change up my perks depending on what I'm using, so if Beth decides to nerf a build I've got plenty to fall back onto.
---
Although the game needs more weapon buffs not nerfs, a lot of weapons don't really hold their own in the end game on level 68-80 enemies, 90% of the heavy weapons suck, sniper rifle damage leaves much to be desired, all pistols suck too (unless you got a good effect on it).
---
Most of the complaints I've seen so far have generally been things that were already happening before the patch and had nothing to do with it particularly
---
Huh I actually didn't know that.
---
Must have went under my radar since I've been building and scrapping bases frequently since I started. Good to know!
---
Thanks for the advice. It actually means a lot. I‚Äôll try sticking it out while we do the quests :)
---
Likely true. They are both additive values. It depends how bonkers people can get that 4% that does get reduced by dodgy/assassins/sent/cav
---
How much do you want for these pages? ;P

---
You absolutely do, but most of the time people make really ugly or inefficient power setups that you have to pay extra for just to fix it. For example, last time I went to Grafton Steel someone had put up about 10 small generators and a bunch of pylons when the power plant was fixed and giving 100 power to the box. 
---
I've built my CAMP right next to one of these.   
---
Occasionally two safes will spawn right on top of each other, but one is turned a few degrees and they're constantly flashing from one to the other...looks weird and never has anything of value (mostly 10mm ammo). 
---
Have also found the tent/dead responder and the crashed satellite, another time it was a downed vertibird. 
---
I got 1 of those but it has explosive lol
---
it's a daily quest, so you might be able to do it again?
---
I got an anti-armor ‚ÄúThe Dragon‚Äù last night.   Opening shots are insane now.  lol
---
If this was like any other fallout game Id say yeah, because i enjoyed replaying all those games but with this I never really cared for any of the missions because I don't really tend to listen to holotapes and it's basically just grinding for hours so I don't think I could restart (level 104 and not meaning to complain)
---
No joke, I would literally offer up 100 caps to see that happen. It's always oddly cathartic watching your stuff get destroyed.
---
That is a scorchbeast ya got on ya hands
---
I think that the sole reason is my internet. If I didnt have good internet, then I would never have been able to play.
---
Sweet! I'm not sure how many will be down to start level 5s but I'll suggest it. 
---
I'll be on in the next hour or two. I'll talk to my group and see how many we have to get something going. Expect a PSN message. 
---
The main quest has a huge difficulty spike at a certain point.  This is primarily due to it taking you to areas where higher level players are, resulting is spawns that are much higher than you.
---
I was pleasantly surprised one time I connected right after the servers came up after a recent patch.  The Top of the World area actually had mobs my level instead of 20 levels higher for once.
---
In my experience, it would loop around to max, but then if you kept going, it would snap back down to whatever number it started fast scrolling at (which i think is after 10 or so items). So it would go 200, 199, 198, 197, 195, start zooming down, go past zero, keep zooming, and hit 195, 194, 193, 192, 191, 190, fast scrolling back around to 190, 189, etc (i used 5 for the example, but as mentioned I think it's closer to 10)
---
Lol, you heard him Bethesda, put something like that on the shop.
---
No offense taken, but you told the guy he's not seeing the value in what you're doing and i'm telling you why it isn't valuable to \*me\*, not everyone ever.  Not to mention, if you aren't running Adrenaline in your endgame build that's on you and your drastically reduced damage potential.
---
As for health, that's on Bethesda that i'm literally never, ever threatened anymore with full PA and full mutations and haven't died unless someone ran in front of me while i'm winging her to bring her down, and that's an instant death not something preventable.
---
I really don't think there is an issue with people showing up and doing their best, including you, but to proudly declare you are helping those who nuked requires the caveat that you may very well not be.  It seems at the end you are railing at me and defending other players when in the post you replied to I said you are welcome to attack her with me and my group anyway, Mr. Mischaracterizer.
---
Bottom line?  Leave a few mobs on my back, and don't ask me to pat yours at the end when i've nuked and killed the Queen for ya.
---
I think, if any DEV thinks "that's just how things are", the improvements made for the game would be very rare ;)
---
Hah! there's another like that at the water park. Locked door. Huge hole in the wall ten feet away.
---
Agreed the results for actually spending points on the skill and doing the mini game aren't really worth it. These days I'm mostly just looking for steel to scrap though so anything helps.
---
Im starting to think its not the game. When i play i hardly ever cradh or blue screen. I played 4 hours ladt night no problems. Is it a ps4 pro issue?
---
Jeez, with the proper perk that sounds like a 1-shot kill on most standard enemies. Not just toss in a bit of Instigating with a dash of Explosive rounds and you've got some proper overkill. 
---
Can we get holstered guns displayed on our backs in fo4/76 this is one of the main changes I want to the modern games 
---
May I ask where you get the tent plan
---
Its not necessarily likes because they had to do major work to the engine to support multiplayer. So they didn't hire a tone of artists, this is their first foray into multiplayer, there are going to be bugs. 
---
They could definitely make an effort to increase their patch cycle, Id much rather see a two week patch cycle where they are updating less stuff but more often instead of the current 4 week cycle.
---
Im okay if you call me a fan boi, I really enjoy the game. Ive absolutely got my $30 worth out of this game. 
---
Proof?
---
My evidence comes from the total lack of any evidence. Would love to see some.
---
How mich Chaos are u want that you make me one
---
Not hard to grind with a duped explosive shottie lol.  You one shot everything.
---
Its guico.
---
I want this gun so bad. I loved that weapon in NV.
---
\&gt; He started by firing at me with an explosive Gauss rifle of some sort, I took no damage from it 
---
When you say no damage, is it almost no dmg like if he slapped you?
---
If it is it might be bug then, wanted to try some PvP with my TSE gauss so I got myself a bounty and server hopped. Right after loading screen a guy shoot me and suprise : slap damage is activated (even though I am wanted &amp; have a bounty). I take no damage so I slapped back and OHKO the poor pal, he kept coming back &amp; I kept one shotting him until he got mad and DCed.
---
I later server hopped and got eventually one shotted in the back by a melee dude.
---
Not the first time that bug happened to me.
---
I learned I need to hustle my ass down there when there's a nuke launch if I want a shot at the Queen loot in the morning.  Used to it taking 10 minutes+ and I could sorta dawdle down there after finishing up what I was doing.  Nowadays if you're not there in the first minute or two you're not getting the queen.  I literally watched some guy harvest chunks of life off her with each shot.  I don't mind not expending 1000's of rounds of ammunition but dang....
---
My first mothman encounter he had prewar money and a fire axe
---
Sometimes the devs should be trusted least of all. ;)
---
Responder vendors sell both small and large. Small is bleh though - do not recommend.
---
I doubt that. 
---
They have said that nothing in the Atomic Shop will be more than cosmetic. If secret doors aren't in the game, they shouldn't be in the Atomic Shop.
---
That‚Äôs been a thing since day one 
---
Yes it‚Äôs the top of the world we have so much trouble with. Haven‚Äôt seen a single scorched, it‚Äôs all big ass legendary bugs and deathclaws! Lol hopefully we‚Äôll be out of that area soon!
---
Oh nice then, I will check it out, thanks!
---
PVP 101: Stash your junk.
---
bloodied 2h with +1 str and something else. Maybe 40% more power attack
---
In that, we can agree :)  All the best man.
---
Find someone you don‚Äôt likes camp, and drop it there
---
I don‚Äôt know, it doesn‚Äôt happen with any other game, granted I only play two others. 
---
Lever action, Hunting Rifle and Guass
---
The White Night faction vs the Duper faction.  My money's on the dupers =P
---
Trumps an idiot though, but you know fake news could actually be fake news. No adult is going throw a childish tantrum, shut down the government and force the people to pay for a stupid wall right?
---
I am starting out some new alt characters and struggling while my primary characters are OP. You just reminded me to grab a guitar sword, there is a house to the right of vault 76 that they spawn at, it's unmarked, it's at the back by the fireplace, leaning against the house, I am going to grab them. I noticed when I was down at Camden, much high level enemies spawn even when I am a low level level 5, I was seeing 14 and 23 level enemies. Also remember if there is a high level in the area, it's going to spawn much higher level enemies, to wherever you go, make sure no one else is in the area.
---
I don't know Steve, but am considering the Overseer's CAMP on Saturday Morning with lot's of newbies in the area.
---
I play nice &amp; helpful most of the time, but do wear Raider Underarmor.
---
16 ftw! He's got one hand of iron and another of steel.  I rest my case. 
---
Thanks, and yeah like I mentioned there's a lot of traffic in the area. Lots of neighboring CAMPs popping up when I go into a server. It's like a 20 second run away from the golf club and a 10 second run from the watchtower. 
---
I‚Äôm all for a variety of play styles and diversity in the gaming community.  But outright harassment via unprovoked, unwanted PVP that is so unbalanced is not cool.  
---
The system is way better than in FO4, \***and**\* there are more interesting perks. 
---
Providing multiple means to accomplish the same goal is actually good game design, and they at least have done that right for a lot of situations. I have one point in lockpicks and zero in hacking, and I can still get through 70% of these kinds of puzzles. Once in a while there will be a  terminal-locked loot cage or something I can't get.
---
**N00b question incoming**
---
What's the point of drills? They do 1 damage, don't they? What does a bloodied swing speed drill do?
---
It is getting harder and harder to buy/sell if you are into that but I think that is also due to dupers hurting the economy but also due to waning playerbase.
---
If you want to be a wasteland trader you will have to use reddit/discord, it just doesn't work on an individual server basis.
---
Yes there are legendary Broadsiders (I have a 3* one) and yes it does work with the heavy weapon and explosive perks.
---
Cool. Was it limited edition or still available?
---
I've seen them at Whitesprings, Harper's Ferry and Watoga.
---
Yeah empty safes should be unlocked, total BS I waste bobby pins and get nada ..
---
I totally understand your frustration and I know it's tempting to move forward with the main quest as quickly as you can, but what I really recommend is exploring areas you've already been to, and fully clearing them out. Make sure you've slept in a bed for the +5% XP for 2 hours.
---
For example, when I first got to Charleston I was having a lot of trouble with Snallygasters and swarms of Super Mutants, so I went back to the Forest and explored all the locations I could find and cleared a bunch of them out. By the time that was done, I was ready for those Snallygasters. But then I was having trouble in the Ash Heap with Mole Miners, so I went to Grafton and did as many quests as I could find there. 
---
I really think Bethesda designs Fallout and Elder Scrolls games with the intention of you going "ooh, what's that?", getting distracted, and getting pulled into side quests and other random environmental storytelling. 
---
It's not as speedy as running straight to Whitesprings and farming ghouls, but exploring in this game, in my opinion, is really fun.
---
What platform are you on? I can give you a two shot explosive tattling gun
---
Do people purposely seek out this subreddit just to shit on this game? Y‚Äôall got too much time your hands. 
---
100% support this.  It'll put some hair o their chests.
---
Got 50 points sitting there in case. Sup?
---
On the cliff directly west of the Whitesprings golf course. Soon as you run past the broken down portion of the perimeter gate, you'll run into it.
---
I eventually figured out that waves of ghouls were going to keep appearing in that room with the robots, so I lined the doorways with frag mines.  It was pretty funny listening to the bots drone on about ticket numbers as ghoul chunks bounced off the ceiling and all over the counters.
---
There's a few spot like this around Morgantown and some other streams
---
For damage output you're set for life, nothing will really compare in terms of damage. 
---
But if you want a backup like you said I'd recommend the .45 Combat Rifle.
---
It did happen all the time but not since the latest patch for me. It's linked to when you move things around in your camp. Run off for a bit and fast travel back. That tends to fix it.
---
For reference, typically there is a level 60 radscorpion or multiple level 40 to 50 bugs.  When I was first there after a server reboot, there were 2 level 10 ticks.
---
The level specific dynamic spawning will drive many new players away.
---
Okay well you must be gay based on how you spelled grinder! Lmfao
---
Same thing happened to me, I submitted a ticket, haven't heard back yet tho.
---
Using the same password for everything is a big no no. I use Google chrome and have it generate passwords for me. From what I've heard is if they can you you will have an email saying you have been banned. 
---
I never had to do it on my main.
---
She‚Äôs a Beta character and one day while roaming the wastes during the beta the ‚Äúrecruitment blues‚Äù quest popped up,   Five minutes later it completed.
---
I was nowhere near the DMV.
---
I can access the top floor and everything.
---
Best glitch ever.
---
Hey you didn't say which platform, just a heads up. 
---
They way the screen jumps with recoil... would the off-hand weapon be affected by this or have it's own separate target reticle?  So as the RH weapon fires and jumps up, would the LH weapon get a separate reticle that stays on the original target line?  It would be a cool mechanic to have to alternate the firing to allow the opposite reticle to return to the target line.
---
Megasloths
---
Make them like legendary bots, with the exception that radius and magnitude of the boom is tied to stars.  Would make nuke farming at whitesprings way more festive.
---
Thank you for the tip! And keep it up!
---
You mean Manta Man?
---
I mean it has to be under, right?
---
Yeah, the games world is weird. I‚Äôm 100% sure you have to play for time to pass for your character.
---
If it smokes a great big cigar,
---
The end-game game play loop is bad - it is a lot like sifting through an enormous pile of trash to find a single $20 bill.
---
There are lot of games out that have created FUN loops for finding better gear, but sadly Bethesda didn't put anything meaningful into end-game.  If that doesn't change soon, the player base is going to erode extremely fast.
---
You would think so.  
---
That would be a safe bet.
---
Mind if I ask what kind of Hard drive you're using?
---
Beth games shit the bed on anything that isnt 9600rpmhdd or SDD.
---
Rip i have a few i got from the overseers chest
---
FYI - flux that you farm is under your ‚Äúaid‚Äù until you stabilize it.  So being killed wouldn‚Äôt cause you to lose it as you only drop your ‚Äújunk‚Äù.  As for the duping stuff and other obvious abuses Bethesda enables, it‚Äôs just sad.  I really hate seeing a game with so much potential get torn apart and misused by gaming trolls.  
---
Weird. I've always gotten a couple.
---
What makes you think private servers will be dupe free?
---
Morgantown is an option (lots of ghouls), Maybe the Prison. What happens to Supermutants in a nuked area ?
---
Just pick an area with lots of enemies or it is a waste, I agree. Whitesprings is getting boring ..
---
Yeah but not as much as the Tesla Cannon. 
---
Oh baby. 
---
Being a Heavy *and* a huge fan of energy weapons, that would be dope.
---
Honestly they should set them as passive unlocks at level 5, 10, and 15 of their respective SPECIAL trait. I think its strength for lockpicking (Not sure how that even makes sense) and intelligence for hacking. I think this makes the most sense as it the also helps give reason to specialize in certain traits and also removes the need to swap constantly. 
---
Where can I do it...
---
Thanks for the information brother, stay safe in the wastes!
---
Yea, but it's getting to be like a "Been There, Done That" sort of thing, I'm looking for something different.
---
Not even exaggerating I always get legendary wooden chest pieces ü•¥
---
yeah i‚Äôve seen this a lot too, i dont even bother going to the queen anymore but when someone nukes the prime site i get the event anyway and it‚Äôs over in less than two minutes
---
I'm super happy you enjoy it.  That's very cool.  I'm sure there is lots of good in the game, but there is lots of bad, lazy, greedy shit.  I know they are a business and they need to make money but I'm wondering how much money they lost because of their crap.  
---
I loved 4, had lots of fun for a few hundred hours. And if I didn't have 7 games on the go right now I'd probably be playing 76.  But there was a time when I would push everything to the side for a Bethesda game, not anymore. (My ps3 tag was Skyrim_Junky). My heart is broken.  Hopefully Doom Eternal will get me back on the wagon. 
---
It's funny but good advice on SBQ fights these days. You literally used to be able to take your time to get to the prime site and would have plenty of time before she was killed. Now you really need to get your ass down there right as the nukes hit just to get a shot in.
---
Probably someone on the same sever beat you to it. Happens a lot. As a rule of thumb  if there is no scrap and a few meat piles don't bother lock picking. It's already been looted.
---
That's an awesome camp my friend. If you get the fireplace from the atom shop it could be a good replacement for the static woodburning stove when you first enter, and the atom shop succulents would look great in the kitchen area on those trays
---
Wow, I've always been on the lookout for an actual buildable cave.
---
Keep these coming!
---
Anyone 150+ most likely has at least 20 points sitting around because we already have all the perks. I know me and my friends do. 
---
Probably a good idea to check your facts before you put something out there.  We were killed multiple times even with that buff.  Pacifist mode doesn‚Äôt stop them from keeping up the ‚Äúslap‚Äù damage until you die, especially if they have duped weapons and/or bobble heads.  
---
Don't know the purpose of just drills, but bloodied is an effect that increases weapon damage the less health you have, and swing speed will make it spin faster which means it'll do more DPS
---
I highly doubt ‚Äúmany people‚Äù have consistently experienced an issue with this. I have a LOT of hours in this game across a couple of characters and I‚Äôm surprised actually come across people let alone have them mess with me. If they do then so what? They can‚Äôt really do any lasting damage even if they‚Äôre uppity. 
---
It should say in the description if it has a code you can use to register the game via Bethesda's launcher
---
I‚Äôd like to add to your list. There is a random event spawn point outside of Harpers Ferry, under a bridge. This doesn‚Äôt seem to have a unique item chance (vendor bot, costume plans), but now I think I should check it out some more. Is there a list of random event spawns?   
---
-**Supermutants**: Boring caps and experience :(
---
-**Monster Fight**: Two opposing factions will spawn on either side of under the bridge and fight. Mirelurks, Deathclaws, Scorched everything, etc. 
---
-**Prizebot**: Please kill on sight. 
---
-**Exsanguinated Settler**: Dead settler, bloodbugs flying around the body. 
---
-**Free States Gutsy**: Cool unique dialog.
---
-**Pied Piper Handy**: This time they‚Äôre Rad Rats!
---
-**Dog Walking Handy**: Unlike Pied Piper, the dogs are hostile.
---
-**Morse Code Eyebot**: Says it‚Äôs investigating coordinates. Following him results in disappointment. Turns around and says it‚Äôs going to investigate coordinates. Following him results in disappointment.  
---
Firstly, you have two explosive weapons one being tse and a full set of at least 2 star armor all with the same perks. Mismatched or not I call bull shit. How many if those did you buy from someone else? You'll probably say none of which I can only repeat, bullshit yet again. 
---
Secondly, you say you swapped servers with a bounty on your head looking for other players? You can't see other players on the map while wanted anyway so I find your story flawed more than once. 
---
Finally, the set up you "acquired" is beyond broken whether you see it or not. And though you weren't hacking, your build is very unfair to the majority of players. I hope that gets addressed along with nerfing tse weapons. 
---
Who said I would be stuck in a basement playing Gallout (4 even).
---
Nope Im gonna be in the wasteland playing it for reals.
---
Huh, SJWs exist in Appalachia too
---
Based on the fact they wont stop shooting me smart arse!
---
I was on a server last night when someone nuked Morgantown, and it was a nice change of pace. There isn't the density of ghouls like you get at the gold course, but there's plenty in the area and they respawn fairly quick. There's also a ton of flora in the area.
---
They did implement this when using computers. I realize there is a difference between that and actively buying limited stuff„ÄÅbut they could just slap a "Sold out" icon next to something someone else buys.
---
This is painfully accurate.
---
Sorry let me rephrase. ‚óº‚óº‚óº‚óº‚óºis pain ‚óº‚óº‚óº‚óº‚óº‚óº
---
Yep
---
I have been searching for the t60 helmet to finish mine for over a week. Gl to both of us.
---
You can use the drill to get in to vault 96.
---
Stop calling it griefing. It‚Äôs part of the game. 
---
I'll keep checking for a reply here, because I'm currently set as offline, or shoot me an Xbox message.
---
Wellllllllllll, how does your LUCK stat look? When I kill 3‚òÜ Legendary Blah Blah Blahs, the more i attack them with different weapons and not one shot them the more often they will drop 3‚òÜ Weapons and Armor ect. 
---
You know that Luck effectively effects drops, drop rates, drop types, how much is in a loot pool, and what is in the loot pool. 
---
So many people cry and moan about bad drops but their SPECIAL looks like 15 Strength 15 Int and the rest is in AGI PER INT and CHR. With enough for 3 into luck for super duper... 
---
::rolls eyes::
---
Considering the launch of this game, I'd expect the next update to be released on the 1st of April :-)
---
I really enjoy this game and have really enjoyed all the fallout games. The only thing I don't understand is how they released the game in the state it was and still is in. This game should have been delayed for another year so some proper testing could be done. A lot of people are rightfully pissed because they paid $60 for a game that was just full of bugs, crashes and unstable server connections. This paired with ALL the exploits ruined the experience for many people and they have every right to be angry.
---
Banning the cheaters is great and I'm glad they are finally doing something, but it took them forever and the damage is done.
---
Like I said, I LOVE this game still and am sticking with it, but I play in a way that is very laid back and play just to explore and have fun with friends. If I were at all in a competitive type of mentality with this game (not sure how that would work, but a lot of people are of this mind set) I would have left this game a while back and demanded a refund. 
---
How do you remember 25 different passwords. Just curious. 
---
thanks you're right
---
Nothing, its rare so people love them.
---
There is a spawn in an upstairs room of the Ammo workshop that for me is 90% of the time T-60 and is usually one or two pieces short of a full set. 
---
Low cost studio using recycled assets of an established franchise with the insertion of a cash shop, probably seemed like a pay day too good to pass up. 
---
So many wasteland Nazis around here
---
Shame on the down-votes for this comment.  I love the game but it‚Äôs an undeniable fact that there are bugs and exploited that have an adverse impact on the game.  
---
Dude.  That's my point - it's a poorly designed system which allows players to engage in a form of PvP with other players who _explictly_ do not want to engage in.  
---
Hence, griefing.
---
Google will save the randomly generated one
---
They just need to introduce a card loadout feature.
---
A Modder has already created one.
---
Yeah, it's been happening to me for at least a month, on and off. 
---
Did you find any legendary enemies, most of the enemies were non legendary which I was ok with, I was mostly after hardened mass so also a nice change of pace for me. Also was right next to my camp so was convienant to run back and forth to drop off the hardened mass.
---
The same exact thing has happened to me just now. Waiting to see if there are any updates. 
---
It‚Äôs not supposed to be obtainable outside of the Monster Mash event in Watoga. You wear it during the event then afterwards it‚Äôs supposed to be gone. But somehow it glitches and lets you keep it.  That part I‚Äôm not sure how it happens but I found one laying on the ground in the Watoga station and it‚Äôs been mine ever since.
---
Yes I agree if it is a 3 star legendary mob it should only drop 2 and above gear. 1 stars should only have 1 star gear and 2 star should be 1 or 2 star gear!!!!!!! Plus I am really tired of the whole grind thing they need a new DLC ASAP. I am so....... bored of Whitespeings, Uranium Fever, Horde events, and West Tec build my eye are about to bleed!
---
Perfect, thanks
---
Second this.
---
Exploits for yourself, are one thing, crashing servers is another. Not a hard trail of bread crumbs to follow either.
---
teardrops in my eye
---
No it‚Äôs true I‚Äôm the same way I have all the perks I want right NOW at least and I assume most people are like us and just bank the rest. If they don‚Äôt though and have been getting all the random ones to try new things then they‚Äôd be in serious trouble.
---
Once you've picked up a good weapon and run the right perks nothing is really hard to kill atm.  The SBQ is definitely a resource and time sink if you don't have the right group,  it she still isn't hard.  Just time intensive.  Even in the pick up groups I've been in lately have been DPS intensive enough to kill her within 10mins.
---
Better than dropping nothing. Had this happen a few too many times.
---
I also totally agree, though.
---
I got 2 from a level 200 who dropped them and it seems the best thing to do is try sell one. 
---
Exactly the same. Launched a Nuke at Whitesprings and got 4 Blue Screens in about 15 minutes as well
---
The system is a bunch of fucking cards, like we are ten-year-olds collecting baseball cards at recess. 
---
FUCKING CARDS. You even get fucking GUM in your fucking PACK OF FUCKING CARDS. 
---
You have to swap your fucking cards to make decent turrets, or open a lock. Weapon crafting has to stay equipped to stop guns from wearing out quickly. 
---
Characters have no ‚Äúself‚Äù because you just swap your stupid fucking cards around instead of learning skills. 
---
A better system? It‚Äôs dumb. 
---
This is a long-solves problem in other games. Even fallout 1 to 3 had it right: You used to have attributes, perks and skills. Attributes would enhance your skills and gatekeep perks. Perks would change something about the game and have to be interesting. Skills would represent the boring part - how hard do you hit, or do you meet a lockpick cutoff. 
---
Thank you for the quick response! Wasnt expending a response at all tbh.
---
Psychopath perk card. #justsayin...
---
Hell, imagine the hurt if they had quest NPC"s that required dialog.  The forums would be swamped with hate for AFK folks locking the NPCs.
---
LMAO - thank you for that!
---
I‚Äôm also getting double loading screens since the patch. 
---
Sounds like the cover of a lost Beatles album.
---
Can you still sign into the Bethesda site? 
---
Higher level raider power armor in the big rig at crevasse dam.
---
Aside from it being glitched is that really why ? 
---
Raider (45) - Blackwater Mine
---
T-45 (45) - Firebase LT/Survey Camp Alpha
---
T-51b (50) - Camp Venture
---
T-60 (50) - Forward Station Delta
---
Those are the locations I've encountered PA sets. Parts vary based on RNG. I think you can find up to 3 pieces (+core) at a time.
---
Thank you for your comment.  I couldn‚Äôt agree more.  Blast zones are one of the events that are so hard to come by and partake in.  And to have these assclowns pull their crap in such an area or as the whole server is trying to take down the queen (that‚Äôs happened to me too) is just ridiculous.  I really wish there was some consequence for such crap. . Maybe some day.
---
Yep 
---
I would rather the PvP flag option. Waiting for somebody to engage ruins the sneak attack first attack. Just make it zero damage non pvp flag and full damage for flagged pvp'ers. Make the PvPers a different color on the map or better yet just give us our own server to choose
---
just a heads up in case it hasn't been mentioned, you can simply pack up your base and move it and everything get's restored.  Just costs the cost in caps to move it which is small if you replant your base in the same spot (I think it's like 40 caps) but even if you move to a distant location it's only maybe 100 something caps max.  
---
No need to "fix all" and consume some huge amount of mats.  
---
If you do go for the fix all option you can use the contractor perk to reduce the cost.
---
Show me proof of someone getting one shot in passive mode. Actual video of it happening. 
---
one theory I've seen proposed is that the perk card packs and the perk card system may have been designed with it being a microtransaction based system, but was dropped as there has been popular pushback against microtransaction monetization recently. Not saying that is or isn't the case, but it sorta makes sense as it is very much like a loot box with the rng element, and there are certain perks that if you could get them earlier, make the game easier.
---
Yeah you were working on it...in a basement of a sorts.
---
I have been to many DMVs in WV, but the Charleston one is pure hell.  It was like three hours to get a registration changed. I might get PTSD if I do this quest.
---
We should be able to scrap Legendary Items, recover the Mods, and use them on other Weapons utilizing 1 Prefix Modifier, 1 Major modifier, and up to 3 Minor Modifiers, this would add a whole new twist, and nullify Duped Items in one fix.
---
I plead said fifth.
---
It's a Lovecraft thing and they had the Dunwich Borers, Play on "Dunwich Horrors" in FO4.  I'm guessing they'd see it as too repetitive. 
---
Nope. Says the username and password does not match. Already changed the password
---
How is having all you passwords save on a google account different then having one password. Isn't that in essence having the same password for everything.
---
Not sure about the math, but "weightless" basically means it's very light and not literally 'weightless'. Also, weight will increase depending on the quality / number of mods.
---
I agree.  I have one from the event glitching but I never wear it.  I like my current outfit better.
---
I found a couple, but I was mainly hunting for flora and hardened mass as well, so I wasn't paying too much attention to what the other people in the area were killing.
---
My favorite is the ones that explode when you are in the act of killing you and just leave behind this sort of small indistinct flame effect -- which then explodes again 30 seconds later when you are trying to collect your paper bag right next to it.
---
The rad might be a display error. Try putting it on and check your pip boy and see if stats went up. The weightless effect applies to base armor before mods are added.
---
Yup, just did a complete tour of 96. A lot has happened since the first time I got in, looks like a 99% complete vault with mobs and everything. Can't be long for a release.
---
The terminal and elevator are still present :P
---

---
The experience the game was designed to offer is to have an anti team and struggle with objectives like in dark souls. It's a PVE + PVP game the issue is you're dumbing it down.
---
They grief because we're boring.
---
Just because your feelings are hurt doesn't mean he's wrong. Nobody's saying you can't express your opinions, but by the same token that doesn't mean someone can't tell you your opinion is fucking stupid.
---
There IS a Prime Frame mod, but it is extremely rare to find, and also costs INSANE materials to craft if you find plans (5 ultracite, 2 violet flux, 2 crimson flux, as well as other common materials). It increases damage, range, accuracy, and +25% damage to all scorch-enemies; at the cost of +50% recoil.
---
I did manage to come across a single mod for it, not plans, by killing a scorchbeast queen, however I lost them after scrapping all junk which brought a tear or two to my eye. I have no clue as of yet on how to obtain the plans, but the queen probably drops them as well.
---
The one shot may be, I did about get offed a few times from griefers rapidly stabbing me while in vendor though.  
---
I don't know why you'd want/need a keypad to leave a room.
---
Cause it would be very very uncomfortable inside?
---
I never got one, and I don't want one, it looks like shit lol

Since the January 15 patch, I am bluescreening almost 5 times an hour. The game is almost impossible to play at the moment.  I'm just hoping that these crashes from lazy, sub-par programmers doesn't cause another error between my motherboard and hard drive like ark did with it's constant crashes on my last ps4, which forced me to buy another one (last ps4 had to be reformated about once a week). Now I'm having as many if not more from a game that supposedly has "server stability".  I hope this gets resolved soon.

I live In SE. cliff side by the scout camp. I log in. Grab my sharp golf club. head up to scout camp to grab and cook some muttchops,  swing by the giant teapot for tea. Then head to Poseidon and power it up.  To Charleston station, Then swing over to Billings to set up Workshop. Then up to sunshine to set up that workshop. By then I get disconnected, so I go outside. Smoke a lil to chill back out. Go back, relog in , delete some dumb pictures I took, hit up atom shop and stare at screen for a while, then log in and head to flatwoods to drop off plans in the in needed overseer box, then do a vendor run.  Then I look for closest player and stalk them quietly, sniping enemies that get too close to them. Then I get disconnected again..
---
Was it the power armor station? I hate that one. Move it away from the wall a bit. That‚Äôs what always fixes it for me. 
---
For the greater good of the game, tough titties. No offence.
---
I have all 3 lockpick perk cards unlocked (but not equipped) for when I want to unlock a door but honestly if I find a locked box or a door I just skip it because I dont want to have to go in a equip them.
---
I even have the perk loadout manager and it's still not worth the effort of swapping it out...
---
I just can‚Äôt see that as being the justification. 
---
Duped for sure
---
I'm not claiming that the OP's claim is valid.  I'm saying that the implementation of PvP in this game needs a serious overhaul.  I'm hoping, based on the latest blog post from Bethesda, that we'll soon see PvP and non-PvP servers.  The slap damage system is not a good solution for \_anyone\_.  
---
It's pretty safe if you have all security protection on the account 
---
Just gonna keep naming random mainstream games to call this a clone of? Nothing like Destiny or CoD.
---
are you irradiated?
---
Top pic Brosef!
---
This game needs a ton of work. I have put it down until they fix it and add more worthwhile content. As of now endgame is mindlessly farming white springs.
---
Depends on if I have to pay for it.
---
Exactly why I created my post.  We were killing a lvl 91, glowing death claw and were attacked AND killed MULTIPLE times by two other players.  Unless that deathclaw was one of their kin, they were just being total dicks.  Getting killed once or twice in unwanted PVP I can see now and again but 4-5 times?!  That‚Äôs just rude and uncalled for.  
---
Maybe cause the calculations come from Super Duper triggers first, then Chemist kicks in.

Still available as far as I know.

" I don't think I've \*ever\* seen an alcoholic drink being sold in a plastic bottle " Go to any liquor store. Look at the cheap half gallons of vodka. Plastic. Same with a lot of pints as well. Back in my young and stupid days I used to steal the plastic half gallons as they'd not clank around or break if I had to run. Unless the laws in your area forbid alcohol in plastic the Kamchatka 1.75L bottles are plastic. Smirnoff also offers 1.75L plastic bottles.

Flatwoods

Thanks. Its changed decorative wise a bit now. Did get the succulents. Worth every atom. They make such a huge difference for aesthetics.
---
It just most likely originated from duping.
---
Sounds like your account was compromised. There is a different email they send you when you're banned, it's also standard practice to notify the registered email address when account info such as a password is updated to people can become informed and aware when their account is indeed compromised. I'd recommend changing your email password, because a common tactic when compromising an account is to try other accounts to see if they use the same info including email addresses (as they control access to any other account tied to it). If they compromise your email account you can have a much harder time getting your Bethesda account back presuming you are unable to retrieve that email address. 
---
That‚Äôs fair, I can get behind that. I just wish that this ‚Äúapex‚Äù also had legendary versions
---
Lol that was probably the the actual peephole area if I seemed below ground.
---
Bull. Shit.
---
Have you ever launched a nuke on Fissure Prime, only for a dick head stacking damage bobble heads and a TSE one shot the Queen, without getting a chance to tag it?
---
Have you read the other threads on reddit where people were getting one shotted in pvp from people stacking bobble heads and... oh what was the weapon used.... a TSE ?
---
It's typically not anti pvp, it's anti grief.  Virtually every time someone a tried to start a fight I had zero chance.
---
Harpers Ferry is an awesome nuke zone. They layout and enemy density is good, by far my favorite place to drop nukes.
---
You spent 10k on bobbleheads from a duper?
---
Yep, those and the fish bowl light are my favorite aesthetic purchases
---
I don't know, but that's pretty cool!
---
It's true. Cheating isn't the problem with this game. The game is the problem.
---
Weightless armor doesn‚Äôt factor in the mods. It‚Äôll only be like 90% of the base armor but that piece shown is reinforced so it‚Äôll ofc weigh more
---
Each picture will require 37 screws.
---
I thought you got a max level set of Raider PA for completing Rose's quest line.
---
This sounds right. You get double the original amount plus the extra from Chemist
---
There is no disc, I should know I preordered thinking I'd get a physical copy only to get a little piece of card stock with the download code off on it. It's not even a decent enough case to place on a shelf.
---
So some dude just mass hacked a bunch of account all at the same time?
---
I'd buy that. I'd also buy that they wanted a way for players to be able to change up their builds without having to start completely over 
---
Branding is Important, yes. But the Live Action Trailer for 76 *included* duel wielding of 10mm SMGs, so it's not like it's something they've not included in branding. And don't say "Oh but that's not gameplay", because branding isn't just Gameplay footage.
---
Red Dead Redemption 2,  Spiderman, God of War. All these games released with almost 0 bugs. Bethesda doesn't deserve a pass. They fucked up and if it happens again they'll die.

Someone's salty they don't have one I see

Now I want it even more.

She doesn't land as often if too many people are in the she'd. My new role in SBQ fights is to go in and yell at everyone in the shed that we could have killed her 5 minutes ago if they just got out of the shed so she would land and we could carry their lazy asses through the fight. 
---
Such a fun experience. 
---
Thanks! I've edited it now :) 
---
There‚Äôs a top comment now that explains it. It does make sense. 
---
Like the others said already - it most likely works, you just don't see it on the item description. Just check your stats when you put it on
---
It‚Äôs a Damage Over Time enchantment that makes all your damage cause a DOT.
---
+1 this 
---
If fan has batteries, what powers bulb?
---
Sounds like marsupial mutation with a TSE. Doable. 
---
Excellent idea.  
---
The way I think of it is like a suit of knight armor. Wouldn't really be able to fit in there if you're also wearing an EOD suit or kevlar and a sapi plate carrier. I know you've seen that raider torso haha that thing isn't fitting through a doorway much less inside power armor.
---
is there a mod for the handmade I don't know about?
---
Marsupial, Bird bones and a TSE gun it‚Äôs possible 
---
1. PC (Specs not super relevant to this bug)
---
2. USSVagrant
---
3. N/A
---
4. When my only team member crashed, the positive effects of my mutations disappeared, and I was only left with the negative effects. When my team member loaded back in, the positive effects of my mutations returned.
---
No its not, its in the game for weeks /months. Some items with the +25 rad effect are bugged/broken
---
I wish it was more granular. Like firing pin on your hunting rifle. Or magazine tube spring from your shotgun. Stuff like that. 
---
The Fallout 76 perk card system is significantly inferior to the Fallout 4 leveling system. There are two primary reasons for this.
---
The **first** is, as you said, switching perk cards is tedious and annoying. It makes the game less fun. It is very immersion-breaking to have to stop what you are doing, and go into a menu to switch to a Lock Picking perk card just because you found a safe, then have to switch back to your original perk cards after you picked it open. There is *zero benefit* to this system over just having the Lock Pick perk cards unlocked permanently with no card-switching necessary, as it worked in Fallout 4.
---
The **second** reason is much worse: The Fallout 76 leveling system is designed in such a way that players actually are prevented from enjoying a huge portion of the content in the game as they level up. I am talking about the vast variety of weapons. The game has a multitude of fun weapons to use, with tons of awesome mods for them. But the higher you get in level, the fewer weapons you are able to use effectively. Why? Because at high levels, enemies are very strong, and you can only kill them with weapons that are empowered by many supporting perk cards.
---
I am level 85+ now and I literally only have one weapon type that I can use against strong enemies successfully. This is highly disappointing because frankly, using a single weapon type (and really just one weapon which I found a good legendary modifier for) gets boring. I would much rather be able to unlock perk cards for all the weapon types simultaneously, as it worked in Fallout 4, so that when I pick up an awesome new weapon in the middle of combat off of a dead body, I can just grab it and start shooting and *actually kill something* with it.
---
**The FO76 perk card system is completely inferior to the FO4 leveling system.** The only slightly interesting, possibly cool thing that was added in the FO76 system is perk card sharing in groups. But that hardly makes up for the detriments stated above.
---
Because collecting more perk cards isn‚Äôt progressing? 
---
Yeah, but the proliferation of Chinese spies would have eventually been able to get the tech over to China. 
---
Haha yeah that‚Äôs fair!
---
Or remove the cap on specials and have every 5 levels give u a perk card pack and every ten gives you one more special point. The fact that to full upgrade a single weapon types perk cards takes 9 points in one category, and the cap is 15, is ridiculous. Especially with the sheer volume of cards that are for ridiculous things like lock picking, or the ability to use vats, or crafting. 
---
I know many people are tired of constant card swapping. If we could actually get an extra point every ten levels it would make leveling mean something again. 
---
If he really was level 12 how could he wield a TSE 
---
If they wipe removed all your equipment, weapons, armor etc but left all of your learnt plans, kept your same level and reset all of your points to redistribute them then I would keep playing.
---
Anything else then no :P
---
"accidentally"
---
Yeah bobble heads will let you 1-shot someone who's not flagged for PvP strait though the pacifist apparently.  Also the queen.  It's not necessary to 1-shot bloated in a nuke zone though.
---
Actually forgot to ask you, what armor are you using and which legendary effects are on it? I‚Äôm gonna try and chase armor like that or similar.
---
They are legit
---
No, even if you wipe all the duped items people will just make more. So what‚Äôs the point in punishing players like myself who don‚Äôt dupe when the duper‚Äôs will be right back where they were in a fraction of the time it will take us to reach a similar point. Bethesda can‚Äôt just ‚Äúfix duping‚Äù, it‚Äôs a fantasy. People will always find a way to dupe so long as it benefits them, hell, some dupe glitches will likely never go fully public and as such will never be patched.
---
I'm not sure if that's the case. I just successfully change my password and I didn't receive "You have updated your account" email from them. Also I'm reading bethesda forums and few people are also having the same problem. 
---
but then the rng component makes less sense, and the game released without the ability to respec, so in a sense you were stuck with a sort of build before anyway.
---
Yes x1000.  
---
Furthermore I‚Äôd play *a lot* more PvP and would be less picky about when I drop nukes (looking at severs where most people are lvl100+).
---
It's better than the arrow swirl of death I guess. 
---
You sound like someone who blames the drugs people abuse or even their dealers instead of encouraging the users to get the help they need.  Any time a person thinks it‚Äôs cool to overpower someone in a medium MULTIPLE times likely has inferiority issues or something.  After the 2nd or even 3rd time of pulling that crap, it‚Äôs bordering on bullying.  Regardless, it‚Äôs rude and is a detriment to any gaming community.  If you‚Äôd have any other way to remedy behavior aside from therapy, have at it.  
---
Yeah man I can come to you 
---
This would be true if Todd didn't announce that all major parts of Zenimax and Bethesda were involved and it was the "biggest undertaking they've ever done". You don't make a claim ilke that unless you're either lying (huehuehue Todd) or it really was an effort just to bring the game to this point. Which isn't saying much.
---
That‚Äôs fine. I agree that PvP is a mess. I usually like PvP in games but I don‚Äôt even bother in this one. I just hate seeing so many people jump on these misinformation chains and spread it around. So many people are convinced that people in passive mode are getting one shotted all over the place. This happens a lot with this game. People so easily believe things and then it just takes off. 
---
My brother just did it last night. At one point he said "well this isnt realistic at all! They haven't left for a coffee break even once yet." 
---
Then he heard the words "mandatory coffee break" and starting chuckling. I enjoyed hearing him groan throughout the experience.
---
You changed your comment.......... I feel so betrayed
---
It's not too uncommon, could be a single dude, could be a small group of people trying to sell stuff for real money. That was the main source of account compromises with World of Warcraft. Gold sellers would compromise accounts, strip an account clean, transfer money/items to be sold for cash at a later date. They usually get account info in file dumps when a place is breached. Sometimes the site that was breached would be a big name site (for example, Sony), sometimes it would be message boards or some community-run site. They then match up emails and passwords with specific games (it's even easier if say, a 76 community gets compromised and account info is revealed. Then they just try 76 accounts). 
---
I used to work in account administration with World of Warcraft. Our job was to address account disputes for suspensions, and we'd also take on projects to track down and address various methods of cheating or account sale/item sale. It's a big business compromising accounts for virtual goods. Sometimes these people would sit on account data for quite some time, we'd see accounts that hadn't been played in years suddenly become active due to this sort of stuff. I'm not saying that is what's happening here, but from what I'm reading it's pretty par for the course.

The weight reduction is to the base weight of the item. Any mods are not affected

"Patrol Duty" from the prison. Took me about 4 tries, as I got a few other plans first from that event. I was level 87 at the time.

Awesome diary!  And I love the perk cards.
---
Fun read!
---
Level 12 you say? I can only think of a bobblehead stacking bug that'd allow him to do that
---
There is a market for level 10 / 15 high quality weapons (not sure if TSEs come in those levels, but it could've also been a regular explosive shotgun).
---
The point is, this game is all kinds of crazy and 'hacker' shouldn't be the first thing that come to people's minds.  
---
What system?
---
I mean, technically sniper rifles ARE just modified hunting rifles. And for that matter, a lot of people (myself included) use the exact same hardware as a lot of militarys for hunting. A lot of the private sector stuff is higher quality than mil-spec.
---
I think I just got that plan. 
---
Maybe a mod. 
---
I too remember getting my driver‚Äôs license in a bank
---
I know I had gotten a level 5 legendary vampires golf club (lol)

You can snap walls flat against walls. It's a little fiddley but it is doable.

So u can craft the mod or u have the mod piece?

The weight is coming from the reinforced mod. The weight reduction does not affect mods, only the base item
---
They are waiting for prima guides to publish it X-D

It was but it didn't last long sadly.

Wow, so now we are calling game mechanics cheating and hacking? How bout a quick google search before posting crybaby bullshit
---
This makes me think of going to a store with a coupon for 50% off one item but the store always applies it to the lowest priced item.
---
They should at least specify the order of effect for these perks somewhere instead of just leaving us guessing and ticked about it.
---
I could care less about dupers. But at least on a private server, you can control who's in it to an extent (if invite only) 
---
Make sense ty.
---
That may constitute an issue, as automatics would dominate.
---
It‚Äôs much more realistic, but still.

Pick a 6 character seed. People often use a birthday or anniversary. Add a 2-3 character prefix to it based on the site you are at that includes an upper and lower case. Add a special character to it.

I believe Luck only affects the condition of that item, not item level/type/mods or legendary status/number of stars

I loved it more because I hated it. It's probably the best quest in any game ever.

Sweet! Please let me know!

&gt;	If they are able to ban people that got items out of the "dev room" then they can poll users items for anything
---
This isn‚Äôt really the best logic. These are two different things. I imagine it‚Äôs easier to find an object that nobody should have then finding am objecting many people have but some people have too many of. I get the frustration but I don‚Äôt understand why people like you, with no obvious knowledge about how these things work, feel like you know how to fix everything. 
---
I dont think many people have been banned at all and I imagine the majority of people that have TSE arent actually dupers but people who were given or traded them.
---
Hopefully the reason people stopped using TSE weapons at the white springs is because it is a dick move to do and they actually want to work with others. Was in a whitesprings nuke zone last night and there was a good groups of random people running around and it worked well. Keep it up, fellas!
---
Level 93 I think. About 300 hours played. 
---
I've gotten two explosive, but not two shot weapons. 
---
I have 11 in luck. 
---
I dont believe luck has anything to do with what you find. I've thrown away so so many legendaries. I usually get junkie or trouble shooter stuff. About 80 percent of my pick ups are armor vs weapons. 
---
Gaming technology moves in a L curve. The reason this game is as popular as it is is how much controversy it got and it's a fallout. In 2 years when this game is playable with no glitches games that are even more hyped and amazing will be out. This game will never be able to regain its mojo. Bethesda missed the ball. Fans of the game right now are playing, but this game will never be as popular again.
---
&gt;There are already a few threads proposing better mechanics and balance for perk cards so i'll stop here.
---
We don't need new mechanics or balance.
---
Every problem that people complain about the FO76 system is already fixed... in the FO4 leveling system.
---
The FO76 system is the result of the developers taking the FO4 system and fucking with it long enough to produce something unique, but not long enough to produce something better.
---
I personally wish they would just bring back the FO4 system. Maybe just add SPECIAL limits so that not every person can get their characters all to God-like status. And of course, balance the perk powers for multiplayer.
---
Nothing personal, but these posts discussing the hate and love etc. have gotten really obnoxious. At this point, it is what it is. Can this sub just be a place for people who play the game to discuss strategies, news etc?
---
I wasn‚Äôt crying it was a question, I don‚Äôt invest tonnes of time into this game to know everything about it. 
---
Yeah, any extra HP gained from perks or items/mutations/buffs only adds to your base HP (increased by END). Sometimes when loading into the world you may die cause that calculation is done only after you spawn. Make sure you never have less HP than your base total (unhealed).
---
Um, your ass is showing.  If you had actually read what I wrote, Mr. Simplicity, you would have seen that we didn‚Äôt instigate the PVP at all but were wiped multiple times.  If you‚Äôre going to be a troll, at least get your facts beforehand.  Otherwise, you just look really stupid.  Just a recommendation.  Peace out.  
---
There just needs to be a separate card set for utility vs. "combat" cards. So that you still need an appropriate level of Special for stuff but it isn't competing with things for killing stuff.
---
As it is it's dumb as hell that a melee with max strength can carry WAY less stuff than a character who only uses strength for weight reduction perks, just because the melee character has so many perks in strength to take. 
---
Thats the thing. Its out of my league if there are high level players near. Otherwise I can handle them. 
---
OP is complaining that nublets don't help with the SBQ fight, and just hide in the shed.  First comment responded further that nublets don't do \*anything\* to help, and incorrectly claimed there is "no risk."  
---
I pointed out that there is in fact, a great deal of risk to a nublet who can't take the SBQ, and provided several examples. These examples -- every single one -- are physically weaker than the SBQ. Therefore, it is basic logical reasoning that if you can handle the SBQ, you can handle weaker mobs.  That literally undermines the entire basic premise of the OP's complaint, which is that he couldn't handle the SBQ without help from nublets.   
---
So no, nothing about it proves anything remotely close to "he's right." If people who couldn't handle the adds weren't there at all guess what -- that means those people were not contributing in the first place towards killing the SBQ anyway. So if the OP wasn't able to kill the SBQ, that's his own fault, not the fault of nublets who weren't participating anyway.  
---
Use some basic fucking logic. It's not that difficult.
---
I would love this one!
---
God, it is painful to watch that protectron clop his way through the prison. Everytime he pauses, turns, thinks about it, then changes his mind and continues in the direction he was originally going, I want to scream at him.
---
I don't know if it was intentional but called then white knights is a little funny. The KKK refers to themselves as white knights and they think they're doing the right thing to protect people.
---
Who's the marketing wizard who came up with that one?!
---
Heck, if it weren't for the (essentially) infinite caps that dupers have, I'd be inclined to allow turning on pacifist mode while wanted, but it charges you your bounty - sort of a way to pay off your own bounty, without having to find someone to kill you. But if this were put in place now, those that have stacks and stacks of Nuka Cola could abuse it...
---
Each area of the game has certain level dependencies and suggestions. Following these will make your life much easier. You can‚Äôt blast through the main quest like the other games.

IDK man, you're getting mad at a system of cards like a 10-year old, seems like the system was designed with you in mind.
---
The armor itself is massive. The chassis it fits onto is relatively tiny.
---
Wow that‚Äôs actually...... really useful lol thank you so much
---
Thanks! This is exactly what I wanted to read to make sure I'm doing some good for newbies.
---
I play with my 9 year old and I've taken his lower level character to white springs with me a few times. So I guess it is possible that they had someone carry them a while and got a good drop. 
---
Mutation.  A very fun one.
---
So then they start carrying 99k then 10k then only five or six spread across a few characters. Then you make it harder to have alts to counter that. So they start getting multiple accounts because morons still actually pay dupers for items to cheat in a game where the whole point is earning said items. 
---
What have you accomplished? I bet at that point you haven‚Äôt accomplished much more than inconveniencing dupers and pissing off some legit players. 
---
Yeah mine glitched and disappeared. I never got a chance to use it 
---
Not to mention some very useful mods. Excavator is your best friend when it comes to carrying A LOT of stuff. Forget about not being able to fast travel cause you are carrying too much.
---
nicely done bud

No, we're not. We're talking about what "is." It literally says in the title of the thread "Sorry, it just \*is\*." It does not say "Sorry, it \*will be\*."

Maybe it inflicts additional damage to camp items?

Real fake doors?

thank you

Absolutely! The beginning of the game is a little tough to get traction so don‚Äôt get discouraged. But having this map has helped me not get overwhelmed.

---
*It's still sleeping down there... waiting.*
---
It's a dead issue - but do you remember there was lots of hate for retconning the BoS in before release?
---
With the full exp. i think it was shoe horned in, badly. A lot can happen in 25 years but i'm not really feeling how contacting WV over a satellite brought all the BoS gear here.
---
Quite simply - did BoS send a detachment to WV? I thought WV locals contacted them - so how did we get all their specialized gear and fashion? Maybe i wasn't reading lore closely enough but they did have that camp outside Grafton.
---
So within 25 years the Cali BoS - couldn't be more than 100 of them - went flying all over the Wasteland apparently in Vertibots a technology they didn't explicitly have that took them 3,417 km= 2,123 miles.
---
The other weird thing - they just gave away their tech? Usually they just contract the local militia but the Chosen One always has to prove himself to join their ranks.
---
Then the remnants holed up @ the asylum Fort Defiance and just dwindled out? Did our Scorched detection system even make a difference? Even if we nuke Fissure Prime does it actually stop the SB's, lore wise?
---
It would make more sense if the BoS just sent a party out to do something specific like nuking Prime. Starting a Chapter so far away from California just doesn't feel right because they're paranoid about giving away their tech usually.
---
Ultimately if the Brotherhood never showed up in WV would it have made a difference at all?
---
People don't think it does, but you never know. A good experiment would be two or three players. One with 1 luck and one with 15, and even 1 with 30+. Then do Whitespring nuke runs over and over and take note of every legendary. It's not something that would b e easy to do and it might all be pointless. I wonder if anyone has done something like that. I wonder if they would share the findings if they did put in all that work and found out it does give you more 3\* loot.
---
Just avoid two shot as they are wildly inaccurate in VATS.
---
Zero percent care. 
---
Really like most things in the game it depends on your character built. If you sink the proper perks to specialize in using heavy weapons then it works well because your weapons end up doing more damage, therefore you dont need to shoot as often/as long therefore your weapons last longer. Bear arms means you can carry a lot of weapons as well to have variety and backups. The proper gun smith cards, weapon artisan, ammosmith, super super etc all help you keep in working order and with ammo for using them.
---
The problem with that is a lvl 30 tse is still a 1 shot gun.
---
Very well done. 
---
I‚Äôve never seven seen anyone get killed through slap damage. Ive looked for videos of it and nothing. I‚Äôve been killed here or there in passive due to exploding vehicles and legendary robots (those bastards). I‚Äôm not even convinced people *can* be directly killed through slap damage. I think people are just buying into the latest mass hysteria and running with it. Like the supposed trade bug that nobody could ever confirm and was probably actually just user error compounded by clunky trade UI. 
---
I too am interested in that.
---
this happens a lot.  nothing rare about it, unfortunately.  it's BGS.
---
You're welcome, it's really no problem. Have fun trading using your headset!
---
Nah, definitely sounds like Queen to me
---
Completely agree and I love the response but just for future reference it is spelled as commensurate :) great word choice!
---
This is awesome. Will be my loading screen from now on. 
---
Sounds awesome!
---
Could be the paint job from the vault. I saw a streamer on Twitch who had a white winter paint on her PA. She said it was a gift from someone else (she gets a lot of gifts that are very questionable)
---
So let‚Äôs say I have less than 50 health and the rest of the health bar is irradiated, if I have Adrenal Reaction mutation(-50 max health), there‚Äôs a chance that when I FT or load into a world the Adrenal Reaction calculation would come first and kill me outright?
---
Lazy isn't exactly the right word to use here, more like effortless.
---
I am interested in what others have found post the latest console patch (XB1). 
---
I had an errant water filter listed as stored that was supposedly the problem and that I was finally able to scrap (along with a couple of other items that just 'appeared' post patch), however, my build budget is still maxed out.
---
I really, really do not have a big build. Just a basic two-story 6x2 grid, with basic furniture and crafting benches. There is no way I should be maxed out when I compare mine with other (cooler) builds posted in this forum.
---
Was the build budget nerfed to improve server stability?
---
Am I just Sh%t Out of Luck?
---
Inquiring minds wish to know
---
I make new spellings for words plus upper case and special characters pretty much guarantees that it won't be hacked without a key logger 
---
I said this elsewhere: The devs spent enough time on the perk card system to make something *new*, but not enough time to make it *better*.
---
Fusion cores silly.
---
I have relatively low luck and have revived a few 2-shot cryplators. I‚Äôm currently level 83. 
---
If you're on PS4, I can put it on your armor and give it back to you (using a glitch) if you want
---
The Blackbird paint that was offered in the shop looks like a skull when on the x01 helm. Maybe that's the one
---
To be fair, even Beth has made typos with the name. Some challenges weren't updating because they typed it "Yau Guai" until last patch.
---
That‚Äôs cool. Question about the pets. I know you need to have the perks to do it and all. But once you tame a pet does it just follow you everywhere?  Fast travel and all?  I‚Äôve heard mention of them hanging out at camps too. Just curious of the mechanics of it all as I might give it a shot.
---
I would have said the three month mark but May seems just as likely now.
---
Hey, we are about to do a silo run on our server if you want to join. 
---
It‚Äôs the blackbird PA paint that was available for like a day in the atom store
---
I have had this issue before on a smaller scale. From what I have found it has to do with corrupt data on your PS4. You could try restarting your PS4 in safe mode then selecting rebuild database. or just google how to fix ps4 corrupt data.
---
Maybe some upcoming DLC to restore the timeline and return the iconic sculpture to Boston in time for FO4.
---
Why don't we put all these perk cards to build stuff and unlock chests and computers to the gear side of the game. 
---
Like you can have a three different tiers of picklock. Three different kinds of Holotape to hack computers. 
---
Different Tiers of Workbenches for Amor, Weapons, etc (or upgradeable).
---
LIKE ALL THE OTHER GOD DAMN SURVIVAL GAMES HANDLE!!!
---
I hate Watoga. Too many robots 
---
What people really want is just the system from Fallout 4 where every new skill you unlock is always available. They are just afraid to say they want the Fallout 4 system because Fallout 4 was not received well by hardcore Fallout fans.
---
I thought there was only one in the asylum?
---
PC, but thanks for the offer. But is that against the terms and stuff? Also, it would just be nice to know it. 
---
That's the Carbon PA paint. Was a limited in Atom store.
---
Or if you have 50 HP left out of 100 HP, but you get 100 HP by buffing yourself with +50 HP from food and perks. Spawning removes that 50 HP from CURRENT (not TOTAL).
---
it's sad that in this giant echo chamber called r/fo76 you will never see the irony in what you're doing
---
How much less could you care about dupers?  Like, maybe now you care about them at 88% and you could go down to 75% or so?
---
Rad rat.  I hate those little bastards.
---
Pity... hope the paradigm shift that brought us on-line Fall Out eventually extends to more combat options and builds
---
It's the tower right next to  Hornright Estate, the one on the left on the map.
---
It was a glowing diseaded one, I had a hard time putting it down...
---
I really don't know about the spawn chance, it was my first time visiting the place.
---
looks like it is the blackbird paint. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4rfA4\_lo98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4rfA4_lo98) Thanks for the help Everyone!
---
Yeah I was getting shwacked by a high level when I was lower level after he destroyed my base.  To be honest I kept going back after him.  He did this to me and it blew my mind. Wasn't even mad about my base after. 
---
You know that we can't fill shelves, right? So a bookshelf door might not be *that* secret :P
---
There's a Creation Club one. There's also one just recently released from the F4NV team, looks amazing.
---
You‚Äôd think that wearing a hazmat suit underneath PA would stack...but it doesn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs stupid 
---
This has happened to me before--sometimes I think it's because I've already picked and looted it before and simply forgotten; but sometimes it happens in a place I'm positive I'm visiting for the first time (as in a place where I get the "You Discovered" message). I imagine (speculate) that the empty safes are problems with cool down times and that other players on the same server have already looted them; at other times, just a sync problem with the server.
---
Guaranteed to do more damage than laser weapons ammirite?!
---
Sure will that also help me out unlocking that achievement?
---
Yes. All the time.
---
Just being able to scrap legendary items would be amazing. But to scrap them and have a chance at pulling the mod off for future use, that would be epic!
---
Get a password manager. In this day and age it's a necessity.
---
Thanks. I did do this last week and everything was working well before this patch. Guess it doesn‚Äôt hurt to do it again. 
---
Chance to give extra not double
---
This is absolutely correct. Works the same with ammsmith. Super duper doubles the original amount, not the buffed amount 
---
There's also one in the Watoga High School, but I've seen screenshots of skeletons next to it near what appeared to be a cliff or rock.  
---
Dragon? Oh oops, I mean Scorchbeast.
---
Real guess: Assaultron.
---
They suck. Don't get me wrong. A hard 50% is the best I can do.
---
But if it's not for karma whoring, half of the posts on here are either about dupers or the white knights setting up search and seizures against potential dupers. 
---
Might be Bethesda's dev team.
---
Baseballs count!
---
Using a secure password manager (Google's offering in Chrome is one of many) means you are compromised if the secure password escrow you are using is compromised.  Google, LastPass et. al. have been really good about this stuff so far.
---
Having the same password for everything means that you are compromised when **any** of the random gaming, forum and porn sites you used it on are compromised.  These sites are run by idiots.
---
Not the same thing at all.
---
I think you're just describing downtown Boston in Fallout 4, but with less robots. 
---
rad-x kills mutations, which I refuse to play without, but otherwise seems like a lot of good changes!
---
Not gonna lie, wasn't intentional. But you're right. 
---
I got it from claiming workshops
---
Which is kind of frustrating when you think about the fact that the Brotherhood of Steel and Enclave originated from the West Coast and Obsidian still managed to bring new factions like the Legion to the table. Although I love me some Minutemen and Institute.
---
My luck is pretty high and I don‚Äôt find any but shitty golf clubs and trapper armor no matter what I kill. Have never seen any TS/E/TSE weapons and I‚Äôm level 69 *giggity* with all main quests done.
---
How would you fit that big ass helmet from the hazmat suit into a power armor helmet? :)
---
It should. We will invite you and you can activate your quest. But every time you do a nuke you should get the death from above completion. 
---
Actually saving in Chrome isn't that safe. Every company I've ever worked for would not let me save any important pw in Chrome. I'm in IT though. We let normal users save their website/email etc in Chrome. Anything else you are not allowed to save in your browser. Way to easy to be compromised. 
---
Everything else you said is absolutely on point though. If you really want to be safe using a password Vault is a better bet. And using random pw's while still saving in Chrome is definitely better then using the same repeatedly. So your not wromg, just saying it's still not the safest. Better definitely. 
---
Personally I like LastPass but here is what I'm talk about. You have to pay for these these though. Worth it if you do financial stuff or banking a lot. 
---
https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2407168,00.asp
---
Anyway this was just some extra info to add to what you said. Not trying to say you were wrong or anything. You gave good advice. 
---
If you don't want to respond to what I am discussing, then don't reply.  It seems you missed that very simple concept.  If you're still lost, let me refer you to the first thing I wrote, which is making a suggestion on how to improve this game mechanic.
---
I don't go in your threads where you show the world you are Basic AF by complaining about downvotes and respond with something people actually give a shit about, do I?  
---
If having the mental capacity to have basic coherence about what is currently at discussion makes me a fuccboi, I'll wear that badge with pride.
---
I feel sorry for your mother.
---
I'll grab it for a quick swap, even if the loot isn't amazing I still want access to all areas of the game, thanks!
---
Damn, so instead of having 50/50 health I would ended up with 0/100 right.
---
Extremely fast now without the Power User perk, no surprise.  They can‚Äôt get anything right.  
---
I dunno, there's a sort of thrilling Wild West feel to how every patch fixes some stuff but also might make it so my character can't run or wear pants.
---
This is bad advice.  Existing open source password crackers on consumer hardware will turn up passwords like those in a few hours or so.  Do not use dates.  Do not use variants.  Special characters do almost nothing.
---
If you don't want to use a proper password manager and randomized passwords, at least google "how to choose a password" for better rules to follow.  Or if nothing else at least read https://xkcd.com/936/
---
You know there was a patch right?
---
It's about blaming someone else for your shitty actions. 
---
DKS-501 Sniper Rifle baby. There's a mod for Fallout 4 that adds them back into the world and it's one of my top ten for that game.
---
PLEASE. I hate wasting ammo and stimpaks just to get an assultron head that weighs 30% less ugh 
---
Also weight reduction caps at 90% so no matter what it gave, it wouldn't reduce more than 90 
---
Hi guys, alongside the suggestions to play in windowed mode, I would add that disabling the V-Sync has definitely worked for me. Do that in the Nvidia 3D settings and simply completely disable the V-Sync.
---
Also, I have experienced a grand fps increase, after I have completely removed all the "fades" in game settings, e.g.: actor, foliage etc. - these are responsible for drawing distance of everything in the world, so disabling this will definitely increase your performance. 
---
And don't be afraid that it will make it harder to play... Drawing distance will still remain at a very generous level! Using V.A.T.S. will help detect enemies and scopes will still work for very long distances.
---
Hope this will help at least someone.
---
I think I need context? 
---
The separate levels are done because you have to be a certain level before you can use the next rank 
---
Diluted radx does not though
---
That still happens to me on Xbox, so if it was supposed to fix that, they failed.
---
Well found all my T-51b pieces at Forward Station Delta, but I do not like farming that, basically always spawn into a Scorchbeast, loading took so long this time I spawned almost dead
---
Robots can be made friendly with a quest there from what I remember. Power armor parkour!
---
Thanks for dropping by! If you need anything else, I may or may not have it. Let me know
---
Real fake doors!
---
Finally, I was wondering how I could eat players when I never got a prompt after they die in front of me. Just need to do it while they're bleeding out. 
---
Basically it would do the same thing it does now slightly better.....which is tickle enemies.
---
All that still happens to me, including rubber banding. They fixed nothing.
---
Ugh beat me too it
---
you can only take so much radiation damage before you just fall over dead
---
Workshops, also seen them on a few vendors it is just random. 
---
What platform are you on. I may have spares. I've gotten it like 4 times from claiming workshops. 
---
Awesome, thank you I appreciate it. :)
---
I don't recall, but I'm on XB1
---
PC...IGN same as on here. you?
---
When doing this, make the 3 star legendary have at least 3x the hp, same goes for other star amounts 
---
What platform? I‚Äôve got one I could just give to ya, xb1 here.
---
Wooot! It took 32 rounds from my Level 40 hardened sniper rifle, and I lost 20% of the rifle's condition in the process, and it took 20 minutes to do it...but I killed a Legendary Frenzied Irradiated Diseased Gulper!
---
loot-loot-loot...and...three bent tin cans, 2 caps, and a level 5 10mm pistol at 5% condition? Really?
---
How about have then at least guarantee a dam legendary drop.  Despite supposedly being patched a while ago I'm still getting 3 stars and other legendaries who drop no legendary at all.
---
And yes I go back and double check the body due to slow load in times of the legendary item sometimes.
---
cause you got them for free and have 2? lol just trying to help you make some caps is all
---
Looks like I'll be farming workshops tonight haha.
---
Other than the SB spawn, do any other spawns make it into the cave?
---
Thanks. Do you remember which vendors? I know certain vendors only have certain loot tables....
---
He's thinking of Distant Thunder, which does award Power Armor Plans most of the time when completed.
---
Late game lp and hacking are irrelevant 
---
ive got 3\* that i want to get rid of on X1. Not sure about the double-dip
---
The Pleasant Valley cabins east of Top of the World / North of Ski Resort has a Raider Power Armor, sitting in the center of a raider arena.  Every time I see it it is level 45 Power Armor pieces.
---
It's a pretty nasty area at times if Mole Miner mobs start spawning... just a warning.
---
(Lots of potential good stuff in the Cabins area too.  Stalls filled with Plans)
---
Seems those deserted camps are your best locations. Maybe PA on the roof of Watoga Emergency Centre worth checking out as well.
---
Jet packs drain the living daylights out of them lol. I'm managing the change OK. Mostly because I play a TON.  I feel bad for the casual players. 
---
ahhhh PC here. Thanks for the offer though.
---
No more than 80% of main health? 
---
Big city DLC!
---
Ha, I just moved from that location! That looks awesome! 
---
I have 15 Luck and didn't notice loot getting any better as it increased.  I'd say 1 in 20 legendaries is decent and even those don't fit my build most of the time.  It may increase spawns of Legendary enemies (just a blind guess, no proof of that) but I don't think it noticeably improves drops.
---
Will do man, thanks!
---
Feelsbad im on ps4
---
Cool idea
---
Not quite witch hunting but close enough, and a bunch of people have posted about sending proof of dupers to Bethesda only for them to say "just block them" and take no further action. 
---
I would buy clean concrete walls. 
---
I'm thinking that people were just used to them resetting to 100% all the time :)
---
I am currently 150+ with 8 luck.
---
So far I have found one TSE, around 5 TS, and around 3-4 explosives.
---
Coal tar is needed for dyes, soaps, and medical products, and petroleum would still be needed to make plastics. 
---
Un-play-able!
---
I mean, bug abusers literally destroyed any hope at me truly enjoying this game. The trading scene is literally dead, it doesn‚Äôt even exist anymore just a big dupe trade, everything is trivial easy because there‚Äôs lots of people with little to no play time with the best guns in the game because people duped hundreds of thousands of them, and now people have such little content to do with their OP stuff that there should be 99% less of, that they just grief instead. Let‚Äôs be honest, if we didn‚Äôt see the dupe exploit get abused as hard as it did, we wouldn‚Äôt see every single player practically with various TSE weapons, and people would be spending time farming rather then grieving. For me, it all comes down to the dupers, and their lack of care for anything who wishes to legitimately enjoy this game without cheating or being cheated by their illegitimately acquired items. We saw borderlands‚Äôs trade market die in a very similar way, in fact borderlands had it worse though since you could modify guns directly with an editor. Bug abusers think they are just changing the game for themselves when in fact they have impacted the entire game, as well as have done considerable damage beyond what was already done to an already struggling game. 
---
And ghouls and mutants are folding you while you are various terminals
---
Lol... I know it's a petty detail, but I love my aesthetics. 
---
Maybe you should stop worrying about giant echo chambers and learn the definitions of words such as argument and irony.
---
Oh trust me I already pored over the pages shown online. That's actually why I want the book now. The Sugar Bombed Carrots, Greasy Prospector Pork n Beans, and Saddle Up Salisbury Steak all looked so good
---
Something like this could happen. FO76 seems to have a level system that is pretty close to Elder Scrolls Online, and ESO's champion point system looks like it is not too far removed from the paragon system.
---
Honestly, I wouldn't care if it insta gibbed anyone who was under level 50 in a nuke zone.  Like the entire time it was nuked.  
---
It would be nice if underarmor at least worked in PA.
---
Character is frozen and controls do not respond after fast traveling or loading into game. This has happened often since update.
---
PS4 Pro. PSN: rehabchicago 
---
Unfortunate, however I do see the plans for sale from time to time at harpers ferry if that‚Äôs any consolation. 
---
Should be an easy fix and people have been talking about it since Beta.
---
I always play in first person so never even notice.
---
I hope it's not from PVP, but from faction rewards for doing BoS based quests like Forbidden Knowledge, Line in Sand, Distant Thunder etc.
---
This is likely the answer. It's probably just a bit of server lag. 
---
Why do people try to persist when it's clear they made a bad comparison?  Like, every time. No one cares about being correct now, always has to be that they were always correct. No change ever needed.
---
You can choose an attribute, then toggle to take a cards from another category. No need to invest in the wrong attributes. 
---
I have the same issue.  Was playing the game just fine.  Log out of the game and launcher.  Run my errands, came back and can‚Äôt login.  Saying my username or password is incorrect.  Tried changing it but the website page saying something went wrong and got the same email as the OP.  I think my shit hot hacked.  Cause no reason for me to get ban cause I haven‚Äôt done anything.  
---
Its so nice! It was hard to get to though since I'm only level 21, but any problem can be solve if you run fast enough.
---
I'm sitting her laughing at the tight of someone just walking into a nuke and *poof* dead, like some of the scorched I've come across that just seem to commit harikiri
---
I got a two shot pipe pistol 
---
I'm a bit of a wasteland photographer. That's when I want it most. 
---
Bandolier perk for the win
---
You don't have to select a perk card for the skill you level up. If you hit the bumpers (L1 or R1) you can switch the skill you take the perk card for while upgrading the other. So for example you can upgrade STR by 1 and take an endurance card
---
Ah, darn sorry, GL hunting
---
This bullshit quest didn't work when I played it, it would call your number and you'd go up and the bots would do LITERALLY NOTHING. "Wait for your number" I played it a lonnnng time ago in the BETA though. Is that how it is supposed to go?
---
Yeah the perk doesn't need to be shared if the person with the card can just unlock everything for everybody. 
---
Yep, new change in the latest patch, it's fucking great!
---
I'll be nowhere near the enemies and their nukezone levels of Area of Effect hit me constantly and I have nonstop diseases, A+.
---
And I thought my traditional Farmhouse with relaxing atrium was cool.  No sir.  You win.
---
Ooooh! Yep, right, Garran or something, gotcha
---
So they can pop in all the towers, good to know

I really don't feel that single handing weapons is part of the brand identity. Wearing a boxing glove on each hand instead of only one doesn't really make it "avant garde" either. 99.9% of people would not equip two machetes and go "I'm confused, what game am I playing, this isn't fallout!"
---
No, just left a team where one teammate was invisible, name still showing, and then other was completely invisible name and all. Never had a players name not even show up in that situation before this patch.
---
Is Bethesda watching reddit I mean they must be right?  I feel like it‚Äôs a good place to see what people really think of a game.
---
Jesus. You guys are literally jesus fucking christ. Thank you!
---
You're welcome to use two perk cards - one doubles the capacity, the other removes penalty cost (extra drain) for sprinting
---
Did you loot that container recently (as in last time you played)? It doesn't matter how much time passes in real time. If you looted it recently "in game time" it'll show as empty. The game like remembers the last 50 or so (random number, not exactly sure how many) containers you looted and they'll stay empty until they get knocked off the "recent" list.
---
Meanwhile locked/unlocked status is tracked by server. So if you unlock something, loot it, change server, it'll probably be locked but still empty.
---
anyone selling a marsupial serum recipe on ps4?
---
Early? It's coming up on 12 years since I ordered those bastards at Game!
---
Hmm i think console players can skip step one as ps4 has ways to record and take pics and im pretty sure Xbox1 can as well.
---
Step 6 and 7 might be a bit tricky with getting them to admit they duped if this catches on and the other being they'll be able to out those who don't buy as hey avoid of username1 or whatever as he reported me.
---
otherwise i don't see any real flaws here here's hoping this gets traction. Also your english was good dude no problems.
---
Cool. I'll keep an eye on that vendor when I log in each time. Cheers!
---
It is, level locked containers can have plans in them which is basically the only end-game activity there is (gather plans).
---
I would even settle for versions of shelves and tables that have presets of items in them.
---
That's the price of not actually incorporating it into your build.lockipicking and hacking arnt rewarding anyways
---
If you repair an automatic melee past 100 they do a ton more damage 
---
I really wish this game weren't multiplatform sometimes...
---
I would upvote this a million times if I could. I will waste all my ammo clearing out some mine or something and then as soon as I am about to grab what I came for, I will dc and have to kill them all over again just to get the item.
---
Dupers aside, I still find enjoyment in the game (bugs and all).
---
Regarding the trade market, it was already a shell of what it could be. Vendor cap limits and restrictions (not trading for -cap difference elike FO4) made trading garbage. Having numerous worthless items (no ammo? That legendary you have is also worthless) makes trading a chore.
---
I understand BGS wanted some softcore survival but the game was rushed and it's a polished turd right now. So much needed to be smoothed out.
---
Jeez, if BGS had a thriving trade economy from the get go, had weapons go beyond level 50 and enemies were not bullet sponges then you'd see less duping I'd imagine. 
---
So by the looks of all these titles and posts it looks like only pc players got in to the dev room to take these items. I‚Äôm curious to ask but did anyone on the console side somehow get in? 
---
yep, picking the stat is one part of the level up, and picking the perk is a 2nd part.   They are unrelated.  By default you are presented with the option to pick a perk from the stat you just increased but you can flip through all available cards at your current level.  
---
The main thing to be aware of is most cards require a specific level before you can choose them, so you may have to pick some perks in the early levels that don't really fit with your final build.  Not a big deal in the end as you eventually will have all the perks you could want and more if you gain enough levels.
---
How?  The last time I was attacked I one shot the guy. Whatever i don't care, I'm going back to playing.  I keep talking to you people I'm going to start blowing up others camps myself lol.   
---
It really says a lot about the company when people cheer the fact that they are doing the bare minimum.
---
Banning cheaters is expected, not something to be pat on the back for.
---
Good to know!!
---
Any PC player willing to sell a marsupial serum let me know
---
One of the two. 
---
Not currently logged on. Will get back to you. 
---
dead imgur meme
---
And how much will Bethesda pay me to work for them doing the work they should be doing? All of that could take hours of my time.
---
I think Beth should get some intern to track them down and ban their accounts
---
Yeah I found a Silenced Scoped Auto Shotgun at Camp Defiance, slugs would be usefull.
---
Do you need rank 3 adamantium skeleton to stop being staggered?
---
Enough plinks will eventually get the job done. Alternatively, they can also fire as fast as you can pull the trigger.
---
I crashed 4 times the other night in the span of 5 minutes in a nuke zone. I switched to a different game after that. 
---
 They do not care, they just want to sell expensive items in the atom store so you can spend your money 
---
I have a vampire super sledge with faster swing speed. I tank enemies like they are nothing. People are often shocked at how I tank entire nuke zone areas and my health bar doesn't even move.  
---
Not saying your wrong though, but rather, its dependent on the weapon. Faster speed knives or one handed weapons for instance, will not be as good as a sledge with vampire that can dish out its damage all at once. Reason being is that the smaller weapons will take way more hits to kill something meaning more time fighting the same enemy=more damage taken= worse performance with vampire weapons where the vampire weapon is just healing the damage you just took from that same enemy. Vs Sledgehammer 2 hit kills and both of those hits just gave you back HP. I can often 2 hit kill an enemy and regain health before they can even hit me with my sledgehammer, thus i'm regaining that health from the prior fight.  
---
So in other words, vampire weapons are outstanding on weapons like the grognak axe, sledgehammer, and super sledge and they are complete garbage on the smaller one handed weapons depending on the weapon. Vampire is also good with brute force unarmed weapons like the death claw gauntlet and power fist.  
---
Of course to take advantage of this you will want to make sure you have a two hander with swing speed or you are using the melee swing speed skill card. my sledge with the 40% swing speed bonus and the 60% faster attack speed skill card swings almost as fast as a base one handed sword.  
---
Someone could explain better that knows the exact formula for the hp it gives back but If I was to guess though I would say the amount of hp that you get back is based on how much damage you dish out. Meaning a higher damage weapon will give a higher hp life-steal on hit. I have no tested analysis of that though and this last paragraph is just theory.
---
They seem to watch this subreddit. Mostly cause this subreddit kisses their ass the heaviest. The fallout subreddit is more critical of the game is ignored constantly.
---
Who woulda thought that directly profiting from someone else's work might be a bridge too far. 
---
Dont drop it, face punishment for your misdeeds. 
---
Mayor for a day
---
(Lasts longer than a day ;) )
---
They did the same thing as Bioware did when they gave Andromeda to a small studio thay only  had experience with DLCs.
---
I guess you CAN'T teach an old dog new tricks if they are doing the same thing that essentially killed a beloved franchise not too long ago.
---
I want to say the raiders up at top of the world. specifically the one in the lodge. 
---
Sorry we're not FO4 BOS hahaha
---
Dude i wish this game was single player client side so that we wouldn't have to rely on piss poor servers and bethesda's multiplayer patch job. Fallout 4 didn't crash on me this often.
---
I posted this too for the PC patch. It looks to me like the Power User perk is doing nothing now. It has nothing to do with the server hop fusion core reset bug. I am noticing it diminish significantly faster while playing than before. 
---
I think this is more that lil big where mobs don't move or react to you.
---
While the top comment might have a feasible explanation I think we all know it's just a use of Fallout 4 assets that was overlooked.
---
Noticed the same. I'm a vats player and vats seems to really destroy power cores now. Definitely wasn't the case before, and no, it's not just the no longer resetting to 100% on logoff.  In the past I would on average use 2-3 powercores on a play session. Now I'm burning up 5-6.  Seriously considering changing my build away from vats if it persists.
---
Because of some of the toxic players out there I've had this issue too. I just keep trying and if they're not interested and don't respond to my messages I had take it elsewhere. I'm not going to let their mistrust because of some other douchebag break my good intentions. LOL

I don't remember what percentage of your health is actually at but I think it's about that 
---
Coseri‚Äôs episode with WSAZ‚Äôs Tim Irr makes me laugh every time.
---
They can't sell Skyrim anymore until a new console comes out, so they had to make a quick buck somehow.
---
Its too much, but 95% is a bit of an exaggeration. Off the top of my head: construction equipment, fire trucks, bicycles, Excavator Armor, miner's lamps, and the ubiquitous Bi-Planes. NPCs, Liberator robots, Mole Miners, Scortched, Scorchbeasts. Weapons, 10 mm SMG, Mole Miner's Gauntlet.
---
Us cool chicks exist out there!! Watch out for us we‚Äôre also tough as fuck in the wasteland!!
---
Not too sure what you're getting at.  That's the game though, right?  It's always been a back and forth with these things.  If you simply don't do anything, is that better? 
---
Honest question because you mention pissing off legit players.  Not doing anything can also piss off legit players.  So what other factors are there?
---
*‚ÄùHA... HAHA.... HAHAHAHAHA*
---
Out of combat means the health regen mutation kicks in and fills my health bar quickly. At this point,   I only need to worry about my health in combat.
---
Company releases buggy game, therefore it's okay to hack and cheat your way into test cells to get unreleased items?
---
You on xbox? Might have been mine lol. Like others have said, I usually abandon mine but make it accessible before logging off. If I see someone nearby I'll let them know it's up for grabs. And at the FC generators, I'll leave it unlocked while playing with a "Free!" sign pointing at it. 
---
At the end of the day you've killed them anyway.
---
They recycled fallout 4 assets. I‚Äôm shocked. Shocked I tell you. 
---
Are you still offering the White Powder and Whitespring Jumpsuits? I have a few Rare ones I can trade: Leather Coat, Traveling Leather Coat, Western Outfit or Caps. GT: Modow
---
I've logged on to just vendor a few times in a row. I cleared out some of my stash. I wanted the caps for the mutation serums. 
---
Doesn't it say under the effects tab in the pipboy? 
---
I get..np..a lot of topics on the game are endless echoes of things already covered to death. My buddy had told me of a nasty comment he got, we laughed but I guess it still bugged me, was on my mind and I wrote the post. 
---
People have been using the creation engine for over a decade.
---
People who aren't even professional developers have YEARS of experience with the creation engine.
---
Simple modders that do it as a hobby.
---
If they are Bethesda developers and never touched the creation engine, essentially the only engine the company has for their flagship games, before then they should be embarassed.
---
I like this. I would prefer they add it in as more discoverable plans since it's slightly less cosmetic than other options.
---
Additionally, I want more wall options. Greenhouse, log cabin, etc. They have them in the assets. I want them for camp. Also, I want shutter windows for ALL wall types. I love them on the wood walls, but the wood walls look so trashy. Give me shutters on say, log cabin walls, and I'd be happy.

Do you have any source?
---
Glad you at least use Raider PA.  So tired of running into "raiders" in game who don't wear the Raider PA because it stops at level 45 or has slightly lower DR or whatever.  I thought the whole point of raiding was to not care about that.
---
What is the problem you're referring to, exactly? Having test cells in video games?
---
OK, so at least I'm not crazy in this particular instance.  I'll take a look at your thread too.
---
If only you were on pc... 
---
This might seem stupid but i miss those days. Not stability issues but getting hunted by enemies i can not just crush. I hope you find balance in leveling up. I am considering starting an alt since my 240 heavy gunner gets old sometimes.
---
Anyways sorry to hear it is too hard. I had that at times but it was (mainly) fun, it never broke a session. Maybe I was lucky or you are just unlucky.
---
Do you really want a private server just to play solo?  ..with a friend or two joining your world from time to time? World would feel extremely empty and grinding would be just as pointless as duping since you will be able to easily alter your savegame file in a private server. With no story what's the point in grinding a TSE weapon for months just for braging rights in a private server that your friend can just edit some files to have it too.
---
How many mmos have infinite bank space? 
---
No, the Brotherhood never tried to commit genocide on the entire wasteland. Though I guess technically that hasn't happened for 200 years.  Haven't gotten to the Enclave section in this game just yet though. Maybe they are shining examples of virtue. 
---
I have a few I like but this one stands out among the rest.
---
Lasers are gr8 because they can be spammed to a small extent
---
Lasers are ass because they have less damage than fucking pistols and break quicker than a horse in BoTW
---
Lol..understand..the post grew larger then I had originally intended. 
---
If there were any indication people got banned in that scenario I might report some people.
---
I've been one-shot before. I even added him to my friends list so we could chat. I might see if we can get a video up, but as I recall he has all of the damage perks for explosions and rifles, with an explosive black powder rifle or something. Even if most PvPers can't one-shot, the fact that it's even possible is appalling.
---
yeah then i can be the stealth archer like in skyrim haha. hoping it's not trash like the crossbow
---
&gt; This combat armor leg does not add any radiation resistance stat increase when it's equipped, nor show any radiation resistance on it's stats.
---
I sell dozens of serums a day on xbox. Some people occasionally buy unstable but isn't a super popular mutation because it doesnt really do anything. The only people I've sold that one too are serious players trying to min/max. 
---
Gonna go with the snallyghaster
---
TSE Flare Gun please.
---
I hope you maintain your running speed. lol When I was building, it wasn't so bad. But after a few visits back to my camp, I was getting hammered every single visit. I had copious amounts of damage from being attacked by Super Mutants, Sloths, Stingwings, Liberator Mk IVs, Miralurk king, and Sorched - all very high level. Maybe that was the case because I was a lvl 100, dunno but got tired of repairing so I packed up my crap and ran! 
---
Lol dunno how I did it be it looked kinda funny coming out ü§£ü§£
---
You can get in to Vault 96 with a drill.
---
But it still sounds like your not really playing if all you have is 15 minutes every 3-4 days,
---
There is a PC mod for fo4 called War of the Commonwealth. Id love to see a blast zone have that kind of spawn rate.
---
I think it's more a nod to how 50% of people cry about this game like children ;)
---
Or a nod to how they've "finally fixed duping" even though it took them three tries and apparently there's still a dupe method.
---
I can imagine some device sitting there dusting his hands smiling and saying "pft. Child play" as he released the update.
---
Exploding Combat Rifle because it's my only good drop so i have nothing else to love.
---
Every time I do something, I stop and check my cards.
---
It's not the swapping that sucks, its the inability to save 'decks' and bind them somehow. If nothing else, having a 'Im playing solo" and "Im in a group" sets would help.
---
This is great. Also i believe that high level players in the area will raise the monster levels or atleast that has been the word on reddit for a long time. Maybe avoid low level areas around classic farming areas for crafting material where you will see high level players on the map.
---
I was in there with a TSE shotgunner last night.  He'd let people tag the 3*, but when he finished the legendary off, it was hard finding the giblets with the loot!
---
I don't remember which but one of the patches said it would make cores drain a little quicker 
---
I think it's best to avoid those damaging mutations, because one time someone was getting hit by slap damage and it procced and they got flagged for pvp and killed. I don't know if it always works that way or what but I seen a video of it happening so I avoid those mutations and PA torso mods. Though one person said the PA torso mod killed the person when it deflected the damage back at them, so that sounded pretty cool, but maybe that depends on the items and build of the attacker. But if you don't want to unintentionally pvp, maybe some testing required or just avoid stuff that does that kind of thing.
---
God those things are terrifying. Those pustules on their backs that sometimes leave holes? So gross. 
---
More I read up on taming you‚Äôre probably right as it sounds like you can only send them to your camp?
---
ZeinV2 how much you sellin them for on Xbox?
---
AND MY AXE! ... oops, wrong thread.
---
So, this might be incidental, and folks will probably be mad at me. But I was looking to buy a pipe rifle off ebay because I wanted to try a pipe God build and couldn't seem to get anyone to trade me one in any of the trade channels (yes, my time is worth money, shoot me). The seller was willing to split up his auction and only sell me one weapon (this was a typical buy all this shit and become a God listing). However shortly after we were talking his listing was suddenly canceled and he ceased communication. Sounds like possible ban material to me.
---
Very good, I actually tried a power fist and death claw gauntlet with anti armor on it to try to save a skill card... I ended up switching back to vampire. You really miss that health regen when its gone, especially considering the whole point of melee is to tank things while other players pick them off with guns. Def worth it.
---
I see the sloths hanging from trees in the background, but other than that if I ignore the mutants there aren't any issues. Its just that there is the worst place to put tires and a copper vein in the whole game in the bottom corner of the dam thing. You can see a wall missing and the tires if you zoom in, and of course i cant place a floor there so it ruins the whole thing
---
I have a vampire radium rifle with increased shot speed......I can tank quite nicely with it... Though it does shit damage
---
Chill out man, if you don't enjoy the game take a break and come back in a few months, the game will be more polished by then. You wont be missing out anything anyway.
---
Oooh, even better... turn them into those husks of green stuff and ash you see all over the place =P

I want a TSE drill...

Instigating lever action love it when I sneak and do √ó3.8 damage plus the x2 from instigating

Oh, I thought you were talking about how the bullets often end up going about a half inch to the left of the cross hair. 
---
Yeah, i think the joke is just too old, and people are sick of duping. So the combination of it not being very funny and probably people probably seeing "dupe" and just downvoting, regardless of whether they realized it was a joke or not. Oh well. 
---

I totally forgot about that .... I think I'll start tuning in after I do my rounds
---
You weren't working when the Martin's Fury thing happened by any chance were you? I was in the guild that used it. I'd like to know if they ever found out who (had to be a GM) mailed that thing to my guildmate and why. 
---
It‚Äôs the gorge bridge just southeast of Flatwoods.
---
Yesss, I like playing third person but just because of that it makes almost impossible for me to play that perspective.
---
Wholeheartedly agree. Once ran into a 3-star behemoth outside Whitespring and although one unlucky sentrybot did wind up tanking a good chunk of the damage, it was still the most exciting fight I've had since my first successful Scorched Earth.
---
Well they still apply to pistols and rifles and heavies but yeah besides the Gatling plasma and the Gauss energy weapons need a buff
---
I think that only applies when youre intially selecting a duplicate when you level up. I had 2 rank 2 lockpicks for the longest time because I chose not to upgrade and went back into the menu afterwards so to pick a lvl 3 safe. On the other hand they may have made the change in a patch and not noted it.
---
yes i know, i have every mutation but empath and carn/herb. i do non pvp and mostly use the unstable for getting those pesky low levels i don‚Äôt wanna waste my durability on. just wanted to know if someone out there would want it for whatever reason. a friend of mine is collecting them all, thought someone else would be too. :) 
---
lol, well technically it does have an explosive rocket on it so this statement is kind of accurate as far as explosive goes. Also, the sledge theoretically would also hit from the front then blast from the back on the way through the enemy so two shot somehow is accurate too. I don't know how its possible but your statement is 100% accurate.
---
There is one in camp venture behind s locked level 3 door.
---
I mean, I don't know of many games that are invulnerable to hacking. Most companies let it trip their anti-cheat and ban later. Those getting banned for accessing the dev room likely didn't "exploit" anything to get there. They hacked the game. 
---
First off, this violates the rules of this subreddit. No witch hunts.
---
Secondly, it's possible to obtain "multiple TSE's" by purchasing or being given them. So, if a player wishes to sell those things, he may do so without crazies like you trying for form a posse.
---
It's a game, man. Chill the fuck out. 
---
But i wasn't sarcastic... I was joking. There is a difference.
---
Anyway, that logs you out by closing the client, doesnt your base reloading fix it? Or does that only work if you move it? 
---
yeah but you know whats waiting for you at the end of that day?
---
a mirror - with your own judgemental eyes staring right back at you.
---
*Any* source on that or is it just more hearsay?
---
I love energy weapons, usually my go-to even with all the amazing mod guns.
---
That said-- I doubt they'll get substantial damage buffs now that legendaries exist. Maybe a guaranteed legendary enemy in every location? So go from place to place as opposed to just one place on many different servers?
---
Durability absolutely needs to be looked at, if Bethesda don't at least allow modders to do so.
---
&gt; the game will be more polished by then
---
God forbid a AAA title be polished at launch.
---
I can't speak for OP, but I absolutely would play solo on a private server, with a friend or two joining my world from time to time. I'd never log into the real server if that were an option.
---
***Objection***, your honor! That's hearsay!
---
I have the heavy searing sharp rockwt sledgehammer mod. 
---
Not sure what plans I have. Not near a workstation. I just logged on for a second. 
---
Message me your PS4 ID if you want me to craft this for you or mod something. 
---
Same here!  Exploding, bloodied though.
---
I'm having the same problems - PS4 Pro with game installed on external USB3 drive. Reading different threads here, some PS4 Pro owners are having no issues. I'm starting to wonder if the game being installed on an USB3 drive is the issue. Seems unlikely that Beth would run testing against that particular setup.... 
---
I think you mean Bethesda Softworks
---
An acquaintance of mine.
---
Tesla cannon and Heavy Incinerator. I dont even care if they arent top tier weapons, those are just plain fun.
---
"some of the comments directed towards anyone that likes the game get real personal"
---
He says, as he gets real personal
---
Yeah if your not having fun just put down the controller and come back in a month or two the bugs have been reduced I barely come across a few bugs
---
Also, opossums are really cute. Ive only killed one, but it was a one shot, so i dont feel bad.
---
Cloaking assaultron or scorchbeast.
---
I was there at the time, and they did indeed find out who did it. No employee was able to create an item without a trail leading back to them, ESPECIALLY developer tools. That was the type of thing that generated an internal alert and was sent to a team specializing in internal investigations to determine who was responsible and why it occurred. I can't remember the details of this specifically and couldn't speak to them if I could, but there were actually a few times stuff like this happened. I believe the one you're referring to got the most attention, though. 
---
the current theories that seem to be supported anecdotally: 
---
* Each area will either have legendary enemies or not in certain locations.  So let's say watoga: there's probably 3-5 locations where a legendary might spawn.  So for the sake of argument let's just say there's 5 potential legendaries in the "outside" part of watoga. When a server instance is created, there will something between 0-5 legendaries in each of the 5 spawn location.
---
* If killed, those legendaries will respawn when the cell resets.  So returning to an area that has a lot of legendaries the first time will yield more if revisited after enough time has passed (15 minutes irl or so).
---
* Each server "rolls" a list of \~4 weapons and \~4 armors that are eligible to drop as legendary items server wide
---
* Each server also "rolls" a list of legendary effects that will drop.
---
So adding all this up the perfect storm is: find a server with say 2-4 areas that have spawned multiple legendary enemies AND has already dropped a desired weapon with a desired effect.  So if you goal is to find a tse shotgun you'd be first be looking for a server that drops a legendary shotgun #1 and then also dropping items with two shot and/or explosive items dropping.  From there, you then need to go to multiple enemy dense locations to find 2 or 3 that have at least 2 or more legendaries, the more the better.  Lastly, you'd cycle through the areas you've found hoping that tse shotgun finally drops for you.
---
Please note this is not 100% verified info above, it's just the current best guesses at how legendary items are generated coupled with understanding of how legendary enemies are (re)spawned in any given area.
---
Its a majorly PVE game with a pvp mode patched on just let people play as they like so long as they aint being cunts to you. I used to dupe back in ES oblivion are you going to get me banned?
---
I fucking hated that quest to begin with lmao. Looking back, you can really appreciate it.
---
Hey I appreciate the response tho, since you clearly care about the quality of the game. Do you think there will ever come a time when the balance changes may affect or build, if they make more drastic changes, or do you have enough stuff built up?
---
Nah Enclave aren't any better this time around haha
---
Bloodied explosive black powder pistol 1200 damage it's not much but it works 2nd is instigating explosive Gatling gun for sbq and grognaks axe 3rd

I love my TSE shotgun. Bought from some dude on ebay.
---
Your wanted until someone kills you
---
Sounds to me like you're a dirty duper pooper
---
Two shot lever...because it is literally the best weapon I have right now.
---
Not even close. Nice assumption.
---
I play woth my wife and some friends. I want a private server to avoid asshats at both ends of this game.
---
I actually enjoy the landscape, lore, wandering and grinding. 
---
Not really.  Didn't see levels, I'm assuming they were quite a bit higher if a two person group didn't roll everything.  Level is based on what first in cell when they spawn, so swapping servers typically fixes.  I was having so issue soloing the east side in my mid 20's doing that.
---
Bethesda employes would be like "LOL!!!! Tldr bruh"
---
I think it could be pretty good, with Electrically Charged, Plague Walker and the PA torso mod as a kind of AoE deflector build. But I think there could be some issues with pvp flagging if people aren't careful.
---
my lvl29 doesn't have that card yet :(  
---
It makes sense as the combat shotguns fire speed is about the same as a swing from a super sledge and both seem to heal well with vampire. Proof, I use both fluently. Swing time on my +swing speed vampire legendary sledge swings at almost the same speed as one shot from my combat shotgun (modded). Somehow though, the sledgehammer outperforms it in damage. I'm assuming because mine is just a two shot and not explosive. If I find a vampire explosive combat shotgun one day... you know what I am using lol.
---
did you just log on or had you been playing?
---
The huge tree/rock thing that‚Äôs lifted up in the air in the mire has the same giant metallic head inside the cave in the middle. The same model of head you can find in the Dunwich Borers. So there‚Äôs a lease a little hint of something there 
---
Xbox. Sorry. Keep taking workshops. You dont have to stay at em. Just take em and leave. They do pop up there. 
---
No, they had to rewrite entire chunks of their engine to accommodate online, but that doesn't matter because they used models from FO4 instead of making all new assets from the ground up. No one ever bitches about NV being made of reused 3 assets. 
---
yeah fallout has never had it, but the fact that skyrim has it.. i feel like fallout should  have it by now. i mean at least for melee weapons, they'd function similar to skyrim. guns i guess would the only hiccup but considering the guys that did doom helped with the fps mechanics of this game and fo4, i feel like it wouldn't be difficult. maybe instead of giving us a dual wielding feature, they could add new weapons that are dual wielding by default. the weapon for example would be called dual combat knives or dual .44
---
I just love the way it looks and sounds. it does good damage too.
---
yeah i usually have pacifist on. but i agree with you. they do make a good combo! 
---
Thanks, glad you like em!
---
What kind of pipe rifle you looking for?
---
I managed to get a two shot black powder rifle from a legendary firefly ._. 
---
And it hangs around at a bar.
---
I remember my first time in a nuke zone like it was yesterday I had Appalachia radio playing in the background glowing 3 star prancing towards me as my frame rate drops my friends waving to follow them. Smiles all around... game crashing music stops.  Like your ice cream falling off the cone hitting the floor. No kid should ever have to experience this.
---
I love the show.  Head and shoulders above the lame version from the 70's, "Project U.F.O.".  Good cast, and high production values.  Seems to cover the historical cases from multiple points of view, from skepticism to belief, with enough mystery and intrigue to also be entertaining.   Aidan Gillen is enjoyable as scientist (and author) J. Allen Hynek.
---
The TS mod actually forced you to swing it like a Hammer Ball (track and field event) and perform two full rotations per attack.  The explosive aspect comes from the accelerated self-regenerating plastic explosive microbes that were developed by West Tek.
---
Hardly a AAA game

Even before the patch I found the use of VATS extremely intensive on fusion cores with power armor. It's too bad because with my build (VATS/sniper) it is completely necessary. Since we've basically forced to use PA in nuke zones and other circumstances it basically makes my build unrealistic. I'm sadly starting to transition now to a hybrid max STR melee build with some cross training in rifles... sad to have to do it though...
---
Dont stay at your camp with a bounty as it can be destroyed by someone who will not receive a bounty for doing so.
---
Platform would help, if on xbox I could take care of that bounty for you.
---
What platform are you on? I'd love to come by and see it. 
---
logged on, been server hop for PA
---
Yep, that‚Äôs the place. Even besides that little secret the whole location is really awesome 
---
It will prevent you from putting anything over 600 weight into your stash. Technically you can carry as much as you want on your character but you will be over-encumbered, move slow, unable to fast travel, etc.
---
would be cool if they added a perk for dual wielding. make it level 50 so it's more of an end game option 
---
Nothing happens, you can't store any more.
---
Time for you to do some storage management.
---
Bulk some stuff / sell stuff / toss stuff / craft stuff
---
Honestly forgot it exists. I'm really not into dueling systems where both people have to consent. I prefere a more natural Griefing / Revenge System but this game doesn't have it the way i want it. I like the drop junk part but i wish when a player is Wanted there would be a chance to drop one of his weapons or an armour piece. And ditch the whole slap damage part, do full damage from the start. And to avoid accidents make players hold CTRL while attacking players or Camps to flag the first hit. But the damage needs to be separated on pvp then pve to avoid 1 shots.
---
This is what is wrong with this community, this "the game will be more polished by then." mentality to completely asinine. Players shouldn't have to wait for a game to be more polished in order to accomplish basic functions. OP is right and justified in his rant.
---
After playing awhile, I agree completely.  I was hopeful about switching up builds for a fresh feel, but attributes lock you down into a build anyway.  
---
Personally I don't see how it's an issue without duping.  They just are not that common in the wild to get hordes of a specific one.
---
Alas, no: PS4. But it‚Äôs nice to know that being a good egg is cross-platform.

this, though you can still carry on your character (though you will quickly get over encumbered).  
---
imo there's plenty of stash space, you just need to grasp that most items are not worth keeping and you only need so many mats.

Pretty sure at some point they said it couldn't be done because of server instability.

The map and locations definitely don't feel like they're 4 times the size of FO4

They all do it for me.

Happening on my playstation, all the time now. Not just PC
---
I've only killed her once and even with the move I didn't run. I attacked from a distance, which makes since because I was a level 29 with a half finished sniper build. There's no reason to hide like a coward and cause the people who worked hard on launching a nuke to fail Scorched Earth. Unacceptable.

is there any other bos paint for t-60 in the legit list atm?
---
Once again, I don't wish to imply that TSE means duping. TSE DOES NOT mean duping.  I'm talking more about duping bobble heads and using the effects with TSE weapons.  The damage done allows them to one shot kill people who don't even enter into PVP mode. 
---
Makes sense, I tend to photograph glitches mostly so it fits right in. 
---
I think you're forgetting that people aren't 100% stupid and don't trade with their entire inventory on their trading character. People can just make a second character / have a second account and you'll have no proof. Good try though. Witch hunting isn't allowed by the way.
---
You can mod them "Lightweight" or "Ultralightweight" and they become totally weightless 0.00.
---
Sorry, yeah--Xbox. Next time I'll probably be in the game is about 7 hours from now--1am EST. 
---
Ha that funny you think bethesda has any QA at all. Man given that every game they release has more bugs than game at launch. If they do have a QA team is one old guy who doesn't know how to even turn on his tv/monitor and just says its good so he can get paid and go take a nap.
---
A friend has twice now. Had to restart completely. 
---
You'd have better luck doing the Pleasant Valley run.
---
Here is your role play challenge for next session -&gt; NO PERK CHANGES! If it's that annoying just role play your choice for better or worse. Give you incentive to team up!
---
This is awesome! Don't have to read it all now but saved it for later.
---
Too often here
---
That's pretty cool to know
---
I've always enjoyed FO lore and I agree definitely feels like there is a whole to the story
---
I found a level 10mm witg exploding at level 13 or so on my first character i used it for awhile
---
Must be cause of dupers lol
---
correct, collecting perk cards is not progressing.
---
For some reason I was never given this quest after basic training :(
---
But i don't get the end game. This game is all about grinding legendaries and that makes no sense to me in a singleplayer with editable savefiles.
---
Might be a really small Moses in there
---
Meat hook. I love to hook my meat. 
---
It‚Äôs really great for tenderizing your steaks before consumption.
---
if i didnt play with dupers, there would be no other high levels to play with
---
I've considered it, after the first 10 or so I switched to making them in a print quality size in case I went somewhere with it. I'll definitely put them together into a pdf so folks who want to could print it out for themselves, and if I could get away with it might set it up on some print to order place. Hadn't thought about putting up the individual pages for sale... I could do it on redbubble. I've started posting print versions (without the paper texture, background items and such) on my patreon slowly, but like i said when I finish I'll probably put a pdf for everyone who wants it. (probably after everyones lost interest)
---
Are you autistic? I wasn't about figure out the precise percentage. The concept is that it's high.
---
not wrong.  not even a little :(  
---
really messy state of things.  I am hoping so hard it improves soon.
---
Damage and TSE don‚Äôt matterfor cripple chance. I ran just a hardened combat shotgun for a while and the scorch beasts land after a mag or 2
---
I agree totally, but what can you do, really the best thing anyone at this point should have done is ask for their money back, that's the only way to let big companies know that they can't fck their playerbase.  
---
Other than that, you can only complain and complain but the fixes will come with time and ranting all day on reddit wont help at all.
---
yep I go to them whenever i see them pop. uranium fever seems to jsut be lower level stuff now.
---
Could it have something to do with "Well fed" buff wearing off? The buff gives you HP and even more HP if you have the "Rejuvenated" perk.
---
Why do they need perks that affect them? Ballistics don‚Äôt have unique perks for only ballistics.
---
Energy do need a ton of fixing though
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Nah, Initiate is the only legit one in the loot tables right now.
---
If you're on consoles use the LB or R1 and it doesnt go below 0
---
I prefer luring a pack of mobs into the shop and popping a stealth boy. No bounty that way üòÅ
---
That thing looks SICK!!!!!
---
I suppose you could pivot off of what someone just posted earlier.
---
The post included a door frame with pictures covering the actual doorway, leaving a small gap at the bottom which they used to spy through from a saferoom.
---
You could instead use that gap to "Sit" in a chair on the other side of the picture frame, essentially passing you through the hidden door. A secret entrance only those who know the trick could use.
---
I was told that look has no bearing whatsoever on loot drops do you have any evidence to back up your claim that luck has a bearing on loot drops?
---
Your experience isn't mine bro. Every day I play with my friend for two hours.
---
30m of that "play time" is thrown away at setting up a team.
---
God forbid most of the time we just skip it and turn on pacifist. Cause teams can't share xp. Like really.... Kind of expected that in the game since launch..................
---
I expected to play fallout. With friends. Not spend half the time being disconnected from them one way or the other.
---
Junkies exploding lever action. Its only lvl 35 but it's a ton of fun to use!! Found it legitimately so its even more special!!
---
The problem I see with it is, the person coming to collect the bounty is still in "virtually invulnerable slap damage mode". So you can't defend yourself. They should make it so a person needs to click on the bounty on the map to accept the bounty and flag themselves to the bounty before they can just shoot them dead. Then the person with the bounty could at least try to defend themselves and two consenting parties could have some pvp.
---
Maybe future DLC?
---
What is CTD? I've never heard of it (Or am used to calling it something else).
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs your I‚Äôm saying just put it down and relax
---
I have seen this, but how much better is an activate to open system 
---
Welcome to the "game as a service" mentality.
---
I've had the game load with nothing in it, and crash once the map opened.
---
100% with you! I'm not fully into PvP but it's a nice change up, just hate it constantly being on the disadvantage!
---
The whole armour/weapon dropping sounds so good, it would give more of an incentive
---
So do you know any locations on where a wolf is a possible spawn. I just want man's best friend...
---
Quad explosive shotgun free range ethically harvested.

Yeah, I have one level of Bandolier equipped üòÄ

I even contacted twitter and they basically said in a link that if its waiting on agent means they got all our information and basically delivered the atoms and waiting on the bag, yet I never got the atoms and they keep ignoring the ticket sigh. Watch us not get the bag either or its crappy and 0 atoms..............
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info. The only thing I remember about our buddy getting it was he had a ticket for either lost items or stolen items. It had been an ongoing thing and one day in response to the ticket he got that shirt. I never had it in my possession but I am pretty sure I was there every time Karate used it. When we first tried it on some random mob and it worked. We were like "holy shit, no way". There was discussion about whether should we use it or report it. Karate and I were definitely the big proponents of using it, lol.
---
That is one of my favorite stories to tell. I'll never forget when we came back to Dalaran after Ulduar. People were freaking out. We used it a few times in pug OSs before that though. The pugs were freaking out  like "What just happened?!" and we are in the guild's vent laughing our ass off.
---
Doesn't apply exactly to your situation but I've noticed that power attacks burn through them insanely fast. I was used to spamming the crap out of it and I went through 5 cores in like a hour. 
---
This has been my experience too since the patch. It's really frustrating to start a long mission then crash halfway through. Before the patch I could at least play 1 to 1.5 hours before crashing, now it's every 10-20 minutes, or every few minutes in Whitespring. Not fun.
---
Just a nice change up, just end up getting bored literally 15 minutes after coming into the game
---
Mother-in-law? 
---
There *is* usually a point where a product becomes an "asset flip". 99.9% of the time, "asset flip" is used to describe a game made of assets purchased from a third party which are then just dumped into that game. The other .1% of the time, it's Fallout 76. 
---
The DMV
---
Did you ever get your atoms cause I haven't yet even though I kept replying to the ticket and even their twitter.
---
I was on a fucking hurry to finish my gameplay session and go to jiu-jitsu class, after I *thought* I hit a checkpoint, I closed the game. 
---
When I came back I had to redo the whole thing... Man... Was I frustrated. 
---
to the place
---
Gameplay-wise, don't you think a guy takimg absolute 0 damage from all sources while standing still or being able to turn invisible is a bit broken to do in Power Armor?
---
How much do you fast travel? 
---
No, but I agree with /u/MuForceShoelace, the blame for most of this rests on Bethesda's shoulders as much as on any passing knave.  To suggest honor has anything to do with any of this is just hyperbole.
---
&gt;a vampire explosive combat shotgun. 
---
Stop! My penis can only get *so* erect!
---
Oh hell yeah! GT: BiigManEll 
---
No, I don't mind doing that, the timing has to be right for me to mic'd though--sometimes the ambient noise of the house and occupants would be too much. I don't want to be that guy. And honestly most times I'm on mic, NOBODY is around me. I have the audio set to 'area', I suppose I could blast to the whole map looking for someone who wants 10 free caps. but I've never heard anyone do that, either.
---
I‚Äôll be on all day tomorrow from 10-3. Eastern time
---
If you are sniper get the ignore armor perk cards for that extra damage or the increase sneak attack damage perk cards
---
That quest was fun the first time i did it. After my progress was lost and I had to redo the entire thing not so much.....
---
Uranium fever seems to be capped at lvl 35/40 gear, still a 3*  lvl 35/40 with good rolls can be better than a 1 or 2* max lvl item. I LOVE weight reduction rolls.
---
All the best bud, hopefully we'll kill the Queen sometime and not even know it.
---
I would help, but four frames per hour isn't particularly interesting.
---
Crash To Desktop :)
---
Where‚Äôs it at tho...
---
Yep.   Happened to me last night and then again today.  Today it was one restart and it fixed.  Last night it took six restarts and a power cycle and I finally got it moving again after a death.
---
Pack of sticky tabs and a large monitor.
---
There is more to come I hope on the scorched. I also think we popped out a few days after the big event that seemed to have wiped out the populace. What is of interest to me is the petrified corpses. If you look many of the scorched pose as them and I am curious if that i more of a cocoon of sorts than anything else.   
---
We have a wait and see with the development, I just hope all the haters didn't totally sink the game and it gets a solid year at least of DLC projects.   
---
As for the BoS yes there is some things missing and need to be filled in. I don't think it would be to hard for them to add a military bunker somewhere that is loaded ala enclave style less the AI.  Also we know that the scorched has to have been defeated as it is no where else in the other games. But what is the thing that is making and controlling them? I doubt it is the queen.
---
If you haven‚Äôt noticed in the video Wooby in the dev room wears it...
---
If duping is bad, it should be obvious that keeping that shit is bad. It doesn't make you much better than the dupers.
---
The bos paint has 3 different plans. You can get it for the chest, legs and arms.
---
They are an upgrade to Combat Armor
---
Wouldn't those effects on a ripper be better?
---
This happens very regularly to me at the safe in the broken house next to the Harper‚Äôs Ferry vendor. It‚Äôs very frustrating, especially as it‚Äôs a level three lock.
---
don't they leave unlootable goo piles as corpses?   I don't get that.
---
100% agree with this post. The lack of content is causing players to create their own purpose.  This is what the game is supposed to be. Show them your inventory if your legit???
---
Nah its cool you get a hit on any enemy I‚Äôll kill immediately 
---
More weapons would include the Death Tambo, Drill, Mr. Handy buzzsaw, pitchfork, and the black powder guns. 
---
I know I jest. 
---
Capitol building dmv. You have to do the dmv quest as part of getting into the brotherhood. It‚Äôs really not that good
---
so youd been on already to confirm you had junk. was just makin sure. yeah sounds like a login bug sadly. habe you tried relogging since?
---
That's true as well
---
It's a modification for Combat Armour.
---
That's the best and first non-whiney suggestion i've read all day. Bounties could be like events.
---
Revenge as a dish served hot isn't so terrible. It's not unbelievable that guns can 1 shot someone. I think that you can get revenge for someone taking your bounty.
---
Heh, re-revengeance.
---
"Basic fucking logic" What a fool.  You're completely missing the point that more players increases the Queen's resistances, and it's entirely possible that without all the extra "nublets" OP would have killed the Queen just fine.  How do you get this far in the thread still not knowing that?
---
In the other games there were perks for them.
---
Oh. I play on XBox, and yea, that shit happens all the time to us. Even happening before the update.
---
Oh neat 
---
UwU
---
I can only guess. Considering 2.5 billion people play video games, FO76 being a premium title and released on multiple platforms, I'm guessing it's possible millions play and have played this game. So I thought my estimate is very consersative.
---
Even if you narrow down the definition of 'community', 1MrE rightfully points out this sub alone has 170K followers.
---
I see them quite often at Welch station :) 
---
Thx. So do I need to learn crafting combat armor first ?  Do I need a plan to learn it ?  
---
Yeah you'll have to learn the Combat Armor plans first (which are then further divided into light, sturdy, heavy if I'm not mistaken).   
---
Can't remember where I got the light CA plans, haven't found any sturdy or heavy as of yet. 
---
The BoS plan is a mod. Think they can also be divided into legs/arms/torso. 
---
At lvl 12 you can have rank 3 of demolitions perk.  Shotguns get explosive damage for each pellet, and each shot is multiple pellets depending on the gun.
---
so any shotgun with the "explosive" effect can potentially deal massive damage even at lvl 12.  
---
Beyond that there is a bug/glitch where bobbleheads stack, and refresh duration when relogging.  So it's possible the base damage is legit but stacking multiple bobbleheads and then constantly reloging to keep the effect more or less permanent results in an op character.  
---
Lastly, PvP has this wierd level scaling thing where low level players have massive DR vs high level players.  I was once PvP'd by 2 level 100+'s when I was lvl 30 or so and they couldn't touch me.
---
Turns out this is an excellent way to get those stubborn people who keep coming back despite the fact you keep steamrolling them to move on. It‚Äôs like a T-bag but less juvenile.
---
You don't need to blow but it absolutely changes the sound. I've played the damn thing so much I have chips in my teeth!
---
I bought them at Camden Park
---
yeah, since i'm still hopping, oh well, kind of kills the game right now for me :/ idk where i can grind what I had easily, like 200+ screws, springs, and gears. Was saving up to build X-01
---
PTR is not for fucking bug fixes. That's all they do right now, patch the game to where a state ah competent company would ship a game to begin with.
---
And what good would it do to test simple shit like not scrapping mods for steel, remove level range for plans etc? 
---
Apparently ppl don't understand /s in this sub. Sarcasm is just too over these ppls heads
---
haha I remember it blowing up pretty big internally at the time. it was a pretty big deal, especially since there were supposed to be safeguards to prevent dev items like that from ever hitting a players account but for whatever reason they didn't trigger. 
---
No, you just need a piece of combat armour to mod. Just like how you add pockets to armour you turn it into to the BoS variant.
---
Bulk. Sell. And decide which weapons and ammo you are actually gonna use.
---
Pisses me off you can't even wear armor with it. I found out last night a level 40 combat knife with the serrated mod is absolutely devastating too.
---
When my main character has 3 luck and has terrible drops and conditions versus amounts of items maybe 1 to 2 and then my LUCK character has upwards of 3 to 9 per kill... yeah.. I'd say that is enough considering I have all 5 characters above level 90 and have changed builds and restarted characters 3 times from the beginning. Been playing since BETA, and whoever told you that Luck doesn't affect drops.. apparently it was the internet and you didnt test it.
---
Stopped playing after the game crashed on me 5 times in 15 or 20 minutes. And not for the first time either. üëé
---
Huzzah! Curious, how much rad resist is it per toy? Been playing but haven't actively sought out toys and being lazy, sorry :P
---
I think the big thing to do lately is put the nuke down so the prime fissure is right on the edge, then fight the queen outside of the rad zone.  Then you can wear whatever you want.
---
I already stated this. 
---
&gt; thus making me just as bad as a human but without the cheating.   
---
Honestly I don't care what anyone thinks, I didn't dupe it. I found it in world stashes or by killing players so the spoils go to me and I can do with it as I please. 
---
Roger that! I feel the same way - kinda feel obligated because I had some high lvl guys drop stuff for me when I was a lvl 5 newbie and it got me out of a few jams as I was learning the ropes. That's what I really like about this community - there are good dudes out there playing and they will help. I'm going to do my part as well.
---
I‚Äôve noticed to stop it from happening when you log in you have to let the game load a little. If you move too quickly, open your pip boy or the worst one, open your map, it will likely paralyze your character.
---
It‚Äôs happenned to me around 15-20 times (I open the map a lot when I login I‚Äôve come to realize)
---
Bless your pure heart young traveler
---
the square one doesn‚Äôt have this issue because you sit inside while crafting the structure so it‚Äôs impossible to block it, where as the round one you stand behind it while crafting and it has much more lenient placing parameters meaning you can place it somewhere where it is impossible to get behind it, this causing the bug.
---
Playing video games is supposed to be relaxing ? Oh wait I get it.
---
That's not how it works. When you're at that low a level and you see one you run the other way. :P
---
Guy, just put it down and come back a month later
---
Yeah it should be like 'level 38 you either unlock it automatically (INT 6+ required) and it is a skill that does not count towards your perk cards/abilities' or this but you can choose to take a perk or hacking/lockpick at every level until you do.
---
They exploited the fact that Bethesda kept the ‚Äúdev room‚Äù included in the public builds of Fallout 76.
---
Oh. Ok. Thx. So I need any combat armor first.  Do u know if there is a plan for combat armors ?  Or I just have to loot or buy  them ?
---
ohhh fuck dude that blows :( honestly itd ruin it for me to, screws and gears dont come easy at all.... 
---
Yeah, I agree that‚Äôs fairly uncommon but s dude like that can wreak havoc on a server and become an issue for many players in a short time, considering the traffic will be higher as a lot of people will hop server and new ones will come
---
You think it‚Äôs just called bayonet?
---
in all honesty t bagging has transcended being simply juvenile. its a universal language across multiple game universes. its quite amazing actually
---
It actually animates the downward thrust in 3rd person view, should be impossible given the direction of the nozzles..
---
lol, I don't think that is going to help much!
---
Thx a lot
---
Challenges will add tens if not hundreds of hours to the game. I've been doing those as end-game. Usually when you do one challenge it opens another (do a 20 atom challenge -&gt; 40 atom challenge opens, do a 40 atom challenge -&gt; 80 atom challenge opens).
---
A few warnings: Some challenges are still bugged but most are not. Some of the challenges are really really grindy and can become boring. Also you will need about 5000-10000 adhesive (at least that was the case before latest patch changed how repair works).
---
Didn‚Äôt catch that my bad 
---
Insult to injury would be if you stared at your pipboy first and then munched on them so it gives the appearance you switched out a perk card just to feast
---
Quad broadsider with the multi shot canister, nothing says fuck you like six round volleys of cannon fire. 
---
I'm on PC. Haven't done organized fights yet. Team fights have erupted when one of our camps got attacked, when hunting wanted players escalates and when meeting people in stations while trading and then talking or using the pvp emote
---
I wish I had read this last light when my base was leveled by the tard brigade 
---
I'm around tomorrow too. I'd love in. 
---
That's a good tip, never thought of that
---
What do you play on? An error like this sounds like It would be better to go over together in-game.
---
I might have one....im at work for about 5 more hours though
---
Yeah, at this point i'm just blah, well now i'm taking a break unless i get someone to team with, playing solo is shit and with that bug it kills my mood
---
Yea, they need to get this shit handled. Should have got zenimax in to help. ESO was made really well I thought.
---
Not very wasteland like!
---
The big one is melee gets a damage boost for each point of STR.  High damage melee I rarely even bother with incisor.
---
youll be back. especially if you play this game to build CAMPS
---
It almost feels like Marine Armor was supposed to be in the "heavy" category. Like its been accidentally flagged as "sturdy".
---
its been like this since day 1
---
Crap I left that out.  Im on Xbox
---
Minigun.
---
"Fuck everything in this General Vicinity."
---
This is stupid. Not everyone has the time to run 20 nukes a night. These people minmaxing the game have this idea that everyone is doing so. 
---
üòÇ 
---
The thing is, if a high level player gets a 10 cap bounty, you flag him and he kills you, he gets the same amount of caps as your level yet was only risking losing 10 caps. It makes no sense at all and is really better at tricking people into losing their caps if they come I‚Äôll-prepared, than for punishing someone for a bad action
---
I almost shat myself when I saw it
---
That is a great point - what exactly are the petrified? I get the feeling like there was this bio-nuke or everyone got gassed on one particular day.
---
They are in various poses that makes it look like it happened instantly. If it was a gradual illness then it would make more sense to find a hospital full of petrified's.
---
So...a strange greenish light exploding on the horizon, a wave of sickly gas passes over the entire state, everyone dies or is transformed to a Scorched / FEV Super Mutant in one single day?
---
...is it possible the GECK Garden of Eden Creation Kit did all of that? Maybe it built up massive pressure then it erupted underground and it was tainted by some mutant DNA or mad vault-tec experiment. Maybe it was the Ultracite research.
---
Hmm, at what point in the time line did they nuke the ultra mine? Here is a really weird thought: that was what prompted the war and maybe everything. Maybe that mine was where they got FEV from and the explosion of military technology culminated in the world war.
---
i feel ya. well i found this screw breakdown article, maybe itll help get some of them back :/
---
It seems odd, but I very rarely hear anyone taking charge over the mic. If someone would just plainly state, "If you are not doing any damage to the SBQ, hit her a couple of times, so you get credit, but then target everything else so the players that are doing damage can focus on her."
---
Also, since she needs a clear place to land, she might not land on other enemies, so keeping them cleared is a bonus.
---
where do I even go to start the brotherhood quests
---
Glowing meat steak gives you +10% for melee
---
Yep. Happened to me six times last night, just got done with a Nuked Whitesprings run and had a junk overload of flux and whatnot. Froze the first time, restarted, and then this happened to me six times. 
---
The sixth login all of my junk was gone, so yeah, I have no idea. 
---
Never mind, you listed it ü§£
---
That fucking quest is why I am now on board with the enclave DEATH TO THE BROTHERHOOD FOR MAKING ME SUFFER THE DMV
---
Well now I know hhaha, 
---
Sure, I just figure the problem will mostly take care of itself once they get duping under control and duration bug fixed.   
---
I know for a fact the Sword of bastete can NOT make Julienne Fries. :(
---
Well guess what, you can join in too. What‚Äôs your gamer tag
---
they probably dont want other people to get the loot
---
10-3 tomorrow i‚Äôm in there
---
Now this.... Is funny.
---
Alright bro what‚Äôs your gamer tag
---
Agree completely. It is just another fake time sink in the game. Tedious and annoying. The game also forces you to server hop. The only rewarding thing in the entire game is farming white springs.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs like a T-bag but less juvenile.
---
And to go beyond after devouring their corpse is to then do the puke emote. 
---
dreadxfather
---
Yeah that's the usual gateway into pvp. I posted this to give people a way to connect. That way we can have some people on our friends list that we know are down to tussle. 
---
I‚Äôll see you there
---
Well of all the broken stuff, they fixed the respec thing quick didn't they? In any case they aren't mutually exclusive. It's critical for a game like this to be able to keep players engaged once they've digested most of the content, and that's probably the main driver for swappable perks. The RNG thing like you said could have had a different plan initially, before they went into full-on PR damage control mode.
---
"oh boy! A nocturnal wooden arm!"
---
Is there a Camden Park Vendor that I'm unaware of?
---
It will not affect your cards. Just the back end things those specials effect. 
---
I'm not sure if it's a SD Mart. It's kind d of small. The location is called Big B's Rest Stop.
---
They don't need to the special stats for that, just slow us to preset perk loadouts onto our favorite tab. 
---
The 30 caliber (30-30, 30-06, .308) has been the go to sniper rifle in the military for a very long time.  Wasn't really until recently that the big guns like the .50 or the .338 Lapua got popular.  Give those thanks to good ole CoD.  Between the 30 Cal and a good ole 7.62 you can make any sharpshooter a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, even with minimal training.  I love a .308, but with the Advent of the 6.5 creedmor round I'm leaning closer to it.  Would love to see something similar in fallout, but I suppose it really wouldn't fit with the times lol.
---
Actually, it‚Äôs Marine Armor Helmet. Looking at it right now.
---
If the creature is 3 star the item should be 3 star. Simple. Could be the same item 10 times in a row. But it has 3 stars.
---
Only thing I can say is make sure that you have a Technical Data in your character's inventory not your stash (Although it may not matter).
---
Also search around some more in Camp Venture for your other issues.
---
It's a submachine gun with no other perks then lol 5 demo it only does 136 damage with decently low health. Some things it won't kill fast others it will. The 91 deathclaw ate a clip but it was legendary 
---
I have a vampire's gatling laser, I can fight a scorchbeast outside of power armor without looking at my health bar
---
You know you don't have to be an ass right?
---
So good!
---
Yeah my second house was very big and very empty lol. 
---
Closest you can get that in game is to start a wall with a door frame, attach a door, then replace the door frame wall with a solid wall. I do that for my base where you have to parkour marsupial jump and enter in from the top.
---
The opposite might be true too. start with solid wall, add pictures and then replace with wall with door frame?
---
That being said, it would be nice to have a manor of mysteries style opening mechanism. Or a trigger of clicking a book on a bookshelf or opening a nuka cola machine and trying to grab a quantum inside it.
---
Cool guys, thanks a lot of cool insight. Was a little worried about player counts but it sounds like it's at an okay spot. I'm waiting for this delivery. Someone stole my package last night and amazon sent me one with 1 day shipping free of charge. Just shitty that someone stole a game.
---
Nice list, I didn't know multiples of food can stack. Best I get hunting, I've been lazily living off cannibal and irradiated  meat.
---
That‚Äôs what Destiny 2 does, if after a raid you don‚Äôt get the rare loot you want you can use the tokens that drop as well to buy it
---
Yeah, well, I mean, I've tried warfame, but, and I know this is gonna sound ludicrous and fucking stupid, but I honestly just hate most sci-fi, and the designs of most of the guns in the game look too organic, and it kind of enrages me in a strange way. I can't explain why, it just sort of does.

TKS!!

Your BoS plans spawn at Grafton Station Venderbot as well, if you're looking for a complete set. :) You may have to server hop several times.
---
You could just get all mutations for free by farming...
---
Can you make a TL;DR for your TL;DR?
---
Yes it did, by another name. The creation engine is just GamerBryo with a paint job and everyone knows it. Anyone that ever made a mod on skyrim and oblivion knows it. 
---
It is not even some secret or conspiracy. It is transparent for anyone that opens up the damn thing.
---
And even if you seriously want to be anal about the name, the creation engine is still 8 years old, so the argument still stands that it is ridiculous to try to hide behind the "they didn't know the creation engine" stance.
---
Yes there's a Responders vendor at the North end of the park
---
Remove TSE and Damage bobbleheads altogether.
---
Not only it solves the PVP issue... it stops people from one-shotting event mobs like QUEENS and 3-star Legendaries.
---
2xp per kill
---
I check to see if there's any grenades or mines in my inventory, it's funny to watch the latter get tripped.
---
I've got the same bug on PS4 after the 1.07 patch.  PSN: u4yk10.
---
I dunno man... World Of Warcraft had one where you kicked or pushed bears out of a tree and onto trampolines to ‚Äúsave them‚Äù. Thaaaat was pretty rad too.

#****SPOILER ON FALLOUT76 DMV QUEST****
---
when we needed to get the number called again... for the second dmv teller... omg, that killed me. Classic DMV. Im surprised we didnt have to pay an ‚Äúautomation fee‚Äù to file the correct paperwork. Lol
---
I think he only logical thing is that you died before the restart hence all the junk being gone. That sucks though! Sorry to hear that
---
Yup. They're both named the same. If you are on PC you can get the "Known Plans" mod that will tell you if you know a plan already, which will eliminate the 50/50 gamble the next time you see it for sale. Thanks Bethesda. 
---
&gt; This game is all about grinding legendaries
---
Says who?  It's not the end game for me.  Not everyone plays the same way :-)
---
I don't even think in terms of "end game."  I still play *Fallout 3* with all kinds of mods on it.  End Game is what you make it.
---
I am almost positive that GECK has a role in all this and not just how the mire got all over run.   
---
The FEV was already being used at both the prison, west-tek and hunterville. So those are explained. Also it is odd and I have found very little info but almost all of the vault 94 people are fresh looking deaths they do not have that green hue or mummified look.  Now I have come across a few that were green but I double checked a few other ones that were normal. 
---
This house is amazing even without the secret room.
---
How many other games do you know of that are unhackable? I certainly can't name many, if any. And most games don't ban hackers immediately. People using third-party software to hack and cheat their way to getting items that can *only* being obtained that way isn't Bethesda's fault. This happens with basically every other game. Look at GTAO. 
---
I‚Äôm confused on how collecting more and different power ups isn‚Äôt progressing. Can you explain how that isn‚Äôt progressing? I‚Äôm confused. 
---
I don't understand what the plus and minus to stats actually do. Can i view this on the pip boy?? If i lose intelligence in game does it effect anything?
---
Thanks for this! 
---
Marine armor is still my fave!
---
Omg no!!! Lmfao you guys are so mean:D
---
Good bot
---
If those are accurate numbers...
---
Oh Ill have to take a look at this, thanks man!
---
Not realistic you‚Äôd need to have someone watching 24/7 then.
---
I don't care to discuss anything but as player who knows almost everything about the game and has read 90% of the threads on every fo76 reddit, I'd like to at least vouch for your information being correct. 
---
Thank you so much for this in depth information brother, you are doing a huge service to the community by sharing your knowledge!  Stay safe in the wastes and may the RNG bless your farming runs!
---
done
---
It's a legit form of roleplay to be honest.
---
Everything is done in-game.

They're literally roleplaying as Raiders.

Well now I'm looking for a group or some people on PC to join, not looking for handouts just someone to tag along and BS on Discord with as I scavenge anything that isn't nailed down. Doing this solo is not fun in anyway \[personally anything but server hopping isn't fun solo\] so wanna see who wants to play. Lvl 62, was a scavenger/builder build \[max int and all the crafting perks\] but yeah just 1 point in each rifleman perk for combat
---
I had this the other day. If you hop servers it still persists. But just shut the game down and restart it, that fixed it for me 
---
I think the quests get better when you delve into it deeper. They aren‚Äôt all winners, but there are some good story driven ones. Fundamentally the game is what it is, though. If you really want character driven stuff, FO76 just doesn‚Äôt do that. 
---
No! &gt;: ( lol
---
This! I rp Nuka Girl in the game and my camp has as much Nuka as the game allows. We need more! 
---
(And also Nuka Girl or Nuka Cola flair on this SR) 
---
I read a previous post about someone who had tamed creatures, and after they were killed they still took up storage space.  Out of curiosity - have you tamed creatures?
---
Radscorpions make me sound like that.
---
There is the random camp raid now and then, other then that nothing else spawns inside besides inside the boxes scattered throughout the cave.
---
I usually want to vomit when I'm trying to hack away at some ghouls and some rocket-jumping TSE jockey comes in and cowboys the heck out of the place. What fun is that? I think the enjoyment for them (after the initial honeymoon is over) comes down to "Hey take a look at my BIG gun" rather than "I enjoy killing everything in one shot making the game boring and no challenge at all"...
---
But I vote FIX them not nerf them. I'm pretty sure Laser beams can't explode and maybe just the initial pellet of a shotty gets an explosion, not all the buckshot.
---
5 per toy, I believe the cap is 50 resist.
---
I'm sorry you payed 2500 :(
---
Another fake news story that has no proof besides bobbles actually stacking.
---
ty, appreciated nonetheless
---
You are doing the Overseer's work good sir, as an unarmed build I love those of you rocking the shotty/enforcer combo!
---
Or worse Walmart. Nothing beats working a 9 hour shift where most customers are yelling at you about  things you can't do anything about then going home tired from lifting heavy things, people yelling at you, Management treating you like shit, and taking care of 5 different departments. Working two jobs instead is a better call.
---
It's pretty tough to stealth on the queen. If you sit back and stay behind her, you can usually start getting sneak attacks after a few seconds 
---
On only a slightly serious note, there is a sulphur fountain in the stone gazebo by the clubhouse that will wipe those buggers right out.
---
Found the plan at Lewisburg Station just yesterday.
---
\+45% on any puncturing mod. 
---
I dunno, I have a modified PS4 that is blazing fast and reliable with other multiplayer games (Warframe, Destiny 1/2, Monster Hunter World etc) but blue screens every few hours with this game.  I'd almost forgotten PS4 games even could bluescreen until I played this.
---
I know this isn't the point of the post but how exactly does Uranium Fever work? I have never had the bar completely fill up, even when I didn't lose any of the extractors. Have also never failed the quest either.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 and when I tried to play today it seems I can‚Äôt and I keep getting kicked, I‚Äôve never been to that dev room more have I ever duped, I don‚Äôt even know how to..
---
They seem to be doing this for consoles to. 
---
Unless there was something I picked up in game that I shouldn‚Äôt have but I can‚Äôt think of any time when I did, ü§î
---
Should I perhaps make a support ticket? Would hate to be banned for something I took no part in...
---
Could you be any further up your own ass?
---
The Seal is inside as well. It's the post address that's outside. So 2 loading screens.
---
And thanks for quick reply 
---
Remember everything helps! Even if you're bashing a deathclaw with a protest sign, you're still helping by keeping it away from the players killing the SBQ.
---
You have break the TOS to get there. You literally have to hack the game. That's not an exploit. 
---
are you on xbox by chance? I'd pay you and bring my own materials to have this mod put on my torso
---
My first ‚Äúexciting ‚Äú drop was a two star explosive combat rifle (not two shot) at level 136 It took another 60 levels before I got an explosive double barrel. The rest was odds and ends sold back to vendors.

Garage doors will open with just the switch, won‚Äôt they?

I had, a megasloth and a death claw, both died.

The low levels who can‚Äôt contribute very much otherwise can at least do that or try to dps, just saying as long as they‚Äôre actually trying to do something to help I‚Äôm fine with low lvs coming even if it‚Äôs kinda annoying for the SBQ hp to go up 
---
Report them or you‚Äôre an accomplice.  And stop playing with cheaters.  Not every high level is a duper - find them and form your own group.
---
No, they don't. The number of players has no effect on the resistances. The level does, but again, they're nublets.   
---
Are you that fucking stupid you don't know that? Yes, yes you are.
---
Absolutely
---
I haven't checked the atom shop recently. Is it legitimately the same exact suit? 
---
Helped along by customers willing to pay for something and then wait 6 months for the developers to finish making it. Except normally they have the courtesy to slap 'Early Access' on the label.
---
It happens to me but not like stories i hear on here
---
You injectable Motrin and a fresh pair of socks of course
---
There is a hard cap on vendor discounts overall. Someone did the math with grape mentats, perk cards, and charisma 
---
Stupid.  Homophobe.  Cheater. 
---
I'll just wait until I'm good enough.
---
No, they don't. 
---
Same here. I don't like the Red Rocket branding, but I was willing to overlook it on a garage door that wouldn't look out-of-place on a building with metal walls. So much for that.
---
You know nothing about law.   Freedom of speech doesn‚Äôt apply to a video game, legally.  You are a high schooler.
---
K bud, you seem pretty upset so i'm sure you have enough things going wrong without continuing on arguing with me.  I'm not surprised given your lack of knowledge about how the Queen works, all the best.
---
You still have quests, but you want have a face to face conversation with the NPC giving the quest instead it is done throughbyoubdiscoveringbthe fate of the residents of Appalachia (reading terminal entries and holotapes).  It does require more work and it's not for those who don't enjoy doing a little work or reading to find the story.
---
It will become less like fallout 4 and more a combination of ARK and Fallout 4 the farther in you get.  I have a few hours of gameplay since release and I manage to find something to doevery day, but not all of my friends have continued to play they due to the continued grind for supplies.
---
It's a clean version without dirt or damage.
---
If you get an explosive hunting rifle, mod it for a .50 cal receiver, and pretend the damage isn't garbage, and put that muzzle break on it, you can sort of call it the anti-materiel rifle
---
If you think the CE and Gamebryo are the same, you show a lack of understanding of how game engine development works. If we're going by that logic, DOOM Eternal's engine is going on 27. 
---
Nothing worse than the SnallyGaster that shit is beyond disturbing. 
---
You don‚Äôt  need to know the combat armor plans, just need a piece of combat armor and you go to a armor workbench -&gt; modify-&gt; find that piece of armor and it should be the first thing on the list that you get, open it and there should be the ability to craft the mod
---
Love it ‚ù§
---
&gt;If you don't want to respond to what I am discussing, then don't reply. 
---
You're literally discussing something nobody else in this thread ever was. Go back to the incel reddit, it's where you belong.
---
Thank you :)
---
Im guessing no purifiers help too.  Ive got 3 but no turrets and Im constantly running into constraints with my build. 
---
Yeah.....
---
You missed the point I was making.
---
You claimed there was hardly any work done to make FO76 happen, when in fact it took tons of it. BGS recycling most of the texture and model assets doesn't change that.
---
Mine is also accurately described this way!
---
I was able to build my camp close enough to them, but wasn't able to get them working.. not sure if they are there for just show or what
---
So hackers created the dev room and put it in the game?
---
Says the guy who doesn't understand how mechanics work taking about lack of knowledge? Whatever, kid. Get to bed early, you've got school in the morning.
---
And none if that was reenforced. Nice baby talk, maybe try speaking like an adult. Also my sister is a lesbian and I love her all the same. I'm not a homophobe. 
---
Okay I posted something was wrong here is the right number pulled from the data files: flat 0.85 multiplier    
---
That is a damage resist multiplier. Here is the FO4 DR page that contains the info you are looking for. [http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
Mmmmmm no
---
You stared the epeen discussion, thus by your logic you are the one projecting. 
---
You also failed to understand what I posted in even the most bvasic sense. 
---
And now have resorted to the good old 2001 'seek counseling' burn. Wow, so sick. 
---
You have utterly failed in every way imaginable. 
---
I am on xbox I could put that dense marine mod on for u
---
It never gets old
---
Oh I want presets badly too. It would make playing so much better. But I still think with how many perks are dedicated to carry weight, making chems more effective, lockpick or crafting, that an extra point per ten levels would help too. As it is there's no real reason to level up other than to continually move things around. 
---
Level 291 almost 600 hours in and its still my favorite game to play. Playing with friends makes it a blast
---
Projecting hard here aren't ya?  Is that how mum phrases it?
---
20 year old password methodology, and garbage these days. That length is trivial to crack.
---
Not a high schooler and I didn't say it applied to video games. Read the other threads and you'll see. 
---
"Mum"   
---
Soyboy brit spotted.
---
This is when you know the game engine they're using is so horribly coded that fixing one thing will guarantee something else will broken.

That's blasphemy

I like your opinion, for what it's worth.

Yeah okay kid posting fifty posts begging for maga hats and calling people liberal snowflakes.

Still making money off of it selling full price as VR and Switch models.

Thank you! I'm trying to build up bogtown and make it impenetrable!...to anyone without marsupial :P

I hadn‚Äôt thought the vampire would be based on damage done since it was working even if you don‚Äôt hit anything, so I assumed quicker weapons would be better with it

There is an entry or holotape somewhere that explains that the petrified scorched essentially burned themselves out. Like the petrified form is the final stage of the scorched infection.

What does his comment have to do with being autistic? God, just crawl back into the hole you came from.

No, it's a clean variant.

One shot through slap damage when you were definitely in passive mode? You're positive you hadn't initiated PVP in any way i.e. defending or capping a workshop? I'd like to see video confirming that for sure.

I got Todd Howard out of a Scorchbeast Queen last week, disappointed because he was only one star legendary for 90% less weight...

Mininukes make good butt plugs
---
I can see how it can feel to most like a loophole, but I honestly think the Brotherhood presence here isn't as big of a stretch as people think.
---
It's only been 25 years since the bombs fell and destroyed America. We know from established lore that the Brotherhood are essentially what's left of the US military. They would have had access to vertibirds, weapons, and power armor. It makes sense, tactically, that they would initially send scouting expeditions to all corners of the US, trying to secure resources and survivors. Over time their objectives would shift to the 'hoard technology' mindset we are familiar with.
---
The branch here in West Virginia does feel like it wasn't terribly large, and notes and tapes talk about recruiting locals and rushing them through training. I can see the Brotherhood unit here as one of those scouting parties that came across the scorchbeasts/scorched, realized the potential long term threat they pose, and hunkered down to try and stop it.
---
You're so desperate to hurt, it's truly sad.

Party Boy/Girl in Charisma will double and triple alcohol effects. So whisky can give up to +6 strength. Solar Powered in Endurance can give up to +3 strength during the day.

Congrats to Bethesda for putting themselves in this position to begin with.  / golf clap 
---
Oh my god, thank youuuuu
---
That's what I was thinking. No way would they put the exact same thing in the shop. Thanks for info
---
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of your weeping vagina.
---
Certainly could be, and I don‚Äôt fault you, I completely get the time is money standpoint.  On a side note I have a pipe rifle tse I‚Äôm not using I would sell u for caps.  But back on topic, it very well may be a ban situation though idk why he/she wouldn‚Äôt just explain that.
---
Incorrect. Shotguns are quite effective at keeping her on the ground with the right perk(s). I have a Quad Double Barrel with +50% Limb Damage and additional chance to cripple. Even without that, the normal shotgun I used was excellent at keeping her grounded once she landed. 
---
When I capped him in the head I was immensely disappointed I couldn't take his number.

Thanks for responding, seems to do it when I fast travel. East past Savage Divide. Strange but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs up.

\- Vendor caps
---
\- Doing Legendary farm events like Uranium Fever, Horde, Leader of the pack ... etc
---
\- Farming Calibrated Shocks and Jet packs (even if you have them already, buy them and sell to other players)
---
\- Visit all possible vendors to purchase missing plans/recipes  
---
My CAMP is an ongoing project...
---
It‚Äôs 200 caps per faction vendor per day (or 20hrs). [Here‚Äôs a map](https://imgur.com/gallery/pBRwaMw)
---
There are a few passive scorchbeast that spawn in certain areas, they will only turn hostile if you attack then 
---
Enforcer works. 
---
You mean like Epic Games selling free social dances like it‚Äôs their own?
---
Same. I've been looking for someone to make one for me, but no one's online right now. Will be willing to offer some legendaries
---
I just don't get this.  Like why would tamed animals -- specifically enabled by a Perk in fact -- somehow become part of your camp budget rather than just be limited in number or tied to the Perk's use or something?  And if you do make that design choice, wouldn't you then necessarily have to consider what happens if and when the owner decides to get rid of the pet or it dies on its own?  I just don't get how this sort of stuff is a surprise to Bethesda.
---
From the game data, there are a bunch of events, quests, vendors and world locations for them:
---
&gt;Plans: Lever Action  
---
&gt;LVLI **QuestReward**\_LLS\_Schematic\_Weapon\_AshHeap\_Ranged - Overseer Personal "Personal Matters", Event: Load Baring, Event: Breach And Clear, Event: A Mine of Her Own, Event: Battle Bot, Earth Mover, Horde: &lt;xxx &gt;, Follow the Trail, Daily: Mistaken Identity, Hunter/Hunted, Silos: Monongah, SpruceKnob, SugarGrove, Power Plant events.  
---
&gt;LVLI LLV\_**Vendor**\_Recipes\_Base\_Faction\_Responders - Charleston, Flatwoods, Grafton, Morgantown Airport, CamdenPark, GraftonStation, MorgantownStation, Charleston Station, WelchStation, Lewisburg Station.  
---
&gt;LVLI LLS\_Recipes\_Weapons\_Ranged\_RegionSavageDivide - Safes (Advanced, Expert, Master), Raider Trunk/Safe.
---
I found mine at the Grafton vendor (not the train station vendor).
---
Talking out of his ass. Enforcer works. 
---
I carried one with me when I tried this so Im not sure if there is a minimum amount to activate it.  My plan tonight is to figure out what part of the mission gives you the password for the storage room.  I assume that's where the door key is and the key stays in your inventory like all the others. 
---
There are a few screenshots floating around I could send you of supposed emails from Beth.  This recent stuff seems to be linked to the update today for any Xbox user I‚Äôve talked to.  I admittedly have no probable source other than people I play with who have no real reason to lie to me about it.m, not are they the type to accidentally ditch their inventory.
---
Probably not. I'm not the type of person to say that they heard blah blah and must have been true. Test it and move on. Even test what I'm saying, doubt anyone will but that's why I can clear 20k caps a day from vendors versus the 1400 as a base value of availability. But I'm up my own ass so I'll just be there and not share :3
---
Im almost always down to kill a queen when im on. Anyone can add me, I dont mind helping murder.

Plagueweaver

Still against this subreddits rules 
---
Alright ill invite you tomorrow 
---
My camp is similar and open too! But since a lvl 50 scorchbeast circled me for minutes the other day (I‚Äôve just hit 20) I‚Äôve felt anxious and put up some walls around my bed so I can somewhat ‚Äúhide‚Äù.
---
You dumb duck bastard, did you pay for a game that is unplayable but ‚Äúmay be ok in a year‚Äù? Dipshits like you are why companies get away with this shit. 
---
Just for trolling purposes... id be down
---
First contact with a girl: Achievement unlocked!
---
Good thing you have copies of the preview pictures, they removed them if you go inspect the rolling door in the atomic shop
---
I agree
---
However... problem...
---
They **are** grayed out when you have learned them and just can‚Äôt equip them due to missing a perk so...
---
As far as Fallout's go it has a *really* weak opening, and the rest of the story doesn't serve much purpose other than to show you around to different areas and unlock some gear.  As for whether the game gets better, if you don't enjoy the concept of it now I don't see you changing your mind unless you start making or playing with friends.  It's the optional game mode you get once you finished the main story in a single player version of this type of game.  If the idea of that doesn't appeal to you then you should quit while you're ahead, because at it's core, that's all there is to it.  Explore, kill, survive, repeat.
---
I'm not dead-set on story, but games like that usually have something that stands out and that is the "hook" that keeps people playing (ARK has the whole tribes schtick with the bosses and tribe wars, DayZ was all about PvP etc.) Maybe instead of asking "Does it get better" I should've asked "How does the end-game look like" or "What's there to do after you finish the quests".
---
Grahm used to have more - that didn‚Äôt last long though.
---
It's the same deal with some of the other outfits like the Ski Suit. Easily the worst offers on the store, but it's not like I'm gonna spend money or f2p Atoms on it. 
---
I'm seeing this on xbox as well. The worst part is you can be attacked while the second loading screen displays. I had this happen loading into Grafton station twice this afternoon.
---
I will it will be a bit I'm at work atm
---
A regular lever action because I never get any good legendary drops and I still don‚Äôt have the handmade yet...
---
All - Report and move on  
---
OP - Go away
---
I see about one per play session, but that usually is at least two different servers. 
---
this isn't other games.
---
I'd be halfway across the map and that daily would pop up again without any clear trigger. Like 3 days in a row. I don't even use grenades.
---
I'm trying to trigger forest dailies to get spikes for my 3 star walking cane and they're just not happening unless some new player walks by and I catch it on the map at the right time. If they leave, the event stays on the map but it doesn't activate when I fast travel to it.
---
That actually makes alot of sense. I have been on servers where im getting some great legendaries... Its weird but that makes sense. 
---
Well I guess my next question is if anybody on xbox can put the actual combat armor dense chest mod on my chest I would pay them
---
Will probably be on, I'm pretty good at killing stuff by now GT: beakflats
---
My char practically IS a radworm at this place.
---
The fact that they have underestimated the intelligence of their players has bit them in the ass.  how hard can it be to not have a room where players can access?  I mean come on. 
---
I figured it will catch up to me sooner or later. If it's a critter I tend to try to lighten carry weight by using up heavy consumables. shot a fatman nuke on a chicken once. I was a tad too close to the blast. Was not my best moment.
---
Put the Motrin between your toes and foot powder in your coffee? 
---
Seems to be a theme with veterans that I know. 
---
I was lucky enough to buy one that someone sold to the Watoga Station vendor today. Xbox though. Been without mine for tens and tens of hours until today. 
---
Excellent, someone posted in another thread that legendary gear buffs have a set list per server, so ive been grinding whitesprings and it kinda checks out.
---
Id say find a server that has decent legendary drops and then run that queen into the ground.
---
Or just keep killin queens.
---
Im only here to help.
---
This prick serious?
---
Thanks Captain Obviouse. I dont think I'm the onky one who wants this.
---
1st contact with someone who is actually a girl is a real achievement
---
Noice. 
---
Is there a couple doors that are inaccessible by black mountain ordnance? Having a little trouble finding that last door.
---
I got you
---
It's not easily - people are using cheat engine or other trainers to get in. That'll do it in most games where they can datamine the location of GM island.
---
Not quite instantly, but close enough. About 5-10 seconds after you disappear, you CAMP leaves too. 
---
I didn't even know they added a Nuka-Quantum sign until you mentioned, so thanks for the inadvertent heads up!
---
You don't rank up the mod, but attaching it shows up in one of those 5 diamonds on a weapons stat page. I don't really know why those 2 mods specifically do it though, especially when we have things such as prime receivers
---
How high is 2,500? Are they duped or something? If I see someone selling duped items, and they admitted it, I report and block them immediately. I have 30k so it‚Äôs not a big deal. 
---
Oops my bad it was a bolt action pipe pistol.

I accidently grabbed the clean water purifier from the atom shop when I first started playing because I thought it unlocked the purifier. I didn't know it was just a clean skin lol. Never again though 
---
Sweet, sounds good to me 
---
So, I‚Äôm not gunna go through comments cause they‚Äôre long but
---
Scorch beasts turn things into scorched with their acid rain thing
---
You can be fighting normal mobs, SB comes, gas rains the area, they instantly turn into *scorched-(placeholder name)*
---
Also, there was a group that found the lair if you do the BoS steel quest line
---
They tried to finish the SB menace, got dead after discovering someone engineered those fucker bats
---
Yep, happened to my wife last night. On a related note, we're both crashing to desktop now pretty regularly after the latest patch.
---
I‚Äôd suggest adding full set stats.
---
mind your business.
---
I am now furious over the disease cures and antibiotics I have wasted 
---
Killed her for 10 times and haven't drop anything yet....
---
I really think you might be doing a bit more with those ghouls then just bashing their skulls in .... but not judging ... if it helps you get your freak on. 
---
Scorched beasts need to automatically be legendary... Those things are a pain in the ass... We deserve better loot. Lol
---
You get a mutation just by killing things?
---
There's the obligatory "Witcher 3 did it better". 
---
Wouldn't be a thread about a game (any game) without one 
---
I'm almost sure it is. I've always been able to tie it to a lagging server
---
Can confirm from members of my playing group, character wipes have been happening.  It appears as if it is relatively nonsensical at the moment.  One person I know was wiped and another wasn‚Äôt.  Both had over a million of some items (I‚Äôve played with people who dupe before... sue me).  
---
Basically it seems sporadic rn.  Likely will continue to see wipes in the coming days as Bethesda gets their shit together 
---
no worries but thanks for the heads up, I have xbox app on my phone so a message there later would probably get my attention the quickest
---
You will also need Vault blue paint, and a working mic so you can scream "FOR THE EMPEROR" when you're about to land and facestomp.
---
I'm lvl 115ish and realized the other day I haven't explored the entire upper left or upper right, or bottom middle of the map...
---
This happens to me everytime but my gf on same internet rarely sees it.
---
&gt;&gt;Living witnesses are not confirmed.   
---
[Oh no! They got ‚Äòem :(](https://youtu.be/mUj88_aPNkg)
---
You can go to the chemistry table and there is a "bulk" option.
---
It uses some plastic to bulk up junk. For some junk items it could reduce weight. You can also sell bulked junk to vendors.
---
Two shot, explosive Dragon with 250 resistance while reloading. Dropped for me two weeks ago in a white springs nuke zone. With my current build it does 1600 damage per shot. Just rediculous. 
---
I find it hard to believe if you loved fallout 4 you wouldn't like this, I honestly love it and can't go back to FO4 after sinking countless hours in. I personally love it and playing solo, just it's boring, but there are things to keep and keep you preoccupied .. I think it does get better as you get more creative .. personally I loved it from the moment I started playing.
---
Because of the lack of social cues. The specific scenario being an exaggeration for a point
---
It's like if I told a story about a traffic accident and said there were 100 firefighters on the scene.
---
It is dumb but it‚Äôs necessary if you wanna have a combat centric character and not pay an arm a leg and 3 newborn children for maintaining your gear and base
---
&gt;ALL SALES APPROVED BY SUBREDDIT MODERATORS\*
---
\*No they haven't
---
They will but I want to keep my camp locked so I use the terminal. It also looks cooler walking in
---
98% of all tse weapons are duped... You just bought a duped one. But the possible duper just got 11k
---
At base model, Super Sledge can be modded to do higher damage than Grognak's Axe.
---
Division 2 is 2 month away from release, anthem is coming next month. A borderlands 3 reveal can be expected at any time, may see it' s full release in 2019. In terms of loot mechanics division and borderlands are worlds apart from fo76, offering better motivation. Endgame is always a matter of personal preference, but i think both are better than fo76s endgame, or it's lack of any.
---
Loosing all gear, maybe levels, quests and plans too, because bgs couldn't find any other way to fix their game? No thanks!
---
wow is that throughout your fallout "career" or is that recently? I've never had a problem, except the infinite load bug a few times, until now and I'm around level 100.
---
That happened to my All Rise. :C
---
Selling duped items for real money on reddit, nice try.
---
You're trying to sell duped items for real cash on the reddit? Its like you're asking to be banned 
---
but i need to be able to use my trio of tesla traps to get uninvited house guests out
---
Lol cuck. No one said it's unplayable. It's still playable asshole but go ahead and keep bitching man. no one cares lol. Ohh no bad words. Someone's fucking salty. I'm glad you wasted your money. Shits hilarious really
---
Tse? What? I‚Äôm talking about mutations 
---
Dupers stash I'd say
---
This is really nice!! I like the overall look and feel. Great job.
---
PS4 patch is still in B.E.T.A. 
---
Dupers use that location often they probably just left the server at that time you found it
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs if there‚Äôs not enough space between you and another object its wierd. I had to put all my stuff in one row to fix it and space em out.
---
Good luck I never seem to get any mods.
---
I normally buy mine for 250-500 
---
Multiple people have reported this issue consistently. I have personally experienced 40% health loss from slap damage when I was low level (mid 20s) from a moron dumping grenades on me while I was trading with a vendor bot.
---
Theres theres a handgul you cant get into, this one is number 2 i thi k slightly inland a bit from the destroyed building
---
I disagree with phantom weight one I lost all my water puriefers and fusion generators recently and I'm still at full capacity yet they arnt there
---
They're basically just ignoring you - happens quite a bit at lower levels, but less and less as you gain levels.  
---
No I'm sorry. I'm on another post that this guy payed 12k for a tse handmade. Wrong post
---
Well all indications are that the respec system wasn't simply missing or broken, but intentionally left out. They may have simply intended people to make multiple characters and perk them out differently (how people did most fallouts, different playthroughs different playstyles).
---
I find the swappable perks actually makes the game less engaging for me and my friends. It seems the option is to incessantly micromanage perks to get the 'full' experience, or to basically roll with the same perks all the time except for crafting, and just know that there's all this content you're not going to do because the game has made it so tedious you'd rather not play that part of the game than engage with it.
---
It's just odd because if it were a locked-in trade-off system ala nv, 3 etc, at least you understand and accept going into it that you'll just have to make sacrifices to get your ideal gameplay, and different people specializing in different things is at least meaningful because you can't possibly do everything at any time. Now we're just in this weird limbo where technically everybody can do everything but the game has made it so tedious for the majority of players that they just don't, but you have the knowledge that you can so it's just resentful.
---
I think they should go with the fallout 4 style or the 'classic' fallout style; but choose one. Menu management in an online game like this is only a hindrance.
---
The shop is full of copies and forgeries.
---
Just come on out to real fake doors...
---
Vampire mole miner gauntlet, for I am Weapon X.
---
I do not believe I'm exaggerating when I say that half the containers I unlock have nothing in it.
---
So, how did they send you messages? 
---
Every patch someone has this perception. 
---
I don't think they'd stealth change something like that
---
To be that guy,
---
I love lock picking as a minigame, but, after 10000 safes and doors later... when is the force lock with a higher chance of breaking the lock pick going to be added? 
---
I think there was an option in the elder scrolls series and in Fallout 3... right?
---
This technically wouldn't work if you're able to consistently switch perks.
---
You my sir, are a terrible person. And I love you.
---
Looking like a wrinkly penis demon with teeth uhhhh. 
---
You have recovered from Rad Worms.
---
You have contracted Rad Worms.
---
Luck just affects the condition. I hear Charisma does have a factor in what legendary you get but I don't know the mechanics behind it.
---
Aww man, I've been looking for Anorexic Todd for three weeks!
---
That's an issue with camp budget, not carry weight. I didn't include that because I think it's an issue that Bethesda is still actively working on. There's also a bug with stored camp items being duplicated, and while I remember reading in some patch notes that it was fixed, I still had it occur just a few days ago. I chose to focus on the issues that are done and that we have at least some evidence for
---
I left a bunch of stuff there once too.
---
Not 20 bulks but a lot. Happens. :)
---
You had a CTD?  I had a spontaneous reset.  Only once, but man my wife thought I'd stabbed myself from all the profanity she heard coming from my corner of the living room.
---
Two possibilities I‚Äôd say-  
---
1. Dupers (most likely)  
---
2. Someone trying to transfer items between characters. I don‚Äôt use this location but that‚Äôs how I transfer stuff between my characters without help.
---
Diablo III has that kind of content.
---
Really any kind of stair that works on interiors besides the one metal type would be great
---
You need to get a lot of rads quick. That's how you become mutated. Stand on a rad barrel until your almost dead and you should gain one. Problem is you can't choose which you get and there are a few bad ones.
---
Same for me. Pre-patch the problem was server disconnects. Now it's CTDs. Not sure I prefer either.
---
I don‚Äôt think all areas are like that but I‚Äôve definitely seen it at the White Spring. I‚Äôve fought lvl 20 ghouls and then lvl 60s. Lol
---
Sharing our own photos to others is wayy more complex than you might realise and is a massive vector for abuse, unfortunately
---
this is stupid. is there a reason I shouldnt think this is stupid? 
---
I only knew it existed because I've found like 15 of the mod that makes it be on fire. Still never seen the actual weapon though. 
---
Enemy AC-130 incoming
---
Yup made a post about it last night. It was pretty interesting.
---
I had 8 crashes in 23 mins on Xbox one after the patch,so idk wtf happened but I can't even play! 
---
I sell serums on xbox for 200 each. Even on PC the highest prices are only 500 each 
---
The Petrified: In a way it's the final stage of the scorched disease.
---
WV didn't got directly hit by a nuke so there was still a lot of survivors for many years after the bombs fell.
---
Scorched disease origin: It's the Ultracite research that is responsible for it, same with the appearance of Scorchbeasts. Also the FEV source is not the Ultracite.
---
A Super Sledge with the sharpened heated mod at full slugger perks, incision, martial artist does around 300+ damage per shot.
---
Add instigating (double damage if enemy is full health), +40% power attacks, +30% damage vs Scorched and you have yourself a 1-2 shotter against every mob in the game except Scorch beasts (needs 3-4 hits) and Scorch Queens.
---
I guess I should have used /s after the first sentence. I'm sorry. I thought the sarcasm there was more obvious than it came across. 
---
I actually agree with you, and I upvoted you. Also not the person you originally replied to. 
---
I do like the not so subtle nod by using moonshiners shack though
---
This is why I ask for sources in almost every new bug, exploit, complaint thread.
---
I think I read awhile ago to go tame something real small and it should replace the previous creature.
---
Yah I've had a crazy high amount also, just 3 of those were right after deaths losing any junk I built up when getting dced not dead.
---
If the PVP was integrated into the PVE in a meaningful way I'd agree.  But whether they intended for a deeper PVEVP experience (which is hard to get right, Division tried with its Dark Zone, but figured it out a bit better with its Survival mode), or they crammed PVP in because they just wanted to appeal to an additional audience, doesn't change what the end result is.  Which is a PVE game with a barebones PVP experience that itself is boring because most players are more interested in what the game actually is.
---
We're boring to them, sure.  But we're playing the game.  They're playing some other game that was never fully fleshed out, and for some reason was forced to coexist with ours.  Maybe it was even a budget decision, they just didn't want to run two separate servers or something.  I dunno what their setup is, if servers can be launched as needed or if they just have a set number running.
---
But yeah, give us PVE and PVP servers, get PVP players meeting up with each other, bam.  No boredom for them, no griefing for us.  We all get what we want without frustrating or disappointing each other.  Everybody wins.
---
How is that build?  I might make an alt that way, always loved unarmed but it rarely works besides new vegas.
---
So you saying I can get my sledge slinging and sulphur shrub down all in one place! Thank you for this!!!!!
---
Suck a dick
---
Most guns can pick up armor penetration in two slots: magazine and receiver.  Usually you won't use the receiver, but you will use the magazine.  The receiver mod is 40%.
---
Rifles get a perk that penetrates armor at 36%.  Power armor has a perk that penetrates armor at 45%.  Shotguns and Pistols get left out, but that's definitely not most of the guns.
---
It wouldn't make sense. Realistically there's probably not room for most armors. Maybe a hazmat suit or some underarmor but that's about it.
---
Those aren't allowed for balance reasons, and probably because it would be more complicated (if not impossible) to design it to allow some armors but not others. So it just unequips everything.
---
Yes mate, that is how I understand it too.
---
I‚Äôve seen that weird loot thing happen on legendaries.  I‚Äôll see loot for a moment then gone.
---
&gt;hunkered down to try and stop it.
---
That's not a real strategy or plan. Any commander worth his salt would know he is throwing men away.
---
Why did they even fortify Defiance with laser grids? To protect a few holo tapes? There is almost nothing up there on the top floor. Their best tech is the last remaining missile turret.
---
Then the Quest automatically rewards you with under armour and scribe gear. If you entirely removed BoS from 76 would it make a difference?
---
This would make me soooo happy. I put alot into workshops and it ruins it for me when I get dropped... To the point im done playing for that day. Having a team helps getcha back in but the server doesnt feel the same after a disconnect.
---
Editing save files is like buying duped weapons, your choice. Personally to me its like cheating and spoils the overall feel of the game and Im not proud of my efforts at the end. So, I dont do it.
---
Hosting a personal server would be great, I dont interact with other players, I dont trade other than sell chems and if a mate wants to play we can coop in peace without dupers, white knights and asshats who are bored after 300 hours of playing and need to enhance their e-peenie by destroying camps or greifing. 
---
Sorry, but I dont see " This game is all about grinding legendaries". I see a game about exploring, surviving, reading notes, listening to holotapes, following the missions and having fun with a mate. I dont play to grind uber weapons, I play to enjoy myself and have fun. By the time I get to the stage of it feeling like a grind then I know its time to go play something else.
---
do you mean legendary stats ? i currently have a full set of unyielding and I can add them on
---
This is were bethesda failed, if they launched the game into a "Beta" state, even if they asked for money nobody would care about the bugs, etc.
