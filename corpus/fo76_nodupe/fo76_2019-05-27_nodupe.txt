I only lock my resource node. Everything else including water is fair game. I dont get it either.
---
---
---
People can take water from the purifiers if they're not locked. I can see why some people wouldn't want that.
---

---
People who lock every single door in their camp are the ones I can't understand. Especially when people spawn inside of a locked room when they FT to the camp and have to FT somewhere else to get out.
---
Then a passionate sigh. Ahhhh. 
---
Finally got that armor repaired.
---
Funny enough i usually get stuck inside those locked houses when i travel there. Well i'm nit gonna travel to you again,customer lost.
---
I've tamed a mega sloth after the patch. my deathclaw died while in the process of replacing i settled for the sloth until i found my new deathclaw that is currently at my base.
---
You might have encountered the "hulking" Mega sloth that spawns with two babies this is not a tameable pet.
---
Also sometimes the tame option doesn't kick in right away you literally have to run up to them to get the tame option to pop up.
---
If your on ps4 I can make you one if you can source the materials
---
Jesus lmao. 
---
Well, I don’t have a Decon shower up, and a fusion generator isn’t too tough to build, so I’d recover easily enough.
---
what is pp
---
Wolves spawn on the hillside west of Widow’s Perch (the quest An Ounce Of Prevention sends you there). But you should bring them further south or it won’t count as being in the Ash Heap.
---
Darillon, I found one just west of Garrahan Mining HQ, but I had to drag it back west so it would register as being in the Ash Heap. (Also cool, now I know the French word for Stingwing!)
---
Ixodes, I have no clue, I don’t think I’ve ever seen one in the Ash Heap.
---
I have been looking. never found the right one. (pc)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Have been looking on pc for a good 3\* Railway rifle like i have seen someone get.
---
or a instigating rifle for long distance sniping.
---
Somehow never find any. Though now that I can inspect without user being close I have higher hopes... but All i find is junkie stuff, or beserker, or asassains...
---
Great, I rarely use chems and cure myself quickly. I like armour, and I don't pvp.
---
Do you mean death rooms? I love those.
---
1400
---
Then one thing to keep in mind is weapon boosts go 10% then 5/5.  Arguable what good that extra 30% gets you for 6 pts (3 x2) versus 30% for 3 pts (3x1) and spreading those spare 6 points into utility elsewhere (such as making that difference up with adrenaline and gun fu damage boosts).
---
Perception is really the killer in this because high perception is great pistol or rifle but useless for melee (and shotgun and heavy one could say).  When you trim out the rifle damage perks you’re left with a bunch of points without much of a home.
---
Perhaps shoot for 9 str/perception (conc fire, tank killer, then 1x each rifle damage) and build around that same concept for melee, with str enough for 1x each damage then 3 for incisor and martial artist.
---
Perhaps a spread like this, with a mess of mutations!

Blood stains or warnings ala Dark Souls could be really fun. And since I on PC let me put in that I want to sell 1000 of something not play with a dumb arrow.
---
**Truth.**
---
has anybody ever tried to lay a  minefield of nuke/plasma mines with a full team to see if as soon as the Squatch comes out it its already toast?
---
We need the loading screens to reflect the amount of time needed to load the area. Otherwise we will just spawn under the mat itself.
---
Difference being Titanfall 2 was a loved game and Apex was a really optimized and good looking game with little to no server issues at launch. 76 on the other hand is pretty poorly optimized in most areas, was a complete joke to a lot of people when it launched, and has crazy amount of lag both fps and connection wise. If they can fix those issues it might take off but otherwise I highly doubt it

I think that you can learn the plans by scraping circuit boards and other electronics.
---
I think that you can learn the eyebot helmet, sentry bot and assaultron helmets this way
---
You might need to

Would like to know too....
---
Shit.
---
I should've sold my diffuser plans :(
---
It is a Tadpole quest. He is suppose to give quest to get possum I think.
---
I'm on PC
---
I got it last night, all 3 survived.
---
How much are the plans worth?
---
I got that once, ran out of defiance by an ant. Melee did nothing for me, eventually got him down to zero with my shotgun, he just gave me a look and regened his health full.  
---
Its a bug (and I don't mean because it was an ant) from what I remember. I forget the details.
---
Oh gotcha ok you'll see them soon then! I use a plasma gatling that uses plasma cores so I'm usually looking for those haha
---
Level 215 and you never tried the real end game? What do you do on adventure mode? PLant corn?
---
Radx should help a bunch.
---
 if you have 200+ rad resist on your armor you don't take much rad damage at all.
---
I did not. Perhaps I shall chance upon it in the future.
---
No

---
&gt;(Added May 9) Repair: Repairing an item beyond 100% Condition no longer incorrectly provides an increase to some stats.
---
&gt;Dev Note: Condition should only affect how long an item lasts before it needs to be repaired. We found that overrepairing items resulted in small buffs to certain character stats, which was not intended. This was not originally noted during our initial patch notes process, but has been now added to the patch notes for clarity.
---
Except for Parqsites and Dysentry I hate those 2
---
I have a medic 3\* railway rifle, that does Vats crit chance, crit heal, crit recharge. I'm on PC if you want to setup a meet.
---
You can also browse through the Fallout 76 Market reddit and hop onto some of the Fallout 76 Discords to ask around for legendaries.
---
Otherwise just visit all the camps on your server, then server hop once in a while and visit the camps there.
---
My buddy is OCD and he started locking certain doors because people are evidently born in barns and can't close the doors behind them. He has a bad ass base and having all the doors open dosen't jive with his feng shui.
---
Then don't do them? They are entirely optional, and intended to provide a challenge with the reward being their real money currency. 
---
To me, this kind of post reeks of the entitlement that's plagued this game since release. If the challenges are too easy, Atom purchases go down. Like it or not, they released an online game with easily 40-60 hours of story, so any additional content that we get either needs to be payed for up front, or funded by atom sales. Also, if currency doesn't do well because of that,  development times for DLC are increased, as well as lower the amount of content that gets released. I'll concede that some challenges are either broken or probably a little harder than they need to be, but the hyperbole you use to describe this is extreme at its best.  
---
The idea they owe you their currency because you payed 60$, when they've been so upfront about how they're giving you free dlc, it just feels disgusting you'd complain that they're not just giving you free shit.
---
Assuming that when u say armor boost you mean it gets repaired above 100%. Unyielding has no effect to that. U would have to put on the perk white knight for that to happen. Unyielding raising your intelligence would only be relevant when you are crafting a new item. Not repairing one you already have. Also if you got rid of all your mutations there are like 2 or 3 different mutations that give u quite a bit of energy and damage resistance.
---
Thank you. That kind of sucks but understandable.
---
I got Brown, White clean and Green from those bunks
---
You would deny others this?
---
Them doing all that has nothing to do with your headset tho an easy fix would be to grab your headset and say "quit chewing into the mic" unless of course they reply with a roast on your voice
---
My water is precious. My house is open to all Cept my bedroom.
---
mine uses pressure plates and powered doors, no left open doors for me
---
What does any of that have to do with Unyielding?
---
Dumb
---
On Xbox? I need a gamma gun
---
Yeah so did I. Also blue from the bench in the bathroom by the showers and pink from on of the bunks
---
Yeah I must be lucky too because it's rare for me.
---
I didn’t know this so basically when you repair to 200 you don’t get the little extra damage from guns now?
---
I'm on ps4 and Ive been disconnected in 3 of the last 5 nuke zones but that's about it.  Everything else is really good.
---
I've had maybe 10-12 server issues since B.E.T.A on an OG PS4.
---
Is it still going on?
---
So you can deconstruct the structure and it shouldn't scrap everything. It should store the items individually to allow you to remake your camp, albeit not exactly the same. 
---
I move camps alot lol

The only thing that i've seen less active is the "Encryptid" event for the Imposter SheepSquatch, but that's player controlled when it starts rather than just appearing randomly. Everything else seems pretty active from my point of view.
---
Dang I’m on Xbox
---
Annoy you enough to the point of getting pissed, taking a shot at them and letting the party begin.
---
You can tame pets in 76?
---
I have 4 player kills in 600+ hours. First one was for the kill a wanted player trophy. Other 3 were griefers. Now that they've gotten rid of both the slap damage and camp damage I don't see a fifth kill coming any time soon, if ever.
---
Well then they'd have to transfer all screenshots instantly to their servers (and even them it would be possible to intercept and modify it, but considerably harder for normal people) which would mean image server costs, image limits, an API to access, download and share images, complaints that the image isn't clear enough and that it's their fault to manage (compression does weird stuff sometimes) and for what? To display an image to 12 people in a game, but only when you play. Oh, and players will expect their image to be there after a 14 month hiatus, so the image server only grows and grows.
---
And you can get killed by a piece of cloth, raw fertilizer or springs
---
Guy who helped me out jumped off a small cliff until he was hurt enough for me to aid him
---
yes i have a mirelurk king his name is steve
---
Seems like most people are haha.
---
Platform?
---
Yes, they will protect you camp as well.
---
I did free range by myself in the mire once at level 60. I had hoped more people would come. 🤷‍♀️ oh well at least I lived and took down the squatch, even if the poor cows bought it.
---
Thank you for the info!
---
Honestly I would sell aid items for like 5 and 1 star for 100 2 star for 300 3 star for 500 (depending on the stats of course) because once you have everything you need caps don't matter
---
Oh I know what you’re talking about now
---
Hahah i guess i was far too patient and they were far too determined
---
Personally I feel that fallout doesn't have the right combat system for a battle Royale. When playing 76, half the shots I make don't even register as a hit or they just fly off to the side which doesn't even make sense.
---
Should've been clearer. I only stepped out of the suit. Walking away for only those 30 secs of server issues.
---
Yes it starts at 9:30 est
---
Go to the teapot area. And try server hopping in survival mode.
---
Wow three attempts and you didn’t get something amazing, that is some BS.  You sir have the fortitude of a giant, I would have abandoned ship after the second try.
---
I had a legit TSE pistol after beta. When TSE got nerfed, I created a character based on melee. I would be very let down if melee was nerfed. I have built my whole setup based on killing Super Mutants in West Tek. I need no Power Suit. I carry a Vampire pole hook with the extra hook mod, run adrenaline, twisted muscles, have a full set of Mutant Slayer armor, etc. My camp and store is there. Its kinda my thing. I have always loved killing SMs. I am level 161 and grinding hard with over 650 hours in the game. Its my relaxation. Don't take it from me Bethesda. Please.
---
Or what happened to me last night. First time beating the queen and got the Decontamination Shower plans and some others. Learned them from the Notes tab and they disappeared but nothing show on the screen that I learned them and build mode says I need to learn the plans still.
---
Try Colonel Kelly's monument in the Toxic Valley. It spawns there all the time. The body will be on a bench, at the top. I jumped servers  twice before I got it. My hubby got it first try.

---
battle royale would actually fit the theme of fallout pretty well, no idea how they would handle the spawns though
---
Yes, this is needed badly.
---
Every broken down junk item should be bulkable too, screws, waste antiseptic, silver, gold etc
---
trueee
---
Exactly. I'm just glad, for the most part, they're few and far between.
---
I lock my water, as I use it for crafting chems and selling to vendors each day - I want there to be water in the system when I need it.
---
But my house is open to the public - the rad shower, work benches, stash boxes, etc are all there for your convenience
---
If you see a green fire enemy, make sure it has stars next to it's name before you shoot it, otherwise the corpse will fail to drop a legendary for you.  It doesn't matter if you don't kill it outright.  If your first shot lands before it has a chance to fully spawn, you will get no legendary item.  When people complain that the SBQ or Free Range Sheepsquatch didn't drop anything for them, it's because they went crazy too early and hit them when they were coming out of the ground.
---
Guns never did, only melee, which, I assume, is why it was ‘fixed’
---
Thank you so much.  I never realized I was playing the game wrong!
---
So true 😂
---
Fuck yes.
---
Yea that's a hot pile of bullshit buddy. A ping of 10ms? do you live INSIDE an amazon server? I'ts not impossible but from everything you've said it sounds more like you just either lied or tested your ping and assumed that's the same as the ping between you and fallout 76, which isn't how that works. It's frustrating because you can't rule shit out when *you don't understand how it works in the first place*.  
---
&gt;  everything else works perfect. 
---
How would you even know? You don't provide any reasonable information, you're defensive and obviously ignorant to how things work.  
---
Also, part of my point is that even IF its not you're internet, your acting like a jackass to people you've decided to either reach out for help to, or complain to. Its distasteful and frankly pathetic.
---
OK. Simple solution. Connect your controller up to your Xbox or PS4 via cable. Use a rubber band on the left stick (wrap it around the stick itself and then wind it underneath to loop over the palm rest/grip).  NB: Make sure you are in your locked CAMP so that no one can get in and let anything in to kill you.
---
No need to worry about timing out. I have run for 4 hours like this. (Yes, I was very hungry and thirsty when I returned ... but not dead).
---
If you are on PC, I am sorry but I can't help you except ... hire a lacky.
---
r/ironicusername
---
wow a logical suggestion
---
If on xbox, hmu bout them shells lol
---
IDK, can you give an example?
---
I love Steve
---
The Legendary Vendor - hope for the best - prepare for the worst.
---
On average 2/3 or 3/4 of the drops from LV will be sadly lacking - but occasionally  you will get something decent ( sometimes).
---
Please excuse my ignorance - what type of build do you run that makes use of 15 endurance? Genuinely curious
---
I feel like it would be fun if I had a restricted server where I gradually got to know everyone and could form some connections.  And text chat.
---
Now, I randomly see people and I have no voice chat so I can wave and go about my own business.  And most likely will never see that person again.
---
If you’ve played for 700 hours you got your money’s worth.
---
With all my mutations I run out of food and drink in like 15 minutes of moving.  So lately I have been equipping the perk that slows down hunger and thirst while in Camp and this way I can usually last a couple hours without a top off.  I thought about doing exactly what you say but I would be dead before I came back to check on myself. :-)
---
It’s a glitch that happens after nukes sometimes. I’m hoping it happens to me again, those weapons and Armor are great gifts for fresh vault dwellers straight out of the vault.
---
sitting in a chair/sleeping in a bed increases your AFK timer by 25% according to a previous patch notes, use happy camper to reduce hunger and thirst drain
---
I prefer efficient/inefficient as opposed to right or wrong.  In the end - sure you can do whatever you want. Its your game. But there is still efficient ways of doing thing and inefficient. I dont hate you for doing things inefficiently, but I'm ok if someone points it out(the same if I am doing something inefficiently).  Then again - my idea of fun in a game like this is doing X as efficiently as possible(partly why i quit so often because the game mechanics for ages made it hard to do the thing the most obvious and efficient way). Everyone doesnt have the same idea of fun though so your point is taken sir!.
---
Depends on rewards. I’d be fine with it if there was a way to slot in, have fun for a bit, then drop back out. 
---
Chiefly, I also don’t want to see it become a thing where you’re freaking camp gets totaled. That’s half the reason I don’t do survival on one of my characters ... I spent too long on that fucking camp and don’t want to have to rebuild it constantly. 
---
So a camp-is-rebuilt-automatically or damage-doesn’t-carry-over and I can jump in and have some fun, I’d be down for.
---
I'll have to mess around with that idea. I haven't had a chance to deal with mutations yet though. Tend to get distracted by other things rather than focus on nukes and mutations.
---
I would say when the game first came out it wasn't that i got kicked but the game with just crash. (XB1).  As time has gone on, and new patches have come out, things have gotten better. 
---
Also when duping was super widespread I could tell because you get the server is not responding messages and you'd look at the map and see two or three people huddled one spot with one being like level hundred and ten in the other two levels two and three. Got kicked a couple times because of that but I think it's because the server itself crashed.
---
Yep, that's exactly what I do. I have happy camper maxed out and I cough a park bench setup viewing my vendor booths.
---
Really appreciate the work put into this. Has finally given me something to do besides player and vender bot jumping. A lot of rhen are really close together so it stops me from always fast traveling and gets me to finally look at the scenery again like when I first started playing.
---
Hey man since you're quitting, I was wondering if I could have your stuff. You can keep the gamma gun tho
---
Do you use rad away often because that increases chance of disease.
---
Soloing the radstag room isn't too difficult, if you don't get cucked by a low spawnrate. Will finish event with only 1/3 friendlies alive though :\
---
Should be a way we can get rid of extra cards or once you fully rank up the extra cards are automatically removed and replaced with new cards
---
In the audio section of the settings check that the chat volume slider is to the right. For me it always gets set to the left (off) its an annoying bug
---
I just want someone to sell a Handmade suppressor mod. No matter how many Handmades I make and scrap, I can't get that damn mod. 
---
Bethesda's made too many things "gamey" instead of realistic.
---
Are you a bloody or berserk build? Because it's impossible to 1hit a player from melee regardless of damage done.
---
Yes but the event isn’t meant for 1 animal to survive.  It’s challenging and meant for a large group of people.  If you want 100 bear arms and 75 lab coats by all means lol.
---
You can't kill a few bugs?
---
Stop telling people that their opinion of how you play the game is wrong.
---
I'm 30+ hours in and I haven't killed anyone. I've been killed by someone twice because I became wanted for I've been stealing purified water from other people's camps. One player didn't want to kill me but I'd be wanted anyway so I talked him to "put me out of my misery".
---
For me its not worth trying. Because my game will crash towards the end of the event about 70% of the time. Very frustrating.
---
My apologies, may be exaggerating a bit. But it doesn’t take much for them to take me down. Maybe 1 good one to damage me pretty bad, and another or two to completely kill me. 
---
Not super familiar with what a bloody or berserk build is tbh
---
Ah Watoga! It’s like Australia. Everything there is just an arsehole with teeth and everything...
---
EV - ER - Y - THING wants to kill you 😣
---
The game steals stuff all the time. I posted about the same thing a while back. 
---
Go to the raider camp at the very top of the map, on the left hand side, there is a chance of finding a level 15 raider power armor. Also try Clarksville. 
---
If any of these dont have the pieces you need just jump servers untill you find it. Don't  take any of the pieces you dont need though as this will mess with the drop on your next jump. 
---
If you get stuck add me and I'll help you find it. -Kung-Foo-Kitteh.
---
Put them in a commonly known spot. Watoga luggage or WS ice chest at the golf course. Pretty simple and already well known
---
In game settings? It’s set around 80%. Should it be the whole way right?
---
... Go on.
---
Can confirm i scrapped that stuff and got my plan for the sentry bot helmet
---
Is that the In-game settings? It’s set around 80%. Should it be the whole way right?
---
pricing really depends on the buyer, I have a 1\* 2 shot pump shotgun for sale for 350 caps i'll never use it so seems good to me. now if i seen a 1\* 2 shot combat rifle for 650 caps i wouldn't think twice about garbing it. I had a guy last week buy 30 magazines from me at 100 caps each haven't sold 1 since, now I have 2 machines full at 40 caps each just to move them.
---
Well I'm sorry for your losses. F *moment of silence*
---
Yea, in game settings. If its at 80% it should be good cause its just the chat volume. maybe try changing the thing above to say ‘area’ if it  isnt already
---
My melee character either has radworms or glowing pustules non-stop.  The only diseases I bother getting rid of anymore are dysentery, parasites and blood worms.  I also get rid of rattle hands immediately if I'm playing my sniper, but that's a rare one.
---
My sniper usually gets glowing pustules in that one 2 story building at the Whitespring, when I'm downstairs from the Glowing One that lives in the bathroom.  I guess his stink is so pungent that it seeps through the floor.  I sneak into the room with the bar and immediately get glowing pustules.  
---
Diseased Scorchbeast lands.  Boom....  I now have The Blight.
---
I think it would be cool if it was like gladiatorial combat
---
It's ok buddy, we're all hypocrites
---
I've learned not to build on ledges anymore. After building on two separate places I fall off the cliff or through the map when I spawn.
---
I teleport under the map in mine
---
That's Op's point, is the Trade for Trade or max cap sales don't really properly reflect value, or help the majority of the player base.
---
Any bloodied weapon with armor piercing mods and perks
---
100% agreed
---
Your vendor store?
---
... you can name them???
---
Walking there from gauly mine works for me.
---
I just ignore the Trading discords and reddits now because its so often Trade only. It sucks but honestly there are a lot of either dupers or real money vendors in these places, and I'd rather just play the game without them anyway.  
---
Honestly, it only matters for PvP, which is a shitfest anyway.
---
Oh shit, armorsmith will double the ammo you craft? Fuuuuck, I need that.
---
I live in the top of a tower you can't get into w/o jetpacks. Not a store kinda guy lol
---
Yeee
---
I have it set on area. It used be set on auto but some donkey was blaring metal through his mic and he was the far side of the map so blocked him and set to area
---
Yeah I've gotten nothing but crap rolls but it's for a chance at legendary gear you want. There are some players that might want that gamma gun. Every player wants something different. Not to mention you can easily get non legendary weapons and if it was super easy to get the legendary ones then what's the point? Using a legendary vendor doesn't mean you're automatically entitled to God rolls
---
I get maybe 1 bump in a week, but it’s just to the Main Menu.
---
I used to get locked out and bumped more.  When it started locking up my PC i just reinstalled Windows and haven’t had the issue since.
---
It may have been removed. Some of the items are only temporarily available.
---
Hopefully things get better soon enough. It's hard to find things at times and sell when you want to buy stuff.
---
Stingwings can spawn at Nicholson's End near Beckley. I saw them there once before, although the location can also spawn various other enemies instead.
---
How do you quickly change worlds? I always exit to main menu, is there a faster way?
---
Best response ^
---
I don’t know then, i seems to not work sometimes for some people.
---
Happy cake day!
---
that depends on who it is and probably how their day has gone.
---
I know someone who used to go on PVP MMO servers to troll people when his boss gave him hell during the day. He would group with someone in customer service who did the same when people kept asking stupid questions/entitled attitude.
---
Try clean sweeping and taking everything from blackwater mine then selling it to the nearby whitespring train station vendor.
---
Certain enemies have very high chances to transmit diseases to you, regardless of your disease resistance it seems.  Something like a radroach won't usually transmit anything, but if it's a mole rat, you're getting bone worms when it hits you.  And if it's a glowing mole rat, it doesn't even have to bite you, if you're in its radiation aura, then you'll have a chance to have it transmitted to you too.
---
It's safe to assume the more common, and annoying the creature is, the more likely it is to infect you with something.  That covers ghouls, mole rats, higher-leveled ticks, and stronger insects.
---
Are you using the right suit of power armor? Like for example, is the skin for t60 and you're using t45?
---
I've done this. Lol.
---
Go to nexus mods under fallout 76, grab the high definition map mod, and you will have a very high quality version to print out at poster size at local print shop for a few dollars.
---
The bar itself is under floor decor. The mirror is under wall decor.
---
I do it all the time with my bloodied build 20% health I can sneak right up to the ghouls and either shoot them with my bloodied silenced handmade or use my bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet also a level 2 or 3 sneak makes a bloodied build much more manageable at least for me.
---
Unyielding boosts your intelligence and it used to affect melee damage and armor defense.
---
Bloodied explosive is the new meta
---
The fancy bar is in floor decor, not tables like you would think. Took me a while to find it
---
Well I'm sorry for your losses. F *moment of silence.*

I just read that entire page.

Ah ok. Thank you so much for your help 👏

The only time I use VATS is when I’m shooting molerats and bloatflies. Assholes are fast.

That'd be cool
---
I don't expect a god roll... But 2/3 rolls the worst gun in the game?
---
I go to Harper’s Ferry and kill everything and everyone. I can usually get ~9000 or so caps with all the guns and such I loot.
---
Im not to sure what that is. Ive only hit level 17 before and didnt really know much if u can elaborate? Is it a rocket launcher ? Lol
---
Took me a while to realize there was a Fissure site near Striker's Row, both locations are bit out of the way from the main roads.
---
Become a farmer.

Combining Enforcer, Skeet Shooter, VATS, and a good shotgun modded for accuracy, you can cripple most body parts at close range with one shot. This is the fastest way because Enforcer can proc for each pellet, rather than each shot. 
---
It's especially useful for sheepsquatches, deathclaws, or any other enemy with a lot of HP. Take out their legs and they're toast. A sheepsquatch still has ranged attacks when downed, until you cripple their arms and head. Legendaries will regain limb control when they regen - just cripple them again.
---
For the queen, it can take me 3-5+ shots per limb. Wings first, then wait for her to land so Enforcer doesn't stagger her. Get all of her body parts and she'll stand still for about 45 seconds.
---
There's also One Gun Army for heavy weapon builds, Tormentor for semi-auto rifles, ^and ^Modern ^Renegade ^for ^pistols
---
Scrap military grade circuit boards (possibly assaultron ones too) It was the only ones I got plans from scrapping
---
It's worse trying to find a good weapon than using the legendary vendor.  But given enough time it can be done (or hook up with someone via stream/FB/trading subreddits).
---
I've managed a couple decent heavy weapons, but I spend more time with my shop closed hopping shops at max caps than I do fighting anything.
---
The Ash Heap weekly challenge worked for me, I almost took a picture when they show up on the right side of the camera's interface before taking the picture. If not, dead enemies should also work. I'm using a 105mm Deluxe ProSnap camera so it seems this issue is only affecting some users vs all.
---
I'd suggest the white wolf fedora, one of the tuxedos if you have them, and a legendary cane with +swing speed. Your swagger output will shoot through the roof
---
It was the part where you called me a dick that made me go "wait, what?"
---
Wow that sounds super easy actually thank you!
---
System
---
Are they showing as a team on your display with their health? Cos there's a bug where teams seem to drop for some reason and the best fix is to leave team and start a new one
---
Currently doing this with my level 6... 1000 scrip here we go....
---
Bloodied is a Legendary perk where the lower your health is the weapon does more damage. Explosive means the bullets are also explosive.
---
I will definitely try that thank you!

I don’t have the room I’ve got a cave camp
---
I have my whole camp unlocked except for one door which leads to my basement where my water purifiers are
---
Not sure if woosh
---
If you scrap the blueprint in the camp menu, it just stores everything so you can manually build it again.  
---
Camp building is tricky. The "Floating" error isn't actually something floating generally, its somewhat of a catch all for clipping or placement issues. For whatever reason, the rules for placement when you do it yourself are different for when the game does it for you. I imagine its because of the order of placement not really being in the blueprint, so when it tries to place things that are clipping all at once it creates an issue.  
---
My advice is when you're building your camp, and you're also intend to move it around, you should blue-print it yourself. I generally keep just the structure (No tables or decorations) as a base blueprint in case I need to move. You can also blue-print your camp, then build it in a workshop to see if it will be able to be placed down again. Since workshops use their own resources they can usually build your entire house for free.  
---
My short list of tips if you want a mobile house:  
---
1. don't put wires through things  
---
2.Use conduits from the advanced power section to pull power through walls, it doesn't cause the floating issue when you place walls over them
---
3. make sure everything isn't hugging the walls. Close is fine, but the game has a tendency to let you clip things into the wall that it won't put down. I've found as long as I don't see clipping, and there's a small gap, I have no problems  
---
4. Be careful with posters. They can accidentally be put on objects rather than the walls, and the game doesn't like it.  
---
5. Blueprint in stages, and experiment at workshops.
---
Starvation takes a while. Give it a try.
---
Ohhh okay. So use guns with explosive on it applied with the perk?
---
Are you wearing the uniform? I don't know if that's the problem or not, but I just did the quest  yesterday, and he makes some comment about your uniform in his dialogue.
---
I've been kicked, but very rarely.
---
Integer overflow. An uninitialized integer would have resulted in a compiler error.
---
You can only sell 1400 a day to vendors.
---
That’s what happens when you swipe right on every ghoul on Nuker (The Post Apocalyptic Dating App^TM )
---
Glad to help
---
I hope it was me, lol. Someone's CAMP looked so good and fit so naturally I thought it was a normal structure. Picked a lock and got Wanted. Begged someone to kill me near New River Gorge Bridge after almost half an hour of trying to find other players.
---
People avoided me bc of my Wanted status. More proof people don't want PvP.
---
Make sure you have the key or get yourself into the area southeast of the vendor. That’s where around 13 super mutants spawn. Also on the road on both sides leading to the vendor have around 6-10 supermitants. Unless you have schorched
---
Unyeilding boosts all stats except endurance. Intelligence doesn't effect repair, just condition of stuff you craft.
---
Or maybe its that the game is just crap, from a technical standpoint. Which it factually is.
---
Thanks for all the suggestions. I server hopped on many locations until I finally went to Philippi Battlefield cemetery and it spawned the first time. So now I have it. Thanks again!
---
People are telling others how they SHOULD play the game, because realistically all of these suggestions are correct.
---
If I spawn at someone's camp and cant move, I should probably let them know, especially if they want people to buy things.
---
If someone is using a rad shower in their doorway to their shop.. again.. some wont go through the door.  It's a suggestion that they correct the situation if they intend to sell things.
---
One shotting bosses is a dick move, I cant believe someone actually tried justifying that.
---
Camping outside of the golf course with turrets is a dick move too, and yall are lucky I cant destroy it anymore..
---
Some things need to be said, dont act like these people still dont have a choice after a post is made about their habbits
---
True
---
Relying on random people in games, just like i  life, sucks.
---
I dont even own Anthem. But its telling that you had to reach all the way to that piece of shit to try and find something WORSE to compare this garbage to.
---
A survive the horde mode would be cool
---
I'm totally fine with dying endlessly, so long as I'm not losing caps or stims in the process.  If the battle royale is done the same way a lot of games do it (never played Fortnite), dying is just a minor setback in terms of waiting to respawn.  That seems fine.
---
PTT is already in the game, and muting is also possible
---
Project Paradise. The Artkos event.
---
Remove loot from the boss, make it reward bosses drops only if you complete event. Then you get both the events loot and bosses loot or you get none.
---
No worries.
---
\~It's happened to me since the launch of the Encryptid Event
---
\~Yea, it's annoying..just hope it doesn't happen when I accidentally scrip a main weapon, lol
---
\~It seems to come and go with updates...
---
\~He dies shortly after interacting with him. I was on the hunt for the Hunter's Longcoat, so I never experimented if he would just "drop dead" without interacting (didn't want to lose the chance at it) But he dies a couple minutes after interacting for no reason, as I was holding him, just in case any other players decided to stop by.
---
\~I've seen the "this item needs support" bug in one of the more recent updates and the issue I had with the foundations was new with the recent update...but I had also moved my camp for the first time in over a month.
---
\~Yes, I have to replace every item into all 4 vending machines....especially annoying with the cursor bug staying at the top of the inventory list, on top of stocking 3o items in all 4 machines.  Although, I've hard crashed (CTD) a couple times since the update but my inventory has stayed put in the machines.
---
I’ve had this happen twice maybe three times but it’s just a display error- the best was when it said my workshop was under attack by Sheepsquatches. This was the first day of that patch before I had done the event. I got so excited, but it was actually just scorched (fun display error though :)
---
Exactly.
---
The whole "it's my game, I'll do what I want" argument is trash.
---
Just because it is, doesnt make the fact, that timmy is charging 4k for a combat rifle with no legendaries aspects, and I'm wrong for telling him he should lower the price.
---
People cant handle suggestions, and feel threatened when their told there are other ways, or better ways to play the game.
---
Mine does. https://imgur.com/a/jMzyFRQ
---
(Not using Explosive/Bloodied/Unyielding/Bolstering effects, or any Mutations due to preference.)
---
Tank and Spank.
---
I totally agree - that would be awesome
---
Yup
---
And put an end to the insta-despawn corpses.
---
Thanks! Glad you could use it ^_^
---
Or maybe your setup is crap considering I don't have these problems I think that's probably it.
---
you could do what i do, try to learn every plan in the game you can buy
---
Yeah- put something in a vending machine for 0 caps. People do it all the time. You could even put it all in a specific machine and label that machine ‘free’ if you wanted
---
You’re telling me you don’t want a rolling pin?
---
Dude literally joined Reddit 8 days ago. I bet he gets banned a lot.
---
Damn were were you when i deleted 300 cores....
---
You should start a bank with trusted people and give out loans or sum shit
---
GG Bethesda, making to fudge your pants and ends up making it a good time instead
---
Very mature response. People never lie you’re right
---
Im pretty sure its just gonna be normal fo76 but everywhere is nuked.
---
I know this isn't a solution to the main problem but I found a work around to most camp errors is to close out of build mode and then reopen.
---
Tho I agree this needs to be fixed.
---
No, I don't think I got 1. I went to a Train station, looked at poster. Then went to scout leader talked to him to get tadpole quest. Idk if he gave me 1 though. I haven't gotten the frog habitat either.
---
To add to this.
---
There are 100s of currently used routes and builds people use because they were told it was the best thing to do.  Just like it's best to not be a douchebag and camp outside of the highest farmed location in the game, or sell trash for outrageous prices.
---
If you want to sell things, maybe listen to the guy telling you "wHaT tO DoO"
---
Inhave 4500 shotty ill sell you for 6k
---
Maybe you should make a post bitching to Bethesda oh why they can't work miracles and make it work with whatever wrong on your end.
---
Ok no adding one game mode or two overshadows tons of quests weapons events etc?
---
This.
---
It's my pleasure, glad to hear it!
---
I'm not saying that I'm saying a battle Royale mode is coming and for some people that is taking from possible pve content that could be worked on
---
There's nothing wrong on my end. OR my friends end. The problem is an archaic engine full of spaghetti code made by a bunch of hacks who have no concern for quality because people like you keep buying into their bullshit.
---
Enjoy your big ridden, shit tier game. I have plenty of fun, high quality entertainment options I can turn to, while you help kill a medium people used to love by supporting and defending garbage tier developers.
---
I did that first. I was surprised how many power armor plans there are that most players won't ever use with the current meta.
---
People can pay to save that 5 seconds all they want it literally provides no advantage but convenience 😂
---
Hey you like a smart young handsome investor... Would you like to buy some over priced items?... I mean moderately priced...
---
Your enemies are screwed.
---
...I'd like to see that picture actually
---
10 minutes of loading later..  oh my camp cant load..  shit..  10 minutes of loading later... same lobby.
---
Yes 10 minutes is a little extra, but it is pretty foul, considering the game "loads" before it's actually ready to show you anything.
---
Yea its sad caps have no real use maybe if they added a full respec option where it could cost like 12.5kwe could see real cap usage again
---
I saw a grafton monster all by his lonesome in the ash heap earlier... I was thinking can I get em... then I shot him in his not-face
---
Nope. Its definitely not the setup that runs Witcher 3 with settings cranked. I mean, its a current gen I7 with a 1070 8GB on 100mb internet. But sure, keep blaming consumers for Bethesda's gross incompetence. That'll be sure to get them to improve their next release.
---
To me, the massive success of player vending shows that 76 is largely being played by the PvE type.  Basically everyone on any adventure mode server has machines, and they become pretty damn fun sometimes.
---
This one camp's owner was hanging out in a Mr. Fuzzy suit playing the banjo in his little bandstand, (back when you had to be present for other players to inspect multi-star gear) so I went afk while playing the bass, came back with a fresh glass of iced tea and there was a full jam session happening with slide guitar, banjo, bass and drums.  It sounded just as good as I imagined.  It's a shame there's no added benefit to participating in a jam session other than being well-tuned.  Like, the more players involved, the better the bonus gets, or it lasts longer.
---
I'm more interested in removing the bulks from scrap all.
---
Do you have all the regional plans learned? Do you know how to make all the mutation serums? Do you have all the unique (i.e faschnacht) stuff? If all of that is done, I guess just look for some obscure builds with weapons and armor people are selling. Player vending is a nice cap sink, but it's only going to work in the long term, and those of us with many items are getting way too many caps way too quickly. Being able to pay to skip the reset timer of an event would be amazing
---
[Cutting Edge III]
---
In a room full of scorched and you just fired you're last bullet. What do you do? Grab an empty paint can off the shelf and go to town.
---
^ this.  Team and social menu has been messed up for so long.
---
It's ok someone argued with me that 10c a stimpak was expensive. Mfker vendor offers me 8c. I sure af ain't gonna deal with your ass for a few hundred caps.
---
Nope.. but I would like you to watch south park..
---
You’re not wrong that isn’t what I’m saying but the way it read out to me was it would purely be a trade off that you wanted balanced against the regular receiver (doesn’t necessarily need to be) but it had flat out more dps and better ammo usage and honestly I think the ammo usage alone means it’s has to have lower dps or it’s just gonna be the go to because god damn that thing might as well just spray straight from your lead and steel pool
---
When I saw it on the roadmap that was my initial guess, as well.  Some new way to fight other players seems like kind of a letdown.
---
I know if I had the issue and other people were saying the game was working fine for them but it wasn't for me I'd be trying to figure out what's going on and why mine wasn't working instead of just blaming Bethesda for everything. If you won't even try reinstalling the game then it's pretty hopeless though because that's about the first thing you can do.
---
There are but they reduced the proximity that a player needs to be to trigger them and also just lowered the frequency.
---
So I'd there is a event you want to do you need to travel to the area or near it in hopes it pops if not server hop.
---
I’ve been seeing a lot of comments mentioning the same situation, but from different quests; Free Range, Project Paradise, Campfire Tales, etc. 
---
I think the reason this problem even exists is because of the whole “tagging” feature when it comes to loot drops.  Everyone is forced to almost compete with one another, instead of focusing on the goal in a united manner. 
---
At it’s heart, the game is a looter-shooter (even more-so now that they added the whole legendary scrip/vendor).  With that comes the mentality of one too; I’m here for the loot.  When it’s tied behind personal progression, instead of working as a unit, then you get these kind of outcomes.  
---
In the end, the loot should be tied behind the completion of the event, not the enemies that spawn during it.  I understand that there is a loot reward for completing it, but people want their legendaries and those only come from killing the enemies.  Make it where the success of the team is the success for the player and you would see a lot less of these kind of outcomes during events.
---
Also you dont start a sentence with the word and... thaaannnkkkss
---
It may be but that’s like them throwing someone else a bone and you’re suddenly growling at your owner
---
" Come on we need a 3rd pylon! Uh no, not me. "
---
They'll probably come back again later.  Maybe like a black Friday sale or something.  But no one actually knows
---
Also posted to Bug Roundup 9.5 because it's still happening.
---
Issue: Overlays will cause a CTD.
---
Frequently when a screen is overlaid with a note, letter, lockpicking interface, etc, the game will lock up and crash to desktop.  [b0dhisattvah](https://www.reddit.com/user/b0dhisattvah) has reported it and done some looking into it; it seems to be a scaling issue.  There appears to be no fix at this point.
---
ETA: Issue is discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7643z/does_anyone_else_seem_to_be_crashing_when_they/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsleqf/pc_crashing_give_me_your_dumps/).
---
I've been playing from the beginning and just recently started getting booted from servers. It's really annoying
---
Yeah I agree
---
i've been sworn to secrecy.
---
Just as a word of advice, it would probably help if you looked at the prices of big traders (i.e people with lots of stuff in their machines, all 4 machines stocked) to get a sense of it. One common issue among us is low stash space, meaning we are trying to get rid of something fast rather than get the absolute highest amount of caps possible. If people see prices like that, they will scoff away at something much higher, even if in some theoretical world they would be willing to eventually pay that much. Just observe and learn what's ballpark for these items. I don't know the given situation, but 3k for a 1* seems pretty overpriced unless it's a bloodied lever action rifle or something
---
Perfectly understandable... hope your computer is better.  I've re-posted it over there with a note.  Thanks!
---
Yea, now you have to stash weight to compensate for diseases, even with 3 points invested in the perk.
---
Christ that got boring fast. AND THE TRUMPET, I CAN STILL HEAR IT.
---
Used to cause a boost in the stats. That’s where I’m going with that. Everything but ranged weapons were affected until last patch.
---
I re-posted my entry and this link to the February page so it would not be missed.  Thanks again!
---
Doesn't make the prices wrong, it makes them bad. Higher priced goods sit on the shelf longer by nature.
---
That's how a free market works.
---
The rate is fine as it is. 3* items are MEANT to be rare. With hundreds of thousands of people constantly playing and getting drops, they need to be this rare in order to make sure that god-roll legendaries are actually worth anything. Now with the ability to scrip legendaries and get guaranteed 3* items, it's even easier. My guess is once they roll out 4* and 5* enemies it will become easier to get 3*
---
Last time I checked most of the console players of Division 2 have quit.. not sure I’d use that franchise as an example lmao. Also Division doesn’t have legendaries in the way 76 does. A 3 star max level legendary rifle that takes 15-20 bullets for one enemy (most of use explosive so throw explosive damage in there..) any mythical creature is getting blown to shreds by a few explosive bullets from my Gatling gun..
---
#NO ONE AND I REPEAT NO ONE GOT FALLOUT FOR PVP
---
How do I get the key?
---
Shame thx btw
---
Word.
---
The vendor is limited to 150 script a day, with 3 stars being 100 scrip.
---
That isnt that much, unless you're motivated enough to farm legendaries for 4 hours across 5 characters...
---
That's one 3 star A DAY, with 2 every other day if you MAX the script out.
---
Sometimes events dont even drop legendaries, so how do you expect to get the script to begin with?
---
Making your own food and water is very helpful in FO 76.
---
Called OP the dick. Sorry lol
---
It’s not the worst or the best weapon in the game.  In fact I just sold a furious gamma gun for 1500 caps the other day.  There are people that use them.
---
You went from glass is half empty to glass is utterly destroyed pretty quickly.  Look on the bright side, the odds of you getting another gamma gun are pretty low.
---
The odds are approximately 3,720 to 1.
---
I got a Furious Explosive Handmade and run Demo Expert, I'm wondering how the damage stacks with that.
---
Minutes after I posted this a person had1 for sale in his CAMP, so I'm happy.
---
The only axe you can mod is the fire axe
---
Indeed.  For this reason I feel like travel mats should be possible if placed on dirt or stone. Theres no additional load time needed and everyone has dirt/stone somewhere in their camp that can easily access their place.
---
Or just remove the daily scrip cap? I'm sure it'd do the servers good with all the gambling addicts buying up every legendary item in the game to grind up at a loss. As it stands I still have to stop playing, and try to sell off legendaries to players after just a few hours of playing.
---
Bought like 8 items or so, all level 5. So looks like its fixed?
---
I'm buying anyway, simply because I hope that someday they will allow us to make standalone mods.
---
Once that happens... it would be a game changer... as I want to be able to sell excavator calibrated shocks, without dedicating 14pounds per leg to having them for sale. (And thats assuming that its the right level for the buyer, with mods being makeable, people can buy and upgrade at will.)
---
I have like 6.....waiting for them to allow is to sell or trade them.
---
nope this is right you must know the mods to see them. make a few dozen (hundreds) of them and scrap them to learn the mods....
---
ah
---
Hahahahaha you win
---
Like with the big bold text on screen for Imposter..
---
Or just fill a bottle
---
I guess I am one of few people excited for the possibility of a fallout 76 battle royale mode. Huh.
---
Not sure that’s true. They might just have more shit to sell.  
---
I did a lot of trading prior to the vendor option so have a good idea where certain things were selling.  Probably now is you have people overvaluing their stuff.
---
Plenty of other ones to finish the challenge....
---
Yes! Anything to make the perk card system less of a tedious chore, I'm all for it. There are enough chores we have to do regularly, lets get rid of this unnecessary one.
---
I definitely believe they envisioned the perk card system as it is now (eg. not having loadouts, passives, or toggled ranks) would make perk choices more of a "you have to plan before you fight!" type of thing, unfortunately that didn't end up being the case. It ended up just being a mess of having to click 5+ times through laggy menus just to be able to pick a fucking level 1 lock or sell something to a vendor.
---
Bloodied is the meta. Not only do you get a massive damage boost from the nerd rage perk and adrenal reaction mutation while at low health, but bloodied gives you the second highest damage boost out of all legendary effects while at low health, at around 95% bonus when near death. The only legendary effect that grants you more damage in any situation is instigating, which comes into play FAR less often. 
---
For guns, it's usually bloodied and explosive to get the maximum damage per shot. This is already enough to one-shot most enemies, but you can of course combine it with sneak attack criticals, VATS criticals, drugs, adrenaline, etc
---
With melee, you have the addition of unyielding armor, which grants you +3 in all SPECIAL when at low health. This means that on top of the already ridiculous damage boost from bloodied, adrenal reaction, and nerd rage, you also gain +15 strength, which is a MASSIVE increase to melee damage. Add on that any additional +str bonuses from the armor or your weapon, drugs, food, etc and you get something unholy. The most popular secondary effect to run is +40% swing speed, but you don't even need that except for a scorchbeast or something. If you see people running around slapping glowing deathclaws and super mutant warlords to death in one hit, that's a bloodied build.
---
Nah I don't buy weapons with caps, to me that's pay to win :)
---
Buy a full set of autostim armor, stacks of superstims, and a bunch of assaultron recall cards.
---
Launch Encryptid, camp the conduits and do whatever weird character thing you want to do:  Wasteland Santa, Jesus, Uber Robot Masochist (get a leather cap and go naked under a bunch of leather if you do this), just have fun with it.
---
Who would want non-legendary items?
---
Raising cap limit won’t help you at this point. If it were 50k then you’d still be at 50k with nothing to buy.
---
“Water purifiers”
---
This would be awesome, and a way to save certain builds would be awesome! Spend a lot of time rearranging skills to fit crafting/melle/ranged builds!
---
If caps arent that valuable to you anymore why keep earning them?
---
I do suggest finding a trustworthy friend to let you stash some caps on a mule or something if you really dont have room over 5 characters..
---
Not saying a I'm an anti-semite. BUT, me and my friends call people with ridiculous prices Jews
---
Amazing work well done! My very first explosive weapon was a furious combat rifle. That beauty never leave my side as we been thru a lot in Appalachia. Will indeed follow to see more results!
---
Mainly has to do with an annoying experience I had when I started a second character. This little 10 or 12 year old kid showed up when I was building a camp and started hitting me with super sledge trying to goad me into hitting him back he was level 26 or so and I was like a 5. What I found super annoying about him was he was trying to bribe me with useless crap, “I’ll give you a gas mask. I’ll give you a black cowboy hat. I’ll give you 50 caps.” If I’m in my camp the only person I want in there with me is my wife. I do have a dumpster outside so people can access their stash, and if they do spawn inside my house they can use my garage door on the top floor to get out.
---
Look I'm trying to keep the responders away so that's what im going with 😂
---
I hope so, as limited time items while a good draw, are not really a great long term business strategy. Every time it happens, its extra date for every client to have to download and store while not generating more revenue. (or draining ATOMs/encouraging people to login everyday for challenges to get them and keep player counts up)
---
I've done a lot of trading before vending too, and I still feel people are underpricing things just to get rid of them quickly. I've seen a good bit of 2* and 3* bloodied and two shot weapons below 1k
---
They come up for sale.   You might offer 10k as a start.
---
No problem I think only Arkos is timed and Encryptid is triggerbale if you have the item
---
Bethesda needs to add a soup kitchen/free clinic at Flatwoods for under level 10s. For us filthy rich wastelanders, it could be a place we donate caps for those less fortunate than us. Buy stimpacks and dog food for those that can’t.
---
Holding onto mine, for the change when we can sell them...
---
Waste of design efforts to make a Battle Royale, even though that whole genre revolves around lazy low effort game design. Focus on adventure mode please.
---
Maybe the nuke zone?
---
Not particularly clever, but it's fitting to whitesprings
---
I assume he was talking about events like Uranium Fever.  One guy with TSE kills shit before you get a hit.  Being in a party should award you also with exp and items if someone on your party is doing the killing.  At least give 50% exp.
---
You misunderstand me. I know we cannot craft mod boxes, they do however exist in the game. I merely misread your title.
---
Bloodborne is such a good game.
---
I'm a pud, never played it.
---
Got to go with thunderdome. Mad max was a big inspiration in creating the atmosphere of these games.
---
The Radiation Ring, or Rad Ring for short
---
I like this idea a lot. If we had a way to preserve food, I'd turn my diner into a soup kitchen in a heartbeat.
---
Boo! Missing out. So challenging and at times quite enraging but once you finish the feeling of accomplishment is seriously unmatched.
---
Holy crap that's awesome, is "Thunder dome" too on the nose?  "Crucible"? "Wastelander Coliseum"? Idk man that's an awesome Arena.  Sorry I'm bad at names, I hope to find that on my travels.
---
Nice!
---
You've inspired me to put together an album of my own.

The over repair caused the boosts. That's done with Fix It Good, nothing to do with Unyeilding... Also now that I've read this thread I see somebody already linked you the explanation so this is kind of moot.

I would have thought the legendary star count on the monster was related to the star count on the drop, I have allowed some monsters to evolve to a 4 star before killing them in order to get better loot. if this is not the case then I will just kill them at 1 star.
---
I did it 6 times today and got a total of 2 badges
---
Melee damage broken, Melee VATS broken, stealth broken... bethesda hates my build. :c
---
Yeah, that was my first go to.
---
Thanks all!
---
What in the world...I must have the best, worst luck cause I did it another 5 times and not a single one. 
---
Do you do it by yourself or with a group? Do you start the event or join it?
---
You mean you can run a 4 year old game good. Oh nvm my bad.
---
Thank you. Haven't been up there yet. Also I cannot modify my PA at all. Why is that?
---
Ionized meat is great for re-upping your rads quickly, without having to get out of your power armor and stand in toxic sludge.
---
Apparently spikes on stairs are an ingenious trap that takes a fair amount of time to create. Why wasn't he showered in gold?
---
All you missed is the note in FD across
---
From the room with the PA in it. Has a password then it can finish.
---
Try joining the raiders over at
---
Do you use a cryolator? Because I feel like cryolator and flamer are the only two viable choices for this particular play style.
---
Have you even tried to reinstall the game? How about update you drivers?
---
Just call it "Wasteland"
---
Chems, booze, or blood, you're getting wasted.
---
I've seen counters on my diseases reset to what it originally started as or I've had them suddenly cure themselves, despite still having 20-30mins left for them to run through.
---
Best 30 seconds ever.
---
What is the note called?
---
Bloodborne is my legit favorite game of all time. It was also my first platinum, I'm working on Sekiro now too.
---
No. Closing and reopening only works with “nothing is selected.”
---
Bethesda on their way to a similar reaction as Diablo mobile reveal getting Boo'd. It's something the game's playerbase simply never asked for.
---
Yeah, this idea comes up several times a day.  We get it.
---
Yeah I’m experiencing the same issues.....me and my friends only play in a team so it’s an issue
---
I guess i forgot to say that i want to roleplay a "good guy". Ill edit that
---
Run on the ghouls at Whitesprings. If you make it around without a single drop, change servers. 
---
On a good server I walk out with a dozen legendary drops in one go. With a team you can run circles on Whitesprings and have 20-40 legendaries in under half an hour. 
---
If you're bored with that, run Arktos. I can usually farm 3 to 5 legendary bots before even starting the quest.
---
What? How can you do that in 4 punches? I'm level 80 and I've been playing melee since the beginning and I feel like I'm doing the whole game wrong. I die too easily against these higher levels enemies and all my weapons suck.
---
I like it.
---
I just wanted Fallout 5... 
---
But I’ll take a FO5 with friends like how Far Cry 5 allows friends to join in your missions and help out.
---
Yes I’ve also saw them there too! One of them dropped a 2 shot pipe pistol lvl 1! I gave it away to a low level as a gift.
---
I always wanted to go back for a platinum. Borderlands 2 was my first.
---
I cant remember, but its in the last room on the left, and its a white piece of paper.....
---
Its got a password on it that automatically unlocks the terminal you need in the basement of  VTU.
---
This hit so hard a pair of SB killed me and 76 froze, resulting in a lot of lost junk mats I couldn't fit in my stash.  I better play bloodborne.
---
WOW YOURE HIRED AND VERY HOT
---
Ok, thank you!
---
So i have seen other comments where the body is showing for you and where it is on server can differ. You can check the ground for an invisible body or try to jump above it and loot it from the top. 
---
Seems like a desync issue that happens to me in other persistent games.
---
Sorry, not sure what you're saying. Is thee a way to scrap cars that I just don't know about?? That would be wonderful!
---
Its any weapons 2* and up that can have both legendary effects, Ie. Bloodied explosive assault rifle.
---
Bloodied Power Fist or Deathclaw Gauntlet!
---
Collect, cook, sell mothman eggs.
---
Just put it all in the same damn bag in camp like I do.  You can do this now but choose not to.  Why are you asking for dev resources for something that you can already do?
---
Damn thanks dude. Legend.
---
What plat r u on because I will fight in that arena
---
Lets rebuild The wasteland ....together....good luck!
---
I was a huge Dark Souls fan, but never played Bloodborne, same style of game? I loved being able to take on end game bosses as a naked lvl5 player in DS.
---
jungle
---
Explosives Expert is the perk and Explosive is the legendary effect
---
I would love to find a group to do this event with my psn ia SunshineZott and I'm on when I need to be if you would like help
---
Currently have marine torso and arms plans in my vendor. Only 800 caps apiece. Currently online, CycloPhile
---
LOL, if that worked I can see a 10 mm being fairly surgical and an armour penetrating, explosive shot gun shell being ....um.... "less so". Good if you need smaller bits!!
---
All they need is a way to discard cards you no longer want.
---
Yea that wont happen there! Any, and I many any time you die, its legitimately your fault. 
---
I actually had my junk stolen last night cuz game was laghing so hard on queen, I was alive with full health firing watching the 50 cal drop at about a round every second and half then boom dead. When I respawned somebody snagged my bag, cuz you know that's what cool kids do.
---
I lock my purifier because I need water. At first I didn’t and at least half the time when I’d return to camp there was no water. But I put any extra I have into my vending machine and “sell” it for zero caps.
---
👈😃👈
---
I don't think you need the mod to scrap cars, sorry
---
It is same style just PS exclusive. Seikro is apparently just like it too.
---
In fo4
---
That's too bad, like I said it was my fav because with the build limit off (my other must have) you could do some pretty impressive builds!
---
Have you seen what someone people have been leaving on bed's?!?!?
---
Yeah I'm an idiot...bought the cool looking RAIDER one lol didnt see the raider part apparently haha oops
---
Did you play Radical Heights?  Because it was a great, if unfinished, game.  Lots more fun than PUBG or Fortnite.
---
not people. but these mole rats in fallout 76 always mating in your bedroom if you left the door open; especially the diseased version.
---
Please explain let then evolve!????
---
I found a level 65 toxic sheepsqatch at whitesprings a couple days ago
---
If you decide to charge 10k caps for 1 steel then you will literally never sell it. If you cant sell then the price is wrong.
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
This is useful information, thanks!

Welcome to the Real World, where life hits you hard and fast!
---
Fuck. I’m out. 
---
I started the scout quest line, and as soon as I saw “revive a team member” as a quest task, I said “fuck it, I’m out”. Oh well. 
---
I just want to play alone.
---
Shhh, quiet, or they'll nerf it!
---
That said, unlike the previous nerf (the civil war costume), this thing does take slightly less common materials (Jesus, I can't believe I have trouble finding rubber!)
---
How do you have all the plans? I've made 75k just from vending since it started, a and I have legitimately spen 67k on plans and outfits. 
---
I already had all serums and fasnacht plans before this, so none of that has been spent on them.
---
So you got dropped 3 times plus other times?
---
😂 hey man everyone has those moments
---
Didn't know that was a thing. Huh. Well, nah, under-armor has zero effect good or bad now.
---
If more people with your initiative we're involved in 'the industry' I doubt you'd have to worry about long work weeks. I may be wrong, though, I've never worked corporate. I am just impressed. Wish I could offer more than just praise.
---
Yes the three-line button on your Xbox controller will bring up a friend's, team, recent menu. Go to the top to your name an click you'll be able to change worlds from there.
---
Ah, on XB. I have a few friends who play Sekiro, but I haven't gotten into it yet.
---
That's one is a actually doable. Apparently hazmat suits and power armor count as naked
---
I've got most a level 15 raider set you can have. It's only missing a right leg. Psn murdomcsalt
---
So says you
---
Agree
---
I wish they would search for a server where your camp isnt taken by someone else. This searching for other server shit is for the birds.
---
There's a few possibilities I see here. If they are planning on a battle royale mode, it would hopefully be something attached to survival mode, and will just be a side addition if anything. Considering how survival mode is still in beta, and how recently they put that in game, it would be a really stupid move on their part to go "You know what the game needs? ANOTHER PVP ONLY MODE!" Also considering how unbalanced PvP is to begin with, it would have to have a reset after a certain period of time, and require you to create a fresh character for it without being able to transfer a character over.
---
Another possibility I see is something akin to what we got with the revamped survival mode in Fallout 4, which would make sense with a Nuclear Winter. Scarcer resources, no fast traveling (maybe with an exception for your camp or vault 76), which would make the whole survival aspect of the game a lot more involved than the watered down version we currently have in both modes at the moment.
---
Third possibility (and quite possibly my biggest pipe dream) is getting story progression that shows some of the effects we've had on Appalachia, with permanent changes to the world. (&gt;!A lot of fissures closed for the time being, seeing raiders being drawn in by Rose's radio broadcast, having the weather shift over to winter considering we're in mid autumn at the start of the game, seeing fewer to no scorched due to the prime fissure being sealed at least, maybe having a quest-line from the overseer to try to bring in some settlers to repopulate the area, the list goes on and on.!&lt;) This is what I would love to see the most, but based on what we've seen from Bethesda up to this point, I'm not holding my breath.
---
All I ask from you Bethesda, give us a pleasant surprise that isn't more PvP. Show us you've been paying attention, show us that you've been listening, show us that you care enough to not completely give up and take a lazy approach.
---
Green means Go. Yet it doesnt place. Blah!
---
Totally agree with the other guy it's basically a game trying to judge the market for that sweet spot where you can make some caps and people will still buy.
---
just wish people actually sold *nice* loot. I mean, i'll keep my unicorns when I get them, but any other gun that isn't specifically for my build and is pretty good with 3*? set a decently high price point and see if anyone motivated enough will grab it. 
---
Man, fast melee and combat shotgun build is awful for buying/trading at least in my gameplay so far.
---
Me either but I may when it drops super low in price. Also looking into borderlands 3 but not sure on it yet. Got inside info and not sure about that one.
---
You kiss your momma with that shadey mouth?
---
Thank you for not just screeching "caps sinks!!!"
---
Get naked and wait outside Whitsprings station for wealthy players coming back, flush from rich WS runs.
---
The rest is up to you...
---
Prob just 3 in around 100 hrs. Honestly tho went afk couple times but people were buying so i slept in the bed but came back to main screen.
---
I see people complain about server maintenance even tho you get a 20 min timer to wrap up anything your working on. 
---
Think complaining is just the norm for many people who play games these days. 😣
---
I don't have those problems and there's a lot of people who play wher3 the game works fine. It's not our faults that you have corrupted files, bad drivers hardware malfunction or whatever it is causing the game to not work on your end. If Bethesda was smart they would just do what Rockstar does and push back PC releases several years. Most people don't play on PC and it's a technical nightmare due to the variations and combinations of systems not to mention the fact that PC gaming will be totally obsolete within 5 years as soon as streaming tech from cloud computing comes to fruition. Plus they have the most toxic players of antisocial people who literally spend thousands of dollars on a gaming machine so of course they are going to cry more than anyone when the game doesn't run perfectly. Just skip it all together I say.
---
Agreed
---
It hasn't been confirmed but audio files suggest it, but it might not be the bulk of the dlc
---
Laughs in Gatling Gun
---
If you checked out the leaked information around the DLC the story seems pretty damn interesting.

You dont speak for me. Dont give me that generalizing shit either.

FoNV is awesome story wise, some glitch stuff cause of rushed production, but still super worth a play! Sidenote: NV had probably the coolest DLC of any recent Bethesda titles.
---
100% agree but if they do just don't play it.  I'm not even a fan of PVP, haven't touched Survival and I never plan too. IMO if someone actually wants a Fallout BR they probably aren't all there, if you catch my drift.
---
Fortnite's 1 billion from the store seems to disagree with your statement.
---
None of us? I can't say that is true.
---
Regardless, you don't like it ... don't play it.
---
Ah geez.  Well that stinks.
---
Are they seriously adding that garbage?!?!
---
The Thorn? A nice homage to New Vegas!
---
Mine too dude, I’m so sorry.
---
I will charge up to 3k for a 1 star, IF it's an insanely good combo. Right now the only thing I can think of is my Bloodied The Dragon, and even then I am fairly sure it's significantly lower than 3k. Run of the mill but effective stuff will be under 1k (usually about 250).
---
And before you type: Yes, things are selling.

LOL. I do it all the time. Heavy Combat some chameleon and my Combat Knife.

 I may pop a Radshield if I see a Glowing one, otherwise I don't take much damage usually.

I'd honestly be happy with two mole miners gauntlets so I can live out my Wolverine fantasies
---
As long as it's actual story and not a bs story to point us all to BR
---
The thing I can figure out in this game is how you're supposed to both play with friends and be able to read / listen to relevant story. I started the game trying to listen / read but then I realized I'm not playing the game with my friends, I'm holding them up. The tapes have the same issue. It's especially bad when you get a tape / message while there's fighting nearby or upcoming action which happens a lot. Even if you play solo it seems kind of hopeless trying to take in any kind of story in the text / audio based format they opted for.
---
Get off me property

Shout out to the good old rug glitch that now 50% of the time doesn't work.

All the more impressive considering most players don't even close the doors.

Ive started drinking Inert Flux over Purified and converting all my Disease Cures to Antibiotics. Still get diseases all over the place.
---
Well there are audio files that makes it sound like it, but maybe the vault has a experiment that includes those parts but isn't battle royal
---
How do you even get battle royale from the audio files? One guy emerging from some hole saying "I'm going to kill that S O B"

Indubitably.

Dunno, awesome as 3 may be, I think NV is the best of all.

We don't know if it's for sure but there are some unused audio files, juice head and other YouTubers explained it better and the crate audio files are the same person, it's the vault 51 overseer and he can be found south of vault 76

Its strange. I've been at my camp and seen somebody else spawn in under my camp building, but when I fast travel in myself I don't even spawn inside my camp's build area.

This also isn't a college lecture, and nobody is here to listen to your boring explanation about when someone can and cannot call someone else out when they try to correct them on a mistake that has been corrected. Frankly, I don't think anyone cares, either.
---
Perk cards? Do you have the right perk cards?
---
That's what some of the audio files strongly suggest
---
It loads nothing.
---
Why are you because me nor my wife had had this problem and we have build and rebuild our camps a combined total of 30 times.
---
There's no term for it but it's when people get butthurt when others add traps to their camps. There's a difference between doing it to be an asshole in an attempt to be malicious and someone making use of the in-game camp objects to make sure unwelcome guests and enemies don't venture in to your home. There is hardly a difference between a locked door and a noticeable trap right in front of you with signs telling you that you're not welcomed in. 
---
But people seem content on getting hard ons for trying to troll people who have built a trap.
---
If you didn't dupe there would be stuff to buy.  I'm always finding rare player sold things and good gear to replace
---
Yeah I have them all. It usually says the name of the mod and then shows the requirements next to that ( what perk cards)  it’s not doing anything.
---
Wait... you think putting traps in your base is original? Lmao
---
Gotcha, hold on.
---
WHY WOULD YOU REMIND ME
---
Gotcha, i have traps all over my place.  I personally think its funny and the right thingg to do

Did i say that? I was trying to imply a comparable term to people who do and do not use them. Do you see people many people use traps? I've yet to come across a trap troll yet.
---
Yes
---
Thanks and yes you are right about tank killer vs tormentor. Long story short, I should avoid posting while on mobile and not giving my full attention ;)
---
Great point about adamantium skeleton. Although, when I pvp'd the most (a few months back and prior, before survival was implemented into the game) the big thing was to run fireproof rank 3 (absolutely required before the nerf, along with dense mod on the chest) and it didn't seem like people were frequently running enough endurance to have both fireproof rank 3 and adamantium skeleton rank 3. The idea was that using any stimpak negates the need for the perk card and if you are getting fired at you more than likely already hit a stimpak (sans field surgeon).
---
I was going to search through the game files myself but then I found this post:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bh9gay/pvp\_questions\_for\_explosive\_and\_stagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bh9gay/pvp_questions_for_explosive_and_stagger/) 
---
Which states that the game files state (as of one month ago) that stagger is set to zero for the explosive legendary effect. Now, that doesn't mean sufficient damage (perhaps a % threshold of the hp?) doesn't cause stagger. Also, I suspect that certain weapons under certain conditions (a power attack from a 2h) have a built in stagger chance (or just simply built into any attack for that weapon type - see below). For example, checkout this record for MissileLauncher:
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/KmnUgWf](https://imgur.com/a/KmnUgWf)
---
You will notice that under keywords it includes a reference to "BigStagger."
---
Keep in mind that even this does not mean the weapon has built-in stagger, mostly because I don't know enough about the game files, yet, to say what these keywords even mean. I would have to dig a little deeper to both confirm what these keywords mean and then find all of the weapons/effects/etc. with a seemingly built-in stagger chance.
---
If you staggered yourself are you absolutely certain that you didn't do it with a weapon/perk combination with stagger chance? Keep in mind that explosive inherits the primary damage type of the weapon so for example if you had an explosive sniper rifle with tank killer you would be hitting yourself with explosive ballistic damage with an additive 36% armor penetration and 9% chance to stagger. I'm also not sure yet if explosive effects can't trigger multiple effects on the same target (if they hit multiple body parts at once). This would increase the stagger chance to say 9%x5/6 (depends if the chest counts)=40%/49% if you hit the chest (might need grenadier to hit all body parts). While we're on the topic, explosive weapons often perform the best when you hit the target in the chest, even without perks. That is part of what lead me to the whole multi-body-part hypothesis to begin with. That and the fact that multiple effects from one shot (shotguns) are already in the game. I really need to look into this more but I haven't found the time yet.
---
Critical hits are not that simple! But since they are complicated most times people just say they ignore armor. The truth is they really don't always ignore armor. It's my understanding that whether or not the crit ignores armor depends on two major factors: which body part you hit on which enemy type. Keep in mind that I haven't personally datamined (therefore confirmed) if anything was changed from fallout 4 to fallout 76 and I haven't seen evidence yet of anyone else doing so. I would love to understand the intricacies of the process for but for now I'll settle for making builds based on my own experience.
---
I do not believe that critical hits bypass legendary effects. I could be wrong though. It all depends on the order of operations. For example, some effects like medic's will trigger even if the shot doesn't actually connect and do any damage (maybe I'm wrong and it's doing 1 damage and then mitigated by DR?). That makes me think that legendary effects take place before damage/DR calculations but obviously it doesn't have to be consistent across the board.
---

Don't forget the autostim wood left leg too

When buying scout armor mods it's unkown at the time if they are for the limbs or chest. You have to buy them and then find out if you got them for the correct piece.  Sounds like you got limb mods.  Basicly scout armor mods for chest have the name as mods for the limbs.
---
Don't try to speak for the entire community, some pvp-leaning people do want it, like me

Hmm. Thats sounds kinda fun actually.

Great post. Thanks. I did have power lines going through walls. I’ll try the conduits. Not looking forward to rebuilding.
---
Ahhhh shiiiit!!!! LOL!!!! That too fuckin priceless!!!  Thank you tons. Would have driven me insane.

Gotta crack a couple of those tho if you want an omelette

Also throw away your grenades, then grab a new set from the new box.

Will do. Thanks

Take a picture of a player engaged in PvP wearing a clown costume and holding a camera while fighting the Scorchbeast Queen in the Forest region

Bloodied lever or handmade would be more probably. I have a 3k 1* right now for sale. It's an instigating DC gauntlet.

You gotta lock pick your way And then you can the key from the church looking building.

#DeadGame
---
Fortnite has a much much larger player base to be getting revenue from. And a much larger player base in general, whereas FO76 has had lots of bad press and lost quite a few players since launch.
---
Fortnite is also free to play, whereas FO76 is pay to get, which also shrinks player base a little and which changes the micro transaction revenue stream options.
---
FO76's ATOM shop also has camp building, and items that are not just reskins, which uses more space than just different textures.
---
Except for the one thing this post was about.
---
From turning in technical data I have all 7 paint jobs for the bos t60 I’m on ps4
---
If that's in the mountains Northwest of Whitespring and near a lead deposit, it's where I have my camp currently; entering PA is also an effective way to escape.
---
Discard 5 cards in exchange for 1 random card? I’d love that, or a way to hide unwanted perks. 
---
Also when opening a new card pack I don’t understand why we can’t then scroll back and read/look at all the new cards we got. It happens so fast and it’s hard to read them all and remember which ones we just got.
---
I have the paint for it if you want to neet up sometime on PC.  My user is Super_POG
---
Yeah its all connected but ill try to throw all the grenades and get new ones and see if it works
---
Im definitely interested
---
LOL! I spent most of my time there chatting with friends and making new friends. I didn't really pay attention until the end except when our one friend was barking orders because he was trying to figure out how to get a rare mask.

Me too man, I barely experience many bugs that the game is infamous for. Never had any T-posing ghouls, but I have had some crashes and kicked.

Drop them excess plans &amp; loot, pay it forward.
---
Oh? Does this have to be all at once?
---
I’ve been doing the same thing with weapons &amp; armor. Plans and other things I sell, I’ve been selling below the suggested value. What I’ve been selling the most of are treated marine wetsuits &amp; protected BOS underarmor. I still don’t sell them for a ton. I’d rather start low then lower the price if it’s not selling.
---
Wait. Pay what forward?

This thread has a good lowdown on how things go with scout Armor mods https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad7fxu/enclavescout_armor_all_you_need_to_know_about_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2
---
It's a shame if it is.
---
It'll be content I avoid like the fucking plague.
---
True we have a smaller player base but the scheme works the same. Also, bethesda doesn't want you logging in every day to do challenges for atoms to use in the store. They want you to buy them. Let's be honest, people buying atoms is what is going to keep the content updates free.
---
Hell yeah! I'm on now, I'll add you.
---
Seriously anyone who sells water is just greedy I have 6 large purifiers I keep unlocked with a sign pointing to them saying free water. Once your character is established keeping yourself hydrated and fed isn’t hard and between that and my garden the free water and crops to make soup for yourself makes up for your travel cost to my camp.
---
The mods are the same, BUT they aren't named well and several are bugged. It's hard to tell which mod is for which piece.
---
I agree, and wow I completely forgot about 4 and 5 stars coming later.
---
If by "it" you are referring to one of the two weapons that benefits from both rifleman and pistol perk cards - yes. If you are referring to the pipe pistol then that's a big ol' nope. Just being clear ;)
---
I was confused too. Found it is spread out through different menus. Which I guess makes sense
---
The current PVP system already works great and fits well into the Fallout Lore. A fortnite style BR with a closing "storm" of nuclear fire sounds like a load of hot wet garbage
---
I have died multiple times in houses that were elaborate traps.
---
Or an ability to reroll duplicate perk cards. I dont need a fourth expert hacker
---
I have mine in a destroyed house. I'm working on finding more pre-existing structures you can build in.
---
And turn down the intro music too
---
You'd have to be one dumb dude to have that happen to you.
---
The higher level you get, the better gear you collect, eventually you reach an impasse &amp; have mats, gear &amp; plans you don't need. Drop those things for the lower guys, helping them level, &amp; hopefully they do the same in the future.
---
I'm 100% certain that Urban and Forest DR mods are not shared. I have 6 pieces of poly mods and another 7 pieces of poly mods that don't stack with the other one. I've been server hoping for a while. I even bought a reinforced mod to test it and I could apply it to my urban leg piece but not my forest leg piece.
---
Jesus christ, does nobody have a sense of humour anymore? yeah, yeah, reason I chose this username fuckwits. coz you're all so fucking far up your own asses you can't even tell what time of day it is. Fuck me. Cunts.
---
Travel to all vendors and buy up all there treasure maps to get rare plans
---
Off the top of my head a minigun with 25% faster fire rate and various plasma legendaries (some with FR and others without). It seems to happen on anything that fires over a certain rate. To be fair, I have not tested those weapons for ... 2 months? It could already be fixed for me or those or whatever the problem may be. I typically play a shotgun medic, explosive rifle, or bloodied melee so I haven't encountered this bug or some variation thereof for quite some time.
---
Oohhh. That makes more sense. I thought for some reason you wanted me to give you my stuff as payment of coming with you for some reason. But yeah im down in leaving stuff for lower levels. Got a ton of ammo that i dont use anyway
---
No it exists. You can get it from diseased mirelurk hatchlings.
---
Are u playing on pc?
---
No. She's dead. Just like Bethesda's lifeless writing.
---
Yes please
---
100% on your side
---
Hopefully it’ll be like A frozen wastelands. 
---
I mean we have rad storms and rain, but nothing depicting a frozen or a cold  wasteland. 
---
Got to keep warm and scavenge for food.
---
I lock my bedroom when I want to take a quick nap or go through my stash to sort things to reduce weight and don’t want to be bothered. When I leave my room, I leave the door open so people can get in there and see it if they want. The rest of the camp, including purifiers are unlocked so people can help themselves 😁 I don’t understand why people lock their camp up, we want to check it out!!
---
Oh it also happened on a submachine gun with FFR. There may be more I'm just forgetting them all atm it's getting late.
---
Yesterday I was doing the even with one other guy and I was doing all the work. Then when the SHeepsquatch came out, the selfish fuck had the ball to chameleon on top of the build doing literally 1 bullet on boss just to tag.
---
So I was like, 2 can play that game bruh so I sat there and waited a good few minutes for the event to fail.
---
 
---
Fuck leechers
---
Steel maiden?
---
And i will do it again. It sounds like im asking a question and you're trying to insult me because you're a troll. Just like almost everyone else on reddit.
---
Fallout Arena. Pays himage to both of bethesdas franchises
---
LOL!
---
GT aGraciousGod
---
In that case I’d love the Riot armour or marine version.
---
Thank you!
---
The surprise to me is how many people are playing. I think it’s great.
---
Agreed and I'm all good with implementing something like you can't change loadouts in combat or a short time or something to prevent abuse. But as it is now is a total chore for no reason at all. Plus you have to either keep picking random cards or have to just go through an unnecessary screen when you level up every time.
---
caps to atoms 1000 caps = 1 atom
---
So vats is determined by total weapon weight. The heavier the weapon, the more AP it takes up. So you see that difference in shots by the difference in AP it takes up die to the difference in weight of the different magazines. 
---
I have a handmade sniper I use and he gets a lot of shots. But I have agility maxed out and unyielding putting it up to about 35. So I'm pushing 450 AP depending on foods or other buffs I use.
---
Ah oki
---
I never crashed once inside the event. Like, literally no even a single time.
---
Server stability is not an easy problem to generalise the cause. Those bits of datas go through a million hoops before it reaches you or beth. 
---
Not to mention that hard crash has nothing to do with connection but with software/hardware.
---
Can they still be killed by others, though? That's the biggest thing keeping me from taming an animal for my camp.
---
Other note: accuracy seems to be based off hip fire and not scope. So 'True' mods will increase vats accuracy
---
No worries 😁
---
Man you got way too many posts just hating on 76, do you not have anything better to do with your time?
---
I cant make that many mods on the handmade but it would be awesome if we could swap out mods like in Fallout 4.
---
Go away!
---
  Baitin!
---
I'm a troll for asking why you are reposting the same dumb crap over and over? No matter how many times you post it no one is going to support your troll camp idea
---
Love playing PVE with friends, and (surprisingly) love building camps and vending. I wish all the focus was on PVE.
---
Not sure
---
It would be interesting to see if you lose all stacks when you use a Furious Explosive weapon. The explosion is supposed to reset the furious effect, and I wonder whether or not this is true, as I have a couple of Furious Explosive weapons (a black powder pistol and an LMG: both extremes). It may behave as if you took shot no. 2 with a different weapon that deals only explosive damage, or maybe *any* given explosion resets the stack because of a bug in their code. I can lend the pistol to you if you want ;)
---
Pop a radaway and radaway diluted increases disease chance and suppresses mutations so your isotope or charged won't kill it.
---
Because Bethesda just hates PA users that’s why!!! /s
---
Bags are designed for carrying things. 
---
Armor isn't.
---
&gt;Fallout is not a battle royal game
---
 Fallout was not an online multiplayer game.
---
 Until it was.
---
Also, why do fusion cores only last 5 minutes now?
---
I got it - there’s a spot that’s perfect for it in the mire. It’s a pain to do but it is possible
---
I haven't actually gotten around to seeing if different wall types have different "hp" amounts so good question. What you need to do is just give them a higher priority target or make the generator inaccessible to enemy ai. From your experience it appears they can recognize a locked door and they choose to take down the wall instead of trying to open the door. My generator on one character is one wall away from being targeted (from range) but I'm not sure if they ignore it because they can't path to it or because there are turrets nearby that they usually go for first. Funny enough, they ignore the fully exposed extractor directly under my house structure. The turret setup that I use takes care of anything before it even reaches my stairs so it's hard to say for sure but it appears that nothing is able to path up the weird double stairway that a friend built for me.
---
I also noticed that crops seem to be a pretty high priority too so if you layout things correctly (watch where they commonly come from) you can also create a diversion long enough for turrets to take them down (put fences or concrete barriers to slow them down).
---
Yes this is necessary
---
and the main menu music for the love of god
---
I'd recommend switching sooner than 100 rounds without success. Maybe adjust that 2-3 rounds. You'll save yourself a lot of time and ammo. 
---
I use a Gatling, but it's not TS, so it may be a bug with TS because I haven't had that problem... Yet.
---
A painless, impotent hit due to a lack of slap damage.
---
Yasss. Maybe an invading mutie horde from DC? Lorewise DC had the strongest super mutants.
---
And the music inside The Whitespring.
---
Can you tame the legendary version that poisons with it scream?..and if so do they keep the poison ability?
---
They also still have the message on one of the loading screens that a pa suit even without armour is a good thing because of the extra carry weight. It was in fo4.
---
It's so frustrating how bugged the musician badge is. 6 different criteria refuse to register!
---
I use true mods on mine with a short scope and a stinging mag for armor penetration. The weapon is also a legendary 2* Instigating with faster fire rate. The set up melts, add in gun fu and your one shotting 68lvl ghouls in series.  Adrenaline pairs well also.  For mutation get adrenal reaction 
---
Hope this helps
---
Yes.
---
I did that once when I started. Nobody would kill me. I finally ran up to a trio in my underwear and they put me out of my bounty misery.
---
Mats only peaceable on terrain a possible solution? maybe instead of mats just a short trail of footprints or some shit idk.
---
Ill be on in a little bit
---
Every run at uranium fever gives 3 legendary enemies. Worst case scenario you get 3x 1 star armor pieces. Best case you get a couple of decent weapons that can be sold or exchanged for scrip. Either way, it only takes 8 minutes.
---
My best run since the vendor appeared included 2x 3 star weapons a 2 star armor. 40+ scrip for a few minutes of "work" is gravy.
---
Ok. This is very helpful.  I use a mix of true and stabilized mods but will change out the stabilized.  Sadly my build is not an unyielding based one as this is a team medic. Could you suggest what foods, drinks and chems boost AP?
---
Roleplay? I want to try that too
---
I'd rather be able to place that in my own camp.
---
Did you get a group yet
---
I've bad this bug before it goes away after a server hop.
---
Awesome thank you tons!!!
---
*had
---
That paint can is inaccurate as hell, you should probably put a scope on it
---
You said you watched his junk...
---
Sweet rolls are beasts. Nuka quantums replenish. Other mirelurk foods are good for AP Regen and max AP.
---
Happens regularly with my hunting rifle and lever
---
From my experience nothing can be learned from scrapping and all the mods are sold in the bunker by the military wing vendor. Also, correct, the mods don’t specify whether they are applied to Chest or to limbs.
---
Ill buy it from you.
---
There’s issues with that armour and yes mods from modus only so far
---
[Remember this?](https://youtu.be/MpJZ66ycTGg) It'd happen again but for Beth this year.
---
Build does have adrenaline but not adrenal reaction as it’s not a low health build.  Does the stinging mag lower the number of shots in VATS
---
Well first question you need to ask/answer yourself. Who do you want to roleplay as?
---
Its made of real canvas material 🤣
---
Not yet. Just me and my wife l. We're waiting to get enough people
---
Saw a legendary fox. Dropped a 1* pipe pistol.
---
Thanks - I would say that is crazy, but given BGS' track record on bugs that have been present since launch I dont think it needs any more comments
---
Awesome. Thanks a bunch.
---
You are wrong I want battle royale
---
Does asking why someone is reposting something over and over that everyone has already downvoted a violation of rule 4?
---
bought the game for 12£, have had a blast for 2 months
---
Not the main character, but some one important to the main character. Like a friend, a best friend I should say.
---
Anytime
---
Thank youuuu
---
And why my fusion cores multiplying in my inventory
---
Even in FO4 I didn’t like using PA as I’d had much better carry weight with just pocketed armor. Only time I need a frame in 76 was so I could jump far down or fast travel once I become over encumbered. 
---
Once I earn my backpack, (yeah I haven’t played for quite a while) I won’t need to lug around the PA anymore. Another 10lbs gone. High distances, oh well, I’ll take the long way. I’m just not a fan of PA if I don’t absolutely need it. 
---
Got my first badge today! Woo hoo! These badges are so tedious. 
---
I’ve gotten pretty good at managing my weight, but this backpack will so of so much help.
---
I generally don't speak out much...but for the first time in months, I had to turn my mike on to try tell this one guy at the Sons of Dane event that really, he should stop running around like a hyper kid and stand still... and worry about looting non-legendary corpses at the end of the event, because running around with his double barrelled shotgun was messing up everyone's line of fire, AND STOP TURNING OFF THE BLOODY JUKEBOX!  MOTHERFLUFFER WHERE IS MY PASSIVE-OFF BUTTON!!!111 :P
---
Generally, I don't care how you play, what you sell stuff for, but man, when you're running around like a headless chook blocking my line of fire because you want to loot every corpse as soon as one drops (even though there are others we're trying to shoot)... holy bejeebers... 
---
Anyway... carry on.
---
Like boone to the courier. Or deacon to the sole survivor
---
Im ok with 3 stars having the chance to drop 1 star IF 1 stars also have the same chance to drop a 3 star.
---
They are multiplying??
---
Bought it for $60 at the very beginning, been hooked ever since!
---
I'll be available tuesday morning, afternoon, and night on xbox. GT: MisterDeath7641
---
I cant tell you how many times i've gotten green thumb from a card pack....
---
Ah. That is why I didn’t know. I was booted from game just as we killed the alpha. I got no reward.
---
Sorry dude I don't see it working in a live action mmo style game like 76 
---
Killing another player what if it's a duel why should you lose karma if you agreed and what about people just shorting you and harassing you but not killing you, there's almost no way to gain good karma other then helping lower lvl player, like helping in an event isn't good karma it's some thing you almost have to due in game
---
Would doing things this way allow for the system to automatically remove duplicate cards when you get them or would that introduce more problems? Getting something back for those duplicate cards would be amazing but also challenging to figure out.
---
You and I both know that's not what I'm calling you a troll for, this right here is what I'm talking about, you disregard everything that's been said or what I'm trying to say, and you direct the conversation towards irrelevance so that when I respond to that irrelevance in defence, you think you have a reason to attack the defence. I'm not trying to argue with you, you're just clearly not being constructive and trying to insult me. Now, do you have an answer to my question or are you going to continue doing what I've written above?
---
Theres assholes everywhere i try to ignore them or delete a post if people keep bitching for no reason. Ill never understand it lol.
---
Like boone to the courier or hancock to the sole survivor. I reccomend finding someone higher level than you. But not that higher level. That way you still contribute but your also not the heavy hitter persay. Thats what i would do
---
What if they didn't see it because it was down voted?
---
Not sure but 37 shots in a clip and high DPS ensures you can pump bullets into high hp enemies with hip fire.  Adrenal reaction is good for reload speed, I dont run a bloody build but when things get tough in a firefight it kicks in pretty well.  Also run chameleon armor if possible with covert operative to get you the damage multiplier on the first shot.  My instigating weapon is hitting over 500 on the opening shot at least.
---
OK thanks mate!
---
No prob
---
You're calling me a troll for disagreeing with you? Dang, you must have trouble keeping a job if that's your line of thinking
---
Hahaha
---
If you look at the recently published stats, game should have hundreds of thousands of people playing across all platform if not close to a million.
---
Oh man. I was just on 30 mins ago. Still need my camera.
---
from what has been datamined and said bethesda is planning on adding a team deathmatch/slayer thing with battle royale type things in it, like maybe having the location of the fight moving or people having to pick up weapons or being given weapons but from the way it seems it's not EXACTLY a BR, more like they tried to but then decided to make a team deathmatch instead but then couldn't decide which and just went for both in one gamemode
---
Hes angry because he keeps reposting about how people should stop downvoting his trap base idea and everyone is telling him hes a troll.
---
Use the search feature before posting
---
Oh I forgot I also said no homo after
---
Like Google?
---
yes, the more DR you have the lower your damage is with the Berserker's prefix
---
Keep in mind that some of the polymer mods might be for chest piece, which most people will opt for Dense instead.
---
I'll be in this world indefinitely at this point, barring errors or crashes 👍
---
Alright ty👍
---
Again, you're assuming I've said something when I haven't. I don't give a damn if you disagree with me. I'm calling you a troll for being rude and changing the subject. I'm done with you now.
---
If have zero issue with someone coming up with a creative or ingenious trap. Even if it was particularly murderous. Deathclaw maze, genius. Clifftop catapults, genius. I’m totally cool with getting murdered by somebody who put some real thought into it. 
---
What gets me are the people who aren’t making trap CAMPs, they just forgot that they have punji boards laying all over the place or locked doors in front of their vending machines.
---
That’s awesome!
---
Trying to do it now
---
That’s very kind!  I also did the same.  Was some decent gear too.
---
Yep not picking any up but finding more in inventory
---
Lmao. Ok. Keep reposting how people shouldn't downvote you for having terrible ideas.
---
Reflex sites which increase “focus” also helps with VATS efficiency.
---
Well my husband is on his game now. I’ll have to wait my turn. Lol. I’ll see if I can get on soon. I’ll add you from my phone in the mean time.
---
I don't get why people lock the actual CAMP building. I peer through the windows and it looks lovely inside. If people want to destroy the CAMP they will.... They can break the door and go in. So if those people are the ones you are trying to keep out its kind of a waste of time.
---
I did the same thing!  It’s great to help out those in need.  Even if they’re just an alt character.
---
I have 4 pa legs in my vending machine right now! This would save so much weight/effort.
---
Interesting.  I’ll keep that in mind next time I’m event hunting.
---
None of us wanted Repair kit microtransactions either, and look where we are.
---
I don't understand this elitist BS. Im excited for it personally.
---
Because it sets your strength to 11.  it's a tip for new players, not endgame.
---
Yeah I gave it to some new players as a gift.
---
Or search the reddit but yes either works. I think people get fed up answer the same question over and over its not entirely meant towards each OP but sometimes thier post is the straw that breaks the camels back. If you look in the history you probably see a million people who come here daily and ask what's new with the game. It just gets old.
---
F
---
I hope they at least make an effort to balance it.  The game is built in a single player foundation and isn't really balanced at all.
---
Pvp modes should probably have entirely different items than pve.
---
Uninstall and reinstall should fix some of those issues
---
It's probably an anti-farming tactic, but its been there for months. Bethesda, you'd think nobody wants level 1 legendaries but you're wrong! I got a nice level 1 bloodied hunting rifle and bloodied pipe pistol, now fully modded for a new toon. Plus a few pieces of bolstering armor.
---
I suppose one may feel obligated to answer every question again and  again
---
That’s just the thing. I can’t tell if this is a bug or they’re doing this on purpose.... and who am I to question their motives. Lol
---
Vaccinated perk cards help a lot
---
I still cant find it
---
My carry weight in PA is 566. But that's with 2 calibrated shocks + excavator armor carry perk/glitch.
---
No cards for cores here and mine don't deplete that fast I'm on xb1
---
Bruh. If you don't want aggressive reactions, don't post anything or start posting something with a subject that everyone agree on. When I come up with some shit posts, I embrace myself for some backlashes and hostilities cause this is internet. Don't go surprised pikachu when you get downvoted for coming up with some fked up logic. Again, this is internet. Last thing you should expect is people pretending to be nice.
---
It was the red one on the right closest to Lewisburg.
---
alright this might sound dumb but did you read the plans yet?
---
Starting now
---
I will try and join you
---
I mean hits will go through as normal, but won't do damage.
---
i mean, they've also said that they wanted a deathmatch gamemode early in the games lifespan, it COULD be a deathmatch gamemode rather than battle royal.
---
Thanks! In case you missed it, here's the full map I released yesterday: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsyukf/new_map_of_random_encounter_locations_found_by/
---
I started a group for fallout 76 called enclave armada
---
We got PvE content after Survival mode came out. Wouldn't you assume they would do the same if they made a BR mode
---
Wait till you come across the other alpha critters...
---
Nobody cares about the rewards just the potential of a good legendary.
---
I kinda wanna see a picture of a vault dweller, Graham, the Flatwoods Monster, and the Mothman just chilling now
---
the drinking fountain under the gazebo at whitesrpings clubhouse cures diseases  for free if you happen to be around there
---
Mixed feels on this one,  on one hand ya it super sucks to get a 1* from a 3 Legendary, but at same time, it worries me when Bethesda has to play with that kind of thing :P. Love u Bethesda, but like anyone of us, u have a tendancy to screw the pooch.
---
Some of them are pretty nasty.  The AP bleed and -% damage ones hurt quite a bit.
---
I wish it also had timers for vendor caps and legendary machine scrip showing the time left for refreshes. I know it's 20 hours but It'll definitely be handy.
---
Now we need a power armor backpack and it takes up the torso mod
---
One angry boi!
---
That's what I was thinking. These items take up so much space.
---
i have fought them all and it hits me the hardest
---
Not just the queen but any event like it (2 others so far).
---
Interesting. Thanks for sharing.  I never saw much use for endurance for me so I couldn’t figure out how it would work for someone else but that makes sense
---
You know what? I actually haven't played a single BR game because the game mode just seems so fundamentally dumb to me. But if they add something like that to 76, I will try it out under the following conditions:
---
* Players do not lose caps on death;  
---
* Players do not lose junk on death;  
---
* Players do not lose aid on death; and  
---
* Earning rewards is tied to *participation*, not to winning.  
---
If any of those are not the case, then any BR for 76 will be a hard pass for me.
---
That's true, and also why I'm concerned
---
Is it crossplay ?
---
Hell I can't even sell my nuka dark recipe for a good price no one seems to love the nuka dark as much as me.
---
Vats drain fusion cores heavily in power armour
---
it is worth it in my opinion  
---
Pros:
---
Player base is mostly nice to each other, mostly.
---
quests are really interesting when you actually take the time to dive into them and the lore
---
crafting and cooking is nice
---
some of the events are really fun and creative
---
sheepsquatch exists
---
really fun with friends
---
can build a base almost anywhere
---
really interesting locations
---
really interesting story (kind of)
---
can see the weather of another area off in the distance (and that's fucking cool!)
---
cryptids
---
cons:
---
server instability ( but it has been getting improved)
---
anytime a diseased anything so much as breaths you get infected
---
graphics are eh (but that's personal preference)
---
gameplay can be a bit janky at times
---
literally the entire perk system  
---
nothing is really balanced  
---
it's kinda boring alone (personal preference)
---
majority of the quests and events are just wait and kill things then kill big thing
---
the enemy A.I is trash  
---
the atomic shop 
---
almost no endgame content exists  
---
building is trash
---
Heh, the items I been looking for I'd pay a lot for yet not many others would want them at all since they're not "MLG META" to the majority, which on the other hand those things are of no value to me.
---
Still in the world?
---
I had some that were clipping under the floor/ground and could not kill them, but they got me radiated and diseased..
---
Ohhhh. I thought that was the first one you'd faught or something lol
---
You're mad because one of the diseases is rare, and this is evidence that FO76 is a broken mess? Woopsies is hard to get. No idea how you haven't gotten sludge lung. The fact that you can't find the robot arms plan is evidence that the game is a mess? There are a lot of things you COULD have mentioned, but those two things aren't a problem. The rest (like the instruments) are being addressed. Come on man. At least mention some legitimate issues.
---
No one ever said there was going to be battle royal! Y’all need to chill and wait
---
I tell all my visitors who come by to peruse my 3 star max level weapon vendors that Nukaholic is the way to be, 2 End+3 Cha perks for +6/+6 str/end
---
Lemme tell you something pal. One time I was taking a shit, and it was very long. Well, what happened is it bottomed out down at the bottom where the drain is and when it pinched off it had to tip over in one direction because too much of it was still out of the water. Just the very tip of it brushed against the bottom of my balls. At first I thought a spider or something was on the bottom of the seat and it had jumped onto my balls, but when I saw the size of the shit I knew what had happened.
---
no the grafton monster and the sheepsquatch don't have anything on this guy
---
+2
---
I'm tired of swinging my 3 star lvl 50 grognaks axe at level 5 critters and not killing them.
---
It's been awhile but I tested these perks but could not get either of the hp regen perks to proc on an auto-revive.  I eventually concluded that they just suck.
---
However, as I mentioned auto-revives + revenant does have promise...
---
Preaching to the choir love the stuff just need the masses to see the value in nuka dark
---
How long can you afk before being kicked out? Never timed it but it seems like a long time. I play a tune on an instrument for all guests to enjoy while im afk
---
they confirmed a deathmatch gamemode in the future, whose to say this is truly a battle royal and not a new free for all deathmatch?
---
I'd quote the definition of pay to win again, but I'm out of time to waste on this
---
30 minutes?
---
You could give the stuff away Comrade!  😉
---
For sure, do you need me at the cemetery to get there?
---
I run a vanguard high life build with around 550 ballistic and 400 energy resistance and he just 3 hits me dead , nothing in the game can do that to me  cept another player maybe lol
---
+9001
---
My two large purifiers are locked,  my two small are unlocked.
---
Depending on disease, i just let it run its course. Like dissentry, i always have plenty water and food that just ends up spoiling anyway. 
---
Get Pharma Farma perk card. So you can get extra chems when looting. You'll end up with more disease cures. Get Super Duper and Chemist when crafting them, it will go a long way.
---
Maybe. Not sure. Logging in now to your server.
---
Yep i just got it the other day
---
I assume that there are 2 different types of polymer mods one for the chest and one for legs/arms. I have both but nether work for the Forest Variant yet work fine for the Urban.
---
Prices are high and I'm angry
---
It freezes too 😂
---
Great idea
---
Those voice lines sound absolutely horrendous. At first I thought it was the dude making the video just changing his voice and voice acting.
---
Which makes me think Bethesda is trolling people because they knew these would be uncovered right when they were added and pushed to clients.
---
Honestly I've been playing FO4 alot lately and I can't agree more. Seeing how much they dumbed down npcs is so sad. Like ghouls and deathclaws dodging bullets rules! Super mutants that aren't just bullet sponges.  Gunners!!! 
---
Building was way less restrictive as well not so much budget but way items are placed.
---
I just feel like as much as we want this game to be so much more I'm not sure it's even capable of it. I'm not a programmer but I really feel during development they had to steamline a ton of code for it to work well and we lost so much in the process we now have a very watered down fallout.

I want a duffle bag we can strap across the back of our power armor. Found in abandoned warehouse at Whitesprings. With 'Embargoed delivery' stickers on them.
---
My mega sloth died. I only had him for a day
---
I use punji boards inside my living area and my shop is separate you have to go through a locked door before you will hit them but they are there just in case
---
Ya that was my plan till my smog tried killing a cat, and a world where my petting hurts cats, is not the world I want to live in.
---
I just made some level 7’s day with an instigating level 5 fire axe :)
---
Good idea
---
YES!
---
Thank you so much!!!!!
---
Bloodied builds. Devs are definitly gonna nerf those. Or...they should severely lower the damage players do to each other. Maybe then pvp skirmishes would last longer than 2 seconds.
---
Yeah man that's pretty crazy haha
---
Only when my video card crashes. But it does that on several programs, not just games.
---
The fog crawler definitely hits harder than anything else in the game, it's nuts
---
No worries, but you sped away before I could give you some film!! 😆 Anyway, have fun 😁👍
---
They do both things you stated. Higher damage than a non-legendary version at very low DR, and less damage than a non-legendary version at high DR
---
I mean it’s probably the only chance they’ll ever be to have a battle Royale in Fallout, since it’ll be a while til fallout 5 and after that I doubt they’ll be another multiplayer. 
---
I’m not saying it’s a good thing at all, but it’s their only chance to do this and it could possibly make pvp more interesting. If they add good rewards and not make it restrictive (aka losing aids or scrap on death) I say why not. 
---
As long as pve players (the majority) have a lot more stuff than just this to look forward to in the dlc, I think it’ll be fine, just another game mode right?
---
Who's that guy? He knows all the sweets. Who's that guy. He mapped out the streets. Candy Randy. It's my favorite blog.
---
I believe two shot explosive weaponry still do double damage ie grenade rifle.
---
FFS even a game like Terraria has training dummies in it to test weapons.  Come one Fall out, step up your game
---
Nope, I just got dropped earlier. Just glad it let my customer finish buying, but wish I could have finished browsing HIS store...
---
gonna use this to pitch my own Idea of what they should do  
---
I  think it would be cool to have world changing event happen for an anniversary, we've been fighting the scorched for a year or more + BoS  attempts at eradication. I think there should be a last nuke launched kind of event, where the final battle between scorched beasts and queens  is brought to an end, BoS roll in, Raiders begin to come back and  replace the scorched, harassing you and your camp and your settlements.  Instead of having meaningless attacks from scorched\\robots\\molerats on  the power plants, you could have BoS come in trying to claim them. You  could have NPC's that just have no interaction or give off one liners  like engineers or scientist/scribes.
---
BoS  is on a clean up mission wiping anything and everything out. Since it's  still early they could have vehicles (on rails), they could enter in  the ash heap, via train and even offer quests to help rebuild their old  strong holds (that later get destroyed by raider attacks or nukes).
---
You  would be involved in the story by having the outcasts created and have  to choose sides, or become a full fledged raider in which case BoS is  hostile to you, be a wanderer in which case the raiders attack you  anyways but BoS is neutral. Shortly after the Enclave show up as well  (I'm not sure how this would work as I've kind of stopped following the  story after entering the bunker, and just grinded it out for the sake of  launching nukes).
---
Players  could have actual PvE missions that have actual impacts or importance,  where its destroy raider bases with the nukes, or hijack a nuke to  attack the brotherhood, or outcasts who have to defend waves of enemies  attacking the nukes. Bases could be bunkers or strongholds that have  over-boss's or captured deathclaws (Raider end game bosses), modified computers, you could even introduce new "Mechs" that were experimental during pre-war (BoS End bosses)  (Players obviously don't have to kill  each other but the dev team can decide for that)
---
This  would help add more to the end game that right now is pretty stale,  also it would add a story element to have a smaller spawn of scorched  beasts in  the world (which to my knowledge everyone is annoyed by,  including me.) You could have incursions of weaker SB and a small squad  of scorched attacking both sides in a nuke-zone.
---
It's  a bit ambitious, and I know this will probably get buried and no actual  dev would care to do any of this but I just thought it would be a good  solution and a huge update that could even pull in more players.  Introduce new guns from older games new melee weapons, new armor and  skins can be imported from fallout 4. Plus SBs are really starting to  piss me off, coming out of no where, with nukes and such resulting in  nothing.
---
I don't know, maybe I'm just rambling. Let me know what you think below, I'm interested in discussing this topic
---
I  think this would work. I mean look at what PoE and Fortuna did for Warframe. Look at what Path of Exiles has been doing, and even Guildwars 2, these games have been running whats an eternity in the games industry right now
---
+10+15+25= beth wtf? it's better to.put 3 different cards of 10% than to get 1 card to 3* lul
---
No it’s cool I wanted to craft some anyways for the Atoms. But I had to get off to let my husband have his turn back. Hehe.
---
i switch to my lever rifle for vats targeting for almost every event for this reason, especially the bugs. I use a two shot explosive for sniping otherwise. if Im solo swap to melee and tank in power armor when is boss time.
---
it really does suck that people ignore the event - you actually can complete the event THEN kill the boss so everyone gets what they want...
---
and honestly I don't get why everyone seems to intentionally kill the cows after even if they complete it  ...poor cows :(
---
I think it's 200years for bans 😂
---
Ive seen them a few times. I thought they were part of Monster Mash
---
Just solo'd Project Paradise and ran like a bitch when an Alpha Fog Crawler appeared.
---
...Jumped on top of the storage containers and Runescape safespotted, and earned my 1* wood like a man
---
The Aftermath
---
U gonna be on tommrow?
---
How many had you scrapped by that point?
---
Yep.
---
FO76 is bullshit when it comes to respec'ing. They nerf a build and I need to grind levels to respec. Now that nukes dont fall like rain I have to grind even more to adjust my spec. Havent played in 5 days, don't feel any desire to.
---
I would not drink them here or there. 
---
I would not drink them anywhere.
---
I would not drink nuka dark.
---
I do not like it Sam-I-am
---
jk just thought the post sounded like Dr Seuss wrote it. Like the post. Never tried nuka dark.
---
One guy was yelling at me cus my serums was too high, five minutes later someone bought them.  Dont like someones prices?  Dont buy it.  Either someone else will or wont.
---
My psn is "Maks-1019" ill help out ad much as i can.
---
Start a new character. You have 5 slots.
---
Alright thank you!
---
I dnt like this engine for pvp so i dnt know how clean a br will be. We'll see i guess.
---
Where in tanagra? Ive been searching and cant find it.
---
I got both the hardened receiver and suppressor from scrapping. They were some of my first mods, I must have been incredibly lucky. A datamine from a while ago showed that the radium rifle for whatever reason has its own mod learn chance separate from all other weapons, and each one has an incredibly low chance
---
I like your POV.
---
be aware that there some cards that have special things once upgraded like that one that make repair power armor for less materials only available with rank2
---
if I had wanted to play a battle royale game I could have - with other games. we were NOT sold a battle royale game. I will be very upset if there are rewards for say, camp items (not battle royale content) locked behind battle royale content.
---
Yeah it really makes sense that a ton of people who just spent 20+ years together would then a few days after getting out start killing each other.
---
yea lol i'm normally 100% melee ..not against that guy i'm not i pull out my Gatling plasma on him and hide on a crate lol
---
Just told you its a confirmed bug and you are getting mad about it.
---
Why do you feel the need to insult my knowledge when i vented about a confirmed bug that has been ”fixed” multiple times yet it remains.
---
And seriously, dont you think it would be a bit weird that my internet connection would make the game unplayable ONLY when using weapons with legendary effects?
---
You seriously need to take a chillpill and relax.
---
Insulting and berating me here wont do anybody any favors.
---
Not a fan of battle Royale games at all, but I would at least check it out. It could be interesting.
---
As long as there is more than just that, which I'm sure there will be, then no big deal
---
Like the alpha from the project paradise got only 1 3 star from 7 kills.
---
I'm still waiting on my SheepSquatch flair
---
Best place to do it is at Quarry X3.  You basically go kill everything in the metal building first and everything around, leave the mirelurk queen alive and lure her (AFTER everything is dead) then leave the door open and let the critters chew on you til you get it.  The queen won’t bug you once you’re in there but don’t use explosive weapons around her or they’ll all die in an instant!
---
Looks like you may have all the help you need. Worlds full.
---
YES, BETHESDA PLZ
---
Deez
---
Yes but everyone technically can experience everything.
---
Creating quests and areaa that only a handfull of people will get to experience isnt commercially viable
---
No use in trying to fight with this guy.  He knows EVERY SINGLE THING ALL THE TIME.  I’m just glad someone else is calling him out for something for once.
---
Mmmmmm.....if you do the "Personal Matters" Overseer side quest, at one point you do learn about the whole concept of " control vaults" and how Vault-Tec conducts experiments on Vault dwellers.  Come to think of it, I think you also see that in action at Vault-Tec university. 
---
From a more standpoint, they are probably dead or wishing they were. Yet,I do wonder if this might be how actual human NPCs get added into the game, if they ever do?
---
Yeah and it's pathetic because they think "they've won", sometimes they even try to brag about it. When there was no argument or debate to begin with. The whole point of deleting a post is when it's become super toxic and you keep getting hateful messages shoved down your throat because these people have nothing better to do with their time. It's bad enough that these trolls exist on here because of the lack of moderation, but they often stalk your profile and troll you on every post you make thereafter aswell. I pity these losers and they're sitting there with a shit-eating grin behind a computer screen thinking they're really smart.
---
that went a whole different way in my head lol
---
He hit me so had my game crashed
---
I love this idea 3000.
---
I had to intentionally damage myself and pull out a BE wep just to even start making dents in his hp
---
Does wearing pieces of armor which have weapon weight reduction (20%) have any effect on AP cost? Also what about perks that reduce weapon weight eg. for shotguns?
---
Intentionally omitting content at release and then making it available later (for the sole purpose of keeping you interested in playing the game) is NOT "free DLC content". It's not a display of gratitude or appreciation or benignity on behalf of the developer either. It's a stone-cold marketing strategy where we, the players, are considered nothing more than assets to make money off.  
---
If Bethesda had stuck to their usual formula with 76, you'd be right: they wouldn't owe us anything. But the fact that they specifically designed 76 as a "game as a service" not only obliges them to continually fix bugs and gameplay issues (brought to their attention by the players!), they also have to take player feedback into consideration. This was THEIR choice, not ours.
---
i have also had ALL my photos deleted except 2 i took yesterday for the tourist quest.  no idea how it happened or why...but all pictures are gone.  :(
---
Based on reply’s I’ve seen for similar question; yes your tamed pets can be killed.
---
I know I’ll get downvoted... but I like what I’ve herd of so far and am personally looking forward to whatever Bethesda is cooking up
---
Does the game get regular updates to keep it fresh ?
---
lol now this i believe
---
NV is the definitely most Fallout of the three.
---
Idk!! That's great question, I don't actually have armor pieces like that but if you do, please check! That would be good to know. Some weapons have 90% reduction too.
---
Photos are not part of save data. And like any data, you should back things up.
---
get yourself a plasma flamer pistol. I mean it doesn't put anyone to sleep (well maybe the ultimate sleep of death) but it looks cool with a similar green gas
---
And yet... there are still 3 diseases that I haven't contracted yet. I need them for the achievement.  Do I need to do especially risky things like sleep on fraternity mattresses or something?
---
Unfortunately no. Sony was being a bitch.
---
at least the sheepsquatch is tough and you can try to defend the brahmin from the yao guai meanwhile...
---
but if you try to grab some kiddles for the bonfire because you see no one gives a fk about it then the legendary appears and got one shoot by our neighborhood PA chad with tse while you were the knly trying to keep the bonfire alive lol
---
I agree, I feel as a part of it is to rebuild, there should be more events to bring players together.
---
That's one way to avoid things lol
---
What do you mean by BRs are fundamentally dumb?
---
You ever heard of the Dunning Kruger effect? People that think they know everything sicken me. Anyone who actually has intelligence knows that there's always someone out there that knows more than you on a particular subject. I live by this: assert nothing, consider everything. That's how I know when someone doesn't understand the topic at hand, when they think I'm trying to assert something in particular. I don't do that. I gave up on trying to convince people to think the way I do a very long time ago. But I guess I can't control the fact that humans love to revel in hatred.
---
Sounds like Sony ):
---
I forgot which video, but I think Todd Howard brought up that topic when a panel was discussing what might be involved in the Wastelanders DLC
---
If you get something important, like a great drop you do not want to lose, pays to fast travel if you can, it saves the game when you travel. They should have put in a hotkey for a quicksave for those important drops.
---
Wrong game chief
---
*yaawn*
---
You forgot the TL;DR of "no,no,no it is all Bethesda's fault *stamps feet*"
---
the toxicity in gaming is exactly why I don't call myself a "gamer"- and yeah it IS  toxic to say the fault lies 100% with Beth if it doesn't run well on YOUR system despite the fact that it does run fin on others'-- and you literally just said "no, of course I didn't turn off overclocking, why thee hell would I want to try and get it to work on my system"
---
Beautiful. Thank you sir!
---
lol cheers
---
OP I feel for you but you should know that r/fo76 has not been a positive place since after the Xmas sale of 2018.  Originally the people here in the 76 we're pistive-minded, helpful, and generally held themselves like mature adults, because by and large most of them purchased 76 at MSRP or pre-ordered it, being working adults with disposable income, healthy attitudes, and a fans love of the franchise.
---
Those that came after, by and large, have been young teens supported by their parents, and unemployed college youths, with poor social skills, entitlement issues, and fitting the profile of the basement troll.  Because they flooded this Reddit with their lack of maturity and social handicaps, the quality of of community here has suffered.  
---
You're more likely to find a welcoming environment at r/fo76filthycasuals where the attitude and general maturity level are if a much higher calibre.
---
They go to Bethseda land.
---
Absolutely you will lose out. Best bet store vending machine when maxed
---
You get nothing. They get item. Caps vanish into the ether.
---
Sometimes I go in a run to make a ton of healing salve. Bloodleaf (follow the westernmost river above Point Pleasant), Soot Flower, and boiled water. 
---
Most efficient with Green Thumb, Super Duper, and Chemist perks. My dumb ass thought Chemist only worked on drugs, till yesterday. *face pam*
---
Preach 💯
---
It will take the amount from them but you won't get anything. Or it will put you at max caps and the rest will disappear
---
Jumping on this way late, but I also found the Brotherhood Fatigues and the BOS Lab Coat in the Appalachian Antiques.
---
R*?
---
That's a new contraction of Bethesda I've not seen before.....
---
Not wrong. It cannot be objectively wrong. You're thinking in resolutes and that's not how markets work. And you can't say it will never sell. Sometimes someone with more money than sense buys things for the fun of it.
---
Where did you find the plans? I've been looking for the keypad but can't find them for the life of me.
---
They can and likely will.  
---
My friend had a friendly Mega Sloth and it got killed by the time he got back to his camp.  
---
Now he has a 3-star legendary Mirelurk King so he keeps him safe underground within his foundation-farm behind a keypad-locked door. His store is offline when he leaves his camp too so nobody can travel there and kill it.
---
Those caps go off to never never land.  If your player is at max caps you can not go over to 25k limit. Anything over disappears just like in a trade between different parties.
---
Why? I've not had a single issue.
---
fallout in general not fallout 76s main story line, thought that was pretty obvious
---
Interesting. That explains why my tse handmade breaks so fast. And why my friends tse laser rifle with splitter just instantly breaks lol. So would ts shotguns just be patheticly brittle?
---
Right on !! Thank you
---
There’s no such icon.
---
Wow.. Thats sucks lol I am almost at max again and was worried with high priced items in my shop, i appreciate the feedback everyone. 🙌
---
i do! but in a separate game mode or event
---
if only what pleases me is the correct way of playing a game I'm being a delusional idiot
---
people can enjoy playing the game in differents way while not cheating, everyone should get their own fun
---
Oh wow I just realized it's my cake day! Woohoo thank you!
---
I can spend hours launching nukes, farming flux, exploring, killing scorchbeasts, my British teammate and I clear Whitesprings in full stealth and never are seen by enemies, it’s a blast.
---
That alot...most games time out in 10
---
Yep. Also 'PSA', the game considers the Radium Rifle an energy weapon - same problem/oversight as with the Gauss - so it is affected by the penalty of the Grounded mutation.
---
Try Uranium Fever and kill as many of the mole miners as you can. If it’s just yourself it shouldn’t be a problem. Loot every weapon sell it at the at the train station. You should get a nice amount of caps. Once you are done check out the golf shack close by in whitesprings the golf outfits and clubs laying around can get you a couple hundred caps.
---
Sounds absolutely fun
---
No. Your bases are belong to us.
---
I would love this. It’s a silly barrier to entry to anyone that doesn’t have a microphone not being able to fully participate in the game.
---
This has happened to me as well. I'm going to check my playstations own gallery. They might be there give it a try?
---
I demand the right to worship the Maple Leaf!
---
Hear ye, hear ye, if you ever find me on your map, stop by my camp in the Ash Heap, since my uranium extractor is unlocked for the public and so are my water purifiers. The doors to the outside have a lock, but that's just to keep the nasty things out that range from deranged Scorched people to some times 3 Scorch Beasts (Happens more often than I'd like, as they destroy just enough in the 30 seconds it takes me to kill them that their items are not worth it compared to my broken down building repair costs). There's turrets everywhere and at the stairs so enemies likely won't get in anyways. The doors to the outside are usually open nonetheless, but there's  a bug where the doors aren't actually open somehow when I spawn into the world.
---
Thank you! I'll definitely check it out. It's such a shame though. These people often go straight on to insulting your working standing, implying that they themselves have jobs. But playing wack-a-mole on the registers at mcdonalds hardly classifies in my opinion.
---
informative.
---
Agreed. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Agreed, tapes and notes of interest I generally read/ listen to before adding them to my stash box. As far as friends/ team goes I've run solo for about 1100 of the ~1200 hours I have played.
---
dunno people sells weapons for 20, 23k lol and i was like i thought 2k was a good offer lmao
---
Probably lost mine when deleted the data but now you mention this not so sure now
---
Tell me about it... it was me and a random I had picked up from the player vending well anyways we finish all 3 challenges and here comes a lvl 100  fog crawler and we ended up killing it just us two and it gave me 1 star wood piece from a 3 star lvl 100 -.-
---
Can I have your number? Cause the way you talk about Nuka Cola makes me all giggly inside. (I actually really want that recipe.)
---
Do you even program bro?
---
Jokes aside while everything you say makes sense I think you're forgetting a couple things. Why do you assume all players on the server need to have the picture file downloaded? It would be very possible to have the client only download user screenshots for the C.A.M.P your player was located at? When your player fast travels to a camp plenty of things need to be loaded in, some local some not. In 2019, with Gigabet Internet being more widely used I think it's not much to ask to throw a couple of images files down that pipeline as well?
---
  
---
What do you mean the connection would suffer? In a well designed system there is no connection suffer? You can't tell me a couple of image files are going to \*overload\* the pipe and cause disruptions? We aren't talking about throwing another 60 players on the map. These are image files. Sure, some of high quality but they don't need to be downloaded in the same quality. They could use cheesy filters to make them look all radioactive and reduce file size. I don't need an ultra high definition version of my screenshot hanging on the walls of my house. Compression algorithms are pretty bad ass. These could easily be loaded into memory and then dumped when you lefted the C.A.M.P
---
You can't go without limits. But I think it's a pretty lame come back to say allowing players to say favorite 3 screenshots that can be displayed around their CAMP is going to cause your connection to the Fallout game servers to "suffer"   
---
Assassins Creed Odyssey literally has a feature that allows you to view screenshots of places on the map taken recently by players. You can open your World Map and see icons scattered across the map indicating recent player taken screen shots that that you can highlight and Thumbs-Up
---
If anything, you're just showing you don't have much faith in the ability of the FO76 development team. And if you've never written software then please stop giving advice on technical matters! If you have written software than please get more technical in your explanation, it be more beneficial to everyone. :)
---
The argument that someone might over pay for a laugh isnt a great one
---
I think I fought him in Halo once...
---
I use fully-ranked and single-rank variants of the same cards in different scenarios so wouldn’t want them to go away, but wouldn’t mind being able the scrap the ones I didn’t want
---
1500-2500 on xbox.
---
That’s good news since explosive isn’t needed to add stagger. But yeah I had tank killer on so that must be how stagger procced when I shot myself.  
---
Also, I think there’s a bug where you lock on to an enemy in vats and even though you are shooting them you don’t do damage, until you unlock and shoot them without vats. Maybe that’s why I wasn’t damaging them? Who knows
---
What console? How many you need?
---
None of that Battle Royale BS in this game pls
---
i think you can buy them from the BOS vendor in Watoga, if not there then Harper's ferry, their plan name is "Powered Gates"
---
It’s best played on a team I’ve found. I was solo for 150 levels but have been on a team for the last 80 or so and it’s very nice having someone have your back in a battle. 
---
We are currently gathering our money in game to start buying serum mutation recipes so we can sell them on our player vending machines to other players. We’ve made 20,000 caps in the last week and it’s fun selling treasure maps, plans, god weapons and armor to other players. I love it when customers visit. 
---
We actively visit other vendors and buy their stuff as well. It’s a nice feeling to be fighting somewhere and ching-ching player so and so bought your plan for caps.
---
PS4 and 5
---
Yes you can use black titanium from there
---
I’ll check when I get home to see if I have any in my stash
---
You know that tse weapons are shit right? Not really difficult to negate the explosive dmg , PA is shit for pvp also.
---
Ya, totally sucks. Bethesda needs to fix this in the next patch. Or else. I'll keep playing, just with a broken vats. Damn. They got me, don't they?
---
Well I don't believe it would fit with the narrative all to much in the fallout universe you could only support America or be a communist sure they might have had allies but everyone in the vault was American.
---
i miss my purifiers! i moved bc i got tired that people build in my place and those little ones only gives you 2 and i need like 5 to get a constant supply for my speed demon thirst xd
---
I always liked the cap to atom as the answer. But that ratio is little off. 25,000 caps should net you at least 1,000 atoms. Full caps for about one PA.skin.
---
Big thanks for Fred's BBQ!  Found 4 cute, cuddly little foxies wandering around right out front... may they rest in piece(s).
---
I mean, they kinda took narrative with 76 out the window when they included Super Mutants not consistent with Lore......
---
Nah man they wouldnt be able to make enough money off it that way lol
---
Yeah it's annoying as hell and I too let it run its course unless it's some really bad ones that affects my game. I mean you can literally catch a disease by standing next to a radroach. And don't even start with vendors putting spiked boards on the entrance leading to their vending. Like what's up with that??
---
I haven’t seen them either. My team has saved up and we are buying from the Enclave on pc because they aren’t around anywhere for sale. 18,950 caps each. Ouch. 🙄
---
You just *want* it to be a controversy
---
I've come to bargain
---
I don't even know what that is.
---
They kinda loosely fixed that if you go to west tec I believe it gives a plausible reason. Not saying I agree with them doing it but at lease they tried to address it kinda. Lol
---
I think ts only adds one more pellet instead of another shell, so it’s more efficient with a ts than any other gun. But idk about an explosive shotgun I’ve never used one or heard anything about it breaking fast
---
With you, I'd play a battle Royale mode. I'd also play a moba mode, zombie mode, capture the flag, new game plus, or whatever else they put out. If someone doesn't like it, don't play it simple. It doesn't effect how anyone is currently playing the game.
---
If that eventually happens I can’t -wait- to see what unintended consequences happen to players. Reset my levels in a Bethesda game?... you first.
---
brilliant!
---
Become a plague walker and embrace the diseases.
---
You just gave me the idea to have a Nuka Cola vending machine
---
that would be so lame
---
They are stored locally on your system so somehow you deleted them or wrote over them.
---
Cheers, for the leatherworker possum badge
---
We spent months without any cap sink, have had an uncontested free market, and allowed dupers to go unbanned for months. There are people out there with more money than they know what to do with. The best, most popular items will always have people willing to throw any amount of money at it. Many of the best are still not even purchasable with caps, only by trading for other god-tiers. The good stuff can definitely go for 20k+, but 1* weapons certainly do not fall into that category
---
IIRC bugthesda said something about allowing us to send junk to our stash via a new feature at some point. So what your'e asking for is already in the works i think.
---
Unfortunately I don't remember where i saw/read it. 
---
Or maybe it was just a dream i had... can anyone set the record straight?
---
Comrade isn’t typically a Canadian term.
---
Lol..
---
Don't be mad... literally one.
---
Just let it be yah hoser.
---
on an xbox?  i have no idea how that could've happened -- im the only one that uses the xbox, did not re-install or mess with photos at all....
---
I like using unarmed PA in anywhere but the mire and bog. Still, it’s not as much fun as it used to be with paintrain in FO4. They need a boost here because pain train isn’t what it used to be.
---
What do you think we should sell them for if I might ask? I have some and will be glad to put them in the vending machine. 10c? 20c?
---
Thanks.
---
My camp is near the edge of the cliff that overlooks the Whitesprings resort and Service Entrance. I have a modest 2 story camp with workbenches, water purifiers, instruments,a decontamination arch, a bed, and things for sell. It's not much overall, but it's open to any who come. Occasionally rats, wolves, or scorched spawn when I or another travel there. I only ask they be dealt with if you see them.
---
I think you can drop it to 17,400 if you can manage to get charisma even higher.
---
You can’t speak for everyone.  I don’t prefer battle royale, but if they do it in an interesting and well done manner I’m happy.
---
I’ve had my home in every biome, not intentionally though. I always end up finding one reason or another to move.
---
Not gonna happen because the game is console focused.
---
I tried the new formula P and xcell and it didn’t budge. I’ll try some other combos as well.
---
Lmao why are people downvoting this?
---
Yeah probably all dupped too. Xbox got hit hard with dupping. All the posts i see for cheap (normally expensive) stuff is all on xbox.
---
Ps4 and pc seems to go around 7-10k.
---
Is that “I’m selling” or “I’ve seen it”?
---
Nope no dream, ig was in the inside the vault article for the repair kits release, along with fridges etc
---
Hey I did see your post and map! Dude awesome job and thanks. I grabbed the image on my phone and was going to use it in the future to find more tameable animals. I wasn’t using it at the time I found the dog, but can confirm that it’s working. I did travel back not long ago to see if I could fine another pet, but same spot it was two mole miners one dead and one that I pacified. Maybe the animal killed one of them and got killed by the other, but I didn’t see it. Any idea of how to get higher lvl pets? I guess not that it matters even higher lvls die fast. Also I was going to use your map to check out some of the locations for the plans for the plasma grenades in the ash. Do you think it can be scavenged or just a event drop?
---
ive bought all my recipes for 1500.  bought 2 a few hours ago..
---
Hard to explain, but if you leave one alone after you knock some health off they gain a new star.
---
I try to have as many flavors of Nuka Cola and Mentats in my shop as possible. You could always just go to Bubbles in Whitespring for cola if you really want it.
---
I hit level 80 the first week of launch on my first character. Who I then deleted next week and restarted on what is now my main. He is at lvl 140 and I have 3 other characters over lvl 100. 
---
Leveling is not hard. If you dont have faith in the devs to deliver, why even play?
---
Jump into the atomic shop for a sec and then join when it does that. I don’t know the mechanics but it seems to reset it.
---
Damn, I gotta start peeking in some more vending machines then. Thanks!
---
I've been keeping my camp in the same place for quite some time now, outside of helvita i think its called, its right under Morgantown the scenery is just perfect.But the constant supermutant, scorched attacks are just frustrating.
---
Rule 10. No trading posts.
---
I got a set of Unyielding armor, so i end up with 15+ charisma even without chems. Add Grape Mentats and I'm slightly over 20 charisma. Not sure how you can get that high without actually assigning 15pts to charisma. Chems alone won't cut it.
---
Stand in an open field and just eat chems for 3 hours until it gets sick of flapping it's wings.
---
I buy nuka colas off Bubbles for about 16 caps. So anything above ten seems like a bad deal to me. I just charge 5 caps a piece, mostly just so if you want one, you aren’t humming and hawing over the price.
---
What about the screws though?
---
Came across a camp with a deathclaw. Almost shot it but I saw it had a tag, like turrets do, showing the owner. It was weird being that close to deathclaw.
---
There’s a pattern to their movements. Some swear if you emote at it she will land but I’ve not seen it. 
---
She hovers, for a few then flys off as her minions attack, does two strafes and then lands.
---
That price isnt going to get you anywhere
---
By the way i recommend settling down somewhere in the middle of the map since it'll be cheaper to fast travel everywhere since constantly moving camp is kinda expensive when your short on caps. But this is just my five cents
---
I got mine at the camp after I talked to the scout leader. I think there's a vending machine that hands them out, but I'm not sure.
---
I don't know for sure what happened in your situation but I do know for sure they are stored locally on xb1
---
Depends on how much of a pain you find it to rebuild it.  I know it gets blueprinted and stored when you move but I find it annoying to get it to  place properly and add all the 'extras'. I've had my camp at site Alpha for a while now and it's a great spot.
---
No, I don't. To be clear, I don't give a shit about repair kits themselves.
---
What I'm clinging to is the precedent. It has the potential to be very bad for the game's health down the road, and I don't necessarily trust Bethesda to handle it in a way that doesn't result in a nightmare scenario. 
---
I'm worried that future convenience items in the AS will gradually become more an more advantageous. It's so minuscule in the case of repair kits. But in a year or two there could be a series of items the you all but have to buy to play the game comfortably.
---
I really do hope that, in the end, I'm making a fuss for nothing. I would absolutely love to be proven wrong in this, but like I said, I don't exactly have faith that Bethesda will actually disprove this fear.
---
Yeah. 5 - 10 caps each is what I was thinking.
---
How are you farming legendaries still? Seems like white springs is no good anymore. Nuke sites give me like 2-3 max.
---
Any junj/resource yoy get you can use it for whatever you want
---
Moving all the time. Still not found the spot after 1200h playtime lol. Now actually been in same spot for some time , extracting lead and selling it
---
Lolwut?
---
They wouldn't have to **instantly** transfer **all** images to their servers if they didn't want too. Intercept and modify it? Please please, name a mainstream video game that allows you to intercept packets, modify them, and have the server accept them? This is a classic method of hacking(see DEFCON talk about WoW botting) and any company that's not authenticating and using some form of encryption is not going to last very long. I'd love to see a tutorial of someone MitM FO76 users and altering their screenshot uploads. That'd send waves through the gaming community. Obviously Bethesda wouldn't upload to their servers every single screenshot you took, so go ahead and take 10,000 pictures of grass and fill your own hard drive up bro, Bethesda will laugh. Public API is not required, and is merely a bonus to the public. You're moving away from the original suggestion. No one is asking for downloading other peoples images, or sharing them. It's not a social network. How does compression do weird stuff? 😂 If it does, than it's broken. Go find an algorithm that isn't. Memory dumps solve the "But only when you play" problem. A lot of this is solved by limiting each player to only have 3 favorited screenshots. A well designed system would move files around, in and out of hot and cold storage to minimize cost. Companies as large as Bethesda would be paying fractions of fractions of a penny per image to keep in cold storage. Players who haven't logged in -2 weeks, all their shit goes into cold storage.
---
Yeah, my unyielding gear was sold as I use sentinel gear now. May have to rethink my sales and keep a set as I accumulate from here on. That’s a good idea.
---
Currently level 178 and I have been in the same spot since level 5. Under the bridge just south of the Morgantown Train Yard.
---
I believe there are 49 different "Scene" encounters, and tameable animals can only spawn from 3 of those.  So, they won't spawn at those locations every time.
---
I can't figure out which tameables can spawn where, but they might just follow the same conditions as normal enemies.  So, higher level and tougher enemies would be closer to the east side of the map.
---
Why try to get into someone's camp if they have it all locked and clearly don't want you there? You might want to use their shit but their entitled to not have you breaking in and using it if they don't want you to, wtf.
---
Check what plans you bought.  I had the same problem with robot chest piece.  Turns out I bought MOD plans for the chest piece, and not a plan to make the chest piece itself.  Some of the plan names you can't see in full when you buy them.
---
When Reddit alerts me to something trending on this page I come read it.  From there I proceed to post DeadGame.  Thats all.  Loved it when it dropped, Bethesda has since killed it.  Thats all.  I live my life like everyone else.  You obviously frequent reddit as well, does it impede your day to day activities to browse threads in your down time?  So dont come at me putting sitgmas on me, assuming you know anything about my life.  I have an opinion.  Just as you all do.  One that I am entitled too, just as you are.  If you dont like it scroll past.  :) enjoy the broken paragraph
---
I can see it becoming a griefing problem in PvE but its all fair game in PvP
---
You’ll get more shots out of powerful automatic in vats than hardened.
---
What price will?
---
Get a shotgun, any shotgun, even the one that the scorched you just killed dropped, equip 'enforcer', 'skeet shooter' and shoot at the thing.
---
You'll cripple the wings in no time and it will have to land.
---
Then proceed to formally introduce her to the teachings of your own school of head massage.
---
Do you have adrenal reaction mutation?
---
Loooong term maybe. Short term, no.
---
Slight potential of recolors, but I doubt it as the colors involve their themes.
---
I check Junk Piles and found a few that way.
---
Like fuck. I've only seen the flatwoods monster twice in 200+ hours of gameplay...... And you find this.
---
No battle please! This isn't fork knife
---
For no reason nobody is correcting you sir. It's royale.
---
Tse radium rifles go for 15k on the trading subs
---
This. I hate maxing a perk then wanting to only use rank 2 of it to use the other point for something else. Instead having to do the perk again ruins it. I'd be fine with perk pack giving perks we already have if we could do this...oh and having to search for all 3 lockpick perks is really really stupid
---
yeah hold tf up
---
Those suckers really do soak up a disproportionate amount of damage for the garbage they drop.
---
Yes, does it give that much extra damage?
---
Im a big fan of radsheild.
---
I believe so? The mechanic can't be too far from your camp Brahmin, I wouldn't think. With the friendly camp Brahmin, I can't approach them, as I have plague walker, and cause aggro. We all know what happens then, ribeyes.
---
Bloodied unarmed... our team drop the queen in under 5 minutes every time (and most of that time is spent waiting for her to land)
---
I hit around 5k a swing and after all swing speed buffs I swing 2.1 times a second
---
If vault 51’s experiment was a battle royal I’d probably cry lol.
---
Yeah 10-20. Bought 99 for 10 apiece in one shop earlier. That's what gave me the idea for this post
---
Get rid of the light machine gun. It's probs the worst heavy weapon cause it wastes .308 rounds really fast and you can't really craft .308 in large amounts
---
Pretty sure its bc of that . But i have not tested , if you search will find numbers about it
---
I thought I would too but didn't get 1. I had a weird bug happen to me doing the swarm of suitors event. When the Imposter Sheepsquatch first arrived. It was the Tadpole Quest it popped up early. I didn't do anything in it. It disappeared after Suitors Event. I think this caused it. It is on Bethesda's side and they need to fix it. We need to get a official response from them. Because I can't get any rewards like Backpacks or Frog Habitat.
---
lol :)
---
Butchers bounty perk got mine done quick
---
If its ultracite ammo then I'd be careful
---
No just regular old 5.56
---
Me too
---
I go through a lot of water, like a lot
---
I like the ambiance of walking around the forests in Beth’s open world games.
---
Thunder dome... duh
---
Me *realizing theres stash boxes everywhere that are more effective*:...shit....
---
You'll be fine
---
I keep my CAMP in the same location...until I find a new spot I like better lol. And I always say it will be the last move
---
My advice would be to just record you buying it. That way if Bethesda accuse you of duping, you can provide evidence saying they were bought
---
No shoot for the legs non vats it cripples them.
---
Hahaha LOL
---
*tears his vestments and shakes fist to the air* 'Curse you and your RNG Doctorshats' *rawrr*

If it is a DM mode, they better make it so it just drops us into an arena similar to the Gunner Vault in FO4 so we can hash it out in a small urban map.  That's would be much better than Yet Another Massive Map Battle Royale.
---
Fair enough I guess. But I'd imagine in all that wondering you'd gain some levels
---
I've been of the same opinion and was expecting this since launch. Anyone would think every game that has ever launched has had a perfect and happy launch with no issues whatsoever. No software is smooth at launch, and catering to literally millions of people at once would be no easy task for any company, regardless of infrastructure.
---
Looking forward to finding out what Nuclear Winter is all about though.
---
Could honestly see this as a daily quest at the Grafton shooting range or the Army training base. First objective could be to go collect/craft random weapon. Then it would be time to test it out on some target dummies. lastly you would get to do a life fire test against a random group of mobs.
---
This would be nice to get to mess around with some of the less desirable / used weapons.
---
i have been in the same spot since thanksgiving weekend, i do however change it around now and then.
---
Yeah it would nice to fly the Aussie flag in the game, right beside a BoS flag (if we could have faction flags)
---
No idea, but if it helps ease your nerves about it. Record your transactions, so you have proof of legitimacy if you find yourself banned. If you can easily prove their was no foul play, i don't see why you would remain banned after the fact.
---
I have a convo of the guy and me doing transaction I don’t have enough space to record on PS4
---
lol thanks I’ll try that 😂
---
I'd recommend swapping out pack rat with traveling pharmacy. It's more likely you'll have more chems and stims than junk in your inventory. Plus you can scrap pretty much anywhere or swap them if you find yourself with too much junk n the trunk. 
---
I'd also recommend serendipity in luck if you're rocking nerd rage and bloodied build. Because your HP will be something like 50ish which is a quick kill for most enemies.
---
I moved around a bit until I settled in my current location.... I love where I am now and would never move again...
---
My camp is built to fit the terrain, and I love that I constantly get players coming into my house and using the workshop or buying things from my store
---
I am just up the road from you - between the damn and the airport
---
someone asked for SB meat at watoga TS today, I also did not get any
---
No, they can't. Not by other players if you're in pacifist. And no, nobody has 3 star pets, they're level 30 tops.
---
Hah, come on now, I love their games but they have more bugs than a cereal box in the ghetto. Think about the purveyor- people getting 3* wood items that revert to 1*. Whoops 🤷🏻‍♂️ Now imagine something as important and complicated as resetting a character. I’m half joking and legit half terrified of what could happen.
---
VATS won’t help you much with the heavy weapons. You need adrenaline 5 as it’s a must. Maybe have a LMG to kill the lesser enemies and switch to the Gatling once you are at the +60%? That’s what I do.
---
No, they can't be harmed by other players if you're in pacifist mode. These guys don't tame.
---
I would like to think so, but I am sure there is more going on with legendary drops behind the scenes than we know about. I am convinced that if you don't play for approximately 24 hours, you get what I call a legendary shower for the first hour or so.  After that it slows to about 1 legendary per hour. Way too often I hit up whitesprings as my first stop after 24 hours away from the game and I will get 5 or 6 legendary drops. Then I come back 6 hours later and get Zero. I just don't believe that the odds are completely random. There is some poker machine psychology shit going on behind the scenes.
---
As a recovering alcoholic could I ask for something else? Like, I get it, not an issue for most people, but it’s weird how often online games specifically make you drink. And there’s already a whole quest line about getting blackout drunk.
---
This would explain a lot. I rarely PvP, and the only encounters I’ve had so far end as above. I can only gauge the effectiveness of my TSE weapons based off of high level enemies, which it usually mows down. Even though I’m not new to Fallout by any means, as I’ve been playing non stop since FO3, the PvP aspect is still so foreign to me. So as stupid as it sounds, I just think “PA w/ high DMG resistance + strong weapon = competitiveness.” Obviously not the case. 
---
Any suggestions for a solid PvP build?
---
Skiing works for me
---
I’ve heard of this before.
---
Unyeilding gets it down to 17500 from what I've seen (21 charisma), but there seems to be a cap at a certain charisma level. Grape mentats didn't help with the boost to 26. The vendor has caps again too, so it's around 16,100 total.
---
I... quite honestly don't care either way as long as it's good. A Fallout Battle Royale could be a pretty good idea and I can think of several in-lore reasons for one.
---
Granted, I would love a Fallout RTS and believe a series should never stay in a single genre outside of developer intention.
---
Also, I thought of a Fallout Kart Racer and giggled at the thought of Three Dog in a little chibi form.
---
Thought serendipity didn't work with PA? and yea I plan on having Travelling Pharma / Packrat / Ordanance interchangable depending on the situation I find myself in
---
The new Tiger Woods golf game looks intense.
---
which thing do I have thats Vats? also I thought about removing the Team medic and travel agent to bump that up to Adren 5 I just wasn't sure
---
Interesting. To tell you the truth, I still haven’t really mastered the perk cards yet. Mine are pretty straightforward. All the carry perks, and a heavy dose of shotgun and explosive damage perk cards for the TSE.
---
I can’t believe I just read that.
---
Adrenaline 5 is a must. Huge buff when the queen sends her minions. Action boy 3 is what I was referring to
---
Yeah you right good point
---
Honestly could see them adding a mod for the drill to turn it into a grinder, which could then be used to scrap destroyed cars. Could even give it a random chance to cause the car to start to explode for a bit of risk.
---
This is the other thing I was going to mention. Get calibrated legs on your PA and carry weight isn’t an issue. Bear arms if you carry a few heavies.
---
Traps are great. Don’t come into my shop any other way but intended or you might regret it. And yes, I want you to open the locked 0 level door... you know their more items listed on the map for my shop than you saw in the first vendor- where’s the rest of them?
---
You need to keep the make and female fusion cores separated.
---
ah had that on since run around tons figured it'd help since ap depletes so fast since my PA is unmodded atm
---
Thanks for the diversion idea, I’ll give that a try. I don’t even have door of locks on anything, anyone can stop by and use all the workbenches there and also free purified water in the back. Those guys (sm and scorched) just stood far away and one pew at a time, it’s not like minigun blazing or anything. So at first I had no idea what they were doing, then suddenly a piece of wall vanished lol. 
---
Sometimes instead of sm and scorched, radrats can spawn, since they don’t have guns they would rush in and attack the generator and ignore other stuff. Seems like the AI was programmed to target the generator at highest priority.
---
Get marathoner maybe?
---
Haha
---
I melee stealth killed a diseased enemy and still got the disease
---
Marathoner then
---
Ok can’t tell if your sarcastic or not, but if your were not and your losing in pvp consider changing your build or asking a skilled player what’s good etc instead of whining . if you were being sarcastic good job u fooled me
---
I hate how the personal terminals now look. They look to modern and futuristic for my camp style
---
I move my camp based on the area I'm mostly operating in at the time.
---
Another non power armor perk :P at least card says so
---
I dont either do pvp , but that much i have tested to know that non PA &amp; AA weapons work very well
---
I also do not want a battle royale.
---
When Nuclear Winter was announced I was imagining something like a kind of hardcore adventure survival mode. Something where all resources and ammo was more rare, and players needed to be more tactical and make more intelligent choices, but the trade off is that all weapons do a lot more damage. Every bullet and chem would matter a lot more.
---
Instead... battle royale? Really? Just another mode I'm not interested in touching...
---
Depends on what it turns out to be, can you please stop whining before it’s released, you don’t know jack
---
Some dude tried to charge me 35k for one
---

---
Yeah, my bad.
---
If you’re so rich start giving them away.
---
I lock my purifier because I sell water in my shop. Having them unlocked would defeat the whole purpose
---
Walk out into the area where you came from stand there a second and walk back in.
---
Maybe some fake eyebrows too xD
---
Or my 10th pianopctagraph.
---
I sure hope not. I'd like to see an area I havent been meticulously combing through the last few months lol
---
The explosive range on it is fairly small. Also, I believe (but am not 100% sure) that most of the damage comes from the impact of the cannonball. As long as it's not point blank, you should be safe
---
Walk out into what area?  I’ve died a dozen times.  Keep coming back.  Making a new chief.  Protecting him for a while.  Then dying again.  Rinse repeat.  No progress on the complete prep meter.
---
It may be glitched everytime it's done that to me walking into the staircase and back in has fixed it.
---
After making a new chief?
---
None of us asked for a BR, granted, although this could even bring other gamemodes too, I think that a possible PvPvE BR using various mechanics such as the nukes (nuclear briefcases) and other items from the fallout games could hold some promise.  I'm not super excited, and I wish there would be more pve gamemodes and content, but I'm willingly to see where it goes.  Just don't add building to the BR... God no.
---
Oh look, PVE players bitching again. What's new?
---
Another thing, majority of the stuff people ask for is needed by everyone. You don’t realise how massive the pvp player base is, if your not the best player and you don’t have good gear and a decent build DO NOT GO INTO SURIVIVAL. Don’t complain about how “unfair” pvp is when your not equiped for it. If the best gear was readily available there would be no incentive to play. You shouldn’t be able to play and instantly have the best stuff
---
Cause I mean.  I’ve come up the staircase quiet a few times now.  Since dying.
---
That's way to much but I have seen them go for 20k
---
I've been south of Spruce Knob since Thanksgiving. Found a few places i'd like to try but I rarely get attacked where I am. With building being so janky I don't want to bother with it.
---
if it's an issue for you, then don't play the event.
---
I imagine people with ptsd from war don't want to play shooter games at all.
---
If they designed all games avoiding every possible personal issue experienced by players the game would be ridiculously bland. Fallout has always been over the top violent with heavy drug abuse by the survivors, but you can always play straight laced if you want.
---
Signed, a semi-functional alcoholic.
---
Angers me deeply honestly. I've been hunting down a quad explosive for weeks now and every time I get an offer, they want 30-45k
---
I keep it simple, Magazines are 50 caps, Bobbleheads go for base 100 caps, Plans I generally go half to a quarter of face value and some common but high priced ones at 10% and the small amount of ammo and other stuff I put up for sale is in the 50-75% range of face value. I have seen 3\* weapons range from 100's to over 10k and it's actually something I find great humour in, there were 2 camps on the south green of Whitespring, 1 had Sheepsquatch mascot head for 100 the other was asking 500 yet their weapons were the other way round in price difference.     
---
&amp;nbsp    
---
Only players with no lives would bother to complain about prices, as OP says, if too low buy em out and sell high; too high, laugh and know your prices will get the sales.     
---
IT'S A GAME, NOT LIFE.

You on pc
---
Just hit mute on the tv while in the main menu?
---
Been moving it around for easy fast travel up trough level 35. Since then I’ve been static at the perfect spot for me. Near harpers ferry and the Berkeley station. It’s a good central spot for fast travel opposing vault 76. Far enough from the road not to get attacked every 5 minutes by random spawns. Close enough to get lots of players visiting.  I got a junk extractor, a lake for purifiers and I got legendary beast spawning no 30 seconds from my camp bu never attacking it.

Would have come to help you good luck

Yup that's me,
---
Thanks figured it would 😂
---
Was with you up until
---
&gt;  unless you’re here to support. Get. Out. Of. This. Thread.
---
There's plenty wrong with this game, and it has to be clearly communicated to the devs. But spamming up the subreddit with pointless threads does not count as that. You can be negative about the game or about the devs while actually providing something constructive
---
Oh i have them just wanted to make sure for i sat round for a couple hours for nothing waiting for someone lol
---
Yeah
---
I just pop into flatwoods and drop mats for noobs. Junk, gear, aid,weapons, etc. sometimes trade and Over pay for things in trade helps them with caps.
---
What's his kill count on African infants?
---
It would suck because it would be a retread but would open alot for single player opportunities. Maybe even open it up to expansions to the capital wasteland and the Boston commonwealth.The maps are there, familiar but with newer quests.  Hell another might be a Ceaser's Legion insurgency plot.
---
do you use VATs?  I hear that drains cores
---
This ^
---
I could definitely do without the damn "pick a card" shit every time I go to the perk load out. I don't need to pick a card thanks, I just need to swap out ones I already have.
---
Thank you, I will make that adjustment. I knew something looked funny...
---
Or tell them to add something different cause that theme is boring asf
---
Maybe it can be like ESO’s Cyrodil province, where you’re capturing objectives and castles and everyone selects a fraction.  That was by far the most awesome part of that game. 
---
If they change the appearance of the landscape to the more pale glichly colors I’ve been seeing off and on for a month, I’d be stoked because I like it better.
---
Seconded. 
---
I’m totally in love with this game and there’s things I complain about. I’m not at all unique and there’s a whole plethora of us. While we generally support the game, our complaints are still valid.
---
I gave away 5000 caps to deal with this. Philanthropy is a reasonable solution.
---
Why is this downvoted, nice reference to end game
---
More like a wrecked base from mass fast travel spawn kiting.

I play on PC, I could mute it in the mixer but that would be the same as turning down the master volume. It'd make things easier if I could just mute the main menu music :P
---
Glad to help! I've had around 360 hours in 76, and I will say once you get the hang of building you can tear down a house and re-build it pretty quickly
---
....it wouldn't be forced would it. If I wanted a battle royals I would have downloaded fortnight
---
Things I want to do in Fallout 76: 
---
Snipe super mutants in the head, kill hordes of ghouls with my Tesla rifle, melt scorchbeasts into a gooey pile with my plasma rifle. Also help other players, flat out give stuff away, literally die for other people to complete quests, tend my garden, fix up my house, and generally wander around.
---
Things I don't want to do in Fallout 76:
---
Play Fortnight.
---
Wood doesn't exist in that list for some unknown reason.
---
Legit question: How did you rank so fast? I’m fighting to hit 50.
---
Nice guy!
---
From someone who is definitely *not* guilty of doing this...
---
You only get a present if your doors are locked 😉
---
Get outta here commie scum!
---
i had to help someone else get a collar because it happened to him every single time for weeks.  If you go in with someone else it works for some reason.
---
What we do know, very strongly suggested battle Royale. I wanted to get my thoughts out there for the community and Bethesda to see before they release nuclear winter with the intention of focusing on BR. I do not expect that I alone can change their minds (if that's where they're going) but a community might, and that's what this post is about. 
---
To me it makes the most sense to fight this before it's established (and we're probably already too late anyway) than to bitch about it after it's been released.
---
Thatd be fusion cores not plasma cores
---
Quad explosive weapons are worth more than 25k based on the supply versus the demand.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Hahaha I thought it was absolutely bloody hilarious the first time I saw this happen! Lost it! 
---
My doors are unlocked for anyone who wants to use my crafting benches or take a shit in my bed 😂
---
PS4 :)
---
ah, ok, someone told me both.  
---
if not then no idea why thats happening.
---
You're goddamn right
---
It makes sense for lower levels but that really needs to be disabled at a certain point.  Probably not gonna happen soon but the perk system is in need of a major overhaul. I've seen a wide variety of solutions in this sub so many times but for some reason Beth keeps ignoring what most players would consider a massive QoL improvement for some reason.
---
I didn't say it was likely or even reasonable. I'm simply telling you that this isn't black and white. You don't get to put absolutes into this equation regardless of how adamant you get. You can call my argument shit all you like, you're still quantitatively, conclusively and unquestionably wrong.
---
I like to throw a "you have been insulted" note in there too
---
I mean, if I did that sort of thing
---
Looks like I need to try that
---
Or load survival then the regular mode.
---
This happened to me once before. Nada you can do but leave and try a different silo or server
---
I wouldn't mind a BR mode for FO76 and I think a lot of other people would play it, and it would bring in a lot of money which would help support all aspects of the game including PVE.  In any case its an unconfirmed rumor so it may never happen, but while you may not want it, the popularity of those types of games shows a hell of a lot of folks will play it.
---
Same but with the science scribe outfit. I was stoked to see how well it worked with the hood.
---
They've never played them but Fortnite Bad so BR = dumb.
---
I played Fortnite for a couple hours a little over a year ago and the game, like just about any other 3rd person shooter, really isn't my thing. The game mode can be fun though. A lot more suspense because once you die you're out, so unlike shooters like Battlefield where I'll throw myself in risky situations because dieing isn't game over I tend to play much more cautiously.
---
Yes and they will mostly be under the age of 13
---
&gt; fortnite. Fuck that game
---
While, I agree that I want no BR in FO76, there's no reason to be so angry toward another unrelated game. 
---
I love Fortnite. It's a FREE game, and it's devs have done more for their playerbase, and added more diverse content to their game than Bethesda has for 76 by a mile. 
---
76 is on the way to being good, but it needs help. Bethesda is just throwing shit at the walls now.
---
Shit dude, that worked like a charm. Thanks!!
---
The farmhandy picture came out especially well
---
I'm Irish, my tato crops will have to do for now.
---
They don't like Fortnite. Therefore the concept of Battle Royal is bad.
---
Thanks for the detailed explanation bro! 
---
Much love!
---
Ugh
---
We shouldn’t post anything at all. If you have access to Reddit, you have access to Google which means that you should be looking there. If you want to socialize then hire a therapist or a prostitute. 
---
Right?
---
It's not you avoiding damage, it's the attack just not hitting the enemy at all.
---
Ah I see. I can't see how people justify paying over max caps for one item but I guess that's the nature of the beast when you don't have a mule character.
---
I can help you tomorrow!
---
You havent made any solid argument as to prove I'm "wrong". Nice try on the big words trying to look smart though
---
You do realize it's not just kids right? I wasn't super crazy about it, but like half the guys in my masters program were playing it a couple years ago and a ton of my 30+ year old friends play it.
---
Oh, please, let them bring back the 5.56 Pistol. I usually don't care about "add this from the old game" because it's usually just a cosmetic difference, but the 5.56 had a purpose as a high damage low ammo pistol. It's basically what would-be gunslingers need in this game.
---
Why do you storymode gamers always throw temper tantrums whenever you encounter features that don't interest you?  Its really not that hard to just ignore these things and let the people that do enjoy them have their fun.  Stop being so selfish.
---
PVP is complete dogshit in this game. I dont care for it. Havent even touched Survival, never will.
---
The problem is i never used mods on this PC. I even reinstalled Bethesda launcher and Fallout 76 entirely, and I keep falling through the floor.
---
A large number will be but most will be in their twenties.
---
http://www.businessofapps.com/data/fortnite-statistics/
---
True. They should just make the cap limit the same as ESO's gold limit and this wouldnt be a problem
---
Not really. It seems like when i load a new core in it'll only have less than 10 shots in it.
---
Fortnite is actually my favorite game I've never played. By that I mean it's full of all those whiney, mic on too loud, chatty, annoying children of the online gaming community. On fallout (and other online games) I rarely encounter these gamers anymore because they all play fortnite all the time. I'm extremely happy that it exists to entertain all these kids so I don't have to put up with them.
---
You just let it age in your stash or in the fermentor
---
i have seen it, all I do now is tag the sheep and then worry about the brahmin 99% off the time im the only one killing the bugs. 
---
I do undestand why some ppl do it, as soon as you kill the sheep the event will end but that is not always the case.
---
Rule 10
---
Ahh. Thank you!
---
Same here. I'm trying to keep a rustic look.
---
This isn't fortunate and it never should be anything like it. Most players didnt get this game for some cheap gimmick to be sold off as new "content" when its some th ing that players can already facilitate themselves.
---
Ugh wrong reddit ty
---
I have had this happened several times including the last time I actually have video of me checking my inventory, it's there I server hop check my inventory and it's gone. In that specific case it was a favorited weapon so there is no way it was dropped and I literally just server hopped and then it was gone so it wasn't sold either.
---
Now with that said you're going to have a ton of people come in and say that you just lost the item and that there is no bug because they just want to deny anything that's a negative. I love the game I hate the bug of losing stuff I work so hard to get. It doesn't mean it's made up.
---
Wait.... you want to come into my house use my stuff, drink my water!? Sounds like * communism*
---
I didn’t know that! Thanks for telling me! That might explain some of it then!
---
Third-ed? 
---
I love MMORPGs and I love Fallout. But it still has flaws. Personally I get angry when I kill a 3 star and get a 1 star board but that's just me...
---
Fallout has always had a focus around the storyline over anything else. This isn't Call of Duty we're taking about. I don't mind TDM for a few hours, but that shit burns out really quick.
---
And I actually love the way the created this world so that the only other humans are actual players, it adds to the lore of the whole franchise and the game itself. BR definitely does not
---
Agree. Fallout is about PVE. Fallout 76 should have been about multi-player collaboration for PVE. PvP in this game will never be balanced and is counter to the history of the game. Please spend your dev time making collab PVE great. PVP should be the afterthought, not the design.
---
Okay cool!
---
This has to be a joke because the PvP system currently is absolute trash.
---
If anything, the fact that PvP is so asinine should be the reason to steer away from battle royale. There are certain perks and mutations that are flat out **REQUIRED** and certain weapon types and gameplay styles that are absolutely **USELESS**, which for a PvP game, is unacceptable at all.
---
Well played good sir.
---
Glad to help! By the way, tameable animals always spawn by themselves.  They also take up some CAMP budget, so if there's not enough space, you won't have an option to tame anything. I don't have the exact number, but I think it takes up around 10% of your budget.
---
God, I truly hope not. Let’s keep battle royale in Fortnite where it belongs. Oy!
---
There isn't enough popcorn in the world for the outrage if BGS made a game a console exclusive.
---
Green Hood.
---
It’s usually the first spawn after a nuke zone clears.
---
I like both! I want both PVP and PVE content! It just depends on my mood that day.
---
The real PVP seems to be these kind of posts. OP just made this post to pick fights. It is a terribly selfish sentiment too. Nobody would be forced into PVP modes, and the PVP modes wouldn't make PVE content stop coming.
---
Pleasure.
---
The chart details do not show anyone under the age of 18. In the stats underneath it says 53% are between the ages of 10-25 across all platforms which is a pretty big gap and conveniently doesn't show how many of those players are younger than 13 or even 18 for that matter.
---
Wasteland wrestling entertainment? Lol
---
This is probably a dumb question, but are you hitting up all 3 terminals? I think there are 3 separate ones you have to activate, one for each chief.
---
Same. Also it varies from server to server but I randomly lose knowledge of schematics.
---
Uh.  No?   I activated the one terminal and then I just said to defend the one.  Never highlighted any other terminals for me to do.
---
I'd be okay with but ONLY if...
---
-Our weapons/armor don't take damage if we use our own
---
-We don't lose junk/caps on death
---
-We don't have to use our own ammo/guns
---
Stop speaking for everyone.  BR sounds fun AF, it will probably be an optional mode that you don't have to play.
---
Was about to say... lol, I also like the fasnacht beret with mine
---
Try having four characters. 😑
---
What if it’s Battle Royale w Deathclaws and other hostile Environmental species
---
cowboy hat maybe?
---
It's times like this where Marsupial is amazing because not everyone locks their second story doors.
---
Ah darn, if PC I would have helped.
---
The army hat, plague doctor mask, and pastors vestments is a hilariously cool outfit.
---
I'm in love with the old fisherman's hat with it also the bowler looks pretty cool.
---
If you're going for accuracy, pastor's vestments and prospector's hat are the best.
---
Woa! This all comes so convenient since I'm almost able to tame animals and have no budget... 
---
Thank you very much bro, appreciate it !
---
It doesn't really matter what the other games focused on. Fallout 76 is its own thing and it has always been a mix of pvp and pve. If you don't like it, then act like a normal person and ignore it. Nobody is stopping you from playing Adventure mode. Let others have their fun and stop trying to force everything to conform to your arbitrary tastes.
---
Fortnite
---
I haven't had many issues myself, and I haven't had that many encounters. I don't usually go picking fights, but I will defend myself or others. I run a pretty basic rifle/shotgun build, I have no mutations and no crazy legendaries, armor or weapons
---
I figured why you asked and I still totally appreciate it! I have no friends who play 76 sadly lol
---
You forgot about the Mutant’s Board.
---
I don’t know why, but this cracked me up!  The mental picture...
---
These 12 years people... 
---
I mean you have to be a little retarted to play Fortnite in the first place anyway;
---
ESAD
---
If I put up a roach motel will it let me keep a rad roach? I'd be very happy with this.
---
Cool build, looks tough, thanks for peek. I know despite the few "Meta" builds there is lots of cool ways to perk uo and I like seeing what other people do. I wish you could at least see your teammates perk sceen using something similar to the trade interface.
---
Welcome :)
---
Elder Scrolls Online for console, has it. So I dont see why it cant be implemented here
---
Who wouldn’t? There’s always a bit of disappointment that accompanies something like that. IMO, three star enemies should be incredibly difficult but then drop awesome three star loot.
---
Annnd before I got this from you. I travelled out to repair armor and grab some more power cores.  Now the quest has reset when I went back.  Dammit.  
---
There goes like 4hrs of effort.  :(
---
One vendor I went to had some stuff locked, and then I noticed that, like me, his camp had a bathroom....so I left him a surprise since his toilet was broken and I couldn't flush. Too bad he didn't have the ceiling fan from the atom shop.
---
This exactly what I'm wearing with it
---
Right? If you're running an event like uranium fever there's 3 reasons that there's always other people there, the 3 legendary supervisors. By all means go full send on the rest of the mole mole miners, but you're a huge dick if you don't give everyone a few seconds to tag the legendaries.
---
Good idea but nuclear winter is  gonna be almost definitely battle royale.
---
I did not know that.  Thank you for the heads up!
---
You don't get to decide who I speak for either bud. Thanks for your input and I suggest you make your own post in favor of BR. Just don't confuse r/fo76 with r/fortnite
---
I really hope it’s not. I would love to see something like Far Harbor or Point Lookout with snow on the ground.
---
God that sucks! I may be crazy,  but I swear I think you have separate terminals for each chief. I hate that for you tho, because it is such a drain of resources and time, especially to just have to start over!
---
I mean. There are diff terminals I found that would seem to spawn other Chiefs.  But they all are inactive and can’t do anything at them.
---
I have this all the time too.  I just exit build mode then reenter it, seems to fix.   Takes a long time to build lol.
---
BGS...
---
I think you'll find that story line driven content is not an "arbitrary taste" from the fallout fan base
---
Was able to do the event twice tonight where all survived and got the bear arm plan and stimpak diffuser plan. Think it’s confirmed that three must live. Nobody involved got the arkos backpack mod. Does that require two friendlies to live?
---
If your question is this same as the last hundred or so then no you shouldn't post. Most of the post I see on here that get hate are the ones that have been answered alot and it would take less time to look the answer up then write up a post and wait on an honest response. I myself don't answer questions I have answered before I also try not to troll people but others may. I'm save yourself some time and look before you ask.
---
Have you received a response back from your ticket? Sometimes they provide work arounds.
---
But that's how you get autism.
---
0.45% per scrap for the suppressor, for what it's worth. So if you scrapped a hundred of them with just that one mod remaining, you'd have less than a 50/50 chance to unlock it.
---
I have a chainsaw. I know it's not powerful but i keep it because i think it's unique. I just added a flame mod to the blade. Looks cool to me.
---
I'm hoping for a team based BR. Maybe they can tie the factions into it.
---
Give this one the prize Jerry they got it!
---
I was thinking of something like the pet in Torchlight that can go to your camp and store all the junk you've been hauling about. However, the existence of the stash limit is something that troubles me.
---
r/fo76stores
---
Are they permanent? Or once you leave the server they disappear, also what perk do i need?
---
Yeah I dont know why they dont give the ripper, chainsaw, and drill a buff to make them fun after they fixed the durability thing they are all outclassed by all the other melee weapons.
---
It's not providing the radiation resistance. It may or may not be providing some disease resistance, as that's what it's supposed to do. The name got duplicated due to lack of QA.
---
I loved using my chainsaw but its garbage now hopefully they bring back the over repair bonus for these kind of weapons
---
Agree.
---
Update: Nope, had to delete my entire house and would have only been able to blueprint less than half of the structure not even including decorations. Completely unmotivated to play now....
---
# DO DOOT, DO DOOT, DO DOOO DO DO DOOT
---
I personally am not a fan of current battle royale games, though I played a few before.
---
But being in a fallout scenario, me and my friends are actually looking forward to the update. 
---
And it will definitely not be a forced event...
---
Lying lowe, Biv, pioneers, project paradise, hell even monster mash are all optional. 
---
Thats means you have the option of not playing the content if you dont want to.
---
Stop whining.
---
This has to be a troll post
---
Oh! Well that’s just weird! I guess the game was rigged from the start!
---
I have been ever since it came out. I'll be on in a few hours
---
You win a brand new Chryslus Coupe! Congratulations!
---
*Warning! Improper maintenance of the contained fusion generator may cause undo effects such as rad poisoning ghoulification or even explosions.
---
If you are on xbox i can help with that.
---
Battle Royale would be good for one reason only. You come in with no guns or armor and have to find everything on the ground. This would prevent anyone using any items they might have bought off dupers
---
I was hoping for a proper survival mode with ramped up difficulty
---
Yeah it used to be good but now I hate it
---
They need to fix PvP first, freaking legendary effects and perk cards absolutely ruin the experience.
---
Its you either borderline insta kill the person your fighting, or you seemingly do zero damage to them followed by borderline insta killing you.
---
Like its absurd, I have weapons that can shred the Alpha lvl 100 Sheepsquatch in all of about 10-15 seconds, yet I shoot at some players with that same weapon and its like my shots aren't even registering on them, then they just jump in the air and insta kill me with a Tesla or some other BS.
---
Are you sure you’re seeing everything? Sometimes you have to scroll down when you are looking at the repair all screen. I had it happen to me today actually. This sounds dumb, but it’s easy to miss.
---
Well wood armor is shit anyways
---
According to the ESM (game data file), all armor penetrating magazines increase the VATS cost. I haven't confirmed whether this is actually used in-game though.
---
Too busy making nuka grenades out of them, gotta have those fireworks sorry.
---
If nuka quantum grenades weren't broken I might have switched to those, then I'd be slinging nuka cola to anyone cheap.
---
Easiest thing is just to move the C.A.M.P. apparatus to the edge of the buildable area.  
---
Players spawn away from buildings then.
---
Millions?
---
I've had that issue from time to time usually I walk around repair a couple things and I go back to the unit and hit repair all and it'll do it.
---
Yes there's a second line that says something like that.
---
They stay till they die and you need animal freind 3
---
I couldn’t even get close enough to enter the code once I entered the little secret room thing. It kept acting like my character was too big to walk in that extra step to get to it or something.
---
That may be it. But if that were the case, wouldn't it say that I lack the necessary materials?
---
You don't know how to cut a tree with an axe properly so you're going to have to build that wooden wall with 8 pencils, sorry.
---
Ok, I'll try that. Thanks!
---
That's not the point, if there's new content coming out I'm asking they strive for more than a BR. It's a waste of good DLC
---
If you start out with brick doorways they snap together for drywall on both sides. Then you can switch the walls into solid walls or any other material
---
Youtubers? Are you talking about the guys who make money saying it's the worst game ever?
---
Before the update I had three on rotation.
---
Where are junk piles? Workshops?
---
Well crap now that I don’t know! I’d need to get back on and look, tbh!
---
Is that glitch still active? Mine is probably around there, you can get a +1 strength chest mod and marsupial to bump it up too. I'm working on the backpack stuff but excavator is still the go to for max payload, not only is the carry capacity quite a bit higher, you also don't have to wear armor. My character goes commando in his power armor.
---
I was testing it with sentinel i either take close to 0dmg or I'm getting hot like by a truck.
---
Of course. That's the only way battle royales could ever work. Gotta start on a level playing field
---
True, but you never know.
---
Yes I did find it in there. I did no events, and I recall being extremely surprised to find it.
---
Amazing work! Definitely following this thread for more info.
---
Holy shit, I got a 1* wood from him too. Is it just a coincidence or are the rewards set?
---
No no no, Alpha fog crawler hits harder than anything I’ve ever fought. Harder than scorchbeast Queen
---
Please link build, gear, chems, thanks lol
---
Before the update I was getting close to 250 dmg with a bloodied buzz blade...fun times lol
---
No. You shouldn’t ask anything at all. There is Google for that. You shouldn’t post with the intent of socializing nor should you respond to anyone that attempts to socialize with you. You can hire people to talk to, or God help us, go volunteer at a nursing home.
---
Gave me a 1* wood piece too. There’s 3 of us that got the same loot from him just in this thread. Wonder if it’s glitches?
---
[Excavator power armor disliked that]
---
Broadsider ammo is classified as ballistic ammo, so Bandoleer will help with carrying the shots. unless they changed it last patch
---
blast radius is fairly small, but still enough to knock you silly if you are in range with self damage
---
First time I've ever heard this one. Most posts I see are people wanting back into their server. Lol.
---
I went through a stage of using the Gatling laser myself, I noticed that if at any point I manually reloaded the gun it would always load up a fresh core but as I used them up it would start loading the partially used ones l, anywhere between 5-15 shots left
---
😂
---
It seems the disease chance has skyrocketed since the last few patches. It seems damn near 100% that you will get a disease when fighting a diseased enemy
---
A lock is a more subtle way of saying "Stay out, ya nosy git!" than heads on spikes.
---
Now, if they have a powered vendor behind locked doors, that is very weird.
---
They put put in standard receivers for .50s as a craft option, so hes rolling along with his favorite toy.
---
Their corpses usually respawn, you just have to wait. Also double or triple check corpses since they tend to not showing the legendary drop for the first time, god mate you must be playing this game wrong for a long time.
---
Ok that's crap haha
---
no problem buddy
---
Fortnite is quite obviously the most famous, but they all follow the same line of thinking. A BR does not fit in fo76 not with the whole rebuilding America thing.
---
I don't consider them dumb but I dislike the fact that they are very trendy nowadays so they are everywhere. Not every game needs to have a Battle Royale mode just because it's the popular thing to do.
---
And I really enjoyed playing PUBG a few days  for free (I didn't buy it because the reward system was horrible at the time), it's just that everything is a Battle Royale Game now, and if it isn't it has a Battle Royale mode.
---
Though maybe it would work in Fallout 76, but a big part of the player base wouldn't even play it anyway.
---
Do you mash the vats button a lot to attempt to scan for enemies? I used to do this and my cores would run out in minutes.
---
Player Vending has normalized the prices.  Supply has gone up.   Ease of purchase has increased.  Prices drop.
---
People selling in the 25K range are just showing off their RNG luck to make others drool...... not actually trying to sell.  Most things have dropped off considerably into the 1K or less range.
---
It does bug me that players that got serum drops, or bought before Bethesda sky rocketed the price, have a massive advantage ..... and with the giant increase of Jet Pack plan drops, the prices at the NPC vendors is just ridiculous.  ..... I've got 10 Jet pack plans for sale at less than 5% of retail/vendor price, and no one is buying.
---
Personally I couldnt care less what other game modes they introduce as long as the main mode is still around. The only reason I dont like this is I'll have to listen to every IGN and PCgamer commenter on the planet screaming "fAlloUt 76 iS tHe wOrsT gaMe bEthEsdA iS tHe nEw EA!!!"
---
If it is a battle royale, it's not to please existing players, but to draw in new ones. If there is a new battle royale, people will try it. A few might stick around.
---
That's pretty impressive really lol. Because that damn imposter sheepsquatch hits hard as fuck.
---
you would never be able to get into my place but I will always leave the purifier unlocked, a pot and crops to cook, a stash box and 9 missile turrets to keep watch and you company.
---
The point is you have the option of not playing it. And no one has actual concrete data about the new content and you’re already crying about it.
---
Most people whine about something they’ve already experienced, but you’re whining about something datamined and rumored about.
---
Stop Crying.
---
Naw it's fine as is. It's that way to prevent everyone from having uber games with the way enemies are farmed. I've seen plenty of 3 star mobs but they need to have the drops be rare to give them value otherwise they're meaningless.
---
Yeah I already have bandolier. I had rank 3 fireproof in my build but I also have melee for close range so it seems redundant
---
Thanks OP!
---
I can't resist feeding the troll
---
Yes if there is anything that could add longevity to this title it’d be new maps. I wouldn’t even care if they are tiny. Just a new small area (or areas) that can only be accessed by people who have completed the main quest, with a hand full of quests and the potential for fresh loot and perhaps npcs.
---
Putting traps Around your camp while having vending machines powered on is a dick move because a lot of the time you have to run around the camp to even find the vending machine.
---
There are some at workshops, but they are all over the map. They're the spots you can put the junk extractor on. The Charleston junk yard has 3
---
Yes I have, you said it will **literally never sell**. I gave a scenario in which it could happen. It's not my fault you're too fucking stupid to acknowledge the truth.
---
I moved my CAMP once or twice, and finally found a place in The Forest that nobody else wants to occupy, so it's been there since I was level 18 (I am level 33 now)
---
depened what you want, i was going for profit at first and now i go everything half price or less trying to free some space.
---
The Cores for Laser Gatlings or Plasma Gatlings do not work with standard clip / magazine mechanics used by most of the other guns. If you load up a new Plasma Core with 250 shots, fire 5 shots then reload, you will be loading up a totally NEW Plasma Core with 250 shots in it. Meanwhile you've got a Plasma Core sitting in your inventory that has 5 shots depleted from it.
---
Every time you reload the Gatling Energy Weapons, the game looks for the next Core that has the highest percentage of energy (or shots) in it.
---
TL;DR - Reloading constantly is a bad habit with Energy Gatlings.
---
Neither does survival mode or Hunter/hunted.
---
Also sell consumables! Ppl buy stims/drugs/and ammo like crazy. Farming is time consuming but if your not running a rifle build then all that 5.56 is mondo caps.
---
Thinking of putting up some common bobble heads for players looking to grind nuke events.
---
Plans you only need to buy once... But drugs.. Your junkies love the stuff! Hell if someone buys psycho from me and im around ill drop a second for free.... This time.
---
It may not stop future PVE content from coming, but it's a waste if a good DLC.
---
And I didn't start this post to pick fights over the internet and yet here I am...
---
I started it to get a conversation going so the community can tell Bethesda how they feel
---
Ohhh ok. Thanks
---
Did someone join your team maybe??  Cause they can edit you Camp
---
Personally use my furious double barrel on sting wings.  Pop pop,  they done.  Nothing to use on the squat change yet though
---
If they need more money, just continue to put new armor/PA skins in the atom shop
---
Some are bugged. Noticed it in other guns.
---
Yeah an actual deathmatch mode should be Quake style where you start with a simple pistol or something and weapon/health pickups are scattered around a map designed specifically for pvp. They can even get some of the Quake devs to make the map since they have that kind of experience and work under the same ZeniMax umbrella.
---
What if each player could give karma Per say 1 per player/account to said player based on your experince with them or dont, Which would help gauge other karamtic related things Like reputation or title. And with duels, if you agree to a duel that shouldnt matter but there should be more options with PvP.
---
If you're talking about the workshop resources vs your resources, you can only use the workshop resources at the workshop. However, if you run out of workshop resources, typically in green, you can start to use your own resources from your stash, typically in white. This would mean that you couldn't use workshop resources for repairing or crafting excavator armor. Bit the workshop resources can be used to build power armor stations and other camp items from the build menu.
---
This doesn't work for me. I tested it with a teammate and they still spawned inside my generator room. It did however change where I spawn in, but that was never a problem since I spawned in a different place than everyone else.
---
I have everything unlocked since i have a shop. Its now part of the service. Even my garbadge collector is unlocked.
---
I hates that I've had to out 7 points into demolition because I have a Loadout that uses 5 and another that uses 2...
---
Maxed cards SHOULD be max level or ANY LEVEL BELOW.
---
But after level 200 you have alot of perk points... I would love a few more special points though
---
Thank you. This fully answers my question.
---
I want complete solo mode how about you people?
---
Entering the crashing area with a second character can sometimes solve this issue for the main character. I read about this somewhere
---
CONGRA-DU-LATIONS!
---
Like the test dummy in Borderlands 2...I like it. I wanted this for Fallout 4 to see how high I could get my melee numbers up to. In Fallout 76, I usually test my gear/perk setup by going to the mine where Uranium Fever takes place and make my way through the glowing mole miners outside. If if takes me more than one-hit to take them out then I need to rethink my setup. Also, for the Mirelurk Queen, I test out to see how many shots or hits it takes to take her out.
---
There’s a daily limit of 150 scrip per day. This refreshes every 20 hours from when you started collecting daily scrip.
---
Yeah I think its absolutely stupid how quickly you can cap out on Scrip for the day currently. You get lucky doing 2-3 events over the course of an hour or so and BAM right their you already have 150+ scrip worth of items and then its like "well why am I playing still"
---
I get it, its a nice addition and in the past I would have sold or just dropped these items on the ground, but now we have a way to make these drops still useful, but their so limiting that its discouraging additional playtime once you've capped now.
---
Cranberry bog fissure sight prime*
---
very true. cap limit is just fine.
---
Vault 51 wasn't about rebuilding america. It was a vault-tec experiment to see what happens if they had to fight for who got to be Overseer and the strongest (BR winner) got to be leader. The battle royale mode has nothing to do with rebuilding america, it has to do with what was going on inside 51.
---
Darn looks like I should make another character than
---
Sorry friend, you're gonna have to scrounge them screws like a boss. You can hit up any major building snag those hot plates, fans, clipboards, portable fuel tanks, there's actually a lot of items that have screws, but sometimes it's easy to pass them over. Just make sure you got the item tagged for search to make it easier and hoard away.
---
I understand that I have the option not to play it. I also understand it does not yet exist and that it may never exist. 
---
Let me ask you, is it easier to kill a mirelurk hatchling (that could become a new queen) or an actual mirelurk queen?
---
Kill it in its infancy before it becomes a bigger problem.
---
It's a shit concept for DLC, whoever thought it should be included on the development team should be fired.
---
Stop making excuses for them

Then it changed to fissure prime and I’m like “oh... well there goes that for now.” Lol
---
No but actually, top of the world resort, clear out the super muties, they might be some trouble for your level but hey 🤷🏻‍♂️ better gear and xp
---
You can be dissapointed. But dont think thats not how mmo has been for years. I remember 6 hrs straight grind in diablo 2 looking for that one rune... You get to a point where the gear your finding is OP and desired by 95% of the player base but there is one more thing to get!
---
I get why ppl are bummed out but to be angry about this kind of thing is strange to me. Been a mmo fan for years and years. Grind is part of the game. It invented the grind. 
---
Man somethings in WoW are like hitting the lottery irl same with diablo. Yes you want it. Prob going to have to buy it with cash from a sweaty basement dewler. Thats part of mmo.
---
So if is say "its possible for me to fly with no outside assistance if gravity were to disappear from earth all the sudden" then that makes it "possible" that I could some day fly just by flapping my arms? Presenting an outlandish scenario in which it happens doesnt make it true. Also you should know that resorting to immature personal attacks doesnt help your arguement, it just makes you look like a person not worthy of conversation or respect.
---
Lmao
---
Nukashine is required for the 5k+ without I hang around 3.8-4.2k
---
Survival mode is essentially adventure mode with no restrictions. Hunter/hunted is garbage
---
I for one do them events as much as I can, I do agree a server wide notification would be nice but I ussually send text out to players on my server, and ussually a few show up.
---
to add the event it self its good you get a few legendary enemies but the rewards for the event are straight up garbage, and I can see ppl stop doing it for that same reason. 
---
I think the same happened to free range event we can only get some many meat pie plans before you stop doing the event at all.
---
Yes, good!!!
---
I just check out other vending machines and buy ammo for my main gun as long as it's 1 cap a piece.  Don't use "Travel Agent" when you're fast traveling camp to camp  and you'll use waste caps that way as well. I don't really have a problem staying below the 25,000 cap limit.
---
I’m not trolling. I’m making a point, which apparently, isn’t something that you’re going to get.
---
If you are leveling I'll join i have a lvl 10 combat medic in the making
---
I know and I absolutly hate it, because i can get more than 150worth of legendaries in less than 2hours **not farming legendary** enemies. 
---
When i made post about this limit being too low, i was downvoted, majority of players probably don't run into legendary mobs like i do and they can't accept that 150 daily scrips is not egouth.
---
I am ok with limit, but why do i have to carry 100+ lbs of legendaries, because other players are noobs or unlucky? If buying was caped, not scraping i had no problem at all.
---
The backpack skin is confirmed. I’ve seen at least three people wearing them.
---
It's a fucking game mode there not changing the whole game to a br survival shooter. Fuck
---
I think the problem is Jingoism is a huge theme in fallout so there would be a reason other countries are underrepresented in game, also in fallout lore we whole ass annexed Canada and made it part of the US
---
This is a valid point, thank you
---
Yeah this is why I try to stay below 20k caps. It gets dicey on the vendors and since I have more than 10k worth of set value for sale at any given time, I prefer to have a buffer in there in case somebody goes ham on my vendors.
---
That's the thing though, you have events and raids like that so you can grind them out for those rare things. But dont give me and indication that this guy is a three star when its just random RNG already. 
---
If you make every enemy like that just a "legendary creature" I get it. I have no reason to think my chances will be any different. 
---
But once you start labeling them, and giving people the thought of "oh it's a three star! Something good!" Just take it out of the game if you're gonna blue-ball like that
---
The system is pretty bad now. At the very least, you should have a weekly cap that you can use up all in one day or throughout the week. Obviously a higher daily cap or a lack of one would be better, but at least that would solve many issues with relatively few changes to the economy
---
Right it's not like they can't just grab any usb keyboard and use it lol. I mean it'll become trader spam, but like anymore it bring the server together.  Like calling out events asking for help it'd he good for the player base.
---
It might be fun, but the game is so buggy.
---
If they manage to do it well I might try it, but given current expectations I expect it to be another alt mode only a few people will stay with.
---
I play on a PC and I'm having a great experience. I suck at farming XP tho, and would love to play with a team for once.
---
That being said, it really doesnt matter. I bought my end game stuff like most people, from dupers :/
---
I think it’d be cool to add some entries like you’d find in terminals across the map. Not that I like keeping a journal but it’d be cool to come across a players camp and get to read some journal entries by them.
---
I have three copies of max rank lead belly. I keep keeping lead belly perk cards. I wish I could sell them for atoms or something.
---
Hell naw! With so many east coast cities i would hate it if the repeat west virginia. I honestly would love to see new york. A retro futuristic post apocalyptic version of new york. But theyre making a brand new sci fi IP then TES 6 after this so itll be at least a decade before we find out.
---
" Why does this game still have so many bugs?"
---
Welcome to a Bethesda open world game where bugs will still be there well after the game is abandoned for the next one in line.
---
Then you'd just run into the other problem, which is you'd always have 1000 Scrip and still run out of ways to use it after like 3 hours without having multiple alt characters and a buddy to help transfer things.
---
Lol, guy you've already disqualified yourself as a respectable conversationalist. I'm only talking to you because I'm bored and you're amusing. You're repeatedly using absolutes in a situation where they don't fit, then when someone uses an unlikely but possible scenario, you make fun of it by coming up with something that's literally impossible. Why would I take what you have to say seriously? I'm just going to sit back and keep letting you know that you're a dipshit every time you message me.
---
I've seen lots of "God Tier" one hand \*\*\* weapons at player vendors.  AA, Bloodied, Instigating, Furious, with either faster swing, or power swing, with +STR or +END or extra defence while power swinging.
---
Most for somewhere between 350caps and 1500caps.   Not sure what to say.  No one is buying them when I have them for sale (250-350 caps), so I scrip them ......
---
I personally think they should add 10 more scrip to the daily. As 160 a day would allow 1 3** weapon and 1 3** armor. I really like the rng related to the vender. On a massive mmo game there are a lot of good weapons/ armor being pulled out Dailey by players. I’ve personally pulled out 3 weapons I’d use and 7 armor pieces with all desired traits. I’ve seen and heard about other player having better rng..... this next part might upset some gamers.... ONLY PLAYER LOOKING TO EXPLOIT THE NEW SCRIP SYSTEM COMPLAIN ABOUT SCRIP LIMIT.
---
power armor has to carry itself thus the need power and its armor, not a bag :/
---
Also, could they solve the weird thing that sometimes happens with Legendaries not showing stars. Like the other day I came across a Legendary Super Mutant Suicider and there wasn't a star by its name, when I looted him I got a 2 Flamer. Then the next day, same thing, just 'Legendary' in name no star by its name, then a 1 Star looted.
---
Is it an indication tho? I thought it was a general how tough or how many extra abilities does this boss have? 
---
Personaly i have never thought a star denoted tge lvl of gear they drop. Maybe im use to mmo but to me it means the base lvl of gear has been upd... Not guaranteed.
---
I think this is a case where ppl got an idea and others have ran away with it. Like the eating spiders while you sleep thing lol
---
I guess my counterpoint would be that, most likely everyone inside will already be dead, so any human participating in this new BR would be from 76 and therefore would have been given the whole rebuild America speech.

Funny, you are the only one getting downvotes from outside the conversation. Why do you think that is?
---
Not your bud. Pal.
---
Fallout 76 at it's core just not set up for high level PVP.  Our damage output when you combine perks and legendary stats is simply to high compared to our stuck at 50 hit points.  
---
When you combine the above withpeople getting that first hit before the other player is there it is not a player vs player fight.  It's just an instant kill vest.  That is only fun for trolls and griefers.
---
This is actually amazing my guy thank you a lot
---
Except I'm not?
---
How are you trying to get xp? What is your build? I run events, seek out high level areas. Nuking whitesprings is a great way to cash in on xp, mats, and legendaries. Also if you have the leader bobble head that can help. Running through mobs of higher level ads over and over. I've gained like 3 levels just today and all I've been working on is the possum badges. Take workshops, you dont have to build in them unless you want, but it gives xp.
---
The legion? In the east coast? I cant see the ncr or legion here. Besides thats black isle studio's shtick.
---
Is that why it says -2 on all of yours and 0 on mine? Because you keep downvoting me and people other than me keep downvoting you?
---
Sorry, I’m on Xbox
---
Okay, so imagine if there were a limit on buying, but a weekly (or unlimited) cap on scrip.
---
Your complaint wouldn't be about missing out on daily scrip, it'd be floating in tons of scrip bottlenecked by only buying a few per day;  you'd be complaining about missing on your "daily legendaries" instead of your "daily scrip" from days you didn't play.
---
Not you pal, guy
---
1-5: Something random near the starting point  
---
5-15ish: The lumber mill all the way up northwest. Lots of super mutants.

15-25~30ish: The prison and Grafton Steel

25~30ish+: Big bend tunnel

When strong enough: West Tek

This is a good tip! Make the server re route you.
---
Is it captaingiggles only?
---
The Pioneer/Pioneers?
---
The Reclaimer/s?
---
lmao wow...so they included an enemy that only spawns when nuked, but not any of the ones that are GUARANTEED SPAWNS in the ash heap like fireflies, cats, or radrats?

That's something I'd expect to see in fallout.

Oh, I thought you meant you figured out a way to place a floor in a tree without stairs.
---
Got it. Shows as Offline however.
---
That would solve 2 things. It minimizes the clutter of dupes and allows for them to be reallocated for useful other scenarios.
---
I prefer uranium fever, for legendaries, one violent night, horde events, enclave events, monster mash, and I try to do any daily that pop up for me if it's not too much trouble. 
---
But I'd recommend trying most if not all the events and get a feel for how they work and what you like. What you can do quickly and easily will be your best bet. Events shouldn't be the main focus, but they are a good little stop and complete for minor reward s and decent xp.
---
It was made by Bethesda.
---
Chainsaw
---
Drill
---
Syringer
---
Flare Gun
---
Black Powder Blunderbuss
---
Paddle Ball
---
Alien Blaster

Enclave Plasma Rifle

Also, a couple weapons like the pipe revolver or shovel are only available as legendary from the purveyor right now
---
Pfft. Welcome to Bethesda, where they will release ten year old games for $60 on new consoles with game-breaking bugs that were identified by players within the first week of launch.
---
then they only devote resources to the br mode due to so many people playing it. and then like what happened to fortnites non br mode the rest of fallout 76s development suffers. br would be the dominant thing and take away everything else. screw the popular game modes ruining games. im glad halo took a hard public stance against it.
---
More details on Hornwright:
---
When you enter, take the stairs up on the right, only one flight. You'll see the door to the stairwell in front of you. Take the stairwell all the way up to the top (Level 5). Go out the stairwell door, turn left, you'll see it against the wall.
---
Thank you I appreciate it. So there’s legendaries for boxing gloves? Shame about the chainsaw though. It’s a fairly weak weapon but woulda made for some fun builds with some good effects.
---
Just make it area! Server wide chat is cancer in any game. Area is amazing in any game. Prove me wrong.
---
You do know you can’t use multiple identical cards, right?  If you want anything past the initial +30%, you have to invest more.  Diminished returns for maximum possible damage.
---
My PS4 is just stupid, please forgive him.
---
In my opinion, just raw footage is fine. Most reviews you want to focus on the actual review of the game not the background. Fighting through a group of ghouls or even a scorchbeast Queen would provide good background while you cover everything, while cutting to certain thing when needed. For example, if you want to bring up weapon upgrades, cut to you upgrading a weapon and explain it. That's how I find reviews to be most helpful in my opinion.
---
Thanks so much
---
Not making excuses for anybody. Just tired of all the toddlers throwing tantrums in this sub.
---
No problem. Again, this is my opinion based of of the types of reviews I watch before deciding to buy a game. It may vary per person
---
Yeah, there's a few more that I probably forgot. Sherpherd's crook and sheepsquatch club come to mind. Protest signs, too
---
I feel like this could really work to help flesh out survival mode a bit. Start off factionless (free for all) but once you join a faction, everyone who is in it becomes friendly. Anyone who isn't apart of your faction becomes fair game. Though there would need to be a limit on how often you can faction hop, perhaps once a week. 
---
Also they could tweak how workshops work. Instead of one player controlled, it could be faction controlled and those in the faction each receive resources based on actively defending the workshop from other players/creatures.  Could even reward really good resources for holding workshops for certain intervals of time, like 30min - 1hour.
---
It still has a ridiculously low proc rate compared to every other disease, like they misplaced a decimal point or something.
---
I have perhaps the most unpopular opinion because I don't really like NV. Before the downvotes ruin me, It's just my opinion. I've played them all except the brotherhood of steel third person one. I even enjoyed tactics a fair bit.
---
I just... It MUST be okay for me to not like NV. 
---
Bethesdas storywriting isn't (nesrly) as sharp but their envirommental storytelling is exceptional. If one bothers to inspect and take in and above all walk, not run, walk, you'll find lots of story.
---
I just enjoy exploring bethesdas worlds more than the writing of NV. Plus the writing of NV is decent bit there are alot of things to complain about.
---
To me it's just different flavour ice cream. I like caramel, my best friend like chocolate and my wife doesn't like ice cream at all. Or fallout. Therefore fallout is ice cream.

---
The Best and Brightest by default, but I imagine if factions gets released you'd be given a rank/title/nickname based on the faction you choose.
---
I hope that's not their idea if BR is the main bulk of the dlc it will probably make a lot of people drop the game because of lack of actual content I mean I know plenty of people who stop playing the game until they see something interesting but if nothing ever comes they will probably just leave for good and play the other games that come out plus come on fallout 76 is not optimized for something like battle Royale at best it will be a downgrade so why would any one stick around when you have games that are actually suppose to be battle royale
---
Ah, so THAT's why everybody has been asking where to get one recently
---
But the challenges used to be simple....like killing a certain creature or just levelling up once without some random clothing. It's basically them squeezing out every possible $ they can from their players. They have advertised you as being able to enjoy the game solo or with players so why push players to have to find others. For every step forward there's been improvement and then a step backwards at the same time. It makes no sense to force players to do menial tasks for squat so they can save up in the Atom shop. No the goal is to make players pay to buy overpriced skins that apply to barely anything
---
That wasn’t yesterday was it? I totally didn’t do something like that for Crismson Flux
---
Hey man I am glad you believe that it is a possibility and if Bethesda do find a good way to implement it I would be more then happy to go and experience it out giving the option to other players means they can just give everyone every play bad karma wether it was good or not 
---
Keep believe man people like you get this kinda stuff into games
---
You had it wrong. They all proc the same rare. It's just the amount of durability restored that's different. Rank 3 restores like 20% ish. 
---
They all work but per attack trigger so not very good on auto.
---
i get that this is a game and it doesn't *necessarily* apply, but imagine if people had this mentality irl? "Why do you people lock your doors? i just want to use your stuff and relieve myself in your house, and i'm going to find a way in anyways so you might as well let it happen. Hell, if you didn't want people coming in your house, you shouldn't have such a nice house!"
---
Honestly part of it is a carryover from how i feel irl, i've had enough bad experiences with family and strangers alike that i *always* lock every door and window in my house, whether i am in the house or not and no matter how long or short of a time i'm going to be there, likewise i have had some bad experiences with assholes in fallout 76, and while i'm just chilling in my base building or crafting or whatever, i don't want to have to also keep an eye on whoever just waltzed in. Now that they've introduced pacifist mode and made bases indestructible in pacifist mode (i think?) this is less of a concern but at this point it's kind of hardwired in my brain that other players = trouble, and it's going to take awhile to unlearn that

Feel like the name should have somthing to do with green peace, pre war nature entuisests who would bring animals to this cage to presumably fight them
---
I had figured that they were going to give chainsaws an ability to harvest large amounts of lumber seeing as the damage was so poor compared to other melee weapons. Kinda wish they would give many less used/desirable weapon types more utility. For example having a drill equipped when repairing anything requiring screws to further increase the durability of said item at the expense of the drills durability.

my thoughts exactly ...this doesn't works as well on a cement wall

Isnt this literally the same arguement that people who thought Fallout 76 was going to be awful made?
---
Add me, Realest_Tiggas I’ll see what I can do to help you out!
---
Exactly. They will do whatever they need to make cash. They should fix the PvP before releasing  new competitive mode, though it's likely they'll release first and fix after.
---
Luckily there's still some of those guys who don't diss the game whenever they get the chance.

---
Tried... Very hard... I get my ass handed to me in one hit. If i could help i would.
---
It's so stupid, people hate on BR mostly because of the huge success of fortnite. It's a really successful genre because it's a good format and I think could bring a lot to the game. Fallout 76 is much more than a co op PVE game and so much the better for it.
---
I popped a Luck Bobble head yesterday abs they came to me left right and centre, give it ago.
---
I think the amount of ledges you see is limit to a character... E. G your allowed at least 10 a day. But if you team up with 3 other people you'll see 40.
---
More likely if its successful it will be the main focus for 76 and the main game mode will take a back seat like Fortnite/Save the World.
---
Fortnite originally never had a battle royale, used PUBG coding and put a battle royale mode in, now the main game I used to enjoy is dead in favor for the cash grab.
---
Man I bought that sweet. Red stove then learned I need plans also. Went on for over a week with a busted ass stove before I was told the plans are at the station... 30 ft from my camp lol. We have all been there ☺
---
EVERY LOST ITEM IS USER ERROR!!!! YOU DROPPED IT OR SOLD IT. Repeat after me: 'in Bethesda we trust x5'
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeé
---
I think fireproof and/or dense armor is a must have regardless of weapon.
---
If it’s a new game mode why does it matter? Just don’t play that game mode.
---
How to use a flair? When commenting?
---
They're not squeezing anything out of anyone. The cosmetics are entirely optional. 
---
You either like it enough to spend money on or don't. Bethesda isn't making you pay to access something that is core to the game play. 
---
This community is aburdly cheap. 
---
"We get free content which is nearly unheard of..... Which is great, but what's not great is that Bethesda makes it hard to earn premium currency, so we might have to buy some if we really want something...."
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeé!!!
---
What platform you play on?
---
With cheese.
---
Exactly this. 
---
Oh it's hard to earn premium currency for free? Shut up. The fact that there's anyway to earn free currency is more than many games offer.... It's obnoxious. If you like a cosmetic and you think challenges are too hard? Go buy some Atoms....
---
I'm not sure if it's entitlement or people just being cheap....
---
Xbox

17500 is as low as it will go. Pricewise charisma is softcapped at 20.
---
Indeed +100
---
Try grinding other toons to max level, it's a pain but each character has their own 150 scrip limit.  Hopefully they increase or get rid of the scrip limit soon
---
I data mined perks a while ago. I hope they are still relevant.
---
Also note that i dont know uif any bugs exist at the moment regarding them.

Nope, i won't beleive youtubers. Too much 76 hate.  
---
Although i will say juicehead, Oxhorn, and many a nerd (sp?) Have the fairest view.  Still a lot of gotcha titles.
---
Is this true? I’ve been way off then, like others in my team. Haha...:(
---
Small consolation, I can paint it for you, lol

I have bunker keys to the other two domes, just checked, sorry! Thought I could let you in. Someone else gave me the paint

Fortunately I am from Switzerland and have a pretty little flag thanks to the Fasnachtevent.
---
You found the real culprit to people’s so-called “phantom carry weight”
---
Fast travelling anywhere means everything has to load and enemies are last on the list. The amount of players present will slow loading times right down. It's quite a large problem at least at a couple of events and locations that really could use attention.
---
Yeah that's something we were considering at this point, 150 seems so insanely low, and it resets every 20 hours...so we spend about 1 hour a day playing and capping out on scrip and then we're just done :(
---
The problem is people calling for nerfs and balances just to suit them.
---
...too damn high...
---
“It just works”
---
Your brave to use a broadsider I got hold of a bloodied one as I've never used one before and now I know why it was terrible so just a heads up on it.
---
Yea this happens to me alot in survival mode. Leave because a battle is happening around my camp come back to same server with same battle destroying my camp. I think I logged in and out 5 times before I just quit and went to adventure to rebuild what's left of my camp.
---
That is EXACTLY the same problem I had! I was starting to wonder if it was just me!
---
I really want a door. I won’t lock it but it would just look pretty.
---
Sprinting drains them, power attacks drain them, using vats reeeally drains them. Learned this the hard way on my gunslinger. A minute in vats with gun-fu cost me at least 5 cores.
---
I stick with about 7k 55.6 as my daily route I can get a fair few at harpers ferry but I don't use it all the time so I can save up some.
---
Also mark lead and steel and gunpowder in your menu and get it from junk.
---
YongYea? Telling it how it is? Heh.
---
what if it's an actual story to point to BR? (also, isnt survival mode already a "BR"?)
---
Absolutely! I'm 136 now and I've already started reacquiring lower ranks of perks cards I already maxed out to use them in other builds.
---
I have a feeling that the Burrows was a sneak peek into what Nuclear Winter is. The Burrows was way too detailed to have such a small quest, and unique icon's for a map marker. Crazy thought: Nuclear Winter is exactly that, above ground is toxic, below ground travel in sewers, etc.
---
I think you mean Test *Commies*
---
Well he reports accurately based on numbers and other reports. Some people just hate on the game for clicks, at least he explains every fiasco that 76 has had so far.
---
Do I need to have both wasteland whisper and animal friend on to tame it or is it just one card?
---
too many resources get put into a new game mode,  resources better suited to making the main game better.  look how epic completely ditched fortnight pve in favor of BR
---
If you don't want me to release them I'll need 10 k caps leave it in a brown bag in a trash can at watoga station.
---
:)
---
I can agree with jim sterling being straight up most of the time but yongyea jumps with whatever the majority is going for as it gets the most views and likes. Hell never go against the crowd.
---
Get what you mean with the 1 stars, but if a 1 star bloodied handmade or level action shows up people are quick to buy em
---
Instead of Test Dummies... Test *Commies*
---
I just started locking up my camp but what I do is make the bottom look all homey and like a nice little shop then I make an upstairs area that has my generator and beds. My vending machines are all on the front porch and I have a back patio with tables and chairs to sit at. All my work tables are on the first floor and the water is free. My material collectors are also level 3 locked. I can see the need to lock materials and doors for roleplay purposes but idk. That’s just how I do stuff.
---
Same, have to go on spending spree's, mostly just buying items I know I can resell at a higher price
---
Great point. That’s a solid concern. I’ll see myself out.
---
Just spent 5k on a 3-star bloodied one the other day. I'm tired of my vats rifleman build and want to try something a little more fun. So that's why I decided to try making a half demo/bloodied melee build.
---
I know it's looked down upon a lot but as long as it can take out a level 68 ghoul outside of melee range I'll consider the job done. Anything else is a bonus, even if its just good chip damage until I get into melee range.
---
Unfortunately my character is only level 28 so it's going to be some time until I can test it out. But perhaps by then it'll either receive some kind of buff or meet my goals.
---
*lol, yeah i want to exploit this game so much!!!!* :D :D :D :D comeon*,* i just want to **collect loot** longer than hour a day, because i find it **relaxing**. HOARDERS UNITE AND DESTROY THIS SYSTEM! :D :D
---
Yong covers the same topics, but backs them up with references to other articles and quotes, rather than just rage about the subject for 12 minutes.
---
Also Jim Sterling covers pretty much the same topics Yong does, with an example being the Anthem debacle. So I find it odd that you say Yong jumps to the majority when thats what Jim does, cover relevant topics as the news emerges.
---
Is that so? I've actually been avoiding taming a Deathclaw because I was afraid someone would just come by and kill him/her. But I always play in Adventure Mode with Pacifist turned on.
---
They can do both. 
---
Like it or not (I certainly don’t), BR is popular, and not just with screaming 10yos. Before Fortnite had battle royale, it was just some crappy zombie defense game with way too many microtransactions that nobody cared about. Now look at it. Can you really blame anybody for trying to follow suit?
---
How does it feel out of your safe space manlet?
---
Holy shit yes, this and all these ideas need to be a thing.
---
I don't get any of this lol. It's not bold of me. I have a sloth. I've had many pets. They were killable before by other players. Since the pacifist camp update others cannot hurt them. Period. Only other creatures. So why don't you try it for yourself before you act like you know what you're talking about?
---
Green Thumb perk does not help with radkelp.  Wish it did though
---
The Reclaimers sounds cool lmao
---
I was on a server yesterday that wasn't bringing in new people. Ended up with the whole server between mate and I. Granted it was easy to maintain workshops but enemies ending up coming to trickle without all the other players spawning them in so very little to do actually. Not as good as you may think.
---
At least you get your weapons cheap.
---
Pump action shotgun is the only one I rarely see.
---
This is annoying as hell. I failed this for the first time yesterday because two Sheepsquatch showed up, so noticing I was the only one in PA and easily out damaging the other two guys in the event, I tanked both of the Sheepsquatch away from the Brahmin, and these other two asses just completely ignored the Brahmin and they died in seconds to the stupid bugs. Da fuck, man!?
---
I made a post about a possible solution.
---
My idea is to have the scrip and caps regenerate hourly at the same rate as the 20 hour period.
---
70 caps per hour at the vendors.
---
Increase the scrip cap to 160 and have it regenerate at 8 per hour.
---
Players who play little dint notice anything
---
Players who play an extended period a few times a week have an easier time managing this problem. Say you go and make dinner, come back and you can get rid of a few 1* items.
---
Or if you play after after work, you can log in before work to dump a few items.
---
And during your play session you can dump an item or 2 every hour.
---
The ammount you per day stays the same. But since you can use it more efficiently you end up getting a bit more, as you generally miss out on 4 hours each day if you have some sort of daily schedule.
---
The post was positively recieved but didnt get much traction sadly.
---
lol
---
lmao bethesda getting deeper into the shit pit
---
The Green.  Or The Green Ring?
---
Haha come on mate. Feeble and elitist. What a powerful combination of personality traits.

Dude not everybody can veg out and live in your gaming world. Your shit comments do nothing but express your discontent on life.

---
I charge 69 caps for everything across the board. Suck me.
---
Haha you'll be lucky!
---
I know right?  Couldn't hurt to try.
---
I was so gutted when I found this out. I thought nuclear winter was going to be a new proper survival mode with the difficulty ramped up.
---
I'm all in if it's that.
---
Possibly, Hell then Legion might not even exist post FO4.
---
I'm having fun with a bloodied railway rifle and crossbow at the moment got both of them from 3 star mireluks at the farm across from watoga station
---
Yep. I've had a ton of different pets and they were killable before the update. Mostly sloths which are hard to keep alive. People stop by my shop all the time, see the red health bar above it and shoot first and ask questions later. They might see damage happening, but it reverses immediately and doesn't even register on my screen. For some reason Deathclaws and sloths both still have "hostile" healthbars despite not being hostile to anyone.
---
Just know if you're on a team and someone in your group initiates PvP that the hostile person(s) can now kill your pet and destroy your camp.
---
Yep, I can confirm that. I got it at my second run (I don't know if I was really lucky).
---
I made one with small letters. People actually take notice of it!
---
As funny as it sounds I do wish I had one.
---
oh no dont show everyone my selfies!!!! 🥺🥺
---
Then make 3* legendary enemies rarer, just make them guarantee a 3* item otherwise the stars on enemies are completely irrelevant. What's the difference between a 1* ghoul and a 3* ghoul when they both die in the same number of hits and both drop a 1* item?
---
 *We're supposed to essentially be helping each other after we've left the vault*

All the people stealing your loot, destroying your CAMP and slapping you (if you dont want to trade, for example) support your point...

Honestly you’re lucky to have completed it at all. Most of the ones I’ve attended have failed. People are picking up on spamming the venison habitat though.

What I look for in a spot is water and a container. Water for my purifiers and a container to hold my junk in case I fast travel to an event
---
I agree with you as long as they have actual content for the rest of us because like you said the only way they are going to make me play BR is if they completely change how armor and weapons work and rebalance everything plus add your smart suggestions
---
Let me know if you are still willing to help, ive been dying to get these tadpole quests /challenges done :- )
---
Learned the hard way lol
---
I killed about close to a dozen today only got 4 meat
---
Too much 76 hate? Ph God forbid they criticize your game, justly, for having issues.
---
How does one manipulate where players spawn in their camp? I always worry about this because I have spawned under other people's camps and then have to use caps to teleport away and walk back.
---
Hehe that's a weird bug I've never heard of my it,so what happens if you use all the storage for photos maybe they delete the older ones.
---
This is only on your server. There are many of those.
---
i once spawned in a prison cell someone had made
---
Aim to the legs. His weakest spot
---
that woud be great
---
i don't see aan unruly golfer for months and then they all turn up at once
---
That may be good. Majority of this comunity are not progamers, so they don't care about legendary vending at all, I belive bethesda will eventualy increase daily scrip limit, as they do with stash one, but is better to remind them.
---
I dont know -- I had maybe 15 photos?  It is a total bummer. :(
---
I know, and it may be slim to run in to this person, wanted to give a heads up to people just doing the quest, didn't add name to make it look like a witch hunt.
---
I had all kind of diseases and they are not that problem in the end. All my characters use plague walker by now. Only the sniper does not. But rarely an enemy gets close enough to her. Getting a disease is so ridicolously easy that it makes no sense wasting time curing it. Just use it to your advantage.
---
For every event, everyone joining should somehow contributing, even by clear the small mobs. Their contribution should be taken into account. How about this suggestion? Bethesda implements a mechanism that in the event, if a player contributes enough by doing certain amount of damage to enemies spawning in the event, will be able to loot something in the boss (usually legendary) remains, even they do not do any damage to it.
---
The sub is one of the ways of comunicating ideas, frustrations and praises to the devs. A way of providing feedback.
---
Its an open marketplace for ideas, good and bad. The good nore often than not float to the top, the bad dont.
---
It has been a a long while since i read a post bashing the game for the sake of bashing the game, the large majority of the people here support what the devs are trying to do and are providing their point of view and feedback. To silence them would be to the detriment of future content.
---
yeah launching a nuke was never something we had to do
---
When I come back to camp I want my 4 purified water to be there ready and waiting for me to cook up into whatever.

they are in world containers but are very rare

---
New York is supposedly gone, but would love to tip toe through the ruins. For the purists, the Tsar Bomba wouldn't completely destroy  New York, and the bombs used in the fallout universe were about as strong as the ones dropped in world war 2 to my knowledge.
---
Could be just me but i'm honestly often as curious as shy when visit another camp lol.
---
If i see a pretty neat CAMP i run around the building check out the whole structure but the porch is like a alpha wall to me 😂
---
i know i need these two plans but the paradise event has failed or the game crashes so often when doing it that i have stopped trying to get into the event
---
Be careful, there's anti-ESO-feature suggestion people amok, I had to face one myself no matter how much sense it made to have the feature in the game.
---
I have all the coloured ones. After 2 months of server hopping and going up the 3rd floor. I had all the colours 2-3 times (the brown and white 10 times at least), but the Red i found it only once. It's really rare for sure.
---
WHAT??? CAN'T HEAR YOU *while browsing the 50th time things i don't want/need*
---
You can just... Not play it and wait for the next better DLC drop. That's what I'm doing.   
---
I'm not going to try and ruin it for people that might like a battle royale.
---
It's a deep wave, from some just \*astoundingly\* pretty houses (One that was built around a central tree that was growing in it, for example? Just faboo.) ... some smaller but \*super\* well-decorated ones. Other camps ... not so much. A tiny shack full of crafting benches and some vending machines plopped on the dirt, for example. Not many truly \*floating\* builds, but quite a few that are one foundation, stairs, and some weird antigrav thing that's at least connected to teh ground, if impossibly balanced.  
---
I've not seen many things lsotted for 25K ... a couple of weapons, some preserved pies, and a Snallygaster Explosion are all that I recall. Lots of stuff that's very, very overpriced. Sure, that Two-Shot Black powder Rifle is cool and all, but 8000 caps cool? No. Just ... just no.  
---
There have been a few good deals... I've picked up a few treasure maps at junk prices (like, 10 caps!), some outfits that I was missing for under 25 caps, and I've snapped up quite a few legendary weapons for trade-in.... sell a 1-star weapon for under a hundred caps and I will \*always\* buy it, no matter what it is. Lead pipes, pipe wrench, a level 5 wood arm?  Here's teh cash, happy to do my part. I've brought my own legendary prices down a lot to try and match what I see out there ... in general, 500 a star for something that's good enough to go into teh scrapper if a chest piece, half that for arms or legs.   
---
I managed to pick up all the Hologames today for 100 each (happily!) ... it doesn't count towards the quests, sure, but they're nic eto have since I've been \*terrible\* at finding magazines out in teh world. Just the \*worst\*.   
---
My personal worse problem is that I can only have 4 vending machines. I have over 200 DIFFERENt plans to sell and roughly a hundred food recipes. They need good homes! I don't make a single cap of profit on any of 'em! I bought, say the Small Letters stack four times from Grahm over time, before the (KNOWN) tag was added. Now, I'm selling them for a tenth of what he did. You want tea? Pie? You name it, I've probably got a spare recipe for it. Over 100 pounds of plans and recipes in my storage, right this minute, and I can't get them all in machines at the same time, let alone them plus the OTHER stuff people want, like shotgun shells, fusion cores, and health stuff. All 120 slots are full and ready to sell, but there's hundreds more where that came from, waiting for a turn.  
---
Madness I tells ya!  
---
Madness.
---
I just pop a load of antibiotics problem solved
---
plus the two new nuka cola flavors means that the collector one can't be completed
---
Gonna keep it short: I won't bother, since your attitude is beyond unnecessary.
---
try to stick that CAMP terminal on solid ground
---
if they could get enemies to drop their guns in fallout 4 why not in this
---
I've only done it 2 times, and both times we managed to complete it.
---
The first time only 2 of 3 creatures survived (and they were really low level), and I got the Formula P recipe as a reward. The second time only 2 of 3 survived again, but this time they were much more stronger (we had a Glowing Deathclaw in there).
---
THE SIGN!!! lmao
---
It's like setting your favorite song as an alarm clock :p
---
where abouts i always get molemen and liberators in the ash heap
---
oh that reminds me,  i saw a fully floating house, the only thing touching land was the vending machine and power cable
---
for immersion purposes it could be implemented as a pipboy tab
---
SBQ
---
Exit build mode and go back in usually helps. I had a height limit in one spot but no others, just try placing it somewhere else if nothing else works
---
My last scorchbeast queen fight saw me use 18 plasma cores.  12 of those had 2 - 10 shots available.
---
I was wondering if that did make a difference. I've started putting mine in my (open) crafting area.
---
it's a good place to check
---
Why not both?
---
Really? Just to be clear, I’m not looking for the “prime” plan for it, the actual plan is the “Ultracite Gatling Laser”, some people get confused by the different types, I’ve done the queen loads and never got one so far
---
Actually, I wouldn’t mind a Battle Royal mode. Sounds like fun
---
i try to watch where people spawn in and reference where i had put the little station node at,  then adjusted.  my vending machines are on a cliff and my CAMP terminal is also on the cliff.  so they spawn next to a camp fire up there.
---
Here is a good site that you can try out.

Near the Red Rocket, sorry I can't remember which direction from it. But I always find a LVL 21 one there, and until yesterday never dropped a hide but does everytime I kill it now. I don't know if it matters that I'm on a team but I always kill it alone, when I get a hide.
---
I get we dont want a BR in fo76, but jeez the unnecessary fortnite hate is getting old
---
In for when I get home
---
Seriously. Hate them all you want but ever since watching Battle Royale and Hunger Games I feel like we have all wanted a game like that.
---
i was actually about to make a thread asking if they could allow us to outright scrap ammo. my .38 stock of 4000  isn't ever going to sell , no one ive come across uses this ammo
---
I kinda think pvp servers have just been an experiment for battle royal to fine tune balancing. I have zero interest in it personally but with how easy it is to swap servers where if you want to do quests then you'll go onto adventure and if you want pvp you'll go take your same character into pvp I think they want to condense pvp where it'll be more useful and not have to run so many world servers for it
---
TIL: You can price generic plans at 10 caps and people STILL won't buy them. I'm about to give them all away. Magazines are the same - 5 to 10 caps and almost no sales. 3 star legendaries are not selling at 1500. Doofuses selling \*anything\* above 1500 caps probably don't sell them. Some crafty people are getting with it and you can now buy 1 and 2-star legendaries for under 500 caps.
---
Wake up people, your stuff is not worth what you think.
---
I think a battle royale would be pretty awesome.
---
I'm using it sometimes but i never crafted it nor i will pay one cap each 😅.
---
to be fair, I (and many, many, many other players) leave easily acquired plans and recipes in suitcases...or sell for free...or give to low level players.  
---
And not a huge amount of low level players are seeming to going directly to vendors before they get them off of other players or during their own wandering time.  
---
I have seen just dumb crap at player vendors -- plans for chemistry benches, or recipes most people pick up before level 15 for 100 caps.  Those will sit in the vending machine, taking up space.  I have been largely disappointed by what others think is a fair price for items.  Especially very common ones.  
---
There is a happy medium to be found where our allotted vendor space can be utilized and filled with what others need/want most.  
---
I stock my 2 machines with the idea of "how easy is it to acquire?  what do players use most?  is it costly to craft?"
---
You can't get into my home
---
That's what I expected. Maybe if we could have factions we could keep each other safe?
---
That's something often comes to my mind when reading the 100's discussion about if Fo76 is solo/mmo/PVE/PVP... Fallouts core is suppose to be RP.
---
It's shouldn't be about the best gear to pvp, the god builds etc.
---
It should be - you and how to handle the wasteland, alone, working together with others no matter if you decide living the raider lifestyle, be a lone scavenger by heart or help build up /take care of other appalachians in some kind of responder way.
---
If there were more s.p.e.c.i.a.l mechanics like the (AGI 5) option with the toxic barrels daily would be great too.
---
Agreed.
---
Just be thankful it's not the onyx egg...
---
Agreed. I see no issue with a side battle royale multiplayer mode that we can occasionally have some fun with.
---
i might just set the price to 0
---
You can't just say that. Can you not see how ignorant that is to say? Based on that ignorant nonsense assumption i'm just going to assume you're really bad and glad you don't have to prove it since you're on ps4. Noob.
---
Good to know and thanks for the tip!
---
That's what I'm doing for giveaway items, stash space is my biggest issue with that otherwise i will list more stuff for 0 caps rather then putting it in to give away sack at White spring station
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Do events in the cranberry bog. Ive gotten two from census violence event so that is your best bet.
---
Ah great, thanks dude!
---
You can't even fucking 1 shot anymore I don't understand why people think this. The only way you're getting 1 shot is if you are the bloody build.
---
If my prices are too high.... I don’t sell. If my prices are low... I sell out and have nothing to sell. I try and run a good store! ;)
---
Civil war top hat, plague hat, hunters long coat and black shovel backpack. Gives a nice steampunk look ^^
---
I think there's always been a problem of FO76 uninstalling itself. Was a major problem a while back so it shouldn't occur anymore.
---
Also, it's an online game. Your character data should be perfectly safe.
---
It would be great to get a bonus perk for maxing a stat.  
---
15 END = highly resistant to diseases
---
15 STR = can FT while overencumbered
---
15 PER = enemies highlighted, including their corpses
---
15 CHR = whisper a creature to become a mobile stash
---
15 INT = can use weapons/armor you pick up to fix weapons/armor of same type
---
15 AGI = max AP increased
---
15 LUK = reroll a legendary once a day
---
Just some ideas.  I know some are from previous titles, but yeah just fun to brainstorm.
---
They've clearly said melee, are you suggesting they bash their way around?
---
Nah
---
The only thing that will keep me away from it is if they allow people with insane Legendaries that are perked with bonus damage beyond belief to be able to go against level 15 people still trying to figure their shit out.
---
While pricing an item whatever price you want is fib6e, iop it's immoral to price 1 star legendaries at like 3k caps. I've seen it twice today where people will go to the starter area and set their camps up their with terrible 1 star weapons for fairly large prices (given most players levels an lack of game knowledge in the zone).
---
If I ever see low level players at a shop, and I see those kinda items, I'll warn them, or at least tell it's not worth their caps.
---
Well you can have a mtf character that still looks manly and can wear the proper gendered clothes
---
I usually play the game high and seriously went about 20 levels thinking high me was accidentally picking the same cards before I realized the stupid game gives you repeats. 😆
---
They patched that out ages ago.
---
Highest I've been able to take it is level 2 and that was with 3 other people in there.
---
Nuka Colas should be the currency after you cap. Currency with some thirst!

This has to be a joke.
---
There are other audio files than just that one. Most of them sound VERY much like battle royale.
---
I just mute the radio and play music from iTunes. \*shrug\*
---
This must be karma bait right here.
---
That's the best text chat implementation idea I've heard so far!
---
I doo (it would help late game players have something to do)
---
I mean, I'd be down with it, honestly.
---
Black prospectors hat !!

The Wacky Wastelanders. The Rambunctious Reclaimers. The Perpetually Perplexed Postapocalyptees. The Exasperated Ex-Emergers. The Cynically Confounded C.A.M.P.ers. The Substantially Sulky Survivors. The Gaudy Glowing-Golfclub-Ghoul Gutters.

Yeah, sure, whatever you say.
---
But it can...you just have to buy them from a particular vendor.

either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones.
---
Idk I kinda wanna see it happen. I think it'd be cool, it they were already planning on it
---
Regular bait more like...
---
I mean where are the other genders...? Well they don't exist just like in real life.
---
Captain obvious....
---
Sorry, but that kind of advises doesn't help - as long as items are being bought, the price was fine. I trade a lot on both trade subreddits and I usually value vendor machine items a little more (around 10-20%) than on subreddits and they still sell like crazy - example fluxes - I price them 70 for all except violet (which is 130) and in vendor machine I value them 100/150 and usually they're gone within hour. And while exploring other players vendor machines I've seen them for 350 per piece!!
---
I can advice only three things - please, review spawn place in your camp and move the objects accordingly - I can't count situations where I spawn in the middle of wall or basement and can't move, which force me to fast travel to nearest location. I guarantee I won't come to that vendor again. Another thing is, PLEASE, don't place decontamination shower in the doorway without switch off - I play high-radiation bloodied build and don't want to loose my radiation. Third is put you machines outside the building - if I would like to visit your lovely house I'll do it anyway, don't force me to run three floors and countless corridors to find one lousy machine with few stimpacks and plans that everybody has...

Gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8
---
I just sold 16 stimpaks at 15c a piece. 10c is even more reasonable than mine.
---
This seems like really bad satire and it's not funny
---
How about just open up vault 76 to have this all the time but no reward other than safety
---
I want a non binary gender, and clothing
---
Do I look like a joke to you?
---
This is an english subreddit
---
It's very rare and usually people don't want to sell it for caps. I've paid 45k for mine (I'm on PC).
---
It's not even satire, I fear that this could breed a toxic community
---
yeah why i waited a long time before buying the game. it was fine never random crashes or lags. my only 2 problems i ever had was sever dropping and after rejoining a new server my character is effected.
---
1) i drop all loot gained within a few min of the server dropping (mainly when im doing a quest it puts me to the point of just starting it when i was usually more then half way.)
---
2) all amour and clothes have unequipped
---
3) recent perk cards changes disappear
---
4) my level or xp level changes e.g i have dropped a whole level once and the other i dropped about half ex i gained in that session.
---
That is English.
---
I've just tryed delivering 4 at a time and it was the first time I actually got a plan since November ( not activily doing this everyday), got the First BOS Paint
---
Dude!! That's exactly what i mean!! I don't reload. I just burn the cores until they're out. I'm positive something is bugged
---
On one hand, it completely goes against the story of 76, rebuilding Appalachia. On the other, **money** 
---
Really hope it isn't a battle royale, worst game genre
---
Seems like bait to me
---
Especially cola machines. It might just be me but I feel like they aren't cola spawns. I might be wrong but that logic keeps my manners and morale high
---
That has nothing to do with anything
---
Althought I like it for immersive reasons, I do think it'll be quite cumbersome to open up the pipboy and go to the designated tab just to see/reply to text chat. :/
---
Your post? Yeah, totally. And i r8 8/8
---
nice troll topic, but no, there are only two genders. And there are enough abominations in the game already...
---
You sound like a friend of mine who used to hate CoD because it's popular and denying anything fun about it like the Zombies mode. Hating on League of Legends because it's popular and denying anything they did for esports and that it is a great game
---
 Hating on Fortnite because it's popular and denying that it's fun and interesting. Hating on Destiny because it's popular denying anything fun about FPS looter and the amount of work and passion was put into all of these games. He's basically hating on everything that is popular and is taking the industry by storm like MOBA, FPS, BR, Arena Shooters, Looters or a combination of those.
---
You are absolutely hating on Fortnite because it's popular. I don't like Battle Royale either, which means I don't like any Battle Royal-heavy game, but it doesn't mean I should go around saying nobody likes it or that the game is trash. You act like the ones who hate on Fallout 76 and us, the players, because we prefer this type of soft survival RPG gameplay instead of the more popular ones.
---
Get your shit together friend. Try to think for yourself. And avoid any interaction with circlejerk subreddits and 4chan.
---
Some things are. I’ve had a lot of success selling explosive weapons and 3* weight reduction armor for thousands of caps. But that’s because those things are top tier, just below god-rolls (which are typically trade only). The players who buy my explosive gatling gun for 3-5k are the kind of players who have too many caps anyways and wouldn’t mind an upgrade. And I’m happy to spend that much myself if it’s something I’ll use. 
---
Basically, it takes game knowledge to sell things correctly. But in general you’re right... most things just wont sell unless you price them very very low.
---
All I know is that someone in January did the math for PS4 using extrapolation on no. of people that got a specific trophy vs. % of total population, and the PS4 player count back then was around 400k. As for other platforms I've no idea, but this guy suggested that the PS4 player base historically is the largest. Of course, take it with a grain of salt with those console plebs... :-)
---
Every aspect of your post screams ignorance. Learn some respect.
---
Never has given me anything good. The only time I shot him is when he told me I owed back taxes after giving me a prize. DON'T TREAD ON ME!
---
random drop from Cranberry bog events
---
Gender Fluid, Non binary, Hermaphrodite, Custom (So we can choose which gender we are)
---
This is the kind of bigotry I was talking about, we cannot let the far right prevail!
---
No. They still have a sonic scream but they're the highest level pet you can tame at level 30.
---
Yup.
---
Event ends a couple seconds after the sheepsquatch dies, even if the cows are still being attacked.
---
The event location in the top left only spawns one level 50 sheepsquatch, so that's where I go when I want to solo it. I can always kill it before any of the cows die. At the other locations, I might lose a cow if more than one sheepsquatch spawns.
---
Kinda why PvP is also just as trash. Why play that game-mode where the ones who dupe are the ones who are god-tier. Theres no balance or variety in Survival. Just god-rolls and boring engagements. 
---
This is why Fallout 76 is a PvE game with role-play pvp moments. Itll never be a serious pvp game. Those who want a serious pvp game should look for other titles. I get my pvp fix from HotS or ESO.
---
what we need is more server stability and less game chrashes, everything else its 2nd if you ask me. 
---
I would love for BGS to take one or 2 weeks with just patches for bug  and for them to test thier new content before they roll it out. after sure you can have all the genders you want, shit you can be a rolling pin as character if you want.
---
You do realise gender is not a set thing right? You cannot tell me what gender I am, or someone else is
---
No shit? News to me.
---
I have never come close to max caps, and I play probably 8-12 hrs a week. The max caps people are the overly dedicated types and those trading on reddit. The most caps I've ever had was maybe 8000.
---
I suggest you scrap your 1 star legendaries for scrip unless its something rare like explosive, sentinel, bloodied, two shot, etc. I also wouldn't suggest going above 500c for a 1 star. With the legendary vendor its just not really worth the spending thousands of caps, especially when others are selling better 2-3 legendaries for 2000-3000c.
---
Abandoned Bog Town workshop has a lot of acid. For steel, clear Westtek even just the outside and scrap all of the weapons with the scrapper perk.
---
Hope not. It turned out soooooo well being shoehorned in to Battlefield V after all...
---
Thank you for positive message
---
If you say so 😉
---
I'm hoping that it is simply a harder different version of Adventure Mode. 
---
You come out of the vault after being advised by the game to wear a supplied radiation suit, and the entire place is in a nuclear winter. Basically like having a special environment mod that changes the entire landscape and a weather mod that changes the weather to one of nuclear winter. And it will play different, stuff will be more scarce outside, the radiation is permanent like the entire map is a half strength nukezone and all the creatures still alive will be big mean glowing irradiated bastards who will tear your face off.
---
The joke is usually funny once, another time isn't. Stop ridicule yourself...
---
You are winner!
---
I don’t play survival so I care that something I want more of (Fallout in general) will be a mode that I’m not going to have anything to do with. If there’s a bunch of lore or cool quests that there’s an option not to engage in some type of PVP.
---
It didn't uninstall really, it just got confused. Go to reinstall it and select the same folder where you last had it; it'll figure itself out and realize the files are still there. My game does this every other month.  It says "installing" for about a minute and boom, games back where it should be; progress and all.
---
When society is almost dead, the social norms are not applicable. You can be whatever you want. Everyone is equal when they emerge from Vault 76 and only their experience builds their character. I would say this is the ultimate game in this aspect. 
---
If you wish different clothes etc. You can always create and send Bethesda your outfit ideas. And if it's a ready 3d model created in their environment, they will probably include it faster.
---
However lore wise, everyone is too occupied to survive the end of the world and the scorch plague, so no designers are available at the moment.
---
You cannot debate Science!
---
There are no genders in the game though, only medically defined sex, male or female. It doesnt assume any gender thereafter...
---
How often does it drop? I've done dozens of events in the bog, probably census violence by itself at least 10 times. Now that we have legendary ultracite gatlings I really need to learn those mod plans
---
Assuming gender is the root to bigotry
---
think about it, its a business that its main source off income (fo76) is having players using atmos in game right. so having players login every increases your chances (BGS) for ppl to use atoms. 
---
nothing more nothing less.
---
I see where your coming from (kinda) but this is genuinely a lively community so I don’t think it’s a huge issue here, everyone is very nice generally and even the “complaints” posts are worded more like a polite email to a boss than an internet rant :D
---
Exactly, thats why the game ignores gender altogether. Just sex is selected, nothing more
---
I've run it four times. Three were successes. I've gotten two Formula P plans and a bear arms thingie.
---
For free? I only remember it as a bundle. 
---
I am so jealous. I wanted that camo but because of reasons too complicated to get into I only recently found a way to buy atoms. 
---
Shortly after I had seen some one with it and it looked every bit as good as I thought it would.
---
Good idea, thanks!
---
and thank you for your possitive feddback lol
---
If this is becoming an issue for you then spend an hour server hopping people's shops for great gear. I find a plethora of good gear not for overly pricey. 
---
I run 2 accounts and all my characters are near the cap limit so I have to spend time jumping around looking for good gear. I've completely outfitted my 2 characters in near perfect armor and great weapons. My hunt for a god roll plasma rifle continue.
---
Why even post this, you know this is bait for anger lol take it down
---
So if they don't have XY or XX then what chromosomes do they have that make them different from male and female.
---
The world may have ended, but I am still polite enough to close doors. Even if I only pass through camps.
---
Also the abundance of materials I have, allows me to repair turrets and generators.
---
Nice lever action
---
Just putting it out there, but isn't the lore behind the ZAX unit, pretty much a battle royal type situation? He pits the vault into different factions and they basically fight to the death. 
---
Seems like a way to both catch the battle royal hype train while bringing in a few new features. Imagine having to side with one faction and fight a huge battle royal, vault dungeon style, taking out all other factions while being forced to the center where you would have to destroy the ZAX computer and win.
---
Might as well mark as discussion too
---
If only we could drop items to the ground to display them, liket he other fallout games. Instead they're in paper bags. Iunderstand why, imagine 14 players, all their houses having a bunch of bathtubs filled with Quantums, gold bars, etc etc. Probably lag the server something fierce.
---
I hope they don't alow transfer to the royale mode like the PVP mode and hope it does just dump us in the map with a vault 51 suit and a slap on the ass
---
I had more pvp encounters in adventure than in pvp mode for weeks now. 
---
you want pvp in adventure claim a workshop or go after someone elses workshop, easy as that.
---
Yong needs a shower.
---
#showeryong
---
I have skulls on spikes, and I've never had to lock my door. The only unwelcome visitors I've had never bothered with the doors and just started destroying walls.
---
well damn that sucks, I dont use trapper gear so I didnt know for sure, i was just trying to help. lol
---
I think ive done that event a maybe 50 to 60 times in total so not that rare if you compare it to some event outfits. Fyi some good mod plans are sold in watoga, and what plattform are you on? I can mod it for you if you are on PC.
---
Wait, how? Is there a way to write notes?
---
I'll probably get downvoted, but I couldn't care less about the repair kit thing.  It's a mechanic that was never in the game in the first place, and I never run around with 1 gun regardless.  I actually got several repair kits from drops and have never found a use for them.
---
Personality
---
I've bought an unyielding/powered/sentinel chest for 24k. 
---
Bought an explosive Gatling laser for 3k and sold it for 20k. 
---
Sold off my TSE handmade, combat rifle and pump action for 10-15k each. Paid 3k for each back in January. 
---
Bought a ghoul slayers explosive cryolater for 3k and sold it for 10k. 
---
Bought 2 Junkies hunting rifles for 2k each and sold both for 10k each. One JE, the other junkies/FFR/faster reload. 
---
I spend my time buying up great gear from other players, testing it for myself, adjusting my build to fit the weapon if I like it, or selling it later. My friends list is ever growing so I'm ever trying to restock my shop with great weapons. 
---
My 2 played characters have amazing armor and weapons. And I love every single aspect of this game now. Except the crashing.
---
Textures set to medium.
---
I love that the actual white powder jumpsuit doesn't work.....at white powder.
---
I had to find a sky outfit.
---
That's what I was thinking.  I started creating plasma cores at the tinkerer's bench and I may be wrong, but I remember seeing 500 shots available on the first core I loaded.  I might be mixing it up with my laser gatling but that usually has 640 shots on a full fusion core.
---
Fun thought, if someone doesn't like the idea of a BR mode in Fallout they could just uhh... \*checks notes\* not play that mode.    
---
Weird huh.
---
LOL are you serious. GG bethesda!
---
Changed flair to discussion, this post is actually not bait. I want all of my frens to stay safe online, and get no homophobia. A few months ago they played this game and was hunted down like jews by some alt right nazis on this game, they was shook for weeks on end.
---
After joining a faction you have to leave and wait for something like 48 hours before joing another faction. They would have to try to balance the servers. On them there shouldn't be more than 30-40 % of players of a single faction.
---
But it could work.
---
Not a group but I do know what to do I soloed it a few runs ago lol
---
i used to have a 2x2 tent blueprint and i'd just drop my camp whenever i needed it (because i was always overencumbered), but that gets way too expensive.
---
building a house that fits the surrounding geography is much nicer than having a template that can be everywhere but fits nowhere....
---
With all 3 animals alive?
---
Probably Jet, it gives him the jitters.
---
huh I got it by chance when i just explored the mansion.. I didn't even know about the quantum armor just suddenly found a tnt key in the basement on the pedestal..
---
Thanks man
---
....why? Did they take a look at your male/female character model and know your sexual orientation? Quit your lying and get off this subreddit
---
I believe there are only two genders , that aside, you dont really need the game to assign those to you when you can do it yourself. Plus most clothes arent gender specific any more
---
The oversleepers.
---
Lots of people can't seem to grasp this, that these studios are huge and full of lots of people working on many different projects at once.  Meanwhile, many of these programmers also often specialize in different parts of the game, so the people making PvE content are likely not the same people that would be making a game mode like this.    
---
You see this same kind of commentary when a game "needs optimizations" and they put out more story content.  It's not like the games level designers and asset artists and story creators are the same people who are going to improve the netcode.
---
No everytime I run someone let’s one die , I managed to keep two alive
---
It's pretty divisive, I personally find it pretty distracting in other games. No matter how it's implemented I'll be happy as long as I can turn it off.
---
I think the stimpack diffuser only drops if all 3 stay alive
---
I am on PC, but I'm just planning ahead. I got a legendary one already but scripped it since it had no good effects
---
What’s that for ? And tbh I just want the backpack skin lmao , how do you get that how many need to be alive or what
---
LIBERTY PRIME: ACTIVATED
---
The stimpack diffuser heals groups or possibly whoever is nearby, I'm not entirely sure.  And when I got my backpack it was a run where all 3 were kept alive too.
---
They could also add server-wide chat throughout the personal terminals. That would be truly immersive! Once you're outside, you can't chat. Once you're at your C.A.M.P and connected up, you could chat with other responders!
---
- Plus most clothes arent gender specific any more
---
It needs to be ALL clothes, there is no such thing as a gender specific outfit
---
Can't kill any enemy's *what*?
---
so in our biology there is 2 different chromosome pairs. one for male and one for female. there are no other genders!
---
the other thing is what you feel. you can feel like you are a wolf, a cat or a combo of male/female plus all the things ive never heard about. but it will never make you a wolf for real.
---
hope this is a troll...
---
cheers
---
Can't stand music while playing, I need to hear the environment and the audio queues around me.
---
I always close doors when I leave someone's camp too! I feel weird if I don't.
---
Server chat is actually pretty chill in SCUM. Js
---
Second this, I never really been into YouTubers but Riflegaming is one of the few watchable ones imo. One of the few who's voice doesn't grate on me either lol, plus his videos are always to the point and don't ramble a ton to enchance that ad revenue.
---
So you can decide what gender I am? How
---
Gotcha ty for info n I got event on rn if you have someone I haven’t started it yet
---
No slap damage, you are invulnerable... How can you be killed?
---
Disaster just brings to mind death, destruction, decay, etc. The first color I would associate it with would be ash-gray. All of the irradiated flowers in this game have bright colors and some kind of "vibrant" names to match that
---
Ok, but if one drop for me when im doing my event runs, i will let you know.
---
Yep real science there 🤣
---
Yes I am proud, hence why we need PRIDE vault suits at the start of the game so we can express ourselves
---
Can we just mute ALL the music in the game pls
---
i can open the dome for you and you can have the plans or I can paint it for you.  GT is the same as here
---
Thanks but I don't see the point of running it without at least a decent size group where everyone knows what they're doing.
---
I can confirm this as well. If you place brick doorwalls you can put them back to back and then use the replace option when selecting them to turn them to normal walls.
---
Doesnt have to be far right because they disagree.
---
Scout armor bugs:
---
1. Same name for limb and torso mods.
---
2. Some mods are for arms and legs and so can't be applied because the armor arms and legs are marked "limb", not "arm" or "leg".
---
3. The urban left arm piece has lower DR than the right arm.
---
Getting the right mods is a total server hopping pain.
---
But that doesn't stop me wearing a full set just for the looks.
---
Idiot
---
Nope. Too difficult to code. Too easy to abuse.
---
i didnt say any of this. the nature decides. it depends on the gender of the sperm connecting to the ovum. where i am from we learn this in the school. but im sure you will find out where to read about this to check for yourself. in these books there is a lot of other interesting stuff you might be interested to read :)
---
Sure mate will you be online in about a half hour
---
There's a difference between having a debate on a very debatable topic, and just plain gender denial
---
How, in adventure mode, can he kill you?
---
If he shoots you just ignore him.
---
Fuck no.
---
Just wait for the vault raids to cost caps to start. Encrypted already does, too bad it doesn't guarantee a 3*
---
Nature doesn't decide a preference, atleast that's what I've been told
---
Had a similar problem with a CAMP in the Ash Heap at a Black Titanium deposit. I don't know how many times I fell into that hole trying to get Black Titanium Scrap out of the extractor and had to fast travel out, but hey, I have well over 250 Black Titanium Scrap now and pretty much never have to farm it again.
---
I agree, and that futuristic look makes them take up a lot of floor space too.
---
I have no decent place to put it in my camp without it being in the way. :(
---
ohhhhh.... currently re installing in a new hardrive oops ahahah
---
For steel your best bet is to hit places with a lot of super mutants,scorched or mole miners and use the scrapper perk on what you loot. Assault rifles give around 20ish steel each, miniguns and missile launchers about 20-25. Blackwater mine, West Tek or Camden Park are usually pretty good for this. As for acid anywhere that spawns yao guais as they drop it. There are a few dead lootable ones around ( Front of Whitespring, Abandoned Waste dump and a couple of fissure sites ). Also anywhere snallygasters spawn. There's always 3 at Toxic Larry's, and sometimes they're at Abandoned Bog Town, Charleston, Toxic Dried Lake or Kiddie Corner Cabins. Next best sources are Bloodbug proboscis or abraxo cleaner. Whitespring or Fort Defiance have a bit of abraxo lay around and there's usually one or two in the Freestates bunkers.
---
a BR mode will bury this game deep.
---
Vault Tec jump suits are a company uniform to represent vault Tec. It has absolutely nothing to do with gender and everything to do with vault Tec
---
That's some slap worthy shit right there
---
Edit: Just read the not killing bit. If in doubt use power armor and a melee weapon like All Rise, saves ammo :)
---
okey thanks time to go hunting deathclaws
---
which one?
---
This is all so cringey. Relax.
---
Your post does, sweetheart.
---
What's to say the character you choose in game, isn't one of those.
---
Kill the scorched minions that spawn and I think they'll have a higher chance if not guaranteed to land
---
nature decides in the same moment the pregnancy happens. this is all some crazy stuff happen there and its really interesting. so i highly recommend to read about these things.
---
So you're telling me vault tec had no pride?
---
No one's said what gender you have to be. You are literally arguing with yourself lmao. No surprise.
---
Gold.
---
Please keep your idiocy to yourself.  Thanks.
---
I wonder why this isn't higher up. 
---
Let Bethesda do their road map and just wait for the content you want that will come after.
---
OP shouldn't be generalizing for everyone like this after one other post made it to the front page with tons of upvotes; when the comments on that thread were people who were either semi-open to a BR mode or just indifferent to the possible media backlash, which is what seems to be the main concern here.
---
Yeah my friend could not unlock the challenge. So much for one of the hardest to find outfit on the game.
---
At least tattered field works as raider outfit.
---
I've been in the same spot for months. Nobody else used that spot. Never needed to swap server cos someone else was already there.
---
Not until player vending arrived, now some of my visitors are moving camp to that spot. :-(
---
&gt;  because any big boss I fight my guns break at least once
---
My level 10 alt broke her gun during *Campfire Tales* last night.  That was the first time it's happened in maybe 3 months.  What are you doing that your guns break *every* boss fight?
---
I'd rather they just scrap the terrible card system( who ever thought it was a good idea, clearly doesn't have a clue) and reimplement the old school perks/skill system.
---
Have no idea why they ever moved away from it.
---
I dont see a problem with it because it can just be another gamemode. People can choose whether to play it or not
---
Jeeze, everything is getting a BR (possibly). This trend needs to die. BRs are only fun for maybe a day. Heavy RNG and it's always against me. Same thing every match, everyone uses the same load outs, camp until final circle. Doesn't make for a fun game mode, and I'm tired of seeing so many BR games come out. I'm happy I play my games on ps4, so the BR library is small.
---
This is a new social movement at this point, petitions are going up for bethesda to do this even!
---
Well, my bottom floor is a single room with a staircase and a door, the 3 vending machines are on the outside against all 3 walls aside from the wall with the door, it's the first thing that people see upon walking up to my camp so it doesn't really apply to everyone. I can show screenshots if you'd like to see it.
---
The character is me
---
Not really, but battle royale is last man standing.
---
Survival is just deathmatch
---
I hope this is changed as OP described even if that means I have spent 50 fucking levels for nothing.
---
Im hoping for anything but competitive gamemodes, its a roleplaying game so keep it that.
---
Keep scrapping. It's just a luck
---
You two are arguing at cross purposes.  Looks like both of you need to work on your reading comprehension.
---
the current one is very bulky, if it's depth(?) was reduced so it could be more flat against a wall I'd be happy
---
Without killing go for tin cans - they hang in chimes and each give you 2 steel and 1 lead. There are a lot of those in whitespring golf club, crevasse dam and few more on the back of sons of dane compund.
---
I proudly wear the Mistress of Mystery garb. That's all the support I can give.
---
All the above would result in people doing nothing but going for a coffee, waiting for a reward for participating. Like they already do in many events such as Free Range.
---
I sadly don't got much melee skills and my only good melee weapon is a ghoul slayers machete
---
No I was defending my side and he realized and already commented that it was happening. Good job though
---
I am glad to hear you express yourself, not enough people can come out  &lt;3
---
I do
---
Not too difficult to code at all. There's a mod in Fallout 4 that does just this, based on what you loot, how much you fire your gun, how much chaos and killing you do, it spawns a "hitman" nearby that tries to attack you every now and again. 
---
The easy to abuse is the real problem. I'm not sure how you could abuse it though, there's braindead checks you can put in place to stop it. LIke the most a playe can have sent after them are 3 a day, or only ONE assassin at a time can hunt a player down.

Least give constructive criticism to why you believe in your thoughts, that it's too easy to abuse. For sure it's not too hard to code at all, every other Fallout game has mods that just do INSANE things. Before you say that "oh well those are single player games" Skyrim has  mod that allows people to play together, that's changing so much of the actual structure of the code of the game, it wouldn't be hard at all for Bethesda to do it.
---
They can't fix it because it shouldn't exist.  The bug is not the vanishing star, the bug is creating the impossible weapon/armor.
---
If you get 3* wood or a assaultron head you should scrip it immediately.
---
I would just like custom flairs. IDK, the mods are never gonna make an Operation Tourniquet flair.
---
Nope, can't have that, then people would be able to get all their scrip and legendary rolls done for a day in a much shorter time. Shorter time on the game means people are bored with it, can't show that our investors. 
---
Gotta make the game as grindy as possible so they can put it in their statistics that people are having "fun". Since (playtime = "fun") of course and we all know that if people are having "fun" then that of course means more people will eventually visit the atomic shop for that one item that catches their eye.
---
Rad! Any more coming?
---
GOLD CONTENT PEOPLE
---
My main character is fixed because I have what seems to me the perfect spot.  Good for free travel, resources, not attacked too often, interesting neighbours, only rarely camped by other people.
---
My alt is moving her camp around because she's low level and needs the nearby backup as she levels up.
---
(Also, gotta get them ATOMs for the move your camp challenge).
---
In fairness, it didn’t work for them, either.
---
Rejuvenated grants 85% disease resistance when your hunger is satisfied and your thirst is quenched iirc. Some legendaries have the effect of disease resistance, but say they give rad resistance (bug).
---
It's the Flatwoods Monster. If you can engage him, it's a pretty easy cryptid to kill.
---
Do you still have one of those wings
---
It’s the Flatwoods monster.
---
There's only 2 genders though, people who think otherwise have a mental condition.
---
I don't mind if they want us to wear a special hat or sunglasses, but preferably it should be a category of things, like the sunglasses. I don't like it when half of all the players are wearing full clown suits or the asylum worker outfits. It's boring and definately non-immersive. I love it when people dress innovatively and that different players look different. This makes all look exactly the same. Why would every one in the wasteland suddenly dress as clowns or nurses?
---
I do it but I hate it.
---
no but they can turn up and attack you while you are taking the workshop and after you have claimed it them get an event to retake the workshop from you but they can only attack you now if you are in the workshop area, most people claim workshops for a short time and don't care about fighting to keep it, if you are looking to avoid pvp don't take the power stations or the ammo factory just jump to another world where it is unclaimed and be carefull during defend events you will sometimes get a player turning up to kill you while you are distracted
---
It's a sign you should go outside this summer.
---
This is content, merci dude
---
A chalkboard to write messages on would be nice. Ideally people could give feedback.
---
Or, realistically, just draw a pepe or a dickbutt on it
---
Then you're smarter than most people on this post.
---
I've got all sorts of toons, some with 1 strength. It's an entirely gimped way of doing things but the PA will give you some strength buff. You can always use chems or whiskey for some more. It doesn't have to be a particularly good melee weapon but I'd recommend some sort of 2 handed like a sledge or spear. Like I say, gimped, but it'll get you through. I have to do this a lot lol.
---
You need to find and read the plans first. There are also mods scattered around the map and also some for sale at the vendors. There are raider vendors at The Top of the World and a The White Spring that sell plans. You need flux to mods power armor though. There is a player named bluemazehaze who does power armor mods. He can lot put the whole thing. Tell him Battmantattman sent you. Lol
---
Ow I can kill stuff just kinda defeats the point of gaining resources for ammo by using ammo to get the resources lol
---
I use the communist^* solution to the two ice cream salesmen on the beach problem.
---
(* Well, obviously not the real communist solution, which would probably involve reeducation camps).
---
    ------------Vault 76------------------------My camp------------
---
Magazines have been my best selling items so far. Selling them for 10-15 caps.
---
There will at least be the two new vaults for high level raids, whatever the nuclear winter mode is, it is only a part of the content in the summer updates.
---
If there's a canon name for it, this would probably be it. Our first mission is "Reclamation Day" after all, as in we are going to reclaim the wasteland.
---
Chill or toxic idk. If it doesn't involve me i really dont care. 
---
You know what im saying? I dont give a 2 poops if some lvl 200s are trying to get people for arkos. Idk if some lvl 7s are trying to get people for fertilized soil. If im near... Im in but when im diving the nuka cola plant for for delicious drinks i dont care about your problems.
---
When are you doing it?
---
The whole game is the pinnacle of atompunk, it really doesn't need any cogs. I love steampunk but really no, this game doesn't need any.
---
I have my front door locked, I just don't want to have random people in my house, it's a thing of privacy, also my house is in the Mire, it's just creepy by itself :') 
---
But you can use my 3 water purifiers, only one is locked to make sure I have at least 2 water when I come back. 
---
There is a Rad shower and a power armor station behind my house though. 
---
Also feel free to take any fruits, I have 9 corns, mutfruits, Tatos,  Blackberrys, carrots and melons  :) 
---
The only thing I fu**ing ask for is, when you spawn and attract enemys, kill them, don't look into my vendor and leave while they destroy my camp, that's just an asshole move!
---
The fact that you guys downvote this comment for a 100% valid opinion and will most likely downvote this comment too just shows how hard you lost your grip on reality.
---
there should just be a better level up system after level 50. I hate it and im only level 70. I have 6 levels waiting because I just don't know what to do with them.
---
Indeed i have only seen it twice. But they always make silly oversights. Like the built in switch on the powered door that dont work 😂
---
Thank you, you speak the truth man.
---
I’ve been in the same spot for over 4 months

The Camp changes here and there but overall is the same. I just make new characters and build on them. I now have 5 full budget builds and wish I could have more haha. Camp Mules forever :)

*"I drink from the pond directly"*
---
You are pretty RAD and brave u/GoldBrooke!
---
Hahaha! You dick! But I'd laugh if you ever got me like that.
---
I wouldn't be surprised. Bethesda Austin is creatively bankrupt. Nothing they released to this day was in any way good, so a battle royale is probably the best solution for them. Requires least effort and just copy something like fortnite.
---
Use a pressure plate with powered doors. You'll never have that issue!
---
Maybe for max scrip, but 300 is a bit too easy to reach
---
Are you on PS4?  I have a pet deathclaw named Glitchy.
---
&gt; I started it to get a conversation going so the community can tell Bethesda how they feel
---
Hmmm... False. If that was your intent, you wouldn't have acted like you were a chosen messenger of the whole FO76 community with your "None of us want" rot.
---
If that had been your intent, you would've titled this post something like "Do we/you really want/need a Battle Royale mode?"
---
But you did not.
---
It's a shame that deathclaws are the lame duck of appalachia.
---
Being trans isnt a mental illness, it's now classified as a 'sexual condition' ie a physical one.
---
Shit went wrong in the womb, my body doesn't match my brain (and yes, multiple studies have proven that trans people's brains match their gender identity), but I'm making the best of it I can.
---
A link to all the files has been posted [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/bmjf05/spoilers_discussion_we_now_know_what_nuclear/), you can decide what it could be yourself, although it is a long listen as there are hundreds of voice files. It is probably best to wait for the official reveal (only 13 days until the E3 conference), as it is not necessarily just a simple BR mode.
---
Just an fyi, hermaphrodite isn't a gender, it's a sex.
---
I have a char lvl 180, and I sit on 50 unspent points... and I have few perks with different rank already... Unless I completely change my build I don't know what to do with this...   
---
Sincerely, I don't think it's a priority to change perk distribution, It's part of the game to be restricted at start.. However I really want a native perk manager with preset
---
PSA: you can cancel a reload by holstering your weapon ;)
---
I heard that too
---
The void! Haha. I have a trap Camp and the other day someone came by and got burnt alive (all automated). He then made his way back but tried the back door, which you access from the roof, right as he got there I threw him off of a cliff with my hidden springboard traps (6 or them haha) and he dies again. So he comes back a third time, jumps on top of the vending machine so I couldn’t throw him again and proceeded to buy everything in my vending machine (all trash boards and such 1-100 caps), but the real joke was the third trap, I’m max caps and all his money went to the void ;) haha
---
But ops worried that it will be battle royal
---
"oh well", replies bethesda.
---
I'm playing a roleplaying game. I have a story to my character, set of things he does and set of thing he does not. He uses autonomous-stupidity for owns interests, considerd modus a handy tool. He's a survivalist and a general. Pretty busy mofo.
---
He could hack the robots. He could blow them to pieces. He could take head on half of the map at once and come out victorious. One thing he can't do is to use backpack, and the only explaination for this fact that fits his lore anyhow is that he has people to wear his backpack for him...
---
Seriously, its the top1 immersion breaker for my optimisation-addicted, people leading character that believes FEV is a philosophy and not a virus, and who considers self-performed postnatal eugenics as what differentiates next generation of humans from the meatbags they once were.
---
No way for me to snuck being a tad-fucking-pole into this playset. Should I play against the roleplay, or should I express my concerns -nontradable items in form of worlds most basic and common inventory is stupid and there's no denying that.
---
There's an Insult Bot that wanders around and will give you the note saying you've been insulted
---
I agree.
---
I am french and I play with english voices just because they are so good.
---
The level of production of some holotapes is really really great
---
Wood is at the very bottom currently invisible due to a bug. Position on the "Ultracite" row and then move down via keyboard cursor key (or its controller equivalent); you can then toggle the search option for it.
---
You have an Agility perk (Mister sandman) that grants you increased damage with silent weapons at night.
---
You’d hope they work out an algorithm that takes away all the cards you’ve max ranked and gives you a one off perk pack to replace these cards with new ones.
---
I have a mutants explosive 1 perception 10mm SMG. That thing breaks vs Queen, Imposter, Noxius and alpha Sheepsquatch. 
---
I have all the perks for smgs all the explosive perks and my friend shares luck of the draw rank 3. 
---
Breaks every fight without fail. I'm churning out over 2k rounds every 15 minutes.
---
There are a bunch of iron nodes in the world, and resource maps are available using google. But here's a very quick tip:
---
There's a welcome to Sutton sign at the very lower end of the town. Start heading directly up the hill behind it and you'll see a yellow cargo carrier near the train tracks. Head straight up the hill and just below the top are a few iron nodes. With excavator, it will give you four more per node. Down at Silva homestead there is a barn with a silo. Three bags of ammonia in there for acid. This will get you some easy steel in a pinch, without firing a shot.
---
Legendary armor and backpack has made the power armor become obsolete. If it at least offered a high protection from disease it would still have something. It wouldn't be inconseivable how a sealed, steel plated, water tight, pratically a vehicle, armor suit would actually protect agains diseases.
---
I know what you mean lol
---
Seems like you play with fire when not swim with mainstream.
---
I identify sex as gender too!
---
I was saying that exact thing yesterday!!! It really sucks to have to spend levels getting lower versions of the perks when there's so many I don't have yet. It would be nice to have them all before I had to resort to that, but it is what it is. I really hope that they do intend on redoing the perk system.
---
What I do is to buy expensive stuff (plans i don't own, weapon I never tried etc...) to keep the flow running.
---
I think the cap is fine. It also limit items price.
---
To be fair, I kinda want a battle royale, just not your traditional, don’t speak for everyone
---
This is stupid. Just realize there is going to be pvp or stick to getting pencils.
---
Not another one of these posts
---
I sell mags for 20 caps each and they sell out constantly.
---
On PS4? I have your first trap base if you’d like haha :) I have three to pick from and they are all automated, not some silly floor removal/spawn “trap” or anything terrible like that haha
---
Don’t forget also,you loose all ur junk when killed so too me a battle royal is total time waste and I for one will definitely not be doing it same as survival I’ve tried a few times but tse owners usually win so what’s the point???
---
What’s the cap limit on pc?
---
I've seen some strange requests, but this is just...
---
You are joking right?
---
People spawn at the center of your build zone (where you first put the C.A.M.P. item)
---
25k on one character, you can have 5 characters on one account.
---
i dont have a screen shot but if you are on PS4 and bring me a PA suit i can paint it with the officer paint which the 4th paint you get and the best so far, PSN blaine\_anderson
---
So how did u pay 45k like wouldn’t that guy only get the 25?
---
I mean i can try to come up with an immersive/lore/serious approach.
---
Maybe it's just that after the long time in the vault, with no influence from the outside, in combination with irradiated viruses it's more likely that most dweller catch any disease more often. Like you've got a immun system of a squirrell.
---
He get 20k on one character and 25k on another.
---
Good to know. I'm usually to busy calling myself a twat to think of that.
---
Nice, thanks for the info. Tricky thing is that its really difficult to know for sure if putting 4 in increased your chances here, we would have to submit 4 in a lot of times to see if the chance increased.
---
PvE survival mode like The Division 1 had would be nice. Start with nothing and craft your way up to meet the endgoal.
---
Yes. Twatty McTwatface should be known throughout the wasteland.
---
Yeh don't understand that one.
---
Can't defend workshop. Don't take workshop. It's not rocket science.
---
You were arrogant and cocky yourself thinking the contester was a low level. So dont pretend it's unfair. 
---
Ironic
---
What if you could scrap unwanted cards for Scrip?
---
That way it could be used for random recycle-able crap instead of cluttering up the servers, I mean if you think about millions of players with 10-20 useless cards each, that’s like a bajillion unwanted cards!!
---
&gt; Cranberry bog fissure sight prime*
---
Site, not sight.
---
agree, have so many of the same perks from rank 1 to max because i love testing my build with different perks.
---
Well, his lead-in did describe F76 as the greatest game ever.  It’s a great game and all, but....
---
Happening to me too.
---
I did warn you what the response would be. There's no helping some people.
---
The Overseer's "Personal Matters" quest almost made me tear up. Bethesda really did nail the voice acting on this one.
---
Ok im curious why would having 3min to actually prepare for pvp be a bad thing its not the end of pvp hell im saying let us have a chance to fight back or run what is wrong with that! I dont want some ass hat standing behind me with his blooded death claw gauntlet to be able to just click a kill this person button and slash me to pieces befor i can react thats not pvp thats BULL SHIT what about having some dude choosing when you can and cant fight him is good pvp. You a sniper build well to bad because this guy is a one handed build and all he has to do is run up to your sitting spot click the fight button and cut you to ribbons.
---
Ofcourse it is
---
Don't take workshops if you don't want fight for it with other players. If it's already taken, change server. And there is better way to farm for lead than extractors and pencils...
---
No, I am not joking. Fallout 76 is this close to being the best fallout of all time, and the game of this generation. But it needs to put more time into being inclusive imo
---
It has to all be connected by the foundations if it isn't it will split.
---
Holy, an actual reason to play the game/ PvP!That might make me come back tbh, don’t know why you all are angry. Bring on the downvotes!
---
I'm staring at that right now on my PS4.  I have a Pro and a Slim and it only does it on the Pro!  Go figure.  Coincidence maybe, but I'm sure it's never happened when I play on the other PS4.  I'm staring out over the Monongah mine and it's pretty colours as far as the eye can see!
---
&gt;Bethesda, please do not let nuclear winter be a battle Royale. 
---
Uh sure. If they have been working to start releasing  in week-two from now , sure your pleas will make them all of a sudden turn around, and cough up something else quicky. And you'll love it!
---
&gt;If we wanted to play fortnite, we would play fortnite. 
---
What does that have to do with anything? And why you say Fortnite and not PUBG? There are quite different ways to do battle royal.
---
Isn't that quite similiar to battle royal?
---
I do! It works like a charm, but I have two doors and there wasn't enough room to make that mechanism so I've had to settle with a diner door instead. People always use my other door and leave it open, it's so annoying
---
I love listening to music while playing and to me, the song selection adds immersion. I agree with OP, I wish there'd be some music pack in future updates. There are gems in 30's-50's music that can be included.
---
I've used most of mine to repair my Excavator. If one piece gets broken, I lose like 200 carry weight ability.
---
Honestly, I don't see how adding a battle royal mode could hurt, as long as it's placed alongside adventure and survival. I do not like survival, but it's addition has not taken away from my enjoyment. In fact, it's improved it since they moved almost all pvp stuff to that mode and made adventure almost entirely pve (barring of course the fights that both parties agree to). So while I don't want a battle royal mode, it's existence in the menu shouldn't have any effect on adventure mode so I don't see an issue with it's inclusion. I mean sure, the time could've been better spent crafting new material that would go into both adventure and survival, but they gave us enough content already that I'm fine waiting til winter when they expand the story.
---
Go to Lucky Hole Mine in Excavator PA and collect all the lead ore, and also do the Breach And Clear events. Collect acid, smelt the ore, problem solved.
---
Sex and gender are the same thing.
---
I want to fight but i dont get the chance because the attacker gets to chose when to initiate combat which always leads to me getting shot while im my stash box. Alot of players arnt getting into pvp fights they are getting executed. Im not mad about all the times i get killd trying to defend i mad about the times im just in my stash and some dude walks up behind me and is like ok kill now and jumps me. I want the chance to get into a defensive position.
---
Thank god there is no Russian audio in this game. Skyrim’s one was just a joke and it took a lot of time to switch to english. Russian localisations are always bad
---
The only way to call it really battle royale, is to be fundementally separate from rest of the game. In BR people mostly start all from 0, and whatever you gain from one match, it's all gone for the next.
---
To have that in Fallout 76, it would have to be a very confined area, separate from main servers. You couldn't have your char or your inventory. 
---
If you take any of the existing Fallout 76 features in(char building or farming gear), it won't be quite a BR anymore.
---
Why is your stash box out in the open?
---
What do you mean by "something that players can already facilitate themselves"? How are you going to get 20 or 50 or 100 players to agree to pick all the same SPECIAL stats, remove all perks, and somehow all use the same weapon at the same level AND obey the rules by not interfering after being killed and respawning?? It doesnt really seem possible to facilitate this on a volunteer basis. Certainly not on an at will basis. And isn't the limit on players on a server like 24 or something anyway?
---
I have the slim. I've had it happen both day and night.  The first time I saw it I thought it was like a disco event or something! Haha. Now it's just a slight annoyance. Bit the only bugs I've really had are that, and scraping my bulk items/weapon mods instead of only my junk. So I can't complain too much.
---
Just take my silver already.
---
Toto-al Carnage
---
bish
---
everyone in this thread is proof why his game has the most pathetic active playerbase
---
I think it's just annoying that you name them but that doesn't really matter
---
When i played wow i think (was a long time ago) you were friends with characters rather than accounts in your friends list.
---
It was great if you wanted some alone time but a bit of a pain if you didnt. As a joke a friend of mine made an alt and sent me a whisper "buy gold or die". After i blocked him, and sent a very profesional email to blizzard he got a strike on his account... only later did i find out that it was him when he told me about the strike.
---
Also not knowing who is who when people brought alts to raids and such.... it got confusing.
---
So i can understand why they went with account names.... but for role playing it breaks the character immersion. Just like in dnd i use peoples character names and not the perons actual name. Artanis did that not james.
---
Battle Royale or not, I dont care, this "story" of Vault 51 has me really really excited for thier E3
---
I noticed the same thing, I had to resort to the Fallout Wiki because quest markers where missing.
---
They could always add a setting to allow you to show character name
---
I’m disappointed with survival, everything is fine with it. The one thing I can’t deal with is the fact that you’re highlighted on the map. I really wish you weren’t. Or at least you disappear when you’re in close proximity to the person hunting you. It should give people a marker of the area that you’re in. And not your exact location.
---
I love the help man but it was just an example
---
O I would actually really really want a battle royale  I would also love a crucible type area with normalized damage.
---
Yeah - there are a few I’ll cure if they become too annoying, but those vary a bit by character.  And they are sufficiently rare that I’ve likely got a disease cure in my inventory I’ve not sold yet I can pop without trying to hard.
---
Wether 'none of us' want or don't want a BR mode, it won't change Bethesda's development focus a few weeks before release.
---
Team C.A.M.P a shared build area still the risk of team mate going off on one and destroying everything, life is risk.
---
Or be able to show only perk cards that we use/shift, NOT the whole collection
---
You don't need to look for quentin. Just take code from first terminal and use it on Erica s terminal
---
Great picture! I absolutely love the photo mode. Definitely beats screenshotting after making my HUD transparent lol. AND they pop up as loading screens? So dope
---
&gt; They can even get some of the Quake devs to make the map since they have that kind of experience and work under the same ZeniMax umbrella.
---
OLOL, this guy doesn't know about Quake Champions, hehehe, well sorry to disappoint you but you probably want to keep Saber far away from something such as Fallout / Creation Engine.  
---
ps: just so you know, quake devs do quake dev, not maps, you want some artists, the one who models and textures "visual thingies" ;)
---
I’ve had the same thing for months now it’s a massive pain
---
Yup, or even if they did say:
---
Char name (user name)
---
Id be happy. I dont know if there is a character limit for the gui.
---
If they did do it id be happy to write a backstory and get into character. Id go full method acting with that shit.
---
This game also didn't need the pioneer scouts or the rider armours, but we have them and they're kind of awesome. I'm also not too sure how wendigo, Lovcraftian cultists, or people dressed as cowboys and firefighters using harpoon guns and barbed walking canes to fight off bat-controlled plague zombies help to accebtuate the specific points of of the genre; but I'm willing to believe that you understand atompunk differently than I do :~p
---
I found formula q plan on f76 wiii. It says it's the same but without drawbacks lot less like addiction chance and thirst. Also it requires melon bloom instead of bloodleaf
---
Battle Royal ... isnt the problem here .. just imagine how that turns out...
---
Just think about Survival and how that was for PvP... let that sink in for a bit.
---
Now think about a PvP Game mode.....
---
gonna be clusterfucker simulator
---
Ran with my Heavy Gunner build with a TSE minigun and spent a solid 1500 rounds crippling every limb on that bitch. That was my first time doing that event, and that's my favorite creature in Fallout, made it very memorable :)
---
You have nothing to spend them on but you want the cap limit to increase?
---
Wether Nuclear Winter is BR or not, no amount of reddit posts will change Bethesda's development path. Odds are they're already working on Wastelanders aswell.
---
Oh wow they really nerfed it
---
Depends on the definition of things, the idea above mentions "small area like urban combat"  so that would fit the "arena shooter",  which is what Quake is, an A-fps (A for arena).  
---
So, is an arena-shooter sized battle royale, an Arena Royale ? Cuz I would probably try it !
---
It's a problem with the game engine. There were reports of this back in the B.E.T.A across all platforms including PC. They might have managed to stabilise it a little since then, but ultimately the PS4 isn't powerful enough to do this engine justice.
---
I'll be online this evening, after work! Will you be online?
---
Yeah I'm off work today just message me and I'll pop on if I'm not already on.
---
Oh, my bad, I thought you weren't a troll. My mistake😂
---
I never lock my purifiers. I leave them open so people can take water to cover the cost of fast traveling, but they rarely do it seems. Only thing that gets locked is my fusion generator shed.
---
Love these, my favourite is the Nuka cola quantum in the machine!
---
I don't know of anyone who has it running "fin" on their PC. Maybe you are just used to shitty games, that is on you. I'm used to polished games as I came from playing games by actual competent programmers.
---
You also ignored the part where I said previously I tried everything bethesdas help reps recommended to get it running well. Just to see, it made zero difference and they didn't once say anything about lowering my Overclock even after I brought it up.
---
Would disagree, good example of Russian localisation - Witcher 3. However in FO76, considering how text is localised in Russian, definately would have been "different"...
---
Here you go, Todd himself saying no human NPC's: https://wccftech.com/todd-howard-fallout-76-questions/

---
Rifle just seems to enjoy blowing shit up. Which is always a good thing.
---
Why do you need name tags. It's ironic. You want everyone to be anyone but the you type of people want to be "branded" as something. Pretty funny and ironic.
---
I’ll assume you believe that statement. It used to be that yes, gender was equal to sex. These days however, everyone feels the need to be special, so they thought “hey, lets make gender a word that describes your psychology preferred noun (he, she, they, them, etc).
---
So now we have two meanings. Sex, being the medically diagnosed condition of being either male, female or intersex. This cannot be disputed by choice, it simply is.
---
The second one is gender, which more or less NOW means “call yourself whatever you want” so males can call themselves women, females can call themselves men, whatever the hell you want its irrelevant anyway. 
---
The point being that gender neutrality and fluidity rejects the notion that there are only men and women, and it embraces all deviation of humans along the spectrum. 
---
TL/DR: the meaning of words change over time, deal with it or dont, noone cares.

Exactly the same situation - I've lost 3 heavy turrets that way, they just don't like to be placed on the right side of my house. Those placed on left side and at the back never disappeared. The worst problem with that bug is that game don't see them as destroyed or removed (so you can't repair them via C.A.M.P. machine) and they still uses camp budget, so after 4th disappearance I've resigned to place another - my camp budget is almost full :(
---
A lot of people who just want to play the game normally
---
You can find it in changelog [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019)
---
That's a cool site thank you
---
When are we going to start rebuilding America?
---
The fundamental of the BR game is you hope to land and find decent weapons, and that’s completely RNG. Using Apex or Fortnite as an example, if you land on a pistol and the enemy has a shotgun/AR your chances of winning are extremely low simply because their building had the better loot. 
---
RNG in what should skill-based fighting is dumb. 
---
(I say this as someone who plays apex a lot too)
---
Yes. Keeps you hidden so you get longer benefit for covert operative and works with mr sandman at night alowing for one shotting high level enemies.
---
Due to the low rate of fire both are important.
---
Sadly almost all games have a reduction in range as a drawback for supressors while in fact this not the case. But on topic, the slightly reduced range is not noticable on a properly specced character.
---
Might seem obvious, but suppressed weapons will make you harder to detect.
---
I'd pretty much entirely forgotten that after using TSE exclusively for months. Got used to an accompanying explosion in the face of whatever I shot, consequently alerting all nearby enemies.
---
Yup, same here.. For months. 2 missile turrets, missing in action
---
I was at a vendor camp today which had 2 items for 25,000 caps:
---
An IOU for beer, and an IOU for toilet paper.
---
Nothing else was in the vendor.
---
While I can see your point as a trader without a mic who quite often has to use more then one character to complete trades I find the current game tag display much more important for practical reasons
---
The only thing I've noticed it having an effect on is one of the Mr Handys in the Vault can call you by name.
---
Only happens once though.
---
I don't see why they used it in the vault and nowhere else, makes more sense not to include it.
---
Np. All credit goes to u/akarnokd for creating it and updating it.
---
I just sell then to npc vendor bots
---
You murdered a messenger because the person whose identity you stole to gain their prize owed money to a system that doesn't exist anymore?
---
Don't want to mention all the stuff I lost because I forgot to clear my Vending machine before moving my camp..
---
The amount of times I have bypassed locked doors because they have no roof or unlocked doors on higher levels........
---
Fortnite is bad though. If I wanted my aiming to be a literal dice roll I’d go play monopoly lol
---
What he said
---
I wouldn't say that none of us want a BR, but clearly the majority of the people browsing reddit right now don't. I think it has potential, but I'm pretty sure I've thought about it more than the average person who has a knee-jerk reaction to anything BR related. 
---
Also, one of the main themes of the Fallout series is how people behave without with centralized behavioral influence, and how entities can exploit a decaying social infrastructure. The idea that something could influence us to kill each other isn't far fetched. Our mission WAS to rebuild America, but we're launch nukes like crazy.
---
Been saying this for ages! It never made sense to me that we couldn’t choose which rank of a perk card we wanted active to compensate for other perks that we wanted, having an extra copy of that card just means we have to scroll through even more cards until we find the one we want and it all just feels a bit messy, the system seriously needs a bit of a clean up. Also decks! Give us decks for loadouts already Bethesda!
---
Do you have a penis or vagina. It's not fucking hard to understand.
---
I'll keep trying this 4 at a time method to try it our
---
I have this problem if I have too many quests active at one time. Turn tracking off on quests you're not doing and keep tracking to only a few and quest markers cake back for me
---
What I did yesterday. Took the Gorge junkyard and Tyler county Derby track workshops. Hopped between events and rarely farmed for xp. For six hours I leveled up from 20 to 28 and most of the time I was afk. My stash suffered the consequences though, from 400 to 710 in mostly valuable materials.
---
Thanks for your feedback
---
1950's Americana, ray guns, Robbie the robots and aliens? Yeah, I'm right off the mark there.
---
I’m using a 1* instigating hunting rifle, 1* anti armor auto handmade, 3* furious lever action rifle with faster movement and 33% hit chance, 1* instigating hatchet and a 1* instigating lvl 40 combat shotgun.
---
to prevent trading spams it could be an emote chat. so people cant write whatever they want instead they can choose from a big variety of pre sentences.
---
like: "player a want to launch a nuke at alpha on fissure prime, join him!" and for every event there should be a message.
---
i just dont want it to be like in games like wow where its constant spamming things like "selling dungeonruns, selling level runs, selling stuff" and so on.
---
The Scrip daily limit is balanced. You can easily get 2 3* some days or multiple 2*
---
It's kept at 150 to balance it. It wouldn't be smart to make it larger because then there'd be a large inflation. The Purveyor is a cool treat for consistent legendaries but the point of legendary hunting will always be killing legendary creatures. I'd rather they make all legendaries drop their appropriate star item instead of SBQ dropping 1* Wood
---
You’re likely going to be killing stuff no matter what—either directly, to get things or indirectly, defending yourself while picking things up or mining. 
---
For steel, find low level areas with lots of gun wielding enemies. Point Pleasant, Grafton, Grafton Steel, will all give you lots of easy to kill Scorched or Super Mutants. Collect their guns and put on scrapper. You’ll be swimming in steel, way more than you’ll spend to collect it. 
---
For acid, Hemlock Holes workshop has 3 extractors, but players will often fight you for it and you’ll need to fight waves of enemies regularly to defend it. The new Campfire tales event might be more useful—it spawns dozens of bloodbugs. The bloodbug proboscis scraps to 2X acid. 
---
Alternatively, circumvent all of that by just collecting your 1400 caps/day from vendors and then buying your ammo from player CAMPs.
---
After I read about the hatchlings hosting the disease I went and activated about 5 eggs, then stood there for a few minutes being constantly battered. Gave up before I got the disease!
---
- Instigating and 10% dmg while aiming 2* hunting rifle
---
- 1* Antiarmor handmade
---
- 2* explosive, 10% dmg while mutated action lever
---
Is there a distinction between hatchlings spawned from the queen and eggs? I must admit I've only tried the eggs with no success!
---
Search 'roasted players' for a trap base thread w 6k upvotes
---
Whats the difference astetically between a straight woman and a lesbian?
---
Can you wear make up and wear a dress as a male? Yup.... go full drag queen if you like. so all the tools are there.
---
There are 2 sexes in the game and you are free to create whatever character you choose with the tools provided. Role play or be yourself as much as you want.
---
What you cant do is create people with dwarfism... if i could id go peter dinklige all the way.
---
This game is going to be the laughing stock again, isn't it? Can't go a month without it happening.
---
If this really is going to happen based on what I've read about those audio files strongly suggesting it, then I can definitely see all the video essays poking fun at Bethesda for having to try fish from the mainstream genre audience to keep their game alive.  I'll be hearing about it for weeks I bet.
---
Yes but they don't trade or do anything else just try to shoot me and it's annoying. Makes me regret approaching other players when they just follow me around shooting after. I bought this game to meet other fallout players because I've heard the community was is great and honestly I'm disappointed with my experiences.
---
I'm not sure why this is surprising. It's an exploding weapon so even with a suppressor, which in IRL terms merely suppresses the sound and flash from it being fired, it is going to make noise and a flash because it is an explosive weapon.
---
It may be an unpopular opinion but wanting stealth with explosions is a bit of an oxymoron. Wouldn't Instigating be a better option if stealth is your game?
---
Usually 20-25 minutes depending on server responsiveness (i.e., if the game registers the pipe repair and replacing the mainframe cores for example). Level 242.
---
I've been doing the runs with various loadouts, but always in Excavator PA and 55% rifleman build:
---
* **Lvl 35 Troubleshooter's Handmade**: *(Watoga drop from long ago)* lvl 52 gutsies and lvl 46 assaultrons still require 15-40 bullets. Shooting the legs of the Assaultron often glitches them out and are floating in air without legs shooting their lasers. 800-1000 rounds per run.
---
* **Lvl 45 Furious +25% ffr Handmade**: *(player vending purchase)* despite the damage rampup, not much better than Troubleshooters. 800-1000 rounds per run.
---
* **Lvl 45 Assassin's Explosive Handmade**: *(Queen drop)* seems to be a bit better than Troubleshooter's and Furious due to how the explosion affects multiple limbs. 700-900 rounds per run.
---
* **Lvl 35 Exterminator's Handmade**: *(Silo Charlie drop)* feels better than Troubleshooter's and Furious, maybe on par with Explosive. The plus damage for the last 40% health is quite noticeable. 700-900 rounds per run.
---
* **Lvl 50 Troubleshooter's Ultracite Gatling Laser + 25% ffr**. *(Purveyor)* Usually 6-7 fusion cores but the speed wears the enemies down much faster, even though I'm not specced to use it. I use it for fun and to finish the *shoot robots with laser weapons* challenge.
---
Generally I try to sneak as much as possible for the 2x damage but it doesn't last too long and there is a glitch where the server and client disagree if you are still hidden/caution and heals back half of the 2x damage.
---
No some guy with a 5 cap bounty at whitesprings haha
---
Listening to some FO4 songs made me buy this game. Haven't touched the radio tho. Love the enviromental music.
---
They recently added fast travel mats in the newest update
---
Good luck playing survival without your PvP protection or Level Scaling
---
Napoleon complex. They convince themselves that killing you in any way, not necessarily in an honourable way, makes them tough. It’s very awkward. If I don’t grief people like that until they leave the server, I just go out about my business while they waste their time shooting or hitting me.
---
And I only meet Mr. Bandit that bastard.
---
If you want close to the real thing then top hat and witch outfit or pastors.
---
If you want generally creepy, I have jumpscared a few people with the Imposter Sheepsquatch hat and outfit.
---
I have neither.
---
does picking camp door locks get you wanted?
---
It wasn't only the PS4. Miniguns and LMGs were unusable  across platforms. On PC, you could unlock your frame rate and fire several times faster than intended.
---
This game engine isn't powerful enough to handle this game engine. :P
---
The firing rate has since been nerfed and they're kind of usable now. All the frame rate shenanigans were also fixed.
---
Buying water defeats the whole purpose as well 
---
I see it locked or for sale and I keep walking and that’s a missed opportunity for the seller as I buy a lot of ammo and chems constantly
---
Only makes individual blueprints for me too. So we do need to spend the time to make a 'Master' blueprint before we make the move, being careful everything is selected before commiting the 'Make Blueprint' action.
---
Cool build, is so refreshing seeing a build different from the meta ones (sniper, blooded etc). Mine is a Strength/Perception/Agility stealth. [13/14/4/4/5/15/1]
---

---
(I don’t carry all the heavies all the time, but carry multiple when I do because they break so fast)
---
Char 2: Rifles, but uses PA so melee isn’t horrid when needed
---
 - Quad / Faster Fire Gauss (primed)
---

---
 - Furious Tesla Rifle
---

---
 - Furious / Damage while aiming Cryolator (carry in case the other breaks)
---
 - Vamp .50 (primed)
---
Maybe it didn't get to make its debut before the bombs dropped. Maybe there's a lost shipment of it somewhere in what's left of the United States.
---
But as this post said if we have say rank 3 of a card but want to apply rank 1 we should. We should be able to have the 1 card max rank but toggle what level we want it to be
---
Yeah I most enjoy the 'What happens if you nuke ____?' videos, saves me the time, effort and likely dissapointment of trying myself.
---
Also I can't be the only one who thinks he sounds just like James Franco? lol
---
If I go to somebody shop and step on a punji board or anything like that I will immediately leave and they lose my business.
---
See this is the problem all of reddit users  are a bunch of cry baby's y'all already got you're god dam will changing the PvP mechanics for adventure mode you crying about getting you're camp destroyed like a little girl now you're gonna change the only PvP experience we have left y'all should just shut up about it and stay in you're adventure mode which isnt really a fallout world anymore and build you're wack camp some of us do want PvP and want to see more content towards that the pve community already got What they wanted plus dlc now its PvP turn to get some love so go back to youre friendly adventure mode and stay there
---
I wish bubbles was downstairs near the shops, I always get lost :(
---
It generally just stares at you in the Forest and other low level areas (in my limited experience) if you keep your distance, although he will aggro other animals nearby toward you or your camp. Had to fight one off in the Mire yesterday, which seemed to be part of the Messenger event, although it could've been coincidence. Not on topic but that event was hell for me. Ended up dying to multiple mirelurk kings. Tried a few times to respawn and finish it but it was just too much for me.
---
Good luck.
---
I've been running Census Violence for _months_. I have never received this plan. It's supposed to drop, has been confirmed by data mine, and players have confirmed receiving it from Census Violence.
---
I still haven't received it.
---
I'm heavy weapons guy. I carry different flavors for different enemy types. 
---
Mutant slayers lmg with limb damage and ADS
---
Tse gatling for ghouls dogs and airborne
---
Furious gatling plasma with limb damage and damage resist while reloading for big targets
---
Exterminator and assassins explosive .50
---
And a vampires .50 to keep me alive during long fights
---
This is Bethesda so anything is possible. It's plausible that some patch reintroduce certain bugs. Have you tried with a different weapon?
---
Criticism is perfectly fine, but that's not the issue, the issue is that a lot of people either hate this game because its not what they wanted, or have chosen this game as an outlet for years of pent up frustration at bethesda. Their games are buggy as hell, always have been, but this is the first time the moddling community can't fix it, so the bugs are a lot more apparent than it was for previous games. I'm not saying this game is as good as new vegas, but that game got a whole lot of hate when it came out for being a buggy mess, but is now lauded as the best in the series. If we give them nothing but vitriol, they'll abandon the game and move on, but if we can see some good, and try to push them in the right direction, the game can get better. We all want this game to be good, please help it get there.
---
i vendor the water i steal from other people
---
They got back a lot of old bugs since May 17. At one point it was at January state. 
---
It seems with every new update they will roll back to prevent who knows what until it is fixed.
---
I'd certainly enjoy buying a music pack to listen too while sitting in my camp, that would be cool, would make some money for Beth also.
---
That is genuinely the best suggestion i have seen on here.
---
Urgh! Long grind ahead it looks like! Hopefully in a future update they’ll let the vendors sell it
---
I've had this annoying problem!! Half the time I can't kill an enemy with my Auto-Tesla rifle, then swap out to a melee and the things back at full health!!
---
Cause you suck bruh that's why dont blame the game
---
I'm actually in the same boat, hit caps cap 5 times now, what I ended up doing was buying an UNGODLY amount of ammo for all my guns, spent 10k on .45 and then another 10k on shells, then another 10k on 5.56 then another 10k on .308 rounds
---
I really REALLY REALLY REALLY Hope they add a caps dump, a respec would be nice...
---
But for now, just buy mass ammo
---
I actually found those flavors at the vendor in The Whitesprings, upper level
---
Do our wasteland friends open the door if they wander onto the pressure plate?
---
I have had a similar experience. Could be right.
---
Many a true nerd. He's amazing
---
1x TSE handmade
---
1x instigating handmade
---
1x instigating explosive black powder rifle
---
1x Instigating explosive lever rifle
---
1x anti armor combat rifle
---
1x instigating death claw gauntlet
---
What I use depends on circumstances.... Sneak and instigating (with critical?) kills almost anything....
---
Pve got there content bruh and y'all changed PvP to youre will already by y'all crying over everything. Now y'all wanna change the only dlc the PvP community gonna get grow a pair guys come on its the waste not a friendly place to be at every fallout game has been about betrayal robbing and choosing a group to survive and slay the other groups so when y'all want a fallout with no PvP is like saying raiders ans bad guys don't exist in the fallout universe
---
This will be part of the storyline, have you not listened to the tapes? I think all these camera quests are complete bullshit but guess what? I do the mandatory ones and ignore the ones that aren’t 
---
The world doesn’t revolve around u billy
---
How do you go to the toilet... (what hole/s)
---
Enquiring minds need to know
---
God this sub Is having a meltdown.
---
If this game mode is added it will be no different from surivial mode and its seperste gamemode.
---
The bulk of the dlc won't be for it and not mu H will change. Yall are just being part of the fortnite bad circlejerk
---
Denial
---
Sometimes yes multiple quests are active and its a mess with them, but i'm used to activate only one at a time, and even when there is only one quest, the marker is far away from where it's supposed to be (when i'm in interior), or it simply doesn't show up, even if i turn the quest on and off
---
You can move your camp to a resource node for something that you need.
---
For me its lead because i dont feel like server hopping till the gym resawns the lead weights. 
---
Steel is easy with the locations people mentioned, one clear can get you 400lbs. If you are worried about using up ammo, you can use a weapon that uses a different ammo type to clear so you dont use your primary ammo. I use rifles so i switch to a lever action if i want to conserve 5.56, after a sqb fight for example.
---
Make sure you select ingredients to search for in your pip boy. Cans are a source of lead and steel as well as being light.
---
As for perks, ammosmith and super duper for crafting the ammo, add chemist if crafting gunpowder. With 2 ranks in ammosmith you get 36 rounds of 5.56 instead of 20, and 30% of the time you will get double (72) with super duper.
---
LOL nice one
---
IT'S THE APOCALYPSE! It was my one chance to never be bothered by taxes again, and even when the whole fucking world is literally over, FUCKING TAXES STILL FIND ME!!! 
---
Also, in Sparta, everyone, even a king's messenger, are held accountable for the words of his voice.
---
I wondered about the nuka colas. With the new brewing recipes it seems like a no brainer. Any favorite looting spots?
---
It used to be you could us them both and double dip your chances on some critters but they "fixed" that. So now it depends what your trying to tame. Animal friend is for well animals (bears, foxes, rabits, cats, wolves, sloths ext) wasteland whisper for the weird mutated shit(Deathclaws, mirelurks, snallygasts, moleminers, mothmen ext)
---
I use the same setup, and I am also a shady wasteland doctor. Just works.
---
Well its having no overseer. And instead of voting for who's overseer the vaults AI, ZAX made everybody fight to the death. It's one of those vaults that if it was just empty everyone would nut over it, and say it's amazing story. But since we get to play it, it's bad
---
No, how the fuck did you get that
---
I wouldn't call it death match, Idk just kinda pvp orientated survival
---
Well my build is a mess so I guess here are my best ones:
---
Anti-armour Explosive Handmade
---
Ant-Armour Sub machine gun
---
Instigating Handmade
---
Two shot 25% Faster fire rate 90% Reduced weight 50. Cal
---
Executioners Exploding 50. Cal
---
Instigating Swing speed 1+ Endurance Bladed ski sword
---
Bloodied Vats crits do 50% more damage Lever Action
---
Bloodied Vats crit does 50% more damage 250 Faster reload 10mm Pistol
---
Bloodied 33% Better VATS chance Missile launcher
---
Quad +10% Damage while aiming 250 Resistance while loading Tesla rifle
---
I carry so much I'm encumbered always XD
---
Survival then
---
TSE handmade, bloodied DCG with faster swingspeed
---
Too many resources were already wasted releasing that pile of crap survival mode.  If they release a battle Royale type mode I will have to walk away from this game.
---
 I Have absolute zero interest to PVP in this game even though I love to do it in other games.  With the release of a battle royale mode and countless more resources wasted in my opinion,  I will walk away from this beautiful game. At that point I would see the direction the developers are heading and it's not for me.
---
The point of the post is not one of life. It is merely a fact of wanting other countries being represented by the players which are playing from those countries.
---
Yah sure, Canada was annexed in lore. Doesn’t mean Canadian culture entirely disappeared in that span of time. Literally all I’m asking for is a flag for different countries from around the world.
---
"Are you still a Tadpole?"
---
Most people are sick of battle Royale, it's wouldn't happen
---
dont move you camp, LOL
---
They have blue hair, tattoos and dozens of piercings, it's a new gender developing from societies bathed in plant estrogens, pcbs and foods containing chemicals from plastics.
---
 [BPA](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/plastic-compound-bpa-undermine-masculinity/story?id=13940540)
---
A chemical found in common plastics may undermine a man's masculinity and his ability to attract a female, or at least that's what a new study on mice may suggest.
---
It is the latest research to question the health safety of the hormone-changing compound bisphenol-A, or BPA.
---
I doubt it. Survival wasn't the main chunk of wild Appalachia
---
If they're creating a dedicated deathmatch or BR-esque mode I can't imagine they'd allow the standard perk cards or mutations. Or even that you could bring your own equipment. That's what Survival is for. If they're hoping this update will encourage new players to buy the game or old players to come back, doing something like that would be very counterproductive. 
---
My best guess is they'll either suppress perk cards/mutations during the match or have a terminal that allows you to choose a preset build of sorts. "Gunner", "Scout", "Brawler", etc. 
---
Following that I predict a day 1 glitch that will allow players to have multiple classes or somehow stack the cards on top of themselves for higher than intended bonuses.
---
I'm feeling your pain. 10+ Bog events a day for two months and still no plan to show for it.
---
So if it doesn't appeal to you it's garbage? God your like a spoiled kid
---
With this ED and no received damage reduction it feels useless in close range. If you can't one-shot with your deathclaw gauntlet it will be straight up lost.
---
I would consider investing in mid-range automatic. Maybe you want a plasma flamer and more AG to counter melee.
---
YouTubers: *make videos criticizing the plethora of issues that ruined the game’s launch, as well as the multitude of screw-ups that only got worse in the following weeks*
---
FO76 diehard fanboys: They just call the game bad for moneyyyy!
---
I like the game but it literally was a broken pile of shit on release and all the hate it got was deserved. Bethesda needs to know that releasing games in that state is intolerable
---
I'm a fallout fan, and story isn't the #1 thing, hell I didn't enjoy Fsllout:NV because of its terrible gunplay, crashes and bugs and subpar map
---
And what's wrong with kids enjoying a gsme6
---
Absolutely this, nothing wrong with criticising something for it faults, particularly if you've bothered to experience them, but the 76 hate train was a joke.
---
I'm not
---
A drill and a flare gun.
---
WHY WOULD THEY SUDDENLY START FOCUSING ON BATTLE ROYALE! SURVIVAL CAME OUT AND IT WASNT THE MAIN FOCUS OF WILD APPALACHIA
---
Faschnat isn’t really with the whole American Nostalgia (Is it actually a part of the town in game though in real life? Does the town celebrate it to honour where they come from (Switzerland)
---
Faction PVP would be great, but alas.
---
I don't like game, IT'S LITREALLY THE WORSE THING EVER
---
&gt; whatever the hell you want its irrelevant anyway 
---
Except it's not irrelevant as it is leading to prepubescent children being encouraged to believe they are the wrong sex/gender by their peers, parents and social media pressure and starting early hormone therapy leading to surgical transgender reassignment.
---
All very sad and will lead to misery and suicide in many cases.
---
If it's another gamemode, and functions like br do, it would probably take place in the past
---
i don't understand why it isn't affected by music volume in settings
---
Wait when did I say any of that? I quite liked Fortnite at one point but the aiming system is absolute garbage you can’t really dispute that...? It’s a complaint even Fortnite veteran streamers have constantly.
---
Dude you literally said fortnite is bad
---
Same feelings for walls exactly at the fast travel points, also people parking their character in doorways (WS station for example).
---
Indeed the overseer tapes were awesome.
---
I also kind like scout leader penny sooo much. I would get her right to my camp. Kind of a little joy from the old world.
---
And Dick Shale...got me to be a nukaholic. DAMN YOU DICK SHALE!!
---
But lets be honest - the best is and will be the forever the instructor of the sport badge lol
---
A. They wouldn't do that, it would probably be a seperste gamemode where nothing is dropped, and you have nothing. You pick up weapons you find
---
Right, because it is inherently a larger scale gambling simulator for kids. Did I say it was the worst game ever? No. Far from it. That was NMS on release lol
---
Yeah like all I really want and I can speak for a lot of friends is that we want organized, goal-oriented pvp with actual rewards. I dot. Like BR games, but I figure if Bethesda does vault 51 right, it’ll crush that bad vibe from the words “last man standing. Want more versus events in adventure too, like Monster Mash and The Battle That Never Was
---
Dude, gambling requires money spent. They are playing a free game, picking up weapons, and shooting them, and maybe losing. And there is actual skill involved
---
Completely agree, they wer very interesting. HOWEVER I dont like how they treated thier own when someone turned into a ghoul but... what would you think if someone one day just looked like a zombie, a child for that matter
---
Absolutely, the fallout Fandom has way too much elitism
---
This is why I'll never move my camp ha. Its built around an already existing foundation. Wish it blue printed the whole thing.
---
You personally don't want it, so it's a waste. You are a spoiled brat
---
That is the very definition of a mental condition, however I fully support people finding help and support for illnesses of all kinds and if hormone therapy and transgender reassignment surgery is needed for people who have been born with a brain body mismatch (body dysmorphia?) then I will support you in every way.
---
I look forward to meeting you in the wastes.
---
Like other people said they can shoot you when your there. A guy asked me if he could take mine during a defense I did a thumb up and as soon as I'm checking out defense rewards he begins shooting and chasing me with Explosive weps. In the end I came back after escaping and Mini Nuked him. Owning a workshop all it takes is them contesting it and they can kill you. Taking one can be even harder because you wouldn't know if they'll come back to defend it or not. Store junk
---
I lock 2 of my 3 purifiers because I run out a lot but don't mind sharing the spare.
---
Yeah but use your head for a second here. 
---
The looting is RNG. A large majority of the aiming is RNG. I never said anything about money, they’re gambling countless hours for a single win. 
---
Kids then want to buy their shit and look good while occasionally getting that strong dopamine response.
---
Why settle for one? Get both! I prefer the lmg. No spin up
---
Basically everyone at that time hated Ghouls. Brotherhood still does in the future. I don't know about Responders
---
Dude yes some rewards for me killing dudes like I want people to know I'm the shit and when I take a workshop for it to show amd if I get killed in the world I drop a rank or something bruh make me a legend
---
If I see a group doing this, I usually don't go there in the beginning. Most people/groups give up after an hour and I can do a few circles without interference.
---
People are allowed to have criticisms. Don't like it? Get. Out. Of. This. Sub.  😇 🐈✨
---
There is no such thing as "wrong gender".
---
All games could be said like that.
---
Fallout 76: you kill legendary enemy's and are getting a large dopamine response when you get a good drop.
---
This is the dumbest response I've ever heard. Games are supposed to be fun and enjoyable, you should have some endorphin release. What the fuck do you want kids to play? Fucking torture simulators?
---
Why are there no alternative faiths represented, only churches, where are the mosques and temples.

I don't touch PVP mode with a 100 ft pole...the same will happen if they make a stupid battle royale mode. I'll never do it. Let the trolls and little kids play those stupid modes.
---
I'm on Xbox One and the maps are barely populated as it is.
---
Far right?
---
Yep automatic weapons issue, but only appears on a server with high latency. So your bullets are lost.
---
When I encounter this, changing the world is the first thing to do. Usually fixes the issue.
---
Not true, but keep telling yourself this
---
My tse handmade gives me away fast. Like, if i even am holding it without firing fast. Idk if its a bug or what
---
Absolutely. It's just a circlejerk of hate for a fine game
---
*Instigating Baseball bat
---
*Level 50 All Rise
---
*Executioner's Prime Crossbow
---
*Vampire Ski Sword
---
Usually my TSE Minigun and TS Gatling Gun
---
I have a Quad Vampire Crossbow whenever I feel like building up a rifle build :p
---
It gave no quest rewards or the sheepsquatch gave no loot? The latter would be because you didn't do any damage but you should get rewards for completion. It's mostly just chems but there are some recipes and outfits.
---
Honestly I'm interested.
---
So you can't say 'none of us' :P
---
Could always get longshot to offset this.
---
It’s a feature that just works ;)
---
You’re comparing two completely different genres of game now, don’t reach so much 
---
Yes you get a large dopamine response from getting a legendary drop, BUT YOU KEEP THAT ITEM!!! And get to feel good about using it in the future! And you didn’t have to pay for it! 
---
I’m not saying there’s no endorphin release necessary for games but Fortnite characteristically dangles it in front of your face and leads you along their little path.
---
So if I find the right deathclaw or sloth at the random spawn and use wasteland whisperer level 3 it will give me the tame option? Just confused cause I found one today and tried both cards but neither gave me the option
---
Selling: perk magazines for free.
---
Buying: cheap serums, nuke keycards and max level weapons with the same legendary effect I already had.
---
And variations of this post have been coming out biweekly since Beta.
---
Worth it
---
Yep, one of the few youtubers that bothered to put some real time into the game before uploading a proper well thought out review, he's the reason i finally bought it.
---
You don't have to pay for drops in fortnite
---
&gt;not enough people can come out
---
I'm sorry I support your personal struggle but that just sounds bizarre, you are a tiny minority of the world population and will always be so.
---
Black prospect hat is what I am using and hunters long coat
---
I often had a radroaches in tier 0. I don't think it's just dependent on the rating 1/3 because I got a deathclaw even on level 1/3. I think it just adds a higher chance to get one of the better mobs. Can anybody conform?
---
thanks for all who contributed to the poll
---
Peter Dinklage as raider riding a tamed death claw...
---
???
---
Thanks for all the info on your different takes, I agree re the sneaking having something iffy with it. Instigating plus sneak damage should be nuts but I find it lacking so not sure if it's my build (I try to generalise but often forget to switch from heavy gunner perks from queen fights)
---
You edited your comment omg
---
Are you trying to say that you DON'T like radworms!? Wtf...
---
Never played it, I can't really comment. But I'm happy when I'm not traceable on the map. That is as long as I'm not top 3. :-)
---
Sure, i use a lot of vats so i dont use it. But if you ads and need the extra range, why not.
---
Well said mate.
---
Other can add things but they can't move already placed stuff.
---
Drops aren’t even the part of the dopamine response I’m referring to, which brings this conversation to a close for me. Keep riding epics monopoly train
---
Whitesprings on a bench near to overlook to the golf field
---
Epics monopoly hahahahahahahahahahahahabahaahshahahahahahaahahahahahahahwahahahah
---
Okay you now have changed what you're talking about 3 times
---
Also what dopamine are you talking about?
---
Skins? Because you can earn v bucks without paying.
---
And what monopoly train?
---
I am not offended at all by the thought of a BR or TDM/DM mode
---
I think people who are into PVP will be stoked on it
---
Ah see in that interview he says there isnt any but hes taljing in context of before the game came out, he doesnt say they they will never add any just that there isnt any but there will be robots.  
---
I personally take that just as face value that, in the current version of the game there isnt any human npcs
---
Or you can just glitch through an open window by activating a workbench inside or by placing your power armor inside :)
---
Okay. ^okay
---
Happy Christmas.
---
The thing I'm most worried about is any new game mode because it kinda splits the existing player base and makes it harder to get many people for events. 
---
But yeah, especially battle royal would be the worst option of game modes for me...
---
Depends on the event. Scorched Earth, Encryted and Project Paradise need groups so definitely yes. Campfire tales is doable solo but still better as a group. 
---
I think the spawnrates change if there are more players. Now, this is fairly inconsistant but I have found some events like Line in the sand and Census Violence have had way more enemies show up with more people present which makes them far more fun. There are still the odd occasions where you get one enemy per wave though. Typical FO76 glitchyness I guess.
---
fortnite is a johnny come lately to BR.. not a pioneer...
---
Thanks dad.
---
So you scrap the Strength, where do you move it and what perks?
---
Male, Female aaaand what else ????
---
We are going to convert lots!
---
Super Mutant.
---
Similar, yes. But it depends on whether he's suggesting the weapon spawns are static or not along with the map size being smaller.
---
But based on the datamined info it sounds like nukes and a shrinking zone of some kind will be in play, which nixes the "smaller arena" idea.
---
Unless they're tiny little tac nukes and the "arena" is the size of a regular nuke zone.
---
They are all in the Nuka Cola room of that one frat house. You can get a bunch just from going back in whenever you are in the area
---
Isnt the game already like a battle royale
---
Gender Fluid / Non binary should do
---
If you was on PC id be your man. Need people to play with like 24/7.
---
Yes, but it would make people do godlike damage, and pretty much destroy the game.
---
OK so you are trolling, well done, it was a fun thread that did spawn some interesting replies. Good game my man good game :)
---
After reading your post I have no idea what side you’re on but either way , suck my nuts
---
I've had this issue. The only way I've found of 'fixing' the problem is storing the item (in your case the roof section) that the turret was placed on. Go to your stored items in the build menu and the turret should be there. I've found this only works when the turret is still taking up the C.A.M.P budget 'footprint' when you first placed it down but has disappeared from view.
---
Hope this helps :)
---
Add me on Xbox for help with completing this event! Under the same name: ohh Ataraxia
---
And a huge majority never wanted a multiplayer Fallout. Best way to deal with it is to simply not play the game mode, Bethesda is beyond caring about your thoughts or opinions.

Nah man Super Mutant, Ghoul, scorched and like ruck it robots. Non Binary and Gender Fluid tho, I'd say no.

Scorchbeasts should always drop legendary loot as well. I killed 2 yesterday because they got in my....got nothing useful
---
On ps4 I have all 7 paint jobs for the t60 bos
---
Shit happened to me constantly. Before patch 9, several people would follow me to my camp and blow it up because I wouldn’t pvp with them. They always blocked me so I couldn’t find them on the map to report for harassment. Even had a full group of people who knew each other, over the course of a week, do nothing but blow up my camp if they saw me on server (my PSN is not hard to remember), and then message taunts and insults all because I wouldn’t pvp with them. I was level 60-ish at the time. They were all 150+.
---
Think he was just referring to using for example shotgunner, expert shotgunner and master shotgunner all rank 1 being more powerful than using 1 rank 3 shotgunner perk
---
I gotcha, I atleast play once a day. Sometimes without a mic though as long as that doesnt bother ya. GT:: AlexAutoAxe

I need to get more familiar with each of the events, so I know the ones that are better in groups.
---
I'm pretty sure that one vote is yours, though.
---
the irony, makes a post crying about ppl crying lol
---
then i guess this makes you a "cray baby conservative" or just and other " cry baby liberal" lmao
---
Probably would be helpful for them to add a ‘don’t remind me again’ checkbox when it first comes up to avoid it popping up every time you check your perks, guess that’s a wholeeee new post needed in order for Bethesda to see it haha
---
I don’t mind the drop rate. Sure it sucks throwing 1000 rounds of ammo and breaking your gun and armor going against the SBQ to get a 1* instigating pitch fork when you’re a ranged build, but that’s gaming. What they should do is increase or eliminate the 150 daily script or make the weight limit for player vending separate from your actual stash. Then I doubt so many would mind as much.

Cool.I actually visited your underground bunker i was the owl taking pictures lol

Lol made me audibly laugh

Then deletes it, brilliant..

Just why? Lol

Lmao no shit? Thanks man! lol added ya, I'm off work the next two days so hit me up whenever you're on

Honk honk

Never heard of him so went to his channel and searched Fallout 76. Jesus this guy has a real hardon for bashing Bethseda doesn't he?
---
Tons of clickbait. Tons of videos bashing the company. Tons of videos bashing the merchandise, at least four separate videos on the bag cockup alone. Tons of videos bashing the game developers. Tons of videos regurgitating pieces written by others, not seeing much that looks like actual original content though, but his patreon link everywhere you look so that's nice.
---
Firsthand gameplay critiques? I'm still looking for one of those.
---
There's plenty of other games to suit your tastes then, and you're in the minority of players. Bye
---
Handmades mostly:
---
* Lvl 45 2\* **Assassin's** Handmade w/ Explosive, mostly vs robots
---
* Lvl 45 2\* **Executioner's** Handmade w/ +50% limb damage, primed against the SBQ
---
* Lvl 45 1\* **Exterminator's** Handmade, mostly vs mirelurks
---
* Lvl 45 3\* **Furious** Handmade w/ 25% faster fire rate &amp; AGI, mostly against Ghouls, Mole Miners or Cryptids
---
* Lvl 45 1\* **Hunter's** Handmade, mostly vs Yao Guai or Deathclaws
---
* Lvl 45 2\* **Mutant slayer's** Handmade w/ 25% faster fire rate, against Super Mutants
---
* Lvl 45 2\* **Zealot's** Handmade w/ 10% dmg while aiming and VATS Crit speed, primed against Scorched &amp; SBQ
---
Yep, that's 5 x 24 lbs + 2 x 18lbs = 156 lbs of guns. The chances of getting them in 3\* weightless is pretty slim. At least all my armor are Weightless Ultra-light build under the PA...
---
Exactly , not that many people want a battle royale because the pvp system in bad
---
Darn tootin' it does
---
Bloody greens
---
Tesla and lever rifle. It didn't start out like this ( in the Burrows ) just started happening as I was 2/3 of the way through.
---
Haha 9%, but as usual they'll pander to the minority. What a game changing, positive and virtuous addition to the game. 
---
Will be cool to play as a non binary demi mutant, that sometimes identifies as a ghoul, sometimes as a deathclaw, sometimes as nothing at all. My pronouns will be XE/xur/she he/NPC, but don't you dare assume my gender you NAZI's!!
---
Welcome to the clown world!!
---
HONK HONK!!
---
They likely would have to pay for more rights to the music and go through more deals to get an updated list. I have work today but after I get home I'll post a Galaxy News Radio themed pandora that someone created which I use when playing. It gives variety and fits in rather well.
---
only if you get hits in if the turrets do all of the killing you get no loots.
---
Bruh all this talk about battle royale, pve etc all I want is a Mexican poncho and sombrero for my guy fr
---
This could be a reintroduction of bugs that were squashed in previous patches.
---
Yeah i'd like to play as a toaster
---
Wait.. 1 vote? I mean I did vote.. but what about the other people who voted yes?
---
Perhaps he was sneezing.
---
Thank you so much! It's so difficult to do I'd you want play with other people to know. Seriously appreciated! I'll be online in about 3 hours or so &lt;3
---
Take the honk pill
---
No problem friend. Looking forward to it.
---
She he NPC, Clown world is great. The world is nothing more than a comedy show now
---
A movement would mean more than a handful of deranged ideologues on Twitter lol.
---
Wait. Is our disease resistance actually quantified somewhere we can see that they’d assign a +25 buff to it?
---
Pls no BR
---
RNG, my friend.
---
Endurance overall needs a pretty significant buff, most of the perks and how much health boost you get with each point in it maybe also give it X radiation passive resistance as well.
---
I recently had to lock my "power room" as the switches in there was getting powered down which in turn locked my airlock styled dooor system.
---
As the owner and operator of the “No Tell Motel” my water is open, crops are for the taking and my junk extractor is there for everyone. You ummmmm might wanna wash them off first though.
---
you have refined my thoughts on the matter. I think you hit the nail on the head its not so much that they shouldn't listen to the forums but they need a way to tap that silent player base. currently they're underrepresented
---
Never noticed that? Then that affects loot? You can turn a 1star into a 3?
---
I want battle royal bruh
---
you don't speak for me
---
I think people hate on it because the genre exploded with so many offerings so fast. And just like with a new, popular genre of music... There are a few winners, a few losers and a whole lot of participation ribbons. 
---
Oversaturation of can ruin things for a lot of people.
---
Wow the people in these comments sure are triggered
---
You people are so selfish is unbelievable, This is why this sub is known on some youtube channels for being toxic and the softest gaming community. You just want to stay in the safety of adventure mode where nothing can kill you and there are no threats. But guess what, some people like a challenge and the only threat in this game are other players.
---
And you are posting this for karma points which is sad.
---
Good plan. The animation for the explosives needs to be turned down a bit.
---
True dude I and the old mustaches from fallout new Vegas the Mexican ones
---
I have one and I love it
---
When you first posted, there was only one 'yes'. I don't know now, and honestly, this is totally unnecessary.
---
You can be whatever in this game. Even a cannibal with a Shao Kahn mask who sneaks into people's houses leaving paper bags full of pelvis bones and rib cages. 
---
Why do you need a videogame to put a label for you to define yourself?
---
Yeah, bigotry is rife
---
Several questions. 
---
There is only one Alpha? 
---
And the biome it spawns in defines what type it is? 
---
What determines in which biome it spawns? Is it pure RNG like a "An Alpha creature spawned in Biome A" message? and then all people rush to this Biome? 
---
Do the normal mobs stop spawning when the Alpha spawns or do you have to defend them still while most of the people kill the Alpha?
---
Yea has happened several times to me. It is funny how pathetic people can be.
---
Just some info for your next (lets hope bug free) run: if one of the launch chiefs gets destroyed during the launch prep, you can order a replacement for him at the corresponding terminal.
---
People with other posts downvote, so their post gets a better look at. Cynical really. Upvote everything that deserves it is my thoughts.
---
I think there will be a lot of wasted scrip trying to get what we really want the way it is but I think it's here to stay.
---
Now I try to farm WS type legendaries ( usually 1 star ) to feed the Legendary Vendor. So I don't put anything decent in there. Not as painful when I get a sh#t drop.
---
Buy up 5.56 ammo and use that as your savings account
---
I usually sell things that are impossible to get or very rare for 1.000 caps, things that are very hard to get or that most people don't know how to get for 500 caps each. I don't sell "normal" stuff. They sell at an ok rate, and since it can sometimes be a bother for me to restock I don't need it to sell fast.
---
Depends on your build, if you run adrenaline reaction and nerd rage id say furious, anything else vampire. Furious will put out the most damage in my opinion
---
Lol I buy whichever one you don't want if you're on Xbox. But I'd use the Vampires Exploding one, although it really depends on your build and what you prefer. If you're comfortable with consistent fire and good accuracy, I'd use the furious one.
---
Tough choice...i would go with furious when facing a mob boss. And vampires for general use or crowd control. Vampires explosive has the immidiate higher damage output but furious eventually (after 10 shots) does more damage. Both good guns.
---
They are both great depending on what you are fighting. I routinely switch between the two when fighting the Queen. LMG to mow down minions. Gatling for the Queen. 
---
Any weapon that can move her health bar is awesome. The Gatling does.
---
In order to exploit the market you need to understand supply, demand and  scarcity. Most people do not and come here on Reddit teach you lessons since *they are veterans*.
---
Most people fail to understand how quickly you can get, on a daily basis, 1400 \* 5 caps (it takes more time to load a char and travel than getting the goods to sell). Many don't even understand what *on a daily basis* means tbh.
---
If you check market pages, you see around 90% of the listed items don't even get a single reply. Everything listed is flagged as *high tier*. Even stimpaks. No matters what the item is, if it is a TSE everyone goes crazy.
---
Let them talk (*you are the best, of course you know how the market works*). If you have to shut down your machines multiple times a day to avoid passing 25K, you are doing it right. Otherwise, you might rethink your strategy.
---
Both? I'd use the Explosive against distanced enemies such as Super Mutants, Sheepsquatches or Mirelurk Queens. I'd use the Furious against close quarters enemies (that run up to you) such as Ghouls, Yao Guai or Deathclaws. I'd also consider priming the Furious against the SBQ.
---
The RPG aspect of both Elder Scrolls and Fallout has been sorely lacking of late. Both Skyrim and Fallout 4 have been massively streamlined as Bethesda tries to appeal to the widest audience possible. Unfortunately I don't see that changing soon either. Linear experiences are easier and quicker to make than large branching stories.
---
FYI I liked Skyrim and Fallout 4, but found them lacking in RPG elements. My favorite F4 mod is one that re-adds skills so there's more build uniqueness and less "you have to pick these skills for damage"
---
I didn't know this level of egotism even existed.
---
Thank you for the tip as well.
---
Meanwhile .... I struggle building a basic box CAMP lol.  This really is awesome though.
---
We're all just straight white males that need to step aside for progress. HONK HONK!
---
No, they are received through the Enclave  quest line as a reward and you can't sell them.
---
Should be the case. Now I haven't gone hunting for tameables sense the last pacth where they "fixed" it so there's a chance they broke it. Keep in mind it has to be a random spawn and has to spawn alone. The deathclaw spawn has a chance of spawning fighting a bunch of super mutants so you gotta save her first. If it's the sloth and spawns with dead baby's (rip) that one won't be tameable
---
For killing in the name of: 
---
AA gatling gun
---
Bloody 10%ADS gatling gun
---
Troubleshooters Explosive gatling gun
---
TSE reload DR (super duped flavor) gatling gun
---
Zealots explosive primed gatling gun
---
For killing in the face of:
---
All rise
---
For tagging in events like:
---
Vampires faster reload automatic 10mm pistola 
---
With bear arms all that mess is like what,  20 lbs? 
---
My dream would be to get each of those with the 90% suffix and save the 3 strength points.
---
They either made it br or they didn't, your comment would be too late in the dev cycle
---
It's the same thing. It just has a paint on it that causes the name to be "prototype X01"
---
What fuck's.
---
completed full sets of everything - went to players offered power armor to lend or just have. none of them wanted it. pitched it all time for another experiment I guess. :/
---
Weird. This only happens to one of my 3 characters. The other two, fine. And storing the thing the turret was sitting on, and then going into stored items to find the turrets doesn’t help. Eventually I run almost completely out of turrets and have to start over with a new camp.
---
Yes but is there a non-prototype XO1 power armour? Because every video I’ve watched it shows how to get the prototype plans which I’ve already got.
---
It's more likely to be a TDM than a BR considering the engine can barely handle 24 people
---
aae handmade as main, aae ultracite laser rifle as backup.  tse 10mm as sidearm, and bloodied SS super sledge just incase.
---
They need validation like plants need the sun.
---
Wilst under level 20
---
Player base is 22 people? Pretty sure the player base is more than 22 that have currently voted
---
Wow seriously? 900 hours and you've only seen it once?! 
---
I mean they're pretty rare and all(~300 hours and I've seen it 4-5 times). But that's over a month of nonstop gameplay without spotting that glowing purple dweeb. 
---
That's some seriously strange luck! Hopefully you're getting repaid in god-tier legendaries every other roll.
---
There is no actual x-01 power armor anywhere, it is only craftable and mods are are only sold by Modus
---
I am in the same boat, the EU / Scandinavian servers are really boring, nothing goes on in them.
---
Used to have a lot of US players on my Friend list, but they have all stooped playing, so can't jump to the US servers anymore :(
---
So would love some new friends :)
---
I play several GT's would be nice if the all could join some new players, my Gt's are:
---
Main lv185:   Spawn3232, lv90: Insultatron3232 and my new "girl" lv52: AlleSkalFa
---
Ps, "Alle skal fa" should translate from Norwegian to English in something like: Every one will get some, lol
---
I mean, i have had multiple 3* heads, its just the purveyor
---
Thanks I was really confused because this website was listing all the PA stats and listed XO1 and prototype XO1 as two different things
---
I love the title. I know a certain youtuber will mention it in their next video.
---
This happens when you alt+tab during a load screen.  Only resolved by restarting your game.
---
You need to keep multiple friendlies alive to receive better loot. I got the plans one of the only times i kept all three friendlies alive. I made a post about waiting for more people to show up since there is a 30 minute timer on the event and it only takes 10 minutes to do and a lot of people were saying things like “don’t tell us how to play the game”.  If you want better loot, keep more things alive, just like in free range.
---
let me caviet that by saying i haven't really kept anything late game yet. best two weapons i use are a 1* level 40 and a 1* level 45. weapon upgrades and my build have helped, but my dmg output is still terrible. 
---
hoping to buy into a decent weapon via vendor at some point..
---
 **🤡** 🌏 **🤡**

Are they good for anything other than the benefits of drinking them?

Arnold S just read this post and said "I don talk liike dat!"
---
oh i did not realize all the death claws are females... ok I'm sold boy death claws it is wonder if they are more cheerfuller you know not so bitchy all the time.
---
Yes but I speak for the 9%
---
There should be a Christmas holiday side quest called 'thirst, thirstiest time of the year' where you meet a robot called LeVron Jives, who tells you he's a Nuka-Cola recipe Collector and has been trying to locate a crashed plane somewhere in the hills of appalachia holding the recipe to Nuka Cola Cranberry. 
---
When you get there there should be a few nuka cola robots guarding the plane and one 3 star legendary Sentry bot named 'Sbyte', who gives you a 3 star legendary unique lever-action painted like a Christmas tree, along with the paint plan itself when killed. 
---
When you complete the quest after returning to LeVron, you get the Nuka Cola Cranberry Recipe, Nuka Mixer Station Plan, Nuka Cola Recipe, and a Christmas Sweater With a Santa-fied Bottle and Cappy on the front and a Nuka-girl on the back. A Christmas tree decoration would be sweet too, with Nuka-Cola themed ornaments.
---
Every day you can return to LeVron to Do a Repeatable Quest and every time you do it you get a new recipe for Nuka-Cola, Including all the Makeshift ones from the Nuka-world DLC like Nuka-sunshine and Nuka-whateverelse.
---
Looking back on all this, I actually think this would be a sweet addition to the game
---
Why do you need a label to define yourself, I repeat.
---
A weapon is either a pistol, or rifle, auto, or non, not all at once. This game may not be super realistic, but it at least manages to partially understand how guns work. You can already munchkin the fuck out of this game, don't try to find MORE reasons for Bethesda to nerf shit please.
---
Well it gives us a good idea of how big the movement is
---
Unless its radworms.
---
Everyone has radworms. All the time.
---
Yeah that seems to be what happens to me as well.
---
Juicehead... Yongyea Hello there
---
Not true. As I said the pipe pistol counts as both with the rifle stock. So does the 10mm pistol with optimized receiver count as non auto as well.
---
Not my fault the game is a mess.
---
I offer bobby pins in one of my machines for 100 caps each, best way to accept donations... I'm dropping more and more items' prices to zero, though, because I just want to free stash space.
---
I will take up leaving most plans in random suitcases (or the purveyor's cigarette machines, for what it's worth) again, though. Same for extra trash legendaries after I've met my daily scrip limit.
---
tbh if it its then it will get more people playing the game. I myself haven't played in quite a while now and I can say for sure that if a br mode was introduced I'd play it - and get back into the base game too.
---
Wanting interesting social interactions isn't griefing.  It's endgame content.  Not a hard concept to understand.
---
I usually try my luck and join most events I'm interested in, other players present or not. With the exception of the harder ones where you have to work as a team, as someone mentioned in another comment.  
---
One that went straight over my head for the longest time was Uranium Fever. It's totally doable solo, but of course fun if more people join. There's always (in my experience) at least one 2 star legendary and one 3 star legendary enemy spawn. It's one of the easier events and the payoff is good, so I say join that whenever you can! It's to the east of WS in Blackwater Mine. Sometimes the event marker jumps around so just scan the general vicinity until you find it. Or just go directly to the mine and join the good ole fashion way.
---
I have a seperate building for work benches, it has my vendors on it's deck. Then my cooking stove, brewing station, and fermenting station are all on the balcony of my house. Still my farm and purifier are both open to the public. I've never seen my purifier empty and I put extra boiled water in my purifier for free. That's beside the fact that when I try to get rid of my purified water in the field... I come back with more than I started with anyways. So I never worry.
---
Although the only door I do lock is my generator shed's door. Got sick of coming back to C.A.M.P. to find the door open and more damage on my fusion generator.
---
When you craft X01 it comes with a paint named prototype and it names all the armor prototype if you remove the paint you can't put it back on there are 4 base game non atom shop paints for X01
---
prototype: comes  with it when you craft it cant be replaced if removed
---
nuka qauntum: from an unmarked side quest kind of hard to get
---
military: buy it from modus in the armory 
---
and the stock metal when it has no paint
---
I was able to get the bear arms plan and stimpak diffuser plan last night. All three friendlies lived when they dropped. Did the event many times with one friendly living and only received formula p, lab coat, and bear arm weapon (not the plan). Still have yet to get the arkos backpack skin. Can someone confirm how many friendlies lived when they got this drop?
---
Do events always have a chance of dropping a legendary weapon?
---
I wonder if Bethesda would go all-in on BR for NW. Some players would love that of course, but there is clearly a significant player base that would not play it. It would make more sense to me for them to offer something for everyone in NW.
---
No it's the pipe revolver. But only when you mod a rifle stock on it, it will count as both
---
I lost all mine last night. Went to photo gallery and it was empty. Group pics and lots of wasteland memories gone for good.
---
Wastelanders is that what makes big changes to the story. Nuclear Winter is already implemented into the game and finish to start and yeah it looks like its going to be a Battle Royale Mode.
---
But is it not time to forgive and move on from said hatred? The game isn’t what it was at release, it’s in my personal opinion better, much better.
---
The weird thing is this is available at workshops where you can craft a door mat for fast travelling and place it wherever you like.  This cannot be done at you camp
---
Well when it's been 5+ minutes of trying and i make it clear that I'm not interested, it feels an awful lot like griefing - not a hard concept to understand
---
Nuka Grape for rads
---
All others just depends, think one deals with API
---
One of my friends just uses nukas over stims
---
Most voice files sound bad if you play them straight from the folder, they are designed to be played in a certain area with a certain music and with an in-game filter to make it sound more "real". But I agree it could have been better.
---
when I want to melee AA deathclaw/ supresor powerfist

or a TSE handmade

I hope you haven't been passed my camp and passed because of the free boiled water in my vending machine...
---
FO76 is my first MMORPG. What would be the difference between Survival Mode and Battle Royale? A timer?
---
I don’t see many of the people I have added as friends in Survival Mode. Maybe 1 out of 7 active players and then they’re only there for a couple hours.
---
It is a tiered loot table. The more friendlies live, the better loot you get. I have gotten the plan twice and both were with all 3 friendlies alive
---
Oh okay thanks. I've been doing the event on my own usually and people didn't start showing up until the alpha fight.
---
I define myself by gender
---
Thanks for the info on the backpack skin
---
My CAMP is at its second location. The only time I moved it was to be next to a water source for a purifier. The game gave me so many issues trying to build the CAMP at the current location I’m afraid to try to move it.
---
To be more inclusive of others, okay?
---
And do you need a label in a videogame to tell you what you are or what defines you?
---
I saw him once, to the south of the waste disposal area in the southern area of the divide, in the middle of nowhere. It attacked me asap, I shot it down and I got a nice pic of it :D
---
I hope not too - need something new in terms of lore and scenery.
---
Great idea!!!
---
Bethesda, do this!
---
Convert
---
If this is for the legendary weapon challenge, a rainstorm is fine. Take a picture of something that makes a name appear in the upper righthand corner like an enemy or player.
---
I was wondering if there was an Atom reward for collecting or consuming all of them.
---
He is trying to get a vats hit on the player .
---
We do have a sense of humor and that's why you got downvoted, that joke is beaten to death 100 times over.
---
**General**: see [resource maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/) if you are willing to travel a lot.
---
**Acid**: Moderately difficult without killing. Either hop to vendors and buy bulk Acid or find one of the [non-workshop acid](https://i.imgur.com/bIViWhB.jpg) nodes. With some killing (like versus weapons) the following locations yield animals that drop acid reliably and cheaply: *Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast, Middle Mountain Cabins, Silo Alpha, Seneca Rocks Visitor Center, Monongah Overlook, Dolly Sods Wilderness, Toxic Larry's Meat &amp; Go, Abandoned Waste Dump, Fissure sites*.
---
**Steel**: Resource nodes or crafting and scrapping armor with Super Duper and Scrapper perks repeatedly. (It's a bit slow, but if you are on PC, you can press E and Enter together to make it faster. Also do it in streaks like up to 150 crafts at once, otherwise the server will kick you out and roll back just you.)
---
**Lead:** Lucky Hole mine with Excavator, as you probably already knew.
---
Photos are NOT saved in the cloud they are local to your system they can be deleted and changed manually 
---
also I would like to know 
---
what console or pc?
---
did you reinstall or change the files at all?
---
Why?
---
You know, that's a good question. I've just been buying them to collect and be able to sell things back, but haven't taken them all.
---
I'd prefer an Xbox achievement over atoms though, I'm up to like 1600 atoms with nothing of interest to get from the Atomic Shop
---
I’m with you regarding dmg output, mainly for 2 reasons:
---
- I don’t like the builds that are better for it
---
- I don’t have any explosive weapons, never found them on drops or vendors
---
No but gender is my preference, For example I'm sure you have a list of pronouns you specifically ask people you speak with to refer you as, like they/them, he/she ect
---
Thanks! I'll defiantly try it out!
---
Currently on Xbox One X, and nope never messed with the files.
---
I'm a ho for Nuka-Cola stuff so I may be biased, but it love it!
---
yes this matters still confused about this one why the hell did We name the person (boy and/or girl not other) anyways.
---
Thanks!
---
Once you get to a certain level, there isn't much more to buy. And fine tuning your weapons is a long drag if your current gun is 70% perfect already, looking for the same weapon but with 15% faster reload gets boring.
---
Thankyou!!
---
Oh this is 100% sarcasm lol.  I’m mocking all the people who keep asking for ridiculous things.  I feel bad for the developers.  You know they work really hard but they get shit all the time because people want things that suit just them.
---
I really hope they implement it, it would be an amazing and fun thing to do with friends!
---
What happens when you have max rank of each card though? What does it give back then? Bonus attribute points to move around? Seems like it would be possible for "max rank all cards" to happen faster than it is possible now but there would still be level-ups available.
---
Launch a nuke, they also count
---
be less hoardy...
---
The rifle.would be sweet too!
---
I want a DLC that adds more genders
---
No, I don't tell people that they should call me in a particular way.
---
I *act* based on what I define myself to be, of who I think I am, and *then* other people react to that and treat me accordingly.
---
Take a selfie with the ProSnap Deluxe Camera - Priceless!
---
Hopefully they add a Nuka-Cola Bottle Gender with this one!
---
If I spawn stuck inside a camp's foundation and then travel away and run back to the camp, to then find it being attacked by npc's, I let them destroy the camp as punishment to the camp owner for not checking the god damn spawn point!!
---
I think that's good of you, and I respect your choice HOWEVER
---
How often do people misgender you? I'd find that to happen alot if I didn't tell people what I was
---
Awh, I know it’s hard to understand the difference between criticism and asking for selfish things, but let me clarify for you and all the others who don’t get my post.  
---
Coming to the developers with a real problem and real suggestion that will benefit all players.  That’s great, fantastic even, but whining because pvp is “hard” and grinding legendary enemies is hard and Asking the developers to make the game easier because of it...that is ridiculous.  If you can’t understand that, re. Read. Again. 🐈✨ And I love a copy cat, so please bring that cat emoji with the sparkle farts to the Internet.  😈
---
so you know what everyone want? id like another pvp system tbh. the current system isnt the fun for a lot of pvper. the meta is: get a stealthboy and just pew pew everyone. they surely have to improve this.
---
fallout 76 was pve AND pvp from the beginning. there is still a big pvp community.
---
if they implement a new pvp system, this wont change anything in pve. so you still can play everyday and it still will be amazing.
---
id like to see more pve content, too. but a battle royale wont be a bad thing. its just another game mode. if they would implement mods we would already have this game mode. id like pvp without mutations and vats and stealth. just pure pvp.
---
on the other side i fully understand you that it would be a cool thing to get big content updates in pve and that working on new pvp modes doesnt affect the progress of new pve content.
---
My problem is that I price TSE items at like 10,000 but they sell. Problem is that at the time I'm already max caps. So I get nothing. I'd love a separate bank for the machines.
---
Kevduit is another one who likes the game, but recognizes it's flaws as well. I mostly watch him for his ESO content, but he's got a few FO76 videos and seems to really enjoy the game.
---
get good.
---
You can place multiple workbenches and stashes. For example, some outside the building and some inside the building which you could possibly take advantage of the choke points, etc. You can even set up "shop" in one tiny room and seemingly leave the place unguarded...
---
I vats shot a molerat 7 times before it died. Not a huge deal but it was the last enemy in my workshop defense quest. I've been noticing it on molerats and radroaches myself, lately.
---
New game mods, new area
---
“Nahhh don’t try new things Bethesda”
---
Give it a shot dude
---
This was my entire point.  My whole post is mocking the people who are whining about making the game easier for them.  Or better for them.  A lot of the threads I see in here are not suggestions that will benefit all players.  They’re selfish requests that only appease to one person.  It’s ridiculous and I think it’s about time someone said it.
---
get dabbed on
---
he'll never be legendary
---
You need to give people time to know you.
---
I always kill the, hey, it's even free xp :D
---
its you
---
Okay cool I’m level 300 so level should be fine I have found the deathclaw fighting super mutants I just might not have had the right card on at the time just trying to work out if it’s one card or both really but thanks for the help
---
That isn't the case with me, they always spawn on the edge of a lake in front of my house
---
Collection possum badge does require you to collect all nuka colas
---
Yep it has and our weapons stay shit, i do so hope thay'll fix those things. It's my only reall annoyance with the game ^^
---
2 caps
---
Hmmmmmmmm
---
Well you've given me an awfully lot to ponder upon, do you not think it's alright to have more genders in the game however? I feel awful now.
---
I love story driven and pve but I don't mind pvp as long as it doesn't bother my experience with the game. Personally, I think they should start fixing the many bugs that are in the game before they release nuclear winter. Even if they do add a Battle Royale mode I won't mind because it probably won't effect my standard gamemode experience and it'll probably add new features to regular survival anyways, I don't see why people are making such a big deal over this.
---
this guy
---
I agree with you here. They have turned Adventure into too much of a Carebear mode. Removing slap damage? Great for anti-griefing.  Protecting CAMPS? Great for anti-griefing. But now, if I spend the caps to fast travel to a workshop to kill someone, they can just stand slightly outside the border and be completely safe. Then, at a moment entirely of their choosing, they can pop in and enjoy even more of an advantage than defending players normally enjoy. Or wait for their friends to show up. Had one guy assemble a whole crew, none of whom I could attack until they stepped slightly inside the circle and simultaneously fired fat mans. I, of course, instantly died.   
---
Workshop mechanics WERE fine -- even when someone could show up at your location and attack you if their friend claimed the workshop. Kind of a slimy tactic in my opinion, but when you take a workshop you agree to be open to PVP -- period. I kind of liked knowing that if I had a workshop, I was in constant danger. It balanced out the rewards for owning one and made sense -- though more could have been done to protect CAMPs in this scenario (but not players, you assume the risk of death when you take a workshop).   
---
I've had a lot less fun since they listened to the whiners and made defensive griefing a thing. New system is far too easy for defending players to cheese (just as I predicted many times).  
---
As for battle royale, please no. People have Fortnite, APEX, and PUBG for that (and I hate all of them).
---
Agreed, I am starting a campaign movement to make fo76 have more genders. Any and all ideas are welcome
---
Boo
---
Honestly, I don't have anything else to do so I just constantly look at my map for an event to start.
---
Nope you where trolling if you want to discuss something and offer counterpoints to my actual statements we can discuss. But making vague statements that don't reflect what I'm talking about is trolling
---
The first sentence is not true, but the rest I agree with.  That was my point with this post.  It’s ridiculous to whine about PvP and making legendary enemies 100% drop a 3*.  The game is suppose to be challenging. If it wasn’t, I don’t think it would be as fun.
---
Future patch: Perk Card vendor (hopefully)
---
Totally Agree.  
---
In addition, please make Survival Mode permadeath, that should toughen up the "keyboard warriors".  
---
Meanwhile, I'm over here enjoying Adventure Mode, just how Fallout 76 should be.
---
Man I'd pay 300 scrip just have some backstory or lore added to the Purveyor.
---
I've seen it randomly in my daily quest in my pip boy honestly no idea what triggered it though sorry I know thats not helpful
---
I shall repeat my self, slowly.
---
All. Criticisms. Are. Allowed. Here.
---
How is this concept so difficult for you? You may not agree with them, I may not agree with them, but they are still allowed here. 
---
You quite simply need to accept that.
---
👁👄👁 (underrated emoji combo)
---
Great advice. Ta very much :)
---
INB4 they add it and it runs flawlessly 😂😂
---
(Kidding, I completely agree with you)
---
same problem. I heard if you fast travel near by and run to the lab it'll work but I haven't tried yet.
---
I don't run with either of those perks sadly. But I do run with demolition expert so my damage is significantly higher with the Vampire. Thanks for the tip though :) I'll consider using adrenaline when I have some spare perk points
---
Well, last week i got 2 laser rifles one is BE other is only B with vats fill, both breaks very fast, so maybe the explo dont influence much.
---
Also they take a lot of resources to repair.
---
I really hope they fix it.
---
I’m 100% for feedback that actually benefits the game, but people asking for the stash limit to be like fallout 4.  People asking for 3* enemies to always drop a 3* item.  People asking for a hug emote?  That’s selfish needs that only benefit them and I don’t consider that feedback.  I consider that whining and they should take it elsewhere.  Because there are real ideas that real players have that would make the game amazing but how would we know when this thread is littered with pointless posts?
---
I simply think it's not necessary. You don't need anyone to tell you who you are - only you can define yourself.
---
And certainly you don't need a videogame for that.
---
You know, I actually wrote that to incite a certain reaction from you - and I was not mistaken. Who are you to tell people to leave the game when not conforming to your subjective view? A bit cryptofascist, hey? Bye.
---
apparently juicehead or rifle gaming has a video about it on YouTube if you wanna check that out
---
If I were to sell them, what would be the right price? :)
---
Mine seems pretty consistent but I'm running speed demon which effects that stuff not seen a change.
---
if you want add me, my name is theraviolimonster. i could also show you a discord that is full of people that are always playing
---
if you've never played it then how do you know it's like this
---
I feel like this is an elaborate troll
---
Hahahaha
---
You’re still missing my point 😂 the criticism is not the problem.  The whining is.  Whining is not criticism otherwise every toddler in the world would be a critic.  
---
0.0 that emoji combo just blew my mind.
---
I agree with you I want the excitement of knowing I can get merked any second and battle royal would be kinda bad but I can see them working it out honestly what if they do like you don't start with you're gear but find you're own gear that you own around the map as it shrinks and maybe you end up with you're full set of sentieniel armor and a shitty weapon. From you're stash or maybe good weapon and no armor I mean it's a thought
---
i seen someone trying to sell a persevered pie for 25k caps
---
His vagina face! xD
---
I agree this is a mmorpg, if you’ve ever played a hardcore mmorpg (which I have, I’m a long term elder scrolls fan, basically my only single player games have been elder scrolls and assassin creed games) I came into Fallout when NV was realesed and have played all 3 Bethesda Fallout games and NV. Anyway as someone who played mmorpgs most of his gaming life I can tell you that their not meant to be easy to get the good stuff, it’s grinding, time consuming, boring, brain numbing sometimes downright depressing work. So much of playing a mmorpg is disappointment, but the reason the genre survives even though 99% of the time is disappointment after hard work, is because when that pay off does come, that disappointment just makes it that much sweeter and its a massive rush of adrenaline and dopamine, I’ve won national championships for soccer and Futsal, I would say that some of my experiences with  the pay off of the hard grind of mmorpg gear farming etc would compare to the feeling of winning those championships, it truly is like liquid gold, nothing better then setting a goal in a mmorpg, holding out a grinding hour after hour year after year for the payoff, it’s hard going but when you hit it you know it’s worth and it is a true sense of accomplishment
---
They put alot of wasted detail into the vault. The overseer's desk has a globe that you can spin, which is the only one I know of in-game.
---
👁👅👁
---
Diluted radx and rad does the trick.
---
Must make hard lemonade.....alot of it to sell......
---
Needs water. And I need caps to fund my Psycho addiction......
---
deffinelty. before the patch my food would nearly expire before I had to eat. now I'm eating nearly full cnd food.
---
You need options for a secondary build. I run melee main but issues like out front of West Tec come up.
---
For P dump those points into rifleman so you can use a non auto line a handmade or lever action when needed.
---
Comes here to agree that I hate whining people, proceeds to right massive novel of opinionated whining 😅😂😂
---
no. you still gotta protect the animal from normal mobs
---
I don’t vote you down first time I’ve read your post :/
---
I have had radworms so often I basically AM  a radworm
---
I dunno, I've met some eloquent toddlers! Well, I can agree that some folk should probably word their thoughts better,  people would be more likely to give their ideas consideration that way.
---
I do like that emoji combo, but I'm not sure on the utility of it just yet.
---
Love watching oxhorns videos
---
Because todd hates power armor and says that it shouldn't have any competitive edge.
---
Can't wait for the update that introduces a special hazmat suit you can wear armor under.
---
I'd go with the mutie build, with at the very least marsupial, scaly skin, speed demon, and twisted muscles.
---
I'd also recommend reducing makeshift warrior down to 3, and using 2 ranks of first aid, since you're running born survivor anyway. Also if you have a point you can float over to your Endurance, get Radicool, it's great for any melee build, and it stacks with Unyielding gear.
---
A while ago, while I was still leveling, I came by the Winterspring Railroad Station and on the other side of the tracks some high level guy had set up a camp, which was attacked by moleman. The Camp had turrets, but the moleman somehow got below it. 
---
I decided to help out that guy and opened fire from my Lever Action. Until I accidentally hit the players camp, which flagged me pvp and got killed by his turrets immediately.
---
Took me an hour to find someone willing to take the 5 Cap bounty from me.
---
Since that I did not shoot near a players base again. If they are not able to set up their defences, it´s their problem.
---
I like the perk card system, but THIS. It makes no sense that I have to have three different Action Girl cards, for example, for each rank for when I need to free up an extra point or two of agility.
---
That's evil lol (takes notes writes plan)
---
Military ammo bag needs a use......
---
Just travel to them (vending) most often than not you end up locked inside......
---
How is it to solo? I e seen it up a lot and no one there, and I've been afraid to go in alone.
---
Yeah. No.  
---
It doesn't matter that no one wants a battle royale mode in what is NOT a well designed pvp game.   
---
They made a survival game 2-3 years after the trend died out. Even then, they couldn't make a GOOD survival game. Now all I'm talking about are the survival elements of 76. They're not great, not balanced, and seemed to ignore what was learned by other games like Rust, ARK and Conan Exiles about how to make a good survival game. Fallout 76 has not survived this far on it's survival gameplay. It's survived because of the Fallout setting.   
---
So given that, given how it looks like they were planning to chase the loot box/live services trend and the microtransaction trends but got stopped when EA screwed it up so bad for everyone that most civilized countries are moving to kill loot boxes. Yeah, no. We're getting a battle royale mode.   
---
Battle royale is the last, sprint towards imitating other company's mistakes and mediocrity that Bethesda Austin (not the main studio), can make to keep this game afloat. They're probably hoping that by pushing pvp forward like that, they can entice people to buy more cosmetic skins from the Atom Store or whatever game boosting items are going to show up around the same time. Everyone want's to be fortnight right now, and that's a mistake.
---
Unless you can somehow OUT-Fortnight fortnight and bring in a massively well designed game that takes over the industry like how WoW took over and dominated the MMO world, making a battle royale game is a massive mistake. But that's the gaming industry for you.
---
I killed her solo (empty server) back when it was possible and that didn't count.
---
"Do not ruin this" any further*
---
Just travel to them (vending), more often than not you end up locked inside.....
---
Normal, has happen'd to me since the beginning of the game, kind of fun when you have most of the SB inside your CAMP, lol
---
I'm glad to see I'm not the only one. It's such an annoyance for me that I don't really feel like playing the game anymore. 1250 hours in and I think I'm ready to put the game down for good because if this.
---
&gt; Yet Another Massive Map Battle Royale.
---
If you listen to the audio tapes in the data mined content, there are ones saying "get out of the blast" &amp; "this area will be unsafe soon, move to safe area". Sounds BR-y to me.
---
Let's not jump to conclussions.
---
It's not going to be battle royale. Seriously, you people bitch about this but then you forget that survival mode is already a thing and is essentially a battle royale mode already. 
---
It would be redundant as fuck to add in another battle royale mode, which hasn't even confirmed since you people are just basing this on out of context audio files. Like...Holy shit this has to be one of the dumbest controversies about this game yet. Like...Fuck's sake, just chill the fuck out and wait for it to come out instead of taking what some clickbaity youtuber says as if it were gospel.
---
Exactly! This is why I’m upset.  I don’t want the developers thinking the game is horrible or not performing well just because people are whining about the mmorpg side of the game, because many of the players whining about it are the ones who have never played an mmorpg.  I can’t tell you how many people I’ve come across in-game that don’t understand their builds because they’ve never played an mmorpg.  I actually help people with their builds, so they can enjoy the game, but I wanted to give people some perspective because it seems only a small percentage of us have actually played mmorpg’s.
---
I've been selling a buttload of plans for 15 caps
---
Depends if they're going to try to cram a battle royale mode in the game instead of adding more single player and quest content.
---
i stopped using the cards altogether i feel it was a waste just remember to keep you shit fixed and if your in a bind there is always repair kits, much better cards to use 3 points on
---
The daily missions in the game have haunted me a long time.
---
Some days it pops some days it don't. Sometimes it pops if I go there sometime it does as soon as I log in across the map.
---
Some dailies have never come back for me others never miss.
---
I wish they all popped daily like the name suggests. Or let use use our personal fancy terminal to trigger then ones we want when we want and start a 24 hour cool down from when we last did it. That way I can track them and do the ones I want.
---
Truthfully I would be disappointed if they did add battle royale
---
No problem. I doubt they'll use it since it's something fan made, but I hope they do because the sweater sounds bomb.
---
I'm ok if it's a BR mode, like survival, that you select on the loading screen and go be on your merry way. I'm not ok if I lose to story/lore because I hate BR games.
---
Well the the hardest part is collecting the stuff to fill the troughs and the boss fight unless you have a good roll legendary but the alpha takes a bit to kill alone.
---
No idea why Bethesda has not implemented these changes. It's not rocket science. If you grant everyone a random legendary reward by successfully completing the quest it'll avoid these issues.
---
You really got a good deal for 400 caps. I could easily see either of those go for minimum 1250, but people would definitely pay more. I have an executioners one I would trade along with caps. Or other weapons or just straight up caps.
---
Farm the event Distant Thunder. You get a guaranteed PA mod plan. Still farming for calibrated shocks myself
---
That is something more than we have now, but another RNG it is not too good, I would choose what I want for 300 scrip and maybe 1 week cooldown fair enough for the choise.
---
Radiums are the hardest weapon to learn mods for which is most likely intended as they're one of the deadliest for PvP, especially towards bloodied builds. I ended up paying someone 1k to mod mine for me, the sheer amount of screws, springs etc required to continually craft+scrap massively outweighs 1000 caps imo.
---
I love situations that look hopeless and are doable, its "doing x and y in time to save z" shit I hate. But I need that diffuser plan
---
Wait really!? Where’s this located!? If there’s another place too get plans I’m flipping done collecting bucketloads of caps!
---
I would run the vamps. The 50 cal has a very high rate of fire so it keeps you healed very nicely. 
---
If you wanted both but with a nice little bounse I'd trade you my 2* VE 50cal+5k for your 3* VE 50cal. Or just give you 10k out the gate
---
Yeah I know what you mean.
---
Oh nice, no wonder I didn't know. I'm level 160 and I've done like 10 missions total lol
---
yeah, that's is the Assaultatron charging outlet, lol
---
This to me is part of the charm of any fallout game. Why I recall playing the pit dlc in fallout 3 and every time I got to the roof to get the last piece I fell to my doom through the graphics. Good times.
---
I’m too happy with this combo
---
And I’ve never met a toddler like that, so I hope those badass toddlers grow up to be amazing adults so they can teach the whiners in this thread a thing or two 😬
---
The thing in vending is that it’s very dependent on server and time.
---
You might have what others want, but they might be in another server.
---
Bethesda should implement a way to browse/search all vendors.
---
Then why the crap do I own this mat?
---
yes, 100%.
---
I know. I've got several to do and a few in the raider clan do as well so I'm trying to learn them. Several have donated or cheaply sold mats to help, but it's become a black hole trying to get that suppressor.
---
Purifiers are locked because I need the water, simple as that.
---
My door is always open however, but I'm pretty close to the Overseer's Camp - so there are many options available =P.
---
Damn I thought I was just sprinting more than usual. 
---
Was it in the patch notes of this yet another unintentional change?
---
Cranberry Bog. You can either use the “scope” to call in artillery to kill the scorched or just go and kill them yourself which is much faster.
---
Diffuser plans require all 3 animals to live. That isn't happening solo lol.
---
Oh my gosh thanks so much dude! Now I know where I’ll be wasting all my 76 hours. Thx again!
---
Cranberry bog is where it pops up. I can make calibrated shocks on t-51 if you want help.  What platform?
---
The spawn for the Alpha is random both in location and creature, and there are three kinds of alpha (that I’ve observed and heard of) which are Sheepsquatch, Fog Crawler, and Grafton Monster. The predator creatures do keep spawning during the Alpha wave.
---
I'm going to pretend that's not a thing.
---
I bought the "core assembly" for the t-60 thinking it was the plans to build the t-60.... well fuck...... It is human nature to do dumb shit
---
I know exactly what you mean about the targeting "bug." I've almost exclusively used vats for many hundreds of hours on multiple builds and while I know what you are talking about it's very difficult to pin it down and *reliably* reproduce it. When it happens you do zero damage no matter how many shots you take and no matter what the accuracy shows and yes you have to exit vats and reenter vats to do damage. I've actually developed a muscle memory for quickly exiting vats and reentering vats in combat when it happens.
---
I not only unlocked my purifiers, I have a sign by them saying 'FREE WATER'. 
---
My house is locked, because it's mine, and my utilities room is locked because my switchboard is in there. My workshop is open.
---
I want a battle royale, so I can see you all cry :3
---
Lmaoo yea have the same setup
---
Similar to how Diablo 3 handles it, my suggestion would be this: let us reroll *one* legendary effect. The other slots then become locked and cannot be further changed. Additionally, the cost to reroll this particular slot increases with each attempt.
---
Let's say we have a Super Sledge which is already pretty good, but it lacks the "Increased Swing Speed" effect... so we chose one of the effects which we care least about and reroll it. The game now displays a small icon next to it, in order to indicate that only this particular effect slot may be rerolled. If we're very lucky, then our first roll grants us the effect we want. If not, then we have to keep trying, at an increased cost. 
---
In my opinion, this system wouldn't make getting great legendary items easier - but it would give us the freedom to turn a good item into a great one... So it's up US to decide if  we want to spend scrips to keep rerolling one effect or if we want spend scrips to get an entirely new item.
---
Is the market considered oversaturated of only 2 or 3 of the 100 titles are playable?
---
Well yeah, there’s millions of people in the world? Billions? Should I have said billions.  The sarcasm suits just fine whether I use millions or billions.
---
Not me!  😂  Im excited to get inside and check it out. If the doors are locked I’ll run around the camp, and get on top of it to find a way in. Especially if they are really awesome looking camps. I’ve even broken in through windows while the owner is there...startled a few that way!!
---
I really like the terminal idea. It's pretty weird it only shows the new dailies. I think it's supposed to be all of them and function like that.
---
Remember when Wow, Diablo 3, and GTA Online all launched perfectly?
---
From the beginning, 76 is a multi-player game held to a single player standard.
---
PC
---
No one's making excuses for them. They're telling you to chill the fuck out and wait until we actually know what the fuck it is before you throw a temper tantrum, which is what you're doing with this post.
---
one other game that i played you could send a message to the whole server, but only once every 5mins and that made it work really nicely
---
Think so too. Just another bug on the pile 
---
I really enjoy dailies i hope they get more love. Currently doing them consistently is hard.
---
i'm drinking all the dam time like every 5 minutes, i moved corn soup to a hot bar on my mouse its sooo bad
---
Only if you are focusing on weapons.  3* armor is 60 scrip each
---
How blind and deaf is this sub even?
---
There a shitload of comments like yours that basically scream "FAKE NEWS" whenver youtube and youtuber are mentioned...
---
Criticizing something that you like is not the same as "making shit up", because you dont want to hear critique...
---
I don't think the game has a population to run a proper Battle Royale, but why do you care if they add a game mode in that you aren't interested in?? It will have no effect on the very small population servers that you currently play on.
---
You do realise the game is a representation of the world after nuclear conflagration, all the Universities with gender studies courses have kind of ended... and all the people are dead. If you insist on forcing BGS to introduce player intersectionality into the game it will be breaking Fallout lore in so many ways...
---
No just NO!! Some things should be left alone.
---
It feels that way after every patch, I am burning through food and water.  Before the patch I was selling 50/60 water a day, now I am selling maybe10.  The rest I have to drink.  
---
Don't know it is is just my presception or if they are tinkering though.
---
Damn.  I'm on ps4. I'm sure someone wouldn't mind helping you though! Sorry for the bad luck.  Most of us have done something like that haha
---
Lvl 190 solo player here there are some events I don't ever do unless some low lvl player is there I'll check to see if they need help. For me it's all about rewards, camp fire tails can give possum badges but is truly boring solo so if no one there I don't go. Census violence drops marine wetsuit upgrades so Ive been told so I snatched that quest up all the time. But all in all as a solo player it is great playing the low lvl events with other people.
---
A lot of people on this sub a really delusional... they start screaming "fake news" whenever youtube is mentioned... you can like something and still criticize it....
---
Sounds like you need to speak for yourself instead of acting like the whole community would hate it.
---
I ran into my first death house on the weekend.
---
Basically I FT'd to buddy's base, he sees me shopping, then suddenly a powered door slams shut and I'm burned alive via flamethrowers.
---
The one time I didn't dump my junk off I get roasted, figures eh?
---
Oh ik, I do the same the amount of people who I’ll ask, what weapon type are you working on and they respond with oh yea I’ve got a .50 cal, a 10mm pistol etc its ridiculous , you then ask, what about your build, oh yea I’ve got 15 luck and 15 endurance so I can go a long time without eating or drinking. And it’s just infuriating, don’t complain about how unfair the game is when you don’t fully understand it. I feel like setting up a business and making builds for people, either that or I make templates for people, like here is what a skeleton heavy gunner build should look like etc
---
Thats pretty cool I have a Vampire 50 Cal for the Scorchbeasts :p
---
Lmao I tried to store a mineral extractor where I had a shotgun turret on it.
---
Now the shotgun turret ist stored but not the mineral extractor. fml
---
It doesnt matter if its better, they still deserve shit for how they delivered the game. Sure its amazing that NOW its playable (even though it literally isnt since major bugs like floating melee doesnt work etc. still ruin the game for many), but that doesnt excuse how it started.
---
There is a difference with baseless hate and holding someone accountable. Not forgetting, is holding them accountable and not hating.
---
Next.
---
This is the case for almost any online game. There's probably annoying whiney children playing this game too, chief.
---
I want a handmade myself reminds me of a AK47 :P and Im jealous you have the Explosive Lever Action I have a Legendary Lever but not Explosive
---
Some drop legendary armour and some drop plans.
---
I recently built a WS camp because I wanted to make a giant chess board and needed an open, flat area. Nukes are a headache if you're doing something but you can "dodge" them by logging off and coming back after the nuke has landed.
---
You mean just like fortnight, majority of players i see dont want  a battle royale mode they just want the pvp in existing modes adjusted and improved
---
I'm so excited for nuclear winter
---
Switch out life giver for partyboy/-girl and rejuvenated for a glorious 6 extra strength and +45 thirst from whisky and +60HP and AP regen from rejuvenated. They synergize well.
---
add Hooded Dementor dude ill play sometime
---
You’ll be able to have all those caps back in a week if you pick up everything and sell it to the vendor bots and drain their daily 1400 cap pool, some outfits are worth more than others but pick up golf outfits, straight jackets space suits and ranger outfits if you see them, bulk junk to sell and off load excess chems to them, the perk pharma pharma will mean you can search medical containers for more to sell. Kill graffton monsters they drop 15-20 caps, I kill the one by Poseidon while I’m in the area doing the energy plants cap stash run, then head into Charleston where there’s 2 cap stashes on the fire breathers exam run, keep following the river past the Charleston building and another graffton will pop up, you can then clear enemies from Wade airport for 20 caps reward and they are super mutants so they drop caps on their bodies too, then you can go over the bridge to do the riverside cap stash run and kill the supermutants at Summerville for their caps, from there head to whitesprings there’s cap stashes and the ghouls drop caps, if your lucky you’ll find a few odd caps in the washing machines in the laundry building,  from there you can go to black water mine as there’s 2 cap stashes there. You can look up all the cap stash runs online and make your own route taking in a vendor along the way to offload things like assault rifles, combat rifles etc (around 30 caps each) and also any workshops, you don’t need to claim the workshops just clear the enemies from them for the 20 cap reward if your passing them on your route. Formula P, charisma bobble heads, sweet roll, and grape mentats and hard bargain will get you better vendor prices. Almost forgot grab the mothman eggs from mount pleasant and craft omelettes and loot glowing enemies for meat to make glowing meat steaks, these sell for a decent price at vendors and every little helps.
---
Hey! If he doesn't like it then no one's allowed to!
---
So you would much rather hold a grudge despite all that they’ve done to improve the game?
---
Is Bloodied any good I’ve seen alot of builds around that on the Facebook Group Im in?
---
I swear they tinker with disease infection rates and food/drink consumption every patch but so far no one has found anything.
---
Calm down. It was just a sarcastic comment. There are youtubers who use valid arguments, I was talking about the one with capslock in their title, who juste make money on the hate-wagon.
---
No.
---
Actually, Fortnite PvE is pretty fun, I play it with my son.. not sure why you think it's been ditched? Fortnite also has a creative mode with all sorts of fun mini-games where you can even build your own, as the game has matured the extra modes keep people in and entertained.
---
This means, that some poor souls can't participate in the alpha fight and don't get loot from the alpha because they have to defend the other friendly mobs in the other two biomes?
---
That makes little sense. The urge to fuck it all and abandon your biome to fight the alpha will be high i guess?
---
Not to mention also promotes the music from that era. I also hope it helps the living family members of those artists
---
Can’t beat the All Rise :p
---
Yeah I don’t,I know it stands for a scientific thing to do with radiation and such,But I woudn’t put it past them lol
---
I haven't duped, and I do well in PvP.
---
Well true maybe just tema deathmatch !! That'll be sick
---
I'm told that Rifle used to make a lot of clickbait for Destiny. I don't think it bled into his work on 76 but still.
---
Oh wow, I’ll save this comment for tomorrow morning thanks kind stranger!
---
Not seen a Flare Gun that’s Legendary :p I still found it funny there’s a rolling pin
---
It's quite frustrating. I think I've managed to get everything I want but that from the event but I think that really takes some organising.
---
&gt;YouTubers 
---
That's how you know it's idiotic bullshit.
---
No, this would be way too powerful.
---
by posting here it gives the other people to educate them on the mechanics of mmo games and limitations that come with that. i have made replies to such problematic requests, usually it ends up being an essay as i try to simplify a complex issue and im a software dev myself, so i get carried away sometimes.
---
it is more often than not a very positive discussion as i generally tend to provide an alternate solution to the problem, assuming that it is a problem. there was a case of selling goods when at max cap, where my argument was that the limits are there for economical balance, provided examples, and that its the responsibility of the seller to maintain their shop.
---
we agreed to disagree, but my comment also has the chance to be read by the devs, and that is also feedback. by them posting a stupid idea and having everyone bash is as good as posting a good idea and have everyone like it. 
---
by limiting freedom of speech we impede progress no matter how you cut it. by educating the player base we are increasing the amount of better feature requests and balance changes.
---
p.s.
---
for the 3\* example i think the issue is that the drop rate per star is not known by the player base, and that info should be released. that way you are managing the expectations of the player base when they kill the creature. instead of "damn it one star from a three star!!! beth, FIX NOW!" you get... "ah, damn, well it was only a xx% chance, ill get lucky on the next one".
---
I’ve never been a fan of Power Fists but I might check one out if I get one
---
This is the only game with a likable overseer
---
I’m selling hotdogs and captured frogs at a pretty massive premium.
---
Perfect... I just broke my mouse upvoting you.
---
That's the worst idea I've ever heard.
---
What a fucking boring way to live.
---
and guys, if they reveal battle royale at e3, be sure to BOO and insult them as loud as you can like at Diablo immortals conference
---
This is gonna sound Dumb but if the weapon being Ultracite can you use normal ammo as well? As I was going to upgrade my Railway Rifle but wasn’t sure if you could use both and I’ve got 800+ normal Spikes
---
The bottom tier could be to send the insult bot to follow them around the map
---
Can’t beat All Rise :p is there any mods for it as I got it from finishing the quest but I’ve not actually looked at upgrading it?
---
Dude he'll yeah it'll bring back life to fallout 76 cause honsetlt PvP is dead!!!!!!
---
OK that's actually really good. I vote it becomes cannon😂
---
I used the flat open areas around Whitespring to try out a semicircular build, I posted about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/azsgu5/my_latest_camp_with_circular_walls/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share I think the imgr album has a picture of it in a blast zone though I got lucky and loaded in after the nuke had dropped. Wasn't even bothered much by the glowing ghouls, actually. Good luck on your build! 👍🏻
---
I think there will be quest that tie in
---
I can melt the boss in about 20-30 seconds solo. Bloodied firleman using a BE laser rifle lol
---
You're doing your guys a service mate, the pain is real lol
---
i wasnt one either until I started using one, if you get your hands on a AA or forious would be even better.
---
You want automatic, explosive, bloodied fire lol
---
Yes.  This is horrible, this idea.
---
are you sure you didn't get anything? check your inventory for the event rewards. i got an arktos lab coat but since everything was so chaotic at the time I didn't even realize it.
---
I do not want PvP at all. All I want is a normal Fallout game, with the option to co-op with my friends. Put some real NPCs in the game and let me make a private server that I can use for myself and the 5 people I know that play the game.
---
Some cars could be scrapped without the mod. Other cars needed the mod in order to be scrapped. Same as some houses could be scrapped completely, and then other times I would be scrapping a house and end up with a floating, non-scrapable staircase.
---
I’ll keep a look out for one in vendors and hopefully get one from events or blast zones
---
yea that sounds good tbh. so trader or flamer couldnt spam
---
I lived at the snake for about a month an not once did the nuke hit my camp.
---
Stopped by a high level camp killed 3 gulpers bought 2 2* legendary weapons and got attacked by the owner of the camp wtf
---
That’s def my next move lol
---
by having the atomic shop loaded during the game world loading you are hogging resources that the game uses to load the game. both on consoles and average pc's. this would increase the load times for all players except the ones that have beast pc's who will have no time to browse the shop due to faster loading times they already have so do not require this feature.
---
I think spawn is random. Also at vendors. I might have one. Gotta check.  Gt:  Anna Hilfe.   send a quick msg and reminder about the mod if you like and I’ll check.
---
Ahem, "Rad ring of death".
---
Now that’s the kind of efficiency and damage I like lol
---
No. Xbox.
---
Well if you fast travel or server hop, you have to eat/drink alot. Spent 20 minutes just scrapping mats and crafting yesterday, before I was promoted to drink something. Yet after 5 minutes visiting vendors I was already at red.
---
Oh I think I seen your post on here recently, major props for doing something different man must've been sick for any players coming across it in the server.
---
Yeah I'm trying to weigh it up how tedious it'll be depending on how often I'll need to rebuild, but as with everything else server hopping seems to be the answer haha
---
The fact that I was able to sing that....
---
You would think they would get board hitting or shooting someone who isn't going to engage  but man some of them are persistent lol
---
I don’t lock my doors. But now that we have vending machines I like to sell purified water so I keep it locked so I can maximize the amount I get. Peeps actually buy and that allows me to PvP more frequently.
---
they should have a perk trader to trade our perk cards akin to the legendary vendor.
---
That card has a % to drop extra meat per level correct?
---
Does it also make the odds you get meat to drop at all better?  Because they aren't dropping any? I will try it.
---
I'm not sure I understand. When you initially load the game, before selecting to play, the Atomic Shop has already loaded. Allowing us to view it shouldn't cause any unnecessary resource usage or extra loading time, since the resource has technically already been loaded.
---
sometimes i get daily, in the middle of doing it i get disconected, when i log back in its gone...
---
Then make 3*-enemies more rarer to maintain the actual droprate, but make them drop secure 3* loot. Problem solved. The actual state is terrible, you always get exited when you discover a 3* enemy just to get garbage.
---
IIRC, a 3* enemy has a 50% to drop a 1*, a 25% chance for a 2* and a 25% chance to drop a 3*.
---
That is stupid. Make them drop a 3* item 100% of the time and reduce their spawn to a quarter. Fix this for 2* enemies too, and you have a consistent system, not this disappointing trash.
---
I want to be able to write my own personal logs on my personal terminal
---
People also rejected the idea of a multiplayer Fallout and look what they're playing now...
---
Thanks for sharing, loving the shape of it. Puts all the basic square camps to shame!
---
Do you recommend jumping into power armor before logging off at camp? I'd hate to instantly die from rads and have to spawn 5 minutes away and make the run back a lot.
---
Not really, also why are you still here?
---
That really grinds my gears. Especially for getting my mr fuzzy tokens
---
im not sure if it's glitched now but whenever i moved camps it tries to make one giant blueprint of everything, as long as everything is touching each other
---
like if you have a house but your generator is outside on the ground they are gonna be in separate blueprints because they aren't touching. 
---
that's how it's supposed to work
---
Don’t like what I have to say? Block me?
---
doesnt it have a diamond over it?
---
I don't suppose you're available today are you? I actually still need to do the revive in water one.. So annoying!!
---
I killed a lot of "Reach overseerver rank 186" in my whitespring run
---
Little tip incase you don't know, killing the scourched on the ground causes the queen to land and shooting her in the sky can cause her to stagger when trying to land and so won't. You might know this but I didn't until recently so getting the word out. So kill the scourched groups on the ground, then use the most damaging and armour penetrating weapon you can when she lands
---
The Colonel Gutsys, at least, have a kind of armor penetrating round that ignores a significant chunk of DR.
---
This is why a lot of players who run low health builds take perks like Serendipity, Dodgy, and Lone Wanderer, which offer flat damage reduction (if not outright avoiding damage altogether).  Suppressor also helps, provided you can land a hit on them.
---
Bump.
---
Folks forget that these guys make their money peddling fear and hate about a game, that they play.
---
I don't know why people think threads like this are going to change something that's been in development and scheduled to release soon. 
---
I'm sure Bethesda will see one of these threads, scrap all their development, and put out something else entirely different before release. /s
---
they can over-repair hazmats, which is the only reason I have ever used one
---
still, it's not good for pvp imo
---
I know so many people will hate me for this, but I wouldn’t actually mind a BR mode in 76.
---
Ruin what? Just keep playing the game type you already are? If you don’t like the new one I don’t like survival mode so I don’t play it simple. Not rant and moan on a entitled soapbox. Fallout 76 is not a normal fallout game it’s not fallout 5 stop trying to treat it like one and accept it for what it is.
---
for some reason the 
---
"retrieve your dropped loot"
---
side mission didn't pop, nor show up on my pipboy
---
All the images get shoved into the ram, after they have been streamed from the disk. By browsing the shop you are using the hard disk to get the images and then put them into the ram.
---
You can tell because when you scroll the images take a little bit of time to show up.
---
This all slows loading, especially on mechanical disks, and you are using up space on the ram that the game loading uses for decimpressing textures and other things after it gets them from the disk.
---
This is not an issue after the game is loaded because it a thing called the garbage collector cleans up all the unused memory allocations on the ram and the disk does not have to stream as much data.
---
I think that's ultimately what Bethesda wants to do with them - they just haven't ported them to the format the newer quests have.  I don't recall where I read this.
---
Speaking from experience, players used to the Battle Royale format will struggle with the actual game. Cultivating a build, salvaging materials, saving good armor and guns for later, are all foreign concepts with a steep learning curve. It's simply puts them at an unfair disadvantage which will inevitably piss them off. Hard games, that are not just kill kill kill are not the type of game, those who are not fallout fans would want to play.
---
I think a good example of this failing is Save the World mode on Fortnite. STW is a fun game which I enjoy. The controls are the same but you fight zombies and can still build structures. There are better guns you can upgrade based on your preference and guns also deteriorate. You can pick a hero set based on your play style with perks. If you learn how to make a gun high level, every time you make it, the stats stay the same. High level guns need rare materials to build, which are found in higher levels.
---
Kids who play this mode ask for guns constantly. They want to trade guns but there is no real system for trading so kids get scammed which is unfortunate but that is epics fault. They will literally drop into a mission with you, cry about guns and then leave you alone to do the mission yourself. It sucks. If Epic did a better job of explaining that you should want to *make* your own guns and how to do so- they would realize most eight year olds are not capable of this sort of thinking yet. These are not the sort of players I, as a Fallout fan, want in my game.
---
Recently they have "dumbed down" STW which had me have to reassign all of my points to all of my heroes which was a massive pain in the ass as they were all high level. I liked it the way it was and see no real benefit to pissing off high level players. I paid for early access to STW which was supposed to be free in 2018. That did not happen and I am glad. It's not ready for the little kids to play and I hope it never is. This is not the type of game I, as a fallout fan, want to play.
---
Also I don't know if they care about past game sales but the squeakers 'legally' can't play the older/future fallout games. Their business plan should be to increase their loyal customer base who has a higher disposable income. There are so many options for content from within the fallout universe.
---
Please Bethesda do not create a Battle Royale game in 76. Make one if you must but don't associate it with 76.
---
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
---
Why are there so many downvotes on this, if you disagree with this then there’s something wrong with you. I’m pretty sure everyone wants a good story and not some battle Royale
---
Killing things attacking people’s camps is the only reason I got wanted when shooting a camp once triggered it. Sucks that this guy didn’t have the thought to help out.
---
Actually just recently when I’ve died it will tell me to grab my dropped loot but for the first months I played fallout, it never did that when I dropped it. I thought it was just bugged for me because my bf would say he had a quest marker to grab his dropped loot. But for me, I never had it until recently.
---
The current location of the CAMP terminal only affects where you spawn, not visitors. Visitors spawn around where you placed the terminal down when first establishing the Camp.
---
Yes, another thing I’ve noticed is they don’t seem to be very good at targeting you if your in the air, can’t path correctly. I have dodgy, maybe I will try make room for serendipity too. Thanks.
---
I’d done that a dozen times.  But I’d only ever get the one chief.  The protect clause said (1/1) where I see others show (3/3) implying there should be 3 chiefs.  Not just 1.  
---
And the launch progress bar never progressed at all
---
&gt; 30 seconds and my water bar drops by about 25%.  
---
I'm absolutely not seeing rates like that.
---
I had a locked room containing my purifiers until a few days ago when I found players spawned there from FT so locked the purifiers instead and unlocked the doors, placing an "employees only" sign instead.  I also have an unlocked purifier outside as a gift.
---
If the CAMP hasn't the water purifiers locked I protect it, otherwise not. Open purifiers saved me so many times the first levels, i hate the locked ones.
---
so many fucking mistakes
---
True I never thought of the server thing...Duh :p but what if there was a place in Whitesprings like an auction house where it would bring up all the people’s items for sale in that server only? 
---
Saves traveling vendor to vendor maybe?
---
Thanks! I have made it my mission to never ever build just a square box lol, it's such a waste of potential though I suppose it serves the basic purpose of a camp.
---
Anyway, while I was at this camp I had only two nuke zones happen and for neither of them I was in my camp while loading in. I have had more times when I just happened to be in Whitespring from the last time playing when loading into a nuke zone, and not because I was at camp. Personally I think getting in and out of power armor every time is more hassle than running to escape a nuke zone or respawning every now and then. But your mileage may vary, it depends how often people nuke whitesprings.
---
Heavy user here. Love using these two as my main.  TSE Harpoon gun And TSE Gatling.  I play the AoE role in my group so explosive guns are tops.  
---
The Cap'n and Roxanne

Seriously, what an epic fucking waste of development time that woukd be.  Much like survival, I'll never even select the game mode.

Fix sharing xp in a group. Fix melee.  Provide more end game content, add faction reputations.  Put bar game physics in the game so we can play the pool table / dart board / basketball court at my camp.
---
Add more burrows like areas.
---
Oh, and try to make it less "weight management the game" by letting me figure out what's weighing me down more easily.
---
I played Fortnite 1 hour, Apex 1 week, Im done forever with lame ass BR.
---
People keep saying this over and over. But there have been posts proving that the drain is the  same
---
Good lord sell me that IE lever!!!! :)
---
It's happened to me a few times. That's why I've been just finding a different world if someone decided to steal my camp spot and rarely move my camp. It's a 50/50 chance.
---
4 and 5 stars may not be legendary perks as we know them now, but maybe mods. The cultist blade mod on a 3* machete gets it to 4*.
---
I played PvP for a bit in fo76 at level 50. I literally got killed left and right without realizing where it's coming from - 1 shot 2 shots. That was fun for a bit but honestly just silly.
---
If they incorporate more PvP game types hopefully it's leveled and fixed. Most probably play fo76 since since they like fallout though, so environmental story telling would be the better focus.
---
I kill them when I'm aware of them.
---
In fact, I got into trouble yesterday because I used my Tesla against a Scorched at this one CAMP and ended up zapping the Brahmin in the process.  I don't know if the owner would ever know it, but yes, I did go and gather some Razorgrain to fix your Brahmin Pen!
---
you can post the links..
---
The weight for the gun being 1 is well good take it that’s some perk cards in Strength?
---
Tag it and get back to protecting.
---
This results in no actual change. I feel Bethesda can spend their time on other things than something that doesn’t actually change anything.
---
Are there normally cap rewards that mitigate the cost of fast travel? That's always been my big deterrent if I'm across the map.
---
Don't worry, we believe you.
---
Nono you've correctly identified that it IS an Atompunk piece, but that's not the point I'm confused about: I'm having difficulty understanding how this piece in particular represents the pinnacle of the genre when it also presents (and seems to delight in playing with) other SciFi genres in themes and tones that are not standard in many Atompunk pieces, though you may not be using the word Pinacle in the same way as me (pin·na·cle - /ˈpinək(ə)l/ noun 1. the most successful point; the culmination)
---
Does anyone know of an up-to-date list of the events and the rewards they offer? I've been out of the loop for a month, so I'm kind of behind on what sorts of things I should be looking for.
---
Try messaging the person too, i had no idea people were getting stuck at my camp till someone messaged me, we fixed it right up.
---
I would like to see some sort of objective based pvp
---
yup Bear Arms is a must! %90 weight reduction.  I typically carry about 6 useable heavy's at all times.   Love my Two Shot Fatman Aunt Petunia
---
Yea, but the "twitch gaming" part of Bethesda games is pretty horrible.  Play Apex Legends, then play Fallout... it does not compare well controls wise.
---
I understand why they're doing it, I just really wish they would keep the pve momentum they have going.  Ah well.
---
I would be ok to see the Char name and faction (if it will be a thing some day) but i'm not into seeing more text than game itself.
---
That sounds pretty similar to what happened to me. What platform do you play on?
---
The pvp mechanics where shit from the beginning.  Pvp itself isnt the problem it's how it is implemented in the game.
---
Just server hop. It's not a big deal.
---
lol I swear bugs in this game go two ways. You get them or you don’t. I played a couple days after launch and ran into like three problems after playing for a month.
---
They lied to you about the bugs being fixed
---
Well you can keep on pondering that, you've obviously a lot of time on your hands.
---
Its because is a multiplayer game that was coded for single player that they just changed the code for
---
This results in 3* enemies that are always dropping 3* items, what are you talking about? This affects player satisfaction greatly. The change is altering some numbers (loottables and percentages of spawn rates).
---
I just wanna be able to jump into survival and not get killed by turrets
---
Not Fallout 76. Surely you don't think this game has even HALF of it's initial users?
---
Yeah I tend to swap weapons around until something works with immortal creatures I found energy weapons do the trick normally it’s mole rats for me
---
From what I’ve seen you get roughly one wave of predators alpha wave. Might just be me tho
---
Are you an expert in bird law ?
---
I would argue that the controls in bethesda games are not known for being smooth and responsive which is why I dont enjoy pvp at all in this game.
---
Also the only people who ever attacked me had 2 shot explosive shotguns so that probably tainted the experience :)
---
It's whatever really, plenty of YTbers will cover the lore so that I don't have to :P
---
I just want to not only get attacked by people with some god rolled gear. If they made legendary effects not work for pvp then it would be a little more balanced but even still it wouldn't be perfect seeing as how all the weapons are basically copied from fo4 which didn't have pvp. Players have much lower HP and DR then some of the pve enemies and it doesnt transfer well into a pvp environment.  Most fights are who can one shot who first and all rely on rng perks and armor instead of actually having to be skilled.
---
using things like one gun army (it can stagger so be careful), tormentor, enforcer (also can stagger) to cripple a wing will also get her to land. when at 50% health she will regenerate her hp and fix all her limbs, so it will have to be done again.
---
This has been tested. It's you
---
Agreed. Not only a space saver, but the screen is far easier to read. Add in the ability to play pip-boy games on it as well and that’d be great.
---
What if theirs three scorchbeast
---
Yeah, the "storm" should be a hoard of ghouls, not nukes.
---
Each patch always breaks more than it fixes, you're probably right tbh - and yes, I've noticed my hunger and thirst deplete a lot faster.
---
Amazing write up! Extremely well done :)
---
TBH I blame the system we have to put prices into the vending machine.  Fact we can't type the caps value but have to scroll? Is absolutely fucken ridiculous.  I just leave things in vendor at base price due to that.
---
More game modes are more variety. If that's what they add, bring it!
---
Where's a good place for plastic
---
Hmm, I guess ideally have two people running stagger builds, and the rest running bloodied melee for max damage, have the melees kill the scourched so she lands then have the two stagger builds target a wing of hers while tanking her hits while also having the bloodied melee builds carve up her arss
---
What sucks is that the text chat mod helped us do just that, but bgs really hates mods, even if they don't help you cheat; would be nice if they could support add-ons like eso.
---
Yeah just got a bloodied buzz blade. Tried it on one glowing ghoul and got murdered. How do they expect these weapons to work?
---
"Bethesda, stop being what you have become :("
---
Sad thing is, they can't take good decisions anymore.
---
I have a feeling that bethesda is doing this on purpose so they can introduce and item to the atom shop that will have an effect of like "No hunger for 2 hours" or something"
---
Could be those long awaited MREs everyone wants
---
If you’re fast traveling more your hunger/thirst will increase faster
---
Really? Theyre from the same developer and I have to say, as far as online go, this game could learn a lot from ESO, they made the transition first.
---
They will and it will always be *** lvl 5 nocturnal wood right arm.
---
One thing I'm trying to do is just wait til I have 1000 scrip and then use it all at once at the purveyor..it's like building savings in time bank account lol
---
My camp is in the exact same spot!
---
I don't know how many players it currently has. We don't have any player counts sadly.
---
Supermutants run bloodied builds , gutsys have ap rounds
---
No all explosive cryolaters don’t do nearly as much damage as the non explosive counter part. The non explosive cryolaters benefit from explosive expert without being explosive. I’ve personally reached 400+ damage with my non explosive bloodied cryolaters.
---
The loading of static images and prices would not cause an excessive amount of resource usage. Your comments are hypothetical, since no one but Bethesda would know how the inner workings are designed. We do not know what kind of texture format they are using. If anything, they are using compressed texture formats such as ETC/BC/DXT, which are meant to be read directly without needing to be unpacked.
---
The images loads instantly for me. I'd prefer not to talk on speculation. What we know is the Atomic Shop is already loaded from their backend (new items released, featured stuff changed, etc), and is available before we hit 'Play'. Having that available when loading the world would be ideal and would not cause some kind of crazy resource usage as purported here.
---
That's wierd keep messing with the perk cards it should not be like that at all
---
I PvP a lot and it aint always a one shot man sometimes were PvP for a good minute shooting I enjoy it
---
Funny you should post this, just the other day I was doing Campfire Tales and one of the people participating was saying how bad the voice acting is and that the whole thing was the same actor. I wanted to slap them and say have you never day around a campfire where someone tells stores stories and does all the voices of the characters. That was I got out of it anyway.
---
How about a more bulky nuclear reactor on it something just call it a prototype and bada bing bada boom noone cares anymore
---
It's totally Bethesda nerfing stuff to sell items on the atom shop! ^(/s)
---
...and yeah, I remember that post. Some guy compared food/water drains and they were the same. Imo, people are seeing their thirst/food drop more often because of either diseases or frequent fast travel.
---
That's good to know, it's my main fear with setting up there
---
The player vending amplified this feeling. Fast travel creates hunger and thirst, and with all the other camps that "need" to be visited the average fast travel distance per player increased greatly.
---
Bruh the economics link is a bit much..use the game for pricing to your advantage..who cares at what they price it at..I found some gems out there in the machines
---
Not all of us seem to want to help each other as you say. Many a time have I come across a ding dong or two that followed me for hours, 30 levels above me, with some unarmed weapon or other melee weapon punching their heart out. Shooting my CAMP. Simply being a nuisance. The battle royale would be for those people. The new guys. The “I’m bored and wanna shoot somebody” guys.
---
It always goes like this for me now. I vats crit them in the head with an AAE lever action and do like no damage they turn around and one hit me with a full auto handmade with one bullet.  No idea how but it is very frustrating. I even have sent/assassins gear.
---
I can see them adding this as an atom shop item down the way for sure.
---
Exactly, or it's mutations.
---
Bruh just buy 20k lol
---
I have my camp at that exact spot because there’s a nice patch of water there I can set my purifiers in. In my experience nukes haven’t been an issue. They almost always drop the nuke right over the resort and my camp is usually at the edge of it
---
I visited a camp this morning and it was being overrun by mutants so I capped the half dozen and picked up some free water for my troubles.
---
Oh, Thanks info. So ,Bloodied cryolaters is good work?
---
Some people just aren't into building, but I gotta say Box Camp&gt;Floaty Camp any day. 
---
WS does seem to get hit a lot less now as nukes in general aren't as common in my experience, and a good 75% of the time it's Prime. Cheers for the info I appreciate it.
---
yeah, I don't really understand why they didn't just add the new personal terminal model as an alternate model for the terminal we already have (the one that controls lights and switches), and combine their functionality.. but I guess that's why I'm not a game developer.
---
I disagree I think pvp without OP legendary weapons could be fun and if you’re looking for story content it seems like wastelanders might be more up your alley
---
None of us? 
---
“No TRUE redditor wants fo76 battle royale.”
---
https://youtu.be/xzpndHtdl9A
---
ps4?
---
Ah, the million cap question. Start at Morgantown High and ransack the place, lots of platic pumpkins, plates and golf balls in there. From there head towards Bolton Greens ( don't fast travel ). Halfway between is a farmhouse full of cat bowls. Then go onto Bolton Greens and clear out the pool table and pool area of life preservers. That'll give you a nice start but they ate well known spots so you might need to server hop. Also good are the Freak Show, top floor of Fort Defiance and inside and around Whitespring Golf Club. I think Top of the world has some by Rose too.
---
Alright so I'm not crazy. That's good
---
Same. You just need to know what youre looking at. I see a lot of good stuff people are selling that I personally feel is way to cheap for what it is. Then I see people who price things and think theyre out of their damn minds. Non-plans Inhave no problem puting down good prices. Plans are a different story. I have an ass-ton of plans but I dont really know what is super common and whats the more rare stuff. For instance, I have double digit quantities of all marine armor plans because I always find those to the point it pisses me off. But apparently other people dont because I always sold out of them. Things that I think are rare as I only picked up 1 or 2 of are super common.
---
Bloodied non explosive works for high damage output . The explosive cryolaters can’t get its damage past 200.
---
Ew oxhorn
---
I do not want a battle royale. So no,  not all of us want it.
---
Thx bruh
---
Thanks you very much !
---
But even as a multi-player game, it was terrible.
---
"16 TIMES THE DETAIL!!!" - "IT JUST WORKS!!!"
---
...if you keep playing I suggest hiring an in house therapist as old bugs get re-introduced quite a bit and new ones always seem to pop up .. so your patience will be testing constantly
---
Yeah but microtransaction
---
I not only kill the enemies but also repair the destroyed shit.
---
You are welcome.
---
We do ?, i didn't even know i wanted one :/
---
Obviously a troll.
---
[](/awelestia)[I ran a test on thirst just two weeks ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bny3zz/i_tested_to_see_if_thirst_is_now_faster/) It doesn't appear to have changed at all since the test.
---
I kill them. I repair camp pieces too by default, mobs or not. it's just a habit - treat others how you'd want to be treated right?
---
Bloody explosive lever action is my main gun. Also keep a bloody tesla for tagging enemies.
---
A bloody mole miner gauntlet for when I'm out of power armor and a bloody pole hook for when I'm in it.
---
For queen fights I pull out my bloody explosive gatling laser and an endangerol syringer. 
---
I'm working on adding junkies stuff. Figure my unyeilding armor will make up for the addictions.
---
youtubers are the wiki pages of the early 2000's, just making shit up, don't check it, it's true.
---
Well good news, it’s in your head. Food and water rates have not changed at all.
---
Oh, um, my main is Assasin's Super Sledge with 40 percent faster swing speed and I think plus one strength or something like that. My second is the Action Hero and after that, an AAE combat shotgun. And a boatload of orbital strike grenades and nuka mines
---
Hey to each thier own, I liked NV's story and Mad Max feel of the environment. And along with some of its crafting mechanics, mainly ammo crafting, I found I enjoyed it most. However I will mention I havn't played 1st 2 or tactics, jst never got around to it.
---
It hasn’t changed. Your play style has changed.
---
technically you can't do that anymore but I use vats to target with a non explosive gun for that reason.
---
[Bethesda wants to know your location]
---
thank you.
---
No we dont lol. We want new gun, new armor, and new camp items. Battle royal maps are pointless. I have an idea, maybe play PUBG or Fortnite and quit trying to screw this game up further.
---
People have tested it and found that the water and food depletion rate has increased by exactly 0%. No more, no less.
---
You're good. Yesterday I couldn't repair anything because I had all the materials save for a piece of molded plastic, so I had to scrounge around my area and then to plastic hotspots just to have enough to repair
---
BE handmade
---
BE leveler
---
BE combat shotgun
---
BE double barrel
---
BE pump action shotgun
---
BE minigun
---
BE ultracite laser rifle
---
TSE laser rifle
---
B/limb damage Bowie knife
---
B/limb damage Crossbow
---
I carry all of these with me at all times
---
I was surprised at how many are open, but sadly you can't live in most of them.
---
Yeah, they do need to up the challenge of the game. Harder mobs, more complex mechanisms.
---
[This was my camp at Whitespring Station a month ago](https://youtu.be/t8xWgjxnc0U). It’s still there, but have been decorating it a lot more since this video. It’s a great spot and usually out of the clubhouse nuke zone. Gets tons of foot traffic if you’re into vending.
---
Every fucking patch someone says this. I’m going to post the next one a few hours before the patch goes live just to see if I can get people to agree with it. 
---
They haven’t changed the food/thirst rates. People are just fast traveling or server hopping more.
---
We need a sassy finger wave emote, for when people try to PVP us or one shot a legendary
---
This one gets it, thank you
---
Do it.
---
With power user you get 1000 shots per core. I can get mine up to over 200 damage per hit. So you're talking over 200k damage per core.
---
I love my BE gatling laser.
---
Are you by any chance implying that I dont know whats good for you?
---
I envision this scenario where it is a new currency similar to scrip..
---
you put a legendary item in to re-roll all the stats on it randomly
---
-edit for clarification
---
the item would keep the same # of stars.. just the stats would re-roll
---
I'm going to keep them for a bit, use em for different strategies, then report back to you :)
---
Ya if anything u should have made own post, You put alo of words down that I feel like almost noone but me will see. Kinda cool idea, abit ambitious tho.
---
More than Fallout 4, from what I recall. I don't really remember boarded up buildings, actually. Not saying they aren't there, but nothing I recall.
---
Yes that is exactly what I'm implying
---
I had a sheep squash appear next to my camp and it literally scared the shit out of me. I spawn into the sounds of missile turrets and baaaahhhhhing
---
No worries man. My 2* works a treat for me. I'm sure you'll live the 3*, super fun gun
---
I want to see proof of this.
---
how dare you &gt;:(
---
That swag
---
Also try leaving the server, sitting in the atomic shop for 10-30 seconds, and then joining back into the game. It should put you in a different instance nearly every time at least for adventure mode.
---
Where do we stand on people building on the pond at the Whitespring? I don't necessarily feel like I should have to be the one to clear the glowing radtoads that call that place their home. An example, but some people do place their C.A.M.P too close to enemy spawns generating aggro.
---
I don't tell anyone if I think their prices are right or wrong. I (litrally) nuke the base if I think they are wrong(prices too high). I'm up to 18 confirmed base kills(I think they are caughting onto me).
---
It's a new selfmade challenge since Im bored in the game again
---
Honestly, I don't PVP so I don't care either way.
---
Sorry, no can do.
---
I'm fine if I can't live in them, just more immersive exploration is what I want instead of just staring at the outside of a house
---
I feel that too. My two best friends dropped 76 because the bugs were terrible for them. Three months later and the only bugs I ever see are glitchy buildings and the occasional enemy animation/immortal radroaches.
---
The logs make it sound more like an interesting Hunter/Hunted than a pure BR, tbh.
---
this is the ultracite laser rifle variant, not the prime capacitor.  if you upgrade to prime reciever/capacitor it uses ultracite ammo.
---
hahahahha we also didnt want fo76. good luck with this
---
I can make you a handmade at any level with any mod, just no legendary....
---
If you dont want to play the new game mode dont play it. Also they are adding in the vault raids with the update. So we will all be getting some pve content as well.
---
Got mine as a reward for the line in the sand event.
---
More will open with Time.
---
fasnact beret, the mask, and bomber jacket! :D
---
You lost me on that second to last paragraph.
---
“We’ve been getting good story content so far so we need more of the same rather than something for the other player base”
---
Each that’s what I’m hearing, I’ve done it 3-4times and still nothing yet, grinddddd lol
---
I think the leveling system needs a complete overhaul. The cards are fucking stupid. Some things need to be passive abilities. They way they have it now is very poorly thought out and pretty confusing to newcomers.
---
when you enter the game world and instantly go into the menu, the atomic shop is grayed out for a short amount of time. they unloaded it for a reason.
---
and its not just images, its the whole gui, call back events, async operations, extra network activity during server synchronization, added exception handling all over the place. god forbid a crash happens after you clicked the buy button. actively running anything other than maybe something prehistoric like pong in the same process instance during loading things as complicated as a game with high disk and ram activity should be avoided. 
---
while i am speculating on how its built, its generally a bad idea to implement this and is likely to cause more problems to solve something that is not an actual problem. and if its not solving a problem it should not be implemented. if one of my developers came to me with this idea my stance would be "nope".
---
I did the free range event in the mire, spawned two instead of one. In all my time since beta I haven’t seen something like that lol. Normally I could’ve handled them but my primary weapon broke and my backup was doing squat. I didn’t record it, but I don’t know why I would lie about it.
---
That's not true they fixed them. And then broke them again. And then fixed others and rebroke them. And then fixed the first bugs which brought the third bugs back, which caused the second bugs to be fixed which then created a fourth superbug. Which they fixed, which then duplicated the first bug again! It's simple.
---
I did so much damage to the level 3 legendary at the end of the event and all 3 times got nothing from it.
---
Im finding is a variable market for sure. Sometimes I go an hour or two not selling a thing, but lots of visits. And then I'll get a rush of purchases. I try to pay attention to what other "stores" prices are so I don't over price but not too underpriced.  I did see some some poor soul trying to sell the metal bed plans (you know, the one that sits at the overseer's camp, EVERY time you go there) for 100 caps. But whatever....
---
And I too enjoy seeing the variations of build styles.  And, I think it unconsciously makes me more willing purchase items if someone put a bit of effort in thier camp instead of plopping down a utilitarian box to get caps. To each his own.
---
Your imagination is the RP, not hard-coded faction choices.  Make your own faction.  Go role play.  Other people are doing it.
---
They already screwed everything else up .. why not, fuck it.
---
Fallout fans wanted more fallout but with friends; quests that mattered, outcomes that could change, rpg elements that they could use to make their game fun - fucked it up
---
MMO fans wanted something unique that offered more in depth, exciting and less tedious endgame content where you could make guilds, run around doing raids and dungeons with a guild party and generally enjoy a sandbox environment that you could build and defend similar to a guild vs guild.. fucked it up
---
PVPers wanted another quick access ... balanced ... arena style shooter/hybrid where upgrades/items/mutations could alter gameplay and make each login unique, fast paced and fun ... fucked it up
---
Survival type gamers wanted a survival type game ... fucked it up
---
And nobody wanted gameplay changing elements in the cash shop or shady marketting practices to trick/manipulate us into spending money ... fucked it up
---
I'm sure they'll get this right though .. cause reasons
---
You can imagine playing this game too without buying it
---
It's such a pointless part of the game. There's absolutely no reason at all to include hunger and thirst other than to be annoying.
---
It's like they want you to do other things...
---
Huh well maybe thay need to do it, but it's posseble that thay changed the food gain why you thin it's all changed. But do know bethesda tests fitures without telling us, i found like alot of tham. It's always for 1 day and meany times it's before an new update comes live
---
Just the yellowish one unless you mean the hunter's longcoat?
---
Again... holding someone accountable isnt holding a grudge, its not hiding the facts.
---
Its commendable what they do, but at the same time this should have been the release state of the game...
---
Praising someone for delivering a broken, mess of a car for the full asking price and then fixing the car over the following year after you bought it isnt an achievement... its the most basic action they could take...
---
ayy my man.
---
In all seriousness this post was a parody of the one currently at the top of the subreddit currently. The text i 'wrote' is just the front page one but reversed, somewhat to highlight how childish it sounds. This appears to have gone over the heads of the people above you though.
---
if it is a br tho would be interesting to see their take on it. May not have pvp at all and is just survival based on radiation and mobs but idk.
---
Great you tube video of person inviting other players to his camp that was set up like a maze.  Once inside his pet (deathclaw) chases others around.  Fun stuff
---
There is definitely some weight to what you get, had the same thing happen to me. TSE and quad explosive shotguns back to back. Same thing happened to two of my friends too.
---
None except from grind 3 token once per day.
---
Maybe you're in luck finding some at player vendors.
---
I've got 7 of em for sale.
---
Rainstorms or timezones work fine.
---
He’s literally asking for it to remain bugged lmao
---
I also bought 3 3-star armor pieces earlier and they were all scout arms with weapon weight reduction
---
So I saw something pretty clever the other day. Someone had built an angel of death style camp for a low level player. It was just a fusion generator and as many rocket turrets the budget will allow on a platform. The guy placed it just out front of westec and server hopped on survival mode. Seems like it would be a pretty straightforward way to level up fast.
---
Ps4?
---
If I wanted to play Farmville...
---
Can we stop seeing posts like this already? Jeezus it’s been confirmed that it’s not the case. Get off reddit and play the damn game.
---
Yeah, I've started going for two star as well, I struck out multiple times on 3 Stars so I use the purveyor much like slot machines, I stay out of the high limit area! But...I haven't gotten something this good.  I did get a bloodied guitar sword, I don't want it as im not a bloodied build but my brother thinks someone special will want it.  Any takers? :)
---
The story content come with items and stuff for the player base. If you think BR is for the player base then you may want to try r/fortnite instead
---
Yeah, I wish we knew exactly how the mechanic works. There are way too many people that happens to for it to be just random RNG
---
Where does Anne spawn?
---
Wow great post thanks for sharing
---
Why does everyone think bethesda should change the game mechanics to suit their play schedule?
---
Why are you even in this subreddit if you don't like fo76?
---
I kinda want to change it but I won't get it back. It just irritates me that the head has to be a different color.
---
Quercus does not need to be interacted with to obtain the objective to shut down ARIC-4.  You also cannot shut ARIC-4 down before you initialize the experiment as the terminal behind the keypad door will not provide the option.  Have one person initialize once another is in the basement and then shut down.  Quercus will announce your succes.  
---
Green thumb also does not work on the radkelp, sadly.
---
I saw one at a player vendor...get ready for it......for 25000 caps! Im still wondering if they meant to price that high?
---
Kill them?
---
It was nuked for the glowing ones but they were kind of nerfed..it's a decent place for flux tho
---
Mine goes on and off as far as the quest notification goes. In pvp it never shows, in adventure it's about half. I bet somewhere down the line the atomic shop will have Mothman Loot bag! Only 600 atoms!
---
He's the reason I bought every FO game since 3.
---
So until we know more, I guess the consensus is save scrap, if you get a good roll keep buying the same 2-star item until you run out, otherwise server hop or wait, can't hurt. Maybe it's possible to get actual data on this if you save enough scrap.
---
Same. I have like 30 of them. I used one that I got from an event for the novelty and never used it again.
---
Yeah but that one time it happened to me I was by myself without my good guns and he locked his camp
---
I check every time I post if they added them yet. Surprised they haven't.
---
...and, if that happens... we get new players that want a Battle Royale, and the entire game changes.
---
+karma
---
I saw a post the other day on that suggested that the type of drops and effects were weighted to the server itself. Makes sense because the same thing tends to happen when I'm farming legendaries, either all garbage or a couple similar  perk items
---
Pets. I used to get wanted accidentally killing people's pets before the Farmville update.
---
np man :)
---
How much longer are you gonna expect them to make this game something that it's not? It's a fucking online survival game with Pvp and it's mostly about looting junk and legendary items.
---
This happened to me yesterday. I got and anti armor explosive gatling gun and a bloodied explosive gatling gun back to back.
---
It’s not for you. It’s for the other people who play the game. I personally don’t need it either. But that doesn’t mean that there isn’t an interest.
---
Don’t be an idiot by speaking for people who don’t know you.
---
I put out a 2 star AAE handmade for 500 caps and no takers.  Yet I sell bulk junk like crazy for 40 caps a pop.   Go figure. 
---
The best thing I’ve seen so far was today in fact.  Some person selling purified water for 25 caps each and right outside his or her two purifiers were unlocked.  Maybe that’s some Jedi mind trick shit.
---
I thought about doing that too. I've been saving scrip on my second character until I get maxed out to do some testing on it
---
You can have instigating and explosive. Explosive is a secondary effect
---
I think they sorted that a couple of patches ago. Quite a few of the chared ghouls now have the golfer model.
---
It’s a survival game...
---
So, no ranking, just stacking? That would make more sense.
---
The Atomic Shop is not greyed out for me after loading into a world. I am able to open it up just fine.
---
"It's the whole GUI"
---
"While I am speculating"
---
Throwing out keywords doesn't really help make your point. I work for a fairly large software company, I know enough sysops to know your keywords have little meaning.
---
When loading into the world, my RAM usage is around 30% and cputime is low. You know when either of those spikes? Only when I am around numerous players for an event. Otherwise my memory utilization (commit and buffer) is low. My % CPU used is low. My disk I/O stays the same regardless (who games on mechanical disks still?).
---
A crash could happen at any time, speculating on things that _may_ happen doesn't mean much. 
---
The Atomic Shop is there to make Bethesda some extra money. There are already quite a few other games that do this, and they are much larger than Fallout 76.
---
Im coming
---
You only missed out on a 3 star level 100 enemy which will probably drop you a ghoul players rolling pin.
---
Sorry to say that but after some other posts here and there you've seem to have that opinion exclusivley.
---
At least speaking of ALL is a tiny, tiny, tiny bit too confident imho
---
I do have one just not legendary and only does 39 Damage lol
---
I think they should create a coop battle royale game where the server has to work together to stop another lifetime in the vaults again. I mean why would the best and the brightest want chaos?
---
 Perhaps another vault has sinister plans and wants more reason to stay in the vaults
---
Liberty Prime is online. All systems nominal. Weapons hot. Mission: the destruction of any and all Chinese communists.
---
Facepalm.
---
The BR mode won't be a mode, it's a location ( vault 51) that can be accessed in survival or adventure mode. It will be introduced as a quest , it will then have some unique rewards , some of these rewards will be needed to complete objectives in future nuclear winter dlc. The problem is not that they are adding another mode. Because they are not . It's a quest, to battle royal to see who becomes overseer of that vault. 
---
Those that don't want to do it will be gated out of ways to complete later content released . This is arm twisting players into pvp . A BR mode would be fine and not hurt anything. That's not what this is.
---
Like what? We're out of things to do besides legendary farming T_T
---
Nice! There is definitely something to how the drops are weighted. Wish I could get gatling guns to drop, I play heavy guns and all my great rolls have been shotguns
---
yes!!! and the atmospheres too.
---
maybe he was drunk
---
They have said they won't add any in either, I can't really find it right now, but it was one of the older posts. They said they won't add any in due to the fact the only humans they want in the game are other players.
---
It didn't default to Integrated for me. May be the case for older GPUs bu works fine on my 1060.
---
My wife was attacked by a mob of ghouls while using a cooking station, she didn’t exit the menu in time and died, when she respawned and went to get her loot it was inside the cinder blocks that you sit on when using the cooking station. Neither one of us could grab it.
---
Awful ignorant of both programming and business
---
i never said it wasn't fun,  it was abandoned 2 years ago though.
---
What's stopping you from making a faction, recruiting, and role playing?
---
Instigating lever action 10% bonus while aiming
---
Hunter’s power fist 40% power attack 50% limb damage
---
Ghoul slayer bat 40%swing speed 90% weight reduction.
---
TSE Railway Rifle plus 1 AGI
---
I used to watch Oxborn all the time. Did he survive that controversy?
---
You got the parasite my dude.  Jk jk
---
If you're on PC try reducing texture detail to medium first then lower others each load .. I highly recommend making your own Fallout76Custom.ini though as you'll have more control .. I load maybe 1-2 seconds slower than a buddy of mine and he's got an ssd harddrive so I did something right ..
---
Other than that try in the laucher to perform a repair
---
Bubbles, upstairs bar in Whitesprings
---
YOU AGAIN MATE! lol
---
Seems you can't wait to get to appalachia!
---
It's a little bit more open than Fo4 but all in all nearly the same i would say.
---
P.S. Already printed the map?
---
Don't be an idiot for thinking BR is a good thing for the player base
---
Sounds like a really fun event! I really want a Nuka cola ugly sweater now
---
I’ve purchased a few weapons to add to my rifle and shotgun collection, but the most I’ve paid is 1700 caps.  A nice modded 2 star hunting rifle. 
---
I have several TSEs and many other 2 and 3 star legendaries and would never think of selling them for 10K.  Then again, I’m always 23-25K in caps so nothing to bank.  I wish you could convert caps to atoms or allow us to bank extra caps.
---
Eh, I sell chems I make and purified water. Never had an issue of stuff not selling well, so I doubt most will care when a single person doesn't buy it. Plenty do.
---
I had that issue.  The latest patch on pc seemed to fix that.  What platform are you on?  If PC, i might be able to give you some tips for troubleshooting.
---
?? I play damn near daily on Xbone… and aside from those days I'm up at 5:00 AM, the world is almost always near-full.
---
I will look into the custom ini thanks for the quick response :)
---
Just so frustrating
---
Ok but how is this a real threat? He runs up and down spraying endless bullets at me and I ignore him? Thanks for the heads up lol
---
I have noticed when building at camp I need to put my perk cards in for slower hunger/thirst decay in or I have to eat and drink constantly. it seems to have increased but I don't have a way to verify or test.
---
...but the thing is, you are wrong. lol
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
Nice! One left hand and one right and you can fix your CAMP in no time just with a little ellbow grease.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
Just use the puke emote to show your disgust for what they did
---
Put FO76 in borderless windowed mode. I just capture the entire display. Much smoother (at least for me).
---
Lazy artists reusing assets. But seriously, if you think about it in lore.. It kinda sorta makes sense that they would reuse /recycle a junction box cover as a cover for the electronics on the sword.
---
PC and nothing installed or changed just so loading now and not been a bale to play the game been at it for 2 hours :( 
---
Not a good bank holiday :(
---
Absolutely. Nobody said our username would be our display name. I made mine mashup of my real name and email address. Submitted a ticket three months ago and last week they got back to me and pretty much said get over it.
---
Wanna know why I no longer do that? Last time I tried I accidentally shot a car inside CAMP area and it blew up damaging the CAMP and I got bounty...
---
There's nice, and then there's going out of your way to be nice. The owner may never know it, but you're a true hero.
---
In fact yes I have! 😂 Not a top quality picture but it fits nice on my wall. Just trying to make sure I haven't walked blindly into the world of 76 😂
---
Thank you (:
---
Can we also get some new menu images.
---
i cant seem to find you online, hope you'll die for me as well...
---
ign: Coldane

Need a laugh emote to show our true content for players trying provoke us.

Heres a paste of mine .. it's alil cheaty but not too too much :) also don't forget to change the iSize to match yours

A server-wide announcement would make a huge difference, or at least get you 3-4 in there instead of 1. That's why you get large groups at the SBQ and IPS specifically. If you had a group of 12 taking down the Queen surely half of them would've loved to do Arktos, so I think the real answer is they were unaware. I've played maybe 15-20 hours since Tuesday, have started it once myself and tried to join twice. So that's twice I've seen it on the map in 20 hours, and of those two times I crashed at elevator once and the other time my crew had to finish our workshop defense and it ended during those four minutes. 
---
I want to play Arktos so bad as do most people, but unlike Fasnacht it doesn't reliably start every hour fifteen minutes so that you catch it on the map and also get those notification reminders. Getting too many notifications might hurt the game, but it works for Fashnacht, SBQ, and IPS and would make the difference here. Or perhaps a regular event schedule with a countdown timer so we had more time to see the event and prepare. Or an event list in the corner of the map showing all running events when you open it, since you never see all events on the map. I love events, but hardly do them because I don't know they're there and they're five minutes from the end when I do.
---
I have to agree, I've not noticed much change. My alt though does seem to have slower spoilage of food, it's odd how large stock of food she can keep while my main can only keep the better stuff.
---
Both my alt and main have level 1 good with salt, and I don't have any backpack yet. I wonder if it's connected to fast travel too? I would imagine I fast travel more with my main, checking out plans and just hopping on whatever event that shows up.
---
The most plausible theory - at least for me - is that there is a function that takes an input and rolls out the items based on the input, where the input is most probably time passed since server started + character based modifiers of unknown nature + server side triggers  (i.e. nuke count), and when this input is in "godroll zone".
---
The right method seems to be gather 1000 scrip, go legendary farming and as soon as you encounter a situation where a prefix that interests you had over 60% in last five drops you go to vendor and empty your scrip account flat.
---
There is some material from Polarbear Igloo on YT that discussed this topic and gathered materials from other publishers.
---
You can buy it off of someone
---
I mean, I totally wasn’t trying to take a civil right away, I’m simply saying they should stop whining and asking for selfish things.  Whether or not it’s dumb.  I feel like this thread would be efficient in helping the game progress if it wasn’t littered with posts that are DEMANDING things be their way.  It is so disrespectful to the creators.  
---
But Of course they have that right to speak freely, and so do I.  So with that I’ll tell them to shut up and they can whine back.  The idea is that it’s out there, and it’s suppose to rev your engines because it gets you thinking.  I just went for a rampant approach cuz I’m a DIE HARD FAN.  And I will bring fire and ice to any topic I choose if it means protecting the things I love. 😈
---
No. The apocalypse is already too warm and fuzzy. I'm not adding to it. The scouts, seriously?
---
This event in this location is one of my secret hunting spots.
---
&gt;2 star AAE handmade for 500 caps
---
your nick in game? I want to buy !!!!
---
So does the "animal friend" perk work on the predators?
---
I don't have the stats handy but they're not impressive ... despite being \~level 135, I'm terrible at getting good gear, building SPECIAL for a fight, or taking perks for dishing out the pain. but I'll tell you what I can!  
---
I carry four weapons, one for the Noon, 3, 6, and 9 positions on the dial to make sure I don't get the wrong thing when I select a weapon.  
---
Noon is my melee weapon, an Armor-Piercing Fire Axe. Tis used to be an Instigating Fire Axe, which was better for thwapping ghouls, but Super Mutants require a crazy number of hits, so Instigating wasn't what I needed. (I run with a Strength of 5, not a melee character at \*all\*.)  
---
Three is my main option, an Executioner Hunter's Hunting Rifle, set for .50 cal ammo. I want an instigating Hunting Rifle badly but I haven't found one anywhere. This is my biggest damage weapon at around 110. Considering I see people with 400+ damage on the regular, I am WAY behind teh curve. I've had to drop over a hundred rounds into a level 80 Sheepsquath before, for example.   
---
Six is my backup for when I get swarmed, an Armor Piercing .44... the revolver gives me fast enough shots that I can toss out three or four VATS shots, build up for a critical, then switch to a headshot for a takedown.    
---
Nine is my "Flyswatter", a 10mm Armor Piercing pistol. The superfast fire mode, and good ammo capacity, lets me take down small, fast critters like Stingwings and other flying bugs, tag ticks, etc. With the AP boost, it can also do a number on radscorpions if I get desperate.  
---
I wish I was specc'd for combat to a degree, but I'm an explorer and crafter, so I've picked stuff to make better CAMPs, cooking up assorted goodies, and building arms and armor should anyone need 'em. I can mod about anything tho!
---
What video card arw you running?  
---
Step 1) Scan and repair the game through the bethesda launcher.  I ALWAYS DO THIS  after any patch is applied.
---
Step 2) undinstall graphics driver completely and the install latest drivers.  
---
Step 3) scan and repair again.   And test game.
---
You're just fast traveling more. Fast travel takes you the route an NPC would take, which is never a straight line, following roads etc. Then it calculates how long that would take and remove food and water accordingly
---
So whimpy kitty baby whiners don’t like the game, they can leave so the real players can fully enjoy this experience with all its flaws, breakthroughs and surprises
---
What in the world is this “at least on consoles” nonsense? I’m Xbox and still can’t figure out how that makes any sense
---
Ive had 4 scorchedbeasts at someones camp once. Just stood in front of a wall until it was destroyed and then entered the camp to a stash box. 
---
Sorry about your 1 wall, but I figured it was better than the entire camp
---
If you dont want to do the quest the only way of aquiring x-01 is to get it from another player
---
a sample size of 3 is not enough to determine anything.
---
i can add my 6 2\* attempts to yours... 5 - absolute garbage, 1 - instigating handmade with 50% limb damage.
---
my 3 3\* attempts, a shitty fat man and 2 broadsiders in a row... 
---
what you are experiencing is gamblers fallacy, the fact that you got 2 of the same legendary effects in a row seem significant, but getting the first 2 does not make it less likely to get the same 2 on the second roll. just like if you toss a coin and get heads, to get a second heads is not less likely, its still 50/50 or each toss. you could get 10 heads in a row but each time the chance is 50/50. 
---
you may also think its significant because its 2 good effects, if it was ghouls with 10% damage when aiming in a row, i think that you might not be so excited :)
---
sorry, dont mean to piss in your corn flakes, but just wanted to explain whats going on.
---
throwing my experience out there: at Lvl 84, i took the elevator down. 
---
came out the elevator to see a run-down science lab. i could hear a lot of activity, but didn't see anyone. 
---
left the elevator, saw a ghoul. took a weird number of hits to bring it down, damn that guy was sturdy. 
---
then i heard the loud, roaring sound of multiple pneumatic tubes releasing freshly-spawned robots. i turned around and went back to the elevator...
---
...or at least, i attempted to. i made a wrong turn, realized i wasn't sure where the elevator was. and i could still hear robots...
---
kept moving. entered a large room, went up some stairs, rounded a corner and came face to face with the glowing eye of an assaultron. 
---
so i respawn, quite decided that i needed to get out, but before i did i wanted to get my junk back from that metal bitch. this led to a Bennie-Hill-style kamikaze run through the facility, trailing a parade of ghouls. i ran up the stairs, snagged my bag, jumped down from the stairs, and started logging off with selfsame ghouls beating me around the head and shoulders. 
---
ten out of ten, game of the year.
---
Noted for next time
---
Are you on Xbox? I like you.  We’re friends meow.  😂 I have notes saved on my phone of builds, all kinds of builds! I’d love to share them with you!!
---
I was a little lucky and found 10 for 100c in a player vendor. Saved me three days of those challenges.
---
Ill definitely die for you!sent request!
---
Even just a radio signal alert, like Sons of Dane would be fine and less intrusive that an event alert.
---
I also wonder if ones cap amount dictates their purchases (as your budget does in IRL) If a player is at Max cap limit and they see a decent item they've been looking for, they may be more willing (than me) to spend 10k+ on something. Where im always at poverty cap level so I budget shop. Im looking for speed demon for one character and saw it for 600 caps (decent price) but that would have taken a bit of my caps.  This is why I love the new vending system, it mimics RL and shows humanity at it's best AND worst!
---
Also since I’m having no luck getting Distant Thunder to show up server hopping what you can do is go to Welch station vendor in ash heap and check his inventory for the mod itself. He stocks some t51 mods. You can server hop there and check his inventory while looking for the event.
---
People are playing a game with 25 hours of content for 800 hours. This is their trick to stretch content
---
If you have a BE cryo and are on PC, even if its inferior to B cryo, I'd buy it.
---
People are searching for the rare ones bc of a possum challenge calls for you to drink one of each
---
It is because they knew when they did the early spotlight with the youtubers at the greenbriar most people would be blown away by it and think the rest of the game would be that detailed.
---
Basically they knew more people would see that area before choosing to buy the game, so they went over the top to try to make the game look more impressive than it is.
---
I would prefer quality content over BR
---
I traded four for 5 caps each to a high-level last night. They seemed pretty pleased.
---
The repair kits themselves are whatever. The problem is that for one, these things ALWAYS get worse. It sets a precident. More importantly, they lied to us. They went back on their word, even after all the other shit they've put us through, and that's unacceptable.
---
Yeah it's 30% damage for three points, or 60% damage for nine points. I go the 3 point route every time.
---
Question...if you've already gotten the paint plans but would like to pick it up again, do you have to go through the motions to get all the notes and keys? AND if you do or don't, will the plans still be available once one has gotten them? Anyone know?  Guess im going to try it and see....
---
I know that but getting those on the same weapon is up to how it rolls in the game or what you trade for. My point is that there sometimes have to be compromises if somebody is determined on a particular build or different ways to play those builds. 
---
To me, expecting a suppressor to enable an explosive weapon to continue firing in stealth is a bit much owing to the explosive nature of the weapon. Doesn't mean you can't use an Instigating explosive weapon in stealth to deal a devastating first shot just you will attract attention and have to switch tactics. Instigating in stealth with a suppressor minus the explosive effect on a good weapon is still pretty great if you remain hidden and can still get the sneak bonus on the following shots. You just can't have it all unfortunately and compromises have to be made and if it were possible to suppress explosive weapons in the way the OP is asking, you can bet that it would annoy a lot of people, so it may be impossible for balancing purposes.
---
Dare you looking in my potty from 8.15 to 8.30 am!! 
---
😂😂😂😂
---
odd, i can see your friends request, nothing happens when i clikc on accept, and you're listed as offline
---
Why is this formatted like im not going to read it?
---
With Fasnacht people got to play it several times or more and learn it. Arktos is much less frequent and regular, my crew has learned how to play once we get in but it happens infrequently so between that and the crashes at elevator there's no guarantee we'll see it or get in. Fashnacht was so fun, this could be if we could simply load into it and we knew it was happening. I do think the added difficulty does make people panic a little too, but they'd get over it with repetition.
---
Okay Lennie...
---
Yeah, was thinking that. So bizarre hearing them all on their own, without any sort of anything.
---
Holy...yeah well... I wouldn't buy there lol
---
I mean theoretically the explosion wouldn’t give away the position of the shooter but rather the point of impact and the explosion sound may better muffle the firing sound to an extent. It’s all game balance so realism doesn’t really mean anything here anyway
---
DON'T shut down Aric4.  There's no value to it.  Any of your experiments will then bum rush the Alpha and get killed in one or two hits at most. Unless anyone can prove there's extra rewards for it, there's no reason to risk the experiments failing that much.
---
Also, CAMP owner's, have the decency to not lock your camp so I can get inside the place those scorched spawned to kill them before they wreck your stuff...
---
I had one yesterday where the person built a box with all their crafting benches in it, and a keypad electric door to get in. Some scorched spawned at the same time as me, mostly inside that room.
---
Couldn't do anything other than wait for them to knock down a wall so I could get in and kill them. Of course, they decided to break other stuff first.
---
The anger emote is pretty close.
---
Titan 1080 and will try that now ?
---
Simon
---
Just bringing this back up! I have been searching high and low. I went to these places and it was the mods for them. Is there a base plan for arms somewhere?
---
I heard you can actually visit the atomic shop in the game itself now
---
PC,  i hear all the trap base stories coming from console players though lol
---
I am most certainly online. Let me log off then back on.
---
You don't speak for everyone, my man. You speak for yourself
---
I've been trying to sell fusion cores at 5 caps a piece and 75+full ones at 15. I thought this was a good price are they that common I should be selling them for 1 cap? About all I sell is Yao Guai Ribs
---
I pretty much have everything I want except an IE hunting or lever, also a 3 star shovel would be amazing haha :) I’d maybe buy an explosive assault/combat but most I just dream of IE :) thanks for the reply! I didn’t expect you to let it go :)
---
do you get the badge for buying a captured frog?
---
I’ve seen it multiple times the last hour server hopping at Welch station looking for calibrated shocks lol
---
I would play a Fallout BR.
---
From a logic perspective, I think this is as good as we can get explaining it. 
---
How much you can carry is ultimately governed by the weight of the items, but in real life I can carry a lot more weight if it's all in a container than if I have to carry the items individually or tuck them away in some pockets. 
---
With power armor I'm picturing guns hanging all over the back by their straps, maybe a fat man tucked under an arm, and a bunch of chems/junk stored in various cavities on the armor. Dudes looking like he's try to carry all the groceries in one trip. With a backpack, it's just all tucked away nicely on your back.
---
I found plans for other stuff at Harper's Ferry, but it was never robot arms. I ended up just buying the plans from someone when I found them at their vendor box. 😕
---
Nuclear Winter is defined as: “a period of abnormal cold and darkness predicted to follow a nuclear war, caused by a layer of smoke and dust in the atmosphere blocking the sun's rays.”
---
Maybe it’s just that... low light conditions, dead trees and low amounts of vegetation, resources, food, water... 
---
Resources are plentiful now in game, now add in RNG to it all spawning and reduce it. 
---
We know it’s coming... save the dog food and other non expiration foods!
---
Yea it’s a big problem. As soon as I begin to spawn in camps I start running, hoping to escape before the foundation spawns.
---
Then don't read it. But it's not like it's any harder to read than usual.
---
Just found it. I can buy it and sell it to you if you want it now
---
yes this is a thing, i have been teleporting as close as i can then walking
---
found you..but could you change server..it says my camp cant be placed..and i cannot rebuild my entire camp ;)
---
Nuka Grape is safe for mutations?
---
oh really?  then i picked a good spot lol
---
Quest is easy... you get plans after the quest also from the computer terminal.
---
Sadly I’ve yet to see one in game but hopefully it becomes more popular:)
---
Such a great description, totally Benny Hill.
---
Got 3 explo weapons yesterday from Purveyor, 3 stars...
---
Any luck?
---
because bethesda..
---
I have an extra suit all moded out id sell, has jetpack and calibrated etc.
---
I only ever run PA in nuke zones, and I'm a VATS build. I need to remember this. I drain cores so hast.
---
Yeah the cap rewards easily cover the cost to fast travel
---
Lol great image.
---
Lazy? Or smart to reuse something that probably took a few hours to model that is really only in the game in very few spots?
---
I have a lot of missile turrets at my base because every time somebody spawns nearby I Got 5 or 6 super mutants. so i regularly come home to lotsof meat piles full of goodies. when the turrets start firing i get scared my shoppers will run off to fight the badies. Please keep shopping! My missles will keep you safe.
---
Yeah, the holotape that the overseer leaves after a non-SQB nuke is launched is really good too. 
---
Then it had me thinking, she is still alive out there somewhere.
---
Whitespring is a hotspot for enemy spawns, it probably wasn't your doing that spawned them in but it's nice to still clear them out. (once had a pack of 3 stingwings in a WS camp that nearly killed me)
---
hmm,  i mean im selling the nuka paint jobs for 2k each,  ive seen them priced at 4k each.   granted it took me a literal day to farm out that quest to get the keys in the first place i thought 2k was a decent price
---
indeed you do, and its why i didnt down vote your post, even if you asked me to. in fact i rarely do.
---
i get where you are coming from, i too roll my eyes when i see a bunch of stupid stuff. just now i was talking to a guy that wants the atom shop to be available during loading... as a software dev... its a fucking bad idea and just asking for trouble... in the end there was no helping him. i think he took it personally.
---
but a game cant only survive on the hardcore players. not anymore anyway. this is why wow got more and more casual friendly, and why wildstar will (or already did) shut down their servers. wow classic will be an interesting experiment.
---
its a balancing act, and discussions is how we provide bethesda with balanced feedback.
---
i have seen ppl sell them for 200 caps, someone i seen trying for 2500 good luck with that one
---
Did I fast travel to being stuck inside your foundation or am I behind a locked door? If so, I’m kiting a mob over to fuck your place up. And if your vending machine is full of ivory grips for 1000 caps, I’m dropping a nuke on you.
---
Changed my name last week and everything has been perfectly fine. I didn’t lose anything on any of my characters at all!
---
Add me if you’d like to grind sometime
---
PSN: CaptainModrah
---
got any exo calibrated shocks mods?
---
Another thread teaching ppl how to play instead of pointing to Bethesda for a fix. If your camp visitors would want to do that, they would have done that. This is basically a workaround suggestion for an issue Bethesda needs to fix.
---
I travel to vendors without PA for faster runs, meaning I'm defenceless most of the time, so I won't bother killing something, because I need to pull out and enter my PA, switch my perk loadout.
---
It's your camp, so you have to defend it and your wares, I mean you should have turrets, I don't have any such issues at my camp.
---
I always kill and repair what I can as well. 
---
My camp is currently In shambles because someone spawned at my camp and I assume spawned a scorchbeast (it’s usually her or moth man than come kick my camps ass lol) and I’m missing 80% of my camp 
---
I just cleared my stash box so now I am going to have to spend a few hours just gathering supplies to fix her back up
---
I dont doubt what your saying but i do doubt what bethesda has said and what their actions are, theyre gonna take the route that makes them the most money, and since over 2 3rds of the playerbase has expressed wanting human NPCs theyll probably add them regardless, just like how they said cosmetic only in the atom shop, then decided they could make more mkney selling repair kits in there too
---
Nuclear Winter is defined as “a period of abnormal cold and darkness predicted to follow a nuclear war, caused by a layer of smoke and dust in the atmosphere blocking the sun's rays.”
---
I think it’s going to be exactly this... low resources
---
If your doors are locked, and you don't have a stash box or benches for me to use, I'm likely to lure enemies to your base to have them fuck up your stuff.
---
This doesn't work in my camp. Most people do this, even I do this. But the concrete flooring, if you wait for it to load, will push you up directly into the vendor room. But most people get stuck when they fast travel so they take off running before it loads and get stuck in my base somewhere 😂
---
I've been contemplating a full rework of the camp but also don't want to lust every item on the vendor again. 🤷
---
I like this idea a lot - there's already the calibrated shocks mods though that increase carry weight. I don't know much about them, though... like which armors they are available on and what you ultimately have to sacrifice to get them. 
---
A storage chest mod would have made a lot more sense though! I like the idea.
---
How much are you selling for
---
It is on mobile
---
I think the badge is just for the workshop build. I don’t think that there are stages to it. I charge 50 caps for a frog. It’s a markup, true, but discriminating buyers know the quality of my frogs and dogs.
---
Think you’ll be on at all today?
---
Just put your camp somewhere that isn’t a spawn point?
---
If they got rid of eating and drinking, I'd come back to this game.
---
Makes me happy where I have my camp. I don’t think there is any legimatr spawns up there. I have only seen one scorched in the months I had it there. I think the only legimate spawn is inside the mountain then they fall to their death. I don’t think scorched beasts can fly that high either kinda want to lure one of there to see.
---
I'd rather they fix the bugs instead of adding in new buggy content. Hell, look at arktos, half the playerbase crash on entering it.
---
Well id take offers from ya but its got a lot of mods and nuka quantum paint. I need unyielding pieces with sneak and sentinal assassins pieces otherwise take a cap offer
---
What did they call a whopper?
---
But what about fresh air?
---
Better add automatic closing doors, like in Whitespring, because you have to read and comply in this case, so your already asking too much from a player.
---
Cool, I'll have to check out those videos. Thanks!
---
sometimes you have to go on the pipboy and select it in misc
---
but when you die multiple times i think its glitched
---
either it marks all the locations but only the last one has a bag with only the last dropped loot
---
or it only marks the last one but the others are still where you died the other times but you can't find it
---
Haha, spare me the lecture I'm well aware of what gambler's fallacy is. Of course we shouldn't draw conclusions on this alone but I thought it was noteworthy. I've gotten many shitty rolls myself, I just feel like the chance of getting the same weapon type, the same two mods both right after one another is astronomically low. If we can get some data on how it works that would be great.  
---
I mean this in itself is data:  "my 3 3\* attempts, a shitty fat man and 2 broadsiders in a row... "  
---
That's 3 consecutive heavy weapons in a pool of a lot of ranged weapons.
---
No, PC unfortunately
---
More than 2/3rds have also asked for text chat instead of just voice chat. They still haven't added that and aren't planning to.
---
I'm both on mobile and desktop. I can read just fine.
---
It happens semi regularly, leaving the game completely and logging back in the missing quest normally reappears. You can also lose in process dailies this way, but logging out and back should fix it. The first time or two it happened I tried all sorts of in game things to restart it initialize it but all in vain. The only way to get it back is to get out and try again.
---
People have been saying this for months about legendary spawn rates. It’s just a rng. People get great, medium and shitty rolls. One god roll is enough to make you forget the 20 got from thebpurveyor that you just turned back into scrip.
---
I've bought 4 serums for 350 caps so that price is the price
---
in pvp it shows on the map for everyone to see, right?
---
I can help you ps4 goodfella311
---
Yes but the third mod is usually not worth the extra scrap since the explosive mod is a secondary modifier and most of the good modifiers are primary modifiers. The best 3rd modifier ytou can get for ranged weapons is reduced weapon weight which is not really worth the extra scrap imo.
---
I mean it has a scroll bar that you have to scroll all the way to the right and then back over for the start of a new sentence. It's a lot more hassle to read, especially if you want to read it multiple times or go back and reference something; 50% of the text is hidden at all times. 
---
He's not wrong.
---
Theres an icon on the topdown map, but nothing you see in-game. Tall grass or weird topography hides bags forever.
---
I fought one like that once. It kinda looked cool because he was behind a car, so it kinda look like it was reaching over to shoot over the car, although grabbing a gun with TWO long held arms is a pretty weird way to aim.
---
Of course not completely perfect, as the car is so short to crouched player &amp; supermutant.
---
I’ve been hoping that would happen to me but haven’t found anyone with the plans either. It’s the last thing I have to do for that silly badge!
---
I can do ghouls 24/7 but I loathe robots. So you haven't thrilled me with your tale.
---
Same, wether or not I kill them is 100% based on my experience at the camp. If I spawn inside the house, and there’s no way out? Fuck em. If I spawn in a wall and have to re-travel? Fuck em. Is the house locked up tight without even a stash box outside? Fuck em. 
---
If ur house is set up to make you a part of the community, then you are, if it’s set up to keep me out, then I’ll leave you to the beasties.
---
Isn't he, though?
---
Nah I can eat people so I'm good.
---
Sell them to me so I can make more nuka grenades. When I go to players camps this is what I'm looking for. Nuka cola , and rare armor mods , like dense chest mods. Robot dense chest mod has been the one I'm hunting for.
---
not a solution, you will get intentionally trapped then by other players
---
I wish I could fix coding with a drill! Apparently a closed in stairway is impossible.
---
everyone needs food i suppose,  not everyone uses PA.  im starting to see them less on nuke runs.  which is odd.
---
I purposefully fast travel to bases with the intent of destroying them by kiting enemies. You people asked for it. Try and stop me.
---
OH WAIT, YOU CAN'T. I have peaceful mode on. Enjoy being victims of your own stupid demands.
---
I see a lotta worries about trade spam and toxicity randos and such. Fair worries to have! But I just wanted to add that this isn't like the big mmos with hundreds connected at a time in an area or map at once, which contributes to all that spam and increases toxic run ins and encouraged behaviors and such nature. Our servers max at 24 ppl connected, so I feel like server wide communication is important. Much more important now with upper level harder events like the new labs and the coming raids or dungeon vaults that can need a lot of ppl and coordination.
---
I've never had this specific issue, but I get plenty of placement/floating/nothing selected messages. Those are all cleared by exiting build mode and getting back in, but if placing rotates and nothing snaps and it's been like this from the beginning for you it may be your install.
---
sorry, wasnt my intention to be condescending or to patronize you.
---
more often than not people do not understand statistics properly, so its my default position.
---
i would also like to see data with a high sample size regarding this.
---
yeah..im only getting the respqwn option..no ask for help....weird
---
I wouldn't mind those odds. Over the week I've killed 27 SB not 1 dropped meat.
---
they really should fix binoculars to work like the camera
---
I don’t think they are ever going to change the perk system. Maybe if I say that they’ll change it...so you didn’t hear that last part
---
I buy from train stations for 20 each when they actually have them , I'll gladly pay 20 each from any player that has them.
---
Dear lord, chill the fuck out people.
---
I did that right off a cliff...lol make sure you have PA on...lol
---
I think their both useful in certain situations. On fast shooting lower damage weapons AA would be better than instigating. Ideally however once a strong target reaches a certain health threshold switch to an executioners weapon.
---
What, better than Oblivion?
---
There are literally spawn points everywhere.
---
Well I have about 3000 caps so if you want to trade let me know
---
If you could duel wield drills, I would totally build a character around it.
---
This^
---
Ur character literally shakes their head.
---
just move the machines to the side someplace so you dont have to store or scrap them then re-place them where you want
---
Damn food builds!!!!
---
Go melee, I only use guns on the queen anymore. Sadly.
---
It's almost like this fallout game is missing key elements of fallout
---
I agree completely. I'm here to work to rebuild with my fellow players, not to RP a psychopath.
---
What's your level range?
---
Ok, yea it would have to be more sorry
---
Fingers are crossed for you mate - hope you enjoy the step out of our Vault!
---
Don't forget the spend a little time at your Terminal before you leave.
---
Grafton Steel.  Kill all the mutants (They top out at level 22 I believe).    I'm level 230 and I still occasionally make a sweep.
---
It's not "teaching how to play" so much as being kind. If I don't have enough space for 10 turrets on all perimeters because I want my camp to look nice, why sacrifice it? Bethesda fixing this wouldn't stop things like mob kiting, and if you're not having this issue, good for you, gold star, but it's not the same for everyone.
---
I would assume if you have rank 2 of starched genes then yes you should be safe
---
I would need that, i constantly spawn in a nearby river when I fast travel to my CAMP.
---
Idk why people keep asking for this.  It’s never happening. 
---
If they let us put our own text in game, they would have to dedicate resources to censoring it, that’s a big job and they don’t want to do it. No amount of enjoyment from the player base is worth someone having to do an event with “Ni**erSlayer”. Even if they have the ability to report them.
---
sorry im on xbox
---
not a bad deal anyways
---
Congrats you want a perfectly preserved pie
---
Booo
---
This ^ , why I have Reddit account. I don't do new stuff until I know how it's affected others .
---
Yeah that was the alternative. I have my base in tiers, so Idk if it's be simpler to rearrange everything or just start from scratch and redo the vendors. 
---
Hey is there a way to select portions and store entire segments? I know we can select portions and create blue prints but what about the store entire selected sections. 🤔
---
You will probably get one to drop from scorchbeasts than you will get the plan. Helps most stuff in bog will be near them.
---
It would be cool if it played similar to fallout 4 frost. Tougher enemies, scarcer supplies, actual environmental hazards (instead of like 3 locations in the game where you take very minor damage without a gas mask), and harsher rads, although f76 actually does a decent job of making radiation a challenge
---
One me and my friend saw a level 80 sheepsquatch at someone’s base and we tried to kill it but we couldn’t so we messaged the person saying “there’s a sheepsquatch at your base could you give us a hand” and he goes “I believe not “ and completely ignores us
---
I can make you one with no mods for 1700
---
Huh - deleted both post and account?! Now i'm curious lol
---
True, the 3rd one was not good
---
No, no, it's at least twice that.
---
I can put nuka quantum on it and a bright HL
---
What else infuriates me about this, is the range the mobs that spawn have. I'll travel back to my camp and see it's destroyed. In the distance... gun shots ring out, and from behind a shed near by, SHOOTING THROUGH THE WALL.... is one level 5 scorched and his hunting rifle, untouched from my defences, having the time of his life.
---
true. I didnt even think about the increase in fast traveling now. although when player vending first came out, it didnt seem as though my hunger n thirst was dropping more rapidly. but after  9.5 I noticed.
---
My bases are always a long ways off from anything interesting so if something spawns it's always because a player spawned there. Super annoying but I've got the turrets to hit anything that moves inside my perimeter or out of it.
---

---
I wouldn't particularly mind a battle royale mode in Appalachia, it's a cool map for it. I don't play Fortnite anymore and only ever played PUBG and Apex Legends once each and didn't care for either so to have it in 76, wouldn't be so bad if you ask me.
---
I saw this more obscure video I loved called “Game developers controversy” by this dude “COSMO JENKINS” that was amazing and defends fallout 76 and critiqued and dissects toxic gamer culture brilliantly. 👌
---
Idk where your house is so maybe it’d be different for you. But I have 4 large purifiers, and I locked 1 of them, to make sure that I can’t be left hanging water wise.  And so far I’ve NEVER come home to find that it’s all just gone. Generally I can’t even tell if other people are taking it. 
---
If everyones were unlocked, it would be a net gain in waters for everyone who visits camps
---
Oh, I hope so. I'd play it non-stop.
---
If no high levels are there try the golf course.  The ghouls are usually around your level.
---
You change your display name in the Bethesda launcher.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
It really isn't jumping to conclusions when you listen to the new voice lines they added in. Literally talks about battle royal things like a closing in ring forcing people to the center of a map. Just like PubG and fortnite.
---
I've got all my challenges with the 105 lens on, so..........
---
Would now be convenient? :-)
---
Seriously, Bethesda is chasing one fading fad after another. First it was, "Fallout's a Live Service!" Then it was, "Fallout has a hardcore PvP survival Mode!" And now it's apparently gana be "Fallout has a BR!"
---
When will Bethesda learn that they will ALWAYS perform subpar when they not only make games outside of their wheelhouse (single player story driven RPGs) but also when they chase fads that are either over or already have HUGE names in the game?
---
Agreed, no one is agreeing or disagreeing. I'm just saying that we need far more rolls and data to make a certain conclusion is there is a weighted mechanic or not. Without a much larger sample size and recorded data there is no way to be sure. Just talking about the possibilities, and it is suspicious that people keep getting not only similar effects but also similar items as well
---
I think CFT is way easier to carry honestly.  I just stand next to the fire while other people faff about. Still easy to get lots of kills and At least tag the boss, while keeping the fire stoked
---
I can* tell you if you are missing a limb or not
---
*propably
---
I have not had issues with the 105 lens but I have had issues with a paint job seemingly affecting my ability to register a picture
---
Interedting, good points. I always thought Executioners would pair well with explosive as the AOE would get most in a group below the 50% threshold after the initial shot.
---
That's the way to go, nice :)
---
Welp, cannot wait to have another mode I never even want to try.
---
Turrets. 
---
When I'm at a camps vending machine and i hear turrets go off i exit out of the menu and engage. 
---
But when in a busy area where fights always happen close by i assume its just players fighting mobs.
---
When your low level melee is the only thing that even scratches stuff. Once you hit lv 50 you can get some really good guns but unless your wanna power leveling melee is the best to play with at low levels and you’ll lv pretty fast bc you’ll actually be killing things and Rifle builds arnt really viable until lv 50 bc you need a ton of perks to even get close to melee dmg but I f you want to be a rifle build do it with crits and stealth
---
Just fyi, when you get the can't be placed message, you can just stay on the world. Then when you server hop after that, it will be placed normally. It doesn't kill your camp if you stay.
---
I keep seeing these posts in here, but when I google for details about Nuclear Winter, I don't see any hint of it being Battle Royale. There are almost no details about it, it seems. Where are people getting the impression that it's going to be BR? Are they just assuming and getting all worked up over it?
---
Well noted, I'll be sure to make a camp that caters to all of your needs your majesty.
---
I was very much under the impression that Assaultron heads could only go up to two stars.  Maybe I'm wrong.
---
I routinely sell magazines at 40. Maybe it's your location.
---
You guys need to try harder. My collection of 3 star walking canes and tire irons says otherwise ... :(
---
That’s exactly what I’m thinking it’s gonna be!
---
This isn't me hating on 76 or BGS but if they didn't want to chase trends, they wouldn't of made a live service game.
---
Didnt know you spoke for me......
---
DIY Warrior build
---
sorry it didnt work, really weird, i died 10 times, and you couldnt revive me...you die once..and i have no problem..so weird
---
It's all good mate, apologize if I came off as snide as well. People drawing conclusions on nothing but rumors is a pretty big problem in this subreddit so I understand why you wrote the comment.
---
Same here, got both no lens and 105 lens challenges to work with it equiped.
---
The big top.
---
That one wasn't me. I liked it though. Was better than my CAMP. Just similar ideas ;)
---
It's possible that he arrived after the damage was already done. No reason to assume it was him that let the damage happen.
---
When are you planning on doing this?
---
Burning is fairly pointless, so don't count on that. Plasma is generally a stronger weapon mid range, gatling has better accuracy to to headshots.
---
I am not sure there is a burning prime receiver, but prime offers more base damage which is what you really want.
---
It's not that BRs are bad. It's that Bethesda has never made that kind of game before. They've never made ANYTHING like it. And the technical side of making a BR is HUGELY challenging.
---
Plus BRs need a MASSIVE number of simultaneous players. Fallout 76 has a constantly decreasing player count. A BR that actually costs money (as opposed to being F2P) is not going to change that. This means that either the player counts gana be REALLY low (which makes for a boring BR) or it's gana be a pain in the ass to get games all the time.
---
Finally, there are just SO many other BRs out there right now that the market is SUPER saturated. People already have their BR of choice for the most part.
---
These three things point to the fact that Fallout BR is a bad idea, not that BRs in general are a bad idea.
---
So, in short, the answer is "No, Characterful/RP builds don't work in this game".
---
I have a melee character as well... all STR and END. He's a *beast*. Definitely on "easy mode". 
---
Just... bummed. My "hunter/ real world survivor" build sucks anywhere but the forest.
---
Showing up on display off and on. Doesn’t seem consistent across the team either for when it is off and on. We redid the team several times last night, still was inconsistent and no team camps ever
---
Very sad
---
You people asked for it when you demanded pacifist save camps. Enjoy the consequences.
---
Quad hunting rifle
---
Mutant slayers ski sword
---
Two shot combat shotgun.
---
The only interesting things I've found in &gt; 400 hours.
---
(I have a couple of other legendaries in my stash -- the gatling gun from the survival mode challenge and an ghoul slayers tesla that I might try on the next nuked whitesprings I see).
---
"none of us" is a very bold statement. Reddit represents a TINY percent of this game.
---
I dont have the plans anymore. Sorry about that. I thought I still had a least 1 of them still.
---
My camp is in the forest by Slocum Jos and Gauley mine. I go north up hwy 59, head east over to Morgantown, travel south down the river (for plant and wood mats) and then head West to Flatwoods and back up to my camp. 
---
This route has easy enemies so you can get lots of loot. I pick everything up. This gets mats and sellable stuff (mainly low level weapons) for caps (at vendors not my stores).  Again you're not going to come across any legendaries this way but it's a simple and easy way to build up materials and caps.
---
Although ONE time I came across a 1* legendary Liberator. Lol
---
Clear bait but br is out of place in a roleplaying game
---
Very good point, thank you so much for your input, I was trying to give more perspective and I gained some in-return 💜 I appreciate that very much
---
It’s a high traffic location, most likely you will run into players. I saw the area was empty the other day so my level 15 alt went there to kill ghouls, then someone stopped by probably just to pick some flowers for his girlfriend, he left within 30 sec but I got surrounded by level 62 fat ghouls and died a dozen times lol.
---
No worries, I appreciate you checking
---
Woa a battle royale mode would be a disaster...NOT what the average fan is looking for at all.
---
The camera is also useful for finding those hard to see corpses. :)
---
So weird!
---
Thanks!  I think that one was in the Watoga Transit Hub lobby maybe?
---
It's very, very heavy and not much harder hitting than the combat rifle -- the fixer does more damage than a similarly set up handmade.
---
if i want battle royale, i'd download fortnite
---
They were an Atom Shop item.
---
https://i.imgur.com/JUMupiC.jpg
---
Fast travel point is always the same on camps. Youre not just put into a random spot at their camp. People need to fast travel to their camps before building to note where that point is and not build there, if can be helped.
---
Around level 60 atm
---
Sounds cool but new players are supposed to be leaving the vault for the first time into a destroyed world. These updates would make it so new players were emerging into an already re built world
---
Why thanks :)
---
I have an issue where my turrets go after the enemies and visitors kill my Brahmin. I've been filling my vending machines and seen multiple players attack them for no obvious reason. Asking wtf never gets an answer.
---
I do kill enemies at other camps though.
---
Theres a way to farm a ton of legendaries by turning off the jukebox periodically.
---
If it's a sniper definitely instigating. If it's a full auto then furious
---
What in the world.
---
Oh, ok. Thank you!
---
If you don't have budget for turrets and you wan't your camp to be pretty, then that is your decision. You accept your camp to look nice instead of being protected.
---
Other players jump to you for vending, not killing mobs, so you have to provide a safe environment for your customers. Customer is always right.
---
Writing this post won't help, because 99,9% of people that visit your camp didn't read it. You need to solve this on your end, not ask someone to do it for you.
---
Ah yes didn’t think of that. 
---
Great! Thanks!
---
Rejuvenated is a really good perk for aggressive play, grants great ap regen and a hp buff, plus the best disease resistance.
---
I’d switch one level of Gun fu for a permanent adrenaline point (honestly, all the points you can spare on it is good, makes the damage increase faster).
---
If you remember to use VATs criticals Critical Banker is superb.
---
A lot more than fallout 4. The DLCs even opened up more, so it's safe to say as more DLC is released more will open up.
---
if you see me online next time your on, we can try again..maybe with my main instead..might be a better result for you
---
No problem:)
---
Agreed 👌
---
Lol I have too much time on my hands
---
Me too, level 26 and if I venture out of the forest I get hit with legendary level 93 scorched or mutants. 
---
My next quest takes me to the array centre and when I got there, there was all level 70 super mutants there
---
I don’t know if I just get absurdly lucky or something but I got a two-shot explosive handmade from her followed by a 3 star armor piece that I actually use on like my 3rd and 4th runs through scorched earth
---
ahh good to know
---
And multi-player games have launch issues.  Sometime debilitating ones. Also, I think that bugs pop up in an online environment in such a way that it's hard to QA for them in advance.
---
Never mind that even comparing it to launches of single player games called Fallout its still not the most dysfunctional launch, but we forgave NV.
---
Am I wrong to assume the best loot comes from the events that pop up on the map? Appreciate the info
---
I like to stop and see what players offer. Some camps are like the cribs tv show.  I see some prices for nuka cola quantum for $25,000 caps. That’s crazy.  I need 2 more weapon plans to complete the challenge so that’s why I visit camps. Also stocking up on ammo if I need. Got over 21000 caps so I save them for weapon plans and recipes.
---
White knight helps with armor repairs, but I would suggest to invest those 3 points (or more, maybe take some away from bloody mess) in Marathoner and/or Action Boy. 
---
You want to sprint to/from enemy to enemy to keep the bonus from adrenaline going and perform power attacks most of the time, so AP management is very important. 
---
Maybe replacing 3 points in Evasive with 2 points in Moving target (36 DR/ER vs 30 DR/ER) would work for you too, it's up to personal playstyle I guess.
---
Location is key for taking pic!!!! 
---
Vertibot example... I took about a dozen pics of them and the only one counting was at the power plant on the pad from about 15 feet away and the word “vertibot” showed in camera. All others nothing...
---
I ALWAYS forget about critical attacks in VATS that’s why I didn’t put it in my build. Adrenaline is really not that important since all of your damage is coming from sneak attacks and VATS. Thanks for helping out though! 👍🏻
---
bummer, man! I haven't really tried to do much with it other than give away suits of L15 Raider/L25 T-45 to new players. So far it's been accepted, but I've only done it a few times.
---
This daily has been bugged for some time now. I'm a high level trying to complete the Pioneer quests and can't get it to spawn, I need those lovely seeds. From what I've discovered it seems only lower levels can get it to fire and they then have difficulty trying to repeat it.
---
Gatling plasma with a heavy build and ultracite plasma core's are really good and consume very little ammo.
---
It's my go to weapon against the SBQ, you can see her helt bar go down, slowly...
---
And if here friends get's to close i just do a spin around and that problem is normally taken care of :)
---
I always used a Gauss TSE / AAE against the SBQ, but after they fixed the energy weapons i changed :)
---
Do supermutants really run bloodied builds?
---
Currently preping the nuke now
---
Well they’re really good past like lv 40 one you get perks and a bloodied crit sniper using stealth could do more damage than most melee but you’ve gotta level up a good bit, Farm whitesprings w some people for easy xp then do the burrows and project paradise when you get high enough level
---
No it isn't you stupid bot, it's 55 yards.  Stop inventing precision that isn't there.
---
Heavy gunner / Unarmed melee build here ! 
---
TSE Gatling Plasma
---
TSE Gatling Gun
---
Anti Armor Deathclaw Gauntlet
---
Vampires Power Fist 
---
For when I need to use PA I have an Anti Armor Grognaks Axe.
---
Thats all! Try to keep it to essentials as I sell everything else for better Armor/weapons to sell/trade.
---
Get yourself a mining helmet.
---
It's such a dumb mechanic that wildlife like ticks, mosquitoes, and wolves want to attack inanimate structures that happen to be built by players anyway. Scorched, supermutants, and robots maybe. But animals?
---
Thought it was a mistake but a friend showed up and lit me up with an explosive gatling laser while his friend hit me with explosive shotgun think it was a trap
---
Rejuvenated is useless when you have speed daemon as someone told me “if you have speed daemon rejuvenated will be useless because your food and water will be draining super fast”. Other than that, thanks!
---
I think they should potentially look at this as an option for an event next year, the game still needs some bugs fixing and shit loads of optimization on console, those resources they'd be using to make a BR could be better spent elsewhere IMO.
---
I think it's from the cold case quest, which was seriously bugged up until one of the patches. As in i started it in November &amp; finished it yesterday.
---
The reward gun was max level though so at least there's that.
---
Head desk or facepalm too
---
Absolutely fantastic ideas.
---
Multiplayer, sadly, has kind of shit all over SPECIAL.
---
I accidentally doubly clicked on a power amour skin in the atomic shop and wasted 1200 atoms I worked my a** off for.
---
Because if your 1000Ibs out of 150Ibs you shouldn’t even be able to move so why should you be able to teleport
---
Honestly, this has been this way since I started playing and that was two weeks after launch.  
---
I have some tips to help this though.  
---
Alright, so if you aren’t running mutations, you’re going to want to run a max level of good with salt in luck.  It’ll keep anything you cook FRESH for a loooooong time.  Build a farm that includes carrots and corn, these make soups, soups fill your food and drink meter at the same time.  If you don’t want to build a farm there are several spawn points on the map where ingredients can be located, mostly at in-game farms.  Make sure you’re using the perks that satisfy more hunger and thirst as well.  If your meter depletes fast, then you should fill it faster.  Those perks can be found in endurance.  I can’t remember what they’re called, but one satisfies hunger more and one satisfies thirst more.  😇
---
If you’re tired of having to cook and your food spoiling super fast.  Get the plague walkers mutation.  It gives you a poison aura that scales with your diseases.  If you eat nothing but spoiled food and drink nothing but dirty water, you’ll always have food and thirst satisfied without needing the endurance perks or the perks in luck, AND you’ll have an AOE that can melt enemies around you.  The longer the disease, the stronger the mutation effect.  You’ll need starched genes at max rank to keep this mutation.  
---
Another suggestion, I use the cola nut and good doggy perks in endurance and it’s really easy to fill my health, hunger, and thirst all in one by carrying a few of each.  That might be up your alley if you know where they spawn or constantly find yourself finding nuka cola and canned dog food.  
---
With these two^ you should have a max rank of lead belly, so you don’t take radiation from eating or drinking.  
---
All these ways help, but it depends on your natural gameplay to figure out which combination works best for you.
---
There's an endurace perk, Nuka Nut IIRC, that at Rank 2 (max) it triples the benefits.
---
So Nuka Dark gives +3 strength instead of +1 and Colas restore 45% thirst for example.
---
Yikes! Why wouldn’t you kill them? I don’t even care about the xp, I just don’t want your camp destroyed when you come back.
---
Edit: It's playable and when I play it there are some weird noises repeating multiple times.
---
Allow me to point something out.
---
Dave is an ass,  Dave has built his shop/CAMP on a cliff with a pretty damn steady death drop.
---
Dave is unhappy that only 60% of his guests plummet to their deaths.
---
What’s this?  A fast travel mat?  Well then,   Dave builds out his balcony a bit and slaps it on the edge.
---
100% death rate for visitors achieved.
---
FO4... character building was entirely based around "how do you wish to do damage". "Pick your means of killing shit, and then pick some skills that modify how you kill shit"
---
Cool, thank you for the info man!
---
I wouldent mind a BR mode to be totally honest
---
I moved my camp/shop just outside of Whitesprings on the railroad track.  It has proven very good for my sales (so much so that i have to occasionally take my shop down because I've hit the 25,000 cap limit).  Unfortunately I didn't realize it was a spawn point for all matter of evil things.  Almost every time i come back to my camp I find one of the following: 3 Yao Guai, death claws, super mutants, snallygasters, or annoying mole rats.  I'm consuming a lot of resources to continuously rebuild my camp and defenses.
---
Huh. I had the exact opposite experience. I claimed the workshop and repaired the landing pad just to get an clear, easy shot of a VertiBird, but it remains the last unchecked item on that badge.
---
Happened 3x to me :/
---
I’ve seen that video. Cracked me up with all the fake doors!
---
Thats a little different. Haha Those kinds of plans I know how to price more easily since theres only one way to get them. Id probably do around the 2k mark as well since they are obtainable normally but youre paying for the convenience of not having to do the work.
---
Well, that's the theory, lol. Yes...doing actual events nets you better items sometimes and also items that may only be available through events and not found organically out and about.  But if you're just trying to build caps and camp materials, farming is the better route.
---
Wait, gatling lasers benefit from power user? And it actually uses the core with the lowest charge? What happens when you hit reload, which core will then be used?
---
were good mate :)
---
there has been quite a bit of that running around. ive seen things from if you are holding a certain weapon type you are more likely to get that weapon type, to if you are wearing one of those limited event masks you get better rolls. 
---
im like, the complete opposite. even with perk packs :D "woot lv 100... time for a perk pack" game goes "ah i see that you have 15 in perception and agility... but only 2 in endurance and 4 in charisma that you have used lone wanderer for 99% of your play time.... have 3 endurance cards, a charisma card... and gunslinger".... god damn it game.... a utility card please! :D i probably have more endurance cards than any other, and i only picked 2.
---
but to get back on point... at some point i put it down on paper. ive got about a 0.5% chance to get the exact 3\* weapon i want. and somewhere around the 4.5% mark to get something that i would be verry happy with. i assume the chances are similar for other builds, even less if you are going with a specific build like bloodied, and i find it fascinating how people apply causation to events when something goes right.
---
Having my Mad Doc character running around with my GT makes zero sense.
---
I agree, it would be a great idea, but then will cause issues with new players. I imagine the changes would need some story behind them, and new players wouldn't know what it was like before.
---
Gonna share this around to my play group. You have some good info here
---
I don’t understand why anyone locks away their crafting benches anyways.
---
Perhaps text channels could be an area locked function of the personal terminal, like say you could erect a signal tower at your base that can send and recieve text from another camp whose signal radius overlaps yours.
---
perhaps the signal could repeat, so hypothetically two camps could communicate on either side of the map provided a series of player towers connect them. This could encourage players to clump camps closer to each other, mot further apart in order to get the advantages of the player internet.
---
text chat moght only be one function, since it is rife for abuse maybe have a keyboard input text channel but also matchmaking functions and a trade board for buying. We can already see a summary of whats in a player vendor on the map but perhaps the player network could be used to flag certain plans or scrap so that a player looking for a certain plan, junk or legendary property they would get a message if a connected player vendor puts it up for sale.
---
Either way I think bethesda is onto a good thing with these mechanics bringing server communities together, I hope they keep it up so that the game can live up to its original pitch "rebuild america together".
---
The reason you're facing those high level enemies at top of the world is because a lot of high level players hang around and cause those level enemies to spawn.  It's hard to avoid unfortunately...
---
I haven’t played enough but it seems to reload fully and can split cores so you don’t end up with a pile of mostly depleted cores.
---
I love this game but man some of you guys cry way too much.
---
Sounds like you had a lot of fun, i love the SBQ fights :)
---
I have a similar issue, level 24. Played for hours today and only got to level 25. Any main missions I have available to me have much higher enemies in the 60+ level area.
---
Before I start: I wanna thank you for replying and sharing your thoughts. 
---
Rejuvenated is useless and not worth the perk point if you have speed daemon; your food and water will drain quickly and the effect will be gone in no time.
---
Adrenaline is not really the main focus since all of my damage is going to be focused around sneak attack damage in general, wether in VATS or outside of VATS. So I would say I like to keep myself out of adrenaline a bit.
---
I ALWAYS forget about critical attacks in VATS, that’s why I haven’t put in the build thing. 
---
Again, thanks!
---
It's wild how hard the fanbois are fanboing. Like, don't people understand that there are already tons of successful BRs, that BRs require a TON of people, that Bethesda has no experience making a good BR nor managing the massive technical hurdle one represents, and that most people who think of Fallout think of a single-player game, not a 100 person murder game?
---
Seriously...the people downvoting you are just ridiculous.
---
Nope.  But I think you can charge them rent.  ;)
---
Do it like ESO does. Both character name and account name are shown, but the viewing player gets to decide which takes precedence, so it can be character name in large text with player tag in small text under it, or vice versa.
---
Put points into melee/armor penetration and beat the shit out of everything.
---
I need a marine torso plan. I don't have much caps, but i could give you whatever i have and some items for trade. I have a few mini nukes and other things if that would help. I only lvl 37 so i don't have much but would give what i got.
---
Bored.  Unless they're hitting you with a board.
---
Wow. Kudos to you for going above and beyond.
---
Distant thunder is a great answer, it’ll pop up eventually, but you will get a lot of motion assist servos plans first! 
---
My suggestion would be to get some t60 legs and mod them.  The T60 is the cheapest repair in the game, and the legs need to be repaired the most.  Unless your specifically going for the nuka-cola paint job, the T60 will do you right.
---
You mean it combines two low charged cores so you get one fully charged one?
---
Most of the towns and cities have open buildings. I spend ages going through each one - probably too much time to be fair. Morgantown which is one of the larger early towns has an entire area with open shops and buildings, as well as several enterable, but separate areas if you get what I mean.
---
If the enemy was outside attacking the base it’s pretty safe to connect the dots.
---
RELEASE SOME NPCs FROM THE VAULTS
---
Thank you for your write-up.
---
There's several of these posts after every patch. I haven't noticed any changes.
---
Generally helpful with the right perks but the game has issues with stealth. As an example, I have a good stealth build but the Whitespring ghouls tend to all rush after a single maximum range silenced shot about 1 out of 4 times. The Evade perk can offset this issue a bit if you shot and scoot but avoid staying in the same place even when the radar says your hidden.
---
Is there an easier way to level faster? I mean it's on the one side good, higher enemies better loot and more XP but needing rockets to kill scorched is kind of hard.
---
will give it a try
---
Weird flex.
---
I actually bought that for 600 yesterday.  Not big into paint jobs, I only put on my PA in heavy rad zones so rarely wear it.  However, I thought for 600... why not?
---
Also are th
---
It would make answering someone's question very annoying though.
---
Ding, ding, ding. We found a winner here.
---
I dont have the Marine Torso plan. But feel free to swing by
---
I think it is an important trend and not just from a revenue standpoint.
---
From a design standpoint, Social Fun is an important factor to consider.  I would not consider myself a socialize with video games at all but 76 has converted me.  I love working with people and having conversations and showing off my camp.
---
How did you acquire a leather coat?
---
Since player towns are just an idea right now the image I am fixated on in 76 is the pioneer in his remote C.A.M.P listening at his radio or typing away at his refurbished pre war terminal for the local happenings in the world and with his other pioneers. 
---
I'm sure bethesda will be happy to bring more people into the atomic shop for some aesthetic flair.
---
Dude's cool AF. I don't follow him, but every time I stumble upon one of his videos, he just seems such a chill guy. Best friend material.  
---
Watched two parts of him playing Emperor: Rome and he was teaching history while playing. This sort of thing melts my heart.
---
Honestly - serrated machete.
---
And yet, they will still emulate the big cash games, and piss off the community again..... If Bethesda didn't want to basically be every shitty battle royal game out right now, with lazy cashgrabs, this game would have been PvE only, with a metric ton more in game items, and this overpriced Atom shop would never have even been a thought. I love Bethesda, but I'm not a big fan of their most recent actions.
---
In my experience, facing multiple Super Mutants with Miniguns is one of the worst case scenarios for Bloodied.  The Miniguns will proc Dodgy constantly, which drains your AP, which means you can't sprint, which means you continue to get hit, which means... you get the idea.
---
Yeah that's pretty good. I got a 3* instigating Handmade from a fog crawler but a 2* assassin's knuckl
---
es from the queen lol.
---
I never understand how people struggle with collecting caps. Having 10k is pretty easy as a base and then you go up and down from there. Do you buy every plan you see? Do you not trade stuff in? Genuinely curious.
---
Theres a vendor at Whitesprings, upstairs, that sells the flavors aswell
---
SPICY
---
The legendary exchange box is at the station. At every station.
---
You scrap the unwanted legendary for scraps that you can exchange on a diferent place.
---
You can get 150 scraps for a day.
---
So... scrap your unwanted low leveled legendaries to free some space up ;)
---
See? This is what bugs me about the game, entirely. 
---
I shouldn't HAVE to farm an area to make a build viable. Sure, some builds should be *less* viable.. and there should be a certain amount of math to make the *best* build, if that's your thing. But, to find that your level 25 character, with the *best* version of a specific weapon simply CAN'T enter the area that is supposed to be designed for "level 25 characters" is a bit.. strange.
---
They improved server stability in fast paced/busy areas at the expense of drastically reduced draw distances for all users on all platfroms though, seriously it's pretty dire looking through a scope pretty much anywhere,  compared to early days....
---
Hopefully not, he even admitted what people said was true.
---
For ranged encounters, try the Grafton events.  Grafton Days works great if you lure the monster to a place of your advantage (fusion core shed between train station on downtown for me).  A little bit better than men drop from the monster. 
---
Dungeon crawl with your friend through Leader of the Pack for him, pair up go to WV Lumber yard for a crawl as well.  Exp, with maybe some loot.
---
As a West Virginian that story really hit home.
---
There’s a video from Rifle Gaming on youtube from two weeks ago that pretty much proves there’s gonna be a BR mode.
---
YMMV. I sell magazines for 100 caps and they consistently sell within a day or so, even the kind of lame one that gives you a small damage boost against the Grafton Monster. Yesterday someone paid 1000 caps for a Super Stimpack recipe. I sold a 3 star legendary Gatling gun for 6000 caps. I sell all my duplicate drink recipes from Biv for 300 caps and they go within an hour or two. Same thing for the duplicate mounted animal plans I get from the insect parts scouts quest. I sell all my duplicate plans from workshops for 50 caps and most sell at that price. Nuka Cola Dark at 50 caps sells well for me. Mods at their default price also sell decently.
---
What doesn’t sell at all for me are Bobbleheads, food and chems, and ammo (probably because I don’t sell the ammo I can use so I’m just selling the less popular stuff.)
---
Maybe location matters? I’m just slightly north of Greg’s Mine Supply. I’ve also noticed a very big difference in sales numbers based on the time of day I’m playing. Weekends during the day are good, evenings during the week relatively early are good (after 9 or 10 sales drop off.)
---
Will do!
---
Well, sometimes I get lazy and buy shit instead of actually farming for it! So that's probably why. I farm a lot but then if I don't have very long to play....I'll just buy steel instead of finding it (which is super easy). So my problem is poor cap management. Lol
---
They also said "only cosmetics in the atomic shop" and we've seen where that went....
---
Customer is always right? Bahahahaha. Please work retail for a day to realize that the customer is rarely right, everyone else just has to put up with their nonsense.
---
No need to be a respectful player, but I’m thankful most choose to be regardless.
---
Even if, there was something actively attacking the base.
---
Do you still play FO76?
---
I think battle royale mode might be fun if Bethesda does it right.
---
I love the idea of at least opening up several houses and buildings that are closed up, there’s a huge opportunity there somewhere.
---
Thats actually a pretty good deal Lol
---
What can someone do about their spawn point?
---
People make new threads about increasing hunger or thirst literally every day saying they increased it last patch, it's really just people getting new mutations and fast traveling more and stoking it up to something in the new patch. When people confront them about how there's no data to base this on they always get angry and defensive, asking them stuff like "Do you think I'm lying???". Usually it's a case of not lying but people drawing conclusions based on nothing and expecting their experience to dictate what the truth is  
---
So yeah we definitely need more data and less pre-emptive conclusions in this subreddit, totally agree
---
I use the puke emote after I kill and loot a legendary with a group and get a bad drop.  I use this one an awful lot...
---
But now with player vending, im starting to rethink my plan of action.
---
Wow, and d3 were much better launches than this game. I didn't play GTA so I don't know about their online launch. But I did play WoW at launch and d2 and d3 at launch and all 3 were much better than this launch.
---
There is a reason people use the term "blizzard polish" to talk about a game that is extremely polished and well put together.
---
Well this was an unexpectedly wholesome exchange 🤗
---
the legendary vending machine is at all train stations, so youre good with accessing your stash. i would recomend scrapping your heaviest 1\* legendaries that you dont want first, as the game gives you a certain amount of scrip per star. it does not take the effect or level into the calculation. e.g. 1 star weapon is 5 scrip, 1 star armour is 3 scrip, regardless of level.
---
im on pc so i cant help in game but thats some advice to get you started.
---
Use can-do in whitesprings resort and grab any canned coffee it yields
---
Such a Jimmy.
---
Well, before they put all faction vendors in white springs, I made a sneaky B line across the savage divide into harpers ferry (lvl 25) and laid down my camp between there and the red rocket SE of there. Hardly ever dealt with attacks (all low level), the only trouble was that it would always load me into the festering water.
---
I feel like the more is less likely to have high ranked players wandering around, but there are some beastly creatures. You should explore as much as you can, albeit cautiously. Look up a map of general level ranges for npc’s in different zones. There is a minimum level for each one, but some have higher maxes. Also keep an eye on the map. If you see high level players in your area, you can expect some nonsense from npc’s.
---
Spawn point?  I spawn all over the place in my camp.  I’d love it if there was a consistent spot
---
Guy shot me from a distance, when I ignored him he ran up while I was hitting some bugs with my sledge and got in the way of my hits, then hit me with explosive rounds, he did this shit twice.
---
It literally made you poop yourself?
---
I believe so - haven’t played enough with it to be sure.  I’ll test it out more later today.
---
THIS!
---
Mobs can destroy camps.
---
I feel the same way, but am obviously wrong based on everyone’s comments. I don’t fast travel so who knows why it seems this way..
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary - I usually sweep through the courtyard. Low level super mutants, a chance for a bunch of lead and a tinker workbench.
---
Yep!
---
Ok.
---
Just how cool would this be!  Walking around of cracking snow in the dead of a dark night, worried about the white out conditions of the next storm.
---
no idea sorry lol
---
I dunno, the Vault 81 Overseer in FO4 seemed pretty sane. Both during the War and currently.
---
Any serum recipes? 
---
What were the drops for prime receivers?
---
I just wished , camp wouldn't make stuff spawn eveey 10 mins.. , not only i have to go check my camp all the time. I always get there too late and my wall is destryoed and my turrets aswell. Or at least make it so i can repair half broken stuff
---
Level 161 and I am 100% PVE, I just want to enjoy the Fallout experience, I'm not looking to ruin someone else's experience, nor get involved in PVP :( I just want to explore, grind, and enjoy my wares.
---
Yeah but you dont have to be far right.
---
Yeah.  I just want it to be consistent.  When you die, there should be a consistent order of operations that takes place which determines if you are or aren't over-encumbered.  Right now, it doesn't always seem to happen.  Sometimes your Strength perks wear off prematurely and the game decides you are critically over-encumbered and have to return to Vault 76.  Other times, it lets you get away with it.
---
I actually think this is a bizarre penalty in general.  If I'm critically over-encumbered, how exactly do I respawn halfway across the world at Vault 76 instead of simply being stuck where I currently am?
---
Well, he does have a degree in Classics so that type of game is his stomping ground. It's amusing when he compares the game's version of history to the known history.
---
Twice that? So.. 0%? 😂
---
This i can get behind
---
First… it’s my fucking water, and I can lock it if I want. There’s tons of water around, you don’t need *my* water. Second… like you said, people will get in or up to my workstations and if they do, cool, doesn’t bother me. To get to mine, you just need marsupial. I wouldn’t lock them. I don’t mind people getting up there, but I don’t want to just unnecessarily throw workstations around the vendor stations.
---
If I come across a vendor in the forest with worthless, low-level stuff for sale I might look about the map for this player.  I see this camp belongs to a level 10 player and all of a sudden I'm buying some stuff I don't need just to help out.  After all, I don't really need 22K caps.  
---
On another note...  A few weeks ago we were dropping known plans in suitcases and cash registers.  Now those same plans are 100  caps each??  WTH?  In many ways the game is certainly evolving.
---
I want battle royal, and dm.
---
Apparently they're also accurate to a distance somewhere in Canada. It's amazing, when the gunfire starts you have to walk half a mile in it's direction to get vats to register.
---
Oh AND I fast travel a lot...see, lazy vaultdweller!
---
Grind the Whitesprings golfclub.  Shooit through the windows.
---
what? people being civil and engaging in a fruitful conversation? ON THE INTERNETZ!!! :D
---
to quote the great and wise major in spin city. "getting angry is like eating a steak through a straw, you get all red in the face but in the end you dont get any steak."
---
For melee, I'd say Instigating, because there are few enemies that stand up to the 10-or-so hits needed for Furious to fully take effect (+50% damage) whereas many enemies will die to Instigating's 2x damage.
---
As others said though, if you rely on auto weapons, then Furious will shine.
---
I ran across one not long ago. First pet I’d seen and didn’t realize you could tame in 76 so I thought dude’s camp was under attack. Shot a few times then realized the deathclaw was not coming after me or doing anything which led to a moment of confusion. Then the camp owner who was like level 260 or so much popped out and gave me the heart sign so I’d know it was a friend lol 
---
I just stopped to watch the thing for a minute then bravely went past to shop
---
Eastern Regional Penitentiary - Has low level super mutants and ghouls. The courtyard has a tinker’s workbench and a chance for a bunch of lead. Plenty of enemies in and outside. Rarely see high level players hanging out there.
---
Oh yeah forgot about her
---
I like it, personally. It’s not like people didn’t suddenly stop eating after the apocalypse.
---
I kill them all, loot them and scrap everything in the CAMP.
---
Profit.
---
If you count frantically dropping spoiled meat and vegetables in an attempt to run then yeah
---
But Locking your door doesn’t deter the mobs from attacking your camps
---
Thanks so much dude.
---
Do I need a t60?
---
The majority of players don't share your empathy.
---
Yep. This makes me glad Bethesda doesn't always give the things the vocal minority wants.
---
Aha great, saves me a long old walk this way. Cheers!
---
Send me your ign, I play late evening and am willing to run tank for you if itll help. Bonus points if you enjoy discussing mst3k, Michael j Fox, and Sherman High School.
---
looks like your "huge " community is 8 people. lol
---
What about the sack hood?
---
That's boring though, there's cooler things like the tinfoil hat to wear
---
It does stop them from attacking it from the inside out. Especially if it’s an area you want to be AFK for a bit.
---
Yes, all of this.
---
This will definitly be BR... the leaks almost confirm it...
---
I get your fear of Rejuvenated being useless for Speed Demons (I’m one too) but it’s really not a problem. Thirst is easy to quench and the +50 AP regen is the highest in the game I believe.
---
If nothing else, it’s something you can use during boss fights.
---
Cola Nut and Partyboy/-girl makes end game thirst quenching inherently stronk and easy too (alcohol +45%), some real synergy with rejuvenated there. The HP buff from rejuvenated is nice too but the ap regen is gold.
---
So you honestly think a Fallout 76 BR that costs money to play can compete with Fortnite and Apex, which are free and already have MASSIVE playerbases invested in them? This seems like such a bad idea.
---
well im sorry they don't but I'ma keep being me.
---
Enemies spawn at any camp regardless of where it is placed. It's an in game mechanic. For example my buddy has a camp at the top of a mountain and evenm it gets attacked.
---
yea, people can take stuff personally. i blame the social media boom that makes people think they are special :P
---
but with player vending and the higher availability of say speed demon, i would not be surprised to find that people dont take into account the extra hunger and thirst usage for the mutation.
---
I don't know if I'd like to see things permanently "rebuilt" over time, but I like it when they sneak in little alterations, like Morgantown Airport's renovation.
---
Free XP. I always kill them.
---
Bet I can
---
Ign is Auno94. Maybe we find a time (living in Western Europe 😅)
---
It’s ALWAYS the cats that fuck things up. Blame it on him and hunt him down. I do the same irl with my wife’s cats. Fluffy little bastards but god do they fuck things up
---
Ah, I’ve only gone in there like twice, and it’s been ghouls or mole miners
---
Damn it was a slow ass dab too. He wanted the guy to really feel it the whole way through.
---
I think I’ve just spent too much time a far more toxic game communities hahaha
---
I'd be alright with it if the game was properly balanced. As it stands, the game is a shitshow balance wise.
---
Upvoted for usefullness
---
nah it's a pretty dumb way to format the post
---
Thats not the point i was making. Its that the game has been saturated with god tier loot since day 1. PvP is worse because of it. Imagine Survival if you had to start fresh and all the duping was patched. The game would be very different.
---
Yeah it's weird, so I have a bunch of turrets set up - sometimes they'll snap to the enemies instantaneously and mow them down.
---
Other times I sit and watch a single mole-rat molest my turret and it just stands there and takes it.
---
no worries mate, forgot to mention that there is a daily limit of 150 scrip. this is why i recommend the 1\* first, as you get the least amount for them, so you will clear up the most room/weight.
---
I have also changed my PSN name and so far no noticeable effect in FO76 (or anything else as of yet)
---
Huh
---
Yeah, I've just given up on melee weapons from the Purveyor.  There is *so much junk* in the melee pool, it's ridiculous.  Plus, it only costs 60 caps to roll for 3\* armor.
---
well yes and no. Bloodied is the current meta, so with health under 20%, adrenal reaction, nerd rage and other buffs, you can get damage on weapons such as melee and ranged that go over 1k to 10k. It's good for shear brute force, but you can easily die if you'r caught in an explosion, or someone runs up to you with a gamma gun, or has a weapon with the executioners effect that does 50% more damage if the opponent is under 40% health.
---
To get good damage you need to have really dangerous requirements, and with the nerf of assassins sentinel armour effects, it's a lot more futile.
---
TL:DR
---
It's good, hated upon many people, like how TSE was back i the day, you can get insane damage, just at sacrificing a lot and being pretty futile, one slap of a charred Feral ghoul and you're dead.
---
I wouldn't recommend, as it may be nerfed sooner or later, so I try and run Anti-armour and \*Instigating the most, just that they don't give as much damage out, especially instigating if the enemy isn't at 100% health.
---
I don't see it...
---
okay so you could send local messages all the time, it would appear near your character so ppl near you could see it, but also you couldn't spam the same thing like 5 times in a row. also you could send private messages to ppl.
---
what i meant was that server wide messages were only once every 5min
---
Bruh most if the people that play this game are older and dont use much of social media if you use game chat or basically this one or discord in game chat you can meet a lot of people with most are older men and women 35 and plus I know a fckn 56 year old that plays and don't use much internet beside Facebook
---
You're right I messed up lol
---
I like the theory that the release was pushed about a year before the game was ready to ship and that robots can be made to work on bethesda's engine jury rigged for multiplayer than the human and ghoul npc's.
---
It's entirely possible that NPC humans are on the horizon because the dev team are continuing to work on very core elements of the game and the engine that couldn't be finished by the release deadline.
---
So you will learn to not take everything. ;)
---
I’m actually a non-auto rifle build so I’m definitely going with the instigating after your responses. 
---
I have a furious gauss which idk how good is, but I feel like when shit hits the fan and I’m all alone that little extra damage, when already spottet, per shot helped out. 
---
But for somehow didn’t think that the double damage at first shot could clear out enemies in another way
---
You can tame almost any animal for your camp, but you need certain perks. Google a video for it. Anybody can have a Brahmin, you need the Brahmin pen plan learned and it's under "resources" marked as fertilizer
---
It's going to be long but hopefully it works in my favour having held on to so much. Definitely will start with low star and heavy items. Clever stuff!
---
Probably just back for workshops?
---
Where's my trusty Vault 13 canteen?
---
If you see players in a spot that’s not located on the map it’s probably a camp...
---
i get ya :)
---
im aware of this, thats why i always try to find some middle ground. as im investing my time to communicate i want that exchange to be as fruitful as possible. 
---
i also have no problems accepting that im wrong or apologizing.
---
those 2 things go a long way... pay it forward :D
---
I was friends with one of his 'disciples', who had been power levelled by riflegaming in big bend tunnel. Closest I've ever been to a fallout celebrity haha.
---
"bruh" ?? i guess im talking to a teenager. lol
---
Sometimes when I do that, I end up getting stuck when I wouldn't have.
---
Now that I know players spawn to the location where you originally placed your C.A.M.P. item, but most of us built our C.A.M.P.s before knowing this. I suppose you could blueprint your current C.A.M.P. and replace the object, but that costs caps and there is a chance you would be able to place your C.A.M.P. in the exact same way.
---
Basically, we as the players need to be able to define the spawn location - basically smack right front in the vendor.
---
I have a Brahmin and a deathclaw. Brahmin is the plan fertilizer producer, tame animals with animal friend
---
My gameplay hasn't changed since before player vending and I don't jump from camp to camp to check out players vending machines. I am spending a ridiculous amount of time on my food and water now, compared to before the last patch. People keep saying nothing has changed for them but for me there has been a massive change.
---
Consoles can't access the dev room anymore, so that's probably not it
---
I might estimate Xbox being a bit higher than ps4 for this game, because of the relationship Fallout and Xbox have. I'll just be over here sulking with my ps4 and shitty creation club stuff for 4 because Sony wants to be a dick.
---
By the way, in a video about Anthem, they mentioned games in the top 50 current players, and 76 was in the top 50 list. I can't rember the platform though.
---
aparently its the center of the map. people spawning in will show there
---
Have you seen the Railway Rifle grief for train stations?
---
Do people not have endurance perks?
---
Oh so now one word defines my age?? Sound about kidish
---
Read the last inside the vault, they go over all of what's been added in Wild Appalachia in the first paragraph. I'll link it in a second. Last time I answered this question I missed like 3 things
---
I see a lot of people who are practically giving items away to help others, but I also see a lot of comments from people who say they take advantage of these by flipping their items for a much higher profit. Makes me not want to bother as the latter would snatch up items way faster than the people who would actually want the items for themselves.
---
I think the current designation is pretty efficient. It supports collection of various weapons and armors. 
---
I'd like to see a legendary mods concept where each mod costs 1000 scrip, but can be applied to any weapon. It can even be added into the current design with making specific mods available for that true designer weapon and the "dream weapon."
---
Ty for the info
---
Id get as much sneak effects as i could if i was you, helped me a lot when i was low level. If they cant see you youll stay alive way more
---
But think of how freaking maddening it is to end up inside your building, no matter which direction you FT from...   
---
Put your private stuff on the 2nd floor!
---
It can be random for the camp owner, but for visitors it's always the same spot (in my experience anyway)
---
then dont talk like one. your comment dont even relate to what i said.
---
Ehh hold on there. 300 for each reroll isn't crazy. You probably wont get what you want after the first roll. But the prices should probably be different for armor and weapons, with weapons being more expensive.
---
Fast travel mats have been in the workshops since release but having been given to player camps yet.
---
How long do the plans remain in the suitcase?
---
lol hoarders
---
Was installing a game and got bored of waiting.  
---
Here you go lmao.

---
Yeah, I see a tall tower with the fast travel at the top and a lvl 3 locked door  at the bottom, lined with punji boards, some turrets, and a flame trap or two.
---
Why harvest junk when people can deliver it?
---
I went to the pad, repaired it, it appeared and took the pic by the car right in front of it. 
---
Only area that showed the word in the lens.
---
Sometimes I use my pearly peepers to track targets *(if I dont have a scoped sniper that tracks with me)*
---
You're right. Deleting.
---
Ok, that seems like a pretty solid idea.
---
Same - kept respawning today at vault76 after being killed by SBQ, risking to miss the Scorched Earth event completion.
---
Other than rain or rad showers, weather hasn’t been a factor so maybe they’ll get worse... like a rad shower actually killing you...
---
Makes me hate people 😩
---
You have a deathclaw? So every time you load into a world there’s a docile death claw at your camp?
---
Really, and you know this how?
---
That’s what they get for lollygagging so long in the vault
---
You're the type of player that puts on his Mic and starts yelling over a claimed workshop huh? Relate ?? I'm just stating that you're assuming I'm a kid which makes you the kid. Kid
---
Id be fine with it if it had some profound story related to Fallout 76. Besides, I'm more interested in what Wastelanders might be.
---
A Division 1 Survival-style Battle Royale would be awesome. Harsh blizzard, crafting clothes and gear, more PvE than PvP
---
I personally think the chasing trends aspect has been Bethesda’s biggest weakness lately. Ever since Skyrim, it feels more like Bethesda’s been trying to make other people’s games instead of just doing what they’re good at. Fallout 4 felt like a duct-taped mess of a BioWare game, Minecraft, Destiny/Borderlands, and then finally some true Bethesda Game thrown in, with none of those parts by themselves being very effective and therefore never combining to make a substantial whole. Fallout 76 still feels like the Minecraft and Looter-shooter mix in a well-designed BGS world, just with another layer of live-service and MMO tropes tacked onto it with Daily quests, events, etc. that again, never truly come together to form a cohesive whole. 
---
Games like Oblivion, Skyrim, and Fallout 3 SET trends after they come out. The conversation after those games came out was about how other games were trying to emulate them and their successes, not the other way around.
---
But don’t take this as me hating on Fallout 4 or 76. I’ve put a lot of hours into both, and I greatly enjoy both games. I just want to see Bethesda harness the potential they possess again and get back to setting trends and blowing our minds.
---
Beth doesn't chase trends? Then why did they implement crafting when Minecraft came out? Why are they using the perk cards like the current trend of deck games?
---
Yes, 100% ! I got trained to constantly reload by many online shooters (I'm looking at you "Planetside" 1 &amp; 2) and that is actually a bad habit for Energy Gatlings.
---
I always do, except if I spawn (trapped) in the floor, then I let teh molerats dig me out
---
wrong all the way around and now that is your only argument. and feeling hurt. lol bye.
---
do you know if that stacks with party girl and alcohol?
---
no thank you, i like my hairstyle as it is.
---
Sell a serum to a vendor for 450 caps, it then appears selling for 3500 caps... why would they change scrip for players that much for unwanted items? They wouldn’t and they know this.
---
Nuka colas with Cola nut, Canned Coffee, or Sunshine Oil if you want to craft mass amounts
---
Thanks!     
---
Some positive reinforcement never hurts!
---
I believe that's call the Mk 1 Iball
---
personally i calculate how much legendary scrip in the form of items i am carrying a day (due to the daily limit), come to the optimal amount to weight ratio and just sell the rest to the vendor, unless its something that another player might want. in that case i use the player vending to sell for caps.... under-priced to get rid of it as quickly as possible.
---
also if you are a hoarder (no disrespect intended), id get on the new scout quest as soon as possible. it will give you a backpack on quest completion. scrap that one as you will get plans for one, and craft one appropriate to your level (unless the one you get is for your level). the level 50 gives +60 lbs carry weight.
---
when you complete the quest you will be promoted to possum (from tadpole). you can earn possum badges from completing challenges (found in main menu -&gt; challenges -&gt; world) or from completing the campfire tales event, found at adams camp i think????? it will defiantly be faster to do the event by server hopping. after you aquire 8 possum badges you can hand them in at the vending machine where you started the quest for a high capacity mod that gives another +60lbs carry weight, bringing it to 120lbs total.
---
however the backpack does stack with power armor.
---
It would be nice if the vendor screen said what the mod did. Without me having to look it up on the fallout wiki instead.
---
People like this are why I don’t like vending. It’s great you can make insta-money, but it would be nice if these items were left for the people who need it and can’t afford it, like the vender was likely hoping for.
---
&gt; I've gotten many shitty rolls myself, I just feel like the chance of  getting the same weapon type, the same two mods both right after one  another is astronomically low.  
---
Right, and yet, it happens way too often to be coincidence, imo.
---
I remember getting something useless like a Hunter's Golf Club from the Purveyor.  Scrapped it.  Went back.  She gave me another Hunter's Golf Club.  It's the same way I'd get runs on Anti-Armor things, or getting three Tesla Rifles from three subsequent Ghouls - the latter is statistically improbable given the large pool of weapons.  This is downright common for me, but it rarely happens if I'm staggering things out, encountering a Legendary every few minutes.
---
No one but Bethesda knows for sure, but what I'm convinced of is that there is some logic like "The next X Legendaries will carry this prefix" / "be of this type" in place.  And it's constantly switching between these based on time too, but if you generate enough Legendary requests within a certain window, they will have very similar attributes.
---
Mine is open and my water is free...
---
"Let me in, LET ME IIIIIIIINNNNN!!!"
---
This QA is shit though. You can't even write tickets to fix problems. They could solve a bunch with open beta servers before rushing little content releases that bring back dupes and bugs we experienced at launch. 
---
Nv release was from a different company under time constraints  with a rented license. The reason it was forgiven was because despite the bugs they took the franchise forward in every aspect. The modding was/is amazing as well. 
---
Bethesda themselves said blatent lies and were cryptic in all aspects of the release of 76. Then put out a game with all the bugs of a winters past. To top it off they didn't let the community fix their mistakes like usual. Rather they opted to embrace the bugs and charge you 6 bucks to not have enough build space left to use your new statue or floor tile.  35 person buddy list 20 of them quit after a month the last 15 i made since then and only 2 of those play. 
---
Steam alone says theres 3200 people playing fallout nv on pc.  If i server hop  on 76 at some point i end up seeing familiar names from earlier.  Not much bigger of a pool of players and the games not 8-9 years old but the bugs are. I can't imagine how much worse this game must be on a console with hardware restrictions.
---
You can repair op camp without being on there team?  I had no idea. I will defiantly start doing this as well. I do kill any creatures attacking players camps.
---
Here and there. I've been focusing on other games lately like Metro Exodus, and on other hobbies now that the driving season started back up (especially since I just bought another car).
---
Used to be I would at least log in every day to do the dailies and maybe a few things, but those have since gotten completely fucking out of hand and I generally don't even bother to log in and check them anymore.
---
Customer is always right, yes, even if they are wrong... You don't have to work in retail to know that and who hasn't worked there?
---
Your just asking other players, who are not responsible for the mob spawn,  to solve your issue instead of doing it yourself.
---
It's ok if players do that, it's their choice to do so, but put some effort yourself before asking others.
---
Yes I have a pet deathclaw too~
---
I feel like Dave would be a rarity and that the good would outweigh the bad.
---
Giving man. Thank you
---
Hey, be courteous, or I'll blow your doors off by any means I can, simple rule of the wasteland.
---
Understood, and thank you, adding and will keep an eye on what you find, thank you for putting this together!
---
Does this mean assaultrons are like iPhones and charge of you put them back-to-back?
---
Would be better if that great voice acting was coming from a character.
---
Why is one piece better than having full set? Is it 75% chance PER piece or does it have a CD per roll?
---
Mines open and free, I just hafta remember to put the decom arch back
---
What are your skills right now?  Can you go to the perk planner site and link your perk build?  Sounds like you haven't specced into a certain weapon type well enough.
---
Craft it from what? 2-3 other items you’d have to go find?
---
Thanks! My friends and I spent hours last night server hoping to no avail.
---
Yep! He’s lvl 21, and defends my camp
---
It’d be easier to farm materials than just find it. I just made 55 sugar 🤷‍♂️
---
Post this.
---
Obviously you haven’t since you think the saying is true lol. But no matter, enjoy doing you.
---
Just buy ammo and get banned for duping when you have 100k of 5.56
---
Sure I wasn't looking for mods anyway
---
Go on 76 marketplace and, depending on how many caps you have or what you have to trade, get yourself a good vampire’s Melee weapon (preferably with Swing Speed). That will help immensely with higher level enemies.
---
what is your gt and platform? i am always hunting plans and recipes
---
Ah, that makes sense. I’ve avoided those challenges so far.
---
I lock my gate and main door so that enemies can't get in. I keep the porch door unlocked though next to a guard post that you can jump onto the porch from, with a couple of neon arrows showing the way.
---
I remember Diablo 3 being impossible to sign on to for weeks.  Don't forget the Auction house controversy. And Wow came out in 04 and had many complaints even though it was pretty revolutionary at the time from a design perspective.  GTA launch issues where so rough they actually turned off Microtransactions.  Oh, completely forgot about No Man's Sky. 
---
By the way, do you know it's not easy to find information on bad launches?  It seems like if an online game improves people forget about bad launches.
---
76 is different in this regard, because a lot of building interiors actually exist within the game's overworld, as opposed to existing behind load screen like in Fallout 4.  So, like, when you explore the giant digger in the Ash Heap, all of that is actually in the overworld.  You don't load into it.
---
So, as a result, there are actually few loaded interiors.  Maybe only a handful per region.
---
It actually does wonders for immersion, though.
---
Maybe a connection thing? This happens to me, usually with some other stuttering that looks like internet issues (based off only my experience playing online for a long time**) 
---
Weird that it seemed so persistent for you though, usually it happens briefly in a mob then I just keep shooting and the game *and* server start registering hits. Instead of just the game registering them, then the server “heals” them by undoing damage it thinks was never done.
---
“might not be the bulk of the dlc” 
---
Come on...this is Bethesda we are talking about here. This mode is probably most of the dlc or did you forget the pitiful DLC for Fallout 4?
---
Because then you'd just set your camp up right next to a train station and then we'd have to deal with posts complaining about the daily cap limit being 1400
---
Honestly, just get rid of the whole camp attack mechanic. Nobody likes it.
---
My system is both efficient and encourages the collection of various items too.
---
The main benefit is when you role an absolutely horrible 3 star, all your hard work wasn't wasted, as you can try your luck again, just at the cost of a star. Progressing down till the most you can come away with is 5 scrips. With how varied the roles can be with legendaries, I don't see the ability to have values that allow you to trade down as that great of an advantage.
---
I like to walk actually... so not exactly true...
---
Obviously faction stuff is on the roadmap, it's fucking obvious
---
You can from the main menu on Xbox, not sure about other platforms.
---
So, don't build a camp?
---
I completely agree, but it doesn't hurt to throw it out there :)
---
Sounds like that’s the plan with “Wastelanders”
---
Granted, they’re very hush hush on the topic but from the name alone we can assume it’s going to introduce wastelanders (read human NPCs) into Appalachia
---
Great writeup.
---
I definitely agree that the adds are what make the fights fun. In most games, being on add-duty is an insulting assignment, but I jump at the opportunity in SBQ fights. What an odd, pleasant surprise.
---
Seems like it's related to server hopping. The only two times it's happened to me was when I was logging out 30 times in a row trying to get an event for a stupid daily challenge. Make sure you give the game enough time to fully load in your camp and vending machines before disconnecting
---
Are you wearing Power Armor? I would recommend it. I think there is some at your level but don’t recall where.
---
Wow. I didn’t know the perk worked like that. How come, in my travels to various player’s vending, I haven’t seen any deathclaws or others monsters guarding people’s camps? That sounds like something everybody would want. Also, is he only docile while the perk card is equipped?
---
Out of curiosity, does the freezing ability of the Cryolator scale with the damage it does?  Is that what a Bloodied Cryolator would actually do?
---
Because the power armor doesn't have a backpack....or pockets.
---
Add a “hot/cold” comfort meter to the thirst/hunger that if it gets to extreme starts hurting you.
---
If you have every kind of flux you can craft them or the Enclave bunker sometimes sells them. Either that or player vendors, fusion gens or old power armor.
---
I do everytime. Purification
---
Northern section of map has firefly. East if lumber mill in NW
---
I don’t really care about BR as long as we get plenty of other good content. I’ll just be annoyed if BR comes out and that’s the bulk of content for a while.
---
meh, would be waste of a post. They dont actually care.
---
that seems really cheap, i heard you should sell 1 cap per percent charge??? i don't know personally, i just saw several posts on here.
---
Just do whitesprings resort 3-5 times (server hoping) and you’ll get a couple thousand caps and legendary items. I usually do the entire resort in 45 min about twice, before I get into quests and what not
---
why? it would totally ruin the story  being told here on all levels.
---
that's why I created a room just for going AFK.
---
Ok im a bit busy today, but il be on tonight ( US west coast time) il need the caps before i make it, dont wana get ripped for all that materials.. i have pretty high karma, you can see my posts so you can see im trustworthy too
---
I’d like to have a look! 
---
add me PSN: CaptainModrah 
---
not Capitan ;)
---
Inside Mama Dolces there is a secret Chinese bunker under it. Once you get the key card to open it, there is a fusion generator. I would server hop and and get some fusion cores. I normally always find one in there because the bunker is almost never visited and is a pretty secret location. Search a you tube vid on how to get in if you have never found it before.
---
Where is a good place to get the plans for that? I have yet to find one..
---
Too late to join? I haven’t done a nuke run yet and want the achievement
---
People are spreading the rumor based on what their dataminer psychic friends have told them.
---
I moved my camp from the far west of the map to just beside Solomon pond as a better retail location.  I make more money.  However, I do receive much more damage from enemies.  It is a trade off.  You can’t expect people coming to your camp to take care of all of its problems.  I have to keep materials on hand so I can repair it on a regular basis.  Move to a safer region if you can’t stand the heat.
---
I hate locked doors at camps which do vending.  I understand that you want a private area, but 90% of the time I show up inside the locked area without the ability to get out.
---
I don’t think the spawn within structures issue is the fault of the camp owner.  I have a problem right now where I spawn into the actual terrain of the area of my own camp.  Something is really screwy.
---
I'm not entirely sure this is how it works.  I know it's a tidbit that comes up repeatedly, but like all Scorchbeasts, the Queen *can* stagger and still fly forward.  I'm pretty sure they have her set up where if she "decides" to land, she's going to get into position and do it, regardless of what else is happening.
---
Freestates give the plans i believe
---
I think I got mine from the SBQ
---
Mount Blair train yard. Battle not event, fusion core generators and power armour frames.
---
If you want a battle royale go play a battle royale. Not every game needs to be this.
---
If you play FO76 and you play it like it’s an MLG, PVP battle royale fest and you’re super competitive... do yourself and this community a favor and gtfo. This is not that game.
---
I have a locked room, just for me to sleep in and go AFK. anything else is wide open.. only other thing I kinda lock is the switch to my vending machines..
---
Can you take a players crops/water without becoming wanted?
---
Also farm the Grafton Steel yard.  The mutants are usually low level and you get a ton of steel, pkastic and other items from thier drops.  Don't take the workshops over though.  The PVP'ers camp those spots and will kill you and loot your junk as soon as you take it over.  I have learned to get everything I need by roaming the wasteland.  Just stay to the left of the savage divide until you can handle the higher enemies.  But don't entirely avoid them either.  The higher your enemy, the better xp you'll get and the faster you'll level up.  Farm the one star weapons you don't need and scrap them at the purveyor.  It's a gamble, but you may get a good legendary drop and it could help you level faster.
---
Million times this.
---
Downvote me all you want, but they regularly update Save the World, you can look at patch notes.
---
I had no idea. Thank you! &lt;3
---
300 scrips is definitely not enough for such thing.
---
let say we have 20 weapons and 20 legendary primary traits, this mean 1/400 chance to get what you want (just with primary trait). do the math. 
---
If you can set one parameter you should need to spend probably something those 400\*count Scrips you need to actually spend to fix the RNG.
---
Path of Exile offer that kind of process, and rerolling a given trait while keeping some fixed parameters is really really expensive. And that make sense: you can take the chance at lower price, (and never get what you want), or spend a large amount of currency for something garanteed
---
Ok I'm on all day till bout 10 pm (UK) and we on ps4
---
I'm not sure how fast it loads with only one of the effects (Speed Demon/Faster Reload), but this is how it loads for me with both:  https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/deathknell1972/video/75205608
---
OC's in this subreddit: Pls do this instead of this
---
Bethesda: Naw.
---
I'll probably be on some point today. Not sure yet. Did I give you my IGN?
---
Well, especially for something where ammo is kind of precious/heavy, it makes more sense to have Instigating.  Gauss Rifles are probably quite similar to melee, in that they're most likely going to kill the enemy outright, rather than force the user to expend multiple shots.
---
Furious, like Executioner's, really comes into its own against high HP bosses like the Scorchbeast Queen.  But the common enemies rarely get to that point with many weapon types.
---
Lmg is better in PVP and gatling is better for everything else
---
I know, i've had to do it before. This time nothing was there.
---
Ah shitty im on xbox Lol, guess we shoulda figured that out awhile ago
---
Yeah, If they’re not locked, as well extractors. If they aren’t locked they’re open to all.
---
Hey, wake up, its a wasteland, invincible bases and invincible players is for kiddies and you already have those modes. Oh be sure to feel safe that nobody's going to attack your piggy bank either with all caps being nerfed too.   
---
Thanks to people like you this game has had nothing but nerfs added to it for months. If you don't want a battle, don't play an MMORPG, Don't play games that are based off the concept of a nuclear wasteland where things are supposed to be hard. Whats the effing problem with a 3rd mode, just dont use it. Some of us have been asking for a mode where we can play for real cap amounts and defend our bases like real men, we don't however: spend our time trying to have childrens mode removed from the game (aka adventure mode) or survival mode removed, (aka pvp mode for people who can't defend their bases or caps)  
---
Ask for features you want but dont be a dick and demand a mode you never have to use be removed from the game.    Straight garbage.
---
I found that Bethesda was very open and forthcoming with all information about this game. I know "16 times the detail" is a meme now but besides that they showed us everything about the systems before launch.  No one should have been surprised.  
---
Also, in a video about Anthem, they showed a top 50 list of games by current players, and 76 was there.  In the 40's, but not deserted like you make it out to be.
---
I don't know enough about ticketing or beta servers to comment on that, but everyone loves to play armchair developer so I really have to take that kind of stuff with a grain of salt.
---
I have some you can have.
---
I haven't had an issue with taking a wksp then hopping servers.  Yet...
---
At level 29 I was fully exploring the Ash Heap with a regular albeit highly modded handmade. It's pretty easy at that level, and there's usually a legendary in one of the estates down there. Also maybe do the Order of Mysteries quests if you haven't. It will throw some higher level enemies at you, but not the way some of Rose's quests do. And get your excavator armor if you haven't already. The levels will come quicker, in my experience, from level 35 up. That's not due to farming, but rather to some of the better damage perks opening up. If you're a rifle build, Tank Killer opens up at 30 I think, and it's awesome against super mutants.
---
I wish enemies didn’t attack structures rather than the players there in adventure mode
---
Honestly...I'd probably buy it just because it would stand out
---
This is 100% the reason they're not in the game. And now that camps are indestructible it's easy to just trap people wherever you want by controlling where they'd spawn. They need to work that out before implementing them.
---
I think that is a bad idea. There are enough god rolls in circulation already thanks to duping. Just embrace the grind. Not even Warframe allows that crap on rivens
---
I think suppressors add durability tpo
---
Then this game isn't for you. 
---
It's not Fallout 5. 
---
Play the game for what it is and stop complaining
---
How is BBT used for power levelling? I got an alt that I was using to get to level 100 for the achievement as my main started in beta, got to 80-something and burnt out doing the Whitespring loop. Wouldn't mind a new method.
---
lmao.. scared the heavy junk out of me
---
I’ll teleport to my camp start fixing my shit then I’m attacked by a damn mob! Every time. Also I was sneaking on a main road once and saw a pack of ghouls spawn they were crossing it but slowly went towards me even as I was HIDDEN. They walked right Into me.
---
If your on xbox I can make it shrouded
---
Sugar.
---
PS4, but I appreciate the offer!
---
You forgot to add the random world event where a nuka-prime giant robot is deployed to ensure that everyone in Appalachia gets a free sample of Nuka-Quantum, but it must be stopped because the keg-sized bottles it throws have become unstable and are actually small atomic bombs waiting to blow up.
---
You think?
---
That small lake is nice for the aesthetics too, saw one the other day that had a perfectly placed fence around the perimeter
---
And I see people are down voting your comment. Typical behaviour from a toxic community.  Just because they don't have the same problem you must be wrong and they must be right.
---
thing is tho as much as I agree with this post, Reddit doesn't make up most of a player base. maybe a fraction? idk. In reality, tho they'd have to make polls or something on multiple places to get something like this removed if it is on the way, to begin with.
---
There is a billboard in the cranberry bog that says nuka cola cranberry so it wouldn't be lore breaking. I would love to see this happen lol.
---
I want battle royale lol
---
Where's that?
---
I think if they gave us more they’d mess with the RNG of it and give you more of what you don’t want...lol
---
I've noticed this before and went there when players were supposed to be there. Like someone else said it's the centre of the map and seems to be a conduit that people pass through when they are spawning in lol.
---
Snallygaster maybe?
---
Well then! If people are saying this over and over then they must all be crazy.
---
you can repair pieces you see are broken. I wish there was a repair all button tho, would make it easier.
---
Yeah, I have an assassins explosive .44 that’s been for sale at 500 caps for a while. I don’t think people are looking at its effects. I’m afraid to try it, lol. I shifted the perks to gunslinger and it does 184 damage a shot. 😏
---
....like between the tower and Greg's Mining Supply? Where the dirt path meets the creek?
---
I bought a Bloodied FFR DR while aiming Assault rifle for 1500 caps and it is amazing! Poor guy didn't realize what he had. Also building up my comic book collection
---
But it wasn't ever required until now
---
While I understand this game has a large pvp community, it should have never had pvp. Yeah it fits the style, but like with Destiny if they were to cater to PvP too much it will ruin the experience of PVE. Fallout games should stop at coop and not proceed to pvp. With the number of perks, legendaries, and combinations of all those, this game will forever be a PVE focus with an unbalanced PVP. PVP is an after thought, and I LOVE PvP in most games, but I never see it being fair or fun in this on.
---
Point is, play FO76 like a COOP-MMO and it’s the best game it can be, or probably just find a better PvP game. The second they focus on PvP as a whole, they lose their base community of single player and PVE’ers that their whole company stands on.
---
Lmao you’re just salty that you’re dumb and happened to get trolled. Turn on pacifist and they literally cannot harm you
---
The problem is that would mean it was easier to game the market. Daytraders and such like that. It would be more convenient, but could lead to annoying stuff.
---
I think because a lot of people don’t know how to tame them. You need animal friend and the animal has to be a random spawn and it has to spawn alone. So the death claws at deathclaw island aren’t tamable.
---
Same. I don’t lock up my whole camp. Just two small rooms I don’t want other people in.
---
If a rad storm gave you as much damage as a ghoul in rads that would change a lot alone!
---
*" If we wanted to play fortnite, we would play fortnite. Fuck that game and fuck battle Royale, NONE of us want a battle Royale in this game."* \- **Words of a true Prophet**
---
Yeah, that's where I got my inspiration from lol!
---
Is it the frog sound that is often heard near water? It's the only thing I've heard that sounds like that. I built my camp on the river just to hear them while I'm there.
---
Vendors.
---
What do you mean you people?
---
I'm just saying that criticism for the game is fair, and shouldn't be discredited.
---
The plans are in Raleigh Clay's bunker. Scrapping them gives you nothing, not even wood.
---
power armor doesn't have a competitive edge though. it only did in the beginning because no one had any armor.
---
I always catch Rad Worms from the first or second Whitesprings ghoul and then I have to start spamming Radaway for the rest of the fight.  Serendipity doesn't cancel rads... 
---
I hate Rad Worms.
---
What this guy said. I will kill it but if it's surrounded or entrenched in your camp I wont touch it as my explosive weapons will 9/10 times catch something else and then I will become wanted
---
What would you say are the "relevant perks" outside of the Heavy Gunners and One Gun Army, presumably?  I have a Bloodied Gatling Gun and I find myself using it more and more these days, such that I've basically switched over to Unarmed melee just to make room for the first rank of each Heavy Gunner perk.
---
Also, what are the rules behind the lockout timer?  I know I've seen a silo runner come across this in the past, and I had to launch the nuke for him.  It seemed like a real drag how you don't know about it until you reach the end of the silo.
---
Well he'd take this guy through, let him tag an enemy and finish them all off. This guy had been playing for a month when I met him and was already lvl 140, and claimed it was because of the big bend thing that they'd do a couple of times a play through.
---
Ok updated graphics and did a scan and repair 
---
Now loads but load screens taking agaves and when I span to a camp takes 3 or 4 mins for the camp to load ?
---
When I saw it I thought Bethesda was just putting a meme in.
---
Use neon letters and marquee arrows to make it even more noticable
---
you can't wear armor in power armor anyways
---
Is that even possible? Its hard to make a Legendary Drill MORE useless, lol.
---
You can milk the brahmin, and if you have butcher's bounty, farm the Brahmin for meat. Don't think it's intentional though, as he doesn't give meat regularly. If you have a steel extractor, razorgrain farm, and patience you could actually have a slaughterhouse in-game
---
all armors, and nothing. they're leg mods.
---
Xbox?
---
Yeah, I thought it was really funny
---
That’s a great shout, thank you
---
nice, thanks!
---
Assuming you haven't played since May 24th...
---
"Hi everyone,
---
We’re planning to release an update for the PC version of Fallout 76 today, May 24, to address an issue affecting an exterior lighting file. This will not require downtime, but PC players will need to download the update.
---
We used an incorrect lighting file when we released Patch 9.5 for PC earlier this week, and today’s update will address this by applying the file we had originally intended to implement. Unfortunately, this is not a small file, and PC players who have already installed Patch 9.5 will receive a download size of approximately 8.5 GB today.
---
However, as a result of this update, PC players who had not yet applied Patch 9.5 will have a much smaller download size once they do update to the latest version of the game.
---
Console versions of Fallout 76 are unaffected by this issue and console players who have installed Patch 9.5 will not need to download anything. Additionally, we are not making any gameplay changes, which means there will be no patch notes for this update.
---
Thank you for your patience and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause for those of you who had already downloaded Patch 9.5 on PC."

Thats probably what it is, I thought I was missing out on something
---
Yup.  I’ll be on tonight after 9 EST.
---
been in workshops since the beginning
---
Lol. What about Level 91 death claw that shows up at whitespring? That’s the one I want. Do you do player vending? Don’t people freak when they show up at your camp? Maybe open fire on it? 
---
Also, the perk card question. Does it need to stay equipped for the DC to stick around and still love you.
---
thanks!
---
88% upvoted which means, 12% of us , those who've probably put the most hours into this game and have all the gear and have grown tired of doing queen runs and farming legendaries DO WANT a better pvp mode. The title is false to begin with.
---
I always do. Unless...
---
Your camp is completely locked up tight like an asshole.
---
You have delusional multi-thousand cap prices for things you’re obviously not storing.
---
I wasted caps spawning to you repeatedly inside your walls or foundations, without being able to get out.
---
It’s not all on us. Some of the responsibility is on you.
---
me too prolly, username (Rogue Galaxy000) it honestly sounded cooler in my head. also no parenthesis
---
last brotherhood quest to kill the sbq guarantees it as a reward
---
I thought the bloodied on mine would get some attention...At 50% health with gunslinger, conc. fire and adrenaline I just vats the first targets head or legs then just one shot a whole mob.

I've had a turret appear in my camp during a time I never teamed with someone.

---
I usually play "the camp is lava" as soon as I'm able to move and before the camp fully materialize sometimes it helps with the getting stuck in foundation thing
---
No worries. Cores are one of those annoying things that are everywhere when you have them but nowhere to be seen if you haven't. Happy hunting anyhoo :)
---
I do this all the time....just for the fun of using something different and to burn some ammo from my stash. Its a lot more fun trying new stuff out, instead of getting hung up on a weapon cause its explosive
---
Oh you think I'd get banned because my opinion is different than yours?  How mature and progressive of you.  Unlike you and your 25000 karma, I don't live my life on Reddit however I did create this account to sell stuff from the game and to get whiny people like you lose your crap.  Still crying? 😂
---
Yeah geez man, didn't say I hate the game lol, I actually enjoy it, just that I'm not blind to the what I see in game.
---
I've heard it explained both ways, with respect to if the proc is all-or-nothing.  Based on my own playing, I feel like it probably is, because I think I would see my HP whittling more often if it were per-piece, rather than taking the large chunks when I do.
---
That or claim the workshops at posiden or thunder mountain. Both produce fusion cores at a pretty acceptable rate. I had thunder mountain claimed for a few hours one day and ended up with like, 30 fusion cores lol.
---
No no I get in trough windows or I lock pick to access the crafting bench.
---
I don't destroy anything I'm a gentlemen
---
Yeah, I wondered if somebody found a new way to get to it and just kept quiet aside from telling a few people.
---
I agree with this, I always wished there were at least like... "social faction hubs"
---
if you play a questline that leads to you becoming Brotherhood of Steel for instance in 76, then you get access to the BoS social location where you can team up with other faction members for stuff. If you do a questline to become a Raider in 76, you get access to the Raider social hub on the map and so on.
---
wait, how would you do that? and does it require tons of resources?
---
If you guys want another hole in the world, check out the roof of one of the VTU buildings, btw don't try it unless you have PA or bird bones.
---
Tbh I would love it
---
Nuclear winter seems as though it's going to change the Appalachian wasteland.  Maybe what your asking.
---
You don’t need to dig, just search.
---
Well that is fun. How does one learn to make mods for wood armor?
---
I say start the tadpoles quest to get your hands on a backpack first
---
That's the only one as far as I'm aware.
---
Poseidon Energy near Charleston. 1. Fusion Core often on table by power substation workshop. 2. Taking over workshop and Powering up Fusion Core processor (white machine) via a. Building a fusion core generator or b. Building ten of the 10 level regular generators or c. Fixing Poseidon Power plant and connecting direct to the substation terminal. Once Fusion Core Processor is powered it will generate 8 cores an hour. 
---
PS. This process works for every power plant in the game. Poseidon, Thunder Mountain, etc.
---
Thunder mountain power workshop has a fusion generator. Not a long quest to power up the plant once you figure out the layout. You can get 3 per hour. If you can't get it to work, adding a pylon seems to make the generator work, wierd glitch
---
I don't know about PvP, but the nerf makes PvE more fun because you can't be on total autopilot anymore.  I still think Sentinel is an objectively better effect than the rest, though.  I seem to have issues with Cavalier.
---
Just putting a generator down and connecting it to the fusion core making machine. Making sure you defend it when you have to. Make sure you lock it up so that other people don't come by and take your fusion cores. But no not really. If you can make the fusion generator that's plenty of power to it. The machine is already at the workshop.
---
Right next to the university. 
---
It's part of the nukashine quest
---
Run away from the camp, and go down somewhere away from the camp. If you respawn somewhere else, I think they disappear
---
I don't agree that they shouldn't exist. I've never used them in anything PvP, but my main weapons break easily so when doing things that require lots of shooting like a silo it simply means I don't have to travel back to my base just to fix my stuff.
---
How much can you gain buy selling water ? Is it that much ?
---
Yeah, I thought so too, or just somewhere your character is displayed upon fast travelling, but it seemed a little too much to the left to be the center. Seems like the most probable reason though
---
Thank you very much kind Dweller!
---
I'm afk spinning around inside a porta-potty as we speak.
---
Yes. It's safe without any perks
---
Dont need it
---
happened to me a couple of months ago, i had most of them as screenshots out of fear of this happening but now they can't appear as loading screens anymore. 
---
it sucks.
---
I'm hoping they will fix this and store it on the cloud or something, and give us more space to save it also. 50 is nothing
---
Noted
---
I felt the same annoyance towards the changes in VATS at first too, which is more avoidable than the food/drink depletion so I can see how it would be an annoyance. Personally, I downloaded one of the survival mods on FO4, which incurred it by choice, so am probably not the best sounding board for this. I like the added element of having to focus on the survival aspect instead of just the enemies and quests. I also thought I would hate the change to online play, but I wouldn’t have it any other way now.
---
Yeah, I thought it may have been that also
---
The one in the picture above?
---
They could add “40% less damage while blocking” or “90% Reduced weight “ to the drill... lol
---
Capture literally any Power Plant, then slap down a Fusion Generator next to the Core Generator that's there, and you'll be rolling in full charge cores in no time 👍much faster than doing the Powering Up event to restore power
---
It doesnt effect me. They dont exist to me lol
---
Nope.
---
Kiting spawned enemies is a way to damage player bases.
---
Agree with this guy, that’s my route to easy fusion cores. You get about 2 every 10 minutes or so.
---
My worst was stuck inside foundation next to Acid extractor that ticked me damage every second. Can't fast travel if you take damage.
---
When you first build the camp and place down the machine. Next to that spot is where your visitors will spawn. If you want customers plan and make camp so they can actually travel there.
---
Hey, check it out! [I can use google!](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/WWWP_Log_Ride_entry_10172077_daily)
---
Lol I can picture Bethesda taking this idea then allowing players to either sign up as bos or raiders and having team based pvp from it. And to satisfy the pve side of things they can add challenges to take pictures of the pvp.....
---
But being serious, I think your idea would be awesome, but to take it a step further I would like to see all that added as a 50+ server (and have the regular server still have scorched etc for people who come into the game new)
---
I'd like to see the purchase of Legendaries tied to a small refilling of the daily scrip pool, myself, like it is with the standard vendors.  Especially on weekends, I get into this trap where I'll deplete the scrip pool too early, or get blessed with heavy 3\* junk I don't need, but is too "costly" to scrap that day.  I always need to leave a little wiggle room for the proverbial Broadsider.
---
Id be ok with whatever as long as its not a cash grab for weapons.  Literally the only thing i hate about BR.
---
It does for Nuke Dark
---
Also, check around the Ash Heap. There are a few gens about and you can potentially get 3 at Camden Park and 3 or 4 at Mount Blair Trainyard.
---
Haha yeah! That would be sweet!
---
Or have it appear on our compass. On diablo 3. A star appears on the map when a rare item drops
---
They are not the boogeyman that was bitched about.  Even with the tweaks to remove oversmithing
---
I think I've got them for 500 and they still rarely sell...
---
Road to robco research in the mire, static sentry bot corpse that can be looted for a fc
---
Just a heads up, Wood Armor currently *only* comes in 1⭐ 
---
The ones distributed by the Purveyor are glitched, and lose all their extra properties when you log out.
---
Yup, but i think Bethesda had this before Apple :D
---
I once spawned in at a locked camp with a scorched inside wrecking shop.  Since he was only taking out benches and generators, all I could do was watch through the tiny window in the door.  
---
Luckily he had a turret outside so I could get his name and send him a message.  Also mentioned that players can no longer destroy camps, so he might want to leave it unlocked.  That way he could be helped next time.  Lol
---
Damn scorched got a lot down before the owner returned... lol
---
Weapon breaking at Scorched Earth/Project Paradise is my main use for them.
---
BETHESDA should go after Apple for this

---
Especially those guys who lock the water up...  Seriously its water ,it spawns quickly and who needs 50+ purified water
---
Changed since release and works perfect across all my games.
---
Look up The Divison 1 Survival mode BR. It's about as hardcore as it gets, but it's still technically a BR
---
Hahahah well that is super cool! Thank you for the heads up!
---
what you are missing is that every player is getting a free 25 AP bonus without rejuvenated when you keep up the thirst bar, rejuvenated only add another extra 25 AP. 
---
so with action boy/girl you get permanent 45 AP bonus
---
with rejuvenated you only get 25 when being well hydrated and 25 HP while being well fed
---
Check out a train station, or some players have a quest board but look at the posters that say "Pioneers want YOU" "Wanted: Sheepsquatch ate my brother" and "Party at Delta U" or whatever. These three quests are probably the best and give the most content. There's also some new side quests, some unmarked. The new interior dungeon Burrows at Harper's Ferry can be done any time going in, and the project paradise dungeon event at Arktos is only available sometimes. There's also some other boss level events, Encryptid for the Sheepsquatch and Free Range can be done at Freddy's BBQ, that's the best place for it. You have to look up a server hop guide for the camera
---
The purveyor is literally fallout 76 in npc from. Not a bad idea, but useless in the long run in execution, and we have to work around it and depend on the player community
---
So I guess that means they’ll be shipping soon then?
---
I tried that one. VATS missed, it hit the camp, Wanted bounty.
---
Yeah, we're supposed to be working together.  If you lock up your stuff like that, fuck your walls.
---
I think they took serum recipes out of the SBQ loot table a couple of patches ago, which doesn't make a lot of sense since they were so rare
---
And for something so that for instance where I have six cards for a three rank skill I can get rid of the excess cards in a trade in or do over the whole deck over.
---
And can we have profiles.  Say three.  so I can swiftly / simply move from a building set to a crafting set to an adventuring set without the chore and usual errors.
---
if your so annoyed by all way having to carry food or water just pick lead belly 3 and cannibal 3 since i done it i all most never carry any food or drink expect some dirty water
---
I do the same thing!  I’ve come back to my camp with mole rats or liberators attacking my camp while players are standing on my porch shopping all the time. Then my door will be wide open and my decon shower running. Have a little courtesy. I wouldn’t leave your camp like that, please don’t leave mine like that.
---
I think it’s a super cool idea that is impossible to implement. You have no idea how many gamer tags I have reported over the decades (and forced a change on). Look at the downvotes this will probably get as proof. Now try shouldering that responsibility of filtering gamer tags on PS4/Microsoft/whoever to that of character names on Bethesda. It’d be a shitshow.
---
The unfortunate reality is that you have to idiot proof things for the lowest common denominator, which is why we can’t have nice things. You’d just end up in an even worse world where we have a tidal wave of even for “fatchixrugly” or “anilraper”.
---
First time I came across the event, 2 cows died before I found them. The sheepsquatch shows up, third cow instantly dies
---
Yeah I've been awaiting mine too. Would be hilarious if when we got the replacements they were the same material lol 😂
---
they took replacement requests up until May 3rd.  Now they have a solid count on how many they need to replace I'm sure they looking for the cheapest  solution to source that amount.  Once made, they'll use the cheapest shipping method.  
---
So in other words, don't hold your breath
---
yeah, they should, and now Samsung had copied them as well :)
---
yea seems plausible to me. just did a quick google.
---
also it might be a good spot to place your camp
---
Bruh moment
---
I would prefer a bass boosted version
---
Hm. I think this might be fake. Can you post a video of it? Never in my 1000 hours have I seen a single tameable creature be legendary.
---
I have two TSE handmades that I'm looking to trade for a set of forest scout armor. What are the effects on yours? If interested that is lol
---
I used the site linked below. It shows the TSE with same stats weapons attacking Super Mutants does a little bit more dmg. If you don't have Explosive it does less dmg. So really, with that being said the TSE will be all around better if you are killing more than Mutants. 
---
 [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
So I'm dumb because some asshat shot explosive rounds from a distance? Before you insult someones intelligence learn how to read, pacifist mode clearly states other players can murder you, but I'll give you that yeah I'm salty, if dumbasses want yo murdee eachother why go after a dude with a camera?  FO76 is too full of cowards, I've had great interactions with like 3/4 of the people but then you have players like this.
---
I kill stuff attacking bases if they don't have everything locked. But if you have 8 water purifiers all level 3 locked then you're on your own.
---
I leave mine all open to be helpful. I remember how punishing the game can be, especially if low level. I leave my garage open and the porch light on. I think my let snallygaster may be scaring some off tho :o
---
I wish... this is the first Fallout in which factions are completely meaningless.
---
hmmm, ok
---
I seen a lot of posts where guys say don't use turrets, that's silly imo. A lot of turrets and a couple spotlight turrets are needed if you want to run the gen all the time. 
---
The key is to put the gen in it's own house outside the main base. You can build security wall(s) around it to stop the pot shot guys. I don't bother though, those walls look like hell. If it blows, least the main base is good. You can store and lay items back down to repair too. I do this with the rad shower time to time. The generator I let blow, it's kind of cheap to repair. The vendors cost flux too. The only thing I really want is a way to repair walls like you can turrets with the home defense perk. Currently you can disarm the ones that are damaged and then repair them to full all at once using contractor at camp. Walls you have to wait until they're destroyed.
---
That be nice though I do have to agree that the game needs other things addressed first. 
---
However if the Wastelanders DLC in the Fall actually brings human NPCs, then I hope Appalachia Radio finally gets a DJ
---
You need to pay the licencing rights to add music to any comercial thing (game,video, tv...) so, maybe this is the reason they didnt add more music...
---
Fricking burned em
---
*facepalm* Are you even reading or only writing?
---
At least google what is "The customer is always right"... Here you go:
---
"The customer is always right" is a motto or slogan which exhorts service staff to give a high priority to customer satisfaction.
---
Shows how much you know about or how you worked in retail... And considering your communication skills, I don't see any decent experience you gained from that work.
---
If someone comes to your camp and makes a mess, YOU will still have to deal with it, no matter how much you write. So just deal with it! Start solving the issue from the root, not from the other end.
---
Uranium Fever can be a good event. I got three 3* Mole Miners spawn on that event.
---
Jesus dude (Baron, assuming gender), Trapper and weightless are instant throwaways for me, and I infuriatingly get them constantly. Wish we knew each other.
---
I help out as well. Especially turrets...I get those back and running if I buy something or not. I’m usually at or near the storage limit anyway...alleviates some of my junk hoarding issues.
---
Until everybody and their mom comes here bitching because they fell for a trap. People here complain to much for a demand like this to be taken seriously. You guys bitched hard and got player-damage safe bases in Adventure. Deal with the consequences of your demand.
---
Ii bet your gear sucks so bad that you can't defend yourself hence why u dont like pvp, its ok little boy, stay in adventure, stay in passive mode, and when we take your workshop just tuck your tail and run. We know your type. Go decorate your camp with pet rocks and brag to your friends that you're getting good at this game.
---
Middle finger emote for those certain people. Please
---
you know reusing assets is pretty common in triple a game if they were to make unique texture for everything a huge game could easily take many month or even a year more to develop
---
If you need them to repair you're equipment normally.  then your definitely playing the game wrong.
---
I've gotten several as a reward and use them for my backup PA sets I craft to save springs otherwise. Through normal game play you should have enough mats to repair you're armor if you have fix it good, and if you're stuff breaks like crazy use White Knight.
---
But they are definitely not even close to PTW, when other games literally sell exp, dmg buffs etc. Or limited time OP legendary weapons and armor that break the game etc etc.
---
What weapons are best against the alpha. I have played many high level event these past months. Been busy hoarding the wasteland in other areas.
---
I am so sick of these stupid weapons.  Especially since I don't have one.
---
exactly!!!!!!! I have so much extra junk. I repaired turrets last night and some mobs came right up and ruined them in front of me lol, so I repaired again and forgot i was running low on steel trying to do the camera film challenge looking for crystal.
---
Yes 40,60 and 80% chance.

are there murmurs that human NPCs are coming with Wild Wastelanders?

I am so tired of this weapon.  Everyone except for me has one for some reason.
---
I thought they removed agroing another play by shooting there camo? 
---
That's worrying
---
oh no doubt, I know it's not a free and easy process!
---
great write down, if people follow this she will always go down :)
---
Must admit that i cant hold myself, i do take pot shots at here in the air with my gatling laser, it's just so fun, lol
---
Nukacrypt.com has all of the codes each week
---
 For me is not a big deal, it helps a bit (especially if u run energy guns), btw i run the SBQ yesterday and got 5 improved repair kits in one run, so, there´s no point to buy the basic repair kit in Atom shop.
---
Well said dude. Chose the mode you want but don't hate on a mode u don't have to use. A new pvp mode would help relieve some of the frustration from grown ass men who want to play for real caps and defend their bases. None of this invicible base garbage with less caps than killing a mole miner crap.
---
&gt;I think we can all agree that they shouldn’t exist in the game. 
---
Disagree.  They're fine.  They were always fine.  People were in an uproar over nothing.
---
Sniping or melee is good for Instigating. Found a fresh appreciation for melee I didn't have before when I was given a nice sledge hammer from a friend so added melee to my combat.
---
I use my vendors to safely store items from scrapping until display cases come out.
---
Note sure what they’re thinking with bites, though.
---
Thank you! Someone who agrees! I come from RPGs like Runescape where they actually sell exp for actual money. That’s pay to win. I’m glad to see someone who isn’t freaking out about it.
---
No. What is that? People firing spikes into the door frame?
---
Right now it is just an assumption. Todd Howard did say though that Wastelanders will dramatically change the game.
---
i see this a lot lol.   at WS people will just dump the 1 stars on the ground.  but ive yet to find the combo
---
I think that 1 and 2 actually happen when the SBQ simply tries to find a valid space to land.  When she does, she will typically circle the area and gain elevation, and then come down.  Sometimes, she struggles to find a valid space because there are players and enemies all over the field, and it's possible for her to miss this landing interval if she can't find one.  I believe that's when she appears to get stuck in midair until her AI decides on something else to do.
---
And we know your type. Instead of trying to convince me I’m wrong, you assume I suck. As I’ve stated, this game should never have had PvP. It’s a multiplayer version of a single player, PVE focused franchise.
---
If you come into this game with your attitude then you’re a dumba$$. Literally ANY game that is PvP oriented or any MMO with a minute focus on PvP provides a much better experience. And in this game PvP is an afterthought only thrown in to attract people like you. 
---
Now go tell your mom that you used her computer without her permission again so you can get grounded. Let the big boys have actual discussions here.
---
I got the backpack skin. Is it rare?
---
I'm sad that i can only upvote this comment once. These kids cry cry cry so much that people who do want to fight are irritated af with the current modes to begin with. Finally some hope for a real fight and this god damn post soars into oblivion. Go install sims 4 if u dont want a fight.
---
I don’t believe that one is tamable, but you also have to be twice the creatures level. And they do lol, but I’m in passive and in adventure they can’t harm it. So they was a magazine and then go about buying items lol.
---
You only need the card equip when taming, once it has been tamed you can remove h card.
---
That’s A ok:) if you want to spend money to support the game more power to you! This was just about that repair kits don’t effect the game at all.
---
I can’t tell if your actually honest or your referencing the sprite cranberry meme
---
Yeah you'll lose the caps. Had this happen to a buddy twice now. Make sure you lock your vendors if you're at max caps or depower them
---
yes
---
You going to pay me for it? If not I'll lead them to all your valuables
---
I usually kill what I see for the free exp and ammo. 
---
That being said, on the other side of the coin, I have 4 missile launchers and a couple 5.56 turrets to help my customers have a pleasant shopping experience. Repair’s to my camp are a price of doing business, I just add the overhead to my sale items.
---
Omg they are EVERYWHERE NOW!!!
---
But we need to complain about it for YouTube “content.” “Slippery slopes” and all that
---
Exactly! Glad to know people agree :)
---
Thanks I've yet to try that, but I expect it'll be over before I get there given it's popularity
---
Omg everywhere!  Every server I hope onto I get shot up by explosive laser rifles!
---
Like wtf are people getting out of these story line quests anyways, they're painful, lame, uninteresting, mind numbing and over with in a day after a month of waiting. This seems to satisfy the general population and leave the hardcore players to twiddle their thumbs like 5 hours after patch its back to business as usual.
---
Yes even if they are not powered people can still but stuff and essentially throw away the caps. So if your at cap limit just remove the items from the shop completely.
---
(Or you can do what i did and make it so your shop (as in the whole store building) will shut off when you want it to) so people cant get into your shop or access the vending machines when you dont want them to
---
I understand that you’re saying that the slogan is the “customer is not always right”; however, the REALITY of the situation is much different than the slogan suggests. You thinking that no matter what you want or do is right simply because the slogan says you are right as a customer doesn’t negate the fact that your actions wouldn’t be accepted on any other level. In a game like this where there are no corporate giants to please, no one is buying your “my actions are justified because of a USA slogan”. Throwing around personal insults because you don’t know how to debate any other way shows more about your character than anyone else’s. Communication takes two.
---
Well, I can't help with the Scorchbeasts, but my Legendary route is basically following the highway from the Watoga substation clear up to Haven Church in the Mire.  Sidetracking into the General's Steakhouse, Harper's Ferry, and the Mire substation.
---
Some days, it will only be like 1-3 Legendaries.  Other days, it will be absolutely bonkers and I'll hit like 10 of them.  I believe there are about a dozen different potential spots along this route.
---
It's a twofer
---
Dude they are being used everywhere!  It's like the new weapon of choice
---
The (old) market price was 1 cap per 1% charge. Fully charged = 100 caps. There’s no real set price now.
---
So like build a wall around the vending machines when I do not want people purchasing? Thank you
---
new recommended quest line: one similar to the brewery quest except for its a milk machine and a workbench that produces baby bottles so all the little babies can actually have something to suck on.
---
I clean up the spawns with two exceptions. If your items are absurdly expensive (like thousands for serums and shitty legendaries) or if your spawn point is inside your level three locked house and there's no way for me to get out other than fast travel.
---
It's about sending a message.
---
I think it is 58 gig
---
“Oh my god Bethesda did it again!!! Can we get 20k likes on this video please?!? *crying emoji*”
---
I'm on xbox so i usually play pandora in the background.
---
I'm surprised, I feel like fallout 76 has some pretty nice players compare to other games *cofcof**gta* *cof* *cod* people are helping each other and are civil of course there are some exception like the battle horny players 
---
I get your point of view except the whole 
---
Imagine if irl they asked the same thing,this is a game not real life. I kill thousands of diferent species in games but in real life I wouldn't even be able to kill a damn mouse just like I wouldn't force myself in anyone's home 
---
Plus in game we're fellow vault dwellers we should help eachother
---
&gt;a sample size of 3 is not enough to determine anything
---
Exactly, but if you save up 500-1000 and then spend all of it (like we did when the Purveyor went live) we might see some sort of behaviour/pattern. All I can say is it doesn't *seem* completely random, as there isn't an even spread of weapons and legendary effects, based on my own 3 sets of 20 2\* weapon rolls. 
---
There could be a tiered system of favorable to non-favorable weapon/legendary effects. It would make sense for Bethesda to do that, otherwise we would end up with a lot more trash causing players to ignore the Purveyor altogether. 
---
I'm saving up scrip so I can have at least 10 2\* weapon rolls one after the other. My strategy will be, if I get 2 bad rolls in a row, I will either wait another day or server hop and retry. If I get a good roll (eg. a B25 rfile, QE rifle) I will keep going until my scrip runs out, just as an experiment, to see if my remaining rolls are favorable or not. If I run out of scrip because every roll is a bad one, then so be it.
---
I love this idea, keep up the awesome fellow wastelanders.
---
ah, that's probably why.. I've yet to face the SBQ.
---
PS, there’s [a whole website](www.notalwaysright.com) dedicated to customers who think they’re right in the same way you think it should work.
---
This one has there shit together!!!!!
---
It your boi.......Tap,smash or slam that like button, don’t forget the bell notification.👨‍💻
---
White Powder Winter Sports is near the origin of the world, so a number of things default to that position before being shifted properly.
---
I think all the magazine locations now have a random magazine rather than fixed.
---
I have 24 of them, 100%, for 50 caps a piece and no bites at all. It's not hard to get them yourself, more time consuming than anything, and possibly dealing with assholes.  
---
I always just leave fusion core generators and any resource generators unlocked at a workshop so other people can take stuff too. I can't use all of it anyway, or else I end up needing to sell my fusion cores because I have like 70+ and they weigh too damn much.
---
I'm concerned with all these whispers of Battle Royale in Nuclear Winter. probably the last thing this game needs haha
---
I automatically ignore anything 3 star over 1000 caps. Maybe, *MAYBE* if it’s a specific godroll my husband and I are looking for, we’ll go up to 1,500.
---
These delusional multi-thousand cap prices only get a puke emote.
---
I also do this on occasion, Spotify though.
---
look up the group "Mammal Hands" on Pandora/Spotify
---
good jazz and similarly good artists that fit the game rather well
---
i little bit of info even
---
The wastelanders dlc will be what you want, nuclear winter is something you don't even have to play.
---
Try starting both the excavator quest and the mysteries quest.  
---
IMHO, in the 30’s, you should probably be in the ash heap.
---
Parts of Roses quest (the top of the world one you are working now)  will take you to places you should likely not be quite yet.
---
Your L6 friends should stay in the forest until at least L15, then go to toxic valley.
---
There are events in Grafton and Morgantown you both can do.
---
Damn, that would take 5 days on my 5mbps internet
---
Yeah i heard spotify is better. Creature of old habits i guess.
---
Thanks I'll try that and see what I find
---
His side of the story https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg4npBloVZw
---
Yes, for example i built a powered door into my shop and then wired it to a room that was off limits (basically a junction room for my generator) so when i shut off the switch to it the whole building powers down and closes the doors so no one can enter the building unless i let them.
---
&gt;Far Harbor  
---
&gt;Nuka World  
---
&gt;pitiful  
---
lol okay
---
the the new meta until it isn't
---
I’ve bought them multiple times at 500 each, and have passing on them since at...500 each.
---
Need help finding where to stand to get the picture of the Nee River George Bridge
---
I use my Blood Gatling Gun for everything and after
---
5 seconds in combat I can kill anything in 4 shots or less.
---
When i fight meelee enenmy like ghouls or ants i switch to my Blood Deathclaw guantlet i am not melee user but it can kill anythibg in no more than 5 swings
---
Exactly, so it's wasted weight. Backpacks up your carry weight but it means less when you need 20-50lbs of armor
---
I've never really gotten into the building aspect so that sounds a little complicated Haha, thank you for the advice I'll build a wall around them
---
It doesn't take the lowest one that's for sure. And core aren't fully used it seems even in 500 or 999 ammo so get ready to have a bunch of 10-15% cores left.
---
How about you stop chasing caps and play the game?  Greed is not good.
---
wow, what a great idea. sounds like a lot of fun if you're with people who can police themselves and play by the rules.
---
I'm assuming mutations like Speed Demon are fair game?
---
*and bone jelly* ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)
---
That's weird
---
Gunslinger is a blast to play.  While it’s possible to get more DPS out of a sneak rifle build or commando build, gunslinger has its own unique play style.  After hitting a certain level aIl ready had ranks 1 and 3 of both commando and rifleman.  I was tired of sneaking around as a rifleman, and I was only using commando for boss mobs and is drained ammo.  
---
Looking through my stash I stumbled upon an explosive single action revolver.  While the western is much better, I still kind of like the challenge of managing the single action.  I had quite a few unused levels so I started taking gunslinger.  
---
I found I could vats for days and deal decent damage, with no sneaking using a combination of gunslinger,  it’s a very mobile build.  Concentrated Fire, glow site, gun runner (a great perk), adrenaline, gun fu, demo expert, nerd rage,  bloody mess, crit savvy, and better crits.  
---
Most of my pistols currently do between 270 and 300 damage.  I will also say the quad Western Revolver is amazing.
---
Yeah I've noticed that with nuke zones before. Thanks for the info!
---
Awesome. I’m so doing this! Do you know if wasteland whisperer does the same but different creatures?
---
Yup...   
---
Was on a Server where someone had done that @ every train station, was "awesome".
---
Well, hope they'll fix it soon.
---
Indeed they are!
---
Both!!
---
If it played like pubg, start off with nothing and collect gear. Disable vats. I know this post is a troll but it would be fun!
---
lol that is one way to resolve the issue!
---
I like em
---
Well if paired with power armor you won't notice it. But power armor is fairly pointless for a gatling laser build.
---
lol     
---
Lol sorry for the confusion!
---
Turrets or pretty camp. You have to accept that.
---
Huh?
---
The bigger question is why is razorgrain flour require cement? Lolol
---
Do you have one?
---
I've found that some people don't realize what items are the real money makers.
---
For example, I have a set of plans for the Marine Tactical Helmet that took me six weeks of camping to get at their span location.  $1,400 caps a day selling those helmets, and it's even easier since the vendors now share a cap pool.
---
Yeah though stabilized does give more accuracy for my Gatling plasma
---
That is a good one but another topic 😂
---
I would happily accept the occasional trap camp in exchange for FT mats!
---
Pardon?
---
That seems valid for the first day or so, but after that people should have some idea what they're doing. I would think, anyway. 
---
I didn't even know there was an elevator the first few times I did this event, cause I "join event" from the map and just end up inside.
---
Hey, now. They’re a genius bad-ass. Try to be impressed. I think that’s how we’re supposed to feel.
---
Yeah a bloody one. Love it but it sure does degrade faster than my other weapons so I don't use it a whole lot
---
That's not even a texture.
---
I haven’t experiment with it, but that’s my understanding. Supposedly it allows you to tame super mutants.
---
Happy to help
---
*facepalm again* its... a... slogan... It means providing high customer satisfaction, which obviously you do not do in your camp, ppl come to trade and get attacked and you don't provide protection to them.
---
Any place with lot of mutants - grafton steel, the pennetentary, wade airport, WV lumber....
---
From Charleston, go to the blue mining HQ building and clear it top to bottom, then go to riverside manor and pick up the mysteries quest line.  From there, to the SE corner of the ash heap to start the excavator quest.
---
Go into the ash heap by way of the tall towers you see after you pick up the excavator quest.
---
Both of you are acting childish. In The Division 1 the PvP battleroyalesque DLC (Survival) was actually fun. And they added a PvE mode! I can see Bethesda doing something similar. The balance on the first The Division was inexistent, but the PvP in Survival was the best.
---
I wouldn't mind them either if I had one too lol
---
Update. Retested today. Small notes first:  
---
Reset timer is definitely 10 seconds.  
---
Missing the target does not reset the stacks.  
---
Shooting the target with a different weapon does not cause loss of stacks (as long as you stay within the 10 second timer).  
---
Still haven't done the multitarget / target swap test.  
---
I went to the poor Behemoth again. This time I included Tank Killer (reducing dmg reduction from 150 to 96), and used sneak attacks. Trying to get bigger numbers, to reduce rounding errors.  
---
Stacks | Calc 5% | Tested
---
----------|----------|----------
---
0 | 86 | 84
---
1 | 92 | 90
---
2 | 98 | 96
---
3 | 104 | 102
---
4 | 111 | 108
---
5 | 117 | 114
---
6 | 123 | 120
---
7 | 130 | 127
---
8 | 137 | 133
---
9 | 143 | 140
---
10 | 150 | 140
---
11 | 157 | 140
---
12 | 164 | 140  
---
So, it looks like 5% damage per stack, with a 9 stack maximum is correct - as posted by /u/jaj22. It was observed more than once that shots #1 and #2 did the same damage, as if stacking sometimes gets delayed by one shot.  
---
Returning with multitarget test later ... maybe not today. Work and stuff.
---
How long have you had your dc?
---
Lockout is three hours
---
I may be wrong but it almost sounds like the audio you get when you complete the mayor for a day quest and at the end it gives you the safe code for the safe. I originally couldn't hear the whole message cause I had a scorchbeast screaming at me at the time of completion
---
You do realize that "Nuclear Winter" is not just one thing? Seriously, Wild Appalachia was not just Nukashine or not just sheepsquache. Vault 51 is a multiplayer vault that tests tribal instincts and runs fights which focus on survival of the fittest, but that is not all there is to the update. There is so much more so just settle down and sit tight.
---
if you're lucky you can have 3 at Camden's park (1 power armor, 2  Fusion generator ) or 2 at  the Mount Blair Trainyard (1 power armor and 1  Fusion generator ).
---
No then in 1 month everyone and their grandma have Bloodied explosive weapons and everyone is oneshotting everything
---
Okay I didn’t know about the game mechanic but I have very little trouble. I get 3 super mutants at most, always level 5.
---
Maybe I should rephrase then: move your camp to somewhere less damaging because the most I’ve ever had to do is repair a single wall.
---
I'll get around to explore testing sometime this weekend - not sure if I've got anything muled, otherwise I might just give you a shout :)
---
You should be able to get one pretty easy now that they don't cost 60k lol. I think I paid 10k for mine a week or so ago. Absolutely demolishes everything.
---
Its not someone else's problem. Maybe he thought your camp was ugly.
---
I coul prefer some like The Division's DLC: Survival. Not a Battle Royale but very close.
---
What have I got that's worth keeping behind a lock? I've got more purified water than I could ever drink, my STASH is private by design, and all I'm gonna be stopping anyone from is a bed and some workbenches.
---
Lots of self centered item hound players since the purveyor showed its ugly face.
---
Gotta get that sought after item....forget actually playing the game .....
---
Pellets do all sort of weird things ... will find out when I stumble over one :)
---
Everything you just listed still pales in comparison to the launch of this game. Did either of those games share other players names, addresses, and credit card info like fo76 did?
---
nice, yea I heard about Mt Blair, but I server hopped but couldn't find a core in a generator. But I will try Camden's park when I get the chance.
---
Tried this. You cannot de-prime a 50cal
---
Wonder if thats a bug or not?
---
...and a lotta FT with the Scout badge challenges...
---
I do the same thing. Be the change you want to see in the wasteland.
---
The definition of "autism".
---
Looks like 9 hits / 5% per each is spot on (see new test somewhere in this thread). Still got the multitest to go. Don't think I have any of the other guns, but will see if I can get my hands on one.
---
Oh...it's possible you have a perk card called Pannapictagraphist or Percepti-Bobble. I would hear that rubber band twang sound and could never figure it out....until I picked up a bobblehead.
---
The improved ones take up my stash space, since I keep getting them from scorched earth/encryptid and I never use them yet I can't sell them to players and I don't have the heart to toss them away
---
&gt; Also, in a video about Anthem, they showed a top 50 list of games by current players, and 76 was there. In the 40's, but not deserted like you make it out to be.
---
That is impossible for them to know as bethesda has been extremely tight lipped on the player base for this game unlike all their previous games. That in itself is very telling that they won't announce the player numbers.
---
How heavy are they?
---
You can easily check the info yourself as the files are on your computer as well if you play the game on the PC. Numerous people have verified that the files are indeed there and say what everyone is saying they say.
---
I think only .1 each, but that adds up when you get a couple per event
---
That happens to me too. Even if I'm around they'll sometimes go outside just to watch me kill them.
---
It’s also super important for at least one person to have the perks “Enforcer” or “One Gun Army” to keep her grounded once she lands by crippling her wings.
---
I’m making a list of the names and what the stars mean on all the scout armor I have since it’s all different. I have about 20+ pieces and will have the list done later today... I’ll keep you posted!
---
When the frogs die, you turn them into dogs.  Waste not want not in the wasteland.
---
Sweet. Appreciate it man!
---
"Somebody boo this man!"
---
I'm so glad someone else is willing to call out Skyrim for being the dudebro RPG it is. That game is responsible for a large portion of the genre going to hell.
---
Ignorant question: why would anyone bother with the double barreled shotgun?
---
This isn’t a criticism disguised as a question, it’s a sincere question. My husband and I couldn’t quite figure out why someone would choose one over the other. I have a legendary double barrel, but am not sure if I should keep it. It seems like the same damage as a combat or pump, just slower. Are we missing something?
---
They stay around until they are killed, I’ve had this one for a couple RL weeks now. The last one lasted about as long.
---
Why are you so selfish? Basically you are saying screw people who want it.
---
awesome! i have seen people come to the camp, do nothing and then just kill the cow and leave. wtf???
---
Yeah, it would be nice if you could click on their camp unit and select "repair all" like at your own camp. Until that happens I just repair the obvious things like busted turrets and smoldering resource collectors.
---
I want a battle royale
---
I run through the clubhouse from the back up the stairs and bring them outside... works like a charm!
---
i wish that too - at least repair all you can afford. I can't even repair a decon shower myself so I can't repair for others *but* I'd like to repair everything I can at any rate.
---
Brother is correct.  I’m met a couple of people playing bloodied.
---
The question for you is do you want to wait to find that person (or that person to find you).
---
The last guitar sword I saw did 120, so its not that bad for some critters (and its fun weapon, but thats another story).
---
You can always put it in your vending machine for a while and see what happens,
---
Do events and just walk around and explore, find new locations on your map. Do daily quests, craft, cook and scrap.
---
i bought a TSE .50 cal that was primed and had to revert it because i didnt know the plan and couldnt craft ammo for it, i didn't have problems reverting it so im not sure about it being bugged
---
Gonna guess you’re Gen X since you know what Spin City is, so....fist bump.
---
Situation? Situation is:
---
-Your wasting time and resources repairing your camp after mobs spawn by your customers.
---
Solution #1:
---
- Ask 0,01% of gaming community to kill the mobs, so waste time and resources of all customers visiting your camp.
---
Result #1:
---
Nothing changes.
---
Solution #2:
---
Build turrets.
---
Result #2:
---
Issue resolved. Players come to trade in your camp and do not waste time on non-trade related stuff like killing mobs.
---
Yup! I’ve gotten different mags at same locations and many of the same locations now have changed.
---
Imagine a BR made by bethesda, with fo76 gunplay...thats why nobody wants that.
---
I have noticed that there are 3 spots that I spawn, when travelling to my own camp. I swap between those three, seemingly at random... but it is ALWAYS those three. 
---
Perhaps moving the CAMP-thingy is the current workaround.
---
He admitted he was in the wrong and has long-since changed his views
---
Isk how far you are in the story but she isn't. She was killed by Mole Miners, I think.
---
I know but that just seems dumb, what we name are character should matter
---
Think of it this way: Its about capacity, not weight. The game just uses weight as a way to contextualize how much you can carry. Like, sure, power armour can carry a lot of weight, but how are you going to pick it all up and actually hold it? There's no storage! Now, a pack? you can just throw everything in there and hold it on your back, a much more efficient way to hold many items, therefore allowing you to carry more. See what I mean?
---
Nah, the devs just want to to participate in the endgame content so they make it worth doing by letting it have relevant stats to endgame(i.e power armour)
---
I've just primed my 50 cal and now the menu wont let me select receiver. So perhaps it is bugged?
---
I do it if ur shits way overpriced.  800 caps for stable flux? I’m having ribeye on the house.
---
But it's not, juice head and others have played the data mined audio files in videos
---
I melee gutsies.  Get in close and swing at their appendages, not their bodies.  Takes them out pretty quick.
---
Yep, a lot of things in this game disgust me
---
Not in my experience. I can let my turrets kill all by themselves. And then I go outside and loot. I don't know what to tell you. It works for me.
---
Oh these boos are going more rampant then a ghost house in super mario
---
Are there any other leg mods good enough to be considered or is it pretty much just these dominating the market?
---
Thank you for this succinct explanation.
---
&gt;I think they took serum recipes out of the SBQ loot table a couple of patches ago, which doesn't make a lot of sense since they were so rare
---
They did, during the same patch where they add the ultracite PA plans to the BoS terminal, which makes no fucking sense. Take out one of the rarest and most desirable drops, and then make the second best drops irrelevant by adding them into the game for free.
---
A fully upgraded double barrel does more damage per shot than the combat and pump action shotgun which is offset by the small ammo capacity. However, with the quad barrell it gets the same ammo capacity as a combat shotgun but more damage which makes it a pretty decent weapon.  
---
In overall damage output over time the pump action and combat shotguns are better however.
---
Well if you give me the things you are happy with, meaning what weapon, prefix, and major effect id be happy to calculate the odds for you.
---
Now when it comes to computers random does not really exist. We have a seed upon which we generate numbers. Assuming same seed and same algorithm you will get the same numbers in the same order.
---
We dont know how bethesda gets its seed, is it crar/account unique, or how often its refreshed, and its near impossible to reverse engineer without quantum computers in a reasonable amount of time.
---
So even if server hopping works for you, we still wont know jack untill we average everthing out.
---
Did it work?
---
Well we don't know how it's going to be implemented, I think it's likely to be small scale geographically and player count wise.
---
It's been proven over and over that the base drain of food and thirst meters is exactly the same since beta. If it is draining faster, it's because you're using it faster. There's no other explanation. There's several ways you can impact your drain.
---
I’ve been saving up scrip (at close to 500 now maybe?) and never once visited the vendor. I’m also a social scientist that appreciates this sort of thing. How high does the community want me to go?
---
Never having visited the vendor before may remove any “first time luck modifier” or some other hidden confounding variable. Although there obviously may be others. I should already have enough to get some sort of bell curve if any pattern exists.
---
Anyone?
---
For the time being, concrete foundations don't seem to have that problem. Build with stone!
---
Tip:  When I get stuck in foundations on camp fast travels I call out my Power armor and then enter the power armor. It's drop range is usually outside of the foundation walls and the animation of you getting into the armor is enough distance to get you out of a jam !
---
If you are the camp owner  and notice people are getting stuck in a particular spot repeatedly, you can place a chair above, below or outside of the trouble spot. People can then sit in the chair and the sitting animation will bring them out of the stuck zone.
---
They have just as much of a right to be there as I do.
---
Solo?
---
Or a millenial european, we got reruns of spin city on late night tv all the time in the early 2000s
---
I'm a little out of the loop is nuclear winter confirmed BR?
---
Sadly, i was horrified when i found out that i am actually classified as a milenial.....
---
In the words of the great maxwell smart from get smart "missed it by that much"
---
...uh yikes. that poor cow. dude didn't buy anything though, just came and killed the cow then left. it's gross they let people destroy cows that should be included in camp immunity.
---
but like if you don't like the prices go elsewhere.
---
You had to hit him back. Sorry you messed up 🤷‍♂️
---
Extra XP or caps for helping a fellow vault dweller out would be a nice addition to this great game. 
---
Please Bethesda... purty please?
---
lmao 25k Karma over 6 years and you think it's a lot? Wow. No I don't think you get banned because you have a different opinion, I think you get banned because you are moron. Did you delete your comments because you are weak, or was poor little you disciplined like the child you present yourself as? Either way my perception of you has been confirmed. I'd say welcome to Reddit, I doubt you will be around long.
---
could be, try logging off and in again and see if you still cant
---
Indeed, but how it is now is bad too, it’s very difficult to sell in empty servers for example..... or filled with high lvl players.
---
Yes perfectly fair exchange. Pick some veggies from the garden, get some water or cook a meal. Helping prevent damage to rad showers or fusion generators etc that’s not a cheap repair bill.
---
But the nuke holotape only spawns after a player nukes a non SQB target, which suggests she is alive to see it happen. I’ve heard that mole miner holotape, is that added later in the game too?
---
Example: if you were on a server where no one nuked anything yet, would you find her death holotape? And if you did, would the Nuke holotape still spawn after a player decides to nuke something else?
---
Clown faction best faction.
---
That also needs to be addressed. Clicking repair all and finding out I'm unable to do so because I'm missing a tato is infuriating. Sure, I can waste 30 seconds finding and manually scrapping that tato, *and then* repair all, but changing it to "repair everything possible" would be a nice QoL time saver.
---
I would be so glad. Game feels lonely.
---
That can’t be true. I finished the quest months ago and killed the queen many times since then. Still have never got it.
---
You know there are more battle royale games than just Fornite right?
---
Scan no 
---
Turning settings down to medium yes 
---
But still slow but not crashing :)
---
There's plenty of us that would love any type of PvP mode, stop acting like DLC is limited, if you don't want to play a battle royal mode then don't, I'm sure they're coming out with plenty of pve content just like they have been.
---
The release of a mode that isn't story driven or anything of the likes does nothing to harm the game as whole, only give more options and outlets for those enjoying the game. Not to mention Wastelanders is going to be the big Story update so just wait for that
---
I really do like this game but at this point if simple mechanics are still glitching and breaking, how in world is this game going to handle a Battle Royale mode?!
---
I don't mind it having one because I can simply ignore it. You're right though that it is the last thing the game needs because I think Battle Royale in Fallout 76 is equal to building a glass house on an earthquake fault line lol
---
I my self moved farrr north west I never get bothered by anybody.
---
You must not have played at launch then. When you picked up a holotape it wouldn’t play. I went through half the main story without hearing a single holotape play. Had to make a second character to actually listen to the story.
---
Oh I would love to see a 50+ player Server... maybe when we get private servers. I wish I was talented enough to make this a mod as well :(
---
Facepalm 🤦
---
I think all of us that play games like this have no desire for battle royale. I'm quite sick of it. Everyone is doing it and it's so over played. It's like the zombie thing a few years back. Every damn game had zombies or a zombie mode. Stop following lame ass fads and come out with real, significant games and game add ins.
---
Yup 😁 if you do it with the Contractor perk on too the fusion generator barely even costs anything. Grab it on a server where you plan to hang out for a while, and just go empty the Cores Generator every half hour or so. Just remember to set up some walls/turrets to protect the Genny, and be sure to lock it to deter passers-by from grabbing your cores (or don't if you're feeling generous lol).
---
"press X to doubt" 
---
Sorry, but I'm pretty pessimistic about it how nuclear winter will turn out and as far as the story goes, new fallout games havent been anything to phone home about.
---
You can repair other people's stuff when it's broken? I'll keep that in mind.
---
Tldr; turn it on and play.
---
One can assume they glow from radioactivity and no longer from bioluminescence.
---
RL?
---
It would be different for about a month, then the people who had time to put in will be dominating the casual players again. And we are back where we started, except the very limited people with actual god tier drops will be untouchable by anybody else.
---
Dupers evened the playing field, even if it sucks and we don't want to admit it, TSE wouldn't have been nerfed, and people would still be complaining.
---
It's a timed event, it doesn't run out faster if there are more people. Often there will be 5 people in there, but it's rare to have more than that.
---
It hasn't been but it's common as far concerning challenges.
---
Also super duper perk isn't counting.
---
Happy crafting!
---
 I bought both the chest servos plan and the calibrated shock plan from a bot vendor @ WS.  
---
They were generic, not labeled for a specific armor type.
---
I went to the nearest PA station and applied the torso servos to excavator, T51, and T60.
---
The calibrated shock option also appeared for every PA type I have...but alas, I lack the violet flux...
---
So is that 6 total strength or more with Party Boy + Nuka Nut?
---
Yeah I did try to add it, but not sure if you'll get the notification. Just reply if you do come on today. I'm avail for about 4-5hrs :)
---
I've killed a few legendary enemies while approaching other people's camp. So it's a win/win, especially if you get them before they start attacking the other person's camp.
---
I'm pretty sure I read somewhere you have to be twice the creatures level to be able to tame it. Are you at least level 161?
---
Wait what did they do with the ultracite PA plans? I thought they've been free since launch when you finish the BOS questline, but you could get copies from SBQ to sell to people who don't want to go to the trouble
---
I'd love someone like your character to be by my side so I can get that exp buff
---
He pays in chems too 🤤
---
Real life
---
I don't know if you talk about OP or in general, but I personnally don't kill Appalachia wildlife that doesn't attack me first.
---
Honest question: If it's its own mode, what difference does it make?   
---
I absolutely doubt battle royale would be mandatory. I hate battle royale games, so i don't play them. But i don't think it would affect anything if it's in the game in a separate mode.
---
Too late lmao fuck it
---
I’ll agree, seems like I have to drink more frequently now. (Post patch 9.5)
---
haha
---
Unfortunately I had a ghoul spawn inside my generator room (which was locked)  so like wtf, now can an enemy spawn inside a locked basement. I get mole rats and radscorpions, but ghouls? The spawning system needs some work for sure.
---
Right?! 
---
15% XP boost. Bam. 
---
More caps in containers? Sure. More chems? Sure. Want extra DR? Got you. 
---
Short sighted griefers abound in this game. It's ridiculous.
---
So kind of like reddit flair, where you can choose from what’s available? The other comments seem to think you mean the ability to add custom text, but that’s not how I interpreted it.
---
I also make a box with some walls and a roof so no one can get to your FT mat so you're not sniped when you show up.
---
Omg the dedication is glorious lol...
---
 I wonder if he's still sitting there.
---
Doesn't give or roll new cards until new cards are released.
---
I smack em with a commie wacker
---
I’d like them to work on the effect of keeping what you just killed in the same place you killed it especially legendary ones... now that would be an awesome effect...
---
What do you mean by trash? Spawned enemies or poor loot?
---
Same, except I did it multiple times, for minutes at a time.
---
Wasn't until my friend insisted it worked when another friend was asking how to get it.
---
So we tried it together, again minutes, multiple disleaslings, nothing. 
---
Just before we were going to give up my friend got it. So I stood there for minutes more, then finally challenge completed.
---
Never worked so hard to get sick before lol
---
With bare hands and one stim.
---
We have brahmin. And you can tame all kinds of things, but mostly they're really squishy and die easy. :(
---
Having you around would make game play way easier they truly missed out, sorry they greifers you bro.
---
Hmm
---
Nah it’s perfectly acceptable to have had the taste of a game ruined by a bad launch and worse clean-up
---
if you see it broken - it's kinda hard to see sometimes though, walls are easy to see.
---
And we need a laughing emote for when people won't PvP
---
yes it would be !
---
Ctrl+shift+m to mute on PC. Ctrl+shift+u to unmute. I agree the music sucks I hope you find this workaround useful.
---
What about mutations... shouldn't those eventually kill you or turn you into a ghoul
---
Players seem to spawn where you originally placed your camp device
---
Reduce the amount of food available and make rad storms give you more rads than a ghoul from White Springs. 
---
Just those two items would change game play now add it universally to everything all while making enemies harder to kill..
---
PVP is an important element of the game so extra focus in this area can only benefit the overall game in my view. For sure there is work to do and the game would not  be a success if it was soley a BR but as just one part of the game in a cut down version it could be a great idea
---
Damn. Are you on PC? I like to wear power armor but dont play that much and hate wasting all my time trying to find them.
---
Man I appreciate the advice here a lot. There's a load of new stuff. So I'll pop on, get my heavy legendaries and stuff traded in for the daily limit. Sell the heavy non legendary bits to normal vendors, set up a player vending machine at my camp for some other bits I want rid of. Then I'll head for the scout quest completion and work through the possum challenges. 
---
It's going to be long but at least I'll have something to do now, it started to stagnate a little and I got busy with work around then so I just haven't been back.
---
That is, indeed, my point. The only real edge it has anymore is freedom in nuke zones, if you can even call that an edge.
---
Also, there is a way to set framerates.   If you let the game control framerates in your driver, it may help.  Or, there is a way to uncap framerates.  Unfortunately, i cant look that up right now.  But that may help.
---
it would also be nice for console players to stay in party chat while interacting with players in the game
---
I was buying them like crazy at 50/100% charge, and then the Arktos event happened, the sentry bot inside has a full or nearly full core and it respawns like crazy when people join so I’m now super overloaded.
---
Just because someone reached level 120 it does not mean he can handle a group of anglers, really. Level only correlates to addiction, not skills or firepower.
---
Oh god.. Little too far
---
I was rocking a 3* Chefs rolling pin earlier this week :)
---
What system are you on?? I’ve never seen “Scrap B” on the screen... can you scrap without a bench??
---
I occasionally stock collectibles for exactly those occasions. I always wonder what people think about that one ofmy vending machine containing large amounts of alcohol, teddybears, boardgames and a vault tec clock..
---
Initially, the SBQ drops were the only way to get them. At some point a couple months ago they added the plans to the BoS terminal that you can access on the top floor of Defiance after completing the questline, so the plans from the queen are essentially useless wastes of RNG at this point.
---
Gotcha. Thanks. One more. Did you tame him, and he just followed you home?
---
You get in I give you 5k
---
Many thanks 
---
I just think its the game ? I have been to 3 stations and had to wait 5 mins for them to load up :(
---
I will try again tomorrow :(
---
Thanks again 
---
Nothing's confirmed and BGS has released very little info about it. People are speculating
---
You can only tame creatures from certain random spawn locations, and not always even those. It has to be half your level, too. And you have to have the charisma to make it all work.
---
Lol, I am on PC.
---
ltdansleg
---
I'm usually on for a bit in the afternoons/evenings EST.
---
I would do that, and I'm sure many others would too. Bethesda, please consider!
---
Have you not considered that they'll release a just as extensive Roadmap of content for Nuclear Winter, just like they released a more detailed one for Wild Appalachia? That maybe they're releasing Roadmaps for each Season as they come?
---
Because they probably don't want to mention things too far down the line until they get things more ready (look at how mad we got at all the shuffles that already happened in WA), so they didn't release too many Nuclear Winter details yet, but actually have quite a lot planned for it?
---
You seem to have neglected that they said they're totally revamping the main questline, and are totally focused on "new game mode" only. And about that, you're also seemingly convinced it'll be Battle Royale, despite that being pure rumor and speculation.
---
Just chill man, they'll tell us more soon.
---
Ammosmith and super duper still work they just don’t count towards the challenge, the challenges go by the original number without perks. 
---
You’ll still get more though but they just don’t count.
---
I sold my fusion cores at about 2 caps per percent of charge, starting at 120 caps for a full one and lowering the price from there. If they're below 50% I just use them up.
---
It's a legit request and l always do it.
---
You don’t have to spend money though. You get like 3 improved repair kits from completing Scorched Earth event.
---
True NV has alot more movie references, as in, captchuring the feel of a movie. I mean its not a bad game. Its just not my favourite fallout
---
Try harder
---
What this guy said.
---
Sorry you feel that way man. I'm excited to see that Bethesda is finally trying to improve this game. And I believe nuclear winter will be fun.
---
Why not use them? I have more than I need from SBQ and I use them to repair on the fly constantly. They're great.
---
I just would love some more PvE focused stuff and waiting until Fall for Wastelanders sounds brutal haha
---
I do know that Nuclear Winter will have the raids and prestige system and stuff, that should be interesting
---
Needs a general game message log like RPGs always used to have.
---
I still have the TNT Dome keys for 2 and 3 in my inv. So idk if you have the ones for the quantum room still. But if you do please open the door for me.
---
One of the foundations I got stuck in last night was concrete, so...
---
...which makes me think how nice it would be, for PvP, to have the chance to create biogranades and/or traps. Given you have the required perks and do some kind of nice quest to unlock the knowledge. That could give the syringer a reason to exist.
---
I watched the video linked by someone else and have to admit it sounds like a battle royale.
---
Agree don’t fuck it up
---
Don’t be a vendor.  Unless we get fast travel spawn points, they will show up inside your locked area about half the time.
---
And people will likely fast travel elsewhere if there isn’t a nearby fast travel point, leaving whatever spawned by their arrival to chew on your camp.
---
Sorry for being harsh, but I’m really getting annoyed by travelling into locked rooms all the time.
---
When you tame something they start walking to your camp. Depending on how far away it is will determine how long it takes to get there. And it can also be killed along the way. My camp is in the NW side of the map, and I tamed my deathclaw on this SE side, it took about 3 hours for it to show up.
---
read some other threads saying it couldnt be deprimed, im not sure how i was able to revert it back to standard..maybe because it was from a player vendor who had it primed and not me who did it, or because i don't know the plan.
---
This is truly a sad day for Appalachia, and therefor the world.
---
I am kind of salty that heavy guns have armor pen only with power armor.
---
I swear I read somewhere on Bethesda update notes, that is a feature that I believe was supposed to go on your "personal terminal". So I was super excited to build it, only to find out...right now, it's not that helpful.
---
How to *not* end a good post: "i wIlL gEt dOwNvOtEd bY mIndLeSs fAnBoYs".
---
I love how anyone who downvotes You is “mindless” lol. You must have your head so far up your ass...
---
Lol. Awesome.
---
You should be able to execute level 40s in nuke areas shooting everything with a tesla.
---
After a relog i can go back to standard, so looks like its a bug straight after fitting it
---
I power armour glitch into locked CAMPs. The harder they try, the more I want to.
---
That's like 7 days of selling the maximum value to all the vendors. Do you not buy stuff? I'm trying to get all the building plans I dont already have to improve my base building and usually dont ever have more than 2000 caps.
---
I like this idea.  Might I suggest that we also be allowed to "level up" our weapons.  
---
I.E. I found a great weapon that has exactly the legendary effects I want but it's level 35.  I would like to spend say 150 scrip to make it a level 45 weapon.  
---
The cost to level up a weapon would be 150 scrip per level rank.  This way if we find a good weapon at the start of the game it can grow with us as our adventures continue.
---
So I just checked and I do not have the quantum room key on my current character. But I was able to get the nuka paint plans again....soon to be for sale. :)
---
I honestly kill them, hell. Half the time I do repairs without ever saying anything. It's just polite.
---
Rose is *sooo good*. Love that voice acting so much it's a reason on it's own starting a new char.
---
This is why I don’t accept any random invites from any players I don’t know or that I’ve played with first.
---
This is an old trick still alive and well and when they team up with you then attack someone it brings you into PvP since you’re teamed with them.
---
Leveling a second character, when I was level 12 I picked up 6 (250 atoms). 
---
Reason being was I already had some legendary gear that I needed to constantly repair but didn't have all the required mats. Repairing gear becomes easy at higher levels (you have the proper perks, also if you run White Knight and Gunsmith, all of your stuff is easier to repair and breaks less frequently). 
---
So I was stuck in a jam, my legendary chest piece broke and I didn't have the means to fix it. I suppose I could have looked up where to find the mats required, but in that current situation I figured it was easier and faster to spend the 50 atoms (well I bought 6 since you get 5 + 1 free, but for all intents and purposes a single repair kit is 50 atoms). 
---
Now that my character is comfortable at level 30 I doubt I will ever buy any more on that character (I have ample mats now). 
---
But I never found them game breaking or anything, hell even seasoned players it may not be a bad idea to have a couple on hand if your weapon breaks mid-fight somehow. By the time you have your build figured out you probably won't even need them - but at 0.1 weight, holding onto one or two doesn't seem like a bad idea. 
---
I think people were up in arms because by definition this is not an aesthetic / cosmetic item, and were under the impression that items from the store would only do that. Basically people were over-speculating; "Well you added this, so you already went back on what you said - what's next, special ammo?" 
---
*TLDR: I think their fine, but Beth said the store was just cosmetic.*
---
Well, they already have this information, since this is why the oculd tell us the 10 most sold items so far. It is just a matter of showing it to us, maybe in a very simple way. No big deal. It doesnt even require you to set up a new table.
---
If you’re on Xbox I can make you an Empath and egghead serums no charge! That will add to it all
---
alright, good to know
---
Yes, colas are AFAIK are a different buff set than alcohols and drugs. IDK what the drug perks are but it could be possible to push +10 strength if drugs and drug perks are involved.
---
5th pic down of the forming nuclear explosion is a great wallpaper shot.  :)
---
I messaged you on Xbox. Please.  It would help a lot
---
This would be so much better than battle royale.
---
There’s a treehouse close by - you should check it out!
---
* Today I answered a question that ~~nobody asked~~ everyone was too afraid to ask!
---
Fify.
---
Thanks, hero!
---
Nice shots!  Thanks for sharing. :)
---
I got [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/582623545922945024/unknown.png) on my alt from the first Ranged Box I opened. What I really want from 3\* boxes is reduced weight though so I'd prefer getting those still because of how amazing it is (I want a reduced weight Tesla)
---
From all the armor rolls I've done she really does seem to roll the same affixes one after another so it's not too unusual. Certainly some rigged RNG goin' on with legendary drops.
---
Maybe use an NSFW tag pal 🤦🤣
---
I thought that was a given?
---
I'd also like to know
---
Last few days this has been happening... seems the weekend before any update this weird stuff happens... (I’m just assuming there’s an update Tuesday)
---
You use full unyielding in a non bloodied build?
---
I have considered a possibility of them releasing more than they have shown on 2019 roadmap, but my problem with this is that both Wild Appalachia and Wastelanders have an extensive list of "All new" things on 2019 roadmap compared to Nuclear Winters "All new game mode".
---
I haven't said anything about revamp of the main questline because it's a thing from Wastelanders, not Nuclear Winter.
---
Of course i can't be sure about the new game mode being BR or even PVP based, and i think i mentioned that it's just a rumor, however it is supported by some decent evidence.
---
It’s okay for you to complain, but others shouldn’t? People complain about not having these mats, but the mats shouldn’t exist because people will complain? Anyone who believes in getting these mats must also be the people who believed in player-damage safe houses? I’m not following the logic, personally. I believe in updates based on popular demand, within reason, and patches for common glitches. If fast travel is fixed to resolve the issue, no mats needed. If mats are the easiest way to fix the issue, let’s do it.
---
Honest answer: you're still missing the point. It's a waste of DLC. It's garbage
---
Yeah I thought I was seeing this too.
---
That and a legendary * and number of them would be nice!
---
Oh man, that looks pretty fun! I recently started playing and I may take some inspiration from your build.
---
Eh, fair enough
---
Wait till you visit Sammy's camp. Super mutants GALORE! A guaranteed legendary and a suicider and their cronies! I have 22 mini nukes from yesterday lol
---
That must have been before the serum change then, because I got my ultracite PA plans for free at the end of the BOS questline and that was within the first month or two of the game. Unless you're talking about the mod plans
---
Well I'm using this for the broadsider (yes I know it's a trash gun). I believe it's lifespan is about 40 shots before it breaks. With that said I wouldn't mind even taking the rank 1 just because of that. There's not much else I could dump the points into except maybe tenderizer rank 1 and some points into endurance for higher hp for nerd rage.
---
Which rank did you use and how often did you find it proccing?
---
Exaggeration. I only have an occasional ghoul wander across the river from a power thingy across the way. One turret on the roof takes care of them. Since player vending started, i've repaired two things: the artillery and a patch of razorgrain. I realize i may be lucky, and i know people don't want to move to avoid spawns, but it's not impossible.   
---
Also Grahm and Chally show up in front of my house pretty regularly, like the ice cream truck. :D Mmm, brahmin milk ice cream.
---
I think this would be great. Especially if each star level had a different effect, so you knew if an actual 3* item dropped.
---
I've been selling Treasure Maps for 25 caps. Is that under/over priced? I only started playing a couple weeks ago and honestly have no idea what the maps give in the first place.
---
Anyone else have to google "smh" every time someone uses it on the Internet?
---
There are a lot of sounds, music or otherwise, that are waaay too loud compared to other sounds in the game. The atomic shop, legendary scrapper, and those missile launchers in the bog are all way too loud.
---
He was probably farming the challenge that has you kill ghouls with a Fat Man
---
Why lock anything in the wastes? I leave it open. I don't even have doors usually
---
I am kinda salty that armor pen doesn't work at all with my Gatling/plasma/laser
---
Good points! I have had friends lose interest after ever upwards and are taking a break. Hope they keep it interesting.
---
&gt; That is impossible for them to know as bethesda has been extremely tight lipped on the player base for this game unlike all their previous games
---
What other game has Bethesda ever released player numbers for, for one and it's not 'impossible' because the numbers he's talking about come from [Microsoft's official website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/most-played/games/xbox) Fallout 76 has a higher concurrent player count then ESO no less, which is a successful game with a large active and growing player base.
---
Not as far as I know. For what it's worth, this armor adds 25 to an actor value named SURV\_DiseaseChanceMult\_EnvironmentalHazard, which has a default value of 0 and the description "a value of +10 means 10% higher chance of getting disease (worse for player)". If that's true then those pieces of armor would actually increase the disease chance. The descriptions are generally not trustworthy though.
---
This just seems strange to me. Like me, there are a lot of high level players. I didn’t know this was a thing. In FO4 we got to trap creatures and pacify them with technology. I didn’t know this was a thing because I’ve never seen anybody doing it! Lol. This seems like something high level players would want to be doing.
---
What evidence, because it's the first I've heard of the rumor at all.
---
And ya, you acknowledge it's a rumor, but then complain about BR a bunch, so that really makes it seem like you think it's very likely, just saying.
---
I got mine on 3 and it pops alot..
---
That only works for your spawn point in your camp, not where others spawn, unfortunately..
---
It's tedious, enacting the game mechanic is not fun at all.
---
You have to work your way through a bad inventory system, push the button on it and all the feedback you get is a meter going up and a gulp noise.
---
The annoyance cooldown of having to do it is longer than the frequency at which you have to do it again.
---
What kind of laser rifle specifically? The Gatling or what?
---
Shhhh...  no there isnt...  GHOST!!! although there is a creepy church in the Mire you should check out
---
It's like you truly can't read, you're pathetic dude.
---
Where did you see a flatwoods monster?
---
And that's when I would let it destroy his camp. He wants to be a dick? Let him spend his junk to fix it.
---
I just want them to add Dogmeat into the game as a companion you can travel with.
---
You literally have no argument. It’s entirely on you.
---
I lock my large purifiers, the small ones are unlocked.
---
But if you mugs can't learn to shut doors , that may change.
---
I don't say that everyone who downvotes my post is either fanboy or mindless, i say that mindless fanboys will be the types of people who will downvote my post based on the title.
---
My argument for why Nuclear Winter won't be as expansive as Wild Appalachia is the 2019 roadmap, both Wild Appalachia and Wastelanders have an extensive list of "All new" things compared to Nuclear Winters "All new game mode".
---
That's good to hear. You wouldn't believe the amount of people I've seen claiming rank 1 procced more due to a bug. Maybe it's fixed now?
---
Do you know this because you’re on pc? How are people privy to this kind of info. It blows my mind. Lol
---
OMG this is the one QOL that I would really like to have!  So annoying to be missing one piece of plastic and cant hit the repair all.
---
Love how this gets 100 upvotes despite food consumption not changing.
---
Got it from an event like two weeks after release
---
Did you know that in some countries in Europe, depending on the name, you can go to the police and file a complaint? A real one, at which point they get in touch with the company which must assign resources to investigate. Even if the data is not phisically located in that country (data and CDNs, of course). Even worse if you implement text chat. Not to mention the infrastructure to develop and maintain it. And the people.
---
Bethesda didn’t even make New Vegas.
---
No idea.. I've never had a problem with it poping...  I turned it off cuz it would pop so often
---
Ps4
---
I've got around 800 hours in game, and I want to contest some of your points. I don't do this to be mean, but just my personal observations in lots of SBQ fights. 
---
1: I've done half of her damage while she was in the air. She still landed just fine. If you've got Vats perks and a long range weapon, there's no reason not to hit her while she's in the air.  If  you're not doing damage, of course wait until she lands, but if you have the right weapons, go for it. Break her wings while she's in the air.
---
2: Simply wrong. Every SBQ I've been to, people have stood on top of things, and the SBQ has always landed many times. There's always some people still on the ground, she'll just agro whoever is on the ground. I would like to science and see if she wouldn't land if everyone were on top of a fence, but I honestly don't think it matters. She doesn't care if you're in a 6 foot high fence, she can still target you on there. And I've seen her land right on top of V9 many times.  Hiding inside a building only happens with low level characters who don't know how to fight her anyway, everyone else is outside. 
---
3: The entire event is super laggy sometimes, regardless of weapons uses. Those laser gatlings can do a number on your frames, too. Just use whatever you have, it doesn't really matter that much. I'm even on an older machine, on satellite internet,  and if I can manage to do SBQ runs, so can someone with nukes. 
---
4: Ok, this is super valid. You need a close FT point outside the nuke zone, and it drives me nuts when you have to run over from the train station or wherever.
---
And you think a battle Royale will last long enough to keep you entertained more than a day? Those of you that are hoping for this will all be sick of it the day after it's released
---
A 3 Star from the legendary vendor gives you roughly 45 script or more
---
I agree it feels good to bless the noobs
---
Don’t care. I’ll set the teleport timer, steal your shit and leave.
---
Look for low level players, follow them until they get killed and then revive them. You don't have to actually team up.
---
Never used a serum yet. Are they removed by radaway? Or are they permanent?
---
oh wow! I didn't see that when I visited her camp but I'd defend it from anything!
---
Because enemies get inside when you leave my door open. Maybe if all of you weren't born in a effin' barn I would leave them all unlocked.
---
It has nothing to do with consoles dummie, the bad servers are responsible for those crashes!
---
How long have you been playing? Starting from scratch, sure, that won’t be the easiest. I just did a Harpers Ferry run and knocked out 1400 caps after taking out people. I buy stuff but I’ve already got a shit load of plans. If people are buying plans, that totally makes sense. That shits expensive.
---
Nah.
---
I only had rank one on my rifle build and it was ok. Rank 3 prob very decent.
---
I ended up swapping it out for more damage related perks and just swap in weapons artisan 3 when at a work bench to over repair to 200% durability.
---
I do too, but can understand why people would want to lock their resources, especially if they’re in a well-travelled spot.
---
Where did you get yours?  Vending?
---
Server hop then.  Not a hard concept to understand.
---
You're still the minority by a long shot, and I may not have as many hour put in as you but I still play every day and always enjoy myself. I don't really do events often, I've completed all side quests, and have finished the main quest line. Still find new places to explore and things to do. I especially like helping low level players with tough quest lines
---
I agree, we already have pvp that should be it and most people play PvE anyways, I want more story and more unique weapons not reasons of a combat rifle and stuff. But who knows it might turn out to be good and fun.
---
And sure, it only says "New Game Mode" as the tagline, but it also says New Features and High Level Vault Raids on the badges right underneath that. So what makes you think that won't all be comparable to what we got with WA?
---
It's not like this roadmap told us WA was gonna have as much as it did, it only has three vague badges about content too, so why worry NW will be so empty? We didn't know WA would have so much until they released a more detailed, shorter time-frame roadmap. They'll probably do the exact same for NW so we know when to expect (barring delays lol) each specific feature.
---
Get rid of your windows. Any player can bypass your locks and such by activating a bed, chair, crafting station, etc through any opening.
---
Just changed it, no effect on this game 👍
---
Yeah I'm right around 50% health most of the time as I cap it with rads, so I may not get the full effect of the unyielding but I do get a small boost. Plus I only need to drop about 20% hp to get the full effect.
---
I found out about it on Reddit months ago, or I probably wouldn't know either. 
---
I've tamed 4 Deathclaws, 3 possums, a cat and a dog. 
---
The Deathclaws lasted the longest, but I was in high level areas and they've all died. Some were killed by other players, sadly. 
---
The possoms, cat and dog all died the first time any mob spawned in the area. It was kinda heartbreaking, to be honest. I was so excited when I got that first dog, and watching it die almost instantly when some ferals spawned was like...wtf. Then my poor possums. Got a cat 2 days ago, knew it wouldn't last long, and it lasted less than a half an hour, what with people FTing to my camp to look at vending. 
---
Now I'm not going to tame anything that can't defend itself.  I really really wish they'd make the non-agro creatures like dogs, cats, etc, unkillable.
---
Signing on now
---
Yes it is rare, we’ve done a lot of runs now and no one in our group has gotten one
---
Yeah you wanna have lock doors and have me spawned into a locked room where there is no possible way to get out except spend my hard earned caps then yeah darn tootin im gunna get handsy with your juicy tatos
---
On a related note, is it just me or is Onyxia casting Deep Breath more often.
---
We’ve found that a mix of ranged weapons (preferably explosive) and melee weapons works best, using or sharing the Glow Sight perk
---
Apparently there are a lot of people complaining about this. Just because YOU don't have a problem doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
---
You have to do all that just to take out a few enemies?
---
Guy trolls, I give heads up on the area this is happening, random guy on reddit gets butthurt, that's all that happened here, don't know why you need to try to be superior, because I proved you wrong about the passive mode thing?  Grow up child, we're finished here.
---
You’re the butthurt one 😂
---
Off a Reddit post either the market or bazzar. Got my BE 50cal the same way. Just gotta catch the right play. Haven't seen on in vending yet and I visit every one unfortunately for no good reason most of the time.
---
Yup same GT
---
Holy crap, have yet to see a level hundred. Would of been coll to see then battle.
---
I just kind of want my character's name to actually be visible? Like my character has a real person name, I feel like it would make the game more immersive.
---
Turn up near the end, tag the alpha and wait. Event took me 5 minutes
---
Was it rank 3?
---
....Do super mutant even have a dick ? ? I need a lore expert here
---
If you have starched jeans 2* they’ll never go away but using RadX will pause there effect. 
---
Using class freak can reduce the amount of negative issues they give you and if so they can be a game changer!
---
I have a question: if I do attack an enemy at the camp and have a bullet go stray and hit a wall. Do I then have to worry about being wanted? I have killed a mole our two that was munching on someone's wall or door but I used vats and hoped that I didn't miss.
---
Yeah I'll be doing that as well
---
Nice! my best result was 15 in a row
---
I allowed a scorchbeast to destroy someone's camp for that exact reason.
---
Lmao downvotes arent just about hate. You are being downvoted because it has been proven that nothing has changed. Your gameplay might've changed making your personal hunger and thirst deplete more.
---
Meh, why you keep commenting on a post not pertaining to you? All I've done is give a warning to Xbox players doing the tourist mission and it somehow triggered you. I could have logged off or whatever, which I did after the second death no sweat, just helping other wanderers, your mommy not give you enough attention or something?
---
Me too, but I ran out of Points and the Moleman was getting close.
---
Agree. Would make it even more helpful.
---
And don't forget to support my patreon ! *giant notification on screen*
---
I lock 2/8 purifiers. The other 6 are for the public.
---
Plus on top of that I've tried bloodied weapons and they dont compare to a instigating weapon. Bloodied may be better for contant dps on an enemy but having you hp so dangerously low means you get one shot alot.  
---
Bloodied build work so well with ranged weapons cause it takes away the chance of close combat, but with melee it doesn't make much since. 
---
It's better to get a huge damage hit right away than sitting there hitting an enemy over and over again
---
Ah ok, I've done probably 200-300 mire events and never gotten a rare outfit. I wonder if they still drop at all.
---
I am challenging you, sir, to a duel.
---
Or into some sort of living abomination
---
I have video of &lt;3 min kills to back up. We kill the queen 3-9 times a night. Trust me I'm right on all 4.
---
Come to think of it, i don't really have any evidence besides the evidence that was used by controversy youtubers like juicehead. Ima do my own research and reply tomorrow.
---
Oh yea the vault raids should be interesting. I think as long as Wastelanders is a significant update to PvE then I think all this initial focus on PvP can be forgiven.
---
Really just give me an offline mode with mods and I will love this game like I do the other Fallout games.
---
I use an instigating handmade and an executioners handmade mostly. I toggle between for extra first shot damage and then double damage on the last 40 percent health. 
---
For white springs I have a ghoul slayers death tambo that is a beast. 
---
And I also play around with a vampires whiffle ball bat, vampires death claw gauntlet and the bear arm.
---
50 caps.
---
Seriously, man. Though I SHOULD probably practice on dogs and cats first. I just went through and upgraded animal friend to the max, and equipped it. Does a prompt come up when you approach the animal? Or what do I need to do?
---
I love using VATS and walking back and forth into an enemy with a 0% though..
---
Claiming something triggered somebody over and over baselessly is a great way to look ridiculous lmao yeah I’m just replying now because you look terrible and it’s funny
---
I heard you like bag, so i gave you a bag to keep in your bag
---
If only I had the ability to phase-shift bullets at the touch of a button, that’s basically what jumping is against a melee opponent in PvP
---
I’ve played since the BETA and it’s improved drastically since then! 
---
NPC’s are minimal like Rose and Graham and a few others but the game is mainly designed to play with others and friends in the same world and it’s your choice to talk to them or not. 
---
I’ve met a lot of cool peeps here in the wasteland and that works for me! 
---
Backpacks add +60 carry weight and the upgraded ones add 120 (I prefer the armored one but have both now just in case)
---
Light boxes are stupid finicky. It seems that the snapping scale off.
---
Hell the mommy thing just shows you can’t even come up with something mildly original and it is killing you 😂😂
---
i agree, i am not a competitive person at all and i would much prefer a world where players work together, and maybe things are different now but i have been playing since launch and bad experiences in the beginning before all these changes really soured my mood and inclination to share my space with others
---
I would trade two head shakes for a single facepalm.
---
And we need the "well, what is it?" Emote from Dark souls, I would spam this everytime I put a noob in the dirt lol
---
That’s probably it, because I do it a ton!
---
Nope... you got to live with the mutant effects... weird legs.. get all gross and windegoy...
---
You dont understand what i said. They are incapable of doing that. There is no way the same team that released fo76 is capable of releasing a properly functioning BR dlc. Gunplay is way too important in a BR and it's utterly atrocious in fo76.
---
A big scaled BR in the fallout universe with gunplay on the level of other BRs or at least on the level of pubg? Hell yeah people would play that. But that's not going to happen. So instead people will be mad because they will get a half-arsed version of which every minute that was spent on it shouldve been spent on improving fo76 instead.
---
Yeah next time you log on, Mash the vats button while in power armor and you can watch the meter drop like nobody’s business
---
It's extremely pleasant to see the world less full of assholes now though since the Survival server exists
---
Sweet, thanks. I stopped watching most fallout YouTubers a while back, they got too grumbly about it lol, so I'm outta the loop on the rumor mill
---
And also ya, sorry, you're right about the main questline revamp being in Wastelanders not NW, got it mixed up because they were talking about both in the End of WA Inside the Vault post. Totally my mistake.
---
Super nice work, decoration makes it look way more immersive than most camps I seen.
---
How did you get that frying food animation? I like poses that I can use during photomode to make it seem more realistic but most of the atom shop ones are too OTT for me personally.
---
The new camp. She got a new place
---
Just place your camp where scortchbeasts spawn. Plenty of free loots
---
Too easy. Everyone would have max level perfect rolls within a month.
---
Guys get in mine, but I placed things so they can't go anywhere, it's all sectioned off. If I did grow, probably build a trap with pressure plates on the way out. I might try this on my alt. The problem is no logic gate or timers to automate this stuff. A lot of bloodied now days though, one spike trap should do it.
---
PSA: People seeking items at max caps are just showing off items, not trying to sell them. 
---
Best way until we get display cases.
---
Sure dude, laughing emoji, putting out false information, you got your ducks in a row and not upset over a random reddit post, at least I know what I did wrong, why don't you go complain more about how you should be able to team kill on halo?  Your bitching there definitely resonated well huh?  Is all you do complain, whine, and bitch?
---
Radiers...  cuz eff everyone... I think everyone will be x-men.. cuz ya cant be in the BoS with mutations..
---
My main argument here is why would they not mention any new quests, events, features etc. in Nuclear Winters headline, when they did it with Wastelanders. It just doesn't make sense for me, i suppose we'll have a confirmation for one or the other in like 10 days tho.
---
Sure, PM me if you want to borrow it :)
---
No beta.  Have bug.
---
IF I must kill enemies destroying your camp, be at least nice and give me free beer (punch bowl). Optionally, if you are an excellent host, you could even provide both radiations (emitter) and showers.
---
Oh right, yeah I guess it's pretty easily farmable to be fair. Cheers.
---
With eagle eyes and talons, exploding in electricity as soon as someone touch you
---
I'm pretty sure the bugginess of that game had more to do with bethesda's involvement than obsidian, considering the portfolio of both companies
---
Doesn't work for any energy damage. Now if i would a legendary "supercharged" effect that would boost energy weapon damage same as AA does i wouldn't mind.
---
I don't watch any of those nowadays too, just seen their videos linked on posts regarding Nuclear Winter.
---
And I would love to just pay 150 scrip and pick my effects, like choose a handmade, then 50 for bloody 50 for explosive and 50 for reload speed, hell why not just make it so everyone spawns in with the creation kit open, and they can build their armor set and weapons on login for free?
---
Seems like everyone wants shit handed to them. Go and grind it. If you didn't get the perfect rolls on the weapon, it isn't going to be changed to your perfect rolls so easily.
---
Thanks I'll just follow your lead since I don't have voice Comms.. hurray for no text chat..
---
Customers aren't really to blame, every player on the map (even the super low level ones) can come visit your camp and spawn in enemies. They may simply not be able to deal with the spawns. And so it falls on the owner to take care of his own defences.
---
I have my camp right next to a lvl 76 glowing bear who respawns all the time. To deal with him I attached some quarter floors to the exterior of the upper levels of my base on the side this beast usually spawns and placed turrets there. Since the turrets are on the upper level and outside my walls, the bear can't reach them and just runs off whenever he gets attacked. Or he simply camps below one of the turrets and then the other turrets / visiting players will finish him off.
---
To deal with anglers you might have to place a whole array of missile turrets on whichever side they spawn. Gonna cost quite a bit of budget, but that is the price of running a shop so close to a static spawn point. If you can get it working tho, you'll receive a bunch of free asbestos, adhesive and angler meat every time you return home! Just like this bear that lives near my base has now provided me with hundreds of springs and acid.
---
As long as you get regular visitors, setting up a properly defended shop right next to a static spawn point with enemies that drop decent loot might actually be more lucrative than placing your shop/base on a resource node.
---
I figure that's what he expected. He probably didn't think he could kill it on his own or contribute significantly, or thought that it was a trap.
---
&gt;Looted 38 legendary items. 3 were three star. The vast vast majority were 2 star combat armor (could have done a better job of tracking this).
---
Completing the Scorched Earth event always rewards a two-star piece of Combat Armor, regardless of what the Queen drops.
---
You're just not worth the time to even attempt to be original with, if you don't know how passive mode works you're not intelligent enough for me to insult you, you seem starved for attention so we're finished here.
---
Lmao stalk me because I’m the salty one. Myself and I’m sure many others are just laughing at you and you’re fully aware and in Reddit fight mode
---
You're a real funny guy!
---
Maybe a way to exchange perk cards you dont need for a certain currency to buy perk packs
---
oh awesome!!!! I will come see tonight if that's ok :D
---
Hope you got two tips and not just that one
---
It would be nice if they were mutually exclusive. Which would mean implementing multiple ways to get through the main quest.
---
You’re literally complaining someone was killing you. You literally have them the green light. This is why you’re being mocked ffs 😂
---
Yes, but they’re sterile. At least, that’s how it was in Fallout 1&amp;2 lore.
---
trting to see if the game i stupidly bought at full price because of blind devotion to the fallout series has turned around and become enjoyable, but so far been disappointed
---
What? Please explain...
---
I don’t mind how people get their kicks, as long as it doesn’t involve pulling dirty stunts like this.
---
Enclave. It would be really cool if we could have PVP Faction wars. Even if we got teleported to some form of "battlefield" when joining. Could be one faction vs the other with a time limit and you can purchase NPC robots to aid in battle etc.
---
I barely play with volume. Usually have YouTube running on the other screen with something worthy
---
This! I once fast traveled to someone's camp to see what they had for sale. The game loaded me inside of their home, but all the doors were locked, so I couldn't get outside to use the vending machines. I also couldn't fast travel, so I ended up picking the lock to get outside. I even ended up buying something from the owner, but because I picked the lock, I had a bounty. Someone then killed me while I was in my own camp making bulk materials, and he took most of my crafting materials that I dropped...
---
Well if it is, it wouldn't be the first time they lied to us, but I would prefer if it was a true nuclear winter, maybe it can borrow some elements from the frost fo4 mod and maybe the long dark
---
you have got to be kidding me... i mean no disrespect, and thank you for informing us, but how critical was this that it could not wait for the next maintenance or patch? when there is a possibility that further changes will be made to the same file between now and then. 
---
i just stepped on this land mine now, when i finally have some time to play. i had to google "fallout 76 7.73 gb patch" to find this because it was not mentioned anywhere. i was near my flat where my pc is over the weekend and i could have popped in just to turn it on so it can download this so its ready for today. now i have 6-7 hours of download to go and have to enjoy 14400 modem speeds while i wait... again.
---
you probably have the statistics at bethesda, what percentage players that have logged in at least once during the week leading to this post have NOT installed patch 9.5? is it 30% or more... id understand, i would give it a pass, but i somehow doubt it.
---
Even Automatron added a pretty good story line and the fucking game winning robot customization that let you turn Codsworth into an unkillable floating tank of death. The boss fight in the end was also some of the most fun I've had in any game, combat wise. But lets just hoist up the smaller more disappointing ones as the only standard to act matters because that's fair and reasonable
---
well also in your logical perspective how am I going to fit a fatman and all those guns in a backpack, especially since I run a heavy weapons build with 50 cal machine guns and gatling lasers.
---
We need a carrot to chase. Not this no.
---
Ask her, I don't know if she'll be on or not
---
BoS for life man
---
I don't know Bethesda implamented crafting 10 years ago
---
Well, personally, me and everyone I’ve played with has said all the voice acting is cringy as hell. There’s a few bright points but you can tell the budget for the main quest voice talent was looooow. Half the voices are Scribe Haylen.
---
I do.. unless I spawn inside their locked generator/water purifier room. Then I can't. I can shut off all their power switches though and wait for the mob of ghouls that spawned to open up a wall for me while their missile turrets are shut down. I have plenty of fresh water to drink in here.
---
Honestly though I was just waiting for the player to come home after seeing their icon was gone from the map and tell them not to lock their valuables inside their spawn point. The ghouls thing was a happy accident. I fixed their walls. I kept the water though.
---
Actually since MODUS is the defacto leader of the Enclave and he has expressed his support for the mutations lab research, mutants would be allowed into the Enclave.
---
I had no clue that's what formula q was for... sold it for 200 caps too..
---
It’d be pretty funny when you notice your charisma is at 0. Don’t even need to check, you’ve got The Wasteland Clap.
---
Maybe if you said it's name right, it would let you
---
It's been buggy ever since they added in the new flying mechanics. Some days I can wail on a ghoul and get hit 3-4 times before it'll register my own hit, some days Itll work fine and I can have all sorts of fun charging/dive-bombing with my claw
---
Enclave also......
---
Would need a team limit because in these scenarios,  people will gravitate towards the winning teams just because they wanna win.
---
They have character names that are visible in Elder Scrolls Online, why would it be harder to do it here?
---
Ahh.. good call.. I forgot he is the sole vendor of mutation in the area
---
I always kill any enimies that spawn at someone's camp. Yesterday i was browsing vending machines and the enimies destroyed a wall i repaired it for the person because it was my fault they destroyed it i didn't notice the enemies until i was done shopping it should be common courtesy to do this for people when you visit their camp.
---
I hear you, but while some of us are right on everything and keeping up with news--others take more than 5-6 days. Give it another week and hopefully people will figure it out if they can get in. I've tried loading into it twice since posting 4 hours ago, 1 buzzing lockup and one CTD. Just not worth doing yet, so people aren't getting the experience. Hopefully it'll get better next week.
---
Yeah but Bethesda doesn't give a f***. I mean it'd be fine if the perk description actually said that armor pen doesn't work with energy. But i doesn't. Also AA energy guns still drop so idk what they're doing.
---
Depends on the enemies, but they can be Gutsies, Super Mutants with miniguns, Gulpers, Scorchbeast, etc.
---
Overall any enemy is a pain in the ass, because I came for vending, not wasting time on fighting.
---
Speak the damn truth homie! I'm glad there are other people that do this, too.
---
3 always for me.  shit breaks so fast :(  On my heavy gunner, I could go through 3 or 4 fully WA repaired gats in one SBQ fight without it.
---
Think a cryolator would look better as christmas painted. Think of the small reservoir under the barrel painted as an ornament. And the unique part of it would be its set up like a grenade launcher and it fires nuka shots.
---
It can be quite awful. Attacking just a critter that should die in a single hit from anything, even takes multiple hits
---
But it works fine in Elder Scrolls Online, their other online game. It should work just as fine here.
---
Yeah stealthboys suck. They really should reveal you if you attack
---
I've only seen one such sheepy battle, was pretty cool to see them Duke it out
---
It already exists as a mod.
---
I love fast traveling to camps and finding baddies. Wipe them out fix a few things then shop in peace and quietness. I will say this if you build your place where mutated hoards spawn then thats on you. Like today I went to a player's camp that was at The Top of The World sandwiched by two bad spawn locations. His place was a wreck.
---
If you get to 1000 scrip that would be the best sample size (20 \* 50 scrip on 2-star ranged weapon rolls) but it will take a few days to get there because of the 150 scrip/day limit.
---
Yes, I had constant robot spawn noise and laser blasts going off so I missed part of it too. Thanks.
---
I will def.  thank you!
---
Murica!
---
The best part about being an early level is striving for better weapons and resources. It’s a nice idea, but I don’t think they’ll thank you for it in the long run.
---
I'd put my money on them being vague because they weren't sure when they'd have things finished, and didn't wanna make promises. The fanbase gets pretty annoyed at deviations from the set deadlines, so often a company will just not set a specific one.
---
Considering when they made that Roadmap way back they still had *loads* of bugs to work out, all the features from WA like Vending to implement and then work out new bugs for, well, they probably just didn't wanna put new expectations in print like that in case they super screwed something up and had to push stuff back a ton. 
---
Probably why it's taken so long to even get to the Vaults even though we've known about them for so long, because they knew it's something that would actually be ready by then even with delays from other content. Really only promising like one big thing for NW and Wastelanders, just in case WA turned out to be harder than they anticipated when they made the Roadmap.
---
Much easier to add in extra content you haven't promised the fanbase way in advance, than to risk having delays to all your release deadlines. Just my thought process at least. Rather have occasional fun surprises than consistent disappointments haha
---
Did you add it to your Linkedin profile already?
---
*oblivion beggar voice* Thank you kind sir !
---
Haha come join me
---
Is it bladed?
---
i just found it more useful having class freak and bloody mess on all the time then maybe having a chance fixing my guns and/or armor
---
I had assumed you were referring to resources since I mentioned my benches were unlocked. Now I’m just confused.
---
I almost never had spawns save for the occasional scorchbeast before player vending
---
I disagree, I don't think anyone will be expecting a full scale pubg type BR so they won't be disappointed they don't get that. It will more likely be just another of the many events but one more interesting than arktos pharma for example, we will have to wait and see I guess.
---
So how do you check it?
---
I dunno there are still people that don't know how to kill the Imposter lul
---
I'd like battle royale.
---
Totally! It would be fun if it gave a little jingle on equipping it too!
---
You can always kite mobs there, then jump over the roof and wait for them to open a way in for you.
---
Probably not needed when in a gun build. 
---
I do run it maxed in my melee build though.
---
I handled them just fine with my jumbled level 80 ass and a ghoul slayer fire axe
---
They need to tone down the animations and sound for those ridicules things.
---
If i thought people wouldn't take all of my water I'd leave them unlocked.
---
Seeing a pretty big uptick in posts like this lately. I understand not having interest in BR but this is *way* too late to have any affect - ***if*** BR is coming with Nuclear Winter, it's already *going to be* BR no matter what. That won't change with bare months left until Nuclear Winter rolls out. I get that people have been voicing their opinion against BR on this sub all along but this sort of discussion isn't gonna change it now.
---
Like others mentioned, the community on this sub makes up a tiny portion of what the game's player base is like. If Bethesda's going to go ahead and add a BR mode hot on the heels of the addition of PVP-oriented Survival mode in Wild Appalachia, they're probably pretty certain it's at least what a decent portion of their players would be interested in.
---
I'm utterly uninterested in Battle Royale myself, so I can understand the lack of enthusiasm. But if Nuclear Winter ends up coming with BR I won't be terribly put out. Wild Appalachia came with plenty of PvE content along with Survival, so I'm not super concerned that they're gonna abandon the PvE side of things just to focus on PvP for the next phase of content.
---
It's ridiculous the way people are acting like this is the end of the world for Fallout 76, though. People acted the same exact way about Battlefield V's Firestorm mode - *myself included* \- and while I can admit that BFV has its own problems, they existed long before BR came to that game and the rest of the game didn't get changed terribly much after it came. I learned a lesson from that. BR can exist as an option in a game and it won't completely ruin the rest of the experience, so maybe instead of making a huge uproar about BR ***waaaaay*** beyond the point of being able to change anything about it, we ought to just let the BR people do their BR thing and PvE people keep doing their PvE thing. One won't kill the other.
---
That may be possible, especially if they’re lower levels. 😂  When I see an animal just chilling at someone’s camp, I approach it slowly. If it doesn’t attack I leave it alone. I would feel horrible if I killed someone’s pet 😺
---
Many people get the speed demon mutation then complain about the food and hunger bars draining faster. Pay attention to the downsides folks.
---
but super mutants have no dongs
---
Yes. Mobs fighting is under 'assault' random encounter type. 
---
I saw a pack of mutant hounds vs mutant dogs once. Hilarious.
---
Seems to be a bloodied 8 shot explosive laser rifle.  Once I finally get one I'll let you know.
---
I would rather have the option to have all my characters at my place, living their own life (something similar to F4)
---
How many times have you come across them?
---
Yes of course, and repaired double with paint
---
Unfortunately I was both of them were already sold out of my vending machine when I checked. Sorry I forgot to let you know. I will keep an eye out for others like them
---
&lt;3 you can come see my drooly monster!
---
I've seen a lot of cool designs and a lot of lazy ones too. I've also found that people vending in the forest seem more likely to over price high level stuff. I have made all my ammo 1c and lowered a lot of my own plan prices. I only sell a couple apparel things but they are also below the suggested value.  I've also liked finding the serums backups I'm always searching for. No death traps for me yet. Also. I think many people put their camp thing inside which leads to the bad spawns.  It should just be left out near the edge so that doesn't happen.
---
Wait, can you harvest vegetables without getting a bounty??
---
I usually do a few spins around her and cripple everything while everyone else fires away
---
I totally agree and have noticed the same. Gotta eat like 40 corn soups a day, takes too much time
---
Yep. You won't find any players selling the recipe though, so pretty much only at the Enclave.
---
Second on doing the scout quest. Just wanted to add that a lot of the badge requirements require a camera so make sure that you get one.   
---
It seems to be more difficult finding them lately. I would just keep an eye on this subreddit for someone announcing they have found the tourist.
---
I've seen multiple and all over 20k.
---
I don't know what it is about BR that gets people so fired up about it. I used to be the same way but that's because I didn't play any games that included BR as well as other game modes; my only experience with BR could have ever been BR standalone games like Fortnite or Apex. I never tried 'em cause the genre didn't interest me, but I "worried" about it "ruining" a game if it was added on top of other content.
---
After Firestorm hit BFV I realized there's no point in getting worked up about something you don't even have to play.
---
This is exactly what I was expecting when I first heard about the legendary vendor.
---
I’ve bought them to scrap them before
---
Yes!! I’d probably use this one way too much!
---
upvoted because a lot of us know people in the service
---
Wait. What? 
---
So if I have an expert card lvl 3 then no other cards of that same type work? Expert or otherwise? 
---
I never understood the stacking cards. Now I’m super confused about how any cards work. 🤔
---
Then leave a couple unlocked and not all?
---
I don't think Bethesda has any plans to do anything with factions.
---
Would be cool, though.
---
yea it's just one of the random encounters
---
Welcome back.
---
Maybe I lack the imagination, but I just don't see how you can implement a small scale BR without giving everyone the feeling "why does this even exist".
---
^This all day, plus the improved give you more than a 100% repair, they can be handy for break-prone gear
---
i personally use it since im constantly in the fray even as a rifle user.  id rather not risk a leg cripple when im trying to retreat to a better position
---
If their modded maybe
---
I don’t think it is. I couldn’t log into my main character and started a new one. The amount of players who cane up to me to try and be dicks was unbelievable. Players coming up to me and shooting me in the face while I craft etc. These players where not high level players that probably been playing from the start but levels 40/50s. Don’t get me wrong there was a few players who dropped me some really good stuff and these were the high level  players.
---
I keep the cards equipped and just tame everything I can. It's fairly rare. I have server hopped spots I know can have tame-ables and still don't see many.
---
You need to have a weapon that doesn't have a scope, and aim at a creature. If it's tame-able, a prompt will pop up. Cats and such you can just look at, but you have to be closer to do that and they're typically running away when you get too close.
---
Of another player
---
This is on Bethesda, and needs fixing, the settlement attack mechanic should just be removed from adventure mode, it's not fun it's just annoying.
---
Gonna start doing that. It's a solid idea.
---
I want it! Seems like a great way to fit pvp into the weird game spaces they have created.
---
How do I unsubscribe?
---
I would be absolutely thrilled to see a fresh take on battle royale in the fallout universe, speak for yourself bruh.
---
That would be nice. It also shows that the lore about West-Virginia is a bit stupid. Humans won't cross the border into the state and scorchbeasts won't leave? That's a bit unbelievable.
---
I'm no expert, but I play melee with power armor. Knives with swing speed are my primary source of damage, but although I'm a close quarter fighter I still occasionally like to sit back and take out a part of a mob. For that part I use an explosive lever action, and an explosive handmade for the rushing mobs. With you being a sniper, I'd assume you have pushed up your riflemen perks, so you most likely put out a lot more damage than I would. Bloodied build might be a consideration if you spend a lot of time  in a retreat situation. 
---
So, my suggestion would be to find a good, fast knife to assist with points where you get swamped, and as a means of backup. With a bloodied build dealing the majority of the damage at a distance.
---
She’s not dead!  Her and the Sons of Dane went up north for a BBQ.  They’re coming back, they are!
---
Pretty sure I was in on 3 or 4 of them, most of the time I was minding my own business building my camp, going "What? AGAIN?" but you, you have been called, you must answer :P
---
I don't see it. The blade has ridges for texture, but nothing on the wall does. Am I looking at the wrong thing?
---
I agree with you 100%. I don't play survival mode, and I wouldn't play a battle royale mode either. I know that some people are into that, and they're welcome to it, but for me that patch day will be a big zero.
---
I would be much more interested in updates that have a lot of story content, not just PvP or another dungeon. Any time you want to start giving us NPCs for story purposes, Bethesda, you go right ahead.
---
No not that one, the one upstairs at the Whitespring
---
I refuse to visit a camp if someone is just sitting there  even if they 30 weapons. I'm just too awkward. I'll wait and scream at them to leave so I can fly in really quick and hop out before they notice.
---
Here is a map of many spots that might work. It's not perfect but gives a good idea.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn2w5o/thank_you_mappalachia_here_is_my_random_encounter/
---
I thought it was all really lazy and obviously people in a studio
---
All of toons got it, so I recommend it .. a big chunk of damage rolls in when your limbs get crippled and you take more durability damage or so it seems to me at least.
---
Ada.Skel(3) blocker(2-3) and fireproof(2-3)
---
Players sell recipes every day on Reddit. 
---
I was trying to see if they now spawn from anything else since they don't drop from the queen anymore.  Guess I'll be saving more caps then lol
---
I love most of them but the little girls voice for the campfire tales one is awful. She sounds like an old lady. It's the one where she sings, "I'm hunting bugs, I'm hunting bugs..."
---
Makes me cringe every time.
---
You can take a photo with the dead one in the back of a dump truck in the ash heap. The wiki page has 4 varients of alien enemies (alien, lt, commander, star admiral) datamined from the game files. Aliens can drop alien blasters and alien blaster ammo, findable in a couple key spots in-game but primarily from aliens. On top of that, the achievement for kill flatwoods monster and alien are separate- I have killed the flatwoods monster 3x, and have credit on the achievement to kill cryptids, but do not have credit for killing an alien. In addition, the Zetan AI, health level and damage output are all known, firmly implying they have been found and killed multiple times. Of course all of this has been discussed a dozen times on this very subreddit if you're willing to use the search feature and do the research yourself. Some peeps even have screenshots with corpses.
---
I start hitting the jump button right away... I did at one camp spawn inside the porta potty! It made me feel very Maxwell smart Haha.
---
God bless
---
Have any 5mm or 2mm EC?
---
[I use this map](https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png) .. some of the lead nodes in the mire have water next to em enough for 2-3 large extractors don't remember which ones though
---
Different legendary effects have different values.
---
yeah they can only be painted on t-60
---
Unfortunately I don't think there are many hard &amp; fast rules. 3* doesn't mean much unless it's got actually good traits that king of thing.
---
That said I've seen wildly varying prices for similar items. Managed to walk away from one vendor with a max level 3* bolstering sent combat chest for 500. Then you see a level 30 2* hunters whatever somewhere else for 799 &amp; scratch your head a bit. Some legendaries are clearly better served as scrip, once I've maxed out for the day I put my trash ones in at low prices. Still makin more than the 1400k vendor cap at least.
---
I kind of felt better using it also , had it for over 250lvls now lol
---
Raiders cause we get all the chicks .. plus I spend 90% of the time intoxicated and fire wildly into the air when I get excited
---
i think i have the paladin one if it's that one with red paint under the arms
---
I had two people lure a SB to my camp in the mire. Leveled half my camp. I managed to take it down but I need six copper so i message one of them asking if I could buy some copper and the guy just said that I should have my camp in a safer place. It is safe unless people go to my camp from the fissure sight about 300 clicks away. Got no copper. I would’ve paid ten a piece but whatever.
---
Freedom isn't free - but this ammo is.
---
Or a donate components to their total repair bill !! That would be cool af. But they would only be able to use it to repair
---
The keycard is from a random world spawn and took me ages to get. Better off just doing the lvl 1 terminals.
---
Bear in mind also that a *lot* of what we got in WA wasn't actually new content, it was big fixes and QOL improvements. And many would argue that they intended to have Vending Machines from launch and just couldn't get it ready for Beta so released it as a "new feature" in WA. The Camera seems to be in a similar vein given that we already had a fully functional Photomode lol
---
And then there's how generally unfulfilling some of that content was. Lookin at you Burrows. But then again, Ever Upwards is nothing to it either. Just knock out a few challenges and boom you've got a backpack. Grind out a few events and boom, now it's modded. Not exactly a deep batch of content lol
---
Let's look at what we got (and remind me if I miss something significant):
---
• A mediocre "dungeon" (Burrows)
---
• 2 tougher Events (Encryptid and Paradise), and 2 mild Events (Campfire &amp; Free Range)
---
• A handful of very minor quests (Ever Upwards badges, Shear Terror + it's side quests, and the Vintage Nukashine quest + repeatable)
---
Everything else was really more of a feature being added (and really, alcohol brewing is just that as well).
---
So basically each raid just has to add up to about a dungeon + a tough event + a minor quest/event (maybe the raid boss?), and we're basically on par lol. If the Raids require a quest to unlock that'd be a good extra bit there. Plus I'm guessing people will wanna do Raids over and over like they do for Queen Fights, Recall Keycards, and Project Paradise.
---
So weighing what we got against two hopefully much more involved Raids that people can grind out over and over for rewards, well I think it'll probably balance out the same when I look at it from that perspective, and that's *without* them having literally anything else in store for us, which again, I really doubt.
---
I will try all on today! Thx!
---
I was going to last night but no one responded, gonna do it today at some point tho
---
I thought you got a full set of ultracite PA before but not the plans. I didn't have the plans but had the set of armor but I went back to that terminal after the patch and then got the learned plan notification.
---
I had a full set of T-60 BOS VII  up for sale once
---
HUD + Bright Helm
---
Calibrated shocks legs
---
Emergency Protocols chest
---
Optimized Bracers arms
---
someone came by and bought just the helmet.  I lol'd then I cried.  the weight requirement for selling power armor pieces right now is too restrictive. Plus the buyer has to take on that weight unless they brought their own chassis. Also can't sell chassis for them.  All-in-all we need "player vending v2.0 (TM)"
---
Hm, I'm rebuilding my camp. Hang on
---
Lone wolves. Just survivors... looking out for each other and doing what's right.
---
Woohoo! I pacified a frog? Dr. Doolittle can bite me.
---
My friend is moving her camp for this reason. Every time a visitor fast travels in, her big green neighbors respawn. There's actually a good chance of a legendary with each spawn, so it's not all bad, but if she's not in camp they just tear the place up. 
---
Please kill what you spawn.
---
Consider their weight and that they all would stay in your stash.
---
I know, I've been getting these people all day. Total losers!
---
And then you get idiotic low levels who run in and start the experiment when hardly anyone is there...
---
Wait. How do we get serum recipients now then?
---
Aside from them dropping as AA it doesn't really matter for heavy guns. What i really want is that charged barrels would work like tri barrel on minigun for fire rate. 25% mod plus that would be godly amount of dps.
---
thanks mate, love ya
---
People do that all the time, like putting a roll of toilet paper up for 10000 caps. Everyone believes God will send a rich idiot to their vending machines, and it does happen from time to time.
---
YO battle Royale would be fucking dope
---
I'm not sure, I just came back to the game yesterday and I got one
---
I guess you do. I am talking about that square thing. Look closely and you'll see the exact same model of the blade.
---
Kinda like the Free States?
---
Hot take: people act like the Market is oversaturated by Battle Royale game modes when in reality there's only about six of note.
---
Honestly I think some of those are jokes ppl are playing
---
Republic of Dave. Because that's my name. Also, is the best republic to end all republics.
---
Probably TSE Laser Rifle with Beam Splitter
---
These posts are so pathetic. Same thing on the division 2 sub. Nothing but entitlement
---
Oh yeah I completely forgot about this lol
---
Very good, carry on.
---
I’ve played since day 1 of the BETA, just this weekend I got a 3* Bloodied Grogsnak Axe... so that was pretty cool... still haven’t seen a TSE drop for me ever...
---
Nope. But get yourself a headlamp helmet. It’s so much better than the pip-light
---
Like in FO4, mine are purple..not that I know. Maybe on PC. They get all the goods. I'm xbox and have not found anything.
---
For 17,500 caps minimum from Modus!
---
Nope. I've had the same 4 keys for months now haha
---
Nope, they last until you use em to launch.
---
Nah, even that's too organized... and too batshit crazy.
---
Just... good people trying to get by, and doing good by others.
---
Because they have learned from ESO not to get involved in that.
---
Oh you mean like the queen ones? Or the sheepsquatch? Or any other end game event like there is nothing else that gives good XP?
---
Yep, the cam out with armorsmith and weaponsmith in which...Skyrim or Oblivion? The whole emphasis of crafting, upon which FO76 is built, started about 10 years ago.
---
Ouch!
---
And why oh why is everyone using it?
---
where do u find those? I've never seen one 😯
---
Thank u for ur response in general tho!!!
---
More if you have low charisma!
---
Came here to say I just launched a nuke using a keycard I’ve had for a few months.
---
I help new players all the time. And so do most of my friends. I think what might have changed is that people put stuff cheap or free for new people in the vending machines.
---
yeah, again with this, leave one or two of the water purifiers unlocked and sure. golden rule etc.
---
I sell 1*-3* BOS combat armor all types between 200-800 caps depending on what it has and no more. All while seeing many ask 1500+ and up for 1* of the same not even repaired.
---
Yeah, got to go get some for my mule at 20% health, because I can't keep buying mutations and losing them to radaway.
---
I pretty low level (29lvl) and I get high lows helping and dropping plans for me quite often. I think platform and server factors into it alot. I play on PS4 and dont run into many griefers. Now I have met a few groups that were messing around and trolling but not in a dickhead way. I could just be lucky
---
Because it got duped to high hell after the Whitespring bot glitch. Now everyone has them. It does awful things to my game if I'm in close proximity to someone using one. Seems to be mainly a Ryzen issue though
---
well from my standpoint of also being a Battlefield 5 player their battle royale kinda sucks and it seems like a lot of their focus towards the br mode is taking away the main mode which most fans want them to focus on much more. So seeing talk of potential BR mode in this game too is making me worried they might shift too much focus onto a potentially subpar mode nobody really wants or doesn't care about.
---
I used to be the tato bandit.
---
okay? the real reward isnt some garbage legendary that the alpha will drop. if thats all your interested in, go farm uranium fever.
---
If you’re on Xbox I’ll buy the rest of the price is right...
---
Its annoying going to a vendor thinking they have armor and its 5-8 pieces of random power armor lol
---
You can find them in a lot of places. I use a clean miners helmet. But you can definitely find at least one in the Beckley Mine Museum in the south west corner of the map over by the workshop.
---
I'd buy the calibrated shock legs or trade for em if you want them gone lol put a price out and I'll consider!
---
If you go to certain places you can find them easily there's a duffle bag at whitesrings that can spawn a random heavy weapon
---
Why wouldn't it matter for heavy guns?
---
Oh ok
---
Calibrated legs for X-01 would sell pretty well and store them on frames to lower weight.
---
Thank u!!
---
Of course! Good luck! I really recommend using one. The white directed light is much better than the noxious green glow.
---
Were they rare though? It seemed like they were dropping pretty regularly from the queens prior to that patch.  I still think they should drop as a quest reward, but with a low, low drop rate.
---
You can also do shorchedbeasts if you're really lucky
---
Yep people constantly suggested here that they should receive the loot for just being around the event and not need to fire a single shot. It’s a video game but it’s a good snapshot of the world today. A few hard workers are carrying the weights of a freeloader society.
---
Definitely going to try this.
---
She ranks up there as "one of the morally best characters in the entire series"
---
&gt;Otherwise the store owner might block you
---
How are you going to know who spawned the enemies? You won't see thier name unless they make a purchase. Be glad they made a purchase.
---
The only way you'll see them if they don't purchase is if you're sitting at camp to see them. Maybe try being a be a good shop owner and clear the mobs.
---
Also I personally only leave the mobs if your a dick who sets up a kill shop or your machines are either not in obvious locations or behind locked doors. 
---
Sell all non-legendary weapons and armor yeah I'm leaving whatever spawned you deserve it for wasting my time.
---
You can't imagine people enjoying competing and killing each other?... Think of it like just another event, another interesting optional thing to participate in if you want a change of pace.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I have a ghoul Slayer gamma gun for 25k lol.
---
Great site. A mutants explosive is if course going to be better. Remember sometimes that 2nd shot doesnt hit / register. Does better ADS, but something to consider.
---
When I log into my alts.. I always have high levels show up and offer team and give me plans, weapons, aid, aormor and ammo. I try to tell them I'm  good this is an alt but they want to help. I can say I have ran into more helpful people..
---
I have this same issue. There’s an enemy spawn point that is a good distance across a dried river bed where a super mutant will spawn and start sniping my roof despite my VATS having trouble locking due to how far he is.
---
Don't put any doors or windows and enter your camp by removing a wall with your build menu.
---
There was one mounted outside the clothes store right  to the left across the bridge on the way to diamond city
---
Most likely jokes. Lol I did have the ones with awesome specials priced higher and then I lowered. I can scrap them I just dont have luck getting a amazing melee or range i get pitchfork that does 20% damage to animals well wtf don't need that lol
---
Click the subscribe button again.
---
Lol downvoted cause why?
---
Oh I know that I keep the ones i want.
---
Great write-up. Valid points all of them, except #1.  I shoot her in the air all the time and with OGA it causes her to stop flying around and around and dive-bombing if I get lucky.  Usually that's followed up by her landing so the real DPS can hit her with their paws and claws.
---
Yeah there's the size of combat area. But I was also thinking weapons and gear, actually I was thinking mainly that. 
---
Bring your own, vs. use only what you find and loot in the area. 
---
Somehow I don't think they will make a mode with flat start everyone, so you will be able to use your own existing gear and that will be quite not BR.
---
I meant like the spoiled vegies..lol
---
3-4 random spots for me and anyone travelling to me, moving the camp object makes no difference!
---
Maybe, it's been a while lol. I just know I have a set and I know the plans
---
Does tenderizer work? Does it stack? I've been equiping it, since everyone doing 7% more damage would help a lot on these battles, but I don't know for sure if it works.
---
What they need to do is scale damage given into the rewards. Once you do that everyone will unload.
---
Do every freakin legendary I kill gives me a legendary broadsider it was cool at first now its getting old because some of them are cool so I keep them and now I have like 5.
---
I think Nuclear Winter will probably be the faction-based PvP Bethesda hinted at. Personally, I don't enjoy PvP in 76 so I'm disappointed Bethesda continues to pursue this part of the game. The Wild Appalachia content has been a ton of fun for the most part, so here's hoping this will be a small part of Nuclear Winter and we'll get more quests/events on par with what they've been releasing.
---
Guess I’m really lucky then
---
With 3* hard bargain an grape mentats, I think it goes down to 18000 caps (possibly lower of higher lvl) 
---
If you sold what you made with same perks above to vendors at 450 a piece, you’d get 1350 back daily and would need to do this daily for 12+ days. 
---
After that it’s all profit! 
---
Market seems flooded right now but look before you buy!!!! I see many for 1000 caps or more for just a serum and they sell! I sell the ones I can make at 300-400. 
---
Still making caps!
---
Praaaaaise the loord and pass the ammunition
---
wow 222 caps at my place.... not that rare
---
Which is funny because it's against the rules of this sub, but there are like 10 threads on this rumor now.
---
I like vendor bot Wallace, too bad his counterpart in WS isn’t as interesting.
---
I have found some really good weapons..
---
Not rare, actually, kind of useless without the right builds
---
5mm
---
Doesn't the Missile Silo Holotape tell you how much time is left for each silo before it can be used?
---
I grind for what I have.  I've gotten some really nice weapons and armor that I didn't keep because it wasn't of a high enough level.  
---
I hate to break it to you but we get hosed once in a while because of what level creature drops the item.  
---
Wanting a way to adjust this isn't wrong.  Since the daily cap for scrip is 150 you have to grind out 150 scrip just bring a weapon up one level tier is pretty fair.  150 scrip to go from a level 1 to a level 5 weapon or a level 10 to a level 20 weapon.  That's a pretty steep cost and you have to choose if you want to go a new item or upgrade your current one.
---
The idea is to reduce the grind just a little bit and grant us just a little more freedom in how we play.
---
Wow, only 3 3\*s, how disappointing.
---
leave one or two water purifiers unlocked and everything that spawns dies, even if there was no water. if you are nice then i am nice.
---
Cool, brt!
---
So have I when there a decent price I'll snatch them up. Just not paying 12000 for a 1 star 15% damage reduction against energy weapons lol
---
The same way you accomplish anything in this game, go there and server hop till your eyes bleed
---
Wrong. Stagger effects cause her to hover longer. You can actually watch this in game.  She'll start to wind up her scream and the stagger will reset it until she finally flys or gets enough of a window to scream. The biggest reason though is you waste a lot of ammo trying to hit a moving flying target vs waiting and shooting her while stationary. Once she lands vats her wings to keep her grounded.
---
I am. And I can remake the helmet np.  Send me a msg on live, since they don't want trading on this sub.
---
Just curious why do people use VATS in melee? You’re standing right next to your enemy yet you still use aimbot, wouldn’t that be actually slower? what’s the strategy behind this?
---
otherewise, empty threat that cant actually be backed up. r/iamverybadass material
---
Yeah I'm on PS4 and it's like. Bethesda let consoles do shit challenge
---
That is good news haha. I play solo so it took a while to keep one of them b*stards on the Same side of the map to shoot it out the sky
---
6 open purifiers are enough for helping low level players or even a friendly group. I have a junk extractor and is the only thing that i locked, but now that i'm rich of materials i'm going to unlock it.
---
Tenderizer works. Suppresor works. Doesnt stack. Cryolators also slow her. Making her melee attacks much slower and she stays on the ground longer.
---
Wrong. I've been in many many a fight and the rhythm is sound. She doesn't stay in the air for long. I know when to shoot her and how to interrupt her flight.
---
Funnily enough, ESO had zone voice chat first (console only)
---
That would be the raider den you ended up farming all the time for various quets. 
---
I don't remember the type of those turrets but yeah there was some turrets in front. So yeah it was in F4 like the other guy said too.
---
Only for bugs.. and the wolfs.. etc.. just the tiny quick things..
---
It looks like the Atom Shop trick sometimes works in Adventure mode, but it definitely doesn't work in survival mode :( (still trying to get a goddamned photo in a storm)
---
I agree. If OP can give us real hard numbers then we can talk about it, but he's either glitching or exaggerating.
---
The only way this could be fixed is if the building is preloaded before you've fast travelled!
---
The quest log could also use like a recently completed or a "live feed" so you can see which ones you finished recently and what rewards you obtained from them
---
Yeah I found I have to set the price at 25000 if I really want to keep something because I had some radscorp stingers stored for crafting with a random three digit price and some guy bought them. I was happy to have a few thousand caps but it took me ages to gather 8 stingers out of the ten I need.
---
Sadly it's the bolt action and not the revolver
---
Your Mom has launched a nuke
---
Mike Hawk is wanted!
---
I kill and repair the camp if any damage was done. It just seems the right thing to do if my presence brought the beasts
---
Are you my great great great great grandfather from 269 years ago?
---
The thing is that there are very few main missions which would make the “main mission” log for missions feel empty. So it would make sense for main missions, but not side missions and events though. That’s just my thought, would love to hear the others’ thoughts too!
---
Once both her wings are crippled, does she stay on the ground for the rest of the fight?
---
You still looking for these plans?
---
We found it can be done with 2 players and keep all three alive. The key is no one else show up. If you leave A alone and don't shut down the experiment, the robots will handle the mobs that show up to kill the level 0 tick there. Then one on C and B defends. I finished this quest solo once too. If solo stay in A, but you probably have to be stealth. At the end robots will show up, but they end up fighting the sheep and trash. You can focus dps on the sheep.
---
That’s me but at my own camp. I always set up in the cranberry bog and mirelurks, mutants, and ghouls will just randomly smack on my camp while I’m doing something inside. I usually don’t notice until lots of damage has been done
---
some location are buggy similar to the location challenge (discover x location in x region)
---
Yeah serums are the best way imo to get your daily vendor caps. The recipes I bought before were 2-3k ish each but that was months ago.
---
Lol, no, it's more fun to lead enemies to your camp and then take off
---
Lol, OP must be psychic
---
BR fits quite well into the theme of everyone for themselves scavenging a post-apocalyptic world and trying to be the last man standing.  Whether or not you want BR, they can absolutely easily fit it into the game as a mode that would not only make sense, but might even be fun.  
---
Fallout games were actually NEVER about storyline over anything else.  They were about exploration and figuring out what kind of person you would be in a post apocalyptic world.  Every single Fallout game -- story has been a short side piece and where people spend the least of their time.    Even if Fallout games where the story was more fleshed out (F4, New Vegas (this was not Bethesdas doing) and F3), it was still a short blip on the life of most gamers playtimes.  
---
Regardless, Survival wasn't for everyone and it was fine.  They have a team working on PvP because lots of people like that.  They also clearly have a team working on PvE so there will be something for everyone.
---
Hippity hoppity get off my property
---
It actually can be very misleading. I came across vendors that were loaded with possible duped stuff, like several identical legendary explosive guns, yet the owner was obviously a level 2 alt. If i saw their level on the map I wouldn’t bother coz I thought they be selling level 1 pipe pistols.
---
Or the east. DC refugees.
---
I think I'm going to throw in the towel on selling legendaries. I got a level 50 junkie's explosive gatling, which I don't know what to do with. I know it's a pretty lousy 2\* but I looked at what people were buying it for on the market sub, and it looked like a few similar weapons sold recently, going for over 1000 caps (some people are into the junkies stuff). I tried to give it away to several posters here who turned out to have better versions and rightly-, and kindly-, passed on it. I could sell it for 200 caps but I just figure they'll turn around and sell it on the market, which is fine and all, but it just seems like feeding brokers.  There's nothing really wrong with that but it bothers me for some stupid reason (I know it's not rational).
---
I don't have enough play time to become a market trader myself, nor any real desire to bother with that, and I just want to give it someone who'll actually get some use out it. 
---
I think I'm going to trade it in for scrip, and just vend non-legendary stuff.
---
You'll be able to do both fairly easily with a similar build. Try both out and see what you like better.
---
I see what you're saying but it costs nothing to repair things at my camp.
---
I even have a perk card that cuts down on this.
---
But I mean is it really that much to hit "repair all"?
---
Fence repair for me are 1 wood. So I can repair if every fence is broke for like 20 wood. That's nothing lol.
---
Ikr
---
Lmao “nah man, let him have whatever he wants”
---
What’s your GT?
---
17.5 is the absolute lowest price for the recipe,and 500 is the max sell price to the robo vendors.
---
Well, i disagree. How many times does this happen? I doubt very often and believe the positives still overweigh the cons by far.
---
Lol you can't hit ANYTHING in vats with melee right now.
---
There's a separate, invisible lockout on top of that that prevents the same player from launching nukes.
---
The Palace of the Winding Path in the far North is beautiful, and it's usually fairly empty of enemies. There's a cave in the Savage Divide called Wendigo Cave that has amazing use of lighting and atmosphere. Camp Adams in the South of the Forest is a neat place to spend the night, and the bunkers that are scattered throughout The Mire are tiny patches of horror surrounded by an amazingly dark and tilted swamp. Lots of fun places, it's a game that rewards you for walking everywhere
---
I am mainly selling plans and recipies. As I don't know the market prices for the stuff I usually  choose to offer them for half the price the game proposes. Recipies usually go for 20 caps. All my spare ammo will go for free in the vending machine. Which is basically everythig I find as I play a melee build. 
---
I am always looking for camp plans in other players' vending machines, and I was already able to get some plans. Until now I did not yet find a decent piece of armor for me, but I guess most of them go straight to the srib machine.
---
Yeah, some of the most fun I've had with this game has involved these frantic "hat tricks" where you do 3 SBQs back-to-back.
---
same as my reddit name. I'll edit the main post.
---
If anyone is going to get one, just make sure you check what’s needed to make them and choose accordingly... 
---
Some need some rarer ingredients to make so will take some more time.
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Sweet! Appreciate it!
---
Well, it's the same texture(s) more or less but what the guy who posted the picture should of said is that it's the same model as well as the textures.
---
Swapping perks is just fine, you need to be careful, and the weight is just fine too.
---
 I have a friend who plays my Steam Fallout 4 game and I cannot watch him as he cannot leave anything, and is in panting mode all the time. Its fucking horrible. 
---
 I run a real tight ship with my CAMP, and supplies etc and I do not need to go beyond normal carry, with some buffs sometimes, to do what I need to do. Neither do you. ;)
---
Yeah, I tried that. Never works. The daily is permanently on cooldown for me. I ended up making two new characters and making a beeline straight there from the vault, worked perfectly for them. It feels like that's been broken since the beta for me, I think it's like the explore locations atom challenges I can't do either because I discovered them before the challenges were a thing.
---
As long as the best reward is the legendary drop from killing the boss, we will all continue to not care about a few heads of Brahmin.
---
This is again a challenge today so fucking done with shit like this boycott challenges !!!
---
Where abouts at WS? I’ll check it out...
---
I can’t DM you and I don’t want to throw my tag publicly.
---
Rifle made a video about this event, and shutting down ARIC-4 is different from what you said. You have to initialize the event first, otherwise the engineer terminal won't have the option. Select the option (sorry, forgot what is says), then the terminal where you initialized the experiment will have the option to shut down. That is all.
---
Im from the days of future past, son. I came here to warn you. The machines will take over the world, shortly after creating the biggest nuclear holocaust ever seen by mankind... and at its spearhead was the artificial sentient entity, that learned to think for itself... reddit.
---
Im here to tell you, you have to kill Reddit at any cost. Everyone with high karma will be a machine instated human governer of the low karma slaves. My son, you have only one option: Gain as much Karma as you can and destroy Reddit from within.
---
Trashpost, Shitpost, Steal, Clickbait and use any trick necessary. You will find help in /u/GallowBob, he is another agent from the past of a future that hopefully never be and trained as a shitposter for decade before he was sent back to this reality to try and be kind of all machine instated governors, to influence the unlimited entity of Reddit and destroy it with your help.
---
I have to go now, but we will see each other again, in a few hundred years when you will rule over this world as the Karma-King.
---
Edit: Jokes aside, we both are here for around 3 years, with the same name indipendent of each other and just separated by an upper/lower case letter and the following number. Fucking weird man :D
---
You can spruce your camp w lights and cardboard cutouts of Vault boy all you want but you're better off making a camp with impenetrable walls. What I wanna know is why are ppl locking their doors?? Why?? What's in there? You afraid I'll rummage thru your.. My.. Stash? That I'll ruin your work bench? Get mud on your couch? You afraid I'll untune your guitar? Don't be a jerk an leave out a bench.. Tinker's bench will do.
---
You can just do a work bench repair
---
Before it was all about getting rid of weight and you couldn't sell them to vendors so they were essentially worthless. Now they're taking up space in a vending machine with limited slots that takes me time to load them into. So I put them in for something around 25 caps (except that ivory grip plan; that's 24999 if anyone wants it) unless it's a rare drop plan.
---
Oh i see, thanks, never tried that before.
---
Has anyone tried to get launch codes without looking it up??? 
---
I haven’t, just wondering if anyone takes the time to figure it out.
---
I disagree.  As long as there was a "free" way to get them, having a vendor that sold them for 18K a whack was a weird thing, especially before player vending was added and it was very time consuming to earn that many caps to begin with.  You'd feel like a total chump having spent 2 weeks worth of cap collection on something that could drop for free.
---
I never got a recipe from the SBQ, though, and I suspect it's because you probably had to get past all those damn Prime Receivers before you had a chance at it. 😋
---
I tried to repair it in my weapons work bench, but it’s requiring a repair kit
---
You don't need them.  You're doing it wrong
---
I found a camp yesterday that had locked doors, but a big open space at the back, on the very edge of a cliff. The layout was so convoluted and nonsensical, and it was hard to find their vendor. I carefully navigated my way inside, opened all their shutters, and dropped two gold ore on the floor in their bedroom just to let them know they couldn't keep me out. :3
---
You don’t have to use them. Take a deep breath.
---
It’s a different button now go back to the bench and read the bottom
---
You don’t need them to repair anything. You get them from SBG, project paradise, and imposter sheep events. They are a convince thing to repair your gear without a bench like when your at a queen fight.
---
Already know, I state that in the comment. Would like it officially since Bethesda doesn't like mods it seems nowadays.
---
Online games thrive on daily challenges most of the ones I’ve played ( free of charge unlike 76) has cosmetics fully achieve-able challenges and stuff to gain currency unlike this game that literally forces you to buy if you want something
---
Would like to know what bos armor you're selling. Would possibly be I interested in ones with +1 strength
---
Camp fire tales are meant to be... well, campy. You should expect there to be a level of cheese in any story told that way.
---
Vats can let you teleport several feet to your target as melee as well
---
Lmao I was just thinking about that the other day.
---
From my experience, 90% of the time, yes.  She will usually stay grounded until she does a her heal, then you gotta re-cripple.  Sometimes she will go back up even crippled but usually comes back down pretty fast.
---
You may not have the required mats?
---
Ok, good to know. What’s the right way?  Not that it will help me now because all my batteries in the house are dead
---
like recovery said, they changed the buttons around when crafting
---
Did you ever fail the athletics badge races? He's got a lot of custom audio when you fail that's amazing.
---
"You failed! And if you failed... that means I failed, *and mother hates a failure!"*
---
Not sure how often, I’ve run into several times when low level players (2-20) were selling a bunch of max level stuff.
---
But it still is a texture, because a model without texture is shit
---
Yeah, i just want my light to be basic white. This isn't The Matrix.  
---
...or is it? DUNN DUNNN DUNNNNNNNNN.
---
Eh, at this point we are both making too many assumptions, it would probably be best to wait until they release more info on things.
---
I didn’t like that feature in ESO.  It’s too cluttered.  I would prefer just character name but I can see the reasons why they use our user names instead.
---
wow is that what it’s supposed to do or a glitch?
---
You can still repair the same way at a workbench if you have the materials, although the buttons are different now, or you can use a repair kit with no material cost. 
---
Improved repair kits drop from SBQ event and maybe some other events, not 100% sure. Basic kits are only from atom shop
---
Basic kits repair to 100%
---
Improved kits repair to 150%
---
You can tell the actor had a lot of fun with that character.
---
All my batteries are dead- going to have to wait for Tuesday. It’s a three day weekend, I’ve opted not to shower and clear room on my dvr. Public appearances aren’t in the cards today
---
This backfired for me today, I spawned at a camp near the behemoth and killed it from the guys house and he got mad at me.  He began to try and pvp me and all I did was kill an enemy near his camp.  I also clean out the camps I travel to if there is enemies near.
---
I’m a hoarder, so I definitely have the materials
---
Heavy guns have enough firepower that 12% from stabilised doesn't matter. Problem is only with them dropping as AA legendary since it wastes a slot.
---
You will finish all content without hardships with no legendary heavy energy build. If you get bloodied/junkies/two shot/furious/executioners and then the fire rate one enemies drop easily. Yeah. 50cal will outdps you, but if you consider how much ammo it will use up i will stick with energy guns.
---
What i want are viable mod options cause right now they matter very little or are just plain awful. Hell plasma thrower should have been a gatling plasma mod not plasma gun mod.
---
I want seasonal weather. But i guess there's no such thing when it's always October 23.
---
Lol I understand, either way, you don’t have to use a repair kit, just do the workbench repair, you can also get kits in game by doing queen fights.
---
I've done it once on my own. Then used the internet for the rest.
---
The people who work with Nuka-Crypt do.
---
The thing is, even if you know the basic process, there's enough trial-and-error involved trying to figure out the scrambled cipher word that I don't imagine many players try.  That's why some nuclear codes are late in coming, because even the players who manually figure it out have to wait and see what the first letter is.
---
I'd be surprised if they did. I'm sure they did originally but now I wouldn't be surprised if people didn't do it anymore.
---
Online. Group effort....
---
Oh thank god. I’m level 49 and never participated in a nuke event or queen fight.
---
I think mine went up to 495 but we can only sell 2 so I only use hard bargain maxed to sell 3 for 1350.
---
Someone has to figure out the nuke codes each week. It's not like Bethesda releases them and shares with the community, or dataminers find the codes. The people who post the nuke codes have to have had someone run them down, there used to be a group specifically for it
---
I loved the way Diablo 3 had Legendary crafting as well as rerolling an aspect.  I've would love to see something similar implemented for this game. Kind if an interesting parallel, because D3 had a ton of issues when it launched, but it eventually became an awesome game over time.
---
That... is a great idea.  
---
...and will probably be patched soon. XD
---
I want to learn just to learn so that’s what my plan is after the codes reset this week.
---
Oh ya, absolutely, sorry, just got into discussion mode and rambled
---
Memorial Day is about honouring those who died in battle, not those who’re currently in service.
---
All of the mutation recipes have really trivial components.
---
The rarest one is Ultracite and, of course, the flux for it. But they're really trivial. It's somehow more complex to make mixed drinks in the new DLC..... Corpse Seed Juice? Seriously?
---
Build turrets? They usually kill anything at my camp except scorch beasts.
---
I just would like to learn how to do it myself, I’m not in a rush but I do want to learn how to do this. Could be a nice challenge!
---
"Because duping" is a horrible reason not to implement something good. Fix the duping, eh?
---
Jesus, you whiney mf's are so caught up on that one detail in this post.
---
 Yes there are obviously players that want this garbage, so it looks like I do not in fact speak for everyone. The majority seems to agree with me though, so let it go.
---
I believe it's intended (used to be something you could choose in fo4)
---
Lol.. it was the first Battle Royale game most people ever played. The only BR that preceded it that was even near as popular was PUBG, and Fortnite blew it out the water by bringing that formula to consoles. Fortnite was so popular that it became watercooler talk. Shit, I went to the mall last week and I noticed five stores with Fortnite branded T-Shirts prominently displayed. It is not a game I ever enjoyed playing too much, but it was definitely a pioneer in its genre
---
+25 radiation resistance during rad storms.
---
I’m going to try and do it after the codes change to maximize the time I have and try it out! Could be a nice game challenge!
---
Perfect
---
Nothing has changed.
---
I use the free ones from Scorched Earth, they basically replace themselves.
---
I just took a photo of it and I got the credit!
---
Agreed. Add a little more than the normal grind!
---
I've done it a couple times the way described in the guide below but honestly I doubt I will bother the next time.   
---
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaUl4-kVH53KdwAvBBWvnETBby6R98pAF0iIvgPsogE/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaUl4-kVH53KdwAvBBWvnETBby6R98pAF0iIvgPsogE/edit)
---
Right, I’m just wondering how long and what it takes for a player to do it from scratch... I’m going to try after the code reset this week.
---
It's the 900-hour guy.
---
I think most of not all need ultracite but like scaly skin needs 4 coal I think or ones that need cobalt flux which all depends on where players drop nukes.
---
Still got the blueprint?
---
I’ll check this out thanks! I just want to be able to know how to do it and do it myself then I’ll go back to nuking the regular old fashion way...lol
---
Happy cake day, I completely disagree
---
Some MMOs have an auction house/trading post in which all players buy and sell their wares...
---
If you're having trouble with coal: any mine or load baring / mother lode in the Ash Heap. There are also coal nodes near Whitespring and you also get it from powering up Mt. Blair. :)
---
And they're all the same game
---
If you only just started I would hang on to them. You open them up in your menu and they'll show you a location you need to find. Once there you look for a mound of dirt on the ground and dig it up. They will give you items as well as plans for power armors etc. Once you've hit late game they aren't as important but they are still worth in my opinion. Plus it's something fun to do with your group.
---
Between tennis court and swimmingpool area - almost in front of the gate down to the driving range
---
I've thought about devoting a vending machine to newbies from the Vault, stocking it with various crafted goods for free or nearly free, but the thing is, where does one put it?  I like where I am in the middle of the Savage Divide and don't want to move for my own convenience, but no newbie would ever come here.  And there are often so many CAMPs that are often placed around the Overseer's CAMP that I'd run into server conflicts.
---
I  would suggest melee you can run around and tank everything or you can sneak and one hit everything.
---
It's only considerate to kill things when you pop by someone's camp. I even repair anything broken after killing anything that spawns, just good manners
---
Yeah most common plans are still worthless. The only common plans people regularly buy from me are armor plans and armor mod plans. Especially for trapper. Also the more expensive camp plans, cause I'm selling them for 49 caps not what the robots ask. 
---
My favorite people are the ones that price legendary stuff for in game base prices. I snagged three 3s melee weapons from someone this morning for about 100-200 caps each. They're decent but they'll be scrip because I'm not sitting on them for a couple hundred caps resale profit.
---
It's probably that people are more tuned into their gameplay after a patch, looking for changes. If you were recording real numbers (30 seconds isn't giving you a 25% decay rate, that's ridiculous) you'd probably see where your own gameplay was changing things.
---
Oh god yes
---
I would uninstall launcher, then download a program called "ccleaner" run it and have it delete all the files left by the launcher. Then install it again. Might be a corrupted file
---
My camp is right next to a high level deathclaw spawn so I've built a lot of turrets. They usually do most of the work and as long as they tag it, I can always loot it when I get to my camp.
---
Contempt?
---
ooo, that's a good idea.
---
What's even better for my build is I use instigating The Dragon, then quickly change over to exacutioner's The dragon ;)
---
I see. U make a good point
---
Funny how we joined so close to eachother. You have a lot more karma than me though!
---
I always keep a bat with me for the low level mobs. Like to mix it up a bit
---
Only if they have good deals. If i see pipe pistols and raider armor hell i might go bring more
---
Oh man, that sucks.
---
Thank you! I will let him know to give it a try.
---
Great tips for someone who hasn’t killed her yet. 
---
Thanks dude
---
End-game ups and downs
---
Shotgun:
---
\+ You can get a hit on targets before they die, in contrary to melee.
---
\+ Enforcer perk's staggering and crippling very good, because each shell count as a chance of triggering the perk.
---
\+ VATS Shotgun damage is really good for a ranged weapon.
---
\- Very limited range for max damage; damage drop-off is very sudden
---
\- You might get melee'd easier than with rifles and you can't block.
---
\- Short range
---
\- Small clip size
---
Melee:
---
\+ Best damage with such a fast rate of damage
---
\+ A single swing can kill max lvl Super Mutants and other casual monsters.
---
\+ Cheap to repair
---
\+ No ammo consumption
---
\+ Only weapons to gain damage increase from a skill.
---
\- You might not get exp/loot from NPCs if they are killed fast by other ranged players.
---
\- No AoE damage, only one target at once
---
\- Risk of dying fast from melee combat
---
\+/- Simple and easy playstyle
---
We do this at least once a week. No. The food and water drain are the same rate since launch day.
---
So weird happened to me last night when I was doing silo run solo. I noticed getting into my power armor would tell me I became over encumbered even though I hadn't, had no effects of being over encumbered either. I died because a 3 star legendary assaultron was non stop spamming laser beam with no cooldown or wind up just instantly blasting me anytime it found me. When I went to respawning the only option I had was white springs golf club, not my camp or even vault 76. I'm betting the big has to do with backpacks and power armor and the interaction that removes the backpack when you equip the PA.
---
amen brother.  You sum it up well.  I made head over and grab that ivory grip plan....lol
---
i did nothing else than visit vending machines for 2 days straight and never experienced that. don't say that i don't believe you. but still believe it's very very very rare.
---
I have speed demon and marsupial for 300. GT is the same as my reddit name.  I also have the tourist at the miner monument just west of my camp in case you still need a camera.
---
Thanks! I keep a few on hand to make them if anyone wants them.
---
I say let them make more mistakes. Maybe after enough screw ups they will make what the player base wants instead of chasing old trends in the hopes of getting kids to play.
---
.....Probably not but one can dream.
---
Thanks, I’ll check it out!
---
I have 5 water purifiers, unlocked, decon shower (even added a switch on the outside for the people that don’t run with Starched Genes), have crops up for grabs, my vending machines are right on the porch, and people still let critters attack my base.  😞.
---
I typically price any 1\* legendary weapon at 100 caps in my vendor store. 2\* legendary are priced at 300 caps, while 3\* are priced at 800 caps. I base this on my philosophy that a random 3\* legendary weapon from the Purveyor (melee or ranged) should cost a player 2000 caps. At 100 scrip for any random 3\* legendary weapon, that works out to 2000 caps for 100 scrip, or 20 caps per scrip. 
---
I do the same pricing on legendary armor as well, 20 caps per scrip. That means a 1\* armor is priced at 60 caps. A 2\* legendary armor is 180 caps, while a 3\* legendary armor is 480 caps.
---
I do some exceptions for pricing on some selected items, but generally my pricing is pretty consistent with my pricign philosophy.
---
I am on PC BTW.
---
Need the camera too. Alright I’ll add you and join your world. Thanks
---
I'd love this. Even more, I'd love a "Sorry" emote. I accidentally forgot to take off certain perks the other day and one-shot a legendary before a dude could tag it. I felt so bad. :(   If you're here Mr. Rumple, I'm sorry.
---
With a shielded enclave underarmor, I actually carry more than in PA. ☺
---
They break super fast, I can’t imagine anyone use them for boss fights or any large crowd. I don’t do pvp so I haven’t got killed by one or killed anyone with mine. I thought you could use Fireproof and other perks to negate the explosions?

Stabilized gives 45% armor pen that is huge, why would you think that doesn't matter?
---
Not any more. “Terminated management” no longer produces Legendaries. Did it several times this week....nothing.
---
Get the upgrade and it goes to 120!
---
How do they get their recipes? If MODUS is the only source, they must be spending a lot of caps.
---
Agreed 100%! Or at least music you would hear on a normal jukebox
---
My store is right outside Watoga station. I face the station, on it's South side. I have had people kite over scorchbeasts from Survey Camp Alpha, and also the Mirelurk Queen who lives behind me. Also anyone who hasn't done Mayor For A Day and comes to my camp via exploring Watoga, brings a whole town of Assaultrons and protectrons with them.
---
The last I can put up with and understand, my place serves as a refuge and that's cool. But kiting a scorchbeast over to decimate my camp for funsies? Fuck that noise!

Its always that assaultron dominator spamming eye laser

The map has lots of places where, if the player walks there, certain events will occur. One such event are enemies fighting each other.
---
damn im sorry
---
It's never going to happen. You would need employees there to monitor the chat, and the game just isn't profitable enough to justify paying somebody money to do so.
---
Damn, that's a shame. I hope our cursed characters will be fixed one day.

I always kill them and repair turrets if I can
---
Heh. That one is seriously bad, but I can't help but laugh every time it comes on.
---
No problem! The tourist is lying on the steps just below the statue and is wearing jeans and a t shirt.  Can't miss him.
---
I don’t normally travel to shop around, only visit a vendor if they happen to be close to where I was. Those I saw were all near Whitespring. There were also level 200+ players selling all non-legendary stuff like combat shotguns and miner gauntlets. It’s just very random and hard to tell just by looking at player levels.
---
Haha. Yes.... auto correct.
---
At worst, this "pushes" one bit of scheduled content down the line. People will be complaining that the game isn't updated anymore at some point, at least this would extend the life of the game a bit. Plus if it attracts more players, it's more likely the game will be supported longer. Win/No Lose
---
I’ve dumped stuff at the overseers camp all week.
---
My, how far they've come. 
---
I swear half the NPCs in Oblivion were voiced by the same person. Certainly felt that way!
---
I would appreciate this as well.
---
Servers don't work like that in Fallout 76. All servers are virtualized. There are no local servers for this game, they use AWS. Hat to say it but it probably your imagination (confirmation bias?) if you think VPN gives you better load times. Virtual servers let you play with people all over the world seamlessly.
---
Every damn day..... its a common build, that makes those guns 1-2 shots. Most players that use them are not players I really want to be around anyway.
---
Seems someone bought all the speed demon. Oh well least I got marsupial. Thanks again
---
I used to play ESO, and I'd see this all the time.
---
"I started playing a week ago, and I'm level 50, but there's no content in this game."
---
No content? ESO has more content, quests, and NPCs than most games combined. But so many people have been trained that they have to power level through games as fast as they can that they ultimately skip everything to get to the end game, then feel cheated when realize they've missed out on everything.
---
Sometimes the journey is just as important as the destination.
---
that’s amazing, I’ll have to give it a try. So you just VATS something like 20 meters away and hit it, you’re suddenly right next to it and your hit will register?
---
Still doesn't help that the community turns so quickly on their own :/
---
Exactly what I was looking for, Thanks!
---
I think people are still super helpful! I leave plans aid and ammo all the time at overseers and all the train stations and every time I’m on my low level alts people come and give me radaway and stuff!! People are nice all the time
---
But people who really like the game and don’t want to worry about others should be able to play and have a good time just like everyone else. It’s just like gta online. Some like it, some hate it, but they can all enjoy the game
---
Ok, Its entirely possible It is bias BUT
---
The server I often load into is the same one, as my neighbor camp, whom is almost always on, is usually there.
---
Its also takes forever to load my camp every time on that server.
---
Now if I VPN to another location, many times my camp loads much quicker.....
---
Why is that Batman? Is it client side issue? I have a stable 300Mbps connection.
---
Any ideas?
---
Easy solution to all the bitching about traps that I've seen posted elsewhere: fast travel mats work only for camp owners. And visitor arrival positions are based so they spawn just outside the camp radius, on solid ground and the area is determined by the direction the camp module is facing. So owners can spawn themselves wherever it's most convenient. While they can also, somewhat, control where visitors spawn, but can't spawn them in a trap or unsafe area since they'll spawn outside the build radius.
---
Its your fault for thinking downvotes have something to do with liking the person. Its so that someone doesnt look at this thread and see your comment and think that this is something thats actually happening. This post in general should have negative votes so that no one sees it.
---
I was involved in a recent SBQ fight and she went down surprisingly fast. I used a Furious Auto Grenade Launcher and about 200 rounds...now that's a lot of damage. It might have been on Saturday, it all kind of blends together.
---
Sounds very consistent with Whitesprings 🙂
---
"This is Grahm's Favorite Kind of Meat!!!"
---
I’m a L90 melee
---
What I’ve found so far - 
---
Two handed melees do more damage than 1H - except perhaps for mole miner gauntlet and deathclaw gauntlet, which you cant use when you are in PA - but are generally slower than 1 hand melee weapons.  
---
To that end, a fast 1H melee with lower damage numbers may actually kill faster than a slower 2h melee w/ higher numbers, especially in a horde/mob.
---
Heath regen from vampire weapons (BTW, there is a non-legendary Assaultron Blade that regens health - called The Gutter) is quite beneficial.
---
U really thought you had something here
---
They're Sterile love not eunuchs.
---
na just having fun
---
As said, I did nothing other for the last 2 days. Still, i believe this add would be helpful for many reasons. Also informative and helpful when getting team invites. However, i respect your opinion, as everyone can have his own. Although sometimes can differ from mine.
---
I found mine at the top of the map at the water park. As soon as you fast travel there walk forward and leaning on a car on your right should be the tourist
---
Which server?
---
Why would you fast travel if it shows nothing?
---
I do pretty well in Summerville lake area. Big visible dock restaurant/bar next to the bridge. I move some bobbleheads but only if they're around 40 caps or if they're melee or small/big guns then I can get 75.
---
I find that server hopping every hour does well to increase exposure.
---
Well if I go 2 handed I actually have a vampire swing speed pole hook thats actually really nice
---
My teammate and I have bought one so far and sell bird bones at 440 caps each.
---
Straight up... my buddy and I started new characters yesterday... came across a 61 - I expected everything but him following us 'helping'. I mean, I totally get they thought they were being helpful, but I got these level 5 Protectrons and Mole Rats in the bag... Most low levels do...
---
I run a similar build rifle / melee for back up, no power armor. If you can get your hands on an instigating lever action it will be a game changer for you.
---
More than perked excavator?
---
I had a hard time getting the tourist as well.  I finally got him server hopping at the giant teapot.  I hope this helps
---
I'm shy 5 antiseptic. If you give me some I'll make you a speed demon for 250.
---
I got mine at the land view light house. It's at the top.
---
I just like seeing other people’s camps. Honestly I typically walk everywhere and try to find groups of camps and just explore between them.
---
Okay
---
I've been looking around there as well as other spots people have found him but server hopping doesn't seem to be doing anything to get him to spawn so we'll see!!
---
I guess it’s bugged for some people, but I’ve been able to switch it. *shrug*
---
Yeah I made all my resources free because I know how I felt when someone locked all their benches and water behind a wall or juts put locks on them I'd say fuck it and let the spawns chip away at their stuff. But if they were cool and hooked you up yeah I'll watch your stuff I'll even repair your turret for you if it's busted. So it just kinda depends on what that players out look is.
---
Yeah my lever actions never seem to do enough damage.  So I end up mostly using a sniper/hunter/.50 cal.  But it’s so slow.  So it’s 1-2 hits them usually I have to switch to melee or a Gatling.  
---
One of the ingest things seems to be the lack of suppressors doing anything.  Used to be in older fallouts.  You could snipe at will.  And as long as it was 1-hit 1-kill.  And no other creature saw that creature die.  No one would notice you.  In 76 they always notice you and suddenly you are bum-rushed from far away.
---
I remember doing that with New Vegas:
---
Got glitches by the number
---
Bugs by the score
---
Every day I play you less 
---
'cause each day you're crashin more
---
I glad u commented but ii think ur mocking me
---

I’ve done WS non nuke with one.  And with a 3* rolling pin.  Quite fun!
---
Which system, so we can tell you the new keys. Or - read the screen. Xbox = press y, and then x
---
OMW!!!!!! I'm a level 9 so I am still getting used to things. So far I think I am gonna do rifles. This is my first serious play through
---
Is there anyway to tell when it's going to rad storm or rain?
---
How often does the instigating one not kill on the first shot?
---
If you could just pick your legendary effects right away it would end the grind almost immediately, and part of the endgame in 76 is the grind. If every player just got the best end-all, be-all weapons that easily a lot of the reason to play would go by the wayside.
---
The grind sucks, but part of it keeps people coming back.
---
Xbox. Pretty sure they changed the settings for people like me who didn’t fully read the new instructions and was about to spend money in the atom shop.
---
The problem is that, from my knowledge, the team working on fallout 76 is one of the most junior teams that Bethesda has. This doesnt necessarily mean they are bad at programming, they just are new. I have never played eso, and I might never play it, but the team working on that game probably have more experience and more funding, knowledge, and man power to fix and deal with people like that. But even more than that issue, the problem with bad press that the game had on release would not help at all. People angry over the bag fiasco and wanting revenge will go on and try to make everything worse. But I'm not extremely read up on these issues, so take this with a grain if salt
---
Could we also have them not go away without disease cure when we have plague walker? I'd love for it to become a real part of my build.
---
That would be too mean for this scouts wasteland.
---
...exp. junkie Gatling...
---
Take it somewhere and try it out.  Might surprise you.
---
I literally just got done fighting a scorch beast at one camp and super muntants at the next.
---
I don't think so since I was going to write a similar response :)
---
Xbox lol
---
Nope, he’s not. It really is consistent. I even on occasion get a 3* from a non-starred legendary
---
Build a turret. It's fallout not Farmville.
---
Codes are weekly keycards are forever. (Until used ofc)
---
Not mocking... just agreeing that consistent legendaries are given when doing Whitesprings runs??
---
Or saving them. I use this to save bug parts for the dolly sods repeatable.
---
I like the idea of this, but they split the vending between vending machines.  Given the nature of the interface this might be awkward and not worth it.
---
If they find an efficient way to do it, I’m all for it.
---
Lol, I went to a camp today and a goddam bear spawned. I blew it away, since I had my railway equipped. No biggie.
---
Then 30 minutes later, by mistake, I went to the same camp and ANOTHER bear spawned. But this time, some poor soul was standing there with his back to the bear, on his pipboy and obviously afk. 
---
The bear got him pretty good. It happened fast, and I killed it in time to save the player. So now, when I ft to a camp, I make sure my weapon is locked and loaded.
---
Turn on pacifist mode in your options so you don't accidentally hit one of their turrets and go wanted.
---
I never get weapons. Only armour, always armour.....
---
My bad with numbers, sorry. That hardly matters since if it is no or same legendaries (except if both are AA) minigun ain't outdpsing a gatling laser. Gatling gun is bad for crippling with it's low firerate, machine gun is worst heavy weapon of them all, broadsider is niche, harpoon gun is only great with a quad barrel so all dps perks lost.
---
Heavy energy are competitive in their class simply because ER is not the same number as DR. Slap AA effects there and they would outclass everything, though 50 cal might still be at the top.
---
It's not about damage here it is about mods being all bad. Scatter on gatling plasma? With how it is shooting crowds are easy already. Charged on laser? 1 shot per second is plain garbage.
---
It is a grind to unlock suppressors as well. I use sneak and covert ops perks and that helps a lot if you are in an area with multiple enemies.
---
I didn't realize people still did project paradise. Played all weekend and saw it twice.
---
heading back to my camp now
---
Yeah, it won't necessarily work 20 meters away (idk exact distance it does work but it at least works from the top of a marsupial jump to the ground+a little extra) but yeah it will tele you and register hit.
---
I'm part of Brotherhood of Steel at the moment. There's some recruiters that post here on reddit, just give it a search in this subreddit and send em a mail.
---
Indeed, but the best improvement was text chat, not everyone has or uses a mic, text made it easier to communicate
---
Or at least make our turrets as powerful and aggressive as NPC ones.
---
Except you can't fast-travel to their camp if their vending machines aren't powered, because they don't show up on the map.
---
I'm not sure what you're going for here.
---
I leave my water unlocked, as well as my lead. But good luck getting my lead because I empty it every time I walk past it. But otherwise: free food, free lead, free water. And I put free ammo in the machine, so always check!!
---
I always am prepared to help out my fellow wastelanders :)
---
100% agree also
---
Wow, that was completely correct, except for the parts which were wrong, which happened to be all of it.
---
By this logic, every single platformer is the same thing as Mario.
---
More importantly get rechargeable battery packs lol
---
That's not at all what was data mined so it's a not really something I can respond to with anything other than... what are you talking about?
---
Yeah happens all the time for me, can be annoying when you repair from the favorite wheel it will not repair the correct weapon.
---
That's totally fair, but it has long since passed the line from constructive criticism to actively hurting the game's future
---
I'm lvl 225.
---
I have two things on this.   
---
1. If you have your camp somewhere anglers spawn and attack your shoppers. Move your camp. If you are doing player vending, don't put your camp somewhere that has crazy spawns. If you do, have the defenses to handle it. It is not a shoppers responsibility to protect your shop, it is your responsibility to protect your shoppers. 
---
2. If you do not put your vending machines near the player spawn point and I have to run around to find it, or you do not position your floors right so I spawn in the floor stuck, or you have locked doors where I get trapped in a room, or you have your vending machines over a cliff where I will fall to my death if you leave world; I will open all of your doors, turn off all your lights, flip every switch I can, kill your brahman, pick all of your veg, collect all of your water/resources, and try to lure any bad guys I can to your camp.   
---
If you are a good store, I will close open doors and kill any mobs I can, but if you are a bad store, I will try to waste your time and resources like you did mine. If you are going to be a vendor, then be a vendor. Your camp is now a store. If you don't want to set up your camp as a vendor, then don't be a vendor. If people are constantly doing things like this, or you ever come to your camp to find a raw fertilizer and a corn in a baggy on your bed, just know you are doing something wrong that is pissing off shoppers.
---
You can't.  The spawn point for guests is where you originally placed your C.A.M.P. at.
---
&gt;exploding in electricity as soon as someone touch you
---
Every time I see somebody do that my brain instantly hears angry pikachu noises.
---
It changed the game for me too, I could finally climb out of the P.A after living in it for so long....... FREEEEEDOM! I’m loving it
---
There seems to be a blanket price of 25, 50, 100, 150, or 250, based on who's selling. 25 is essentially free, since you get around 25 caps from doing the quest. Anything under 100 I'll snap up for certain, but I won't go that high for Forest maps (which give the poorest loot, no matter the level) … so, I'd say 50 for the woods, 100 for the rest. 
---
Personally and all that.
---
Dude, invest the two luck for starched genes. Hell, invest five and get Class Freak. You won't regret it.
---
? I can still see everything across half the map. I was sitting on top of the light house near 76 the other day and I could see the individual trees over by the garrahan towers.
---
We had raiders. People sniveled until Bethesda made them go away.
---
&gt;Opinions?
---
I think the answer is clear.
---
It would have been cool if Bethesda hadn't made PvP worse and worse and worse.
---
No because it would leave the game with nothing to do and the player nothing to do.
---
I'm not your maid, put up some defenses
---
The keycard is in the upstairs office in Mama Dolce's.
---
The wastelands still aren't warm and fuzzy enough for lots of people.
---
Dodgy and dead man sprinting is gonna hurt your AP .. for crits really all you need is crit savvy/grim esp with a auto pistol to get fast crits 
---
5 in gunsmith you can do without(get weapon artisan) and instead pop some into demo. for an explosive gun .. field surgeon for the just as quick stim/radaway refills or you can swap out for 2 in squad for another 20% increase in runspeed .. damage damage damage 
---
conc. fire just rank 1 for the headshot target but .. your gonna be close with pistol kinda like shotguns any way

It's the thirst, thirstiest time of the year!
---
Thanks!!! 
---
You made me aware that improved repair kits come with killing the queen. I totally forgot it since I never use those kits. Got 80 in total but forgot how often I killed the queen. Awesome. No repairing at the bench for some time.
---
It's mostly because the engine's very similar to older Bethesda games. There's a big modding community for those on PC, and the same tools work for decoding the data.
---
Bt "GY" I guess you mean username? That'd be "Wakshaani"", same as here. 
---
If there are any plans or recipes you want, let me know and I'll go ahead and slot 'em in the machines.
---
I’ve been logged off awhile but a few hours ago found him at Colonel Kelly’s monument - laying on a bench right by the button that activates the narration. This was on a PS4. If not there it is an easy walk to Philllpi Cemetary and Prickett’s Fort which are also locations.
---
There is a new event in the latest esm that I haver never noticed/encountered before.
---
I have been going bonkers trying to trigger it but nope, no dice.
---
Oh, I agree.
---
holy smokes that transforms melee weapons into shotguns, except the damage is easily 10x higher 😲
---
Wrong. Go to repair bench, press the button to inspect and then there is one option for repair kit repair and another button for workbench repair. Go look again.
---
They used to drop from Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Sorry but i honestly don't understand your explanation
---
Blame Bethesda for having me killing 50 enemies with a crossbow.
---
Todd: That sounds slick but how about you have to find a broken etch-a-sketch in one of the haystacks in Appalachia, then repair it using 75 screws &amp; 20 violet flux, then you have to do a series of challenges trying to communicate with Deathclaws and Scorchbeasts with the etch-a-sketch.
---
After that when you use text chat, you have to take out your etch-a-sketch and as you type, your toon will scratch the message onto the screen.
---
What platform?
---
I usually stand and watch if I see a low level fighting a battle. If they’re mobbed I will help, and will revive them if needed. But otherwise they need the learning/experience.
---
That'd make for a pretty boring BR, don't you think?
---
I'd leave them if the vendor asked me to (this happened exactly one time), but otherwise it's impossible to know if they're a charity or if they're like me and just price stuff cheap because they want the space and don't care to wait for it to sell for the max of what it's worth.
---
Other players warping to your camp always spawn in the exact center
---
Sure, but none of these people Im referencing were using crossbows, all were melee.  And giving me a thumbs up afterwards isnt going to result in a thank you.
---
$100 bucks says it is a simulation pod for training enclave/BoS/Vault-Tec that is in the same vein as Operation: Anchorage...and battle royale...
---
&gt;Get rid of your windows. Any player can bypass your locks and such by activating a bed, chair, crafting station, etc through any opening.
---
I appreciate this response, great tip, thanks !
---
oh, i didn't think about pulling the queen out of the zone. i always just charge at her wherever, but would rather be outside the zone so i can use my meat hooks.
---
See I always do this and repair any damage I see while browsing. Walls turrets doors ect. I also close doors too because no one wants their hard work laid to waste by a random creature because the door was left open.
---
Yeah PvP is a little lame right now
---
Heavy energy guns are already on par without stabilised working for them.
---
Remove AA from the pool, fix flamethrowers/cryolators and then fix that affect how they work for plasma/laser and you fix all their problems. It's not the damage that is a problem now.
---
Then again i believe in having an energy and a ballistic weapon for various enemies and that penetration alone shouldn't solve that problem.
---
Im fine with this.  If I get myself into some trouble Ive got no issue with help.  But theres no need to escort low levels through the forest killing every level 1 scorched for them.
---
I'm down for it too just cuz it's experimental honestly. MapleStory made a PvP mode too at one point and it was basically extremely unbalanced and easy to exploit, reminds me of 76. Ultimately they pulled it out of the game but I didn't mind it, it was fun to be fighting other players in a smash brothers esque arena. In 76 with the unbalanced PvP it could meet a similar fate but I'd still be interested to see a full on deathmatch in a fallout game
---
I loved Survival when it first came out. Now I never touch it. Appalachia is very hostile
---
Had it with an Executioner and an Instigsting Grognak Axe and also Perfect Storm and an AAE 10mm, both  weapons degrade when only using one... then when repair one both repair... silly, but par for the course for FO76...
---
Yeah I am excited to try different game modes. We can speculate all we want, but we wont know how a mode feels until we try it :)
---
I'm sure there are some who do, but no I'm not one of them.
---
Okay but it'd make them even better. I don't know about the dmg resistance of the queen bu i usually use my Bloodied Gatling plasma and 45% armor pen would make quite some difference
---
There's a lot of sender/receiver stuff for Furious, so the issue with shots #1 and #2 dealing the same damage may be network related. If the second shot is taken before the message gets back from the server, you don't get the bonus. Depending on shot timings it may catch up later.
---
On a second look, I think there's only a personal stack for Furious, with no target dependence, so I suspect the damage bonus will transfer between targets, only limited by the 10-second timer. The timer may be per-hit, so for example if you scored 10 hits in 10 seconds, then waited five seconds, the next shot would do +25% damage.
---
it’s not a rumor, there is solid evidence pointing towards it being a BR. they haven’t outright confirmed it, but it seems likely
---
Yikes, the lack of a response from him speaks volumes.
---
You can't revive people youre in combat with just so you know. Best way to do this as a loner is to join big name events like scorchbeast queen or imposter event and get the revive done there
---
Pretty similar to mine, I run bloodied one hand melee. Armor is mix of bolstering and unyielding. 
---

---
&gt;Yeah you wanna have lock doors and have me spawned into a locked room where there is no possible way to get out except spend my hard earned caps then yeah darn tootin im gunna get handsy with your juicy tatos
---
I never have spawned inside a wall or inside the structure, always outside the foundations and walked into the building. Never considered it could be a different outcome for potential customers, thanks for this!
---
Imposter? Wait for the eyebombs to get close to people then shot one. You have plenty of kindness opportunities there.
---
what system? and yes gt is for gamer tag or username
---
Hahaha, wow, someone is cranky!
---
I’ll ask him tomorrow again. Forgot that with the dxgi.dll file I use for mods, my normal recording software doesn’t pick up the game, so I’ll use OBS to record. (Let’s hope he’s on again tomorrow).
---
He’s also spent Idk how many hours server hopping getting pets as he’s had almost all there is to get by now.
---
Yeah it really kills the RP. I had to day $10 to change my xbox name to something less identifying. They could just show the username smaller under the display name
---
That, and also Appalachia is muuuuch smaller than a Minecraft world. It wouldn't be a month in before every surface was covered in C.A.M.P.
---
Not harsh at all, I appreciate the feedback. Was definitely wondering why my walls were getting damaged. Didn't consider others may not spawn outside the house like I do. Thanks!
---
Ya I have my backpack fully upgraded, all my limbs with deep pocketed and only 9 strength and I carry as much as excavator PA
---
I believe you may get a refund if you ask for it. Quite a few people have made this mistake and supposedly Bethesda will reimburse the atoms and allow you to keep the purchase.
---
I’m looking to trade for Instigating SS Bat
---
Good to know... Just hung at Arktos for 20 minutes and not a soul came by
---
Maybe an adjustment to my CAMP device is in order. Thanks !
---
Yea they should totally start using Tinder if they feel bored and lonely. Not everyone wants to be *helped*. It is very annoying when they kill it all for you and demand you to pick up their *gifts*.
---
Thanks, if implemented people will tend to use their main character instead of low level alts to sell stuff, or potential buyers will simply ignore their shops, that would be a benefit.
---
damn i just had one in my vending machine for 1k it went quick
---
I'm all for putting rusty nails through people's feet. Appreciate the response.
---
I’d pay 5k
---
Quick thoughts:
---
S- Take blocker for damage reduction from most enemies.  Weight reduction perks are a waste
---
P- Night person is garbage you can get more stats from unyielding armor.  Take crackshot or grenadier if using explosive weapons
---
E- I am not familiar with rejuvenated.  I am a big fan of fireproof for most situations.
---
C- travel agent over suppressor or lower your charisma.
---
I-  Add a bit of demo if using explosives
---
A- dump action boy, dodgey, and marathoner.  With 15 Agility you have a ton of action points.  Also action point refresh is available on legendary armor.  With the six points you save take the rest of the guerrilla perks.
---
L-  Again too much focus on action point refresh.  Better criticals and crit savvy give you way more dps.  Loose one of or both of GRSprint and Psychopath.
---
Hope this gives you some ideas.  Many of these cards I suggested to remove are still good to have for certain situations.  Flexibility is the key to a strong build.
---
maybe in PC one but not console version.
---
This just sounds awful. Who on earth thinks Fallout's gameplay matches a battle royale game mode? People literally just want more role playing elements and story stuff.
---
Oh :(
---
The ol' Houdini 5star entrance. I like it. Thanks !
---
The mule is level 10, and I don't play it often. It will take ages.
---
Yeah, +6 Strenght and Endurance, a big boost to hp and melee damage.
---
Fair point. It is a lot smaller on console.
---
quit this game a few months back at level 200 and if this is the direction they're taking i dont think i'll ever be returning
---
It seems to happen to me only when they're fighting other mobs.
---
*(Assuming non-bloodied builds)*
---
1) Do shoot her in air, but go as close as you can and use regular ammo with Hunter's or Zealot's weapon. Many shoot her from more than 200 feet which is the max range of many weapons and as such do half or less damage. For some reason, she feels more resilient in air hence I don't recommend using ultracite ammo her .
---
1.1) If she is on the ground, shoot her in the head with Hunter's or Zealot's weapon, primed does even better. This gives 55% more damage on top of the weapons base damage (versus and prime stack additively).
---
1.2) When she is below 40% switch to Executioner's, primed is even better with 87.5% more damage (prime and executioner's stack multiplicatively).
---
4) I don't like them being in the zone either because I have to constantly use RadAway, which makes me thirsty. Then I have to drink within 10-15 minutes which makes me prone to client hangs.
---
This has been a bug since mid feb after they cleaned up some duped items. The system is now unable to recognize different legendary items of the same type. I have several miniguns and gatling on my wheel, they keep changing or disappearing from the wheel altogether.
---
Bless you copwifey
---
Exactly this.
---
just tried on xbox, guess you aren't there:(
---
Funny because the other day I saw someone make a post saying high level players are lazy at events and should be the ones killing everything even when there are low level players in the area and the event is more for lower levels. 
---
That post the person made was completely weird though.
---
If you're saying it's a good gun, I'm sure it is for someone. I'm a sneaky sniper though, and just level 49. Other than some big event, I can't see using it much myself.
---
Just for info I guess, in one of the two examples I mentioned only one of the two weapons was legendary.
---
NE of Freddy Fears at that small cave/overhang where the honeybeasts hang out.  It's the same spot the Scoutmaster sends you too during Stings and Things.
---
They actually spawn in the building with the quest giver quite often. When you activate the quest it should give you a circle where you can find a guaranteed spawn though.
---
Autumn acre cabin just east of the windigo cave always sounds one for me
---
There is one labeled on the map when you are in the daily. It’s north of the spooky place and east of the red rocket workshop. I’ve been there once and had no luck with bloatflies, but the second time I went there there was a bunch.
---
Kill the sentry bots at the white spring. They drop over 80% charge and if you're quick you can grab one before and one after they explode.
---
I agree and would argue that if they want to make more pvp content and make it better thats fine as long as PVE content is where it should be for a game like this which it is definitely NOT. We still have massive amounts of bugs in need of fixing, mechanics that need tweaking, not to mention the severe lack of additional PVE content that everyone is asking for. In my opinion, this team is barely back on its feet with this game and they have a long way to go before they can stop and take a breath to begin talking about something like a Battle Royale mode.
---
Do the daily quest for the pioneer scout and you’ll get one from a marked location and get to complete another quest whilst you’re at it.
---
I accidentally scrapped the one in the marker location.
---
There are some cabins just to the east of the east end of the new river gorge bridge that always have 5-8 bloatflies spawn in when you arrive.
---
New River Gorge Resort is the location name.
---
Any more I just wait till their done then disconnect the vendors. Dude bought every legendary I had, probably should've told him I was adding two more.
---
Compared to fully fledged one yeah, but as a cool event nah. I think whatever happens it's probably best to keep expectations in check.
---
If you blueprint them it sometimes keeps all the things you have listed in their as well.
---
Sorry :(
---
haha thanks!
---
Just server hop, they'll be back.
---
I should under "works great at pointless tasks lol"
---
That seems like a crazy good price, would've snatched that for sure
---
Oh no haha my buddy Tango did all of the heavy lifting!
---
I used to visit peoples camps to repair my stuff, etc... I stopped after my first griefer months ago. I helped clear a person's camp of mobs. Owner showed up as I was fighting them.  He then started shooting at me trying to agro me into fighting back (Doing minimal damage).
---
Annoyed I went back to my camp after breaking down junk to lose weight. I get back to my camp to do repairs etc... dude followed me on my map and started destroying my whole camp. I replied with the confusion action... It wasn't like it was a HUGE deal, I mean I just had to later on repair all structures and everything was back to normal (Which I did hours later).
---
He then followed me to Whitesprings and was trying to kill the Mobs before I could. I figured out his scheme so I made sure to hit all of his targets 1-2 times. He would drop them and I would loot them. He kept trying to do minimal damage from time to time. When he figured out that he was helping me out killing mobs and I wasn't getting angry he left and went back to his camp.
---
Since then I've avoided camps of others on purpose because you never know who you will agro.
---
Next challenge lol!
---
Thanks and not surprised. It’s as if the system can no longer tell items apart because the legendary tag is being ignored. Each time when I pick up a new legendary item, and happen to own a similar one, it would do a slideshow of all those items in a row.
---
well before they patched it you could read it then still have it in your inventory i figured anymore than that would have just been wrong lol
---
If you’re after 1980, yeah.
---
I scrapped the nine I got from that and need another.
---
Wasn’t the taming ability cut from one of the recent Wild Appalachia update? There are some perk datamines that shows that they’re adding animal companions to the game (Hopefully when robots too), which is why I think it was cut, they’re improving on it.
---
smh
---
Yes I server hopped 3 times at the teapot. I tried to find them organically to no avail. BUT since I've gotten the camera, I've easily come across him 3 times. Of course!
---
what did you tame if i may ask
---
You'll grow up someday.
---
Sold my bloodied and vampires ripper and buzzblade before people figured out they were useless again. Luckily people don't check the patch notes.
---
I use the finger guns. Such as when fighting the ISQ with a full set of Troubleshooter's armor  ;-)
---
That's pretty gangster.
---
That’s what I did as well.
---
I have a three times now they respawned but only dropped meat.
---
"NONE OF US want battle royale"
---
"Those of you saying you want battle royale oughta shut up"
---
Yeah, pls go away
---
That user account name makes no sense at all: most of people create an account name in order to secure it without knowing this will be shown in game
---
It's stupid and it's a flaw (security wise).
---
But it's not the first (nor the last) oversight from bethesda.
---
At least we should be able to choose what is shown.
---
It’s exactly as I said on ESO. You see awful, reportable names all the time. But I think the difference is the size of the player bases. ESO is huge compared to 76, so stuff gets reported widely and quickly, with a much more robust team to respond.
---
I just don’t think it would work as is with 76 right now.
---
Yes.But why they do that? Useless for me now.I cant build my signs like before
---
I had to server hop 10 times at the
---
Teapot, very aggravating
---
"I can't believe you've done this."
---
Dang, what platform?
---
i just reinstalled
---
There is solid evidence to it being a BR, but I still agree
---
Yes please! Also why does no one in this damn apocalypse know how to shut a door??!! Use my stuff, I don't care. JUST SHUT THE FREAKING DOOR WHEN YOUR DONE! 
---
K I'm good now.
---
Yeah, if I'm in camp and you buy stuff, I'm going to restock.  You may as well hang out for another 5 minutes to see if I add something else that you are looking for.
---
As for the customer being impatient while I am adding stock, I'm not as annoyed by it as you.  I'll just back out and do other stuff.  It's their loss if they miss out on something that I was going to add but didn't because of their impatience.
---
I never played 1 or 2, but it is also explained in FO3
---
Just bad luck, they will eventually
---
Lol. I always kill them at other people’s camps. Not for moral reasons or out of decency, just because it’s freaking annoying to listen to when I’m trying to concentrate.
---
You're getting downvotes. You shouldn't have to but it may be helpful to post the link to the video you are referring to.
---
That isn't at all a good snapshot of society. You have a ballooning working poor that are bolstering the profits of the parasitic ownership class you are describing. Its the exact inverse of what you just proposed. 
---
With that said, it still makes more sense to let everyone at the event get loot. What is the difference between having to shoot 1 bullet or 0 bullets to leech off an event? I would much rather stop penalizing people who are contributing and are just unlucky enough not to have tagged a legendary or the boss before it gets mowed down. It would actually allow for proper delegation among the active players as you could truly focus on adds and not worry about having to switch to the boss mob or risk losing out on your loot.
---
There's a lot of unconfirmed stuff out there about it.   All we can really do is wait an see.  There were reports about coming loot boxes in the past that never came to fruition, as far as I know.  So we should take any "data mining" claims about upcoming content with a grain of salt.

Ribeye steak is +20 carry weight and iirc 20% food. Cost of repair for Brahmin is 1 razorgrain. Had someone farming my brahmin at my base for about 5 minutes before they pointed that out.
---
I don't understand how that leaves the game with nothing to do. I'm saying think of the game as it currently is, but you can log in and your changes are still there. Are you saying that the only content in this game is retaking bases?
---
Thanks friend
---
Agreed, this is an old bug. Bugthesda actually fixed it for a while but reintroduced it after the last patch.
---
I’ve said this multiple times, but there is solid evidence to it being a BR. It could be some sort of TDM, but it does look like br to me
---
I dunno about the whole not shooting in the air bit, if you have concentrated fire and can cripple aiming for the wings seems to make her land faster and more frequently, and stay down longer.  
---
But yeah I agree with everything else.  It should probably be said that proper nuke placement helps insure you can fight her outside the blast zone otherwise the rest of your advice doesn't work if the nuke is too far northeast there's nowhere to fight her that's not in the red.
---
id be content if the (known) tags where pushed to the bottom by default
---
I've seen this the last three times I did the event. Some level 11 runs in while you are waiting for your high level friends to arrive and then proceeds to be total dog shit and no help whatsoever during all phases of the event. The last guy that did this followed me into C, and then proceeded to run directly behind me, not collecting any kelp and not hitting any enemies and even went so far as to watch me get killed and then continue running to another biome instead of picking me back up.
---
Ah, fair enough, happy hunting then bud.
---
I run full heavy combat armor, marine chest. 3x chameleon, 2 better sneak legendaries. Run with a combat rifle/sniper rifle build. Most npcs can never find me with 3 stacked chameleon. Never use power armor
---
Ye I’m on Xbox 😂😂 gotta play together sometime
---
I used to, but don't anymore. One reason is because I want to be able to use my benches when I need them, and if someone's posted up on my weapons bench when I need it it's kind of annoying to have to wait for your own bench (I'm not too worried about this anymore) 2) after deciding to not lock my doors some guy ran around my house for several minutes doing nothing in particular while I was doing stuff and it was unnecessary and annoying. And the third most valid reason in my eyes is a super mutant started following me into my house the other day and I realized if I don't have locks on my doors I can't keep him from following me 😳
---
Sorry for such a long post just thought I'd give an honest answer to your question
---
TL;DR: Some people are just annoying twats and some people just don't want to have to deal with that.
---
I mean, isn't that the point? You could set build limits per area, like each square on the map or something.
---
I’ve got 280 DR and 380 ER, 360 carry weight with deep pocketed and backpack

What is her heal look like?

Samsung and Apple actually copied Huawei which did this with their Mate 20 pro (I don't think Apple does reverse charging yet, apparently Apple will have it in their new phone/phones this year)
---
Does explosive perk cards work on the BE Gatling Laser?
---
I have to admit, I take a measure of delight in luring mobs to peoples camps and then sitting back somewhere with a good view, nice and chameleon-like, and watching them slowly argue it out with whatever active defenses the camp has.
---
I think the best was dragging three low-level scorchbeasts to a camp up in the divide.  They took their sweet time but eventually whittled it down to foundation.

I'm not really sure how. Semi new to Reddit. The videos are saved on my phone from the Xbox app. If y'all wanna see them my GT is VapeStain69. Pretty sure all my captures are public.

Whoa

They are real
---
The Fixer plans are real.
---
I agree with vats targeting her wings. Problem is most people are dumb and just shoot into the air at her. So I just blanket cover the issue and say no shooting in the air.
---
I like watching them destroy bases... it's like art. Rushing to gather them together, running into the base, and crouching so they engage the encampment. So lovely. &lt; 3
---
I was off for 3 weeks until the latest patch.  If nothing else,  you might have to wait til the next patch.  Its frustrating to say the least.

This is a great idea and helps those of us who ARENT trying to steal but have low karma due to being new.

fair enough :)
---
that would work as well :)
---
Like, you literally ran out of ammo and all your melee weapons broke?  "I believe not"
---
Exactly. I think it's beneficial to everyone.
---
Not as much as you hope honesrly. Queen has all damage resistance and then her resistance values (worked like this last time i checked). That's why zealots will be better than AA for queen, it takes some time to get accustomed to how resistances and penetration work and while penetration is always a damage increase, amplifying damage done (zealots for example) might get you better results.
---
It's not about warm and fuzzy... it's about return on investment. even if they'd only run with me through the Arktos building for five minutes, they'd have netted way more in caps than they did by killing me.
---
&gt; 2: Simply wrong. Every SBQ I've been to, people have stood on top of things, and the SBQ has always landed many times. There's always some people still on the ground, she'll just agro whoever is on the ground. I would like to science and see if she wouldn't land if everyone were on top of a fence, but I honestly don't think it matters. She doesn't care if you're in a 6 foot high fence, she can still target you on there. And I've seen her land right on top of V9 many times. Hiding inside a building only happens with low level characters who don't know how to fight her anyway, everyone else is outside.
---
Because there are people who aren't standing on things and standing on something doesn't necessarily exclude you from being targeted. I've never really noticed any issues with the SBQ landing and attacking anyone, but I think that's because she's so big. This is absolutely true for regular SB's though so it might have some truth for SBQ.
---
One thing that I did find is that if your vending machines go offline, then you really need to get back to your camp, quick.  I wish that there was a C.A.M.P. security item, like a perimeter fence that would send an alert to your Pipboy.
---
A player had just been at my camp in the Mire buying stuff and I checked it out to see the stats and noticed that my store was offline (not showing the vendor information).  I fast traveled back to find a scrotchbeast right over top of my camp.  They never show up at my camp so it must have spawned and followed the player to my camp.  I don't know if they logged off or just booked it out of there.  But they left my camp to take the brunt of the attack.
---
In any case, I lured it away from my camp up the hill to an open spot and then took it down.
---
It took a lot of materials to repair, partially because I forgot to equip the contractor perk.  But I fortunately had it all in my stash.  
---
But, yeah, I'm also the Ranger type, if I see any enemies near your camp I will take them out.  I feel responsible for spawns, especially since I am at level 200+ and they spawn at max level for that area.
---
It should display your characters name with a way of checking their tag name, like some games do by having player name (login name).
---
The other day i was visiting a camp in the bog when a lv 80 SB attacked along with a hord of scorched. I wiped them up and even repaired several of the machine gun turrets that were damaged in the process. A couple of lvl 15 and 20 vault dwellers even showed up to "assist" in the battle. I did not mind the extra xp to revive the guys when they went down. Lol
---
Ok, so first your clearly doing something wrong if it’s taking you 15 shots to kill with a gat plasma, put on a beam splitter and try to use a Explosive gat plasma (VE would be my suggestion, as someone who collects explosive gat plasmas VE is the best version for day to day) but yes gat lasers are trash, they do a third of what a gat plasma does, shoot slower, use fusion cores have a slower reload etc, they serve no result purpose and the only thing they have over gat plasma’s is the ammo capacity, with it having nearly 4x the ammo of a gat plasma with all its perks
---
I have both. They are real. One from Imposter and the other from Arktos
---
I... can't really say no to that. If you're serious, and willing... I'm down.
---
I don't ever need to. I have far more than enough weapons on me, and I top off repairs when something is low when I pass through my camp anyway
---
I spawned into someone’s locked camp, couldn’t fast travel out because of “enemies nearby” and ended up wanted for picking the lock to get out lol
---
You should have tagged this as a suggestion so the deva would see it lol
---
Well i don't care how much it'd help, it's a bug and Bethesda needs to fix it
---
Like literally every legendary mobs heal, when they hit half hp they regen crippled limbs and go back to full hp. Sometimes the heal bugs out and doesn't happen, but that's pretty rare on SBQ; it does happen on 1 star legendaries very often though.
---
Do Nuka Dark and Whiskey stack for +12?
---
I would test myself but I'm not home and also don't have Nuka Dark. :(
---
Yep, was having a similar problem last week when I tried reinstalling Fallout. What fixed the stuck download was an uninstall an reinstall of the Bethesda launcher.
---
It is the same mechanic since forever though. Obviously different number are intentional.
---

I'm in the Mire near Thunder Mountain and I get RadToads, Cave Crickets, Super Mutants, Mirelurks, Ghouls, and the occasional MarkIV robots.  I notice right away as I always keep my ears open for weird sounds.  the Mire is noisy but I've now been there long enough to distinguish the difference.

Go to the winding path. West side along the cliff is an archery range with a crossbow spawn.
---
Yeah, screw you. I and everyone who comes equipped with ghoulish will fight her wherever we want. The SBQ is a server event. If you don't want people showing up, then wait for the personal servers to roll out. Bitching about how people reasonably playing the game upsets you is just bad form.
---
Is the new Arktos dungeon the only way to get a backpack? I think so but not sure.
---
Done, thanks!
---
Well of course you don't need to but they're there taking up inventory.
---
As a Canadian, can confirm.
---
It’s a good suggestion btw, but you used WoW as an example. You should have used guild wars as an example it’s a much better game. :D
---
Shared a (PS4Pro) server this morning with a 'Iwillrapeyoi' and a 'lemmestikmydicinu'. So just going by those two childish individuals I'd suggest we can't be trusted to have our own text.
---
Don't see the attraction with using my IGN to shit talk but then again I'm not 12yrs old.
---
You forgot the xxx420xxx on you name ;-)
---
Thing is, I was fine after the patch. It just started today?
---
I've stolen a couple and never been marked.
---
I also usually try to shoot them down and wait to see if anyone comes to claim.
---
No, it’s the pioneer scouts quest line. Go find a pioneer scout poster at any train station to start
---
What are you talking about?
---
The key code containers always say steal from. I crouch in hidden and pick the lock. Never been made wanted because of it. 
---
Have you received the wanted tag for this??
---
Wait for real? I always get a 2* piece from it but I never realized that was normal. Thought I was just destined to get crappy combat armor I’d never use
---
a lot of them are done by the same voice actress the one that does "rose", she is so versatile, from a raider to a kid, the campfire tales bot, etc.
---
And you can hear some skyrim dudes also.
---
For some reason it's choosing not to spawn, I've been on 6 different servers and none of them had it
---
The ultracite is and always has been a “meh” drop. People still barely use ultracite PA.
---
 The Serum changes were another way Bethesda is trying to add cap sinks.
---
That' what pissed me off most.  I didn't have the concrete for my defensive walls because who the hell has concrete lying around when they're not **constantly repairing walls**. Anywho, I try to claim a workshop.  I leave for a bit aaaaand disconnected.  I decide to give it a second go and this asshat kills me *right after i've claimed it.* Didn't even wait for me to wire up the resources.  I take off all my armor to avoid breaking it and go back, surprisingly, to appeal to this shitstain's sense of decency or boredom, telling him that if he wants a fight, he's clearly not going ro find it, but if be willing to build up some resource generators if he needed them and would leave.  He just left, which pissed me off even more knowing that he didn't even need the resources.
---
Ah, ok. That makes more sense. I haven’t gone after the scout quest line yet after seeing a bunch of complaints. I’ll probably have to at some point.
---
I hope they did. This was back in January and after that I just watched.
---
I was happy enough when they switched it back to the current setup from being alphabetical. That was a real annoyance. 😖
---
I agree, this is such a sellout move. Bethesda please don't make me want a refund even more.
---
Hahah, well, I've never played Guild Wars.
---
Def agree on Night Person. Lol, it was just filler to get up to 8 PER for better VATS at range. Actually, if I'm using a reflex or iron sights in VATS though, wouldn't Crack Shot be useless? I wouldn't be ADS with this build much, plus less AP drain in VATS as opposed to scopes.
---
Meh, I like the charisma perks and level where it's at. Once they give us perk load outs, I can switch to taming on the fly.
---
I didn't address it, but why even have those movement speed perks when I could just use the Speed Demon mutation? Kinda kills RPing to some degree... Hmm, Action Boy and Marathoner must stay if nothing more than RP purposes; Dead Man Sprinting, Dodgy and Gun Runner can go I guess. Plus, you never really know what rolls you'll get in legendaries anyway.
---
Oh luck... Grim Reaper can go, the other two stay but at 2* plus I'll add 3* Better Crits.
---
Awaiting your response.
---
Is the game rated 'm'... cuz people are, well let's just say, nasty.. I would like if I could leave a note.. but you can always send them a private msg
---
I would, but I'm level 40 and those sentry bots are level 60, I'm also poorly skilled at fallout games in general.
---
You should really try using turrets
---
Everyone who tried guild wars after WoW stayed on guild wars. Good times.
---
Metal armor or Robot armor could be good choices for low weight but decent protection.
---
Again, can you show me some? I'm outta the loop on the rumour mill so why do so many people think that?
---
Not sure fire but maybe clear out the general's steakhouse. Supermutants tend to have all sorts of bug parts in meat bags.
---
I literally just did seek and destroy and it said steal from even though it was clearly my mission.
---
Sounds good to me!
---
Maybe in survival , they are annoying as is
---
Never been the case in 76. Was the case in previous games. Tradeoffs of being a multiplayer game with instanced loot.
---
Yup, it gives you exactly 45 currently.
---
Ah there's my b☆☆☆ plug.
---
Again, can you show me so e evidence? I'm outta the loop on the rumour mill, why do so many people think it'll be a BR?
---
Not many good MMOs nowadays.

Alright thanks, I've spent a time of time grinding both but still no luck then. Imposter is too expensive to keep doing.
---
Gauley mine is a coal mine
---
The nuke code containers are not called by anyone, you’re stealing frol the (old) US military!
---
The supply drops ARE called, and as of patch 4 or 5, are stealing for anyone but the person who called it.
---
Why is there 5 slots yet we only use 3.
---
Its fine it has to do with limited memory space espically with future content
---
Impatient is one thing, breaking camp stuff (or trying to) is just rude and server hopping so they can't shop is just what they deserve. IRL shops don't put up with that crap
---
Sorry the emoji did it for me
---
Every day we ask... yet not even an answer
---
so your high level buddy launched a nuke with a level 10 carry on?
---
There’s several base “metal” textures used across essentially every metal object in the form of material swaps. As well models are kitbashed together and leverage the same textures at that level. 
---
For those who are saying it’s lazy - well:
---
1. You can’t reinvent the wheel constantly at the texture level. Switching to PBR cost F4 notable time. 
---
2. It’s how you create visual consistency. 
---
3. Why wouldn’t you pair the charging station texture to the blade to the robot...

on xbox if you try to look in the distance everything looks terrible

After see yours I might take 2 points from intelligence and put one in charisma for the travel perk and 1 point in endurance for radicool.  
---
Nope I got a stack of 10
---
How do you zoom with the camera?
---
Maybe it should be that OG backpack you pick up. Have a vault tec emergency sos 🚨 light on it
---
Yes!
---
*Don't use grenades fat man or missle launchers. These weapons cause a lot of frame rate lag and can cause some player to lock up or dashboard*
---
*The blast zone is laggy*
---
You forgot to tag this as consoles only.
---
Yeah it’s usually better with super mutants but I think it’s a multiplayer thing
---
I can carry 480 with 60 backpack more with high capacity no power armor that's with a bloodied build.
---
I just picked them up from Watoga.. only dense torso plans I’ve seen in almost a week of server hopping haha
---
Super mutants are all female.
---
Odd that systems like this, which have been standard in online games for years, are not in this game.
---
I dont believe the beer keg is real though. 😑
---
Good point. I'm sure the decently built PCs don't have this issue. But there is a lot of console players so issue remains.
---
Damn! Are you willing to part with it? I’ve got some really good 3* armor I could trade for it
---
Sometimes for hours. When I occasionally had servers to myself, I always saw the stuff I'd dropped earlier during my rounds farming legendaries.
---
Yeah I’m sure we can work something out.. GT DrWattzo
---
I’m interested, how much do you want for it?
---
Also have this problem since patch 7 probably
---
I might’ve been estimating with the shot count but it definitely kills very quick especially compared to the laser
---
I haven’t been lucky enough to get explosive on any of the heavy guns but I will keep an eye out. I tried beam splitter on the gat plasma and I was killing waaaaay slower than with the regular nozzle. It wasn’t a range issue because I was point blank for both. Beam Splitter basically turns it into a flame thrower right? Does it benefit from other perks besides heavy gunner once you put the splitter on?
---
Why tales breathes and read the screen when it’s easier to complain on reddit? 
---
How can this person see press ^ to use repair kit, but not press [] to use bench repair?
---
Amazing! Think you could hold it for me? I’m out of town right now but I’ll be back tomorrow. I’ll shoot you a message on Xbox right now
---
Absolutely man I got you
---
Eh never been like this in the other fallouts. It doesn’t need it.
---
A different color paper bag only the camp owner can collect.
---
yes pls, like the on in runescape
---
Go on
---
Whitespring.....
---
Check they're website for server status
---
Is this a grammatical correction or...
---
Also at middle mountain cabin, atthe middle one, has a broken crossbow
---
This
---
It's also not like other Fallout games.
---
Fair point. But here's a counter- did survival mode cause them to shift too much focus?
---
Let me also add, I can't believe I'm actually defending a BR mode here...
---
This was the whole reason I had to move my CAMP from the whitesprings train tracks. People would come to shop and Ghouls would spawn from the substation next door. They'd always end up destroying my generator no matter where I placed it in my CAMP. Eventually got fed up and moved since I'd always have to come back and clear out all the enemies that spawned.
---
That's capitalism.
---
I think the only reason its like that with caps is because it obviously makes sense that it would go back into their pool, I don't think you could get away with not doing it, but even as it is they are trying to give you back as little as possible. I would like a system like that but its definitely never going to happen, as it doesn't promote daily
---
login and prolonged game play. You can tell the mechanics they are implementing are taken from mobile gaming mechanics.
---
I use a bloodied explosive lever rifle on them and it works well the trick is not to get shot by some of them as they go through you like butter.
---
Had the same issue after the patch, verify your game files in the Bethesda launcher if PC.....
---
If not , cant help but I imagine the consoles have something similar.
---
Best I could do on short notice.
---
Always down for Arktos PP 😉  I'm on PS4. Psn is pathofcinders
---
Point was this person shouldn't have said all users on all platforms. It's pretty crisp on PC.
---
Yeah, it seems strange having a mutant run at me with a sledge but when I kill it there is only a hunting rifle. I also miss being able to take the fallen’s clothing.
---
This is the only [under 3m kill of SBQ I have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRY1rQ1rPKE)
---
You could call it Charlie’s Milk Steak Farms
---
Sorry if this is kind of a basic question - but are you combining with all the stealth and sneak damage perks with sniper?  PA massively increases your chance of being detected.   I use a 1 star Instigating Hunting rifle as my main weapon with 50 cal and one-shot almost all the regular spawns.  With L68 Super-mutants I have to take a couple seconds to make sure I hit them in the head (or else it takes two or 3 shots), but most lower level spawns I don't even bother and just quick vats-kill them.
---
I haven't even bothered maxing out the rifle perks (1 rifleman, 1 expert, 2 master) along with 3 on bloody mess (luck), and regularly swap out tank killer for lockpicking or some other perks.  But keep the glow creature damage perk on all the time.
---
But I agree that you can't easily knock out the large creatures quickly (unless they're glowing).  I have an AA lever action for medium tough bullet sponge creatures (Behemoths, etc.) and just built out a Zealots Explosive lever with scorch killer receiver to see how well it works against the SBQ.   I'll swap in the Demo Expert perk when I do this.
---
Melee weapons are so overpowered that I don't often feel the need to buff them at all.   I hold onto an Instigating Death Tambo that takes care of business.  Anyway, hope that helps.  Sniper build works great for me as I play solo most of the time - and sadly most of my perks are in weight reduction.
---
Not sure what you’re asking, but
---
The Whitespring has every faction vendor in there
---
Try the raider vendor
---
Why Charlie
---
What? You be quiet. There is a difference between making a Fallout game online, and using  the Fallout universe to hop aboard the trending train. There is no way for them to do a BR mode without it being Jarring and EXTREMELY lore breaking. It wont even be Fallout itll be a BR with a Fallout skin. People have a right to be upset if this is what it ends up being.
---
Maybe instead of characters being locked, make equipment and items separate.  Then you can go back and forth depending on your mood, keep quest progress and plans, but that character starts naked in survival mode and you have to go from there.  Only thing you have access to there is what you find or make there.
---
Serendipity is a God send and I agree with the op.
---
Not interested in Bloodied but thanks.
---
Lol its an answer, thought you were asking a question....as in where?
---
Got 2 from the Event: Breach and Clear, instead of ore in the Drills lockers there were mostly empty but got the sword from them twice!
---
Lvl 25, said its Legendary but has no Legendary stats
---
I want to add -  If you're going to lock your house, please add a STASH box near your vending machines.
---
Your stats adjust (either up or down) due to a variety of effects, but they never change how many perk cards you can use.
---
They don't effect your Perk Cards.
---
It's still beta, so nothing in that mode is "real" yet.
---
I like the idea... but I can't even begin to imagine the messages people would leave. 
---
Maybe if they limited the guest book to player name and an "emote" symbol... like a thumbs up, or a barfy-face, or whatever.
---
but actual messages? oof.
---
You keep your perks and  you don't  gain any.
---
The mutations change the special points in your stats, not your special skill tree points
---
From the character in Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia. He said his favorite food was milk steak.
---
You don't need the crossbow to be broken, any repair will count toward the badge (even if it's at 99% condition).   Just get some bolts and shoot a few things (or bash) to reduce the condition.
---
Oh ok I’ll name it that then
---
But wait! There's more! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2284201431833123&amp;id=100007298648457&amp;sfnsn=mo
---
Also more on Xbox Live. GT VapeStain69.
---
Oh ok. No problem.
---
Oh wow, what a genius psychologist you are. I didn't tell anyone to leave the game; I said there are plenty of other games to suit your tastes, which there undeniably are. You could be playing any one of them instead of supporting the game being moved in the wrong direction or playing daft psych games on here
---
I'm like 110% only the person she is aggroed against at the moment needs to be on the ground and "open" and she'll land. The other folks don't matter.
---
I find it quite funny you should say that to be honest as out of everything, the voice acting in the fallout series tended to be the worst aspect of the games.  
---
FO3 for example had like, 5 voice actors the entire game, NV cranked it up a bit but they all had a goodbye ["LATER!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRKKu0c3DG0)  
---
It feels strange to have the voice acting actually being one of the best parts of the game now, lol
---
Thanks and yeah, ps4
---
can send me a link?
---
What was wrong with Vault 13's Overseer?
---
Oh I agree, the voice acting in FO3 isn’t great by any means and neither is it in FNV or even Fallout 4, but something about FO76..... just works ;)
---
Still bugged...
---
yeah, I am hoping they will fine tune stuff as time goes on.
---
PC. Tho I play with an Xbox controller. My aim … is not so good.
---
Awfully aggressive
---
Sometimes they fall on the ground
---
Doesn’t seem to be a rhyme or reason for when
---
Not my camp not my problem.
---
That a legendary cryolator?
---
[https://bethesda.net/en/status?\_ga=2.178764518.311650891.1558992401-314700218.1557519503](https://bethesda.net/en/status?_ga=2.178764518.311650891.1558992401-314700218.1557519503) 
---
idk what to tell ya
---
Bummer... maybe I was just getting extremely lucky when enemies seemed to drop their respective weapons... cuz I could have sworn they were for awhile with FO76.. but I could also just be dumb so. Looks like that.
---
Yeah, I mean I guess with everything being told through holotapes now, they need better voice acting to make people connect
---
They could make them have to be aproved by the owner.
---
Get the backpack and grind out the extra carry capacity mod (+120 weight).   It'll reduce your DR a lot but the benefits for hoarders is huge.
---
Marsupial Mutation gives you +20 carry weight besides the jump.
---
If you can find it, the reduced weapon weight armor is fantastic for rifle builds (there are no perks that reduce rifle weight).   Note that the max reduction is 90%, so having the right weight reduction armor can save you some perk cards.
---
I just posted a reply to someone else asking about sniper build, but with Instigating rifle and Sneak, I've found I really don't need to max out my damage perks.  But it will depend on your play style.  I'm embarrassed at how many weight reduction perks I use up since I'm a bit of a hoarder.
---
Yes logs would be great for keeping track of what items are actually selling the best and what price has been working the best because the notification goes away too quickly when you're in the middle of a fight
---
to add to this, STOP LEADING SCORCH BEASTS TO PLAYERS CAMPS!  
---
Seriously I was shopping at a players camp when a person ran into it while being chaiced by a scorchbeast. Before I could kill it the thing destroyed the generator and I didn't have materials to repair it.  
---
the player that lead it there was laughing.
---
If you mean "what you can carry and still sprint", I haven't a clue. However, if you mean the absolute most you can packmule around, stamina loss and all, 1670 is the absolute maximum. Beyond this the game *will not* allow you to pick up more items.
---
It only effects the rolls you get/use in the game, not the use of the card system. So a -3 luck wouldn't take away any perks, but it would make RNG crappier as far as game mechanics go.
---
Yeah, but that poor owner has to sift through that shit.
---
Which is fine when it's nothing but talking about sex with your mother... but when we get to having to read what some of these folks would write? man, I've had a few run-ins in this game where what people SAY is bad enough.
---
Yeah, I have low Charisma (level 2) can get it down to 19,200 caps with Grape Mentats and a Pickaxe Pilsner.  Add a bobblehead and its around 18,400 caps.  
---
It might be worth it to keep one of the +1 Charisma armour just for this.  If I can find a leather one and then apply Ultra Lightweight to it, I might just keep it just for Bartering.
---
And for stupid question of the day...I win!
---
I would need to change around my entire playstyle to get any use out of them
---
Fun fact, if you think something is more expensive than you're willing to pay, you can just not buy that thing.
---
Sheepsquatch?  That's a myth anyway.
---
no
---
They’re more similar than different.
---
Thank you my friend. However I wonder what got you to a post that is 6 months old.
---
Yeah. Got a nice collection. 1 TSE 2 Furious 1 TS 1 Suppresors 1 Bloodied 1 Quad.
---
Got it. Lowered weight limits, lowered damage in melee... but still get to keep all my perks. Perfect.
---
All of these voice lines were datamined from the files. It includes literal hours of lines, so it’s likely these are the complete set. 
---
basically, Nuclear winter will be based around Vault 51 and an “evil” computer that runs it, ZAX. ZAX believes in survival of the fittest to make choices, so he hosts several pvp contests for roles such as overseer. 
---
in the leaked voice lines ZAX talks about a closing safe zone, a storm of nuclear fire, getting to the safe zone, announcing when squads are wiped, the final 1v1, tons of things you would find in a br. 
---
it seems as if Nuclear Winter will be a bunch of pvp modes, br included.
---

That's weird because you can just lock the resources too.  I have a junk extractor in the middle of my base I built around, all I did was put a level 3 lock on it.  Nobody messes with it.
---
That energy doesn't benefit from penetration. That energy resistance on enemies is different than ballistic resistance.
---
My whole point is to not change something to make heavy energies just better than blistic ones. My point is to give mods some real power to compete.
---
Or do you think AA + stabilised wouldn't be broken on energy weapons?
---
Ikr srry
---
Thanks for the advice. I have an instigating bolt action, level 40, that is my main weapon. I think I probably do need to juggle my perks around as well. I’ve been holding back on buying armor or armor plans until I can figure out what set I really want to go for. I’ve got one Legendary Marine limb and might try to go for that set.
---
I got up to like 2 million just by trading in ESO.  It honestly broke the game.  I could buy literally anything I wanted and had no reason to actually play the game anymore.  I quit before ever hitting the level cap, it was like beating the game.
---
Maybe it could be a rating system out of 10 stars and a choice of words.
---
did anyone stream this? im on xbox but would love to watch it, seems like a lot of fun!
---
I’ll be up for it, I should be on in a bit GT: Tae Der TOT TJ
---
1 hour cooldown on stealthboys?  You can't say make it more about tactics and take away a tactical item like that.  Just pop berry mentats and shoot the purple mist.
---
There's a town in the southwest of the ash heap, called Beckley or something...there's a camp with lots of gore bags and trailers near it. It seems like a 50/50 chance of either mole miners or a mix of bloodbugs and bloatflies
---
Exactly. So with class freak negating the negative effects of mutations, there's never really a downside to mutations, or at least they are negligible for the most part. The only truly annoying one is speed freak, since thirst and hunger are already so incredibly quickly draining. Grounded, with the full Class Freak perk, has no negatives at all.
---
To answer your final question, BR is a free for all last man standing game mode, where players start with nothing and find gear around the playing zone. As the game progresses, the playing zone will shrink and force players to continue fighting. the game will continue until there is only one team or player remaining. the current survival mode is just a free for all with no objective or winner
---
Ya I  know.  Mine started after the last patch and I waited til this one.  I would've quit if it it wasn't for the latest patch.  All I can say is....  I feel your pain and it might take for the next patch to fix your issue.  Who knows, I could in your shoes on the next patch....  3 of my friends were also in the same situation.   Hang in there buddy.
---
That would be great! Looking forward for an update!
---
When I'm under 20% on my bloodied build my carry weight is 445. Climbing into PA is a painful necessity at this point because I lose 100+ lbs...
---
I always do and I even fix things that are broken.
---
theres not such a big difference in between survival and regular mode that i thinj they could shift focus unless they really tried to. The only real difference is that PvP is always enabled
---
Plus if the camp has turrents, just lure them near it and they can do most of the work for you. Tag it and claim the exp!
---
Or if you spawn inside locked camp, why for mobs to rescue you 😅
---
Forgot to mention - had the Appalachia Radio turned on while it faded out. If that helps in some way.
---
Thanks! Yeah this is pretty conclusive imo, hope it's not a shitshow. I think br would be great for fallout, I just don't know if these devs can make a real multiplayer experience.
---
Yes this!!
---
Nice. Sent you an invite
---
I actually killed him solo but got lucky cuz the frog crawler was just backed into a corner while I was sniping it, and the bloatfly mob we protect was on the opposite side of facility lol.
---
If energy guns would be broken with AA then just nerf it. But just leaving the way it is pisses me off. Most people don't even know AA doesn't work with energy.
---
Yes!!!! What time? I can join in like 15 min
---
I’m using the vendor machine as an extension to my inventory stash what I have there is good stuff I use but if someone likes something they can buy it without any contact prices are a bit higher but it’s stuff I use so if u like something it’s available but not giving it away cheap
---
Preach!!!! Couldn't agree more
---
That's where Class Freak comes in. At top level it takes off 2/3 if the bad or unwanted effects, so in your case the -3 would become -1, so slightly less annoying.
---
It got it done thanks. I wouldn't have done it without it equipped. Meat only came up after the bonus search option.
---
To each their own, for sure. Can I ask how many you have stocked up?
---
Might record and post the next run!
---
Seems to be server related, but also way worse with certain weapons. Minigun seems to do it a lot.
---
The sight itself will add accuracy correctly; its when using them for aiming down sights where they begin to act up. I have a 1* AA gatling gun that I use to conserve 50 cal and have found that using just hipfire crosshairs I'm far more accurate at medium to long range. Short range is buggy, imo, with sights as many shots don't even register at times when aiming center mass. 0 issues hip firing though.
---
I've even used my monitor's cheater crosshairs to have a static image on screen when using the aiming down sights function of the gatling and still get weird shots that don't register at all ranges... hipfire? Like a damn laser pointer.
---
As soon as people join my server and we head down there. I'm in no rush though. Get online and message me!
---
But i spam invites for "free range" and "campfire tales" just to alert others
---
Lol at least you're not worried about it. In general, I'd rather people take the risk of looking stupid and ask questions to get informed than sit in ignorance.
---
Your intelligence is an exaggeration.
---
What platform are you on. I can grab some up for you.
---
Alright, I’m gonna eat really quick and then I’ll message you. I’m level 81 sniper build, btw
---
Can't join, says ur offline
---
Oh nice, I havent really used the cryolator much, does it count as a heavy weapon do you know?
---
I hated them at first, but getting 50 atoms isnt that hard, and eventually dont have to rely on them too much.  Im fine with them, heck the perfect repair kits that repairs past max u can get as drop in game from is SQB.  What I wish is that they kept the repair with materials option so the repair kits can just be there to save on materials every now and then so it can make it a bit easier for us if we chosr to do so, especially when it starts being expensive to repair.
---
Coolio. Just sent you an invite. 
---
I'm 60 something. Random build. I like guns so I carry a bunch
---
If you're having carryweight problems the backpack is a game changer!  Definitely worth prioritizing.
---
Im a fan.
---
One sec
---
Yes,i like to see if i do enough dm to her,im rifle build with a tse handmade,killed her today tho:)
---
With how often it happens, I don't believe it's intentional.  The player base would have to be largely malicious.  I just think they're thoughtless and inconsiderate.
---
Some can be mules with great stuff sometimes lol
---
Would lead you to totally skip my lvl 5 vender character with 40+ legendary weapons and 20+ legendary armor pieces.
---
:~p
---
Shows I'm online and I'm currently playing so I dunno
---
What's your tag? I'll send you an invite
---
Well we did only the quest and locations, so I used him for fast travel and enemy clearing yes. Yes he did clear the bunker so I was a carry on, but the question was not "whats the lowest I could SOLO the bunker" I was curious about how much XP the prerequisite quests gave and if I somehow found myself at a nuke launch what the lowest level COULD be. I was surprised that those few quests gave me 9 levels, kind of neat to find how to minimize xp, and today I finished that line of questioning and wanted to share :)
---
The endgame is slogging through the crappy legendaries. If the fixed them there would be no point playing passed the queen.
---
The mayor's office in watoga has a safe that used to always have 8 stimpacks in it. Not sure if it's been patched. Usually I just make diluted stimpacks with the chemist and super dooper perks and I never run out. Don't forget to bring plenty of food and water down there, your first run will probably take some time.
---
I found it 4 times at Phillipi cemetery and once at Tyler county fair grounds.
---
No problem.  Sorry, I didn't answer your actual question.  I don't actually pay that much attention to the armor I'm using.  I just look at the legendary affixes and use what I need.   It sounds basic but keep away from the mobs, and if you're unencumbered don't be shy about running off and then sneaking back again.
---
Doesn't always work for some mobs, but marsupial helps you jump up to places they can't reach you, and the strength perk that reduces melee damage can help out a lot (although I know that Str isn't your stat).
---
Get the deep-pocketed mod too (+10 carry weight) vs pocketed and put it on your armor.
---
Same as name
---
I have never tried to name it in the game. Not sure if there is an option to.
---
Anti armour weapons
---
I can’t find him!
---
I'll be on soon where are you nuking
---
I always kill enemies at other people's camps. I helped one dude fight off three scorchbeasts at once. Quite unlucky I must say.
---
How did I not know this existed?
---
Wherever y'all want. I've never done SBQ so that'd be cool but I don't really care. Just want to run the silo and finish this quest
---
Yeah, it's a useless item sink, but it's not actually a sink because scrip is so limited!
---
I believe firmly in that.  That's why I explore and quickly patrol around a camp before heading to the vending machine.  That doesn't magically fix my problem if other people still don't mind the stores they're visiting being attacked while they're visiting.
---
Sent
---
OK I'm cool with SBQ AS WELL IVE 2 BEFORE
---
If you’re on PC I can gladly make you a level whatever fixer. U: nmprogue
---
I’m on now at my camp.
---
Nice goodluck!i did my first one today to on xbox!its facking epic!
---
You can get directions to where they spawn in the Whitesprings bunker. One of the spawn locations is my camp. I get a lot of spares and sell them.
---
Well for me it’s frustrating, I can’t get the stuff I want, and that reason might make me quit.
---
Now we call u tyranttwoholes
---
Crashing on PC, 3 times in a row. Doesn't matter how i get there completely locks the game, Seems to be a memory leaking issue as 32GB Ram is getting maxed out.
---
I’ll check later if I have any. 
---
You have anything in trade? I’m looking for T-51 or 60 mods. Also marine or vault under armor mods. I have plans for treated vault and the basic marine wetsuit but no upgrades yet.
---
That's all well and good, but with the ultimate objective being the ability to deny other players the benefits of playing, a game is pretty much at end of life. I'm not going to go play more with more bloodied builds knowing I'm guaranteed to get less xp and loot every passing day. It's supposed to be a cooperative game, instead we're being separated by badly balanced mechanics. Every new bloodied weapon is one less person who can operate in a team/group setting without hindering the players around them.
---
Do the queen for the your first one!so awesome
---
It’s callout Fallout 76, not Fallout Online. It’s a Fallout game, so it should be made like a Fallout game (with multiplayer elements)
---
Send me an invite my gt is exiledbridge2
---
Ps4 here. NEVER had server issues. Iv been logged off 13 times in the last hour. I don’t know what the fuck is going on but it’s pissing me off. Like right now it says “server connection interrupted, returning to main menu” WHY!? Wtf man
---
The enclave quest “Seek and Destroy” you get from a terminal in the command center.
---
Hunt the cargobots escorted by 3 vertibots. 
---
Take out the 4 arms to make it stand still in the air otherwise it moves around.   When you down it pick the lock and it gives a keyboard some aid and other things.
---
Thanx!
---
You lighting this candle? Lemme get an invite!!
---
If you're on PS4, I'm currently server hopping and I can let u know if I finally find him!
---
When I posted this, I anticipated there would be someone reply like this...
---
it was a general you, not a personal attack friend.
---
Yes i did this quest and launched today for first time,was wondering how i get the next keycards?
---
More legenedaries need to stack and/or work with more perk cards to help increase other legendary effect popularity
---
All legendaries should be base 2x better than their equiv. armor/weapon ... then max any additional damages/resistances gained to 50%
---
They should just have a damage/resistance increase category, utility category and modification category .. 1 star is damage resistances gained effect 2 stars adds in a utility effect and 3 star adds in an additional mod to the gun like quad barrel etc
---
But yeah the current system is alil out of whack .. some effects have no business being on some weapons at all and some are useless by themselves and would just be better as an additional effect like a utility effect not a main effect
---
Just switch servers and repeat it.
---
3 of us online so far
---
Ty
---
I steal unlocked water at every camp.
---
I agree. I'm making a sport of the wildlife challenges by trying to take pics of live animals covertly. Yes it would be easier if I rank up animal friend/wasteland whisperer but I don't have it right now so having the ability to get that tag at a little further would be nice.
---
Ok meat rock
---
My most active gets ghouls, rad rats, moles, wolves, dogs, super mutants, scorched and even deathclaws.
---
Jumping on now. Can you resend that invite?
---
Next time, change servers.
---
Thanks for the help. And may I ask what perks you are talking about as I have around 30 stimpacks but I have launched one before and It took me about 2 hours as I was only level 30ish and I had nearly 90 stimpacks and I ran out
---
Slowpoke: "Hey, guys!  Have you heard of this game called New Vegas?  It's the best Fallout game ever!"
---
Done
---
Add me my gt is exiledbridge2 it says your offline

I'm totally conflicted on this. I love the entire Fallout series. I've played all of them for hundreds and hundreds of hours. I don't say this to brag but, instead, to illustrate my loyalty to and enjoyment of the games. 
---
There's a part of me that's pissed about more PVP bullshit. I don't play PVP. I don't want to play PVP. I stay away from workshops because they're PVP. I think people who PVP in Adventure should be permanently banned on the spot. 
---
However, there's another part of my personality that says "If you don't want to play PVP, then don't. There's nothing that's forcing you to do so. In fact, if there's lore that you just have to have, watch one of the Youtubers do it."
---
I think there's enough nastyness going on in other vaults that one more bit of nastyness isn't going to break or change anything. In fact, wasn't there a vault where the residents had to sacrifice someone every so often? It wouldn't be that far out to have one that makes people compete against each other.
---
Yep. An 3* AA minigun with a bunch of vats crap for 2nd and 3rd effect is basically the same as a 1* AA minigun. Maybe the 3* gets an extra 250-500 caps just because it's a 3*.
---
Any ammo left?
---
I’ve got one tse drop since day 1. It was 100 levels into the game. I almost woke up my toddler with my celebration. Keep grinding...
---
The game sucked at day 1, I don’t think there is any unfair judgement for that fucking mess.
---
If it's your first time launching you might need a few extras, just to launch is a pain... Did it for the first time last night at Alpha site.. and oh god are there robots everywhere lol I had to restart the mini-quest about 3 times before I got the hang of repairing all the pipes... Good luck sir!
---
When I think of Fallout the first thing I think of is battle royale!
---
Yeah. It's a good gun. Junkies is probably going to replace bloodied as the meta choice if Bethesda makes changes to bloodied. You get get a constant 50% damage boost without tanking your hp.
---
I’ve seen it on the screen but never checked. It would be in junk if you received it.
---
Bethesda is actually dumb as hell to be honest.
---
Imagine after having such a shitty reputation at the moment, you walk onto stage and go. "Hey we know youre all really unhappy with Fallout 76 and it basically made us a laughing stock for a few months. Anyway, Battle Royal mode for FO76!"
---
I still call it whiterun and everyone always yells at me ..
---
we need a vendor though selling REGULAR raider armor OR make the plans drop more often
---
Regular raider armor(light/sturdy/heavy) is the best in the game because I wear it and I'm always right so nobody disagree with me
---
Unyielding armor should make up the difference!
---
Not true...  every real life vendor has had impatient customers and have had to put up with them.  Take Black Friday, for instance.   However, I do agree that property damage would not be acceptable.
---
In my opinion, the problem is that the mic just isn't used enough.  I'm wondering if the behaviour would have been different if you had used the mic to great them and tell them that you are adding items.
---
I know - we all checked our junk and it wasn’t there. We have the non-stabilized flux in our aid of course but didn’t actually receive the stable.
---
May be a new bug, there’s been a bunch the last week.
---
Praise the lord, and pass the ammunition!
---
*improve* the story.
---
Thank you 😂
---
Yes...  forgot about that...   I think that I just traded some in.  I'll have to check my stash.
---
Don't know. I just drink it.
---
Even if the new mode teased as part of Nuclear Winter is a battle royale mode, that's only party of it. That's like saying Wild Appalachia was just a new unrestricted pvp mode.
---
On PS4 it’s one of the left bumper buttons, I think L1 maybe?
---
Damn, if only you were on xbox
---
No the splitter is a lot better it’s essentially 4x the damage and shots per bullet, accuracy isn’t that big of a problem if your using heavy guns Anyway, no one picks heavy guns for their accuracy
---
Lvl 87 I'll be on around 7pm central time. GT ShiningAnimus
---
Make it customized like the mining helmet light. Would be cool.
---
Psst.  They never said *who* the freeloaders were.
---
Right? I don't even have any. They're useless, loud, and a bit of an eyesore.
---
Little fussy aren’t you? No other vendor in Fallout cares if you shoot up the shop. Just don’t shoot people or steal.
---
Except I just sold a 1* AA lever for 2k, a 1* furious handmade for 1.5k, a 1* furious Gatling plasma for 2k, etc etc etc. Junk legendaries are worth notjing. The right effect on the right weapon is worth good caps.
---
There was a thread here in the last ~12-14 hours that was very informative and helpful. I don't remember the name of it but it was something like 'tips on Project Paradise'.
---
Was Survival mode the bulk of Wild Appalachia?
---
I look at weapons. Everybody has plans, aid and ammo, not many people have weapons so if they're selling say more than 10, they probably have worthwhile stuff.
---
Oh, bollocks - a significant amount of these rely on chance, they're not a challenge.
---
I'm fine with there being hard/challenging dailies/weeklies, but that's not what we're seeing. And that's particularity true of dailies which, as the op points out, are there to encourage people to check in each day. I used to log in every day and knock off the five dailies each day - but once they started getting silly that quickly stopped.
---
Now I'm not advocating that they go back to the OG challenges (level up once, emote once, craft anything), but they need to find a comfortable middle.
---
I just want my enemies to see a red glow before their head gets blown off by my sniper rifle 😭
---
I've become Steve Irwin with some of these wildlife challenges "Ahm just gunna get a bit closah,  see this guy up close, hopefully he doesn't see me.''
---
Is it?!
---
I'll be online in an hour or two. GT KingDemonLink
---
Easiest way to save health is use the computers to turn the turrets on the robots. Hacker and picklock are mine main perks that help with my solo silo runs
---
I rebuilt and re-placed my camp after the vending machines with a bit of planning.
---
So it's not a problem with mine now. 
---
Players other than the owner will always spawn in the centre of the build area, I.E where the C.A.M.P was originally placed. 
---
Guess if you've done something that involves stacked concrete foundations or a floating exploit it's going to be a pain to rebuild.
---
It's a big problem being CAMPed outside of Watoga it happens constantly.  Launcher turrets are a big help.  Don't listen to everyone on reddit who claim turrets are useless and unnecessary.
---
Cool not sure when I can join though
---
Have a semi-auto like a Handmade. It will still benefit from your rifle damage perks.
---
Excavator and PA in general is so frigging OP.
---
I hate it how little benefits armor has. Using regular armor vs PA should be more of a matter of choise.
---
Here I have 8 special strenght.(all onto weight reductions) Normally without major bonuses the carry weight is about 535-550. Whiskey, +20 carry and +1 str food bonuses are very trivial, and the alcohol addiction doesn't even give severe penalties like to str.
---
https://i.imgur.com/NCIjqIo.jpg
---
After I learned that, and that the bigger packback gives severe penalties to resistances, I've lost so intrest in trying to get it.
---
&gt;Subtract the 10lb weight of the PA chassis which is now tossed in the stash and not always in my inventory, and my inventory space is essentially only 5lbs less than when i wear it, and i never have to drag the PA out, hop in, fast travel, jump out, and reclaim it when i'm overencumbered. :
---
And that's another thing in favour of PA. With PA you don't need to carry it, while armor pieces you need to carry them.
---
It's ok, you can say "butt" on the internet
---
Yeah, but don't you still have to store each and every item in the camp?
---
You could have gotten significantly more value out of your fights with just a few adjustments. One of the benefits of fighting the adds (not necessarily the queen) in the nuke zone is that the adds will drop flux crafting materials (hardened mass, high radiation fluids, etc.). Something else, and most important for value, is farming the adds. They are what can potentially make the fight so much more valuable. It's one of the most, if not the most, valuable events in the game if you know what you are doing. Placing the nuke in a different location other than what is considered "standard" also adds significantly to how much value you get out of the event. My group and I figured this out before the datamined maps were released (mappalacia) but now you can easily use those maps to more clearly target either certain types of fluxes or just getting the most bang for your buck (for example, east/southeast of the trainyard). Back when she dropped serum crafting recipes it was more valuable to farm her as quickly as possible. But, these days skipping the add phases and fighting them outside the nuke zone with a badly placed nuke is a good way to get significantly less return on your investment. Sadly, this often leads to the misconception that the event isn't worth doing.
---
I don't at all agree that it's one step forward two back, but I do agree the number of 'team' challenges is silly. Ideally you'd want to see one team challenge, one hard challenge, one easy challenge, one medium challenge and the leveling challenge. Add in to that, no more than one camera challenge each day, no more than one alcohol challenge each day and maybe some challenges pointing people at the vendors/legendary trader.
---
I sent you a friend request there just send me a message when you’re on :)
---
Um thanks for that seemingly unrelated statement.  👍
---
I personally vote for pistols. They're often overlooked in general BUT the pipe revolver benefits from both rifleman and gunslinger perks, so half your perks are already useful for your secondary weapon. They're also cheap and easy to maintain and don't weigh much.
---
Is it free yet? Everytime I looked at it it said "Free in 2018", then you'd try to play it, and it would take you to the $50 founder pack or whatever.
---
I have a vending machine filled with useful freebies. Of course, there’s a few traps in the way, including one which destroys the vending machine with a flamethrower- so if you want then you’ll have to be careful.
---
Why? Because they don't play the game. They only test it.
---
That’s a great idea! 👍
---
Even in a 'safe' area I have a turret - and a spotlight, since it speeds up response time. You're asking for trouble without one.
---
Thanks, I sent you a friend request there shoot me an invite when you’re online :)
---
I love my mr cuddles would love him more if he was stop using my generator as his scratching post
---
Vomit.
---
Probably around 15-20
---
Fallout 1 &amp; 2  let you barter items for items to other npcs. Have the current system for selling items call it barter.  Make a new trade option for weapons and armor trading piece for piece?
---
Aa doesnt work on energy weapons
---
Mini nukes are heavy and don't seem to be very effective without perks (haven't heard how they are \*with\* perks, but I'm a sneaky sniper -I may never know) 
---
For the Atomic Fan challenge I ended up unloading the mini nukes I had to make on the Morgantown Train Yard and then bashing the low level scorched with my Daisycutter for the kill part.
---
No, they just mischaracterized the size of the freeloaders and the contributors. We don't have a small percentage fueling a lazy majority, quite the opposite in fact. In game and in society.
---
I had the same issue thrice and stopped Queen runs after that.
---
Chemist is an intelligence based perk that doubles your crafting output. Super duper is a luck perk with a 30% chance of doubling anything you craft
---
My GT is SaltClaw, just let me know when ever your on and I’ll give them to you. Thanks for helping others out. Some players can be asshats but more are all good peeps!
---
You're most likely right, it makes the most sense.
---
I frequent the Top of the World area and the cargobots spawn nearby.  Every time I see one, I take it down.  I have 5x in my store \[PS4\] and 7x in my inventory.  The Cargobots also spawn near Harper's Ferry.  
---
What you'll see is a small cargobot surrounded by three Vertibots.  It's the small cargobot that you want to shoot down, but it helps to take the others out first as they will shoot at you.  The cargobot flies in a pattern until you've done enough damage to each of the 4 rockets.  Then it just hovers and you can take it down.  it can take a while with lower level weapons.  I like to start with my sniper rifle and then switch to an automatic after it goes into hover mode.
---
Planning a nuke run soon as I 'm getting low on Stable Flux for Serums.  But the last couple of times I happened to be just about to start a run when someone else launched a Nuke.  So, I just keep adding them to my inventory.
---
if you're a newb newb .. like nooby .. don't select multiple damage perks spend the perk points on other more needed perk cards focus on one weapon type .. 
---
each weapon type .. cept shotguns .. has different ammo types so you can switch weapons if you run outta ammo/gun breaks .. but eventually you'll get some dope legendaries which you'll only really need one of, weapon artisan and ammo will be in abundance
---
It's fairly obvious mechanic. Player builds a camp and then enviroment attacks it.
---
Yeah I was hoping to get some flux for my friend who just came back and we ran their first nuke and won - no flux other than the raw
---
I mean u have exp ghoul slayer handmade it does 30% more damage so I one shot ghouls right, but then my anti armour level rifle one shots them too extra penetration
---
Alright, Vendor Bot Wallace
---
&gt;Since then I've avoided camps of others on purpose because you never know who you will agro
---
With slap damage gone and player vending, visiting people is now a lot of fun. You should definitely go visiting.
---
I just mean the gameplay itself. I wont get too negative nancy, because nothing is certain yet. We will just have to wait and see.
---
As a big fan of this game I am glad to hear that.
---
No I’m not a trader. I was down in white springs and noticed that the raider vender was selling most of the plans for the raider power armor.
---
Great.   Except those have nothing to do with the specific comparison I asked about.  
---
But again... thanks...  🤔🤔
---
Ugh, what you said but more so.
---
I appreciate that and also when the SQB is going get nuked!
---
I've logged into the server, right at my camp and had 3 scorchbeasts spawn with no fissure sites near by. The wrecked my camp
---
The thing that kills me is the trophies associated with this - it has been my aim since every fallout to 100% each game.
---
I am working on FO76 and have the rest (Shelter included) I fear a BRoyale mode will make this almost impossible as there are tons of duped TwoShot explosives and a ton of people higher level than me :(
---
Ye I know
---
I mean, BR is basically FFA DM anyway...
---
I will if your house is hospitiable. But I'm not gonna waste my 5.56 defending someone's camp that's completely locked up and charging 6 caps per 5.56 round.
---
Congratulations!
---
It was implied but not confirmed, AFAIK.
---
This was a great read and I would love to be in your list of players. Today I was on my 2nd solo launch and r had everything ready to go, just had to select my target to drop the nuke. Went to Xbox looking for group to post a message as I usually try to do and boom audio glitch. My wife and kids were laughing because I was cussing up a storm. But to be fair it's the first crash for me on xbl oustide of the pharma event in a very long time. The drops were good, got another 3star bloody grog axe, can't complain about that
---
I personally am not a fan of PvP in this game. That said I still see how some could enjoy it. I would love to see a mode that allow players to be super mutants, ghouls, mole miners, or even animals vs humans.
---
I tried a friends one early on and got killed a dozen times by shooting to close to myself...haha! Dam radrats...lol
---
All valid points
---
Cool, not sure when I can join though
---
That might be some great PVP honestly. It could give us rewards for PVE
---
Really OP?
---
This makes PA mostly obsolete...so many useful legendary effects on normal. I can only think of 2 builds that should use PA (heavy ballistics and emergency protocols) ... rest you are better with 5 legendaries, underarmor and now a backpack slot. It may take you a while to find your best mix of pieces, but I hardly think PA is OP.
---
What PA is though is decent and easy to put your hands on and with better direct control on what limited features go where (though few useful choices).
---
Back before they added all the X01 mod plans to the vendor I spent hours server hopping for the mods. Since server hopping for just plans got boring I started hunting cards as well. Log in, check the vendor, use the terminal to mark a bot on the map, kill, and repeat. I racked up 30+ cards before I finally got the calibrated shocks and jet pack I wanted.
---
Before I read your comment I thought they meant a three star legendary "b", whatever that may be. I should get some sleep
---
I always thought this was the rule of the wasteland. 
---
Every time I've been @ a player vendor and mole rats pop up I play exterminator.
---
I'm level 46, I'll be on in a few hours my GT is Rippleshanks
---
That’s part of it unless you have a dense chest piece or fireproof perks. I die a lot if I get mobbed. I just try not to carry much junk with me.
---
I'm right by the project paradise event (PS4) just northwest of Arktos. Constantly and consistently bombarded by super mutants and scorched from a neighboring tent site, always the same 2 vending machines they take down. If I see someone taking them down so I dont have to waste the bullets I'll drop water or food for em.
---
But that is exactly what i don't want. I don't want all heavy guns to be locked to power armor.
---
There’s electronics in the assaultsron version... it open and closes
---
I am! THANK YOU
---
Question for OP/bloodied users: is the strategy to get irradiated to keep your health low? Also, do you just use tons of stimpacks in order to not die?? I’d assume it’s pretty easy to die with 10% health.
---
I used to park near there in a big store/bar/motel, and a single lv2 turret and a missile turret took care of lv68 mutants, robots and mole-miners with little issue... the trick seems to be adding a spotlight, which allows turrets to lock on faster and at longer range.
---
Long post is good, I appreciate the different perspective. My camp hasn’t been near people for a while so I miss out on these fun encounters.
---
Sometimes ya get lucky and find one that does not have an escort.
---
Theres an assaultron helmet????
---
I’m near the Top of the World.
---
If you want the backpack quickly you can server hop for a night time server and do campfire tales at camp adams as much as you like.  That has a 25% chance to drop a badge.  The other 2 that have that same chance are dailies so knock those out as well for some mounted heads n such.  You can find one at doly sods and the other at kidy corner cabins.  There are 3 scout events in total
---
Ye I can make them
---
Addictions don't go away after logging in or after death anymore.  Certain drugs give you different debuffs so you can choose which ones you least need.
---
I saw them on the market yesterday for 1500 each. I jumped on that deal. Most players seem to want 3-4k for a recipe. Still way cheaper than the Enclave.
---
https://xboxclips.com/X4GottenFateX/screenshots/ae7cd0b0-db12-49b3-b933-aa7748382dad
---
Heres a pic of my house cat lol
---
Don't let anyone dissuade you from using dogdy. I'm not a bloodied build. All you need is powered gear and you will have plenty of defense. At this point it's better than sentinel armor.
---
That’s awesome. I had been afraid to because I didn’t know if they would disappear quick. Now I better get on it. Thanks.
---
I assume you get them by scrapping circuit boards too?
---
Last time I did that I got shot by the owner for having a 5 cap bounty for hitting the side of their shanty.
---
People should be aloud to criticize the game, and i feel refelcting on this games issues bethesda needs to know they cant pull a stunt like 76's launch again.
---
No you can make blueprints yourself, it's Hold X for me as I use a PS4 controller, and select what I want to blueprint. 
---
YouTube how to make Blueprints Fallout 76, I'm sure there is a video on it :)
---
Yeah that's not my question. I know how to make blue prints. Lol. 
---
Asking about storing not blue printing 😂
---
Same with me for lead. I have a base around and over an extractor . Damn is it loud!  But lock it because my lead went missing all the time. I leave my garage door open so you can use all the benches and stash. Even leave my upstairs open so you can play some tunes, relax in the bed and even listen to some tunes and enjoy the view. I love visitors even if we don’t talk!
---
They're literally advertising Wastelanders as a huge story update. So they come out with a mode that *might* be a BR (with completely different rules, from what I heard from the datamined voice files). So what? 
---
People know literally nothing about Nuclear Winter, and people are like shitting themselves because fortnite (and therefore BR) bad. It's really ridiculous.
---
Yep, lower level might be better because its a mule..
---
I run a junkie build. My addictions have yet to disappear and ive been playing it for about a month now. And the damage buff is 50%, 10% increase per withdrawal, capped at 5 withdrawals. Its actaully a really great build to run in my opinion. Its not too op where your one shotting SB, i think its very well balanced in all honesty. I use it in pvp and it holds up to most builds, (except those lazy, pop a stealthboy and run around with a tesla rifle the whole time.... seriously screw those guys, theres no skill involved in what your doing... "git gud")
---
I just spawned inside someone house.
---
There was no way out. I could loot his junk collector in basement(his water purifiers outside were locked lol) Luckily two ghouls let me out through makeshift door through the wall. I killed them after. 
---
As the vendoring  has been a thing for quite some time now, I wonder how people don't notice players are spawning inside their locked house. Like that house was 3 stories high, it had a door on top floor too, but it was also locked. Actually the bottom door could not even be unlocked as it was keypad door. There was some kind of switch next to the door, inside, but I couldn't do anything to it. At least leave a top door open so players can jump out. Sure with jetpack and marsupine players could get in through that, but how many would even try,  and does it really matter as they can only watch and maybe leave the fertilizer on your bed. But it's not real anyway.
---
I get a decent amount of 3* drops from there but they are never max level since the molemen supervisors are usually no higher than level 42
---
If you need metal parts, just keep resetting the reactors and not repairing any of the times, you're going to stock up EXTREMELY fast
---
I am also looking for the tourist if you could public post if you find them
---
Really all you’re asking here is to make the game lazier.
---
As I see in Enclave bunker all recepie have a same price. Try to buy it from other player! I had just buy 600 caps/pc!
---
Oh, if it's an event in the main game that you can opt into...that'd actually be pretty rad. But I can't imagine them doing that. Not only are the servers low pop on purpose, but there's no way to make sure the highest level guy doesn't just win with all his OP loot.
---
No, I imagine that IF there is a BR then it'll be an entirely separate game mode with no/drastically reduced perk cards and a set amount of guns/ammo/other items scattered about.
---
And that's asking people to choose between playing FO76, FO76 Survival, and FO76 BR...yeah...
---
Maybe only forest is limited to level 5. Mostly the spawning enemies are levelled to whoever is close.
---
This! I had a guy follow my alt around WS trying to help. He even sent me a message to explain it. My alt might be level 50, and this guy was over 80, but you’d think he would notice that I’m running a Bloodied build with an explosive handmade. My third character is level 15, and players stop to help all the time if I’m in a busy area. Helping newer players should help the game thrive.
---
I feel personally attacked. :D
---
I'm Lv110, but I spend most my time in the west of the map and that XP comes mostly from building camps. I mean, I can travel map-wide and sneak/snipe mobs fine... but if I get stuck in a mob I'm toast. (Also, while deathclaws aren't too much of an issue, mirelurk kings and Yao guai get me constantly - I think because of the staggers). I have a roleplay/jack-of-all-trades build and I only got my first 3\* weapon recently when the new vendor was added.
---
That's my biggest issue with it.
---
Op doesn't mean the recipe
---
If you're on xbox and want help you can join my server and I'll help you through the silo. I'd join you, but I'm holding the tourist don't want to leave this server unless I have to.
---
Also, I have a bunch of diluted stims I can sell you for cheap, or if you want I can use chemist and super duper to turn each of your regular stims into 4+ diluted ones.
---
This was my go-to weapon for most of the time I was leveling to 50.
---
For the recipe or serum?
---
He’s usually level 1 and cowering. I avenge his fallen brothers, but I leave him alone since he never gets aggressive.
---
pretty cool either way. and I cant not act like a weenie so yeah take that
---
Confirmed from my last run too.
---
Here are the ingredients 
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_mutations
---
Carnivore, I think. Requires phosphorescent flux and common materials, which I don't remember.
---
That doesn't mean it's not being updated?? 
---
[Also, from last October:](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/save-the-world-state-of-development---october-2018)
---
&gt;NO FREE TO PLAY IN 2018
---
&gt;We decided to move the free-to-play launch of Save the World out of this year. We’re working on a broad set of features, reworks, and backend system scaling we believe are needed to go free-to-play. Save the World has grown consistently since our launch in July 2017 and Fortnite overall has experienced unprecedented growth. Scaling up for the legions of player heroes who will be joining the fight is key to providing an excellent experience. This applies to all of our players, old and new, so we’re taking the time to get this right.
---
Great thanks I will try that!
---
Project Paradise crashed my game every time as well are they going to fix this or not?
---
Which part? I was thinking of Inuvik
---
Course it is
---
. It's in the frig next to the beer.
---
/S
---
Try out junkies. I use 5 addictions for 50% bonus danshe all the time. My addictions give me -3 str and -1 to everything else but agility.
---
I equiped the shotgun perks, aswell as changed my rifle perks, but it hasnt affected the damage of the gun at all
---
I set up camp just down stream from the lake with the brahmin. Sorry, there were more before you got there. But I wanted a steak dinner.
---
Sounds like fun but I'm on ps4
---
Im still waiting for them to fix that too tbh, i want to use laser guns aswell
---
when you go do the scout quests, start with Archery, Athletics, and swimmer. Most of the others are either a complete pain in the ass or are broken and can't be competed yet.
---
They could make them glow for us, or shine/shimmer when we are close and in pvp it could glow for your opponent as well to up the risk and reward perhaps.
---
^This. I bought carnivore specifically because fluorescent flux is easy and super plentiful in WS nuke zones. But don’t you dare farm my fertilizer and bone spots!  :p
---
Added there :)
---
If you drop one everyone can get a card. 1 team, 1 cargobot nets 4 cards. And any alt looting within 5 minutes. So 20 for 1 cargobot if you go bananas.
---
The Fixer? The alternative combat rifle? I have the weapon didn't know there was a plan to make it..
---
I can't wait to get my character up and running. Building a rifleman right now. Don't give two craps about instigating, I would love an executioner weapon though. Will have to see what I can get my hands on at 50+ (46 right now). This kind of thing sounds like a ton of fun when you have friends rolling with you.
---
Sorry I don't understand what you mean, you could blueprint the vendors, then store the rest and rebuild your base, or move your camp go somewhere else and you would have your named vendor blueprints and the default one from your last camp. 
---
Blueprinting the vendors should let you keep all the items in the vendor stores and priced for you, at-least that seemed to work for me when I moved my camp.
---
No worries, good luck!
---
I just wish we could edit the names when we change appearance.
---
"If you want something different than my subjective opinion there's something fundamentally wrong with you."
---
Nah nothing from them, other people have completed the quest just fine, so it just seems to be me thats glitching, both with or without power armor.
---
This was what I was looking for! Thank you.
---
You can fast travel w/o PA?
---
Thats exactly what happened to me! there was an invisible object blocking access to the code panel.
---
Youre the first other person that has mentioned this problem!
---
Lol this feels counterintuitive ;)
---
I understand that I'm a low level leech that relies on higher level people but I can try!
---
I'm only level 76 I think, but my gt is HambleBoBamble
---
I remember when you did this before and I was curious when we would hear from you again. Congratulations! I'd like to see anyone try to beat your new record. I'm sure there are a few more tweaks you could do here and there and achieve this at an even lower level. Best of luck and have fun!
---
I am camped outside of Flat woods, up on the mountain. (Yes my CAMP is lopsided as hell lol) I have my door locked because I had no idea of what the general player culture would be like. I have had so many damned scorched and ghouls spawn inside my front door that it's fuckin ridiculous. So much so that the turret that I put inside was broken when I got home. I guess I should unlock my door?
---
You carried 97000 rounds of 5mm?????
---
You used 25000 rounds?????
---
That’s unreal!!!!
---
You must have been crawling with that weight load!!!!
---
If I read this right, you determined the minimum XP could be gained by doing the quest but without any XP from any of the local mobs or the robots in the Bunker.  If the curve below is right, it's about 6560+ XP.

---
As you level up the amount of XP needed to get to the next level increases.  XP to get from level 1 to level 10 is a lot less than going from level 10 to level 20.  So, the leveling is only relevant if you start at level 1.
---
While it's interesting, there isn't much practical application...  But, what would be interesting would be a chart of all of the quests and the minimum XP and at what level you should be to reap the most rewards.
---
Yeah, did you have to store each vendor individually after you blueprinted them or were you able to store all at once because they were in a single blueprint?
---
My advice, get the glowing mirelurk, the deathclaw and the ghoul. Most defensive and maneuverable options.
---
This sounds EXACTLY like mine. (I went the RP route and filled my vending machines with liquor and made the top floor a bar.) I added a sign over my door asking people to close it when they leave. Works about half the time.
---
It's good to know they at least fixed the addictions at some point.
---
There is a mod for this - replying for a friend.
---
You can zoom with the binoculars too, hit L1 or left bumper
---
Good to know that addictions stick around now. I never saw that in the patch notes, but it's not my thing so I probably overlooked it
---
Yea. I think it was 3 patches ago. Not for sure honestly.
---
Hm well it's up to bethesda
---
&gt;name a mainstream video game that allows you to intercept packets
---
FO76 was never meant to be mainstream, that's why they don't have their best team working on it. However, it can be (and is being) done in ESO (packet editing is a thing), which is the other big online game that has the Bethesda name. Start by naming a mainstream game that saves screenshots on their servers for public display.
---
&gt;I'd love to see a tutorial of someone MitM
---
Stop. That's not what MitM is. Go ahead, say some more buzzwords, maybe you'll get one right eventually.
---
&gt;Obviously Bethesda wouldn't upload to their servers every single screenshot you took
---
Then people will modify them. So you're back to square one in that delusion of yours.
---
&gt;Public API is not required
---
Heh, save hundreds of thousands of screenshots, never share them. Cool idea, better yet, don't implement such a shitty system.
---
&gt; A lot of this is solved by limiting each player to only have 3 favorited screenshots
---
And there you propose an idea so bad that I'd rather see porn homes and hate memes if I had to choose (I'd rather neither and more bug fixes for the record)
---
By all means this was very impractical! I do like your idea about figuring out quest vs reward XP wise, and as I am a serial character builder (on my 16th build atm) this might be a good idea to start recording!
---
Part of the ingredients yes
---
Yes. I have a suppressor limb damage I *love*
---
Thanks! I would love to see somebody also run these!
---
The camp device moving does definetely affect where you spawn. You won't spawn AT it, but you will swapw relative to it. Move it to direction you want your spawn location to move.
---
It’s okay I think I’m only level 47/48
---
I did almost kill myself a few times going into "bunker run" mode and then remembering oh no I'm still only level 9 XD

It doesn't make a difference, it's the same random 4 places!
---
I carry around about 1,000 of stuff, maybe more, while NOT in power armor but I'm not overencumbered. I use all the weight saving perks and 5 pieces of -20% weapon weight armor. 
---
Mobbing is great fun when you can go non-stop for like 20 minutes, looting everything off the bodies, and still not be overencumbered.
---
Has no one come to an answer yet. This sucks
---
It seems that the day travel point other players is random, while camp owner spawn point is fixed. Not sure why visitors habe a different fast travel point.
---
YES!! Lmao 
---
I failed the first time at Camp Venture and then failed a few times on purpose to see if he got other lines - wasn't disapointed at all
---
I got him. User name Marlboro_man808. I’ll stay here for a few. Add me now
---
I'm using a full set of it to get my discount, though I'm sure that's more worry on the robots end to see a human bleeding to death on at their counter!
---
Its the only way to get it
---
I take my hat off to those of you who launch nukes for those of us too lazy to do so. Thank you.
---
1000th like yea!!
---
Switch to anti armour or 50% limb damage weapons some sneaky perks and you become an invisible monster
---
Ok, my psn is receased13, I added you and I'll hop over to your server!!
---
You should be able to put all four into one blueprint :)
---
I did mine separately though as it made it easier to place them one by one
---
I think BR’s get way more hate than they deserve, personally, and that their poor reception comes almost exclusively from Fortnite popularizing the genre by appealing to middle school gamers.  It’s a perfectly decent game mode, in its own right.
---
**However**, I certainly agree that every shooter on the market does *not* need a BR mode, and Fallout is definitely among those that should stay well away from it.  The game’s already got a bad enough reputation without including the Nickelback of game modes.  On top of that, it just doesn’t make sense in a game for which the premise is “rebuild and populate”, especially with no NPC’s or story structure to give it context.  A regular “hardcore” PvP mode is perfectly sufficient for people who want to kill each other in Appalachia, at least until there’s a private BR server.
---
I played on launch too and found it pretty clean to just bash through quests.
---
Now it’s more stable I’m playing on a different system and also struggling to get through most of the game because low/mid level quests are all being populated with far higher level enemies than I can deal with.
---
I’m doing a lot of server hoping and it’s just so frustrating.
---
Is that a euphemism?
---
When you press square, it asks you to store the item yeah?
---
They /might/. Typically it’s SEEMS like they drop from a 1h list, 2h list, rifle list, shotgun list, or heavy weapon list.  So if they’re shooting at you with a shotgun, they’re going to drop some kind of shotgun. Sometimes you get exactly what they have- certain things seem guaranteed, like mole miners who shoot a missile at you will drop a missile launcher, or super mutants who spray you with a miniguns will drop miniguns.
---
Xbox, I'll be on till 10pm est
---
I would love something like this!  I appreciate things that are role play friendly.
---
My CAMP is in the mountains by a Coal refinery thing so my title would probably be something like the King of Coal.
---
I think they got that. Not sure though.
---
I always stop and kill mobs attacking player camps. Seems like the neighborly thing to do.
---
UPVOTE THIS POST. Lol I’m tired of getting legendary bleeding walking canes. The loot comes faster thanks to Purveyor, but it’s almost like getting hot garbage served to you faster. Lmao my first two shot legendary was from a level 200ish player who rewarded me after I played the bass all throughout the Sons of Danes event without stopping. If you’re reading this, thanks my guy.
---
It does, you haven't moved it enough. I fixed my respawnng by moving it.
---
i hope it s just me but this make me more sad than it should..
---
It’s about honoring ANYONE willing to give their life for our country. And especially those who have.
---
Someone's probably said this already buuuuut....  I can teleport to a camp (mine, friends, whatever) and not get an attack triggered for 15 to 20 *minutes*. If I see 'em, I kill 'em. Beyond that it is a difficult issue to 'always' be kind about. Stuff might not show up till long after I'm gone.
---
Didn't know people still play fo76
---
I rebuilt my camp, with that being one of the reasons. Other reasons being seeing if I could improve the design to be more object efficient, minor modifications to layout, and to rotate the entire camp for a nicer view when people nuke Fissure Site Prime.
---
It took 2.5 hours, was defintely worth the 40 caps,  learned a few things about camp design, and not once have any visitors gotten stuck in the ground since.
---
Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for remembering and honoring people who have died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. The holiday is observed on the last Monday of May. Memorial Day was observed on May 30 from 1868 to 1970.
---
Same thing with Legendary corpses would be nice.  I always lose track of where Legendary enemies die during Scorched Earth and Project Paradise.
---
Then what would you suggest for let’s say a Handmade, as in what effects would best fit
---
Maoooriiia get ze lawyers
---
Link please! I'd like to watch.
---
Someone  has probably already mentioned this but.... the fast travel "Welcome Mats" from FO4 **were** in the game back during the Beta. They got removed just before launch.
---
For some reason they left them in for Workshops, but they **did** exist for CAMPS but were removed. No idea why, Devs never mentioned reasoning.
---
Yeah I'm gonna hafta.
---
I know right? This community it full of coddled soyboys who want other players to blow sunshine and rainbows up their ass.
---
i installed the famous text mod only a couple of days ago and the people were so helpful and it was so nice to read to the convos going on during those long treks in the wood it just improved my game experience so much im gonna annoy my friends until they get it too lol
---
Im fairly sure I got some just some hours ago. Even with my alt who has junk weight reduction, I put valuable junk like flux into stash.
---
I figured this out with the first challenge to craft film. "Craft 50 film." Nope, craft 80 something and only get credit for 48. You actually needed to craft 5 batches, no matter how big the batch. The most recent film challenge was only 48 (4 batches) so Bethesda knows what's up.
---
Level 80 and solo launched my first nuke on Saturday. Unfortunately the server pop was low and didn't have enough join in's to take down the queen.
---
I love how people keep suggesting NPCs despite Bethesda saying there won’t be NPCs in the game
---
The reason is that because they were duped, they are within the reach of people who trade, besides lucky few who rolled them. I am a happy owner of totally unique one, but I also happen to have an expanding portfolio of ones I suspect were duped, because nobody sane who would have them wouldn't trade them if they hadn't have access to "supply". Supplies exists, adapt or be eaten.
---
I'm so sick of every other freakin' game doing Battle Royale. I've never seen a more obvious "ME TOO!" development cycle in games than everybody rushing to copy the Hunger Games as their main game mode.
---
The original Doom defined deathmatch, and sure, everybody copied Doom's winning formula early on, but there's really only so many ways to do a free-for-all deathmatch that's unique. Battle Royale is so specific, and it seems like damn near every game is desperate to copy that formula.
---
I really hope that's not the case.
---
They use these though when they add new content. Buildings that were there previously closed now have an open door - the frat houses in morgantown were previously boarded up. So was the nukashine building. Taxidermy in lewisberg etc.
---
Would be awkward if your camp got removed because it was now the next dlc mission location.
---
Instigating handmade even a one * does serious damage
---
Anti armor or quad for that extra clip size. He'll even a double one would put it on lmg size clip. Explosive is still one of the best secondary perks though in terms of automatic weapons and bloodied (even if you're not running a bloodied build) is still insane on top of explosive.
---
I'm not on right now but I can't remember if it should ask you to store it then as well. 
---
I'd  test it with one vendor first, is it was when vendors first came out that I used this trick/bug/feature.
---
Had a scorchbeast take out mine after I made a sale. To another player. Sigh. Looking for a new camp and stable flux to fix my decontamination arch. I want to have to so players can heal up for free. But that is expensive to fix. 😞 
---
I always kill enemies when I see them at camps. And fix broken items when I find them. #goodkarma
---
Again, you're complaining about you not being able to get basically free money from daily challenges. If they were all chance based, that would also be fine. You're not entitled to completing all challenges, or the currency they give.
---
Mhm, what about like a FE Handmade then? And is Anti Armor really that effective?
---
Feels like both. People want content, don't want to pay for it.
---
Roger that. I’m a wartime veteran and just wanted to toss my two cents in. Official definitions aside, it’s a good time to say thank you to someone you know who has served or is serving. Just like on Veterans Day we remember all who have or currently do serve, Memorial Day is along the same lines to me. Much love!
---
 Give them a sound like nirnroot. When they're in a container you can just kind of hear it pulsing nearby.
---
Central Ontario
---
I think the biggest things to keep in mind is that visitors spawn near the vending machines. So having the vending machines isolated from other structures may help. Barring that, having foundations set as low to the ground as possible so if someone does spawn in them, they'll be more likely to 'pop' up on top of them, as foundations are taller than dwellers.
---
Agreed. Kids don't like it when you bring it up.
---
Oh interesting. I have 15 and I use them regularly. I wonder if you get to a certain amount if you stop getting them. 🤔
---
My base is right on the street near white springs and the vending machine is outside right by the front door. Everything else is unlocked for those that need it.
---
The difference is night and day from what I've experienced. I mean you're straight up ignoring damage resistances. If you slap the anti armor mag your handmade with the FE effect I imagine it would do some work. Even my quad non explosive radium does work because of the armor pwnetrating mag
---
Then this song plays: https://youtu.be/HBhW5rgQFr0
---
Damn straight, I use ExPA and do that, but carrying fusion cores is a drag
---
If you dont have anyone in 45 minutes ill be on!
---
A+ for unintentional irony.
---
nope, I have a pet snallygaster that drools.
---
Guess I’ll scrap the pos.
---
I'm one of the ones who paid 60 bucks at launch, hated the buggy, barren map, and quit before level 10. I came back this month cause Wild Applachia and vendors sounded cool, and whoa -- the game has completely turned itself around. So I started actually doing the quests and wow...I'll always miss human NPCs, but the human characters we do hear from through tapes almost all NAIL the acting.
---
Yeah, most of the time I don't even notice I've caught a disease until several minutes later.
---
That would be really cool. They could make it resemble the old BBS services from the 80s and 90s. I'm sure people would be really annoyed with it in the name of "convenience" but I'd prefer the immersive quality.
---
The only time I won’t is if they have all their shit locked.  No share, no care.
---
I personally won't pay more than 3c apiece for screws...
---
For what its worth, Battle royale isn't confirmed. This speculation is starting to be obnoxious.
---
I couldn’t agree with you more. However,  I enjoy the rigour and demand of being a common shopkeep. This destruction is the game’s way of charging you a tax. It’s the cost of doing business. 
---
Pleading for common courtesy is one approach, but creativity is the best one. Better design, strategic defences, location, location, location..
---
I, for one, like the added challenge. Minor gripes aside, sometimes life in the wasteland is a little easier than it really should be.
---
I don’t want my home destroyed, but as any wastelander knows from first hand experience: shit always be breakin’.
---
Yeah that's why the get stuck in the foundation because it's nearly double their height.
---
Energy damage.
---
I found a level 10 player’s camp yesterday and the sad design screamed newbie  player.  Out front of his door was a single turret that was broken and a wall was missing.  I repaired both only to come by 5 mins later to find the turret in a mess again.  It wasn’t a great spawn point and was a highway for creatures but I’ve done this a number of times before.
---
Would make sense that the only people infected aren't just wearing civilian clothing..
---
I'd actually enjoy a BR in the game, I think. Without Perk Cards and Items which are locked in the mode. Winner gets a cool item, caps and a bunch of xp. Probaby being the "Overseer rank" which can be seen in the German Version of the game.
---
Do rifleman and commando. 
---
Eventually you’ll have all 3 rifleman cards at 3. Then get them each at 1. Do the same w/ Commando (both 1 and 3) ... so when you want to swap in glow sight, maybe go more automatic than not, etc. you have options and you don’t have to move around perks too much.
---
You can try fast traveling to somewhere else (Morgantown worked for me) and walk there to avoid crashes. Although this worked for me it might not work for you.
---
Fair enough, not trying to be an asshole by the way even though it comes across like that.
---
Aye, It just seems kind of random to me, plus it is pretty confusing, though I do hear if works wonders on chunky enemies
---
Bandolier 2 perk makes 5mm weightless
---
There are tons of them, I’m sure they won’t *all* be used for new content. Hell, they should add more while they’re at it.
---
It's so obscure, I cannot find it. If you get a chance to throw out a link, it could be less obscure. Thanks.
---
Trying to figure if there was a way to increase it beyond 1670.
---
After all, running's for chumps.
---
You ever come home after a nuke has been dropped on your CAMP? Talk about being f\*\*\*ed flat...
---
As to enemy spawns, I sort of think of it as the cost of doing business in a high traffic area near Whitesprings. Personally I don't mind if folks let things gnaw on my infrastructure as attempting to help can get you wanted if you're not not a clean shot.
---
On the flip side I tend to kill enemies if I find them, regardless of locale. Try to help out where I can and if I get tagged as wanted, well lucky you as I'll stand there like a duff and die calmly to get the tag removed.
---
Pretty hard to offend me lol. Enjoy your day!
---
https://youtu.be/2ozb_Ui0ohM I got the name wrong lol
---
My CAMP used to have cats spawning in, and some puts would shoot them at least daily.
---
You too bud!
---
And to add to your suggestion, they could do something unique with a Sheepsquatch and call it a Krampus for an event or something.
---
I'm on PC sorry.
---
wow :(
---
all good
---
weird, i had the same issue, and nothing works. ive reverted my laptop to primary monitor and it wont open.I have my ingame setting to monitor 1 but still
---
I don't know why this keeps getting bumped to zero votes. I have the same issue, I've had the game since launch but I don't get a lot of time to play. 
---
What I *think* happens is that mobs will spawn when the high level guys run through an area and if you spawn in around then they'll still be left over. 
---
There's a map out there that someone made awhile back detailing what areas are best for what level to play in (roughly), I'm actually looking for it at the moment because I can't find any side quests to do (level 25) and leveling up feels painfully slow.
---
Read the OP. He calls people just enjoying the game Jeri's and leechers. Aggressiveness justified.
---
Hmm don't think I've heard of a cap. I can hit 30+ strength eith my unyielding and I'm pretty sure i get the +5lbs extra carry weight for every point.
---
However, charisma is the exception it seems. While you can raise charisma to 20+, their really isn't much point. Highest perk card is rank 5, so you'd only ever need 15 pts to share a rank 5 card.
---
As for vendor sales, it seems everything has a max value for selling and buying. For example i can't sell mutation serums for more than 500 caps, regardless of how high i can boost my charisma.
---
OMG the lore!! The LORE! How ever will i go on if the lore doesn't fit into what i think it should!?!
---
And here's what i really think about this topic 
---
NO ONE IS FORCING YOU TO PLAY A MODE YOU DONT WANT TOO.
---
No enemy spawns in my base only above and far enough enough away they get stuck
---
If it ain't locked, it ain't stealing!
---
tl;dr
---
Got noobs and bad players already complaining about thirst and hunger bitching about it no way they gonna allow more hardcore diseases
---
Yes. Boycott challenges.... Because BGS is giving you a way to earn premium currency.... But it's too hard.....
---
Quit whining and buy atoms if it's too hard. Problem solved. It's not like you're not getting all the other content for free ...
---
I pay 4 or 5
---
once I spawned inside of a locked camp that was under attack. they freed me and I killed them for it...
---
your right so every successful Online game out there should jave a BR mode even if it doesnt fit the rest of the game ....
---
Please don't tell others how to play a game.
---
Tried both ends of my camp, on the floor outside and inside! Its. Always a random position not effected by it for me!
---
Or BGS could do what alot of games do.... And not give you a way to earn premium currency at all.....
---
And make you pay for content. 
---
People complaining about this is a joke.
---
&gt;level 1Wallace\_and\_Vomit2 points · 
---
Agreed. Don't tell me how to play.
---
this entire game was essentially to cash in on fortnite hype. i think all we can do is be thankful it lasted this long without it. and then wait about 8 months till the next wave of dlc and hope its not more pvp.
---
Honestly if combat werent so janky id be into pvp. but with all the duped epic gear in the world and the horrible combat system it doesnt seem logical. as a melee user i find combat beyond lacking. its simply stand there and swing left to right. and ranged vs melee combat in pvp is especially ridiculous, even more so considering the "VATS rush" that was supposedly to help even the playing field with melee doesnt even work, there is no way melee builds will survive in a battle royale.
---
Nice tip I'll use that next time I'm ready to move. 
---
Right now I use the Whitesprings robots for security.
---
Oh sigh, whatever I love my handmade tse and plasma gatling. 😿
---
Yes. They don't give a fuck .... By giving you a way to earn premium currency at all....which many games don't ....
---
Or make you pay for new content.....
---
The people complaining about this, guaranteed all earned participation ribbons at track and field day at school ....
---
exactly.  i have 4 purifiers: 2 are locked, 2 are free for all comers.
---
because its easier to not have to keep track of im guessing
---
Keep scraping ones you find and you’ll learn it
---
Junkie builds. Probably the most versatile build  in my opinion. Better damage than two shot, and you dont have to run around with no health like bloodied. You get 10% damage buff per withdrawal effect, capped at 5 withdrawals. The only downside is the hit to your special stats. But it only affects your passive gains from special. If you have 15 Str, you can still place 15 perks, you just lose carry weight, and melee damage. Which you can avoid hits to strength by the drugs you choose. Mine are mostly hits to my charisma, so my buying an selling prices are crap. I get around this by having a few cheap unyeilding armor pieces, go irradiate myself, then go sell stuff.
---
It said that would be the case in the patch notes when they introduced item renaming.
---
Odd that it would be even an option of on energy weapons if it doesn’t work. They really need to revamp some loot tables and legendary effects. Like weightless. Yea it’s an ok effect but it’s not really all that sought after since to sacrifice so much can’t mix and match since chameleon won’t work.
---
Some effects they are on the right track but need tweaking. I tend to say the same about mutations. I’d love for them to add more or add a card like stranger in numbers if you are solo. Maybe a good and drink deal. You don’t need one out of the two but the one you pick dissolves faster. Like mixing between carnivore and speed demon.
---
Regardless, there’s work to be done. I killed three sheepsquaches and never got a legendary. I’m wondering if that’s partially why I’m noticing less activity on events. Or if it’s just people getting lucky with the legendary vendor and now they have no idea what to do with their time since you can only get 150 scrip a day.
---
Sure, free exp but sometimes when you fast travel to someones camp (or in some cases to a location near one) you end up spawning inside their fortress and in the owners infinte wisdom they've locked every door with a level 3 lock for some reason.   
---
If you're low on caps or don't want to spend the next 15 minutes getting to where you wanted to go in the first place its very tempting letting a small horde of super mutants tear down a exit wall for you.   
---
Its either that or getting a 5 cap bounty on you for actually helping the guy out by picking the lock and kill the invaders, only for a cloaked xXxRanger69xXx with a legendary two shoot explosive 10+ damage to players 50 cal machinegun to spawn right out nowhere and rekt you extra hard for trying to protect someones camp to begin with.
---
Think you do but the effect is hardly noticeable
---
Three star... Drill.
---
Because it'd be 3 seconds before they're flooded with terrible racist names. It's an annoyance but so much easier on BGS to just not allow it
---
I don't think there's actual cap but it might be really hard to find use for really high stats. Various effects could have cap, thinking things like AP pool.
---
Sad thing with uranium fever spawning outside then going through the door into the mine and it still does it.
---
I leave all my benches outside, and leave the door open, but with a lock on it.  That way they can close the door and hide inside to escape if they need  (either run out the other side, or wait out the fast travel timer).  There's a sign by the door reminding them they can step through the big paned windows upstairs if they lock themselves in.
---
This means my camp gets busted from time to time, but it's cheap to fix.  I mean, I'm camped next to a fissure anyway, so nbd.
---
Right on, I'll have to adjust my prices.
---
Yep.  
---
I can vouch .... I participated in THREE in a row of these on the server I was on.   Three SBQ events in 15 minutes, from blast to death to blast to dearth to blast to death .... Impressive.
---
Right up to the point about 4-5 of you posse turned their high powered explosive guns on me at the end of it all, and killed me in about 3 seconds (Adventure/Pacifist Mode .... Impressive, considering the damage buffer).  Then took about 12 Stable Flux, 30 Black Titanium and the rest of the junk loot I had earned while expending 4000 rounds of my own ammo  to help.
---
Not Cool.
---
That would be pretty awesome actually, a Sheepsquatch with black fur, and a unique name! Maybe even have it tangled up in trimmings!
---
Huh, never realized how effective the effect is, so you just take enough drugs till you pretty much od, then you’re fine from there?
---
what the hell bot XD
---
Some of those just seem like joke prices. Like ,I have the Plan for the Ivory grip priced at 7676c and a torn Mothman wing priced at 6666.
---
I also base my prices on what perks the weapon/armour has and what it is.  I just sold a 1\* bloodied lever action for 1,200caps. 
---
I also put all the good mods on most of the weapons I sell (Hardened receiver, suppressor, perforating/stinging mag, a good long barrel,,etc) I don't just put the stock weapon in the vendor. I trick it out. Just in case that person hasn't unlocked all the parts for it yet.
---
 I'll put BoS paint on all combat stuff I sell, deep pockets on all gear I sell and the max DR mods for other armours.  I'll sell popular stuff for a bit more than lesser wanted things.  I'll sell a 3\* Unyeilding with a weight reduction perk for 2kish. But a 3\* armour with  ghoul/mutant//robot for primary, I'll sell for 1,500ish if it has a weight reduction perk.
---
So, I'm also using my own stuff to help sell it, to try and make back a few caps in the materials i put into them. I'll also use them a bit sometimes and repair it to 200%.
---
I get a decent amount of kills in PVP, but every single time I'm killed it's by an automatic TSE with someone running bloodied/cavaliers or marsupial and chameleon.
---
I have 40+ nuke cards. I can't stop collecting them. And honestly, I just randomly come across the nuke card carrier bots, especially in Watoga. When you see them flying over head shoot 'em down. I don't know if I just happen to be in the right place, right time... but when I see one, I shoot it down.
---
Play with your sound on. I hear vertibirds all the time. Especially around the savage divide. They cross over either direction.
---
Id go melee, having points in your strength is always a must anyways. And melee weapons dont need ammo, so if you run out of rifle ammo, youll always have something to kill with. Id go unarmed honestly, the weapons typically weigh less, and they do some really good damage.
---
Whenever I have a bunch of water purifiers, I always leave at least one unlocked.  If you're playing with speed demon, you need to horde water, and it sucks when someone comes and cleans you out.  But sharing at least a little is good.
---
I price based on the level, item, and the effects. 1star nocturnal? It gets Scripped. 1star Bolstering? Max level? Heavy Combat/metal/robot/Marine? 400-500. 3star Unyielding with 1 charisma and lockpicking? 1k. 3star unyielding with Powered and WWR/Cavalier/sentinel? 10k minimum. That’s a god roll. If I wanted to advertise it it’s a trade-only equivalent item. 
---
It all depends on the value of the effects, base item, and level. Supply and demand. Demand is for max level, certain types of armor, and certain legendary effects. So if I have the supply that meets that demand, I am going to price accordingly. 
---
Do i sell like crazy? No. But I am comfortable with how much I sell, and I know from using the trading subreddits that there is a market for what I have and the prices I mark.
---
I fast traveled to a camp a few days ago, checked their water, and as I was leaving I heard a mole rat gnawing at the guy's generator. It was behind a locked door, so I picked the lock, killed there critter, but got 10 wanted bounty.
---
Feels like I should have gotten a "good Samaritan" pass.
---
Yep, memorized his username.
---
What quests are you trying to do? Stay on west side until you're decent level or have good gear. While it's true enemies scale, that's not always the case. For example if I'm in the Forest area, doesn't matter how high i am, highest scorched I'll encounter is a level 6.
---
You should be looking for things to do in Forest area first, basically area around vault76. Then go north to Toxic Valley, for a bit higher levels. Then Ash Heap which is South corner of map. THEN eventually you hit Savage divide and make journey over into East Side of map where all enemies will basically be 60+ 
---
Do a quick google search, 'fo76 level map', you'll find tons of images outlining the regions based on enemy levels.
---
I’m not cool with immaturity, no. You want to call that fussy? You do you
---
I'd be happy with any ranged weapon that had anti-armor, bloodied, quad, vampire or two shot as a primary (5 in 23), and explosive as a major (1 in 10). So that's 5 / 230 which is close to 2% if you ignore any weapons that cannot have that primary/major combination. It's unlikely but still attainable.
---
If I limited that to just 10 weapons then that becomes approx. 0.2%, at which point I would just give up.
---
I've had 2 of these already, an AAE black powder rifle and a QE Handmade.
---
If someone locks their benches/rad arch up behind doors and walls, I'm make sure not to kill anything.
---
Otherwise, I defend and even fix friendly camps as a rule.
---
Only ever got the heavy from roses quest .. so if you don't get the plan delete the char and try again! yay! i did it 3 times lol .. apparently though theres supposed to be a drop chance at uranium fever and one violent night

This account is accurate and correct.

Just be wary.  This group shoots and steals all of your earned Flux after they are done with the SBQ.

They are so powerful of a Posse, that the damage buffers of Adventure mode are meaningless to them.

Doesn't Serendipity not work while in Power Armor?
---
That’s right! It’s in the main office on the desk. The bunker is also down one of the pipes outside if I remember correctly... haven’t been there since like BETA
---
Plus once you get to the upgrades,...got mine refrigerated so I was able to sub out Good With Salt for armor and weapon repair perks.
---
....so energy weapons.
---
I got a Quad Revolver with 250 DR while reloading and 33% Vats accuracy from the Legendary vendor today...it takes forever to reload...I forget if I scripped it or if I was gonna put it in my vendor..lol
---
I picked up a 1\* Anti Armour Gauss rifle awhile back for 150c and it's been amazing. it replaced my Anti Armour Railway Rifle, which I've since upgraded to an Explosive Executioner's Railway Rifle.
---
This needs to be a thing
---
Had this happen several times when my camp was by Harper's Ferry. The turrets would just vanish, but the power cable would still be there. Oddly, they'd randomly reappear weeks later. At one point I had 20+ missile turrets around my base, often stacked one on top of the other when they randomly reappeared. 
---
I sent tons of screenshots in bug reports to prove I wasn't exploiting as I was so worried about getting reported.
---
I have a level 0 lock on my front door so I can craft without being attacked by clever door-opening molerats. I try to remember to leave it open when I go out, but folks can just jump onto my deck to get inside if they want to craft... and I keep two or three stash boxes on the front porch, so you can ALWAYS dump your junk.
---
can you tell me with diferente mods changes Heavy raider armor appearance? Because i saw a couple of models for it. I want this one:

---
I hate to be cynical but I genuinely think that the only reason they are adding Battle Royale is because they are unhappy with the relatively small player base and want more people playing the game so they decided to jump onto the Battle Royale bandwagon.  And they might be late to that party.
---
Assuming that Nuclear Winter will add Battle Royale, I think it would attract the wrong people.  PvP in this game is just awful.  I also remember them saying that there would be no Battle Royale.  I just prefer they work on PvE content and making the game better and not focus on PvP content.  Maybe add new weapons and fix CAMP building first?
---
The recipes are only available from the enclave now. Player Vendors may be selling ones they got from the SBQ previously, but they’re crazy if they sell them for less than 17,000, because absolute best price you can buy them from the Enclave is 17,500.
---
Serums I price at 500, just above vendor price.
---
No other Fallout involved taking photos. What they've suggested makes perfect sense.
---
Looking forward to having enough badges for the fridge, I want to swap out my good with salt too, that’s going to be really handy
---
Useless in PA, you don’t take limb damage in PA. 
---
For other builds, see how it goes. I’d say play without it for a while, see how often you take enough limb damage to get crippled, and how much it bugs you.
---
I’ve been doing the daily and weekly challenges since release. They gotten ridiculous. Many times they do not even register. Now they are a part of an actual quest line; pioneer scout. They should have fixed challenges before using them in this way.
---
Veggies/fruit are all instanced, too, so if you take everything at a player's base it's still available for them.
---
4500 thumbs up for this.
---
Exactly. You dont have to continuously use chems to get the effect. Its based off of withdrawals, not chem use or addictions. So if your addicted to med-x, you wont get the damage buff until you start to withdrawal from it. The best way to go about getting addicted is getting 5-6 of each chem of your choice. Then just main line all 6 as rapidly as you can. Best way to get chems in general is killing ghouls, theres almost always some kind of chem on them. Id suggest farming "One Violent Night" event at the Sons of Dane compound.
---
I wish you luck on your journey.

I have a similar tale of being stalked by the Flatwoods monster.. beware.  
---
i first encountered him in the cliffs near grafton.  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/3qcW2Ya.png](https://i.imgur.com/3qcW2Ya.png) 
---
One sneak shot later he disappears.  
---
Then he was literally underneath my house.  
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/qGHu8lu.png](https://i.imgur.com/qGHu8lu.png) 
---
Again, gone after first shot.  
---
i encountered him once more in the cliffs east of Berkeley Springs Station.   
---
I didn't manage to catch a screen shot of him this time, but he again vanished after a single shot.  
---
I am anxious about my next encounter.
---
Yeah wtf, I don't have access to stats but I am sure like 10% of this games playerbase actually care about PvP, its broken as shit. Adding a lot of pvp content  makes no sense
---
There will be new when Nuclear Winter starts, I think. I mean... They changed it for Wild Appalachia too
---
[](/lcewat)Do you have a nocturnal handmade? Wish it was worth the same as an anti armor handmade? Well, do I have a renaming feature for you!
---
I had been getting this with just a couple of legendary gatling guns I had.  Recently, I bought a legendary Deathclaw Gauntlet.  I immediately freaked out when it wasn't where it was supposed to be alphabetically... until I noticed that there were two listings of a uniquely-named Cultist Blade and, sure enough, one of them was the gauntlet.  It took on the name of a different weapon.  The only similarity they shared was the SS effect.  Then, while I was fiddling with names, trying unsuccessfully to get another name to "stick", it started stealing hot air key of my other deathclaw gauntlet.  This reset each time I logged onto a server and eventually I just got fed up with it and put the gauntlet in my vending machine.
---
I'm still a low lvl and I've had a couple nice guests leaving me gifts! But last week 2 peeps in "anonymous" (?) masks and their friend in PA. came visiting-- PA person just stood by me, but the other 2 were going crazy in my humble abode. Jumping on and off my bed, tables, racing around. I gave them the "confused" emote and finally just decided to sign off...i heard a guy and girl laughing "oh she's leaving." Duh, yeah.
---
Noted then, I’ll make sure to see if I can find anything good with that effect, thanks man
---
Oi! I had no idea what was going on until you said that. Now I can't unsee it 😲

---
The only one I've heard of is charisma stops affecting prices after 20
---
No problem. Glad to get more junkies in the wastes. ;) haha
---
Generally yes, rads to keep max HP low.
---
Key to staying in the fight - Serendipity perk is a big one. Also some use mysterious stranger perk that has a chance to revive. Then there is also the auto stim gear.
---
And outside of SBQ, killing pretty much everything in one shot helps :) my base damage before I start banging Fury, whiskey, and other melee buff is around 1200-1500.
---
My quad and two shot are limb dmg. Def my favorite two.

Yeah cause that's remotely close to anything I've said...

Yeah I was wondering that part as I use them myself, my computer is slightly below minium specs, and I see no problems unless the bodies flying around want to be counted for.
---
I ended up going to areas that weren't populated to see if the mobs were still super high level and they scaled back to my level so I'm pretty sure as long as there isn't any higher level players around you your good.
---
So what are you crashing 'cause I ain't, on PC anyway.
---
How odd of an encounter!  This is part of the reason I play!  I see some really weird stuff (this coming from an ex-Rust player) and absolutely love it!  
---
  I had a lowbie catch me amidst a small herd of Brahmin in a clown suit, milking them. I didn’t have my mic but she just said hi there and backed away, continued on!  Emote wave and laugh. :). These types of moments are the ones I crave and love.

I am intrigued by the anon masks. Where can I get one?

This is true, but do you really want to have to look carefully at every weapon in a machine? And can you imagine the countless threads of people who bought something without paying close attention?

I'm pretty sure it's for the best.

Home Defense 3.  Build like you want your camp to survive a molerat.
---
Im certainly willing to wait for it to release and get a bug fix or two into its life before passing final judgement..
---
I hope they can pull off a fun mode to shut up haters...
---
F**k yo couch
---
I think having the fight inside the nuke zone makes it more of a challenge so I agree. Now that the servers seem more stable (?).  You do get more mobs spawning etc and the flux crafting materials are more available.
---
I think you can do it so many times outside the blast zone and it gets too predictable.
---
I might have to check them out again then. That slap damage was annoying.  I've had a few (boring) stories about times others tried to agro me with slap damage. Don't people have anything better to do with their time?
---
You copy pasted this response lol. Get madder over someone elses good idea

Are you running fullscreen?  What resolution are you using?  HDMI or DVI?  Do you have Nvidia in-game overlay enabled?  What Nvidia driver version?

If you are pc ill build it for you

That really sucks but now you can make new memories
---
only locked door i have is my bedroom on the second floor.  if people are spawning in there, then something is seriously arwy.
---
I’m not sorry :/
---
I'd like a sigh and eyeroll please.
---
I mean, it's better than it used to be.  I'd say about 75% of the time they're using the same weapon type as in their inventory. Baring melee weapons, there it's a crapshoot.
---
All good

I'm 108, and probably 60 levels are from crafting.  :)

just give me the club penguin server browser I'm being serious every server has a name then a number

hey man what server are you on

Nuka cola 4

ok cool be on in a sec
---
The one in the trash can had never worked. The name will not appear.
---
This has been happening to me in Survival too. I’m really starting to question how many people are actually playing it. Maybe there just aren’t that many servers running for Survival.
---
Don't do direct trades with non-trusted players.   
---
One way to work around the issue you're having is both of you list your item for the same high-cap value in a camp vending machine.  You both buy the item for that value, and no one gets screwed.
---
Nope
---
I live in the savage divide so I see the cargobot and escort alot and shoot them down whenever I see them
---
I iust want a fun game mode. Fuck the haters
---
im not against pvp, but whatever happened to "go out and rebuild america". i would rather see the pvp focused content wait until the game has truly ran it course. lets get some story additions and some world changing events, and then when all ideas are exhausted throw up some battle royale or whatever and let people aimlessly kill each other.
---
It seems to be going the other way though. keep us busy with pvp until they release other content. which could work. i just dont think pve players are likely to stick around until wastelanders comes. not if theyve already burned up all the current content. But i shall definitely try to withhold the salt until release. it could be awesome and interesting, as of now though i stand with most people, pvp, to me is not going to make this game any better. i personally would like them to explore the fact that we all lived in the same vault for 25 years. i feel there should be more team focused stuff, not stuff pitting us against eachother. i mean sure there would have been a few bad apples in the vault but i like to think most of them never would have made it out in the first place. to me personally i feel pvp flies directly against the purpose of the "Story" maybe if factions got introduced first, and you could align with a faction it would make sense. raiders vs responders vs free state and so on. However at the current time us killing each other feels moronic. simply killing each other because we bored?? doesnt seem to make sense to me. boredom wouldnt play into wasteland survival. there might be some feuding over resources. but again since we all supposedly lived together for 25 years you would assume we would be more inclined to work together, and i feel game modes and and new content should reflect that. then when and if factions get introduced let us pick one and war against eachother then. of course this is all just my opinion. its possible that many people, devs included just want an endless battle royale with no logic behind it. either way its very unlikely to "kill" the game.
---
Woah guys we got a legit player over hear.  Sorry I doubted you.
---
Trade sub pls.
---
I might have an extra one you can have I'm on PS4 it would be a 1* if I have it.

If you are on PC, I have chameleon chest piece for sale. 60 caps for 1\* item.

---
Also: I'm definitely seeing that same bright terrain issue, and it's obnoxious.  Although it's completely random for me.  I saw it on a fairly fresh spawn into a world with a nuke zone.
---
I just moved the other day off a spot very close to the motel in Flatwoods. My goal was to get visited by new players following the questline; it worked sometimes, but not to the extent I wanted it to so I've picked up and gone elsewhere.
---
The majority of damage my camp took there was crop and Brahmin damage from the 3 mole rats that live at the motel and the 3 mutts that spawn a hundred or so yards north of there and kill my cow constantly.
---
When they dont do anything it sucks. But once i had a dude who fought a swarm of cave crickets off at level 28, died a LOT, but repaired everything they destroyed and killed the whole swarm. Thats the good way to do it and i thank you profusely, mysterious stranger.
---
AND there are many more opportunities to ineract with REAL people which is arguably better than NPCs. This is helped by many of the more violent players playing on the Survival servers. Don't get me wrong, playing on the survival servers were great fun but I started to lose hope because my sentinel melee build wasn't working out too well.
---
So I didnt get a request. But I am on, if ya see me send an invite.
---
The devs should really really give enemies a setting for if they care about wrecking your shit or not. 
---
If a Scorched pops in, ok, makes sense he’d wreck my place. 
---
But ... a bug? A dog? A mole rat? Why do they have a hardon for wrecking walls and generators? It doesn’t make any sense and it doesn’t make the game better.
---
If you go into the sub-basement during the feeding stage on the lower floor there's a terminal and you can get a shutdown code off this terminal you then run back up to the main AI when she's turned off the Mr. Handy will be in charge of the event and then formula Q will be automatically fed to the animals between rounds

Also check your backpack in the crafting table the Arktos paint unlocks automatically and does not give you a schematic I got it the other day and didn't even realize until I checked it

Wat armor would best be used for these build
---
Sorry, no. Energy damage.
---
Considering you were only level 16 going against a horde of level 42 ghouls (and above), you are fortunate to come out alive... I actually thought there was going to be a twist at the end wherein one of your shotgun blasts hit one or more of the robots and the bots turned against you!
---
This has happened to me a fair few times. If bethesda hadn't nerefed the campfire trick so I could never build my base again, I'd move to a cliffside so those asshats would face a nice, long drop if they decide to try to mess with my crap.
---
How about a visitors book where you take and post a selfie of your character, and it gets tagged with your username? That’d be cool!!

You may have been “informed” by people with out of date info. Up until patch 8 or so, there was no option to re-craft the standard receiver if you added a prime receiver. Patch ~8 added the standard receiver to the crafting options.

"how do I do a thing? Maybe I should be a sack of shit, that's a good idea, right?"

He didnt let the vault dweller in because he was too afraid of change. Because of that, while the protagonist founded arroyo, which would go on to become a prosperous settlement, the people in vault 13 were murdered and experimented on by the enclave. His intentions were good but then so are everyone else's.

Try this: Open the social/friendslist tab, select your name at the very top, and click 'leave server/world'. Don't use the list which also shows options and photomode etc.
---
Should always put u on a new server when you rejoin one :)
---
That's exactly what mine looks like it's buttressed pneumatic
---
Not worth it for randoms to bother defending people's bases.. a couple errant shots and you're wanted (unless that's not how it works anymore, haven't played in a couple months). Besides, that is what turrets and defenses are for.. and even if your whole base gets leveled, mats are infinitely available and you can repair your whole base in less then a second by interacting with the CAMP
---
Looks like heavy metal let’s and right arm. Sturdy metal left arm. Heavy (sturdy?) raider chest?
---
I'm not excited for any PVP content. I'm doubly not excited for new PVP content that's rumored to pretty much piss on the core game mechanics for the game.
---
RA, RL, LL are heavy Raider, LA is Sturdy, I think the chest is Sturdy.
---
I believe that's the raider armor
---
I would be down if the new made creates new ways to play and get loot :)
---
I’m good, got one with perception at the moment I’m just greedy, gotta get that number
---
Responders vendors
---
k thank you dude, I just wish the devs would fix this
---
"this game would be better if it was completely unlike this game!" Look. Minecraft has it's place. It's a crafting world with a lot of permanence. You can shape the infinite landscape to your whims.   
---
It's exactly nothing like fallout.
---
It does not work. I swapped in Dodgy in its place.
---
Thx man,really feld like a victory
---
Mutant slayer is 30% damage against Super Mutants. TS is 25% damage against everything. Explosive is 20/32% more damage (unperked/perked). 
---
Easy math from there.
---
My supplies are too low to help you out sorry but I strongly suggest good with salt perk. It makes raw flux last a lot longer before it expires to inert
---
Would be nice to have some power armored varients too!
---
So TSE regardless, if I’m understanding you right.
---
The game keeps track of silo cool down times on the Missile Silo State Holotape
---
Wow, so you’re just greedy and demanding.  Got it.
---
Yep, the Xbox just “pooped” out this morning. It just stopped working, seemed fine to me, thought it was the game. rip.
---
I agree duped items have nothing to do with how pvp is going. It's just one type of build will always be more favorable. Imo pvp in this game sucks anyways and is very unbalanced but that's why I dont play the pvp part at all. Way I see it if you dont likenin dont play it stick to adventure.
---
Watoga. Phoenix. Welch. Lewisburg. Harpers Ferry.
---
The trade system from Fallout 1/2 would actually solve this!
---
It's a boring, badly implemented mechanic. The ironic part is that it's actually significantly more secure than the codes on Americas nukes for..well, the first few decades?
---
So after an enormous verbose explanation, you're just an asshole.
---
i outfit all my mules that shop and hop with plasma grenades. grenade damage doesnt scale so a level 1 can wipe out packs with them.
---
To be fair, it's the same with like half of the suggestion posts on this sub.
---
Even in adventure mode I'm starting to recognize the same names over and over. Within my ~100 minutes of hopping in survival, I don't think I've seen more than 15-20 unique names on the leaderboards
---
Oh right to get in the place yes. You can get a Fuji card that opens all the keycard doors inside the bunker below. I forgot about the keycard to actually get in.
---
Wasn't us. We cant do the runs that fast. We dont "pre-stage" the silos by running through and sitting on them at the end to drop back-to-back, etc. I personally ran each and every silo either by myself or with friends.
---
Thanks, I'll try it in the future but I'm definitely done for this week's challenge
---
My guys name is scrubs miggy. I don’t think thats good for rp
---
There are kinds of heavy raider armor, i want to know what is that one
---
Should have put that in the title, XB1
---
Between the two, TSE is better overall. But I want to make sure you understand that TS is a primary effect, Mutant Slayer is a primary effect, Explosive is a secondary effect. So you can have a MSE just as well as a TSE. So if you’re just focusing on supermutants, MSE&gt;TSE&gt;MS&gt;TS. If you want a weapon that works well on everything, TSE&gt;TS&gt;MSE&gt;MS. 
---
That’s only comparing the two, and ignoring all the other legendary effects.
---
Where can you get buttress mod ?
---
the air commander vertibot that drop the nuke codes can be picked open just fine 
---
vertibots that drop off their crate and are named vertibot count as stealing if you pick it open and will mark you as wanted thats because someone has summoned it with a U.S. supply requisition holotape at a radio tower

Please don't talk about nerfs I just got my first ever TSE weapon today along with a bloodied explosive pipe pistol thank you player vending( which does insane damage)
---
With my luck with future nerfs the camera will do more damage.
---
Headwear is sack hood with hoses. I can't tell the fine distinctions, but the limbs seem to be a mix of heavy robot and raider armor. Chest seems to be heavy raider
---
And you’re welcome for the right to voice your idiotic opinion.
---
I've been having no luck myself. Now debating if I spend 7k on plan or buy a decent gun. It's always a tough call
---
Plans are at Watoga Phoenix vendor.
---
When I FT to my camp it's on the outskirts. Visitors always spawn on my camp device. I cleared the area around it to help my visitors
---
You are correct. But it does not keep track of your own personal lockout timer for launching a nuke. Say you launch from Silo Alpha, you cannot immediately server hop and launch from Alpha again. You have your own internal cooldown as well. Best as I can remember it is 90 minutes.
---
I dont know what causes it but occasionally in the hills by whitesprings I get 3 scorchbeasts that will spawn in and start having their way with my base.. I just quit as I dont feel like wasting the ammo on them. We just need a base under attack prompt.

Ahh my bad, I misunderstood. Didn’t know that was even a thing. Thanks for the info!
---
Don’t cry about it here
---
the air commander cargobot (or something similar to that) that has an escort of vertibots and is level 15 drops the nuke keys and can be picked open just fine 
---
cargobots that drop off their crate and are named cargobot count as stealing if you pick it open and will mark you as wanted thats because someone has summoned it with a U.S. supply requisition holotape at a radio tower
---
It's a friendly request, not an instruction.
---
True I just don’t want to spend 5k on it

I'd hate to say it, and I know I'm hella late on this thread but whatever, but I think a furious Tesla rifle would be effectively useless since it hits multiple targets at once, so the bonus damage from the furious effect would do squat
---
Me too, except for the enclave armour! I found a 3* raider chest which reduced the weight of all chems by 40% iirc. Weird but pocketed is better than deep pocketed on raider armour. The rest is either strength boosting and/or deep pocketed trapper armour mostly. Also have marsupial and the following perks: pack rat, string back, travelling pharmacy, sturdy frame, bandolier, batteries included, ordinance express and bear arms. 
---
I always thought being able to carry more normally was a glitch but obv not
---
Check the area around smith farm to clarksburg. There's some ruined buildings there that spawn bloat flies. Also one usually on the road from top of the world to beckwith farm. Sometimes you can get 3 of the items for stings and tings there.
---
early on I scrapped all the raider armor pieces I found .. cept the the set I wore .. but once I got the plan I was able to fully make/scrap until I got em all
---
Tamale animals!?! Sounds delicious!
---
For real though, never tried this. Sounds like it needs work.
---
Ok well there’s always ppl offering moding services on market or just ask at any shop in game. GL

I build well-placed turrets to deal with the level 91 Deathclaw that spawns at my camp every time someone comes near. She's very over-zealous on the security when it comes to strangers... Or friends... Or me. She doesn't like anyone. Anyway, the turrets are enough to take her down, guests can shop in safety, she can't hurt my base, and guests can take a potshot or two and get almost 1000 XP and a chance at legendary loot.
---
Note to those who aren't familiar with turret design - turrets need to be paired with spotlights. Turrets are blind. Spotlights let them see at range. Turrets also need line-of-sight, and they need to be placed on elevated positions to keep them out of danger of enemy attack. Nothing makes me more confused than seeing ground-level turrets that are always broken. They're weak. Protect them with physics.
---
Well mines is the same
---
Apparently some servers have better spawn rates
---
Unfortunately you aren't pc player so I just can suggest you to join Scorchbeast Queen (SBQ) events if you see on your map. You will acquire randomly stable fluxes and more as completion reward. Also if you join other nuked areas, save your glowing mass, high radiation fluid (aid) and hardened mass (Junk). They won't spoil so you can craft your fluxes when you gathered floras. Also perception have a perk card that let you get twice flora but I didn't remember perk's name.
---
I’ll keep scrapping then thanks man
---
i feel like the vendor system is not only to allow you to purchase but to promote visiting other camps. if you know all the specific details you are likely to only visit certain camps, thus hampering the social aspect of c.a.m.p and vending.
---
I'm on Xbox :(
---
It isn’t about the lens. It’s about if the name of the target shows up in the upper right of the viewfinder. Problem is the zoom on the 105mm does NOT help with this- you still have to be physically just as close as if you weren’t zoomed in.
---
Buy more atoms! Then they can afford to :)
---
If you’re going to get mutated, get Marsupial too. It makes the game so much better!
---
I hate when people do this method. The animals get themselves killed by charging into the fray everytime.
---
Flux is easier to come by especially after the events with green thumb. SBQ event can get you 6 or 7 crimson and 12 to 17 violet. WS tons of useless yellow, 4-5 crimson 2 Cobalt and 4-5 florescent, harpers ferry 9-12 violet, and a couple of crimson cobalt and Yellow. I'm always running out hardened mass
---
&gt; buttressed pneumatic
---
So you just need any HEAVY RAIDER ARMOR, mod it to buttressed pneumatic and it will look like that?
---
I did too a hour ago. Wondered if it was just me. Even no. Legendary enemy’s had legendary items
---
Ha, is it wrong direction just because you think it is? So much toxicity... You should let off some steam, how about in a nice match of Battle Royale?
---
That's good to know. Does server hopping have ill effects.
---
It does
---
I do the same thing. I have no interest in being a shithead in games. One day someone was building a camp near mine, then a bunch of anglers spawned. No idea why though, I've only seen them near water. Anyways, I hauled ass up the hill and started shooting to draw them away from the neighbors camp. Neighbors didn't know they were there and their turrets weren't shooting. Once they heard me shooting, they came out and started helping. So I ran towards them knowing the turrets would now shoot. Turrets then did the rest. Lol
---
I also keep my crops easy for people to come pick and I leave my water purifiers unlocked. As well as keeping everything at workshops I take unlocked also. I've started using area chat again, so I can tell people at my camp about that. I get tons of hearts and a friend request immediately after every time. Lmao
---
I know a lot of people still don't like that there is multiplayer or have issues with people attacking them, so I like to try and keep the peace. You never know what kind of day someone might be having in-game or out, so I'll always be friendly to everyone I meet.
---
The legs are heavy trapper pieces and the chest is heavy raider.
---
yeah heavy raider .. I'm pretty sure it's the pneumatic that gives it the overhead pipe wrap and the extra chest bar
---
Well at least someone cares right?
---
Thanks lol
---
I wish
---
Give me the mats and 400 caps or give me 1k and I'll craft them for you.
---
We we're getting legendary items off non-legendary
---
fyi we had a bug where it doesn't advance past wave 2. I went down to the coded basement door and killed some of the robots, it advanced.
---
yes!!!!! it never hurts to be friendly.
---
I saw one of these in a vending machine. I didn’t know what it was either...
---
Between my family and work life I don't have enough time to Max my chances for good legendaries. I usually get crap too like quad radium rifle with crit dam, isn't bad but not very good. Also have medics explosive 50 Cal, just wish it was anything but medics basically. I got a broadsider with faster fire rate and two shot, if only that was faster reload. How about ultracite Gatling laser with crit dam? I don't think crit dam matters much on a Gatling laser and that had faster fire rate too which is great for that weapon.
---
Gotten dozens of those. It's junk.
---
Oh I absolutely agree.
---
Use a mic bro. It's only scary talking to people the first few times. Stop by my shack I'll chat you up until you're comfortable conversating.
---
Or. You know. Text chat.
