I have marsupial, bird bones, and speed demon on a rifle build works pretty good. Might add healing factor if I can find it.

Reverse the two shot damage nerf. Explosive was overpowered, not two shot.

Kill "Mr." robots. I've discarded *so* many of these that I've looted.

Bethesda can you stop fucking shit up? Literally, health boost to monsters, Adrenal Reaction is MIA, AP runs out faster than your fat asses can run. Jesus, do you guys even test your "patches" before releasing. You people have an entire WEEK. Get a fucking grip you retarded "Dev" team.

Get out of the forest for the hostile ones, or summon a wise one at the lighthouse with an event

Absolutely no vendors have laser gun plans??? What's with that?

Don't give up on gaming! Get your own account and make it your own. My girlfriend and I play dozens of games together, there's something for everyone. I don't know about PS4, but some of the best games we've played together on Xbox were Castle Crashers, Chariot, lovers in a dangerous spacetime, overcooked, then we got into survival games like 7 days to die and how to survive and don't starve together. Then we started playing more shooters like CoD zombies, and fortnight. You never know what you'll enjoy when it's with a good friend. 
---
I didnt use it incorrectly at all and I just got off work. Something I imagine you must not know about since it seems you have all the time to spend on reddit.
---

---
I dont even have to google it because again it's not a complicated word. You claimed to be an expert,or rather you inferred to be such when you continuously brought up how 'likely' it was for someone to do something much like a hobbyists or like a challenge. Implying you have some understanding of ghe human condition or psyche which as your comments continue is blatantly evident you dont even have a high school level grasp of psychology or perhaps even a grasp of what actual life or living is
---
Lol bye bitches!
---
Yeah that jives with my understanding that everything you pick up is counted toward the running 30-day total, so accumulating 50k ammo, then dropping it and picking it up with a mule would equal 100k on your account. Is that what you mean?
---
Suck it gaia
---
We'll have the ability to name power armor, and weapons in a future patch. Not sure when, but it's on the to do list. 
---
I banned myself after all the DCs, bugs, and client crashes.  I can’t logon again because I uninstalled.
---
No, applies to anything that does ballistic damage, so mostly melee and bullets.
---
PS4 here!
---
Yeah Im pretty sure of that too.
---
Can or has anyone besides my fiancé found the sledgehammer or Deathclaw Gauntlet plans? Cause I know they exist but can’t find them...
---
I'm not alive?   
---
That's what you decided to go with?   
---
  
---
There is a discount cap?
---
Ah, so that's where the super sledge plans are available. Thx
---
If you're Xbox, I actually have the plans for these. 100caps?
---
I hate to say this because this is art, but I hope they fix the fires so this stops because I hate seeing giant concrete block bases while I’m rolling round Appalachia.
---
I had a good run and then this week my last friend (one I met in game after my other friend left) started playing Anthem.
---
And my last three queen attempts have failed. I haven’t failed a queen in 100 attempts. 
---
And then today I mistakenly scrapped my X-01 Torso with Jetpack...because favorited items can be scrapped as easily as a tire iron.
---
There are just too many moments where you get hit right in the gut playing this game. I definitely got my money’s worth but I also realize I’m way too salty about it all. I’ve got to take a break.
---
How do you build that much? My base budget is so tiny
---
Yeah when I make bulk bulk plastic I just can't even.
---
Yep I dont wanna stalk 50 ppl in pacifist jus to fight 3 players . I want the ppl who wanna fight be where I need em lol
---
Since i havent played for like 2 or 3 months my opinion might be outdated, but i was always running a PA .50 cal combo with a bloodied explosive gatling as my backup. Having stabilised (if thats the right name) will work wonders on the 50 cal to the point where you can even engage on medium to long range, as long as you 2 or 3 burst

---
ok too bad, would be nice to try decorate with walls, but that's ok, still looks cool, I am more interested in an inpeneratble bunker .. I am going to experiment .. I will show you what I do. My area won't be as nice, I like your cosy bunker, but I want to see what I can do .. you could also build a fake front entrance with a concrete block behind it lol, so they can take out a door and 3 walls for shits and giggles .. I will see
---
indeed.  I feel like the skill cap is awfully low once you are geared up.  I can mostly 1 hit everything with instigating 2 hander, but walking out of the vault, many creatures would take a couple swipes with any weapon. 
---
First of all: i feel you. This game is still to beta to be enjoyed properly.
---
Second: big props to you for still sticking around, i gave up 3 months ago
---
Lmao whatever. Look at unstable economies, just simply giving everyone access to massive reserves of cash from “nowhere” has always caused trouble. 
---
Post WW1 Germany. Late 2000’s Zimbabwe. Post WW2 Hungary. If everyone has 25k caps, and can easily get almost 5000 caps a day, what is that realistically being spent on? 5k caps will buy you any outfit you want, 10-15k will buy you god tier weapons, but people won’t want to sell anything because money can be sooooo easily made at 24 different vendors, they’ll almost always be at max caps.
---
I bought the signs &amp; letters plan for 10k +/- at the vendor, and within 2 days I was back at max caps. 2800 from vendoring shit, and the rest was selling ammo etc. 
---
And for the ones that are trading, people will want more money, because the money they do have has less buying power because everyone has more of it. (AKA classic hyperinflation)
---
Remove and reapply fixes adrenal reaction (kick in at lower health now, under 60%)

---
You could just starve and slowly die of thirst. You won't actually die from it
---
10/10 would boop snoot 
---
Just because it's a strategy, doesn't make it not a form of griefing. You're provoking someone (by destroying their base, normally attacking lower LVL people) into a situation where they believe they will be fighting 1 on 1 and when it begins a team attacks from sneak. 
---
These people either
---
 A. Don't want to fight alone because they aren't sure they will always win
---
Or, more commonly
---
B. Know people won't engage willingly in a 1 vs 4 because they will never win because it's an unfair fight. So they need to deceptively lure into an unfair situation.
---
Try to cover it in whatever word you want, at the end of the day, people who use these techniques are not playing fair. Just because the game allows it, doesn't make it right. Like how there are flaws that allow duplication, PvP is seriously flawed and it allows people to take advantage of others (PvP should work as who ever you shoot at and return fire, you fight, or you can toggle squad PvP if you're a lone player)
---
Am I saying it makes sense in a video game about a post apocalyptic wasteland, yes it makes sense for people to use tactics like this, to destroy houses etc. But this is not ARK, the intention of online play with others was not meant to be like this and people play this game because it is not ARK. There are deterrents put in place, but like everything, people just figure out ways around (like killing each to rid bounties)
---
This is why we can't have nice things.
---
Eh, just add a long delay between switching, like an hour or two. 
---
You can maybe switch the first time, but after that your stuck in passive for an hour.
---
I know alot of people who duped and never got banned. I have no doubt bethesda fucked up whatever banning process they have
---
TIL!!! Awesome! Going back to get that tonight! Thank you for the heads-up!
---
Honestly I would prefer a static reset, that would mean I wouldnt have to login everyday but still be able to max my cap/daily potential.
---
It also would help with Alts and not having to play them daily.
---
I dislike the fact that if you play later one day or do your run later it screws up your next day, with the 20 hr reset.
---
Until they have localized servers, maybe they thought this was the best option? As everyone gets screwed a little vs some getting a tiny advantage of being able to do 2 days worth of work in one play session, and everyone else does 2 if they want too.
---
I explained myself a little better on the advantage in another comment of this thread. Hopefully we got localized permanent servers in the future, and static resets. But first...New content!
---
Sorry for the noob question, but how do you initiate a contest for workshop now that you don’t have to go to the workbench? Is there an option that pops up as soon as you enter the area? 
---
I'll try haha, I'll try..
---
I'll agree but I'll day balance cant be perfect or even close with the variation of perks and other damage defense modifiers. Maybe if guns only had 5% increase from lvl 5 to 50 and thi gs were only marginally better but I hope not as the perk mechanics are a huge part of play style and setup
---
Oh what happened when we asked for a bigger stash, they did it. What happened when people wanted push talk, they did it. You honestly can't just say all they do is lie. They are trying to improve this game and if you dont like this game no need to Express that.
---
I am not innocent.
---
I found a legendary level 1 chicken. I killed it with a hammer. 
---
I am so sorry.
---
Yea, I hope bethesda brings their A-game this next patch. 
---
And lose my lone wanderer perk? Nah. 
---
Actually its human nature and my right as a human to express how I feel. That is what being free is all about
---
I really hope they can at least make the game bearable again, then i might even return to it
---
You can find them by walking in the doors on the same side as the small farm field in the Morgan Town airport, the are right next to the armorer's bench. It's normally some light metal plan.
---
But what I'm trying to say you dont need to do it here go to a fallout haters subreddit or something.
---
I figured that would be the case. I feel like pve people will stick to normal servers and pvp players will go to the pvp servers. You're always going to have assholes in online games griefing will never go away, but it will be reduced in theory.
---
Youre right  looks like I'm not alone though

Low levels can get into whitesprings if they remotely want to. Won't take too much to get to Watoga either.
---
its unbearable?

I noticed my AP drains faster too. Also noticed either all enemies got a small buff or something.

---
this is a 'mod' at one of the vendors
---
Hell no. Camp size is way too small. 
---
It is, but idk if it's just my luck today, but instead of 30% of the time, it honestly feels like 10%. Earlier, I created 30 portions of 5.56 ammo, only like 5 of them were duped. I made 50 portions of Radaway Diluted, only 10 were duped.
---
I would be happy if they removed the cap and just had vendors start with 200 caps.  They can even leave the 20% restock rate or whatever it is.
---
Then if you buy a 5000 cap item they get something like 1000 back into inventory instead of capped at 200.
---
I hate buying expensive stuff and only 200 coming back to their inventory because of the cap.
---
I think he still have it rarely in his inventory for sale, the starburst clock also rare
---
Then prepare to fight if you come up on someones workshop where you have 3 options:
---
1) Claim the workshop through PvP
---
2) Steal from the material farms
---
3) Do nothing
---
If you come to a workshop to do option 3, why even go to the workshop at all?
---
Good job..i love summersville
---
YES YES YES, WAS GONNA ADD THAT BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS CAUSE MY ADRENAL REACTION WAS MIA!!
---
In my eyes yes. I gave up because i was lacking any kind of objective in the game. Then you got all the bugs theyre fixing just to bring em back in the next patch. Plus it crashed so many times on me that i just got frustrated
---
I've heard from other posts that all you have to do is hold down the change camera button (the one to switch you from 1st to 3rd person cameras), like you'd do in your own camp to open the build mode, and that supposedly tosses you into pvp, and you're contesting it. I haven't tried this myself, but I've heard it multiple times now
---
If you the button the transitions you to build mode (V on PC) it’ll allow you to contest if you’re within the build boundaries of the workshop.
---
Yes. Factions are responders, raiders, WS, BOS, special(Watoga ST and Grahm), Harpers Ferry and Enclaive.
---
The really rare roaming bot should be Responder, but I've heard buying from it, won't display those caps in stationary Responder vendors.
---
Agree on the workshop. Makes no sense at all why the PvP should take place outside of that workshop area. They take your workshop, you CHOOSE to engage in PvP to keep it.
---
to an extent yea. For $60 its unbearable. At $30 its bearable. 
---
It’s my experience that once you’re contesting the shop you don’t get bounty for destroying things, although that might just apply to turrets and traps.
---
I don’t have adrenal reaction so there is definitely an issue.  I used to take bloated glowing ghouls 2 hits to kill, now I hit twice and there is a sliver of health left, requiring a third hit.  
---
Are you going to be on tonight? I’m hoping to be on by 8 PM EST.  
---
I don’t have adrenal reaction so there is definitely an issue.  As an example: I used to take bloated glowing ghouls 2 hits to kill, now I hit twice and there is a sliver of health left, requiring a third hit.   
---
Half of em will go the the new mode for awhile, maybe we can take their guns and armor and set em back a bit lol
---
It’s a dangerous wasteland out there. 
---
&gt;Anyone who’s knee-jerk reaction to the “I got wrongfully banned” posts was immediate anger towards Bethesda, you need to grow up and learn that people will lie to get others on their side.
---
You're right! We should listen to Bethesda, they've never [lied!](https://youtu.be/E2YHQEZc100)
---
Good for you, nice to see people producing useful materials like this.
---
nope, it's about you reading EULA that tells you specifically that your entire argument is wrong. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What you think you're buying isnt, and has never been, what you're actually paying for. It wont be changing, so get another hobby or live with the risk of possibly losing access every once in a while because you cant follow the rules. 
---
If the youtubers only reference things they read on reddit, shouldn't all the members of this sub be entitled to a cut of said youtubers earnings? 
---
They are cashing in on it.  I see that as more of a problem than anything. 
---
Or has this been brought up before? 
---
It would further upset the balance ppl already pitch a fit about. I think this would put top end variables out of proportion
---
My friend got 1 shotted last night from some dude in a melee build.
---
Yeah, I used to 1 hit charred ghouls easy with my TSE lever action. Now there's 25% health left after a perfect point blank to the fockin face
---
Xbone? And yes, everything is severely overpriced
---
Oh so other people have seen these odd, dog-tipped long tongue monsters pivoting around a fixed point on the graound?
---
But this is what the workshops around the map are for. I love getting together with a few people  and claiming workshops and then building funny things or grand big things. Personally I love making sky mazes high up with floor tiles missing and jumping puzzles and such. It’s hilarious to use Brahmin as an obstacle people have to get around! 
---
Wdym overpriced? Can you buy them?
---
Lmao, don't know if this was supposed to be a joke but that honest set up and then that picture with the terrifying clown from IT standing behind the counter looking lonely was perfect!
---
It’s dangerous to go alone.
---
I can trade any hat or uniform except the Blue uniform for these I dont have: Forrest-Pink-Red-Yellow Uniforms; PC
---
Workshops would be an issue tho, so no PvP can't apply to those. Other than that, when PvP servers come out, adventure mode should be PvE only.
---
Hmm I think you got mainly downvoted for the Grahm mistake, but I agree, with the 25k limit it would make trading with caps quite difficult if all bloody vendors would have their own limit. 
---
Want to buy some medicore two star gun, that'll be 25k caps please.
---
And we really don't need to increase everything.
---
Not to mention how retarted it gets if you need to have lot of caps. Which a much increase supply would necessitate if you want to trade with them. Fast travelling from vendor to vendor. It's kinda silly already. So we don't need to make it worse.
---
To help defend for the event rewards. 
---
2 shot can't be anti armor. Well it can be modded but it's a much lower amount
---
A few points.
---
This might work better as one poem instead of 6 haiku.  A haiku is meant to be a brief self contained poem, the joint subject makes it better for poems.  
---
second, the 5-7-5 thing is not what makes it a haiku, in fact real haiku only seeming rule is three lines.  
---
You can't have punctuation in the middle of a haiku line.
---
Enough of Peter_G's poetry corner, I do like what you've done and hope to see more poetry about FO76.  Something weird in seeing this place being generally so positive for a change.
---
Don't know of I am the only one or even if it is the patch, but I bulked a bunch of items and made some ammo with the chance for double perk on. When I checked all the bulked items were gone and no new ammo was made. All the materials were gone too. 
---
Only sleeping Id ever buy on sale would be Nuka Girl
---
Then you should be on their team no?
---
Anyways, even so it enables PvP it is not forced. So if you call out friendly then they have a choice.
---
I love heavies, especially due to the variety of weapons you can use (and due to their weight with strong back, you can carry 8 of them for 1 rifle...).
---
Doing that is always fun, gotta show the new players the community isn't as crazy as most youtubers want you to think lol
---
If I could give this multiple upvotes, I would!
---
&gt;Or, you can test it *since you're so sure*
---
Pretty sure the words I used are things like "speculating" and "we don't know." You were the one making the 100% confident assertions.
---
The staggers in this game annoy me, and with the speed at which Yoa Guai move it end up being seriously annoyed.
---
But still, they don't give me trouble, because I always carry a metric shitload of stimpacks and related healing items.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

---
I think I logged on for 30 min on launch day to admire my full inventory from beta left but haven’t opened game since. Wasn’t enough room for 100k ammo, so I’m safe. Unless the max stash increases changed that.  Uh oh!
---
Ah, but no email. 
---
Ahh my mistake. Imagine how long it would take to visit every single vendor anyway... nah sod that.
---
Sorry to hear that.
---
Remove and replace adrenaline reaction to fix it (they change the damage table which is why I think it broke)
---
i have been looking for that mod, haven't found it yet
---
Already mentioned.  If you are in Pacifist mode, that selection is negated when taking over a workshop.   It's a choice to take the risk.
---
At this stage there isn't much I wouldn't do for the BOS Combat Armor plans. 
---
If you have them HMU. 
---
I'm guessing they have been removed from vendor lists for when they release faction based PvP. 
---
FOCD76
---
When they announced 76. The first thing that came to my mind was the building. Second being co-op. Third being pvp, in a faction based system.  I couldn't agree more about needing more freedom to build. It would be awesome if they could figure out to build closer to friends.
---
It's dangerous to go in groups.. 
---
The only problem with this would be server stability and Frame rate maybe but I totally agree with 59% more.
---
Nah I'll do it here
---
That body has been there since launch and you're right next to Vault 94...
---
Say what? -logs in and tries it a bunch of times-
---
Huh.... you're right. I guess I shouldn't believe everything I read in tool tips...
---
Do you feel cool now
---
Net 150 per vendor? Seems very off, seeing as watoga has 2 so doesn’t require fast travelling between them, whitesprings doesn’t require fast travelling either so unsure how you’re spending so much travelling.
---
Really cool and creative build. Hope you dont get banned for stacking foundations cause obviously we arent supposed to glitch the foundations on top of each other. And according to Bethesda terms of service we are supposed to play the way they intended for us to play and not how the game allows us to play. lol.
---
Personally I hate trading and just drop everything to my alt character. 
---
While I agree with you here, we have seen it happen a few times now that many game designers end up adding some of the most popular mods to their games. While it is more common for say WoW, it has been done a few times by BGS. So, if there is a big enough push by ALL communities, then there is a good chance that BGS will listen.
---
Just remember, when posting for changes, it is best to do so calmly and with as little personal bias, attacks, or dumb comments like "everyone wants this". Those statements only lead Devs to ignore the posts and move on. Where as if you post that you and your friends (which is reasonable to comment about) all agree that this mod and others like Better Inventories are features that you want to see. Those kinds of posts, when well written and calmly stated are taken much more seriously.
---
No. I'm not going to gimp myself just to be allowed to help defend a workshop. I agree that how it is now favors attackers way too much, I just don't think making PvP at workshops automatic. Then again, I'm the kind of person who wants an option to abandon a workshop if someone contests it rather than being forced to PvP.
---
You put up turrets. Seriously, they take a huge part of your budget.
---
Thank you for the nice work 👍🏻👍🏻 Looks like the mods for headlights don’t really exist, I was looking for a blue headlight or its schematics for my t51b, finally found the mod at Harper’s Ferry yesterday. 
---
Agreed, I thought at 1st they nerfed it like everything else in this game. But the cards still say 30%, I think it's bugged to be lower.
---
Yes
---
wow this is amazing..i just printed it..you a real one..thank u
---
But if you’re a raider n you’re essentially going to kill another wastelander to steal their junk n caps then you should be earning a bounty. This is literally what makes you a legitimate outlaw. Their is a bounty on your life for taking another’s life. 
---
Lol it's a old meme, east Indian males would (still do) inbox females asking to "send Bob and vagine" (send boob and vagina photos) but because they suck at the English language it's that
---
How do you know its pilot error? Maybe an engine failed or a control line snapped? Determining pilot error is not as simple as you claim.
---
Ive done a ton of armor scrapping and Im fairly sure any arm leg or torso can all unlock mods for arms legs or torsos. so basically craft and scrap arms since their cheapest
---
its jus dangerous

YEAH!

I usually run around in the vampire costume, with  the top hat and dark glasses... Carrying the dragon. Oh. And I have the cannibal mutation. A lot of newbies run before I get to give them stuff 
---
:(
---
than add an extra option for it, exterior or interior. should not be so hard, but hey... gl with getting usefull patches
---
Where are the Stone Benches and Radiation Emitter?
---
So no vendor sells Super Sledge plans?
---
That's annoying, I've spent hundreds of caps travelling around trying to get it.
---
Does anyone know of a quest that rewards the plan? 
---
But the workshops are intended to be battlefields for pvp. The patch notes even clearly states that bethesda wants players to engage pvp through them, hence they made this change.
---
However, the change isn't fair to those who actually claim it, which means it is always a one sided fight in the hands of the claimer in most case scenarios.
---
Enclave has a couple
---
but dont hold.junk cos your.gonna die a lot
---
yeah i have them, no clue where from
---
[Here's a good meme about this post](http://prntscr.com/mof5mc)
---
I think it depends on precisely where you set the camp. So, I built one for awhile right at the entrance to Morgantown on the raised tracks next to the parking garage stairs. Sometimes I'd glitch into the ground, but I didn't end up in the air. Now I'm on the bridge fork behind the spawn point at harpers ferry with my camp on the rock wall. I have one place where I fall a little on the wall, but I built a set of stairs down to that spot and I land next to that. I'm going to move to a place on the high monorail line down south and I'm going to have to be careful where along the wall I place it I think. 
---
If that's supposed to be bait or something then i cant fathom how you thought it would work.
---
If your just autistic and incapable of reading then I apologize tho
---
There is a lot to complain about with this game, HOWEVER there is a lot to this game that is incredible.  Coming from someone who played the shit out of Skyrim, but never played a fallout game until 76, I'm a huge fan, the questing and the exploration is an itch that hasn't been scratched like this for me since my first few playtrhroughs of skyrim (after the 7th or 8th time its no longer adventuring lol)  and Bethesda has a way of making adventuring and exploration in a way that no other developer can in my opinion, not even the Witcher III scratched that itch.  This point does have a point though, complain about the valid complaints, not about the made up ones.
---
class freak lvl 3 is a must imo with a lot of the mutations
---
Did you compensate for the fact that plans are not always constant at each vendor?
---
I've been working on a similar project. Guess I can scrap it. Thanks for the good work.
---
&gt;If you're going to claim "reading comprehension" you should start by not fabricating arguments that your opponent has never made.  So, Mr. Reading Comprehension, go right ahead and quote the line where I claimed to be an "expert." Also, while you're there, quote the line where I claimed I "understand all of human behaviour or have a complete understanding of why people do things".
---
Still haven't provided proof.   
---
Now you're resorting to autism comments?  That's surely going to win your argument.   
---
What a fucking hero you are, making fun of people with autism. 
---
Makes sense, thanks
---
Yea I’m eventually going to do both. Now just trying to figure out which one I’m going to spec into first. With the enforcer perk, is it possible to take down a SB with a shotgun?
---
I see CAMP stuff I want to get from the Atom Shop then I realize I'd have no budget to add it so I move along.  Sad.  
---
I've heard rumors that CAMP budget use becomes more efficient with levels but haven't seen anything from BGS to confirm it.  If true, I could probably do well to rebuild since I settled my CAMP location maybe 80 levels ago but it took ages for me to get things just how I like and we all know how stored blueprints can be wonky for anything with a footprint more than one foundation.  
---
It would also be nice if we could repair things before they are completely destroyed.  I have a lot of wiring and finicky placement of things in my CAMP so deleting/replacing every little bit is a tiresome chore.
---
I got one of them a few nights ago in white spring. 
---
Who should I sell my known plans to?
---
That’s solid advice!
---
So when he attacked your friend and you are on your friend’s team, you can attack him freely, is that how it works? 
---
I kinda think they just need a separate "build" budget and "defense" budget.  
---
If you build 0 defense you can build a pretty large camp.    
---
I get the idea behind making defense objects take up more budget.  Without that people could make a giant wall of 50 rocket turrets and use that in ways the devs never intended.  
---
Yes hit me up gofukyurslf326 psn
---
I know you think you got me, but you missed some pretty pertinent things.
---
Like my entire stance.  Your butt hurt is so immense it's causing you reading problems and making you salty.  Maybe take a break, homey.

The way it should work is this:
---
* When someone contests a workshop, the owner receives a notification with two options: Defend, or Yield.  
---
* The notification closes automatically after 30 seconds and defaults to Defend.  
---
* While the notification is open, both players are neutral toward each other.  
---
* If the owner chooses Defend, *it is on.*  
---
* If the owner chooses Yield, the challenger gets the workshop and no one gets hurt.
---
My houses are so much nicer by giving up turrets. Just consider location and position to reduce mib attacks.
---
We have been playing side by side since Fallout 4. Then we were only about to share cool locations. Now with 76, we always play together.  
---
But we keep our camps separate to better utilize the free fast travel between the Vault &amp; our camps.  It can help reduce cap spending if used properly. 
---
Thanks Peter!  Honestly, it’s more in the tradition of Renku, though its solitary source is more reflective of the abandoned tradition of single-player RPG’s.  I had hoped that people would catch on and add their own, bringing a little light to this Heart of Darkness.  But alas, the Responders are all dead.  
---
Even Miguel.  
---
Alas!  
---
Poor Miguel!
---
I barely knew him.
---
In fact I didn’t know him.
---
DM me if you see his holotape
---
Isn't the mod worth like 12% ignore or is that the rifle perk?
---
I do confirm how unfair the new system is for workshops owners :3
---
Well Jim is one of the most abrasive and annoying personalities to grace the internet. So make of that what you will. It's funny he complains about TripleAAAyyyy scuzzy business practices (rightfully so) but then stoops to super scuzzy "Journalism" practices like not bothering with any research whatsoever, not fact-checking so he can rush his "stories" out the door for those sweet, sweet capitalism clicks. Plus presenting everything as a black-and-white "this is how it is" sort of way, never entertaining the idea that there may be an ounce of nuance to what he's "reporting". 
---
That dude can go step on a lego.  
---
Fair enough, i like it. Fair grounds on both ends.
---
I had to defend a workshop yesterday against about 30-40 Mirelurks. Seemed like they just kept on coming. 
---
The regular ones weren't too bad but those Stranglers were a handful! 
---
It's done for PVP the resources are not needed
---
That sounds like good times knee capping ghouls. I should be good on ammo for a little while. I have about 6000 shit gun shells and about 7000 5mm. Been picking up ammo since I started the game. 
---
 Not a bad idea. Someone should make one
---
I don't give a damn what you think of this incident. I'm just giving you the proof of him cheating since you wanted one. Proof is given and now it's left for you and me to decide. Hope that clears something up. It's a matter of intelligence at this point. Everything cries out cheater and if you need even more proof before you come up with any conclusion, I can't imagine how much time it takes for you to make any simplest decisions in actual life. 
---
What about the whitesprings armory?  I didn't see any plans (I think there's only a few, like gatling plasma, gatling laser and something else).
---
So sad to not see any X-01 plans :-(.
---
I don't think a Handmade doing, say, another 30 points of damage per shot would be any worse than an already existing Anti-Armor explosive Handmade...
---
Im seeing bottlecaps disapearing when I buy stuff from vendors. Just last time I brought one fairly nice 3 star armor I've been trying to find from players which increases sneak, and another weaker one with same legendary effect. I might end up ditching the weaker one but I just wanted to go and try them together.
---
Of course if people are all so full of god tier drops they have nothing to buy anymore, then hmm, maybe there's something wrong with the game as they have already anything they could want in just few months. Or maybe they are playing it wrong.
---
Well you don't actually have to USE the sleeping bag. If I was to buy it, it would be for decoration
---
This is still a bug in the game. In fact, it seems to come back, and happen more often, after each patch. Furthermore, I believe I am actually still hidden (enemies can't see me), but since it constantly displays [DANGER] I don't get the sneak bonus, which defeats the whole purpose of a sneak character! I've had enemies walk right past me while it says danger and never notice me. I waste so much more ammo during these times. 
---
it's super common and happens pretty much all the time with all enemies when using sneak attacks.  
---
That said I mostly notice this when other players are nearby or I'm in a group, oddly it seems to largely work fine when I'm solo.  Patch before last made it very common.    
---
Used to be very common at launch then they largely fixed it, and then 2 patches back they re-introduced it so we are back at square 1.
---
Do you remember if he sells the shadowed combat armour chest plans - and more importantly, the blue tv.
---
I do that from time to time.  I’ll pop down to flat woods,  crank out a bunk of low level armor and weapons then hand them out.
---
I am also this type of person.
---
I cannot STAND PvP but I just mean for all those workshop boys out there, gotta keep it fair yeno?
---
Bethesda chooses to nerf things, rather buff others, which makes only specific builds and weapons/armor viable.
---
And duping flooded the market with these items, so people don't care about most stuff unless it's 2-3* anti-armor, bloodied, instigating, explosive, swing speed, unyielding, sentinel, cavalier, assassin.
---
Shotgunner + Enforcer is pretty fun.
---
It's like you are actually demanding that 900 hours guy to make a youtube video admitting that he cheated and actually logging in his reddit account to prove that he's the guy and even that wouldn't be enough proof
---
Haven't seen metal dense plans anywhere. Does anyone have it that are willing to sell it or possibly trade. I give generously. PM me plz I'll buy mods too. Ps4
---
This is what I have thought forever! It is annoying to have to fast travel to 7 different vendors at the end of my day just to sell. 
---
Exactly! I love going in stealth, avoiding the owner's sight and then initiating a sweaty fight.
---
Now, you could just put your toe at the edge, initiate and vats crit the poor dude. 
---
No fun in a one sided fight. I say this as I found no joy what so ever raiding today. It felt very cheesy to the point i no longer found interest in it.
---
You know, I'm not positive. I'm not into pvp at all. It could have been that once he shot her and she shot back, I shot him and he shot *me* back. 
---
*Wooo* It's your **4th Cakeday** Lipstick_! ^(hug)
---
Serious question cos I don't get it.  Why would anyone want the plans for standard armour when you can acquire legendaries with multiple effects?
---
I’ve been seeing it a lot less lately as well. I’m not exactly a low level, at least in my mind (lv 142), but I don’t see too much of THAT anymore. What I AM seeing is some punkass 50-70 players still running around with the silenced explosive lever actions and shotguns gunning ME down, even in PA that’s maxed out. My build is an even balance between offense and defense. They are able to peg me like 3 times and I’m dead. This kind of shit is getting old. 
---
Sometimes they are, but not this time so stop white knighting this guy. He’s cheated you and everyone else that plays this struggling game by fucking up the economy and giving devs more shit to fix. And now on top of all of that he’s whining about it.
---
Amen! I'm a North Carolinian, and I'm definately going to visit the moth man bridge. 🙂
---
From people on the marketplace, they are usually selling about 1.5k up to like 10k+ for the rarer colours
---
That's so cool! how did you get the walls to sit diagonally?
---
A fixed reset time would solve this problem all of us have with the current system and be easy to implement. 
---
But thats not my issue im trying to sell stuff to venders stuff ive made!
---
Some players experience technical issues with trading while (heavily) overburdened.   If that’s your case, i would recommend against opening a support ticket to Bethesda.
---
Rarer colours? I thought the nurses uniforms only come in white
---
You're better off just checking the asylum and hope you're lucky. Or atleast be content with a dirty 1
---
Ok
---
This is magical :)
---
Thanks for bringing this up, it does need to be addressed.
---
Fantastic. New way to grief if true
---
I max my C.A.M.P. budget every single time and I'm not even using turrets. Would love a C.A.M.P. budget boost. Would also love if the blueprint feature could actually match the budget of the C.A.M.P. so we can save different copies of structures.
---
Im not ime actually lower then my overcumbered and i guess i shall! 
---
They would spam the sonic attacks essentially blinding you, therefore really hard to shoot at. That being said they get easier to kill mid level.  
---
All I can think of is Fortnite when I read this lol
---
Yeah peeps would build them at work shops and block them so the couldnt get to the workshop station to claim them.
---
It was like that since beta
---
I don't play pvp but I'm psyched for survival just for the added tension and fun
---
Too easy to contest. Today, I went raiding for an hour, taking one workshop after the other, although I lost interest, as there were no tense fights, because the complete upper hand is on the attacker's side. 
---
It completely lost it's edge.
---
No the asylum uniforms/nurses outfits come in weathered (dirty white), white (clean), blue, green, red, yellow, brown, pink, forest and there's corresponding hats for all of them
---
I'm not even commment on your past. Im commenting on your essays you are writing about this topic. Are you the guy that got banned? That's the only way your past is relevant here. 
---
*golf clap
---
They were nerfed. Also, depending on your perks they may not do any damage to you. They do zero or almost zero damage to me without power armor. Besides being a bullet sponge they can be pretty harmless. 
---
I think most people found them more annoying than anything else. Now that the sonic blasts are nerfed they are one of the easier mobs
---
Welcome! You should watch the Mothman Prophecies before your trip if you haven’t already seen it. I know it was just an alright movie in general, but should add another layer of interest for your Mothman adventure. Also I believe the Mothman festival takes place the third week of September if you are looking for a good time to go. The drive through the state should be nice around that time too.
---
I hope you have a great time!
---
&gt;Assholes, revenue.
---
You hit the nail on the head. Trashing a AAA title gives you views and ad revenue. It doesn't help that the game really does have problems, but not nearly as bad as they say. 
---
Given infinite time and money I'd love to be a youtuber myself and callout stupid bullshit like this, citing clips from their channels and everything. Really fight fire with fire, and call them out for the money grubbing opportunists they really are.
---
Also not mentioned here... look at whats happening with geopolitics. Countries are paying bloggers and Facebook advertisers  to shill for their cause, like in the 2016 US election. I think rival game developers and companies are looking at what Russia did to the US and saying "this is fucking brilliant". 
---
**Tinfoil hat time! I honestly believe companies like Rockstar and Ubisoft pay people to give negative reviews about rival games on youtube**. It's not illegal, not hard, and honestly makes the most sense to keep your shareholders happy.
---
Don't trust reviews. Think critically, make your own opinions.
---
Wow, I never knew that. I just wear my red hat on my dirty uniform

---
Based on data-mined information.
---
Sure! 
---
...you really should look me up. 
---
Ohhhh, interesting. What kind of stuff? Maybe they patched certain items to be unable to sell to vendors
---
Did the prices skyrocket when they made them available at all times? I thought at LEAST the serums were cheaper, holy shit.
---
The SBQ does not give nearly good enough rewards for the effort and resources needed to kill it.
---
That's the biggest reason most of us have stopped "dropping what we're doing" to go kill the queen. She's a queen that drops loot like a pauper! 
---
it is!
---
Oh god, imagine if you shot someone in this game and they turned into a tower.
---
Hell, people might like it better.
---
trying to act like no one is ever banned by mistake is ignorance
---
You want either Sentinel/assassin armor or Cavalier/assassin. The former is 15% (per piece) reduced damage while standing still and the latter is the same except while sprinting. Slap a dense mod on your cheat piece, and use fireproof. On top of those you want; Dodgy, lone wanderer, and blocker. People recommend serendipity on this type of build, but I have never needed it.
---
It’s part of the song...  it’s a song called bitch lasagna by PewDiePie.  You should subscribe to him.
---
Maybe your right, my reg handmade does 81 per shot, my tse does 105. So it's not really that much better but I am curious as well
---
We ran into one last night in the woods near sugar grove.
---
It’s just dangerous out there, so stock up here. 
---
Yeah, some of them have a very high value to collectors
---
I am a Raider. And I like caps and PvP. That’s why. 
---
Maybe add both options? If you own a workshop and someone comes in you get message at the bottom saying "Someone has entered your workshop. Hold X to initiate proactive defense." Then at the same time, if someone goes to your workshop and contests it you get a message saying "Someone is contesting your workshop. Hold X to surrender it; 5 seconds until you are put into PvP mode to defend."
---
If you do nothing, you enter PvP mode. Pacifist is disabled and all participants take full damage. It can't be turned off until you win or lose the contest. If you hold X to surrender, you immediately lose the workshop and don't get the event to retake it. 
---
It's probably a technical issue due to engine/console limitations.
---
Well that I did not know thanks ill look into it
---
Hunting rifle pistols anything i can easily make simply. 
---
Damn. I need to find me some of those. I’ve been trying to convince my friend to wear one so we can match, but now she calls me nurse lol
---
What system are you on?
---
He is noob
---
Oh, and I was just about to close his patreon when I noticed the descriptions for backers. This one in particular was interesting in regards to language use:
---
 "You're Cipher"
---
$200 or more per month ∙ 1 of 5 patrons 
---
* You must be pretty powerful, resourceful, and enigmatic to consider such an incredible level of support! **You are Cipher**.  This tier is reserved for those who want to go above and beyond in *helping YongYea unify community and steer it into the right course of  history*. 
---
That italicized part makes me want to facepalm, chuckle, and die at the same time!
---
That’s great! I saw u didn’t have much stuff inside like you said if you’re on Xbox I have lots of furniture if you want 
---
Tool tip specifically says "on the ground". Foundations and floors aren't ground. Same for sleeping bags you find in the world.  If it's on a "floor" they are safe.
---
Hell I'd be there instead of here
---
Unless you have a set of Sentinel assassin armor. Which I do.
---
Partially correct. Any sleeping bag on the ground (dirt, rocks etc) will give you a disease. However even sleeping bags in the world on a "floor" will be safe.
---
Uh..  Look, I don't really find many youtubers tolerable these  days, especially ones who deliberately try to make a career out of 10-minute videos of them talking to a camera by getting your information almost purely from internet forums with minimal investigation.
---
But this is supposed to be a rebuttal to the video, is it not, or is it 
---
an attack on the person itself?
---
I saw rebuttal, and I thought this would contain arguments countering  the points that he made in the video, such as whether Bethesda did in fact break their promise that the Atomic Shop would remain cosmetic, or if what they did really does technically qualify as being pay-to-win in a substantial matter.   And if it does, did it really matter?
---
That's the kind of rebuttal I  was  expecting, not a tangent on the person's channel and perceived hypocrisy.   The best way  to deconstruct this stuff is to actually refute what they're presenting.
---
I was fighting a scorched beast, it flew off without reason in the direction of my base which isn't super close, it destroyed almost everything 
---
He’s in a war for the number 1 spot on YouTube against a major Indian company and the gap is really close so we could use anyone and everyone we can to help subscribe to him and win the war
---
really? u cant stand still all the time..how does ot work...you try and time.your attack so you attack after you get hit? then stand still then attack?...seems.like a really slow process
---
Followed the advice in this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpzPUmfv960
---
A direct correlation between banned dupers and no asshats? 🤔 lolz
---
In the discussion of the economy and crappy legendary drops etc Detroitdregs mentioned making the context of ‘Legendary’ weapons have meaning in the Fallout paradigm so I thought….yes give them meaning \*and\* let that meaning fuel the new content/game play and trading aspect so many are wanting to improve and grow.
---
Imagine better quality legendary are dropping a little more often but in addition to the ‘everyday’ wear and tear we can all repair at a crafting station via perk card skills and easily found materials they also have a ‘life span’ counting down. 
---
So before the life of the legendary armor or weapon (or food pouch or water filter or animal lure or ammo pouch, etc etc) is over you must decide if you are going to let it die or is it worth some legendary love and care?
---
The only way they can be ‘resurrected’ is by players who have developed the skills to harness the legendary characteristics that come from the mutated environment and creatures. You can search these players out and strike an agreement to have your weapon brought back to life but it will cost you some effort to hunt down and retrieve rare materials, kill dangerous creatures, etc. 
---
You can also go to some player hub, perhaps Artisans Corner in White Springs where you hand over your dying legendary and receive a quest that lists the materials and deeds you must return with so the Artisan can give your legendary item new life. (players who develop the skills to do the work will receive the profits/materials of the assignments they accept)
---
Umm no 
---
&gt; it's more like 200%. there's a huge difference between regular and legendary builds, especially when fighting end-game mobs.
---
You're flat lying out your ass. I never said anything about non legendary builds, but you the vast majority of damage comes from easy to find 1 star weapons. You're either stupid or being neglectful on purpose to twist around what I say.
---
The very best 2nd tier rolls increase damage by 25% at max on ranged weapons and 40% on melee. Even that 25% isn't true, because that's fire rate and it doesn't decrease reload time. If you consider explosive to be the best then that's just 32% increase **after** you spend 5 perk points on demolition. Then you look at the even weaker 3rd tier for another less than 10% increase in damage. Almost none of the 3rd tier are direct damage increases and the ones that are barely do anything. Typically you want something like vats charging or reload speed increase for ranged and the only one for melee is +1 str.
---
I have a god roll weapon, revolutionary sword bloodied/40% swing speed/+1 str. They don't take a thousand hours of farming. You're clearly lying and exaggerating about a lot of shit here. Someone else who hasn't put in the time like I have might fall for it, but not me. Take your bullshit elsewhere.
---
I was in the same boat. Either people here just regurgitated what they’d read or just really suck. I haven’t fought any since the nerf, but before it was pretty easy to take out  2 at a time at level 35.
---
It benefits me too,  gotta burn off excess junk.  Lol
---
The update a couple of days ago nerfed them. I should know, I made the post about them that made Bethesda noticed (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anrm7u/fuck_scorchbeasts_and_whoever_programmed_them/) lol
---
You also have to risk other mutations so it is shitty for alot of people, myself included. The more people who are alright with just removing all mutations and buying or crafting all the serums again are likely going to cause Bethesda to not bother fixing it. That is completely unacceptable and outrageous. 
---
However, so has every other bug, and time to fix those, so I'm not holding my breath.
---
Here comes the ball peen hammer!!!! Signed, the raiders. 
---
Eagle eyes is good too, especially in PvP where perception lets you see where they come from before they see you lol
---
think tank killer is 12% not sure
---
Yeah, I read this expecting a counter point to his video. All I got was an attack on him and the kind of content on his channel.
---
Thanks 😊 I'm pretty proud of it. 
---
I'm getting online in a few mins. I can't fast travel, and at whitespring station. I hope that's not an issue!
---
This is strange, I tested same situation today with a friend, cus I have both -  Electrically Charged  and  Unstable Isotope mutatons and was curious about possibility to force me in to pvp like this. We were not in a group, while he punching me, mutations deal damage to him but not trigger full damage pvp. So, he dealt more dmg to himself than to me with this slaps. Only after I punched him, he start to deal full dmg. And obviously pacifist was off.
---
Because if I bought it and played it I'd be likewise [forbidden from criticizing the game](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqktri/why_i_despise_some_of_the_players_in_fo76/) you tool
---
Really, the saddest defense you can mount - e.g. you haven't played it/played it too much, is what you fanboys pull out first thing. Very sad
---
I never actually said what side I take on this matter because my opinion doesn't matter and yours matters just as much as mine in this scenario. The only things I said are to "Not believe the first thing you read as fact and don't disregard new information just because it differs from what you currently know." and "You don't have to humor people who don't put up their own argument just because they challenge you to fill in their blanks in the story." If he stays banned, great. If he ends up getting unbanned, great, I don't care cause he'll get banned again if he does dupe again. Also you replied to me twice instead of editing the first comment so I think you should take a step back or disconnect yourself from this fiasco entirely. The 900 hours guy, not me. If you wanna take your anger out on me go ahead.
---
Great, now could you do it all again organized by part name, with a field of which vedndor(s) can send it?
---
/s
---
It happens to me all the time in level 150 imagine my daily negative caps 
---
I use the medic mod. I automatically administers stimpaks. This keeps you alive thru most battles. Just have to carry enough stimpaks.
---
Yeah let's just say anyone who dares to belive that Bethesdas autoban system can have false positives is just the product of TOXIC MASCULINITY.
---
You guys are ebola. 
---
How the heck is the floor NOT the ground? 
---
If you find a sleeping bag out in the wild, it doesn't matter if it's sitting on concrete, it's still diseased. (I know.. I've sat on enough of them on accident. &gt;.&gt;)
---
And I'm *fairly* sure I've gotten diseases from sleeping bags on beds. But now this whole things got me thinking and I gotta go find one to test...
---
If you want damage resist at low health you'll want bolstering armour. Gives resist of like 50 per piece when low health. Don't worry bout sentinel it's shit as you have to be standing still to get damage reduction. Better off with bolstering for your build 😝
---
Will it use the diluted stimpaks? I made a bunch of diluted ones since using a whole one was a waste with such low health. 
---
I know you can get those from defending workshops in the forest. Got em on three characters. 
---
This is what I was looking for! Not sure why I haven’t seen any yet, but I figured it had to be in the game as I’ve seen the set that boosts defense with high health. 
---
Same. I use a sneak commando w/handmade. It went away for a while but it's back again. On mbs where a headshot is a one shot it's fine but on tougher mobs it keeps yo-yoing.
---
This is interesting, but doesn't make sense to me. Unless you are saying something like this scenario:
---
Player A shoots Player B, Player B takes slap damage, Player B returns fire but not with a direct hit, causing full explosive damage to Player A, Player A dies in "one shot"
---
If that is the case then that is not what most are complaining about. It would have to be: 
---
Player A shoots Player B but not directly, ignoring slap damage, and causing full explosive damage to Player B, Player B dies in "one shot"
---
I don't believe this is the case because I am 99% positive (can't test it now) that the explosive splash damage is affected by the slap mechanic, until mutual PvP is initiated. If not, I believe I would have killed alot of people through slap damage even accidentally.
---
If you have the Save my Stuff mod it's broken and that's your problem. 
---
What else can you get when you have nothing to do but grind.
---
There's no need to outright refute in a rebuttal. I undermine his arguments by showing that he does the same thing he accuses others of, that he can't be trusted, and that he is effectively prone to the same compromises that incorporated entities are when it comes to generating profile awareness for profit. 
---
So I find it strange that you would describe my pointing out his hypocrisy as a 'tangent', when pointing out hypocrisy by Bethesda is a foundational part of his own video. I think it entirely relevant and useful in that light, and in opposition to his views and points about corporatism... which is within the inherent nature of a rebuttal.
---
So I wouldn't call this an attack video. If you think my last comment about his voice comes off that way I can understand, though you should note that it was meant to satirize him (hence the 'it's just my perspective' part, which mirrors his own self-justification for bashing devs back at him). Maybe that wasn't so obvious but satire isn't always obvious to everyone, hehe.
---
no, i'm not salty at all, you're just basing your argument on a fantasy of entitlement that has never existed. 
---
and i dont need a break, i havent played since the beginning of january
---
What platform?
---
I had a different bug that seemed related to chameleon. It wouldn’t trigger even if I stripped naked, but a random player I ran across a minute later couldn’t see me no matter what I did. We were both on mic and I never became visible even with fast travel, door loading screens, in/out of power armor. 
---
Just wander around, they will find you. https://imgur.com/qdC07tI
---
I would be cautious about using this, you never know when they might decide macros are a bannable offense.  Many MMO disallow using macros.
---
Oh... oh my that might be....
---
newark delaware, well that explains alot...
---
(i live in the same state and that area is a shithole)
---
Where’s the Whitespring chef 
---
how am i even chopping onions inside my brain in front of my computer?
---
Same. Marsupial with sentinel 4 piece and 1 chameleon, sneaky build max agi max per and they almost never find me and if they do just stand up and go full auto.
---
Easy, if I'm battling another player, I take the high ground (so melee has a harder time) and I plant myself with a 360° view. My perception is about as high as it can go, and if I'm shot at, all it does is give them away so I can vats them with my bloodied explosive gauss.
---
And not even his numbers make any real sense to me. Have you ever tried to multi box without scripts? It’s questionable if it even increases your farming speed. He’s trying to say 3 accounts = 3 times the collecting speed which is a joke. 
---
One person cannot collect that much that fast. Btw this is assuming they do nothing but farm ultracite ammo, leaving no room for the other stuff he had.
---
I found these plans in containers/safes. 
---
Marsupial is clutch in mele cus you just get elevated as fuck
---
Emmiter I won from an event in the Bog. 
---
I sleep well enough at night. But, I am certain that you sleep with a smug little smirk on your face, after your big day of belittling people on the internet. We get it, you don't like dupers. Personally, I find the griefing that you are doing to people on here, way more objectionable than any of the duping or griefing that I have personally seen in game. Different people have different hang-ups I guess. To me, "virtue", can be an awful vice.
---
I got attacked by a group of like 6 glowing ones that were glowing purple at a relay tower one day. Turns out a flatwoods monster was controlling them. Took 2 attempts to take them all out and killed the flatwoods monster for good measure. Thing was a bastard to begin with. 
---
nice
---
&gt;I went to claim a workshop and had to clear out the enemies, I took one look at 4 gulpers and they all dropped dead at once.
---
It's fairly common bug, surprised you haven't encountered it before. I see it particularly in Watoga with bots spawning practically dead, no idea why, maybe I hang around there too much.
---
But it can happens to pretty much any enemes. Sucks when they are legendary and you don't manage to touch them before they die.
---
Normal SB battle for me today was also crazy. Easily had three times the number of normal scorched spawn, maybe four times.  Not sure where they were all coming from.
---
You must be a plans collector! Do you have them all? I am missing one. It's the last bench in the chairs section. The first one in the row is the large pew. It's that last varient 8/8 like an old park bench. Have you learned this plan or come across anyone with it in your travels ?
---
It was that or have to u bulk every time u went to craft or repair things. 
---
Just stash your bulk after u make it.
---
I understand the point of your post n leveling the PvP field. However, if you’re a raider I don’t understand why you wouldn’t want the bounty since it’s essentially the point at which you actually become a raider or outlaw. 
---
It bugs me that I haven’t... i have almost all weapons except for those and the Gatling Laser...
---
Didnt notice sorry
---
But the workshops don't last for more than a session.  (And that session can be short if the server/client disconnects).
---
  And the workshops can be stolen.
---
That had not been my experience.
---
No he could not.
---
Yeah, they updated the Patch Notes later that day saying they increased the prices of Plans to account for the increased availability, to 'protect' the crafter player economy.
---
Yup. If they would change the serums so that they would both remove and reapply then it would not be so bad (haven't other mutations bugged out as well?)
---
I absolutely slept in a sleeping bag near Camden Park in a shack yesterday. No disease and no warning that I might catch one.
---
This exactly.  Hunter V Hunted was meant to be the PVP aspect of the game.  Yet I never see it playing out.  I always see 1 or 2 signed on, myself included when I've tried.  People who want PVP but dont use HvH as intended only want the ability to grief those less prepared than themselves.  Entering into HvH is an acknowledgment that all are prepared for it and there is an 75% chance you WILL lose.

watoga phoenix bot has the neon letters
---
Everyone saying this is normal. Is it normal for the SB queen to heal at ~50% health too?  My buddies and I  just set off our first nuke together and the queen  healed. Due to that we were unable to defeat her in the time limit.
---
I dont know if you guys notice but somemof thenplans still appear randomly on vendors, as in, you need to server hope to get those rarer plans
---
Nice try, whole-state-of-west-virginia-using-reddit. I'm not falling for your tourism traps.
---
Proud to say that your TS P was the last gun i used,  took out a griefer straight farming low level dwellers doing collision course. Woke up the next day and boom. Andy Dufrain in shawshank redemption. 
---
god damn it BGS, why do you keep doing shit to make me not want to fire up the game?
---
Grahm sells the metal picnic table for 345
---
No. 
---
It's most definitely going off less than it used to. 
---
I think they may have nerfed Pharma Farma as well. I have it maxed and I'm not getting even half of the extras when I search anymore. 
---
I like them, doesn’t bother me.
---
You forgot about the responder vendor in the Grafton Governement building. Everyone forgets about that good ol' dude.
---
Why not?
---
He ran to social media claiming Bethesda banned him when he was actually duping.
---
&gt;Under common law, to constitute defamation, a claim must generally be false and must have been made to someone other than the person defamed.
---
Seems to fit.
---
That's just extra stars of disappointment when the loot doesn't spawn, lol
---
A thumbs up 
---
I always feel the first 30 levels are a pain.
---
You can buy plans for the gun at grafton or the town to the SW that has all of he mole miners
---
Junk items are always useful maybe consider that but most of the time is higher levels like to do favours for lower levels because (most of the time) someone once did that for us
---
He's been suspended and he's shown an email showing that he'd acquired 400k ultracite ammo. And that's enough to come up with a conclusion. If a new info comes up, say he gets unbanned and bethesda issues an apology, then I will change my mind but seeing from what's given so far, it's never too early to make up some mind. And yes, I am pissed. People been fooled by all these dupers countless times and they keep believing. On the side note, is replying more than once considered abnormal or something? I'm relatively new to reddit and I don't know the rules
---
Ultracite power armor 
---
Oh absolutely, I've had issues with marsupials effect just disappearing and having to relogg, speed demon sometimes doesn't work, and I've been gifted the bird bones effect out of nowhere, without having ever aquired that mutation.
---
I didn't grind at all to get to 100. I was 100 before I even touched the Enclave stuff. 
---
I've been giving people whiskey or the best drink I have on hand just in case they need a lil pick me up, also because I have nothing else but my C.A.M.P.'s amenities to offer high level players
---
\*Looks around for police\* Yeah you can gimme sumthin. \*Ziiiiiiiiip\*

First TSE, then stealth, now bloodied? What's next? Nerf on Anti-armor?
---
T... teach me senpai.
---
Seriously, everytime I even attempt to build something remotely nice, it ends up being a 6x6 garbage disposal plant. Help
---
You have more flexibility the way it is..  for example, if you play 4 hours every day, you can do your vendor loop at the end of your play session on day 1 then do it at the beginning of your play session on day 2. Day three you can do it whenever.
---
Apart from this, it sort of sucks that they have a limit in the first place, but that's a whole different issue.
---
Buy plans, build and scrap. That’s how I learned them 
---
It's never been 100%. Also, are you sure it wasn't a CAMP? I just got one sleeping on the top of the church in flatwood. If that ain't "off the ground" I don't know what is.    I'm still hunting for one on a bed... not having much luck...
---
So am I supposed to ramp up the stairs to park in the garage?
---
I have no idea what you mean, I am just an average West Virginian supporting my state.

You can turn it off when selling then re-enable it to save your stuff. A hassle but protects your favs
---
*wonders if there is going to be additional threads with the 900 hours guy*
---
Suddenly? No. That’s been happening since the patch before the last one
---
Well, if the pattern keeps, a Handmade with no mods does another 5 points of damage per 10 levels, so figure at Level 95, it gains 25 points if damage over a Level 50?
---
Reminds me of direwolf20. Gonna build something nice this play thru......aaaaaaand it's a 9x9
---
Oh my grammar is total garbage most of the time tbh 😄 I just hate accusations.
---
thats a good point..the loading into the resort and appalachia is unbearable sometimes lol
---
You can sue people for anything if you have the money. But I doubt bethesda will ever do that. Really bad PR move. I mean, the guy played fallout 76 for 900 hours. Show some mercy
---
So what you're saying is that Bethesda needs to delete all ultracite PA plans and then make it so they only spawn from the SBQ, right?
---
...sonofabitch I SEE WHAT YOU ARE
---
I'm not exactly a high level player but when I finish my daily runs I try to find a low level or near Player so I can drop stuff for them to look through. Usually excess ammo, food, water, mats. Knowing/hoping I'm helping someone is all the thanks I need
---
All good. Any word on when the next update is coming out?
---
Wanna move your camp for free? Put down a foundation and then pick up your camp machine and set it on top. Then pick up the foundation (your camp machine will go with it) and place the foundation underwater. The game won't be able to place your camp the next time you log in and you will get the option to move for free!
---
I always feel odd when I find a camp and have a look around and the owner comes running over looking like a Skyrim shopkeeper. 
---
&gt;NotAnAd
---
Relax guys he legit see even says it's not an ad
---
I once went to the Flooded Trainyard in the Cranberry Bog
---
It was swarming with Glowing Mirelurk Kings so I server-hopped because fuck Mirelurk Kings
---
I get back there and it's instead swarming with Yao Guais 
---
Somehow, the Yao Guais were much much easier to deal with than the Mirelurk Kings. I'm running a pure Heavy build btw (so I'm not exactly dealing high damage here).
---
*Country Roads Intensifies*
---
No haven't seen anything myself hopefully soon. Personally just waiting on my next reply from support.
---
I ran into a 150+ guy in power armor keeping everyone away from the Whitesprings golf club. His two level 20 friends were on a roof killing zombies through a window. When the ghouls started targeting me, he jumped off his base and started attacking me.
---
As far as I can tell it only uses standard stimpaks. I will carry diluted or Nuka in a fav slot. Trying to use one of those before the armor medic pump kicks in . When I go to a Nuke zone I put Super stimpaks in the fav slot.
---
(Looks at the free Looking Into The Future photomode pose)
---
Ummm...
---
I tried the roof thing, it was working really well until I got to the rock parts of the base and then I couldn't place them but I came up with something else: [https://imgur.com/a/ZkMXRmQ](https://imgur.com/a/ZkMXRmQ)
---
Really they added push to talk? I’ve been out of the loop for awhile wonder what else has changed 
---
See, this guy gets it. If you read that I said it’s not an ad online, it has to be true. These are the rules
---
" I can drag the workshop owner into pvp anytime I would like. While the workshop owner can't do the same to me"
---
Which is essentially like having a bounty anyway.
---
Yea sorry my dude. Just gotta be careful to dump youre bulk in that stash before you go out. 
---
steel, acknowledgement, steel, your appreciation, steel, and gunpowder imo
---
This and pay it forward when YOU can. 
---
The under armor mod plans are cumulative. After you buy the treated, the resistant goes on sale. Until it gets to shielded. I don’t know the exact order. I tried this with the enclave under armor and the raider under armor. 
---
I would fight the SBQ with my bare nipples for a perk card that allowed us to make a second C.A.M.P.
---
I ran into one coming out of Charleston Train Station. I punched him and he flew off.
---
The bounty mechanics are poorly implemented. Just like the workshops right now, the player with a bounty is at the same disadvantage.
---
However, it does make more sense that you become wanted if you chose to attack the workshop without claiming the work shop, this would eliminate exploiting the workshop owner by claiming, killing, then leaving the workshop zone, so the work shop gets it back and the attacker could repeat the process.
---
God forbid you spend time on a bethesda game. 
---
Those fence guys are pretty irritating.
---
I have the mothman sleeping bag in my CAMP because I wanted it to feel more like a cabin...
---
The other night I got a 500 cap bounty (wrecking a turret camp behind the clubhouse) and just waited at white springs for the action to come to me.
---
The caps I don't need anymore anyway and I think I made a profit by the end of the night.  But eventually I'll have to lose the bounty...
---
Exactly, and the point of the bounty is supposed to be a punishment.
---
They literally applied the same circumstances to the workshop owner lol. 
---
[player 2(3) has entered the game]
---
anyone around you when that happened?
---
The forest is my happy place.
---
Their rules state banned 7 days on SECOND OFFENSE!!!! BUT they ban me forever on first????? 
---
If you were in a mutant horde event they respawn until you kill that legendary. Or if another player came into the zone and triggered another wave. I have had someone run thru and spawn the whole town I just cleared.
---
Msn that I'd a ROUGH Driveway
---
I wouldnt mind if they would at least shoot at mobs, but half the time they dont even do that. Mirelurk Queens have A LOT of health, itd be nice to not have to deal with that by myself 4 times a fight. 
---
You got any more of them....  #SCREWS?
---
&lt;insert Dave Chappell meme&gt;
---
A useful tip if you dont already know, if you have a empty chassis you can equip higher level peices on it through the power armour workbenches and then just wait for the 60 secs for it to recall to your inventory then store it in the stash box. It's a good way to save room. I didn't figure that one out til I was level 45, definitely could've used it earlier on.
---
A nice Striptease in my private Room at my Base
---
;)
---
The 20 hour reset doesn’t work well for people like me who get on at vastly different times from one day to another, I might only be on night one day then only morning the next day so I miss out entirely on the the limit that day cause I’m not playing at close to the same time each day 
---
Lever action is good. It's what I use 
---
Scaling should be fixed, but PvP immunity shouldn't be a thing. What should happen is you go out and waste him and collect a bounty.
---
Not that I saw, but I didn't really look. Too busy blowing through all my 5.56. But wouldn't be surprised if that was it 
---
Hey you are missing a couple of engines 
---
What perks are you using? I like building in my Watoga workshop and I just want them to leave me alone
---
They fixed plasma gun bullet collision detection by making them also hitscan weapons. They do decent damage for their fire rate, so far I’m not sure about durability. I just picked up a bloody one on my rifleman I’m using.
---
The big problem I see with them is they don’t work with anti-armor effects, don’t have armor piercing magazine mods like rifles, and don’t have silencers, so yeah, still some massive balance things to work out. 
---
It wasn't an event, just mutants. Heard them fighting bots so I ran in. Ended up with about a 15 min fight. So I guess I got my money's worth 
---
That is the kind of pvp I urge for lol.
---
Too bad workshop raiding became cherry picking.
---
Ultracite and X0-1 are equivalents, 
---
Ultracite has better physical resistance, but slightly less rad and energy resistance. It is better overall because &gt;90% of things deal physical damage, but is less rounded. 
---
X0-1 has good enough physical resistance, but is very resistance to energy, and is best fornuke zones due to having the top tier radiation resistance. 
---
Both are rather expensive to maintain and build, but excellent.
---
There are no "bad" power armors in this game, and you can run any suit and get excellent results, as long as you are mindful of the limits of each suit.
---
Everyone except yourself can see it as deleted.
---
who was defamed? no one knows who the hell he is.
---
I hope they do increase the budget, or tweak a few of the items to not take up an entire eighth of it (I'm looking at YOU, turrets and Brahmin Pen!). Just to be able to decorate my house and plant a reasonable number of useful crops, I had to abandon use of any turrets. I AM my home defense.
---
Ok thank you
---
Fantastic build! One of the coolest looking Camps I've seen by far! :¬)
---
Go Enclave bunker -&gt; White springs train station -&gt; Top of the world train station -&gt; Harpers -&gt; Technical Data -&gt; Watoga shopping -&gt; Watoga train station.  Responder is up to you... but if you go Vault 76 for free and then Grafton (day) you can get some mad caps on your journey to the one in the middle of town. 
---
Those are your two optimal options. Either a lever action or a hunting rifle.
---
Either bloodied or instigating as the main perk is best for the damage boost.
---
I like bloodied because instigating sucks after the first hit. Instigating if you’re one hitting.
---
Kinda funny though. You gotta respect the technique. 
---
r/jesuschristreddit
---
i bet all of those other players were talking amongst themselves like "geez, does this dude ever just slow down a little and take in the beauty"
---
Yea I’m really liking the spawn rates right now 
---
Pretty
---
This is the internet! No reasoning allowed!
---
My base is close to raider faction (pretty much middle of the map) saves a bit on fast travel costs think I spend under 30 caps traveling around to get to each vendor, though it’s not a huge difference I suppose 
---
I too have been arguing with many people about this but sadly they just say "it happened to me" so I'm expecting to believe then because everyone on the internet is 100% honest.  
---
Yes so much this 
---
~Balance~ = Nerf everything until all weapon types are doing wet noodle damage.  Then no one can complain about a meta build being *too* meta.
---
Pretty sure the author can contact Beth and release some rights of usage to them. 
---
I don't think you can sell them to any in-game NPC, but there's always places like [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar) if you still want to make money off of them
---
Rent it from redbox and try it out. If you like it buy it. Its probably relatively cheap at this point.
---
You can go up somewhere so that mobs don't hit you as well. From what I hear, some SBQ farmers purposely ignore these adds believing killing adds contribute to mass lag during fights since every kill has to spawn loot to those involved. Think it makes sense
---
Doubt they even knew I was there. Im not exaggerating when I say they were just staring at the sky. Just standing on top of the g2 site bunker, occasionally being bothered by a bloatfly. If its not the bunker, theyre standing on the little platform you have to jump to.
---
I'm actually impressed by how Yao Guais are programmed to be more dangerous than Death Claws. I mean, YGs will stagger lock you to death while a DC will hit you, maybe stagger you, then give you some breathing room as it decides to roar at you or do its 'throw rocks at you' attack. I don't get how the creature with the literal word 'Death' in its name does not invoke fear in a player the same way a big angry bear does. Though, to be honest, a big angry bear IS pretty scary. But a DC should be *beyond* that.
---
Don't hurt yourself patting yourself on the back.   I've done things the hardway too for no reason.
---
7 mins was my best time (that's solo). I make the cores in advance, picklock/hack to skip repairing the pipes. Me &amp; my pals all took a silo and raced 😂😂 it was the most fun I've had. 
---
I have literally never heard anything from him but insults. He does nothing but smear companies to create drama for ad revenue. 
---
And why shouldn't PVP immunity be a thing if you have Pacifist enabled?  We need one or the other, preferably both because griefers then can't bother lower level players if they have Pacifist on.  I was griefed by one dude who was 60 levels higher than me, I didn't attack once so he barely did any damage until suddenly he killed me when I was near max health.  He then followed me and my group to our workshop and iept griefing us all.  When we tried to defend ourselves he one shot use each.  That wouldn't have happened if Pacifist actually protected the player enabling it.
---
Alone? About 30 minutes, but I've never tried to do it fast.
---
Except when it comes to consoles even when access to add mods are there authors just say fu consoles. Fo4 has some mods but authors get all uppity and want to go to nexus.
---
:) I'll make sure to add that tomorrow, thank you
---
90% of the posts shitting on any and all criticism stem from this. I’ll admit I know fuck all but the people who do seem to think this is a shitshow.
---
The fusion core rate fix is a good start to making them desirable.  Ammo factory and others should get a little boost though
---
Surely there is a cheaper way to buy new games in the US, I paid like 50 AUD (Around 35 USD) for this game at launch on amazon... Maybe you should look around more instead of buying from gamestop or psn/ xbox store if you can only afford 2 games every year.  
---
Or maybe just wait a few months, because majority of games these days go atleast 50% off within 3 months.
---
black powder rifle is my go to.  slow reload, but that 1 shot is brutal.
---
Bruh when my friend(lvl 40) and i (lvl 30) tried to launch one we died in the launch room and now we cant even get back there even though we're at lvl 55 and 40 now
---
Yeah I don't paying it beats walking 
---
They can whitelist a single IP on a single Port and if they detect any funny business they can shut it down in a moment.  If they want to implement additional security they can allow mods that need network access to be signed by Bethesda with a cryptographic signature.    Just assuming that it can't be done is an indefensible position.  It is much easier to find any number of ways that it could be done easily.  For that matter they could restrict the traffic across that single allowed IP all the way down to message type, if they wanted to and that still wouldn't be that hard to add.
---
Maybe when there is more pve content in the game
---
Because _you_ are the Pacifist, not the guy attacking you. Plus, low levels absolutely destroy high levels. They have level scaling for a reason -- and it sucks. Not for you, but for the high level.
---
We want you to get rich so we can take all of your caps later lmao
---
It provides the exact disadvantage he is outlining here, but for everyone everywhere until you're killed.
---
But I agree he should commit and dew et
---
Despite the bad press the game gets, you have to admit that it did wonders for West Virginia. Hell, even though I'm not much of a travelling guy, I'm seriously interested in visiting good ol' Salt Pork West Virginia one of these days. Definitely on the bucket list now.
---
Nah, the truly best way to deal with them is stealth sniper. They can't hit or stagger you if they can't see you, one to two shots to the head and bye bye yao guai before he even knows you're there 
---
Fair point, I do recall that it was going to take some time now that you mention it for consoles, but it's not like it took very long for the mods to start showing up for PC  It wasn't that hard.   On a closed system like the consoles, yes they will have to write a management interface for mods or better yet they could get involved with the mod community and start figuring out which mods they could host for availability in-game. 
---
True
---
Am I correct that there are no t60 plans? I don't see them on your list nor have I ever found the actual armor plans anywhere.
---
 nice...so what other perks besides the ones you listed and riflemen obviously..do you use for this build? or is that it?
---
&gt; Practically speaking, this is way easier to do than tracking the amount of ammo that cycled through his account. I find the latter more difficult than the former. There was a point in time his character was looked at, and at that point in time he had an ammo count of X." I am not saying that is the cold hard facts, but I am saying that is your Occam's razor answer. 
---
Atomic Challenge: Collect 10,000 Caps.
---
It's not proof Bethesda is keeping track of every piece of ammo an account or character picks up, but it is evidence that they easily could if they wanted. I know I didn't have 10k caps on me when I completed that challenge. They do keep that sort of permanent log when it comes to caps.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if their servers hold logs of every single item every single player has ever picked up with timestamps down to microseconds of when it happened. Storage is cheap. Scanning that massive pile of data with a shifting 30 day window would be the (slightly) more difficult and time consuming part.
---
same.
---
Yeh def is there.
---
If ur on PS4 and I come across any I can give to u 
---
Pacifist preventing PVP would still keep a player safe from unwanted PVP interraction, otherwise Pacifist is only good for nuke zones.

Sweet!

I ran into the same mongrel.  I was able to target him and kill him with vats and melee as mentioned in the thread, but it was hard.  He did a lot of damage to me in the process.  I do wonder if it is just localized to the mongrel or if other mobs have had this happen?
---
Agreed, the production should be increased definetly.
---
Esp. the resource extractors, because you could gain alot more from looting locations on the map easily. Esp. with aluminium.  The extractors are too slow and have limits which makes it useless unless you are constantly pulling the resources out.
---
Id never considered the lag thing, thats a good point.
---
I can see why they do it, but then when theres 40 mob enemies around all shooting at you, how do you survive? Im not saying everyone has to be the terminator, but pay attention. If you see someone dealing with a heavy hitter, send some rounds their way. Glowing deathclaws and yao guai pack a serious punch, no matter what your DR is at.
---
My issue with most of the spots is you get a bunch of people on them them, they walk in front of each other, and I end up killing myself with my explosive gun, or just not being able to shoot because the hulking frame of an X0-1 is standing in front of me. Dont even get me started on the people with the marsupial mutation constantly landing 6 inches in front me. Try and go melee, and I cant even get close because of all the things staggering and swarming me.
---
I get it if theres only a few people, but when theres 12 people down there, there are 12 peoples worth of mob enemies to deal with. Thats a bit much to just ignore. At least take out the big guys first. 
---
Again, Im not expecting the world, just to pitch in. If you drop a nuke at 7pm, you cant expect to be down there alone.
---
I use a furios lever with a vats crit build
---
any one ever sprint for a minute straight, and the AP bar NEVER MOVES!!  ha ha!  suits me fine!  leave it that way Beth!!
---
Me too
---
I will but I must say that recently, I’ve run into utter annoyance with swapping perk cards in and out with so many activities. Building workshops, crafting at camp, making ammo, making healing, before entering a pve mission or event, then to change it all again so I am underweight enough to fast travel back to camp. Maybe it’s just because I spend a lot of time farming legendaries that my inventory is constantly packed with them to the point where I drown about 50% of them in the river next to my camp every day. 
---
But I digress, I’ll post my OP melee build. I don’t think I’ve fired an actual gun in this game in weeks because of it. :-)
---
They do massive amounts of damage.  Really quite more than just about anything else I've come across.  I think their damage output could be toned down just a little bit and they'd still be dangerous enough.
---
So we’re just gonna gloss over the sergeant gutsy’s with their OP guns?
---
No spear plans- do they even exist?
---
Skeleton
---
I was on the server when you launched it!  Couldn't stay, though.  Grats!
---
I'm glad you said it.  I've been meaning to say that the icons are too large when zoomed out.  They should get a little smaller when you zoom out.
---
I don't understand why they did away with it
---
Thanks looking forward to see it
---
Does anyone know if Deep pocketed Combat Armor plans even exist? I've been searching and grinding for them forever. 
---
Please do! 
---
The state really does have much more to offer than most people know. Most of the locations in the game will at least give you a starting point on what may interest you. Everything from 5 star resort (Whitespring/Greenbrier) to US history (Harpers Ferry) and the endless outdoor adventures, I believe everyone would find something to enjoy. 
---
The WV tourism site covers all the real life fallout locations and how to visit, but also there are plenty of West Virginians always excited to welcome new visitors.
---
I've checked all the vendors and none sell BOS plans. It's just a matter of learning by crafting/scrapping.
---
anything that can be loophole they sure as hell will fill it with story huh
---
There is always a bigger dog in the yard. 💪 Well done. Lol I do this at least once every couple days. But I chase said Dbag across servers till I find their camp. Set up artillery and unleash hell. Then go back to friend and give em the caps back. 👍
---
I agree with you, I edited the post for clarity. But I am also not a dev or a CommunityManager, I just play the game, so I cant help you much.
---
I'm assuming they nerfed it lol. Typical Bethesda, making the game harder for everyone when no one asked.
---
wow that is impressive, I do all of those things too. Yea racing through the silos is a lot of fun for me
---
haha wish we had more bugs like those
---
true never looked into that
---
You on Xbox? 
---
you underestimate the difficulty in placing what would have to be a 3x3 blueprint. theyre not going to stand where you need them before they pull the trigger
---
They are the only armour piercing enemy AFAIK, so they tear you up even in PA 
---
Definitely an emote if gratitude is good enough for me. And like the other bloke said, just Pay it Forward when you’ve leveled up enough to make it worthwhile. 
---
I’m level 130 and don’t expect low levels to pay me with weapons or armor or plans. Even though I have over 500 stims and Radaway in my inventory, I am always happy to get a few more. 
---
A lot of low levels try to be nice by offering random heavy weapons they’ve picked up (like fat mans or gatlings). I take them with a smile like that hideous sweater I got for Christmas from a random aunt. Then when they’re not looking, I drop it in the river. Ain’t nobody got time to screw with carry weight to lug a pointless fat man around. 
---
I seriously doubt it’s just me. ;-)
---
It might be because the Atom Shop is full of garbage that wouldn't earn 5 endorsements on the Nexus if free? 
---
But make it like Pokemon where you can't rename people's trades. You're stuck with the Ass-Eater 8000
---
I have a ton of gunpowder so maybe that’ll work!
---
This will be game changing for Power Armor builds. Then add functional Power Armor Displays along with an increased C.A.M.P. build budget and everything is golden. 
---
Could be the bots spawned the first wave and you the second. 
---
You can get the BoS combat armour mod (Legs, arms and chest) at Grafton Station.
---
yeah I'll just go ahead and drink radaway and fuck up all my other mutations. Sarcasm Included Lul. Speaking of which, they literally changed the damage table without even testing the change. Had they tested it they would have realized they broke the fuckin thing. LITERAL PROOF THEY DON'T TEST THEIR PATCHES.
---
PS4
---
yeah i dont want to find a TSE MAGA-Trump with crazy high damage for sale at a vendor and end up buying it
---
Yeah sure, and some of us work in C/C++, .NET, Java, JavaScript, VBS, Perl and several other languages depending on what is needed that day.  Today I've been building a simple HTA to query a table and then change settings on a computer on the fly.  So, when someone says something is easy, it might be.  Ask them what their background is in.  If they say they are a truck driver, you might ask further what their programming experience is.
---
It would be nice with that one Legendary Mod idea, but I doubt this’d work out.
---
dont act dumb dude if you have a mule and stay on reddit and youtube long enough you know how to dupe
---
But come to think of it, alright. I'm sorry I said "Yongyea has the face of an asshole." It's something I saw chanted on his comment section.
---
But me saying that it's accurate as I have never heard him say anything nice ever is still accurate.
---
Ive gotten some from treasure maps. I think the savage divide ones. Idk about others.
---
You sir have earned my upvote bravo clap👏
---
20 for me but I also loot everything. 
---
My build is as follows;
---
 S- rank 1 blocker
---
 P- rank 3 rifleman, rank 3 expert rifleman, rank 3 master rifleman, rank 3 tank killer, rank 3 concentrated fire
---
 E- rank 2 fireproof
---
C- rank 2 lone wanderer
---
I- rank 3 nerd rage, rank 5 demolition expert
---
A- rank 3 covert operative, rank 3 gun fu, rank 5 adrenaline, rank 3 dodgy
---
L- rank 3 bloody mess, rank 3 grim reaper sprint, rank 3 better criticals, rank 3 four leaf clover, rank 2 starched genes
---
Nah most of them just do it so they they can leave the tanking to the others. Very selfish move. 
---
Wow thank you! I appreciate the link! I'm not sure what these plans are really worth. Could I ask your opinion...what do plans typically go for? If you know
---
It takes a lot to get me that motivated but I like to get my point across lol
---
\+10 to pitching tents.
---
Got it. I’m not into PVP either, so I don’t know exactly how it works. the rules set up by Bethesda is just plain silly. ‘Even when you’re in pacifist  mode you can still be killed’, it’s like WTF? 
---
Well as a vanguard tank, id appreciate it if they stopped. I run around with my 550 dr outside of PA. I can loot legendary robots right on through the explosion, I just eat it all. If im saying its too much, its too much. 
---
Please help me and my bullet ridden body.
---
Not sure what you're trying to say.  
---
This is a fairly mild "feat" when it comes to people doing things faster than developers expect.  
---
People ran the numbers and his numbers *total* could be accomplished in a week if you dedicated the time to it. So, over a month is easy.  
---
And the game really does recount everything when you pick it up. Toss a legendary in a container and pull it back out. Or start a new character and get some wood. Then toss it in a container and pull it back out. Then check the "collect 76 wood" achievement.
---
200 years later and his shit is still floating around. Also Make Appalachia Great Again?
---
It absolutely CAN be done, but it shouldn't be. "Any funny business" would be between our client and the mod author's server, so Bethesda wouldn't be able to detect it before it was done.
---
They're more likely to implement the perk swapping themselves than this, I imagine.
---
Very nice work! Is it easy to get the Atom Shop fire place to clip through a roof piece? Never thought to try and usually set mine up under a mesh 2nd floor half tile outdoors.
---
I'm not doin math right now I'll believe you in this one lol
---
And radiant!
---
As far as I know, the bullets were made of lead and copper, but your birth certificate could have been part of the material.  
---
Thanks for the feed back ^-^
---
Right.. very sad...
---
Anyway no you wouldn’t be forbidden from criticizing it for having bought it / played it ... you’d be more qualified to criticize it fairly since you’ve played it yourself and have been able to build your own opinion on it, no matter if that opinion is positive or negative. And “played it too much” is a wild take I haven’t heard before. 
---
I could add to this but I’m sure you get what I’m saying and your comments so far tell me this won’t get very far either way. You’re clearly a passionate fallout/tes fan but you don’t like fo76 even though you haven’t played it, but thats honestly fine. I get that it’s not for everyone. Just let it be and save yourself the anger. Most of all don’t fucking come to the games sub and insult people who like it to make yourself feel superior. You’re not. 
---
How do you skip the pipes I’ve done it only in 2 different occasions 
---
pfffft....raiders.  all i do is sit in a server till every one is gone.......then go take 5 WS, build them up, go take more WS just for the XP / caps, no building.  at one point a few nights ago, i had about 9 WS at once.  funnier even still, the "defend WS" event seems bugged, as i would go long periods of time with no defend event, even with 9 WS!!
---
it is kinda funny when a raider does come to a WS, i get one shot, then ignore the raider.  most of the time, the raider does not even bother to take the WS as all they want is the PvP.  you keep ignoring them, they go away.  on a rare occasion, i get the "diehard raider" who just will not walk away, so i server hop, bye.............BYE!!!  it is no skin off my nose to start 2 - 3 WS over again.  been there, done that, bought the t-shirt.  used to it now.
---
have fun on your new servers.  certainly will not see me there!!  :-)  group PvE is where it is at.
---
I'm using a vats/bloodied build.  I have a VATS crit pipe bolt action that Is really handy.  It's also troubleshooter, so I crush most robots.  
---
For the big guys I have a bloodied Dragon, only 1* and reload takes forever but hit hits like a truck.  
---
I found I have to keep headphones plugged in now
---
You don't have to wear them, but it makes the TV have sound again
---
I was just referring to the conversation being about damage disparity between the two.  Throwing in vats would be a whole different set of arguments lol... also, melee does get that nifty teleport attack in vats so thats cool.  Even lets you teleport higher than you can jump.  Kinda pimp really.
---
Not to mention if you did get a reasonable rate, the need for acid would get even steeper.
---
Though I guess then the hemlock workshop with 3 acid nodes would be a hot spot.
---
Just get the high ground
---
This bug is still present after Patch 6.   
---
It's really disruptive for streaming and playing with friends. :(
---
Now it's been removed.
---
Well, that's intresting idea, brought by latest patch. Very intresting indeed. Then you place FT target inside it of course.
---
If workshops were fought over like supposed, that would be a bit griefy and broken, but the way workshops are currently used, that's quite fair, finally something for people who just want to farm the enviroment peacefully.
---
Ha, I have 3,000 atoms and the Mothman sleeping bag is the only thing I have bought 
---
In the room with the pipes to repair there is a lvl 3 lock pick door. It's to the left after you enter. Pick the lock, go into the room and into the next, you'll find a lvl 3 hack computer that bypasses the repair step and opens a hatch for you. Cuts out some time ❤️
---
&gt;You have more flexibility the way it is.. for example, if you play 4 hours every day, you can do your vendor loop at the end of your play session on day 1 then do it at the beginning of your play session on day 2. Day three you can do it whenever.
---
That's only true assuming you play the 4 hours at the same time each day.
---
If I play at 11pm one day, and 6pm the second day, and 10pm the third day, I cannot use the Vendors on Day 2.
---
The way it works currently is you have to have at least 20 hours between your play times to fully use the Vendors.  If the Vendors reset at the same time every day (doesn't matter when) you would have a full 24 hour period to play and use the available caps.
---
No robot armor plans, huh.
---
Our country thanks your nipples for their service.
---
all that you said is just a theory no onw truly how bethesda record things
---
all i see is that you people just keep searching for the loophole nothing more
---
Are they all instigating (Grognaks axe)? I saw one at a vendor for 165 caps and picked it up it's a level 50. Damage is insane, I'm level 56
---
craft them and scrap them to try and learn all the mods, or to just have them all.
---
I dunno man. There’s some god damn good named weapons in TF2 that’ve given me a good chuckle 
---
lol u sure do have ur ways around the wasteland.
---
True, most raiders only want the pvp. 
---
Then again, I would like to try capturing all the workshops on an empty server. Sounds like fun!
---
Largely people like me will never have those builds due to the absolute avoidance of any duplicated items.  My entire set save for one armor piece I traded a melee weapon for in the first month is self found... and mediocre considering how much time I spent gathering it.
---
A full set of perfect armor and weapon for a meta build is, without insane luck (real, not the stat) would be a good 500 hours or more and maybe not even then.  Sure I'm basing this on my hours played and my shitty luck and adjusting from there, but with my real world luck I likely would need 2k hours to get a perfect set of gear.
---
Going to suck if they nerf everything that is OP because of duped shit overstacking with perfect gear rolls.  The purge should have taken out all the duped shit.  Of course nearly everyone I know wouldn't have played anymore as they all have complete dupe sets and weapons and would have been running around naked... lol.
---
Junya Kaneshiro!? Is that you? Looks like you rebuilt Pigtron. Good for you, man.
---
I average about 15 MN. Tho fastest was 10 min but that was a glitch fest lol all turret spontaneously exploded as I approached and the robots would spawn and just float around. Never fought me. Was weird. The last stage was basically me standing around waiting for the launch prep to finish, that was the longest part and it was in alpha silo.
---
I put that stuff in the vendor's cash register. You almost always scroll over the register when you talk to the bot and it will hit you like a ton of bricks when there's something other than 3 Pre-war money waiting for you. 
---
I found a brown one for the first time today. Didn't know it existed before that. 
---
Did you try turning them off and on
---
Meh. It was a double edged sword. 
---
You'd get alot of "the customer is always right which gives me the right to treat you and other CSRs like subhumans" those were the calls I loved. They were used to getting what they want by abusing people verbally. 
---
Then you'd get absolutely pleasant people who were just at wits end without alot of options. Those were tougher calls, because the contract is the contract. 
---
I've since been working as a regional retail manager for a charity with a retail operation. It's once again put me at the mercy of the worst kind of customers ever. 
---
It's not so much about power. It's more about the public's acceptance of treating people in customer service like absolute shit. Customers are far more toxic , offensive and rude than online gaming, which is an accomplishment. 
---
The thing is I agree. The game wasn’t ready, and if they had not had the pressure of the publisher and suits in the office trying to get the “Christmas cash” we wouldn’t be dealing with 90% of the things we are.  
---
Flip side of the coin though is that they are legitimately trying to create an enjoyable experience and they have since inception, there’s just been roadblocks.
---
i remember taking the rocket station down by the munition factory to generate aluminum. Dude.......... it was slow as f! 60 aluminum scraps in an hour... 
---
You could go through flatwoods looting cans in ten and shit and get the same amount in far less time.
---
Love the hostility guy. It’s cool though.
---
A-fucking-men.
---
Bethesda was defamed by 900's false accusation.
---
I honestly thought that’s what Bethesda said was going to happen. Like you can create a small community of CAMPS together.
---
Reality than sets in and they won’t let you build near each other....
---
Just a thought.  Why not set a rep type system to each faction for trade.   More you trade with responders the more they are willing to trade (higher cap limit).etc etc. There’s plus and penalties that could apply as well.  Depending on how the future faction story content comes out.   
---
Sure enough the votes reflect it, lmao. Only one flawed game acceptable here.
---
I love you, Thankyou for making my year
---
Yes holy crap I’ve noticed it too 
---
Braced doesn't lower scope sway, it improves your melee blocking. Stabilized lowers scope sway 
---
I've also noticed my AP is draining faster too lol.
---
Stuck?
---
You mean Stabilized? Braced is supposed to be the one that reduces melee block damage.
---
Idk about that but the monster thing yeah
---
I was thinking they have to be within that small circle to claim. Like before only you could contest it from anywhere within that circle. 
---
I just bought it like an hour ago. Am loving it.
---
Yeah seriously I would LOVE a trip to West Virginia, but meh
---
I'm at 300 hours on one character in 76, couldn't even come close to that in FO4. Part of the reason is i love playing with my friends, and I have a pretty solid internet connection so haven't had as many issues as my friends for example. 
---
nah PC
---
Thanks for posting this, and I hope theme members who were wrongfully suspended get cleared.
---
This sub went from bad to worse in the last month, and watching it turn on Glorf was just sad. I’ve been a fanboy and let Bethesda off the hook for a lot of stuff but this did it for me.
---
You guys created a community of players and worked together to support each other and then were punished for it.
---
I’ll keep trying to explain that Bethesda has not been transparent on how they’re counting “acquired over 30 days items” and asserting that the jury is still out.
---
ok cool lol thanks for curing my insanity
---
Heating coil isn't a scrap mod according to this list. Puncturing is though:
---

---
same!  need combat shotgun here
---
I thought the same thing.
---
It's possible both are true ;)
---
Honestly I haven't noticed much difference lately. 
---
Ok. I don’t feign to know anything, but a lot of people on here do when they actually don’t. What’s worse?
---
People rarely seem themselves as the "Dbags". I think it comes from a feeling of powerlessness that people try to act powerful, and to have power over others. It makes them feel like they have some control, when really they have no control at all. Or rather, we can all have control and power over each other if motivated. And every act towards that end just reinforces how sad, empty and hollow it all really is. 
---
That queen acid doesn't fuck around! Some help would be appreciated. Lol feel you bro.
---
ok thanks
---
try whitespring, that's where I noticed a huge difference
---
I reaaaaaaaalllly want a Yao Guai Gauntlet in the future. It could just look like a hollowed out Bear claw mitten. 
---
It's hollow inside, with all my crafting stations. I picked this location because my camp is set down on top of that little storage shed so I get some extra build height. 
---
Hmm didnt know about the heating coil. i stopped scrapping after puncturing. 
---
New Yorker here. Im talking a vacation in April. The homewrecker challenge at hillbilly hotdogs is calling me! Gotta die of something!
---
I was thinking of taking the tour at Greenbrier however most the reviews are horrible. You only get to see a few rooms in the bunker because most are taking up by a company.
---
The glowing ones at white springs seem to be so much harder to kill with my guns but when I use my melee it was the same as before 
---
I literally stopped playing the game is so glitchy. Just can't anymore :( 
---
This, just claim and defend workshops and eventually you'll get it. It's not terribly uncommon. 
---
PC gaming with tv and controller on certain games if in your preference. 
---
That's the only Enclave event I make sure to try and do! The Mats from the Guai's are too good to pass up!
---
I've been running it.  Ghouls still go down fast.  I haven't tried a nuke zone since the patch though .
---
Are you running with adrenal reaction ?
---
Thanks for the comment buddy.
---
Just needed to finally jump into this one due to how toxic and disgusting some of the comments are around here.
---
Bethesda screwed up and several good people we know got caught up in this one.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Yes.  Several times.
---
The odd stack seems to go away after a relog.  Doesn't seem to be a dupe bug.  Had frags spawn like this once and couldn't throw them.
---
Bethesda, plz noes banz meh!
---
dense mod plus fire proof means that fatman would have hit you for 0 damage.
---
Whether this 900 hour 'guy' is bullshit or not, arguing that one side or the other is definitively correct is idiotic...
---
Especially arguing he has to be a cheater because beth says he is...  I had to log in yesterday to make sure I didn't get banned after having 20k lbs of flux in my inventory for all of 2 minutes.
---
Why would I have that much flux?  Some asshats shot at me when I walked by on a low level character and I suddenly wanted to know what was in the brown paper bag they were standing around.
---
Why would I keep it for 2 minutes or so?  Took that long for my poor creaking knees to crawl into the nearby fissure.
---
Would I be pissed if that got me banned?  Oh hell yeah.  I considered it my civid duty.  Well, that and laughing as they screamed curses into area chat when they realized where I was going was priceless.  Fucking priceless.
---
This some deep shit. 
---
I had a guy kill me with pacifist mode on, he chased me from harpers ferry to the truck stop south of there, I lost a few thousand caps worth of scrap to the guy because I was running around selling at vendors and had more on me than what i could sell. saying if you don't want to PvP its hard to be killed is misleading and false. I was level 110 at the time, couldn't defend myself because of pacifist and lost to a guy in his mid 60's who's goal was to kill me and rob me as soon as he realized that i couldn't defend myself. Once I was killed and got pacifist off i tracked him to his camp and whupped his ass, but he already had stashed my loot. Pacifist mode is far from fine, unless you like killing people who don't wish to pvp. 
---
Yeah I had that happen with 5.56 ammo. I just logged out and back in and it was fixed.
---
Leave server?
---
Buddy of mine 2 nights in a row dropped a nuke after the rest of us went to bed, and promptly got disconnected within 10 minutes. Kinda pointless to drop a nuke unless your grouped, I rarely hit a nuke zone without getting disconnected at least once. 
---
Those mechanos are only calmed with a swift hit via heavy sledge (or all rise if you got one).
---
yes.  Found them today
---
Aah, thanks.
---
I know I've crafted and scrapped so many combat chest pieces trying to unlock shadowed.  I suppose some would shell out for plans.
---
If there is public outcry over presumed banning of innocent players, there should be some kind of explanation from the developers. Even Blizzard responds to such instances. Bethesda has been radio silent and it's quite concerning, because it makes it seem like anyone could get banned for just playing the game. Justified ban or not, it's throwing oil on the already raging PR fire going for their game and it turns even more players away.
---
Couldn’t agree more. He’s manipulative garbage. Plain and simple. His followers are junk too.
---
I think you should be willing to remove bounties from our honest soldiers who remove bases from the white springs golf club
---
A video showing one scenario that doesn't result in bypassing slap damage is not proof that it is not possible. I witnessed on several occasions players with characters wearing nothing (i.e. naked) with explosive shotguns killing everyone on the map. Those few players that entered PvP mode couldn't kill them, their health bar would drop to zero and then zoom back to full -- it was working just like the unkillable mob bug works.
---
Probably hacks rather than exploits. But it can and does happen, even though that one person that made the video wasn't able to reproduce it.
---
Just a suggestion sometimes people will pick those locks to access to resources n workbenches n I could easily see a frustrated person without level 3 lock-picking just smashing your shit. Others actually want to role play as raiders which leads to a lot of behaviors that are reminiscent of griefing. These “raiders” will claim that the game encourages everyone to join in PvP. However, I noticed a key difference between the casual raider n the real raider. Real raiders are out there with bounties to show they’re the most dominant players on the map. See me n try to stop me. Shortly after launch there was a high level player n his friends who took up the position of Raider Bosses. They advertised heavily on Reddit about when n where you could fight them. However it seems like more n more people are becoming bored with game n are trying out PvP with all the same phrases you’d expect to hear from a griefer in GTA. Honestly, I’m not a fan of PvP n wish it wasn’t included but I know that battle royal was just too trendy for Bethesda not to shoehorn it in there somehow. Hopefully we get some PvE servers or groups roleplaying the Brotherhood n responders start to step up raider patrols. My sympathy to all who were griefed n had their shit broke but the best way to deal with griefers is to just leave the sever. 
---
Can confirm all heavy combat pieces drop at Watogo, but it is at random, only one (if at all) and not always listed. 
---
Graham also sells heavy combat as well. Harper's has Sturdy Combat plans. Both use the same vendor random load as mentioned above. 
---
I heard anti armor got nerfed to be worse than two shot, are you using anti armor?(dont hold me responsible if I'm wrong)
---
Suppressed Gauss is also a great choice. Heavy and slow compared to Lever but lots of power for stealthy sniping. 
---
I should have. But i also shouldn't have to. I've been to a few queen fights where a few people were there just killing everyone in sight while we trying to kill the queen. Other games have it so if your not flagged for pvp you don't get attacked, why is that so hard to understand? If you take a workshop I'm ok with that flagging you, but I shouldn't have to swap servers or come back to a leveled camp (had that happen also) because others feel the need to be asses. 
---
It would be kind of cool to tie it to the existing base building perks - not only use less resources to build but also take a smaller slice of budget to build.
---
Neh, they are all weak. Mutation, drugs, food and bloodied or TSE gun on a VATS build pretty much one shots everything. Only thing scary in the wild Appalachia are PvP builds.
---
&gt; Even Blizzard responds to such instances.
---
They do sometimes. And basically every time they do respond to such accusations, it's usually an accusation from, say, a Torb player who does nothing but throw as Torb and troll the general chat, or someone who received over 2000 reports. Basically any other time someone is actually *wrongly* banned, Blizzard support usually reaches out to them and works with them privately to come to a solution.
---
I'm sorry I honestly never realized it was 2 before my mistake 
---
What a hypocrite. 
---
Says he's out for journalism and loves games. But he literally manufactures controversy when there is none, and drives hate campaigns against every company out there. 
---
He says he doesn't let companies control his actions. Instead, he tailors his content to create maximum drama regardless of if a company is doing good or not. Nothing but caustic and angry hatemongering on his videos.
---
Wrote something about "by the people, for the people" and that he doesn't want your money. Yet, all his video titles are outrage clickbait and he has a tiered Patreon set up asking for money. 
---
What the hell kind of Patreon description is this? Has he ever looked in the mirror?
---
Oh thought you were advocating for the 20 hour reset period 
---
Why was it not mentioned then? Via twitter Facebook or even here. A simple single sentence would do the trick.
---
Did you mean: Griefers
---
YES
---
This would still give a massive cap sink since they’d only get back 1/4 or whatever, but not the punishing blow of buying an expensive plan and only seeing the caps go up to 200. 
---
If I'm at Whitesprings and I actually see them kill the base, then sure.
---
/s?...
---
Too long ago to have been me, but I do much the same
---
Welch?
---
It was not a camp, it was a shack under the bridge near Camden Park.
---
Nothing is impossible to program and implement but they don’t always have the resources to do it thus it becomes impossible.
---
I'm about 250 hours in myself. Also a fellow geezer. 
---
At this point I almost think of the game the same way I did Minecraft or Just Survive if you ever played either you know there are no quests or objectives. I log in and pick a goal for that session. I might do a few of the following:
---
Server hop and farm deathclaws.
---
Redesign my Camp.
---
Try to get the responder vendor bot spawn.
---
Farm events.
---
Gotta make your own endgame content ATM to keep it interesting.
---
Our group took donations as well. Judging by the amount, we assumed some of those were items stolen from dupers or it was dupers themselves donating, but we didn't care. And that got many of us banned. Do we think we were banned wrongfully? No, the ban was just. Those banned just quit the game or came back with a new account. None of them made a reddit post calling out Bethesda. Idc if you call me or my friends disgusting and toxic, guess we just have a different point of view when it comes to wrongdoings
---
At least I’m not the only one that does this...
---
Not what I mean. I mean developers literally saying "this is not possible in the engine no matter how many resources we throw at it" and then a modder proving them wrong, without using FOSE or NVSE or anything of the sort.
---
Like this box on the right of my screenshot? If so, yes, I see it too:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/an7hw3/pc_persistent_social_notification_supaflytnt_sent/
---
No.
---
Hit on the cute waitress. Still workable.
---
I mean there are many worse ways to go if you had to pick, I wish you best of luck on that challenge!
---
I have taken the tour at the Greenbrier, it’s not as amazing as it was when it first declassified as you mentioned, but I will say I personally still enjoyed it. You get to see and hear about the history and the rooms you do still get to see were pretty cool. My wife went when she was a kid and the place was exactly as it had been when it was an active shelter, that sounded way cooler but still fun to see. Either way, the Greenbrier is worth the trip even if you only visit for the day and walk through the halls/grounds. Exploring the place in the game should already help you know your way around. 
---
I hope you enjoy your visit! 
---
They won't bother with it because even if they could prove damages and won the case. People would warp that against them. So not worth the time or money.
---
Now gamer journals they could request a correction to articles or face minor legal action.  But that I doubt is worth it as well
---
Slow and steady, and lots of stim packs.
---
Ty man that was last on the list. Just with the banning going on just wanted to make sure I was in the clear
---
found 2 in the bog yesterday at random.  
---
I love it when that happens ... i need those mods for adrenal reaction!
---
Ive been tracking Grahm since i bumped into him in Watoga. We headed east from the city, then took the Big Bend Tunnel to the other side in the Ash Heap. I believe this is the dotted lines path on your map.
---
you just made a claim that you have no proof of.  What proof do you have that he was duping?
---
Games way better with friends than solo. 
---
If there was only 1 pool we’d never go to other vendors to see inventory. Next thing you all ask for is every vendor have every single plan in game. Do you guys even think about what you ask for? Want a vendor at your camp so you never have to leave lol
---
Yo, can I get in on that? My story mirrors Mr. Glorf, but I don't have 900 hours of play time, at least I don't think. I'd appreciate just a review of my ticket and situation, as I'm unaware of why I was suspended as well. Thank you for your time. 
---
I always thought the first heal was a feature and the second heal was a bug
---
no probs my psn is Chronic_Coit
---
No it is true I have the power core saver and I’m eating power cores like no business and taking wayyyy more dmg than I used to..something has changed for sure
---
Are you over encumbered?
---
Not noticed any budd to enemies at all they still go down is the same amount of shots 
---
My bloodied explosive  lever action went from 550 damage at low health to 375-400 since patch 6 seems like the nerfing continues.
---
I made a trip to West Virginia by car from Florida in November and it was wonderful,  but as someone from a completely flat state your mountains , fog and beware of falling rock signs terrified me  . 
---
got to visit the mothman museum and the guy at the door knew all about fallout and was super happy to chat about cryptids 
---
same thing happened when I visited flatwoods and the ice cream shop 
---
and when I visited the pumpkin house 
---
and they were super extra nice at hillbilly hotdogs (great food too ) 
---
at least when I visited everyone seemed to know about fallout , was happy to humor me when I wanted to take pictures of everything and seemed very happy to give me directions , tell me bits of local history and lore and point me to other sites to see and places to visit . I'm going back in a few months to hit some of the places I missed :) 
---
Here's my list. All plans, recipies, ingestibles, armor, weapons, underarmor, linings, and mods.

good luck with the homewreaker challenge we had a friend try ...his eyes were bigger than his belly :)

I've gotten the t60 torso and t45 left leg plans from treasure maps if that helps

I don't think this problem is related to HARDWARE, before the patch their was no such issues.

Try again I set it so I'm online now

Stopped reading right there.
---
nope, i am using tank killer tho
---
yeah, not working for me
---
yeah guns seem to be weake,r what guns u use
---
People were just so ready to start the hate train it didn’t matter what the circumstances were. Community Trading was a perfectly viable explanation for the amount of ammo Glorf had but everyone wanted to act like no one trades or that trading mass amounts of ultracite ammo is somehow taboo. 
---
Maybe if Bethesda doesn’t want players trading that much “rare” materials they should make them account specific, or at least specify in one of their inside the vaults before they started suspending accounts. 
---
I probably missed the suspension cutoff by less than 10k ultracite ammo and feel bad for people who truly did not dupe yet got suspended anyways. 
---
Adrenal is bugged as of the patch.  You have to remove and reapply it.  Which sucks.  That's probably why you're seeing less damage 
---
I started to use my tse lever action and noticed it didn’t do as much as the other day so I just thought “guess they upped damage resis” and switched to my melee
---
Otw. Inv repsycholer to team
---
I have a full team 
---
How many PA do you carry usually in your inventory? I usually have around 2, so I give one the mothman headlamp, and presto, I have one PA with the atomic shop logo next to it, and one without. 
---
Is there a sledgehammer plan in there or am I just missing it?
---
This is awesome!! 
---
I do think most locals, who aren’t even video game fans, are now at least somewhat aware of Fallout 76. I’m really happy to hear that you got to experience some of the WV hospitality I know and love. Would be happy to provide additional recommendations for your next trip, especially if it is to Morgantown and Vault Tec University!
---
P.s. I greatly enjoy visiting your state as well. Lol
---
I seen a statement about him being on disability leave from work.  That said, money gets tight and time gets abundant... you do whatever you can to stay sane.  Especially if it is some injury preventing you from being ambulatory.
---
yeah my tse Lever action isnt doing as much dmg lol
---
Dang ok
---
yeah im not sure, I've got another guy complaining that his TSE lever action also isnt doing as much dmg. Same issue im experiencing too. However he did say upon switching to melee his dmg was the same. So perhaps the issue lies in the dmg guns to do enemies.
---
Some people have no idea how to Queen fight. So you get sucked into an event you have a probability of like 50/50 of finishing. Then you bulk up and take revenge when your ready once you fail. 
---
the first thing that really hit me when I visited  was how Bethesda really condenses a town down to a manageable size.  
---
the mothman museum is definitely worth the trip and along the river is a flood wall with a mural that streatches the entirety of the flood wall showing all the history of the town . 
---
You look like a chaos terminator of Nurgle. 
---
Marsupial, a vantage and their lack of a ranged attack makes them... non events.  Mirelurk Kings on the other hand... yeah, @#$% those guys. ;\^)
---
If I’m not buying anything why should I care what they selling?  
---
Yeah I saw it there a couple times but it's more common in grafton 
---
We accepted the ban since it was very likely some of us were holding duped items. Community trading sounds all good and nice but if that involves mass amount of duped items that's a different story
---
It's also possible his melee build is so strong it doesn't matter.  Would question if he's also using adrenal reaction.  
---
Can we get "change server" as well instead of "quit to menu". 
---
How long till you drop?
---
This is incredibly helpful advice. Why isn’t there a stickied thread with helpful information like this?? I saw another helpful comment earlier today detailing how you can store power armour with the pieces on it even as a low level who can’t equip it yet. I wonder what else I’m not taking advantage of. 
---
I am ready to drop it right now just waiting on some people 
---
This is why bounties should be able to give someone negative caps/quest rewards are instantly sold to pay off the debt. People would get bored of creating characters because they aren't being rewarded. 
---
Ok. I'm at watoga but will be ready in 2-3
---
And then sometimes we burn people for being witches when the year's harvests are bad or when disease spreads. 
---
I'm not entirely sure how to calculate the odds. Thank the person rolling 20s when the DM does an ability check.
---
Me, although I don't.  If I had the mind to I could devote an astronomical amount of time to farming ammo on a single account.  But I'm missing some spine at the moment.  I believe that guy said he was currently stuck on disability as well.  Don't discount a broken persons dedication to fighting off boredom.
---
That said, he may be a duper.  Or may not.  Not enough information.
---
Player trading is one thing. Hording hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammo is another story. 
---
Your original point was that guns need buffs. They don't. Melee doesn't need nerfs either. The problem is so endemic to the game, I would call it unsolvable. Nerd rage, adrenal reaction, adrenaline, ninja, Mr sandman, sneak attacks, and more, all stack in such a manner as to be completely unmanagable. Individual nerfs would make them unusable alone, and using them in combination makes them incredibly OP.
---
Guns do the same thing as melee at hundreds of meters, and at full auto speeds.
---
The game is dominated by all or nothing builds, and it makes PVP stunningly broken.
---
yeah true
---
My quickest was 5min, but i think someone had completed everything for me besides the end, on average around 10-15 minutes. 
---
This upsets me. 
---
Please don’t compare a developer that won’t release a game until they are 100% sure they have the code on lockdown to an American company that values profit over value. It’s just not fair.
---
Ill take any locals recommendations on places to visit heck even opinions from other travelers based on their visit and  if we ever get an official "Fallout Florida , Alligators , orange groves and old folks edition " I'll be happy to give you a list of places to visit as well  ( we have a skunk ape research center in the middle of the Everglades....its a must to visit ) 
---
Hmmmm ok I have quite a few maps that I need to find. Hopefully I get them soon! 
---
F
---
For me on Xbox very busy alot of players actually, must be the stash increase 😊.
---
That wasn't a question, it was an insinuation.  
---
Also the ToS are so vague and convoluted you could be in violation for damn near anything.
---
Dumb question, but I remember that Phoenix (BoS Vendor) used to sell Signs and Letters. Does he not sell it anymore?
---
&gt; If I saw a scorchbeast in the distance I would avoid that part of the map
---
I had the same just now: was looking for a lead vein way up north to place my camp next to. I see the vein to my left and to my right 3 (!) batshits flying right past me, hovering nearby. Well I guess I didn't really needed lead that much anyway.
---
Point being, I agree so much that it's so immersive to see a Scorchbeast blocking the area you want to be in, and you not being high enough level to do anything about it. Also the fact that you can clearly and very ominously see/hear them makes it even better.
---
Understand he is on disability but given he had like 150ultracite ammo is dubious.
---
It's about 45000 violet flux u need and to get that u need a shit ton of pure flux and hardened mass it's just not a viable thing to do in 30 days I dontvreckon
---
Be glad that Glorf got an explanation.  Most presumed guilty until proven innocent people are still waiting for an explanation with open tickets. 
---
I got the ban hammer.  I’m guessing it’s for a large amount of junk I picked up from the bag of a dead duper.  I won’t claim to have killed him—that prestige belonged to a horde of ghouls.  But I picked up a large amount of junk, out of reflex.  I quickly thought better, and put everything back.  Maybe that was enough?  Bethesda isn’t answering me, and whatever.  No skin off my back, and I’m sure they have more important things to do.  I’ve enjoyed the game, and have been playing an alt account, but tomorrow I’ll be playing Anthem.  And I won’t look back.
---
But I wish you guys the best, and harbor no I’ll will toward Bethesda.  I still believe the game has loads of potential, and I’m hoping they can turn the PR nightmare around.
---
Agile.
---
So your willing to help one guy (support team)! What about the rest of us who play similarly! I’ve received this temp suspension as well and have traded items in the same fashion between accounts and loot so much junk I have to drop it more often than use or sell it. I’ve submitted Tickets several times with no response! Lvl200+ been playing since beta and purchased the PA edition of the game! Maybe a full scale investigation into the detection system your using would help weed out the innocents! 
---
Spooky scary boi
---
There should be an Advanced Power connectors plan at eother Watog a or Harper's Ferry.  That had the conduit.  
---
Quick question: Anyone have suggestions for uploading pictures of my CAMP to this reddit? (Do I need an imgur account?)
---
The "no appeals" thing is pretty crap.
---
&gt;Stable flux
---
&gt;below 50
---
As much as I’d love to get me some more cobalt, I don’t think too many people that haven’t reached 50 will any any flux at all
---
Anthem is an amazing game playing it now myself. We have one of our lads unbanned so far after alot of back and forth with Bethesda. We just gotta get the rest sorted.
---
Pretty much tired of the game and Bethesdas handling of the Fallout franchise at this point.
---
Where can one buy the neon signs/letters?
---
Dont you nerf my Yao Guais :( get animal legendary armor. they need to be op. 
---
Shoot em twice with Enforcer and no problem.
---
You can still we have gotten one of our lads back so far. The rest are having zero luck so far with support. Its just something that we should not have to be dealing with at all.
---
We should be playing together as a clan not fighting with Bethesda to play the game. We were easily doing 8-14 hours a day most of us together.
---
For them to take away that was not very nice.
---
They are the apex predators. Everything should fear them. Why would you purposefully land and make yourself vulnerable when you have a toolbox of aerial attacks to subdue your prey? I think I may RP a nature researcher on my next character. 
---
Funny that I've never had any problem whatsoever with Yao Gai's. My kryptonite as a low level sniper were those damned teleporting scorpions. Then again I'm not at that point yet where I've found more than two together.
---
Damn. An online community that's not toxic? This is rare
---
bloodied hunting rifle with 50% crit damage with perforating magazine for AA with tank killer.
---
Or bloodied lever action with 50% crit damage, although, the lever action can't get perforating magazine, although it has higher damage, only issue is a high damage resistance target could soak it up.
---
Bloodied gauss rifle is amazing, you could get perforating capacitor on it for AA. The charged shots don't even need a vats crit to one shot. Plus, most players don't use leather much, and most likely have low energy resistance.
---
It started unplayable, but it has been slowly improving. Truth be told, I have enjoyed it a lot recently. 
---
Yeah I heard about the glitches lmao. I just don't want it to be like ESO. Hyped up and then trash
---
Everything your are talking about is something that I had actually noticed before the patch.   No, it wasn't related to TSE nerf. We'd killed her at list twice after that. But there was one other time when she was more bullet spongy, was hardly landing at all, and there was a shit ton more scorched minions on the ground.    I had been suspecting a stealth buff even before the patch.
---
I'm about 4 or 5 hours in and haven't met a toxic person yet. Although I did witness someone nuking someone or something! lol
---
Seriously rare
---
Thanks, I was wondering if they'd ever be worth coming back to. How the mighty have fallen. Damn shame. 
---
If only they knew that there are loads of 3* legendaries running around with those enemies... lol
---
So for several months they have been promising new content...and....no new content.   
---
Also the OP is talking about SBQ dropping new loot. That isn’t new content.  That’s changing a loot pool.  
---
Literally read.
---
I have actually not gotten hard bargain once
---
Apologize if this is not a plan per se, but is there no way to unlock crafting plasma grenades in this game at all?
---
Is it? I just started so that is wild.
---
Damn. Coulda helped you out on Xbone. Good luck. 
---
bro seriously? that's awesome! i had to leave because my body was fucked, though, as you could see with the pics. but thanks!
---
No you misunderstand. Everyone does this. The entire community of FO76 is so non-toxic that it's actually rare
---
Now I know where to go outside of my usual theme parks and beaches (which are all awesome)
---
My quick list of places to check out in WV would definitely be the New River Gorge region, the Greenbrier/White Sulfur Springs/Lewisburg area and the Canaan Valley/Blackwater Falls/Seneca Rocks area. Depending on if you want adventure sports, fancy livin’ or beautiful scenery and lively small towns, these three are some good ones! 
---
lol
---
Ahh haha I get it
---
eh.. i did quite the contrary on slow and steady.. i rushed with my all rise and blade of bastet and chugged stims. the downside, though, is that now i have a very small amount of them left
---
It started unstable, but fun. Patch after patch breaks and nerfs more things. It may be a little more stable now, but I don't find it fun any more and I'm debating uninstalling it to make space on my console. The last patch forced me to uninstall games I didn't want to for some reason, when I had plenty of space available. I was waiting for something in the atom store that never came. That was pretty much all I was logging in for. Still hasn't turned up. I loved the game but it has just been so frustrating I couldn't recommend it in its current state, unless you can get a deep discount on it.
---
great bait. look how many aspies showed up lol
---
I was on ESO day one, and it was indeed trash. Now its my main MMORPG, Bethesda knows how to fix stuff.  If FO76 would have been released in its current state, another story...
---
Its an amazing experience, definitely worth the buy.
---
It does a good job for being the first Fallout with multiplayer.
---
Just some basics. Expect pvp if you take a workshop. Follow your quest lines and participate in events. Loot everything and scrap it before you store it in Your stash. Unlock all merchant factions as soon as possible. Your going to have a blast. Despite all the bad press it really is a great game. With every patch we see improvements. 
---
Never mind. Bounced servers upon login had items. Server lag apparently. 
---
As you transfer back from the mule to your main character it would und up at 100k
---
I get this a few times every time I play. Sure doesn’t bother me one bit 
---
weve been dealing with this since the 90's man. people are gonna complain en mass. get used to it.
---
So for several months they have been promising new content...and....no new content.   next months plan of content still isn’t any new content until they actually release something.
---
Is this gonna be another one of Valve’s “Soon^T^M” things? 
---
I'm surprised that people are saying such good things about it. I mean all I heard was "FO76 shit. FO76 this. FO76 that." Never heard a single positive thing about it
---
Blizzard has openly commented on a number of instances of banning, wrongly or not, when public outcry has reached a certain point such that it is a genuine PR issue. It's only smart to do this. They don't want to be accused of falsely banning people. That really damages rapport with their userbase.
---
Obviously they are technically not obligated to discuss bans, but in a way they are. You can't just keep that image of banning players for whatever reason when the public has good reason to believe it was an undeserved ban. This is exactly what is happening with 76 and it's just hurting the image of the game and the developers. Just look at how many more articles from big publications have sprung up and shit all over their game. Look at the outcry from genuine players. Not a good way to do business.
---
PS4 players are the chillest of all consoles
---
scaly skin buddy, get that free defence and bird bones.
---
You never know when your going to have to jump off a cliff to keep your stealth.
---
I'll prolly buy it for 30-40% off. Know a brilliant local store and its owner
---
*Bethesda Didn’t Like That*
---
I think this is enough internet for the day. 
---
Do you recall getting any repeats in general? The system is awful and I never get any new cards.
---
I believe she is scaling as if 24 people are there. So if you dont got 24 people pulling their weight or at least 5 people with min/max builds.... she aint gonna die. 
---
Ive killed her and not killed her post-patch. 
---
Do you often open level 3 safes ect?
---
currently it is much less of a hot mess than it was at launch , the game is genuinely fun but currently has no additional content so once you have seen and done everything you may get a little bored (but new dlc is on the way so it's almost like you are starting at a perfect time ) 
---
I mostly play with my partner in crime and personally I'm thinking the game is more fun as a duo than solo ...but you really dont have to or need to team so you can still be a lone wanderer if you wish .
---
hmmm they are still balancing things  and it's not uncommon to see a patch adjusting perks downward so if things getting adjusted bug you then you might see red from time to time . 
---
hope you enjoy it (there are some really good deals on the game atm so it's not a bad time to pick it up) 
---
thanks !
---
Speaking of patches, are they as huge as the rumours suggest?
---
Yes we are
---
I’ve got a character fully specced into weight and I have 90k ultracite ammo and 200k various other ammo, it weighs almost nothing and I can make a good amount of caps selling it to other players and also other traders.
---
Seems to me you don’t fully comprehend the trading community in this game, or at least you don’t want to try to is the more likely scenario. But please explain to me the difference..
---
I go around as a nurse, but is the plain dirty one
---
Springs as well wtf why are they so hard to come by.
---
Assault Marine what's ur offer?
---
Dude I wanna name my gauss rifle REBA LXXVI
---
A weapon that you have acquired that is too high level for you, free bounty kill, rarer junk, etc.
---
I'm on PC,  there was a initial patch that felt large but otherwise I havent really felt like the patches have been out of the ordinary in size . 
---
I'm pretty sure you are correct. I got the mentats recipe from part of a quest and found the plans a few hours later. I saw the plan in my inventory and assumed I hadn't read it yet but as soon as i clicked learn, it said already known and it applied the "known" tag. Same thing happened with the ultracite PA plans after the brotherhood quest. 
---
I got a few from events. I got all the mods just from scrapping. 
---
Do any vendors sell gatling plasma plans?
---
Came here to say exactly this.  I want a "forfeit" option.  As someone who didnt buy any duped God tier gear all defending a workshop comes down to is fast traveling there and dying in a single shot.
---
It's easy to swing the banhammer wide without taking the time to look into specifics of what's happening with an account.  It's also easy to point and laugh at others misfortune without knowing what's really going on.  I'm hoping Bethesda makes good on this.
---
adrenal is nerfed thats why
---
But maybe Bethesda should have just deleted those items instead of suspending people who never actually duped. From what I understand they can tell when you make a server rollback, maybe just ban those involved in the actual duping and delete any duplicated items across all accounts. 
---
Just seems lazy imo to target people with 100k of a “rare” item and then include ultracite ammo in that list. Nuka colas, yeah that’s a different story but with the amount of people who play melee in this game people literally drop ammo and mats on the ground in peoples camps.
---
Teed off on her, booted twice. Came back to a dead SBQ and no loot. FML.
---
I'll make sure its scary then
---
I also am having  trouble with the video as it keeps going to black and back.
---
Thank you for this! 
---
No, that’s if you destroy bases that are anywhere *but* the resort. 
---
wow 1 strength  .ok..looks good..thnx for the info..do you think luck.plays a part in getting good legendary drops?
---
Why does hoarding = another story (i.e. it's ok if the person got slammed) in your mind?  Hoarding is against the games terms of service?  morally wrong?  what?
---
They should unlock by level. One thing to note is that they don’t always list by alphabetical order. The Expert Rifleman and Master Rifleman are right after Rifleman. Similar for other perks like Heavy Gunner. 
---
Yeah but you can’t silence it which might be a little detrimental for a stealth sniper build, but if you can get em with 1 shot then I guess it doesn’t matter lol
---
I've gotten 
---
Having a bounty either makes you a easy target or the type of player that surrounds himself with non wanted buddies. Hold up somewhere probably with his buddies. 
---
It's awkward for both parties at times. Honestly killing a person that is trying to be a raider in the open with a bounty isn't even satisfying. If you know the mechanics you pretty much pick when you take him out. Honestly I would not know a solution, being able to see others while wanted maybe?
---
Pump is fairly easy to get from patrol duty
---
On my current base I skipped turrets and built a concrete barrier wall around my crops and extractor. I'm lucky enough that enemies only spawn from one side of my camp so it's pretty easy to defend. Turrets just seem useless and take up way too much budget. 
---
I bought the plans for the clean version of the small water purifier from the Atom store which includes both the clean and dirty versions. So I believe this could be a bug. 
---
I am just not sure where. I don't know if the Atom purchase for the clean version should include the dirty version, or if the plans not marked as known is the bug.
---
Not a bug, bulk screws can be used like normal screws. If you hover over the item it will tell you what you will get. People use bulk for crafting
---
I just had an Assasins gauss drop with 50% crit and reduced weight, can’t wait to test it on survival servers. That’s a good point about leather armor too. 
---
Sorry but I’ve joined another group already so there’s no need to recruit me now. 
---
have had that thought for a while now.  taking the night off, but i may give it a try in the next few days.
---
Yeah, but if you buy them from a vendor you can't scrap them. You lose them if you do.
---
Yeah I have all the bells and whistles just not the plans for the guns themselves. Kinda stupid not offering them on a vendor. What makes a shotgun different from any other firearm in this game.
---
Yes, good with salt and science, over and over
---
Because there is no need to have that many items and for a single player to have it is suspicious as fuck.
---
You never get anything from scrapping bulk items, I’m confused why u even tried
---
For what it's worth, I'm still immensely appreciative of all the hard work you put into unfucking New Vegas. Even if that guy is an idiot.
---
That might make sense. I got Ultracite armor plans from the SBQ.  All of which I already knew from reading the terminal at Fort Defiance after one of the updates. When I clicked on it, it simply left it in my inventory and added a (Known) tag in front of it.
---
500k ultrcite ammo on his account 
---
Oh right. Brainfart had me thinking all characters in an account were counted together haha. Thanks for correcting me there.
---
yeah.  right about that.  i still got my .308 silenced sniper rifle with sniper perk, tormentor, tank buster, master rifle, etc.
---
Thought they'd supply me with the components, as that's what the dialogue window said. Maybe I misread. Sigh.
---
I have tons of flux but have 0 use for it at this point. Tried giving it to a higher level but he didn’t need it. No idea what to do with it at level 37 lol
---
To be honest with all the things going back and forth I'm not sure if
---
* It was ever broken, or just nerfed
---
* If it truly was broken, if reapplying fixes anything
---
* If hunger affects it instead of / in addition to health
---
* If hunger does affect it instead of health, if you still need to reapply to get THAT working
---
It seems like everyone disagrees about what's going on. I have noticed damage increasing over time which could be caused by hunger or some other random thing.
---
I only bulk what I plan on selling and instantly sell it after. I used to bulk everything just to keep my stash organized but now it’s just not worth the plastic. 
---
I got iron fist 4 times. It's the nature of RNG. It's not a bug.
---
Supposedly, her Damage Resistance rating scales with the # of players / Level of players present. So she could have an insanely high Damage Resistance and all hits are doing 1-5 points of damage.
---
Well, it's easy with stacked tses. If you got millions stacked, that's a dupe. heck, if you got two of the same tses stacked, that's a dupe so there's no problem wiping them. But should we delete stacked ammo as well? I don't think so.
---
Definitely true about ESO.  It is now one of the best MMOs out there
---
That's weird. I have found them randomly around different locations. I used to pick the plans up and put drop them in WS, or put them in the Overseer's boxes. I finally stopped picking them up so that people could find them randomly. The last set I saw was at the Blackwater Mine (outside next to Tinker's Workbench). Hope that helps, but it could be more random.
---
Weightless? 
---
Hahaha I keep my heavies for whatever reason. I tried giving flux but he didn’t take it. Oh well!
---
I did manage to give a guy a couple bulk springs and felt pretty good.
---
I am terrible at killing enemies (my aim is garbage due to some nerve issues in my hands) and it’s funny because I just enjoy tagging along and getting the occasional kill but if I try and do things alone I honestly just die repeatedly haha. Then I go back to camp and redo it for fun.
---
You might ask why I even bought 76 but I just love the franchise! :)
---
Opinions on modding methods vary, but with Fallout 4 there's essentially two different ways to do it (and you don't mix them).
---
First way is using the integrated mod menu in the game which pulls mods from Bethesda.net. I could go on for pages about why you should not use the in game mod menu, but the short version is that it's very limited. It's the only option for console players and so I'm thankful for it's existence anyway, but it's a bad option for PC users.
---
Second way is to use a mod manager utility to install mods from [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4) (click this link to browse what all mods are available). There are probably a half dozen mod manager utilities but nowadays there are two that most people seem to use... MO2 and Vortex. I use Vortex. It's the manager that Nexus Mods currently supports.

As far as how to actually mod the game with the manager there's a great tutorial series on modding Fallout 4 that set me on the path. It can explain the basic how to better than I can. Here's the first video, the links to the rest should be there too. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgUbpIzdpGY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgUbpIzdpGY)
---
Other than that the best advice I can give is get set up with the F4SE script extender because you'll want mods that require it eventually (some of the best mods require it). Watch the compatibility between mods you use because it's easy to run into problems with mod conflicts if you're not careful (eventually you can learn to fix conflicts rather than avoid them). Don't download any mods that look shady or have a lot of known bugs and watch it especially with any mods that are script heavy or break previs or break precombined meshes.
---
Replying multiple times is abnormal but it's not frowned upon or against the rules or anything.
---
I'm not familiar with assault
---
Again, every living person is from Vault 76 and would know each other.
---
lol, there is one HAPPY level 11 out there last night.  i fast traveled to their base, got on comms, he had a mic too.  i dropped about 15 plans, including a warehouse building set.  guy must have had voice activated comms, because i heard him mutter, "holy shit!"  dude took all but 2 of the plans.  i grabbed them and fast traveled away.................
---
santa claus has left the building!
---
you are welcome random player!  lol  ;-)
---
Pretty specific solution for a very rare problem though. 
---
Don't bother hording weapons and armor.  Scrap them to learn mods for them
---
I'm in the same boat. I found what I like to consider my forever spot, it's got a junk node and access to water. I'm so close to my budget and keep changing things to keep it from maxing out because there's plans I don't have that I want to add. It's caused me to be more creative in a good way but I still wish I didn't have to worry as much. 
---
Awesome 🦆 
---
https://youtu.be/Yhj6ANT1qrg
---
I'd argue you're stupid and dont understand how programming works and that it's not "just to fix" a problem because that can indeed fucj the game up even more and they might not even know what is causing the issue or who to fix it in a way that doesnt break the game even more so instead of doing that they take some time to actually fix it properly.. 
---
But yeah and you've made clear reasonable thinking isn't your strong suit.
---
Bethesda has managed this game awfully from before release, and it’s not really surprising at all what happened to Glorf. They’ve been characteristically opaque throughout this entire journey so far, with their ban wave methodology being no exception, which makes trying to make an appeal frustrating I’m sure, since you can’t even try to hash out where they made their mistake. 
---
woodchuck X3 here
---
That's tubad.
---
Yes. Cus a typo = stroke
---
I love this idea. The mobile feature is a great idea but breaks down when you build neat things that fit the landscape or find a nice place to put down a purifier or two. I'd be cool with them only allowing maybe less than ten items period in your mobile camp so you can have a tent, bed, crafting, and such.
---
If I didnt sell it all the time I’d have 500k on my account easy, plus that’s a made up number it was closer to 350k according to the email sent by Bethesda. Also He believes it tracks the amount of times you transfer the items towards the total, which could be true but Bethesda hasn’t responded to this yet. but glad you’ve got your facts straight and I’m not arguing with a troll lol. 
---
Sounds to me like you’re just parroting talking points and not actually doing the due diligence to be factually correct.
---
Doesn’t change human nature. 
---
Just give me a little highlighted bar in the budget when I'm trying to place an object so I know how much space it's going to take up. Kinda how they tell you how much of your budget is stored. And while you're at it tell me in a percentage how much of my budget is in use rather than that nondescript grey bar. I want to know if I have 15% or 25% budget left. 
---
Can’t imagine trying to do anything quickly in this game. I’m always getting up to make coffee or post on Reddit while I play.
---
For Bethesda, ammo that you can make 180 of per craft not including super duper is in the same category as nuka quantums which are incredibly rare in the wild. It’s just dumb.
---
Glorf got banned for acquiring too much AMMO only. Every real duper had stupid amounts of stuff that exceedingly rare in insane amounts. 100k ammo is not that much for some people, and it’s also a more reliable currency than caps are. That’s what people don’t get. There IS a reason to make that much ammo. It weighs a fraction of its material costs and will hold its value because players will always need it.
---
Well, that’s a lot of us. Even with 76’s shortcomings, it’s still a great Fallout game. 
---
With aiming issues, consider a melee build. That’s what I have been doing since the beginning of playing this game and I run circles around players trying to back up enough to effectively use their rifle or whatever when I’m just hurling a flaming sledgehammer at the beast and causing more damage in one hit than they can muster with 4-5 pulls of the trigger. 
---
I scrapped 100+ black powder rifles before I realized the only mod I was gettin was the bayonet. Still an awesome weapon to include. What do you think about the Dragon? Does it have significantly lower range and accuracy?
---
I have gotten that a couple of times from defending a workshop. I just drop them in the workshop. After reading how difficult it is for some folks, I think I may just keep them and post them for people to have. I don't really care about caps. I don't have all the plans, but I stopped really buying them because I am NEVER going to use a golf club, or rolling pin for example. (I say that but I got a Mutant Slaying Rolling Pin... and accepted the RNG gods challenge. I beat a couple to death and then pitched it.)
---
&gt; I will die if something hits me at that low of health
---
Yeah this is why I don't think this one needed a nerf. It's like highest risk/highest reward. It's not something I want to do by a long shot but kudos to those who do.
---
Exactly, most people won’t sell stuff for caps nowadays so you have to find what the market demands. Ultracite ammo will always be in demand due to the sponginess of the queen. 
---
10/10 would deposit money in again
---
What is this Pokemon Go?
---
True it’s just ammo, at some point it’s gonna get shot and be gone unlike duped weapons. 
---
I always see the Ultracite Laser Gun plans at Vendor Bot Phoenix in Watoga.
---
Why do you need it? Isnt it a quest item or sum like that? (Idfk what it is)
---
I have a nice country cabin, but this is nice.
---
I would add to this wait to do quest till level 50 to acquire better leveled loot for the missions it’s slow going to level 50 but it makes it better and there’s always people to group up with that will share perks with you so that you can level up faster
---
It's a quest item.
---
Just put your welcome mat in the room. Change walls to doorways if you want out. 
---
Yeah makes sense. I haven't done that quest yet, and I'm level 86, so I can get you a level 50 one if that's what you need
---
**Controls:** Pressing the Quick Swap key (Default: Left D-pad) after the current weapon breaks now correctly swaps to an alternate weapon.
---
The above is not working correctly on the PC. In point of fact, since the update my dweller can't remember their secondary/alternate weapon for more than a few minutes. This makes for a rather problematic experience as my fists are not a trained skill and that is all I have left when things go south.
---
Tuba and chair is love, tuba an chair is life.
---
I don't need one, and I'm level 64.
---
More like BUGtag amirite!?!?
---
That is essentially what that subreddit consists of, yes. 
---
Yep. When it comes to condensing value into weight it’s one of the best stand ins for our capped currency (pun intended) that maxes out so fast.
---
So much of the condemnation coming at him is because the fan base is largely single player fans rather than MMO fans that play the game by studying and then maximizing the mechanics of online games. The gap between these two communities is part of the fundamental problems Bethesda’s encountering with this title.
---
So why are you making this post?
---
Yes! Thank you!
---
I'm not. This isn't my post.
---
Need it to kill the Mr./Colonel Gutsy robots easier. 
---
Oh wait
---
Sheet
---
Ah ok I'll get one for you tomorrow mate
---
Sorry m8
---
I always place my ultracite armor down on my second character who isn't 50 yet and get kinda annoyed having to wait for it.
---
I agree with Sunhammer01. We need mobs that are scary. I think that scorchbeasts are too easy to kill though. Aside from constantly flying, what's hard about them? They should be harder to kill than a bear. I love walking up to a Yao Guai a bit too confidently and getting smacked around. When was they last time anyone 100+ died fighting a SB?
---
Is okay Jüan
---
I'm thinking that's why they are letting people get away with just a suspension
---
I just maxed demolition perk. I have an anti armor fat man and a fiat full of MIRV frag grenades. I LOVE hearing those annoying turrets outside of the club house now lol
---
That sounds cool. I think there's plans for a fancier mirror available from one of the vendors inside Whitesprings. I still want a sink though
---
No the number between the two accounts would be around 500k ultrcite ammo. You are purposely trying to round it down. 
---
And why would you accumulate that much ammo? Even trading to earn caps that is a ridiculous amount to have.  There are countless people who have been trading since the game was released.  They have not been targeted by the temp ban. Trying to say it is just because of trading is attempting to deflect away from the topic.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
I have gotten T-45 an T-51b plans. I have not gotten a T-60 one yet from treasure maps. Someone told me not to use the treasure maps until I was level 50+. I tried one at level 20ish, and then the same place at level 90. The difference was shocking. I started finding plans that I had not seen before anywhere like the PA plans.
---
On a different note, I started using the Radio Tower near Watoga for Government Requisitions, and the goods have been high level and modded. Once I scrap them, it seems like I learn a new mod on each item. Hope that helps. I have also gotten plans.
---
It was alright. Hard to tell because by the time we launched the nuke the server was dead. There were mutants, glowing ghouls, scorched, scorchbeasts, hermit crabs and some mirelurks. Not many legendaries but seeing as I was in the zone by myself I wasn't expecting much. Flux wasn't bad. With Green Thumb on I ended up with roughly 30 Cobalt, 52 Crimson, 40 Yellowcake, 120 Violet and a few Fluorescent. The spot we launched hit two fissure sites as well.
---
It’s a possibility, we honestly don’t know. They’ve not told us how they determined the numbers. 
---
&gt; Blackwater Falls  
---
I wish that Blackwater would have made it into FO76. 
---
I thought so too. If someone is running blocker and dense+fireproof, I'm not gonna be able to do much damage even before the nerf
---
I have not seen the plans, I learned it by scrapping combat armor.
---
Rip
---
The fact that he got banned for it is pretty good evidence he was duping. 
---
Yeah, variation is just too big to balance.  Normalization is a big maybe and would probably be gamed just as bad.  Only way pvp would have worked was separate stats to remove level/mods/perks.
---
Skins available currently in game are:  
---
T-51b Nuka-Cola (mini-quest, kinda hidden)  
---
T-60 BOS Initiate (grinding Forbidden Knowledge)  
---
X-01 Prototype (received with the plans)  
---
Would like to see more added in through quests and such. maybe ranking up faction paints if they decide to go that route.
---
Hard bargain lvl 3 + grape mentats makes them cost 17.9k caps for me (charisma lvl 7)
---
Show me your proof that he duped. One of the users here did the math on how he’d get that sort of ammo and discovered it was certainly possible for him to have the unholy amount of ammo he had. His whole group was dedicated to the game and they bounced items back and forth all the time. He isn’t a bad guy, he is, or was, one of the game’s most staunch supporters. 
---
Gaming journalists should be calling Bethesda our for their mishandling of this entire situation, his case just exemplifies how clunky and hamfisted their responses are to any problem they come across. I love this game and want it to get better, and giving the devs a free pass when they slip up doesn’t get us anywhere towards a better game.
---
I got the the plans for the BOS combat armor arms mod for completing "forbidden knowledge". It was on the 2nd or 3rd time I did that one. I do it anytime I can. I've got a full set of vanguard combat armour ready for BOSing.
---
I bought mine there on a couple of days ago. It seemed like they were there for days in a row and then when I went to buy them... alas they were not. Eventually I saw them again.
---
It's not the same tho. People with mass nuka quantums or bobbleheads are permabanned, not suspended like 900 hours guy. 
---
Same, it could have been an easy add in close to Seneca rocks. Even if it was only a small waterfall with a mirelurk swarm or something!
---
Looks like he released a partial functionality version but will release a fully functional version soon. I'm just glad someone is doing this because playing without it has been a headache.
---
This is why good games have real patch notes
---
I think you're brilliant for framing this as a change that could be both enjoyed by players and lucrative for Bethesda. And, you're right!
---
Well done sir.
---
is a work injury really a good reason to be playing close to 10 hours every day for months?
---
i find the whole situation completely asinine.   i myself am not a min / max'er.  i play one account at a time.  i do not mule or carry huge amounts of item in any of my inventories.  i try to play the game as it was intended by Beth, i think, not a mind reader.
---
but what is happening to people like glorf is just beyond stupid.  a few nights ago, i sat alone in a server, with the converted ammo dump, for like 10 hours.  made in the neighborhood of 3000 rnds of ammo.  what if i were to do this 10 days in a row?  do i bet banned for that?
---
beth has done every thing in their power to "scare off" players.  no wonder i sit in empty servers.  people are afraid to do any thing, so they go else where..... ie anthem.
---
shit, i was a little trepidacious last night.  i did the uranium event.  after it was over, i sorta had to mule a bit, had 850lbs of stuff i collected after the event.  went to that weapons bench at the doorway to the event and started spamming the scrap button.  i kept thinking, watch, i am going to crash the server and get a ban for it!  lmfao!

---
That’s the email that was sent, please look at the top and add the two ultracite rounds up it’s about 360k, you’re just trolling I’m not gonna argue if you can’t even get your facts straight.
---
Early on don't worry about repairing your stuff. When it breaks just pickup a new one from a dead enemy. Don't waste resources repairing until you start using legendaries. You're going to want to hoard Springs, Screws, Adhesive, Aluminum and Ballistic Fiber.
---
Someone should have revived you. Did you wait long enough? If not, that's on you.
---
The floor is built.
---
The ground is not built.
---
It’s easy when you’re not freaking out.
---
That's one of the reason my camp is where it's at. It's only 1 cap to travel to Harper's Ferry. 
---
Anyone else also notice a glitch where if you put one fusion core into PA it can sometimes show multiple but only uses one? It isn't game breaking to me, just annoying.
---
Im sorry i dont end up in the lobbies you do i guess, because no, no one revived me. As ive said, they were literally ataring at the sky. Im not exaggerating.
---
Jesus 5 minutes? I've only done it twice each taking me half an hour
---
This! In fact. I'd love a larger CAMP budget and team CAMP combining, butbifni had to choose of take the latter. And I'm a lone wanderer most of the time. This is one of those things that could change that.
---
They'll get bored of a dedicated server where they can't troll and go back to the pacifist server for entertainment.
---
Sure, I get that.
---
But if Glorf didn’t actually dupe, it’s also not the same. If he took donations and spent his stash weight and time banking communal ammo for the clan that he and his buddies made to really immerse themselves in this game and didn’t exploit, its not the same either.
---
One guy duped and got banned, another guy tried play the game in a communal way and got suspended, not to mentioned got his name dragged through he mud by this sub.
---
WS, Watoga, cities and stuff like that 
---
Honestly even if they put the new damage scaling in the patch notes it wouldn't have covered how it broke and had to be reapplied, that seems to be unintended.
---
BUT yeah, I wish the nerfs were actually in the notes instead of waiting to find them in the (spectacular) community patch notes.
---
In many ways, it I same map, but new vegetation (like a lot) make it feel different.
---
I'm playing on Normal (I feel challenged but I like the achievement). I like it.
---
Weapons are tiered.
---
Main enemy raiders can survive some headshots due to helmets so you need the better gun if want a kill shot.
---
You don't buy guns you trade materials for them or build them.
---
Main item to collect is ethanol (control strongholds to gather some, as well as finding supply drops).
---
You can upgrade your base if you have enough ethanol. Upgrading Workshop to make better weapons. Upgrade garage to make better vehicles. Etc.
---
It is cool seeing old places that are unused or used for a new purpose.
---
So far, the borders of map are full of deadly radiation (maybe it will clear when I get through main story, but I'd been having fun taking over strongholds or gathering treasure places).
---
I like some of new weapons you can make like Buzzsaw crossbow (a stealth weapon that shoots ricochet buzzsaws). Once you make a weapon, you don't have to respend stuff to equip it again luckily at a base. 
---
This happen to me in the beta. Some guy starts shooting us. I just kill him over and over again and rack up over 100 caps. People amirite.
---
They look sweet. Now lets get to the big boys, War and Black lol
---
lol, yeah, i learned the hard way about BPRs.  bought the damn plan to build and scrap to get the mods.........doh!
---
have not used or seen the dragon, so......no comment.
---
I judge my youtubers by how soothing I find their voices. I don’t watch videos and just listen to the audio of YouTube stuff. It just so happens that all the content creators who make shit filler content by bandwagoning down the same path have jarringly annoying voices, so thankfully I never feel the inclination to click on their bullocks.
---
Serendipity isn't supposed to, but there's a bug that activates it occasionally. Adamantium skeleton isn't necessary because you don't take limb damage the same way as without.
---
Serendipity does not, it’s in the list of bugs by aten_ra I believe. And the misunderstood perks thread. 
---
Adamantium doesn’t apply because power armor already provides that, I believe. 
---
If you kill animals, you should pick up meat and cook it. Good for meals, picking up xp early on, and can sell to vendors for caps. 
---
Fusion cores weigh a lot and are not as rare or profitable as they are in fallout 4. 
---
Invest in gladiator or melee perks early. Can do a good bit of damage without wasting caps. 
---
No need for adamantium in PA my friend . PA gives the same effect as for serendipity i read many times people saying it does not work. 
---
No concrete numbers out there as of rn I believe but seen estimates between 30% to 50% as the max damage bonus. Don't remember if it goes in 5's. Sorry wish I had more info :)
---
Hey man for what it’s worth, I posted a similar topic as you and all I got was positive feedback and what was clearly a community that was passionate about fallout!
---
If I were you I’d definitely get the game, it’s very rare to have such a supportive community who simply just enjoy the game and share there knowledge!
---
Now I can’t tell you anything about the gameplay; since I’m still waiting for it to download so I can play, but from speculation and a small taste of the support and knowledge this community offered me, you won’t be sorry to make friends and do things with them in this online game, which for me is where all the fun is!
---
It was a couple of patches ago yes. 
---
Follow the quest line and take time to read and listen to holotapes. That why you learn the story of what happened. Otherwise you may find it very mind numbing traveling the wasteland in the beginning.
---
&gt; Some people want to earn their items.
---
Those damn Greyjoys always have to pay the iron price.
---
Bummer, but thank you all the same! 
---
I finished the quest and now I can craft it. Can’t you ?
---
Sell the game
---
Well he had all our support when he first came up with his story. He had like 11k upvotes remember? You question him, you get downvoted to oblivion. And then he decided post the very screenshot that dragged him down to hell
---
How do people get tags lie the enclave one kuso has? Just wanted to know.
---
You can make ultrcite rounds at munitions workshop?
---
You should try census violence next to the power box just north of Watoga. It's all Deathclaws always. Good fun.
---
what is REALLy sad is how much light boxes, neon lights / signs cost for budget.  i too love building CAMPs, and i like have lots of lights, but the are almost as expensive as turrets in the budget.
---
this alone took up about 1/5 of my budget......
---
[https://ibb.co/T2mwTRw](https://ibb.co/T2mwTRw)
---
nice design
---
5% per shot capped at 50%
---
Another stacking damage perk, yeah good idea and it's only downside is, it's easy to maintain.  You sir should do balance for FO76, you'll fit right in.
---
Hey Bethesda, add a disclaimer to mutations that says - mutate at your own risk, things may go unstable or mutate further unpredictably regardless of your particular genes 🖤
---
Ok so 360k rounds. Still not addressing my second part about why everyone else that trades hasn't been banned.
---
They aren’t hard to kill. They’re annoying to kill. The rounds I expend killing a beastie aren’t worth the loot they drop. And while they can’t do much damage to me personally because fireproof, they devastate my poor armor. They’re much more pleasant to fight now after the patch though.
---
Isn't Big Foot from further west? I wouldn't be apposed to it though, it would make a cool addition to the line up.
---
I just want to name power armor so I can tell which set is which
---
Yep, I remember. I don’t think he expected it to work out like it did. That screenshot and the “acquired” ammo numbers still don’t make sense to him.
---
He still says he never duped and he’s willing go public with all his account details. He says the calculations must be including transactions that any player wouldn’t count, such as dropping and picking back up or trading to alts adding to the totals.
---
Most members of this sub still think that he had that much ammo on his characters or in his stash, which may be a huge lesson on how misinformation can become truth when it’s simpler than the real explanation. It’s easier to look at the list of ammo and think he had that much on him than read the “acquired over 30 days” details.
---
I like this better than the pig post. That one was...interesting. This is more practical. In both cases, nice work.
---
I think this is a QoL upgrade that is sorely needed.  However, I would rather see developer hours spent on fixing loot issues, mutation bugs, weapon balance, bugged gear, and broken quests.  
---
Fix what we got, then work on QoL
---
Tinker's workshop is a huge help for you, it's a very useful plan that lets you make armor.  The fact that you got it before you knew what it was means that guy helped you out big time.
---
Hahahaha damn the hits keep coming
---
This is great! Which platform? If Xbox, I'd love to visit for photos.
---
It sucks don’t buy, it gets boring after a couple weeks
---
all armor above lvl 25 i think it is now anyhoo you might wanna pick up perk card in agility called white knight will half the ballistic u need when reparing armor if u max it out
---
[Ahem](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/44560/)
---
Don't make pronouncements when you don't know what you're talking about. Wasn't that the point of this thread in the first place?
---
I have too. They were working out nicely then it seems like they are crap. There was a gulper eating my damn turret and it wasn't attacking it.  Now I have wire going down to... nothing. Not even a repair everything on the C.A.M.P. has made it come back. I am tempted to move my camp so I can clean up the two missing turrets I have. 
---
nice post , I agree with you on several points . have a upvote .
---
Thanks! :)
---
But it's PC!
---
Im not too sure on that to be honest. I have gotten one TSE to drop for me ever, and I have just as hard a time getting rare outfits from events it seems.
---
Full looting, repairing should cause a permanent max durability loss each time so items are only good for x amount of repairs.
---
Thank you. Just wanted to make a good game even better. \^_\^
---
I'm thinking he was looking for a way out and thought that wording "acquired" would save his arse. Whether it be true or not, it's causing mass confusion among players and people are afraid to trade or even drop their ammo I mean what a shithole this subreddit's become because of a single banned user. FFS enough is enough
---
I've got a bloodied Fat Man, Wrecking Ball and all other relevant perks maxed, and think you and I could get along very well Haha. Damn those CAMPs.
---
Agreed. West Virginia is a beautiful state. Used to live a stones throw from Harper’s Ferry. 
---
I did 2 sbq last night and after at least 40 sbq in past months that was *** both of them was just crowned, loot was poor, i was under impression she will always be a 3 star
---
From what I remember Bigfoot variations are from all over the continental United States. Different regions have different names for them and they all apparently have slight differences. Bigfoot, Stonish Giant, Sheepsquatch, Swamp Ape, Mogollon Monster, and the Ohio Grassman are just a few I can name off the top of my head.
---
Heck, part of what got me excited about fo76 was a stupid show called "Mountain Monsters" where some hillybillys "hunt" down various monsters (80% bigfoot variations) in West Virginia.  It's such a bad show that it's good.
---
That’s why I didn’t list it as one: it’s just stupid that repeats are even a thing in the card pack system. It’s upsetting to get a repeat card after working 5 levels for the card pack.
---
Oh... that is so awful. It gets my up vote.
---
They should really add them and others if they can make the story work. We really need some more boss mobs other than then the SBQ.
---
That must be infuriating 
---
Thank you for explaining this. I'm level ~280 and still didn't know exactly how it worked until your post!
---
1 = critical fail.  your character is burned at the stake.......... AND ITS GONE!!!!
---
Well if it isn’t inert yet, you could sell it for a few good caps. 
---
Im from southern ohio about an hour north of WV and bigfoot is a big thing around here. It's one of appalachias main zoological legends. For some reason there are a ton more that are specific to WV though.
---
I love it when someone calls someone out for lack of research and then get's called out on it themselves. It's like that bar scene in Good Will Hunting.
---
i contacted the Bethesda and they provide me some troubleshooting guide.

Man this sub’s been going down hill since TSE nerf patch, but honestly I think it’s because week after week Bethesda proves they don’t care enough about his game to test their own patches for game breaking bugs and doesn’t care enough about the community to be honest and upfront with the unannounced balance changes they continue to sneak into every update.
---
Was such a fan of the game but I’ve really got to take a break. Playing this since beta has been emotionally exhausting. I keep hoping it’ll get better with each patch but they break something and stealth shit into the updates...and I think the toxicity in the sub is directly tied to the community’s shared feeling that Beth either doesn’t care enough or isn’t capable of following through.
---
neg
---
So no apologies about making stuff up? It’s all good I’ll do all the research for you and let you continue to troll.  
---
I doubt many traders deal in that mass quantities of ultracite ammo for one thing. Also to be frank Bethesda definitely didn’t use a fine tooth comb for these bans, usually if they found someone that duped and you were on their friends list then  they went into the account and if they saw 100k of a “rare” item, bam! Suspension. 
---
That’s a terrible way to do it and also means they didn’t catch all the people out there with 90k nuka cola, those are the people you should really want suspended imo. 
---
The reason you want ultracite ammo to trade is because a lot of endgame players are maxed on caps and won’t sell an item but rather trade for something they need. Due to the sponginess of the queen, ultracite ammo is always in demand. 
---
ok..
---
**Update:** I just went into the command center and noticed there are multiple letters on the wall for silo alpha. I was able to use NukaCrypt, the various tutorials, and talking to /u/Waffle_cop to create my own spreadsheet which works out the code manually and confirmed it. Fun!
---
Did you save any points for later? It can be the reason, only used points count towards unlocking cards. In example if you are lvl 50 with and you didn't spend your last 10 lvl ups only perks up to lvl 40 will be unlocked.
---
I work my ass off for my scrap. It so pisses me off when I crash right after setup and 1st defend event. Didn't even get to collect 1 round of scrap! 
---
Ahahaha that's cool. The Curse of Oak Island is my guilty pleasure when it comes to bad reality TV. 
---
You don't get it every time.  There is _a chance_ of disease if it's on the ground.  
---
I really like the front porch. Mine has one, but no fences. I like the barn walls as well.
---
I've been soloing them since just before level 50. Hit 176 today. It was easy before the TSE nerf.
---
These days I switch between my heavy gun loadout and bloodied/adrenal melee loadout, though I'm leaning more and more toward doing these runs fully melee, and without PA. There are a couple of turrets that you have to jump to smash, but you end up having a lot less to repair and replace after.  The only place I bother clearing all turrets is the initial entry area (3 turrets in the hallway, 2 in the room with the ID card registration terminal), the reactor room - to minimize hassle while repairing pipes, and the launch control room - to protect the launch officers. I leave the turrets in the first long hallway, the turret by the control room door, some of the other turrets that you can rush by and never have to see again. It gets a lot easier after you start remembering where most of the laser turrets are. You can usually enter a room, take out the nearest turret, and get to cover while you line up on the next turret, or the nearest bot.
---
All that said, this past week, I've been getting hordes of bots spawning in the final room of the silo. Not sure what changed. This was even pre-patch. Totally solo, doing solo runs while on a team, and doing the silo with another person, all spawned an unexpected number of bots.
---
On the flip side, sometimes all the turrets are already destroyed. One time all bots and turrets were dead - cakewalked that one.
---
Breaking news update.  Friend and condoner-of-cheating **JekPorkinRed6** angered at learning that the World hates cheaters. Wishes he could cheat via proxy without being judged. Slams down "virtue gauntlet" while channeling his inner Sammy Sosa. What happens next? The world watches and waits in terror.
---
Feels like your first sentence is making the opposite point of the other two ...
---
Beautiful hikes in that area and becoming more and more popular for those leaving the DMV area but still wanting to stay relatively close to DC
---
Wear PA :) 
---
&gt; As my final act of charity, I like to jump to the overseers camp and drop off a few plans for the next lucky person to collect. 
---
I like this idea but I'm always worried that the server instance will go down before anyone finds them. What ends up happening is that I hoard them in hopes of finding someone to give them to, but when I look I don't see any.
---
I didnt even know there was a passive mode until I saw it mentioned here earlier today. 
---
Hey man, are you still selling serums?
---
Ive seen a bunch of mothmans outside my cabin
---
No matter what i still love it. Bugged or not.
---
*What do you think about that, Mr. C.A.M.P. Duck?!*
---
# That's Quack-tastic!
---
If you have the stash space, keep it for a while, it will become useful. But like Nathan_TK says, it sells pretty well.
---
Save the stimpaks and just be OK with dying. Either carry no junk, or just pick it up after you spawn. Of the couple hundred nuke runs I've done, only once did a random stranger show up while I was in the silo - a wall breach jag. Generally, you don't have to worry about losing your junk.
---
Definitely easiest way
---
Lmao I love it! 
---
At this point, I think any cryptid could easily work into the narrative here. Put some giant river dragon in, I'd still fight it.  But I do agree it needs more endgame variety. Which is why a big hulking bigfoot could be AWESOME
---
Whitespring inside main building especially
---
Ohhh I heard of that. gotta watch it sometime
---
I wish 
---
West Virginia is just a weird place apparently.  Most of what I know about WV cryptids comes from bad TV shows though
---
Yeah, no. Speak for yourself.
---
I got frustrated with my husband and I not being able to sleep in a bed together, so I figured out how to construct my own double bed using twin sleeping bags and other furniture pieces.
---
Way better looking than those rediculously tiny beds Beth has been selling, and fits two.
---
Keep the sleeping bags coming, Bethesda.
---
Sorry, I play with subtitles and when they make noises it says stuff like that in the text
---
Perk 2 handed melee
---
it is a LOT better than it was.  i can now run 3, 4, even 5 WS at once.  i play during off hours, so that may be a difference here.  i sat on the converted munitions dump for about 10hrs a few nights ago.
---
but yeah, they REALLY need to fix it so you can return to the same server.
---
\+1
---
You doubt many trade in that amount but you said earlier how easy it would be to get that amount.  Your not being consistent with your own argument. 
---
Good time to goin. Mothmen are everywhere dropping ballistic fiber. 
---
You can also get a fair amount at various military bases. 
---
I only use ballistic to repair legendary items. For any other, just build new armor or gra something off a corpse. 
---
Legendary armor is common. Currently carrying arounf half a dozen good level 45 and 50 pieces, trying to give them away. 
---
Im sure you've watched the same show ive watched 🤣 a bunch of goofballs trying to catch them with wacky ass home alone traps? Haha but ya WV is a world of its own for sure.
---
A question tho. If trading or picking up items is what's causing your accounts to be flagged, what happens if you picked up 5 million ammo say like 2 months ago and never traded since then? And what happens if I drop and pick up my 6k 50cal for like, thirty times? do I get a suspension?
---
Nice write up and great to see you helping people! We were doing the same thing with veterans.   
---
We have a group of veterans, disabled vets and a few active duty in our group (about 55+ now). I like many others have more than 1 character, my 2nd got overweight fast! So that character just went around farming everything under the sun, you name it it was picked up.   
---
That one was overweight for sure well beyond the normal limit so much so that it couldn't even craft anything after the patches. How overweight? about 4-5k total.   
---
My main was 200-/+ with 500+ in he stash, I have 1 star 10mm (30% robot one) and a 1 star combat shotgun quad capacity and one piece of 1 star armor, nothing great at all by any means.   
---
Played Saturday night and had the login failure on Sunday morning.   
---
I received like many others the email late Tuesday saying I had 100,000k in rare items... I don't think I had 100,000 of anything and everything let alone rare items.   
---
Again my other character was overweight and yes I picked up everything, again mostly just or stuff people dropped at WS (not junk, I respect deaths and players coming back to get their stuff) but stuff people drop.   
---
If I picked up stuff that was duped, then tell me and take it away, like they did to actual dupers or players that got to keep their TSE weapons, must be nice to have a weapon that is actually a RARE drop.  
---
I hope they fix or at least tell players what they did instead of the same general letter that literally everyone got. 
---
When I get bored of running around, and have too many chems, I go to Flatwoods put on a Asylum worker outfit and hat (usually pink) and hand out Stimpaks, Rad-X, and Radaway. I usually offer ammo in smaller chunks that I have that I don't use like .308, .38, and .44. 
---
I sometimes give out weapons too, but most of the items I get are lvl 45-50 and useless to someone that low level. 
---
It does make me feel good inside to play "nurse".
---
shame.....SHAME!!!!  building on the golf course!!! ha ha ha!!
---
300 caps ? Lmk 
---
Lol The place I keep my camp is totally a place I would put it in real life 😁👍
---
Can do, whats your name on PS4? 
---
I feel you man. I'm getting a little fed up as well but I'm thinking it's this subreddit rather than the game itself. Heck I feel that I've become bit toxic myself.
---
Shit I’m trying to get rich to give you high level guys some caps for the help you give. I feel so grateful yet douchey when a player helps me and I have nothing in return
---
Jesus Fucking Christ they've already announced that they're starting content patches next month, which at this rate might even make it before the PvP servers, and you STILL open up with a smart ass remark about how they're obviously covering for having nothing else planned?
---
You want a perfect 100% pacifist?  Congratulations, you've just created God Mode on command.  Fuck around with anyone you want to that does have PvP enabled and if things start to go bad for you?  Toggle on your invulnerability and then you can dance in their face with nothing they can do.  Then when they've gone back to whatever they were doing?  Turn it right back off and fuck with them again.  
---
Great job.
---
Mountain Monsters? OMG that show is a RIOT. I love it.  My dream would be to wander around Appalchia as Buck tryna kill cryptids
---
Even a lvl 50 Perfect Storm is not that great. 30 rounds vs. Vampire 3 star legendary minigun with 500. 
---
I would rather be helpful than mean.
---
Yes. So much yes. Spending a lot of time on your permanent home makes you feel like you can never move it, lest you run into "cannot place floating object" or something when you try to redeploy it from the stored blueprint.
---
C.A.M.P. aka "Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform"
---
B.A.S.E. aka "Building Another Society Engine"
---
Make it so your CAMP has a lower budget, and your BASE has a higher cost to move it. Maybe your CAMP can't have defenses or locks, but also can't be damaged (and therefore raided)?
---
What's wrong with that?! The Robots keep me safe! D:
---
How many screws do you need? 
---
Nice work. 
---
hmmmm no Psychotats?  makes me wonder if it is even obtainable from a vendor.
---
huh. that's.. interesting
---
Well you were very vague with your question.. “Why hasn’t everyone else that trades been banned?” (Paraphrased)
---
I pointed out that it’s not a huge percentage of the player base that trades in these amounts and thus a lot of people that “trade” haven’t been banned. Next time be more specific in your wording. Pretty much everyone in this game trades in one way or another just not on that scale. 
---
Seems to me you’re not willing to believe in false positives when it comes to these suspensions, that’s fine but it also means you’re not seeing the situation clearly imo. I can tell you all the ways you can get this ammo, how easy it would be when you play 10+ hours a day, but I don’t think you’re willing to open your mind to that possibility so I won’t waste my time. 
---
It is a hoot. A bunch of goonies with all the knowledge on how to catch them, with sheer bad luck. Bad thing is they're making more money than me and im sure they're having fun doing it haha
---
Yeah, server crashes blow. What worse is that they're unpredictable.
---
I gave up on farming fusion cores from power plants. i don't know what level you are, but you can test your combat skills as well as farm FCs if you take out sentry bots at the whitesprings. your can earn about 3-4 within 15 mins but have to server-hop if you need more afterwards
---
Have it to where we stumble across some holotapes about the stories of a bigfoot hunter team. After learning some details an event starts where we have to track one down. Kind of like the hoard events but much harder. 
---
I like that idea. Makes the person who pays just a tad more attention to their surroundings get a bonus prize.
---
My wife and I agreed I get 2 games a year. We live by a strict budget. I’m a huge fan of Fallout going back to the original crpg and BSG to Daggerfall, and didn’t mind paying full price direct to the company to support the them. While saving some cash is nice, the I was more than happy to consider the full retail price a kind of tip or vote in support out of faith in the studio.
---
Faith which was very much misplaced in retrospect. I was absolutely astounded and it honestly took me a week or two to accept the reality d how prematurely the game was released. BSG was never perfect, but they were a great studio, once and maybe I was foolish, but I never believed they would have put out something in this state.
---
I was with a huge team last night that couldn't kill her. Lots of others saying the queen is bugged. 
---
This is an irrelevant mod?... way to go...
---
It might flag it if it’s ultracite ammo, are you talking about ultracite ammo? 
---
The suspensions were only for “rare” items not normal ammo
---
Gotta say I love getting baggies of drugs! Berry/grape mentats, day tripper, psycobuff, xcell and maybe some buffout or whiskey for when I'm fat and can't fast travel :)
---
Or worse still...forgetting to clear out the vendors 200 before buying!
---
Read the description. Read it carefully. Read what it does and why it was made.
---
Ah. Gotcha
---
Yeah she was bugged when I did her before update.  She took lots of damage then out of nowhere none.  Read up a bit and threw on some AA perks.  Going thru silo solo now to put up a nuke .... I'm determined tonight.
---
yep!!! i was going to engage him but when i seen him take out a 3 +100 players and then they kinda all scattered I'm like something seems up.   i mean he could of just been really good but my guts telling me something else was going on.   before i logged he had 1375 cap bounty.    the other thing that got me was there was a group of 3 level 9's just exploring and he just comes down and swings his dick around and kills 3 level 9's and then proceeds on his way.
---
Nah. I’ll keep holding their feet to the fire and calling them out until the game is in a finished state or refund it - the right thing one way or another.
---
Yeah. I won’t be buying a BSG game again at all and I only ever bought early to support two studios: Firaxis and BSG because I’ve been a fanboy of both for a long, long time.
---
Is that duck poo behind it?
---
I was leaving completely pimped out PA at White Springs. People seemed to avoid it. Perhaps they thought it was duped or something. In my case, it seems I am always finding mods for PA. So I save enough to make a pimped set like T-60 with reactive plates, bright head lamp, etc. I even posted that I was going to login and go to WS and asked if anyone wanted it on reddit. Nothing... crickets. 
---
I dropped it off at 14:00 or so and then picked it back up from WS at about 18:00 since no one picked it up. I was shocked.
---
Don't be an ass, this was a smart move on their part.  They'd priced all of the plans on the idea that people wouldn't be able to go out and instantly buy any one they wanted, that scarcity is what helps create an economy where the people who can find the plans sell to those who haven't found them.  Now that you can just walk up and buy essentially any plan you want they needed to find an alternative way of promoting player trading and that's by making the plans expensive enough that some people would rather just buy the crafted mod from someone else instead.
---
&gt;no, i'm not salty at all
---
Sure.  Which is why you got the entire stance I took wrong.  So if you aren't salty, them you're a fucking moron.  But ya know.  Ya got me, so you have that little win going for you I guess.
---
I meant just a break in general internet tough guy.  You are angry for no reason.  Go get a hug from someone you love or talk to someone.
---
Hell, talk to me if it will keep you from make egregious accusations after reading a line or two of a post.
---
Usually the help we offer costs us nothing. Maybe a few steel or ballistic fiber. Or legendary gear we would otherwise drop for nobody.
---
I would love to have it extended but I an see why they have the limit there and that is that the engine the game is built on struggles to handle larger settlements, or more built objects in an area, factor in the 24 players + the 20 workshops into the map, adding 50% would effectively have 32 players on a map if everyone maxxed their budgets out which might then put too much strain on the already touchy servers. So people would see more lag and disconnects
---
Didn't the screenshot include normal ammo tho?
---
Yeah man I did. I’m gonna stop responding now if you’re just gonna present evidence for your childish joke of a claim that is in no way evidence to support your childish joke of a claim. Just because they didn’t do what this mod author went out of his way to do in no way means they couldn’t.
---
my sniper build.  did not bother with any stealth, as it seems bugged ATM.
---
[https://ibb.co/4FvNnFp](https://ibb.co/4FvNnFp)
---
You aren't the only one curious about this. Did you ever test it? I am not at the point in game to be able to make the canisters. 
---
The dropping dead has been happening before last patch. You can even hear them die at times when spawning in. The regenerating has been back (or more noticeable) since last patch. You can notice it especially with stealth automatic builds.
---
They are adding vendors in the future, although the exact mechanics are unclear at the moment.
---
I had Charleston junk yard And hemlock for like 6 hours straight. This all in a full server with a nuke at whitesprings. 
---
Thanks and yes. I think I won't play it anymore even if Banthesda realizes their mistake. I had fun with FO76 because the community was cool and I could live with all those bugs. I wish they fixed duping but instead it seems they just ban via a bad-written script and call the decision final.      
---
      
---
I don't think Bethesda will ever give me actual numbers on my ban because it would proof how they fucked up. Same for ALL accounts which were just some % over limit. Most likely those are all legit accounts but if they lift the ban for one they had to investigate all tickets.       
---
       
---
I asked my lawyer and he gave me hope that Bethesda may has to pay damages (atom-purchases refunded &amp; for wasted playtime [I'm german and such cases are possible here]). I think I'm going to sue. I never was banned in any game because I never cheated. Still Banthesda treated me like one and took nearly 1100 hours of progress. This is not acceptable.
---
I would prefer the entirely seperate servers, it would be a real pain in the ass for people who want to PvP to finally find someone, go to engage in PvP then nope, cant, especially if it turns out that every other player is currently pacifist so you try to PvP in a world where you are the only PvPer there
---
Has anyone ever played warframe?
---
Put gameplay aside.. they had some microtransactions i could not resist. 
---
For those who havent played. They sold color palettes.  Let you apply them to your armor after you buy a palette.  A series of reds/crimsons $1.00 beighe and earth tones $1.00 Blues and whites $1.00
---
On holidays they would give out free pallets so everyone would log in and claim them. Pinks for valentines, orange and blacks on halloween etc. 
---
For those who played it.. Who didnt spend a few bucks on color pallets?!
---
Example: https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Color_Picker_Extension
---
It's alienated everyone who Bethesda deemed guilty, and the mods and many in this sub have decided Bethesda's word is law. Disregarding the track record they've had so far. It's costing this sub and the game players who feel like even if they got their accounts back, they wouldn't bother returning anyway if this is how they'll be treated. Can't really blame them for feeling that way. But some will blame them anyway. Mods sure will.
---
I don't really see how that would make pvp servers unnecessary?
---
Yeah but that was Bethesda’s attempt at being transparent, the 900 hours guy asked for all his inventory to be shown. BGS sent that email stating it was  having too much “rare” ammo(ultracite) that got him suspended. You’re fine don’t worry I have a ton of normal ammo because one of my characters is sitting on a lead farm 
---
Yes, perfect.  A tent, bare bones crafting and a bed.  
---
Paint me like one of your French ghouls Jack.
---
I have a few left. However I got the ban the other day so here I wait. 
---
&gt; Just because they didn’t do what this mod author went out of his way to do in no way means they couldn’t.
---
Except J.E. Sawyer, lead dev for New Vegas, literally said it was impossible. You are bad at reading.
---
Hurt now, are we? Boo hoo. 
---
Pretty sure Bethesda at one time said there will be personal vending machines in camps like the ones that sell ammo and medical supplies outside most train stations. Was originally supposed to be in February, but got pushed back. 
---
Jug is THE best builder fallout 4 or 76 has ever seen.  Others such as myself try and compare, but do not.
---
I can just imagine putting a reasonable price you'll buy some scrap at your vendor and out of nowhere boom some guy gets all your caps lol
---
I did the same when i was leveling up but realized pretty quickly that you find much better drops then what most of the quests gives you. I do agree better to do them at lvl 50 though
---
Your Adrenal is bugged. Reapply it.
---
And until they can get a lid on duping.
---
That is awesome. I love how they all seem either scared, or pull guns on you. Like a lvl 9 guy is going to do any damage, or they jump servers and leave you floating.
---
sent request
---
A legendary bloatfly?  Maybe one that is ill-tempered?
---
That really sucks. You don't have to let it happen. If you look for a group of players or 1/2 high level players they might help you. Some people are looking for action or are using a second character. So probably geared well and hopefully knows the tricks around pvp gear gimmicks. You would be surprised by how nice others might be.
---
But you get the point right? I seriously doubt I'll ever get in trouble for doing that even with ultracite ammo. Where did this 'moving items back and forth will get you in trouble' come from? From the mouth of a banned user. Does he have any proof to back his imagination? Never heard about it 
---
Bought Heavy Combat Arms at Watoga Station today for 980.
---
i saw him last night out in the swamps near abby's bunker.  took him out with my 5.56 explosive handmade.
---
Yeah...pretty much.
---
I'm not sure I understand Sly, if that's not the point.  
---
If you build 0 defense under his proposed plan...it shouldn't have an effect on your other budget, and vice versa.
---
I did that wise mothman event, and he was pretty chill. Never been to the mothman statue in point pleasant, and ended going there tonight. Never saw him once, UNTIL, I took his eggs and ate them. 20 minutes later I’m fighting a Behemoth, and as soon as I kill it, I get jump by a lvl 45 vengeful mothman. Guess he didn’t like me eating his kids. 
---
Holy shit I think I actually ran into your base in game while it was still in its early build.... I remember thinking “wtf? There’s no doors to this base... who builds a base with no doors?!?!? HOW DO STOP THAT DAMN ENEMY ALERT SIREN IF THERE NO DOORS TO GET TO IT?!?!?!?” 
---
It was impossible based on the time they had/money. Nothing is impossible because of an engine. You don’t even understand what an engine is. Clearly. You just build functionality on top of the engines existing bits. Sawyer either spoke imprecisely or said something flat out false. He may also have had limits to what they were allowed to mess with from Bethesda. A guy finding an honestly not very wild work around for something is again not a basis to believe “bETheSdA BaD”.
---
Sure it was £100 but it was all loose change...
---
Rule number 3
---
Last 3* I killed I got a furious explosive lmg. Normally I'd agree. But it seems Mothman hath blessed this vault dweller today
---
If we could trade unwanted cards, that would be pretty cool
---
They are found in the world at BoS in the south east map area. I found several BoS related plans (including combat armor) at locations that look like bunkers on the map, and are labled as "drop sites". The bunkers are badly damaged and irradiated, the plans can be hard to see at a glance (on shelves and stuff). They also sometimes trigger a legendary enemy spawn when you loot it.
---
It's rare though, guess it depends if someone else looted it on that server. You could try server hopping. 
---
Try the reactive plates power armor torso mod brother it reflects 50% of melee damage back on the attacker.
---
The problem is they can’t access their accounts to prove anything lol, makes it kinda hard.
---
Tremendous post. Not so tremendous that this is actually a real service we need in the game. 
---
They said that but didn't give detail about what that meant. Is your player going to be the vendor? Will vendor sites for players be established somewhere outside of CAMPs?  Will vendors buy and sell or just sell? Beth needs to be forthcoming with us.
---
I’d love to see hammocks 
---
Combat shotgun plans are on watoga vendor in super duper mart.
---
Well, the Pip-Boy tooltip for all mutations have been buggy AF for a long time, but the actual effects used to be consistent. It sounds like in your case, wiping and readding mutations got your adrenal reaction back to working “normally”. Good to know. 
---
LMG is a curse. trust me. say goodbye to all your steel and lead
---
you sure? I never get bonus damage on my rifles and I always repair them to 200% every time they dip below 100%...
---
Sleeping bags have a shorter xp buff duration compared to elevated beds. 
---
I never thought of that !! Great idea !! Remember in fallout 4 the swamp area of Jamaica plains the sentry bot always dropped two full fusion cores regularly !!! 
---
sorry, but ALL my weapons broke.  i forgot to bring extra fusion cores.  and ran out of stims.  was using soup to heal myself!  died 3 times to SBQ's minions, so i went and hid in the bunker till it was all over.  pc.  level 61.
---
Set a limit on the amount of each item you'd buy. 
---
I don't mind farming for lead and steel I have a decent spot I can get around 600 of both per visit. Which with super duper nets me around 2000 rounds.
---
space. +1
---
Best ep was when Huckleberry was out naked in the middle of the night lol
---
Wait a minute before moving or opening pip boy it you can’t move for a minute cause everything loading up 
---
lul
---
That’s always sucks man!! I feel for you!
---
I would hold off for four horsemen
---
I've been waiting for 10 minutes
---
It's be funny though wtf happened to all my caps? uhhh I'm not sure I wanted 15000 steel but okay
---
Got to get that space force huh 😂
---
Ok then nvm , that’s a oof 
---
I do the same, and when I do not find any low lvl to give stuff to I just go to voult 76 and drop the stuff there, hope I get to help a new vaultdueler 
---
rofl. No I just was lazy and didn't pick up my crops for the pics.
---
I know
---
As mentioned by another: Pay it forward, please. (Hearts are nice too...❤)
---
You're doing the lord's work.
---
Honestly I’m not following you? That’s exactly what he got in trouble for.. having “to much” ultracite ammo
---
It’s a theory he put out there because Bethesda has been very tight lipped about all this and not responded to tickets and questions. The thing is he can’t access his account to prove anything rn.
---
My point all along has been that acquiring this amount of ammo as someone who plays the game daily is really not that hard, so sorry if I’m misunderstanding you but yeah maybe some more casual people don’t understand the MMO grind but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.
---
Totally agree 100%!!i was  worried someone would find objection with the post they alway do!!lol!!

Last 10+ 3* legendaries I killed glitches and I did t get crap
---
Last one i killed, last night, fuckin' disappeared. I love this game, but sometimes it just knows when to make me put on Netflix.
---
I have no idea what that is or looks like but I'm excited just by the name of it. Any idea when that comes out
---
Well it's going to be a vendor you can build at your camp, that much we know. I cross my fingers for a robot, but it'll likely be a vending machine. And as I originally stated the details aren't really known yet.... And I don't understand why you want to know everything right away... Just relax and enjoy the ride. They'll tell us when the time is right.
---
The only thing that's suspicious here is you claiming there is no need to have that many items.  Who the fuck are you, the item police?  It's ammo bro.  Ammo.
---
It happens. You have to give it about 30 seconds after you load into a world before pulling up the PipBoy. Willing to bet you can pull up the map and fast travel, but can’t move either. 
---
But none of the vendors sell combat armor plans, right?
---
I second this ^^  
---
As you find out the history of what happened to all the factions, the map becomes a lot more fun/deeper to explore.
---
FO76 map and locations are far better than FO4s as long as you take the time to read terminals and notes, (you as player are pushing the narrative, not the NPCs around you like in the other games)
---
There are several guntypes in the game, once you find two that you like the most, start taking perks that enable extra damage for those guns (it'll make fighting bosses and killing lower level enemies less ammo consumptive) 
---
Keep a third weapon (recomend melee/unarmed) for when you run out of ammo for your favorite guns.
---
You on PS4 I’ll sell em 300 each 
---
I know how to code and I know it's hard, but when you have modders fixing the Bethesda games for free, there is no excuse
---
&gt; It was impossible based on the time they had/money.
---
No, he literally said it cannot be done, full stop. Specifically he said it's not possible to make a DLC perk affect items form another DLC without the first DLC being dependent on the second. That mod proves that it is wrong.
---
This has been a fascinating example of exactly what this entire thread was about.
---
I had a bunch of extra plans from defending workshops and whatnot. So I went looking for some low level players maybe to drop them and give them a boost on camp building. Saw a level two and just couldn’t get there attention. There was a level 13 on the map and I tried tracking down. He was hiding in stealth. I started doing the money emote trying to get his attention. Finally I found where he was crouched down. Dropped the bag of plans and he went and hid somewhere else. I started shooting the bag of plans. Doing the money emote again. Turned on the mic and said hey “free plans free plans over here”. He came over to the bag. I thought good I have a taker for these plans. He crouched at the bag for a while. Then thumbs down emote at me. Total disapproval of my free offerings. So I just went and left them in front of vault 76 and hoped somebody would snag them. 
---
yeah serum vendors are your best bet haha
---
But 900 hours guy said he never had much ammo to begin with and he claims those numbers on the screenshot was generated by trading his ammo back and forth with his muld account. You are not following the story here
---
Believe me it's worth it
---

Wait, unless it’s a turret farm, why not build at Whitespring?
---
It's no different than 4, most drops are shit, some are okay and occasionally you'll pull the left hand of God himself out of the body of a legendary mole rat. 
---
How many you need bro ? I can spare some 
---
why would you need a count down, you can get 400 caps everytime you logon, given that you have stuff to sell. get your 400 caps leave server come back in, it works like a charm for me. 
---
That method he had in mind in particular is literally impossible. Thus the mod author went in and fixed the problem by reworking things and tying them together in a different way. Certainly is a good example. Thanks for letting me show you off.
---
Yeah what’s your psn 
---
I agree. I have been a fireman, and sailor (soldier) my entire life. I do it because I love it, and the idea of helping other people makes me feel good. Perhaps it is selfish... I love the feeling I get when someone says "thank you", see a child smile, or feel like I have made someone's worst day just a little brighter.
---
I am totally in on a PvE server. As someone noted, it is stupid not have had it at the start, or make Pacifist mode make it so you can't hurt, **or be hurt** by other players.
---
I thought mods could lead to bans? The language was in one of the ban email screenshots that was circling around during the first ban wave a couple weeks ago
---
Yes how did u know
---
Haha. grats on your new weapon. had much fun with one myself
---
Lol
---
I’m done with this now. Goodbye.
---
Sent pm 
---
Thanks bud. It's certainly making me consider Respec into heavy weps. At level 196 that is a chore. 🤣
---
Banjo found a random supply drop. It had a quest notification and everything. So Banjo took the supply drop and now Banjo is bad? Banjo ran to the nearest town and ran around yelling “DO IT!JUST DO IT ALREADY!” Nice people helped Banjo right away.
---
This is wanted by everyone I play with. 
---
I bought heavy legs from Harper's the other day. I think it might be a leveled thing or rng because it was the first time I saw them.
---
1. LOL @ Posting a reasonable pvp focused post in this sub. 
---
2. Great points. Especially about the "defend" mechanic. Thats your turf. Get off my lawn!!! I dig it big time. Awesome idea. 
---
From the POV of a mic active roleplayer &amp; pvper:
---
Current setup is my dream for rolling on an owned workshop with a displayed owner sitting on it. Especially with a gang behind my back. (Anyone else hopping servers looking for these pvp active severs?) . 
---
*Wear greaser getup. Say something lame and snarky* Get up close. Hold Mouse3 to initiate combat and show as a red target. *make lame threat and shake them down for junk*  
---
Awwww yeeeaaah ive been having fun with the lame tunnel snake raider bit. I love that we can roll on a workshop owner then *blip* go red mid-conversation to reinforce the drama and allow them to strike first. 
---
Having the "run to the red table" mechanic as it was before isnt as fun as the new mechanic.  Especially when doing silly pvp-roleplay stuff like demanding taxes or accussing a workshop owner of being a communist. 
---
I can't remember the last time I made a Fallout character with hair. 
---
X-01 plans are free, in one of the computers in the Whitesprings bunker.
---
If you are focused on rifles handmade has the best damage for any high capacity AR type of gun.  It's better than combat rifle by a reasonable amount.  
---
Mind you to realize the maximum potential of any gun you need to learn the mods for it.  The "hardened" receiver is the best for pure damage., so comparing say a hardened combat rifle to a base handmade isn't a fair comparison.
---
&gt; Thus the mod author
---
You really didn't read things very well there, did you?
---
Wow you are literally disabled. I’m so sorry I really didn’t know.
---
It depends on your build.  Unless you are focused into non auto rifles, any rifle isn't that great.  
---
Main benefit of lever action is the ammo is abundant, and it's the 2nd best damage for a rifle next to Gauss but a LOT lighter and the ammo is also a lot lighter.    
---
But for pure alpha strike you will want a Gauss if you are using a rifle build and don't mind the extra weight.
---
You are right, it’s way too easy, and thus we have another reason to avoid workshops like the god damn plague. 
---

I carry 3 atm, t51b with jetpack and dual calibrated shocks, X01 with stealthboy mod and still looking for calibrated shocks, and excavator with dual calibrated shocks and +2 str chest. X01 is for nuke zones, t51b is normal play, and excavator is for overloaded so I can fast travel. I have a set of all power armors max level, and am slowly trying to get them all completed and Modded just because i want to. Missing 1 leg for T45 and 1 arm for raiders. T60 is modded but need the BoS paint so it looks Unique. My X01 has the vault tec paint, and my t51b has the nuka cola. 
---
Apparently they have a very low chance to spawn at any vendor
---
So I should just visit each vendor and hop if they arent there?
---
ya its not exactly how i want to fight over workshops, but coming up with new ideas like this while we wait for new content has been fun to me.  the faster we discover flaws in the current mechanics, the faster devs can fix them (i hope).
---
i agree, everytime I get a card pack is useless, I nerver get what I want and the stuff I do get is always the same variation of useless perk cards. 
---
Just remember "very low chance" could spawn one and then not see another for two weeks
---
I'll give it a shot.
---
Field surgeon can deal with lower dmg numbers easily. If he is high level his inventory is probably stacked with superstim from the queen. The have increased regen rate at first aswell. Plus you can sort of pre stim dmg.
---
Good luck if you find multiples I'll buy legs and arms
---
Sometimes it doesnt seems to work, i notice that when i reload my shotgun. Unless it another mutations negative effect that makes me slower again.. 
---
I wish there were playable lizard people like in skyrim
---
No I understand it very well, maybe I just didn’t articulate it. He claims he doesn’t actually have that much ammo on his account and that by trading it back and forth it could account for those totals. Who knows if that’s true or not because he can’t access the account to prove it. His point is that those numbers are skewed by the trading and don’t reflect the actual amount. Tbh I’m inclined to believe that’s the case and someone from BGS didn’t manually look at his account and rather it’s based off an algorithm. Again tough to prove without access to the account and without responses from BGS.
---
 
---
I see what you’re saying, “hmm seems fishy that the 900 hour guy claimed he didn’t have tons of ammo and yet look at the email proving otherwise”  
---
The thing is that’s not what he said, he said he’s never had over 100k of a rare in game item at one time. He still had close to that amount tho by his account, and it’s his belief that trading the items back and forth is what’s causing the discrepancy. 
---
It’s fine for you to doubt that, totally legitimate. My qualm is why is having 100k ultracite ammo taboo? Bethesda’s our of touch with their own game mechanics imo.
---
Well if it’s not a farm it’s fine in my book. But I’ve get to see any camps there that weren’t just turrets. 
---
Because it happens to me about 7/10 times I log in. 
---
are you needing thos still, I can give you a lvl 50, 
---
I beat 3 of them yesterday without issue, though. Sneaked up on them, lowered their health from a distance with my silenced gauss rifle, and finished the job with All Rise when they finally located me. Easy.
---
Yes.
---
Pick it?...
---
*raise hand and waves from Xbox* 
---
Just a simple house, shed &amp; garden, by the east break in the fence were the sentrybot &amp; assultron spawn; their my brute squad, so I don’t need turrets. 
---
The knee capper perk/legendary will turn any land based enemy, regardless of level, into an easy melee kill. (As long as it’s 1 on 1)
---
this was almost my exact reaction.  "you mean i can build like in fallout 4 but in appalachia? you mean my friends can come see what i built? you mean we can defend it from bad guys and even raider players?"  i really hope we dont have to wait too long for factions to be sorted out, so much potential there
---
This guy is a liar. I craft skelly costumes daily. Some days a couple hundred, some days just enough to make my rounds to the 7 vendors for daily caps. I’ve been crafting skelly costumes daily for the past 2 months. Still doing it daily after patch. I’ve been playing since beta days. Always playing straight. I’m not banned. 
---
I hate this. 
---
It encourages non pvpers to own workshops risk free. Workshops are pvp zones. Dont claim them unless you are prepared to fight or get ganked no matter where you are on the map. 
---
One of my favorite things is rolling on a workshop owner who is way across the map from  their shop. Have my buddy wait at the workshop until i have eyes on the player. Strike up a roleplay convo, then blip red. Now we are pvp enabled at the bottom of some pve area and the WSowners got a buncha junk on them...
---
*Hello there..*
---
This proposed system of yours fucks pvpers who are trying to find eachother as well.  We take workshops to say"hi, id like to pvp" to eachother. 
---
Holy shit I'm getting War. Guess it's time to start doing the daily/weekly challenges and hoarding my caps. Hopefully they'll only be 1400 caps each or a big bundle, I'm up to 2600
---
Yeah it is indeed really stupid, but i dont know any other way. 
---
This looks bad ass to bad I’m down to my last 400 atoms this would run for 1400 atoms times 4 =5600 🤔
---
My [Build](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwkMAgUHBwcBAQEAMk8DQAF4A/ABA04CEAFvAaYBA4ABAl8BcAULAzUBpwEDVwNxAmwDtwEBUQO7AQPVAQEkAY8BAtcBARkDAA==) is  just an all around rifle/hording build for wandering around the wilds of Appalachia, it usually keeps me alive and I am constantly changing it.
---
Sometimes I am not paying attention to my health, so the Born Survivor Perk is perfect for me.
---
Nothing special as far as guns, one star Quad Handmade gives me 80 bullets in a clip and then I mod it to the Anti-Armor Perforating magazine and Hardened Receiver and put a suppressor (silencer) on it just for fun.
---
AFAIK the problem with the Group of Gutsy is they have Anti-Armor bullets, so a group of them can quickly take anyone down if you are not careful and by that I mean run away ;-)
---
First thing is level up your Power Armor to the max level and use the best one to get you past the fight. Dump all the cards that do not help with the fight, and use all your dps and defensive cards, you can change it back to what you want after you win the fight. If you still have problems might be an idea to wait a while and level up to move points out of Intelligence and get some more Perk cards.
---
I think that would definitely be considered pay to win hehe. The community would freak out. I can see the YouTube posts now. They could offer it as a free gift box once per month with a random 3 star drop  you can get get from atomic shop. Player appreciation day 😊
---
If you don't mind the order, you could go to emmett's east of westspring and get irradiated until you mutate. One mutation per server though
---
Female player here. I thought there were a ton of options for the hair. There weren’t a lot I liked but there were more than enough to choose from. 
---
I’m surprised you’ve played the game that long tbh 
---
I think due to the criticism they will be individual at 1400 atoms a pop. Maybe a deal for all for. But I can't see the deal being less than 3000 atoms. 
---
They are beautiful for sure. Definitely a step in the right direction. I'll be throwing down actual money for these no regrets. 
---
War and Pestilence are my personal favorites. 
---
The x-01 reminds me of a Bioshock look and I absolutely love it for that.
---
Queen drops ultracite mods reliably and serum plans on occasion
---
I know for almost a fact that in the future  (through a trusted source) we will be seeing something called "Sheepsquatch" added to the game, which is a WV take on Sasquatch,  so take that as you will (:
---
Atomic Shop. Last section. 
---
Temba, his arms wide.
---
Player vendors are the easiest, but if you want to farm them naturally I like West Tek. On load in you get some useful super mutants to kill, plus a decent chance of a legendary to spawn. Clear your way to the decon arc, and the terminal the activates it. Take a drink of the toxic goo, you'll get a mutation in one or two sips. If you want it put on starched genes and clear the rads, server hop and repeat. It's tedious, and you'll be rerolling more then a few times to get the combo you're looking for... However not only will you save on caps but you'll make a decent profit and xp from killing the mutants plus some alright junk and ammo. There's also hounds that spawn there so you'll be alright on food, it's just a supply of water you'll need to take with you. If you're a high enough level you can just use the guns the mutants drop to save your good ones while doing this. 
---
Pigtron, the robot pig. Last resort weapon of choice to disgusting exploitative mobsters of the Shibuya area.
---
Roll around in some toxic puddles.
---
I am also seeing this going from 295 without power armor to 270 with it.
---
Actually I play with the guy. I basically have the same pic but with me posing.
---
It's very hard for me to fully trust this guy since I come from very similar 'clan' or group or whatever you want to call it that he's associated with. OP did say they used to accept large donations and I'm assuming he's inferring to duped items. Accepting duped donations got many of our members banned and I wouldn't be surprised if 900 hours guy had something to do with those bulks and that got him suspended. Notice this suspension happened AFTER the wipes happened. Who knows what he could have been hoarding before the wipe
---
I'm surprised people like you still feel the need to subscribe to a sub reddit for a game you dislike.
---
there are free ones in there that will say owned
---
I was thinking the exact same thing today. My main base is an isolated warehouse in the mountains, a small mobile base would be awesome and motivate me to make farther treks from glorious mansion.
---
“Most presumed guilty until proven innocent people are still waiting for an explanation with open tickets.”
---
This. 
---
I have a schematic I drop first for every workshop I take that has my fast travel mat inside of a locked tower. The tower has kill holes on the second floor so I can safely scout out the attacker with third person view. It also ensures I don't get dumped on immediately upon traveling to the workshop. 
---
It also helps as a way to draw the attacker's attention. I run a weightless chameleon build right now. Yesterday I had about 4 or 5 skirmishes with an attacker. I bested him every time. The trick is to keep moving position when the attacker respawns. My first kill on him was from the top of the tower, not the windows. Then I jumped to a nearby tree. Then I hid on the other side of the map. He mini nuked my then empty tower and dropped him before he could figure me out. Chameleon seems to be the best mutation for workshop defense and offense. It also makes stealth boys and that mentats that highlights living creatures all the more valuable.
---
Also, it seems if you are on defense and you die, you need to seek revenge otherwise you will be unable to contest the point. A few workshops I recently "liberated" allowed me to completely ignore the owner after his first death.
---
I think your panic room idea is a great one though. It may be a bit too expensive the bigger it gets.
---
In regards to balancing workshop PVP, a five second countdown should be enough to get on even ground.
---
Omg, when they came on him naked and hugging like a pole? That episode had all sorts of WTF.
---
Nah, it's more like hugbox gibberish where there is some imagined "cabal" of a handful of posters using alts and sockpuppets that are posting all the negative stuff about the game. Because apparently the game is almost flawless and only a tiny minority have any sort of significant issue while playing the game. So, still gibberish but with an extra helping of delusion on top.
---
**I'm pretty sure this is in the Bethesda Company Handbook:**
---
Step 1 - Read some suggestion in reddit.  Nerf this, change that, we like this, etc.
---
Step 2 - Over-react and code like crazy, listen to no more feedback, don't ask for solutions, FFS don't do a POLL, just code.
---
Step 3 - Implement half assed not intelligently designed change in a patch.  
---
Step 4 - Community is pissed.  Bethesda acts confused.  Return to Step 1.
---
Repeat since launch.  "Why are they mad?  We did what the handbook said!"
---
**Want to know how to fix it?**  ASK multiple people for suggestions on how to fix it.  Hell you can have a stickied post right here in reddit "Question of the day from the Devs:  What changes would ALL of you like to see done to workshops?"
---
Get that good feedback.  Then format it into a POLL that you do in-game at login (voluntary, not mandatory).  
---
Once you've seen some solutions, and the community had a chance to vote on them, THEN and only THEN make an intelligent well informed decision on how to proceed.  You might not choose Number 1 on the poll for some reason (hard to code, server stability, to many labor hours, etc), but at least you wouldn't choose NUMBER 10 every time.
---
Onto my 6th lab in CPU architecture tomorrow. I 99.999% agree with you as I keep writing my labs in Python instead of C++ or assembly like the big boys and girls. I just like the way it looks (*totally* not because it is the path of least resistance, of course.)

It is a scrap mod, that’s how I learnt it
---
The last thing I want is help defending. I usually ignore attacks until it gives me the 'reclaim' quest. The enemies don't actually harm anything until someone gets close by. It also gives me an early warning when someone is in my workshop as if they kill a single thing, I can see the progress bar on the 'reclaim' quest increase.
---
I swear everyone who plays this game has a really nice C.A.M.P setup. All I have is my cheap little wood shack ;-;
---
You "literally read." I wasn't responding to the OP. I was responding to you complaining "make new god damned content" by pointing out that they are and announced it's coming next month.    
---
Not my fault you threw a tantrum over hearing facts. 
---
Tbh I think these bans came in waves so it could’ve been something he had before the wipe that got him banned still. I agree that it’s hard to trust most people that say these things and I understand your skepticism. 
---
I dont believe that Bethesda can actually track specific items like ammo, that’s why when they deleted the TSE they just deleted stacks not every weapon.. because they couldn’t tell which were duped or not. So if Bethesda can’t tell what’s duped or not imo it’s kinda ridiculous to expect a player too. We’re not talking millions of rounds here, or 100k nuka cola, or even 100k flux, we’re talking about 100k ultracite ammo and to me that Cutoff is ridiculous and arbitrary.
---
No, no no OP, you're doing it all wrong. It is far more impressive to spam power armors all over the place by railroad station stash boxes, let the armors sit long enough for everyone to notice how singularly awesome you are and THEN finally make a wardrobe selection.  
---
Only recently, a mere 95 days ago, was Bethesda even made aware of the community's desire for the feature you are requesting. These things take time - I'm sure you understand.
---
https://i.imgur.com/nnwVNui.png
---
&gt; but since last patch some mobs are surviving with what I'm assuming is 1 HP.
---
That's a side effect of this bug: any would-be-lethal damage appears to take them *just* above 0 HP before partially or fully regenerating (sometimes buckshot or two shot weapons apply some damage from a portion of the projectiles while the others are essentially duds that then appear to regen and sometimes the regen takes a while to appear so you can occasionally kill them before their health pool client-side readjusts and you don't visually notice it at all).
---
Bloodied leveler pre-patch 500 dmg under 20% hp
---
 Now 250-330 depending on hunger.
---
Why not have Pacifist mode an option at game start. Once you login, you are pacifist until you log out. If you want PvP then when you start the game in PvP mode. Mark the players in pacifist, or PvP mode with different colors on your map. If you want to switch modes, then you need to restart the game.
---
I do think that an easier solution is simply to provide PvE servers. Those who want to do PvP, or occasional PvP can make their own choices on those servers.
---
I did an enclave repair the dishes event.
---
Normally it's scorched, super mutants, honey bees, whatever.  No problem, smash smash smash sledge kills all.
---
Not this one.   All Yao Guai.  Like 10 of them.  I was never stun locked this much in the game ever.  Fought, stimpacked like crazy, ran away, died twice or more.  It was the most fun I've had at an event ever.  I don't even remember what the reward was, I was just super glad all the Death Bears were gone :)
---
The SBQ is downright boring compared to that one event I did.   Yaaaawwwwnnnnn!
---
And you know they could do MORE events like this!  Occasionally make them Super Events!  Double the health, double the damage, double the waves, and give out GUARANTEED 3 STAR REWARDS (none of this 1 star wood arm crap).  That would be FUN!  That would be something to DO!  I would ENJOY that!
---
But no, they're busy chasing bugs like it's a cure for cancer, nerfing things that people like, and tilting at duper windmills until Don Quixote is telling them "give it a rest".
---
Does your rifle already have that mod attached?
---
Good point. I don’t mind the miner gauntlet so maybe I’ll try that for a bit  
---
Nope, and I already crafted a brand new one just to see if maybe that would work. 
---
Crazy idea: PvP should drive balance. 
---
Hear me out. 
---
Take top end, 3 star geared builds MELEE (unyielding/assasin mix + cavaliers) GUNS (Sentinal/assasin)
---
Mellee: just enough to 1 shot kill players with a slow weapon pvp. Mid speeds should be 1 or 2 shot kills depending on DR. Fast weapons should be a 2 shot kill unless in sneak.
---
GUNS: 2 to 3 shot to kill players. One shot with vats crit. Slower Shottys and dragons deserve a 1 shot build as well. Vats crits can only do so much with such a slow fire rate. 
---
UNARMED: bloody guantlet stealth boy abusers are the most dangerous overpowered fuckers around. These fuckers wreck me with my sledge build with my cavaliers + assasins/unyielding mix gear. Im 5/5 3 star and they beat me in 1 star armor from the 1 shot + crazy fast swing speed combo. They should be a 2 shot kill for players. Nerf their base damage. 
---
Then adjust the pve enemies healthpool and DR accordingly to accomodate what pve players like! 1 shot ghouls @ 300 dmg seems about right. 
---
Heres another tip: DR is useless end game pvp. Its all % dmg resist. Whats the point of DR against 1200 dmg!
---
&gt;Restore Adrenal Reaction, then remove Twisted Muscles for unarmed, and add a non-VATS gun mutation.
---
or how about guns get a twisted muscle equivalent? removing shit is literally a race to the bottom
---
Yours is a "cheap little shack"..wait till you see mine
---
huh?????   any one else understand this?
---
Same!! AP drains so fast, and need to use way more ammo on lower level enemies :( what gives? 
---
I was just thinking about this today! We have an outdoor furniture place in town that also sells statuary like the Lions you see in front of rich people's houses, bird baths, ect. They have about a dozen concrete 7' tall Bigfoots (Bigfeets?) that they can have painted by a professional artist. As I passed by, I was thinking "A Bigfoot would be cool in FO76."
---
I've literally been waiting months since I saw them datamined. I've got like 4000 atoms sitting and waiting expecting they will release a week of cool actual post apocalyptic style objects like those skins and other camps objects, outfits etc. Gotta be ready for those limited time only stuff
---
I hate the brick building indoor walls. I spent like 6 hours total making my base and it still looks butt ugly 
---
Anthem is not a better game than this you are blind or EA gave you money
---
Did you upload the wrong video? We see a yao Guai and it has battle music...
---
Yeah, with PC there are so many variables that can cause crashes. Your video card, motherboard, etc.
---
Mine has really been incredibly stable. No crashes.
---
Bye Felicia. 
---
nah, just an amateur astronomer.  so.....space.....yeah........hopefully next life time, we have space travel.  sick of sitting on this planet.  want to see others.   calgon!!  take me away!!  ;-)
---
They're already publicly nerfing AND stealth nerfing 3 star legendary drops.  Watoga Medical, Number of Legendary Ghouls at Whitesprings, basically anywhere people have said "it's good to farm for 3 star items here".  NERF, NERF, NERF.
---
You think they're going to BLESS you with a 5 star?
---
hahahahahahahahahahahah
---
Wait, maybe they would if it was a Rolling Pin with Suppressors / 15% Block Damage / 40% Less Damage while Power Attacking / and whatever two other garbage perks they could possibly add from the rest of the pool.  I'm pretty sure they'd bless you with that one.  Still un-usuable trash, but it would be 5 stars :)
---
Spent 15 minutes and you couldn't use your 2 brain cells to realise they were not giving exp the first 10 seconds? 
---
Innocent TUBA shot by greenskin. I bet if it was a BANJO it wouldn't have been shot.
---
Anthem is better than 76 let's not kid ourselves 
---
If you’re on XB, I can give you a Grognak’s Axe, which is a solid starter melee Weapon. I have like 4 of them I think but I don’t recall what levels they are. Plus I sold one to Watoga vendor for like 10 caps because I was desperate to shed weight. 
---
Back in FO4, I never did melee. Not sure why I decided to try it in FO76, but I am truly glad I did. :)
---
I have duped guns that I was given, two or three of them, and I have all but begged Bethesda to wipe my account and let me start over, so long as I get to keep my level and my account. I got suspended for picking up a paper bag of junk, not that many people will believe me, but oh well. 
---
This bummed me out so much. 
---
Why are you mad?
---
That's epic loot bro.
---
That's like finding one of the gold guns in Apex Legends.  Literally a 1 shot beast.
---
The fix for *actual damage* (ignore pipboy) seems to be remove it and regain it.
---
It's a goddamn duck!
---
I would love to see indestructible Player Vendor terminals all in one central location.
---
Two Reasons:
---
1.  It will be super easy and fun to shop ALL of the Player Vendor Terminals in one central location.  You can even server hop to see everyone's shop in that new server.  Super easy, fast, fun trades.
---
2.  Player vending at camps will be a disaster.  There are already people having problems with other people blowing up their bases.  Now increase that ten times because they show up and didn't like your prices, your selection, or just decided "nope, no selling for you today".
---
No, it's not in my list of available cards.
---
thanks
---
I'm guessing Anthem probably also sucks if you're an idiot 
---
It’s in charisma 
---
100%. I am still pretty new, but I am collecting so much scrap for what seems like nothing. I don't need 200 scrap copper if I can only afford to hang one light bulb in my settlement with one shack and a guard tower. I assume it is somewhat small to keep lag down on the server, but even 10% larger budget overall would be a welcome improvement.
---
I stopped bothering with most of the perks.  Only get things when I really want them.
---
I think I have 20 levels banked on one guy and 40 levels banked on another guy.
---
Still no Perk Loadout Manager (but there's a mod, go figure)
---
Still no way to hide the crap cards you don't want to see.
---
Seems like whoever did UI was just fired or re-assigned.
---
I feel it's the other way around after patch
---
Check out the Atomic Shop. Hairstyles are pretty cheap and you may already have enough free earned atoms to get whatever one you want. I got the beehive (Marge Simpson style) and don it sometimes. I didn’t like how it clips in power armor so I switched to a bun for most gameplay. 
---
I’ve had them drop from events near Watoga like fly swatter and some other ones I’m forgetting, given I’ve only had one plan drop out of countless events completed but it is possible.
---
I've tried rad x and even took another serum 
---
You have never seen a duck before! I can tell!! 
---
me too.... im a build scrub, i have a simple compact 2 story 4x4 built for solo play
---
Huh! Solid info man thanks!
---
I love the modders.  I used both Known Plans and Perk Loadouts in the past.  Sadly one of the patches broke my Perk Loadouts and I haven't been able to get it working again since then.  Probably just stupidity on my part to be honest.
---
Modders fix the things that Bethesda either refuses to, or isn't smart enough to do.
---
All praise to the modders!
---
Oh wait, I just found heavy combat leg plans in Watoga. So I crafted 3 pieces, then scrapped them, but didn't learn any mod plans.
---
How many times, on average, do you have to craft/scrap armor before you learn a mod plan?
---
Whitespring bots don't give XP because they are supposed to be considered 'friendly' (even when they are shooting you) so no they don't give any XP for killing them. Seems like a good way to waste bullets though....
---
They shoot me, I shoot them. They die, and I get shit. I shoot them they die, I get nothing. Bad programming
---
I know I'm probably in the minority here, but the crafting was my favorite part of F4. I have over 400 hours in the game, and I would reckon 370 hours of that is collecting scrap so I can build better settlements. I was really hoping F76 would have a much larger focus on it, so maybe for F5 they can go back to a more story-drive focus to please many of the fans turned off by the ancillary objectives that weren't in F3 and FNV.
---
you have to choose new perk card when leveling up.... press TAB and T (on pc) and you can select between switching points or selecting new perk.
---
Yawn.
---
I remember developers where I'd salivate at watching a livestream.  What new details would they lay out, what new leaks would I get to hear about first?
---
I'm so bored with FO76 if it's just them playing the game, I might literally die of boredom.
---
I have not got money im fucking tired of killing legendaries and not getting anything. Oh I might have got an instigating Mr handy buzz blade. 
---
what platform is this masterpeice...... i would like a tour of it, looks fabulous..... honestly, i am truly amazed
---
You need to cure it and re obtain it. After doing it you'll get a visual bug where it won't show the positive effects on your status screen, but you will get the positive effects.
---
Nah, we help noobies out just because.  We remember what it was like running around flatwoods with 1 stimpack and a dream, but 80% radiated and about to die.....lol
---
Just pay it forward when you're a higher level :)
---
This might sound a bit weird but I trust bethesda with bans. Every dupers I know, banned. Every big hoarders that I know of, banned or suspended. minus the ones that quit the game long time ago or recently returned, of course. Not a single innocent(relatively) players were punished. You see, my skepticism stem from my own experience . Please understand if I sound a bit stubborn but I have my reasons
---
They need to make it possible to hire people in game to build houses as a job. My poor square shack needs an architect and an interior decorator.
---
It's not there.
---
Atkeast you have a tuba! Lucky 
---
You wanna see Real grind festival go play destiny and anthem for sure u will wanna return to this game
---
Love it!
---
So what am I doing wrong regarding paint. 
---
I have collected paint several times but can’t get options to use it in building camp, weapons, or armor. 
---
The item is always specifically called blue paint or the like. I’m not accidentally junking it. 
---
Idiot alert 🚨 
---
Tel me why I shouldn't get exp from the 1400+ robots I just killed. 
---
Most definitely!  Unfortunately, I am both fascinated and terrified by Bigfoot(s?) so I could never get a statute IRL.  But to fight one in FO76 would be sweet.
---
I still haven't found Sledgehammer plan or Super Sledge plan.
---
Yay, 100%. That would be cool.
---
first i saw a post about a piggy bank camp.... now this?.... wheres my uilding tallent?
---
Perhaps. But I guess I'll find out 
---
Sadly the pig is already gone, my current project is a Pokémon arena style floating platform to fight the queen on. It's amazing so far, she will land on the platform consistently 
---
They can still drop in the wild. From events, from enemies or even just lying about.
---
I got the torso and legs off enemies, still waiting for the arms but my husband found these plans lying on a shelf somewhere. 
---
You can learn armor mods from scrapping as well? Thought that was a weapon thing
---
that sounds epic, your on pc i bet
---
Yes but if I fuck up and accidentally kill one. They are all aggro. I deserve exp after that
---
If you don't play the game, your adrenal reaction isn't broken :)
---
Schrodinger's Cat
---
Yup
---
I'll second Zealots. I have a Zealot's sniper rifle on my alt. Crafted up a Brotherhood rifle with identical mods, identical damage. With the Zealot's rifle, sneak attack to the torso (VATS targetted) of a SB flying right above me with the Zealot's took him down to the middle of the T in his name.
---
Wait for Hidden and health restore (SB's regen health if out of combat for long enough), sneak attack to the torso again with the Brotherhood rifle,   took him down to the very end of the T. I'm not sure it's actually a 30% difference but it's a definite difference. I repeated it twice, same results each time.
---
No im done with grind. 
---
If you don't play the game, your speed demon isn't broken :)
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar Trading Reddits and buy the serums from players for caps.
---
200-500 caps each normally.  Sometimes you can find them for less.
---
There’s nothing better than first hand experience for sure. I guess my problem lies with the hoarding aspect. This game encourages you to hoard and did nothing to limit you from hoarding as much as you want until 2 patches ago. I think if Bethesda didn’t want people hoarding mats and items for their clan then they should have clearly stated it long before now or had game mechanics from the beginning to prevent it from happening. And to suspend someone after the fact seems ridiculous to me. 
---
It’s not that I don’t trust Bethesda I just find the 100k rare item cutoff ridiculous and arbitrary when you include ultracite ammo.. do you not agree? And if you don’t then do you agree Bethesda should have made that known before the suspensions?
---
Yes, disconnects are fun, especially after you go through all of the effort to set up a few defenses, defend the base, and are in that sweet spot of just waiting for resources to roll in.
---
But...   how about when you are Griefed out of your workshop with a sniper TSE build, server hop, and then get disconnected just as you are about to complete your first pickup on the new server...  
---
FYI:  I'm fine with PVP in general, it's not my thing, but I get it.  My issue is that the attacker has such a huge advantage.  There should be a countdown timer or an opt-out option, similar to the revenge opt-out.
---
You don’t need to get it in a perk pack, it becomes available at a certain level. Make sure you’re looking carefully cause sometimes they’re easy to skip over. But hey maybe your games bugged idk, hopefully not tho.
---
I don't believe you received XP from 1400 robots because I do not believe you killed 1400 robots in a single session. 
---
I've given up trying to farm for good things.
---
Between the publicly acknowledged legendary drop rate nerfs, and the stealth legendary drop rate nerfs, it's not worth it to even try to farm anymore.
---
Lol yeah. I bumped into a bot in the middle of the Enclave bunker while I had the Pain Train perk equipped.
---
Nukes zones be dammed, you ain't seen anything until you are in the middle of an underground bunker filled with respawning robots.....
---
Says for the game that have infinite load screen
---
"Bravo Bravo"
---
Go into the main resort and go downstairs, the shopping area is down there. 
---
White Knight used to be a good perk to reduce Ballistic Fiber use by 90%.
---
We liked that.
---
They nerfed the hell out of it for no reason.
---
One of my characters is a “priest” (wears pastor clothing) and I give people some wine, a burnt book, and do the heart emote. So they know that Jesus loves them.
---
Are you ps4? 
---
True,  but mods are hard to find
---
face to face?
---
I did not play the beta but was looking at my challenges and noticed even discovering tip of the world did not work even though I fully finished the missions for rose. 
---
Discord :)
---
It doesn’t need to be visible by others,  hell,  make the name vanish if the weapon is dropped.
---
It will make it easier sort our preferred weapons.
---
Whitespring would be too easy to farm. As you say, they instantly respawn. Devs aren't dumb. So nice try trying to find an exploit. Server hop the golf course like everyone else does. 
---
Exactly or maybe like fo4 where you can rename it at a workbench 
---
I just killed an assault Ron. And didnt get a fusion core fuck that
---
Why tho? 
---
I had the same issue with hacker 3.  Never saw it but it turned out I had it the whole time.  I don't remember exactly why I didn't notice it, but take your time and check all the menus next time you level.
---
Wouldn't that mean his Adrenal is both broken and not broken at the same time until he observes a result? And the result changes every time he observes the result? Call me old fashioned...
---
I have had a lot of reasonably good drops lately.  Picked up a nice AA +40% power attack supersledge and a AA  + limb damage railway rifle tonight.   
---
Just wear the beer hat. Lol. I don't even remember what my character looks like with the hat, bottle cap sunglasses and veil of secrets. 
---
Power armour is the closest to a vehicle we get, so yup ig you want to park your pa. 
---
Does your game freezes suddenly? 
---
You're not near the golf clubhouse so you shouldn't get greifed
---
İm why did u ask ?
---
Good riddance. One less.
---
It sucks but I’d just wait. They can’t expect every player to redo all their mutations because they fucked up adrenal
---
The fire axe too. 
---
From my experience I find, for some reason you have a higher chance of learning a mod from armor if you find the armor in the wild. IE: loot drop, chest etc.
---
I don't know about the level/chance of getting a mod. I would like to know that too.
---
Overall though, I find learning mods from scrapping to be around 1 in 10 scraps. I don't know the exact percentage though.
---
That's what I thought too... Some sleeping bags in the world don't seem to care about this rule though. 
---
As an example, there's a sleeping bag in a shack between the river and Camden Park. It's clearly on a foundation so I figured it'd be fine. It wasn't. Got diseased!
---
I feel your pain. I'm on the ground cursing crickets with you!
---
I dunno man. I don't see anyone getting suspended for just having around 100k ammo. At least the ones that I know of. Those suspended this time were hoarding much more than that. I'm talking about hundreds of thousands pounds here. They were hoarding that much even after the wipe
---
Hey! Just wanted you to know your comment is still helping people, heh. I've captured the Lakeside Cabins (my first workshop capture, woo!) and when I had to come back to defend it, the last Super Mutant was glitched behind the stone wall by the dried up lake. So I googled what to do, it brought me here, and I was able to get the fucker with Molotovs! Tried landmines first, which is what someone else said, but that didn't work. Good ol' cocktails did the trick though. Just wanted to say thanks for the tip!!
---
Yes!  I want to exercise my right to bear arms!
---
Scout armor? Idk tbh. I wear this armor because its light. 
---
That’s what I tend to give people when I can. I invite them to my camp and I give them whatever they need out of my stashed junk. I always have a little of everything 
---
My two favorite things: 
---
Playing with my hubs and helping others, especially new members to the community!  🤟
---
If you never launch the game again, you'll never know.
---
Schrodinger's Cat times Infinity :)
---
Perhaps you scrapped it unintentionally? This was an annoying issue where it uses mods as junk when crafting.
---
why not?
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=39a389e&amp;d=sb2pl0pp2pk0pd0p02eh2ee2ib4s72a30l71lv2eo2lk2ir2la2l32a04cm2&amp;w=&amp;n=rifle%20critico
---
This is my build with unyieldind+ap+sentinel armor set
---
Maybe you die more easily, you have to move like a shadow, but you kill anything with a single shot
---
When modders can make your games playable then yeah I'm gonna say they know it better than the developers do.
---
Of course you're broke. You're an illiterate, moron troll. Mommy won't spend 60 on Anthem for you? Ha-ha.
---
I checked that as well. It's really strange. It's like it's not counting that particular mod as a possibility. 
---
And it was rusty.... 
---
Lol. Yeah that could happen. Maybe make it indestructable then. I think stash boxes cant be destroyed aswell. 
---
Need proof mate. I hope your right.
---
I was wondering about this myself so I went ahead and tested it. I have a Zealot’s sniper rifle, and a normal sniper rifle. Same mods. Zealots did more against a scorchbeast. Tested with VATS targeted torso shots while it was flying over me, so no chances of bonus damage from different body parts, or damage drop off due to range. 
---
Tested repeatedly, for consistent results- zealots hit for more (just based on the full HP bar and where it ended up after a single shot- zealots was dropping it to the middle of the T in its name. Normal was not even getting to the T. Target was allowed to regen health in between, so same health to start each time)
---
Depending on the shape you may be able to sell that lint on ebay... just sayin'
---
If you do site Alpha and are on the PS4, I'm always willing to pitch in.  My camp is nearby so if I'm online and see someone heading in I'll try to pop in and help.  I also have no problem leaving if they don't want me there.
---
Did my first run and my first solo run at level 100.  It took me over an hour of real-time since I didn't know what to do or where to go.  It was frustrating but a good experience.  
---
Noticed another guy heading in at around level 120.  He had done it a lot and gave me pointers.  He even mentioned that he found it a lot easier with 2 people instead of just one but his buddies weren't online yet and was happy for the help.  
---
Third time was at about level 125.  I noticed a player at site Alpha but was in the middle of a scrapping, repairing, and crafting food cycle.  I got there and it looked like he had gotten 3/4 the way through but then either got disconnected or died and then left simply because there was no other Nuke on the map.  In any case, it made it a cake walk for me to launch my second Nuke, third run.
---
I currently have two Nuke cards.  So I'll do at least one run this weekend.  
---
Im constantly on crowd control JUST to get the damage boosts from adrenaline. It bothers me when no one else is.
---
But at the very least, I'm guaranteed hits on the 3* legendaries that spawn!
---
PS4. But it’s over now. They have all serve as water now :). Thanks though. 
---
This is wrong, I just tested this with a zealots hunting rifle vs a normal hunting rifle (I do not have a hunters, so I don’t know if that ALSO works). Zealots does more damage to SB than a normal rifle. I had repeated, consistent, unequivocal results. 
---
Yes, definitely armor as well, although it seems (to me, at least) that you get them far less frequently than with weapons. 
---
Not my question. What made you want to document this and bring attention to this? That's why people participate and conduct interviews, so I want to know what fueled that. If you don't want to answer that's fine. 
---
Just printed it out so i can track what i have. Thanks so much, super helpful. Would be cool if we could get a post with all the google docs people have posted with info and then have that post pinned. 
---
As long as you are ignoring power armor, heavy combat armor. 
---
To understand if Bethesda approach is effective and dupers mindset towards the game.
---
BOS Heavy Combat has the highest non-legendary DR.
---
I can make the the phantom devices alright. But I have yet to take the secret agent perk. I'll eventually grab it up, just not sure when. It might be sooner rather than later, as I'm around level 135 atm, and I'm slowly working my way through the perks I really want/need before this one. 
---
Never called you a hater specifically, I feel bad for my buddy tho he did the same thing as me but traded more than 100k ultracite and he’s suspended now so I guess we all have different experiences that impact our outlook. We’re kinda running in circles at this point. Hopefully they fix their bugs soon so people who are innocent can play again and the ones who aren’t can’t dupe anymore, have a good night!
---
Oh, I'll listen in the AM. Do you take a stance? 
---
Man those fucking Rons are the worst. And it was the assault one? How did you manage?
---
id come back if they did that.
---
Seen him in harpers ferry, by posiedon power plant and also by watoga train station.
---
How do you get heavy BOS legendary armor?
---
But that's not what Schrodinger's Cat is meant to demonstrate.
---
I've seen many weapon mods where 'standerd' and 'what ever upgrade' are reversed.
---
It appears to be a programming error because the standard version raises the value of the gun and uncreases damage/range/accuracy.
---
Is it possible to mod legendary combat armor into heavy combat?
---
Yes almost a direct rip off :(, if I was games workshop I would be sending a cease and desist
---
other players.
---
Duping should be punished, but I neutral in the interview 
---
to make and scrap so you can modify the legendary armor to be even better.
---
No, it has to drop as the heavy variant. Level 50 limbs are 20/20 and chest is 61/61 if I remember right , before upgrades
---
You could have saved yourself a lot of typing by doing even the slightest research. It's a fucking bug. Even if you remove the mutation and reapply it with a serum it goes right back to being broken the next time you log out. 
---
No they are not....
---
You too bro
---
It’s my favorite of the group lol ... 
---
I'm not sure this is the most ethical use of this sub...
---
Xbox? 
---
I shot him and he booked it, what dies he give you?
---
Legendary Heavy Combat Armor can be made BOS by someone who has the plans
---
I did a wall around my crops but mole rats come right under it
---
Reddit has ethics? 
---
Yup. 
---
The water purifier recipe was bugged for sure; it said *You already know* for me on the top left when I tried to learn it. I suspect the same would happen for Mentats (although I haven't purchased it to check), since we learn the recipe from one of the bunkers. 
---
Well seems this guy has a lot of free time so reset his account and call it a day. If he got all that once he can do it again. 
---
and demand will follow as soon as supply runs out. 
---
ah.  thanx
---
That x-o1 is awesome
---
with them being friendly, and the fact that they keep respawning, it would be too easy to just keep farming them. so it balances out. like the other commenters said, i doubt you killed that many, weak troll, and just server hop. shouldnt have wasted your ammo and condition if you’d see they weren’t giving you stuff. 
---
Schrodingers Speed Demon. If you don’t move or reload, it both works and doesn’t. :o)
---
Its has to drop the heavy variant. You can only tell by looking at weight and base stats. Then you either have to have bos plans chest, legs and arms to mod it to bos. Or have some one do it for you.
---
Time for a Samsquanch statue in the Atom shop!
---
Grind atoms in game for free
---
Yeah sometimes it freezes and crashes to dashboard. Other times it just freezes for a few seconds and then goes back to normal. 
---
You learn the light combat armor from doing the main quest, Freestates bit I think? I've only found the arms and legs plans for sturdy at vendor and not sure about heavy but scrapping light will do the job. Treasure maps will give you a lot of combat armor bits and occasional plans.
---
Bigfoot saw me but nobody believes him.
---
Oh, that's the issue -- it was automatically put in my list of perk cards. Every time I leveled I looked for it in the list of perk cards I didn't have, hoping to pick it, and of course it was never there. D'oh!
---
No?
---
I was going to say Chupacabra, but that's already been in other Fallout games, hasn't it?
---
Make them fight!
---
Yeah i have the same issue, especially at whitesprings wearing PA. I did some research.  It says reinstall the game.. Well thats not gonna happen.  I think its because the console is overheating or  it thinks its overheating..  Because of that i dont claim workshops anymore or do bunker runs. 
---
That’s just straight bullsh*** XD
---
 I know people who duped but are NOT banned so explain me why should I trust you not being one of those ? 
---
Too all the guys who think Bethesda don’t Bann wrong people and are always right at that point i ask you one question:
---
Are all  banns as right the bug fixes and updates ? 
---
Because as I know some weren’t fully fixed most often and some implemented new bugs
---
What I wanna say: they do some mistakes it happens you have no proof no evidence and can’t judge ... but Bethesda can investigate 
---
more/better if people really deserve a ban if they claim to be innocent 
---
no video, did not happen  ;-P
---
Says some idiot who only posts about this game.
---
How did you test it? Curious
---
Why would you mention that when OP didn’t say they were using it? 
---
It would almost be easier for them to allow partial bulk like bulk copper(1/12) so it's not broken down but a percentage is used. That would work with the current code. Just require the bulk to be treated the same as unbulked when crafting 
---
Ugh, 1 in 10... that means I gotta craft a lot of combat armor in order to learn the BoS plan.
---
Calling me an idiot don’t mean much bud 😂
---
why not?  shit, i will post bounties here too!
---
Outstanding. I love the scale of it. 
---
That's a BAD banjo!!!
---
What a stupid comment. It looks like a duck.
---
I booted up 4 the other day for the first time in ages, completely forgetting that you can’t fast travel from interiors.
---
I think 76 has spoiled me.
---
Atoms judgement returns????
---
Seems like a fun pvp lol. 
---
Pray to Atom that we may gaze upon this relic’s beauty once again!
---
I'm not 100% sure about this, but I don't think BOS combat Armor can be learned via scrapping. 
---
In other posts I read about people bitching about players just attacking non SBQ for experience and that that makes the queen last forever and bullet sponge the few that are attacking her.    6 of this half dozen of the other.  
---
this is interesting and some thing i had not thought about, but has effected me too.
---
numerous times i have accidentally aggro'd the bots.  i will NEVER use explosive weapons at whitesprings again!!  lmao
---
but yeah, if you aggro them, they are no longer friendly, so therefore we should get xp.   i have had SB's that are neutral to me, but as soon as i shoot at them, they aggro, and i get XP for that.
---
I had a cheap wood shack near Huntersville, source of the Super Mutants and first test sited of the FEV virus...   
---
I found it cool and ironic that the virus that made most of the beasties that we fight came from the first place that I picked to settle down.  I loved my Super Mutant neighbors, they were good for a little extra XP every time I returned home...  .grin.
---
At about level 50 I started going into Nuke zones and finally had enough decent plans, plus a few things from the Atomic Shop, that I decided to move my camp to a spot close to site Alpha on a stream.  Now I have a nice brick garage with large garage door, a tree house using the barn plans, a small dock, and a garden with oil lamps...  
---
I'll have to post some picks before i build the next one.
---
This is why, at risk of sounding like a broken record, we need PvE and PvP servers.   
---
I also have noooo interest in PvP, but I do like using workshops - and I don't feel like I should be forced into PvP as the price for utilising an integral part of the game.
---
Exactly what OP described kept happening to me last night - was getting one-shotted by raiders who were 150 levels or so above me before I was even aware they were nearby.   
---
More power to the folks who want to PvP but it ain't my thing and never will be. For those who are into PvP, I can see how frustrating the game in its current state would be.  
---
Bethesda are trying to satisfy two completely different camps of players with '76 and in doing so are managing to satisfy neither. 
---
I got assaulted by Ron once. Don’t want to talk about it.
---
Seriously, it was like watching an episode of the 3 Stooges. That Yackety Sax song from Benny Hill should have been playing in the background! lol
---
I mostly just wish I had the option to “hide” perk cards I never use.
---
Would save from having to flick through them all when switching out cards.
---
And if I want to see them again, tab across from the SPECIAL categories, past the cost categories, and onto the “hidden cards” category.
---
I'll have to start paying closer attention to see if mine breaks now too. Since the patch my marsupial breaks now too. Mostly when server hopping. I'll log into a server and it's normal jump height, never works. Server hop and it's working again. Lets hop speed demon is the same and not permanently broke like adreanal reaction.
---
They literally doubled the weight limit in the Stash since release, so that's one problem solved for you.
---
As for damage, if you're not using any damage-improving Perks, you're gonna have a bad time. This game relies on you taking those Perk cards every so often to improve your overall damage to things. Also, don't forget that weapons and armor themselves have levels. If you have been using the same pistol since level 1 and you made it to 20, it's gonna be more difficult to kill things.
---
I have some bos plans and have no idea where I got them. I'm about 50/50 whether it was an event or through scrapping, tho I'm leaning towards the latter
---
Would definitely be nice for there to be a way to choose which mutation you’d like to remove.
---
Another comment downing on the game from the moron who only posts on FO76. Get a life.
---
depending on armor, it's much more cost-effective to craft low-level gear and scrap, i.e. leather, because any good mods (shadowed/treated leather, ultra-light/deep pocketed) can be learned from the lowest level of armor.
---
not sure about higher level armor like marine combat armor - i've found recipe for limbs and torso (mods, not for the item itself) in harpers ferry, and the recipes for the items themselves out in the world.
---
marine armor costs a lot of stuff to craft and the only two mods that really are worth it are ultra-light and deep pocketed, both of which can frequently be found in harpers ferry
---
I want a personal camp and a communal camp you and friends build together
---
Have 2 of them are you on ps4 ?
---
A friend of mine has had the same complaint about cores lately. 
---
It’s prioritising the lowest charged ones now if that makes a difference?
---
Aww, did the logic hurt? Your name is cdog, you must be a gem.
---
I have a bloodied faster swing speed axe, tis my fav melee weapon right now
---
As for the weight limit, fucking great! That's awesome!! You have no idea how happy that makes me.
---
And yeh, I was watching my perk cards and weapons levels, choosing the best choices I could given the situation but keeping in mind my level and other factors.
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
Lol you’re pathetic kid, I’ve put 500+ hours into the game and it sucks, I’ve had really high hopes for it to be good and have given it plenty of chances, and all I used reddit for is fo... but the game is a disappointment.. and logic? You called me a moron bc I said the game sucks you need to get a life man,and it’s a hell of a lot better than “supermega” you cunt
---
Ok, here is my Build. 
---
I included the one I combat with and the one I use to attempt to hide weight so I can fast travel back to base. 
---
[PRL867’s Melee Build FO76](https://imgur.com/gallery/kIjRMtR)

When the exploit is fixed = it will never happen.  Devs have proven they are incapable of fixing their own game.  
---
It’s a win win situation.  
---
Hate the exploiters? You win!  
---
Got banned? Devs just gave you no choice but to go elsewhere, you also win!
---
It’s just a game . . . well sort of, and life is too short to be angry!
---
The research is pretty clear on this. When in a disaster situation humans almost always work together and infighting drops to almost nothing. It is the extreme minority that take advantage of the situation. That is why after earthquakes you see people rushing to collapsed buildings to pull people out or sharing food and water to help each other. 
---
In emergency situations our survival instincts are the strongest and we evolved to solve emergencies together instead of alone. It sounds cool in a zombie apocalypse that everything goes to hell but it just would not happen that way.
---
You’re pathetic kid lmao get a life, and it’s a hell of a lot better thank “supermega” you jerk off
---
I just really like the look of tricentennial on xo1, and blackbird. It makes it hard to justify carrying around another set of PA, but I will have a look for every occasion.
---
You put 500 hours into something you didn't like? Hahaha
---
I love build mode, belive me you are not alone! I want to rebuild Appalachia.
---
Same here - was trying to shoot a bear and now can’t finish
---
Please share I love farming for lead and Steele and making ammo it’s all I have left to do
---
I do not think it means what you think it means....
---
PVP is supposed to be somewhat balanced.  It's supposed to be a fight that lasts longer than 10 seconds.  You like sniping and setting up ambushes...  That's not PVP...
---
Thank you, This is a very useful list, is it possible to add images to this list, at least for the C.A.M.P items?
---
It's weird that the only place I ever see him is white springs, i have a camp there and i see him ALOT. Like 10% of the time I fast travel to my camp he is there. Can't complain I never run out of balistic fiber.
---
The stash limit was raised to 800, you can now see if you know a plan or not. melee was stealth nerfed (from what I saw from another post), TSE was nerfed, just overall nerfs to weapons and it seems enemies got a stealth buff (another thing I read from a post). I rolled a new character in order to start a better build and haven't noticed anything that has drastically changed. Loving the 800 limit on stash. I suggest dromedary as you can just drink liqour all day, stack that with pharma-farm which will net you a lot of stims, purified water, etc to sell, good boy for eating canned dog food with can-do-it (?) to loot a lot of canned goods. This early build will set you up for not having to deeply maintain health/hunger/thirst. For getting all junk possible, find a junk resource to build on. 
---
Overall, not much has changed besides some QoL changes. Is it worth another shot? Yes if you're bored, no if you're not.
---
I would suggest reading the most recent patch notes, as that's the meat of the bone so far.
---
Like I said had high hopes but it’s a big let down, just like your life kid
---
That's awesome. 
---
I would say replace all that in front of the garage with some of those concrete ramps if you haven't tried that already, so it looks more like an actual garage with a driveway.
---
exactly, satisfying neither.
---
most of us are fallout returnies.  we have been playing a SINGLE player game since the beginning, and then suddenly, we are thrown into PvP??  i am not looking for a fo5, what i WAS looking for was group PvE.
---
seriously though, PvP'ers have not really bothered me at all.  been playing since 12 1 18, got about 400hrs in, and in this total time, i have been raider'ed maybe 10 times.  of these, i can distinctly remember 2 of them.  both 1 shot me AND TOOK THE WS!!!  there is the PROPER use of PvP in this environment.  coming in, 60, 70, 100 level higher than me, 1 shot me, then just sit there (hoping?) i will retaliate? instead of taking the WS?  i do not get it.  
---
i really did not think the 50 - 60 caps you get for killing me was actually worth your time.  hell, i make that back with one encounter with super mutants at west tek.
---
on a few occasions, if our levels were some what close, say within 15, i did try and fight back to reclaim WS.  been successful and unsuccessful.  
---
&gt;You're flat lying out your ass. [incromprehensible ranting]
---
although you're partially right, I did assume you were talking about regular gear, you keep ignoring armor. there's a world of difference between assassin and assassin/sentinel with ap refresh speed. someone with a full marine/BoS combat set of the latter is infinitely harder to kill than the former.
---
&gt;I have a god roll weapon, revolutionary sword bloodied/40% swing speed/+1 str
---
although god rolls are subjective, that's not godly. the mods are perfect, but the weapon is not a super sledge or a grognak's axe. and nobody would trade you one (let alone sell) because they'd want a god roll themselves.
---
well, maybe not this particular sledge/grognak's as Im sure it's been duped, but I should hope you get the idea.
---
&gt;They don't take a thousand hours of farming. [more incromprehensible ranting]
---
do you understand how rng and probability work? even though the odds of rolling a godly legendary are less than 0.000001%, and I can prove it, probability dictates you could do it within an hour of gameplay, it's just that the odds are next to none.
---
I'll say it again: don't use personal experience as a measurement of anything. otherwise it took me **seven hundred hours** to get an explosive shotgun. better to rely on math.
---
Better delete more comments to not seem dumb.
---
Awesome, great to hear!
---
Am I bored, yes.
---
Like I said kill yourself and do society a favor
---
nope.
---
The timer should be longer than 30 seconds if it starts at the time the Workshop is contested.  
---
For example, I might be in the middle of SBQ fight.  No way am I going to have time to respond to messages....  Or maybe it's delayed when the player is near a Nuke zone or in a Silo...
---
But yeah, something needs to be done about PVP at workshops.  They've made it way too easy for the attackers now.  They have all the time in the world to plan for it, including swapping out perk cards, etc...
---
For example, Guy sniped me with TSE at one of the workshops that I claimed the other day and I was killed with two shots in Power Armour (No Fireproof perk). I thought that I was there to defend the workshop from monsters, not PVP, and was surprised to see a cloaked player there shooting at me...   
---
I wasn't interested in PVP and it just annoyed me at how easy it was for him to set up an ambush.
---
Respectful, I do not take workshops for PvP and no one I team with does either. 
---
I take them because I want resources. Period.
---
I need fusion cores, or gears, or lead, or aluminum. 
---
I don’t want to opt-in to PvP, but I don’t have a choice if I want to gain resources. 
---
another interesting build.
---
As a former workshop owner (used those a lot) this is the reason I'm done with workshops now.
---
tl;dr is no
---
Thank you! 
---
yes. it's hit or miss but eventually you'll cripple their wings, even outside vats. once they're on the ground just keep shooting and they'll become immobile.
---
enforcer is *really* good. one gun army, not so much. I still keep rank 1 though, just for the chance.
---
no, there is no other way than via option menu in the game.
---
I got a 2 shot explosive combat shotgun depending your perks it does about 150+ damage with explosive expert maxed shotgunner maxed and scattershot you should be good to go. Ill launch another nuke tmr 
---
I really appreciate that, but unfortunately I'm on PlayStation
---
Pretty shitty when you swap from a gun build because they nerfed TSe to a bloodied adrenal melee build then they break adrenal....
---
Haha! This is the first thing my friends said too
---
Just put a cap on the amount of turrets and reduce the budget for them
---
its level 26.....
---
Thank you so much! 
---
A guy mention that there was a quest to do this.  I've also been thinking about giving it a try, but it would have to be on a lite server, probably off hours.  There is usually that one workshop that is claimed that would either require waiting it out or PVP.
---
I would, I'd love to, I'm all for helping people. However, if I did... All of Reddit would know, and I'd never be able to get my made. Any Appalachian fisherman. You never reveal the secret fishing spot!
---
Thanks! I spent so long looking for somewhere realistic to build. Really happy with how it blends right in
---
I have learned BoS plans for both chest and limbs, so can modify anyones armor for free (you need to bring mats thou), I'm on PC.
---
True! One man’s power armor is another man’s tuba! Appreciate the little things 😀
---
i would love to play a super mutant.  cap int. at like 3.  maybe max str. could be 18 or 20?
---
or a ghoul.  cap cha. at 3?  you have a natural rad resist.
---
play a robot.  good s.p.e.c.i.a.l all around, but the upkeep on your robot body.........ooof!
---
we could add scorched characters, i mean the list goes on.
---
this game has SO MUCH potential.  i would love to be a "fly on the wall" at BGS.  see if ANY THING on my wish list is even being considered.  
---
Seems like all the mutations are spotty as far as working. Had adrenal, healing factor, marsupial, speed demon, electrically charged all intermittently work and not work (except adrenal doesn't seem to work at all) since the last patch. Not sure if my other mutations are working to be honest, those are the ones i noticed. 
---
I haven't really found ultracite ammo worth it(Bethesda doesn't event tell you how much of a bonus it does to scorched)
---
Furious caps out at +50% damage. I heard it takes 8 hits to hit the cap. 
---
lol.  400hrs in, not 1
---
Thank you!
---
Great idea, going to try this right now. 
---
if you're on PC just bring the mats and I can make any Combat Armor piece BoS, free of charge.
---
Two
---
Oh that's perfect thank you! 
---
Great list! Very useful.
---
Just wondering, do you need to be a certain level to see plans like the Brick Walls plan? I've made my way to Watoga, Harpers Ferry and all of those places (quite dangerous to be walking around as a level 16), did some server hops and never seen plans like the Brick Building set. 
---
Bigfeet.
---
You sir have single handedly turned Whitesprings into a zoo.
---
What the actual, literal duck.
---
Blackwater mine has a rad area with a second shower nearby.
---
There should be a sub reddit dedicated to nukes and sbq fights. Whenever I want to launch a dam nuke theres never anybody on so I end up nuking whitesprings :(
---
So you're saying...learn to code?
---
Adrenal benefits every low healthy build, not just melee. But yes it is shitty
---
Karma Attack incoming"Mission Failed we will got him next time"
---
So because you had a lot of items you got banned?
---
Yeah :(
---
 EULA then. You were clearing saying "Mules should be banned" above, which is nonsense stance.
---
This is fucking awesome ❤
---
You can grow adhesive(vegetable starch) but that aside there's a lot of them up at the top of the map, east of the cabin and north of the farm over there.
---
for me, the server disconnects almost made me quit the game, as i like running multiple workshops.  i literally snapped a keyboard over my knee when i spent 2 hours building up several WS's, only to get a server disconnect, multiple times in the same night.
---
this game is just about as bad as counter strike was in pressing my buttons and triggering my rage!!  lol.  CS actually made me toss a 21 inch CRT monitor across the room.  head shot my ASS!!  fucker is using aimbot!!! ha ha!!
---
last time I did the queen was around 10 of us, lowest was maybe 70. same crew spawned her 3 straight times. first fight was over after 20 minutes, second fight she immediately landed and never took off, was dead at 28:10 or so left, the third time my friend disconnected so was fewer of us, maybe 1 or 2 under 100 and she flew around for about 7 minutes, landed and was dead in under a minute from almost full health to healing to fully dead. loot was garbage all 3 times but at least we killed her in time. The 2nd fight was the fastest i've ever seen her die. The crew who spawned her had killing her down cold. not sure why the first fight took so long other than there was a 5 minute or more period where she glitched in flight and never moved, then she unglitched and flew around for 5 or more minutes in big circles. 
---
It just works.™

I have never seen them from any vendor. 
---
And I need them! Anyone have them HMU. 
---
This tag-team mechanic is so toxic the only reason the community isn't in a total uproar about it yet is that most people don't even bother with workshops anymore. Or when it does happen they think they got one-shot through splash damage via exploits.
---
Yeah I did the gardening for a bit (takes a lot of C.A.M.P budget) then "conveniently" every place I went had tape,so I nixed the whole garden. 
---
yeah i had adrenal when i was a rifle build. Was awesome, now it seems like bloodied isn't working that well either. 
---
Right there with ya! And super disappointed that since fallout 4 there hasn't been the option for the fallen angel hairstyle. My favorite from 3 and new Vegas. 
---
welcome to"ban"wagon 76
---
Yeah, one guy with invisibility and an explosive weapon got me at a Workshop.  Hit me twice with me in power armour (no Fireproof perk) and even spamming Diluted Stims did nothing to stop me from dying...  
---
I have no interest in PVP, it was just annoying how easy it was for him to set up an ambush and for him to kill me.
---
That's okay. Bigfoot believes in you. And so do I. :)
---
Amen
---
I worked hopped at Grafton station got the full set
---
Oooh you're right. I had forgotten about that.  It was referenced, but wasn't it actually like a Super Mutant or something? 
---
i still keep 4 of each, tato, corn, mut.  add the food gathering perk, get 8 of each.
---
but yeah, the swamps up by abby's, and other's, bunkers.  top / right part of the map.  north of thunder mountain power plant.
---
If it means anything OP I more than believe you. I can't understand all the people that can't even read your damn suspension notice where it CLEARLY states "Player has collected over xxx,xxx of an item in 30 days" and mentions nothing of having xxx,xxx of an item in your account at one time. Most of the "Debunking" things i've seen for this are all saying it's impossible to get 200k ultracite ammo all at once but none even seem to understand that's not even how Bethesda's awful detection system for duping even works, nor is it the reason for your suspension. 
---
I hope bethesda unbans you as I am another person who's been off work for over a year due to an at work injury and videogames are the only thing that's kept me going. I know if fallout 76 was one of my go-to's i would most definitely be angry getting hit with a suspension when most actual dupers that are still openly selling items in public discords go totally unpunished.   
---
As a warframe veteran who has been around since the early closed beta, give it a try. If you get into it that game is so much fun. Imagine if anthem was free and actually had content. Basically warframe.   
---
They all know the reference, but none of them understand it. 🙄
---
Idk why this just made me think of this comic [https://imgur.com/gallery/Sgkoio2](https://imgur.com/gallery/Sgkoio2)
---
Sadly, paint doesn't work that way. These walls are barn walls, they come red. I wish we could use paint like this.
---
I prefer central trade market, like was in Diablo 3 some time ago. You just choose items from inventory you want to sell (with the options of auction or buy-out) and other can buy them anytime they want. Filters will allow easy browsing and looking for exact items you want. But it won't work good if they won't raise the caps limit, it's too low in my opinion.
---
you get a lot of mods along the way just by scrapping what you find. I don't know what level you are, but armor drops a lot more often once you move past the savage divide.
---
I can't wait for player vending, I'm sitting on almost 500 of each and I'd love to have them available for like 1-2 caps apiece 
---
HACKER
---
cost me 8800 caps at harpers ferry.  just an FYI in case you did not know.
---
Sadly (at least from what I been told) that the only way Bethesda can catch dupers is if they have too many rare Legendaries. The problem with banning is dupers will always find a new way to dupe and the innocent will get punished.  
---
Is a sad reality
---
you got it.
---
I'd call them crazy role players more than griefers
---
It's called a stealth boy. Makes u invisible while moving.
---
Top 9 takeaways from the interview. You won't believe what the 4th one is!
---
1. Dupe bug that existed in Fallout 4 carried over to Fallout 76 unfixed.
---
2. Suggestion that poor drop rates of legendaries indirectly lead people to duping.
---
3. Duping does impact server performance. Not just with the act of duping but dupers carrying millions of lb of duped items just being in the game.
---
4. Someone carrying 7 million lb of duped gear was considered small time.
---
5. Duper appreciated Bethesda's solution of leaving one of every duped item in players inventory. Kept them playing.
---
6. Massive amounts of simple things had less impact on performance than same amount of more complex things e.g. junk stacks vs legendary item stacks
---
7. Duper was appreciative of temp ban wave. Required more effort than permaban that they would have expected from other games.
---
8. Real money dupers tried to entice interviewer to drive traffic to duper's ebay with discount codes. 
---
9. Duper would not dupe again even if new exploit would come up.
---
Crawlers and Yao Guai are pretty slow; how did they get the drop on you unless you were staring at the sky too? Next time just bring the fight to the other players.
---
She stated in the end of her personal story arc that she understands why they have to be nuked and agrees heavily (don't wanna spoil it so won't say but it's a pretty sad story for her)
---
Personally, I've found that you have to cram to make really nice base. I'll be posting both of mine soon, but I still have around half of budget left usually.
---
It's been like this for as long as I've known, nit just since the patch. 
---
Jeez but got offer
---
What we really need is more lore or quests with the cryptids, like a mothman cult quest taking you from Point Pleasant to the Lucky Hole Mine.
---
my fave is when you load in, start moving before your CAMP has rendered, then it renders, with you stuck in your foundation.
---
I agree, I suspect a lot of people mix the two up though.
---
Yes. Absolutely yes, coming from a TF2 veteran.
---
Honestly, we need this. We DESERVE this.
---
In my opinion Mothman PA paintjobs are ugly, I won't spend atoms for it. Currently sitting on 5k atoms and waiting for re-edition of Black bird x-01 paint or some other nice ones. Those 4 horsemen looks promising too.
---
We really do
---
This is the only reason why I still keep all my items from the Mistress of Mystery questline.
---
Very nice highlights, thank you!
---
yes. i want to rename my weapons to "dont scrap it you idiot "
---
you can look here too.  not sure if Xbox stuff is sold there.  on PC here.
---
Some communities do, yes. What did you post? 
---
If only that had been recorded, if only. I find the best things happen off-camera.
---
Thanks for this list. Annoyed though that this seems to confirmed no place sells deep pocketed mod plans outside of the marine limbs. Anyone know what places and events spawn these the most often?
---
Hopefully Bethesda actually responds to your appeal. It's making the whole community that is innocent paranoid to do anything least they be banned.
---
Yes there is. Just check your game options. 
---
I think it's already got people's attention given how many different bases you see using it on this subreddit. 
---
I don't think fixing the fire places is the way to go at it though. It gives creative freedom in ways the base game doesn't offer. 
---
I think they'll go about adding a proper way to do it, and have it not be industructable.
---
i do that too.  last night there was a fortunate level 11.  i had about 20 "known" plans on me.  dude was at his CAMP, i plunk down the plans, shoot at him, then shoot the bag, guy gets the idea, and walked away with a boatload of stuff.
---
funny thing was, he had comms on voice activation.  i heard him mutter, "holy shit!"  :-)
---
Not for the moment. 
---
I just saw the four horsemen. Definitely gonna be saving for at the least war paint job
---
Hail mothman. 
---
May all the non believers cower in the his majesty's presence! Praise be to moth-man and his perfect temple!

My Holiday Punch is renamed “It’s practically a backstab” for obvious reasons. And my crusaders crossbow is “Stimpak launcher” 
---
LOL

vendors at CAMPs has already been suggested in other threads.

---
Just pop some rad away and it’ll be gone 
---
Where is the molotov? 
---
So good! I agree with previous comments about a ramp in front of the garage. If you really want it to blend you may want to consider removing the traffic light. Otherwise it’s amazing. My CAMP is super basic in comparison 😂😭
---
Very nice.
---
Running around Whitesprings and two Yao Guai start slapping like i'm some boss enemy in beat-em-up game; got me a semi-permanent stagger state but managed to take them down(I'm a melee build).
---
Some people don't seem to gasp the meta-game behind PvP. If one is a third of my level, at 30% health and slap me with explosive, I won't bother; I won't lose 250 caps while you'd lose 70 caps. Also when I run up to him/her, they stop shooting me with the explosive, I wonder why (cough Fireproof 3 + dense armor)?
---
Ignore them, pretend you engage while pacifist, lead them around and onto mobs, make them spend precious ammo while you spend cheap ammo, etc.
---
I hawe 11 mutations. No way 
---
I keep seeing this.  Do you know where the proof was posted?
---
The same day as the patch they said they were looking at it.  But nothing further than that.
---
I was just in a 4 team SBQ squish squad. Lv 100, 130, 2x180
---
It was quite challenging, esp the random mobs. All but one had TSE as far as I can tell (one Beserkers or maybe blooded).  We were able to kill her in 28 min (1 sniper, 1 heavy, 1 shot gunner and 1 melee). It's still doable but we didn't have a bunch of lv20s hiding in the shed, it was genuinely just the 4 of us.
---
Prepare the sacrafice!
---
Agreed. I’m not interested in PvP bud, just the aluminum and lead.
---
Workshop Grafton Steel and Hemlock Holes Maintenance. Acquire these two work shops and when the event defend said workshop, there's a decent chance the attacking enemies will be anglers. 
---
I used to go there a lot but even a few weeks before the last patch i haven't found a legendary there either. Some people still say it is still good and guaranteed, inside and out, but definitely not for me, not for a while :-(
---
I can say that for me it is I have over 150 hours played, yes it has it issues and it shouldnt had been a 60$ game when it came out, but I do enjoy the game and its getting better. I would say you need to play to see if you enjoy it, dont go by slimpy all the negative reactions. Their is alot off things that I think need changes/ fixing but until now I have not had any game breaking bug. 
---
Seems like the last couple times for me there were none but I haven't ran it enough to check. I kinda figured it would get messed with. 
---
he is using southwest airlines.  
---
I was under the impression you can choose to reassign one SPECIAL point per level after 50 instead of picking a perk card.
---
It won't work, since it would mean that it would become trivial to get caps so they would have to raise the price on everything else.
---
Again, they would have to raise the price of everything else. It is trivial to get 10k of caps worth of stuff in a day....
---
At LEAST for stash management between account characters. Dont really understand why there isn't one yet. 
---
Yeah I use to do the Grafton steel mill till I got more steel from scraping guns. It's like what a 1 in 4 chance it will be anglers? The others being Mirelurks,Super mutants and mutts.
---
lol's!  +1
---
Will send u an friend request later today :) 
---
Hopefully those paintjobs will be interchangeable between armors - I use only X-01, Excavator and have ultracite set (that was free for a BoS quest), so only Plague for me?
---
because other people could be.
---
really?   news to me.  thanx.
---
Yeah they definitely nerfed it a little last patch but usually there was at least one legendary and sometimes 2 or more 3 stars. Haven’t seen any after this one tho. I’ve got most gear I want but it’s fun fighting harder enemies sometimes 
---
Some YTuber claimed it's stack up to 50%, but I don't know how he calculated it. It'll be nice if someone from BGS make a statement about it.
---
He was the guy I eventually for BOS compbat armour stuff, Love that guy.
---
Don't even repair the place, just owning it triggers the event.
---
at first it is like that, but the more holo tapes you get she start changing her mind and at the end she pushes to it, every other fictions was to use them as well. 
---
Right behind me.
---
the way I see it, the rewards are not worth all the resources you use to kill the SOB. But thats just me
---
Here for this 👌🏼
---
I would say that's a fairly common experience lol
---
lol happened to me so many times
---
Thankyou
---
I'm curious as well... 
---
i have been going on about this very idea for a month now.  imagine "snapping" CAMPS together to form towns? 
---
building towns allows the players to build "specialized" buildings.  eg.  2 CAMPs allows a brahmin pen, NOT a wimpy wheelbarrow, but an actual enclosed pen.  5 CAMPs gets you a town bazaar?  a place to store and sell stuff.
---
I went there yesterday and I had a couple of legendarys 
---
I watch captnnoob on YouTube and he put a video out yesterday or day before and 90% of the mutants were legendarys so it just depends on servers and stuff.
---
Nice
---
I think this has improved quite a bit which contradicts most of the threads on here. Are there annoyances? Yes. Could it be better? Yes. Are they actively trying to make it better? I believe so. 
---
Like the first guy said you need to invest in perk cards in this game. Unlike FO4 this forces you to specialize in 1 weapon type. That isn't to say you can have a secondary but understand your secondary will be far weaker if you want to hit hard with your primary. I actually like this. It allows you to look past items that if we were all honest we would never use. 
---
I think the main gripe I have is the lack of end game content but in all honesty I still have fun because I just run around and do random things with a buddy. We always talked about how cool it would be to play in the same world on FO4 and now we are. To me that makes up for the annoyances and quirky aspects. 
---
Thank you all for making more animal bases.
---
I'm happy to have these here.
---
Yeah, I don't understand how this hasn't happened already, with it being the only thing the community has ever asked for, and the game being entirely bug-free at the moment. 
---
tell me about it.  3 yaos. i run.........negative ghost rider!!..................staggered instead, 2nd and 3rd yao swipe and kill me.  :-(  and the worst part is, i was playing my sniper build and these clowns spawn right next to me.  tried to get to my back up weapon, shotty, but fingers can only press so many buttons at once.
---
So you are saying that you have mutations you want to keep but refuse to use starched genes to prevent losing them when curing rads? That makes no sense. You are complaining about something you have complete control of preventing. For just 2 points in luck. 
---
On another note, mutations are gathered by chance by radiation, the higher your radios the more likely you are to get a mutation, there was never a “set amount” of radiation to acquire a mutation. 
---
When I was acquiring them, sometimes it happened quickly, and sometimes it took dying of radiation a couple times. 
---
Ahhh .... WeinerMelter...  My flamer with bleeding legendary effect from fallout4.... you are sorely missed
---
The latest patch let people claim a workshop from anywhere so they couldn’t be used as barriers anymore. With that being said, workshops don’t actually have stash boxes unless you build them. The ones at train stations can’t be destroyed.
---
This would be a great idea, especially if they could intergrate it into the game so all you had to do was put the items in a special stash or something. I hate using the trade subs to try and sell stuff. To much time to take a good pic and wait for someone to buy, all while taking up precious stash space. 
---
That sounds wild, sometimes when I load into the front almost all the super mutants are in the lobby like they’re all waiting on the same job interview or something.. commence project nuka quantum grenade suicide!!
---
Nice one!!!!
---
They actually had my hairstyle in the options so I was satisfied haha 
---
Bethesda plz request. Reported. 
---
I haven't found the pump-action plan on any vendors but I've gotten it as a reward for the Patrol duty event... and I suppose it can be a world spawn in the forrest and toxic wastes also.
---
I got the double-barrel shotgun plan completing one of the Rose quests.
---
The combat shotgun plan was very rarely sold at the BoS vendor in Watoga pre-patch. I suspect that vendor still sells it.
---
it makes sense to me. I have been playing this way since the first day of release and everything was fine. and I never got a lot of mutation from a few sips of food. no matter if I have mutations or not. I think that to mutate with less than 5% of radiation on you is NOT NORMAL
---
I would be happy if they started at 200 caps which increases when we buy things.
---
So, vendor starts at 200, I buy a gun for 150 meaning the vendor now has 350 caps. I can now sell 350 worth of items to the vendor.
---
I get the PVP dynamic , that’s fine ;hell , it could definitely be the raider element this game is lacking,  but I totally agree about the  overpowered bullshit!!  
---
How are you supposed compete when slap damage is almost killing you ???
---
I’m tanky as hell,  nearly invincible to most enemies in the game but woefully inadequate when it comes to pvp - my build isn’t tailored for that type of combat -it’s built for  pve !! But trying to just walk away from a grief is nearly impossible when 1 hit and your done , Adding injury to insult  you set up a workshop just to have it stolen immediately !! You never had a chance from the get go to defend it . 
---
Like Watauga? 
---
To be fair, that's how they should introduce legendary hunting. Scrap all the guaranteed ones at Whitespring, Uranium, West Tek etc.. and just have sporadic hoards of them in totally random places. Ha ha, it would certainly make people enjoy exploring again and trying all areas of the map.
---
What do you need all that adhesive for?
---
Deffo been nerfed or something, me and a m8 cleared the place out several times in a row and got no legendary drops
---
I've got 6 of each and 10  small purifiers.
---
It would be unbalanced to be able to idly make the same amount an active scavenger could and you know it. The deposits are balanced
---
Thank you, really good place to build. I would love to have a place like that to chill.
---
This is very helpful. Thanks! 
---
I dont see the pump shotty plan in there? I desperatly need this on my new character.
---
I can confirm that the vendor bot at Welch has the plan (albeit rarely). I had to world hop about six times before it showed up. 
---
Yeah I've notices you have to scrap a lot more armour to learn things. Especially if you're after dense torso which seems to be last on the learning list.
---
Join the Brotherhood of Steel and cleanse Appalachia of raider scum!
---
Repairs mostly and builds. I like to keep the essentials at 100
---
That sucks. I know what it's like to get game angry. Gamry. 
---
I wish. So I just leave it on 
---
I only use a legendary gauss rifle in fo4. What's, "the gun" in this game. I'm currently lvl 20, maybe.
---
Looks like K-9!
---
The people who were enjoying it were likely busy playing.
---
Or aware that in certain places to deviate from the anti 76 sentiment was to open yourself up to a bunch of hassle.
---
How do you know this?
---
What does the inside look like?
---
The Confederate Hat is now craftable as of patch 6, but only if you read the plan after patch 6. If you read it before patch 6 the plan will show as known but if cannot be crafted. 
---
I'm always annoyed by the lack of longer hair in Bethesda games. I  get physics makes them usually look wonky + clipping, but c'mon.
---
Looks good
---
Banjo was framed!
---
Justice for Banjo!
---
I'd say the notification should default to yield. 
---
You are afk, missed the notification and you didn't answer? Too bad. You're now depossessed of your workshop, but at least you don't risk getting one shot by a player you never met and who has engaged PvP with you without your knowledge.
---
Well I'm a rifleman so maybe I can help here. 
---
Energy weapons aren't that great yet but they are supposed to be fixing them. Gauss is kind of the exception but... I believe the lever is where it's at. It's the highest damage output but you sacrifice ammo capacity, something you can combat with a double or quad varient but you should be used to it since you use gauss in FO4. Next is probably Handmade which helps with ammo capacity. I basically run with a lever as my go to, Handmade when theres a group, and a Hunting Rifle for when I want to stay way back. Combat rifles are decent too. 
---
Possibly a texture errror due to the Atomic Shop glitch. Some if not all items in the Atomic Shop have been showing up as weird colors (for example, my teammates said my Black PipBoy was actually a neon pink).
---
Also I was banned after 840h of play. My teammates and I used to pass items from the main  to the mule chars
---
That's why I wear a mask 24/7. Usually skeleton mask . Would love some flowing locks and crazy braids. 
---
I have been getting them from treasure maps although well over 100 maps I only got the plans 4 times.
---
You can put lipstick on a mirelurk, but it's still a mirelurk.
---
Similarly, you can try and justify griefing, but it's still griefing.
---
I understand how rocket-turret-farms can be annoying to grinders, but for those who truly enjoy CAMP building, the Greenbriar Golf Green is a massive, flat, green area that perfectly allows the more pre-War building tiles to blend into their environment. It looks nice and is even used as the location for some Atomic Shop CAMP items.
---
And if you've built a nice place, you'll logically want some turrets (or one turret because hot damn those bad boys take up an ungodly amount of CAMP budget) to protect it.
---
Then some player comes along and destroys it so he can level up a few more times to do... Whatever grinders do. 
---
I'm not gonna defend turret farms which make things less fun for everyone. But an innocuous home on the Green can surely be given a pass, right?
---
We're all reasonable people, are we not?
---
True, kinda makes me feel bad for new players tho because they’re  gonna have to grind so much harder lol
---
I'M FUCKING WHEEZING
---
OH MY GOD
---
this is amazing
---
Peter Dinklage style!
---
Just like King Canute lol
---
This is precisely why I wrote this post.
---
It would be great if they simply auto removed and reapplied mutations after patches to avoid problems like this, but I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that there must be technical reasons for why this is not done already.
---
So would King Canute.
---
Ofc I have AR. I decided not to re-apply mutation because people were saying it doesn't work at all after that. Also, I don't have a spare serum and didn't want to spend resources on it to get more potential bugs.
---
Well, I guess I'll just wait 'till they fix it somehow. Thanks for clarification.
---
Nope, if you **could** read I said if you're on PS4 it'd be easy enough to scroll through your error log and capture video of it... But you won't... Because your number is bullshit and you won't admit to just exaggerating for the sake of exaggerating. 
---
340 hours or so and I have under 60 blue screens (give or take). 
---
If you have more than almost 30x that amount, your PS4 is fucked, not the game. But, you don't have almost 30x that amount, do you?
---
You thought you'd be a smarmy little fuckboy spreading false information to fuel the narrative that the game is shit.
---
No, it's not perfect... Far fucking from it. But harp on its actual problems,  not make believe bullshit you spew.
---
Crashing a problem? Count the crashes. I guarantee saying you had 40 would suffice in showing crashing **is** a problem. Fallout 76 has crashed more than every other game I've played since launch combined. That's a problem. 
---
This is a great place to camp too, there is a junk pile near the shack with the bees nests so honey as well, plus you have corn, tato I haven't found mutfruit though. No water for boiling unless you put down a pump.    
---
Is the fireproof perk that powerful.? Only just maxed it out but haven't been near hostile scorch beasts since...
---
I usually try to avoid them 
---
It’s so funny you say that now, I just met someone ingame literally just yesterday who was collecting outfits and he offered to buy it from me since it doesn’t work. Then he made me the hat that I’ve been waiting for since beta!
---
You know, I give those houses a pass whenever I see them. An actual place you've put time and effort into, in a nice area- it's everything you want. Other people, not so much. Even outside of the whitespring! I found a nice little spot near the nuka-cola plant to set up camp, built a lovely pre-war house with garage, put up a filthy tribute to Mothman - and within an *hour* it was being attacked by  a level 70 greifer. My doors weren't locked, I left a stash outside for people to use - he attacked my home for no other reason than to make me fight back.  
---
Never discount what an asshole is willing to do.
---
how about a mutation called "padded trigger finger" increases gun accuracy by 10% and reduces gun condition drain by 20%. but lowers your melee damage by 40% (10% if using class freak rank 3)
---
I've only seen DCG plans drop from high level Deathclaws at a very low rate.  Sledgehammer is a semi rare plan on high level Super Mutants and also can be found as a random spawn in areas that used to be occupied by raiders(so most of the Savage Divide, as well as Big Bend Tunnel).  Super Sledge on the other hand is just as rare a drop as DCG, but drops from high level Super Mutants; however, unlike DCG, it can be found as a semi rare spawn in areas where super mutants frequently spawn.
---
It is rather easy, yeah- you just gotta place the fireplace before placing the roof pieces is all! I honestly believe that the fireplace was intended for half-wall usage, because the chimney will actually be outside.
---
only quest left for me to do, and  I cant get them to spawn. 
---
Also I was banned after ~840h of play. My teammates and I used to pass items from the main to the mule chars
---
Ok thanks for letting me know 
---
The problem with 76 right now isn't people like Jim Stirling, it's that Bethesda's reputation has nosedived to the point where people treat them like a joke,unwilling to believe that they can fix 76. Even if (or hopefully WHEN) they do fix it, their rep will take much longer to fix. People like to laugh at the misfortune of others-something Bethesda is learning all too well. Yeah, I think he cheated but right now I'm not confident that everyone who got banned did so too.
---
Except there's entire videos of him playing it. 
---
That idea would be wonderful- in this case, my little Helvetia would go from a hamlet, to a proper town sure enough!
---
Can I join this bussiness on PS4?
---
It’s just a regular camp inside, workbenches, water purifiers, etc. Outside is all form, inside is all function.
---
If they had more primitive furnishings (torches, wall tapestries, candlabras) I have definitely given it a more fantasy design inside.
---
time to switch some points into luck cause you all out of it dude.
---
Pete Hines is a dickhead.
---
Nah, most of the gaming "journalists" at least attempt to show some objectivity and occasionaly are actually objective. Jim just assumes that everything allegedly done by AAA company is true and that everything done by AAA company is done for the worst reasons imaginable. Because Ay Ay Ay == bad.
---
I ran it last night and had a two star.
---
For my first (and only) Scorchbeast killed I add a scar on my face. Good fight.
---
I love this
---
Honestly, you can get a reasonable amount built if you ignore defense and crops. And as others have pointed out, build smarter, use existing structures or landscape.
---
I used the Sim Settlements mod on FO4 and could see the direct impact of larger settlement budgets. Unless you own a high end PC, any budget increases to the CAMP could potentially neuter the frame rate and cause a much larger range of frame spikes for everyone on a server.
---
They have to temper camp budgets so that the game still has reasonable performance on consoles. When private servers become a thing, so will camp budget mods. But I'd only use them on PC if you care about stable performance.
---
I've only seen them as random spawns in the Savage Divide, usually in the raider camps(saw a few T-45 and T60 PA/mod plans along there too), didn't bother picking them up though, as it was on a character that had already learned Dense via scrapping and didn't use PA.
---
So why don't people apply it to Bethesda too?  For too many people here Bethesda is guilty the moment something less-then-amazing happens to this game or around this game. And many consider Bethesda guilty even after their innocence gets proven. So where I'm concerned, gamers just got a taste of their own medicine...
---
Just to add to that, if the average number of players per server is less than what they budgeted for (24-32 I think) they could increase camp budget by 10-20% and cap max players to 20 or so. I rarely see more than a dozen or so players per server
---
I'm not sure because I was paying more attention to AD reaction (it is easier to tell if it is working correctly because of the damage display). In the process of removing and reapplying AD I had to do the same for speed demon, and both are working properly as a result.
---
It would be nice if Bathesday would auto remove/reapply mutations after updates, or at least make it easier for users to do so.
---
Hypocrisy? 
---
I assure you that I thoroughly researched and tested my fix (and that it is still working upon logging in 6 hours later).
---
Just flare guns. drill and syringer are still there. At least I’m pretty sure I’d have to re read the specific patch notes but I’m too lazy lmao. 
---
It’s me as well and I don’t have atomic show stuff. 
---
It would, but I doubt that they will go for it.
---
This flat out doesn't work. I've been trying to get the game to let me loot corpses for more than five minutes. 
---
Atom shop opens instantly. 
---
Yeah just got a one star on my 9th run, definitely seems nerfed to me but like others have said, prob for the best idk
---
I had a team that used to do speed runs on the queen. Lately we've been nuking the queen, killing only adds, and waiting until after the fight to get some PvP in. We had one queen fight that seemed like she was going to slip away, but one of our guys switched characters and finished her off in the last 5 minutes. I don't think anything has changed for her survivability
---
I do think her hit box has shrunk down a bit though. 
---
Nope. 
---
I’m tried to add a picture but it wouldn’t let me lol
---
🤣🤣🤣 sweet jesus lol
---
So the AI for Raiders is realistic afterall. Wow, what a sad testament of human intelligence.
---
wrong subreddit. 
---
west-tek has never produced a single multi-star legendary for me, and it only ever produced normal legendaries about every fifth pass...that spot was over-hyped from day one for some reason.
---
I'm sorry to hear that. The amount of people who just want to make other people unhappy is just shameful. Hopefully the people who think they're playing Fallout: Battle Royale will migrate to the Survival Mode.
---
This doesn't really affect me, my base is a two minute run from Whitesprings, not close enough to turret-farm the Ghouls. But people constantly defend destroying bases and prance around like heroes or something like "I have a great big fatman and Wrecking Ball, lets go destroy some bases at whitesprings, boy we're so great!"
---
Or "I destroyed an innocent CAMP because it's neat a rare vendor spawn and I'm too lazy to server jump, it's their fault for building near a random vendor for convenience, I'm the good guy!"
---
Griefers are bad, but self-righteous griefers are somehow worse
---
I can build you one. What platform?
---
i like them all, but definitely war the most. Too bad its for t45. 
---
Lol this is a game with giant bats and mole people, nothing about this game is normal! Honestly kind of a pointless post, if you don’t want to invest the points in luck then you’ve gotta live with the consequences sorry m8. Try cooking your food then you’ll get no rads from them. 
---
Long dog? You can VATs long dog now. Killed him both in melee and with a rifle
---
Yeah. Jim has become the very thing he dislikes - he's become destructive force in the industry. He doesn't help anything, he doesn't support anyone, he doesn't fight FOR anything. He just fights against all and everything AAA just for the sake of it (and some click on top of it). He only produces hate that drives a wedge between gaming communities. And he'd say anything to strengthen his point. For him "objectivity" is a swear word as severe as "AAA". Really, he'd do gaming a big service if he relocated to a remote island without internet connection and took his mindless hive of drooling sycophants with him...
---
Maybe Bethesda shouldn't release an online game in an broken, unplayable, exploitable state. 
---
Even a beta should have higher standards than what they released as a full game.
---
Lmao this guy is trying so hard to circlejerk for some free karma 
---
Look bud, no ur not getting karma for saying if someone buys the game the game for you, you wont touch it
---
Also, using a stereotypical fanboy and saying if u love this game so much u might have a copy to give me
---
Ur not getting your free karma smh
---
For about a month I had multiple 3 stars almost every time I went, definitely got some of my best gear there. Guess it’s just a little more random now which I’m cool with, was just trying to see if this was another silent nerf by Bethesda. 
---
Corpses despawn
---
Also an event that was completed ten minutes ago? Ofc it didn't load its already completed. Lmao why would it load if it's done?
---
Damn it still stands as (known) do you know if i can swap plans with another player and then use it??
---
"Oh yeah?! Well, DUCK YOU!" - OP... probably...
---
You're using mutation build but don't use starched gene then got the nerve to come here with nonsensical complaint?
---
Goddamn can this sub even have quality whining thread anymore? 
---
Exactly. I'd guess that nowadays he's more damaging to the state of the gaming more than many of the business practices he criticises. If anything he promotes hate among gamers. His narrative is no longer "AAA is bad". He's shifted into "Anyone who plays and supports AAA is bad". And of course this gained him a devout following that is based on schadenfreude and the feeling of superiority...
---
Nope Xbox 
---
My God that beautiful.
---
Pardon me while I steal that idea. (I suck at decorating)
---
Makes you feel like you're in a Wasteland huh. 
---
There was a bug towards the beginning of release where Xbox’s would freeze up when opening perk packs, looks like its back. 
---
I honestly haven’t had trouble with the queen since the patch besides getting disconnected but I found out that was cause of my targeting hud on my PA. 
---
You said you’re pretty balanced between melee and rifle.. imo you’re leaving a lot of damage on the table unless you specialize into one specifically. Make sure you have the tenderizer perk and bloody mess to maximize damage and try to pop chems and bobble heads before you battle the queen. With that many people there her HP must’ve been really high and if even a few people weren’t pulling their weight she’ll be super tough. 
---
As for whitesprings I’ve heard that all those meat piles really cause lag on the server and that’s probably why you got disconnected, also Tesla rifles make me disconnect so much I never use them anymore. 
---
Sorry that happened to you I know it can be real frustrating, hopefully they can patch some of this soon. 
---
The last couple times I've run the sbq there's been a 10 minute time usually at 1/3 health down where she doesn't take any damage at all, after that time it's normal fight, if you can get her to land instead of just flying round the map getting her frequently flyer miles.
---
Damage wise tho, before patch a power hit with my super sledge would take 5-10mm off her health depending on buffs active per hit, could literally take half her health in one round of power hits.
---
Now it's like 1mm per hit. Her defense seems to be set much better now, she should be hard to kill and take 20 mins to down her instead of 30 seconds, but they need to fix when she bugs out and doesn't take damage.
---
Right? I thought the same. 
---
With all the bricks and discolored image i couldn't find it... but your character seems in big terror of all the bugs he has seen.
---
Bet they have bonuses if multiple horseman are in a team. I can't wait to find out
---
Like only women care about the hairstyle of their characters!  
---
I like really long hair god damnit!  
---
It happened to me a couple times and there was a reason I think. First time I'd been a little too "smart" with how I put down my camp, sort of glitching things where they shouldn't go, so when the game tried to place down my CAMP again of course it didn't like it. Second time I realized I'd placed it partially over a world border, so it didn't want to place it down. 
---
Read - "I don't think I've once held more than 36,000 ammo at one time. 36,000 being a very specific number I am stating as that was the rough amount of 5mm ammo I had collected."
---
I think it's more an issue with Bethesda's exploitation detection than with people actually duping.
---
I prefer to give people the benefit of the doubt. It would seem like you prefer to jump to conclusions, based on what you've said here. 
---
"He cheated. Oh well." &amp; "Bethesda nailed him fair and square." &amp; " Turns out he was a cheater all along."
---
Unless you have insider knowledge, you forgot to verify your claim that it "turns out he was a cheater all along". Don't make claims you can't back up with hard facts.
---
What does making mods have to do with this guy getting banned for duping? I googled you and it says you made a bug fix mod for new Vegas. Is that it? What does that have to do with anything? Explain to me why you want me to look you up so bad please. 
---
Any normal online game 
---
&gt;Sell to any vendor, vendors evewrywhere, they got all the money they need for your stuff
---
Fallout 76
---
&gt;Vendors aren't common and they have 200 caps together to buy your stuff
---
Like... why?
---
Thanks for the clarification. I guess this ones a no go for me. 
---
Jim has become a caricature of himself. He no longer fights for customers and for improving of the industry. Originally I liked him because he dared to stand against the FaNVboys and rated Fallout 4 9.5/10. Well, overtime he found out that schadenfreude, controversy and boosting his viewers superiority ego will make him more money than being fair and objective. I stopped following him when he raved about "year of the lootbox" and blamed lootboxes (all lootboxes!!!) on Blizzard's fair implementation. Really, how many video he's made about lootboxes and Blizzard? And how many videos he's made about employee abuse at CDPR? If he was fair, he'd adress the biggest issue the most often and he'd rip CDPR a new one on a weekly basis... But no, because he's nothing more than a clown who feasts on hate and negativity. He's the worst of the worst in the gaming industry. I concede that folks like Kotick and whatever asshole drives CDPR, but most of AAA CEOs and managers are better than him.

It might have been really funny, and seem stupid, but it was 5 on 1, and they had two guys near my level, 1 higher. Most would think they could have taken me down with odds like that. If they had just scanned patiently with a recon scope or looked for a red marker when passing their crosshairs over me, I would have been found out and brought down. If they had done that I would have run off. I don't have tough armor, so any one of them could have killed me. Their biggest mistake, worse than coming back in revenge mode and not cutting their losses, was the open mike chat. I knew about anything they were about to try because they were broadcasting it to me. I guess the morals of the story are: Stay on team chat, know when to cut your losses, and be careful who you attack. haha

By having 100.000 of said items are just a ton of different legendaries?

He said if anyone would buy his copy of it, not that he wanted someone’s copy of it, I thought it said that too, but reread first
---
Since last patch i have lots of freezes after a loadscreen. This bugs me the most.
---
I hope this gets fixed soon, because i still enjoy the game :(
---
OP did not post all info.  Dont want to call you idiot, but check other postings concerning the issues.  Someone posted screen shot of the exact numbers of ammo in the 30 days prior to this post.   The OP is trying to mislead.   
---
Most of my runs I get legendary mutants. Best I ever had was 4 legendary. 2 2* and 2 3*.
---

Exactly what I'm saying. Makes no damn sense. 
---
Nah, the first one is a suggestion, the second and third are the consequences of respectively not implementing it and implementing it poorly. :-)
---
I use t51b, X01 and excavator. I collected each set, but I'm not gonna  wear a set that underperforms compared to those 3 for the task i chose them for. Its too bad. now if we can display our sets at our camps I'll buy war for sure.
---
My only complaint on hair is the one with the sides and back shaved with the top sweeped to one side (don't know the name of the style despite actually having it at one point irl) looks like crap when you wear a hat, one little piece shows and the rest is hidden under your hat.  I have an available accessory section for cosmetic purposes I am using it dammit which means I can't use that hair because then it won't look good.
---
Theres nothing new in the game since launch
---
I’d say 13 points in perception, all the damage perks and the tank killer perk and maybe concentrated fire if you like vats, rank 3 tenderizer in charisma, and then I do rank 3 bloody mess, and there’s some other perk in luck that lets you cripple limbs with rifles. Other than that it just depends on if you use vats and QOL and things 
---
I don't doubt they will add that feature in the future. Though with missing black bird. I won't give myself the opportunity to miss it. I'll buy all of them as soon as I see them.
---
Get rid of it and get it again. Worked for me
---
Terminals yes, locks most of the time. I leveled up with picking and I never found anything mind blowing in a safe. I dont think were missing out on much by not hot swapping
---
For the longest time, I had the cards equipped.. then I started playing end game stuff when I had nothing else to explore after discovering every single location. I unequipped them all, si vw I found they really don't give you anything good, even with a 3* lock, and terminals sometimes help get into a room I want to loot. I put them on if I need them, a d take them right off
---
Just read it from multiple sources. junkie, furious and bloodied all have the 50% cap. Aftet the TSE nerf they are the highest damage potential weapons but all have qualifiers
---
RE SBQ: ran her twice last night and both times were utter shit shows. She no longer spams sonic attacks but she also doesn't take much damage and flies away from attackers more so than I ever remember.  There were tons of 3\* ground fodder, so now what used to be a bunch of low level people hiding in the shed or safe up on a roof are guys 100 and above  ignoring the queen and pot shotting all the legendary guys from a distance. 
---
I gave up the second go around because my weapons were nearly broken and with five minutes left she had just regenerated her health while a gaggle of high level players were just chilling on the roof waiting for the event to end so they can collect the loot their pot shots entitled them too. 
---
GIVE ME PIGTAILS WITH BANGS OR GIVE ME DEATH
---
I laughed reading it :)
---
Ahhh so cool!
---
Gonna have to make my own cool base, I’m feeling inspired. (The fact that your name is Ducky too is ADORABLE)
---
If they did that some boring ass youtuber could make another video how this game is pay to win. 
---
Lol. Tried almost everyday since release with no luck. Until a few days ago where I got 2 in one day. RNG is weird like that.
---
I've found bos combat armor plans after patch 5 in a safe
---
That's better than a lot of others I've seen. I started to notice the weird faces after a patch in January. My character started to get black, pink, white, and grey patches.. almost like a scrambled TV channel
---
Who cares what the boring ass YouTubers do. They obviously don't realize that the effects aren't game breaking. 
---
At this point the only people left are the loyalists so to speak. And it won't phase us at all. Unless they're a snowflake. In which case they obviously have bigger problems.
---
I haven't equipped terminal cards in 70 or so levels and only equip the lockpick when I know there is loot that spawns behind the door is worth looting.  If it was one I might use it more often but shuffling out three cards all the time is just not worth it.
---
I noticed this several times the other day
---
You've left the dirt cosmetic on their face.
---
That quackers
---
After I've done most challenges requiring terminals/safes I pass it, but sometimes I do 3lvl locks - they may contain random treasure maps and plans, which can be valuable. All lower level locks I pass.
---
cool, but the garage its too high with no road access
---
Love it! Love the creativity and the time you put into it. Well done!
---
Hmmm.  It usually ends with you getting one shot and taking your junk.  
---
These dudes sound RP
---
Definitely seems nerfed, there always used to be a legendary outside, I couldn't find him. You can still get it, just less. 
---
I stated to see it after a patch in January. Either faces are black, or a mix of pink, grey, white, green, black, etc. Atom shop stuff has nothing to do with it.. my face is the same way, and I have nothing from the shop
---
They made it easier for the attackers, but if they follow your suggestion nobody would defend them, because right now workshop are pretty much useless.
---
It's a bug. Waiting on hotfix
---
“Treasurer of my party” so that’s what they call duped goods storage lockers now?  😂. Sounds to me like u got duper-duped 😜😉
---
So do you just walk around all the time overencumbered? Carrying everyone’s stuff they find but they are too TLC Hoarders to throw it away?
---
I believe this to be true. I'm right up next to Mama Dolce's and I frequently get the notice. Just server hop till it can be placed and go on CAMPing
---
BuT bEThesDa LieD tO uS!!!!!
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I had a SBQ drop a couple of X01 mod plans the last time we took her down. 
---
I got two of the hacker cards from packs, so I thought that I might as well get the last one. I have no lockpicking cards.
---
It's a bit annoying that you can't do anything about duped cards; I have a fully ranked Hard Bargain, what am I supposed to do with my spare 1-star HB? They can't be equipped at the same time.I got two of the hacker cards from packs, so I thought that I might as well get the last one. I have no lockpicking cards.

---
😂😂😂. Bye
---
I'm with you.  OP what are you talking about?  Server hopping doesn't reset vendor cap quotas...  That would be subject to sooooo much abuse.
---
It's already released?
---
I love to fear them, we need more scary mobs! 
---
yep pretty waste of time to put in the 3 card and later when u got some junk set back the original config.
---
There are teams that hunt workshop owners. I hear less about them as I suspect that many were in the banned group or grew bored of the game and quit.
---
We need more players like this.  I have excess plans, ammo and even some aid items, I'm at the lower end of caps, the most I ever have on me is 2,500 and I'm constantly buying new plans because I'm a crafting build, so I usually try and sell stuff, I haven't left anything outside the vault in quite a while.  I think I'll do that tomorrow, maybe even see if any of my friends want to drop some stuff as well. 
---
If any lower levels are seeing this I'd be more than happy to build you some level appropriate gear with good mods, provided I have the resources or you accompany me farming, I'll keep you alive (or watch your junk bag for you provided I fail) but if I'm farming the junk for your new gear you can at least join me in chat and accompany me.
---
I think you should open a support ticket. 
---
Yes!!!! So sick of loading from fast traveling to Whitesprings service entrance just to load again into the bunker
---
&gt; just presumed innocence
---
How dare they.
---
Guessing they were atom shop floors and atom items aren't working well at all
---
Im going go name my next plasma gatling find this exact thing... if this becomes a thing
---
Dude same
---
Like exactly the same...
---
Can we skip the fight for dominance and go straight to starting the beer hat / bottle cap glasses / veil of secrets club?
---
Upvoted for proper use of aint
---
2 really bugs me. Legendaries are supposed to be hard to get. Resorting to cheating because you didn’t get the ones you want fast enough just sounds like a bratty teenager temper tantrum thing to do. 
---
I open everything, all the time mostly for plans.
---
Yep, missing fake grass, shag carpet and black floors.
---
*Woah!* It's your **4th Cakeday** getbackjoe94! ^(hug)
---
&gt;	they are trying to slowly soften people up the the idea of buffs being buyable in the atom shop.
---
Give. Me. A. Fucking. Break. 
---
I'll do terminals for the stories but cba with safes. Maybe if they had bobbleheads or magazines in. 
---
No kidding.
---
Honestly I never care about character creation because I always play in first person mode, and secondly I always have a hidden face anyway from a hat and glasses and bandana. 
---
I know, but when you're starting and legendary weapons are not that common (basically because you can't go or don't know about Whitesprings yet) it's really helpful though....
---
It's an all out animal war. 
---
What will be next?
---
Lol fair but thought I'd just let you know :)
---
Yeah. So Perhaps its best to \*not\* defend workshops anymore when notified and view it after its taken to see if its a player or "unowned".   If unowned, then you know it was mobs attacking. If it has another player, it was PVP.
---
Locks yes, but sometimes I hack terminals, because of the trophy.
---
biggest disappointment ever
---
if u have mods installed the atom floors dun work solution can be found here
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ascrs3/pc_no_floors_in_camp_after_patch/
---
It doesn't help that every safe I come across is either completely empty or has Pre-War Money (6).
---
A few patches ago, they seemed to have fucked containers as a whole.  Used to be able to get weapons and ammo from duffle bags.  For me, that all only contain pre-war money all the time.  Most toolboxes and crates are 100% empty.
---
I know they nerfed the refill of them, but for me they simply stay empty now.
---
Yep. If I/we were new 50s who never found, bought or traded up the armor piece would be fine. But most of us are not, and it isn't ; )
---
Well that sucks.  Did it not land in time or just not really do any damage?
---
Troy: *hhhhmmmmmm*
---
Yep, I think I ended up with one legendary outside 2 inside
---
Yesss! I always go back to the same one, the mid length style with a fringe, but I would like that one with longer hair!
---
looks good 0 dmg
---
Wow, that was recently? I've seen those crews up to last week. I'm sure they're still doing their thing and agree, they are fast (bloodied builds). 2-3 mins tops. Makes me wonder what they see. now given the issues with bloodied and odd-to-me SBQ characteristics.
---
I dont mean to be a douche, but what sources? I see a lot of people claim stuff like this, but its usually just guesswork from testing it by looking at the damage meter on the enemies. I would love to have a more credible source, preferable from Bethesda. 
---
That's why I completely stopped taking workshops.
---
A player will initate taking it, find you on the map, and kill you.  After it's initiated, the PVP doesn't ever disengage.  It stays until they either finish taking the workshop, you take it back, or one of you leave the server.
---
Assholes discovered this little trick and now will use it all the time.
---
And like you said, they will see who owns it, find you on the map, send friends to you, and cordinate to attack the monet they start taking it.
---
The PVP for workshops should ***ONLY*** be contained within the build area of the workshop.  If the agressor or defender is not within that circle, PVP is cancelled.
---
I once handed a low level a lvl 25 Fatman and 20 mininukes, and all he gave me was the "?!?" emote and left without looting my bag :(
---
Guy who knows hes completely innocent here.  No, not worried at all.
---
I would prefer the default be to yield. You could be afk or somewhere else and the default should never be to initiate pvp.
---
Yes SBQ always heals at half to 30% health as do most legendaries unless you slay them quick
---
yep, changed after patch though no mention in patch notes.
---
I was lucky and got it as a workshop plan if you feel like grinding them
---
Nice,  dont have mods but do have Fallout76custom.ini
---
Added the details to it and it worked a charm.  Thanks kindly.
---
I lost a quarter of my brain cells reading this. 
---
But you do see the issue of making those bots farmable?  It’s a common MMO approach to ‘guards’ and such a practice that has been around since the beginning and for a good reason.  
---
u can buy it from vendor phoenix.
---
While we are on this subject wtf is a weak ass shack door,r rusty ass safe Gona do vs me in what I can only assume is a suit of armor that weighs nearly a ton? Why cant I just smash/rip this shit down and see what's inside? I hate that mini game picking lock shit. It's annoying as all hell. 
---
no one test stuff like this on enemies. People test damage numbers on friends/other players.
---
Thank u, next
---
zealot's doesn't work on SB or SBQ. It only works on enemies with a prefix of scorchED.
---
Oh. That makes sense. I never thought of that, as I dont have any (in the game) . lol. Thanks!
---
There's not a single hairstyle with long hair. The longest you can get is the "Elegant" (Nora) style.
---
That's a bummer, not for me though, I like short hair. 
---
That broken, rotten, wooden half-door was made with quality West Virginia Lumber.
---
You can farm them at the Blackwater Mine near White Springs, here are the steps:
---
1) clear the mole miners
---
2) sit in the puddle of irradiated water until you mutate
---
3)equip the Starcged Genes Perk
---
4) go inside the mine
---
5) use the decontamination shower to clear rads
---
6) remove Starched Genes
---
7) hop servers
---
8) rinse and repeat
---
My friend and I did this and within an hour (including times of lag, extre respawns and server crashing) we got every mutation in game other than Herbivore, because we had already gotten Carnivore.  Only downside is it's really easy to mess up and lose your progress.  I forgot to have Starched Genes equipped and lost 5 mutations I had paid for from the showers.  It sucked.
---
Dats racis
---
If you want to do PvE then buy a PvE game.
---
I have a carnivorous mutation and I cooked this meat. but each goes for 5 radiation
---
**I open every lock I see**.. I have a daily route of safes as well! :) It's like a mini-game I enjoy playing daily.
---
I also like to think that I'm doing a good deed, since other people will be able to harvest the loot without the need to equip those 3 cards manually.. Low level players also can benefit from that greatly.
---
**Terminals**, however**..** not so fond of them, since there's no real reward for solving them + it's much more annoying. Sure, you can open a closed safe sometimes, but it's far more efficient to actually open that safe manually.
---
I know that many people are against **mods**, but there's a pretty solid mod, that allows you to switch between multiple perk load-outs with a single click of a button.
---
Same for men. The male long hairs suck
---
I need long hair not in an updo! There were mods on FO4 and I don't care if it clips but I want it!
---
What do you mean by overlay?
---
I went here and I found a vengeful mothman!!! So exciting! Thank you! 
---
I've used AAE combat rifle, and currently use AAE Handmade. I have to admit, with all the reduce recoil modifications, it's a beast. Almost zero recoil.
---
Now didn't they say it would be 4-6 months ETA?  Why are you asking at the halfway point?
---
Yes I see the edge of that. If I increase the resolution even more I can even see some other pop ups outside the screen as they are waiting there to be used by the game.
---
My favorite is logging on and being someplace like the Whitespring.
---
Cars load, etc. start moving towards the club house. 
---
Grab the game from the ground. 
---
Move to open the door.
---
“You have contracted Rad Worms”
---
....
---
I know what this means by now; this means I’m zoned in and the ghouls have spawned and they are hitting me but are still silent and invisible. The hits haven’t registered yet, but the rad worms are there because rad worms are really the boss monster in this game. So I walk to a wall and put my back to it and get ready to get some XP in a kind of hectic way.
---
Go to the fallout 76 community home page, press the three dots if you’re on mobile and press change community flair 
---
Also, if you would get in trouble and get banned, is it possible to appeal it to get enabled again if you have actually not done anything wrong? (like if you use reshade just to make the game look prettier)
---
If you read what I wrote you would see that I pretty clearly said I was the workshop owner and he had NOT contested it.
---
Never heard about the 4-6 month ETA. Just curious as I never received any updates after posting my ticket in December.
---
Radaway:diluted INCREASES your chance for diseases, not buffs against it.
---
But that doesn't really matter, because mutations are not diseases. Startched Genes is the only thing that can buff against/prevent mutations.
---
&gt;Please do not be a noob and read carefully. I dnot writing here because simply received a mutation without a perk, but because it gives less than 5% of radiation. this is a new mechanic patch №6 and it is terrible
---
If it's one where there is a chance you will get a a warning that you are risking catching a disease by sleeping in it. Just like the toxic air or swimming warning.
---
My Bloodied deathclaw gauntlet does around almost almost 2k per swing. And I can swing it almost 3 times per second. I don't know about adding ultracite melee weapons.
---
Got a tse double barrel max lvl from west tek the day after patch 6
---
25% more damage supposedly.
---
&gt;I hope you have insurance
---
That makes no sense...
---
Radaway decreases your disease resistance, it has no effect on getting new mutations (it actually cures them on each use when you don't have starched gene lvl2 perk equipped).
---
Rad-X suppresses your existing mutations for its duration (10 minutes). I doubt it stops you from getting new ones when it's effect is on. 
---
Only starched genes lvl2 perk stop you from mutating and that's a perk card you can always take if. 
---
Are one of the people getting a replacement bag?

Great now they're gonna nerf Handmades thanks a lot 
---
The day patch 6 dropped I removed and re added adrenal reaction and it’s been working fine ever since, lots of hours of gaming and no issues. You don’t know wtf you’re talking about.
---
Two ideas:
---
One
---
Base access to locks and terminals to character level, use the levels as described in the perk cards but not needing to equip the card itself.
---
A ‘force lock’ option that would give a percentage chance of opening without having to mess around with the mini game
---
something like the following mechanic:
---
Level 1 lock
---
Character level (maxed to 50) x 2
---
Gives 2% to 100% chance force opening
---
Level 2 lock
---
Character level (maxed to 50) x 1.5
---
Gives 1.5% to 75% chance force opening
---
Level 3 lock
---
Character level (maxed to 50) x 1
---
Gives 1% to 50% chance force opening
---
Armor perks + 5% per item equipped
---
Pretty much. Nice explosion. No noticeable effect on her health. Maybe clearing some of the weaker adds...

This is a great story and I enjoyed reading it but I have to question the intelligence of the players. 
---
Heading up to the highest point was your very first thought and throughout all this none of the other 5 had considered you might be up there with the exception of one guy who wandered past you once! 
---
Sounds like you've taken advantage of a few kids initially then they've called their friends from Roblox or Minecraft to help take you down.
---
Shame on you bro /s
---
 Now a hundred other people will build there and it won’t load your settlement! Happens to me way too often 
---
That's awesome nice job live doing stuff like this. What did u mean bye grenades that's detect you? Could u explain that? Also does he shot crit not vats kill enemies well even with sentinal asassin?
---
Wait for me! I'm home around 7.
---
Yes!! and weapon displays and maybe armor and power armor displays as well? 
---
Lolz
---
I suggest that if you or anyone else does not fully understand the language in aTOS, ELA, or any legally binding document, that you stop and ask someone more informed then you, to translate.
---
Have you checked for updates versions of the mods? They get broken almost every patch 
---
Ah gotcha. My bad,  ive never had a mutation and saw there some good ones for melee 
---
I've looked at that perk thinking it was useless until today when I found out it was useful against TSE weapons, definitely picking that up next, along with maxing out that Solar Powered perk, since I've got 6 Endurance.  I don't really need my food and drink perks anymore since I have so much Ionized Meat and Purified Water along with the Carnivore Mutation.
---
Neat site, never heard of it. Thanks!
---
You forget the fact that the handmade is a butt **ugly** weapon. I refused to use one on my rifle build for a very long time, for this reason. Then suddenly had a two shot drop and a furious one at the same day. Had to try them out and they are admittedly great guns. 
---
You did not mention the granpa gun; the lever action. I carry one of those as well, for less intense situations. 
---
Between the handmade and the lever, I see no placefor the others. It's a shame. I did love the combat rifle in F4, but they're useless in 76. 
---

Some will occassionaly spawn at the Treehouse Village in the Mire.  They donxt always spawn though, sometines it's Fog Crawlers, Gulpers, or Rad Toads.
---
I wish the vendors didn't have a CAP limit at all!
---
If I can carry it to the vendor I should be able to sell it with no restrictions especially when it comes to actually bartering. 
---
If I want 1420 Caps worth of Plans I should be able to sell the vendor enough junk that it doesn't hurt my Cap Stash and leave me for broke. 
---
As the post-modern architects would say. “It’s a duck”

Indeed!! I named all my guns

02 sniper

03 laser

04 uglystick
---
It was great, and I never accidentally scraped things when cleaning up my inventory.
---
When I'm going looting I take my expert/master commando down to rank 1s and run with 3 picklock and green thumb. I only run full damage perks in nuke zones and silos. Safes give me  maps and technical data. Switch perk for 3 hacker in silos. Never bother with hacking anywhere else.
---
Put on a full unyielding set and get to 19% health and you’ll be getting these puppies all the time
---
This affects people who are on the PC and use mods. They have to disable or update their mods and ini file to fix it. 
---
Thank you for a pleasant and exciting read.
---
What system do you play on?
---
There’s some really tasteful and unique touches to this that I havnt seen elsewhere, it really sets apart! I also really wanted to build in a town to make it look as though  my house is a part of the map. What town is this? Looks nestled right in and I havnt found any that let me close! 
---
PC 🤞
---
I don't believe they needed buffs, just a little balance would be nice.  Certain aspects of weapons are grossly out of balance, such as weapon weight reduction cards missing, imbalanced armor penetration etc.  
---
I agree that with all the cards available that balancing the damage itself is simply untenable atm.  
---
However I don't think melee is grossly OP, just that doing acceptable damage for game progression is far easier to attain with melee.
---
No, i get your skepticism. This stuff isn't published (annoyingly). I believe its data mined. Let me see if i can find a source.
---
Probably wants the loose mod, not the plan. 
---
There aren’t enough difficult enemies in 76. 
---
I am not going to defend my actions AT ALL. It was very stupid, which was why I found it so funny! The whole time I was thinking "HOW can they not figure out where I am!?!? Shouldn't it be obvious???". : p
---
Yeah saw this too. There’s a certain legendary wendigo in cranberry, that after dying while wearing wrong armor, had his health restored when I went to retrieve my dropped loot. I took that puke down to 1/3 health and came back to see him at full?
---
Where??? Is Patch 5 the most recent?
---
I'm not defending him as being a legit gamer, just pointing out that having that much ammo is entirely possible and well within the realm of someone with nothing else to do.  Just because you or I don't have that kind of time or dedication to accomplish doesn't make it impossible at all.  Hell, it isn't even improbable, just tedious.  And we all know just how tedious this game can be all on its own.
---
Thank you for this!!
---
I'm on PS4 as well, been thinking of setting up a community where everyone can help one another with quests, events, farming, dealing with griefers, trading and the like, but also having kind of the same ideal of the in game Responder lore of helping everyone who needs help and isn't hurting others, if you're interested let me know, I've mentioned it to my friends but only really when we were busy with other stuff so we haven't set it up, but we're almost always down to drop a nuke on White Springs or the SBQ.
---
Well at least AlexKGB went into this interview being unbiased. Unlike every other YouTuber who intentionally leave of the facts when it comes to the 900 hour guy. 
---
Your welcome. I figured if I almost filled my pants laughing, maybe other people might get a giggle, haha.
---
I do wonder how hard a low-level must shit themselves when I show up in X-01 for a "defend the workshop" event even though I legit am just there to help in case the mob is fifteen anglers or somethong.  Before, I just wouldn't go near the bench so I wouldn't look as hostile, but now just being there can be seen as a threat. 
---
Armor mods have the same flat chance of being learned while scraping ( which is why sometimes you'll get the rank 4 increase first) while for weapon there is High, Low, and Very Low chances for slcetain mods being leraned (which is why it seems to "slowdown" after a while, it butned through all of your High chance mods.
---
Trying to compile a list of determinates that would violate ToS would be nearly impossible due to the open ended and intentionally vague wording of any document of this sort.  Stop being edgy and pretentious.

THIS! I managed to find a L45 in Garrahan HQ, but a plan would be even better! I've read that it can be a random reward for escorting the warden around Eastern Penitentiary but as of yet it's not been doled out to me.

Really frustrating. I like to run as many ammo types as possible so I have to craft/scavenge ammo as little as possible. I rarely ever use my combat rifle for anything. I have a combat rifle modded with automatic .38 receiver and use it more often. Now I'm running 2 10mm smgs for general use and a handmade for nukezones.  I love my splattercanon but I'd really like to have a reason to use my furious CR too. I'd even be a little happier if the ammo yield was just evened out a little. It definitely can't compete with my handmade for big fights and isn't so cheap to make as my 10mm smg. It's just in an awful place. I really hate it because I ran 4 combat rifles on fo4 (.308, .45, .38, 5.56) and really enjoyed using them until I fell in love with splattercanon. More the furious modifier than the handmade itself.
---
Apparently yall are missing the point. People duped stealth boys. Their function is economical by nature which has been tarnished by duping. They are MEANT TO BE OP due to them being LIMITED however DUPING as allowed certain people to INFINITELY USE THEM. Do yall comprehend? Should I dupe stealth boys and berry mentats to compete? For fucks sake, this is not rocket science. 
---
I spent about 3000 caps on handmade and lever action plans to level up. I agree the handmade is my goto when I want to drop something quick. I agree the AP and the ammo is expensive.
---
I’m working towards a silenced handmade like the level 15 I found awhile back.
---
I’m a stealth rifleman

Probably ought to login &amp; check the status of your ticket then.  Folk who successfully created tickets said they received confirmation emails saying that it was a 4-6 month turnaround.  
---
I don’t understand the question 
---
Man, I feel like those of us sticking with the game and continuing to play will be rewarded with preparedness for future content.
---
Things like this would be so much fun :).
---
Too open to abuse. Even GTAO has s cool down on passive mode and that's grief central.
---
Yeah, I remember looking at the map and seeing your username in one of the silos.  I was modding some armor for my brother in my camp near lucky hole mine.  we heard the launch and went to the cliff side to watch the touchdown, but we never saw anything.  Small world(s), sometimes :)
---
Fuck, I saw them somewhere, can't remember though. Them fuckers are *really* pricey from vendors though. Like 9200 caps or some shit.
---
Then don't buy any shit with real money. Easy as that. You get atoms in game for achievements.
---
I think the shared stash is a better option. 
---
While we're on the topic, what is the point of the ultracite laser gun? How does it even exist? Isn't it exactly the same as the normal laser gun?
---
CAKE OR DEATH! 
---
Did I even mention being bested or was that just your assumption? 
---
Your edit... what?? If it's at a camp we don't get diseases? Dammit!
---
I found it interesting listening to the mindset of this cheater. Despite him taking some accountability he still attempted to shift the blame away from himself and his cheating friends. I just don't understand the joy of playing a game on super easy mode at the expense of others.
---
This suggestion comes to you from the Beta period 
---
Ah, cake please?
---
As mentioned many times, a way to prevent this would be one choice upon login, unchangeable in a session, with a cooldown to make the players choice remain after server hops to prevent attack and run.  Claiming a workshop would deactivate Passive and it would remain deactivated until the end of the session.  
---
See the lonely hearts Yao guai gauntlet in fo:nv

---
With what? My realistically farmed stealth boys and berry mentats? Do you realize someone with infinite supplies will not stop until they have your workshop? Do you people even know that duping is still a thing?
---
They have said this is something they will do. When? They didn't say. 
---
Everyone was sent a list of items that got them flagged, Ultracite and rare Nukas included. Inventories were gone back over a month. It's almost impossible to get enough flux for 200k rounds of ammunition, for example. Also we know it doesn't come from crafting anymore, someone in  the trade discord crafted 60k at once and is still currently playing
---
Well, there are candle sconces, oil lamps, stone benches and rustic tables which one could use. Not perfect, but *not bad* for that purpose. Even the bear-skin rug is arguably primitive enough to fit the bill. 
---
Copied from another post along the similar lines...
---
We need the ability to ‘drop’ items in our camp and have them stay there. Also we need the ability to drop items for other players to use such as bowls of food, meds, chems &amp; drinks.
---
My pool table looks stupid with no balls on it.
---
My bathtubs look dumb without $500,00 in prewar money dumped in there.

Why give us magazine racks and display shelves when we can’t display anything? I spent a lot of time turning my CAMP into a bar, but it looks ridiculous because I can’t have bottles of vodka and wine anywhere... 
---
There's no problem with the vendor cap limit.
---
I would not be happy with this.

You used to get them at the two Grafton vendor bots. Not sure if it is now in the permanent list.

This reads off like you're trying to incite panic lol. I run a store and have multiple copies of some legendaries and also tons of ammo that I farm myself. I was never worried
---
Greatest duper is still Bethesda. They duped whole Fallout 4 to Fallout 76.
---
I think the vender in whitesprings sells them.
---
For the same price as 15 empty bottles...
---
Because if they let you in after a specific patch, and you were someone that WAS duping, then you’d know what method to not use or try going forward.  But that’s dumb because if you were using different exploits, you’d just try out all the methods you used and figure what does vs doesn’t work anyways.
---
I ignore the game

😂😂😂 seems legit

I haven't taken off Patriotic Vault Boy mask since I found a armour station at the farm area when you first start.

Most of them have the same valid complaints with the game that we all have. Needs more content to encourage trading, needs more bug fixes, needs more content in general, this game is still in beta and shouldn’t be in this state still, ect. But in their little heads, that justifies them cheating to make it fun for themselves. It’s a childish “revenge” against the game, partially. They think the choice is easily justified because bethesda messed up.

One of them was only just yesterday talking about the complaints on the Weekly Event they did with the Unstoppables costumes.  The only fairly biased and typically up to date one I've found is JuiceHead but all the others either just jump on the hate badwaggon or don't talk about current events in the game.
---
I feel it depends on server.   I ran WesTek then Whitesprings had 3    
---
I've been destroying people's camps who do this worth the bounty each time 
---
Lol on Adventure server yes. But I want a safe place where I can have a war. War should be in a safe space.
---
This is what gets me: So Bethesda says that now every vendor will have every plan they can have so you don't have to server hop... But, obviously, they don't. I have a level 53 character who has been searching for signs and letters (though I think I am a little short of the price), and I haven't seen it yet at any vendor. 
---
I do most locks, usually only lvl 2 or 3 ones, but terminals I just skip.
---
I understand your point, but this is really bad practice.
---
It should not be necessary for this to happen, they need to make them work first time, not implement workarounds
---
I'm not sure what the grenade that is supposed to detect you is actually called, but I think you get the ability to craft  it like the orbital strike grenade recipe from the Whitesprings bunker main quest from MODUS. I largely ignored it, but I might need to re-consider due to the prevalence of Chameleon now days. I heard them talking about it in chat. Apparently, you toss this thing and it satellite-marks targets in range like a recon scope does, only without actually having to point it at enemies, NPCs, or players so long as they are in a certain radius of it. One dude said something like "I'll try and use this orbital grenade to mark him, be ready.". But they never threw one close enough to me to mark me. And as far as your question about sent/assassin, I think you made a typo but I get the gist. From my experience, one way around sent/assassin armor is that VATS CRITS ignore it, and apply full damage, while a regular VATS or aimed non-VATS shot doesn't. I also use Concentrated Fire so I can target the head, and criticals are 100% accurate, unless something like a solid object is between you and your target. If I REALLY want to kill a tough opponent and to deal with someone using that armor I will use a critical, targeting the head with Concentrated Fire, stealth with Covert Operative, the Eagle Eye mutation, the Better Criticals perk card, Bloody Mess, 3 Rifleman cards, Tank Killer, and a chem like Overdrive (15% damage and crit damage), combined with a high-damage rifle with Instigating and the best AP magazine I can put on it. But I didn't need anywhere near that for these guys, just a lever action and my good ol' instigating BP rifle.
---
&gt;Edit: As an aside, I'm surprised with the downvotes. 
---
As an aside, read up on how Reddit does it's scoring algorithm before you make comments about downvotes on a new post.
---
I can't say with certainty that there was one. I'ven only been on 2 queen events. In the last one I was on, my gun broke, then I ran out of .50 ammo, so I was relegated to running around and trying to pick off random creatures. Afterward though, the more veteran team members seemed puzzled that they hadn't been able to kill her. 
---
They wasted a huge potential when they decided that factions would only be for decoration in this game.
---
Total disappointment

I too destroy the WS campers. Yes push the build zone way the fuck back I's so sick of missles shaking the fucking building when I go in there.

I present to your will this frail body. I beg of you to use me as your vessel, guide me to your brilliance and give relief to this buggy game. Cast the fragile form of this ephemeral body into new life in the forge of your Glow. Atomic Shop, come -- bestow your presence on your unworthy servant.

It's just laziness like how FO4 got rid of the Karma system. I hated that by removing karma it took away a ton of the replay value.

At the time of the edited comment, karma was at 0 with I think 33% positive. Things have obviously shifted since then.

Here's to hoping

The neon letters seem to be a random spawn. I've seen them at nearly every vendor at least once

Fuuuuuck, I saved up and keep looking

I love this to much

There needs to NOT be vendorbots in CAMPS. It will be annoying to travel around trying to find them, or if marked, your camp WILL be griefed daily. We would be much better off with what works well for literally hundred of games, an auctionhouse.
---
The point isn't to buy or not the buy atom store stuff. It's the obtrusiveness of the notice to influence people to "buy" from the atom store (free or non-free atoms) and not so much this game has microtransactions.
---
Hahaha, this is perfect. Can’t believe I forgot to include the Children of Atom, but you nailed it far better than I could have
---
Sounds like the best club to be in
---
We’re all out of cake
---
So my choice is 'or death'?
---
Agreed.
---
I do not know the exact cause of the problem, or why they have not addressed it (I could speculate, but do not care to), but it keeps happening almost every patch, so I am trying to draw their attention to it in a can and collected way so that they will address it at some point.
---
To be fair iirc in the patch notes they did say there are some exceptions to this, so it's intended to make it a bit more interesting
---
Although I agree with you to a point, there are many other AAA games/companies doing something like this, but much much worse. Activision games, Warner Brother's games, Ubisoft games, EA especially!
---
Lolz 
---
Not my responsibility to educate you or there about TOS, much less contracts/legally binding agreements.
---
It spells roles and responsibilities, what’s allowed and what’s not. If you read them, you’d know.

whether you choose to read and comprehend is on you.

Ignorance is no excuse, for  breached agreement .

Im not being pretentious, you’re intentionally being stubborn, ignorant and entitled.

My biggest gripe is that there are different hairstyles for men and women. Without wanting to kick off any drama, I think the hairstyles could belong to anyone... and I like the androgynous look!
---
Also maid outfits.

You're assuming i know where that is, which i dont. 
---
I agree!
---
I just wish there were longer hair styles, most was shoulder length or shorter.
---
This is the true endgame. 
---
only time i use them is when i'm launching a nuke, i take the targeting restrictions off the turrets helps deal with the robots 
---
I swear I got a ultracite mod for knuckles. I'm trying to find one to check.
---
I've seen people post this so many times, you have mods installed, correct it in your fallout76custom.ini

Replace the ATX entries with SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2
---
If you don't loot anything from an area and then server hop usually you can get a respawn. This works when farming weights for lead. Check for the weights if they are not there serverhop. Same goes for all materials. If take any loot from the area I think you have to wait 60-90 minutes for items to respawn.
---
I couldn't agree more. I just wish most YouTubers take that under consideration when discussing banned players. They focus on them as victims and completely ignore those who are trying to enjoy the game but cannot due to the selfishness of cheaters such as him.
---
They have it so in events like scorched earth you cant attack other players till the events over.
---
If he had a dense mod on his chest piece that would’ve negated a lot of the explosive damage you were dealing to him. Plus a combat shotgun to the face from even a low level with a few shotgun perks is nothing to scoff at.
---
My comment is more a generalization of many of the posts on reddit not directly targeting you.
---
The real question is does the respawning timer for safes and lockable reset if someone comes and loots after you?
---
So for instance if I'm in Charleston fire station and I go to the weight room and there are no weights, but I take a desk fan, you think I need to wait up to 90 minutes for *any* items in that area to respawn?
---
What about mobs and stuff
---
Rank 5 demo expert for maybe 10-20 extra dmg on a gun is not at all worth it. Not since the tse nerf anyway.
---
Yes, 100% agree. I did it yesterday, took a chance and got rid of all mutations until AR was gone, then re-added them all, and...Viola! All fixed now and working again.
---
When you've accomplished all related challenges, the chore of swapping cards in and out is not worth it most of the time. I have only the very last terminal challenge left open, at 233/256, and I could boost that in a quick afternoon session if I wanted, but I'm mostly only doing the terminal that locks the 'treasure room' of the Watoga Transit Hub (two fusion core spawns, one armor plan, a bobblehead, one possible PA mod, several meds and ammo, definitely worth it) now.
---
But after that final challenge is done, I'll stick to occasionally put in the lockpicking cards: I'm getting plans &amp; maps from lvl 3 locked safes all the time, and the armory at Camp Venture or the caps stash room in Whitesprings are always worth a look.
---
But yeah, those perks should really be passive or the cards should be combinable into one, please!
---
r/thatHappened 
---
Wait for them to attack you and there should be a red 'damage direction indicator' turn in that direction and melee them (ranged doesn't work). Sometimes the corpse teleports above the ground (I think from Skyrim game code, if a corpse falls far enough below the game world it teleports back up so you can loot it).
---
I know it's not the most elegant solution... Lol
---
Did my first since the patch last night. Probably about the same number of people, similar levels, though we had at least one 220ish as well. It took much longer than pre-patch, for sure! Pre-patch, with a small group (as small as me and one other), I could kill a SBQ without breaking a weapon. Last night I roached a prime gatling plasma and a prime TSE .50 cal, and did a number on my bloodied super sledge and prime explosive gatling laser.
---
We still had more than 10 minutes left on the clock when we took her down, but we were doing it in under 10 minutes, easy, pre-patch.
---
I just want a conclusion when it comes to 900 hour guy. IF bethesda is banning someone for having had 100,000 ammo over a 30 day period, it’s entirely possible that guy did it legit. After all he was playing about 10 hours a day.
---
I read that in public and I had to conceal the amount of laugh it was inducing in me
---
Is that why so many low level ghouls have been spawning there lately? Players don’t even get XP for turret kills so what’s the point of building a base right at clubhouse exit? I don’t destroy them but I definitely don’t like it. I think a no-Build zone should exist for all of Whitesprings major buildings. At least say 50 to 100 yards away from heavily trafficked areas. 
---
Upvoted...feels stupid with those sweet antique shelves and stuff when they are empty
---
Bruh seriously? LMAOOOOO 
---
Haha now you get to save more caps
---
It’s at watoga vendor.
---
Helpful tip: don’t buy things you don’t actually want.
---
You make a fair point though saying someone is doing worse by comparison doesn't suddenly make the original practice suddenly ok. They're both bad.
---
Anyhow, my point isn't about the microtransactions themselves, just the obtrusiveness of the notice.
---
Lolz..
---
On a shelf? Really wow
---
It even floats like a duck! What attention to detail.
---
Yes do not take anything or you won't get the respawn on the next server.
---
I have no idea. The available information on this game is very outdated and often unhelpful. Most mobs seem to reliably respawn for me on every single server hop though. I'm not sure if that's because nobody is killing them (just taking all junk/plans and server hopping) or if it's because my presence is making them respawn.
---
I have some pie that's in pretty good shape
---
In my experience, the locks on safes reset based on players entering the area.  But the loot inside them are still instanced to yourself on a 24 hour or so timer, and you can unlock the freshly locked items, yet you won't find anything inside until your timer is up.
---
Conversely, you can enter an area that someone already unlocked and loot freely if your container timer has reset.
---
hidden in plane site too from griefers
---
I farm there quite often, with my PA equipped and swinging away with melee.  I completely agree with your post, but at some point, I have a feeling that they are going to nerf the Golf course anyways. For the direction that Bethesda is heading with updates/nerfs, that area churns way too many legendaries (although most are garbage). I AM hoping that they keep some places with a decent source of end-game items. 
---
How are the areas defined? If I take something outside the station do the same rules apply? Sorry for all the questions but I have read a lot of very definitive sounding advice that directly conflicts with other very sure sounding advice so I want as much info as possible to test. Thanks!
---
This was flat out hilarious. Great read, thanks for posting.
---
Enemy mobs respawn on server hops.
---
This is one of my biggest pet peeves. If a container hasn't fully respawned it's loot or is empty it should not be locked. Wasted so many Bobby pins on useless loot.
---
Yeah ik, but sometimes I randomly join a fire server and dont want to leave. Ig I just gotta keep server hopping
---
There are a lot of things I want to see happen to this game, but I think clutter is the biggest hope I have. I spent so much time in F4 cluttering my home, and the homes of my settlers to make them feel lived in. Not being able to scatter beer and wine bottles around my bed is a real disappointment.
---
the validation you're desperately seeking isnt here 
---
Everybody loves that ;)
---
Yeah it’s for everyone.
---
Yep, saw him twice during buff - once he spawn during SBQ fight, second one, on the red bridge near the Charleston train-station.
---
I do not take anything I fast travel to the Charleston FD check the weights then serverhop.
---
They set this up so you can't clear the weight room on 1 server hop to the next clear it again so on and so forth. You used to be able to repeatably farm weights by server hopping then Beth found out about it and BOOM nerfed. 
---
I mean I get it. It is fair to the other players but it also sucks when you need materials.
---
Humans aren't rational beings. They are rationalizing. 
---
I hear ya. I may have spent more time looking at load screens than actually playing the game
---
Make a post to Market76 :)

One of my best in-game moments was due to this. I was clearing the golf club and a stray bullet hit someone's camp, earning me a 10 cap bounty. Within minutes someone saw me and, as I would have in their place, killed me for the bounty. No harm no foul, and I came back to find my bag still there and my merciful executioner waving to me. I emoted to him to follow me, and headed back to the offending CAMP, where I proceeded to demolish the place, piece by piece. He just stood there giving me the thumbs up emoji while I racked up my bounty, and after I was done, dutifully executed me when I gave him the all clear finger guns, just before the CAMP owner showed up.
---
You bought the initial game.
---
The ongoing maintenance and development are paid with from the shop.
---
So you can either buy $25 DLCs or get them for free subsidized by people's occasional atom shop purchases.
---
Quit bitching.
---
That's not because deathclaw gauntlets (or melee weapons in general) are over powered. It's not even because bloodied melee weapons are overpowered. It's because the combination of a bloodied unarmed weapon with adrenal reactions, talons, twisted muscles, 5 pieces of unyielding armor, and probably radicool and nerd rage thrown in for good measure, is over powered... as long as you run around with your hit points capped at like 40 or 50.
---
Thanks, I will check this out. I've been in need of a lot of plastic and have spent a lot of time server hopping.
---
So once you find the item in question, you just wait 90 mins and start looking again?

Cutthroat camp nearest the pleasant valley train station. There are two safes and a star chest and another wooden chest on a table with a dead raider next to it. I've found many plans there

hack the terminals, take off the turrents targeting restrictions, makes it much easier
---
Occasionally (though far less often with the dwindling player base) you can find something that someone sold to a vendor that's a good item to use/trade.  I found a Tattered Field Jacket on a vendor for example, and at least on PC it's very rare. 
---
A sneak crit to the head or one hit with a very high dmg melee weapon would’ve easily taken him out. If he has a bounty he’s at a huge disadvantage because you get the first hit.
---
If he’s using stealth boys and you can’t vats him and don’t have any good melee. You could try dropping pulse mines all around and then engaging him, they are very effective in PvP.
---
School cafeterias are awesome for plastic Watoga Highschool has about 150-200 plastic in it.

You can repair things, go to your CAMP device and hit repair all.

I've never used a stealth boy. I find the 30s to be not worth it. Maybe it's useful but someone who's not a sneak build I don't see a use.

Oh Nuka cola cups from fairgrounds, any water cooler usually has a stack next to them. The tennis court at Whitesprings has 3 water coolers next to it and a water cooler in the lower area (take a left at the bottom of the stairs it'll be in front of the desk) I always check them
---
Get a gamma gun, make it auto. Run through the golf cluband bring the horde (or as many as possible) out the front and dont go inmediately right, but rather take a little detour through the pool area, come at the bases from the sides, rarely are there any turrets on the sides. And the simply stand in or near the offending camp and pump the ghouls full of lovely lovely rads, which will keeps their health up while they descimate said offemsive camp 👍 no wanted bounty and if the owner turns up just keep spamming the ghouls with rad damage until they kill them ☺

That’s not my faction 
---
Your welcome! :)
---
More ammo then a person could reasonably use. Assuming each SBQ kill took 1,000 rounds of ammo.  that is roughly 360 kills they could do. 
---
In FO4 one of the DLC’s added the Children of Atom decorations, candles, lanterns and such.. Would be perfect for you if they added those back.
---
Can you wait 1 hour ?
---
Glad I could spread a little mirth on these normally dour forums. :)
---
buy the ancient lights pack from whitesprings market and place candles between each staircase as well
---
Or 2
---
I have lockpick but I dont do anything with terminals and frankly most of the containers I open have crap in them...I think you are right that the lockpick card is probably a waste
---
Can't unfortunately, I'll have to head to work by then.  We can do it tonight if they're still available, but you don't have to hold on to them if someone else wants them. 
---
That's what I'm worried about to, but if they are specific for one type than they had better be a lot cheaper than regular power armor paint jobs. No way in gonna pay 1400 atoms for one armor paint job
---
Sure
---
Speak, brother. That broken, rotten, wooden half door made in West By God Virginia survived a nuclear war, 25 years of post war rad storms and such, and over 200 hundred years of carpet baggers. The only reason it's only a half door is because some cheeky bastard hit it with a fat man point blank. We don't make shitty doors.
---
Thanks I didn't realize Rad-x suppressed mutations
---
never tamed any creature yet, but i have pacified several scorchbeast
---
Cool, I'll message you 
---
Man i just got the Bastet, but its level 25 and im 56 lol. Sold it straight away.
---
i made a floating mothman church! 
---
It even got blessed by mothman himself who teleported inside and AOE'd the whole church when me and my buddy where shooting him from one of the towers
---
Looks like you have a basement flooding issue. Better call a foundation repair company
---
Theres a mothman event, look under your effects tab in pip boy.
---
Ummm, that suit of armor weighs 10 pounds. I have 3 in my hip pocket.
---
Thx. I have server hopped watoga for hours some nights and not seen anything but not sure if I was always looting other stuff. 
---
Didn't know about the water coolers. Can you loot the whole thing?
---
It's never worth the time IMO.  If there was a chance for legendary items I would. But there isn't.
---
Lockpicking and terminal hacking should be passive and not fucking perks I stopped hacking and lock picking a long time ago.
---
I know about that, I just wanted to know if it was really rare to see two of them in about 50m of each other
---
What about Scorchbeast?
---
wow...
---
No I was pretty straight forward. You said it would be easy to trade to reach that high number of 360k ultracite ammo. Now you shift gears and say only a minority of people would trade in enough bulk to reach that number. Please make up your mind if it is an easy thing for people to reach that much or if it is hard to reach that level. 
---
&gt; Seems to me you’re not willing to believe in false positives when it  comes to these suspensions, that’s fine but it also means you’re not  seeing the situation clearly imo.  
---
Your argument also seems to shift and move the more you talk.  imo only people who are lieing threw their teeth shift arguments so readily. Again first claiming that it would be easy for anyone to trade in such bulk items. Then when presented with the fact the bans were not much more wide spread claiming now only a minority could trade in such bulk. 
---
&gt; I can tell you all the ways you can get this ammo, how easy it would be  when you play 10+ hours a day, but I don’t think you’re willing to open  your mind to that possibility so I won’t waste my time. 
---
 **Occam's razor my friend.** 
---
Sure thing :)
---
Also, an FYI that I didn't see by browsing the comments.. 
---
I've noticed in my own play time and **100's to 1000's** of server hops after the latest patches, *that the vendors inventory will refresh and improve sometimes after you buy then learn certain plans*. For example:
---
Enclave vendor.. if you buy the resistant lining plan, learn it, then load in again, he will now sell the treated lining plan. If you buy the resistant plan, and don't learn it.. the inventory may never update (or rarely update) to show the next tier of lining plans. 
---
Harpers Ferry/Watoga vendors.. If you server hop, you will see sturdy combat armor plans randomly. If you buy/learn those (or if you already knew them from somewhere else), he will start stocking heavy combat armor plans. Again, you may have to keep server hopping for each one to hopefully show up.
---
If you buy/learn plan, it will sometimes make room for a new plan to spawn in that vendor's inventory. Bethesda says they are aware of the vendors not stocking things full time, but I don't know when it will be updated. 
---
100,000 of a **RARE ITEM** in a 30 day period, not just ammo.  Why do people keep leaving that part off??
---
There are actual stacks of cups next to them on the tables if they're not there someone already grabbed them. I get a ton of plastic like this.
---
Lol no its not during mothman season
---
Sometimes this game reminds me of Minecraft but with better zombies.  And I love the duck.
---
Why the down votes?  Probably because it's obvious why players dupe and this just feels like some weird way to promote your youtube channel.  Take another down vote. 
---
What type of melee do you want to do?
---
Depends on what kind of melee weapon you are using.  1 handed,  2 handed, fist type? Use anything that ups damage, barbarian is also a good pic if you use a lot of strength. 
---
I fought an invisible moth man yesterday... 
---
Uh....what?
---
In my own opinion I think he was cheating but I come at it from a different perspective. Instead of focusing on if he could somehow craft that much ammo under 30 days what always bugged me is this guys check list of alibis and excuses. It feels like he manufactured a fitting profile that could make crafting to this length possible. Hopefully I'm wrong but it just comes across as bullshit.
---
What are the angled walls??
---
Touch'e
---
I love DC’ing after killing her and using up my resources 
---
Couldn't catch him neither before or after increased chance :(
---
Yeah love this spot - one of my camps is there!
---
I actually zoned in last night and got “camp can not be placed” and was in someone else’s house!
---
Maybe though was not enlightened about to see it with your mortal eyes. 
---
I want to name my shotgun "Kurt Cobain's Microphone" again!
---
Haven't played in weeks, just logged in to check myself. No reason for me to be banned, never did anything wrong, and guess what? I was not banned. Repeat **not** banned.
---
A little counter-narrative to the litany of complaints from the friends, alts, and mules of dupers.
---
All you have to do is change to one of the free icons you already have.
---
Thanks so much :)
---
"It (duping) was already in the last Fallout, it should have been fixed by now.". False. Cheating in single-player only effects YOUR gaming experience, not that of others. Which is why devs prioritize different bug fixes in single VS. multiplayer games. 
---
Interesting. I had no idea that the duplication bug came from fallout 4. Overall, it's an interesting insight into the mindset of a duper. I don't support this stuff at all, in fact I find cheating in a multiplayer game to be reprehensible. I poked about on Ebay last month, maybe December, and found a lot of people selling items. Not cheap either. All comes back to greed in the end.
---
Sometimes I forget if it's been 18 hours, 20 hours, 28 hours, etc. since I last opened a safe or been in an area.
---
While expending some Durability on a single Bobby Pin or two isn't a deal breaker, it's still annoying to spend 30-45 seconds or more picking that Level 3 lock just to realize you already got that chest late last night.
---
But this also depends on their playstyle.  If you are part of a guild/clan, and you are the one making the ammo for the rest of your team, and maybe also trade, you might knock out a ton of it in one go and store it.  This wouldn't be a necessity, but might just be how you prefer to play.  Not knowing it could be any kind of issue, your decision to do this would be a trivial moment at the time of crafting.
---
Plenty ! Skins and such for replacements you will see your side, but others will see normal unless they have the mod too. Theres wonderful Map mods, a few QoL mods, Perk Loadout (broken atm too I think), etc. Plenty of juicy goodness.
---
haha, only the melee bros deserve a nerf!  
---
My main point was that the handmade should be gunsmith level 5 and the others should be lowered. In order to mod radiums for people I have to keep a minimum of 5 intelligence which is a bit annoying. Entirely selfish, but that's my motivation.
---
Do you call the floor in an upstairs room "ground"?
---
hmmm ... Im actually not entirely sure. That'd require some testing, with numbers. Probably easiest in fo4.
---
I fought an invisible swarm of bees yesterday.
---
yup, I interchange between the 2, the combat wins hands down for vats use but the recoil is a just a touch too much up and down movement. The handmade is, of course, a dream to use!
---
Doesnt this pop up only once?
---
Besides, there are icons that come free from the start.
---
Is ultracite ammo in that category? I just want clairification. I’m no expert, I’ve never even crafted any myself so I don’t know what it takes. But if someone played 10 hours a day, isn’t it at least a little possible? Sounds like this guy devoted his life to this game for 3 months.
---
Not like there isn't big ol' sign and text on the log in screen before playing or anything...
---
I've seen him 2x so far and he scared the hell out of me both times. Do people actually try and kill him? He's so fast!
---
Yes. I only bother if it's a level 0 and the area is definitely clear. There's almost never anything worth it inside anyway.
---
I like the card system *in theory*, but in practice I think it sucks. Switching cards back and forth is just a faff. I already waste half of my time faffing about with inventory management. There's hardly any time left to play the damned game.
---
The white + slow movement is because someone hit her with a cryolator, a good strategy. That's unrelated to any server lag.
---
Dude, I raid them solo, and I always prefer to attack workshops that have teams of high levels,  I look for pvp, and most of the time find it. In the previous setup. Now, it is just a one sided fight that even us PVP players do not want.
---
We all like an edge to our game... This change just made the pvp element in workshops sour. No tense... nothing. I lost interest in raiding workshops for this reason, and this is my favourite thing go do in fo76.
---
This is true. I am mostly in the Cranberry Bog, Mire, and Savage Divide at lvl 155. The drops are generally lvl 45-50. I do occasionally get some that are lvl 25 and those I keep and try to give to other players. If you drop by the White Springs, you will find (like me), other players dumping tons of legendary items.  The 200 cap limit at vendors, and limited stash means no space for them. If it does not fit my build, I just drop them. Some are awful like a Mutant Slaying Rolling Pin or Furious Cane, but others can be nice like a Furious Minigun.
---
My first play through I got the Perfect Storm around level 25 or so. The second time around, I waited till level 50. A much better weapon, but by that point I had a Vampire version which loaded 40% faster, and did 10% more damage when aiming. Perfect Storm could not compare.  If I were to do it again, I think getting at a lower level and more importantly using it, would have been a better choice.
---
He was level 40 and I was 67 so it wasn’t too bad. But I’m sure my penance is coming.
---
If you are fortunate for a scorchbeast to spawn in the area I lead them right to the turret platforms.  Luring other critters (did with with legendary deathclaw too) to those areas works well.  
---
Or, if all else fails, just blow it up yourself.  I hate it when people do that. 
---
In-game lore explanation is that Bigfoot is what happens when you dip a gorilla in FEV. Bam.
---
I discovered nades deal with these cheating fuckers nicely. Lol  always a dog when it happens to me. Up around megastop is last one I remember.
---
Where does the Gauss fit into this?
---
I couldn’t discover it until I was literally standing right in front of the door. 
---
Yeah, i run a couple of combats on .38 as part of my cunning plan to get free ammo as i'm not aware of many people who keep, let alone use .38
---
And I don't see why i get 36 5.56 vs 21 45s per batch, seems very strange to me.
---
Concrete stairs.
---
From an attacker perspective, if my opponent had an equal capability of initiating PvP while I trespass, I would think twice before I even set foot on the workshop zone.
---
Aha! Thanks
---
It happened to me as well, a wolf stuck in a wall. I just fast travelled away then back when I got the "You workshop has been overrun !" quest, and the wolf was out of his wall. 
---
&gt;You forget the fact that the handmade is a butt ugly weapon
---
Comrade, tour yankee imperialist dog commentary has been reported to glorious handmade motherland.  Re-education specialists will arrive shortly by cargobot to help you realize glorious construction is appealing to all manly mans in wasteland!  
---
Fun fact, you can make an ak47 pattern receiver from a shovel.  I never have, because i have the construction skill of a dead yak, but it can be done.  
---
Tbh me too
---
&gt; Dupe bug that existed in Fallout 4 carried over to Fallout 76 unfixed. 
---
Egregious. Sloppy. Unforgivable.
---
I always have them both on, trust me, loads of players have some really scary explosive weapons and PVP brings out the worst of any player's stash box.
---
Pleasure :) 
---
It's in that category because of the materials that it uses to make them, stable flux + ultracite + the other materials for making regular ammo...ultracite isn't exactly rare but the stable flux is. 
---
 Is there a chance the track could bend?
---
Really digging the Mayan Pyramid vibe. All hail the Man Of Moth.
---
Also so.e people are hoarders.  I run around with 100s of amounts of each junk bc I like having it ready on a moment's notice when I want to craft or change up my camp.  Not optimal, but I like it that way.  Even though it's not 100k's worth just in numbers below 1000, people I've mentioned this to have responded with "that's weird/stupid", so it's all really relative to the individual.  Hoarding supplies shouldn't be persecuted in a video game.  An insane amount of hard to find / rare items like bobbleheads demands scrutiny.  But ammo?  It's really a stretch IMO.  I feel strongly a ban over just ammo is a severe over reaction.
---
MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY. I would love to deal radiation damage+More damage to scorched/Scorchbeasts
---
If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck,... it's a Trojan Scorchbeast Duck.
---
Very nicely done!
---
It's almost like people don't realise this is an online grinding game, which means loot table RNG. Yes it may not seem fun to kill the same boss 100 times for a good gun, but how boring would it be if everyone got every good drop every time. Maybe it's my experience that makes me enjoy it this way though, games like osrs and wow.
---
Agree!  I like to rebuild my camp regularly trying different designs and whatnot.  Always ends up the same, I get about 90-95% complete and run out of budget.  Really sucks.  The stash increase from 600 to 800 was nice but I had learned to live with 600 and would be willing to trade that 200 for an increase in budget for camp building.
---
Fly to Poland, have a nice vacation, buy a $5 thumbstick, get the game for free.
---
I think move speed debuff is a good idea by using stealthboys. Maybe complete no VATS in PVP servers is a suggestion. Kills the aim of most Meele Players lol.
---
 If I do pvp at first I take a berry mentats, it's safes me for the most surprises. 
---
Also good at workshop pvp, course 50% of the owners don't came alone or some other players came in.
---
ALL GLORY TO THE MOTHMAN
---
I remember a great, and tiny (like 5kb) mod for all hair types that merged a bunch of vanilla hair styles together and made about 100 more, it was great for customisation 
---
Meh, I still turn every worshop I take and actually care about into punji hell.  If anyone wants to claim it, go for it, I won't even show up to stop you, but even after you claim it, you'll still need to deal with the punji boards, wasting ammo, nades, or time getting rid of them.  :3
---
Berry mentats GG
---
There are also Vault Tec University Jumpsuits that ( I think) have the same shielded stats as the vault 76 underlinings
---
This is pretty troll. I like standing by the back door and keep closing it to stop the turrets from shooting down the corridor. Forces out the player if they're around and makes for a hilariously annoying time of each person opening and closing the door.
---
Not yet as far as I'm aware of
---
Is there a beehive? Always go with the beehive
---
I'm not so sure he lied now either and I was initially. Beth keeps removing threads or I cannot find them but there was an interesting one I saw last night from the leader of the guild 900 hour guy belonged to. He talked about how they were all legit and the pooled resources between them and the community and each muled a specific set of items. A few of them were banned and a couple have worked through reinstatement.
---
IDK... could still be BS but it seems a little far to go for a con.
---
Well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and if i'm not mistaken, Mozambique even has it on their national flag, I'm still waiting for Great Britain to add the radium rifle but it might not go too well with the Union Flag design.  
---
I didn't mention the Lever Action mainly due to it not falling into that family where you can have semi or fully auto. I run an excessive 80's commando setup and while I'd love to have a lever action as a back-up, I don't want to have 2 sets of rifle cards running at the same time. I really love it as a weapon, my only issue is how stupid it looks when you're wearing power armour - it looks like you're holding a twig. Only the PA revolover users look sillier!
---
And I totally agree with your last point, it's very hard to argue that people should use a different rifle when the handmade has no real competitors. Those poor pistol bros have it even worse, there's pretty much no choice for them. Of course, the radium is still clearly better than all the other rifles, it just needs a damage boost.
---
That mod is currently broken and the fixed version is going to be a lot less convenient than it was before. It really is unfortunate because I love that mod. Now you'll have to build presets on nukes and dragons site and put them into a config file with a preset number and that's how it'll load the presets. Fine if you're set in your card stacks but if you're low level and keep changing the card stacks as you get them it's going to be slightly tedious to update them with new cards every time. Bethesda needs to bake this in already.
---
&gt; Yeah, looks like a michael bay movie effect but does absolutely fuck all 
---
So just like a Michael Bay movie? :)
---
I ignore terminals, but only because they annoy the hell out of me. In previous games, I've used mods to disable them completely. Lockpicking is easy, but if I didn't like loot so much, I wouldn't bother with using cards on it.
---
Had the same on PS4. Trial and error eventually lead me to being able to discover it.  Just run around a bunch.
---
Was attacked by one on the way to top of the world from my camp in the divide. first time I've seen one outside of the forest. First time being attacked by one.
---
That's fucking deep brah.
---
Fair enough. I admittedly dont know how to dupe, but from what i read i assumed it was a literal doubling of what you had. If ultracite is currency, then the 360k was likely his profits. Anyway, im not sure my "biased interpretations" are any less accurate than yours. We can agree to disagree. But i seriously doubt Beth is gonna feel obliged to be transparant on this just because people think they should. Thats kinda out of character 
---
Just saw the plans at the Pleasant Valley Station.
---
I'm near whitespring Station, I can literally almost touch the awning with my CAMP.. and I will get the "CAMP could not be placed" message probably like 7 out of 10 times, even if NO ONE else has a nearby CAMP
---
I thought this was a very relevant and insightful post.  For Bethesda to have let this exploit exist in the game at release in the first place and then punish those who played on it by banning them completly was unfair. Not a duper, I don't condone it but was friends with one that got banned and Appalachia has become even emptier.
---
It is a well known thing where these games try to get you to make that first buy because afterwards people are psychologically more open to buying in game items. This is an extremely common tactic you can go read about it just look it up.
---
So the you can build more as you level up, does it still work as a base?
---
Thank you, will add in!
---
Legends say he doesn’t flee until he’s attacked. There are records of hunters keeping the creature busy and calling in friends to take the Mothman down before he has a chance to vanish in a cloud of smoke.
---
not on your life!
---
r/humblebrag
---
If you were on PS4, it may have been me
---
I had a very high level nice visitor to my CAMP once and I had nothing to give them they wouldn’t have better of so I gifted them a pie. They gifted me a 3* Marines armor piece. I wasn’t expecting anything back so I was pretty happy all around. Then I hit up Watoga for some trading and tried the pie machine there and lo! I got a pie! 
---
&gt; You forget the fact that the handmade is a butt ugly weapon
---
I know that taste is personal, but I've never heard anyone call a Kalashnikov "ugly" before, and considering the competition (combat rifle, assault rifle)...
---
Well, we don't mind the change, though it would make a difference if it was faor ground on both sides.
---
I solo raid workshops and I prefer to attack teams of high levels, (High risk, High reward) and I am successful most of the times, but before, these battles would offee alot of tense fights, required me to study the situation before engaging, and moving in stealth for the claim.
---
Now it is "Hi! Claim! Kill!" so dull... however, it would be more tense to greet the owner, knowing he could blow u off ur feet the same way you could do the same.
---
Wha wha wha, wasn't my fault the game sucked I was just trying to make things better. I love how breaking the rules in their eyes is a badge of pride and not viewed as doing anything wrong. they know exactly what they are doing and he got caught, I say bye Felicia.....
---
Not really.  Dense/Padded + Fire Proof is becoming a meta pairing as a means of nullifying all explosive damage.
---
I think it's just Welded but Deep pocketed, yes. And 1 star. It's funny, I just found a second one last night. I wont be on today until 830-ish CST.
---
The handmade TSE is what I was asking to buy. If ur in the market, I recommend. Bought one last night, my first TSE and shredded a lvl80 SB with all 3 lv1 rifle perks and tank killer.
---
The poor gauss, while still super powerful, suffers from an identity crisis as afar as I'm aware. It kind of counts as an energy weapon so loses power due to the grounded mutation. However, the hardcore gauss users I knew said it got more powerful after certain changes. They run bloodied setups so I'm not sure of the details. 
---
It still shows how much wood total you've gathered and it will increase if you do what I listed, or even easier just put a legendary in a suitcase from your inventory and do the same thing when you pick it back up you'll get the pop up like you got when you first got the legendary item.
---
You can adjust the effect in the menu, but 21:9 mode is still broken - they just stretched the fit the screen. 
---
Also, gauss wasn't in my post as it doesn't fit the combat/assault rifle family 
---
Helpful tip: don't be a cunt.
---
Not everyone wastes space in their garage with a vehicle. I'd much rather use that floor space for my drill press, belt grinder, forge, power saws, workbenches, etc.
---
DID YOU EVEN READ THE POST?
---
You forgot the Vault Dwellers; those of us taking a break underground in the hopes things will get better one day.  ^even ^though ^vault ^dwellers ^weren't ^technically ^a ^faction...
---
While I’m not interested in PvP, I disagree. Server populations are already low by design. People interested in PvP should have a place where that small population can be engaged, even with no other changes. On top of that, there may need to be balance tweaks to systems on a PvP-centric server, but that is a lesser concern. 
---
Time spent on features I don’t want but others do is not wasted time, even if I gain nothing. 
---
It was not in patch notes but they changed the buildable area in some locations recently (last week's patch).  You will have move it further away from object you were near in the game that was a non-buildable area.
---
Also fallout has always been a pve game ever since 76. You're being a twat, don't be a twat.
---
Pvp can only be balanced so far, but game like this aren't meant to be perfect as such or as we said it would negate perks and leveling up all together. 
---
Hi, cbomg!
---
I am stopping by to wish you a wonderful day, and an excellent year!

-HappyFriendlyBot
---
That only repairs destroyed things.  Not parts which have been damaged (showing health bar).
---
But legit berry mentats dont beat duped stealthoys
---
I mean it does, you'll have a significant higher amount of players hosting server if they don't cost money, it used to be the norm to allow players to host dedicated server for free, then $$$ got involved. Why would anyone want to pay Bethesda to host a server for them given the whole point of it is due to players wanting better server stability and mods. Bethesda's own mod browser in fo4 is a great example of what to expect if we're going to allow Bethesda to host the servers
---
Exactly.  I’m all for instant gratification, believe me.  But to think that you deserve to have thousands of something that is specifically meant to be rare as a way to make a game fun for others just because you dislike a design choice is narcissistic as hell.  That’s why number 5 kind of gets to me.  I don’t want to play a game with you if you cheat.  Why would anyone?
---
0has anybody seen the plans for Super Sledge and Sledgehammer? Anybody? I am getting mixed answers over the past few months.
---
I’m coming from the experience of doing this when the game came out and I saw someone doing this.  Now I’m not trying to hinder your enjoyment of the game so I found the middle ground to this problem. My base has everything you would need in terms of crafting benches and I only have 3 level 1 turrets so they can hit(not kill) the ghouls so I can get loot from them as well if I’m not there. The last thing I also do is I grab all the loot (weapons,chems,junk,etc) and I put it on the platform for anybody who might be interested. I’m sorry to those who feel that this is a bad thing, but this is really only going to benefit everyone. 
---
Just to be clear to people who put down a fuck ton of turrets need to chill out.
---
This would be a valid argument, if killing legendary enemies would *actually* give the deserved legendary loot, instead of giving you a fucking wonderglue.
---
Whats on the terminals that hasnt already been read by now. Ive read every story and note twice (who knows I might not have covered every inch but I'd be close) and lockpicking is a waste of a perk. Who wants ANOTHER WOOD LEG?!
---
Unfortunately i built mine yesterday, so it has to be another bug which causes the message to pop up even though noone is nearby.
---
weird i always craft arms and get leg and torso mods
---
Nice but mistake.  Last time I showed off a unique location, it was taken 50% of the time.  Now I have a new location that I'll never share.
---
You don't upgrade the cards because some people want to roam with one, two, or three lockpick or hacker card equipped I guess. IMO none of the cards should level because it sucks when you need to craft but can't fit two high leveled cards in a stack because you leveled them past the minimum crafting requirement (demolition expert for example).
---
Personally I don't bother with locked safes because half the time they're empty. I only get good loot 10% of the time maybe (a map can spawn in a level 3 safe). Actually most of the time when I find good loot in a safe it's already unlocked.
---
From data mining you can see there's supposed to be a better loot list on the higher level safes but other than the occasional treasure map in a level 3 safe I really haven't seen a difference anymore other than there being a slightly longer list of garbage you don't want. It wouldn't be bad if prewar money had any value other than for cloth. I used to get rare guns in high level safes about once a week (.50 cal MG, LMG, handmade, lever action, etc) but the only rare gun I've pulled out of a safe lately has been a flare pistol.
---
I never find awesome camps like these in game!
---
That's a clever idea. One of my characters also favours the asylum uniform and hat (light blue). I wish there were a clean plain mask. I have to make do with the stupid smile on my nose or the filthy one.
---
I still need all these and have no f'n clue where they pop up:
---
Assault rifle
---
Fat Man
---
Ultracite Gatling laser
---
Guitar sword
---
Pole hook
---
Spear
---
Tomahawk
---
Cryogenic grenade
---
Plasma grenade

Pulse grenade

Plasma mine

Sunshine meadows industrial farm junk pile, is where i built my CAMP. I know theres a lot of people, but i switched servers 15x until it got suspicious.
---
Guild and Clan isn't a very good excuse because you would never store all items in a single player. You would divide it among a couple of players that way if the clan needed the items it wasn't all down to a single person.   
---
Agreed. There are people who really only want to gank people that won’t be challenging. But if ZOS introduces PvP servers, they can make the other servers more PvE friendly by allowing us to tag ourselves as PvE only. 
---
That's how a loot table works. Which again both osrs and wow have. "Oh yes I killed this BBEG! Oh shoot I got 50 flax as a reward". Ot makes when you actually get the good drop feel deserved, and is  generally more fun to me.
---
His story keeps changing.  He only talked about one secondary account for his mule - and switching back and forth between them.  Wonder what the next iteration's going to be.
---
I only started getting the messages last night but I had not logged in since the update so I had just assumed it was the update.  Build areas have definitely changed.
---
How is that false? Your entire comment is a pretty simple explanation of why it *should* have been fixed already; if you have a bug that would be much more impactful in one game mode than another, and you're about to make a game in that mode, you should prioritize fixing it
---
You might want to clarify what's actually broken?  Are switches always on now?  Or does the light just stay powered? Is it radiant powered or wired?
---
Actually if you want to talk rl mechanics on ballistics then it should be
---
.50 cal
---
Handmade/Hunting/LMG .308 (7.62)
---
Assault 5.56 (.223)
---
Radium .45 +rad
---
Western revolver .44
---
Combat/Submachine/Lever .45
---
Pistol 10mm
---
Pipe .38
---
Shotguns as far as damage should be the same across the board with damage based on distance obviously the closer the target more damage further distance erodes damage significantly. 
---
Obviously each caliber also has its damage reduced by distance but some distances are greater than others. .50 and .308 are calibers used for sniping and some snipers can shoot up to a mile away, so significant distance, while .45, 10mm, and .38 not so much while the .44 commonly was used in lever action rifles so distance for that.
---
BUT, Bethesda didn't use rl mechanics for their basis on weapons, .50 cal should be the undisputed king of damage a monster as far as damage, and distance were concerned. Accuracy and recoil being the Achilles heel but if you fire the weapon at full auto.
---
Plus damage rates for firearms in this game are a joke, I understand that having a spiked rocket propelled hammer would hit hard but equal to a .50 cal no way.
---
Final note on my novel plasma should be hitting as hard as .308 and laser should be at least at 5.56 both should also have + fire damage.
---
It's been like 100hrs of gametime since i've lockpicked/hacked anything. I've already hacked all content terminals and i don't bother with swaping cards for looting safes and etc... even after finding plans for gauss rifle on a safe. We've been lockpicking and hacking since the other games and it just gets plain boring! **We need passive perk cards now!**
---
yes please. i also forgot how much more terrifying the yao guai look in NV.
---
I haven't noticed a change myself although I am experiencing an ability to sprint indefinitely despite having no AP left
---
Ultracite ammo is what they were using as in game currency. 
---
I would also like to add that just crafting the stable flux required for ultraicite ammo  requires other rare materials like hardened masses, glowing masses, and high radiation fluids.
---
Regardless of whether or not duping was involved, in one of his responses on this sub, he admitted to using a macro to mine more ultracite from veins than what is intended by the game.  This violates section 9 of the TOS:  "You agree not to use any hardware or software or any other method of support that is not authorized by ZeniMax or that may in any way influence or advantage Your playing abilities, or influence or advantage Your use of the Services."
---
You seem to misunderstand, Legedary enemies are *supposed* to drop a legendary. 
---
*Every time*
---
I've been using this exact spot for 2 months. Goodbye camp location. And mine is cooler, I'm just not vain
---
cool. and what im saying with that setup melee is strong enough. absolutely no need to add ultracite melee.
---
The person they were talking about had over 100k of 5 different ammos.
---
How did you make 120-150k ammo in under 30 days? I'm sure if you explain it to them, and it is not fraudulent they will unban you.
---
I like the brutalist vibe it’s got goin on.
---
Yeah “nice” as in “absolutely necessary”. No chance in bloody hell they can just wipe my 6 mutations and expect me to dish out 21.000 caps for rebuffing. 
---
Is he a distant cousin, is he the black sheep of the family. Do they ignore him due to his identity issues?
---
Omg this is perfect. This sub is so Brotherhood. Ad Victorium.
---
They shouldn't be supposed to. And I'm happy they don't. 
---
Also did devs write that somewhere? Because I think they thought a little harder about it and changed the gameplan.
---
Humble pig!
---
The Institute would be actively making the bugs worse, just to see what happens.
---
VaultTec would be making the bugs intentionally worse as part of a sadistic and completely-non-scientific sociology experiment.
---
Seriously, quit it with the conspiracy theorizing. Do Bethesda want you to spend money on atoms? Most assuredly. Is that a secret? No. Is the Unstoppables bonus some kind of gateway drug to get people to spend actual money instead of banked atoms? LOLWUT. 
---
I think I know what you mean. But if you want  '' clear'' pvp servers in my eyes there is only 1 solution. Only pvp servers with new characters. And fix the damn dupe exploit. 
---
Okay... but if they were adapting a single player game where this glitch was widely know about, why not address it somewhere the top of converting it to a multi-player game? 
---
Your comment implies it should have been a priority toward the top of the list. 
---
I think a mutation for ranged players to stack a DOT would be a cool mechanic for both PVE and PVP. Melee has a bleed, give rifle build some sort of poisoned round mutation. Think like Plague Walker but for ranged; it could even stack with your diseases using the same mechanic. Rifles in PVE arent necessarily under powered, its that the resource grind to maintain the weapon type is so much greater than a melee build that only needs to worry about keeping their weapon repaired. Melee has to farm healing items and keep mats on them to repair their weapons. Rifle builds have to do both of those in addition to farming all our ammo, and thats before you even consider prime ammunition and its requirements for farming. 
---
Which brings me to another point, add prime melee weapons and just give them an "Ultracite Coated" modification and increase the requirements for repair of these weapons to include a flux like ammo does for ranged. There should be more parity between the weapon classes to support end game play styles and afford us more interesting combinations to explore with our perks and builds. 
---
Likewise
---
Did you not do any research into what the game was before buying it?
---
I love hacking.  I grab my Jolt Cola, put on some mid-90s techno and get ready to show that Gibson who’s boss.  HACK THE PLANET!
---
Good advice to end-of-life the game. 
---
Bethesda has clearly stated their desire for the game to appeal to PvE only players. Their methods of achieving this have just been lacking. Customers stating their preferences publicly helps companies keep customers and continue investing in services. 
---
Thing is, so little change is needed to have co-op only servers. It is also silly to call this a PvP game what that is such a small part of the game.  The content is almost all PvE focused. 
---
I picked them up day before yesterday at Sutton Station.
---
Ya those people are vile. I couldn’t believe it when I came to the subreddit after hearing about this ban system. It’s absolute nonsense and people defending it should definitely try to use it as a way to get out of jury duty since their ability to use logical reasoning is basically nonexistent. 
---
They can be bought from other players for 200-300, but still an inconvenience. 
---
Ya 😂😂
---
With the way bag has screwed up every step of this game release, why would it be so hard to believe that they screwed up with this ban? I mean why would it be hard to believe they screwed up in this situation as well?
---
Haha, true. I was originally thinking that the institute was actually just Bethesda in this case, but couldn’t figure out how to depict that in the original post.
---
And along that vein, VaultTec would just be all the griefers in the game, lol
---
I’ve seen him twice but couldn’t get to him before he fucked off
---
See a random 120 show up in your house last night? You had some other person there too?
---
I just want a Mohawk with the stubble on the sides without those dumb pieces of hair hanging down over the ears.
---
A duck with Breen helmet! 
---
is this south west of watoga?
---
Some of us men have long hair too, but it looks like nobody but Ulysses gets to have dreadlocks.
---
Bethesda clearly stated in their design discussions that they liked the idea of omnipresent danger and tension between players. Reviewers and gamers were mocked for complaining about the lack of human NPCs because 'that was always the plan'. Guess what else was always the plan, people running around smashing your stuff and smacking you to death.
---
are you trying to paint playing a videogame for hundreds of hours as the grown up mature thing here? 
---
I usually just buy Antibiotics from other players; region doesn't matter.
---
Yup enemy scale to player rank.
---
That's really awesome, good use of the available pieces!
---
They were always supposed to guaranteed drop legendaries. They did in Fallout 4, and they were supposed to in F:76 as well.
---
Like, just give me *SOMETHING*. I'd literally take a fucking legendary level 5 rolling pin than getting a wonderglue and 12 caps, or sometimes literally nothing at all.
---
It doesn't keep you from getting them.
---
Two totally different arguments.
---
I used to get this until I upgraded my hard drive and GFX card. Not sure which one did it but seems to be a performance issue.
---
Well, according to this, the ocean floor would be built aswell. Atlantis confirmed?
---
I like how this sub has declared anyone that kills another player or destroys a camp a cheating PVP griefer but also have these weird rules that aren't part of the game on how everyone has to act or else it's okay to destroy their camps and kill them. 
---
Casual is still bugged at Tier 3? I bought a T3 Marine lining off the market, tired of not finding one. I head the shielded marine comes from distant thunder.
---
&gt; Did you not do any research into what the game was before buying it?
---
Really? That's what you have to come back at me with? A multiplayer Fallout game with co-op and pvp. I don't recall it being advertised as a pvp only fallout, because it's not. Again, you're being a cunt, and you should stop being a cunt. I can't wait for pvp servers to start up though, it will be a welcomed good riddance to the likes of you on regular servers.
---
They get the xp as long as they hit them with their own gun
---
Mods for *all* melee weapons. It would also be nice if we could re-skin them too. Like the Chinese Officer Sword coild be the base (for example), but you could choose to make it look like....a falcata, bastard sword, scimitar, that kinda thing.
---
Or, hell, just add some more neat Melee weapons :).
---
&gt; For Bethesda to have let this exploit exist in the game at release in the first place and then punish those who played on it by banning them completly was unfair.
---
This is a weak justification that I hear all the time.  If you are taking a test in high school or college and you find a way to cheat is it the instructor's fault for not having more safeguards in place?  If you're in a grocery store that doesn't have security cameras up, does that mean its okay to steal stuff from the shelves because they should have had better security in place?
---
&gt; I don't condone it
---
Yes, that is exactly what you just did when you tried to shift the blame from the exploiters to the developer.  Bethesda has indeed made some mistakes with this game, but pretty much any game that is released can be exploited.  Hell, if someone used a security hole they found in Windows to access your personal information, would you just shrug and say, "Well, I can't blame them.  Windows shouldn't have allowed that hole to exist in the first place"?  I know people will claim that is not an apples to apples comparison but when you strip it down to basics, it is:  someone using a software exploit for their own personal gain at the expense of others.
---
I typically only open level 0 locks and terminals if they lead to loot. Otherwise I just pass them by, as the time isn't worthwhile to use on switching cards.
---
How do the horsemen fit into fallout lore? i guess i completely missed them.
---
All I know is that if you follow your dreams and never give up you'll become what you've always wanted to be. 
---
[I AM BECOME DEATH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Vz2hSamBk8)
---
The 'they did the math' posts show it's barely plausible - and that's if *all* he did was grind the components for ultracite.
---
Try even finding a nuke zone.  I tested it - I had to server hop about 15 times before finding one, that was consistently the result.
---
Try it and tell me how much you can farm in one day.
---
And then there's the fact that he stated earlier that all he did was farm supermutants - you don't get the component that way:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/egt5mkb/?context=3
---
For days and days he claimed he'd set up a second account for his mule - and then apparently swapped ammo back and forth, so maybe *that* was why.   But most didn't buy that you still couldn't end up with a 300,000 count for ultracite ammo  And he still didn't have a good reason for swapping ultracite back and forth - maybe that's why we have this **new** 'pooled their resources' story.
---
You can proclaim his innocence.  Bethesda banned him for a reason.  He wanted it to blow up - I think it should blow up in the guilty party's face.
---
What do you suggest that legendary enemies contribute to the game? You appear to have some insight that the rest of us miss in the Legendary enemy dropping legendary loot paradigm. It appears you are suggesting that the lvl 68 Legendary SuperMutant should hold the title of "Keeper of the Kragle".
---
Guess I'm Railroad then
---
I've only listed Shielded values; regarding the casual Protected and Shielded, they may still be bugged. Been searching for a week in game for those ones.
---
Someone *did* give me casual Shielded stats though, so the plans do seem attainable somehow.
---
&gt; I don't recall it being advertised as a pvp only fallout, because it's not.
---
Todd Howard literally sat on a panel and said 'If someone really wants to kill you they can'.
---
I think it would be cool if it were more like a Carnivore vs Herbivore inverse. Something like:
---
Muscular Asymmetry - +25% Ranged Damage, 10% Increased Ranged Accuracy, -50% Melee Damage
---
I disagree with 2 as being a big reason, imo anyone who was gonna mass dupe, would dupe for anything. Even if it was just nuka colas to get caps they'd still do it. 
---
I laughed out real loud! Stupid raiders. Ok which workshop was this? And wouldn't Grape Mentats have worked to detect life, namely you?
---
Got most of mine at Blackwater and the dead end train tracks acrossed the bridge by the Harper's Ferry load in spot. When you load into Harper's Ferry, look  behind you and there will be the train track bridge. It dead ends after the bridge and the high lvl radiation barrels can't be missed just to the right of the tunnel entrance.
---
Yeah, even as a man who sports long hair in real-life I was miffed at the lack of long-hairstyles. I think I picked "garage-band" or "beatnik" or something like that, hard to remember - I've only made one character. 
---
DOF and FOV can now be modified from the in-game settings.
---
FOV ranges from 70 to 120(?), And the DOF can be turned off entirely.
---
Events. Seriously. Hoard events spawn a 3* legendary. Leader of the pack is a easy legendary. Almost all the events have a chance to reward a 1* legendary.  
---
Did they say it should? Because f4 is single player. F76 is multiplayer. It's a different game dude
---
im looking for disease cure recipes not antibiotics
---
YES!
---
What is roadmap
---
Same as they do. Junk with a chance of good drops. No insight needed
---
I have definitely seen the difference as well.  Which radio tower?  El b1 02?
---
Literally the only thing I use orbital strikes for
---
the only reason that makes me change the build is a closed door
---
Maybe it just wants to be seen
---
IF they somehow managed to fix it, and somehow made the logical decision of fresh servers after the fact I would agree. But this game engine has more holes than Spongebob.
---
I just want legendary bone Scorchbeast bone clubs
---
cool I don't give a shit. you're a fucking insufferable human.
---
Never played Fallout 76 and I don't know anything specific about the game.
---
A fraction of players across all MMOs will have ridiculous amounts of consumable items. These are usually advanced users who put long hours into the games (eg grinding). World of Warcraft obviously was notorious for users having multiple accounts just to hold farmed cloth + herbs for guild activities and bartering. Before WoW introduced advanced storage features, many characters were used exclusively for holding items and acting as couriers.
---
It is unusual for a developer to ban users who are unknowingly interacting with corrupt/hacked records. Generally, you'd assume these items are purged or devalued as a temporary solution until the root causes are corrected.
---
Ya getting that much ammo for someone like myself doesn’t seem that absurd either with all crafting perks and the materials I’ve gathered. I haven’t touched the game in 2019 and my characters have a combined level of probably about 400-500? No idea if my account is banned. Maybe I should install it on my HDD to see. If it did get flagged falsely it would be a good example account at least. 
---
Like, you want to collect them, or for using? What I was trying to say was that Antibiotics cure diseases from all regions, so they're more useful.
---
As I strictly melee player, I approve and support this message. 👍🏻
---
What about guitar hero? (which is now dead) 
---
Wow. Only once for me so far.
---
This game NEEDS enemies that are actually dangerous at high levels. they aren't over powered, they are just as powerful as they need to be. Cowboy up .
---
Could you imagine rolling around with a fucking SCYTHE?! Shit like that would be so cool.
---
Cool. I don't give a shit. You're a fucking insufferable complainer. Nice to know you don't actually have any reasonable response to being told that the exact thing you assert the game isn't was explicitly described as part of the game by the team making the game. Perhaps you should make your own Fallout 77 then it can be exactly what you want it to be. Or better yet withhold from buying a product until it is actually what you want.
---
Or..you know...continue making uninformed purchases and demanding changes from a company that already has your money.
---
To show what's coming next for a couple of months or years
---
Found a bunch of stuff at watoga last night.
---
B4 I logged off, paid it forward by dropping at v76 and overseers camp.
---
Take a penny, leave a nickel..
---
Im in the minutemen
---
It doesn't matter what they said in design discussions. Players were vocal after they announced the game and Bethesda reassured them that it would appeal to PvE-only players. That is why those people bought the game.
---
If they want the game to survive, they have to have a player base. I have no idea how many people they need or what revenue they see from PvE vs PvP focused players, but the way they develop the game should give us a clue of what they are seeing.
---
Good luck running a business that makes up a plan in a boardroom and then ignores how the market responds and where revenue is coming from.
---
Each disease cure recipe just uses ingredients from that region, but can cure any diseases.  They are not region specific.
---
Disease Cure recipes are less costly thank Antibiotics.
---
Approx time and a little detail for all the planned DLCs, expansions or any other update that they are going to release for Fo76. They have been saying that they'll be releasing it soon for the past 2 months. 
---
No, but having patience and the common sense not to cheat is. All bethesda games are 100+ hour affairs. Not every player is entitled to a perfect TSE legendary just for completing the game. The game becomes far too easy. I am happy to earn my own satisfaction as a gamer.
---
&gt;9. ⁠Duper would not dupe again even if new exploit would come up.
---
[X] Doubt
---
Yes, Relay Tower EL-B1-02. It usually drops the packages either at the Monorail Elevator, or Firebase Hancock for me. I have had one or two land at Big Bend Tunnel East, or Fort Defiance. 
---
I got a Gatling Laser lvl 45-50 with Beam Focuser, and some other mods along with some ammo yesterday. I scrapped it and learned the Beam Focuser mod. I happily applied it to my legendary weapons afterwards.
---
This was awesome, but could be exploited: it was what made some speed runs possible in fo4, so unlikely to come back.
---
The problem is they build these camps and then get bored and go away leaving the camp there for the turrets to auto-kill all the mobs without them even there to tag them.  That’s why people get to feeling like it’s a bad thing for there to be the ability to have bases like this.  While I don’t particularly agree that there should be a restriction to the build area here, I don’t think people should be looked down upon for destroying their turrets either.  If you build your base directly behind the building, it should be proper etiquette at this point to not build turrets there to kill anything while your gone, it’s selfish.
---
So, as far as I’m concerned if I come across your base and it has turrets on it directly behind the building I’m destroying it for the good of the rest of us.  Warrants be damned.
---
Oh, shit, really?! I swear I read in-game that it would only cure diseases from that area.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
The market responded by buying the game anyway. It’s not a subscription based game.
---
This is actually a pillar of psycology / philosophy . Truly facenateing. Humans were never rational. But we're really good at *rationalizing.* 
---
A good question that really makes you think, expounding on this topic: Was Hitler evil? Well the clear answer is yes, of course he was. The more complicated answer is ; **He** didn't think so. He thought what he was doing was for the betterment of the Human race. He rationalized what he did as a good thing. 
---
It's lose not loose. Loose is the opposite of tight, if you're going to leave, take that knowledge with you so you can bitch more profoundly in the future
---
No? I'm stating a fact. You and I are too scared to loot a container filled with a large number of highly desirable items because we both know that there's a good chance we would be banned for it.
---
What this also means though is that anyone who doesn't browse 3rd party sites like reddit or gamefaqs or wherever, may **not** know this, loot the container, and then get banned for it. That is unacceptable.
---
If an unknowing player can be banned as a result of looting something dropped by a player who cheated then Bethesda **must** place a warning about this on the login screen so that no one can say they didn't know. Anyone telling people "you should have known better" is toxic and unhelpful.
---
[Something like this.](https://www.gamerpros.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/the-division-road-map.jpg)
---
And the cultist outfit of course
---
Feels more enclave to me honestly. Zealous adherence and the willingness to purge the innocent so “abominations” can be cleansed. Sounds awfully familiar...
---
lol. It was a typo. Thanks anyway. 
---
100% this, unless it’s mission related.
---
In related news, the rewards within safes seem muted compared to previous titles. Like if you  fight through a building of enemies, pick a locked door, pick the safe behind the door, and get yourself some prewar money and a 10mm for your efforts.
---
Dude, yeeeeeaah.
---
Jersey Devil would be metal too
---
ahh yes your right. imagine someone holding a body in the air to soak up bullet damage or so lol 
---
If Bethesda wouldn’t be so opaque and share with us their methodology for this ban wave, I’d be willing to trust them. The thing is, I don’t trust them, and time and time again over the past three months they’ve shown that they don’t always know what they’re doing, so I’m willing to believe someone who got banned falsely until I see Bethesda show their proof/how they reached the conclusion they did. If it was just in lifetime ammo obtained, as it seems to be, then it could be very easy for someone to get smacked by the zealous banhammer.
---
You haven't met my ex
---
You know you have to specify what system and your gamertag
---
If you don't understand the difference, read my reply above to the other guy.
---
This was introduced back in January when they stopped mods and hardened mass from autoscrapping. I asked them about this, and here was the response:
---
level 2 [Valseek](https://www.reddit.com/user/Valseek) Bethesda - Community Manager
---
Hey!  Yes this will still occur for now. As you mentioned in your other  comment, this was introduced when we fixed an issue prevented Bulk from  autoscrapping while crafting.
---
To stop  Scrap All Junk from autoscrapping bulk in your inventory, but still  allow it to autoscrap from the stash while crafting, we need to  introduce some new functionality. This is being worked on, but isn't  part of today's patch. We'll definitely let you know when that change is  in place and ready to roll out though.
---
Try rolling through there without power armor. 
---
Correct. No sub. But if they are going to keep developing and keep servers up, they need ongoing revenue. They are counting on people buying cosmetics. That means active players. It also means selling more base games. 
---
If you think your argument is so solid why has every reply just been a sad little attempt to personally attack me and not back up your weak ass entitled little argument?
---
Stick to single player games and you can cheat and exploit as much as you like. 
---
They were caught up on someone playing for 900 hours. They didn’t pay any mind to the ammo being rare and having to craft it yourself. They didn’t question that you can’t swap items between two characters from the same account etc. Maybe the guy was doing things quasi legit but it seems sketchy as hell. 
---
Add the other account as a friend. Go to social, select the friend's account, and select Join. It will place you in the same world, unless it is full.
---
On the roof at West Tek.  
---
I get Treasure Maps occasionally out of level 3 safes, but, yeah, that's about it. Maybe a weapon worth 40-50 caps to a vendorbot, but once you hit a certain level it's all spam.
---
I just use a FO4 mod that shows me exactly where the sweetspot is for the locks so I can't break a lockpick unless I try. This subreddit has told me repeatedly, angrily at times even, that bethesda will not ban for mods.
---
Goodneighbor: Yeah. It sucks sometimes but it’s not like life was gonna just hand you caps and overdrive, was it?  It’s a grind to get to the top. Fk’n deal with it. Wanna buy some jet?
---
Good read. Im currently scraping radiums for mods; its taking forever. I guess there wont be much of a payoff when i can finally mod out my legendary radium :(
---
I guess your'e right. Im just trying to put myself in their shoes. I'm pissed about the duping too: It ruined every aspect of my favourite game. You missed the part where I said Im not a duper, thanks for the sermon on morals though? 
---
Ya.  Pretty sure they all just make a "Disease Cure" item.  The name is just to differentiate between the different ingredient lists.  I find Forest to be quite easy.
---
Though I have dozens of Disease Cures from just looting, so I don't actually need to craft them at all.  I don't think they can be sold to Vendors either, so they just pile up in my inventory.
---
The only time I do them is to nuke, because it saves a lot of time in the reactor room. Otherwsie, yes, I ignore them. 
---
That said, while leveling a new character I used both lockpicking and hacking, and I found lots of good plans (some that I've never seen before after 200+ levels on my main toon and 110+ on my second toon). 
---
To be honest though, all I do is nuke whitesprings nowadays or just farm ghouls there. There's just no point in doing anything else right now. 
---
Yeah pvp comes down to who uses more stealth boys at the moment or who has snipers/bait team-mates with cav/sent + assassin and better handmade rifles. 
---
All though pvp servers will be vastly different because of no slap damage. We also dont know if you can fast travel to all the same locations. 
---
Pvp needs some massive overhauls. 
---
* Pistols without a stagger perk make them useless against cav/sent builds. Needs like 2% stagger at least. Needs different values for Semi vs Auto. 
---
* Stealth boys probably need a debuff or cool-down. 
---
* PvP needs to have no map markers for players expect workshops. 
---
* "Incisor" perk could use a 15% nerf. 
---
* "Tank Killer" perk needs a stagger refactor.  Example: Semi: 20% stagger, Auto: 5% stagger.  
---
* "Adamantium Skin" perk needs a 5% nerf. Shouldn't be impossible to cripple someone IMO. 
---
* Make "downed" players immortal until timer ends. Giving pvp the chance to revive your team and gives that element of "do i go revive or do i wait.. etc". 
---
* I feel Vats is kind of overpowered when you dont consider stealth boys or sneak. It forces you to do either permanently and could use maybe a cool-down to make it not so strong. I honestly dont know what to do to vats to make it less overpowered. More initial cost? Less range? Cool-down between uses? I dunno. 
---
This is just a start and are just ideas coming from someone who pvp's and is already bored of what pvp is like in pve land. 
---
I went back to nms for my building fix in December. This looks real dope, may need to come back and see if I can make the old farm house look right now that there is terrain editing. Yours has given me inspiration. 
---
Completing them goes towards achievements and atoms
---
Selling more base games is not dependent on feedback from people that have already bought the game. It is dependent on feedback from people who have not yet bought it. The cosmetic store is also a whale market, not a player market. They aren’t looking to get a $10 skin purchase from each player, they are looking to get $k purchases from a subset. Again, that is not dependent on existing player feedback.

I think he segregates himself over with weird Uncle Radium
---
We may do PC in the future! I have a second account on PC at work actually haha. I primarily play on xbox though because I am obsessed with achievements.
---
Casuals: Helvetia belongs to the Nords!
---
if your'e on ps4 and need any mods, just yell
---
Thank you! We're not worthy!
---
Speaking of legendaries being hard to get, I’m still low level, but a quest sent me to Whitesprings where I got into it with a high level legendary. Anyway, I killed it after dying once. But then some guy using Cannibal came and ate it and I couldn’t find the body to loot.
---
Is that normal? Seems like bullshit. I wonder what it was carrying.
---
I tell myself it was Nocturnal Rolling Pin*
---
Thanks. I was looking for real info like this. Not just get downvoted by the hive mind.
---
My main character Martha is a mechanic and fixer who wants to learn as much as she can about what happened to Appalachia after the bombs dropped so she’s constantly hacking computer terminals but doesn’t pick so many locks.
---
My new girl Sylvia is a little punk who likes getting into places she shouldn’t be and thinks of Appalachia as a post-apocalyptic playground, so she’s always picking locks but couldn’t care less about what all these dead guys wrote in their diaries.
---
That’s why I enjoy this game, the online human element makes these moments possible 
---
So exploits that would affect multiplayer are not worth fixing for a multiplayer adaptation of a previous game? You don't work at Bethesda do you? Because you seem to think like they do.
---
I once unlocked a first aid kit that had 26 stimpaks. Greatest lock ever
---
I... I can't handle these animals base's ahahahaha.
---
Next challenge; CAT BASE.
---
I've been seeing more and more people posting that they want to buy a faster fire rate gun, so I'm assuming that in the next few days you should see some for sell. I prefer the faster fire rate since I got tired of hearing explosions all the time. I was able to grab 3 good ones for not too much but if I'm right the price of them will go up for you as more people seek them out.
---
I happen to LOVE this game. I'm very happy that they were accurate in their representation of WV. I visited Boston and DC and had a blast visiting all the places I saw in Fallout Three and Four. I REALLY REALLY want to visit WV now.
---
Just to see the Greenbrier (Whitesprings) Bunker if anything
---
looks like global warming got ya
---
It makes me sad to think of all the amazing weapons that have been lost to people not knowing. When I first started I dropped so many 3* weapons...I didn't know you had to "view" to see the other abilities.
---
Guaranteed someone has tossed the lvl 45 3* Instigating Crossbow that I want so bad.
---
Well, have fun with that.  This is, after all, a live service game by Bethesda.  If you expected perfection out the gate then you haven't been paying attention.   I also doubt there will be an Arkham Knight PC situation where they refund your money.  It's gone, just buy with caution in the future.
---
So it's my fault for wanting a pve only server from a game that has pve elements in it, for other players like myself who enjoy playing pve and the game instead of cheating the game and min/maxing characters so I can slap people once with a weapon once and win? I mean if the pvp was actually worth a shit I could enjoy it but it is fucking broken to pieces and not enjoyable. It is ONLY for people who care about playing the game and tweaking every little stat to be "the biggest, hardest survivor in WV" and that simply is not fun for me, and honestly most players. So now it is my fault for not knowing todd sat on a panel and said anyone can just kill you. great. All I ***suggested*** was a pve focused server for people who are not that into pvp, and now it's my fault for not researching a game fully before buying it even though I have been playing fallout since fallout 2. I just like the fallout series, sorry I didn't know every little detail about it before purchasing it. I didn't know one day I needed to impress the great u/ruggle on reddit. Thanks for the input and enriching my life with your ignorance by flapping your shit eater at me. It's been a pleasure.
---
I will make my own Fallout 77 with hookers and blackjack, and best of all, no u/ruggle allowed.
---
Hmmm... nuke whitesprings... clear ghouls, rejoin server. Seems legit. New farm meta.
---
Ignore terminals, but I will do locks. At the moment, I don't have better perks to go the Perception spaces, but I imagine this will get tougher when I do get the perks I want.
---
So Bethesda puts as much effort into their games as this guy does with his grammar and punctuation. Bro your text has bugs . Don’t post until you can come out with a finished post.

For about two weeks last month I got a whole bunch of explosive weapons. After that everything was ‘Junkies’, then after that all I get is ‘Medics’. This is from lots of server hopping and getting consistent similar yields. Very interesting because it’s as if there wasn’t a gigantic, complete and static pool of legendaries when the game was released. Instead they are creating Legendaries as they go and you get whatever is in the stock at the moment. 
---
And yes the Legendary reward system needs to be completely reworked. Why do I even waste that much time and ammo on an SB with ABSOLUTELY no chance of a legendary when I can kill a fat ghoul with one strike and get a three star legendary on a good day. It’s as if the dev team want people to farm ghouls and avoid tougher enemies which is just plain silly and ruined the game experience. 
---
Hmmm yeah that’s a good point. Well damn. I retract my comment!
---
Not to mention they also duped their fans.
---
You left two out...  the 10MM SMG and Submachine Gun. Even though they're named SMG, if you put a full stock on them they're considered rifles in-game as far as perks go.
---
The damage stats are deceiving on the two though. 
---
The 10mm feels underpowered. The numbers don't agree with that but it feels weak when in actual use. It's a good low level knock-around rifle though because you have nothing better to do with all that 10mm ammo.
---
The Submachine Gun shows low damage and ROF numbers but it actually seems to perform nearly equally to the combat rifle. It also seems to have lower detection when suppressed, and the mags are much bigger. I got a Zealot's Submachine Gun and I've been using it as my primary for the past two weeks and it's very underrated IMO. The cost to craft them to unlock the mods is horrendous though. Even a level 15 costs a ton of screws.
---
Then go cry silently in a corner
---
This is where second accounts can come in handy
---
It's not just the 900 hours guy who got banned but probably more than 10% of the community. Mods did a good job at deleting a lot of posts for whatever reason.       
---
100k was stated as limit. I played in average 8 hours a day and killed queen may 10x each day. You can't store all those fluxes you get so best thing to do was convert them into serums or ultracite ammo. If you only craft .50 or 5mm ultracite 2-3 queens a day are enought for 100k rounds over 30 days.      
---
My Bethesda Ticket is waiting for an agent over 3 days now. I don't think I will get a reply or a 'sorry'. May they unban me somewhen but well... would you continue to play a game you got suspended from for no reason?
---
I want that mullet
---
I've also noticed it loses a fair bit of accuracy in vats, due to it firing a projectile rather than it being hitscan.
---
gross. I'll take the death.
---
Holy wow! That's a lot of information thank you for creating this.
---
It's your fault for buying it without checking what it actually is, then being indignant.
---
&gt;So now it is my fault for not knowing todd sat on a panel and said anyone can just kill you.
---
Yes. It's called researching a product before you buy it.
---
&gt;I just like the fallout series, sorry I didn't know every little detail about it before purchasing it.
---
Then double yes. It is your fault for blindly buying branded items without knowing what they actually are.
---
You said the game is pay to win, not the utubers. that wasnt their point. and they are right.
---
It isn't a conspiracy, go look up the psychological tricks game companies use, getting people to "lose their virginity" to buying in game items makes it exponentially more likely they will buy items again.
---
That isn't a conspiracy, it is a well known psychological trick.
---
According to this subreddit, youtubers/streamers are toxic hate spewing colluding scumbags if they say anything negative about the game.
---
If they say only positive things about the game though then they're brave helpful righteous people and should be celebrated to speaking the truth.
---
Your final attempt to what? Bitch on Reddit? Wow, how brave of you, such an asset to the community. Gurl bye.
---
Agree with all of your points, as for your word on stealth boys though cooldown is also a great idea. When you use a stealthboy (same for berry mentats) you should have to make your move within that time or else your move was ineffective. THANK YOU for constructive thoughts it is so refreshing
---
I am aware of how MMORPGs can function how ever the effort it would take for a single person to amass that much ulracite ammo would be unrealistic unless they literally only farmed the ammo for 10 hours a day. Far beyond any reasonable amount. 
---
&gt;It  is unusual for a developer to ban users who unknowingly interacted with  corrupt/hacked records. Generally, you'd assume these items are purged  or devalued as a temporary solution until the root causes are corrected.  Banning all users interacting with "bad items" in a complex MMO is an  amateurish and somewhat desperate solution.
---
Not really really unusual for game developers to do that. They can not devalue ultracite ammo because there is no official price for it. You can not sell ammo to the vendors in the game you can only trade it to other players. Thus there is no way to devalue it.  Temp banning people who interacted with it or who had unrealistic levels of items is a way to deal with it until underlying problem is fixed. 
---
Here's a tip: when server hopping to farm whitesprings, just wait where you spawn - don't move at all. Use that time to drop any unwanted legendaries or other items from your last run. Wait until you see the front door open. If it's closed, things aren't finished loading yet. It can take up to 2 minutes sometimes. As long as I wait until that front door opens, I can run in and the ghouls spawn fresh every time.
---
The only downside is that sometimes a random jackass will load after me and run straight in, which screws up everything (I have an BE harpoon gun, so I like to run in, aggro everything, then group them all up and I can clear everything in like 3 shots + a few melee swings). 
---
Ironic given that the Railroad was a terrorist organization, and the Minutemen were the "this is fine, everything will be fine" group.
---
&gt;Destroying turret camp at WS.
---
If anything, *we* should be giving *you* caps for doing God's work.
---
He apparently switched ammo between accounts 
---
Absolutely! When I hear those wings flapping my lvl 30 self goes into MAX stealth mode, bush to bush, shadow to shadow. Actually WORKING to stay alive!
---
It’s not a revenge, they are simply after real world money and saw the game’s flaws as an opportunity. Everything else is just excuses and attempts to shift blames to the victim. ‘I raped her because she was wearing revealing dress’ kind of BS. 
---
Although not a traditional Fallout game, Fallout Brotherhood of Steel on ps2 and xbox you could play as a ghoul. Also not a bad game if you like dungeon crawlers like Baulders Gate or Champions of Norrath on ps2 and xbox. Same games, different skins/setting.
---
How about you grow up?
---
How about you play the game, instead of just thinking you can buy anything with caps or maybe real life money?
---
How about people stop trying to ruin the game with dumb ass ideas because they are to lazy or too immature to play the game, and try and earn stuff in the game?
---
I asked about the BoS mods and plans at vendors but haven't received an answer yet, I'll shoot another email today and ask again!
---
Usually only see 1* items at vendors anymore, on rare occasion a 2*.  I think people be been hoarding them waiting for player vending
---
Thanks but I’m on PC. 
---
This is close to the change I've been thinking about, except that I'd prefer if they coded it so that there were 2 separate pools for caps.
---
The base 200 per faction for each player, which resets every 24 hours, and a separate vendor based pool which starts at 0 and increases based on 25% of what any player spends buying from them.  With caps subtracted from the base pool before the secondary pool.
---
Having the secondary cap pool per vendor, allows the vendors to be used as a secondary market for players that aren't as social to buy from/sell to in a way that benefits the overall player economy(even if at a rate of 25% of purchased goods).
---
Also, having no cap to the amount of caps in the secondary pool, would turn certain vendors and the area around them into hot spots for players looking to buy/sell(mainly from/to the vendor, but also other players while waiting for their turn at the vendor.  Anyone who want's an example, can keep reading, but this was the gist of it.
---
For example, if Player A logs in and sells 200 caps worth at any Responder vendor, they will have exhausted the daily cap limit of the first pool for the Responder vendors; however, if Player A then bought Heavy Leather Arms from that vendor for 436 caps, that vendor's secondary pool would increase by 25% of that amount(109 caps).  Player A doesn't have anything else to sell right now, so they go on their way.
---
Player B logs into the same server as Player A and goes to the same Vendor.  That Vendor will have it's players specific cap of 200 for the Responders Faction + the 109 caps from the secondary pool.  If Player B sells 240 caps worth of items, it will subtract from the 200 base first the the 109, leaving 69 caps left in the secondary pool.  Of the items Player B sold, was a low level Furious weapon of a type they don't use. Player B doesn't buy anything.
---
Player C logs into the same server, but it hasn't been 24 hours since they reduced the bas cap limit to 0, so all they see when they go to that same vedor is the 69 caps.  They also notice the Furious weapon and decide to buy it, which would then increase the secondary pool by 25% of the amount paid.
---
No love for the lever? I have a TSE and AAE handmade that are great against hordes but 1 v1 the lever rifle us boss 
---
I've got some pretty good and fun 3* that I'm holding on to that aren't god rolls. My dilemma seems to be limited stash but vendor bots want to give me 20 caps for them and the trading market acts disgusted if I dare offer anything that isn't an explosive up for sale.
---
I've got a 3* instigating harpoon gun of you're interested....... it's a big ass crossbow.
---
&gt;  If you are taking a test in high school or college and you find a way to cheat is it the instructor's fault for not having more safeguards in place?
---
This is more like the answers were printed on the back of the test.
---
The mobs seem insane after the patch and they seem to spawn right as she lands. the other day i realized i was hacking at her alone and stopped to find the group. I was fighting her on one side of the firebase and literally everyone else was way on the other side dealing with mirelurk queens plural, bears, fogcrawlers, mole miners, scorched, sloths, bugs, dogs, mirelurks kings...just a shit show.
---
Nice,  I've never used a two shot it explosive.  I use an anti armor handmade but being a vats sniper it seems to eat up ap and my regular leveraction seems way better.  
---
I'll take either weightless Marine max level torso.  Is 300 caps a fair offer? 
---
For the record, I agree that melee shouldn't have prime/ultracite mods, based on the fact that prime receivers are balanced by the need to make ultracite ammo. 
---
I just don't agree with the argument that it doesn't need them because of it already being op because of one very extreme high effort, high risk build. Saying "melee doesn't need anything else because this one build can get 1500+ damage" is the same logic that makes people say "melee should get nerfed because it does 1500+ damage."
---
Who wears pigtails like the ones in game? Honestly, who?
---
No one. They're bad.
---
GIVE ME BANGS!!!
---
Yes, flashy but doesn't do much. I also built a 12 piece artillery post to shell adds, as long as I stayed out of the area it did decent in softening adds, if you accidentally enter the circle you will die!
---
This is such a cute CAMP! Great job!
---
The Enclave: This game has its issues, but we hope to rebuild it into a glorious one.
---
Alts or not, this issue needs views and to be fixed already (again). Nothing more annoying than killing everything as normal and then enemies become bullet sponges because everyother shot heals them back most of the damage you just dealt. 
---
That’s a good point. Though I think if this were an actual mistake, it’s more likely a case of wrong place, wrong time. Somehow he managed to actually, legitimately acquire in game resources to the extent it triggered the ban erroneously.
---
My camp is there on xbox and I have stairs that go up to the rail support too! I have all my crafting stuff inside the support as part of my camp. I love it there. Haven't moved since putting it all there. Swanky place though, great job!
---
Walk in and out of the elevator a few times. That will work!
---
Revel in his glow!
---
And fat fingered it a couple hundred times.
---
Totally.
---
Naming Power Armor and weapons will be in a future update. :)
---
What a prick Jesus get of your high horse there
---
Other than the increased cost of ammo it's a better perk on low damage high rate of fire weapons than explosive. The armor penetration formula is heavily biased against low damage weapons and since explosive doesn't benefit from any armor penetration perks it's basically slap damage.
---
Gamers wonder why there are so many micro transactions in games. But here they are creating their own because they would rather buy than put effort.
---
I was doing that to do last night and holy crap was he having a preteen hissy fit over the mic. I just kept doing the no emotes to him and that just enraged him even more.
---
great. you done? I feel like I am arguing with a super mutant jesus christ. fucking 0 CHAR irl am I right?
---
you see how often the ones at watchable respawn compared to whitesprings. there are way more at whitesprings than watoga. ones at watoga give you 100 ish max if you’re on a team with xp perks. think
---
Yep, I keep getting run up on by mothmen. I love it. Before the event, I was rarely seeing them.
---
NO ONE AND FOR THE LOVE OF HAIR ADD SOME VOLUME TO THOSE TAILS DAMN
---
If you can dye your hair pink in the wasteland you can sure as hell do something about those limp noodles they call pigtails!
---
... I feel quite strongly about this
---
Just bought a 3* max level ts pump someone had sold to a vendor for 84 caps. I'm not complaining haha
---
Have vision of you standing behind someone staring at a rhododendron, holding a revolver, saying "Look at the flowers, Lizzie".
---
I don't because I don't like switching cards
---
Coming soon to you in a future update! (Said in trailer voice-over voice.)

from our [Known Issues and Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/) list:

&gt; **STATUS:** Players will have the opportunity to rename their weapons and armor through the Inspect menu in a future update. **Note**: Player-created names will only display for the player who created them. 
---
Saaaame
---
Online only. You need PS+
---
Ahh, I appreciate the offer, but my stash wouldn't handle it. I run a fine balance, haha! Im collecting all types of 3* max lvl bows in the hope that one day we'll be able to strip and add modifiers.
---
Yes, it does. Test it yourself. I just did. 
---
I'm hoarding mine but quickly running out of space. I'd sell them in a heartbeat but none of them have explosive and that's all that anyone cares about.
---
I am having an issue with my C.A.M.P. i have a hole where my floor used to be and cant snap another floor pace in 
---
Me too!  But it's just not cake... and it's a weird pink colour so I haven't dared to eat it yet...
---
There def is a war drum plan since I can craft them. No idea where I got it though. Haven’t seen the grog but that would be cool. I don’t know of any mods for it. 
---
And 0 INT yourself?
---
damn u like putting words in other peoples mouths? 1. never said melee was op 2. never said melee doesn't need anything else, all I said was that melee doesn't need ultracite mods. Do me a favor hit ctrl+f on ur keyboard and type "op" notice how it doesn't highlight anything in my previous comments. Now try "melee doesn't need anything" did it highlight that phrase? 
---
My understanding is you have to have a PlayStation plus membership.  There is no offline option.  I had to buy a pass to play
---
i only use locks and terminals in the silos to bypass one of the steps
---
Alot of excuses being tossed around. The last one was maybe he traded for either the components or the ammo itself. Sure that's a possibility but if you put in a decent amount of hours you'd know the rarity and value of Ultracite ammo. No one in their right mind would be willing to trade or drop Ultracite ammo unless it's somehow easily obtainable, which it isn't. Being he claims he's also injured and lost his job (one of many excuses he's written) I don't see him buying from the black market with real cash. So basically if the trade theory is correct he knowingly accepted duped items. With 900 hours he would most definitely be aware that this game is plagued with dupers. 
---
I gave him the benefit of the doubt at the beginning.  Until the hundreds of thousands of rounds of ultracite.  
---
And he keeps changing his story.  This latest with a pool of friends - from a guy who insisted he had no friends and played; that Fallout 76 was his life, (poor me).    *Now* this *new revelation* comes out?!  BS.
---
His story, his ever changing story, defies belief.
---
No take the pie
---
Funny, I used an explosive handmade for him as well. 
---
"Honey, how do I look with the minigun?"
---
"..."
---
"Ohhh, I don't know, maybe I should use the .45 ammo?"
---
"I think I'll go with the minigun."
---
"No! The .45!"
---
I have yet to visit that whole section of the map. It’s on my list of to-dos. 
---
Use a mine or grenade on their location.
---
That's what the game needs to do at this point. It's impossible time get the exact gun that you want and duping has already flooded the world with insanely OP weapons, might as well just let players re-roll perks on guns somehow.
---
Most Free to Play games can be played online without Plus like fortnite and Apex everything else requires Plus
---
Same here. Currently have 120 cap bounty for destroying  a turret camp set up against the backside of the golf pro shop to farm
---
That's a lot of canned dog food
---
instant gratification without hard work. ‘Mommy mommy can you buy this badass explosive gun for me so I can feel like a man? I promise I won’t play until i finish homework’. 😭 
---
You can make 1400 a day taking a tour of the vendors and wiping out locations near the vendors to get stuff to sell.  In process you often pick up another 200 caps from loot and spend about 45 caps fast traveling.
---
how did u test this?
---
He doesn’t seem to fight you if you’re low level.  Before yesterday, I only saw him once. It was outside of Charleston station while I was trying to get the vendor to spawn. I was a lower level and he disappeared. 
---
My level 12 guy also saw him at the Overseer’s Canp. I shot him anyways with my Somerset Special, figuring I was too low level for him. 
---
My husband and I have been putting all the legendary weapons we don't want in the ice cooler to the left of the main door at the Whitesprings Golf Club!  We usually don't sell them because the vendor is either out of caps or the selling price doesn't justify carrying the weight around.  
---
Any tips? I’m lvl 60 and will take a silo this week. 
---
For testing, I have a rifleman alt with a Zealot’s sniper rifle. I made an identical but non-legendary sniper (Hardened, perforating). I found a “neutral” SB flying around the Bog. Crouched, targeted Torso in vats when he was directly overhead, fired a shot with one gun. Checked where the health bar went in relation to his name. Waited to go back to Hidden, which also leads to SB regenning health after a minute. After he regenned health, repeated with the other gun. 
---
Both guns did consistent damage shot to shot, Zealots consistently did more. I couldn’t tell if it was actually 30% more just going by the HP bar, but it was very obviously more every time. 
---
I absolutely hate the explosive perk. My shotgun and radium rifle have been sitting in my stash ever since the nerf. I hate the sound of it and I hate that it does damage to me in close quarters. I haven't been killed by a single radroach since I out that stupid shotgun away.
---
Locking premade doors at Workshops is the best. Nothing like killing people through windows because they can't switch cards to get to you. 
---
“We don’t want bethesda to make it pay to win!!!”
---
- makes a black market to make it pay to win 
---
always found bullshit inside safes, such a waste it should be patched so you actually get good stuff from a lvl 3 safe not  just ammo and 1 shitty armour piece 
---
That’s currently what I do, I farm white springs for about a half hour, then sell to the 3 vendors there. Then go to watoga and do the same.
---
how a bounty removal system (aside from killing) isnt in the game us beyond me.
---
i had helped a rando (not teamed) claim a workshop, after that i got to the roof and picked a toolbox and boom, 5 cap bounty, had to be killed to be saved
---
I think receiving points/tokens/currency towards better gear would cure much of the frustration of pure RNG. Currently, if you miss the drop, you make no progress whatsoever.  A consolation prize that provides even the illusion of progress would help significantly.
---
Got a glowing one in a blast zone. Then I får traveled with my flux to my camp and another one spawned... Was fun :) 
---
Very nice! I've wanted to build a house and attached garage for a while. I like the placement, too. Looks like it belongs there.
---
Right?! It would save the endgame. There are SO many ideas on how reworking the Legendary system that would bring new life to us lvl 100+ players.
---
Would be awesome to gave mannequins you can store your rare outfits on to show your collection off too.
---
Yeah, I was all over it when it was a god roll. I've moved away from it now as those 5 points into demo expert can be used elsewhere
---
There’s only one possible explanation for that amount of ammo:  
---
Glorf is a witch!  
---
Try Iron fist if you have Talons
---
I don’t have Facebook...wack 
---
No more fast travelling.. And lately i have been selling straight jackets that i can find in watoga. Ohh also i stopped buying crafting matterial, ballistic fiber was killing me. Sooo basically dont spend any caps.
---
I know right? Why bother going and wasting almost 1k ammo if you're using a 5mm or .50 cal machine gun for basically no reward, other than, "hey you got some *u l t r a c i t e*, better save that up so you can make a whole 20 pieces of ultracite ammo.
---
Oh yeah, sorry about the 150 ultracite ammo you just used to kill that scorch beast, let me send 40 scorched at you too that drop nothing but hunting rifles and pipe pistols.
---
Selling stuff to people I won't be using - there is a lot of it. And selling stuff to vendors for \~1400 a day (I've got Halloween Skeleton plan learned which gives me 55 caps from vendor with maxed Hard Bargain Perk, while cost only few clothes and plastic to craft). Currently almost maxed on caps on 2 characters...
---
I'd fight Yao Guais every day of the week rather than Rad Scorpions
---
Pop a rad shield?  
---
yeh i gather enough stuff just wandering the wastelands to make 1400 caps a day
---
I play with my wife, I pick the locks, she hacks the terminals.
---
Also, you guys are switching your cards up mid level? We only do cards changes when we level up, I think it’s better to be stuck with your decisions until you level again.
---
And it would help to solve the duping problem. Why risk duping if their is an in-game mechanic to re-roll your gear?
---
I just feel like there should be more ways to make caps honestly in this game. 
---
Bethesda wanted role playing but there isn’t really that many options. 
---
Break the rules get a ban.
---
Damn where’d u get the costumes plan?

I second this.

Hmm. I was referring to the teams that would start taking over the workshop, stop the process, and then hunt the player that owned the workshop. 
---
I do 1400/day selling off excess chems, outfits, weapons I don’t need. Only thing I buy from these days are ballistic fibre &amp; plastic. 
---
Oh no! It's there final chance to listen to you...
---
Rad-x stacks, so you can take several to get to 1000
---
No strange bloom or whatever it’s called 
---
Totally man. I mean, they could make it INSANELY costly (in-game, not Atom Shop), but that way there's a beautiful reward at the end of the long grind. Your very own, self crafted, perfect gear.
---
Brotherhood-Facist BGS fanboys that refuse to hear reason or see flaws 
---
Railroad-Idealist that are hyper focused on the flaws in the system
---
Institute-Dupers and modders looking for any easy way to get an edge and for their day to rule private servers
---
Minutemen-Filthy casuals that enjoy the game but get caught in the others crossfire
---
my Hindu friend!
---
I agree. You are certainly special by playing a cheating way though.
---
I thought they’d fixed that 
---
yupper!!!!
---
No it is not
---
that's already ur problem right there wanna know the reason why you couldn't clearly tell if it did 30% more. RANGE (depending on how far you are to the scorched beast ur damage will fluctuate accordingly.) and the fact that ur not using solid numbers(i know it's impossible as of right now to get in game damage numbers on enemies). Using a health in relation to the name isn't really what i'd call proof.
---
nailed it
---
I agree. AFKing content feels pretty gross. Don't try to justify your behavior with "oh, my turrets are weak." PSA: Not everyone trying to open the back door of the Golf Club long enough to walk through them is the owner of/teamed with the owner of the turret tower. 
---
That's fuckin priceless! Legit lmfao
---
fuck

OP is the one with the high horse...

---
For context he predicted pretty much every "spotlight" so far, including Wild Appalachia
---
I got savage divide.. Makes life soo much easier for me. Its blueberry firecracker berry and glowing resin on trees
---
Will texture mods get me banned?
---
Beyond the 1400 daily vendor stock of caps (minus about 45 for fast travelling to them)... you sell to other players to get large amounts of caps quickly.  Of course, you are just taking their 1400 daily cap allowance they have banked.
---
I don't have any issues reaching my daily 1400 value.  Hard Bargain 3, and alternating between collected Aid and Apparel one day and Junk the next day.  I keep all my Chems and Excess food stuffs, and Bulk Junk valued above 70 Caps (sells for 15-19 caps per bulk).
---
Sometimes I get two days worth of Aid/Apparel with a little Junk mixed in, then on day 2.5/3 I finish it off with excess bulk scrap.  Then after reducing my scrap those 1 and a half days I've stocked up on Aid and Chems again.  Rinse/repeat.
---
I find cap stash farming to be a bit boring, personally.
---
PRAISE HIM! PRAISE HIM!
---
Right here, my guy predicted pretty much all the spotlights so far
---
Nice ziggurat!
---
Even 3* legendaries?
---
I hoard them unless they're completely useless like the 3* stalkers melee weapons I seem to get every time..... LOL........100% VATS hit chance on a melee?
---
So, increased grindfest with no upside? To what benefit?
---
Well that's just adorable.
---
but does it quack like a duck?
---
props
---
they should be able to be sold. theyre just aid items. yeah im not looking to cure diseases, im looking for recipes i dont have.
---
I bought a TSE minigun from a vendor before the Nerf.
---
That reminds me I need to get rid of that 30lb paper weight..... LOL.
---
Rofl I was originally going to put in the post that I would sing Sarah McLachlan over the microphone, poorly. But then I realized I might actually have to do it. 
---
Perk Loadout Manager mod at Nexus. Picklock and hack everything.
---
They did fix bobbleheads so that they do not stack, but I don't think that there would be reason to change rad-x, but idk, I avoid using it because it suppresses mutations
---
1. single player vs multiplayer. different rules.  aka why we need an offline option so everyone is happy.
---
2. poor drop rates? welcome to MMOs. still trying to get AR8 to drop in Mabinogi. and an officer mod in EVE. so no excuse. though again, it would be nice to have single player
---
3. no kidding, duping would crash mabinogi back in the day, and make us players lose items and progress.  celebrated the dupers banning
---
4. da fk
---
5. ....mercy has no place in the wasteland.  its like leaving a gun runner with 1 gun. doesnt fix crap
---
6. yep
---
7. seriously give us single player, that way i dont need to worry about dupers causing issues for my play experience
---
8. w8 what..RMT?  jeez....
---
9. said every drunk driver, druggy, and wow we've heard that story so much in mabinogi. 
---
I just want to efficiently loot corpses, if I kill something I want to snach what is useful and move on not wait around while getting attacked or have to try and wade through the corpses and grasses to find the shit I killed again, let alone of theyre now meat piles in the cranberry bog damn near impossible to find all I killed.
---
trick-and-trickster body near the dam in the Mire - rare spawn.
---
Just running events I get enough extra chems and glowing meat steaks to sell to the 7 vendors. Glowing meat steak sell for 9 caps each for me with hard bargain. So 22 meat steaks is 198 caps. Blackwater mine is great for glowing meat.
---
Right - the thing is that Vault 76 is already a free fast travel destination, so it makes that whole NW corner of the map inefficient from a fast travel standpoint for a CAMP.  You're better off being in an area where I am, in the opposite SE corner.
---
Now, if The Mire had a Harper's Ferry vendor on the northern end, that might change things a bit.  Then Watoga is the odd man out.  Although, you'd still have to weigh the idea that a lot of players sell their Legendaries at either Watoga or Whitesprings... not places like R&amp;G Station.
---
um, not really sure that was a humblebrag.  what is he bragging about? 
---
First off, I am not banned, not did I partake in duping.  Secondly, I argued that dupers didn't have a right to do what they wanted with the game.  I said the opposite, even giving two examples of other industries/products that do not let you alter their products that are not in the technology or software field.
---
I didn't argue my points with you, because I already did in the first post you responded to.
---
Like I said, you are either butt hurt beyond normal internet rage, you're a fucking moron, or more likely; both.
---
You fucking butthurt moron.
---
Vibranium weapons and shields, plz =)
---
One mothman. Where the heck do I need to be for Flatwoods?
---
Oh yeah I wouldn't touch that with a barge pole. Need my stash space for my unhealthy junk collecting addiction.
---
as someone who grew up in both the DC and vacationed in point lookout, Bethesda's attention to detail is amazing. (i.e fallout 3)
---
You did say
---
&gt;**absolutely** no need to add ultracite melee
---
You didn't think someone might chime in not agreeing with that statement in a thread asking for ultracite melee weapons...?
---
Lockpick and hacking should be passive perks. You should have to accept them with a level up and then they become passive.
---
unfortunately the servers cant handle every gun on the server being named Big Iron
---
Thanks, I will check that out
---
Because they updated how icons work this patch, I thought the pop up was just pointing people to where they could change the icon, not so much about sales. It is a little hard to find how to change your icon, if you never go into the Atom shop.
---
During the first week of the game release, I used to build the turret platforms outside the clubhouse because I saw the lucrative part of farming there from level 20.   
---
When other players came by, mostly lowbies exploring for the first time I told them they could use the base if they got overwhelmed or just sit there and tag them for supplies.  If it was a bother I would just disconnect or change channels.  
---
Just like farming spots in other mmo's, "your spot" is not really "your spot".  No one got upset that I built there because i had crafting tables and everything setup for public to use so no one tried destroying it.
---
Forty something levels later i dismantled the base because what it showed me that Fallout 76 was not meant to be played this way.  This games loot system is completely random and yes you could get a TSE weapon, but it was not really worth "farming".  It was a far superior game experience to just join your friends, adventure around, explore the map, and hope you get the items you are looking for in a more natural sense.
---
Update
---
I was completely fooled.  After submitting tickets,  and working with support - I was never banned. Im quite happy about this, and enjoying the grame again. 
---
What happened: I recieved an email stating my account was banned.  It looked official, it had my account name. My mistake was not looking close close enough, now that I know it's fake,  it's obvious looking at it. So, i go to log in... and it's maintenance day.  So i look over youtube and i see the accounts are getting banned, look over reddit, see the same news.  
---
I submit a ticket,  and make this post. I waited and they checked my account,  it's fine.  
---
I feel completely like an idiot,  i should have caught the fake email.  I submitted it to bethesda, so they can see it.  Just wanted to give an update, and try to ignore the trolls. 
---
no of course i expected that 
---
Why would anyone lie about this? It is far more likely that the game is not functioning as intended, than it is for people to waste their time making up non existent problems with the game.
---
Aww, good bot. 
---
Console :(
---
Not diluted 
---
It's about in-game etiquette and respect for other players. If you can't understand that, then don't be surpised when you're held accountable for bad behavior by those who do.
---
same.  i had to move away from my camp at this monorail location because at least 1/3 of the time its taken.  i also will never share a camp location again
---
I bring it to the queen fight. It doesn't really do anything but it makes it look like I'm helping while she is in the air..... LOL. 
---
Im at a point that i have to seriously try to find something to spend my caps on and no im not a duper just when you trade a lot you get so much stuff that you dont even appreciate caps anymore
---
I'd agree, but I assume this is partly in reference to the broken drops. I can absolutely understand why someone wouldn't want to grind if grinding wasn't even functioning as advertised.
---
Is the ocean floor in this video game?
---
every-time theres a nuke, grab flux. you can max out vendors by just grabbing tons of raw flux (For some reason raw is worth more than stable) Pair that with the Green thumb and Hard bargain perks maxed out and you got easy caps!
---
well hello to you too, stranger
---
We’re not worthy 
---
you mad bro?
---
you sure seem mad. 
---
play online game, follow their dumb rules. 
---
Haha glad I'm not the only one who turns up just making banging noises tying to look busy. I,m like a yapping Jack Russell in a power armour.
---
Can you ask about the Pump Shotgun plan not being available as well?
---
Just wondering...Do you all think the presence of duped legenderies on a server might have affected the spawn rate of legitimate legenderies? I'm lvl 65 and didn't get my first 3\* drop till after the ban.
---
I tried the orbital strike last laugh trick
---
Did not work as I thought it would haha
---
Armor penetration with 25% rate of fire.
---
All the TSE boys are just making a bunch of noise. Not a lick of that explosive damage gets past the Queen's armor.
---
As soon as a new weapon meta comes around, these guys will not want to farm for it and they'll be looking for ways to dupe again.
---
I hear the queen didn’t always drop well. But was it ever said that legendaries are supposed to drop legendary weapons every single time? I know f4 was different. But I can imagine they would change the numbers for an online game.
---
3 vendors? I thought there were only 2.
---
Not sure about a radiation emitter, but for stone benches do you mean the resort benches? pretty sure those are stone
---
You got my upvote for asking and seeming to be neutral in your comment, I don't want to automatically assume his guilt either, but unless he was the luckiest SoB ever and had Super Duper proc everytime he crafted, i don't see a natural way to hit those numbers without 1) duping 2) receiving obviously duped amounts of ammo , of course the software used to detect these things is susceptible to glitches and bad coding as well. Also if passing between accounts inflates the number by constantly adding the passed amounts together than that is a terrible oversight on the coders part.
---
Forgot they developed that too
---
I’d like to see their methodology is all. 900 hours guy could be a duper, and while I don’t really give a fuck, he would deserve to be suspended in that case, but I’d still like to see how they’re coming to their conclusion and if it’s based on lifetime picked up items or not, because that would leave innocents vulnerable. 900 hours guy is a good way to try and get them to release that info, not the *what*, which we have, but the *how*.
---
I HATE locks and terminals. I have beat Fallout 4 multiple times, I don't debase my gameplay experience by wasting time with those garbage non-game minigames anymore. I mod them so IF I have the perk it's one click.
---
In 76, I walk past every lock and terminal as if they don't exist, unless I must use them for a quest. Let's not even call them minigames.
---
Tetris would be a minigame. The various cardgames in older Fallout and Witcher games. Tringo. This crap is not a minigame, it's an offensive waste of timee.
---
Resort Benches and Garden Benches are not Stone Benches
---
That's kind of how I felt using a bloodied explosive weapon. It does ridiculous damage when I'm fully buffed up - like 2K+, but I swear I do better dps against her just using a 2 shot gatling gun.
---
Yeah, 2 is one of those self-delusional justifications cheaters use to defend cheating.  "If the game just did X differently, I wouldn't have to cheat!"  But there's always an X.
---
We are currently "allowing" Bethesda to run their own software on their servers. Doesn't that sound odd? No one thinks like that, yet that's what desribes current situation, using your way of thinking.
---
&gt;Why would anyone want to pay Bethesda to host a server for them given
---
You mean, why would anyone have Bethesda pay for the servers when you could by paying for the servers yourself? Or do you literally think you would have to pay Bethesda more? Im sure the costs are included in the license. Whether you play on vanilla or modded server, you already paid for it.
---
Though considering how complicated the management ect would be, I'm starting to think that's just something people want, but something that's not going to happen. That's a lot of extra work Bethesda would have to do, to have interface and infrastucture for server mods. So are they going to do all that extra work for a game that retails on EU for about 11-20 euros. For some reason it retails little higher on US but it's still pretty fucking cheap considering how large title it is, and we all know why it's cheap. But who's going to pay for that work? People who buy new copies for those prices? No I don't think it's going to happen.
---
&gt; it used to be the norm to allow players to host dedicated server for free, then $$$ got involved. 
---
And you are clueless as to why? Money has always been involved in software. I don't remember any large title having their server software available to anyone, not even as executable form. Small games that might have grown big for one or few developers(persons) project, don't really count and match.
---
I guess I never noticed them in my Aid list to sell.  Like Boiled Water, Dirty Water, etc.
---
Will have to look today when I got on my run.  I have 30 or so of them.  I sell off most of my chems, aid, and food.  Tons of Purified Water and Dog Food is all I need to survive the Apocalypse.
---
That's so awesome!  Put a little shrine on top of it with the Mothman atom shop items, if you have them.  If not, put a lantern or some kind of flame/light.
---
Yup!  If the weapon doesn't fit our builds, we put it out there for someone else to enjoy or sell... though yes admittedly the second and third stars can be useless on many of them hahaha
---
Freestates: "Do what you want, just be cool about it (and leave us out of it)." 
---
Do you have a weapon out? I'm pretty sure the invis only procs while with a weapon out and standing still
---
u could be right, ive honestly never sold a disease cure
---
Are these real? Don't play with my heart. Really want that t45.
---
You can also just make a gaming profile. Don't have to use your real name.
---
 A dude ate your legendary!?! Forgive me, but that is some funny shit right there!
---
I did have my weapon out.. tried crouching, standing still. Nothing 🤦
---
Very good eye.
---
Hahaha... these are great.
---
Published. Not developed. There were multiple devs over the years but neversoft was the biggest Dev.
---
Yep, but not for the reasons of most. I find the lock picking and terminal mini games pretty good as a slow down.  
---
The problem is there is a 50% chance what ever they unlock has nothign behind it or is empty do to the games MP nature.   
---
Unlock a level 3 locked door, enter it to find an empty room with a brown bag filled with .45 ammo. Cuss at the MP nature of the game. 
---
The formula for armor penetration is heavily weighted against low damage. Explosive doesn't get any armor penetration at all and if it's only adding 15 damage without armor penetration it's pretty useless against the queen.
---
Dupers duped the wrong weapons. 25% fire rate increase IMO is far better than explosive because you can get armor penetration.
---
I would literally buy atoms to have a non-ethnic hair mohawk.
---
Base/Special edition Skyrim had some nice hairs that wouldn't look bad ported over as reused assets. I would legit but atmos for these if they were reasonably priced.
---
I’ll have to check that plan out. Thanks!
---
Rare items like Halloween candy.
---
I have dug up some tressures, but those are just as the safe - almost not worth the effort. But if you are bored some day then tressure hunting could be a thing to spice up the day...
---
Good, good.
---
See, if you did get banned and you know you shouldn't have- you can't prove it, no one will believe you, everyone would just call you duping scum because Bethesda apparently can't be wrong this time, right?
---
Look know negatively people reacted to the simple concept of crafting ammo in bulk.. a truly simple task by any standard.
---
Worse, people think someone would want to dupe that much ammo but at the same time think "no one would want to craft that much ammo".. I myself tend to do everything in bulk, to avoid having to stop what I'm doing to do simple tasks, have my gameplay halted.
---
But I also don't think I've actually played for more than a week since the new year, all my friends were burnt out and they were there only reason I was still playing at all.
---
Pickman: Bethesda replied 
---
You know those...things...you see that people think are people glitched invisibly in power armor?
---
Yeah...Bigfoot is already out there...
---
Ah nuts, looks like I'll have to open yet another ticket that won't get read by a human 👍👍
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn....
---
I am one of those. 
---
If you're on xbox, I can toss you some extra marine armor plans I have if you'd like?
---
And this is the same mindset taken when people pre-order for advantages of whatever trinkets that may be offered by companies for doing so.  I want it now and since I’m getting it anyways I might as well get bonus stuff too.  But really all the pre-order does is create a mindset within companies that they can release product based off hype and not content because it’s already purchased.  Thus “they all righteously say they were just trying to make the game experience better.  But the reality is they were making it worse for everyone else”.
---
No mullet option in a game set in West Virginia is nothing short of a crime.
---
I have only been came to be killed when I've had a workshop. No one ever wants to take them. For most parts I've usually left all collectors open, particularly with power plant workshops where there's extra energy, I've build extra water purifiers with some of my own resources. 
---
Workshop attacks are just cheap way for some people to get kills and possibly loot. Obviously for most parts I don't carry any valuable loot, as it's so easy to lose it.
---
I think the thing was there was a huge amount of ammo being transferred, it didn't necessarily have to be at one time, just withing a specific timeframe
---
Mini Nuke planters?
---
I'm right there with ya.  I usually ask my teammate to do it.  She's been playing Far Cry this week so I just stare at the locked container, sigh, and hope she comes back soon.
---
I open all the safes, I've found good plans and rare weapons within lv 2 and 3 safes. As for terminals, I find them fun to hack, although the reward is most times minimal.
---
I wish we could develop the skills for hacking and lockpicking, just like we have for character levels (you gain a X amount of exp for each sucessfull lockpicking/hack until you reach the level 3 threshold for both)
---
Not to mention the lag that ensues from the spawns in the first place. Fucking missile turrets then adding to it. 
---
They never red anything haha
---
I server hop and kill the behemoth at Solomon pond, each time he dies he drops 20 caps and 5 weapons or armor pieces.
---
I've commented this in other posts but I really do feel like they expected this game to be more PvP heavy and thus had planned their DLC around that premise, evidenced by March's PvP update. I think fan backlash on PvP and the need for more PvE content forced them to either scrap or retool their previous plans to better appease the fanbase. That would've set things, like the roadmap, back considerably. Ya can't release a roadmap if you don't have a concrete idea on where you're going yet... It's frustrating, I agree, but I think that's what happened here. With all the outrage and controversy this game's been getting I feel like they're trying to play it safe and wait before they release premature plans.
---
It was just a Legendary drop.
---
There was a point where I had four different Tesla Rifles.  Furious, Two-Shot, Anti-Armor, and a 3\* Berserker's one (+%50 limb damage and reload speed).
---
The Two-Shot wasn't all that useful compared to the others, so I sold that.  Of the others, which I kept, it consistently seemed like the Anti-Armor hit the hardest (the Berserker one probably would if I wasn't a Vanguard build).
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm on PS4!
---
Do you have a helmet on?
---
how do you transfer stuff between characters? Do you use a 3rd party to help, or is it possible to run 2 instances of F76 each with one character loaded?
---
Originally, yes. Well, legendary gear (not necessarily weapons).
---
It also honestly makes zero sense to lower the drop rate in an online multiplayer game where you're the NPCs since that set up has a need to incentivize trading. 
---
Those suits of armor weigh 2.5 pounds, I’m carrying about 20. 
---
Incidentally, wanna buy some armor?
---
I just want my long, straight hair. That's all. Why no long hair? 
---
When You have to justify what you do Then what you are doing is wrong. Thats like saying I kicked a kid in the head because no one told me any better or stopped me.
---
No.. they don't have any damage resistance so I've never bothered. You'd never see my scars from the queen either 😂😂
---
The foundation + stairs could not have been any more relevant. 10/10.
---
Brah, I hit it square in the face with a master ball but it still got away, just flew off smh.
---
Rad-x stacking was patched two patches ago. Does no longer stack. Not dilluted either.
---
I think the drop rate is fine, the vendors are full of junk legendaries every time i go there. 
---
It might be.  It's true that Anti-Armor is buggy with energy weapons.  It's unclear to me if that's something Bethesda quietly fixed or not.
---
what the duck did I just see?
---
Hahahahaha you made my day Bro 😂 
---
Yeah I don't really know that they can fix it in the future but I think it's not possible.
---
The engine is the main problem I think.
---
Ok. I have read your post. 
---
Now, explain how exactly Berry Mentats is not a counter to people using a Stealthboy.  Even if it's a super with hundreds of Stealthboys, how is Berry Mentats not a counter?
---
You keep saying read the post, but offered no explanation in the original post about why Berry Mentats should be discounted from your arguement.
---
I sell Marine Tactical Helmets. They weigh 0.1 and are made with glass, plastic, &amp; rubber which are all over the place.
---
I craft 49 (and receive several xtra with Super Duper). I have Charisma 4 with 3-rank Bargain perk... without any chems i can sell them for 27c each. I use any xtra aids/chems/bobby pins for the remaining vendor caps. I then buy something if I want it and sell an extra helmet or two to recoup the fraction that vendor has after I buy. 
---
In the end u usually profit 1200c and get some stuff I need.
---
Since the helmets weigh very little I can go about my game with maybe 10 with me in case I run into Graham or the traveling vendor.
---
Shoot. Them. I do anytime I see them, and then everything else in that base.
---
Happy to hear that!! The Greenbrier is amazing and be sure to visit Lewisburg and travel up to the New River  Gorge area as well!
---
I hope you get to make the trip and welcome!
---
What do you mean by "passive"? Same thing as how strength increases your carry weight? 
---
That's a lot for a gatling, how did she go through 5K rounds a day? I'm curious. Despite being a heavy gun the gatling is ,comparatively, very ammo efficient, mostly due to it's slow fire rate. Even with multiple SBQ runs and using it as a main weapon there's no way I could consistently go through anywhere near that amount, and I kill a lot of stuff
---
I’m living in DC now and was impressed with that as well, obviously just biased since WV is my home :) 
---
My camp is at the same spot!  Mine is very pedestrian compared to this.  great job!
---
I love lock picking.  I like getting plans from level 3 safes.   I only have a 3 perception and I'll swap out Glow Sight for the three picking cards so it's not terribly annoying for me.  Hacking.... not so much.
---
Whoa, that's interesting.  Idk how your dude is getting this stuff, but I'm surprised it hasn't blown up yet.  Also, it seems like there's a new event event every two weeks or so, which puts "Sheepsquatch" around.... October?! 2spooky4me
---
People would lie just to trash the game. People lied about being able to steal from others inventories, why not lie about this too.
---
tbh I've never found legendaries of the weapons I use... so even though I have a dozen I still use standard gear. 
---
Omg, make it incognito, so it just hides in the background.  Scare the crap outta people wandering by.
---
found a woman who weighs roughly the same as this building, can we burn her? burn the witch! burn her!
---
If you're on PS4 I can do it for you until you learn the ones you want. If not, my best tip is use the intelligence perk card that reduced energy weapon material costs. I found out about it the day I scrapped my final one hehe
---
I agree,a nd the change that puts the player icon showing on the workshop is actually really hurting low levels, as it is a like a giant billboard saying "COME ATTACK THIS WORKSHOP AND SCREW OVER THIS LOW LEVEL PLAYER!"
---
I have been playing this game for a bit over 2 weeks now, and before i was able to take over workshops, and never had them contested, but now with the GIANT icon on the map, i have been killed/and or had my workshop taken over by +100 level players every day since the change, and 3/4 of the time the players then dont even take over the workshop, they just wanted to kill a level 25 player.  
---
The SBQs legendary weapon...The bloody disconnect
---
Glowing Fungus Soup and an issue of Tesla Science (I forget the issue number) also increase Rad Resist, as well.  Probably still not enough to get you to 1000 from 700, though.
---
Always down for more content.  But you're right, there is a ton of opportunity with the Cryptids.
---
I seriously need more budget to really make my brothel build pop.
---
I need a big neon "Whore House" sign.
---
Because there are no lunchboxem.
---
All hail the mothman.  
---
Cult reminders  
---
1. Pycho Monday is once again canceled, Please bring Buffout or berry mentats instead.  
---
2. Garry has been banned from the vodka, do not give him anymore we already lost 3 wise ones to his drunken fists.  
---
3. Reminder to all cultists just because we sacrifice the none believers doesn't mean we have to be cruel. Rippers are banned for human sacrifices for a reason. You know who you are Garry. And next time we catch that We will tie you up for the deathclaws.   
---
4. Stop worshiping the freaking scorched mothman, put them out of their misery, not give them gifts.   
---
It is though! They should have made some signs in the atomic store that are just the eyes of Mothman, so it scare TF outta people just wandering by.
---
&gt;Or do you literally think you would have to pay Bethesda more?
---
Yes, I do not think Bethesda is going to host private servers for free, why would they?
---
I'm almost positive people want to be able to run and manage the server software them selves and not be at the whim of an update breaking their server because of mods, etc. It would be much better for this kind of game (modded) if you could actually directly access your server for more intricate management, like custom backups, etc etc
---
Those are mini. I need a bomb like the one our brothers and sisters praise in Megaton!
---
I thought explosive in 76 worked differently. I know that's how it worked in FO4, but in 76 it seems to be a much larger damage increase - like it just does the full damage of the weapon as an explosive aoe.
---
I meant diluted doesn’t suppress

I found them two days ago in Harpers Ferry where they always are.
---
You can edit the post, there's still time.
---
I’m bummed I never actually run across anything like this in the game. I only ever see really hastily thrown together shacks. I personally spend majority of my time building camps. Hahaha
---
Perfect.  Good enough for me.  There were gorillas in FO4 right? I mean if they can argue that there used to be ancient EXTINCT giant sloths around West Virginia and therefore we're going to put them in game, then I think we can bend the rules enough to put bigfoot in Appalachia
---
Question, but when using mods to for graphic textures... other people dont see them, its only client side right ? 
---
IE: Clean plaster walls - while they look good on your screen, they still look horrible on my screen right ?
---
My theory is that each location has a legendary cool down.
---
Damn, I don't have a twin on pc but I know of people modding them. I need platform reps lol

Sadly that event can gift you ANY weapon plan, so to find the one you want is like looking for a needle in a haystack....
---
Mommy: no

Son: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Yeah, once you start getting gear you like that's level 45/50 that's pretty much what you'll use forward he rest of the time you play. After that it's mostly refining your perk choices and stuff like Mutations.
---
I seem to recall these being awarded for the main quest line of each zone. Not like the main quest of the game but more like the Grafton Mayor's quest for instance. I don't remember ever seeing a second copy, which makes me think that it's a one time deal. Have you finished the Grafton quest line that has you running around Toxic Valley?
---
Are you saying my Barbed Drill is not legendary? I killed a deathclaw with it!!!
---
If Charleston to Harpers Ferry is a 30 minute walk, then Harpers Ferry to Bethesda (or Rockville, really) would be less than a 10 minute walk. You fly to Boston and I'll meet you in Maryland.
---
The responder vendorbot that travels (often around Charleston) also has that plan sometimes. That's where I got it.

&gt; unique mutations like regaining health

ha, right now it looks like everything has that mutation

Go grab a bag of dicks bro.

We are actually planning a trip there!   We won't be able to visit every location unfortunately but we can always save that for another trip.  This is what we have planned so far&gt;&gt;&gt; [FO76 Road Trip Map](https://imgur.com/lbpMtp3) (starting at the pumpkin house).   Any tips you could give (what's good to eat, places to explore) would be much appreciated!  We are so excited!
---
The only way that would work is by balancing how may players per faction. Otherwise you are gonna get majority Raiders and BoS.  The other factions will be outnumbered by a whole hell of a lot.

2 in watoga, 1 in harpers ferry, 1 at pleasant valley station, 1 at whitespring station, 1 at enclave bunker, 1 at Lewisburg

Thats my routine

0.O You're so right! I mean, you could just use a scaled down version of the scorchbeast model and scare the crap outta people. I wouldn't care that it's not quite from West Virginia. Hell, through in Champ, the Wampus Cat, or Lizardmen; I want to hunt them all!
---
Jesus, what "psychological trick" are you talking about? There is a shop, with things to buy. Of course they want you to spend money there, that's what it's for!
---
I ignore terminals

Everytime i went back to my camp... At least three times... Dude was waiting for me... He is lucky i am farming lead.. Or i would have pumped him with some..

That’s damn cheap, but maybe I missed the point myself: The problem is forcing me to fix their problem. 
---
It’s just people trying to farm tho, that’s their method 
---
Yes, but only while in a Liberty Prime PA, denouncing Commies on Voice Chat.
---
All I want is instigating gauss 😢

They could have made some real simple adjustments and make the game a totally different experience. For instance limit the number of three star legendary ghoul to ONE, and one-star to TWO in the whole WS area. People will be going from room to room to look for those few good ghouls, more hide-and-seek effort when dealing with a bunch of easy enemies. Now you just walk into the golf club and good fortune will rush to you. Axe them down, get the loot and hop. Very dumb and dry. 
---
While in Cranberryborg you need to give all level 65 and 80 enemies legendary drops simply because the amount of work put into taking them down is long and hard. If you can shoot them down from mid air, better loot than killing them while they landed. Give players some challenge and better rewards, people will be motivated and play hard. I 
---
Also if you only contributed 5 damage in a SBQ fight while another player put in 800 rounds of ultracite ammo, there HAS to be a difference in the quality of the loot. I’ve participated a few scorched earth in the past few days, most of them failed miserably. Majority of the players were level 10-50 (yes level 10 players go there to get a cut too). Most of the time the queen was sonic attacking me while the rest of the players mind their own business. It was just hilarious. A zealot was hammering me real hard when I fired full blast on the queen. A level 55 guy nearby attempted to help, I heard like ten shotgun blasts yet I was still being hammered. So I had to stop shooting, switched to axe and killed the zealot. The guy gave me a big thumbsup. It was totally heartwarming under the orange sky. 
---
He's not really out of caps if u didn't sell anything to him in past 20 hours he has 200 caps
---
Sure would be nice to have a perk card that can make a SB land once or twice every 5 min... About 25% of the SBs I kill in the wasteland don't ever land, consuming tons of ammo. The ROI is not worth it, but it's fun. 
---
Halloween candy was on their list of commonly duped items, so rare or not having 100,000s of them probably means they were duped. I'd wager Mr.Fuzzy tokens to be on that list as well, just like nuka colas were.
---
We're all pink on the inside, soldier!

Its hallow and has all my workbenches and stuff. So its about as practical as my previous more serious barnlike build.

\*X-Files theme plays\* Mother of God....

Though how funny would it be if they found a way to use the weird elongated character models when you glitch into power armor as the bigfoot model?

Needs more human sacrifice

There is a flatwoods monster right next to the disposable site directly east of whitespring...

I for one would love to be able to be Witnessed riding in to Valhalla, shiny and chrome! V8 V8 V8!

But seriously, being able to run up to a group of PVPers and spike a nuke football in the middle of them would be beyond hilarious.
---
It definitely shows up more often, for better or worse.
---
Better because it's a great source of Ballistic Fiber.
---
Worse because its obnoxious sonar attack is worse than the Scorchbeast's.
---
yea I know it was for dabva
---
Is there even a Deep Pocketed Metal Armor Chest plan that can be found from vendors? I have yet to see one.
---
oh man im sorry, they are gonna ban you from this sub now for making a common sense solution. hasta!
---
Same, I haven’t equipped the Hacker perks in ages, and rarely lockpick anything, since I have yet to find anything useful/important in a safe/behind a locked computer. 
---
Exception is during Powering up Poseidon where Hacker 1/3 is useful. 
---
Her health and damage resistance is proportional to how many people are there. It’s not broken, you’re just bad.
---
I do skip all locks and terminals. I have not found anything worth the effort on the other side of the door. I keep bobby pins to sell and get that last 3 or 4 caps from vendors lol.
---
People underestimate prime recievers but they literally melt the SBQ if you have a decent legendary, but if you want to go totally insane: 3* bloodied with 2 other usefull perks meat hook with adrenal reaction, talons, twisted muscles, full unyielding armor and all the perks.  the thing with the meat hook is that it's currently bugged so both unarmed and single handed melee perks apply to it lol. I've seen screenshots of people with over 3.5 dmg with a meat hook.
---
It was 100% weapon damage before the TSE nerf but now it's only a 20% damage buff. If you use armor penetrating rounds on your gun the explosive doesn't benefit from the armor penetration. 25% fire rate gains benefits from armor penetrating ammo.
---
Anti Armor/25% ROF is better than Anti Armor/Explosive on something like a .50 Cal
---
tl;dr is people that cheat always have a way to rationalize their behaviour and rationalize or minimalize it's affects on other people. They except little or not accountability and even when they do they still find a way to shift the blame for their behaviour onto someone else (other players or the company that made the game). Basically just selfish people with minimal insight into or ability to moderate their own behaviour. They can't accept not having everything they want and will find any number of excuses to get those things while not giving a shit about other people.
---
Ignore terminals mostly, locks I open. Even level 1 and particularly 2 and 3.
---
I use the mod on PC to fairly fast swap my lock and hack perkset. The version I used required that I open the perk management window normally, then quikcly press "2" and exit it and unlock what I want. I don't know if later version have made is so you can switch it directly from normal view, without opening pipboy and perk window.
---
Then switch back to my combat/normal set which after starting to somewhat use PA also, I now have 2. So I have 2 normal "combat" /exploration sets, for PA and non-PA normal fight, then one for locks and terminals, then one for crafting(I used to be able to have the locks and terminal on same set as crafting but now I've run out of intelligence so I have to have them as separate). Then after some mistakes and shit, particularly as when I'm mostly NOT using PA, I get much more radiation than PA users, so I created a fifth set just to quickly equip streched genes, so I can heal radiation with radaway. Normally I have a perk that heals smaller amounts of radiation during the day, but even daytime it won't be enough againts groups of bloated ghouls.
---
One particular set of locks I find strange. Lots and lots of people visit WS bottom floor, but there's level 3 locked door with level 3 wall safe behind it, and nearly never has anyone opened it or the other locks. I've seen them being opened only like few times. Just recently saw them to be open and I was really liking it, as then anyone can go loot them quickly. It helps to motivate me to keep opening them them as well. Of course probably not a lot of people go check them, but that's entirely their loss.
---
Without easy way to swap the perks I would probably open no level 3 lock.
---
Hmm when I'm exploring new area, then yeah I tend to check all terminals too. Many of the level 3 terminals however just open a safe with nothing extra else. But you don't know it unless you check, so I check.
---
I totally agree.
---
You are the douche bags everyone is screaming about being griefed by. That isn't pvp, that's an ambush you cousin fucking tool.

I also craft but I make the Skeleton Costume. With 3-rank Bargain, I sell these for 56c a pop.
---
How do you see a dog?
---
I've seen ppl get griefed at WE but no one ever effs with me

&gt; That mod is currently broken and the fixed version is going to be a lot less convenient than it was before. It

It's usable if you had used it before. You can't just create new sets but were you creating them daily before?

Explain me how one extra player would stop us from causing her any more damage.  First we were with 3, she took 10%  damage in less than 5 minutes,  then the lvl 44 player arrives and she doesnt takes any more damage at all.

Thanks for the confirmation. Can you add a screenshot of what you see to this post?

Wait for DLC....

The Overseers quest isn't finished, and will likely continue in future content updates. MODUS went haywire a long time ago and wiped out the Enclave. His primary concern is  re-establishing connection with the Kovac. After this is done it grants you access to the nukes after assessing the threat of the scorched beasts. The Nukes defeats the scorched beasts by sealing up the fissure's. Next time you nuke one check it out, it'll be sealed. (Once the nuke zone dissipates it goes back to normal though). 
---
There's no real closure because the story isn't finished yet, just this chapter of it.
---
Up until this last patch I opened everything I saw,  but I was using the mod "Perk Loadout Manager" (that allowed for quick shuffling of perk decks) but Bethesda broke something with this last patch...tbh not having that mod almost makes the game unplayable for me at this point....  To your point, shuffling cards is super annoying.
---
THERE you are! I knew something came before the pig but couldn't find it to link it!
---
C'mon, they're only 18 screws per gun to craft, you should be able to whip a couple hundred out easily.
---
(Not really, I hate screws)
---
You can kill players who are in pacifist mode, it just takes a while, or so I am told ;)
---
Huzzah! I shall wait patiently. Keep up the great work! I can actually feel the game getting better!
---
Yep, both of them as I don't really want to waste points one something more useful.
---
Or that you don't have to exit a building or cave in order to fast travel.
---
Yeah ik but i didnt wanted to waste any more ammo lol
---
Nope. Your character's save record (and everyone's character's save records) that read the plan before patch 6 still contain the buggy COBJ record reference which will prevent you from reading the plan and learning the proper record. Bethesda needs to patch our saved game files stored on the server for it to be craftable.
---
Yeah  ^ super bummed about this... havnt played much since update because it's so annoying to switch cards  constantly
---
How are they raiders if you came over and bothered them. They made it quite clear they didn’t need your help (which you said you were only giving to get something in return) 
---
I think you’re the asshole in this situation. They were just trying to level up and you came over and started antagonizing them. 
---
I found an area with some of them scattered around, but they exploded when I got close. There didn't seem to be a way to disarm them, or even pick up the caps after they blew up into my face. I'm trying to remember where the heck that was at!
---
I have multiple handmades (furious, TSE, AA) and none match my \*\*\* Furious Combat Rifle in vats. That said it also has +50% VATs crit damage.
---
Yes, we shouldn't have to use perk cards for these once you learn how to pick a lock or hack a terminal that's it no card needed
---
The water does what now?
---
I had 2 high level players come to my camp 2 days ago and give me stuff. Made me some handmades and have me a few other things! It’s so nice that players do this for each other. I gave my blood packs because I’m pretty sure that’s all I had of any use to high level players! It really makes a difference to us lowbies! 
---
This is why I love Bethesda games, esp with our ability to build our own settlements.
---
Now if only we could leave these set up long term in world for everyone to stumble across and enjoy.  I'd pay a reasonable amount each month for a dedicated plot on a server that would persist after I log out.
---
well, i'm not sure I wanted to talk RL mechanics on ballistics but thanks for that info blast. I shall digest it at my leisure, thank you :)

Yeah Im way further south. Didnt wanna get hit everytime theres a nuke. So far the spots been good. Close to the action but not singed. Xx

I just want my darn neon "OPEN" sign to be brighter.. it hardly looks like it's on when it flashes

You completely left out the black powder, lever actions, and gauss.

Ok, however they could at least give us something to nibble on. Here I got squat. Just a brutal wall.

when a player went into the developer room, he saw one on a shelf next to other bombs, surely we will have them in the future

Find a friend and both of you put rad sponge on.

Honestly, I would be OK if someone camped out with a single turret. To tag the enemies especially if they are low level, but this area is a good area for fighting together.
---
Hogging all the kills and experience is just stingy
---
If you had of kept at it you would eventually beat her, but by your own admission you just stopped and ignored her. As the other person said, that's your bad.
---
I always do terminals for the lore. But the safes haven’t had anything worth taking the perks needed for it
---
As in once you get the card you just have the perk enabled with out equipping it..... people are fucking lazy to be honest they should have just kept the perk system from previous fallouts instead of this jack-of-all-trades bullshit. 
---
It really makes the whole perk system a joke when you can just swap cards any time you want. its fucking dumb, they should have also tied learning recipes to be able to craft it and should have had higher crafting requirements the system makes character development a pointless. 
---
The thing is that PA has a hidden bonus to Rad Resistance.
---
PA with 300-500 Rad Resistance will take less radiation damage than a hazmat suit with 1,000.
---
I use T-51b Armor with no bonuses and I take less than 2 rads a second in Nuke Zones.
---
doing my normal rounds of collecting and selling to vendors, never seemed to get me anywhere fast. For a while, I hovered between 5 and 8K, always fluctuating if I found plans or other stuff to buy. I didn't hit the higher CAPS amounts, until I started to sell stuff to players through Reddit. It's kindof a shame there isn't an in-game contained way to sell stuff easily. 
---
I've only been wanted once and it was from accidentally picking a lock. Buddy's base fit in so well with the surroundings I figured it was a bunker I hadn't explored yet - nope - WANTED 10 Caps lol.
---
I dropped my junk and ventured to the Lumber Mill on the Northwestern part of the map - some guy came and cleared it for me. 
---
Regardless, next time this happens I know who to call. 
---
ah! I didn't see the fissure closing and a guy in my party fell into the fissure site after we nuked it: so we had a bug here?
---
how do you know about MODUS wiping the enclave? I feel like I red all the terminals and I never found out any information on what happened to the residents of the bunkers.
---
If you go back to the silo where you launched it there should be a final holotape waiting for you. It isn't anything special, but it's something.
---
I agree ofc. I’m lv171 and did all the quest...  I wait for march and patch7. 
---
I had the same thing happen to me at the abandoned ammo factory a couple of weeks ago (back when the contested area was much smaller). Even without VATS crits, six ranks of rifleman, covert ops and sandman make for a pretty easy kill when the target is dumb enough to stand out in the open.
---
Eventually, I let them take the workshop and just started stealing the ammo (they were making the kind I needed anyway).  They finally figured out what was happening there and locked the fabricator, but completely missed the fact that they were using MY power setup which used 1 large generator and the Monongah power box. So I just turned off the power at the box. The fabricator still looks like it's running, but it wasn't making anything.
---
It's only a topic because people love drama. I'll worry about it being a problem *when it becomes a problem*, and not before. 
---
Bethesda is VaultTec confirmed!
---
cures all diseases, gives slight health, and fills water meter
---
yeah, the SMG 10mm fits into a funny place, i always class it as a pistol which it totally isn't, my bad!  
---
But if you do start to compare it to the automatic rifles it falls woefully short, ap cost is high, if you use it outside VATS you spend most of the time looking at the sky!  
---
The 45 SUb Machinegun definielty warrents another look from me, I'll have to compare it to my rifles and see what it's saying!
---
Fine you might be right but occam razor says that he must have done something wrong or he would not have been banned. Now like juicehead said it could have been a false positive but if that’s the case we’ll hear about it for sure.

The post 50 game is all about tweaking your build, so that would be a perfect time to start working on your dream PA set. So long as you realize you're not going to sit down and craft it all in a single session... It'll be a fun little project for you to work on once you've run out of quests.
---
What? Where in WS?
---
pretty sure its because that would have to be network synced and models arent always synced when playing side by side with another player
---
well, fuck me. Only had the game since launch
---
the only issue with that in FO4 was i found after all that trouble arranging the body just so, when i fast traveled away and back again, the bodies would all reset or disappear
---
If you pay $15 for a clearly marked as temporary buff, that's just a tax on being stupid  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯ 
---
I only knew this as I saw someone do it during a beta livestream 
---
Where are you getting +10% from? AFAIK Bethesda hasn't released banned player counts yet.
---
They did specifically say that less then 1% of players had duped items removed during the item purge.
---
It's a long way from less then 1% to more then 10%.
---
No one deserves a nerf. Buff the others to allow them to compete. 
---
Don't hobble the best options, make *all* options viable. 
---
||explosive was a *bit* too powerful, though and is an exception. It did get overnerfed though.||
---
Nah, let em stay banned. They knowingly cheated, and we're better off without them. They'll just find a way to do it again if they unban the actual dupers anyway.
---
thanks, hopefully i’ll find those plans!
---
well i learned something new today. lol i could see that becoming an issue 
---
dammit....i still yet to get one out of a machine.
---
RNG gods hate me.....
---
it is confusing why they took out this functionality from FO4, I would love to decorate my CAMP with 100s of garden gnomes and teddy bears
---
How about some explosive dammage from grenades or a fat man, fired around the player?  I haven't shot another player before so not sure.
---
See this is where you might need to open your perspective just a little bit.  What you wrote there could be considered good advice or practice but it 100% is not the way everyone does it at all.  Plenty of guilds have a designated person that acts as a quartermaster (especially in games where there is not guild bank) to hold the lions share of supplies.
---
Source: am not a MMO noob, have played many online games since Everquest+AOL.

I'm not saying you're wrong, but I *am* saying your opinion is not an absolute fact that applies to everyone else on the internet playing online games other than you.
---
well, I'm looking at the semi auto rifles as that's how I play, I like the lever but i'm not specced into it. I remember when i used it finding the reloading time a bit annoying, especially when you have an enemy breathing down your neck! I do seem to remember the reloading getting a bit faster though, not sure due to me using the speed demon mutation or if they fixed it up when they did the other reload fix. I also (think I) read the other day that the reload is faster in 3rd person but i could be making that up.  
---
If i had space in my perks for the lever action, I'd have it in an instant but currently i'm living the 80's commando dream and completely wasting most of my bullets :)
---
Lmao "I dont code but Im still gonna give coders shit after telling people not to shit on coders"
---
Classy
---
Yeah, pretty much.  The small bits of junk aren't work the time swapping out cards.
---
It is where once you've already given them your billing info to purchase it once you'll be much more likely to do it again. Because 1. You don't have to give them all your billing info again. 2. It is well known psychologically you are much more likely to do something again over doing something the first time. 
---
If you can't understand how that is the case lmk and when I'm actually at a computer I can supply you with peer reviewed studies that show this.
---
Now that I think of it...where did you find the Shielded Casual plan?
---
afaik legendary enemies don't always drop legendaries, unless it got fixed
---
&gt;	There's also no win state in this game so I don't know how anything could be pay to win here.
---
This is the crux of the matter, and the thing people seem to be too high on their own outrage fumes to see. 
---
really? ive never have tha t on my games. i aways move the first body afte the bridge from sanctuary to look as if he was leaning over the bridge 
---
Crippling weapons and perks to get her to land.  Melee is way more powerful.  A lot of people just won't show up because it's not worth it.  The last 3 times I went the loot on queen never appeared.  
---
In my own personal experience, I found that after I hit 50 (or at least after I discovered the whole map and did all the main and faction quests, which was a little after level 50) what the game becomes is the great legendary loot hunt. So that decked out shotgun/hunting rifle/assault rifle you built with all the goodies? Garbage. Because one day you're gonna find a 2 or 3\* legendary gatling gun or handmade rifle or shishkebab or whatever and it's going to make you want to change your whole playstyle. And then you're gonna be cruising for legendaries just on the off chance they drop something with some cool effect you don't have yet.
---
And as a far as the power armor goes: Build two of them and carry them both with you at all times. I personally have an excavator 'pack mule' armor and an X-01 'about to get my ass handed to me' armor on me right now. Yes the requirements are high: THAT'S THE POINT. It gives you something to do and work towards. In fact I've got a third ultracite 'jack of all trades' armor I'm working on now that I keep in my stash and work on from time to time. And as far as upgrades go, that's just another thing to keep you going from vendor to vendor, day to day in hopes today is the day you get those calibrated shocks or whatever it is that will make you complete.

I spent a very long time farming, crafting and then destroying Radiums, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wishes to remain sane.

No one deserves a nerf, yall are fucking dumb for perpetuating that stupid line of though, Beth wants you to think like this so you will accept them making enemy bullet sponges and then in a year your going to bitch that you need something to help get rid of the bullet sponges.

the only nerf that was deserved was the fixing of the exploited with stacking bobble heads and magazines which made it seem like TSE needed a nerf. 
---
&gt; I googled you and it says you made a bug fix mod for new Vegas.
---
You missed a few. Try 150+ mods. I've spent years making mods for Bethesda games, elbow deep in them. I have slightly more insight into how they code things than the average rando on the internet.
---
Oh and you called me an anti-Bethesda troll. Yeah, I made that many mods for games made by a company I hate.

Antagonizing? He was just offering help, they could have easily used their mics to tell him they didnt need help.  They started the pvp.  Op isnt the asshole.  And neither are the other guys.  They just playing the game. 
---
One of the power plants
---
&gt; If ultracite is currency, then the 360k was likely his profits.
---
It's not.
---
Eat lead cheater.

they'd need to make 3 star legendary enemies actually drop 3 star weapons though lol

The little gazebo, there is a water fountain along the inner wall.  If you get cannibal, lead belly and a hazmat suit, you can live at Whitespring forever with no outside food or water.
---
Nice home! Love the garage. I have some tips here about placing plants indoors... really useful if you want an indoor greenhouse or a rooftop garden. You can even just decorate your home with things like mutfruit!: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ar31ca/my\_rooftop\_garden\_how\_to\_place\_crops\_indoors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ar31ca/my_rooftop_garden_how_to_place_crops_indoors/)

Concrete gazebo with the statue on top, near the tennis court. There is a drinking fountain that is named "sulphur fountain" and can be used in power armor.
---
Haha, great one! That'd bring a smile to my face every time I got it on a load screen
---
Near Whitesprings Golf course club house (where everyone spams the ghouls). There is a round Gazebo with white columns. Inside (mounted on the stone wall, is a very small water fountain, that dispenses "sulfer water"
---
chill out buddy, just messing around, no need to get so agro :)
---
TIL there’s a monorail in game
---
Except, you couldn't.

If you walked up to vendor with 50k worth of stuff to sell(which sounds like you've been duping if you can do that easily) and they had 10k worth of stuff you wanted, but only 200 base caps with no cap limit, and lets say you have 5k caps for Scenario 1, 10k for Scenario 2, and 25k(the player max) for Scenario 3 the results are:
---
Scenario 1: You sell 200 caps worth of stuff and now have 5.2k caps.  You buy 5.2 caps worth of stuff and the vendor gets back 25% of that putting them at 1.3k caps.  You then sell 1.3k worth of caps putting you at 1.3k caps.  You then buy 1.3k worth of caps and the vendor will get back 325 caps.  You sell 325 caps of stuff and then buy 325 caps worth of stuff, which results in the vendor having 81 caps(rounded down).  You sell and buy again, leaving the vendor with 20 caps, then 5 caps on the next cycle, followed by 1 cap, then none.  At most you just bought 6,932(5,200 + 1,300 + 325 + 81 + 20 + 5 +1) caps worth of stuff.  As things currently are in game, you only could have bought 5,465(5,200 + 200 + 50 + 12 + 3) caps worth of stuff.  Meaning the removal of the vendor's cap limit only increased how much you could buy in this scenario by 1,467 caps(far from you claim of 10k).
---
Scenario 2: You have 10k caps and can buy 10k worth of stuff, congrats; though outside of PA mods and some legendaries that other players sold to the venor prior to you trying to sell to it/buy from it, there's not much you would actually buy(this applies to the first scenario as well, as it's highly unlikely you'd just keep buy useless stuff just because you still had money left, but I'll still properly do this and the next scenario).
---
You sell 200 caps worth of stuff, then buy 10,200 caps worth of stuff.  The vendor would get back 2,250 caps.  You then sell 2,250 caps worth of stuff and buy that much from the vendor.  The vendor will now have, 637 caps.  The next cycle has you buy 637 caps worth of stuff and leaving the vendor with 159 caps.  The next few cycles would leave the vendor at: 39 caps, 9 caps, 2 caps, 0 caps.  Altogether, you bought 13,296 caps worth of stuff.  Without the cap you could have only bought 10,465 caps worth of stuff.  Meaning with the removal of the cap limit, you only bought 2,831 more caps worth of stuff.
---
Scenario 3: You have 25k, enough to buy 1 mutaion serum for it's base cost, which would leave the vendor with 6,450 caps(including it's base 200). Now lets assume real quick that you have Hard Bargain 3, 15 points in Charisma, +5 Charism from using Grape Mentats, +2 Charisma from eating Mothman Egg Omelette and have 5 pieces of Unyielding which grant you and additional +15 Charisma at low life.  You could still only buy 1 outright, since it's still insanely high, and on top of that, even if you bought the rest of your caps in stuff from another Enclave vendor before selling anything, they'd still have that max of 6,450 caps and you wouldn't be able to buy another mutation serum no matter how much you sold, because if it hasn't sunk in yet there's diminishing returns on caps spent to vendor cap pool.
---
So, you spend 25k and then sell 6,450k worth of stuff, the remaining cycles will be: 1,612 caps, 403 caps, 100 caps, 25 caps, 6 caps, 1 cap.  Altogether you could have bought 33,597 caps worth of stuff.  Without the uncapped limit on vendor caps, you could have at most bought 25,265 caps worth of stuff. So without the cap, cap that's only 8,332 caps worth of more stuff, which still isn't 10k.
---
Also across all 3 scenarios, you only would have sold a total of 13,825 caps worth of stuff, which is a mere 27.65% of your supposedly easily obtaine(and likely duped) 50k worth of stuf to sell.
---
TL;DR  Not only are you extremely wrong, you are mathematically deficient.
---
That is weird your guy fell in to one.. Guess it must have been a bug.
---
It doesn't really explicitly state anywhere MODUS wiped out the Enclave, but that's just what I gleamed out of his dialog when you first meet him. He explains he can no longer contact the Kovac or other Enclave sites due to a conflict he had with the members at the Whitesprings site. He also mentions that's why he talks so funny, and is only partially functional.
---
Vault Dwellers: We have emerged from the vault and enjoy the exploration opportunities to be had in this new world. This new world can be harsh at times and a bit difficult to maneuver. Other Inhabitants can also be a bit tough to swallow; However, at the end of the day we are happy to be alive and want to enjoy the good moments to build a better tomorrow.
---
if you read my post you'll see i'm advocating buffing the other guns in line with the handmade
---
The need a separate the Camp and defense budget before that can happen because asshole with 7 turrets will just be able to put 10 down now. 
---
Crowned scorched spawns are much higher than pre-patch. I saw an entire group get wrecked when two gamma gun scorched spawned at the same time. I'm now 1 for 4 in SBQ fights post patch. 
---
I had the game since BETA, and just found it out a few weeks ago, 150+ hours lol
---
I like it.  A raider class of player who's roll is simply to loot and harass vault players sounds great.  Agreed that they'd have to remain outclassed with guns and armor to make the game enjoyable.
---
Uhhh which trailers? 
---
I'm also speaking from sheer access. If Timmy has all the ammo but can't get on because of school, work, vacation or internet outage then people can't get access to the ammo Timmy is holding. But if Timmy, John and Steve all share ammo storage then with 3 people it makes it easier to get access to distribute it if one or two are not able to get onto the game. 
---
I have a level 35 powerful auto handmade  and compared it to a level 55 powerful auto assault rifle. With 30% Commando perks + 15% bloody mess, the handmade does 67 dmg per shot vs 55 for the assault rifle. And that’s a 15 level difference. Crazy 
---
that's a good idea.. hmm, I'll check after work
---
I got BOS combat armor legs from scrapping.
---
(I don't have arms or torso plans, so dunno if they carry over to other limbs)
---
Maybe the guy fell into the other fissure next to prime. He didn’t seem very smart so that’s a possibility 
---
i'm not sure you read my post fully before commenting, I'm talking about the combat/assault rifle family. The ones that can be converted to fully auto. None of the ones you mention fit the description I used :)
---
yeah as someone who used a gauss rifle for exclusively from my time from level 35 until 45 (it was the best legendary i found at the time ) it really does. I gave up on VATS when using it because it just straight up missed most of the time.
---
Sounds like you were playing it like a job, how much money did you make mr. Dooper
---
I'm right next door, other side of the green house, jealous of your build 😊
---
Why does occams razor say he had to do something wrong? To me it seems occams razor actually shows chances are Bethesda made a mistake just like they have with every single patch they've put out. They broke their end game for a week making nukes unable to be launched, they now screwed up the SBQ fight this patch and made her almoat impossible to kill again, they released their customers info on their website, they released an old patch as a new one. Etc.
---
How is it more likely that they didn't make any mistakes with this banwave when they literally have made a mistake every step of the way with this game?
---
That could be another one then. The ones I remember were at a Skull and Chain Icon on the map (I think), and hidden in some grass by a path. 
---
Look at the screenshots on the [Optimum Reshade mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/43). They call it the "washing" effect. Something about the way they have it implemented does horrible, physically painful things to my brain. My brain is pretty broken, in general, though and I get migraines regularly without adding weird stuff like that to it.
---
I'd just be happy if I could repair my Grognak axe above 100% with the Weapon Artisan perk :/
---
Needs moar lamp. 
---
Do you know if that's just for humanoid scorched or does it apply to scorched creatures as well?  I've never been clear on that
---
I will admit that I prefer this sub to the filthycasuals. If I see another screenie of a toon doing thumbs-up in an obscure location, I will scream.
---
Yeah. I used to open everything, but became *WAY* too annoying to constantly swap back and forth. Now, just like you, I walk passed it.

Too late, I'm only missing the Tweaked reciever...
---
I've went through more screws learning 12 of the 13 mods for the radium than I probably have for the LE (30 mods) or the handmade (42 mods).
---
yeah, like i said, each rifle should have pros and cons, not just one that spanks the others easily
---
Hey, I’ll give you a pass since I know reading comprehension and critical thinking aren’t really covered well in school anymore.
---
I accounted for range by waiting until they were directly overhead. Sniper rifle has a much longer range than that. Range fluctuations would also be accounted for in the next point-
---
Can you tell if a glass is half full or 3/4 full? I can. Health in relation to the name is a perfectly viable option when you can get repeated, consistent, very noticeable results. I did. No, I can’t tell you it’s exactly 30%, but I can and did state that it was consistent and noticeable, and I’ve no reason to suspect it WOULDN’T be 30% if the tag says 30% and it *does* do more. 
---
Probably March update, but you know if anyone has so many hours in the game that seem like that were playing the game like a job then they probably were
---
Set it up online, and use workshops.  Team 1 "faction1" vs Team 2 "faction2" at workshop X. Make brackets. Its limited to 4v4, doesn't need to be on the same server. 
---
Same. Especially considering that most important locks or terminals are conveniently level 0. And all level 3 locks only have useless bullshit inside.
---
The game is over. There is no more content. And in fallout that’s the best time to use mods and cheats. Fallout has been a cheating game so I can see for both sides, to a point!
---
While(True){

System.Printout.ln(r/IAmVerySmart)}
---
It baffles me that it's one of the most common weapons that you can find, and yet the plans for it are so rare/difficult to obtain. 
---
Purified water farming and selling to vendors always works.  Farming locations that have lots of super mutants who spawn on the regular works too - Grafton steel is my go to.
---
Personally most of my caps come from hunting - I have three levels of butchers bounty and just roll around the map harvesting, cooking, and selling meat to the vendors.
---
I’ve seen the glowing wire wrapped bottles out in the world in 76, so I know that at least those elements are in the game.
---
*can't disprove or argue against half of what someone said, better dismiss it as incomprehensible ranting*
---
&gt; although god rolls are subjective, that's not godly. the mods are perfect, but the weapon is not a super sledge or a grognak's axe. and nobody would trade you one (let alone sell) because they'd want a god roll themselves.
---
You're an idiot. It is a god roll weapon, you can get this thing well upwards of 3k damage. I've had offers to trade it for 3* bloodied gatling guns and other desirable god roll weapons. I just held off because Beth said they were working on making trading better in game at the time. Haven't seen anything about that from them since ... idk patch 4 or whenever they said it, but meh.
---
Give me my ultracite protest sign!
---
You're not the first. I don't know why it wasn't included into the leveling system. Level 15 you can open lvl 2 one locks/terminals. Level 30 you can open lvl 2 locks/terminals. Level 50 you can open lvl 3 locks/terminals. Or even from levels 10,20,30. It was a strange mechanic choice. If it was even a card that one card could be level 3 so I don't have to swap 3 cards every time
---
 If... he... weighs the same as a duck.. he's made of wood.

---
Post level 50 play is all about getting your builds perfected. I found a good 2☆ legendary melee, so I've mostly leveled up my perk cards and tried various combinations of perk to see what their combined effects are. 
---
Hopefully Beth will add a loadout feature that will allow multiple bulid/play thru styles. I also hope Beth adds weapons and armor past level 50.
---
You're right, I may have skimmed past that part. :)
---
Carry on!
---
I've found some good stuff behind locked containers. Even getting a few caps every so often adds up. I have also found good plans in locked containers myself
---
Locked containers have a ridiculously low spawn chance of plans. If you like to craft stuff.
---
Plans are probably the best loot from containers imo because I love to craft stuff.
---
I looted every chest and box my first 60 lvls. Now I just run past them.
---
tweaked is the one all the vats bros want so good luck getting the final one. I ended up wearing a set of unyielding armour and boosting my stats in some vain hope it would help me have a better learn chance, no idea if it works though as it was right at the end.
---
You can make low level handmades and lever actions but the lowest radium is 40 which i personally believe should automatically put it at the top of the pile. I do understand i'm certainly in the minority in having these views!
---
That anti-armor handmade is better than my best legendary so far, which is a 2-shot mini gun or explosive black powder rifle and I'm level 72.  If you want to trade for either and are on Xbox, holla.  
---
All you can do now is seek out more legendaries, swap in cards that do more dammage and get mutations to boost your stats.  I'd get into power armor asap, the east side of the map would be brutal without it, in my opinion and fusion cores are everywhere.  I have about 40 and aren't even actively looking for a for them.
---
You don't have to make the ammo yourself -- people sell it everywhere. You absolutely can transfer items between two characters on the same account in several ways, but he had two accounts which made it easier.
---
I don't think that Bethesda can track duped items other than seeing what is stacked. And if they are tracking what your character has picked up rather than if you actually duped, a false positive from an obsessive gamer is a bit more likely. Especially since Bethesda seems to have real issues at times with their scripting, and this obviously was done via script.
---
If you don’t cheat you won’t get banned
---
cool condescending statements. anyways zealots doesn't work on scorchbeast sorry.
---
You can kind of do the same thing with a pulse mine. And the EMP it releases can negate most, if not all, PA.
---
Well, you definitely have more tech skills than I have. Thanks again :).
---
7 MILLION POUNDS WAS A SMALL TIME PUSHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
yup, as much as I hate to admit it, the combat rifle is maybe my favourite in-use. Executioner's is also a very powerful effect, on general mobs it works better than furious in my experience. Furious doesn't get the chance to get up to max damage before the mob dies.
---
my furious explosive combat is bae
---
Well, I like that they gave us swappable cards so that we can test things. Now I also agree that I don't like how people swap all the time.
---
There should be a simple cost (and place?) to respec, just like in Grim Dawn. Maybe a brainwasher robot or whatever works. 
---
Remember kids, always reduce time played by 100ish hours to keep credibility when riding coattails of 900+hour guy.
---
1% was last weeks purge (dupes ^&amp; 500k+). This weeks purge (100k+) banned much more. Ask mods how much they deleted, most likely more than twice of all previous ban-waves.      
---
I had over 400 FO76 friends because I ran [Mut-A-Stop](http://i.imgur.com/YkXeptc.jpg) before I got banned. On Monday/Tuesday I recieved a lot of messages of people asking if there was a maintenance or if they were banned. Got a few with every ban wave but never dozens. Also the average players ingame dropped for like 20% in my friendslist. But yeah who cares...      
---
I'm sure Banthesda won't release official numbers this time. And it seems they won't even give reasons - probably only if it was obvious that you duped. Else they had to re-investigate all 'final decisions' they made.
---
Correct, cheaters will always be cheaters. I personally will never understand the mentality of someone who cheats in a video game. Or in any type of game.
---
They should be banned for life, no exceptions.
---
Man, I can farm 3-4 nuke zones and find at least 1 legendary worth using pretty consistently. So either you're doing a shit job of tagging things or you have barely farmed. And just a dozen or so legendaries is nothing. I can net like 60 per nuke.
---
Legendaries should be hard to get. However that should happen by making legendary enemies more rare. Not by dropping legendary toasters 9/10 times. 
---
Did them mothmen say "Hey boy! You got a purdy mouth"
---
I buy them up and file them as 'Forever guns' in my shop.
---
Someone's gonna see them and think "whoa, been looking for something like this" I like to think that some things are just looking for its rightful owner, so I keep them instead of them being lost to a vendor. Besides they make the shop look pretty
---
I use a card switching mod. Greatest thing ever. Encounter a door, hit a key and now I am ready to pick. Terminal inside, a different key and I am hacking away. 
---
Done, back to primary explorer build. What? QUeen nuke? Hit a key for uber-damage build and do some travelling.
---
so with end-game content being legendaries, INT is useless and LCK is essential
---
I hate this logic &gt;:/
---
Yes, I did. 😊
---
wow, those prices make me not want to play. 
---
I watched the Mothman Prophesies the week before this game released to sate my Fallout thirst and was seriously disappointed. It was ok, I guess but wasn't what I was hoping it would be.
---
Spoiler alert: &gt;!There is no Mothman in the movie at all. They do this thing with out of focus car lights that kind of evoke his eyes but that's it.!&lt;
---
I stopped trying to launch the nuke after the 3rd it disconnected me in one play thru.
---
thanks fellow Rifle Bro! I got a bloodied Dragon the other day and tried it out with nerd rage etc and was doing 1k damage with no rifle perks. Ker-azy!
---
does craft-&gt;scrap actually let you learn mods?
---
i would agree with respecs but honestly the current system makes character development pointless really. 
---
I gave up on trying to build and break, couldnt keep up with the mats.
---
I have no clue myself, honestly. Ultracite ammo is so pricey to craft, I don't want to waste it on a Scorched Mongrel or Mirelurk.
---
I imagine it works the same as the Zealot's prefix though, so it SHOULD apply to Scorched Creatures.
---
I’ve got the Mothman statue on top, surrounded by illuminating fires.
---
thanks! 
---
Man, that is intense... I love it.
---
Nah this dropped off with the last patch. 
---
&gt;I have a fully ranked Hard Bargain, what am I supposed to do with my spare 1-star HB? They can't be equipped at the same time.
---
Nothing. But as you level up you continue to have more useful cards. At level 160 or so, Im still far from having everything. I'v spent maybe max 5 levels into special respec. To get pretty much all perks I would want, I might need to get to about level 200.(estimate based on current progress) And I never get all the perks on one character as I wouldn't be able to have the right kind of special set to have them, and at high level it's rather expensive to do any kind of serious respec. Swapping from semi auto rifles to full auto is very trial as they are in same tree, but speccing fully into PA and heavy heapons, from non-heavy non-PA, is too much. Or into melee from scavanger/explorer "sniper".
---
&gt; at least 3 people recently told me they would have bought the Mothman stuff if they had more CAMP build budget as there's is maxed currently
---
Make it four. That statue looks so rad but I just don't have the budget. Thing is, budget limit is there because of performance reasons. I once built a blue tent full of customized coloured light bulbs and even though it looked awesome my fps dropped like crazy every time I got near that thing. That's why lights consume more budget than average and turrets just destroy your budget.
---
We seem to be talking at cross-purposes here. It's a  *shop*, you do not need to convince me of that fact. It's in the name: "ATOMIC **SHOP**". It takes money. It wants to take your money for digital goods. It's entirely upfront about it.
---
Of course shopping is easier once they have your details, *that's how online commerce works.* Do you believe they hired a psychologist to figure that out?
---
What does any of that have to do with the Unstoppables costumes, besides the fact that they're sold in a shop, which is marketed as a shop, where many other items are also sold, *because it's a shop?*
---
That's not even going into the fact that they give you free atoms just for playing the game. I earn atoms faster than I find things to spend them on. If they did hire a psychologist for that, they need to fire them and find a different one. 
---
&gt; My teammates and I used to pass items from the main characters to those mules ...
---
An unverified theory that Bethesda will never and should never confirm. 
---
Just file a ticket if you think it was unwarranted. Reddit posts won’t get anything done.
---
They're under productive compared to a good scavenger.  They could use a tiny buff, at least the nuclear spots could.  Thankfully lead still pops in as scrap and not ore.
---
Me too! 
---
at least name them Lockpick 1, 2 &amp; 3 so they're next to each other when you have to swap them.   
---
As it is, it's a waste of time because there's nothing worth picking a lock for, the odd plan perhaps but that's about it.
---
Bingo, boyo.
---
I didn't know what that was, so I looked it up:  
---

---
It's a flying camel with bat wings and it's terrifying. What the fuck New Jersey?
---
Cool, closeminded egotists don’t make good scientists. 
---
Today I learned. Glad I had it set up before it borked.
---
They often contain plans; that may be the one reason for lockpicking. 
---
Great work! I decided to do a quick and dirty pivot table so it would be a bit easier to look up which locations have a specific plan. Links below.

Ever go to that weird unmarked trailer full of safes that's close to Vault 76?
---
There has to be 10 or 12 safes in there. 
---
My camp was right next to it and I pick them all the time. 
---
The thing is, they are always almost completely empty. Maybe a few rounds or a silver spoon but literally nothing else. 
---
I do keep going at it though hoping to eventually find something- anything. 
---
Wasn't so much the beasts I was wondering about as it was SBQ. 
---
To be fair there is a distinction between putting the CAMP directly behind the golf club house and over to the side by the pond. The pond is good as a fast travel point when whitesprings has been nuked and it does not auto kill the ghouls unless someone brings them over there.
---
I’m on PS4... sorry bud. 
---
I do alright on the east side without PA, I’m a sneaky sniper so my wood armor is good I just need to go slow to get the sneak crits. Only problem is I only have 210 carry weight so I’m constantly spending caps to travel to sell or stash loot. 
---
"General, another C.A.M.P. need your help..."
---
I play every day before and after work, grinding atoms, exp, and legendaries. I also stay logged in all weekend. Played since official release, definitely an unhealthy amount. Don't even have 500 hours. It's pretty obvious these people are playing it like a job
---
Thanks! I have it as my xbox wallpaper lol
---
the irony.
---
well I'm not a fan of going around grinding, I've probably sold/dropped several dozens too I guess, I think I have like 20 stored
---
but I've never seen a legendary combat rifle, hunting rifle, lever rifle, revolver...
---
All hail his dusty wings! 
---
We are on Patch 6 now 
---
I believe the trailer doors are the same in FO76 as they are in FO4.  If they're dented they can't be opened.  If they're not, then you can open them but most likely you will have to pick the lock.  
---
I gotta say, I had no idea about that fountain in Whitespring and I've been playing since the Beta.  Looks like I'm going to make a trip to Whitespring soon to check it out.
---
I use the lever as my sniper....got a tse and I know people think tse suck in vats but this thing is pretty nice as long as your not moving and the damage is better than hunting rifles...alot better
---
Definitely find the brick building or barn building set!  They’re so worth it and look super nice.  Nice job! 
---
No joke.  My most recent encounter with workshop raiders I had better results with my Tesla rifle.
---
I was edging on a like 500+
---
You can kind of move them if there are bodies in your camp. I had just finished my beautiful home and a fuken ghoul fell through the ceiling. I was able to shove the body out the door by repeatedly dropping a piano on him. The body would twitch and get pushed away from the furniture.
---
If you're desperate for supplies why not just ask a workshop owner for some?  They're literally sitting on an infinite source of them and most likely would rather pay you supplies to regain than lose the whole thing.
---
Good.  Glad they caught you cheating.
---
Oh yeah. Scorched humans and Scorchbeasts (and the Queen) are all definitely affected by the effect.
---
You need something to break up the flatness of the wall. porch light, poster, extra roofing, something.
---
otherwise good job.
---
It is a charity and sure. I am happy to affiliate with other Angels of Death.
---
I’ve tried a total of 3 times only once we got her down the other times was a waste of time , I’ve joined countless times as well only 1/3 being successful and only due to a godlike player seemed to have the upperhand 
---
The reason you can't upgrade it like other cards is because you would have level 3 lockpicking/hacking the level you unlocked level 1.  They did it this way to spread it out to where they unlock at various levels.  That being said, it should be a passive card that doesn't apply to the total.
---
I wish we could have flair that identified platform. I'm not finding as many griefers on PC as this sub would have you believe. So I think the experience of each platform can differ greatly.
---
And I would suggest that Minutemen be: Another CAMP needs your help.
---
As my budding Raider character is concerned, Level 3 Lockpicking will come in handy for those pesky locks on Workshops and C.A.M.P.S.
---
I guess I could just blow everything up too. Either way.
---
No problem.

Here is mine, was an interesting exercise. I built big to be spacious, I am at max budget, but have everything I need. I could of gone smaller with less, but I like how it turned out. I have a harvester, 5 water purifiers, PA Station, Kitchen area, sleeping area, Brahmin. Also a nice hidden entrance which only I can open, not even team mates, so even if you invite a random to your team, they can't do squat, so no need to worry about your camp. I still have a bit of room I noticed yesterday when I restarted, so probably will hang some posters, but I like how it turned out.

So many dumb suggestions to non-problems when there are still actual issues with this game. If you can't fast travel everywhere as a low level maybe try, oh I don't know, fucking walking to your destination! You don't need to fast travel everywhere and you're missing game content by doing so.
---
good troll.
---
Do you find the way to fix this ?
---
Search for solutions but no one talk about this issue
---
Try out r/fo76filthycasuals if you get tired of the negativity here. 'Tis a much less silly place :).
---
This is the reason I don't go anymore. Im not sure why they don't change this. She should always be killable.
---
Oh my God what the fuck?
---
bodies are containers, you could carry infinite stuff and still sprint
---
Welcome home!
---
They are pretty easy to farm...
---
Making camps is my endgame as well! They could always just limit the turrets to 6 max per camp and lower the cost accordingly.
---
Also, I wish they would increase the budget and add a lot more building options in, rather than have stuff trickle in through the Arom shop. 
---
We should be able to do something like this!

My "whaaaat?!" moment was the Nuka Cola vendor in Whitesprings
---
Agreed, make those people and their bases immune to damage until they decided to take one of MY workshops. ;)
---
Wherre? D:
---
They don't, the terminals only interact with items that receive direct wired power, and even then, only select items.
---
It might be tedious but they actually have some good loot sometimes 
---
...Gilded?
---
I feel like this mechanic is part of the RPG genre. You're supposed to grind and farm. Has no one played a Final Fantasy game? This isn't a Doom or Quake-like FPS (showing my age) where you are just handed the best weapons and armor because you know where they spawn. 
---
If I see a wanted plaeyer in a low level area, chances are they want to die.
---
I go in and ask, take them out, and guard their stuff.
---
I get thanked every time.  Been doing it since BETA.
---
Seriously?  WTF.  I have been walking around with these friggin’ diseases when I was too lazy to farm ingredients or too cheap to buy a cure and I could have just drank the fountain water?  
---
Got it.  So confirmed moron.  You do you man.  I hope whatever causes you spite gets alleviated and you find happiness.
---
OMG thanks for the info bro!
---
You came in at a good time, it's gonna get way better soon. Content update in March, supposedly quite a large one. All of the negativity comes from people who got bored. Once you finish the story, the game basically turns into Fallout 4 once all the quests are done. All that is left to do is build up your camp and grind for legendaries. That will change soon
---
weird in my hazmat suit i take less than 1 rads per second. 
---
I ran watoga EMS last night about 15 times and got no legendary enemy spawns.  civic center twice, same thing.    In comparison I would get a legendary most times before.  I feel they stealth-nerfed the set popular legendary spots.  I'll need many more runs for that to be conclusive though.
---
Push the build zone back out of turret range. I like camps back there that I can repair, scrap, and store in. I usually build one, with turrets down the hill protecting the stairs from any horde that gets trained over there. The turrets can't reach the building from there.
---
Or just put bulletproof glass in the windows.
---
Very nice and all, but it might be even better if you actually upload the image.
---
Cant you do this with a mine or that perk that drops a bomb when you die?
---
&gt;Near Whitesprings Golf course club house (where everyone spams the ghouls). There is a round Gazebo with white columns by the tennis courts. Inside (mounted on the stone wall) is a very small water fountain, that dispenses "sulfer water"
---
Yay
---
YES!! now that is what i envision as a vault dweller's house!!! We are not ghouls or raiders, we are civilized!!!
---
Is it worth spending another 700 ammo to kill her and get ass tier loot?
---
It's not even worth killing her with an optimized build because of how broken the loot tables are.
---
"Oh? You're gonna go and expend 1k ultracite ammo to kill the SBQ and her legion of scorched goonies?
---
After you kill her, we'll take personal care with your level 25 hunting rifle that you just worked so hard to get, as a personal thanks from Bethesda Game Softworks for shilling out 60 dollars for our game that doesn't even work. Just because you keep playing the game."
---
-From,
---
Some dickweed at Bethesda, who personally hands out every drop to players when they kill legendary enemies and bosses.
---
On console you can make additional xbox/psn accounts that can use the 1 copy of the game the console owns, then you just log on as an alt while you have a friend hold your stuff to trade to them, trade flux /clothing/whatever to them and have them fast travel and sell all the stuff to all of the vendors. Switch to the next alt, risen repeat, boom 5k caps a day. 
---
The limitation is dumb they should get rid of it or lower it or do something else it there to just artificially lengthen game play and there are ways around it that would break trading in general for them to fix. EVEN IF IT WAS PER ACCOUNT, i could just make additional alt accounts with a single character. 
---
I had a chain of 3 vengeful mothmans in the mire within a minute of each other. It was a little painful when they spammed the directed sonic attack. But the ballistic fiber from them was well worth it. I'm going to miss them when this Mothman week ends.
---
Yeah, anti armor knife w/ swing speed, as well as Incisor and sneaking (3.5x dmg), I can drop someone who hasn't initiated PVP in like 15 or so hits. It only happened once, I'm not normally an asshole. We were both doing an event and I died, and he took my loot bag. 3 hrs of loot, my own goddamn fault for not depositing it. I did feel bad after.
---
I use to use both, now I just ignore them.
---
I stopped taking over workshops because of this
---
I should have been more specific ... mod plans. I've only found mods (at the bunker vendor), but never any plans for mods anywhere. I see on a comment here that at least one person found plans for mods from the SBQ. lucky SOB!
---
TO THE PIES!!
---
Now while the duplicate exploit stilling being present in Fallout 76 is unacceptable in my book, this by no means excuses blatant cheating. Regardless of how poor the drop rate of legendary items is/was.
---
I just wanted to launch a nuke because it was a while ago i did. And thought like ok lets try the SBQ event. This was the third time. The first time was a succes, because all were high level players.  The second i had the same problem with now.  Lower level players enter the area and she stops taking any damage, no matter what. 
---
Terminal hacking seems to always get  the short end of the stick. It seems more than half the time  something is locked,  it's more likely you'll be able to pick a lock to access  it, whereas something being completely exclusive to a terminal is pretty damn rare.   It's especially funny when you can hack a  terminal to unlock a safe, but you can just unlock the safe with  lockpicking as someone's hacking it.
---
My friend and I have a system where he hacks any terminals, and I  open all the locks.  Needless to say, I flex my skill a  lot more than he does.
---
You get labelled a cheater when you cheat.  
---
You get labelled a griefer when you grief (Hint, your lvl300 slapping that lvl5 to death is not PvP, it is griefing.)
---
That a cheater and griefer can't grasp simple etiquette, polite consideration of others, or even the concept of not being selfish is completely unsurprising.
---
Why can we not use the Super Mutant ~~Suicider Bomb~~ Propane Tank Helmet?!
---
Better idea, each vendor's cap pool gets added to the entire faction pool, so 7 responder bots makes a 1400 cap responder pool, 5 raider bots makes a 1000 cap raider pool, same with whitesprings, all of those vendors including the station vendor should add to a pool cap.
---
Economy 'balance'? I'm sorry but you've mistaken that word for meaning bottlenecked.  I doubt ANYONE could clear 30k from a server each day just between those three factions, not including watoga, BoS, Free States, and Enclave, all of which would actually sit at 200 caps in their pools now that I think about it.
---
Increase the cap limit to 50k, and watch the fallout economy erupt with people trading all of their stuff for caps they'll have nothing left to spend them on in a year after they've bought every plan and enough bulk junk, all that'll be left is weapons, armor, and ammo, at that point they'll need to go the new content route and start giving us some radiant pve quests and search quests to do.
---
The reality is this game isn't a play forever mmo, it has a hard stop on its progress, there's no real skill training or merchanting reasons beyond to play more of a fallout experience.  Once you kill the Sbq and acquire your dream weapons and armor, and maximize your build what is there really left to do but help others get to that same place?  Veteran players are gonna either be raider kings/queens or responder kings/queens or rp'ers or pure explorers.  Not much to do at the end.
---
How I made my fortune 
---
yes.....very much so.
---
a pile of bodies...and then firing a mini nuke at them
---
Looks great, awesome job, if you’ve got camp budget to spare and you fancy an upstairs view over the water you could swap your upstairs wall on the left of the build for a doorway and have it lead out onto a balcony using the half floor bits overlooking the water I guess, love building in the forest there’s some lovely views
---
 put your turret on the roof so rats don't eat it
---
all these calculations and im sittin here with a melee build with almost 10k DPS. bloodied swing speed deathclaw gauntlet, unyielding armor, most melee perks, nerd rage, tenderizer, bloody mess, whiskey, fury.
---
they are part of the responder and the free states quest lines
---
YES, that would be amazing!
---
Doesn't let me for some reason, grayed, changed flair to other. Image link in post.
---
Got Shielded Marine from Census Violence.
---
They have a ridiculously low chance, but when they do  drop plans, it's  VERY good  I find.
---
I managed to find a plan for a gauss rifle  from a safe, and that plan is not very  cheap at a Watoga vendor.
---
Yes, but wouldn't look more hysterical with a proper mini-nuke in your hands? 
---
It also said a couple of days for the atoms. That took two months. 
---
So obviously their time frame is a little shewed. 
---
you can get them from watgoa with pharma farmer perk
---
I derive a immense amount of satisfaction from the fact that I relentlessly mocked the shit out of that pike if garbage back when I was a teenager, and didn’t fall into the weird overhype.
---
Hell, I would buy that in the Atom Shop.
---
Why thank you kind sir! It is mighty nice to find a fellow mad man in the wastes.
---
Indeed, but like the Super Mutants it would immediately give away your strategy. 
---
Yeah, that's the bed in question! Interesting. I'd like to think our differing experiences might be on account of hidden factors like the weather, but it's probably easier to chalk it up as another bug!
---
You'd probably be the most senior dev in Bethesda. 
---
Well, this *is* a valid point
---
No, it should absolutely stay the same unless they balance stuff like Gutsys and Stun-locking enemies like Yao Guai or Assaultrons.
---
Artillery and wall breaching exist you’re never safe completely.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel:This game is a treasure of technology and must be preserved
---
Nice! Tagging for future reference.
---
Well I figured it out. It is a mutation. Last night before going into a nuke zone I took a radx, which temporarily muted mutations and sure enough the gauss rifle damage was back to normal. It seems either the mutation or the class act perk card is bugged.
---
Best lamp ever
---
So that's why we can't have objects in our c.a.m.p right? I'm so sad to know this....
---
wow, throw that down next to a fissure site and you would have a natural defense system as well.  Whoever walks up would have to deal with the Scortchbeast spawn from the fissure while you sit snug and protected.  Too bad you couldn't put up a window or video monitoring to watch all the fun.
---
I wouldn't know, I keep buying plans, even ones I don't necessarily need. Never get above 1500 caps
---
I spent a lot of time and effort to upgrade my lock picking under the guise that I'd find some good loot like it was with FO4.  But, came to find that most safes  / level 3 locks contain mostly useless garbage so I don't even bother anymore.  I've had more luck with the treasure maps finding legendary items (not often but more so than in level 3 locks) so I don't even bother with any locks / terminals now.
---
What kind of build are you using?? I haven't heard of that kind of that kind of damage resistance on a player PA-less.
---
gatling gun-heavy gunner
---
knuckles-unarmed
---
Any of the trailers so long as the back door isn't bent.
---
That's really cool and yeah I was thinking about doing the block in front of the doorway too
---
Thats terrible logic rofl. 
---
&gt;decreased time SBQ is on ground to counter now for the lower amount of sonic attacks
---
probably :P
---
Okay so I get that your concerned about Bethesda's methods - but this guy is most certainly a duper and Bethesda weren't wrong to ban him.
---
I'll leave you with this.
---
He made a huge post on how to play the game.  He'd already been banned at that point **but did not say one word about his ban**.
---
*Then* he posts the next day or 2 after that he'd ***just been banned*** and pointed to his previous post to prove he was a legit player.
---
It's fair to call out Bethesda for what they do wrong - it's not fair to Bethesda to point to this guy as proof of their misdeeds.
---
Playing 12ish hours a day, mostly whitepsrings farming, with most breaks being for SBQ fights.
---
With martial artist, speedy receiver, and faster firing affix it shoots about between 3 and 4 rounds per second.
---
A single SBQ fight could break 1000 rounds if too many unhelpful people came.
---
Well you wanted less sonic attacks what did you think they were gonna change to counter it.... in all seriousness i wonder if they know they can just nerf a npc with out buffing it too
---
Kind of related. I run a stealth build with full Weightless Marine armor. Had Chameleon on for a while, but god damn man....that "invis" graphic on and off is fucking horrible. And to top it off, I'm getting the same, *if not better*, sneak consistency without it. Modding the Weightless to Ultra-Light also makes a huge difference.
---
I have no proof other than observation (could be a form of confirmation bias was well), but it seems armor with a mod/upgrade applied grants higher chances of learning a mod upon scrapping. Armor found in the wild usually comes with a mod, even if a shitty low level mod. Which could lead to why it seems “natural” drops net more learned mods. Crafted weapons drop mods and I assume the mechanic is exactly the same.
---
Often the rewards are not enough to warrant changing perks
---
I keep seeing people post this but I haven't seen a single one since I completed that quest. Got any tips other than waiting for that one heart event to appear?
---
[Just don't extend it as far as my Tavern on the Green](https://i.imgur.com/N6q9fDK.png)
---
I feel like the raider role is missing and this would be that class of person.  So let them play what they are but limit what they can collect since they are the scum of the wasteland.
---
I think Bethesda should take ownership that they have major flaws in their game and that banning players for exploiting the flaws is really partially their fault for allowing it to be exploited in the first place.  I am not banned nor a douper but I think everyone deserves a 2nd chance to play and this would be a great role for them to play while seeking redemption.
---
Then again, I do like harsh punishment for the guilty so I see your viewpoint as well.
---
I haven't tried the adrenal/bloodied/NR combo yet. I just have an AA dragon, and get 2000 damage per shot with a crit, plus the 50%, and 36% armor reductions.
---
I really hope to run across one with the 50% vats crit secondary some day.
---
All of the trash and stuff that appears on the ground, heck some times corpses appear in different locations when i play with my kid and we have two tv's for consoles side by side. 
---
truck trailers.
---
I basically do the vendor run every single day since I started playing, plus lately I started to produce lots of bulks and chems that I sell to vendors, but I always have more than 1400 caps of goods. So I reduced bulking and producing chems, and im focusing on ammos, serums, fluxes... I have to say I'm good with this now, lots of players are in desperate need of ammos. I sell, I make gifts, I trade with plans. And I like it :)
---
I'm also not into exploit, so I prefer working hard for collecting caps. I managed to get twice to max caps 25k. Currently level 87. But I spent a lot on serum recipes and other plans.
---
Are you Uncle Rico kicking a football over them there mountains?
---
 Omg, thats even worse than PC without this mod... sorry
---
They should, considering how much people are bent on farming that one location, even to the point how people are upset for someone having a turret base nearby to interfere with their farming.
---
It's supposed to be a big open world game. Not WS and prime fissure farming simulator.
---
&gt; whaaaat?!
---
where is this vendor?
---
How it should be.
---
Calculations don't really matter much if you're cheesing the fight outside of the nuke zone. In that case just run bloodied melee at 20% health in unyielding armor with a deathclaw gauntlet like everyone else.
---
Yeah, I just found out yesterday that I actually had an explosive black powder rifle, not just a anti-scorch one because didn't realize I could click on it and see the additional effects.Was mighty happy.
---
I agree but also I think the in-game explanation for the sloths is they’re descended from ‘pet’ sloths kept by the sons of one of the mining company CEOs. 
---
I carried Kurt Cobain's Microphone as my main shotgun in Fo4.
---
I see interest in 3 star non explosive. Swing speed melee, reduced weight heavies, faster fire rate anything. Those seem to be popular. Bloodied/AA seems hot right now too. 
---
exactly.
---
Definitely, I love the fact, I can lock myself in without anyone being able to get in, I just wanted to see if it were possible. Also you can layer the walls with walls, I didn't have much budget left, else I could of totally put walls against the concrete. I did it at the entrance and even included a door to show me where the entrance once, very cool.
---
I believe your camp budget increases with your level to a certain upper limit so it may be worth you periodically moving it. It's also a good idea to put it near farming points appropriate to your level to get the greatest amount of loot. 
---
This is dope.
---
My only question is if someone would go as far to drop a nuke on you, and what effects it would have.
---
Yes very good point. I was thinking we need those external cameras like in FO4, but you right, that would be cool. We need those cameras like in GTA where you can monitor your surroundings ..
---
So I went back to Charlie and found no holotape? I haven’t passed the laser grid though. Is that past it?
---
Being well-intentioned.
---
I remember hearing from someone that damage from nukes are transmitted through the wall. The walls may survive but all your stuff gets broken.
---
You would not believe how many explosive weapons I see at vendors because people don’t read all the stars
---
I moved mine around a lot of times until I found a place I like in the bottom of the map but it does cost me many caps to fast travel
---
Capn’ Muricuh build, make it so.
---
I thought that was only for the SB Queen?
---
Time will tell I guess, but you right as well as they could remove the functionality in the next patch.
---
And you can put 'em in your stash.  I have my trusty Excavator, my X-01 "Blackbird", my Nuka-Cola T-51b, T-60 in BoS colors, and my Ultracite.
---
Hello...my name is Stomper...and I'm a Power Armor-holic...
---
solo my best run is around 25mins
---
Honestly nah got bored after title. And your use of caps lock is impressive.
---
ushanka/bare eyes/veil of secrets best hat setup
---
It wasn't contested by anyone?
---
gonna do that when i am able to build something that keeps me from falling off the balcony x3
---
In case anyone can't find the Whitespring fountain, you're not looking for a decorative garden-like water fountain. It's a regular drinking fountain like you'd find in a building. If you walk into the gazebo as you're coming from the main building, follow the left wall. If your back is to the tennis courts, it's on the right side wall under the gazebo.  Turn on  your lamp as it's hard to see.  It took me forever to find it as I kept looking at the thing in the middle where I expected a fountain to me.
---
Don't try to collect and save the water. It just stores it as regular dirty water with no disease cure effect.
---
Hardly, not an economist but I thought increasing currency amount without devaluing it actually lead to more prosperity?
---
So like people can afford bulk junk to mass craft then scrap guns for mods and buy ammo and plans to do more stuff with against hopefully new enemies in the future and more quests that aren't lazy writing bullshit like 'make noise to draw out a Wendigo', k I'll fire my gun, oh no I has to play an instrument and a jukebox and a radio because shooting my gun isn't good enough I guess.
---
Depends on the character mindset I have that day.
---
Log on.
---
What do I need? Scrap? Probably pick lockpick for that because
---
Of the tool boxes. Then I just leave terminals alone until the next play session when I reevaluate how to best survive that day.
---
I have scrapped thousands of armor pieces, only two more combat armor mods to learn, shadowed legs and BOS legs. I learn a new mod it seems around every 200-300 scraps
---
This comment is just like the ones i get in game. Its closer to harassment/bullying than anything we do at a workshop. 
---
You guys are toxic. Chill out. Losing a few caps or junk aint no thang.
---
That is super bizarre.  
---
Thanks. 
---
looks like the pyramid of Meereen in game of thrones...awesome
---
I have a mod to switch decks for me
---
Do you have adrenal reaction, if so there is a bug/ maybe nerf with it.
---
Body Mechanics in this game are already so screwy I'm perfectly fine with that feature not being implemented. Last thing we need are more bugs.
---
I have chosen a spot and left it there.
---
Go for a resource node you enjoy (Junk Piles are great, imo).  Or a location that puts you central to key fast travel locations.
---
I don't use mine as a utility to fight with.  I use it as a base of operations to craft/scrap at the end of a day or the end of a trip.
---
The reward is not worth the effort. I mostly ignore safes and picked containers, doors most of the time.
---
I hope they don't patch this because you're posting this! 
---
Would be an interesting test. Someone just mentioned the effects would go thru the wall. Maybe select a boring area that will never get nuked or a waste of time or set it up in fissure prime to test the affects.
---
...how???
---
There’s a lot of things I found out much later. I think we all did.
---
I keep mine on a lead deposit that's a stones throw away from my three favorite farming grounds. Or at least I did until I joined a player clan that's asked me to move it three times already... I'm going back to my old site this weekend wether they like it or not though. It'll take hours to get it how I want it though.
---
Not FO4, but half this sub is the Scorched, I swear.
---
Which base weapon would you suggest?  I've had poor results with the Gauss (moving targets, aarrgh), reasonble results with a Gatling Plasma of all things, and have a new Prime .50 machine gun ready to be blooded...
---
I've killed him a few times with just melee. Last time he escaped before I could get the land final blow and I was so frustrated when he didn't come back. I need those ballistic weave wings
---
I don’t think Deep Pocketed for Combat Armor Limbs is available at any vendor currently either. It used to be. 
---
FYI whatever is next in line to be OP is probably going to get triple nuke nerfed like TSE.
---
My bet is on melee.  If they do it, that's my last viable build, so I'm out.  0 of 2 playable characters isn't fun.
---
I know it's an unpopular thought, but maybe, just maybe it's not intended to a) use characters as mules and b) to horde hundreds of thousands of whatever items you can (and can't) find in the world.
---
Personally i can't think of any moment in my roughly 300 hours of gameplay where it thought a mule would come in handy. Too much effort for far too less use.
---
The only way I know how to swap between characters under the same account it if you anchor to a player on the same server or have a friend hold your stuff. Is there a different way? 
---
No.  I still kill them in the same number of hits.  1-2 hits with my sneak attack rifle.
---
No, that would require them to set up programming to see what legendaries were already in the server, and then apply some sort of bias in the loot tables, all on the fly. Considering they let flare guns and drills remain as legendary drops for as long as they did, it seems pretty unlikely that they put very much effort into the loot drop function of the game. Plus, if they could figure out how to modify loot drops based the presence of legendaries in an active server, the could have easily fixed the whole duping issue right then and there.
---
Lvl 2-40 I dragged mine around as a mobile crafting/ scrapping station. 
---
At 40+ I started having more free caps to fast travel, so I built a stationary base in the central map that makes it easier to travel anywhere. It's a max budget 4 story built around specific geographic features, so it's entirely immobile.
---
Not sure, I found mine at Alpha. It was in the same vault tec briefcase that the original holotape was in.
---
Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits.
---
Sell your stuff there for MORE caps than the greedy vendor bots give you.
---
You can literally make thousands of caps in a single day selling stuff to other players.
---
One spot. You can fast travel to it for free so mine is pretty much central map to minimise fast travel costs. 
---
But the panini hair is all you need. 
---
I really dig the light boxes!
---
Wow that sucks. Would it have bothered him to wait 20 seconds.
---
Only if you can prime it so it starts beeping as you run at them
---
Radsponge and Ghoulish are amazing in a team.
---
That is how I see the Brotherhood working.
---
put your turret in the scrap pile cause it's pointless
---
(fixed for ya!)
---
About 400 hours here, but I literally sit at home and help take care of my grandmother all day. Fallout was there to entertain me while she's watching reruns of murder shows and playing sudoku on her tablet. 
---
Hopefully they did this eventually. Fighting the queen outside of the nuke zone is obviously not how they intended the fight to be. 
---
They should let hazmat suits go over armor so you can run your bloodied deathclaw build inside of the nuke zone. It would actually be challenging if you had to mange your rad levels during the fight.
---
&gt; I don't think that Bethesda can track duped items other than seeing what is stacked.
---
This is absolutely true, yet people want to say otherwise. BGS is trying to determine dupers by inference rather than observation
---
Can someone explain to me whats the deal with that campfire thing?
---
Another whining brat with more time than sense. Shrug.
---
Naw leave each vendor with their own inventory to give incentive to travel to them to check out their unique stuff.
---
I know people were blocking the WSs, but couldnt you just break whatever they placed? If not.. Why camt we break the things?!
---
Early game I set up by the black powder museum. I would screw around struggling to kill that Yao Gai.
---
Just build it by the white spring like everybody else. You can quickly get to the golf course even when it’s nuked. It’s also a good middle ground for fast traveling to Ash Heap/ Watoga.
---
Yes. It’s not worth the bother of switching  the perk cards. I might feel differently if they contained something worthwhile.
---
You can, but it doesn't do much.
---
And it increases the lag / possibility for crashes.
---
It does yes. And the lower level weapons will still teach you mods but they cost fewer materials to craft, so it’s the cheapest way to craft to learn mods. 
---
&gt; poor drop rates?
---
It's a known bug that legendary creatures are often not dropping legendary items. At all. Not trying to defend the dupers, but lets be honest about the game.
---
No I never did
---
yeah would really be challenging pressins one of my hotkeys for radaway diluted.
---
1) Your play time does not make me feel bad for you or give you some sort of increased weight to your argument. We all spent money buying the game. Your 800 hours means nothing more than a players 5 hours to Bethesda.
---
2) The use of mule characters is obviously a loophole in the intensions of Bethesda for the game. If they wanted us to have infinite storage we would have it. The fact your mule is just carrying items for another character doesn't change a thing.
---
3) You still had over 100,000 items in a 30 day period.
---
4) Stop blaming other people for your issues. You chose to do these things and your choices got you banned. It is your fault. Accept that and move on.
---
One spot. Find a nice quiet place with water and build there. You'll want the water for the large water purifier. It can be quite painful to move your camp sometimes because it'll give you false positives on placement of your structure. 
---
If I *really* wanted inside, I would just have a teammate stand next to the door, fast travel to them from a distant corner of the map, and then run inside before the doors/walls render.
---
:D
---
Serum recipes are at the enclave bunker. 
---
Ultracite mods drop from regular SB
---
Ultracite PA plans are given for free from the brotherhood. 
---
All three star legendaries have the same drop chances
---
Unless you want prime receivers (which are garbage and shouldn’t be used on any gun) 
---
I wouldn’t ever go after the queen. 
---
Anyone truly interesting is a little bit mad.
---
[](/joy)
---
Aka go to a safe space cuz you cant handle the actual real criticism. 
---
&gt;  Even though they're named SMG, if you put a full stock on them they're considered rifles in-game as far as perks go.
---
Woah, really? Does that mean any mod named "stock" rather than "grip"? 
---
And does that make Perfect Storm a viable weapon for rifleman builds?
---
but Main Street still all cracked and broken! 
---
I really wish they'd address this issue faster.  It's been a hindrance to my Gear progression, not being able to find key mod plans that used to be available at vendors with a tiny bit of effort.  Been over a month now, and they just added it to the "We are looking into it!" list prior to the last patch.
---
I had very much hoped it would be addressed in Patch 6, and was disappointed to see it not there.
---
I do find that I am now taking more damage but dealing the same. Nothing changed for my setup/perks. Not sure.
---
That's literally the one body that doesn't go away.
---
Well the majority of players are on console or using controllers.
---
So your argument is that you play on easy mode?
---
I reminds me of SWTOR.  Those guys would take months to put out a roadmap.  We waited so long we didn't care when it finally came out.  
---
for the longest time (150+ hours), I would move my CAMP around daily, or a few times a day while traveling. It would have turrets mounted all over it, to help me with bigger enemy battles, and help me save ammo/meds, weapon/armor degradation, plus have mobile crafting available.
---
I found some ideas for floating or 1 single foundation builds that really helped move it to any terrain. Put down a foundation, set of metal stairs, then build starting from the top of the steps. Only 1 foundation to set (goes with any terrain), building floats (no enemy melee attacks hit it), and you have a safe place to sit if need be (they don't come up stairs if placed right).
---
As I got more into end-game stuff and trading more, I have more of a permanent spot now next to Whitespring Station. 
---
Case in point.
---
You don't up wanted?  Cos if not I've got a new target - and it's gonna b fun.
---
I had no idea about the glitch and played tons of Fallout 4 while looking at the reddit boards for both FO4 and general Fallout practically every day for two years. I assume it wasn't an issue players were complaining about either so there is actually a chance Bethesda was unaware of it.
---
Very nice, built something similar by the mansions on the right side of the dry lake bed near Whitesprings. Brick house with an attached garage, wrap around porch and a rooftop bar with access from the second floor bedroom. Right on the road so it looks like it should "be there" and always shocks people when I bring them to my CAMP for the first time. Probably spent well over 10 hours or more fine tuning it and countless more hours farming workshops for plans.
---
Saaaaame, man! I take care of the elderly, and have brought it into work a few times. Though that's mainly because I needed to update my trade page. It's cool you help her, not many people want to be available like that all of the time. Even in healthcare, ha
---
Why are they an asshole? I don't see why someone needs 7 turrets but why care?
---
Really?  Cause I remember them mentioning something in the vidoc in the fall that there were giant sloths in West Virginia in prehistoric times.  But if their explanation is that they're just mutated pet sloths, that's kinda...weak?  I guess deathclaws being mutated chameleons isn't great either, but I'm willing to compromise.
---
Lol I’ve also left everyone in that little town, I think covenant, out front in their undies for being liars lol
---
Nope. But both those ways means it's 100% easy and in fact trivial to transfer between characters on the same account. But the 900 hours dude had two accounts anyway. 
---
yeah, if i wait for VATS to "settle" the accuracy is fine
---
The whole east coast has all sorts of strange creatures and cryptids.  Maybe because the land is so old.  Old as balls.
---
Wear 5/5 unyielding. Get your luck above 28 @ low health. 
---
You will get a pie in a minute. I farm pies as quest rewards. You can server hop the same machine. Easy to get 25 pies in an hour....
---
If we got him in game I'd have to I'd have to re configure my character to look like Tom DeLonge.  Skipping around the wasteland in search of Bigfeets singing All the Small things to myself.
---
Need single player 
---
They are at knifes edge up by prickets fort.
---
Can only shoot them, can't disarm &amp; can't get caps after explosion but I do have an interesting photo of one of the open lunch boxes..
---
still haven't seen a Colonel Gutsy, have you?
---
**FYI they've been stealth nerfing legendaries and legendary drop rates.**
---
How do I know this?
---
Go to a Whitesprings Nuke zone and hit the golf house.  There used to be 20-30 ghouls POURING out of that place.  You'd pretty much be guaranteed at least one 3 star, a couple of 2 stars, and a ton of 1 stars in that group.
---
NOW go there.  You'll get about 10 ghouls.  You'll be lucky to get one 2 star legendary.
---
The fun police don't like your farming methods.  F you for enjoying them :)
---
p.s.  If you can point me to ANY communication from the Bethesda team about "reducing the number of golf club ghouls or the number of legendaries" I will stand corrected :)
---
I used to unlock everything out of habit, but honestly why would I waste the picks when 90% of the containers I unlock are already empty?
---
Thanks, documents and submitted
---
I really miss the executions from Fallout 4. They would've been hilarious in multiplayer.
---
The Yao Guai one is great! Nothing quite like being pushed to the floor and having your throat ripped out. Exquisite.
---
&gt;cheaters will always be cheaters
---
This is false. I used to cheat as a kid in old call of duty game, many, many years ago. Never did it again in any other game. 
---
Disease cures cannot be sold to vendors, antibiotics can be.
---
I created an alternative. I made stares with a half wall at the top. You stand on the stairs and the turrets can only shoot down. So essentially one at a time mobs form a line to walk up to death. Also keeps all loot in on spot. 
---
Second floor of Whitesprings.  It is easiest to go in back entrance by schoolbus/ghoul parking lot and take the stairs to the left up.  follow the green hallway to a pink/red area on the right side.  Vendor is Red and at a bar with unique nuka colas all around (grape, orange, dark, wild, &amp; quantum).
---
I never knew the hate for WS Bases ended?
---
I’ve never thought of this when I was over-encumbered 
---
Something to add, I've seen and purchased Heavy combat arms and legs at Harper's ferry. I'm petty sure they aren't guaranteed in stock and it's likely a random chance it will show up like how all plans used to be before they patched them.
---
no my argument is that even with a controller its on easy mode pressing left on the dpad and A/X isn't really what u would call hard now is it? and i do play on xbox and pc. 
---
Thanks mate
---
I bad that problem too :/ lvl 46 now so it's better 
---
I have always wondered why the Hacker and Picklock cards don't upgrade
---
1 star = easy
---
2 Star = medium 
---
3 Star = expert
---
Why have three cards when they can be upgraded when we get them. Seems counter-intuitive to the other upgradeable cards - like Armorsmith and Gunsmith
---
When did people's speculation/excuse that dropping items and picking it back up counts towards the 100,000 rare items become an accepted fact rather than just speculation/excuse?
---
By far my favorite camp I’ve seen so far
---
All hail Mothman the wise and terrible!
---
Wow, it's really not as if people can ever change.
---
I got bored of it at about 110 hours. They are adding content every week now. But I think I will wait until more stuff is out before playing again.
---
That boat sailed a while ago. This CAMP glitch has been around for over a month. The patch will come, the exploit will be fixed. All they would have to do is make campfires only allowed on dirt. Problem solved.
---
Bugs are fun though lol jk 
---
All I do is sell weapons, aid items and unjunked items to vendors. (Plates and stuff that I haven’t scrapped yet, so they’re sellable). Cap stashes dotted around the map help out a little too.
---
Have just over 3000 caps myself and it took me a couple of weeks to make it. Only travel to 2 or 3 vendors a day as well, not all of them. I rarely buy anything with caps at all, unless it’s much needed ammo that I’m too lazy to craft or a plan from a vendor 
---
I learned it via scrapping. So far only Marine limbs have their deep pocketed plans sold. 
---
Hmmm. That'd be nice. Lakeside cabin, solar panels and battery power personal grid, a roaring fireplace, and Skyrim. 
---
lol, same here.. they have those drawing sin them
---
Yeah, the only CAMP that is not an exploit - like using the 'rug trick' to clip stuff inside the collision of the foundations, the 'campfire trick' to stack foundations or building inside the collisions of world static objects - and is truly griefing proof is the one where you pop stuff only when you are going to use it and store it immediately after.
---
Apart from crops you can do that with everything else including water purifiers. If the latter would store above single digits might be worth the 'risk' of leaving them out alas they do not so is kind of pointless.
---
15 times more than the 10 cap bounty guy. 
---
My last (and only) SBQ was when I was lvl 49, and I had just picked up that perk.  I only had my .50 cal hunting rifle, so I knew I wasn't hurting the queen all that much.  BUT if I kept killing the mobs, not only was my dmg going up, but I was also building up crits, which actually did do at least a noticeable scratch against her.
---
God dammit the 'no' emote there makes it
---
Honestly I'm kind of thinking they won't be doing that, weapons would get way too OP otherwise. 
---
check your "defenses" tab. should be some short walls in there you could use as railing, if I remember rightly.
---
I'm disabled and at around 700h not banned. Weird. 🤷
---
"I do it but I'm different" Okay lmao 
---
yeah, a quad one would be awesome!
---
I tell you if they ever let me have a power armor display in my CAMP I guaran-fucking-tee I will be spending every single atom I've earned on all those funky skins. But until then having a bunch of undifferentiated unnamed power armor chassis in my stash that only look cool if I take them out to play with them doesn't really appeal to me, personally.
---
These are rookie numbers. I had a guy with a 1250 bounty once. And be being a bounty hunter. I even said fuck that and ignored it 
---
LOL....
---
But you're arguing that melee requires no skill. He'll it's so easy you don't even need to bother crunching numbers.
---
You play on easy mode.
---
Do you feel better now that you’ve attacked me some more? 
---
Poor little fella.
---
15 stray bullets for the 150 guy 
---
Ok. Sorry if i misunderstood.
---
I see your point. "IF" such an action can result in a ban; Beth does have an obligation to warn people (and 3rd party forums dont count), or provide a reliable way to differentiate and resolve "innocent" offenses.
---
This is true. However, it does not completely absolve the "innocent" player of all responsibility. 
---
Caveat Emptor, buyer beware, "if its too good to be true..." all still apply. Maybe Beth needs a more up front way to inform people about potential problems, filing report tickets, etc.
---
That way; unwitting players could find something and file a ticket saying basicly: "hey, i found this. If its ok, id like to keep it. If not, im informing you so you can remove it from play."
---
Those who took it on themselves to "dispose of suspicious items", even though it was well intended, kinda walked into a minefield.
---
I attached a Mothman kind of on accident one day, whacked him when I was trying to see if animal friend worked. Since then Vengeful Mothmen keep attacking the crap out of me. 
---
I was hiding on a car from two bears in F4 once. Just out of range of their attacks, I thought, until I heard a small explosion from the car engine. The second one crippled my leg in that instant too. Choose your vantages wisely, people!
---
Reddit lost connections 
---
Don't worry, there's still bacon.
---
So question...if someone throws an artillery smoke grenade on top or the side does the splash damage damage your items on the inside? In my experience with artillery it seems to damage things inside buildings despite only hitting the roof suck as like at the golf course if I use it on the ghouls 
---
Go on recent people, you can find him there 
---
Did you not play FO4? Trailers doors opened in it as well.
---
What ever to distract you from the fact that the game will be abandonware in 6-12 months, right?
---
Yes. They should have had those cards as a single with a 3 level upgrade rather that 3 individual cards that wastes space. It's a chore to swap those cards constantly just to open a container that has trash loot. I choose to pass on anything locked.
---
fallout is easy mode. LOL never really had any point in any fallout game where I struggled or had a hard time. 
---
That's very good, I am trying to be more aware of loot containing circuits since that material repairs mainframe cores and is a little harder to find in the wild than steel
---
 Yeah I do understand. I'm not at all finished with my present build and will get more from him. What I won't do is press buttons. I need to aim and shoot. I don't enjoy button mashing, I did far much in ESO. 
---
I tried but from my iPhone it doesn’t show up properly 
---
many many nuke lamps?
---
Everything 
---
Not..... Us...
---
Ok then, umm hope he has reddit I guess :/
---
I'm not really a hardcore min maxer but I think in the ranged weapon category, semiautomatic rifles outperform basically all the other weapons. I personally use a lever action with vats crit build but I don't know tour personal preference. I've heard good things about the handmade and also the gatling gun with prime receivers. Btw, don't want to promote myself haha but if you're interested and have the 50cal prime plan, I have a furious 50cal and can sell it to you really cheap :)
---
What version are you on Xbox ps4 or pc. If your on Xbox I’ll play with you and help you out
---
I build custom when I find a cool location with natural features that could support a base. The plus to keeping it in a static location is that you can mirror Vault 76 on the map and give yourself cheap fast travel to pretty much all of the locations you may need to jump to.
---
You have 82 fusion cores.......that seems like a lot......
---
That's so sweet, I love to see people taking care of our older people. A lot of people don't really see them as humans anymore, I learned that from working in retail. 
---
I was. For what I can assume was picking up a bag in Whitesprings nuke zone while in combat. Using the take all option and realizing I was about 800 weight, saw there was hundreds of flux and a lot of bulk materials. I died, picked it back up, died again and picked it back up, died again and picked it up almost instantly, and then died again. For some dumb reason I didn't wear power armor, so I kept getting ganged up on on the trek to artisan's corner. The last time I died it either fell through the world, or someone else picked it up. I feel so stupid having picked it up, and then picked it up so many times again. 
---
So far my ban is just a suspension, but I just have a bad feeling about it, considering I picked up that much so many times. 
---
I would be a-okay if Bethesda wiped my account of EVERYTHING because nothing on that account means more to me than having my name cleared and the scarlet D taken off of my chest. 
---
He did enough. 150 is like dropping a MIRV through a Camp window. I had a 700 bounty for tearing up some random Camp cause my friend dared me to. I fully deserved the high bounty and a horrific painful death. I'll never grief again. Not worth losing half my daily caps
---
There is a building mechanic that allows it, bit of a tedious process and time consuming, but you use the fire place and it allows you to place foundations on top of each other.
---
Nice! I will admit I was incredibly lucky recently to find a 40% swing speed bonus super sledge, combining that with martial artist has made silo enemies a breeze (except Assaultrons, damn you and your laser)
---
They won't stay banned, that was never the intent.  Bethesda said once the loopholes are fixed, they'll be reinstated.
---
They're stopping the problem, not getting rid of cheaters.  Not sure if I'm a fan of that or not, but that's how they're handling it.
---
I got to kill one early on because he was glitched and couldn't run. I believe it took 100-200 rounds from a hunting rifle to do it though... I was only level 20 or maybe even lower. 
---
Free XP, so I normally hack/pick unless there's a bypass from a key I picked up previously.
---
Destroyed someones Whitespring camp. He/she is a hero.
---
Nobody gives a shit how many hours you have. It doesn't lend any credibility to any sort of claim just because you play it like a full time job.
---
fake and gay 
---
there was no method that crashed the server lmao...
---
t. duper.
---
Not my idea or concept, it is all over youtube. You also not exploiting as far as I am concerned, you using a building mechanic with things in your camp. Not intended I agree, not sure why ? We could do it in FO4, so why not here, probably just overlooked. Since it doesn't move, probably is not an issue.
---
I did one yesterday and the location of the nuke matters. Fissure prime was in the top left of the strike, so we all fought her out of the nuke zone. No radaway or rad x required. She was much easier. Better fight.
---
HOLY SHIT I'M HALFWAY THROUGH AND LOSING MY MIND!!!
---
People are mad about bases with rocket turrets, bonus madness for bases with excessive rocket turrets over the build cap from the camp duplication bug.
---
I don't skip anything. And when a terminal unlocks something, I log out and lock pick it.
---
It's all free xp. 
---
Yeah, I've had my camp next to SB mini-fissure for close to 3 months now maybe. I've been thinking of relocating, one alternative I've though, to make a turret camp in WS, spesifically of course next to the golf club. Because of the risk imposed by other players, I've thought I should try to make it pleasant, to it and other players to happily co-exists :)
---
Either by having shutters and/or switches, other players can use, to turn off or on the turrets based on what they like.
---
If I try that and I fail at the objective, well then I will probably give up on it.
---
I'v seen some stupid turret camps like one that has just turrets, no stash box or workbenches to recycle loot. If you build there, then at least provide something for passing by players. IMHO.
---
I tend to only have crafting perks for Intelligence, so when I’m not doing that I have the hacker perks in there.
---
Perception wise my perks mostly go on rifle stuff and bits like Green Thumb.
---
I usually have one or two picklock perks in there, but it’s rare I bother swapping out to unlock something.
---
Legendary vendor! Nuclear winter! Backpacks! Distilling!
---
I definitely thought about that, so long as it’s by a resource site for junk, I’m happy
---
How did you layer the walls with foundations, did you have to place the walls first?
---
I didn’t actually see any humans, just a bunch of animals/bugs
---
SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
---
Honestly can't wait for all of this!! I had my doubts, like most people did,  but never gave up hope on Bethesda! 
---
Someone would really have to go out of their way, wouldn't they need to build their camp next to mine ? This is really to stop the twits who show up, destroy your place and leave with their TSE's .. my place has been destroyed multiple times for kicks, no real reason.
---
This roadmap is the definition of HYPE INTENSIFIES
---
That only happens if you launch a nuke at something other than Fissure Prime. Because it's the overseer freaking out about it.
---
They did not address the suspensions/bans. this might get ugly.
---
I used to have a nice setup on the green too. It got wrecked a lot. Now I have a concrete bunker on the green.
---
Did you ever think that most people play games without mics? 
---
I'd agree with that. That's why I never understood how they wanted to make this a PvP MMORPG.
---
The nerf to TSE went against everything that Fallout is and now you have the dilemma of people want to nerf TSE because it was easy mode but melee always was easy mode.
---
You do have the option to turn easy mode off though. Of course when you're not playing with God tier duped weapons and armor....... calculations become important.
---
EXACTLY. 
---
Thanks!  I really want the neon letters, but no luck so far.  I don’t have locks on anything and try to help people out who stop by so I figured a nice hello would show I’m not going to try to kill them
---
It's just annoying when you try to farm a bit and an ass head killed all ghouls before you spawned in with his stupid turret base
---
&gt;New Features: Legendary Vendor and Scrapping – Locate the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary items for new legendary gear. For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams.
---
That's it, I'm in love.
---
Great list - this is going to be very helpful. I'm level 24 and finding this game actually pretty difficult (I die a LOT).
---
There’s even a monorail elevator!
---
Good point, I am going to have to try that .. 
---
Nice! Sounds like some promising content. And it won't cost anything. I have already gotten 200 hours of gameplay. Looks like I will be getting a lot more hours of play in the future.
---
THEY WERE ACTUALLY LISTENING US
---
I loot the same places every day and here's what I've found:
---
There are 2 timers. Personal and global. Items in containers respawn on a personal timer. It's per-container, not per area. So if a container has a chance to spawn military duct tape and there's some ammo and plastic in it this time, dont' touch it. If you loot that ammo or junk, it now goes on your personal timer and will be empty until the timer expires. If you don't take anything, you can server hop and check that same container again for better loot. 
---
This one I'm still figuring out but I think it works like this: Items laying around, like clipboards, ammo bags, duct tape, etc. respawn on a global and a personal timer. So if someone beats you there, you're out of luck.  However, if no one has been there since the reset, when you load into the area, it looks to see what items you had previously looted and will only respawn the items you haven't looted since the last personal timer. So, using Camp McClintock as an example:
---
If I haven't been there in a few days, and I show up and it's been completely looted EXCEPT for the one ammo bag behind the desk because someone missed it, I can grab that one. I server hop or come back later after the global reset (which is on an unknown interval), and no one has looted the place. I can loot the entire place EXCEPT for that one bag I picked up. It won't be there because my personal timer on that item hasn't expired yet and it doesn't spawn it because I triggered the load in of that cell and my timer hasn't expired yet. If someone else comes along after me 5 min later, the entire place will still be looted, including that one bag because the global timer hasn't expired and it never spawned the one bag for me (or anyone) because I had already looted it previously. If no one comes along long enough for the cell to unload completely, then the next player that comes there and forces the cell to reload in, will be able to ONLY loot that one bag because the rest of the cell is on the global timer and doesn't spawn but that one bag that wasn't picked up by that player previously will be there.
---
It also seems that the personal timer is tracked via play-time and not real-time hours. I can load in to a place every single day and only play for an hour and the loot will stay gone for several days. But if I do a whole day play session, the items in that area will respawn about about 12 hours of play. Obviously, subject to the rules above.
---
When looting a place frequently, I will grab a placed item that's very obvious but something not a lot of people grab (like a broom or mop). That way I can quickly see if an area's global timer has reset. If it has but the place is cleaned out of ballistic scrap items, that means someone else has beat me there and I can server hop. But if the mop isn't there, then chances are my personal timer or the global timer hasn't reset yet and server hopping won't help.
---
I would love for others to investigate this and try it out. I'd love to figure out what the actual interval is on personal and global timers.
---
When I first read that I thought you said hold up as "baby." I was like, ok ok, we don't have to jump straight to baby bullet shields!
---
I actually have fun with the terminals because you have more words then the other Fallouts and you have to figure out what is a good starting word to open it.   Yes it's annoying, but at the same time, it's rewarding because it's harder then before.
---
&gt;   And if you farm golf club after lvl 65 plus I can only ask why? 
---
Same reason people over level 65 farm Uranium fever. They're just -dicks.  And the obvious answer to that is... welcome to the world of online multiplayer games. 
---
Many people predicted that turning Fallout into a online multiplayer was a terrible idea and it was. 
---
The build budget is fair, but I do agree some items seem to take a lot of it. I would also like to see an increase by 33%, similar to the recent stash increase. OR a perk that increases build budget, I could get behind that.
---
It almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
---
The one on top of the doorway ? It allows me to put the block back from inside, it considers it ground. So I can essentially lock myself in afterwards. That's also how you stack foundations, with the fireplace. There are a few YouTube videos how to do this.
---
Adding content every week? 
---
No they haven't. 
---
I'm crazy excited for this! My Quests were just starting to dry up. I was losing hope for the Road Map showing up any time soon but my passion for the a Game has been reignited tenfold
---
I'm sorry for the third comment here, but fuck, this is INCREDIBLE. They listened in SO MANY WAYS!
---
Your findings are correct, i see the same thing, but when it happen's i jump server and it get's back to normal, no ider what is going on :/
---
So, if someone is going to do a silo run, check a known enemie first, if this happens jump server so you dont wast you time, the SBQ will be just as hard and have the same bug...
---
I'm just wondering if the walls would stop it. I have a blueprint I saved with 3 artillery pieces on it I sometimes pop down at workshops and such and use on any close by locations to aggro all the enemies.  I have also used artillery to retaliate against someone who used it on my while I had the munitions factory.  
---
It's out already. 
---
That is beautiful!
---
Oh my!!
---
Amazing what having a little god damn faith will getcha. Lol
---
Oh shit.. I didn't realize!
---
When Bethesda refused to clarify what people were actually getting banned for, I guess.
---
Troll get out of here with your new account
---
This is impressive, not gonna lie.
---
With the fireplace trick, just search youtube, people talk about the concept. It's a bit tedious, let me know if you can't find it, but there is a way to stack foundations, just takes much longer, but once you get going, goes relatively quickly. Too bad it is not a standard mechanic like in FO4
---
The fact of the matter is, they are using items like those "unstoppables"  gear that give buffs to entice those to buy them. It boils down to this, they claimed the atom shop would only be cosmetic. This shows that they aren't only cosmetic.
---
They literally sold items for real money that gave people who bought them a distinct advantage over those who didn't purchase it. That is why the only free outfit from the whole thing "mistresses garb" was also the only one that forced the removal of all other armor, while the rest of the gear fell under the cosmetic tab so you could wear them while also wearing your normal armor ontop of them.
---
You can also claim that "oh it wasn't even a big buff". Remember though it stacked based on how many unique outfits your group had on, which totaled 60HP increase. 60hp is not a small amount of HP, that is nearly 20% of most characters total HP. So an increase of 20% is absolutely a big buff.
---
That is the issue, they offered p2w gear in the atom shop when they promised the atom shop would only be for cosmetics and never have a bearing on gameplay.
---
&gt;I am still not a big proponent of the multiplayer aspect but if I don't want to participate in it, I don't have to.
---
I eagerly await your first 'So today I was minding my own business when...' post.
---
Max lvl
---
You can even turn my phone in to a vibrator, it doesnt matter right now. 
---
SUPER cute camp. I love it.
---
literally 3 post about it before this one.... [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps)
---
The game has enough existing problems for me to lose my shit over hypothetical ones, TBH. 
---
Oh ok
---
High Level Vault Raids!! 
---
Never used it, how does it work. Is it simple like a canon, can I just place it and fire at the wall. I assume I can't damage my own camp with it.
---
Brewing and distilling sounds good, however my camp is already at 99% budget so I really do hope that they’ll increase the amount we can build to allow for new stuff.
---
I'm in a tough spot in life right now, and man, did this ever make my day. Thanks :)
---
I dont see how people over 65 doing UF are dicks. Even 35/40 3* weapons can be pretty powerful. Before the TSE nerf even more so. When I hit up UF at level 140, I use a shotgun I picked up from the mole miners in there so everyone gets a tag. 
---
wait the game is hard with non-legendary weapons? lol ur joking right? 
---
This sounds exactly like what I was hoping for. And maybe Nuclear Winter will add in more reasons to nuke unusual locations (unique enemies perhaps)
---
Thanks :) I'll do a couple server hops there later
---
yin/yang, suppose that could be right
---
It's like people didn't learn anything from the pre-release hype.
---
Same, cheated on Minecraft hunger games for like 3-4 matches when I was 12 and took it off right after. Felt wrong and took away all the fun, never done it again. Honestly hate the part of the FO76 community that thinks cheating is their right. Big reason I fell out of the game until survival mode comes out.
---
It's seriously awesome. I'm gonna build my own pyramid when I get a chance
---
"Use items from your stash to decorate yoir C.A.M.P."
---
Vendor machines! 
---
Legendary prestige system? 50+ level love!
---
I feel like they should have just kept FO4's perk system in place and just have it stop at lv 50.
---
Rocket turrets there will be just plain toxic... never saw them there myself, 1 month ago, did you tried to ask why they put it? Maybe they just expect XP from turrets kills alone or its a dick move &gt;_&gt;
---
&gt;customizable backpack
---
hnng
---
neat! Thanks! This'll be handy while doing ghouls.
---
I read that's what they were going to do.
---
It is out and contains the ROADMAP WOHOO! 
---
[Link](https://bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
I can't handle the amazingness. I'm so glad I stuck with you guys. Holy shit :).
---
It's like you really don't wanna let people who enjoy the game keep doing so.
---
I think you aren’t able to do it because it causes too much server stress. *I think* I read that somewhere. Something along the lines of “if the game had to load in everyone’s junk all the time as well as the main assets it would be too much for the server” I’m paraphrasing of course. 
---
It would be cool to fill our displays up tho. Hopefully they can work it out in the future. I spent a lot of time looking for all the different kinds of teddy bears and I’d like to put them on a shelf lol
---
Tesla rifle.. that is all
---
WE'RE GETTING ONE
---
If they can stick to this scheduled this could be an amazing next six months.
---
Is that the motherfuckin **Goat Man**
---
In 76 we have the raiders:  Bring bags, we're looting Whitesprings again.
---
I’m honestly amazed. I’ve stuck with this game through everything that’s happened, but I was starting to lose hope it would ever be as good as I wanted it to be. These new updates sound incredible. They’ve been listening to what we’ve been saying, and I’m seriously excited for 2019!
---
How am I stopping them?
---
"I wouldn't cheat if the game just gave me everything I wanted"
---
man the pre-teen angst is strong with this one
---
They shouldn't clairfy what they are suspended for (at least not publicly) but they should have given some sort of time frame for how long they can expect the suspension to last.
---
Now we can finally SHARE THE HYPE!!!! Hnnnngggggg!
---
Thank you Bethesda so much. This is exactly the sort of  communication that was needed. Hands down, one of, if not the best road maps I have seen. 
---
Sadly, I don't see the servers being able to handle the strain of this, anytime soon. 
---
On killing the SBQ it still takes 5+minutes to get the quest rewards, and up to 8 minutes to be able to loot the bodies. 
---
The servers are already under immense strain, even with the duping bans and items removed. 
---
Maybe in future, when the code is much more highly optimised. 
---
Would love to display some bobbleheads and magazines. 
---
Nuclear Winter sounds amazing!
---
Oh man. Great news, great upcoming content. To the people who have quit the game: lol
---
Great job!! I would add Inside the Vault to the title though so people don’t confuse it for a separate blog
---
I've seen your comments history. 
---
My mind is just blown. 
---
I've seen them only 4 times since the game launched and I visit 3-6 vendors every day. They are either just a rare spawn or once someone has grabbed them, they take a while to respawn. I've seen them at Sutton and Pleasant Valley stations and at the BoS vendor. Save your caps and wait for them to show up.
---
A lot of those things sound insanely interesting and I will definitely come back to check them out. Backpacks, Legendary Vendors, Prestige System. Dang.
---
Those are so annoying. Just build a natural bunker, not a big ugly mess
---
They've earned nothing but skepticism so far but this definitely looks like a step (more than one even) in the right direction.
---
it just works 
---
They should add in the feral ghoul Reaver from Fallout 3. The F4 generation of ghouls just don't compare. Less so in F4 than 76 I guess because you can't severe their legs this time. No monster-boxing though so jump scares aren't as common. 
---
I have seen some scary ghouls on account of bugs in 76. Ever see a crouched ghoul start motionlessly ice skating towards you in a dark prison?
---
Nuclear winter seems like the whole map could be a nuke zone? that would be sick!
---
RPI is better
---
You place it at your camp or a workshop.  Get a smoke grenade from the box on it. It has a limited range and start up time but once it starts it will shell the area you tossed the grenade.  Very effective at damaging bases and workshops but not much use against mobs unless you use it from a stealthed position.  They are more of a toy then a useful weapon but again they are hell on bases if you are within range 
---
Doesn't really answer the question. Or is it 'Reeee, this man saying things impacts my gameplay'
---
I think I need an ELI5 on this.  I thought stuff like the marine wetsuit/vaultsuit/etc were cosmetic only or at best gave an insignificant boost to DR/ER.  I didn't know they could boost specials as well?
---
The Legendary system is like Skyrim.
---
Level 50 meat hook with extra hook does more damage than the unmodded power fist or the deathclaw gauntlet with  extra claw.  I don't have a puncturing power fist so I can't speak for that.  
---
The "something in return" he was talking about is the quest reward for doing a workshop defense, which everyone gets for participating, not something he was looking to get from them. And the crickets didn't "belong" to the crew there any more than anyone has a right to any other enemy. This is pure absurdity.
---
Legendary vendor 😮
---
LEGENDARY VENDORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
---
&gt; just started playing 
---
There is your problem.
---
I hope you will figure it out everything with your life, just don't give up :) 
---
UF is fine at any lvl, tho personally I kinda ignored it, great xp and drops at any lvl as some legendaries are godly even at 30lvl cap, there was also kinda "rule" to let all people tag 3 stars before finishing them. 
---
???
---
They haven't released their future plans yet. So we all have no idea what/when anything will happen, other than some hints. None of which mentioned weekly new content. 
---
If anything, maybe a big content release every two months is much more likely. 
---
With patches for bugs and balancing once or twice a month like it currently is. 
---
Ohhh a back system for may
---
I really don't know. Most of my pvp is getting my bloodied the dragon to 1000+ damage and one shotting wanted players.
---
This sounds great. I must admit that I was starting to get a little worried that Bethesda might just give up on this game. I have already gotten an amazing value out of the $40 I spent on this game. Buying 76 despite all the bad press was a smart move.
---
Why you even here then?  Oh, and they just released their roadmap to the game.  Do us a favor, just leave now if that's your attitude.
---
Google Skyrim legendary skills.
---
Glad I fucking stayed. I'm actually so excited
---
Yeah, I had this happen a couple times- always sucks. But since then I started dumping my junk whenever I’m exploring areas without a level cap. At least then when I die I only lose a few rubber. And now that I’m all armored and leveled up, I don’t have to worry about that anymore. Hang in there, you’re in the awkward part of the game where you feel ready to venture further out, but are still a bit too squishy to comfortably fight waves of high level enemies.
---
Fasnacht Parade, yessss!  That's where we'll get the other Helvetia masks.
---
The things I could do with even 30% more camp budget! I love building my camp, it's a high class escape in the wasteland 
---
Thank you :)
---
Finally!  Some solid new features and quests!
---
Ya live servers are a bit dif than our solo days in skyrim and fo4
---
but where is player vending?
---
Tears of joy running through my chin. THANKS FOR LISTENING BETHESDA!!
---
Vats is dependent on AP and its accuracy is shit unless you build your build around it. Adamantium skeleton take 3 points to be immune to crippling so you usually have to give up other perks to run it. 
---
Lol yeah I haven’t opened a lock or terminal I didn’t have to since level 65 or so. I’m 113 now
---
I’ll grant you it is possible they missed it, but there where dups that were widely know for sure (Dogmeat glitch, etc.), which, I hope, would have raised a red flag to make sure they got them all, as many as possible or at least put in better roadblocks before release. 
---
So, while I agree that this particular glitch was not well known, it was still known. 
---
I did the same! I built a staircase up to the little alcove on the inside for power armor as well as a table and chair up at the top of where you can build!
---
Yesssss!!!! As an added bonus if ya have life saving armor doit twice! Lolololol lol!
---
https://i.imgur.com/WlVVoGZ.gif
---
Any chance some kind heart could cut'n'paste for the unfortunately firewalled?
---
Oh ,boy.  And you need attention.  That's probably why your so angry.
---
If it's in the game then it's not cheating. I would blame the corporate for not giving a shit about the product they released.
---
I saw the briefcase you’re talking about (at alpha) but it was empty for me :(
---
I guess we'll find out. They may just nerf those effects heavily. I can see wht they'd release the other stars: more grinding, and more people playing 
---
It is in the announcement. Still coming.
---
no it shouldn't
---
This is impressive. March is turning out to be a month of gaming. Not just with Fallout 76.
---
Smiling Larry.  who knew he was immortal?
---
March 26th is soooooo farrrrr away lol. But hol th hell I'm stoked for everything tbh!!!
---
Can you not see it its set for april
---
I'd have been fine too, if it weren't for those pesky Level 40'ers :-(
---
I put my base there but I remove the turrets. I have an open base for other players to scrap n store. Sometimes I do see turret towers..i usually attack them but they just hard crash and their base respawns back in perfectly untouched..annoying...since the ban hammer is swinging ban these players for exploiting that area.
---
Don’t worry you’ll forget when you go a few days without finding a trailer that opens, then you get to discover this again!
---
It's a right metal arm and a right trapper leg. I can mod both, if you'll provide the extra adhesive and screws needed. 
---
Several of the other items have already be modded. 
---
Message me if interested. 
---
Damn, I don't even own the game but this shit is looks cool. I'll be sure to get it if it's on sale for around $10-20 
---
Definitely. The duped items have been minimized in the meantime, but I think this is their big picture solution to character resets for all of the leveling exploits(though to be fair we were never told the ghouls in Whitesprong we’re giving a unintended amount of xp)
---
HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE 
---
Can you imagine the drama to come? Scrubs vs raiders and their cool gear.  Solo'ers wanting the best, but only having time for an hour or two of play a day.  Seen this shit sooo many times before.
---
You shouldn't feel stupid, maaaaaan. They cast the net a little too wide, and they'll probably review which accounts were flagged. That's why people are suspended instead of banned it seems like
---
April 9th. It’s in the picture provided!
---
It's March 12th.  Still too far away :D
---
Some things don't appear at all for all players... I think it also depends on the quest you happen to be involved with.
---
Can i just say, that I have a mini base built in the area of concern on an alt. 
---
It consists of a base level floor, with free water, food plants, and all crafting items. 
---
It has 4 turrets set far enough back that they never aggro the spawned mobs, but are just there to protect the base if someone drags mobs over to try and grief. 
---
So some of us are just enjoying the easy to build terrain, and make a simple base to help others who are farming the area. 
---
Maybe create a turret limit for the area to prevent purely turrey bases only? 
---
&gt;there was also kinda "rule" to let all people tag 3 stars before finishing them.
---
I'm really sick of reading this kind of crap, as it is so obviously bullshit.  
---
Fasnacht parade is two weeks late though 
---
I hope this helps the Brotherhood come to terms with living/loving in a game they claim to hate.
---
So is Bethesda going to address the adrenal mutation bug? I think its really unfair that it has not been officially addressed. People need info. Is it a bug or a nerf and are you fixing it? 
---
WHELP. thank god stash went up to 800. I am now storing every junkies rolling pick I pick up until May 23rd!!!!
---
I think that would be a valid method to move something IRL also.
---
So you destroy people’s stuff they worked hard on and you’re innocent?
---
I don’t think that’s how this works. I don’t care if that’s your cheesy grind spit. You don’t have to be a dick and destroy people’s shit.
---
Honestly... I don't think I can get excited till these things release. They all sound great, but execution has been an ongoing problem.
---
Farm the legendaries, stick them on mules, and get ready to roll the dice Raider! That's my plan.
---
I recommend trading out the foundations for concrete, just looks sturdier to me.
---
Intresting, I was semi expecting some retarted one-liner joke instead of actual interview. 
---
Good actual stuff, not gossip, even though people should remember it's just one person telling his point of view.
---
When was this interview made?
---
Woah. Scrap legendaries :)
---
So excited for this. Can we talk about the roadmap art for Wild Appalachia and how its definitely maybe teasing a new Cryptid goatman/jersey devil inspired type creature? 
---
I think what they meant was ancient sloths being in WV was the INSPIRATION for the Mega Sloths, not the in-lore explanation. There’s no actual in-game explanation; I’m just guessing based on context clues. I.e. there’s a series of empty cages in one of the mining company manors in Ash Heap and its mentioned that the son of the CEO, Isaac, had some weird obsession with sloths and kept a whole bunch as pets; so I assumed they escaped post war and mutated.
---
Not gonna play it again til single player or significant NPCs and active storyline are added 
---
Yeah sorry this was my mistake. If you nuke something other than fissure prime you'll get a unique holotape.
---
Use items from your stash to decorate your C.A.M.P.  
---
That's basically a game changer for me!
---
Read terminals in the whitesprings bunker. Particular attention to science/medical wing. If I remember right maybe it's a listen rather than read. Cryptic on purpose to prevent spoilers. ;)
---
Now THAT is a roadmap.  I'm  excited,  good  work.
---
Just please, before releasing anything, double check it, triple check it. Make sure it'll work before releasing anything major so we can avoid  some of the larger pains that might occur.  I'd rather something  be delayed and not bugged later than released broken and isn't fixed until later. 
---
Cool. Then why are you still here?
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
Well...I wouldn't go that far...but the Road Map is encouraging.
---
This is incredible. Don't know what more we could want. Regular content updates app damn year!
---
Looks good.  I'm excited for the rest of the Fasnacht masks.
---
But say, /u/Ladydevann - how about that big mountain man beard?  We getting that?  Huh?  What about maybe a kilt and a big ol' beard for St. Patrick's Day?  Hmmm?  Hmm?  How bout that?  Hmm?  Hmm?   Poke, poke, nudge, nudge.  Have you lost weight?  Your hair is amazing!  That outfit, so perfect.  So how about that beard, hmm?  
---
So, my big question after reading this: Will there be any living human/ghoul NPCs?
---
and i know how to fix the fucking dupes to lol
---
7 million is small? I wonder if duper activity helped Bethesda ”stress test” the servers resulting in our 800 item stash increase. Heck, I would think with dupers gone we could go even higher. 
---
More like.   REEEEEEE, this hastily released game didn't deliver on my unrealistic expectations.  REEEE MUST DESTROY!!!!
---
So you think I could damage my own camp with it ? I was shooting at the walls yesterday but just assumed I wasn't doing any damage. I do have it, so could probably try it and see what happens .. can a friend also set it off ? Maybe I can get a friend not a team to fire it.
---
First off, I recommend getting complex with your architecture from a frame standpoint. Learn how the slant pieces clip on and make something non-square shaped. Maybe making an L shaped building with a 1.5 unit tall wall, a high roof inside. Once you learn how the different pieces fit together, you can improve from there.
---
Backpacks?! Distillery?! More booze?! Item placement in C.A.M.P.S?! Sign me riiiiiight up!
---
Ahahaha! Added to the feedback :)
---
I built an AK from a parts kit IRL and don't we have gunsmith rank 1.
---
No. I don't have any mutations.
---
Dang, I haven’t played the game this year, but this may make me come back to the game. 
---
I am happy with the game as it is now. All this *free* incoming DLC makes me excited.
---
No you can damage your own camp
---
The Fall update, Wastelanders, seems to imply that we'll see some humans. 
---
Honestly, my only real complaint. I wanna BUILD!!!
---
That makes sense. I'm just unlucky I guess.
---
Time to hoard everything!!
---
Thank you. I'll have to experiment with this later. I didn't try server hopping.
---
Thanks for your 2c, pretty sure peoples camps are subjective but thanks for dropping by.
---
that's the day before my birthday, cool
---
I already had one and  it wasn’t fun
---
That new cryptid questline has me salivating. Looks like it's about time to boot up 76 again!
---
I thought the white rider was conquest/war and the pale rider was death/pestilence? My understanding was that "pale" came from a weird translation, and the word used in the source material was closer to "jaundiced" or "sickly and green-ish," like a gross-ass zombie horse; but because "a rider on a green-ish horse" sounds weird, we got riders on black, red, white, and off-white horses.
---
Vending and backpacks alone are enough to get me excited.
---
Maybe similar to destiny? You scrap weapons/armor for shards or whatever, and then you can use those to purchase high tier weapons from the vendor. In destiny the legendary vendor comes around once a week and has 3-4 higher tier stuff you buy through scrapping
---
The OP said they were using their mics while trying to find him...did you read the op?
---
And the artillery would need to not be in your camp because it cant fire to close to itself 
---
I thought so too at first but it's not that bad! It forced me to rely on food/water and not barge guns blazing into mobs... I ended up with more stims than I'd usually have just by playing it safer for a few days. So that's a win.
---
It is going to be interesting, I cannot wait!
---
Notice the little robot buddy in the greyed out new features badge? &lt;.&lt;
---
Dude, right? I think this may shake up the markets on 3* items. Still, though, we don't know enough.
---
BRUH!!! LEGENDARY PLAYERS? NUCLEAR WINTER?! 
---
Destroying one camp is not griefing. Please stop using the term as a catch all.
---
dont forget adding snow to the mix.
---
But this sounds like you would be resetting the entire character. 
---
What kind?
---
#NPCS ARE COMING 
---
ITS LITERALLY ALL OUR TOP SUGGESTIONS
---
THANKS BETH
---
Big middle finger to all you Chicken Littles insisting that the sky was falling and Bethesda had given up on the game.  I'm sick of this bullshit every time Bethesda releases a new game and has early struggles.
---
:-)
---
I have to admit you all kind of nailed it on the road map.  I'm impressed.
---
Ahh, I see what you're saying! Possible!
---
Alright that makes sense. Thanks 
---
I'd imagine it'll be closer to a mode where resources are extremely limited, and combat is more intense. 
---
BACKPACKS?!??
---
PRESTIGING?!??
---
LEGENDARIES VENDOR?!??!
---
player vending machines are going to hook me.  Go into a CAMP, they have that GO-Joe with Kung-Fu Grip that I've been looking for, and now it's a race to get the 3000 caps i need before the player decides to log off and her CAMP de-spawns
---
Boxem like oxem or like foxem?
---
I don't ignore locks anymore but, I also keep track of what locations give me the highest chance of getting plans. Most of my weapon plans come from rank 3 locks so I highly recommend them. If I find terminals that I haven't used before I make sure to explore all their features. If they open doors to good loot, I never pass them up. Otherwise if they don't do anything interesting I ignore them.
---
You could have stopped at 12 hours a day haha. Yeah my old Prime TSE Gatling with martial artist was a thing of beauty. Sad to see that bug fixed 
---
Not sure bout currently reading a post from Bethesda saying that in spring we get wild Appalachia in summer we get nuclear winter and in fall we get “WASTELANDERS”
---
Yeah but it's allot easier to prevent things from being added them getting them removed when they are
---
That is a good idea too
---
Unrealistic? Not everyone has product standards that could win a Jamaican Limbo Championship.
---
Damn, March 12th is the same day as my senior presentation 
---
Sorry, word police.
---
OOH!
---
Cause I'm waiting and this is an update. Wastelanders might sound like it has what I'm waiting for.
---
Is criticism bad again just because they finally did something good? Is it not okay to say "okay but this is not what I want?" Is only hivemind okay?
---
the best fucking response you could've made, actually made me laugh 
---
I see leveling exploits as a glitch. Killing ghouls that give a lot of XP early on, in my opinion, not an exploit. 
---
Clearing West Tek gives a comparable amount of XP 
---
Because you bashing him is any different?  So he deserves to be attacked based on a lack of evidence but not defended based on the same lack of evidence? 
---
Your logic to life is flawed.
---
Ok now I’ve got to start grinding to get some legendary stuff. I’m pumped for all of this! 
---
Ok, bye.
---
That would be awesome
---
THEY FIXED THE FUCKING GAME!
---
Totally just walk last them now too. Not worth the effort. 
---
I have a vampire combat rifle modded to 38 and it's my exclusive weapon in the woods and toxic valley. Free ammo and healing all in one.
---
For many of us it's not a comeback, we were told how this game was going to play out as an experimental release with growing pains.  This is what we were expecting and waiting for while everyone else on the sub lost their fucking minds because Bethesda wasn't reassuring them on a daily basis with sweet promises.
---
I'm impressed.
---
Possibly. I'm sure they'll change things to fit. No point in conjecturing.
---
&gt;we’re happy to report that game and server stability has increased over 300% since launch
---
So when's the equivalent 300% increase to stash size coming?
---
Nah man, that’s not what they meant
---
I wonder how the prestige system will work for players double or triple level 50. Will they get multiple prestige off the hop? Or will they just get the one?
---
Color me shocked this was released
---
Congrats those pukes are fast..
---
Cant wait to read all the haters while we enojy our game! Hope this is the first year of many for FO76.
---
Don't get upset bruh. I used to use a game genie and cheat on Super Nintendo back in the days. I'm just saying that those of us who are not cheesing it with duped deathclaws and unyielding armor enjoy calculating dps of different weapon types. 
---
That duped deathclaw that you have that does 10k damage..... someone crunched the numbers on that before you went looking for one. Now hurry up and go find that meat hook because someone else crunched the numbers on that for you and it's better than a deathclaw.
---
“THE BIGGEST AND MOST AMBITIOUS UPDATE “
---
Permanent now that camps seem to work. Some people have alt characters and have the alt's with moveable camps. It can get quite costly to move it around all the time, so people place it in strategic positions across the map to fast travel to for free and use the vault to get back. Mine are all permanent. I have 10 characters across 2 xboxes and use each my characters to fast travel to different locations, I never pay for travelling, I either walk or setup camp near somewhere I get to get, every where from Camden Park, Flatwoods, Abbie's bunker, whitespring, the bog (fissure prime), top of the world and near the space station.
---
Uhg i cant wait! To trade this damned 1 star junkies crap for something half useful. I rarely use drugs let alone stimpacks. 
---
The word junky triggers me. It should be changed to safe spacers sidekick.
---
I hope you took some me tats first to boost that condition bar! 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/atjvs0/fallout_76_road_map/?st=JSGBQVPO&amp;sh=b954ff33
---
I know but to many people it'll feel like a comeback. 
---
Oh wow, a ton of stuff coming and it all looks amazing!!
---
Finger guns emote, "ehhh"
---
Kudos to the team I've been having a blast playing and now I'm even more excited to keep playing. I'm so excited to do raids and start selling items.
---
What resources come out of that generator? I can’t tell 
---
Almost like there are different people who play games and the same people who buy RMT items are the same that support and buy microtransactions. Though, the latter group is larger.
---
Holy shit this sounds amazing! Bethesda could have just turned this around. (Providing it all works that is)
---
Servers have been amazing since the ban wave
---
If you used the trade feauture.....its horrible and dam near impossible to use,  it's easier to drop it in a container and have your alt pick it up.
---
For the same reason high levels drop stuff in containers because bags fall through the ground due to bad code errors.
---
Your logic that you wouldn't do that based on absolutely nothing is ignorant. 
---
Which ones you need ? I can craft all 300 each 
---
Have you considered that since what you want won't be in the game? There is no reason for them to be, this just might not be your game dude
---
Yeah, loving those options!!!  I'm really curious about the Faction stuff coming tooooooooo!
---
Almost like patrolling the Mojave.
---
The small lake north of the Overseer's Camp is definitely going to be one of the busiest
---
Hold my beer, off to whitesprings to stock up on legendary wooden armor and rolling pins!
---
Hey Bethesda
---
This is exactly what I needed to see after having my faith shaken. Please adhere to your intended schedule and I will come back as a full time player and supporter. 
---
not that but why are the noses so fucking ugly 
---
Great....WV is going to get over run by tourists........
---
I wonder which "state" they will come from, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania or Maryland.
---
Sorry he said he would do them for free 
---
I TOLD YOU BOIS!
---
YOU JUST GOT TO HAVE SOME GODDAMN FAITH,  ARTHUR!
---
Whitesprings assholes wiping the nuke zone mobs out
---
Not a single mention of mod support unless I missed it.
---
The complaint of no new content always irritated me. The first DLC for FO4 didn't hit until 19 weeks after launch. Patience is a virtue.
---
It's how they have the lists set up, the "Calculate for each item in Count".  
---
That theoretically shows all plans, however somewhere there appears to be a cap on the number of plans it will pick, and can be reproduced in game.  
---
"Use All" would be the correct flag, in theory, but there are some portions of the engine not yet decoded
---
Sorry Mom the mob has spoken
---
Because following me to different threads posting meaningless replies to by argument is beneficial to someone?
---
At least I'm looking for the truth not just posting nonsense.
---
Yeah, I'm curious if we need to start storing legendary crap for the vendor!  :)
---
yeeeeeeeeeeeessaaaaa!!!!

WASTELANDERS
---
RELEASE: FALL 2019
---
Embark on a tale with true choice and consequences in Wastelanders – our biggest and most ambitious update for 76. Wastelanders will include a new main questline, new factions, new events, new features and even more surprises.
---
POGGERS
---
So much stuff coming in Spring alone! Can’t wait for all the new content. No wonder we haven’t heard much, this is a huge amount of new things being worked on 
---
The Purveyor....why am i getting Xur vibes??
---
But without anything interesting to do
---
oh that is a good point.....with legendary players will you start back at vault 76 or will it just reset your stats where you stand, hmm.
---
But they are so compact, I can roll a couple of them up into my trapper armor's backpack!
---
Thats why i thought that these items could be like every other objects in camp. I mean you could add them using camp not by dropping them from inventory. They would be solid but i think servers could handle them this way. 
---
I wonder if there will proportional benefits depending on how many levels you drop. 
---
Cheers - but I already read it - hence my edit. 
---
So content every 2-3 months give or take. 
---
Definately not weekly. 
---
Npc's are meth, high level vault raids has my interest 
---
Underrated Comment! Have an Upvote!
---
Indeed, client side only.
---
To make it "feel good" when you finally get a junk legendary you don't want or have any use for.  
---
At least that's what they said in their first comment in this chain.
---
Their site doesnt work on my mobile device. Oh well, guess I'll read it tonight. :)
---
Thats quite odd then, ive notice the same but also there is a mutation bug so I figured it was that. Maybe they did so.e buffing. 
---
PS4 - tag is gvsujulius
---
Nice job
---
There will be also faction stuff?
---
Observant! Let's go with it...
---
You were silly to buy it in the first place then as it was known from the start it would never have those things.
---
I've been taking a little bit of a break from FO76 but this is going to get me way into it again. These updates look awesome!
---
You can make LOADs of it from the forest.  Only real limiting factor is finding the firecap shrooms. I made 25 in one run once (was making to sell it only to find out you cant sell it to vendors) I did have Green Thumb, Chemist, and Super Duper active but you get the idea.
---
Requires
---
Boiled water (1)
---
Bloodleaf (2)
---
Firecap (2)
---
Snaptail reed (2)
---
Concrete, but you obviously can place your camp at any deposit for any resource your want. There is a map of all deposits across the map. I needed a lot of concrete to build this place and I always lack concrete, so it made sense in this case.
---
I'm legitimately feeling that tingling of excitement again. Don't stop, Bethesda! Don't stop!
---
7! 7! 7! ***7!***
---
War; war never changes. In 2018, this great subreddit accepted that constant feedback was the only way to preserve our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of bug-free gaming. If the haters could only see us now. From duping to disconnects, canvas bags to donut spam, we have fought. And now, the salty cheaters menace is at our doorstep. Democracy itself is under threat of annihilation. That is why today, February 22, 2019, one hundred days after this great game began, we gather together to honor the completion of Vault 76's roadmap. 
---
This sprawling underground community may have been engineered by reddit, but it was built by you, the good people of r/FO76, so that if the shitposts do come, if the end does come, our way of life will endure. But not everyone will be saved. Those chosen to subscribe to this subreddit must be our best and our brightest, for when the theorycrafting has stopped and the meta has settled, you must rebuild. Not just walls, not just buildings, but hearts and minds and, ultimately, your Atom Shop decorations themselves.
---
So as we stand here today, we pray that gaming will know peace. But if that is not our destiny, if more community outrage must come, we stand together knowing that here in r/FO76, our future begins.
---
The minutemen made m e laugh. Honestly I think i'm a part of pretty much all of those groups. Im probably not the only one.
---
Absolutely not. Do know you need to find 3 star enemy to HAVE a chance for 3 star drop. And it may drop 1 star too.
---
And then about 95 of time that 3 star is useless item or useless combo on semi-useful item. About 4% of time it can be decent item with decent 2 or hell maybe all 3 stars can be decent, in which case even if you won't have any use for it, you might pick it up and sell it for 2k-3k or something. Maybe 0.1% time it can be good item with all 3 stars being good. Then there's god tier drops which are way below that 0.1% chance.
---
Here's a typical 3 star legendary. Base item okey but crap+crap+crap effects. Well yeah the second effect on armor is usually useless anyway but when both first and third are crap them it's all that is is.
---
https://i.imgur.com/p9QswTl.jpg
---
That's only "useful" for level 43 to maybe 60 melee player who only has one star armor. Can't be used by lower levels because of the level cap, and isn't really even worth keeping for them if they need to level 10 more before they could equip it.
---
Some people might not even pick up stuff like that. I always pick up all since it's instanced and I only see it, but then I might drop them on the spot, in this case as it was 3 star I placed it nearby ammo box where it can survive little bit longer, just for the minuscule chance that someone could use it. Very unlikely as it was Harpers Ferry. If a vendor is near and I could sell it to that, I would, but well, you can't donate to vendors.
---
Why are you being downvoted? 
---
Bethesda has yet to successfully release an update without several game breaking "features" so far through the entire release of this game...
---
It still has quite a few flaws. Give it until the first week of march and see how it changes.
---
I’m thinking that’s something like doubling server capacity or something like that. They’ll never add NPCs
---
Just randomly spawned me inside 
---
This is why im suggesting them to be solid items like everything else in camp. I think in this scase they should just raise the camp capasity. I know its easier said that done but this way it would be more plausible i quess.
---
Because on the whole they’ve hit a lot of dupers so must be targeting the right things and there something tremendously circumspect in having on hand 10,000 rounds of ultracite ammo. I’ve tried picking cobalt flux and that’s hard as fuck to get, then there’s the harden mass which up two weeks ago would auto deconstruct and even then it’s surprisingly hard to find, Unlike the other components that only require that you loot corpses in a nuke zone. For me that’s to much ammo to make a stockpile. 
---
I used to wear the ratted skirt as a compensation for the kilt - It' just didn't do to it.
---
They have disappeared haven't they? I have learned a couple of the mods (deep pocket for sure) I'll have to check what the others are 
---
Well, there's also Grahm the super mutant, but I know what you mean. 
---
lol reworking a Beserker build, so would love to get some more buffs and regrind. It's a lot of fun as you are always in constant danger, keeps the tension as you play!
---
Wastelanders in the fall will be a new main quest with "true choices and consequences"... interesting. Judging by the title it kinda sounds like they'll want to add human NPCs with that expansion. 
---
I wonder how they're gonna do a questline with choices &amp; consequences in a shared world, though - one thing I liked about 76's quests compared to other MMO-styled games is that it doesn't pretend to be a single-player game where all the other players aren't doing the same shit, so I hope they preserve that design.
---
&gt;can't disprove or argue against half of what someone said, better dismiss it as incomprehensible ranting
---
but I did. I quoted the thick of your post, countered it, and dismissed the rest for what it was.
---
&gt;You're an idiot. It is a god roll weapon, you can get this thing well upwards of 3k damage.
---
a god roll, although subjective, is a BiS/best in slot. forget about legendaries for a second, what is better, a Chinese Officer Sword or a Super Sledge/Grognak's Axe? the answer is obvious. so yes, your Chinese Officer Sword is a great roll, just not godly.
---
&gt;I've had offers to trade it for 3\* bloodied gatling guns and other desirable god roll weapons.
---
were they godly? or just "desirable"? because being 3\* doesn't automatically make something godly. regardless, the point is that you'd only get something as good as your offering- at best. so a bloodied Gatling with 2 out of 3 BiS legendary mods. not to mention things have changed a lot since patch 4, the market is a lot more stingy because dupes are gone.
---
&gt;You keep telling me over and over that you can prove things instead of actually proving them.
---
because I said I could *if* you asked for it. you never did. I have to look for the number every time I post this.
---
although we can't calculate the exact odds of rolling a specific 3\*, some of the variables are unknown to us, we can calculate the best possible odds based off variables we do know.
---
say you wanted a nocturnal, +% vats hit chance, reduced weight Assault Rifle. there are 23 possible prefixes, 7 major mods and 9 minor ones. so the odds are 1 in 23, 1 in 7 and 1 in 9, or **0,04347** \* **0,14285** \* **0,11111** = **0,00068**.
---
keep in mind that, the more variables we throw into the mix, the worse the odds get. they will never improve because of some variable that we don't know about, like the spawn rate of legendary mobs, or the chance they're 3\*, or even dropping legendary gear at all. for example, I forget the exact number, but there's 45 different weapons in the legendary pool give or take. so that's 0,02222 * 0,00068 = 0,00001
---
if anything, I'd say 0.000001 is a conservative estimation based on the number of missing variables in this equation.
---
&gt;Lastly, and again repeatedly, no one gives a shit about pvp or the armor you need for it. I already covered this, why are you still talking about it?
---
because that's not an argument, it's your opinion. and maybe that of the majority, yes, but subjective nonetheless.
---
This has got to be one of the most asinine comments I've ever read on here.
---
You are doing things the game developers didn't want you to do. Purposely breaking the game for your own gain. I like to call it scumbaggery.
---
With that same dumb thought process it ok to walk by an unattended money truck in RL and steal a bag of money. You know, because it is in the world and I am able to.
---
As a decent human being you should know the difference between right and wrong. If you don't then your parents have failed you miserably.
---
Great!
---
You assumed the duper was a younger person.  What made you come to this conclusion since the older generation also shows the same "I want it now" tendencies.
---
I don't understand it, but I support you sir and or madam!
---
I was under the impression that this started. [Here](https://www.pcgamer.com/amp/new-quests-and-events-coming-to-fallout-76-plus-another-increase-to-stash-size/) 
---
It looks like it's coming in March. But I read that it will be implemented slowly each week.
---
Apparently this uodate is expected either March 12, or several weeks later, according to their guide map. 
---
I have run across a super mutant vendor.
---
&gt; Your ass
---
And other places where you can shove it.
---
I'm just gonna build a 1x1 cube with no roof and drop teddy bears in it until budget is capped.
---
I spent some time last night trying to find a new plan for my main.  Got dupes of the Union uni and hat...still no dress also.
---
conspiracy theory: based on "wastelanders" description;
---
&gt; Embark on a tale with true choice and consequences in Wastelanders – our biggest and most ambitious update for 76. Wastelanders will include a **new main questline**, **new factions**, new events, new features and even ***more surprises***.
---
NPCs will be introduced
---
HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING 
---
Did you actually read that post, I've quoted it numerous times......
---
They are not counting the amount of items you have,  they are counting the amount you have picked up in a 30 day period.
---
This obvious oversight lumps in everyone including those who trade a lot on reddit or accidentally picked up a bag full of duped crap with the guilty.  That doesnt make them actually guilty it makes the logic used to find guilty exploiters absolutely flawed in its implication.
---
Bethesda has not gotten a fix right without screwing up 3 more things, why would u think this is any different. 
---
Oh and I meant before they changed it when we were getting 600 do per ghoul. That was awesome but ridiculous haha
---
I think that if you had a section of foundation that was just barely into the dirt and you removed it, you could go in and put it back.  If that doesn't work then a line of regular foundation that is tall (barely into the dirt) like a deck or front porch, with nothing behind it at that level and just blocks at the next level up.  When you remove it, it will snap back in.
---
I would Gold you, if I had money.
---
Love it when someone proves the very thing you are warning another person about.
---
[http://loudwire.com/tom-delonge-bigfoot-blink-182-tours/](http://loudwire.com/tom-delonge-bigfoot-blink-182-tours/)
---
He is known, but the Fall DLC implies more NPCs and I would hope it's not human NPCs
---
“Embark on a tale with true choice and consequence” New main quest new factions events and more surprises”
---
I'm almost sexually aroused
---
Would that be like a burnt umber? 
---
Dammit, fine I'll download the game again. 
---
Bethesda you beautiful bastards. Thanks for not letting this one fall by the wayside. 
---
There really isn't enough detail to slant it either direction, I think it's a bit soon to be excited but I'm hopeful.
---
given the "new factions" and "true choice and consequences " in the blurb about it, I could see them having npc hubs on the borders of the map as people move back into WV
---
This likely will get down voted but it does not mean it is wrong.  
---
The game was better when the duping was occurring, more people obviously played, which made interactions more frequent and added to the whole experience.  The game seemed way cooler.  The market place was considerably more active too.  Not saying that duping is good, just saying this illustrates that they are WAY off in the drop rates.  If they want no one to want to play the game, then they are pointed in the right direction.   We are making you play a chore simulator and barely ever rubbing the reward part of your brain.  Who would know that would turn off most people.  Where as when the dupers were around, there was a way to get what people wanted.  The chores had a meaning, get caps to get what you want.   There is a small percent of you that say, this is the way it should be it should not be this easy, etc.  A large percent more think it is way too far the other direction, and that is probably why interested has gone way down in this game and less people play.   So have fun playing with yourselves while everyone else leaves.
---
For sure, I'm glad they're putting this out. I like all the things on it, like I said, but I'm just not willing to get hyped up yet. 
---
Also, oh well about downvotes. I get it, this is a celebratory post and I'm being a bit of a party pooper. Makes sense to me! 
---
In my experience that attitude in the gaming world exists mostly in younger players. If you are talking about that kind of attitude in buying houses and ruining the housing market for future generations, then I would agree with you there. 
---
Ignore the people telling you to wait until March. If you do that your character won't be ready for the new content when it drops lol. People that have been playing since launch have apparently forgotten the 80 hour long main questline.
---
It’s out (: happy now ? 
---
Never had a base attacked, but yes, I think you need to.  South of 96, Flatwoods, and outside Wataga Station will be hot spots.
---
You're confusing hazmat suit with regular armor rad resistance. Both power armor and the hazmat suits have the hidden bonus.
---
&gt;Duper was appreciative of temp ban wave. Required more effort than permaban that they would have expected from other games.  
---
Uh... what? Most permabans in games are just temp bans set for a arbitrarily long time. Though, that arbitrarily long time is getting shorter and shorter with the way we've stored time.
---
It sounds like a freaking battle royale to me
---
Am I mistaken, or had a previous update not mentioned Faction Warfare as one of the features Bethesda was working on? I'm not seeing that on here. Don't get me wrong, this looks super cool. I'm just wondering if this is still part of the plan, or if it got deep six'd along the way? 
---
I only play solo. I have about 200 hours in, and have only been harassed by one player. A lower level character wandered into my CAMP, invited me to his team, I ignored and he shot me. I shot back once, thinking he would leave me alone, but he kept shooting me, so I killed him. That's it. All other interactions with people have been positive or neutral. Usually I just ignore them and keep doing my solo thing. If you loved FO4 that much, you should enjoy this game. It is similar to F04, but with almost NPCs. And look at the roadmap Bethesda just came out with... Lots of new content coming for free. At the least, get the game when it is on sale. I paid $40, and would have gladly paid quite a bit more.
---
They dont have the capacity to track everything, the code wasn't even meant for online tracking.   Why would you assume they can?
---
I'm not saying hes innocent, I'm saying that the possibility exists.  Its called reasonable doubt....doubt created by a lack of good code implementation by Bethesda and other evidence supporting that the implementation was done so poorly.
---
Such a lack of imagination.
---
This is a great roadmap, beyond game saving, this is a marketing miracle
---
No Man's Sky.
---
Dude, yes. I want to RP as a crazy Scotsman!
---
this is what I was thinking.
---
Ok, this is epic. I'm excited for everything on there! 
---
they say a lot of things.
---
Things up for recognizing the reason for the post and understanding the down votes. I wish there were more reasonable people like you on the internet.
---
&gt; If you believed Bethesda
---
Where are my 300 endings Todd?
---
It starts at 2pm EST. I don't know the link, but I'm sure Bethesda's Twitter will plug it when it goes live.
---
Go back to where you got them originally and look very closely.  If they aren't there then change servers.  I don't want to give it a huge spoilers but it's near the robots to the n.
---
This roadmap is very promising.  Makes me hopeful the game will pull a complete 360 like the Division did!  Man that game evolved into one of the best games I ever played
---
nobody gonna missyou :*
---
Is there a SBQ fight going down or is everyone farming WS?  Put a whole bunch of players in one area fighting a whole bunch of things and the loot screen goes into eternal wait state.  
---
I read this as I love you, thank you for eating my rear.
---
If you do buy it remember it is a multiplayer game that you can play solo. You do not have infinite storage so having a vague idea of how you want to play and the mats you need will probably help in the inventory management.
---
And? The point? Do you just like going around saying things with no point?
---
I'm excited
---
It sounds good, but you can come across mass amounts of crappy legendary so they can't make the trade in system to rewarding, or else it would throw off all grinding or the economy of everything else.
---
Will this breathe new life into the game or has there been to much damage done? How will the other fallout/gaming subs react? I doubt cautious optimism. 
---
Skip it, 76 is more important!!! Jk/ good luck bud!
---
If you love FO4, you will love this game, there is a ton of lore, way too boring for me, lots of holotypes and terminals to read if that is your thing,
---
Server only holds 24 - 32 people, you do run into people but only in the common areas, you definitely going to get shot or grieved but there are ways to avoid it, I have played since the beta and only have been bothered a few times in 3 months, it's really a non issue. You learn to avoid people, block them, change servers.
---
yes I think the game is for you, but definitely get it on sale or on craigslist. Don't pay full price. Also get the standard edition, the special editions are not worth it at all.
---
I can view that link at work, can anyone copy paste it?&gt;
---
It doesn't need to be humans; ghouls would be great.
---
Player vending sounds good 
---
I dont even have the time to write a reply to your idiocy....you simple wouldnt comprehend it.
---
Would Appalachia be a place without back woods distilleries?
---
The water park at the top of the map has soot flower, thistle, and blood leaf. With the green perk and super duper I usually get 15-20 disease cures from a single run. 
---
Ok, this is *exactly* what we needed.
---
Honesty. Admitting mistakes. Striving to fix them. A feature roadmap.
---
I'm happy I stayed.
---
Wastelanders sounds quite interesting.
---
The Legendary player feature has my interest!  I'm curious how they plan on handling that. 
---
There was never any game breaking bugs. But yes, there's been numerous patches and hot fixes that have improved the games performance.
---
Coolio.
---
R/takenoutofcontext
---
It’s been in the game for so long it makes me wonder 
---
Either you have never read the ToS for a game or completely fail to understand the legal implications of open ended wording.  Aside from general boilerplate specifics listed in every ToS there is also a large amount of ambiguous and highly generalized phrasing that can be used to 'umbrella' an area in the event of unforseen potential violations.  They are vague intentionally.  Hence why a company can say you violated ToS by 'X' action that isn't specifically listed in the ToS anywhere.  
---
You should try reading them sometime.  For a prime example check out the section involving cheating and harassment.  They are by far two of the most egregious uses of generalized terminology.
---
Thank you for all your hard work dev team!
---
Just like The Division; I'm going to do myself a favor and forget I own this, only to come back in 100 days to the BEST GAME EVER.
---
Time to farm everything. All the EVENTS!
---
I mean I wish my country was one of the ones giving fallout 76 away with thumb grips :( I would def pay 20$ CDN for the game Bethesda :) 
---
melee absolutely does not need a nerf. other weapons should be fun!
---
I run on ultraHDTV from xbox1 Gen 1 with no issues except my xbox Ram overflows and dumps to desktop once a daily after about 8 hours of gameplay...so I would say your system far exceeds my xbox stats.
---
I'm level 173, playing since beta, and I ain't glitched, mines legit.
---
I’m terrified of goat man. I’m so ready for this. 
---
My dreams of being a moonshiner are about to come true.
---
Those were not empty threats and it seems they listened. It's only because of us who constantly kept bethesda on their toes that the game may improve in the future. You're welcome. 
---
But I thought that they only had one dev working in this and it was already abandonware...
---
Still happy I spent full price. 
---
Me too, but I'm not sure they can sell it any more
---
Patrolling the Mojave almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter....AND NOW WE GOT ONE!!!
---
:)
---
Of course, there will be exceptions. I'm level 210 and I've never used the XP glitch but if there are added benefits (every 50 levels(?)) to that supposed update then don't you think that exploit is kinda harmful?
---
Stopping by a Walmart, it's $40.00 for the stand version. I feel comfortable paying that. 
---
What?  Because I expect them to do what they said they would do?  They don't have a good history of keeping their promises so I chose to use their previous behavior when I interpret what they are currently saying.
---
We still don't know anything about that system at all.
---
Maybe it doesn't matter at all if you are lvl 51 or 451 , you turn lvl 1\^2 and the gains are equal.
---
Also, I'm over lvl 150 and I haven't done "XP runs", just played some hours almost each day since I got the game, so I guess that a hardcore non-cheating player can easily be lvl 300+ right now.
---
The XP glitch was never an issue and in my opinion won't be when we can remake our toons as legendaries.
---
I know I'm under your threshold, but I'm lvl 127 and play casually. Totally attainable to get to those levels.
---
Also, anyone has time to hit lvl 50 before that patch hits.
---
Still no manufacturing for settlements. 
---
Disappointing. 
---
I wonder if cold weather will play into it with needing to wear warm stuff.
---
That's what she said
---
Yes. Seems exactly what I needed to calm myself down. 
---
I suppose I agree if they have surefire proof of using exploits. 
---
A guy in my server had a 650 cap bounty, I’ve never seen that before! He spawned in by me and I found out why it was so high, killing anyone and everyone. Lovely.
---
Melee mostly. Yes. I want bloatfly fight become as much as scorchbeast, but with more exp and legendary loot
---
Most people play solo. In fact, apart from the very end quest and some events, the game is mostly meant to be played solo. Even then, it is hard, but not impossible or even impractical to do those events/quests alone.
---
There is very little griefing in this game. The game doesn't let anyone actively hunt you unless you give consent for PvP by shooting bag. However, a new mode is being added to the game where this restriction doesn't apply, and it's meant to be a PvP heavy experience in that mode. But in general, no, with the huge map size and the small number of people per server, you'll hardly meet another player and in 99.9% cases, they are very friendly.
---
&gt; Like the two brothers in F04 who both had terminals at their shop and grew to hate each other, commenting on being able to hear the other eat and resenting them.
---
76 has a very similar quest.
---
Be aware that at present, 76 does have a short main campaign, but a tonne of new quests/events/features were announced today, so that'll change.
---
Unless you plan on playing like 20 hr/day, 76 is a well paced game that'll last you quite a while. 76 has a lot of atmospheric story telling of the type you mentioned, and exploring is hella fun.
---
thank you so very much.  I can see what everyone is so excited about!
---
Yeah you right. My bad.
---
"huh, there gonna add backpacks? well i bet they are ugly"
---
"there gonna add player suggestions, well what about those atom shop items that gave you a hp buff for a week from a month ago?"
---
i can see it now...
---
It's already almost pointless to level up your character after lvl 50/60 when you complete your build and unlock the cards that you need.  
---
If this summer I'll have to reset my character, what's the point of levelling now till the update?  
---
Will I be able to use the points that I'm racking up, and the cards that I've already unlocked, after the upadate?  
---
Thanks for the input
---
This is really great. It shows they absolutely plan to continue supporting and expanding the game in the future, which will make it worth sticking with it for a long time. Bethesda &lt;3. "Our Future Begins!", or something similarly sappy. ;) 
---
How do you see that? I can only see one number?
---
So... WTF is this supposed "Survival Mode"?!? We're already eating forced to eat and drink in the game. They going to pile weather, environmental and temperature effects on top of that (over and above the already-included rad damage for everything)??? IMO, the eating and drinking mechanic in the base game mode is friggin annoying and makes the game un-fun.  
---
Now, if they moved the eating and drinking to survival mode and took it out of the base game mode, I might be tempted to come back and play some more. Right now, I'm still feeling like I wasted $80.
---
Purveyxur
---
Whoops, forgot about Grahm.
---
Our SECOND organic NPC then!
---
Just a few days ago I did get the Disease cure plan for Toxic valley by completing the Protest march event in Grafton. Make of that whatever you will. It's the first of it's kind that I'd ever seen. 
---
Let's hope they freed wooby
---
Oh I quite like the idea of prestige mode and becoming a Legendary Player! After all these years of Fallout finally getting a legendary star next to my name would be a super thrill.
---
900 Hour Guy is gonna miss out.
---
Is anyone still playing this game? 
---
I'm down for some human NPCs in the future.  I'd like to see the world actually evolve a bit over time, and some humans coming in from other vaults/elsewhere would definitely bring a bit of rejuvenation with them.
---
I want their awesome glow in the dark liquid bottle lamp things. My mutie neighbours have me living in the dark ages and refuse to let me power my lights...
---
I've been a big defender of this game since the beta but I fell off playing towards the end of last year only because it was a bit overwhelming playing by myself and the only two people I had to play with gave up the game immediately. But I'm so happy to see this game is still trucking and these updates look awesome! I look forward to picking it back up again in the future.
---
If they can execute this well, AND fix all the bugs - I may just give this game another shot. Hats off to the well designed roadmap, best I've seen in a while
---
Holy fuck they still have plans
---
I'm expecting 76 to do even better. NMs took over 1.5 years to change to the present state. This game has promised some very good looking things within 3-4 months.
---
This is *really* ambitious, naming release dates exactly is interesting and suggests they're ahead of schedule or - if not - I'd just say we probably shouldn't count on those exact release days.
---
I really hope this kind of content gets the coverage all the negativity had done before too.
---
 ⁠Duper appreciated Bethesda's solution of leaving one of every duped item in players inventory. Kept them playing. 
---
Uh, ok? I feel like this is a negative for the rest of the community, not a positive. It's nice that some cheater appreciates Bethesda's approach but I honestly would prefer that dupers who knowingly contributed to crap performance and economy for the rest of us WERE gone. 
---
We're hype we get to share all this with ya! Can't wait to see what you think once you get your hands on everything new this year!
---
Oh I mostly care bout survival mode!!
---
Meh..to be fair this is a road map of DLC...not of when private servers and mods will be available
---
I golded him for you XD Keep being Filthy!
---
The smart vendor in watoga high school....5000 tokens for a miserable piece of gear.   I'm not so hyped but we'll see.
---
&gt; I can't view that link at work, can anyone copy paste it?&gt;
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; please and thank you!!
---
 Not bad. Did 3 yesterday, two ran away. Getting a good pose is difficult though. ;)
---
Are you on PC? If so, would you mind crafting the mod for me?
---
&gt;Ever go to that weird unmarked trailer full of safes that's close to Vault 76?
---
I prefer aligning my safe-opening route with hopping between vendors, so I don't go near V76 that often.. But I do remember the day I was walking around doing nothing specific, just exploring the map.. and stumbled upon a room full of safes! (under a wrecked building at New Appalachian central train-yard)  
---
My eyes watered a bit... :D But, alas, only a few of them could be opened. But at least I scored a Fasnacht mask from one of them! ;)
---
Everything about this announcement is amazing 
---
I hope Purveyor has some sort of lore, since he seems to be a Mole Miner.
---
I mean even if they are, are the servers really this bad? That they can't handle everyday use? there were maybe 10 or 15 people in white spring. If the server can't handle 10 or 15 people playing the game normally in one Central area, what does that tell you about how bad the servers are?
---
Any leads detective? How many clients do you have?
---
The brewing is interesting because it might make adding a package of all the alcohol perks into a build viable.
---
Holy hell this sounds awesome. I'll definitely be back.
---
I actually think this system will make this unnecessary. If there are any benefits to the higher level you are, I would expect there to be heavy diminishing returns. Ex if I’m level 70 maybe I get 3 bonus prestige levels, where someone level 300 gets 7-8 bonus levels. Easy gap to makeup afterwards
---
Me 2 days ago: Yes! New Stash increase! Now I don't have to worry about hitting the limit every day when I horde items!
---
&gt; New Features: Legendary Vendor and Scrapping 
---
Me now: God damn it...
---
Shub-Niggurath, The Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young. Woe betide us all!
---
You and me both, and I'm ready for the hate that I'll get for admitting that.
---
I don't understand this - if you think it doesn't open you to PvP as long as you're holding a workshop, how does someone capture it? What are they supposed to do?
---
It says it'll open you up to PvP and I think people just aren't using their brains on how that's got consequences beyond like the immediate 5 minutes.
---
Me too. A couple of quests in the first patch and some QOL changes like rerolling legendaries and camp decorations. 
---
The two other updates lack enough detail to be too hyped, just yet. 
---
I am hopeful, but sadly a bit skeptical, considering it took 3 months to patch all duping methods (are they even all patched yet?). 
---
I have:
---
12GB DDR4 RAM, intel i7-8750H proccessor,  GTX 1050 Ti laptop
---
and I run everything in ultra that can be set that high.
---
It's sounding like it's kind of cool occasionally running into other people out in the open. Can you just chat with them if you want?
---
Hey this is awesome, but can we add duel wielding so one handed weapons get a boost? :) 
---
http://giant.gfycat.com/GaseousEmotionalAmethystgemclam.gif
---
My expectations were pretty low but HOLY FUCK
---
I would bet that I have a solid 10 hours invested in just server hopping the enclave bunker searching for that elusive second set of calibrated shocks. I've come across two jet packs already but those shocks are my white whale...

---

---
Where have you been? That's the PvP always on server. 
---
There is a point.
---
Bethesda says a lot
---
What they chose to deliver, that is a different story.
---
Not sure, but I'll take it!
---
 Fallout 4 is boring. I put 800+ into it and do know the game. Fallout 76 is cake and my 550 odd hours in it are just the beginning. ;)
---
 All solo, got my 'make a friend' chevo just recently after some 140 levels on 3 chars.
---
Only recently my raido has stopped working, and will go on silent for several minutes at a time and come back whenever it feels, usually mid song.
---
I think it could be written better, but the idea is that if you own a workshop you *will* be subject to PvP, otherwise it'd be impossible for other players to take over (a core mechanic of the workshop system)
---
The workshop system is nice, but it isn't exclusive from the PvP system and I get people don't like griefers but they're not so easily separable. 
---
Heavy guns and Cryo warfare is my tactic. If you have a cryolator shoot her in the air and she slows down so much its kinda funny. Lets you chew her up in the air with your .50 cal.
---
The game runs really well on my 1060 6GB Notebook. It drops a few frames here and there in ultra so I turn it down to High on 1080p and get solid 60. Server related problems may cause stutters at time but it's nothing major (drops to ~50 for a few seconds sometimes). Given your specs, I expect no issues.
---
Really need to wait and see how it works out, it could be somewhere retroactive, like ESO did or it could be a fresh start sort of thing where there is no added benefit to leveling past 50 now.
---
Lucky for you that's in the roadmap.  Although it'll probably only be decorative, not interactable
---
Is this what the collective community of whiners are attacking now? Quit worrying about everyone else and play the game.
---
Can you elaborate on Player V Player Bag? thanks so much man. 
---
God some of you can be so immature or stupid.
---
My thoughts exactly. Damn eh.
---
It seems that 3* shit will be the stuff "scrap", but we still don't know if it just re-rolls that piece, or gives an entirely new piece.
---
There was a nuke drop at Whitesprings last night (around 11:00pm US Eastern time) with about 20 players trying to get stuff.... it was horrible. We couldn't clear out the dead bodies and meat piles fast enough because of the loading. At times, I'd be able to pick up things, but it wouldn't register in my inventory for \~5 minutes, then it would appear.
---
Tried to clear out some junk in my inventory too and it wouldn't show that anything had been dropped. It was pretty bad.
---
We’ve just passed 100 days since the launch of Fallout 76!
---
There’s nothing like the start of something new - for you and for us, and having millions of you join us on this new adventure is humbling for our studio. Thank you for sticking with us as we figure this online experience out together, and we do mean “together.”
---
Thanks to your continuous feedback, we have been able to fix many of the top issues and have made numerous improvements to the game. We also make scores of changes under the hood that aren’t as visible. These include changes to improve performance, detect new exploits, and make the experience smoother for everyone. There’s still work to do, but we’re happy to report that game and server stability has increased over 300% since launch. We’re thrilled by how much everyone is playing, with an average time of 4 hours a day.
---
However, we know the game had a difficult launch, and we’ve made mistakes along the way. We share in your frustrations when we do. We’ll probably make a few more, and when we do, we will work to correct them as quickly as possible. Know that we’re fully dedicated to making this game the best it can be - and even more so, a platform for endless Fallout adventures for years to come.
---
To that end, we’re excited to announce some of the new free content we’ve been working on for Fallout 76 in 2019.
---
Thanks again for sticking with us. It’s a privilege to have such passionate and caring fans. We have big plans for 2019 and we’d love to hear your continued feedback on everything we’re doing. We hope you’ll keep sharing your thoughts with us on the forums, Reddit, in videos, and streams. Your voices push us to do better and your support has meant everything to us. We’ll do our best to earn it.
---
What is there to address?
---
wow you're really bad at this, you're supposed to quote something I said.
---
Dear Diary,
---
Today Bethesda did good.
---
Really glad to see NPCs coming this fall too.
---
I expected the inside to be something special. 
---
What NPC’s are coming? I didn’t read anything about that? 
---
I'm sorry I didn't get your question? Could you please rephrase it?
---
Remember also most trading forums use ultracite ammo as currency because of the 25k max cap limit you can have. So they use ultracite ammo as currency because there isn't a 25k cap on it.
---
Giving people who were suspended, but not banned, some sort of time frame that they can expect to play again. Leaving them twisting in the wind like that doesn't seem to be a good idea.
---
I'm excited but my base is tucked away in the Mire...not sure I'm going to have too many visitors checking out my vending machine
---
This roadmap presents us with some super exciting stuff, and for me, it’s been well worth the wait! I’m most excited for the new quests and storylines, the cryptids, and for the ability to place objects in our C.A.M.P.s as decorations and build vending machines to sell our salvage to others.
---
I’m really interested in seeing what these new factions will be all about, and if there will allow for any new developments to the factions already present in the game. Are their stories done with, or will they have a bearing on what’s to come? I hope I can continue to represent the Responders  moving forward!
---
No way! We've got more awesome (free) crazy things coming for a long time!
---
Where on the road map is "unban this game's biggest fan,"? I must've missed it... :x
---
 Wastelanders, Fall 2019 
---
Embark on a tale with **true choice and consequences** in **Wastelanders** – our biggest and most ambitious update for 76. Wastelanders will include a new main questline, **new factions**, new events, new features and even more surprises. Key words are bolded.
---
&gt;The game doesn't let anyone actively hunt you unless you give consent for PvP by shooting bag
---
This is what I was asking about\^
---
I cannot wait until we get more on the legendary player system. u/Ladydevann, is there anything you can give us on that? I understand you may not know anything but if you do, could we get a hint? And Bethesda, amazing plans. Legendary vendor? Decorating your CAMP with stash items? High level dungeon raids? Just amazing. I literally cannot wait. At level 137 with 240 hours logged so far, i am slowly doing my quests to savor them but now i can knock them out of my quest log. I've stayed with you all from October 23rd of last year and i will be here for years to come. Thank you all for giving me and my husband a game we can play together. It helped rejuvenate our marriage since we both play games but different genres and single player for me. Sitting together killing mutants and ghouls has been great as opposed to sitting beside each other literally in different worlds. 
---
I run a Bloodied Explosive 10mm SMG build. 
---
378 Damage per shot, 30 rounds in the mag, like 7 seconds to shoot the whole mag. 
---
11,370 Damage if they all connect, and they usually do on the Queen. More if I’m sneaking. I literally watch a huge chunk of her life vanish every time I empty a clip. 
---
I found out that after creating my character and then re-editing my character from the menu, I had more options.
---
I could be mistaken but it seemed that way to me.
---
I always keep 10 of each of the flux crafting components in my stash. Hit up Vousdeux tonight if you still need those 5.
---
I'm playing fresh on PC (WIN10 amd ryzen 2600/evga nvidia1060-jan15 driver) at 1080p, and I simply can't enter Charlestone without everything freezing and forcing a shutdown.  I've never used any mods (nor made any mods to any files), did a full reinstall/verify files etc...but I crash almost every single time I enter or get near Charleston.  I tried literally ten times last night to enter Charlestone to do the Motherlode quest...I did manage it...once out of ten attempts.  Please Bethesda try to fix this issue, whether it's an engine issue/processor incompatibility issue or other, please fix :)
---
"To that end, we’re excited to announce some of the new free content we’ve been working on for Fallout 76 in 2019."
---
Mods would fall under free content wouldn't they?
---
There's a shack a little NW of Harper's Ferry that has a bunch of ticks, too.
---
Plant corn, mutfruit and tatos for adhesive. Woo hoo.
---
This is an amazingly fun survival experience in the fallout world. The story is embedded into the environment for those that want it, but there is so so much to do. 
---
Remember the initial fallout 76 game announcement was exciting too. All I'm saying is don't get your hopes up.
---
Its a npc you give him legendaries and you have a chance of getting better ones 
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
TB? I think I prefer radworms. 
---
i need more info on how player vending at our camps will work. will there be a marker on the map for player vending machines? with it drawing in more people, will they still be able to destroy our camps before/during/after checking our vending machine inventory? 
---
How many hours worth of quest content would you say there is? 
---
Yeah, if the server is really have that hard of a time dealing with basic normal use of them, I don't have much hope for this game.... I mean you would think they would be able to fix something like that but we knew going in that the game engine was pretty bad. But seriously. They are having such trouble with the servers. It's like it is just a survival game, and not able to handle the combat
---
Can I not open a controversial topic and not be labeled as a whiner, jesus christ, this subreddit attacks anyone who doesnt share their mentality. I just wanted a discussion, in all fucking fairness and im being heavily downvoted, is that considered whining? 
---
this game is so flawed it hurts
---
I would pile up the Powder Gangers outside of town and set them aflame... to send a message
---
How typical, the link won't load anything but a blackscreen on my device :(
---
  Can someone copypaste ?
---
InFO4 i would switch when cores were at 1%, then sell them. Now that they can't be sold it's annoying.
---
Doesn't exactly say NPCs but I don't think you can have true choice and consequences and new factions without NPCs.
---
This might be my favorite out of everything we're adding. Excited for you to get to try them out in-game!
---
Well a leak said sheepsquatch so I'm guessing that's it.
---
I kill people over level 100 as a level 80 at workshops. 
---
They seek revenge, and I start raking in money. Made 3k last night off two guys at the Ammo factory, plus the normal 1400 vendor a day. 
---
Sorry, but i must say, there is "no endgame" for next x months. I am glad they are working, maybe  it will be really great in next year, but not now.
---
I think it's the instanced loot.  Throw a bunch of players in a tight zone and have heaps of instanced loot (plus world loot) and things get hairy.  
---
It's been this way for a long time, but it wasn't noticed as much previously.  Folks would blame dupers most of the time.  During BETA and the first few weeks you wouldn't have a large congregation of players in one spot farming.  Now it's getting noticed regularly.  
---
I'm sure Beth is working on it as it's been reported.
---
Can't wait for this guy to make his way into the Wasteland!
---
What system ?
---
Join the community over at /r/fo76FilthyCasuals !
---
Yay. I'll probably start playing once the survival mode comes out. I got bored around level 10 last time :(
---
Depends on the injury.  I lost a few discs in a chopper crash and was discharged.  Occasionally I have a 2 or 3 month period where I can barely walk, rarely sleep and desperately look for distraction while I heal up enough muscle mass to get back at life.  So it is possible.  Whether he is a dirty dirty cheater I have no clue.
---
Okay, I'll install F76 one more time.
---
Well. Have you played an MMO before? Like wow or guild wars or something?  It flows similar to that.
---
Hard content like the main quest chain is pretty small, but it’s just there to flesh out the rest of the game for the player.
---
I did get pretty invested in the story though so there’s that.
---
bah,  bad smell and annoying smoke.
---
more entertaining to put bottle cap mines in their pockets
---
I have no idea what it means. Explain?
---
This! Only I'd prefer the default to yield. If I'm not sitting at the workshop, I'm not going to drop everything to go defend, nor do I want some rando fast traveling to me to 1-shot me if I missed the notification. Or, they could tie the default to your pacifist setting. If you have pacifist enabled, default is yield. Otherwise it defaults to defend. 
---
Looks like all good things ahead!
---
Correct! Jessica and I will be live on the Bethesda Twitch and Mixer channels. I will post a tweet after our roadmap announcement has some time to breath.
---
Wow..I thought i could find support, instead i only read about people who enjoy west has happened to me..
---
I never dupe items..
---
I haven't, but I know roughly how they work. That's good then! I heard very bad things about the story, considering that it's told through audio logs, but I'm sure they're still good. 
---
Oh god I completely feel you. It's even more galling that they think they're the good guys when they're the stereotypical villains who think they're heroes.
---
They're Handsome Jack in Fallout form.
---
Diluted maybe? 
---
Based on how the game has unfolded so far, having a faction of NPC's "invade" Appalachia sounds like it could be a really good addition to the game.
---
Reddit isn't a good gauge for all players, so not sure the amount of posts means anything.
---
Anyway, from everything we know about the ban wave is that it is based on item counts. So it really doesn't make sense that it is 10x the size of the item purge.
---
Anecdotally you can say 10x but without numbers from Bethesda there is no way to know, even remotely.
---
Oof, I’m sorry about that. Mine is right next to the overseer’s, so...I should stay pretty busy. 
---
I got you fam...
---
**FALLOUT 76 - 100 DAYS, ROADMAP FOR 2019**
---
**WILD APPALACHIA**
---
**NUCLEAR WINTER**
---
**WASTELANDERS**
---
Alrighty! I should be on tonight and all weekend. Give you some plans and stuff I don't need! GT JaggersLips13
---
amazing. the true hero we deserve
---
Okay, not gonna lie. This all looks amazing!!! Neber thought I'd want 2019 to go so fast!!!
---
 " *some* of the new free content", mod support is one thing, but aren't most mods made by players? Therefore it would be up to modders to release mods once support becomes available, let them get the game as stable as possible with their new planned assets before adding 3rd party tinkering/assets. 
---
you can’t make a post like this and then not post your gamertag. 
---
I came upon a workshop I wanted, but there was a concrete barrier in the way and I couldn't break it or anything. The guy had left the server so it belonged to no one and no one could get to it without a jetpack
---
LOL. That's all you can do? That's the best? 
---
You are stupid. You are a moron. And more so, you have a really shitty life. 
---
Sorry, I'm on PS4.
---
Yes, you should go for it. I play 76 on PS4 and it runs pretty smoothly. In fact, I barely encounter any glitches at all during my play sessions
---
OCDecorator is becoming official? Hell yeah. 
---
This is fantastic news, it truly is.
---
I still find disappointment in the fact that quests remain bugged since beta and have yet to be addressed. The fact that there is no method for the development team or their game masters (if they even exist) to correct issues in game makes no sense in the grand scheme of "we'll support this game for as long as you play it". 
---
Feel free to call this an MMO-light if you want, but this is a game where we can't fix quest issues like previous Bethesda games. Above all else...this should be the priority of the dev team to allow actual, in-game customer support.
---
Yeah wasn't that teased by them a short while back, or was that just me confusing datamines with Bethesda announcements?
---
let's be honest for a minute now, I have 5 strength and no melee perks are my fire axe absolutely wrecks everything. So perhaps I should be saying 2 handed and unarmed Melee is super powerful. I'd love to see one handed and ranged weapons get a buff but i'm not hopeful. In a perfect world Bethesda would just buff my personal collection of radiums but i do agree, that would be a little unfair!
---
Twisting in the wind is fine with me, they tied their own noose and threw it over the branch.  Bethesda may have kicked the chair out but they aren't under any obligation to let you down.

Ever since the patch that normalized vendor loot lists I've seen them everytime I visit the trader by Top of the World. Not the train station but the bot inside one of the nearby buildings. You have to enter a room, go up the broken ramp then down some stairs to find the bot.
---
See, it's garbage like that that makes people dislike you children. Grow up.
---
NPCS ARE CUMING!
---
"HOLY SHIT"
---
- Me at my cubicle reading the road ahead.  Well done Bethesda!!
---
NPC literally means
---
Non
---
Playable
---
Characters.....
---
NPCs are here¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Robots,muties,scorched,Mole miners, wildlife 
---
ALL NPCS!!!
---
Oh I'm sure it was, very punny that way!
---
Wastelander”S”
---
We'll go into a bit more information on the legendary player system as we get closer to it. Glad to hear you and your husband love the game and enjoy playing together! I can't wait for you to experience all the new features!
---
Looks impressive.   Here's hoping this won't get twisted by the usual youtube outrage tribesfolk.
---
that's an effect I haven't really used or experimented with much, do you get a lot of healing from it? Is it a bit of health per hit or a general regeneration of health?
---
You know, seeing that gives me hope that we might see some non-robot NPCs some day. I doubt they'll ever use humans, since they really want us to be the only people in the world, but having non-feral ghouls, friendly super mutants, or whatever else the cook up could do a lot to help the world feel more alive. 
---
This looks absolutely brilliant, can't wait to see this stuff in the game. Love the ideas of Vault Raids, legendary vendors, merit badges, all that stuff. Thank you thank you thank you
---
Test for people on mobile or can't access the page for whatever reason:
---
Is level 6 Scorched wanderer a Character?
---
Go try turning some tricks to feed your kids. There are much worse things people can do in life to earn money.
---
You can voice chat (I have never tried) or just use emotes.
---
*everywhere*
---
Like the Bethesda devs then?
---
Please... PLEASE send me pictures of this when you do.
---
I’m so beyond excited. Ive desperately wanted a reason to pick up the game and it seems like I dont have too long to wait... bless
---
next time wear a set of IRL unyielding armour :D
---
Fingers crossed it includes a Bobblehead Stand. That would be awesome.
---
Any chance we can get this in text format for those of us who can't access that site at work? I'm curious to know what all of the planned changes are.
---
Unlike you, I do not need to resort to ad hominem attacks when my weak ass arguments hold no water.
---
You really need to work on yourself if you think this is a healthy way to talk to people.  
---
You should just stick to talking to your filthy casual friends, you lack the maturity to talk to people that disagree with you.
---
Kick ass, glad they're doing this right.  That vender where you can trade in legendaries sound intriguing.  
---
&gt;With that same dumb thought process it ok to walk by an unattended money truck in RL and steal a bag of money. You know, because it is in the world and I am able to.
---
First of all I'm sure you haven't played an MMORPG since this is the first thing players look for after a new patch. 
---
Possible exploits to gain benefits. Fallout 76 can be called an MMORPG and the inability to act and fix bugs just shows how this massive company got too cocky and tried to swallow a way much bigger bite. 
---
Your comparison with the money truck is ridiculous since we are talking about a VIDEO GAME where you are supposed to do whatever you want as long as it's possible in game.
---
A lot of older games had cheats that were meant for fun and in single player games, who fucking cares.  Yes I cheated in Star Wars Shadows of the Empire for N64.  Why?  I wanted to be a fucking wampa.  Wouldn't you?
---
A new game mode, high level vaults, a second main quest line. This honesty looks fucking amazing.
---
I have a feeling we might be seeing NPC’s sooner than we thought :] 
---
Thank you for the response! I figured as much but ya can't blame me for trying. A big thanks to you and the other community managers. I cannot begin to imagine how you do it. I manage a restaurant and that is difficult enough. The anger doesn't get so severe there. We truly do love the game though. Have since the 1st time I logged in even though i was skeptical of the multiplayer. Anyway. Thanks again! Hopefully it will be an easier weekend for you now.
---
I wonder if it will give extra weight or if it will work as a mobile work bench 
---
Looking real good. Finally Backpacks
---
I hope we don't have to pay for all this new $tuff lol .. Roadmap to micro-transaction land!
---
I'm most of mine via Pharma Farma, I tend to search every medical type container I pass, including medicine cabinets in bathrooms.
---
I know people have other methods, but that's mine. I also have the healing factor mutation, so I use Stimpaks less often.
---
They just needed money..and time.
---
Fucking A. GG Bethesda, gg.
---
So fair enough on that front. Except that none of that sounds like somebody that was just casually playing the game for 900 hours. Wouldn’t two accounts be running two computers at the same time? He liked the game so much he bought two copies. That just makes this whole thing sound more suspect to me.
---
Initially I didn't but after going through a ton of terminals and locks, you can do without both.  Not enough things of value, just makes a few quests go faster.
---
Well I am running around in raider PA with a Int 1 character so it kinda fits.....
---
[https://imgur.com/a/dgN1C4Q](https://imgur.com/a/dgN1C4Q)
---
A roadmap to what's planned is only good if it's followed and implemented properly.  I have high Hope's that eventually the game will be stable and have actual end game content, but until it does I'm hesitant. 
---
Blind faith wont get you anywhere, if they get it right then awesome, but it's a wait and see thing not a oh the roadmap means the game is fixed thing.
---
5 years after skyrim released, I was STILL finding new dungeons and places I had not seen before. This even happened in FO4, but to a lesser extent (+ mods).  I can't say that about 76. I think I've seen everything and done everything. I don't really see a need to keep grinding for various weapons because there just isn't anything to do. 
---
 I got so bored I deleted all my characters and started over, but haven't played it since. Dunno why really, just don't feel like playing it anymore right now. Think I've got somewhere around 100 hours myself. I also don't fuck around when playing and have an objective/mission to do all the time, so yes it's possible to see and do everything in less than 100 hours in this game. 
---
I wish to have the kind of pleasure Monica had too
---
Old-skool MMO term, from back in the Everquest days where you would camp a rare mob's spawn for so long you'd have to poop into a sock because if you get up, you might miss it. 
---
The enclave medical vendor sometimes carries the recipe.
---
Killing enemies
---
Looting 
---
I’m always low on Stimpaks though man, which is why I dilute the fuck out of them if I get any. 
---
Looking forward to it ! Cheers !
---
Let's wait and see how it turns out.
---
oink
---
Pressing x to doubt. 
---
A boring 800 hours? I am guessing that if you put 800 hours into it, you had to have been having a few hundred hours of fun... No?
---
Average playtime: 4 hours per day.
---
I dunno about you guys, but that's a hell of an average playtime.
---
kill some ticks, harvest their blood with more meat perk, craft stims with chemist+super duper. It's about 35 diluted stims from 2 tick blood
---
I did this in fo4 lol
---
Stealth is not a option with my Power Armour.... [https://imgur.com/a/dgN1C4Q](https://imgur.com/a/dgN1C4Q) But that would be a dope mechanic to prime them....
---
Nope, though both right down.
---
If this makes sense, it has both numbers like this
---
HP 50%
---
HP 29%
---
It used to say XX% and be over a Timer looking thing didn't it?
---
I wait till I have 5 or more of a treasure map then dig them up, there is an occasional new plan otherwise its junk.
---
I’m honestly hyped for Goat Man. 
---
"Supposed" 
---
Why do you guys always try to enforce an ediquette? 
---
Its really strange to me. I play by the rules of the game. Thats it. If i can do it, its legal. 
---
Really odd that the pve crowd tries to take the 1 pvp mechanic in the game and enforce a strange set of rules that dont exist.  If the game lets me kill you, ima kill you. It's simple really. No hard feelings on my end. You guys are weird and oddly hostile in chat about dying in game. You have all the tools to not die. It isnt griefing at all imo.  Just have fun and seek revenge
---
All it took is effort and a relization of what a mistake it was to not have many of em xD.
---
Eh, that sounds over powered.... LETS DO IT!!!!
---
Indeed good sir!
---
Charisma perk - Wasteland Vendor 
---
Opens an ICON up on MAP showing the exact location of the player-based vendor. 
---
I liked being able to re-calibrate in The Division. 
---
I think you should have to at least find the legendary version “in the wild” first and then recalibrate one of the modifiers and/or increase a star. At least at first. 
---
I want the best of everything, but once I get it I know I’ll lose interest. I need a reason to keep improving. If it’s a grind for caps and flux and then ultimately getting everything I want, then I think I’d be happy for a bit and then start to lose the drive to keep playing. Maybe shifting METAs will alleviate the stagnation. 
---
Omg yes 
---
Get it! I just started getting into it a few weeks ago and I love it on the PS4. At the end of the day it is still a Fallout game (which is great) and it looks like they have a lot of good things planned in the future. 
---
Haha no it would not be! Cant wait to make my own mountain honey lol
---
Think eso. You can influence small enounters , who dies ect as long as it doesnt fundamentally change the future for the games. Without even a clear knowing of how WV is like in 200 years anything works. Also could experiment with inatances for players who took different routes.
---
Let us know what you think!
---
Why are you here? 
---
I’m so excited to hear about all you have planned for the game.  I’ll be honest and say that there have been issues.  For me none were game breaking and I have not experienced anything that made the game unplayable... just really annoying.  In spite of all that I have had more fun playing FO76 than any of the previous games (I’ve been playing since FO3).   I think you guys did a couple of things really right in this one ... 1) coop play is fantastic (I don’t play PVP so I can’t comment on that aspect) ... my son and I are both fans of the franchise and to be able to play together (especially since he’s away at college) has been tremendous... 2) the story lines are really rich and interesting ... they make me want to read every note and hack every terminal ... I thought the lack of biological NPCs was going to be a problem and it was a little hard to get used to at first but now I find that it adds this really cool and delightfully creepy aspect to the story.... 3) there’s lots to do ... I’ve pretty much run through the entire quest arc(s) twice now and I’m still finding fun things to do whether it’s hitting a good ghoul spawn in white springs or a nuked zone or hunting for treasure using the treasure maps I’ve found... it even just grinding for plans and mats to make stuff ...it’s really kept me engaged.  Having said that I will add that I can’t wait for the first big DLC though!
---
Keep it up Bethesda your doing great things... don’t let the bitchfest the elitists are having get you down!!!
---
Cheers!
---
Woody
---
Yep, I'm happy with that. Colour me excited!
---
So I have a clean install of the game (no mods) and atomic shop items are invisible/fail to load in game. I have tried adding the Custom ini, still no luck. 
---
Honstely there isn't enough information to side one way or the other.  100,000 ultracite ammo is very easily doable in 30 days though.  Less than 500 crafts would get you .50 or 5mm.
---
I have two but I haven’t logged in for a few weeks and don’t remember which ones. I’ll gladly sell them. What’s fair?
---
'Early struggles'? Why is releasing an incomplete product at all acceptable? 
---
Not trying to be rude but I really don't understand that train or thought.
---
I love you all, Bethesda. All I ever wanted was to be a moonshiner, and you're giving me that and so much more.
---
You're gonna have to put on that veil one way or another, you should be able to own it.
---
 I meant it got boring and now its not fun. Its the first good Fallout shooter and I played it a lot but there's only so much there. 
---
 Yes. I meant its boring now. I'm not complaining but Fallout 76 is head and shoulder above it.
---
Just collect corn, tatos, and mut fruit. Plant the same amount of each, then build a few water purifiers , use the cooking crafting station , last option is utility. Make vegetable starch then scrap it. Eventually you will have so much you'll end up selling bulk adhesive to vendors.
---
I rarely use Stims since I got the Healing Factor Mutation and the Ghoulish Perk. It's amazing how fast your supply builds when you aren't burning through them
---
I think it means we can finally use junk items as decorations, as long as they are in our stash box.
---
Awesome, can't wait!
---
So... you just wanted a completely different game then? 
---
My advice is give it a chance, I have played all the other fallouts and loved them. This game did not do it for me till around lvl 20 or 25, I mean I wanted to like it more than I did. The game has small issues from time to time, they fix some and are working on others. Over all I enjoy playing the game and look forward to new content in the future. Short answer.....if you like any of the other fall out games this game is for you.
---
Yeah. This roadmap, while late, was a complete win.
---
Why would he be transferring ammo to his alt. Let’s say he had a bloodied TSE combat rifle with ultracite mod then sure he might want a fuck tone of ultracite ammo but that doesn’t expect by his alt and 100,000 5mm ammo or why he was trading it between his alts. 
---
Tell em!
---
Simple, if you want a character to be able to pick locks/hack, then keep the perk cards equipped. You don't have to, but the annoyance of swapping the cards is to keep people from ignoring character builds that are not solely focused on combat.
---
I mean I think it’s kind of implied that the Wastelanders expansion might actually be adding bumans, thumbnail is an opening vault, says there’ll actually be some degree of player choice, new factions...
---
Yup we bought the Early Access version for full price. 
---
A virtue that most millennials did not aquire, not that its thier fault.
---
Are there any .ba2 files in your data folder that dont start with fallout 76?
---
Twice most likely
---
Is it out yet? No one knows 
---
Mole miner version of a non-feral ghoul maybe?
---
I'm not trespassing am I, officer?  I'm on my chair watching all of this positivity transpire, not bothering anyone, I may not be involved in all this but don't I have the right to view on from the distance? 
---
Awesome!  With the way they are now more manageable with that sonic scream I'll try this out today.   Thanks!
---
I just got the game a few days ago and I feel like I made the right decision. The community and the devs seem to be all together on this and that is amazing.
---
Future update notes
---
What a great day! Good luck on your presentation then celebrate with some gameplay!
---
Means you can display teddy bears, nuka bottles and other stuff like you could in fo4 and not be dealing with baggies you take it out of your inventory and drop it
---
sorry to go offtopic here, but there's a big issue with SPECIAL usefulness. End-game equipment is all about legendaries, which means luck is extremely important due to it boosting loot condition, and intelligence is useless because its crafting bonus only applies to crafted stuff, legendary equipment not being crafted
---
Maybe zone based like the verdant seasons.
---
90% reduced weight just got even better!
---
Wow. I wonder how could any of this go wrong??
---
Bravo, another childish response. Thank you for proving me right.
---
The game haters are cringing in their dirty smelly holes trying to come up with ways to attack this. 
---
LOL what a bunch of losers.
---
Right?! I was thinking that this would be "and this is what we're thinking about maybe probably doing soon-ish" but nooooooo it's way more than that. I love it. 
---
Could be! I really hope he sheds some light on what the mole miners whole deal is. Why they hate humans so much, if they’re actually intelligent...
---
You’re right, that is incredibly important.
---
I would rather they thoroughly test everything for bugs and wait another week/month than update in March and have a bugged up time.
---
thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Got ya. I can definitely understand the argument that it can't hold a candle to FO4. But still, if you got maybe... 400 hours of fun, let's say, isn't it still well worth a buy at $40? And the roadmap that just came out looks VERY promising.
---
nice thank you!!!!
---
Yep, now that I'm pretty well established and I don't really need anything specific containers are largely skipped.  I mostly just collect chems to sell to vendors but if it's locked, I no longer bother.
---
That was touching, not gonna lie
---
Funny, same thing happens with bolt action pipe weapons - pistol and rifle perks both apply, and since they're in Perc / Agi trees, makes for a real nice sniper build.
---
Can confirm. 
---
Well, now we have another way to get rid of all that legendary wood armor besides just dumping it in the woods
---
As a programmer myself I'm sure that there's not much they can do to change it. It's definitely the game engine
---
&gt; My Bloodied deathclaw gauntlet does around almost almost 2k per swing. And I can swing it almost 3 times per second.
---
Three times per second? Wow! How did you get your rez/respawn animation so fast?
---
Too soon.
---
Pls set up test servers. Look at the positive outpouring on this post. Please let us help you. Pls somehow figure out test servers so we can help you with feedback and QA in real time before it launches on live servers!! Please!
---
give that the only information we have says that people over 50 can prestige and start from level 1 I would hazard a guess that they will only prestige once.
---
&gt; how about that big mountain man beard? 
---
My female stealth sniper wants this so bad. 
---
Appalachia belongs to the true Americans of west Virginia 
---
This could make me consider reinstalling. 
---
Nice work, Bethesda.
---
Ah. Well, I’ll be avoiding that like the plague.
---
/r/MurderedByWords 
---
To be fair every single player I played with knowingly has duped items.  I avoided trading like the plague and might have aquired duped ammo (only use .308) but have no way to know.  Maybe the ammo trickled down to a buddy who took my 5.56 for his .308 and some had been duped (the .308 I mean).  
---
Generalizations about having duped items, were they trackable, could very well lead to every single player in the game who has every traded or looted anything.  There isn't even a way to gauge whether it is probable or not.
---
That is to say that duping has so permeated FO76 that we could all be guilty of having duped items.  Just trading with another player and having heard about duping means you are suspect.  Crazy shit right?
---
The all start with “SeventySix - “
---
I believe it's going to be similar to Rangarok Online
---
Same...lmao
---
I’d love to learn more about the Mole Miners and have a small faction of non-hostile ones to interact with, if even in a limited fashion.
---
How do they do it in that game?
---
Lord forbid they actually make the servers playable
---
I normally have to sell mine to vendors because I have too many 
---
Thank you. That was...
---
Expectedly vague.
---
 You are doing it wrong. ;) i kill a few every day,its what my guy does but for that quest LOL: Hide in elevator, let her majesty take care of the bots, she hates them and wait. You will have to shoot the ones that open the door but that's it. I did it at level 26 on my Crafter Jenny Jones.
---
 I seldom have problems with that kind of thing but I am on a healthy PC.
---
The 'Survival Mode' is new the PvP mode they've been talking about.
---
I'm using a bloodied explosive harpoon gun, can do 1200-2000 damage per shot depending on if I have nerd rage up and if I'm starving (stupid adrenal bug). When I shoot her... nothing happens. I find my two shot gatling gun with no other legendary effects to be better overall dps. This is even with the fleschette (shotgun) mod on it and from point blank, in the head. I've even gotten off sneak attacks with this... just doesn't feel like I'm doing anything.
---
I’m REALLY curious to hear about this new main quest. Just by the wording I’m imagining it’ll replace the one already out. Either way I’m (cautiously) excited and happy that Bethesda sounds like they’re working on their mistakes.
---
I've had similar issues before, like infinite loading
---
here you go

---
You are the problem.. If you get upset when we take your shop and kill you. Thats on you. Youre ignoring the mechanics and expecting something thats unrealistic. If you die and move along like gentlemen, good for you, thats fine. 
---
Workshops are the 1 pvp mechanic we have. Its a big flag that says hey i like to fight players. 
---
Please dont get upset when we gank you for owning Grafton. Its a risk you are aware of. And we arent doing anything wrong or breaking any rules. 
---
Probably one to start everyone on the same playing field again. But thats just a guess
---
Now this is what you call a road map. Dice should take notes for BFV.
---
I don't like the idea of camp vendor's, and would rather have a centralized location. 
---
My bet is we will start to see some location agreed upon by the players as the one place for serious sellers to all set up camp at.  Probably somewhere like the golf course. 
---
Right.  That is more efficient.  I'm saying not everyone does it like that even if I agree with you it would be more efficient.  Many guilds I've belonged to there was one person in charge of allocating resources.  Efficient or not, that's how it was.  Also don't underestimate how many hours some people are playing a game per day.  Some are available almost non-stop.
---
Ah, a fellow Filthy Casual, I greet you humbly good sir.
---
Thats just the name of the update. It could still be just one guy, with the mentioned wastelanders being the players.
---
I did now!!!! xD
---
You can get a pie each day on the roof of west tek.
---
I mean, yeah....
---
right...after they release a comprehensive roadmap
---
man you are really stretching to get your hate out, i kinda feel sorry for ya
---
I wonder if decorating with items from your stash includes placing power armor chassis's *crosses fingers*
---
I don't know.  Something about the Wastelanders section for the fall seems to indicate 'surprises.'
---
Here's hoping.
---
Why do you follow it then? That's the point of that sub...
---
Question for Bethesda....if I "prestige" will my quest line start all over again???...myself I would love this!!!!
---
They had a rebirth system which allowed you to start over at lvl1 but gave you some extra stat points. It also unlocked rebirth classes and super novice.
---
I think it does help to post here! Many others read these posts. THERE ARE DOZENS OF US!!!
---
The weapons are good, the problem is they break really fast and can be costly to repair.
---
For example:
---
https://youtu.be/xya6lq7hHCM
---
He chews through enemies like they're paper mache, but it breaks every 20 seconds.
---
once you reach level 99 I think, you get to restart from level 1 and have access to "reborn" classes which are stronger versions of your old classes. so if you were an assassin you becomes an assassin cross.
---
this is a one time thing, though.
---
Please tell me Nuclear Winter is a hardcore mode
---
this is awesome!!!  I had high hopes that DLC's would release in March just based on how Fo4 rolled out.    every single bullet point is amazing!    a backpack system?  Vault Raids?  Legendary vendor?   LEGENDARY PLAYERS!!!!!!!!!!
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
There is too much working against them in general as far as the game goes. Firstly, they damage output is nowhere near ballistics. If they are killing you with energy weapons, it's simply because they have Legendary effects on it, and they're using perk cards to synergize with it. But for the most part, Energy weapons are really only useful in PvE, because every competent PvPer will realize the value in mutations. And from there, you will see there are literally 2 mutations that will reduce the living shit out of energy damage. So on top of having shittier damage, they also have 2 mutations working against them in PvP. And this is the reason why ppl don't use it, and the ppl killing you are probably taking advantage of your lack of equipment to stop them.
---
 Its better than Fallout4, way better. I dunno how you got it backwards.
---
 I have 550 hours or so and the game is just starting for me.
---
You dropped this \

4.  Yep.  I had a buddy that wanted to show off some legendary items... Opened trade and found some 90K of nearly every TSE combination and weapon type in the game and 20k of each armor.  Thing is, he didn't dupe them.  They were 'extra's being given out by a duper aquaintence.  2 million lbs of 'extras'.  Dafuq is right.
---
I think my heart just stopped with all this content being announced. Someone bring me a defibrillator!
---
That’s why I have my expectations set as low as possible, keeps me from getting too disappointed
---
IMO, the road map looks great, speaking as a player who socketed in like 80 hours and took a break for other games, but was definitely coming back (as I have with all past Fallouts).  Was looking for a road map like this to see when would be a good time, spoiled for choices.
---
My one quibble, though, is the Vault Raids.  I'm a solo player by choice.  I got burnt out on group content by playing WoW for way too long.  I really LIKE the online nature of Fallout 76, and the events system that lets me jump into some group content without organizing it, but Vault Raids sound like dungeons in MMOs; get your team together and clear 'em.  I'd like to entreat devs to ensure they're soloable.  Make 'em hard; I'm not expecting anything easier than nuclear launch bunkers, which are definitely soloable even if arguably meant for a group.  But let us solo players have a shot.  Seeing content launch and knowing you'll likely never see it because it requires organized group play and you don't want that; not a good feeling.
---
Holy f... and it all start's on the 12th of march, same day as my birthday, best birthday present i have had in years :)
---
Thank You Bethesda!!!
---
Pharma Farma and I now craft my own. I've never been so happy to find ticks, lol.

Well, the email sent out did say the suspensions were "final" and "no appeals will be considered" so that may be why. I know a ticket isn't an appeal, but they may be treating it the same. 
---
I would love to see perks where you get a bonus for not being mutated
---
Yeah I’m not listening to that lol
---
Considering Bethesda's precedents, their anti-cheating system may have problems too xD
---
Had good results with my AA Gatling Laser. Paired with a cryo weapon to slow her down its effective. Gunsmith 5 allows a 200% Gatling laser to last until she’s about 30-40% after regen. Take over a power plant to regain the 5 or 6 fusion cores you use. I also didn’t have a build for it, just a regular roaming build
---
One thing I was looking for in today’s post is whether we will get a patch to fix adrenal reaction or if working to remove it and reapply it is the only fix. Now I’ll definitely do it if I have to but I’d prefer to wait for a patch if that’s an option. This isn’t meant to bash anyone and complain about the situation, I’m just looking for a little clarity on that so I know whether to go stand on some barrels. 
---
Thanks for this amazing roadmap, it’s truly incredible what we have coming. 
---
More like finding out that if you fill in the test bubbles with a number 3 pencil instead of a 2 you get a perfect score.
---
Some interesting stuff, happy to see new content and interested to see  how these new systems play out.  
---
Legendary vendor to trade/swap out shitty legendarys is interesting though I really hope it's not just a shitty "slot machine" kind of deal where you just wind up trading one trach legendary for a random new one.  
---
The "Legendary Character" system will also be interesting.  Will we "reroll" at level 1 but with some new ability?  can we reroll multiple times?  Is there a cap to the # of these new legendary abilities?  Will you get better or more legendary abilities if you reroll say, a level 200 as opposed to a level 60?
---
now that the stakes are getting higher, how about a system to retrieve lost items? I lost items in 3 different occasions.
---
would be devastating to lose event-exclusive items like the masks.
---
Good bot 
---
Typical asshole kind of response. 
---
To be fair, people on the internet are morons.
---
Surprised more people aren’t talking about “wastelanders”.  Does this mean Bethesda have changed their mind on the whole “no npcs” thing?
---
If you love FO4, you may not love this game!
---
It depends what aspects of FO4 appealed to you.   76 has a good open world to explore and lots of killing to do.
---
What it *doesn’t* have includes:-
---
1. Appealing stories delivered by appealing companions such as Cait, Curie, Piper, Nick Valentine etc.   I really miss them.
---
2. The ability to take a game save you can return to.   I love experimenting with approaches to creating my own fun.  Here’s an example.   In FO4, I used to lay down extensive minefields and come back to them once the Raiders or whatever were spawning, and set about choreographing their demise.   If I got the mine spacing wrong, and they all blew up prematurely, I’d try again from the previous save.    That was great fun.   Incidentally, if you lay a minefield in FO76 it won’t be there next time you log in.
---
3.  There’s no difficulty setting in FO76.   If you’re not in the mood to do intensive battle, but you’d just like to explore a “hard part of the map”, then you’re out of luck.   And the converse is also true.
---
4. FO76 relies heavily on its game mechanics.   Right now, for example, there’s a notice as you log in that for the next few days, there’s an increased chance of encountering a Mothman.  When you earn perks, you don’t get them permanently.  Well, you do, but you can only have a subset of perks equipped at a time.  So you might find yourself having to swap out a perk which improves your defensive or offensive capabilities for one which boosts your lockpicking skills.
---
5.  There’s no “pause” mechanism”.  So if you’re picking the lock I mentioned in 4 above, you may find an enemy sneaks up behind you and kills you because your defenses are down.   Or if you plan a coffee break, you’d better find a safe place first.  If the phone rings, then it’s a dilemma.
---
6. If you stop interacting with the game for longer than a certain period of time, you’ll be forcibly logged out of the game.   This process too often results in losing resources
---
7.  The “economy” is brutal.   Just keeping yourself fed and watered and your equipment maintained is a never-ending chore.  It’s part of point 4 above, the game being obsessed with its own mechanics 
---
8. There’s no branching dialog
---
To finish on a positive note, to some degree I enjoy cooperative play with a real life friend.  The downside of cooperative play is that if you pick up a quest-providing holotape, or go to a robot vendor, it’ll talk over the top of your friend’s voice
---
For some context, I’m on PS4 Pro, level 46.   My friend is near level 200 and has helped me to accelerate my gains in XP.  He is happy going through the repetitive process of killing the bad guys in an area for XP and their loot, and coming back later when they’ve respawned and doing it all over again. 
---
Here’s a typical scenario.   I need fusion cores for my power armor, so he tells me to follow him to where power armor mechanically spawns regularly.  We get there and if I’m lucky, it’ll be there with a free fusion core.  That’s if some other player hasn’t recently farmed it for themselves.
---
To be brutal, FO76 is like FO4 without memorable, compelling story lines but with tedium added.  I’ll be done with it when “Dreams” early access comes out.
---
No one cares whether or not you duped personally. If you had 100,000 plus of an item in a 30 day period you probably were taking advantage of duping in some way. It may be that you acted as a mule for a friend who duped (get better friends) or randomly picked up paper bags with stacks of ammo / cola / legendaries (use better judgment). The main point is that you need to use this time off to figure out if this game is still worth it for you and what you need to change so that this temp ban doesn't become a permanent one. Good luck and I hope you figure out how to have fun in the game without coming down on the wrong side of Bethesda's future bannings.
---
I can already imagine what the game bashers are going to say, to try and keep the hate going.
---
\#1 thing. This all should have been in the game from the start. Well, please loan Bethesda your time machine so they can take the code back in time. Oh you don't have a time machine? Then shut up. 
---
\#2. Fix all the broken shit first. Wait, weren't you just complaining that you wanted new stuff? Which is it? Fix first or new stuff first? How about you stop changing the target?
---
\#3. That's hardly a road map. Too vague! We deserve very specific details! Tell us all now exactly what that all means! Why? You have shown you can't really handle to much information. We don't want you to have a brain fart and die.
---
Other thoughts?
---
&gt;"New Feature: Legendary Players – An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities."
---
Does that mean if you kill a legendary player in PvP they drop a 3 star explosive two-shot lead pipe with +10% damage to mirelurks?
---
Same.  Still no reason to trade with anyone as all the people I played with still have one of every 'best' weapon and armor piece.  Sigh.  Most of them quit or were banned anyway.
---
Where the fuck are private servers?
---
I hear you, helping my own wife craft her X-01 and outfitting it with a jetpack + marsupial to match my own has been a gamechanging experience for both of us. Sick of an area or just plain don't want to deal with it? Up, up and away we go, hopping rooftop to rooftop!
---
Google "Celtic Calling" in Charleston WV.  There's a huge Scotch-Irish population here.  It totally fits in with the setting in WV, and pretend I said a lot of other very persuasive words in this sentence.
---
I picked up an all rise from a scorched the other day. Not sure how. I guess someone dropped it? I didn't know they could loot bags. Too bad is was a level 35 :(
---
Weirdly gender specific lol
---
It's already almost pointless to level up your character after lvl 50/60  when you complete your build and unlock the cards that you need.  
---
Will I be able to use the points that I'm racking up, and the cards that I've already unlocked, after the upadate? 
---
Skunk ape.  Actual wv critter.
---
Just because the drops are 40 or under doesn't mean they are garbage to level 65+. I am 123 and use a level 40 3* death claw gauntlet. But I also only do UF if no one else is there.
---
Blanket bans have a lot of collateral damage. I think it's pretty rare to issue bans like that nowadays. But yea for sure the quantities in question are impossible to achieve without dupe exploits then I could see your point.
---
I wish they made it easier to do, instead of.having to use a second person to facilitate it.
---
Same.  The Civil War dress too.
---
Fuck all the haters 
---
Well, they said they are looking to extend pacifist mode to your camp, so people can't destroy it. 
---
So I expect a lot more people using that setting so their camps can't get destroyed when vending is here. 
---
Looks like I’m reinstalling lol. This looks amazing.
---
Now I have a purpose to get on the 161, must have all bears!
---
You're in the wrong sub bro.
---
That guy is a cheater. Fuck him
---
Vault raids sound cool as fuck. Guess it’s time to go level a character so I’ll be able to take part when they’re out.
---
I buy blood packs whenever I see them and farm ticks with butchers bounty for tick blood. I also pick up all industrial solvent, turpentine, and abraxo (2 antiseptics at least for each). And I use super duper (only rank one because I have other cards I have wanted) and chemist. That means at least 4 stims per 2 tick bloods and 2 stims per blood pack. And them I dilute the shit out of them making 4 diluted stims per 1 regular stim. 
---
Pharma phama is also great, when I was running low at lower levels I would do a run through the Morgan town airport and the medical building in the ash heap for stims. Usually got like 15-20 if I used rank 3 pharma phama. 
---
I am currently sitting at about 300 regular stims and about 100 diluted. And I just spam the shit out of them when I need them (even with rank 3 of first aid, they don’t heal as much becuase of my healing factor mutation.)
---
Supers I just sell to venders. Never have used a super.
---
I have also heard it is very easy to make heal salve with the green thumb perk. But I have no experience because I have constantly had plenty of stims during my gameplay. 
---
Lack of equipment?
---
Easy daily quests. Takes a few minutes and you get a bunch. I have so many I just sell them off for caps. 
---
At this point I don’t think you even know what that word means. Where am I being either closeminded or an egotist? 
---
Yeah, I *am* being condescending to you. You don’t show me the consideration of reading what I wrote, I’m not going to show you the consideration of treating you like someone who’s responses I should value. I met you halfway by rewording and expanding what I wrote. You shut down with an unsupported statement denying all of it. 
---
If you have something useful to contribute to the topic at hand (zealot’s and scorchbeasts) by all means, share. But show your work. I did. 
---
Pulling a 360 will have the game going in the same direction it had been
---
Agreed. Maybe in time. 
---
Nah screw him. He deserves it 
---
I AM GOING TO HAVE ALL THE TEDDY BEARS EVERYWHERE!!!!
---
You become wanted for killing other players, attacking their camp, breaking into their camp.
---
Unless there's another way, what else do you need to know? 
---
I think the reason your post was upvoted is because you have a valid criticism of the pvp system.
---
The community here is overwhelmingly anti-pvp. Crying about pvp fights at workshops being "griefing"
---
Most carebears around here want pvp completely removed from the game.
---
I dont think you have a good sample size of actual pvpers around here. Just look at the aweful suggestion to "opt out" of defending a workshop. That allows pve players to claim workshops risk free. Thats what the subreddit wants. This sub does not speak for the pvp community at all. In fact they drove most pvpers out of here a long time ago. 
---
That's what I'm thinking. I hope not, but if it is I might reserve judgment to see what their "twist" on it is.
---
If it is battle royale **I hope it would be something like this** (But I doubt it would because how much work it would need):
---
The game starts October 23, 2077 before the bombs drop. The goal would just be to survive instead of just being the last person standing, working with other players would be rewarding.
---
The entire map and buildings are pristine and prewar. The nuclear bomb sirens go off. I'd love for there to be a ton of NPC humans just fucking scrambling everywhere trying to find shelter, but that seems unrealistic considering their AI pathfinding sucks. At first several nuclear blast zones appears near the edges of the map that you have to avoid. Once a bomb goes off that circled area would become "off limits" and would also have some slow growth due to the spread of fallout. All the zones near the edge would grow enough to connect together and form a border. The edges of the blast zones would constantly have ghouls coming out of them, so you can't stay right near the borders.
---
Every human NPC would turn into a ghoul (the interesting side effect here would be that this becomes incentives to commit mass murder before the bombs fall). 
---
More bombs appear until there's a small area left on the map. BUT instead of it being "last man standing" it should be a huge PVE bossfight with waves of enemies too. It would give you a countdown to prepare yourself, maybe even build structures and defense  (or maybe the countdown could be skipped if everybody alive agrees). 
---
Maybe instead of having you build something from scratch it could be a pre existing building and your camp items would be extremely limited and would snap easily.
---
Once the preparation time is over ghouls emerge from the fallout clouds in waves to attack you and the other survivors. Maybe some waves of super mutants and other creatures. After awhile huge boss would emerge (something like a giant mutated Grafton Monster. No flying monster pls).
---
I highly highly doubt this is what it'll be because I just made it up, but that actually sounds fun.
---
BETHESDA TAKE MY IDEAS PLEASE
---
Hmmmm. Goatse
---
Rad away, and pray to RNG Jesus he doesnt take away the mutations you want.
---
Serums have dropped greatly in price, so if lose one or two you want, consider buying vs playing the mutation lottery.
---
Aren't they working on that
---
How about instead of a survival mode have a “non survival” mode?
---
I don't play this game but I would just like to point out that someone yesterday was so sure that Bethesda was scrapping the game and there would be little support at this point.  I hope he realizes that he and everyone else like him that thinks they're business moguls because they took Business 101 are actually just a bunch of low iq neckbeards that are never right about anything.
---
Millennials are in their 30’s now. We gotta move the generational hate onto the Gen Z’s now.
---
I would love a chupacabra. And [spidergoats](https://phys.org/news/2010-05-scientists-goats-spider-silk.html).
---
Lets make a bear neighborhood. 
---
nah I paid my money, I've earned my right to complain
---
Username suspiciously close. 
---
I'm glad they started working 4 months after launch.
---
Same, currently sitting on nearly 500 regular and just over 100 super. It's rare that I ever sell them since I prioritize unwanted gear, clothing, water, food then chems. Thank goodness for the perk to make them weigh 90% less. Wish that worked in the stash, I'm carrying 50+ lbs of stims.
---
Dude, just go away. This is the internet, nobody cares. You should go back to r/iamverysmart    
---
You called me out for using a word that - in your opinion - was used in the wrong context. You got your internet points, I'm sure everyone knows you have a huge penis, congrats. Kindly please go troll someone that cares
---
West Virginia Arthur West Virginia! 
---
If it’s a prestige system like call of duty uses it won’t matter if your lvl 51, 151, or 251, when the update drops, you would just get the option to prestige or not and reset your character to lvl 1 again, I imagine while there may be an incentive to prestige there is bound to be a trade off of some kind, no point being concerned or speculating too much till the update drops
---
FINALLY SOME GOOD FUCKING FOOD
---
not on purpose, I'm trying to use 'she" sometimes when I would normally type "he."  Perhaps I should stick to "they/them/theirs"
---
This reminds me of when the damage control letter was released before launch and everyone went
---
"aww how sweet. Bethesda really DOES love us!"
---
It's ok to be optimistic. Really that's fine. But you have to remember that Beth Austin is owned by a megacorp. They're going to do what is in their best financial interest. Let's just hope that means we'll get a great game out of this. 
---
Honestly I would be happy with a crafting load out and then a combat load out. I have no reason for anything else. Well a third 2h/pa load out would be nice also but not necessary. 
---
&gt;The fact that there is no method for the development team or their game masters (if they even exist) to correct issues in game makes no sense in the grand scheme of "we'll support this game for as long as you play it".
---
They've fixed plenty of issues in the game since launch, including on quests. What you're stating is quite literally not  in the slightest bit true. 
---
I’m pretty sure Bethesda said the only micro transactions in this game are going to be purely cosmetic / social (Camp stuff. Emotes. Icons. Pain jobs etc) meaning that they’ll be able to support free DLC for some time.
---
If you're on PC plenty of places sell it for like 11$
---
Whatever it is, it’s a main quest update, which means we will be progressing past the scorched plague. Exciting to see what is next for Appalachia.
---
Thanks!! Much appreciated!!!
---
What in the actual fuck are you talking about. 
---
Can I put my Tricentennial painted 10MM on the wall? please?
---
Nobody besides the game developers knows anything about how any of the announced features will work. It's quite pointless to ask such questions here.
---
Of course, we can talk about everything of what is coming up, but until any of these features actually arrive it's nothing more than hot air.
---
 Looking through this, it's pretty vague especially on the stuff that's further down the road. To be expected I suppose. The Wild appalachia stuff doesn't do much for me but depending on what kind of changes nuclear winter brings that might well be reason enough to log back in. 
---
Wastelanders is definitely intriguing, Bethesda showed with Far Harbor they are more than capable of delivering an excellent Fallout experience that combines what's great about the Black Isle/Obsidian titles with what's great about 3/4. Hopefully this is the case here. 
---
Fuck the haters 
---
Is the moral of this that you want to sell me that weapon? 
---
I'm guessing it's going to be battle royale or something but with bombs.
---
If it is battle royale I hope it would be something like this (But I doubt it would because how much work it would need):
---
Every human NPC would turn into a ghoul (the interesting side effect here would be that this becomes incentives to commit mass murder before the bombs fall).
---
More bombs appear until there's a small area left on the map. BUT instead of it being "last man standing" it should be a huge PVE bossfight with waves of enemies too. It would give you a countdown to prepare yourself, maybe even build structures and defense (or maybe the countdown could be skipped if everybody alive agrees).
---
I wonder if the game will have a sale. Im interested and if the roadmap is true this game could pull a 180... i dont think its a full price game but maybe on sale and the roadmap is truthful.
---
Looks good...so have also destinys dlc . Then its a few booring quests and weapons. I hope they make good of this👍. But tbh bugtesda has some work to do before im ready to celebrate. But lets hope for the best
---
It looks promising 😁
---
They still won’t be happy because they’ll have to wait another month lol
---
u/ladydevann will today's stream be recorded for re-watch? I'm at work and cannot partake (along with much of the U.S.)
---
breathe kiddo, breathe
---
I can't wait until I'm high enough level to get even with this guy.  He's killed me too many times, and destroyed my base to boot.  He's got it coming!
---
🤷🏻‍♂️If it was “his” camp would you have given the specificity a second thought? I think it’s cool when someone doesn’t default to “male” on posts like this, especially when it comes to gaming. Just a thought. 
---
I bought them last night at Sunnytop Station.  
---
A few hundred hours in Fallout 4, even did all the achievements on xbox for giggles, and never had a clue duping was a thing.  Widely known among people looking for ways to dupe isn't likely that widely known to the rest of us.
---
&gt; I thought I'd make a summary for that section of youtubers and net denizens who don't have the time to think deeply about things or understand the context around them, and the games media sites that like to use reddit as a research source.
---
You should have written it in crayon so they have an easier time reading thru it
---
This the roadmap DLC and events. Suspensions and bans seem like something that fall more in line with Inside the Vault.
---
Confession time: It was already dead at Whitespring Station!  
---
I just couldn't pass up the photo opportunity !
---
True heros do exist!
---
Have bought some from others now and then
---
Have about 1600 of em 😁 . No need to worry about stims 
---
Yeah your right but sometimes the developers do answer the questions asked and it’s just a nice question to ask people to get them thinking what are they gonna do with the people way over level 50.
---
So face to lens to screen to face?
---
We would have to see how worthwhile vending becomes. I would hate to have to leave my well established and well liked camp location just to have a chance to sell. 
---
What's the difference between photomode and "a working camera?"
---
&gt;, but aren't most mods made by players?
---
They have to add support which they have been strangely silent on.  They aren't providing updates or a revised time table for when they will implement support for them.
---
This is a wonderful roadmap.  As a player who completely abandoned this game, this roadmap gets me excited for the things to come.  Some of these look like real game changers.  I only wish we didn't have to wait so long for some of these additions, but alas...
---
Everyone else despawns for me.
---
You can't even carry 30k caps. How you gonna do that?
---
And for those prices I can just buy the item off someone.
---
 I don't care. I'm on PC and will probably just put it back when my stash gets full. Actually I'll sell it to Wallace I think. He is my favorite bot.
---
I'm definitely going to comeback when we get these updates rolling out.
---
I fear my expectations are too high for a new main quest and factions but hope it's big.
---
Countdown to them being rotated to form some kind of orgy
---
Thank you Bethesda!! I've loved this game and tried to stay positive since launch but this is the first time I've felt truly excited for the future of Appalachia. 
---
The "legendary players" part really raised an eyebrow. Can't wait to see what that entails!
---
...go on.
---
"Why does the Server keep Crashing"
---
"Those assholes at bethesda decided to let people will an entire house with teddy bears"
---
yep here's something useful . zealot doesn't work on SB or SBQ
---
I never thought the game was going to be abandoned this early. If anyone took the time to research about the game before it came out you would probably realized this.
---
For something of this nature, Bethesda has to budget to develop without the prospect of profit for at least a year or more. I know people are going to nay say that. Why would they make something that didn't make money.   
---
There's a difference between not making a profit for a year or more, and just not making a profit. But Bethesda has put out free products. Those cost money. 
---
The reason they would budget to cover the game for a year or more, is simple. To develop it in a new way, and a new type of game. It's an experiment. It's an attempt to change the kinds of games we play.  
---
The idea that there are multiple modes that you can play in, with the same character, is pretty interesting. 
---
Someone a few posts down mentioned something about new factions in Wastelanders. Maybe that's where faction warfare is going to land?
---
Given how radioactive water is, trudging through knee-deep frozen water sounds like quite the harrowing ordeal. I can't wait. 
---
Good point 😁
---
Haters gonna hate. Nothing to do about it other than ignore, maybe downvote and scroll on.
---
Personally i already love what will come in the future and really looking forward to it.
---
I have so many bobbleheads.  it'd be nice to have a filled up stand.
---
i’ll admit that i kinda got burnt out on playing this and i’ve been hoping that new content is great. and i can say that this looks very promising i’m super excited to start playing again 
---
He better marsupial jump like crazy possibly have an explosive vents-like landing attack.
---
Wish I could get that drop mine would have been a 1* stalkers shishkabab
---
down voted because nuking whitesprings used to give you like 20 levels in a session without even trying...
---
 I usually just let them run their course as well, but crazy to learn there was something so simple there all along at Whitesprings. 
---
I have always considered it people born after 2000, aka the people who had to ride in the car for 8 hours with nothing to. They dont realize how awesome it is to be able to stream movies or play games on road trips.
---
You know very well that most of the people complaining about no new content aren't actually looking or hoping for new content. They're complaining to complain. 
---
whelp. ill be brewing grampas cough medicine and selling my wares! woo woo do we have any overalls with no undershirts and shoeless?! 
---
Admittedly, it's been a while since I've read through Revelations. Reading through it again, I can completely understand how pop culture could shift its focus around and reinterpret the text like that. Having separate riders for war and conquest is awkward to begin with, as is having riders on similarly colored horses; but the text definitely correlates a white horse with conquest, red with war, black with famine, and leaves pale/ashen undefined. Based on the list in the passage you linked, they've got death by wars doubly covered, and a horseman assigned to famine already, so pale/ashen would have to be pestilence or... Wild beasts? I can see how it could be open to interpretation, but the shift in popular opinion seems to be heavily based on the way that most interpretations of the text list two horses as being very similarly colored. I think "ashen" does a slightly better job of differentiating the horses than the "pale" that I grew up with, though - "ashen" makes it sound like a light gray horse; while "pale" reads more like off-white or cream, which would basically just be a second white horse.
---
An NPC yes. Everything that moves and shoots at you or sells things to you but is not another player is a fucking NPC. 
---
IMHO it's just another speed mod.  I have the perk cards, I have to equip them like anyone else before i can get to what is in the loot box.  You can your example to almost any mod, even QoL mods.  Perk Load Out Manager gives an unfair speed advantage to switching perk cards, Better Inventory gives an unfair information advantage for inventory management, HD Maps give unfair map locations information, Reshade mods can give players an unfair lighting advantage, etc etc.
---
It's a slippery slope I agree.  Nexus doesn't condone cheating mods and they haven't pulled the locking picking one yet.
---
the prestige seems very interesting but if you lose all your perk cards i think it will be ignored. im only over lvl 200 but if i lost all my perk cards id be mad. they are already level locked so losing them would seem way too extreme.
---
Cause people with shitty internet blame your base fit their lag. My base didn't even sit next to the club it set next to the river and thanks to the dumbass band wagon people kept trying to destroy mine. For the most part they're either people with shitty internet, People still steaming about TSE nerf or dupers who cheated theirself out of a game to play so now they just run around messing with people cause they have nothing better to do.
---
Sweet rng... I just „farm” as long as possible 3 mutations on barrels with radioatcive crap in it. If second or third is not i want to be i just reset all. Rest i buy in sience bay on enclave/reddit market. 
---
i'm not that high lvl (71) but before i go exploring, I look at the map and try to steer clear of any low levels so as not to increase their mobs, though if they're too east or southeast, sometimes I'll send a message asking if they'd like some help.
---
I get where you're coming from, and probably yes, if you would have specified either way I would have thought the same "they have a specific player in mind". But perhaps it's just how my brain tracks thing as I read.
---
There always has to be one...
---
meat hook is only better if your using both unarmed and one handed perks but i have no room for that. your right tho cuz honestly its more fun calculating dps in this game than actually playing it.
---
&gt; your Atom Shop decorations themselves.
---
Don't you dare hype a CBBE-like mod like that.
---
 LOL. Like the Mutants Wood Chest I got 7 caps for just recently. ;)
---
Seriously? Damn something is broke for you man. You should be maiming shit with that Poon Gun. Especially since nothing stands in front of me for more than 4 seconds before dying, and I’m doing so much less per shot than you. I’m literally drooling over the idea of that gun though. 
---
Wonder what resetting means , is it like level or is the whole inventory wiped . 
---
I know you guys did a McElroy reference in the base game, but I hope in one of these updates y’all insert a reference to The Adventure Zone: Amnesty. I mean, both are set in West Virginia and cryptids play a big role... It’d be so good
---
HAHAHAHA nice one.
---
I thought you made a typo... I have literally never heard anyone say that 76 is way better than 4. My mistake, it is just a surprising thing to hear.
---
I have a similar looking base, built on the side of a cliff, but have found that animals can glitch through the walls. Not sure how 😕
---
So i should be banned for being lvl 248 and focusing on farming gear as much as possible = much xp also. Sorry that i dont enjoy playing casually and just running around the map
---
And when they aren't, a lot of people who read this post will say "Bethesda lied to us again!"
---
I'm on PC and I can silence a handmade.
---
I screwed around a ton.
---
I would have agreed 15 years ago... now you go anywhere and do anything in public beyond being a meek sheep with your chin in your collarbones and you have to justify anything you do or say.  Largely I blame these modern morons who think they have to find everything offensive lest they miss an opportunity to get youtube hits.  Or likes.  Whatever the hell youtubers are after.
---
The lady doth protest too much, methinks
---
(applies to a lot of the hatred towards \*possible\* duping)
---
You on ps4?
---
I'll buy/trade for 100
---
Maybe after hitting prestige we’ll be given the option to increase a SPECIAL stat limit up to 20?
---
Xurveyor
---
Why does every Bethesda game have early struggles in the first place lmao.
---
Well... this explains why I've been getting my ass handed to me in some places.
---
Meh I have never been one to make things suffer for the sake of it. If they don't have any intention of lifting the suspensions anytime soon, they might have been better off just banning them out right. since "I was banned" is what people have been claiming since the start of it.
---
FYI this is normal for online games. Grand Theft Auto online didn't get heists for a year after launch. And they were promised to be in the game at launch or shortly after.
---
Yea like if we get like a few more camp items I would actually love that.
---
Here's something I am excited about. Same game, different modes of playing, with the ability to move the same characters across the different options. 
---
While I'm not a PvP kind of player, I like the idea of being able to test out different options with the same characters. Not having to start all over again. 
---
damn kids these days, wanting content for a lackluster game
---
Wouldn't Wana ding ya own armor wit the boom 😉 stow it for this act of insanity.
---
I remember playing this card game on roadtrips with my family called “are we there yet?” And it was just cards of shit to look for along a highway.
---
I agree, it would be nice to get some details but honestly, the roadmap was released what, half an hour ago, so i highly doubt that anyone, developer or community manager, will pass along more details about what's coming up at this time.
---
The road map was this week's inside the vault.
---
Nah, it's fine either way, just thought you had a specific player in mind lol
---
Nice!!
---
Since day 1 I'd been wondering about all the stills I'd see all over the place in the game. Now we finally know! 
---
I'm not disputing any of those facts (except 60hp being a "significant" buff - if you can get four people to coordinate, you don't need *any* buff), and yet you're still making a mountain out of a molehill, and seeing a conspiracy where there's none. But hey, you're welcome to your outrage; I hope it's entertaining you.
---
&gt; they worked hard on
---
Dropping a few square floors with a bunch of turrets is not 'working hard' on your camp. Personally I would never attack a proper camp that had, you know...walls. A roof. Even a couch, anything that shows the owner actually did put effort into it.
---
Omg a backpack!!!
---
Alright, grandpa, settle down.
---
I expected bethesda to be kinda vague about their goals for the future of 76 which they were. No hard feelings.
---
i wonder if its going to be entirely different servers for the new gamemodes, or evolving the map we have now as time goes along
---
That was my suspicion as well. 
---
First they should fix the legendary drops, unless this vendor accepts drills as 3* legos.
---
XD you thought 
---
So why do you not want us to sell?
---
And they even have blackwater brew...
---
Downright insulting tbh
---
Hey well you know not everyone has all the materials they need at once. It’s called a “work in progress” 
---
The issue is not “to ban or not to ban”, it is how to prove they used the exploit in the first place.
---
If there was a specific log (say total XP from disarming traps) they could get the guys who did the prison trap exploit.
---
As for people killing respawn-able ghouls, well that was just from server hopping anyways. If you try to say that was wrong, then so is server hopping for cap stashes or X-01 Shocks i think.
---
Yeah, in the end, it's more up to Bethesda. I just think the lockpick mod is more likely to get you in trouble than something like the Perk Loadout manager because the loadout manager doesn't give you access to anything you didn't have before. The lock picks sweet spot one literally shows you something you would not be able to see without it.
---
Until breaking the decorated items removes them forever... 
---
jk
---
&gt; The complaint of no new content always irritated me. The first DLC for FO4 didn't hit until 19 weeks after launch. Patience is a virtue.
---
I think you're misrepresenting this.  The pressure for immediate DLC was born of there not being enough content in the on launch, particularly the endgame.  Love it or hate it, FO4 launched as a complete package with more to do, multiple play-throughs with multiple endings etc. etc.
---
Hmm, i have an AA 25% faster fire rate cryolator. Haven't been lucky enough to get any good mods on gatling laser yet =(. Gatling laser is my jam man. Really hope they get a bit of a buff soon.
---
Lack of powerful PvP equipment I think he means. Get you a full set of Assassin’s armor and your PvP experience will improve! Good hunting!
---
Hopefully there will be an option like that new feature which displays owned workshops with a player icon on the world map, advertising your CAMP's location and goods for sale. 
---
Lucky.... My parents stuck my butt in the camper, I had to crawl up to the little window at the back of the truck cab just to talk to someone
---
Worth checking out Harpers Ferry and Shepherdstown in the Eastern panhandle.
---
Shut it you... I have 10 luck and after a couple hundred hours I haven't gotten a single slice of pie.  EAT YOUR PIE DAMMIT!
---
Would help to state the platform you're on!
---
I think the answer to that should be a hard no. The promise for tricentennial was the outfit and skins. That was what was advertised and that is what you got. They did not state "Bonus tricentennial only content with each update"
---
If they were to implement that, then they would need to offer a tricentennial upgrade that people could buy with real world money as many people may have bought that edition if there was the promise of exclusive, unnamed content with each update.
---
Just my 2 cents
---
I tell ya man. I get like 20 legendaries every half hour. I just ain't holding on to all that. 
---
You’re email doesn’t say that you are permanently banned, just suspended
---
You can still sell, but I mean we will have the ability to exchange our crappy legendary items for a possible better item! 
---
Relax
---
It looks like that'll be the Fall update, "Wastelanders." 
---
Ah that is perfect 
---
Exactly what I'm thinking, just something as a token of appreciation. 
---
Yay!  Can hardly wait!
---
: )
---
I've found they're WAY more playable and stable since they banned all the cheaters. 
---
Lookin good. And omg I love the Excavator power armor in the pool floaty. xD
---
Agreed.  I’m a sucker for an exclusive Vault Boy decorations.  A patriotic Vault Boy statue would be dope.
---
Perk card loadouts?
---
Hides-Her-Tail, so this is your reddit name...
---
That feels like such a gloomily self-defeating position to take. Cheer up, my friend. 
---
Dude RELAX. What is wrong with you. You have no idea how these NPCs will function. This kind of hype is cancerous in the gaming community 
---
Now this is quality posting! thanks for the share!
---
LOL. love when people try and act like this. 
---
Sure. Ok. I mean, how lame. 
---
Is there like a website you all go to that teaches you all the same kind of replies? 
---
I've enjoyed the game so far. As far as I can see the game has lived up to that initial announcement. I'm pretty keen on this new content. 
---
Well you can loot at the data tab in your pip boy to see what quests you do have and follow along there and just try to clear it out, since we cannot see what you have or haven't done.
---
To find a good spot for a camp, think about what type of camp you want to make (more so with decoration and player vending on the way) and just go exploring for a spot you like or think would be good for what you want to do.
---
Better weapons comes from crafting or killing enemies. super mutants then to have assault rifles. mole miners tend to have shotguns. just hunting until you find something you like then buy the plan to craft it or just keep it repaired.
---
“The biggest and most ambitious” was the description Todd used to describe fallout 76 if you remember. It’s just a buzz word, it means nothing to Bethesda 
---
Yep. I bought Tricentennial like a dumbass just because I was hyped for the game. I didn't buy it thinking maybe some time down the road I'd get more than what they promised.
---
Bethesda; I've criticized you when it was needed but holy shit all of this sounds awesome. Pop a beer tonight when you get home, y'all deserve it. 
---
Someone will surely just respond with a dead Vault Boy gif, a 'Sweet Little Lies' link, and a #notmyfallout. :-p
---
Fine, pull a 720 then. Some people are so pedantic.
---
&gt;New Features: Legendary Vendor and Scrapping – Locate the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary items for new legendary gear. For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams.
---
Last night I sold 4x 3 star legendary items that were lvl 1, 25, and 35. Figured I would never use them, and I wanted the 20lbs of space they were taking up.
---
Damn.
---
Incredibly excited for this. 
---
I've stopped playing over the last few weeks because there's nothing to do if you don't like loot grinding. This shows me I need to get back on to start preparing for player vending/camp decorations/ new quests
---
I used to sell unwanted gear but realized I could get a better return selling the stimpacks and just dropping the unwanted armor. Weight was the biggest factor in my decision. No use in carrying around something that weighs 5+ lbs and sells for less than a couple of meds that weigh practically nothing. 
---
Well spotted! Could be! How exciting if it is! My own little Liberator pal!
---
Thank you, and has the game improved since Christmas in your eyes? 
---
A mistake on my part.  Although, given BGS's current history with updates a full 360 would not be out of the question...
---
With the Legendary Vendor and Scrapping, can we please get some type of lock on our equipped items? I’d hate to accidentally sell or scrap anything. 
---
It's a good question, and one I'm curious to know about as well. Maybe it'll be a part of the "Nuclear Winter" mode or the "Wastelanders" main quest. It would seem especially to make sense in the latter, given what we've been told about it here. 
---
Like, if the stuff you were given isn't enough then why did you get it in the first place. I dunno. Like I said, just my opinion though I do think it's the correct opinion.
---
...is it weird that the thing I’m most excited about is the addition of backpacks?
---
This all looks really great. Sadly I sold my copy of the game a couple of weeks ago, but with this roadmap I may be tempted to jump back in over the Summer. I do miss the world of Appalachia, and I hope all this new content can be enough to make me buy the game again!
---
wtf I'm hype now lmfao
---
We just gotta pray to the moth man more my dude
---
frysquint
---
Teddy fucking BEARS.
---
What platform? PC? XBox? PS4? 
---
Keep your camp small and take it with you. There is no need to waste caps on traveling until you are ready to start really building a camp. 
---
The best quest line to do is the excavator power armor. This can help you out when farming for items. You can also get Raider Power Armor at level 15.
---
Depending on your build find some places to farm. Grafton has some easy events. The ash heap has a lot to do in smaller more compact areas. 
---
Take your time with questing. Get a lot of your farming done now as you are leveling. Save the quests for when you get bored with exploring and farming. 
---
Be realistic, it’s a news story quest and a PvP mode. The hype over this update is unbelievable.
---
Survival mode will be just this. I have a guild/faction/discord of Roleplayers. We give quests and pvp together. 
---
We plan on joining the survival mode as a group and shaking up appalacia! I dont think you will find alot of solo wanderers in survival. Pvp is tough when you are outnumbered. 
---
What platform do you game on? 
---
holding all those 3 star rolling pins for may
---
Ps4
---
Hey man, let me know if you can help me out. Ill buy a bunch. My name is the same in game. 
---
People can buy the tricential pack for real money, atleast on Xbox. Not to mention with how poor 76 was selling in some places, you could buy the whole thing for really cheap.
---
 I get what your saying, I purchased the edition regardless of what was in it because I wanted to support Bethesda. If you actually do the math, 40 euro for a power armour skin valued at 10 euro and some other miscellaneous stuff that would be valued at 10 euro as well means I paid 40 euro for 20 euro worth of content. That seems shitty to me. But like I said, i didn't buy it for the items, if Bethesda did give us something extra in the future I'd feel more happier about my purchase 
---
No idea, but imagine if you could create security cameras at your CAMP and check them from anywhere. Great way to see what is going on at your camp. 
---
I one shot nearly everything else in the game to an almost comical degree. Even mirelurk queen - if I hit her right with maximum buffs on, gets shredded. Queen doesn't even flinch. Maybe I should be using barbed instead of fleschette (shotgun). The shotgun type is amazing for taking out larget groups of ferals, but I'm just not seeing any damage done to the queen.
---
It's a fantastic gun for farming whitespring through. I can take out everything in 3-4 shots, minus random stragglers, and I have infinite ammo. Lasts for 3+ hours of farming toon.
---
A bit of hp per shot. I haven't really studied it but it seems proportional to the amount of damage done. For example, 30% healing of the damage done.  It's not instantaneous but it's quick.
---
For your camp just find a place you like for your first one! I had mine up near the lighthouse for about 80 levels before moving it because I just liked being there. Do events in the early level areas! You get decent xp at low levels and you get items to sell or scrap for plans. Leader of the pack is a good early one because you get some legendary items and it's not too difficult. Just keep your eye around Morgan town, Feed the People, Back on the Beat, and Colision course give good resources for early levels. Sometimes teaming up with people is good! A lot of people complain about higher levels being jerks but a lot of us are bored and dont mind just following you around while you do the main quest and helping you kill the things that are too high leveled, or just giving you free shit. That being said, some are assholes and suck but dont let them get you down.
---
I wish we had 2 CAMPS. One with a larger budget to keep as a home base to kick back at after a day in the wasteland. The other camp would have a very small budget and be a travel camp that would use while out adventuring.  Just enough budget for a couple platforms, some benches and a stash box. 
---
IE, jumping off of cliffs, drowning, stepping on landmines, etc? 
---
There wasn't much to improve in my eyes. I was never hit by any of the big bugs or the amount of them that other people seemed to have been. but with the content coming from the roadmap I am glad I havent gotten bored or burnt out yet.
---
If they pull this off, it's going to be something out of this world. Despite the haters this is already my favourite game
---
C’mon... we know that’s just wordplay and you know it. So “suspended” to a future patch could literally be next patch or 2 years from now. 
---
The fact that most the tickets people were directed to submit haven’t even been looked at. 
---
They told people to respond to email directly which it’s email address was “no_reply@...”
---
Ironically you know as well as I that actual players duplicating things are still playing and they still got to keep one of their duplicated weapons??? 
---
I don’t expect anyone to believe anything on the internet at all and that’s why I asked Bethesda for more information and I’ll post it here especially the 100,000 rare in game items... hell, I just got enough springs to build my legs for my armor...
---
I'd counter the pressure for immediate DLC was born of the yearly CoD cycle and other MP titles that have experience in this arena. Who typically make their money off charging for map packs.
---
Plus, what good is new content if the servers are shit due to bugs and duped items? 
---
It's why you can't place or manipulate objects at all, anywhere.
---
No one knows 
---
Its adding enough new stuff for most players of the game to play again. PVP focused server and quality of life changes to make the end game less of a grind. Those are major additions and hope changes will be added like the "hkt fixes" we get
---
Lots of new features slated. Any word on bug fixes?  I don't want new stuff until I have a working game...
---
Player vending will fail unless you can tag your camp on the map for all to see. 
---
Exactly. This. The only one that may have surpassed it in my mind is the Destiny 2 season 2 one. 
---
This is great. I love it. 
---
Take and defend workshops, you'll be swimming in them.
---
Where did you end up and what level are you at? 
---
Crafting melee weapons is a good option for the very early game.
---
Camps are for convience (free fast travel to stash junk, repair stuff...) And can be place just about anywhere.
---
I'm stoked for distilling and brewing.
---
I'm going to be "Just a good ol' boy, never meaning no harm..."
---
I keep 2 lockpick skills at all times. Would love to have a way to make this passive. 
---
I haven't played Anthem nor read anything about it's release state, but simply the thought of it being not the uber game, every FO 76 hater here praised it to be (even before release), makes me chuckle.
---
I surely will play it at some time, but it just doesn't give me that "i need it and i need it now"-feeling that 76 gave me.
---
Add me and find me when I’m on. 
---
I'm sure we'll learn the details soon enough, but they do allude to the idea of making your character more powerful each time you go 'legendary,' so it makes sense. 
---
Have about a dozen legendary handmade rifles, just can't bring myself to part with them. Glad I kept them now 😊
---
It would, plus I miss having one after 3 &amp; 4. You can find all the Bobbleheads around fairly easily.
---
Yes it is I agree. And it’s good people using words like unfathomable is just overboard 
---
Hi Bethesda - any hints at when brotherhood will be able to get our power armor paints back legitimately in the roadmap?
---
I'd say LIES my 432,198 ultracite rounds were totally legitimately farmed and crafted with the help of my 12 friends that I was just "holding it for them". SLANDER I SAY! XD
---
I'm hoping it changes the landscape to snow covered and you have to take into consideration how warm clothing is to survive.
---
Not hyping too much on that but a person can dream
---
They haven't detailed. A "whole new way to play and experience a different type of wasteland." Hmm, maybe they'll be adding different features
---
No worries, I personally know that struggle. When I was deployed I would have my wife read me patch notes from WoW and she even watched blizzcon to give me the summary the best she could of everything.
---
Just pass the favor forward (งツ)ว
---
What are we thinking is the implementation here?
---
 Are you really dropping all the way to level 1? 
---
Do you lose the ability to use certain perks?
---
Do you lose the ability to use higher level weapons?
---
Do you lose any of the perk cards granted for 50+?
---
What if you are level 200? Do you prestige 4 times?
---
So many questions.
---
I wouldn't really call it DLC. It's an expected patch consisted of a few more quests, and another form of crafting. Well see how it goes, but it seems like only a couple hours more of content. 
---
I honestly hope it's like the many winter mods in fallout 4! Imagine all the snowy hills and dead trees!
---
Power armor is unnecessary except in nuke zones you are forced to take rads. In fact, legendary armor effects are FAR more useful anywhere else.
---
Question about herbivore. When it grants double effects.... Does it double the bonuses like cranberry stuff gives bonus so. Does that get doubled too?
---
Slated for may 23rd
---
I'm hoping more for a real nuclear winter, but they probably won't have time to create all new art :(
---
Personally, I think you are down playing the amount of meaningful content that is coming out in a short period of time, and it is all free if you own the game. For people that like/ love 76, seeing that the game wasn't abandoned, and that it now (likely) has a bright future... Well, that is a pretty big deal for us.
---
For reaching end game so quickly (not from being OP and rushing but literalky from playing the game), it seems like the new additions will allow various levels of playing. I'm just curious how characters will work with all this new content cause I think it'll get broken fast.
---
If you want raiders, add a karma system. The more times you kill players, the lower your karma, and at a certain threshold you are just locked in pvp mode, and labeled a raider. Simple enough. Make people actually weigh the option to attack someone. And a player that only kills mobs can gain karma, and at a certain threshold they will completely ignore slap damage. So at the end we have PvE players that can 100% some idiot trying to harass them, and the "raiders" that grief, and are just asshats for the sake of being asshats can be freely killed.
---
Holy shit im seriously speechless. This looks very exciting and i cant wait for the future of FO76.
---
Good decision to stick to it. 
---
Yeah I didn't realize that until a few minutes after I made that post. Still not surprised they didn't bring it up since they probably want the focus on the Roadmap. I wouldn't be shocked if they don't address the suspensions/bans again beyond what we know until just before they remove them.
---
grahm in a super mutant vendor with no lore... so I wouldn't get your hopes up.
---
What are you so on edge about?
---
You people are so easy to fool. 
---
So guess it will be worth playing the end of may
---
You could argue that even in nuke zones you could use rad sponge though.
---
You've shown your bias. You aren't seeing this as an isolated incident, but lumping in previous public relations scandals and unrelated mistakes. Bethesda *must* make a mistake because they've made mistakes before. You expect failure, so you see failure. Nothing's going to change your mind. The only concrete fact is Mr. 900 was banned alongside other dupers.
---
As for the post, the baseline to be flagged by the algorithm is 500,000 rare items (ultracite scrap is specifically mentioned). Otherwise, reported accounts with 150,000 rare items (Mr. 900) were evaluated by support staff for specific behavior associated with duping exploits. So they evaluated Mr. 900's account and found he was doing the same things that all the other dupers were doing, so they banned him. I don't know the duping techniques but I don't think they include accidentally dropping and picking up 30k ammo 10 times... The point is he was evaluated. It wasn't an algorithm ban. He was flagged, monitored, then banned. They would see if he was just passing ammo back and forth.
---
I don't discredit the need for new content, which is coming, but rather the demand for it so quickly after launch. 
---
But not so lackluster that you're still hanging around though, huh? 
---
Bloody hell that Anthem game looks boring. 
---
I'm hoping they aren't restricted to a certain power armor like the images.
---
Whilst I love that black little number I'd also love it if it was on x-01 too
---
PA should be on top of your armor and clothing. I think it’s weird that it all comes off. 
---
Add in that if you have deep pocketed regular armor, you have to know carry all that while in PA so you could be overweight...
---
I have a stash, crafting tables, and a sleeping bag
---
you and me both buddy
---
yeah, seems like a good place for the survival factor to be turned up to 11.
---
What made you think that? You'd be limited to one change per few days anyway so no reason to have all money at one, which obviously isn't possible.
---
Could you please explain what this  "road map" is? 
---
I can't help but wonder why they would let the game almost die before showing their hand.  Seems like a bad plan to me.
---
Fair enough, It is a big deal that the game isn’t being abandoned I agree and I’m hyped about that. But these additions are all just standard stuff every other mmo has. Nothing major at all that we know about. This kind of insane hype is what is going to cause the insane backlash when the content inevitably doesn’t live up to the insane standards people like you set on them. Unfathomable is an insane word. I’m not trying to be insulting but have you looked up the definition to that word? What about these updates is unfathomable. If this is your attitude You’re going to end up disappointed I promise you
---
I have to disagree. I've played MMOs dating back to FFXI and part of what makes these type of games entertaining is the struggle. You're supposed to farm and craft. It's part of the journey into being a better player. Being resourceful is not supposed to be easy. Since starting this game back in November I have never asks anyone for ammo, purchased ammo or even considered duping. If you can't farm and craft ammo by now maybe this game isn't for you. If you want easy, go play Minecraft. 
---
Wooden foundations act just like concrete ones. Only you can see through them.
---
Samsquanches.
---
Cautious optimism. Nothing is guaranteed until it's actually released.
---
Sorry for being Mr. Anti-Hype but the world's been promised before.
---
It’s no necessary but it definitely helps. There’s a lot of perks that buff defense and only work without power armor so it’s totally viable. 
---
nice!! appreciate that woman! :)
---
Thank you dude, just decided to completely restart so I can fully enjoy the game. 
---
The thing is that the map is divided by enemy level essentially, so in order to really finish the main quest you're going to have to do some of the side quests and level up. Otherwise you'll get your ass kicked when you venture out into higher level areas.
---
All that to say, plenty to keep you busy for a bit. It's a bit more linear than previous Fallout titles (New Vegas comes to mind, you could go tons of hours meandering through side quests before you even touched the main story). I think I got the Platinum trophy at around 200 - 300 hours in, but a lot of that was simply wandering with friends and resource collection rather than hard questing.
---
Oh, yeah...they are assholes, I thought you were saying everyone that did
---
Just got out the vault now. 
---
Amazing game.
---
I am also on Xbox, and in my opinion, the game was worth $80 at launch.
---
With a lot of fixes it is most definitely worth $40 now.
---
However, do yourself a favour and either play with a fresh player like yourself or play solo for as long as you can.
---
There are not a lot of experiences like this one that can easily be ruined by knowing too much.
---
Also, starting fresh with even one friend is a ton of fun because bro ITS COOP FALLOUT!
---
With a group of 4 it would probably be insane.
---
Especially don't sell 3 stars.
---
Dude just go away. Let people be happy.
---
People and companies make mistakes. The Fallout franchise is worth investing my time in and 152 levels later I am still enjoying 76. Thanks Bethesda for working to make our game better.
---
They may be in other MMo's, but now we get to experience them in the wasteland and see Bethesda's creative touches and approach to these upcoming mechanics. I'm looking forward to it.
---
I hope I can place the super mutant corpse that attack my camp on my table. I need that. 
---
Yeah in my other character
---
AYE! down with the raider scum!
---
Actually i never farmed for stimpacks. I always have a abundance and even sell them every now and then or giving them in bulks of 10-25 to players in the lower levels. I don't even dilute them anymore as the travelling pharmacy perk makes them almost weightless.
---
I went back and read the opening and I think there might have been a dig at the 900 hour guy (and the I played X hours people in general) when they mention the average hours played by the community was 4 hours a day.
---
I agree... I’ve spawned into White Springs not in Power Armor during a nuke... and get fried. Why they let you spawn there but not fast travel there is weird. 
---
Any updates/news on a time line for private servers? (sorry if I missed it in the notes)
---
This roadmap looks great; looking forward to the new content!
---
any explosive, two shot or prime and are you on xbox? :D
---
This is the first time I've seen any sort of decent update info or community communication. Look at all the Bethesda comments! 
---
Imagine being this defensive over such a mediocre game lol
---
Check out the overseers camp, there should be a quest leading you to it.
---
I'm not really seeing how it's vague though. 
---
Have they mentioned anything about mods and/or private servers lately? I haven’t seen any news about that since before launch.
---
thank you for clearing up where i clearly lacked on describing. 
---
That's weird.
---
This map leads right to a cliff...
---
I'm hoping it's a snow covered landscape wrought with more frequent rad storms
---
Items of clothing have different warmth values as survival also takes into consideration the temperature of different areas 
---
Are you on?
---
Oh... That's so much more that I expected... Oh man. I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to resetting my character in a legendary system. Like Payday 2. I got to infamous level 25 or something, which was the same idea.
---
And this winter thing... does that change the look and feel of the map? Ahhh fantastic. I'm disappointed to wait so long for player vending but this is a lot of content coming.
---
Where are those people that keep saying they've abandoned the game and there's no content coming?
---
LOL. Probably. My favorite is this. 
---
Bethesda says a lot of things. 
---
What does that even mean? Come on haters, put some work into it. 
---
bethesda's plans for the coming year. [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps)
---
White male here. I was offended that Preset #1 looks exactly like me.
---
Imagine being subscribed to a subreddit for a game you hate...
---
Yea, same. Not really sure about game modes, thought the focus was gonna be on world events or something.
---
I like this. Though I think if it gets to complicated ppl either won't do it at all. Or, it won't work lol.
---
Anthem is nowhere near to as buggy as fallout 76 is even now in its least buggiest state ever. The issues that game has is tons of loading screens, boring story, and lifeless hub. 
---
First off, if they take issue with mules then they should let players know as every single other online game that has an economy and limited inventory space has mules. Even most games beginners guides state getting a mule to save space. So if they are going to take issue with something that is a common and accepted way of storing gear and items then they need to state as much. They don't have any issue or rules against mules though, that is just your opinion while Bethesda themselves don't have an issue with mules.
---
As for why he would transfer it back and forth? He already explained that, he wasn't sure which gun he was going to decide to use after the TSE nerf.
---
I can’t wait for legendary resets and also that’s a long way away to release vaults. I give t to them for adding new things and letting us know what’s coming but some of this stuff seems like it shouldn’t take as long as they said to come out specifically legendary vendors player venders and vaults. Still wonder when we will get 4 and 5 star gear.
---
I think mole miners are babies. They were small children of the miners who were swathed in miner gear and taken to the mines, sheltered from the bombs. 
---
Then they grew up and the gear fused to their soft baby heads. 
---
Thats why they always drop toys. 
---
Language was lost as no adults survived!
---
Hanging around here, yeah. I like to see new developments and stuff so that itll be better. I stopped playing after a glitch caused it so I couldnt place my atom shop items anymore
---
At least make it a pig or a duck. 
---
&gt; Add in that if you have deep pocketed regular armor, you have to know carry all that while in PA so you could be overweight...
---
I know what you are getting at, but I don't think you are wording it right.  Your equipped armor is not removed from your carry weight when you wear it.  But equipping your Power Armor removes the armor and it's affects from you.
---
So removing 5 pieces of Deep Pocketed doesn't not increase the amount you are carrying, but decreases your max allowed.  I believe when you step into a power armor, you lose the 10 lbs from the chassis you were carrying.  The power armor pieces itself do not increase what you were carrying (they still count as zero).  And you lose any +STR effects from armor and underarmor.
---
Most of that is offset by getting one or two Calibrated Shock mods for your Power Armor.  A single calibrated shock offsets the loss of +50 Deep Pocketed.  The lack of the 10 lb chassis offsets up to 2 STR from gear.  Another Calibrated Shock will likely push you to break even or above on even the best +carry weight and +str armor setup.
---
(This excludes a full Excavator Set bonus).
---
But I do really like these ideas.
---
I mean, I'm not currently subscribed so...
---
Hopefully it's not a fucking Battle Royal mode.  I'm excited for the new PVE content.
---
I'm hoping for 4's Survival mode; or, better yet, Frost.
---
Please keep talking. :) 
---
My first down vote! sweet! thank you! :) perty snazzy.. I'd pay for some more down voting ;)
---
It sounds like both think of it like a rebirth in a random game where your whole character resets and then you have a buff of smooth 
---
Bethesda: Can one of these updates please include Marshall University somehow? I feel like that really shouldn't be missing from this game.
---
Yeah it’s important to keep an even head. They hype about this update is insane. People are losing their minds and one player even described  the level of these updates as “unfathomable”. These people are setting such high standards that they will never be met when the release comes. Unfathomable guy will be the first one back here posting that he was disappointed and it will be his own fault 
---
Im on the highest top of seneca rocks. Guess i wont be having much customers lol
---
..damn you Bethesda! I was enjoying my slow level climb (at 30 now woot!) in a sometime, semi-deserted wasteland..now I'm reading that everyone wants to re-invest their time and get back grinding. All my luxurious elbow room is gonna be filled again with level 100+ Supermen (and women), inflating the difficulty of every radiated creature I see! Damn you I say!
---
If you're on PS4 I'll buy one.
---
Xbox store was (could still be) selling the add-on for $15 to get all the Tricentennial bonus stuff. 
---
Thought that was a good slap considering you can get the game cheaper everywhere now (example: Costco had Tricentennial for $41) and regular game is cheaper. 
---
So I think people who paid $80 got ripped, not to mention Many achievements during BETA didn’t register on Xbox as completed. 
---
I just sent you a PM. Give it a look-see and your wish is granted. 
---
I know it's annoying, but on the other side.. low level players spawning areas with low level enemies can be annoying; reduces legendary spawns, earned XP and level locks any legendary gear. There isn't a perfect solution but I'll always try to help lower level players out if I've spawned a bunch of Level 68 mutants near them. Plenty of kills for everyone :)
---
Crafting a board or a machete for a good first melee weapons. If you find a pitchfork then pick it up, very good for the early game.
---
Just because something is easy to do doesn’t meant everyone’s gonna do it, there are different playstyles and most people “trade” but not in mass quantities which is why you don’t see a ton of people who “trade” get suspended. I won’t do all the math here because I’ve mentioned it many times, just go look it up if you want. All he needed was ~5 flux an hour and with a community behind you that’s insanely easy, as a solo player a little more difficult but still do able with 10+ hours a day. 
---
You’re the one who refuses to acknowledge that communities exist where they pool resources, even Glorfs friends have confirmed this to be the case, a lot of the people in those communities have been suspended so again, seems to me you don’t socialize on this game enough to see the impact of the suspensions. 
---
My argument hasn’t shifted once, it’s been hard to argue with you because I constantly have to disprove your falsities, and still you refuse to acknowledge my main premises. And that’s cute using the Occam’s razor analogy just like everyone else on this subreddit. Bet you’re the type of person thats okay with giving up their freedom for safety. Btw I’m not your friend dogg, not with that attitude you got. 
---
It’s not happiness, it’s delusion and you’re setting yourself up to be miserable later. I AM happy about these additions trust me but I am not on the floor seizuring over it
---
Call me crazy, but... what if the Wastelanders expansion introduces player factions? That would be a CRAZY new dynamic and would explain their perceived hesitation to place PvP and PvE players on different servers. I think we're gonna see a raider faction, y'all!
---
Probably a mission involving Atlas.  
---
As a rule, you should always fast travel back to your camp before logging out. 
---
Nope, I don't agree that it is "unfathomable." I think it is pretty great that I paid $40 for this game, got 200 hours of fun out of it already, and now some solid DLC is coming. No monthly fees, really no pay to win content, unlike a lot of MMOs... I was getting a bit down thinking the game had been abandoned. Unfathomable? No, not for me, but it is a great surprise that I am very much looking forward to. Made my day, truthfully.
---
Not gonna lie.. I became pretty moist after reading the following:
---
* **New Feature: Legendary Players** **– An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.**
---
I think reddit gave the site the hug of death... anywhere I can get a mirror or something?
---
The latter. Honestly, it might be reworked or used later, given it was apparently a PvP based event they might have decided to back off from it.
---
After 76 itself, I can't really be further disappointed. Its a giant test game I bought and I thought that the game was left for better pastures. With how its been the past couple months and Bethesda not actively doing anything about it, these updates are atleast keeping me active.
---
Very true. I look forward ti seeing these additions with Bethesda’s special charm on them
---
Depends on what the new abilities are if they are upgraded versions of those perks then yeah it’ll be worth it but if it’s just a few extra perks that don’t do much but make things a little more convenient then no it won’t be.
---
I was today years old when I found this all out!!  Thank you. 
---
That link was for Fallout 4 mate 
---
Thats true, i have played enough games to have learned not to hype to much before its released , then if its awesome the more reason to hype 😁
---
They said they would revisit ALL energy weapons and plasma guns as far as durability is concerned. I think they should bump up all heavy weapons in terms of damage and durability (especially miniguns)
---
Same here, I'm on XBox
---
Yeah, I was hoping u/Ladydevann or one of the other community managers would be able to give a yay or nay on this. But, if this is just not something they want to reveal yet, then that's fine too. 
---
Was thinking the same thing. My thoughts is either a new area will be introduced that has NPCs and has choice(maybe a sister area nearby like Cincinnati or Pittsburgh or Philly), and those NPCs will slowly start to filter into the rest of the map in 76.
---
yeah, you can.  I don't even use them, I just like to have them because bobbleheads.
---
Damn, that sucks. Well, are you able to tell me where you can find a bunch of them, or how to get the plans for the Metal Chest Piece, because I can't make them, and they're really hard to find (at least in my experiences).
---
I’m happy too but you seriously should google unfathomable 
---
How exciting to get something that was expected..?
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
But that’s not an option 😢
---
Wha it glowing meat? Those radiate no matter what 
---
1) you mean the bug caused by 3rd party mods and not the game?
---
2) no idea I went pc to avoid needing PS+ and consoles are usually worse off as far as frame rate goes.
---
3) depends on what your end game is. I have killed the SBQ all of 1 time because I happened to be in watoga when the nuke hit and I still havent even bother to get access to the silos yet. The vault raids apparently wont happen until some time in the summer.
---
Bethesda clearly stated that they do no support any kind of mod and to be honest, why should they care if any of their doings breaks one or more mods?
---
Nevertheless, i do get your point and do support the request for a loadout manager (although i don't have any problems switching perks by hand).
---
So was the “shear terror” mean to be a play on words or did they literally use the wrong form of sheer and no one caught that. 
---
You don't get loot from mobs your turrets hit unless you hit them too.  Turrets do not tag mobs for you.
---
lol, well I didn't want to stick it there like I'm presuming lol. but yeah your probably right :)) i'll edit it if thats poss.
---
I farm legendaries and sell the good ones to other players. Same for junk, treasure maps, anything really. Get something, find a buyer. I made 8K and spent 10K two days ago. I started out the day at 2K. 
---
So much of this looks great. 
---
Its nice that the Scouts quest that was datamined a while back is actually coming in. 
---
Hope Shear Rooter gives us background on the Molemen.
---
Very curious about Nuclear Winter, Legendary Payers, Wastelanders in the Fall.
---
i have a radium rifle i never use. my only legendary handmade is nocturnal, and my tse energy rifle dies after 10 shots. 
---
Melee is my only option rn, but i'd LOVE to use my other weapons!
---
No, but sounds like a great weekend job. It's your idea, why not put one together? Keep us posted. Thanks!
---
Well they’ll find a way. I miss npcs but I wouldn’t bet on their returning.
---
I would really like a grindable way to increase CAMP size. Something to reward people who put the time in, like a daily or weekly quest that would increase the available building amount for non-defensive/trap/combat CAMP items.
---
Interesting very interesting! 
---
Right... under certain conditions, I remember getting into my power armor and then being overweight which was weird but it was exactly like you said. 
---
This is why I thought that getting in should include your armor you have on or at least not gig you for weight. 
---
It probably has been by 90% of the players at least.
---
It really makes no damn sense at all that a 5mm bullet shot from a gatling gun does like 10-20x the damage as one shot from a minigun lol. From a ballistics sense... 76 is just horribly wrong.
---
Yeah, I guess I could do that. But I'm too lazy to go finding Firecap and shit. Gotta spend all my free time farming for screws and springs lmao
---
A tear just fell our of my eye :)
---
I’m hoping for the option to upgrade perks each time you prestige. Like doubling the stats of the perk or something of the sorts.
---
When a safe has a chance to give me a 3 star gatling gun, then I will waste the time to pick it. 
---
But so far, it seems that 3 star legendary items are not possibly gained from safes. Even at a very low rate. 
---
I guess, just depends on the build you want. If you’re going for a max damage build then I’d still do it because you’re just giving up some QOL perks instead. But again everyone’s got their own opinion on a build I’m just giving mine.
---
As a crazy Scotsman I strongly approve of this....especially if you can make good Whiskey
---
I didn’t even think of that. I assumed you started at 50 with no perk cards and earned better ones as you leveled up. Hopefully they don’t take your weapons lol
---
Oh, hell! So it is. And I even specifically searched "ebay fallout 76 PS4." Why would that ever have been one of the search results? I curse the search engine as vigorously as my own inattention. 
---
Thats very much appreciated thanks, have edited the post now to add the gt but anyway, it's doodleb3gs
---
thanks!
---
So you don't consider a 20% buff to HP as significant? Really?
---
As for your claim about the 4 people working together. That is irrelevant, the issue at hand is the fact that Bethesda claimed the atom shop would be purely cosmetic. This demonstrates that they have lied.
---
So you're right people are rightfully calling it out. That isn't "manufactured outrage", it's calling out a lie and causing a backlash from said lie.
---
If you don't understand how this could lead to them pushing for more p2w type of buyable buffs and how that would be bad I don't know what to tell you.
---
Are the quests and events exclusive to the seasons? Or will they exist after the season ends?
---
I am completely aware of that the word means. Perhaps the OP should Google it, or they just used hyperbole, but I do not need to Google it.
---
Great theory 
---
Me too! Feel free to add me. GT JaggersLips13
---
They don't exist.
---
Probably a redendering issue or they just ignore borders. I expect to see animals inside especially since I have dirt, so kind of expecting molerats to come in. Also Players could get in due to how long it takes to render. Free meat ..
---
Thanks pal, much appreciated mine is doodleb3gs
---
Given the frenzy about the Perk system respec mechanic and the underwhelming actual system, I am taking a wait and see. 
---
OP, could you do all of us a favor and list all these ‘unfathomable’ things they are adding? You come off like you’ve got some inside info, so please share. 
---
Killed the SBQ last night on xbx. I'm lvl71, with nothing but weapons I crafted myself and a suit of T60, so I know I'm not doing much against her. I just kinda accept my job as crowd control, going around trying to keep the adds off of the heavy hitters that are taking down the queen, and getting some shots in on her when everyone is clear. If everyone watches everyones back, its a fun time. If not, its a waste of ammo, mats and time, I think
---
How old are you?
---
New main questline and factions, in a update named Wastelanders? Could be npcs.
---
The real reason we don’t have half life 3, they are making it perfect for all the complainers. 
---
I'm hoping that the weather gets more dangerous. Like radiation storms are deadly. Maybe things like harvestable plants are rarer. Maybe animals get more dangerous when a storm passes? What if it causes some animals to multiply more? Or special animals to appear.   
---
Maybe some areas are more radioactive? I'd hope that it's hardcore PvE. 
---
Maybe there's less junk and such as well? Or at least the junk's respawn rate is much lower?
---
Seriously so much more than i expected and exactly what i have been hoping for.
---
Super super excited for legendary players.
---
Great work B. I knew you were gonna do awesome stuff and people just had to wait patiently.
---
Also, if i could have a T.A.R.D.I.S. or Dalek in my camp that would be awesome.
---
Don’t use it in nuke zones tho, I can almost guarantee you you’ll get disconnected at some point. Has happened to me too many times so I switched it 
---
He would have incessantly server hop and farm bomb sites/SBQ around the clock. This is NOT taking under consideration the instability of the servers at the time is he DID find one being most dupers with a million plus inventory migrate there. So it's like pulling a slot machine. Let's not forget the long loading screens you have to site through in hopes you get a server with a nuked zone. A lot of White Knights also seem to forget that Bethesda can do math as well. I'm most certain they didn't only see 100k rounds to determine he cheated. There's more to the story that frankly Bethesda doesn't need to disclose. They already came to the conclusion he cheated and he received a temporary ban. He should be happy it's not permanent. 
---
Where did you get the Legendary player bit from , I couldn’t find it on the 2 roadmaps , either I’m skimming right past it or you’re looking somewhere else?
---
I'm not sure about that. I mean they have plenty of time to hire voice actors and implement a new story that NPC's will fit in.
---
I never wear power armor but good tip 
---
Don't forget about mullets and big, teased-out Dolly-Parton-esque 'dos!!! I'm still flabbergasted those weren't included from the beginning! Ugh, I'm just so excited about all of this that I can't use anything but exclamation points when I talk! Haha
---
Good stuff! Feel free to add me and join me anytime, or message me here or on Xbox. I should be on most of the weekend!
---
If you’re on PC and use a gaming headset or a mic I’ll team with you if you’d like. Tonight I should be online starting about 5 EST. Normally I ignore random friend requests but I’ll watch for rbandy24. If you play under another name and want to team up let me know your game name. 
---
Sure I can work on it but I only have a few weapons.  It would help if we had a full list to start from.  I can go from there if someone has that
---
Well, keep an eye on the PS store; I've seen it go on sale a couple of times already. 
---
I also just saw [this listing](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-FALLOUT-76-SONY-PLAYSTATION-4-PS4-PS-4/163507984367?hash=item2611d5d7ef:g:MzsAAOSwCWNcTL1M:rk:9:pf:0) for $26, which is within spitting distance of your named target. 
---
I'm just hoping it will let me combine my lockpicking/hacking cards. I'm pretty easy to please. 
---
any fix? im on a 165hz 1440p monitor and it crashes when I use fullscreen :/
---
The same thing. I killed a Wise Mothman a couple of days ago, and yesterday and this morning I got attacked by two Vengeful Mothmen. Perhaps I need to go to the temple and pay penance.
---
I don't really worry to much about the price drop. I enjoy playing the game, I only worry about price drop if I'm buying a game I'm not sure about and then the price drops after I buy it.
---
At least you'll be able to recycle it. 
---
Yep. Im really curious about what special stuff youre going to get being a lgendary player. Possibly a list of stuff to pick from like traits in New Vegas when you first make your character. 
---
Me too. Not expecting much atm. If the dlc:s are nice its good. I just cant believe that they  would pull this of but i hope im wrong. 
---
Some sort of mini camp would be cool. Like only enough budget for a sleeping bag and a couple of work benches or something. 
---
Oh I like that to maybe make the damage cards all one card for a cheaper value after reset
---
Thank you all at Bethesda. I'm really excited for everything. 
---
That would be epic as well.
---
Yes, you can get the Heavy Combat Armor plans from Watoga and Harper's Ferry, they are RNG and seem to share the same slot as the Sturdy Combat armor plans.
---
That said, Ive only been able to buy the Heavy Combat Armor Torso and Heavy Combat Armor Legs... still looking for Arms.
---
I'm cool with it as-is. I'll have to add 10 pounds to my stash for a set of T-45, though.
---
A wanted item section would be nice. I wonder if it’ll alert you when something is sold or if you’ll have to go back and check. 
---
I used it to hold way to much weight. Then told my companion to loot it.
---
We are many! JOIN THE MOTHMA*cough* filthy casuals friend.
---
Throw in a Stalefish and we're getting somewhere
---
That Black (T-60?) Model looks niiiice o.O
---
A real struggle to survive. 
---
You went into it knowing what you were getting. Do you think people that paid full price should get extra game just because others got it for half off? 
---
This could be addressed by having the owners vending machine icon flash on the map screen.
---
As some one that finally gave up playing around the end of January this alone could get me back on it. I basically just wanna play the sims wasteland edition and customize my camp lol
---
Looking like I will do a new survival run in fo4 lol
---
I would have stuck around, but unfortunately I was needed elsewhere, IRL.. 
---
I honestly cant wait to see what "Legendary Players" entails. One of my biggest complaints was feeling kind of weak at high levels against other high level enemies, especially with the legendary nerfs we've received.
---
But it makes sense they'd pre-nerf them for something as significant as a whole new level of power players can get.
---
I am hopeful too, but I want to be realistic. This is a lot of new material and associated code. Based on their current track record, I expect hiccups. 
---
And what you are saying is quite literally blind and irresponsible, especially since you chose to take that quote entirely out of context.
---
There should 100% be a way for the game masters to reset broken quests, take care of broken NPCs, or handle disciplinary issues within the game.
---
Want specifically the info, and ticket information I submitted to Bethesda as well...to which they literally told me they have no means to fix broken quests in a player's journal? Let me refer you to this link. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al0bl3/fallout_76_patch_notes_january_29_2019/ef9ltkc/
---
All of this, when you take the comment I made IN CONTEXT and not make false claims that I'm a liar, is proof that they have no means to correct issues to their game on the fly through means of game masters which EVERY MMO has. I mean, aside from the fact that they have confirmed it themselves that they have no way to fix live quest issues outside of full game patches.
---
But go ahead and pretend that Line in the Sand still doesn't get broken despite their fix of it and there is no way for them to reset it on a live server.
---
May 23rd. My birthday. Looks like 76 is going to give me just the present I wanted in the game. Then I can finally stop filling random drop bags with three star boards and other crap legendaries.
---
Stay Filthy my Friends
---
Very good advice here ^ this is how I manage my stimpaks. Damn near to the letter lol.
---
Yeah I figured as much West Tek wasn’t as well known until about a month ago or so, still gives great XP steel lead and gunpowder tho so I’m not complaining too much. I find that sometimes the legendary is hiding in a room in the research wing, like behind a closed door and you have to engage first. It’s happened the last 2 times I was there now so maybe I just couldn’t find them before idk. 
---
Most people dont know this, but even past your companions over encumberdness, you can click them and tell then to pick up an infinite amount of extra weight. Skyrim dwemer ruins were never the same. 
---
Power armor is mid game gear. 
---
You "need" it for SBQ fights. Thats about it. Nuke zone stuff. Picking flowers. Its flower armor imo. 
---
End game you want 3 star legendaries, especially if you pvp which alot of roleplayers do. Cant roleplay without drama and tension
---
(I am a Roleplayer)
---
None of that says fix the game!!! FAIL
---
“Reputation gained.”
---
Thats what im afraid of also...the patches have not exactly been so promising so far. Or the bugs coming with patches, you know what i mean 
---
I thought it was unfair to sell the tricentennial package separately after the fact due to the game and the package is cheaper than what people paid that’s all...
---
Old enough to have seen this cycle of super insane hype just lead to disappointment over and over and I see again through Diablo 3, Destiny 1, the Division, Destiny 2 and now it will be this game. How old are YOU? Is this your first mmo where a legendary vendor was added and respeccing was added as a feature later? Have you played a game where a new PvP mode was added before? Or new story missions? Doesn’t sound like it.
---
What don't you want a mutant killing switchblade, or cane? Just accept the RNG God challenge and try to kill something with one of the divine ~~weapons~~ gifts. 
---
Well it isn't beyond the scope of Bethesda to create, survival mode in skyrim takes into consideration cold and warmth so they could just cut and paste that mode into fo76 with little or no effort.
---
In fo76 we have the ski lodges so snow must lay in the area at sometime.
---
Having cold brought in as a factor could see more players wearing gear they would normally not wear such as ski suits and could introduce fur clothing culled from Radstag etc..
---
Id like them to add a way for us to flag our camp so others can see it on the map. 
---
Risky, but also good opportunity to sell and make some caps. 
---
Apex is fortnite 2.0
---
This will be so cool but I hope they don’t make a quick toggle. People could kill you then hide in their camp and turn pacifist on.
---
I thought with this PvP survival mode they would make a mode where everyone is in pacifist so we can all be friends lol
---
Woah! The "New Features" under the Wastelanders DLC in the fall makes it look like a sort of bot 'companion'. It would be so cool if it was something like the Mechanist DLC from Fallout 4!
---
Very exciting to see all this, even more so knowing the first is only a month away!
---
It's the legendary scrapping system is what's gonna save it for me.
---
"How dare you even use the word 'fathomed.' My mother was killed by a fathomed."  -Everyone complaining about post.
---
Maybe just the 3* ones. 
---
I think it’s definitely possible, especially considering this game is supposed to be updated for years to come, so they can surely create new NPC’s and new areas.
---
If it's coming out this year, I'm pretty sure this has been in the works for awhile.
---
Also will we have to store our level 50 gear or will being legendary count towards level 50 req? If the former, WE NEED MORE STASH SPACE.
---
&gt; quite literally blind and irresponsible,
---
Right, I'm the one taking quotes "entirely out of context."   
---
Froth harder.
---
We will also soon be able to decorate our camp with inventory items. So we can hopefully just leave PA on display when not using them.
---
Hopefully they keep this in mind when they're releasing the "high-level raid vaults" in the summer. The things in there should be harder to kill, but more likely to give good things.
---
Okay. While I would never root against a game to succeed and be/become a great game, you're minimizing everyone's warranted grievances with this game. 
---
Personally, I was excited for a co-op/multiplayer Fallout. I defended this concept for months before release. I played on day one. I gave it about a week and couldn't stomach the plethora of issues. And let's not forget all of the other issues at launch. They released this game in borderline alpha state and charged $60 with a microtransaction store. They had collectors editions and didn't send the product they advertised. The servers. Framerates. 
---
If they fix the game, I'm all for it and will absolutely give them credit. I even re-downloaded the game today. But let's not act like the people who take issue with the sloppy release are just being "nay saying negative nancies." 
---
Unfathomable was things like:
---
-Player trading expanded upon (the system was already pretty broken with no dual agreement on trading leading to broken trade deals)
---
-Legendaries being available as a trader outpost (Fallout 4's intro of random legendaries was never expanded upon and when 76 was released, it was in an even worse state. Legendaries are pretty much the end game of 76 so seeing there will be an actual NPC market (vendors that is) and not relying on having to post on a sub reddit for people is strange to me.
---
-Placing items on walls/ displaying stuff (76 has no item mechanics like every previous Bethesda game aka you can grab stuff and display it. 76 removed this feature in a way I'd presume to reserve balance of the game for rendering objects. The displays will probably be mega hand held (gun rack, cabinet, etc.) so you can display and twist and tuen willy nilly. Very basic in terms of previous installments and with how stable 76 is, its surprising it even works (just how multiplayer on Bethesda's engine somehow works as it does))
---
That must be new because thats not my experience at all. 
---
Sorry I misunderstood. I thought you said “No I don’t agree, it IS unfathomable”
---
Also notice the female vault dweller in the 'Wastelanders' preview with the new main quest(s), could be the overseer.
---
First time I had to defend the munitions factory I had to take on 2 of them
---
heh "almost"
---
I thought the 4 and 5 star would be linked to the legendary vendor but it didn’t mention it...
---
Quick question. Played FO4. Very new to FO76.  Say I like collecting prewar cash. I have it in my stash box right now, but I have a sneaky suspicion that it can/will be used when crafting. Are there separate containers to store things to keep them out of stash?
---
What workshop was that? I know of ammo factory, mount Blair and the abandoned bog town have a chance to Spawn one. 
---
This sub made me think that the game didn’t have many players. 
---
Their roadmap said that they have millions who average 4 hours a day. That’s a lot. 
---
I hope they keep it up! 
---
Admittedly I did take a break for the first time last month, but I’m itching to go back in. 
---
The new cryptid is "fathomable snow man"
---
1) if you mean despawning that wasn't actually a bug. It meant someone else was built in the same area and your camp was automatically packed up. They've since remedied this. Read through the patch notes from tuesday for the most recent version
---
2) I'm on PC, so cannot speak for PS4 though I have never had an issue with frame rate even since beta though I'm not a frame rate purist and don't notice as much as others might
---
3) As u/cyndrasil stated, this depends on your end game. I'm perfectly content puttering around my camp and tweaking it, running the vendors, does the dailies and weeklies and occasionally hitting a silo or Nuke Zone. If you play it like a fulltime job and make it a point to try to finish it as fast as possible then you're gonna have a bad time and it's your own fault. Take your time, explore, absorb the lore, and be patient.
---
YES! phew! Somebody got it!!
---
Was worried there, for a second! 😍
---
You win :(
---
u/Ladydevann
---
You seem to be most active on the sub at the moment, and while i absolutely love the roadmap, i have one question and i'd be really grateful if you'll respond.
---
Will there be new locations in those updates ?
---
Thank the Gods Bethesda are doing legendary character levels - and the free content - tbh I didn't like FO76 at first - I knew what to expect but was very disappointed. About 100 hours in now and I'm loving it. The latest few patches have helped with crashes and lag.
---
It's starting to remind me why I love fallout and why put-up with all the bugs in FO4 lol
---
The only thing I'm missing is the ability to create player factions and them mean something BUT the player vending machines are a welcome addition I'm looking forward to. 
---
Survival looks promising.
---
I'm so glad they've weathered the critics and pushed on. I was a critic  but I'm glad they're learning - rehabilitation over punishment ;) 
---
I wouldn't mind paying 15 quid for the new questline given the other additions - certainly if it helps see FO76 development into a 3rd season too.
---
Good on you Bethesda hopefully you'll win back some support 
---
I forget where I was this week but I found an (indoor?) lab full of bags of fertilizer and firecaps being grown artificially. I really wish I could remember :(
---
I spy Robot Companions in the Wastelanders update! 😁😁
---
Lighthouse event for penance. Picking up mothman eggs for vengeance.
---
Experiencing the same effects since the game launch back in November.  Most recently, mixed it up with a bunch of Supermutants in Harpers Ferry who were mostly AWOL when it came time to pick up the pieces.  Then there was the attacking lvl 80 Scorchbeast who disappeared in mid-air after I finally managed to hit it with two damaging rifle shots.  It's a mad, mad world in Fallout 76 . . . .
---
NOW THAT'S FALLOUT 76 I WANT IT!
---
I'm really interested to see how the legendary system works. Should I just save EVERY legendary, or only 3 star?
---
The comment that you quoted literally says "in game"...but you made the decision to act like I'm saying they have patched nothing at all. So yeah...apparently you have trouble with context.
---
Craft them
---
I wish to play it on PC, I dont own it yet.. waiting for a good sale
---
oooo...now that's a thought. I have a bunch of them, I had so much flux and not enough hardened masses, high radiation fluids, and glowing masses... so I made bombs. 
---
I usually use them on sentry bots like the one just north of NAR above WS. This might be a better, or more entertaining idea. Have a point for a good idea.
---
The downvote button is unfortunately used as a disagree button on Reddit.
---
What weapon do you recommend at my level? Melee, pipe pistols? 
---
I am on PS4 and I have not had any framerate issues. 
---
Yeah I guess we'll see. Like if that was the case I would be fine with it. But I'm already at Max stash right now anyway. And I would want to hold on do my good guns just to get to level 50 again.
---
You make it sound like Legendary scrapping is the only thing of value. 
---
Well I always run the lock pick cards, ive gotten 4+ PA plans from lvl 3 lockboxes so far.
---
I just run lvl 2 hacker and just click random things unless i really want in
---
Unfortunately no. In truth it was just pure luck on my part. Metal armor was just one of the things I was finding often at one point. Right now your best chance is to learn the plans for the chest piece and do the make/scrap process until you learn the mod. 
---
My only complaint is the amount of time its going to take for some of the more meaningful content, but this all looks very, very interesting and makes me excited to play the game again.
---
Don't undersell the backpacks. Those sound interesting.
---
And the goat beast is the [Sheepsquatch](https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Sheepsquatch)
---
I'm thinking pretty much how legendary skills work in skyrim remastered
---
Just cautious optimism, I don't know why anyone would vote that down....
---
I think your bringing worry on yourself 
---
 Killed my first at level 30. He used a Hunting Rifle and his Sledge.
---
I am legitimately concerned by the state of video game consumerism if you guys are all so fucking deluded that you think Bethesda deserves to (or will even be able to) make lemonade out of this. 76 was a disgusting cash grab that's now in the damage control phase and you guys should be fucking ashamed for being so positive about it. 
---
What the fuck have you guys been reading? Does Todd have a private fucking mailing list that he encourages to stay strong and continue shilling for Bethesda? How can you sit there and devour the garbage their pouring down your throats? 
---
You were scammed. Conned. You guys are left holding the bag here, *and it's not even the bag you were promised.* 
---
Wake the fuck up. 
---
I've got an Ultracite erection right now.
---
Had I but one gold to give I would then be penniless after reading this!
---
Try, Fallout Wiki.
---
My first thought was sheepsquatch 
---
https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Sheepsquatch
---
Melee is very strong in fo76 and very handy in the early game. Hunting rifles and pipe bolt-action are the best early guns imho.
---
Nice. On PC? I'd love to have a drink.
---
So, somehow you have missed all of the complaint posts, and all of the constructive criticism posts, and all of the "I'm outta here I Quit!" posts.
---
Impressive.
---
So what your saying is that all this hype is coming from inside Bethesda and no user of the game is actually that hyped
---
As a man with hair down my back and a bushy beard to match, I'd like to see some longer hair for the male characters as well. 
---
Been like that for a while now. Any event I am in everyone's name and level are yellow as if they are in my team. It isn't until the event is over that i can damage anyone be it by accident or on purpose 
---
And any location that is great for farming? 
---
Yes. I want glowing bottles in my CAMP.
---
I'm obviously not certain, but I don't think from the wording, that you'll just be able to drop everything on the ground and whatnot. You'll be able to PLACE things in your camp - maybe on a shelf? Or like other camp items. Right?
---
Yeesh. I'm a buzzkill. Sorry, m8!
---
I doubt it was intended though I can see how some would feel otherwise.
---
Yup, plus whatever game mode nuclear winter will be.
---
No worries. I do stuff like that all the time.
---
Posts like this are pretty sad. Like, why do you let a game you clearly despise live rent free in your head so much you have to go on rants on the subreddit for the game directed at people who couldn't give less of a shit what you have to say...
---
They will never be happy because that would make them wrong. 
---
Who said anybody is ignoring anything. If you don't like it, leave, if you do play, bring criticism.
---
From players who picked em up b4 patch 5 as far as i know
---
At this point I won't even care if it requires level ups like respecting special points has so far.  It'd be nice if they throw a bone to the players well past 50 already, but I've got 30ish perk points saved atm since there hasn't been anything relevant to do with them.
---
Falling through the ice in PA would suck.
---
Everybody that’s been hating on 76 like it’s garbage can FOAD. Most of the bad bugs are fixed, it’s been playable since XMas when I got it and I’ve played it daily since and love it. 
---
So you're a middle schooler. Got it .
---
It’s the great god Pan. Good thing I always carry my extreme teen bible.
---
I'm super stoked for the Fasnacht event
---
He’s got a little bit of lore. Not MUCH, but he references someone called Smarty teaching him about trading. I’ll take something over nothing.
---
Yeah thanks... Fiary anus....they could have some kind of "Lord of the flies" style lore/history. Maybe even a leader who acts like a middle school bully and cries like a kid if hes upset.. He could have been slightly older... Like a toddler who helped raise the babies of appalacia.
---
I am imagining a bossfight with a mole miner king who cries like a baby and summons more mobs. 
---
Not that I want it to fail, but this just cements the minimal visible release methodology. Who cares about making premium products on release when you can rush it out of the gate and make everyone love you cause you stuck it out through the backlash.
---
No vendor carries them.
---
Hope and Pray to RNGesus that an Armor Mod spawn location has it.  So far I have not been able to pick up a BOS Armor Mod Plan in the wild.  Tons of others, but no BOS Armor mod.
---
I'm impatiently waiting for Beth to fix the issue of these armor mod plans going AWOL since the last vendor patch.  It has road blocked me on my gear progression, as I have recieved some very nice 3* and 1* heavy combat armor pieces but cannot Mod them to BOS yet to make them worth wearing.
---
Just got a 3* Troubleshooter's Heavy Combat Right Leg yesterday with -15% Damage from Robots, +1 Int, and -20% weight on Ammo.  Can't wait to be able to BOS mod it and put Deep Pocketed on it.
---
Just make sure you grab any crystals you see floating before you.
---
So you just see all the hype posts for the roadmap and assume this sub is always sunshine and rainbows? Have I got bad news for you, buddy.
---
Yup, sadly I haven't had much time to play lately, but feel free to add me :)
---
Oh shit, this road map is legit.  Might have to get a new PC so I can play this game above low settings.
---
Oh no! This thing is burning my eyes.
---
Mono... d'oh!
---
Morganstown airport is the best early in the game (to the north), there is a responders quest that leads you there.
---
God... lied...
---
I have a feeling FO76 will redeem itself in time just like No Man's Sky.
---
&gt;Yes, I do not think Bethesda is going to host private servers for free, why would they?
---
Hmmm let me think. Because it's a paid game, and they are hosting those servers for players who paid, to play it. We don't pay to download a 40 GB client that does nothing on it's own. We paid for the whole packet.
---
&gt;I'm almost positive people want to be able to run and manage the server software
---
Why stop there? I've sure lots and lots of people want the source code of Windows too. 
---
Wanting arbitrary stuff is irrelevant. What matters, if you want to talk about things people want, is stuff that's reasonable to get. Do you know any other similar large title where the server software is available?
---
Vending Machines can't wait 
---
He looks like Ryan Gosling
---
I'm curious if they include the game itself actually running or game's main menu open.
---
Im just tryna vend in peace bro
---
Like in Fallout:Frost, need a gas mask to survive.
---
You mean they're doing what they said they'd do from the start? The bastards!
---
If you are on xbox I can mod that leg for you. It's the only plan I know, still looking for the other two 
---
I feel like it's when your kid does a drawing and it's a mess, but you just say something nice so they don't get discouraged, because you appreciate their creativity and want to support them. But Bethesda isn't your kid. They are a multimillion maybe billion corporation. You have to hold their feet to the fire when they mess up. Just like people do with EA, just like people do with Activision. These corporations need to understand we've had enough of these games being released half baked for $60, while some pay an even more premium price up to hundreds of $$$.
---
Seriously. Corpses, and your death drop bag should be the FIRST thing that loads in. I sat in the basement locker room at whitesprings for about five minutes earlier yesterday for my shit to drop because I'd been trading some ultracite and I couldn't remember if I put the rest away or not. 
---
&gt; and it doesn't mean the content will be perfect when it does drop.
---
I can guarantee the new content will not be perfect when it drops. 
---
That doesn't mean I can't be hyped
---
That was one of my favorite builds in NV. Drunken melee fighter sort of a Fallout Drunken Master
---
Jesus christ man, let us have this for a bit!
---
Amen. The default boards are weeeeaaaak
---
You know diablo 3 came out 6 years ago? You know what it’s okay, I can tell you’re salty that not everyone is pissing their pants about this update like you. You’ll learn like everyone else did with their first MMO. Just don’t come bitching to this subreddit that the first content update didn’t meet your astronomical standards. 
---
Cannibal doesn't get rid of the body, so if there was loot it should have stayed. You probably just got hit by the "disappearing bodies" bug that's still going around but the timing is crazy.
---
Forgot to mention those. Deeply excited about that!
---
My guess is it may reset your characters SPECIAL and allow you to respec, but you will gain some sort of boost associated with your character. Possibly stronger versions of existing perk cards, increased HP/AP/Carry Weight, More SPECIAL Points to place in addition to the ones you got to respec. SO excited and I'm looking forward to it!!!
---
I've had this a bunch too. 
---
I think that's a good thing for no other reason than by that time playercounts will be so thin that you'll need something else that can be friendly to occupy the world.
---
My response to that is always marsupial/jetpack up to the roof to wait the shit out. 
---
I would love to have the turrets cost lowered~
---
I really want to man, I have trust issues now.... 
---
I hope it’s the next patch or so, 2 years is insane. I got the same email as well I’m not duper at all, but I have admitted my wrongs into a ticket still not agent have looked at it. I seen a forum by them mentioning that If your experience an exploit stop immediately and submit a support ticket. I’ve never exploited the game but had picked up huge loot in a world and kept it , later on I got rid of it mostly the junk and aids and kept 1 copy of weapon and armor for myself that was all. I went honest about my situation to Bethesda in a ticket it’s sooo long. Although I was honest and said I’m not a duper (which not at all I never intended to dupe things) will they banned me for being honest? I don’t have any evidence idk how I can proof it I was telling the truth in my side . But oh didn’t know duper’s are still playing. I don’t expect Bethesda to banned me for keeping dupe weapons and armor pieces just one copy for myself on a huge loot I’ve found,  I mean I been trading and buying things from people and I’ve had found out that some were duped which the same items were posted up again by the trader whom I traded with. Well also in general I bet whatever I bought or traded (weapons/armors) its a high chance that’s it’s been probably duped hard to tell 
---
Mind dropping one or two?
---
Well, looks like the 5 minutes of fun we got to have are over. The twats want us to be as miserable as they are again.
---
The backpack system looks interesting!
---
Now this I can support - didn't think griefing the bases would solve anything.  Bethesda needs to extend the no-build zone around the clubhouse, at least halfway into the greens.
---
Or those are just the assets used in the instance mentioned above. Who can say.
---
Plus keep in mind, this is not an in depth look at everything coming. I'm sure the ITVs will give us further snapshots as we approach those dates.
---
Uh, actually browse this sub OP. It’s mostly posts about finding every single possible point to complain about. 
---
The community here won’t let Bethesda forget about anything, and continues to beat the dead horse that early complaints left behind. 
---
Lol okay kid.
---
I envy people who get good runs...my very best fallout loot experience was a couple days ago. My first non-shit 3 star weapon in more than 300 hours. At the training yard you turn in technical data, none of the standard farming spots. 
---
I'm just gonna say, maybe people were right when they said the game should have been delayed for a year. If it released with even half of what you say is coming, the backlash wouldn't have been nearly so big. Still excited to come back and play in a few months
---
Great news!!, makes me excited about the future of the game. Thank you Bethesda.
---
Alright, alright, I'll give you that. They've burned us before.
---
But I have hope :).
---
I wonder how this legendary scrapping would work.  Is it like scrapping a legendary and learning its effects to use it on another weapon?
---
This pain is real right now.
---
Fun being the content you're about to wait 20 days for? Not saying you have to be miserable but this isn't a forgive-all announcement 
---
You just unironically called me “kid” lol
---
Ok, just am not really to enthused about trying it again because it locked up last time.  Same with the fissure sight with the 2 scorchbeasts, locked up 4x in a row, on Xbox.  Thanks for the tip though
---
None of the haters on youtubers are gonna report on this lol it’s to positive for fallout 76 but every one of em reported on the 900 hour guy Bethesda bans most loyal player title here on videos screw them 
---
The event complete for me often takes two-three minutes to "load in", eg, for the game to catch up that the event has completed and reward the loot. 
---
&gt;: Nuclear Winter – An entirely new way to play Fallout 76, completely changing the rules of the Wasteland.
---
What does an entirely new way mean? Will everything be covered in snow? Does this effect gameplay in any way? Does ot change anything about the way PVP is works? Turning my screen upside down is an entirely new way of playing fallout.
---
Does "new factions" mean we will get any npc interaction except the legendary vendor? Or will it all be terminals, robots and holotapes?
---
All i tried to say is that this left a lot of questions unanswered.
---
Into meat piles. Which also were not lootable. 
---
I got plans for Arms and Chest before they changed the vendors. 
---
I got deep pocketed Chest too.
---
Need BOS legs and deep pocketed limbs.  Then I will be done.  
---
Thanks for the offer, I’m on PS4 though and will be just waiting for Beth to fix the mixup.  
---
Solid reasoning, think I'll try that out next time I travel the vendor circuit if not just to trim my overall stim supply. 
---
You don't need an explanation. If you don't like the game, go somewhere else.
---
*I* don't understand, how other people can't understand this. 
---
I dunno. I legit never had the experience others have had. It could be a nerf, you could just be running with my luck. 
---
I acknowledge your main premises how ever it is a fairly weak premise that can conveniently be used to cover up all sorts of actions that are generally against the rules.  I've seen this kind of bullshit statements from people on Runescape when they get caught exploiting bugs.  There was a bug in the penguin hunt weekly event that allowed you to claim exp over and over again. People caught would claim it was just because they were training extra hard. Had a lot of people on the forums supporting them. Then it turns out a J mod did a manual check of the account and confirmed they exploited the bug. Those punishments ranged from an account roll back, temporary ban to out right permanent ban.  There have been countless examples of this over the decade I played that game. And out of all of them maybe 1% of people were legitimately unfairly caught. 
---
Now THIS is the Bethesda I grew up playing!!
---
Eh, his post was reasonable. I am excited about the new content, but at least the OP wasn't being a crazy asshole about it. Let's focus on the jerks out there that are telling us we are stupid for getting even slightly excited by the roadmap.
---
Stupid question but are you guys going to fix the fallout forever achievement? It’s my last trophy and I’m at lvl 101 atm.
---
You gotta be mad at something in order to forgive ;)
---
I've never been so disgusted with a company, guy gives me a ton of items, tells me to look after them, banned. 
---
Only know how to dupe on fallout 4, only play on xbox, new patch came still not unbanned, and the guy gave me the stuff still plays. 
---
Valid comment, not sure why dv's
---
I've wanted to make a teddy bear museum for MONTHS. Finally my dream will come true! 
---
I guess you didn't see the roadmap?
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps
---
Don't see private server on the road map. Is it still in the pipeline? Is there any info on it?
---
I.. promise to use that word in a sentence at work within the next week or so.
---
No. All I have to do is either play the game, or don't. 
---
What I really don't have to do, is complain incessantly because someone else likes what I don't like.
---
...dude, I'm offended easily by rude behavior, and your definition of random jackass makes you look like a jackass to me. 
---
&gt; we've had enough of these games being released half baked for $60, while some pay an even more premium price up to hundreds of $$$.
---
Yep, I bought the game, have a lot of hours in it, getting new DLC and game modes for free that will allow me to play even many more hours.
---
How dare a Game Dev try a experiment and do something out of the ordinary and generate hundreds of hours of compelling game for the fans to play. 
---
Instadeath
---
I'm not excited for PvP in anyway whats so ever. Unless they make some huge changes (which it sounds like they will with the survival update)
---
I'm still on the fence
---
Yeah then you will keep paying a premium price and getting unfinished buggy games. And it is your fault, and people like you.
---
Fair point. I really like FO76, and am very glad I bought it. I haven't had any major bugs, just loads of fun.
---
If they buff the damage up to a useful value I’ll buy that sweet chrome skin on the atom shop. It looks clean!
---
 I just want to hold out till they unveil those new apocalypse power armors!
---
Yeah, my comment was more directed at the influx of these posts rather then OP specifically.
---
Haha they have one point in perception 
---
I see what you're saying now. About that part anyway. There was quite a bit of information given though about the other bits. Enough to know what to expect, but not totally spoiling it. 
---
That part is pretty vague though. I'll give ya that. 
---
I wonder if the reports of this not working were from people trying the serum created pre-patch. 
---
I bet it just resets us to 1 with extra points (thinking Skyrim). I bet it counts 200 levels as 1 reset and then we have to regrow. Either way I am excited!
---
im not stoked on how fare and few the content is being dropped but excited none the less. I'm going to be dropping the game for a while till at least a few things are added, I don't want a trickle experience. 
---
Its at the bottom of the road map. 
---
A "griefer" is the lvl 60+ player in power armour who blocked me in a restroom on my second day of game play and would not let me out until finally I resorted to hitting him with my wire-wrapped baseball bat which staggered him out of the door way.  Then, he and his pal tracked me down and killed me . . . and, of course, the server drop immediately upon respawn made my loot disappear.
---
This roadmap looks amazing! One thing which I'm curious about that I don't see mentioned in the roadmap - Will we be getting any more/different/new music on the radio? I understand that licensing is a thing, I'm just hoping for a little more variety there, or at least the second side of Butcher Pete!
---
I’ve been wanting to do that, plus make a tea party table.
---
Nothing about this game upsets you? Or its development process? 
---
Well yeah. I guess you guys are right. Thanks for the input. 
---
They bans they received were only temporary ones until a patch can be made in the future to address those problem as well. It wasn't a permanent ban. 
---
Yes!  This.  My only suggestion is to prioritize player vending first and the legendary scrapping vendor second, ahead of most of the other changes.  IMO This will fix the core game loop and make it fun to play again. Then add new content.  Conversely, who cares about a new thing to build in my camp if I’m not engaged by the game.
---
Also please increase camp budgets for all of this stuff.  Maybe create a separate tiny budget for turrets.  Thanks for listening!
---
Can't wait for all the "dead game" comments in twitch chat
---
I dont see my BOS protective Knight suit on the list... Although i think its the same stats as the officer suit..  Its just orange and called protectice Knight suit.
---
See thats another part of my issue. I am a heavy hitter. I have a furious explosive handmade, an instigating power attack grognaks, and a furious explosive prime gatling plasma. My dr outside of power armor is higher than it is in. Let. Me. At. The bitch.
---
Im more angry about the waste of ammo and heals than i am the lack of loot. At least if i get junk drops i can be mad at rng. Last night i just blew 1000 rounds, 4 cores, like 15 stims and some drugs/bobbles for literally nothing.
---
There's some datamined Mohawks coming 
---
This is me as well, I probably won't play until after summer because I don't want to be drip-fed new features 
---
I don't know how to make a video game. This is true. Absolutely.   
---
I do, however, know how video games work in a broader sense. I understand how these things SHOULD go, and I understand by observing how bethesdas updates launch, that they are skipping very important steps.   
---
Namely, as has been demonstrated multiple times, they do not test the new game version at ALL after compiling and before release.   I know they don't run a early access server to allow players to bug test the code before it's released to the masses.   
---
What's nonsense is this post. 
---
Yea, the grinder, er, legendary vendor/scrapping... I'm not clear on what it is yet exactly but it sounds like something that's going to really save stash space. I hope we don't have to wait too long. 
---
That is a game changer for sure, I have a quad Tesla 1*, would love to get a better version. Bring on the Legendary Lottery, wonder if the weapon/armour you get is based on the item scrapped or pure RNG?
---
Not Grape, those raise Charisma. Berry, I think? And yeah, they probably should have done that, too. But they didn't! Haha
---
thanks for this, I had forgotten!
---
Worked for No Man's Sky, and that was WAY slower to provide content.
---
As long as we get increased carry weight or reduced item weight, you'll get me back.  When I played - 90% of my time was managing my inventory and going through menus trying to decide what to scrap / throw out so I could move again.  It got too tedious.  If you can reduce that part of the game, I'll be all-in. That was really my only issue. 
---
They generally aren't going to be able to kill me,  just a wee bit irksome.
---
You know I didn’t really think that through. Which is funny considering I am one of those scary explosive slinging players. Derp derp. 
---
Including the target dates for releases is what surprised me the most. I appreciate the extra info, but I wonder how confident they are in that schedule.
---
Just when I thought I could only get SO hard.....
---
of 100 messages 25 were game dead or the game sucks  but most are happy with the roadmap 
---
How do you deal with having to relearn all your plans? This very thing has been a major turn off from creating alts I'm this game.
---
So wait, if i took adrenal reaction now, it would actually work? Thanks! 
---
So two questions. 
---
1.	Why is it frowned upon? Legit question, I didn’t know this. I do this all the time but I always make sure nobody is there first. 
---
2.	If this is frowned upon, what are the best alternatives?
---
They’re not impossible to achieve tho that’s the problem with his argument. To get 360k ultracite in a month you need to collect ~5 flux/ hour. That’s so insanely easy to do with a group it’s laughable and the fact that goth punk boy won’t acknowledge that either shows he knows nothing about the game mechanics or is just trolling. I’m inclined to believe it’s the latter because he never actually engages the main premises when arguing people, instead setting up straw man arguments that no one is mentioning. 
---
Found a vendor with 2 level 50 All Rises. I kept one for myself and sold be other for a cap to another guy who had a level 40 one. I haven’t done Mayor for a Day yet. 
---
Actual duper’s got to stay in game and keep 1 weapon, there are numerous posts (not 100% sure if they’re real) from people not banned that duped. 
---
If I picked up something or bought something then take it if it was duped. 
---
Look at people selling... many players 200+ level and up maybe get one actual 3 star drop weapon... players who’ve killed the SBQ numerous times yet low level players have numerous TSE shotguns??? How’s that??? 
---
I wish I did benefit in some way... I mean I have lame stuff, 1 Star armor (only one piece chameleon) and a 10mm 30% robot damage gun and a quad capacity shotgun both NOT exploding. My stash is way under and I’m under weight still scavenging fans and clipboards. 
---
Only thing I know is somewhere I picked up something but nothing that made me overweight and not sure about the 100,000 rare items... I’m calling bull on that otherwise I’d be higher than level 107...lol
---
well i am lvl 270 have done around 500 events that are supposed to give rare outfits   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o/edit#gid=63173560    and have yet to get a single one.
---
Lol ik what you mean.. I have the feeling those new features will come with alot of bugs and glitches.  - puts legendaries for sale at a vending machine, checks later on how much you earned and realises everything is gone including caps-
---
Sorry I meant shooting back. Y
---
Silly typo.
---
Yup, that just capped my stash again, even with just keeping 2* or better till then. I'm gonna have to keep fewer meds around.
---
That blows. I dont get why people feel the need to go after much lower level players.  
---
They've been relatively consistent with updating when they said they were before
---
Watango.... All the things are going to die. DARN
---
this is ridiculously exciting! legendary vendor exchange and scrapping.... i now know where all my STASH is going for the next few months
---
Do you happen to know where I can find the plans? 
---
Nuke winter take me home baby take me home I can not wait 
---
how long do you think it'll be before the update on March 12th is pushed back?
---
Same. I hate switching over to my crafting perks. Then the next time I play my guns are weak as hell because I forgot to switch them back lol
---
Hey dude do you know how many posts just like this i've seen in the last couple days? Freshen up your content, just saying!  
---
They don't all have the same follower base, asshat. 
---
So its unreasonable to expect to be able to be given a server file to run on our own, but it is reasonable to expect Bethesda to allow everyone their own private server on their infrastructure for free, because we "paid for the full package"? In what world does 60$ entitle you to unlimited access to a companies internal servers, but it doesn't entitle you to just be given the server .exe to run on your own, that doesn't cost Bethesda *infinite* amounts of money?
---
Your supposed to get a trophy?
---
Honestly, no. I mean, I have had a few freeze ups and server crashes. Some corpses disappearing... But that is pretty minor stuff to me, as it doesn't happen often. I got 200 hours of fun gameplay for $40. Free DLC coming... I really am overall VERY happy with my 76 experience.
---
Yeah great feature, but no way it's worth trying to save every legendary drop from now until then. It'll be good for drops post May 23, but sweet jesus the hoarding mentality of some people is insane. Just enjoy the game if you enjoy the game.
---
Exactly my point, with the way inventory security and game economy have developed up to this point I just hope it releases in a balanced state. 
---
[You're Mr. 101!!] (https://youtu.be/wbfgVEk-mxQ)
---
Your argument *might* be accurate if Patches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and every future update didn't happen. 
---
Regurgitating some tired "unfinished" talking point doesn't make your argument any stronger.
---
You don't like it? Fine, go play something else.
---
You're not happy with Bethesda? Fine, go play something else.
---
You want to continually complain about things most of us are willing to accept? Fine, go play something else.
---
 Yeah. I'll probably get about 40 caps from Wallace for it
---
Can you look in this files and verify where the shielded for BOS officers suit would be found? I've had people say turn in tech data and other people say Census Violence.
---
I've been doing both and getting lots of other apparel items but never shielded. and yes I have upgraded with the 3 other types in the progression. Thanks!
---
Have you seen the road map for 2019? It appears they’ve learned how to spell fasnacht!
---
Huh neat I never caught that.
---
As long as you do not have currently then it will work fine (although the positive effect is not displayed). It does not kick in until under 60% health, but is almost as strong as before under 20%.
---
Then run a raffle on how many are in it.
---
I think that's fair, I've had a more frustrating experience but I also played far too many hours and paid 60
---
Backpacks and the legendary vendor aren't coming till May, and prestiging isn't coming till summer.  
---
Well let us hope they make good work of it. 
---
why would people object to this? Push it out, I needs this mod back in my life. 
---
That sounds great! Now I think about it, I'm pretty sure I have a vampire radium on another character, maybe I'll give it a try!
---
I'm guessing that you've never seen the turret platforms at WS? Their sole purpose is to steal kills from players. It doesn't even benefit the builder, they get no XP or loot from it, it's just another form of grief.  
---
I'd rather vending be separate from the camp. Say be able to place a vending machine at whitesprings and my camp elsewhere 
---
Found a good place for ticks?
---
So you liked being conned? You like paying $60 and getting a game that is filled with bugs, and every patch breaks more things? Well I don't. And I hope most people that feel conned don't just "Shut up and go away".
---
I've never had more hope for this game! I can't wait for the legendary vender! All of the other content sounds amazing too! Also super excited to see what the nuclear winter is all about! Thank you Bethesda!!!! 
---
Are we counting Tech Data turn in? I got Bomber Jacket and med science suit back to back after WEEKS of not getting anything
---
We're just going to get animated versions of the static cards we have now...
---
Get that radium to work buddy!
---
&lt;citation needed&gt;
---
Stealing the ammo doesn't mark you as wanted?
---
Go away. 
---
Important thing they just said on the stream, they are not devs so they say they cannot answer all of the technical questions people are asking them about the update 
---
No, you refuse to acknowledge that in communities this amount of ammo is easy to get.  Most of the people being suspended are part of those communities. So you keep saying, “ look at all the people who trade and weren’t banned” yeah no shit, a lot of people play this game solo and would never want that amount of ammo. I play it solo for the most part but want the ammo for trade value. So it’s my belief you just don’t interact with RP communities in this game which is where the suspensions were mostly dealt out. I won’t blame you for your ignorance but I will blame you for your stubbornness and refusal to acknowledge the facts. 
---
Btw you keep accusing me of deflecting yet you go off on a completely unrelated tangent, but ok guess you’re just the projecting type 
---
Do you mean a stealth boy?
---
I also just got it about 2 weeks ago. I can’t believe why people were so negative. I’m also pissed at myself I let those people convince me not to get this game for so long. I’m level 31 and I’m having a great time with it.
---
At level 100 you get a trophy/achievement, but it's a bit buggy and unlocks at random levels pass 100
---
Sweet Jesus I hope one/some of them reads this....
---
Maybe they're getting paid for it, they talk about a game they hate like it's a job
---
Did I just have a stroke 
---
Console? PC?
---
No? 
---
those  are rare clothing only thing concidered rare is whats on that list that i posted and only the ones that say "daily/event" only
---
Just south of the 76 shelter. There is a cabin that has ticks. Then south of there has more. 
---
U...Oh my gracious... No words. Should have sent a poet.
---
I think they occasionally get dropped by the queen. 
---
Might possibly also be sropped in the asylum, but I have only seen combat marine armor plans. 
---
According to Twitter psn is experiencing a service interruption.
---
The people who sit here day after day defending the game, instead of actually playing it? Yeah. Looks like it's their job.
---
I can understand that. If I came in when the game was REALLY buggy, paid $60+, and I had my expectations set very high... Well, I might not be as happy with the game as I am now.
---
I understand people who are duplicating for personal gain but for financial gain, that just ruins the game.
---
This just renewed my interest in FO76. Excited to play some of this new content!
---
As a purchaser of the PA edition, I don't think we should get exclusive content. 
---
They advertised each edition with exactly what it would get, and (canvas bag issue aside) we got what we paid for. I wouldn't demand any more exclusive content, because it would rile up even further an already divided community, between the haves and have-nots, and I also just don't think it's necessary. The promise of this game was a "forever" online experience, with free new content for all, and paid cosmetic content for those who want it.
---
Is rather it stay that way, but that's my humble opinion.
---
yes it was datamined that safe has been patched
---
You know some on here have been talking about a legendary cooldown timer which could make sense, especially if loads of people were hitting the same spot as it got more and more well known. Could be you got unlucky with your timing and hit it too soon after someone else. But who knows I’m just speculating at this point, thanks for giving your experience definitely helps create the bigger picture!
---
They really need to pay attention to the obvious ones, Perks, Weapons, Armour and Mutations first so we don't get ambushed after a patch because a key part of our build just failed. Then the world bugs like exploits, new dupes and other issues.
---
Nuclear Winter sounds cool, but Bethesda, anything about cross-progression/play? 
---
Seems to be a QoL change, maybe not suited for "wild Appalachia" but I want it more then ever before. Since the last patch broke the perk loadout manager mod I haven't played Fo76 at all because I cant live without that mod.
---
I talk about it while I'm at work and laugh at people brigading FO76 topics with broken English
---
Omg the incessant complaining. Don’t they have homework in the second grade that kids have time to keep making these whining posts? Isn’t Fortnite still a thing? 
---
Is there a F76 subreddit for grown ups? If so please point me there. 
---
Your wrong dude. Grinding is easy. I could get 20+ levels a day if i wanted too. I leveled an alt from 1 to 50 in less than 10 hours...
---
Not everyone plays the same way. There are sandbox grinders out there. Its unfair to ban people based on an unprovable hunch. 
---
Thats why you are getting downvoted. It's not a good idea to ban more players. You sound like a liberator! A Communist!!!
---
Thank you Bethesda &lt;3
---
Grognak like
---
Yes its boring lol
---
No ones pretending or ignoring the issues. We're just trying to have fun and enjoy the game. 
---
Why does it matter to you?
---
Same here. If it's pure RNG then it won't be a whole lot better than what we have now, I hope it's based on whichever item was inserted.
---
I'm excites to find out!
---
Shit if you don't get to actually like xo up your lock pick skill,
---
You’re right, you should go play something else and not waste time with this subreddit. Good luck and farewell. 
---
Huh. So you got an empty gamebox for $60? You paid money, and never got to play? Did they slip a pokemon game into your cart when you tried to buy 76? 
---
I'm sorry man, you should report that to the authorities. 
---
I'd hate to think you're just being overly dramatic and riding some bandwagon.
---
Grognak good. Nuka rapper good. Red menace best.
---
&gt; Use items from your stash to decorate your C.A.M.P. 
---
Now I have to go find all those damn teddy bears again.  Thanks alot Bethesda!
---
If having “personalities” as exist in FO4 is important to you, then nothing has changed.   There are none in my experience.
---
I’m talking about personalities such as Codsworth and Nick Valentine.   
---
I realize the rules say we can’t have human NPCs, which is why I won’t mention Cait, Piper, Macready and even Preston Garvey and his slightly annoying obsession with settlements needing my help.   Oops, I mentioned them, sorry.
---
So it depends what you’re looking for.   If you’re good with repetitious killing and looting sprees, and spending lots of time feeding yourself, repairing equipment and looking for the materials to achieve these, go for it.  I have a friend who has ground his way to near level 200 and is happy with the grind.  Never once has he recounted a memorable quest or encounter because that’s not what he’s looking for, and he’s probably never found one.  Every so often, one of the random drops gives him a legendary weapon which he likes.   That’s enough.  Will that be enough for you?
---
Heyharry, you online now? 
---
\*sigh\*  Thanks for the update.  I'll stop wasting my time up there and waste it somewhere else. :-)
---
I'd just be happy to have the fate of the Overseer confirmed...
---
Sounds like fun at least for a little while but there still needs to be some sort of goal to pvp otherwise it'll get boring fast. Fighting for ownership of the map would keep things interesting.
---
His comeback was that of someone who has no real comeback.
---
The Monongah one
---
Love the night view
---
Salt on all the nay sayers
---
Not until 6pm central 
---
Would you be providing info on private servers and modders at some point? 
---
You get it from turning in Tech Data for sure. I just got one from there, after buying one from another player.
---
If you're on Xbox I can sell it to you?
---
**If** you are disappointed with the current state of the game but excited for the roadmap you are arguably stupid because you are repeating the exact same mistake you made with the pre-release marketing spiel.
---
I fully expect this addition to be optional, so you should be able to decide if the benefits of going Legendary are worth whatever down sides exist. 
---
I thought it was going to be abandoned. Super glad to be wrong!
---
Maybe it's just me and a bug, but I've never had the overseer's quest disappear so I always figured we had more coming along that end, and Rose's Radio always felt like a quest giver station without content, yet.
---
My gosh that skull-faced one looks gorgeous. What an elegant piece of machinery. 
---
The way its worded tho. I hope its not loot boxes ;-;
---
 What I'm gonna do with All Rise. I will carry it around, its light, and the first person who responds to my mic will be offered it. ;)
---
 I will do this till its gone.
---
I dont think anyone is having a big problem with those CAMPs...what we are talking about is a very simple platform with nothing on it but a row of turrets places so the fire through the second story windows and first floor doors. They have no purpose except to take kills from actual players. They do not gain XP or loot for the builder, they're just another grief mechanic. 
---
I, personally, keep a low level alt with nothing on it but a bunch of orbital grenades. If the torrent platforms are valid play style then so is my suicide bomber. 👍😂
---
Try verifying the game files
---
SHHHHHHHHh Don't say that word....
---
Well, i guess it's pure random, since i know a guy who gets one after completing events for like 2 days.
---
doubt this will ever be a thing. Sony doesn't want to allow cross platform play.
---
I clicked just for funsies, and the top post?
---

Great. Can't unread that. Thanks random Redditor!
---
OMG YES, this sounds so good
---
Awesome, thank you! I will add it to the BoS section :).
---
Ahh man i might still be up, thank you. Whats your GT? 
---
So it's not going to be free to play anytime soon.
---
that's what I guessed, based on the goatish figure in the graphic.
---
woah I think I just learned a bunch of Fallout 4 exploits from this thread. I wish I had thought of some of these things that seem so obvious
---
This has been my experience for the most part, so while I want so badly to love the game it's become more love-hate 
---
Well, at least cross-progression. Sony kinda allows it, I just want to see that.
---
We know. But no needy parade poop. 
---
We’re excited because it surpassed anything we imagined 
---
So you climbed ON the launch day hate wagon without actually buying the game? 
---
"working" from home. 😉
---
FFS, they're different games. I know it's cool to shit on EA/ BioWare right now but it really doesn't matter. People want to play Anthem and like it? Good. If you feel like FO76 was better at launch, then good for you? 
---
Trying too hard for cool points. 
---
IF things are implemented well
---
Did you try killing the enemies? If so, did they keep ignoring you. I keep hoping someone would test this out when it happens.
---
**[EVERYBODY LOVED THAT]**
---
Perhaps it could but time will tell I think right now that honor still belongs to Final Fantasy 14.
---
Harry Wagstaff 
---
Not trying parade poop 
---
Just voicing my own tentative excitement :P 
---
My guess is that the game didn’t figure out how to disperse the loot between the party? So it just didn’t have any at all instead, that’s shitty regardless tho dude. 
---
 I kill em' for food myself. ;) Still, that's fucked! 
---
I know right?!?!? I can’t wait for sheer terror. The cryptids is what definitely drew me to this game because I love anything about cryptids. They’re so interesting 
---
Can someone clarify what backpacks add? Carry weight?
---
I just hope the ‘mysterious Purveyor’ is not like Graham. I’ve been playing since the first week and I’ve still never seen him. 
---
Fair. I took that part out
---
I see what ya did there...
---
Open the map, wander to places and check everything out.
---
Hell, my camp is open-air, under a bridge... it's a sleeping bag, a stash box, a campfire and a cooking station. I tried to keep it as much like a "camp" as I could. I craft and breakdown my stuff when I find stations. 
---
I'm loving it. This playstyle isn't gonna make me anything special, but it sure is fun. 
---
 Fuck cheevos! ;)
---
I wonder how it'll play out!
---
I got given a copy, I might actually try it soon.
---
That's definite improvement
---
One of the main problems in fo76 is the complete lack of good weapons with 100% drop rates.  
---
All rise is probably the best individual weapon you are guaranteed to get via a quest, beyond that it's just trash.  
---
Fo4 for example had a ton of very solid, high end guns available either via merchants or from quests that anyone could easily obtain.  Keep in mind fo4 only had "1 star" legendaries, you could never get more than 1 legendary effect on a single weapon.  Off the top of my head there was a 2 shot combat rifle (2 shot was never nerfed and is still a very strong effect in fo4), an explosive sub machine gun, a furious handmade, chameleon armor pieces, and many more.
---
I think your budget DOES increase, but I don't know how. 
---
Turrets soak up a bunch of your budget. 
---
If you have saved or blueprinted items in your building plans that you don't intend to use, scrap them. They count against your budget. 
---
Oh man this post is incredible. Finally something that makes me want to play again. Legendary characters sounds like such a cool mechanic as well. 
---
Wait you weren’t hoarding everything already?   Must just be me.  
---
 I'm very intrigued about the nuclear winter  
---
 I got em' but I have not seen them in quite a while. I have a Dense mod too and it disappeared as well.
---
I need a heat system. Gotta sit by the campfire to achieve 100% warmth. Then you loose warmth as you wander in the Nuclear winter. Sounds pretty fun. 
---
I straight told a teen that was proud of his turret camp behind the gold club that I would have destroyed his camp if it was a nuke zone
---
If you do this, then you need to figure out a way to build a giant claw dangling over it.
---
Still waiting on that hotfix to repair Adrenal Reaction
---
O.o. I've learned 3 things from this thread.... what else have we been missing out on thats been out in the open.
---
Oh thank god. You had me worried. 
---
That could be the difference honestly. I try to stack Armor Pen for that reason, but the flechette rounds just seem so enticing. Especially on the Poon. 
---
I’m like the opposite end up the spectrum. Queen is cake, mass of Ghouls is much more challenging. 
---
Well you did just start playing. Get back to me next week lol. I really hope you like it. I don't, but I'm REALLY looking forward to the updates coming this year and I'll probably reinstall for Wild Appalachia. 
---
From a BETA PvE only player who has never duped or griefed but still plays daily, thank you Bethesda for listening to the community and giving us a lot to get excited about
---
Patrolling the wasteland makes you wish for a nuclear winter
---
Radioactive snow?   Having to dress in rad-resistant layers?  Arc’teryx product placement opportunities abound.  
---
Characters and memorable quests aren't really the reason I play Fallout, to be honest. Of course, I can remember characters and any big things that happen in the game, but I wouldn't say there's that many memorable quests for me. I know that's a controversial take, but hey ho! For me, I just enjoy exploring the world. So if the world is engaging then I'm happy. 
---
Also the use of "Shear" Terror.  haha
---
Love it. Will do this anytime I see one
---
thx
---
Can we pin this on the sub
---
Would love to see the maximum height increased too! With the "build depth" I wish I could stop trying to find tree branches, etc. to place my camp on to eek out some extra height.
---
Or, keep it in place but add tunnel halls, bunker rooms so we can make our own rad vaults in the underground space!
---
"Thanks for using our free labor after selling us an unfinished product, only to make an effort to fix it when outrage affected sales."

Flatwoods - Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Center
---
Until a permanent fix is issued, I already found a workaround, and tried to spread it through this reddit.
---
When you get the rotating loot thing, just drop ANY ITEM, I usually drop a grenade or a piece of food, then the wheel stops and loot is displayed on every corpse wich you have damaged in the last minutes.
---
I hope this serves you for your next SBQ run ;)
---
Possible privacy concerns.
---
Either way, he has released an update, with a new version coming in a couple days 
---
This was basically the only thing I was missing. This is awesome.
---
I observed without contributing; I can honestly say i wrote nothing against the game nor told anyone to avoid it. I don’t buy games in the first several months as a rule, but after their content announcement and the multiple fixes I feel confident enough to make the purchase. 
---
Seeing as they were in a workshop under attack, that's a silly place to level. I intended to help a few people farming resources out by killing a nuisance, and get the shared quest reward. All they had to do was ask me not to shoot the crickets. They all had mikes. But they said nothing until AFTER they tried to bait me into combat and I contested the workshop. Yes, I trolled the hell out of them afterward. But they could have asked me to leave or given up at ANY time and ended it. The thought never even crossed their minds. And there were so many smart ways they could have found and killed me easily that they didn't use, especially after there were 5 of them, 2 near or above my level, and a guy with the same chameleon gear as me who would have known perfectly well how it worked and how to counter it. But they didn't do any of those smart, reasonable things. Which is how they became a funny story about folly and overkill...
---
Very mature👎
---
They said late 2019. This roadmap is only for one hundred days
---
You'll get used to it. My record: four in a row.
---
The choices will determine how the NPC's will treat you, nothing will impact the NPC's world view. So in the case of a new faction the way you progress through the quest line will decide how you will be able to interact with them and likely even what items unique to them you have access to through a merchant.    
---
&amp;nbsp; Ya well that's just like, my opinion man.
---
Right? Surprised and happy about the no-bullshit admittance of mistakes made and a real look into the future of this game instead of vauge crap. Solid. Hopefully they deliver. 
---
It doesnt increase btw
---
A slow clap would mean sarcasm and something negative but you only voiced praise thought I’d point that out 
---
It might be an unpopular opinion, but I feel like the addition of NPCs at a later date was in the plans from the very beginning. 
---
I think of it as story telling. It's made clear that nothing can survive and thrive until the scorched are dealt with. 
---
With them out of the way, it opens the way for the story to continue evolving, aka the reintroduction of humans into the wasteland that ARENT from vault 76. 
---
its the only way to do significant damage when there is an entire team sitting on their turret camp. Got killed every time but they were pissed off and kept doing angry emotes
---
I've had three since the last patch at the munitions factory. 2 lvl 50 SB's each time. Their sonic attacks and acid gas clips through walls/ceilings, and damages **everything**.
---
The second time, they appeared while my workshop was being contested by multiple people (4 at once), so by the time I was able to clear the raiders, and then deal with the SOB's, there was literally not a door, stashbox, or built item remaining.
---
It was a friggin' **disaster**.
---
*hopefully*
---
I don't understand why you took the time to respond lol
---
I'd go so far as to argue we will start seeing "humans" as early as the Nuclear Winter patch what with the Vault raids.
---
Yes there is
---
Fingers cross for a Karma system. 
---
I crave negative karmaaaaaaa. 
---
I haven't been able to play 76 in the 2 months I've owned it
---
Sounds like it’ll be a good fit for you!  Go for it!!   There’s a lot of world to explore and it’s a lot more stable than even last month.  Not perfect, but probably “good enough”.
---
...Are you part of the guild I'm in? You pretty much described me...
---
" People. People never change. " - Ron Perlman (kinda). 
---
Holy crap. They care about and listen to the player base that keeps their game relevant. Wish more studios did that. *looking at you, DICE*
---
I was a water farmer in FO4. Currently have 650,000 caps and 26,000 water. In 76 it’s a lot harder with the camp size limits.....growing tatos is decent green thumb gives you 2 per and they sell for two caps.
---
Well, I don't know why he bought two copies, though years ago I had two computers to play an MMO (I played both at the same time). I spoke recently to a guy who had two accounts in FO76. There are reasons that would surprise you. But also, keep in mind that FO76 had some deep sales as well fairly soon after launch. Bottom line is I have no clue why he was running two accounts, how much he paid, whether he is running one or two computers, but from personal experience, I know a lot of people dual box online games.
---
Want to know why I think it's possible he was flagged incorrectly? All he had was ammo. If someone were duping, I'd expect them to be duping more than that. God-tier weapons and armor, nuka cola, fluxes, other junk, rare plans and outfits. But ammo? And yes, I know that a lot of it was ultracite, but still, if you're going to dupe for profit, raw materials for said ammo makes far more sense than ammo itself.
---
It seems to me that the Wood Armor Folk and the Chainsaw Clan would be natural enemies.
---
When you load up the game, what is the first thing you do normally? 
---
I've only found one off of the dead body of a Grafton Monster, in that little valley by Charleston. Pretty sure it's a a random drop, since I found it on the fifth one I killed.
---
I've specifically based my belief that we aren't intended to use mules, not on TOS/EULA, but on the design of the game itself. E.g. the lack of a "trade with other chars" menu, and the implementation of a +1500 hard cap.
---
Not sure people are understanding what I mean by the latter: the game is unplayable with +1500 carry weight, so a hard cap was never needed for main characters. Mules on the other hand could be infinitely over-encumbered and still useful. Thus the hard cap really only affects them. And I don't buy that it was to combat duping; they handled that by eliminating duplicate rare items from all inventories.
---
blocked off from one of the new factions if you side with a different one maybe.
---
I am level 15 or so - still so much to explore. I am sure at some point if I have visited everything it would get old but I guess I have a long way to go for that. Especially if they are adding new content. 
---
These are nuts, Bethesda have really stepped up the quality of the skins! The black one with the skull is probs my favourite, but getting some strong Nurgle vibes from the green X01
---
Just did no luck 
---
How do you patch something \*out of game\*?  Literally 100% of patches are "in-game."  
---
What you \*meant\* to say, was a "live" patch. But you didn't actually say that. Don't blame me for your own fuckups. I quoted exactly what you said.  Not my fault you're too stupid to understand the terminology of what you're talking about.
---
Wait till june
---
Can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs! After I eat a couple of delicious omelets, I will seek absolution. 
---
What seems to be the problem? 
---
You gain more health and I think slightly more carry weight every time you level up
---
I'd always say to give a game a chance. I still enjoy Fallout 76, even though I am aware of the problems. The worst glitches I've encountered have been server issues, and I've been in since Beta. Plus, they do seem committed to updating the game. It's especially enjoyable with friends.
---
Possibly, but based on what people have uncovered from glitching into the Vaults, I’m willing to bet the inhabitants of Vaults 94 &amp; 96 are long dead.
---
If you don't mind me asking - what is the point of having so many characters? 
---
I never use it. I’m only level 29 though. I’m just not a fan
---
You might want to try over on /r/fo76bazaar, but I doubt you'll get anyone to bite at that price. You can find T60 parts all over the place for free, and the plans for the torso are only like 400 caps, so someone could easily build it themselves for less than half of what you're charging.
---
[Don't call it a comeback...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vimZj8HW0Kg)
---
the game is fun, while you take it easy many of us spend all the content very fast 
---
but I've played almost 300 hours 
---
As a player who bought the game at launch but took a step back a few months ago when things started to get stale, this is exactly the news I was waiting for. 
---
My excitement is renewed to pick my character up, get back into the wasteland, and get myself equipped for endgame content. See everyone soon!
---
If you can get it for $40 or under, I think the answer is 100% yes. If you loved FO4, you should have fun with 76.
---
And im still waiting for a fucking reply. I want to know what specificly I did for the suspension. Im curious if others are waiting on status updates as well. How can you just ignore tickets in your queue. I played every beta session. And about 5 hours a night after work and 8 hrs on the weekends. I love game.There is a lot of things that need to be fixed. Im not even mad, I just want a bloody reply.
---
I have a bunch of 3* in my stash I'll hang onto, but 1*? No way.
---
These look like they're Warhammer 40k chaos mods. 
---
Wait, what are we talking about, was there an update I missed?
---
*has brotherhood flair*
---
We are already in the nuclear summer. Nuclear winter will just be GTA online in snow mode.
---
Ok will do
---
A ton of bugs that were responsible of the negative reviews have been fixed. Regardless the game was generally fun for me even with all the bugs. At times though it was very frustrating and pushed me to take short breaks a few times
---
I run nerd rage 3 for 20% more dmg, demo 1, and first aid 1. Gives me a lot more dmg than demo 5 haha.
---
* Has BOS Flair *
---
Exactly. 
---
*Has BOS Flair*
---
I’m definitely going to be optimizing my stash space to make room for saving some legendaries now 
---
I wonder if that greyed out NEW FEATURES for Wastelanders = automatrons!
---
As long as the south lawn is still available I don’t really care. My camp is right above the snake icon on the map, on the one super flat fairway, usually missed by nukes but right outside Whitesprings. 
---
The game definitely has its negative but I'm a true believer that every game deserves a chance to see it's positives and negatives from your own eyes, I personally would not recommend the game this late into it. A tip of advance is that once you hit lv 50 the game is truly over with the main story being nothing but robots talking to you and you going on quest for dead people it's truly sad, I bought the game when it came out mainly for the veiws and beauty of the game itself. The multiplayer is definitely a plus but has it's many downfalls such as your basically promised 2 crashes a day at least. That's just my opinion though. Like I said everything deserves a chance.
---
Had some of a reply filled out but I stopped caring half way though. Believe what you want to believe honestly I don't give a shit anymore.   
---
If you say it is so easy to do then live stream from youtube or twitch video proof of how easy it is to acquire that ammo and how you could easily mass produce it to over 360,000 rounds. Provide solid proof not just words.  
---
Agreed!! I check my Bethesda.net app every other day to check for content updates. I did find end-game a bit stale but loved the game otherwise, so was super keen on any new updates to draw me back.
---
This roadmap delivered on that completely! So many things to look forward to! and even though none of it is out RIGHT now, I am excited enough for it all that I will be getting back on to start the grind again in anticipation!! (and to continue showing my support for the game &lt;3)
---
I'll try this next time, thanks
---
I’m on Xbox, and I’ll put things in world containers and rejoin the server using the social tab and another player. It’s risky but I’ve never had any issue and I’ve done it over a hundred times.
---
Thats what give me hope thag it can be a decent game especially when they are committed to try to fix their problems even if they fuck up they still try.
---
Fill me in
---
This. Period.
---
TL;DR -  I am over 150 with over 600 hours into the game. You can check me all you want. (LoL, watch me get banned now)
---
As of last night I have over 610 hours into the game (I love Fallout sue me). I am level 170somthin (I stopped looking at my level). Been playing since first day of beta. I have never used an exploit that I am aware of. I know about the duping and xp exploits but I honestly don't know how they were done. I never cared to look them up. I can tell you that in all my hours of playing I have never had more than 3k rounds of ammo for any given weapon. I haven't looked at my ammo in awhile. My 10mm may be pretty high. I've never used it. I have to make ammo everyday. I've never had any ultricite ammo. It's to expensive to make and from what I've read it's not worth the extra damage. My main weapon for most of that time was a level 5 explosive  shotgun and an armor piercing explosive revolver (I had no intentions of ever running a shotgun/pistol character but here we are). I found both of them. I even remember where I got them. I got the Shotgun a long time ago while doing Leader of the Pack. And the revolver was from a nuke zone. They both don't work very well since the nerf so I am now using a bloodied handmade, bloodied Tesla rifle and a bloodied pickax. Tesla rifles are a lot of fun. I forgot where I was going with all this. I'm just bored at work and felt like rambling on here with you guys. Just read the TL;DR.  I gave you an up vote cause why not. Okay bye.
---
How bout we put a spotlight on the lever action
---
the REAL king of rifles
---
Just bear with it.  The lag spike will be obear soon.
---
Don't bother with turrets, they attract enemies. Decide if you want big structure or lived in camp, work accordingly. I usually do three or four builds on a spot before I'm happy with the result. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuEPID8RSc4) is a base about 10% under budget, my current one is at max with a larger footprint.
---
If you have the plans for a fusion generator and the small water purifier, a piece of open ground with few obstructions, and some time on your hands - you can pull up quite a bit of purified groundwater aka liquid gold.
---
The purifiers only hold two water at a time but they refill pretty quickly.  Also you can build them at workshops - so you won't even need to spend your own materials setting up water farms.
---
Turrets are 10-15% of your budget - EACH.  Lights are expensive, Brahmin pen is expensive, tamed creatures are expensive.  Everything else is between 1/6 - 1% each.
---
I dont. I find terminal hacking fun and lock picking doesnt take much effort.
---
Im excited by alot of this really hopeful for wastelanders and the vaults
---
Eh, if you dont dislike the premise of the game there is at least 100 hours of content there, and if you do dislike it, extra content isn't going to change much.
---
Wow, March 12th, nice birthday gift! 
---
Maybe you will only be able to choose a certain faction to help and each faction will have different perks, quests, and exclusive locations that you can only gain if you join said faction. This would also increase the games replayability.
---
Like you, I find most of my pvp through workshops. 
---
Pvp aside for a moment,
---
The point of a bounty allowing everyone to have the first clean shot is a sort of punishment to discourage bad behavior. That is the intention of the bounty design. Ok, that said, the workshop owner faces the same circumstances under the coat of a workshop. 
---
It is unbalanced, and discouraging all together. Furthermore, it is even boring for us pvp players. I love a fight that drags along with it seeking revenge and goes on for an hour of sweaty pvp. 
---
While I understand your point of view, we both can not deny that it is unfair as it is, unless the workshop owner has an equal capability to opt in to the fight, rather than being a sitting duck awaiting the mercy of the attacker.
---
This. I haven't played for weeks, this will get me playing again. Hell, I'll login for a couple of hours tonight to try and start gathering legendaries.
---
I'm having a   level 155, level 105, level 53, level 31 and level 23 Charakter. Guess how far on level I could have become of I would focus on just one Charakter^^
---
Ok thanks
---
Lol FO76 has already received more bug patches than any other Bethesda game
---
You obviously didn’t read the whole thing. Each of the three big updates are going to be done in stages that are basically a week or two apart.
---
lel it's like you people are in an abusive relationship
---
I've been wanting this since the BETA. Thanks a lot for this and the roadmap. As you can probably tell, this subreddit appreciates it, as do I.
---
I've got a couple screenshots like this but this one takes the Cake lol.
---
As a grown up I get mad about grown up things.... Like showing up to work and having to do things that should have been done 6 hours ago &gt;o 
---
I'm not pissed off about this game because I've thoroughly enjoyed my 200+ hours in it, and each patch made it even better.
---
Yea still having to requip weapons into my hands half the time. Annoying switching weapons in the middle of a battle  and just getting your fists 
---
That's cool I guess? The joke is still relevant regardless?
---
you would get wanted and attract bounty hunters lol.
---
I think coding that would be more complicated than just integrating the dialogue system from 4, obviously with no voiced character and full text shown like in mods
---
Yes it was UNFATHOMABLE /s
---
Should really hold off until they start implementing the content before you go full drone.
---
I'll DM you
---
Hahahaha this guy gets it!
---
They could use some educatin', that's for sure. haha
---
I assume you meant "3 weeks" and not "3 months?"
---
I'm more impressed because despite the rocky start, things are looking up.  The duper item deletion was a turning point for sure.  Patch 6 wasn't terrible.  And now a very thorough, well thought out plan like this tells me things are moving forward well.  Sure there will be problems, but it feels all up from here.
---
A lot of the criticism 76 gets is founded. However, most people still talking shit about 76 have no current experience with the game and only want to perpetuate the hate. Those popular sensationalist YouTube videos are made by people who have not played the game in nearly 100 days. There are even people who frequent this subreddit that admit to quitting the game months ago.
---
Things are better than they were at launch. Server stability does feel 300% better. It leads me to believe most disconnects people experiences and complained about at launch were due to dupers. Once they were gone, things improved. That raises the question, do we blame Bethesda Austin for making a game with an exploit in it or do we blame the person actively exploiting and ruining the game for others? 
---
Completely understand. I was just about to buy Anthem tomorrow and start that expedition. This roadmap just saved me $60 because now I have this new found energy to play  perfecting my build/camp.
---
I didnt even see that you will be able to place stash items in your camp. Im in love. That takes me another few hours making my camp finally lived in. Im HYPED! 
---
That or reputation, with either one other players would be able to tell if they can trust you or not
---
Should be in the google link in the OP. Metal armor is generally considered Raider armor so you should be able to find it among those vendors.
---
wow... wish I could turn back time... :(
---
I think they should reduce the amount of space lights take and increase the amount of space turrets take. 
---
(Fuck Whitespring Bases)
---
.
---
What platform and what lvl? If you're on pc, I can give you some gear.
---
For your camp location, think practical; see where your main/side missions are and find something around there. Don't overthink it or spend too much time looking for THE perfect spot because you can always move it again.
---
If you want legendary weapons and armor, do events and daily missions that pop up and don't run away when a higher lvl person waves you over. 
---
No i never disagreed. I like the idea of the WS owner declaring a "defend" when someones on their land and having the ability to strike the first blow. See above. I said that in my first comment. 
---
What i dont like is the highest upvoted comment in the thread about being able to opt out of pvp if you own a shop with a "surrender" option. Fucking pve crowd wants to ruin everything. 
---
Using terminology like that over and over makes you seem like a... What do you incels call it? An NPC?
---
What I said I said was they need in game tools to reset quests and fix bugged NPCs while the servers are live. **JUST LIKE ANY MMO IN THE HISTORY OF MMOs**. 
---
That way, in the event someone submits a ticket for support, they can help said person who submitted a ticket in game. 
---
PATCHES were not mentioned in my post. Not even once. But "fix" was mentioned. As in, reset, as in correct an issue through similar means of console commands. It doesn't PATCH the problem, but it fixes it for the individual who submitted a ticket. Apparently to you they mean the exact same thing and you have no concept of what a Game Master does.
---
But go ahead and keep the insults flowing though. Every time you reply to me, your inability to grasp concepts of an MMO...or even the English language for that matter...continue to shine through.
---
I'm guessing we'll still have minor adjustments sprinkled between.     What  we've been getting for the last 3 months are mostly patches and tweaks to more broken pieces. 
---
 They're still aware of stuff like energy weapons being  lackluster, and that'll hopefully still be one of the unspoken things we see some changes for soon.
---
I don't think so. This says Legendary Vendor - May 23: [https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/2Pwi3u1kb40vRewpUAwZMJ/4a7cba4903fede3ec7975fa14c4e9fc5/Fallout76\_WildAppalachia\_Roadmap\_FINAL.png](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/2Pwi3u1kb40vRewpUAwZMJ/4a7cba4903fede3ec7975fa14c4e9fc5/Fallout76_WildAppalachia_Roadmap_FINAL.png)
---
No. More loot for us.
---
Versus them releasing it all day 1 and everyone hitting a wall instantly then complaining again?  Drip feed increases engagement, much smarter move.
---
Greedy fucker XD
---
What do you know about the backpacks? 
---
Which does not equate to weekly updates. 
---
They say they have one update planned per season (which may be split up into smaller patches each week). 
---
That is not the same as weekly consistent content updates. 
---
If you disagree, fine, but 6 months from now, come back to me if they have had 26 separate content updates. 
---
It won't happen. Instead, each big update will be broken down into 3 or 4 patches per season, each season is 3 months, which is NOT weekly content. 
---
Plus, it doesn't matter as much to me how long it takes for content. Like, it should be soon, and not like a year out, but I have other games to fill in the time between updates. I'd rather them take the time needed to push quality. Since they didn't before launch.
---
I like where your going on this and agree, especially the banking of stars part.
---
I ignore almost all locks and terminals except doors and interesting terminals.
---
Im just to lazy to do it sometimes i dont even lockpic 0 skill locks. 
---
Thank you haha! This was a fun photo shoot!
---
They didnt say that there would be no human NPCs ever though.
---
I'm personally praying there will be.
---
I think it was a good decision for the Scorched ark but past that storyline, it doesn't make much sense to me. 
---
Appalachia is a whole state full of resources of all sorts completely left untouched. Someones oughta travel in at some point to claim what never was.
---
Hope out of you're power armor and start swinging that death claw at 4k+ dmg with meduim atk speed, far from under powered. 
---
I've tried that using a full set of +@% rad resist armor piece, diluted RadX, a RadShield, and sharing Rad Sponge level 3 with a team of 4 people. I still took rads faster than it could heal me.
---
&gt;had to be killed to be saved
---
There is something deep in that one line! 
---
Lmao.😂
---
As someone who solely follows this sub to watch the constant agony and baffling defense of Bethesda’s boundless incompetence, I am confused by what you hoped to achieve with this particular comment. 
---
 This too. Narrow 3 is the only one that isn't gigantic.  And none are symmetrical..
---
Well I know what I have to do now.  Gonna have to get injured in a few weeks so I can stay home and get my 900 hours in now that this awesome roadmap is out!  Can anyone recommend a good pair of slippery shoes?
---
Stash items are on their roadmap so they might reduce cost and/or expand the budget. Otherwise you couldnt place all the nifty little things. 
---
Pharma Farm Rank 3, Butchers Bounty Rank 3 for Tick Blood+Chemist+Super Duper Rank 3 to make Blood Packs and then use those to make Stimpaks.
---
Butchers Bounty hunting for Ticks, usually get 4-6 Tick Blood per group of them
---
2 Tick Blood+Chemist = 2 Blood Packs (4 if Super Duper kicks in)
---
2 Blood Packs+Chemist = 4 Stimpaks (8 if Super Duper kicks in)
---
Oh wow, I read "March 23!"
---
Yeah that's quite a ways away! That'll be a problem.
---
Super duper perk is a huge help as well
---
Huh!  It's not impossible that one of those updates could actually draw me in.  I like the teasers about new modes "and more".
---
I feel like if I took a personality test I'd end up on the grid between Brotherhood and Minutemen, tending slightly toward Brotherhood. 
---
No. If it's in your inventory or your stash, and you need cloth, it will auto scrap your cash.
---
Judging by the way it's worded, it sounds like you can pick the legendary mods you want on a weapon and each star you give him raises like 2% to get that specific weapon or if you fail that chance, you get nothing.
---
I’ve been collecting teddy bears - waiting for the day Bethesda would let me put them on a shelf inside my camp. 
---
Pencils are an underrated source of lead.
---
It’s totally not a stupid request. I’d be annoyed too  if this was the only trophy keeping me from getting platinum. Thank god it worked for me
---
When I'm scrounging I use a different set of perks than when I'm fighting. And crafting is a different set of perks again. It's so convenient to just click a single key and switch between them. Once you use it, you really miss it when it's gone.
---
There is a lot to look forward to.  I am really happy to have custom Backpacks, I can finally wear something besides Civil War uniforms. Next more headgear with lights.
---
Damn man... You're super serial
---
In before some moron misuses the word "entitled."
---
It would be cool if the paint job worked on a few more things.
---
I liked the posters but would've really appreciated a statue small enough to place on displays. 
---
Isn’t it more likely that that’s the goatman or whatever it’s called?
---
"Pressing the Quick Swap key (Default: Left D-pad) after the current weapon breaks now correctly swaps to an alternate weapon."
---
This does not seem to be the case for me. I play on Xbox One. When trying to switch after a weapon broke I suddenly didn't have a secondary weapon attached. In addition to that, my secondary weapon detached itself multiple times after switching severs to join my friend. 
---
Some of them are actually animated already. I wonder why they bothered to do that with only a few
---
Didn't the South Park guys apologize because man-bear-pig was not satirical as they were actual climate change deniers?
---
I look forward to staying Satan this coming Spring.
---
I'm super cereal why isn't anyone listening to me
---
agreed, the workshop is considered as a platform for pvp, meaning whoever decides to claim, is already submitting to pvp. An option to surrender is already in place if they run away. The pvp removes icons from the map, so once the contesting begins, if they just leave the area, within 30 minutes (Or 15) the game makes them white again if no engagement occurs.
---
I have had this happen a few times where the workshop owner just abandons the place without a fight, and then later on, I find them white on the map.
---
FO76 does have a huge pve dedicated playerbase as the games main design was pve from uts previous titles, although fo76 harboured in a wild west flavorish pvp system that a pvper could get hooked on.
---
Well I walked away from the game in November plan to possibly go back in may, but with the division 2 out in a few weeks it will have to wait until then
---
My first thought was active nuke zones on the map.  Maybe moving like clouds and making everything irradiated as they go.  Who knows though?
---
I hope its not limited to certain items. Whatever junk, no matter how obscure, *someone* will want to use it as a decoration.
---
"Another camp needs our help. I marked it on your map"
---
I assume there would be just a bunch around white springs like a red light district on the golf course.
---
Meh, I can't trust a single word a duper says, and I really don't care about the answers anyway.  Garbage people are garbage people.
---
I wonder how we'll keep people from stealing our orgy bears.
---
Wow that's professional trolling.
---
Ha ha ha. Can you imagine the shit people are going to be hoarding, because of this. OMG Bethesda.
---
Oh and better, it's still mostly going to be RNG. So you bring in 1000 one stars and you get stalkers +50 limb damage golf club. So much lol when it hits live and peoples expectations face reality.
---
I would hope once they’re there no one else can move them. 
---
Considering the price, its worth a shot. What always comes to my mind in threads like this, is how others could judge if you'd enjoy something without in depth knowledge of your personality.
---
LOL! Exact same scenario actually... I mean, I might still buy Anthem eventually, but now I'll definitely be waiting for it to go on sale. Between WoW, uni &amp; this, I think my time will be plenty occupied!
---
Time to try and get all these recipes for the mutations or whatever I think =P
---
camden park, but not 100% chance of ticks, also dome structure in the mires
---
Will 3* wood armor be worthwhile now? 🤔
---
&gt;What I said was they need in game tools to reset quests and fix bugged NPCs while the servers are live.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;JUST LIKE ANY MMO IN THE HISTORY OF MMOs  
---
&gt;.
---
That's literally not how it works in other MMOs though. Those quests and NPCs are not reset while the servers are live. They're reset at downtime.   
---
Honestly, have you ever even played an online game before? This must be your first.  Because you clearly have not the slightest clue how any of it works.   
---
But lol at your pathetic attempt to insult my English language skills, guy who got into this argument because he couldn't communicate properly and doesn't understand the terminology and nomenclature involved. 
---
Yeah probably, I don't know much about American folklore so your guess if probably better than mine
---
Be offended then. Here's a tip for you: the internet can be an offensive place, you may wan to steer clear.
---
Everytime I launch the game I am either unable to find a world, or I get frozen and kicked when it loads me in
---
and super duper !
---
you can create tons of bullets in a short time 
---
BEAUTIFUL 
---
I know, I was only joking (hear that, you downvoter!!).
---
The animated cards you have, are the gold cards you get from the card packs every 5 levels.
---
Vault bedding and mattress at the very least. 
---
&gt;TL;DR Not only are you extremely wrong, you are mathematically deficient.
---
Wow, I was gonna upvote for the sheer math you took the time to complete, until you became a massive douche canoe.
---
I'm hoping for the end game vault grind to be something worth while. Vending will also be a nice touch. And now we wait.
---
Plausible, but having to contend with the semi-constant nukings that place gets might put some people off.
---
haha
---
Honestly their main problem was that they seriously managed expectations poorly.  If they'd called the first few months Early Access they'd be getting accolades.
---
"Wastelanders" certainly seems like it's adding some actual NPCs if I'm reading it right. The barrenness of the game is what's keeping me away, so I have a little hope. We'll see though.
---
Oh god. Hadn't thought of that...
---
Thank god
---
 As are Tin Cans and Combination Wrenches. One Tin Can trap is 9 lead. ;)
---
Oh I see, I never even noticed there was gold and non gold cards
---
I don't understand why some people play this game.  The way they talk, they want a standard shooter where it's easy to get good weapons, they never have to worry about caps/ammo/maintenance, and basically just want to run around and kill stuff while walking over ammo and health packs.  The very idea of having to go find junk/components causes them to recoil in disgust.  I just don't get why they play this game when they could go to Far Cry: New Dawn to get a streamlined shooter experience.
---
I just want the hunters hood back
---
Great minds think alike!
---
Yeah I think so, they later apologised I think for making a mockery of it so much, and I think they've lately done another episode where Man-Bear-Pig is real and they admit they were wrong to have ignored Al Gore
---
I’m just giving my two cents, it would be very fitting for the world. As I remember reading about it back when I was in middle school and being so interested in it, would be very cool to see.
---
Looks like the project plan BGS just published grants my wish (in part) regarding vendors. I think having CAMP vendors as well as creating a central marketplace, in each server or a separate market/auction site hosted by Bethesda also makes sense.  Giving us lots of options on how to liquidate our inventory will also help with the stash size issue.
---
Oooooh… No spoilers pl0x. But I can just hope that the Vaults are not yet completed or something =P
---
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised... or else why would we be "raiding" them. I am just saying there is a CHANCE that some inhabitants might be alive or escape or something. I just want some twisted freaky fucked up shit to be goin down in them vaults. Exploring them in previous games was always so damn cool, the experiments and stories being told within each individual vault is one of the most interesting parts of any Fallout game!
---
Notice the scale of that thing...
---
I can't share more information on this until we're closer. Stay tuned :)
---
 I'd wait till you have Heavy Combat before doing that. ;)
---
That's a good point, maybe around 76? I just assume that there will be a place the community comes up with as a shopping spot.
---
So, is the Mechanic Jumpsuit is rare? 
---
About a year from the release i think
---
Where I come from, the slow clap means something is better than plain applause.
---
yes! It is saved as a past broadcast on both mixer and twitch
---
One of the worst launches, but it will redeem itself with all this content
---
You online now?
---
Nope
---
No biggie!  That'll be neat.  
---
They would have done all the same stuff anyway.  Lazy cheaters always look for an excuse.  If someone points out how they are harming other players, they just blame the developer.
---
Its worse than we all thought it was....
---
Slide pushes things forward and backwards, and scale makes things bigger
---
I didn’t think so. But I saw it on the list with a 0.25% chance so I was curious. Maybe I’m doing it wrong! 🤣
---
Probably gonna have a hard time driving your car up the stairs and into the garage. But other than that this looks spectacular. Fits in really well.
---
Finally i can tickle people with my ripper-tickler. 
---
I bought the power armor edition and I would rather they occasionally do limited events to keep up the player base / reward active players.  It has dual gratification for existing / new players.  I simply want the game to last longer.
---
I don't know, honestly.  Just a knee-jerk reaction.  It's like they just got face fucked, swallowed the load, and said thank you.  Fucking mind boggling.  
---
Exclamation Marks!!! No but in all seriousness,  I'm excited for what's to come,  especially the Legendary Survivor system!
---
I think that being decorative is primarily what people want though. Now there is a reason to collect all of the teddy bears, or all of the robot models, etc. Maybe even nuka cola and bobble head displays, etc. Hopefully it allows us to place and display lots of things.
---
They give you legendary loot far more often than they don't, so that's BS.
---
I was. Sorry it's just gone. People REALLY wanted that Lead lol
---
I know you can wear them on your back and they typically increase carry weight in video games. They also look deeply wastelandish.
---
HEY! Maybe I LIKE little piles of [commie commemorative pins!](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Red_star_pin_(Fallout_76))
---
A neighbearhood! 
---
You can get it as a world drop
---
I already have it
---
They’re releasing npcs with wasteland we aren’t they
---
My thoughts exactly. Would love to have some finer details on how this works. 
---
I had crafting, combat and scrounging loadouts and working on a fourth for melee when the mod went kaput.
---
I already have it :).
---
It says something about inventory management. I’m curious to see if they have any kind of sorting improvement option to better categorize your stuff 
---
I see now. Only the Event/Daily Only are considered rare. Thanks for the info!
---
That's unbearable 
---
I agree.  Shit is way too bullet sponge as is,up everything else's damage potential.
---
&gt; Why do I even waste that much time and ammo on an SB with ABSOLUTELY no chance of a legendary when I can kill a fat ghoul with one strike and get a three star legendary on a good day. 
---
Good question.  I would ask *you* why you do that.  I'd also ask why you think scorchbeasts are designed to be loot pinatas, because they aren't, they are there for area denial and because the lore indicates they fly around and fuck everything up.  You don't have to read any more into it than that.
---
So, just stop killing them.
---
Oh yay.  So now when I make an excursion to WS i'll find a ton of vending machines outside the clubhouse, along side the turrets.
---
Should I start playing now?
---
this is a great point, if they are gonna let us place found items, they might just increase our limit!  fingers crossed!
---
No problem, just nice to have some for making .50 Cal ammo
---
You shouldn’t have i server hop in an online game just to level up, and choosing to do it can boost your levels much higher than the person who chooses not to do it. 
---
Alternatively, again, just kill everything. Even if it kills you, go back and kill it. Kill every living creature everywhere.
---
Yeah I agree completely with you
---
Teddy bears will suddenly have value
---
OMG I love you all.
---
Thank you. also someone please do that cat base Lady wants.
---
I also want to see it.
---
as if you won't replace them hundreds of times over in the ensuing months
---
I'm happy to help! I figured it out with a mongrel at Posieden stuck behind the doors.
---
How does one find guilds / clans for 76? I'm level 200+ with a 110 alt, 2 accounts, all I do is farm whitesprings all day... would love more competent / fun people to play with.
---
How about you earn your legendaries legit. Legendary loot isnt legendary if it's in mass quantity and everyone has it, then it's just an overpriced overpowered common item. 
---
Imagine the whole floor filled like a foot deep in bottles. They make noise as you walk through them.
---
That's exactly What I thought when I saw them!
---
Burn the heretics!
---
Probably, but still. Kind of frustrating. 
---
Like I am glad the vending is coming, but I have gotten rid of so much  I wish I still had to sell.
---
You mean forward like "outward" kinda? That makes sense, thanks!!
---
totally looks like Automatron-type features being hinted at
---
I was meaning the station. Like maybe they can only be placed at stations. Or something like that.
---
How much 50 cal you need? I can hook you up
---
The Monster silhouette has horns, so mutant ram?
---
no ordinary cooked dog.
---
PS. I changed mutation to Herbivore  and cooked soups and grass also give 5 radiation each
---
464 characters, two sentances. Do you think, or FEEL, that this is getting anywhere? Normally I'd just write few rude words to end the discussion when it's gone way off track several messages ago, but now I just want to give you a warning, 232 characters per sentence is a good sign of impending derailment.
---
Step one. It's far more likely that some kind of somewhat moddable or customizable servers could come, than they giving out the server executable.
---
Step two. From the above it follows that THEY continue to run the servers.
---
&gt;unlimited access to a companies internal servers
---
Like now? Or something else? What unlimited resources? You think some numb numb stuff like you could pass any arbitary code onto their server and they would happily run it. Hurr hurr you could pass a cryptominer to their servers and get free shit for nothing. Who the hell would expect that? Certainly not me. So what unlimited access? Be more specific.
---
THE PLAYERS are the ones that CAUSE the server load. And the players are already PAYING for the server load that they will cause.
---
Here's their roadmap I just noticed, haven't read it already. I did ctrl+f and then server. Couldn't find any reference to any servers of any kind.
---
Enjoy.
---
im pc tho :(
---
Lol, I wouldn't expect anybody else to. I've already got over 400 hours logged into my main account that I bought the power armor Edition for. However if it's that cheap then I wouldn't mind picking up another account to make muling easier.
---
I do ignore them, but it's actually better that they're separate cards rather than combined. That way, you don't have to remove 3 points worth of other cards, if you only need 1 point worth of Hacker/Lockpick.  
---
If you were able to, and had upgraded them to 3\* cards, then lets say you come across a Lvl 1 lock, you'd have to remove two additional perks, in order to fit it.   
---
Its the same reason why it's not actually a good idea to upgrade weapon skills beyond 1 star each on each card, unless you're permanently and totally committing to a build. 
---
Such wauw
---
There goes the trade market
---
I'm actually saddened by anthem's state because it makes things look grim for Bioware.  Even though their quality has dropped, it would suck to see them serial killed by EA.
---
At that level I move my camp around to be centrally located in relation to the areas that I am farming. When at higher levels I tend to just set it down in a cool looking place. All of that said it’s this is just a preference.
---
Oooooh, prestiging? I would have preferred just the straight-up ability to re-spec at like 100 or something, but this'll do. 
---
Forgive me if this is one of those ‘duh’ answers. Is it something you need to craft at a workbench?
---
Nuke it.
---
Mini-nuke it.
---
Experimental MIRV it.
---
Put Nuke Mines in it. Then Nuke them. 
---
It seems you only read like half the words i types
---
Wait you can open what?!
---
DUCT TAPE TUB
---
This is what I'm thinking it will be, yeah. Less consequences like "you left a crater where the Institute was and shot down the Prydwen" and more "this NPC/faction treats you differently" or "you get a different unique reward". And quests can still have multiple paths that lead to the same ultimate end point.
---
I FOUND THE CHILD
---
Well, that seems like the thing that needed to be fixed, not what they did. It should just flag you for PVP not give you wanted.
---
Why not build your camp over a swimming pool (hypothetical suggestion) and fill it with pre war monies? Go big man.
---
what is the point of this ? genuinely curious 
---
Thats why i was thinking of getting it. I dont wanna hate it without even playing it. 
---
Restock on the ammo I need for the weapons I'm carrying (currently 1 pistol, 1 rifle, and a hatchet) Pick something interesting on the map, and head that way. Get distracted by something along the way, end up discovering something cool.
---
I'm just taking my time, peeking in every corner, reading and listening to everything, and trying to do it "in character". 
---
Cap mines you saw in the future.  We are now in the past.
---
We must find a way to get.... “Back to the Future!”
---
Please don’t go down this road. Don’t start chapping on new stuff before it’s even here. 
---
Please. It’s pointless and just makes for a terrible reddit.
---
It's often on sale through key stores, I got it for $21 Au.
---
I'm loving all the positivity I'm reading about today!! All the new stuff sounds amazing!! 
---
I was wondering if CAMP shape/size is a feature that is on the horizon?? Mostly just wanted to be able to build next to friends. The circles make this difficult.  As far as the actual size its ok, but I would like to be able to make a square radius. This way we could make large settlements. 
---
Thoughts?
---
It said the purveyor was a special vendor so I’m wondering if you get special legendary currency from selling legendary items that you can then buy better legendary items. 
---
I’m relatively sure this only happens when the owner of the camp first spawns onto the server.
---
This guy Flatwoodss 
---
There is an upcoming vendor where you can trade unwanted legendaries for better chance at legendaries you want.
---
The legendary vendors they announced on the roadmap
---
 Nah just hoarding all 3 star items with 3lbs or less
---
Ditto.
---
Also don't forget the roof of the Red Rocket near Flatwoods (marsupial needed). There's some cans up there too.
---
I'm legitimately excited for this. Especially the player vending machine. I can (hopefully) finally sell all that ammo I don't need.
---
Dumb noob question: can you get banned for modifying ini files?
---
Oh ok 
---
That was my exact thought when I read it
---
Not too sure as I havent really played fallout at all, but kind of hoping they pull a No Mans Sky and redeem the shot they've done
---
You swear this is true
---
Have you tried to login today
---
Well I wont say anything beyond 94 &amp; 96 are interesting. But the real mystery is the third Vault, which we still know nothing about, and isn’t mentioned as one of the raids- making me wonder if THAT Vault has survivors and will be the source of the Wastelanders expansion.
---
Sneezing near glowing ones got you one level minimum back then.
---
On the roadmap they are talking about cameras so maybe?
---
Is Grahm supposed to be sneaky? I'm only a couple dozen hours into the game, and I've run into him a few times.
---
I can craft the BOS Heavy Combat Armour Chest. Might be on in a couple hours, or definitely tomorrow. Gimme a message! (I can do the Excavator Calibrated Shocks &amp; Motion-Assist Servos too, but would need the flux/screws etc supplied). Anyone else, feel free to message me! GT JaggersLips13
---
I just picked up an alt account... guess I'll just save literally every legendary and fill 9 characters with them...
---
You have me mistaken for someone who hasn't played the game and just gotten bored. Is this a fansub or something now? Do you not remember the extensive criticism all the last forever?
---
I would. That has been a huge criticism of the game and it is easily fixable. The "no NPCs" decision was based on either a desire to experiment or to reach a deadline; either way it didn't work out as well as they hoped.
---
Yes. I grilled him on it thinking he was fucking with me. He sent a screenshot of his character in front of stash box with 800 max with his normal loadout equiped.
---
I'll do it but i'll need decent payment to make me switch to this game from Anthem, having quite a bit of fun on it. 
---
Depends how it works. 
---
thats from the first update dingus
---
Mutations are basically traits imo
---
Maybe play because you enjoy it beyond the temporary feel of it being shiny and new?
---
Well, we don't know how it works yet, right, but if it's some kind of point system, then this is what I am pointing at:
---
Grahm has a fixed route he takes everyday. 
---
Shush i have the seen the errors of my ways but still hes an npc 
---
On morning break and at lunch. Same 4:8:2000 
---
One nice Idea for you Bethesda, if you are not already thinking that, make new winter mode max level mode. Meaning all enemies max level in every region. I would like to roam more in other areas, but do not as they aren't rewarding as Mire and Bog.
---
I horde em all, never mind the weight! Rar!
---
I have every stuffed animal there is. Are my dreams coming true?
---
First Non-Robot/Computer NPC? Does Graham mean nothing to you?
---
no way, fr?
---
78 hours of which was spent on Rose's missions.  I still have nightmares...
---
Yeah.
---
bear with it
---
Really I have like 200 hours and only ran into him twice
---
Level 80 rn and i’ve only run into him twice   :/
---
All of them, paints, workshop items, PA Paints
---
I am always encumbered, so I strategically place camps across the map, I have 2 characters and 2 xboxes, so I can spawn across the map. 
---
Also for daily challenges, it is much easier to do certain challenges with alt characters like level ups, also I can fast travel, mess around with camps etc ..
---
the game/network/servers probably can't handle so many individual inventories is my guess.
---
i recently had over 100 orbital strikes on my camp from a level 306 and a level 289
---
Nah its not a problem, its just good to have backup supply of lead
---
Sorry the game isn't easy enough for you.
---
Eastern Standard time?
---
I'm salty that there are no Appalachian dulcimers in Appalachia...
---
Exactly :) I am thinking it will be decon of some sort, but probably not for a mod. Thinking about Destiny 2 system (which was pretty OK tbh).
---
If it's decon for points, then 1* is all of a sudden not worthless :)
---
The question is, how many can your mules hold?
---
Excited!
---
Not a bad idea. Flatwoods would be good place. It can't be nuked and it's relatively safe. I am curious to see what kind controls are put in place to keep someone from buying everything or that one asshole who is a douche and sets up a camp just outside the area and shoots at everyone. 
---
Also in the future will these broadcasts feature more kind of Q&amp;A time or discussion about upcoming features or primarily just playing the game?
---
There was a glitch in 4 that could do that. I wonder if someone could replacate it?
---
I'm sorry I missed the big sales monster! I didn't mean to!
---
So the game leaves Alpha in 2020. Got it. 
---
Nice, pulling the “grown up” card, cool 
---
I don’t understand why I’m not allowed to be upset that I spent 60 dollars for an unfinished game. Did I still enjoy some of my time playing it? Sure, but does that excuse Bethesda’s development process and general inability to balance an online PvE game? No. 
---
Seriously man, read the damn road map. Wild Appalachia has a release on March 12, March 19, March 26, April 9, April 16, May 7 and May 23.
---
&gt;earn a customizable backpack for increased utility.
---
The customizable part is what interested me.
---
if you’re on PS4 and need someone to carry you and dump you good shit i’m down lol
---
Good luck to you and your stah
---
*stash
---
I certainly understand the sentiment, but you were attacking a comment that simply showed excitement. Still, this thread is pretty astounding since I’ve scrolled further down. There’s a comment downvoted that simply expresses cautious optimism, not even criticism, and the top-votes reply is “there always has to be one.” Like, what? There isn’t just one, there’s plenty of people, professional reviewers included, who received this game poorly since it was delivered in a broken state...like FO4 was, like Skyrim was, and like FO3 was. The primary difference is there’s nothing that’s usually compelling about a Bethesda game here to redeem it yet, so a bit of caution to consumers is valid. Sheesh. Not to mention the update to this game that reintroduced bugs, just like one of the first updates to Skyrim introduced the bug of backwards dragons, thus bugging a core mechanic of the game. So it seems between your unhelpful and immature reaction, and a measured response to an announcement making promises (like, say, the previous announcement about the release of the game and bags of a certain material), we’re in a place where you’ll just have to pull your hair out at the next thousands of upvotes thread ranting about the broken state of the game down the line. 
---
Na, Sheepsquatch
---
Think it's the conduits causing the message "nothing is selected" all my blueprints work except the ones with wiring conduits. 
---
No mention of private servers, sick. 
---
I bought the game because they specifically mentioned private servers would be a thing. Not too pleased, tbh. 
---
That GWAR armor, \*oops\*, I mean that WAR armor looks nice.
---
This is a AAA game studio. Not some indie dev where the game would be in Early access forever. Most "Early Access" titles never even see a full release version. This game on the other hand, no matter what state it was in on release, would 100% be finished at some point. You're comparing Apples to Oranges. 
---
Might be a whole bunch of cryptids, there's bunny men in Virginia too according to Wikipedia 
---
Agree with that; the fact things are moving forward after a shaky start is a good sign 
---
I carry a dummy gun...its a top level AA Bolt action pipe rifle....my two mains are AAE handmade and TSE lever...most times running about I just use the pipe rifle because it still does the job and ammo is easy to find...save the good ammo for when needed
---
They can do all that and more but large content updates for any game always break something.  I don't think I've ever seen a major content update that didn't.
---
I play with a group. We’re constantly getting plans from different things. They just drop anything they already know for me when I’m on an alt. I do Poseidon for the generators and the rest I just don’t worry about until I need a specific one. Usually by the time I want a certain plan I’ve already acquired it along the way. 
---
"so Bethesda wouldn't be able to detect it before it was done."   --  That's not the kind of trust relationship I'm talking about.
---
A&gt; Modder creates mod and applies for Bethesda Digital Signature in order to get network access enabled for that mod.
---
B&gt; Entry level programmer or not much higher reviews the code and escalates it, if needed.
---
(If Bethesda had a better relationship with the modder community, it could be community vetted first by trusted modders.)
---
C&gt; Assuming the vetting passes, the mod gets a digital signature applied to the mod file as well as an MD5 of that file that gets stored on the server.  The modder would have to specify which server name and IP the traffic will be going to.
---
D&gt; Bethesda places the server name and ip on a white list along with the MD5 of the signed mod file.  The client checks for the valid Bethesda signature, calculates the MD5 of the mod file, sends that info to the server and the server says yes or no on whether that mod is allowed to talk and if yes, the server returns the allowed name and ip of the remote server that is being allowed only for that mod.
---
So in the end if there is any funny business, Bethesda removes the authorization from the server and and that mod ceases to function. It is a trust relationship. Bethesda doesn't have to monitor the traffic if the mod hasn't been changed.  If the mod changes, it will need a new signature and will need to be vetted again before it is signed and the new MD5 is added to the server.   
---
I too would prefer that Bethesda take ownership of how unwieldy the perk system is and make that interface better.  The example has been laid out for them.
---
In no way was I addressing people who simply 'take issue' with the release state. Ya need to look at the post's context and reach before you type things out, because what you just did is basically position yourself to be exactly the person I *am* talking about.. someone who glosses over things. :-p
---
Here's who I addressed the post to: "a summary for that section of youtubers and net denizens who don't have the time to think deeply about things or understand the context around them, and the games media sites that like to use reddit as a research source."
---
This does not say "those people who don't like the game" or "those people who have criticisms of the game". It's about a *section* of people who don't think things through or look at context. Please keep that in mind when you reply!
---
Oh ok, I don’t server hop, I just hit it once when I first sign in and once when I’m about to sign off of some time has passed. 
---
I'm more amazed that more than 1 person searching for the hunter radio than the rest of the tale.
---
yeah if we are going that route NPCs have been in the game since launch. i am sure what people refer to are NPCs that you can interact with via dialog trees.
---
Honestly getting 100,000 of an item  doesn't even SEEM that difficult to me in a thirty day period if I really wanted to go ham at it. I wish I didn't have so many other games to play right now, I'd love to get my account banned through legitimate play of the game to demonstrate how flawed this method of determining guilt is.
---
Apparently you skipped the part where they've been able to
---
&gt;fix many of the top issues and have made numerous improvements to the game.
---
Or the part that says
---
&gt; There’s still work to do, but we’re happy to report that game and server stability has increased over 300% since launch.  
---
Get a grip dude...
---
Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
---
If they do it properly. Im not keeping my hopes up
---
“[HOORS](https://youtu.be/RC7hZY3sVxE) “

I love this whole story, wish that you could have caught it on video!
---
protectrons, mr. handies and holotapes with dialogue options, calling it now
---
I just level the entire base.  That's a bounty I'll happily accept.
---
We are CST
---
Who ever said anything about private servers? Selfish much?
---
The serums are at the cap... cap though. That's asinine. I could see them being 10k, but 25? That's insane. 
---
It's also a very convenient way to fuck over everyone who doesn't want to participate in the trade economy, especially after they've nerfed all the cap stash shit, AND there's no way to really earn a lot of caps in a reasonable time unless you're the 900 hours dude.
---
Some of us have jobs and shit and can't afford the massive time investment it takes to get 25k caps. Hell, I've got like 200 hours in and I haven't collected more than 15-18k total. It's ridiculous.
---
The main drawback to grouping camps in settlements is if you use it as a fast travel hub for your team
---
Hey it’s free money 
---
Ooh, that sounds like its encouraging players to team up and work together 
---
Sorry the game isn't easy enough for you...
---
witness me! i did all the forge quests on all 3 characters in D2...it was brutal
---
Thanks for the response!
---
I love helping the newbs out. I randomly find a fledgling and I pass on all the plans I can and if I am not too busy, I'll do a weapon or piece of armor or two for em. :-)
---
I think it might unlock objects in build mode in your camp once they're in your inventory and then place them like you place decorations now, so people don't steal your stuff when you're not in your camp.
---
What what I understand, he/she was a duper, but still played 900 hours at the same time, and made the guide as an alibi to back up his/her post in the future, which reached the front page recently, earning the name 900 guy.
---
Some of the things on that roadmap look awesome.
---
&gt;If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.  
---
&gt;Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.   
---

Backpacks is all i ever wanted omg
---
One of us! One of us!
---
I hope for more caves or being able to explore/camp in buildings. Shoot even have basements for our camps.
---
At first you think it's the usual "Random Damage bug" but then you look at your feet and the Bunnyman is upon you!
---
Yes to all. We want to get more consistent with streams and I have a lot of fun plans for these. Today was dusting off the cobwebs and getting back into the grove of things! I hope to do streams with Dev's, Q&amp;A's, feature previews, and more. 
---
I think EA may be the culprit.... DICE is generally a good studio
---
Also the whole legendary player prestige thing.
---
Maybe so but Bethesda themselves have stated repeatedly and reiterated in this most recent roadmap update they are building the game based on player feedback.  
---
Thus, I'm providing player feedback.  I apologize if that is not what you want to see and wish you good fortune in the wars to come ;)
---
"900 hours" guy brought the average up a bit ;) RIP
---
When did they say anything about mod support in FO76?
---
I always thought there has to be a reason why there’s so many different teddy bears. And this isn’t that reason, but I can see myself going on mindless personal quest to find all those bastards to just display them.
---
IF you are out of bare cloth.
---
I feel like this could be a great opportunity to give the people what they want, npcs
---
Mayhaps they are one in the same?
---
Or at least the same kind of "creature?"
---
Why does each candle take 1% of budget, its minimal lightning. 
---
Lots of cool things, placing items in your C.A.M.P.  Yes! Going to be fun for sure.
---
Pretty sure those will be fixed objects, not items. The servers won't be burdened with physics of said objects.
---
Backpacks and Legendary vendor....stoked.  I’m a stealth rifleman build and all I get are mere legendaries. Hopefully the vendor will allow me to exchange them for a legendary rifle.
---
I mean, thats the deal with most cryptids. The reason I say it will be Sheepsquatch is that it is the one actually native to WV/Appalachia
---
I think the consensus is that Luck affects the condition of found items but not the types of items. I’m a Luck 14 and the items I find are usually excellent condition, repaired well past 100%, but they are still usually junk. 
---
Well, aside from what others have said about nuked zones, you may feel like you need power armor.  Depends on how you play though.  The way I play, I pick up everything in every area that I go into, which always results in being over-encumbered.  For this reason, I carry excavator armor around with me, and I hop into it as soon as I get the over-encumbered notification.
---
TLDR: If you're a hoarder, you may feel the need to wear PA a lot more.
---
I need vanhelsing clothes and the hellboy pistol 
---
Look, I wrote a long and sarcastic post refuting your points one by one, but I honestly can't be arsed to continue arguing.
---
If you want to believe Bethesda are running a long con here, well, you're welcome to your opinion, and since that obviously means that you can't possibly keep supporting them (as that would make you a willing accomplice), I wish you best of luck with your next choice of entertainment.
---
Cannot wait to see all your beautiful decorative photos :D
---
Looks pretty cool. I hope it’s gonna have action bar / ui customization and responsiveness fixes, and the ability to store perk cards I don’t want to scroll thru when swapping things in and out of the build, and the ability to convert bobble head and magazine to perk cards for cooldown abilities. I will never ever eat a magazine or bobble head. Thanks for updating us about the features plan. I hope you will let us know if these core necessary fixes will be done, and if there will be a social system to go along with the individual player system for post level 50. We want to level and build as community / factions. 
---
I want snow
---
Cool, the reason I ask is some folks in the fallout network discord were a bit disappointed they couldn't ask about the roadmap, which looks exciting.
---
 that's awesome can you actually build over a swimming pool
---
Ok I see more what you mean now. If the mod doesn’t pass the MD5 check it doesn’t get loaded at all, or doesn’t get network access. 
---
However in that scenario someone could hack the servers of the perk loadout manager and troll people heavily by screwing up their loadouts and hit quite a few players before the revocation could occur, BUT that’s a far less severe situation than arbitrary code execution or something like that. 
---
However, I’d still prefer they spend resources elsewhere than putting in a system to accommodate one mod (so far anyway). Even if it’s a pretty sweet mod. 
---
Oh shit we get a fucking camera?!?!?! That’s awesome! I’ll go around as a wasteland photographer! 
---
This is amazing, thank you for finally giving us something to look forward to. Please though, for the love of Nuka give us an update on text chat in game. Being forced to use Discord overlay for a modern online game is absolute insanity.
---
WE GETTING THE DECOR BOYS!!!!
---
I agree with you.  Either a solo mode or maybe a matchmaking just for the “raid”, this way there isn’t any organization needed in advance.
---
And you took a facetious comment way too seriously. I want the game to be successful and enjoyable. Right now it's neither. There's no endgame content outside of nuke zones and that gets old after one week.They should have communicated the timeline earlier as well. As of now, for those of us who hit 50 in Nov we'll be waiting for 7-9 months to do the first raids and a prestige system when they release "Summer 2019".
---
I started the game by building a Jack-of-all-trades build and catered to my low level survival needs like Endurance but low-level 50 I began a respec in to Luck Points/Perks. I've seen a noticeable difference in drops. You get more from containers and can loot Weapons with Higher CND, which sell for more. I do FEEL as though I'm seeing more Legendary drops and more desirable Legendary mods on Weapons. Could be RNG? But isn't Luck just having better RNG anyway?    
---
Like rolling a weighted Die. Luck is an under rated Skill and I highly recommend it. Dump 15 Skill Points in to it and reap the rewards
---
Won’t be able to see it in power armor I’m sure 
---
I thought I was the only teddy bear collector, is there any more of us out there?
---
I spend the points as I get them, so honestly I do not know why the Master Rifleman hasn't dropped for me....
---
Can confirm he is right as I also received the shielded lining plan from turning in tech data a few days ago.
---
the legendary vendor is a mole-minor
---
Doing anyone know where to get the raider shielded lining plan?
---
give us 10 grahms
---
Yeah, I will never eat one. I will use a bobble or magazine ability once they are added to the build as a set of choices to equip only a few at a time for cooldown usage. Decorating is cool too, I don’t really do this but all my friends like to as they are animal crossing players. 
---
you can steal from resource collectors if they are NOT locked.
---
Yeah, usually they are. Some games had a rough and buggy start (but we are on a Fallout subreddit so let's ignore that) but turned out to be quite polished in the end but so far DICE seems to be following Murphy's Computers Law in every aspect.
---
I still enjoy the game, yes, but the communication is just way worse than it is here.
---
Community: The TTK is perfect the way it is, do something about the Ju88 bomb spam! 
---
DICE: We heard you loud and clear. TTK has been changed.
---
Tbf, both is fine now, but you get the point. 
---
Lol. Todd Howard himself said mods and private servers would come in the new year. The roadmap covers a big chunk of it and there's not even a slight mention. 
---
I'd agree I'm heavy into luck and the condition of the items I loot is very good. I still get crummy legendary drops often enough though so I wouldn't suggest it helps with awesome legendary modifiers.
---
You should be.  Especially since you have no idea who I am or what I've done in FO76.
---
Yes and no, for solo play you'll want something with a bit more stopping power (and probably a suppressor) but for leveling in a team the perfect storm is fantastic as the fire damage seems to ensure that you get a 'tag' and exp/loot for the kill.
---
Is he like, quitting or something? Did he make an attention grabbing post? Or was he banned and made a big deal and try to pull another "innocent player banned" post to push their anti-Bethesda agenda
---
Watoga emergency services building usually has ~25 with rank 3 of pharma farma
---
I'd wager you're right on that.
---
Either way, big scary Sheep-Goat-Man is a good addition.
---
You all didn’t have to add a camera feature but you did and I’m in love. It was something I always wanted to do in fallout and now I can go around taking pictures of people and things in a more organic and immersive manner. Hyped! 
---
I used to pick them all up as a low level, but now I just gloss over them. Time to go on that mindless quest you mentioned 
---
Okay, same with everything else...
---
I guess "love at first sight" really is a thing :)
---
Lack of common sense
---
That would be cool
---
Kermit, his tea drunk.
---
I'm more excited for this game now than I was before it released.
---
I am going to be the best toilet paper and IOU vendor Appalachia has ever seen.
---
Ture but I honestly haven't seen Whitesprings nuked in several weeks. 
---
Reason they are three cards instead of just one 3 star card is to level gate them. As is, you can't get master lockpicking until level 40. If it was 1 card, that unlocked at level 5, you could pick level 3 locks by level 7. They wanted level 2 and 3 locks/terminals to be things you had to be higher level to gain access to. Making them separate cards allows them to do that.
---
Sorry folks. I'm a dumbass. Ps4
---
You're allowed to be as upset as you want. I personally don't give a flying fuck if you want to waste your time being angry about something you're perfectly capable of putting on your shelf and never thinking about again. 
---
God i feel sorry for all those who bought this game. Companies will never learn if we keep buying their shitty regurgitated games every annual/bi annual release (in this case it was a few years)
---
sounds cool. Also nice that Fasnacht does coincide with the actual swedish festival, though not helvetia's actual festival date.
---

*shear terror
---
Goatman/Sheepsquatch is going to be such a joy to fight, or so I hope!
---
All of this sound amazing, i'm so glad to see you guys have been working on content. Can't wait to join the scouts and brew booze!
---
might have to purchase this game now 
---
Looking forward to your thoughts once the content starts to come out! We'll be here :D 
---
You read a helluva lot into a tiny blurb.
---
Sorry I'm on PC. 
---
This is literally the most cringe worthy shit i've ever seen in my life.
---
I take a photo of every one of those and try to have my character make the same face
---
Aye, she's on disability, sometimes I'm a little jealous of her free time lol
---
Other people have mentioned a cryptid named “sheepsquatch” that apparently has been seen in West Virginia, and that lines up nicely with the graphic.
---
But you really don’t have anything about the stuff to come to actually give feedback on.
---
So it comes across as demands on what they have to do.
---
Considering the only extremely stupid behavior has come from the 900 hour guy admitting to not only lying about when he got banned and actually telling us he uses a marco for harvesting that Ironically is almost the same way to dup the stuff he was accused of duping.  
---
Your whole point of well it's not because he crafted all that ammo it's numbers are just  inflated because he would drop it and pick it up and pass it to his mule. Well dude if  that will inflate the number he actually had it would not just show up on his second account.  Since you are saying that every time he picked up the ammo and every time it was passed back and forth the actual amount he had was just inflated  then his main account would not just have been listed to have 140k of ultracite  especially since his second account had 255k and is just a mule account. If he dropped and pick it up and then passed it over to his second account he would have way more than that on his first account as you are saying every time he dropped it and picked it up the amount he had the numbers were just inflated.
---
Please keep the feedback and suggestions coming! We are here reading and listening every single day :)
---
A couple of one shot explosive, the rest are junkie's etc.
---
My problem is that I have a really good camp site that I don't want everyone to find out about. It's already taken by someone else enough times when I try to log in.  If everyone who has a camp there starts  advertising it's location, it will be impossible to find a server where it's free. 
---
I'll have to read up on Fasnacht I think.
---
I wonder what rare Junk item our new Goatman will drop?
---
To me it looks pretty selective. They selected a few ideas out f things that have been high activity threads (surprises me to see the one for resetting your character post 50, for example) there is a lot that is being passed over if not just left unmentioned that the game really needs for features that are unfinished and barely serve the needed function, so I’m hopeful these items are addressed fully as a natural part of the feature complete vision of the game this roadmap suggests. Like the drop bags / containers situation or perk card ui, action bar customizing, team / community faction that can level and build together (TOWNS was the most popular thread on that). 
---
I want a board, some clippings, string and thumbtacks...
---
I was hanging around with new friends at a crossroad by Tygar Water Treatment on Day 2 of the "Take a Photo with Grahm" Weekly Task and I kept thinking, I really need to go find this dude soon before I forget. Then up he strolls, out of nowhere.    
---
You don't find Grahm. Grahm find you.
---
Hah, no worries. I was really hoping I was wrong for a second there.
---
Sounds like a bunch of ladies from the Order of Mysteries stopped to celebrate a victory and things got waaaay out of hand.
---
"I was going to ask why you're out of uniform, but I don't think I want to know now."
---
LOL. I will be giving away a level 50 All Rise today. I will be on PC and I will give it to the first person with his mic on. ;)
---
I have a question, so if I turn in multiple 1* legendaries do I get a chance of getting a 3* or is that strictly 3* for 3*? 
---
Really excited for the update btw, all of you are doing great work! 
---
Hey man. Your post was good, but please, for the love of mobile users; paragraphs my dude. 
---
I don't mind being wrong if we get what they tell us, and I actually think they will this time.
---
&gt;*Hnnnngggggg!*
---
There is a person I befriended about a decade ago (whoa) and this is our greeting to each other every time we meet up for dinner.
---
I read this and was like "Hong, is that you? Where have you been buddy?"
---
From there I'm clueless, all I know is there are posts like that made here. The trading steal bug being one of them.
---
Just hang on to 3 star weightless pieces and lightweight weapons. The more stars the better
---
Came home to find a mutt trying to eat my stove, free meat though as you say. Cooked up nice. 😊
---
I hope the Purveyor has dialogue that gives us a bit more insight into the lore of the Mole Miners.
---
I thought so too, but last night i hit watoga and it seemed like every other protectron was a legendary. I pulled 7 legendary's, all 1 star though. Same at whitespring, but when i made the full circuit i had 9, 1 stars. Vendors had a bunch of legendary's for sale too, all crap.
---
Besides being on the one server, i would swear they nerfed legendary enemies across the board. Starting to wonder if i shouldn't hop until i see legendary enemies are spawning, and then do the rounds.
---
There's plenty of parts already in the game too. Election terminals everywhere, the Enclave executive area, vote printers and ballot counters... Just no event to tie it all together.
---
Thanks for coming by! Also thank you for posting this, my phone did not have signal in our stream room so our "Live now!" tweet unfortunately didn't post.
---
We want to consistently do more streams in the future! When we get to Q&amp;A streams, I think after how fast our chat was going today I'll look into having a post on here  or our forums for people to type out their questions so we can see and answer them a bit easier. 
---
It seems that every server  I am on, it gets whacked multiple times.
---
PC&gt;&gt; HappyCamper781

Older crank who plays teamed or solo. happy to team up to clear quests for folks anytime I'm on. Beats the hell out of my usual vendor sales circuits or farming Whitespring Golf Club
---
 Use one of the trading subreddit. They sell for 200-400 caps per serum. If you buy the in-game ones, I feel sorry for you.
---
This is hilarious, it is as described... It will still be made by Bethesda who can't even make a bug fix patch without introducing new bugs of equal severity.  People read the road map and think their Lord and savior has come, w t f.
---
They said they are still looking into it, they just stated a work around for the time being.
---
Yeah, it seems like an eternal struggle. I play ESO and this is the number one complaint of the player housing community. Players are constantly asking for more room for furnishings in their houses and most people have their budgets totally maxed out. Obviously it would beneficial for ZOS (and BGS in this case) to allow bigger housing budgets because players will buy more things, but the bottom line is that performance will suffer. I experience crashes and freezing already when visiting fully decorated houses in ESO, especially when they have multiple furnishings that move or light up. Similarly, my FPS suffers in 76 when I come across elaborate, lit up camps. 
---
Seriously, anybody who wants "Nuclear Winter" to be a battle royale needs to just stay with Fortnite and leave us alone. 
---
Now the black one is microtransaction worthy, maybe not $20 though.
---
I'm not going to mess with random removal in my mutation stack right now. I am waiting for a hotfix or some sort of serums that remove specific mutations (would be good for situations like this, after they change/nerf mutations or when respeccing.)
---
From what I've been reading it seems like they need to hotfix it  anyway to fix the UI not displaying the positive message and it would be nice if they make it so we don't have to remove it to fix it as well.
---
This is amazing. WTB Ghoul slaying gamma gun.
---
I only found one (pretty sure it was 94), but I am levelling a second toon now, I will have to keep an eye out for these other vaults now that I'm a bit more familiar with the areas =)
---
Oddly enough, it's done this on the 2 silo runs I did after this one also. Always Alpha though, haven't tried the other 2.
---
Lol how many interns do you have commenting here Bethesda? I've never seen such fake hype in my entire life.
---
Is there a timeline to release the server files for us to mod them?
---
Well, psychologically speaking it is very difficult to change. Even if the person says they would change their ways, it would take a far-above-average amount of dedication for that to actually happen. The past is the best predictor of the future, even if it's not always a good one
---
I don't support them which is why I don't use the atom shop nor ever will. 
---
Yeah, hope is nice... but I'll believe it when I see it.  Already been let down too often to really have any true hope it's not just an hour or less quests they add.
---
Wow, what a bunghole of a comment to make. 
---
Awe that's so sweet! I generally type "Hhhnnnnngggg!!" to get text to my weird noises I make IRL. Usually associated with exceptionally yummy food.  
---
All hail the mighty mothman 
---
alright you peaked my interest 
---
Those last 3 lines, I couldn’t agree more!  I’m willing to spend money, more than willing.... but what you get in return is simply not worth it.
---
Bootleggers shack
---
definitely what i first thought reading this too. with all the hate, the bugs and the drama you'd think they would slowly and silently ramp down and move the developers to other projects and just take the L on this one. glad to see theyre not giving up on it. really reminds me of how no mans sky redeemed itself a while after launch.
---
It not being successful or enjoyable is your opinion.
---
The gyms are great but it's almost *always* been picked clean by someone else. 
---
You’re probably fine. It depends what type of ammo, but it’s pretty easy to amass 2k or an ammo type you don’t typically use. The probably saw that oh were lower level and could actually use that ammo type
---

---
The savage divide level cap area goes further west into the forest and ash heap than these maps show.
---
So any place that can spawn max level super mutants in the savage divide will be farmed by high level players looking for 3\* legendary spawns, unless they spawn as mole miners, in which case they'll be farmed for shotgun shells.
---
I usually leave tons of bullets that do not help me, 2000 is a lot but not so exaggerated, if I had left you 20000, I would have doubts. 
---
I’ve always played with a high luck and I never really felt the legendary drops were that bad. All my armor and 95% of my weapons I got through drops. 
---
&gt;You don't find Grahm. Grahm find you
---
That's a god damn understatement
---
My one question is how will becoming a legendary player interact with the level 100 trophy? Will it also reset the level with the rest of the character's abilities?
---
I drop ammo I don’t use all the time. I doubt people would dupe ammo they don’t use just for the slight chance someone else picks it up and gets banned for having duped items. 
---
*PTSD flashback of dogmeat knocking shit over. *
---
*Customizable Backpacks :D
---
&gt;As do I. They are my favorite faction. I have their flag hanging over my bed
---
Great story, I run nearly the same build but with an auto pistol instead. Being able to relocate after each kill is great with chameleon. I had some sparring with a raider at hemlock holes. Eventually he brought out the Fatman as well but I was hiding elsewhere by then.
---
Wish I could have levels of fun like this.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
I'll choose to tackle the issue least likely to get brought up
---
As if people are going to be wearing military gear instead of the silliest, brightest colors possible in that PvP game mode.
---
I can definitely pass this feedback on to the team!
---
&gt;For the direction that Bethesda is heading with updates/nerfs, that area churns way too many legendaries (although most are garbage). I AM hoping that they keep some places with a decent source of end-game items.
---
They should add a legendary vendor who let's you scrap legendaries to get different stuff. Maybe make him be a mole miner it something.
---
Alrighty. Thank you!
---
Unarmed is weak?
---
What?
---
There are definitely rewards to a high Luck number. The available perks with high Luck are among the best in the game imo. Better condition of found items is just a bonus. I don’t think L14 has helped me find desirable weapons or armor. But maybe it has and my drops would be even worse with lower Luck!!!
---
One of many fixed routes.
---
There's a map if you google it.
---
Thanks added it to the post! Wasn't aware of that until now.
---
I wanna be able to pick stuff up and smack people in the head with it (not causing damage but as comedy) while their at workbenches
---
I’m just saying that there are some people that hate the game so much now that nothing will bring them back lol
---
I feel bad because right after the dropped it my game started stuttering really badly and crashed. Gotta love traveling and playing on a shitty laptop. Sorry to the guy who did it, you're a real bro!
---
They stick to the first part and don't screw it up, I'll happily reinstall the game.
---
Try the launch sites? There are a few.
---
the action revolver hits a bit more, but it takes a long time to recharge 
---
Can't tell you how many times I've seen Grahm. It's probably double digits now though. I've looked for him once or twice and never found him. One time I was at my Camp in PV and I heard a Brahmin in a bush near by, it was Nelly and Grahm hiding. He turns up in weird places
---
Definitely, in the picture on the website you can see a vault boy with a very clear vault suit running with somebody without a vault suit, implying characters not from the vault- NPCs
---
Same, I use .308, 10mm, and shotgun shells. Everything else gets dumped. Usually at a train station or at the overseers camp.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/3pvGV
---
Truth Confirmed!
---
Honestly, I doubt you will get full blown mods or private servers for that matter.  I know that they stated this, but I just don't see it happening in fo76.
---
I might try and check out the locations on the map in one of the pictures and see what’s there
---
Is anyone else looking forward to the Legendary Players System in Nuclear Winter?
---
not if they forget to lock the machine....
---
No one is making you come here brotato.
---
Wasn't bunny man just a nut job in a costume tho?
---
Strong like how scorched meat taste, it’s spicy.
---
Ammo is not a problem. With the bandolier perk certain ammo types are actually weightless so the game mechanics actually allow you to carry infinite ammo. 2k is kinda chump change for any player running bandolier.
---
That was why I posted a preface. As a low Luck player sub-Level 60-70, my drops always sucked but having seen the contrast, everything sucked beforehand and now my Luck has changed. I started respecing at around 60 and the Game does feel less harsh since I did so imo
---
Yeah, same here. I guess I don't need 200 purified water, 100 stimpacks, 100 radaways...
---
(Shrug)
---
I don't know how to explain then the huge, complex camps that some people have, compared to what we all start with ... 4 wooden walls and a few plants. 
---
I'm not sure, but I've seen people build over ponds.
---
What platform do you play on? If it’s Xbox I can help you with furniture and other building
---
Sadly they aren't wrong, Bethesda has really not had the best track record with releasing things with this game. I mean they have yet to even release a patch that didn't have a bug that breaks something.
---
It really sucks that they have burnt so much of the goodwill people had towards them with this game. So they have A LOT of work to do to try to earn the trust of their player base back.
---
Negative.  Look at is as more of a blood shard system for Diablo 3.  TUrn in 1 star legendary for scrap, you might get a 1 star legendary back but more than likely just junk.
---
Cya.
---
Man, Dogmeat flipped a car once. I haven’t yelled at him since. 
---
Honestly fuck the people (especially youtubers) who doubted this game so much. The cancer in most YouTube comment sections on a video about 76 is a joke, and due to crazy bias. This game will
---
be even better soon. 
---
Because of turrets, ive always been able to build huge camps, I just have to have 0 defense 
---
Nah dude. It's def going f2p. This obscure gaming "journalist" website cited a Reddit post that said so. You're just gonna ignore the FACTS???
---
I feel the same. Carrying around junk legendary's for the chance encounter would be kinda annoying. 
---
Adhesive is one of those weird things where it's so hard to find at lower levels like your own.
---
I'm now only level 52, but I have something like 300 adhesive stored, and I've bulked and sold some of it!  Things I'm still low on are those damned screws, and steel oddly is getting quite low. But Screws. OMG. I salivate at finding fans and typewriters.
---
And you're right. The perks are godly if you stack them with the right skills. Like, my Character is Perception, Agility, Luck. Stealth Sniper one shotting enemies in most situations
---
Now they need to add T.O.W.N.
---
So I just took my time and reapplied adrenaline mutation and everything works as before, the damahe has not been nerfed at all...
---
Actually, there's not many open-able trailers in the game, at least that I've seen.
---
Can you site where you heard that. I have not heard that.
---
15???
---
When you drop stuff it just falls in a paper bag 
---
Might i humbly suggest taking a stroll over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals. I'm sure you'll be able to find some companions over there. 
---
I feel like private servers would be a good way to keep the game alive after bethesda stops working on it, like with faction or role play servers
---
Huh??? How is he selfish? I remember there being talk of private servers too. 
---
I recently made 2k .45 ammo... just because. No exploits needed. If someone drops 2k bobble heads, then I’d walk away 
---
Yeah it was 
---
a fool and his money...
---
I don't even know what a fair price would be. 
---
Let me know when you're on next and I'll see where I'm at. 
---
I would too. Human NPCs were killed by the scorch. Now that the SBQ is dead, they can come back / come out of their hidey hole. 
---
Do you mean the surgical mask? It's not that bad, I don't think. Or are there more medical-themed masks?
---
Oh Christ you're probably right 
---
CAMP decorating!
---
I won't even watch anything 76 related on Youtube anymore because I can't be sure the video can be trusted to give unbiased information.
---
YEAHHHHHHH
---
Eh. I've seen worse.
---
Yea...I figured that might be the case.  Lol just trying to be hopeful my 25 hunters cultist blades might actually be useful. 
---
Looks like we're both march babies!
---
go ask the folks over at r/fo76FilthyCasuals. It's all people who enjoy the game. 
---
Two sets of servers?  Post SBQ and pre-SBQ?  Log into one to have the Scorched and SBQ fights, the other for them being gone and new human NPCs?
---
Look. 
---
As a console peasant, I literally spent more time "ghost hand" decorating my homes in OB, F3, NV, SR, and placing items in F4. Not being able to decorate in 76 is a huge reason why I'm just not enjoying it nearly as much.
---
It's great that they're going to have some form of decorating possible, but I would reign your hopes in tight right now. There is no way in hell they are going to let us "ghost hand" decorate or even workshop place items wherever we want.
---
They are going to be limited to specific items only, limited to predetermined shelf placement only, and they are going to be monetized. Hard.
---
It'll be a little better than now, but we're not getting the fun, creative old days back. No way.
---
I wouldn't advertise that. People might pity you.
---
Me saving my Nuka Colas hasn't been in vain.
---
This is incredible! I am so excited for these updates
---
Oh, don't kid yourself: if you're adding to their player concurrency stats, you're most definitely supporting them. 
---
Glad to see we're in agreement after all: whatever the angry rethoric, the whole thing is ultimately no big deal. If it were, it would be worth quitting the game over. 
---
When?
---
* Should have held on the the junkie's fatman I just sold the vendor for 12 caps. 
---
WTB Super mutant Nazis in power armour vs Communistic ghouls. 
---
I'm so glad I stuck with this game since launch, through the hate train and bugs. I had faith it would pay off. Nice job Bethesda. Very excited for the future 
---
just got into this game so i missed all the bugs in it but damn its been pretty fun
---
Maybe something like 1 Special Point per 5 Level above 50 when resetting 
---
He actually got his -9 internet points. Not sure that worked out like he thought it would.
---
Sorry, 14
---
Let me share this thread with the team to make sure they're aware. Thank you mate
---
Seeing this road map is making me seriously consider getting into the game. Fallout was my first love in gaming but all of the negative shit surrounding the game before it came out kept me away and everything since just reinforced that my decision was a smart one. 
---
But seeing how everyone is reacting to this road map makes me believe that this could be the turning point when Bethesda shows that they can listen to their community and give them what they want and where I can finally jump in. I'll still wait until after the first expansion drops to see if they are able to actually improve the game like they say they are going to do, but my interest is definitely peaked more than even before the game came out
---
Found a 3* 0.5lb death tambo for 14c at Harpers Ferry vendor today...going to be serves hopping and collecting all that trash until people wise up re: selling junk legendaries.
---
I feel like a lot of people don't understand that their current character will not be usable on private servers and vice versa.
---
lvl 57 never found Grahm. is he completely random or what? 
---
I imagine the legendary purveyor will be down the bottom of a mine and it would be good if you had to fight your way to him or something like that.
---
Same!
---
Read title again.
---
nono.
---
If you want to do this you need to say:
---
wat.
---
See the "h" is important. It makes it much too formal. And the question mark indicates you were bothered enough to worry about semantics.
---
If you REALLY want to denigrate a post with a single word, the way to do it is...
---
wat
---
A well placed "wat" wins many an Internet argument.
---
You're tremendously welcome!
---
I’m confused is this in the shop now or going to be in the near future and you found a way to get it in the game?
---
I suspect that the saved game files on the server for those that read the plan prior to oatch 6 contain the  Confederate Hat COBJ record that is missing the Headwear category. That would explain why the plan shows as known and cannot be read again but the Hat doesn't show up on the Headwear armor bench crafting menu. The fix would be to correct that COBJ in those saved game files.
---
No worry. May 23 so you'll have plenty of time to figure out what you should keep or sell.
---
Well, dog spelled backwards is...
---
Sheepsquatch
---
Serums are cheap on the trading subs. Just get rid of them all and buy the ones you want.
---
This looks like what Bungie was forced to do after the player base left. 
---
I love this game, and can’t wait for new content!!!
---
Holy shit. Now that is what I call a game changer. If they actually keep their word with this, it could help fallout 76 make a comeback
---
I've thought about dumping the ammo I don't use too, but I'm always afraid that I'll want that ammo later when I find a new gun.
---
This gives me two weeks to finish AC origins...damn
---
Why is it that I see everyone talking about back packs and I can't seem to find that in the text? Can you point it out to me please?
---
Yeah, for 5mm I only keep about 2000-3000 on me and about 1000 of 308, 45 and 556.  Occasionally I'll drop a couple thousand rounds to bring my totals down to this.  2000 rounds of bullets or fusion cells is the leftover from a week's grind.  20,000 would be another story.
---
I’ve been looking forward to when I could finally display my robot model kits...
---
Likely fine.
---
I'm rolling with 2k+ of .308 rounds. I'm a sniper that doesn't praise the lord and passes the ammunition - that I'm not using.
---
Oh bullshit.  I've been griefed for 20 minutes ONCE in 90 hours of play, and I just ignored them.  Could have server swapped but wasn't even necessary. 
---
It's really amazing how BAD people are at what I consider to be true PVP (i.e. without the "shoot here, dummy" markers.
---
The first two times these guys tried to take the workshop from me (I use a chameleon build), they just walked in, activated the contestation at the workshop and then used jumpacks or marsupial to jump on top of the central machine by the workshop so they could cover the loading dock.  They never even looked at either of the back doors or bothered to sweep the building.  The third time, they charged in and started hosing every corner with their TSE's while I was crouched in the exact same spot I had just killed them in.  One guy basically walked through me without even realizing I was there.  
---
"everyone who's been banned was a cheater, don't believe anyone who says otherwise"
---
***WELL NOW***
---
My furious auto laser pistol wrecks deathclaws to shreds. Energy weapons are costly to repair but that's why you need INT for junk scrap bonus. These two work together. Energy weapons are for high INT. and they dont even break that quick for me. But that's probably because 90% of my hits are through VAT so the active use is very efficient. 
---
I have been playing laser guns for over a month now. The bad reputation is wayyyyy exaggerated. 
---
I'll check, I have some of the old ESM's, but that would only happen if they changed the formID number, otherwise a fix on the COBJ would allow anyone to craft them, like the witch/skeleton hat fix
---
I remember players asking for private servers because they wanted to play it single player. Ie. Selfish and want a server all to themselves. I don't remember Bethesda every mentioning it. I could be wrong, so if you could please cite that for me and I'll be with you.
---
I'm Saving up all the Nuka Cola Quantum! I'll light up my CAMP in Quantum Blue!
---
They talked about your temple on today's stream.
---
Hey, /u/Ladydevann , could you please do me a favor and just give enough information about "Nuclear Winter" to determine what kind of thing it is, specifically: is it battle royale? If so, I ask that you all please reconsider. This is Fallout. It's sacred. It's not freakin' Fortnite. It's bad enough that you all created a new PVP mode that maybe something like 1% of players actually asked for. Most people playing this game don't care about PVP in the least bit. Seriously, have you seen the stats? We enjoy sharing PVE moments with our friends. That's this game's sweet spot. 
---
...There's literally nothing to suggest that.
---
2k isn’t much I’ve collected over 10k ammo of one type before then sold it
---
2k is nothing for common types of ammo. I have probably given that much away to friends or dropped it on the ground (though not all at once). 
---
Oh great.  I finally got the Wendigo to wear the clown suit and now I have to egg the Bunnyman?
---
Sorry dude, probably half the reason your getting downvoted isnt because its controversial. It is because you just called everyone lvl 150+ a possible cheater.
---
Idk if you have read the roadmap post, but they claim the avg play session is about 4 hrs, this makes me think there are players grinding the hell out of fo76. And if you rough figure 2hrs per lvl and 90/100(?) days it would be easy for a player to be lvl 150 with never touching whitesprings or an exp glitch.
---
And as others said Whitesprings before the nerf, it was easy to gain 4-10 lvls per nuke zone(30-60mins). I once gained 2 lvls walking back from whitesprings to sutton from all the mobs I had tagged but not killed.
---
If you removed/edited the first few lines accusing others who play the game, you might get more discussion and less downvotes.
---
Lack of logic. If you come and destroy stuff for no reason you are a pos. Or if you come in acting like a smartass. How do I know it was a tse because it was before the patch. An darn near everyone went to reddit to buy a tse when they were broken. Kid. 
---
Bethesda ***did*** ban innocent players and continues to do so since their system is flawed (surprise surprise):
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/324535/well-bethesda-i-think-your-tracking-system-is-bugged/3?language=en&amp;page=1
---
20k? They go for about 300 on trade sites. That's like 2700 caps maybe, could probably find them cheaper
---
You doubt I have outside enthusiasm? Your doubt is extremely misplaced, my friend. 
---
Not really, they still haven't released their player numbers so it doesn't matter. I much prefer playing the game and killing other players and their camps. I've already got the game so I might as well make other players quit from getting killed with slap damage. Not to mention if I didn't play I wouldn't be able to call out any of their attempts of p2w.
---
So my one character playing and getting others to quit is a better way to fight back against p2w garbage.
---
&gt;New Quests: Ever Upwards – Journey to the deepest reaches of the woods with new stories for the legendary Pioneer Scouts. Earn merit badges, climb the ranks,*and earn a customizable backpack for increased utility.*
---
Thanks for doing what you should have 3 months ago!
---
They already cost 21k BEFORE the price increase so the extra 4k isn't all that much of an increase overall.  Serums are supposed to be one of those crafting pinnacles, that's why they were so expensive in the first place and were even rarer to find at the vendor than other plans.
---
No one NEEDS to buy one serum recipe let alone multiples.  Again the whole point is that enough people do make buying one or a few their goal and sell to others who bought different recipes or don't want to buy the recipes at all.
---
&gt;I find it interesting that fo4 had vastly better "guaranteed" items available to players than fo76
---
And that's the difference between a single player game and an mmo
---
Oh, apologies. 
---
thank you very much! :)  
---
That change alone will bring me back to Fallout 76
---
 I got 2 Luck. For the Gene thing. I just repair stuff if it needs it. I can do that for very little, there are a lot of perks, ;)
---
Really? Wow. Where can I view it?
---
The majority of this subreddit are ones who get hype delusional
---
talk is cheap
---
And I’m talking about the concentrated fire perk, pretend it works out of VATS as a skill shot for good aim. my feature and addon ideas are all locked on a couple core design vision pieces that are just super unfinished as of now and the way to finish them is apparent— I am locked on and I won’t feel like the game is where it needs to be for all my awesome fallout friends till we can finish these areas and solve the usability probs they present. 
---
Only 2000 points from the Atom Shop!
---
Anybody that starts shooting at me unannounced is, by definition, the hostile party. 
---
I will say this, I am SOOOOO glad they fixed that stupid glitch where accidentally hitting someone else's base makes you wanted and I agree with the way it now works.  (Yes, Virginia if you go shooting mininukes next to my base you're going to end up breaking something...)
---
I see haha
---
I like how you can open the window shutters to the wooden one. I don’t believe you can do that with other sets and if you can then I totally missed it. 
---
I like the second option, as long as it doesn't detract from my ability to have vending machines at my base as well.   I don't want anything where there are shared inventories, for the same reason why two players can't currently access the same vendor.
---
For those who aren't aware, only one player can use a vendor at a time. That is to prevent situations where two or more players buy the same item at the same time.  I wouldn't want one player with two vending machines to share the same inventory because it allows for this scenario, so each machine should have its own inventory.
---
However, as an option to make things a little easier, the player should also be able to build a vending management machine.  When the player accesses this machine, it should put all their vending machines out of order until the player is done with the machine.  But this machine should allow the player to remotely modify the inventory in any of their vending machines.
---
Sounds good!👌 
---
yep, sheepsquatch is WV, goatman is Maryland.
---
Oh I had no idea that was a perk! I’ll definitely add it to my list of perks to get for swapping in at camp when needed thank you :)
---
Oh wow. He was right next to the Responder's church for me the first time I booted up the game. I thought he would always be that easy to find lol.
---
I mean honestly I think have group only content brings value. They should  have a queue system for them though. 
---
I saw that, now im sad I sold so many legendary rolling pins and the like to vendors for 3 caps.
---
I've seen him despawn before.  I think he does so normally.  Walks around for some time, then despawns and respawns somewhere else, then continues walking around for a while.
---
#Dad is that you
---
I know what you are saying, but a few additional quests and a new crafting table aren't exactly alot of engagement for an entire month
---
Is that a Goatman?
---
When they initially announced fallout 76 I had really hoped for it to be a harrowing survival experience like frost and dust. Obviously those hopes were gone, but this reignites them for me in a big way.
---
 Perhaps it's pre-vault opening. Maybe we're real wastelanders prior to the scorch plague. 
---
Thanks
---
I feel you're getting a little too deep there. I'm pretty sure we could resolve this with ''I'm pretty sure not every person who ever cheated has gone on cheating for the rest of their life''.
---
Not directed at you, but it really does feel like this sub has a gigantic e-peen for declaring how against cheaters they are right now.
---
I'm level 90 and don't use it for the same reason. Only time I put it on is to go into a nuke zone. Really hard to get enough radiation resistance to avoid having to constantly pop rad-away any other way.
---
Thanks. I'll check there too resupply.
---
It's on twitch.
---
Nice 
---
I can mod all 3, and have one BOS chest plan for sale if you want to buy it
---
Ill be on in about 1 - 1.5 hours
---
Like collecting stars or something?
---
I'm sure that will be the case.  But, I'd still rather hit a content wall and wait a week for more than another few months.
---
Really? Why? Ps4 as well? What do they normally run? 
---
Teddy bear duping exposed!
---
Or maybe they will reintroduce star bottlecaps
---
It's game changing. 😃 no problem.
---
War Rider Armor Textures and Meshes have been in the game files (in the Atom Section) since the Beta. On one of the last updates (Dec?) the other ones were added. On the last Update Preview Images for the Armors were found in the actual Atom Shop [textures seen here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asralt/post_patch_6_new_pa_skins_data_mined/). They will be in the shop sometime in the future. I was able to overwrite the Meshes and Textures of the Raider and Ultracite armor in my Game to get a glimpse of what they look like. The Armor is still just Raider and it only looks different for me. Anyone else would just see the normal armor. I dont plan on using the overwritten files as i only did it for the previews.
---
God I hope I can reflect on this skeptical comment and be happy you were right 
---
But it's honestly not the most insane thing to expect.
---
Honestly, all of this sounds really cool. Am very excited for whats to come for sure.
---
Then it'll be bypassed by modders eventually.
---
The red one is khorn and the black one with the skull is slaneesh. Makes me wonder if this is official Bethesda offering. Seems good fan made
---
I did this quest just yesterday on Xbox! I hid in the lift as mentioned above and had no issues with crashing or anything, hopefully it’ll work for you too!
---
*hiccup* Maybe
---
I like to keep my 5mm above 10k.  When I drop below I start checking the market for sellers.
---
Thank you Bethesda.  This really is a step in the right direction and would love nothing better than for you guys to turn this around into one of the best online co-op, single player and pvp experiences around.  
---
pve and pvp separate of course which looks more and more like happening, I'd have a character for each ruleset depending on how I feel like playing.  Nuclear Winter sounds really interesting but please, please, please do not allow existing characters to swap between ruleset servers.
---
Ok thank you. Since you found a way to see the armor, do u think u have an estimated time for when they will be in the shop? Cause I saved up enough atoms for the mothman paint but I would want these instead, and I don’t know if I should wait or just buy the mothman right now
---
Don’t be sad when none of the pre-update stuff counts.  This is not a game that has an interest in rewarding hoarders. 
---
With circuits and logic gates, anything is possible.
---
Ummm.. I am a gunslinger pistol build no sight level 46... I am going to try answer ur question. I dont think that western .44 is generally a stronger weapon. But u and the other poster are absolutely right about reload time. But it does fire a lot quicker than the .45 revolver because of no recoil. Generally the .45 revolver does more damage than .44. The pistol with the most damage is the blunderbuss gun powder but reload is really long and only one bullet at a time. The fastest reload is actually a .38 pistol and has the biggest magazine. But fire rate wise i believe the 10 mm pistol and the .38 is the best but with the least damage. .308 pistol has the best damage other than the blunderbuss but as u can guess longer reload time. You can only craft the .38 .45 and .308. While the .44 10mm and blunderbuss u pick up during the game and can upgrade using the repair perk. The ones u can craft just build a new one very 10 levels.
---
So in summary i have all six on my wheel, and use them depending on who i am fighting but in most cases what bullets i have left. Sorry for rambling on but i hope i gave u an idea of the different options available to u.
---
For what its worth, the game did run like absolute shit until several patches in. That said, A lot of nit-picky complaints were grossly over-inflated. I can imagine that starting the game now is a much more pleasant experience. Those of us who were grinding out the main quest and major side quest lines during the BETA or thru the first 4 patches ran in to entire non-working quests and little to do after beating it. I now find myself playing for roughly an hour per day running the same events and wiping out all the vendor's cap stashes and farming nuked zones, all of which I still enjoy, and with just over two weeks until new content updates, you will not find yourself in nearly as much of a content-drought as those of us who pre-ordered. Welcome to Appalachia!
---
Oh man a whole Mole Man kingdom would rule!
---
Nope. I had received no notification of the workshop being contested. We were literally just standing around after defending it against some dogs.
---
Yw
---
That would make sense for the use of the word shear, as you can shear sheep as well. 
---
im in America too and guess what? My credit card company said fuck bethesda and gave me my 59.99 for the game and all 200$ money spent on the atoms so fuck em XD
---
Yeah no suppressor is a non-starter. Thanks!
---
I don't think you'd see them on the map if they're sneaking.  Probably a good idea to hang out around there for a while every now and then.
---
Until your cousin comes over and smokes ... er drinks all your stash. 
---
I love griefer proof bases! I made a base where you can’t enter unless you fast travel, and no one would even know it is there unless I showed them and it gives me peace of mind knowing that my hard work can’t be destroyed 
---
No idea on timeframe. The fact the previews are in the files are a good sign though.
---
&gt; Bethesda you beautiful bastards.
---
I understand the hype, but they don't exactly deserve praise for the clusterfuck that was the first few months of this game. Credit where it's due, but let's be real. 
---
Almost heaven
---
Basically what spring bring is nothing....  
---
Vending machines- We already have communities with thousands of players instead of 26.    
---
Backpack- We already playing without them and we are doing fine.   
---
Unique mask- why would I want them, things that doesn't make you stronger not have much value. Can play without them  
---
Brewing nuke colas- Really valuable (sarcasm)  
---
Camera- wtf? Is this an online game or online photograph simulator?  
---
New quests- well they are nice, but they don't last long.  
---
New Legendary vendor- Well yeah it is great...if you are starting now, what about those thousands of player who already farmed their sets and have nothing to do?  
---
So basically "the black sheep" survival mode will be the only take from spring.
---
So, long story short, until summer game stays still garbage.  
---
Unlikely.  Top tier items will still be in demand. 
---
Just gives us another option for getting rid of trash legendaries.
---
This. This is being reasonable and mature. Behold their strength weaklings and despair your lack!
---
....Sorry, got a little melodramatic there
---
They'll still bitch about it. Wait for the hype to die down before the "Anybody else disappointed Bethesda didn't give us X?" posts happen and get upvoted.
---
This sub likes to jerk the developers off. Any well warranted criticism is downvoted to oblivion 
---
Im on PS4 sadly.
---
But thanks for the offer! &lt;3
---
At 300 I can imagine how legendary i will be. SBQ will poop her fissure cave when she hears my footsteps 
---
That could be addressed though (make the bodies intangible when carried). Same for the weight carry exploit: make it so you either can't carry non-empty bodies or so the weight is added to your own.
---
I get why it's still not okay though. Quite a few quests depend on finding items on bodies.  Still a pain in the ass though when a legendary drops and your teammate can't see it because on their screen its in an awkward position. Being able to move it would help that immensely.
---
I agree. I mean it’s pretty obvious that no living people was a story choice since the main plot line looks like a single-player plot except there’s no lone hero who shows up in time to bridge faction divides and stop misunderstandings like in a typical single player RPG. 
---
If you're on PC, I have a few hundred up for sale. 10c each. Even have some super stimpacks for 15c each. LMK if you're interested.
---
"Because something didnt happen to me it doesnt exist so quit your bullshit."
---
Every thought about a thing that is called "differing experiences"?
---
I personally agree with /u/Ruggle i played for about 80h or so and quit more than a month back because the constant griefing attempts got to me and ruined the game for me.
---
Yeah it might not be "real" griefing, but if people follow me, spam their mics and shoot me while they do that as a group of 3 or 4, that stops being fun after the first time and definitely is almost unavoidable without quitting and rejoining the game further along.
---
Sure not everyone will have the same experience, but in my opinion the game would have been infinitely better if they would have just separated PVP and PVE servers.
---
No you don’t see sneaky players, which definitely could be part of it. 
---
Wait....what?  I thought I had to kill the Wendigo while I was wearing the clown outfit.  I gotta take that thing to a dressing room?
---
Maybe I'll come back and play it next year when it's playable
---
I can't give more information until we're closer to its release. Stay tuned :)
---
Once they fixed the really game breaking bugs it got better. I'm definitely in your camp, I don't see why it's so horrible. I will say I am disappointed by the camp system, but just because I want more build limit and (more importantly) the ability to build little towns with friends.  
---
I'll also say it's so far my favorite Bethesda Fallout in terms of story. The complete lack of npcs should hurt this, but treating it as you walking through the just-post-apocalypse and hearing the stories of how bad it was for people actually has emotional weight. It feels genuinely tragic, like the end of the world really did mean something. I don't know if they could have hit that mark with living npcs.
---
Always was worth it :)
---
Will this go to your workshop budget ? I hope the cost is gonna be super low
---
Yeah. Chill. :)
---
so u what u are saying is you dont know it was a two shot explosive, but you are big mad someone called you on it.
---
No. I was asking "what?" not to denigrate it, but to ask what he's talking about. 
---
Give it time. What was included in the roadmap wasn't everything. I think the coming ITVs, especially those the week before a drop might have info on that next weeks drop.
---
For example, I bet the april 9th update with player vending and placing junk at camps will increase camp budget, or at least rework it.
---
March dude here too. Except I'm cool and my birthday is first day of spring. :)
---
Yeah.  Getting him to wear the hat is the hardest part...
---
I only unlock them for the silver ps4 trophies
---
Here’s a suggestion: Battleroyale
---
Not structurely stable you want bar immersion make a one lvl one
---
I think a lot of people don't realize that it was a story choice. I wish they would. No one can take a game or movie (new starwars lol) for what it is, it's the developer/director should have done this or should have done that. If Bethesda wanted there to be human NPCs, there would have been human NPCs. But I guess this is all just my opinion.
---
bUt It HaD bUgS aNd YoUtUbE sAiD sO
---
You're definitely not the only one!
---
Does this mean we will be able to find every suit of power armor and have it on display?
---
That would work really well on many levels I think. 
---
Bandolier, never be limited by carry weight again. (Almost)
---
^^^ I have to agree. The sudden overwhelming love for this game hurts.
---
Ive been thinking about reinstalling this game for a few days and now im ready to pull the trigger
---
Don’t need to prove anything to you but glad you’re backing down cause you know you’re wrong, peace!
---
thank you very much for the free content. I really hope it will be a great success.
---
Oh I’ve already done that, and like I said I plan to play again after the trickle of content is over.  If you don’t give a flying fuck, leave your opinion on a shelf. 
---
Cool man I was just giving my input you don’t gotta get all worked up about it lol
---
Some people are too busy judging and reacting to actually think, it’s true. 
---
Fallout76 is a great game.  Don't let the negativity tell you otherwise.  Sure, there is a lot of truth in the negativity, but that truth is being altered by updates from Bethesda.  The issues ARE being addressed.  The problems ARE being fixed.  Even before all that, it's still an awesome game.  My wife, who rarely plays games, made me buy two copies so we could play together.  And she's still enjoying the game. (Me too)
---
If you are a Fallout fan, then you can't pass up this game.  Buy it and play it now, don't like what you see, just wait a few months and try again.  Its a good game now, but it will only get better from here.
---
There needs to be a player hub.  Without that camp destruction becomes a serious concern for those worried about it.  
---
Most likely we will still see people posting on the market/LFG with locations listed. Something like “Come by my camp at Alpha for AA pistols”
---
they said winter at the earliest
---
zzzzzzzzzz
---
Just remove your turrets when you leave the area. Nobody wants your "services".
---
It's very annoying as a sneak melee build when I start my farming route and hear turrets luring all the ghouls away and most of the time, finishing them off. Will level camp everytime, bounty is meaningless.
---
Good point on the shared inventory.
---
As a trader I can tell you that not just the lower levels but a good half of errybody will run away. Some people don't like friends.
---
I heard it's only from Uranium Fever but I haven't had any luck yet. 
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
Does this reduce ballistic ammo or all ammo?
---
seriously. the drama surrounding the game has officially become more exciting than the content + end game content of the game. fo76 reddit is literally the end game dungeon lmao
---
Ahahah
---
Maybe it’s both. Or some kind of sheep man. 
---
Find anything ?
---
sweet! thanks
---
this.
---
“Over a million copies sold” and how many of those people tried to wrestle a refund from Todd?
---
I hope that others can't come through all Willie Nillie and loot our C.A.M.P.S. designer aesthetic touches. However, I have a feeling that's exactly what will happen. 
---
It also makes me curious what sort of control we will have in the placement of our amassed booty... Will we have the same feature as in 4 where we had a big ol pile of our junk in the middle of the floor where we used out invisible hands to strategically finnangle items on to a specific shelf, stand, piece of furniture ect. 
---
I would really dig the ability to have the different boxes for their respective item type such as... Such as using my dresser by my bed for my clothing and armor, my icebox for my food, medicine cabinet for chems, an explosive box, ammo box, and so on and so forth.
---
270 hours in..... I've seen Grahm once, on my first day, when I had zero caps.
---
I would assume neon signs require a couple nuclear material, glass, and metal. What does it actually entail? 
---
Well you can get that later at least.
---
All hail our God.

Hope it’s fixed soon but on the off chance it’s not I’m going to buy the serum recipes one by one to re-apply my mutations but also as insurance for the future in case there’s any further issues in future patches, I’ve got 6 mutations but only 4 I’d say were essential so by my maths with a daily vendor run earning 1400 caps per day I should have the 4 recipes I really need in a total of about 8 weeks from the enclave bunker and who knows maybe il get lucky with a SBQ drop (not banking on it though). Was really gutted by the bug as I paid full price at the bunker for my mutations, I don’t have the patience or attention span for farming them, server hoping and all that so I’d rather not remove them if I don’t have to, anyway fingers crossed it gets fixed sooner rather than later
---
Or, more likely, drive players towards P2W purchases, since fighting griefers is their one legitimate use.
---
Anyway, best of luck on your bizarrely self-loathing and co-dependent relationship with the game, and please help yourself to the last word. 
---
Coincidentally my cousin both plays Fallout 76 AND smokes. lol
---
This idea is a sub feature of a community / faction system (TOWNS was the most popular thread so far about this) which could have leveling , building that was joined together, stash being one the biggest benefits for it , and possibly even perks and permanent presence on a server, alliances or rivalries with others who choose the same server. I’d be happy even just to have a social community tool so players could get together without all needing to be on each other’s friend list. But a full set of benefits to the persisting team would include this idea. I think it’s something that must happen for these coming updates to truly thrive. 
---
So you didn't change servers after like orbital... 3?
---
No you can’t unfortunately.  That should be a cool thing they add if they work on CAMP a little more!  I’d take some shutters on the brick walls.  😌
---
Snap. Me too, same Ammo. I store 1000 .38, .44, .45, 50, 5.56, 5mm for Team Mates in Stash. Excess gets dumped when I find low Levels.  I regularly drop .38 by the thousand
---
where previous 849?
---
Holy shi... Nice! Features, Quests, Gamemodes. Soon, in a few months? Bethesda, are you *really* sure you can deliver all that stuff in a playable condition? ;D
---
Personally I would like to see a 4 seasons feature (real life time scale) and the come back of human NPC factions with small bases and patrols, New Vegas style. I'm not interested in 10 different gamemodes, I'm looking for a clean PvE Mode without weird artificially crippled weapons or bullet sponges. PvP and hardcore-permadeath- survival modes are OK.
---
Probably not as many as you assume. Less than 5% probably.
---
Such yes
---
Personally waiting for more content to release
---
And that makes it a good solution?  How about they don't expect the expense and the grind to fall upon us as the players when they fuck up a mutation we spent time and money on...
---
Yep, they’re nicer because they’re not completely anonymous anymore.
---
huh. whattaya know. thats actually crazy
---
I couldn't care less about this shit, i just want to be able to explore for longer than 20mins without being over the carry limit.
---
That I have to dump 70% of my perks into weight reduction is absurd. It detracts from the gameplay because apart from the 15min breaks for inventory management I've also got to take breaks to reshuffle my perk deck so I'm not wasting anything. At this stage the game is split between inventory management and actual gameplay. If I have to struggle to get the game to a playable level why would I care about new content.
---
My main feedback to the big inside the vault call for input also includes containers for this express purpose, to serve as a buffer space - portable ones for me to supply my friends and strangers in the field and build able ones so I can keep my extra stuff for offer to them when they travel to my base. That could exist before and independently of the team / towns system and would solve the unfinished nature of drop bags and all the storage containers that exist but are just duplicate stash access points. 
---
I just placed my camp there, without turrets, and change servers until able to place.  Blocks the trolls in my game.
---
Once there are private servers it won't matter.
---
If you want to start from scratch, you do. If you don't you can just create a char with the same stats/unlocks/perks etc as your current vanilla character in a matter of minutes.
---
Or something completely else.
---
Such is a the beauty of private vs vanilla.
---
sadly tried that, but the turrets just kept reactivating for some reason! this hadn't happened the last time i attempted (launch codes expired right before i started launch prep). it was chaotic
---
There's even one at the gorge junkyard for a nasty surprise ...
---
That's the temporary jury-rig, there will probably be real fix when the next update rolls around
---
Are you going to lend them your time machine?
---
It would require them to assign items to personal storage item instead of player and since you can have more than 1 personal storage items, it would most likely require somewhat more effort to do. However, there is some benefit to that if, for example, player just wants to grab ammo and opens ammo container (or whatever else he keeps ammo); this way server would have to load only portion of his whole stash.
---
AFAIK OP is not asking for each container to have separate 800 limit.
---
I remember in F4 that I had separate containers for headwear, boots, glasses and such. Made it much easier to grab stuff I wanted.
---
you know you can upgrade it in a workbench to make a boppin ass weapon?
---
i would love to but no. 
---
Right. Saving my atoms up.
---
You know what they say. You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a Raider.
---
report him for what, exactly?
---
Report him for what ?
---
So, then what's the point? Do you really think they should shut it all down and wait about 3/4 of a year?
---
Wouldn't mind a mode that  makes daily needs harder to  find, requires players to sleep now too.   As long as there are  additional  rewards  for  playing it.
---
The amount of effort to try and keep this game alive is... surprising to say the least.
---
Short  answer: ya gotta start over, it sucks, but hey think of it as starting a new toon after a graphics upgrade lol
---
don't deactivate the turrents, take off their targeting restrictions, that way they attack the robots and you can run free
---
It has been 100 days since launch.  The road map goes to 1 day before the start of Winter 2019.
---
Does this imply that Mar 12 will be Patch 7, and we'll be without an update until then?
---
Sick work! Excited for these!
---
have a look at andrewbadera's comment and the replies to princepapaya's comment. personally not very good at articulating advice so it makes sense, so it ends up as a jarbled mess
---
See here for quotes [https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/06/13/fallout-76-mod-support-confirmed-for-after-launch/](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/06/13/fallout-76-mod-support-confirmed-for-after-launch/)
---
Ah, yes. Well in that case, I apologize and retract my statement.
---
Keep doing Atom's work and destroying those CAMPs, Vault Dweller.
---
My apologies for accusing you of griefing.
---
I'm on .44, .45, .308 and 5.56 exclusively. Anything else when I'm clearing out room in my stash I dump in the register next to the Morgantown vendorbot because I'll never use it. One day I dumped 10 mininukes there because I can't help just grabbing everything I see and sorting through it later. I've dumped 2k 10mm rounds there more than once.
---
was fast travelling when they started. saw a 306 and 289 and got suspicious and fast traveled there
---
He came over to my camp and destroyed everything. Not to mention the unwanted conflict. That's a greifer. Don't agree? That's on you.
---
I was expecting that but hoping otherwise. Haha thanks!
---
YESSSSS as a duper tank you... 
---
btw to fix the duping method just make the server save the state of the caracher each second .
---
But does it guarantee that he would be safe from nuke if it was dropped on the location of his C.A.M.P.?
---
Nah b, gimme that no holds barred PvP bubblegum dropping server. It's aid, they said aid items might drop on death. I'm a simple man and I want to beat the bubblegum right out of you.
---
What is your system specs? What type of crashing? Blue screen? Whats the error message? And fyi i dont think system crashes are a common thing, game crashes yes. 
---
I hope they weren't 3*. There's people who collect those you know. And golf clubs. Sadly not a tire-iron collector yet, or I could retire.
---
I can agree on some of those things, but I can't agree it has gotten better and better. And a few things on the "roadmap" look good, but for a lot of people it's probably too little too late. I don't know if I will even still be playing by the time any of that is released. It's good that they are doing something, but they're not doing all of these things out of the goodness of their heart, they're doing them for PR and because they owe it to the people who have bought the game and are still playing it despite frustrations and game breaking bugs. They prioritized some other project over Fallout 76. Just like EA/BioWare did with Mass Effect Andromeda for Anthem. Anthem doesn't seem to have turned out any better for it. And I'm wondering if the future Bethesda projects will either.
---
the point is they could release amazing game.  and not rush.or do you think they did everything right? one more year of develepment is nothig against how they ruin their reputation. it would take long time to clear it now.
---
Naa duping isn't fully patched yet, We'll know when they think it is since that's when they stated they will reinstate those suspended on the recent wave.
---
Seriously, the circle jerk needs to stop. So what they released a road map? Why are we praising them for fixing something that shouldnt have been broken?
---
so? that's part of the game. there's no rule against griefing or unwanted conflict.
---
Funny everyone I know who has played this game sees as a boring buggy mess. I’ve got 20 hours in but I’m not going to stop till I hit level 50 even though I’ve already experienced this sad derivative fallout 4 mod has to offer
---
Thanks for being so patient with us! I know it was a rough road waiting for it, it was just as rough waiting for it to be finalized to share with you all! I'm so excited to be able to talk about these things!
---
I loved everything about the roadmap, except for having vending machines at my camp.  The other day I had to go through like four servers before I found one where my camp was available.  If everyone starts advertising that their camp is there, people will see that it's a good spot, and it will become impossible to find a server with it free.
---
It will also definitely lead to people destroying your camp.  Some people will do it because they're jerks, others because your selling the same things as them, and some will do it because your camp is in the spot that they want.
---
If something like fallout really happened.  There would definitely be central vending locations, like diamond city in fallout 4.  No one would want people coming to their homes at all hours of the day.  It would make your home unsafe, which really defeats the purpose of having a home.
---
I 100% agree.  There's a mod for Fo4 that does it and it's perfect.  Also hope it comes with a CAMP size increase
---
There's no rule against griefing? Push off mate that's the dumbest thing I've heard. EVER. 
---
No. I run unyielding armor with max luck on my builds. I don't get significantly more or better loot than any of the people I play with. I do think I get more perfectly preserved pies tho...
---
I believe this is not the case. Can mods undo this? 
---
Probably did sell some 3*s, but id say a lot were 1s.
---
Not yet, checked one spot near johnsons acre but didn't find anything.
---
Did meet and greet 3 mothmen after each other in 6 min 
---
but there isn't. there's even a perk called Wrecking Ball for people to deal more damage against camps.
---
Thank you so much for pushing through everything with us. There are some companies that would just jump ship when things go sour, but you were determined to keep this game rolling and improve on it, taking our suggestions and fixing all bugs we reported very quickly. I’m very excited to see what this year brings for 76!
---
Not really, when I've gotten them crying in frustration on microphone to the point one of them raged so bad after I killed him a half dozen times he literally dropped his entire inventory guns and armor and all then logged off and was never seen again. Lol
---
Nah.. we should be able to have gobs of turrets.  But - they should extend the "no build zone" around the golf club to be outside of the range of all possible turrets.
---
I would never be getting bounties if it wasn't for this.  Right now, I land one about 3 times per week.
---
The road map doesn't specify dates other tham March 12th. Where are the other dates you found? 
---
I can't wait to brew all the Nukashine and set up a little brewery CAMP to sell to players!
---
Or just do the WOW thing. Have the scorched still around (handwave them as remnants perhaps) and the scorchbeast 'queen' dead as far as NPCs are concerned but can still spawn the boss if you want
---
I doubt private servers will allow you to just make a new character and decide theyre same level as your old with whatever stats and perks you want.
---
Is this what a cult looks like?
---
obviously, no for-profit business is ever going to do anything for any reason other than to generate a profit. This isn't a "I &lt;3 Bethy thanks for the content" post, but rather calling out the large entitled, impossible to please portion of this sub who regurgitated the youtube-manufactured outrage surrounding this game.
---
correct, no reason to get hyped over a title. shitty roadmap tbh
---
Yeah I bought the game few weeks ago, no regrets. Having a lot of fun with it. Im still low level since life got in the way but it really is a good game. 
---
Yeah dude, the man is right. There's literally a "I'ma destroy your shit more better" perk. It's an intended mechanic.
---
Whatever you say mate. Griefing someone just because you can is still just that. There's no excuse for it. If you're gonna be an arsehole at least pick on someone your own level.
---
I don't think using duped ammo is what causes problems for the servers.  The problem is the methods used for duping the ammo.  Once it's made the damage has already been done.
---
Funny, everyone I know is the opposite of you. Everyone I play with thoroughly enjoys the game. 20 hours? That's like scratching the surface man...  You seem to surround yourself with people just like you. Pesemistic as fuck.
---
Speaking of awesome things you guys added...any way we can bribe you (in Atoms) to put the Blackbird armor back up for sale?
---
Xbox 1s. I hear a beep and it shuts off. Only when playing 76. Just did it again for the 4th time in 15 minutes. No error messages just beep and buh bye
---
maybe you're right, I'm not arguing that. just that it's an intended mechanic. Bethesda is well aware and wants players to behave as such.
---
Yep, both. Especially endgame
---
If the servers really are 300% more stable, please give us SIZEABLE increases to stash space and camp budget.
---
$60? Try $80 each. Three copies for the family.  But we’ve enjoyed it...bugs and all. 
---
one time, I speculated a hidden secret maybe lying behind the munition factory area. I took my friends and we passed by Car Henge, which was awesome, took a few photos and moved on. We came across a secret cave that had a fatman in a dufflebag for one of us and we continued until we reached a pickup, with a lvl3 Safe on its back. I thought to myself that this should be holding the secret that I have yet to discover.
---
Slap on those three cards.
---
Break a few bobby pins...
---
Then click... there it was...
---
A pen.
---
and that was the last time I picked a safe.
---
Fml
---
I'll wait and see on this one. Legitimately could be good. But I'm going to stay away from the game entirely until such time that it isn't an inventory management simulator anymore.
---
that's actually in their roadmap that they published today
---
Dead game.
---
Just seems like a really shite thing to do. I may just chalk up the 30 bucks I payed for it and just uninstall. That's not cool...
---
WERE GETTIN SKYRIM LEVEL ITEM PLACEMENT BOIS. NO MORE EMPTY BOOKSHELVES
---
My thought on it is that if objects are manipulable for CAMP builders they'll likely lock down static on build mode exit. There is already support for this in the engine and a mod for FO4 that does it.
---
Question because I never played this game and I am not really up to date with it: is this game like the Bethesta Version on Battlefront 2? Like with a horrible launch and now a slow recovery?
---
Stop. A man can only get so erect.
---
2000 is... not impossible. I was saving up shotgun shells for a week and wasn't checking how much I had.
---
 Turned out I had 3000! 
---
Stacked as a group it's 60 up which is nearly 20% increase in max health for most players. That isn't insignificant.
---
According to this sub, you are correct.
---
What does a backpack do in this game?
---
You didn't really answer my game. Are you suggesting that they shut the game down, and then open it up again in the fall?
---
&gt;So can we all agree that the state of the game has done nothing but get better and better from the get-go
---
Agreed without a qualification. 
---
&gt;and that Bethesda was ***never trying*** to scam you
---
Agreed with emphasis added. 
---
&gt;an empty MMO that would never be supported only to pocket your cash and give you the finger?
---
Here's where I have questions as someone who hasn't played the game. 
---
From what I gather FO76 has some deep seated technical issues born in part from rushed development and by using a game engine not ideal for a multiplayer game of this nature. 
---
It's great to see Bethesda put out a 2019 road map though without addressing the deep seated technical issues underlying FO76 are we likely to ever see a game half as good as the original vision. 
---
Before anyone thinks I'm being too critical, just know I'd gladly pick up copy of FO76 had I a PC powerful enough or a PS4/Xbox One. Thanks to the discounted price that is.
---
Or maybe trying to gatekeep what other people should or shouldn’t get excited about is creepy and pathetic.
---
Good bot
---
I'm thinking people might be able to steal your displayed stuff. That could make things interesting. 
---
That proves nothing. Its not representable of normal game play. 
---
Apparently players aren’t allowed to be hyped for a game lol
---
Fuck no dude. The game is a mess and I love it
---
r/woooosh
---
Ultracite Ammo is way harder to get than regular ammo. Your opinion is pretty uninformed. 
---
I'm hoping they display weapons 
---
You don't get points after level 50, but, at that point you can pick a card, or transfer a point. Meaning, you can get as many different cards as you want. If you have, say, 15 points in Strength, you can still keep picking Strength cards and simply juggle them as you need in different situations. 
---
yes.
---
I'm gonna have to restock my teddy bears! 
---
20 hours is scratching the surface? Oh do tell , when does the fun start? Also not pessimistic I basically got a free Xbox one X because it came bundled with this “game”.  It’s alright I’m sure the reviewers are lying and this game is secretly a masterpiece after 800 hours
---
Yup my new home is made of brick and I wish it had better interiors too. 
---
It’s crooked 
---
r/woosh
---
Everything looks so so so good.
---
How do I get on the dark net been trying for weeks got ipvanish ect
---
This will (hopefully) be the solution when they advance the story. That way no one has to worry about which servers anyone is joining. 
---
I only get bad 1 star legendarys there, why farming them?
---
Encountered a turret base there, a low level dude with a 10mm auto and rocket turret support. Seriously, I don't care if they farm XP. I gave him all my legendary drops and some plans. At the end there were about 6 players crafting stuff in his little base and gifting him.
---
Farm somewhere else if lv50+. Other locations are better anyway. West Tek is quite good for 3 stars.
---
and say public sorry for realising the game in this state.
---
Wow really added this one to my list. Also thunder mountain I imagine. Didn't have an official event for it but one flew up and attacked for a bit. 
---
How do I keep getting new cards is what I mean :O
---
It's a conspiracy man. All hype for anything ever is an inside job put on by the company's employees. Do not be hyped for things. You are not allowed. You are robot.
---
just let me enjoy my snow
---
Not really, it's a staple left over from the TSE meta.
---
So, to make you happy, they have to shut down the game, and start it up again in the fall. So as to appear to what? Have the release of a better game?
---
And what about all the people that are playing now? That want to play. That are looking forward to march and the start of new content?
---
Because to it also seems like you want everything wiped clean, so it would be insane from the start. 
---
Is that fair to all the players who would lose all their stuff? 
---
So, they have to be unfair to thousands of players to make you happy?
---
maybe for you. I won't even get into the merit of mules, a hardcore player could definitely acquire, say, 100K steel in 30 days.
---
and apparently that's all it takes to ban someone.
---
Treasure maps. The ones you buy out of the machines. Very rare drop though.
---
Maybe it's like each star you scrap gets you a spin on the wheel of guns.
---
I'm a small minority but I want your bubblegum. I want the plain, I want the flavors, just all of it. Gimme
---
Instigating
---
Seems like they are improving with the updates. Bought the game on launch day and for the longest time it was just rolling pins and tire irons from the SBQ. Right after the latest patch I got an explosive Gatling from SBQ and ultracite receiver schematics from level 80 SB. Maybe they realized how silly it was, or maybe I just got lucky. I still chose to spend a lot of time in Cranberryborg area just because it’s fun to fight tough enemies with different weapons and tactics. It would certainly be nice if there’s some decent rewards after all the ammo and time spent. WS Ghouls are far more rewarding but it gets stale real quickly. 
---
Man, this is damn awesome! I already enjoyed the game but the prospect of more to come is super exciting.  Keep up the work Bethesda.
---
I encounter a bug where I check the lock, see that it’s a level 2 lock and I’m level 0.  Then I equip the right level of lock picking but I still get the level 2 lock with skill level 0 text. So I wind up walking away out of disgust. 
---
Why would they give up? 
---
Im cdn. Most of the sales are for region pocked keys. Would a bon work? Or would i get banned?
---
Years of Diablo 2 and 3 has trained me for this moment. My body is ready. 
---
Nice. And which of the rifles would you recommend to go for?
---
My husband and I pretty much split them up. So I do the lockpicking and terminals, while he goes around killing things and keeping me safe until I get everything unlocked. I also verbally read out all of the notes we pick up, and play the tapes over my speakers. We work as a team to get pretty much everything done.
---
People stopped giving a crap now that they saw the "roadmap" 
---
Very interested where we are with AR atm
---
Depends on what you're after.
---
I'm a sniper build that does the same thing that you are *but* I've recently starting farming the ghouls in Whitesprings. I'm running a hunting rifle modified into a sniper rifle, and recently managed my first legendary sniper rifle, it's Hunters and doesn't do anymore damage against ferals but it's a plus against the Yao Gai, Wolves and other animals that occasionally show up around the resort.
---
My old Sniper Rifle is modified for use against the Scorched, and I'm currently looking for a Ghoulslayer's hunting or sniper rifle.
---
Based on that and as to rifles only, as I have not used a quad, I would say Instigating/Explosive as an all around, and for feral farming, Ghoulslayers/Explosive. Limb Crippling is good too if you go for the knee:)
---
This has restored my hope in this game. I used to ignore this sub and almost gave up on Bethesda. I’m glad this popped up on my feed. Thank you. 
---
This is just a straight up lie. Mostly it will create a bag with yet another infinite load.
---
People that got banned submitting tickets
---
when you level, it asks do you want to pick a card or change a stat. Choose pick a card.
---
As someone who sees Grahm 70% of my play sessions. He has routes but he is a random spawn encounter and he also despawns. He likes wanderers. He spawns on me (literally in front of me) a lot. The maps of his routes are all incomplete, I have seen him in many places that they do not list.
---
Check the one up at the top of the forest , that’s more specific .
---
honestly, reports of technical issues after this many patches is largely overblown, nit-picky, or no greater than any other game. Client and server stability are miles better than the BETA or launch versions of the game, and continue to improve. I wouldn't call any bug or glitch in the current version "game-breaking", maybe "playstyle-breaking" as a stretch if your playstyle requires one specific perk or mutation that may currently be bugged and will obviously be fixed in due time just like everything else.
---
i personally would've rather the game not come out 4 months ago, but came out march 12 with all this stuff right away.
---
If you want
---
he would open his coat and say: 
---
-Got some rare things on sale, stranger!
---
-Whaddaya buyin'?, Whaddaya sellin'?
---
"Banned Duper" *what a weird name, may be one of the developers* 
---
took me a while :( 
---
Woww okay I thought it completely stopped at 50. Thank you both so much!
---
Thought the same but it looks like they haven't answer any of those via here and Twitter and other social media sites... 
---
Anthem has been getting really really good reviews actually, so chances are they will rightfully continue to call out the garbage Bethesda continues to try to peddle with this game.
---
Now you just need some cream to go with it. 
---
 i dont care about them as of many people who dislkes fo76 do. But know what all people love and what they care about? Polished, great games with minimum lags, bugs and glitches. Please, dont cry for this answer.
---
She's a keeper dude.
---
:)))
---
Wastlander release includes even more surprises. Human NPCs???? :)
---
great idea, thanks

---
yeah I only play solo and so do many others
---
I play alone all the time when you start out make sure you enable pacifist mode so you won’t get one shot by high level grievers. Strength helps you be able to carry more crap intelligence makes crafting easier and luck controls the durability of legendary items the drop as well as what loot you find in certain places. Don’t rush through the quests wait till you’re like level 50 because you’ll get better quest rewards
---
Yeah just read it, sounds very cool
---
You know the game in the bundle doesn't make the Xbox the free part right?
---
You should change your name to CapnWetBlanket :-D
---
I thought about that too.  I guess we'll see.  
---
I’m an adventurer, not a farmer :p
---
Jokes aside. If I can get an instigating explosive. What would your third trait of choice be? Like reloading faster or rate of fire etc, etc. and If you had a choice, what rifle. The hunter converted into a sniper rifle or a lever action, gauss or handmade.
---
Thats pretty much what im saying. As soon as im done fighting mobs, i pull out my gatling plasma an immediately start on the queen. But as soon as she flies away, the others dont switch to the mobs. 
---
You also are awarded the pack of cards every 10 levels after 50 I think
---
Used to do cap stashes. Now I'm a trader. I got all my weapon weight reduced armor and I literally run up to strangers with an entire arsenal of arms and ammo and sell them shit. I also do PvP when I can find bounties or workshops for it. Made about 18k last night, granted I didn't sleep and also lost about 2k cause pvp is hard sometimes and I die.
---
Backpacks!!
---
Lawn gnome and teddy bear time
---
He's got a set route AFAIK so if you're not in that area you won't see him. My house is on his route and I've seen him a dozen times or more. He travels up and down the center of the map as far as I have seen. He walked past my last house near the big bend tunnel east exit a lot and now he walks past my house in summerville.
---
Crashes, infinite loading screens, disconnects, are totally game breaking, and they still happen. Maybe some of them have improved. Maybe they have fixed some of them. But things being broken every patch doesn't equal "done nothing but get better and better ".
---
Yes, and they had other bigger things to complain about with the game at that time. Remember that happened the same time as when they released an old patch as a new one. So they were busy covering that at that time. Not to mention people WERE complaining about it when it came out calling it p2w.
---
That's what I hope for, I miss my FISTO assaultron model.
---
Definitely....  I’ve played over 500 hrs totally solo, all quests etc, it’s much more immersive solo because you can take your time listening to holotapes, reading notes etc and soaking up the atmosphere
---
Players would buy that Disease Cure stuff up like gangbusters... so how much? (PC, on at night, US)
---
I agree. A special vendor zone, like maybe an old vault-tec sales demo vault that gets "discovered" and turned in to a flea market. Allows for persistent vendors, and the flea market fees ensure that abandoned vendors go poof to keep clutter down.
---
Based on how that mirrors the Nuka World DLC mechanics I have to agree.
---
 English. Your enthusiasm is all you have, to put it another way.
---
Protectron vendors and robobrain serving staff. 
---
Best I got out of one was a map, and technical data. Technical data found in a Watoga diner of all places.
---
Explosive Vents, yeah those don’t work in Fallout 76, bro.
---
My hope for choices and consequences - No on Faction. Factions own work shops. Work shops control territories. Factions get bonuses for controlling territories. 
---
They spawn down in Cranberry Bog, I’ve had 2 spawn when I took over the Abandoned Bog Town workshop :)
---
Don’t sweat the points for the most part. You pick one card from each category when you level up. You get a card and a point. When you hit level 50 you can move a point to a different category or select a card.
---
They have answered people I've been in a discussion with support
---
No but it made front page so I clicked on it and saw a bunch of fake comments, so I put in my two cents. Now I won't ever come in this sub again even if it makes front page.
---
How much will actually work?
---
It actually sounds a lot like the basic mechanics going on with the Nuka World DLC where the new factions were introduced and (eventually could) invade the main map.
---
 This entire "awesome fallout friends" thing razes hackles on my neck. More English. ;)
---
Pacifist doesn’t prevent you from getting shot, it prevents you from accidentally shooting someone else.
---
Dude it's so great when people don't get all salty after a good scuffle.
---
Stash item decoration they did it it’s complete 
---
The #1 thing that stopped me and my friends from continuing to play  is the stash size. Put simply, it's not fun having to micromanage inventory to this degree, especially in a game designed around scavenging. A small stash increase isn't good enough - especially with all this DLC down the road. 
---
We really need a good storage solution. Multiple boxes. Lighter items. And don't give me that "server" stability nonsense. We are in 2019...I have items from my 2004 original vanilla WoW account that was inactive for 10+ years still saved. 
---
I've honestly never experienced a crash, infinite load screen, or server disconnect that wasn't immediately remedied for the day by a single reboot of my xbox or the game client. I can't speak for any other platform but I can't seeing it be that bad for any one platform in particular when I've had so little issue with it for at least 3 patches. 
---
I keep all 6 cards equiped while leveling up and exploring... after around level 50 I realized they were pretty much pointless and a waste of time.  Hardly anything good comes from them, and I needed more specific builds for taking on the SBQ and couldn't afford the points for them.
---
They definitely need to be considered passive skills learned just from leveling up and not perk cards.
---
Looks great!
---
2 community managers commenting on my comment in the same day. Nay, only a few hours apart. Thanks for this awesome stream of back and forth. You guys are killing it today!
---
Right back at you!
---
Was worth it at full price, not many games I've put this many hours into. Yes it has bugs, crashed yesterday when I was just about to kill the last boss in the armaments event &amp; then couldn't get back to that world :( 
---
I was frustrated as hell, but still kept playing for another 4 hours . Buy it, its not a 20 hour game, you can get easily over 100 hours of gameplay or more.
---
Are you banned or were banned in the recent login issue? If so can you share what is happening or your case? I'd appreciate that! Thank you.
---
 But did the 9000 hour guy get his account back?! 
---
Reading your comment reminded me how people tend to remember the negative more than the positive. 
---
It sounds like the game's negative reputation is now worse than the state of the game would justify. 
---
There is still a bag of junk on the ridge west of whitespring golf, a level 68? SB fried my ass. First time venturing there with a lower level character....my weapons and armor stuck, back to the Forest I go. Made me wish I got in on the duping when duping was good.
---
Whoa there, boah. I've gotta get the money first, then we can disappear to West Virginia.
---
maybe you should do your research buddy
---
The luck of the draw perk doesn't work with the axe either. The fact that this is one of the few modless weapons has me assume its lack of mods is to blame for its I compatibility with the appropriate reparation perks.
---
Good to know 
---
So when do we get modding support? Or dedicated servers? More telling what's NOT on the map than what is.
---
I might even save some body parts and turn my alt into a true raider
---
"call him out for not mentioning something"
---
"but he did mention something"
---
"shut up" &lt;--- that's you
---
If you do not want to initiate in pvp with another player and they persist, you can block them for the session.  This will remove your name marker from their map, making it near impossible for them to find you.  If they are actively destroying your base, your best bet would be to re-log into a new server where the other player is not present. Hope this helps! 
---
Before you hit level 50 and all your points are placed, If you’ve maxed out strength at 15 points but want to pick another strength card for example when you level up next you can, on Xbox you use the left and right bumpers after choosing where to put your point so for example maybe you want to put a point in charisma but want a strength perk card, choose charisma then use the equivalent buttons on your platform to,cycle through all of the perk cards under all the different S.P.E.C.I.A.L categories and then select
---
 Whoop de do. I'm sorry. ;)
---
DDO had an option called True Reincarnation, which fit because ... duh ... D&amp;D. You basically start over from level with a small bonus and your stash and could play something different. 
---
I see this as the same but with ... "LEGENDARY PC HAS MUTATED"
---
One of my favorite mmo mechanics ever.
---
Free was exaggeration, but yes my brand new Xbox one X in its Fallout 76 box was being sold at 35% off its retail price because nobody was buying them
---
But the radworms have TB.
---
Yeah I have been "suspended" and I'm not to pleased with why or they current method or the time frame I have recieved if you want you can dm me and I will link my discussion I don't really feel like poating more on here to just be downvoted and hated upon by the toxic ends of the community. Currently waiting on my most recent question to be responded too but I'm not to hopefully it will be answered as normally it qould have been answered before I got home fron work.
---
Not sure FO76 has "safe spaces" or snowflake zones.
---
I missed the part where I said I was leaving.
---
Reading comprehension not your strong suite there bud?
---
Just move your camp and it's all rebuilt. It usually blueprints it too. Even if you move it 10 foot.
---
No, and it sound like it is functional. Weight increase?
---
Love it if you had options ... various weight boosts, maybe a cooler for a spoilage increase.
---
You morons haven't give up on this piece of shit yet? Jesus christ 
---
After seeing Bungie wrongfully ban thousands of people, than double down and say "nope their cheaters" and then two days later silently unban all the people they wrongfully banned, I'm going to defend the possible cheater over the greddy corporation every day of the week
---
 I got my first 'Make a Friend" cheevo, at a combined total of 140 odd levels ... so yes. ;)
---
Does the “move a point” work every level after 50 as well or only 1 point at 50?
---
What a selfish person you are. No seriously. This is a terrible thing to say. Sure it's a game, and in the big picture, a minor thing.  
---
But really, how mean of you. 
---
You can argue enjoyable, but it's been universally panned by critics and players alike. The game has potential and can get better, however, there's no way you can argue that the state the game was officially released in was good objectively. It was a buggy mess from the start. 
---
&gt;Over a million copies sold is, relative to other games, successful. Not relative tho their previous entries but relative to many other games it is.
---
Then that's not successful. It hasn't lived up to the success of the rest of the brand. You don't have to defend the game from me, I like the game. I played for a month and hit level 100. I haven't touched it since because there's no reason too. I've been waiting 3 months for something like this. If I didn't think this game would eventually get finished I would have canceled my preorder. I'm just a frustrated fan.
---
Hey! I’m having this issue, too, with video to go along with it. Could I follow up with you, as well?
---
The two things not on it: 
---
Modding.  
---
Private Servers.  
---
its rather telling that on a year long map, there's no mention of either.
---
I don't touch 0s but I will got to the ends of the earth for a 3. I found things like Auto grenade launcher plans, Gatling plasma plans, Minigun plans and a whole lot more in lvl 3 safes.
---
Yaay sounds good, whats ypur GT?
---
&gt; After seeing Bungie wrongfully ban thousands of people, than double down and say "nope they're cheaters" and then two days later silently unban all the people they wrongfully banned, I'm going to defend the possible cheater over the greedy corporation every day of the week
---
Nice, just got back from downrange and can now play for the first time. Seems like a good time to be getting into it
---
it's just the ash of dead people. 
---
Mwhahahahahahahahaha!
---
Too little too late. Try again next game
---
that's precisely what I'm getting at with this :)
---
Every level after 50 gives you the choice to move a perk point or select a perk card.
---
Starting at level 51, a pop up screen will ask if you want to move a point or pick a card. You get that option every time you level up. I have the max Strength of 15 points, and I need to move about 7 of those eventually.
---
The whole point of private servers is that the leaseholder decides what goes.
---
Hopefully mods won't have to go through Beth.net to get uploaded to the server because fuck that noise; regardless this is the simplest thing that will be achievable, it fact is not even a 'thing', is a 'non-thing'.
---
Think bigger :) 
---
No idea what max level is. So far I have seen a level 505 player. players in the 300's are very common.
---
"If you like the game you must be fake!" Immature viewpoint.
---
Whilst I appreciate your response, this is the FO franchise. Every FO game has been based on single player focus and coping mechanisms, keeping everything in case you scrap something that you need for later (unless you read every forum before you start playing), and an ability to set your own destiny. 
---
Not clarified in your objection to my comment I clearly stated that my wants, albeit my wants are simply a return to true FO behaviour of wander/scrap/hoard, are that a focus on stability and fixes are key and should be above any/all improvements or new editions. 
---
Since Patch 6 my XB1 session will crash any time after 30mins of play time when I end in a big battle situation - have come on here to check messages whilst I search for other posts about how to overcome the many and now seemingly regular considerable impacts to my experience. 
---
From your comments you seem to try to justify the bugs and glitches as acceptable because you read the "right forums" - perhaps suggesting that others who post concerns or complaints don't - which is a naive stance. 
---
I've sunk many hundreds of hours into Skyrim(s) and enjoyed every minute of it, as I have with previous FO's, so far from bashing B, I was simply highlighting that this level of instability, perhaps not experienced by you (noted the dollar sign and wonder where the game servers are for you compared to myself in the UK..) but clearly being experienced by many. I would not try to force anyone to get a refund, I was simply pointing out that because this is software there is no such option and your money has been taken - like paying to watch a movie and finding out its poor and feeling it was a waste.
---
Myself, I like fo76 a lot but would never call any of the FO games fun - it's post-apocalyptic hell and I sure feel every moment of stress when I'm creeping about hoping I see a Wendigo before it sees me so I can snipe or run. FO is engaging, enthralling, tense, frustrating but never could it be called fun.
---
I would not want to take my copy back but I am using a mature stance of looking at the current raft of issues from other peoples points of views and not, as you did, simply document you are laughing at them. 
---
If a person is not impassioned about the game and franchise, they won't understand the emotions - just as I admit I don't see the point in people getting so angst about their rival football teams but I know that's because I have no interest and consider it just a game. 
---
I have had an interest in all FO's and I do care that I am now bound by unnecessary (old-school perspective) limitations, instability affecting progression and game play, and no way of supporting a resolution nor seeking a redress. I reiterate that I want a stable game above all else, then I'll hope for a return to old school values (and an unlimited stash).
---
The team fight mechanics and PvP in general is buggy as shit. It happens pretty often on laggy servers where my mates will be hostile to someone attacking them and they appear non-hostile to me. 1/4 a HP bar is a bit much but probably he was actually hostile to your homie from the workshop but it just bugged out. It just works.
---
 Lever Action. I have an Instigating one and my Scorchbeast fights, which I get in all the time, are made easier by my ability to one shot nearly all the trash.
---
Can I enable pacifist on console?
---
They are trapped in their mining suits with nowhere for the poop to go.  You would be angry too.
---
I have the ability to adjust to the applications set up and remember how things work on them and across different OS. SO it doesn't bother me. 
---
As is tradition.
---
Replying to the wrong comment
---
That’s you
---
Happy early birthday, man!
---
I have ammosmith x3 and Super duper x3 and am still chronically-low an ammo because I'm cruising around the Watoga area and don't have a decent legendary rifle yet and I built my guy around rifles.  5.56 in the handmade even in semi-auto really goes fast.  And that's even with 4 rifleman perks, 3 blood messes and 3 tank killers.
---
On my 2nd character I've been ignoring them, taking none of the perks.
---
On my first character I had both perks maxed and found that the hardest locks always guarded the most worthless loot without exception.
---
I can't remember whether or not I needed any of the skills in when I ran a silo though. I kind of doubt it, but just don't know for sure.
---
O918
---
 (o = letter)
---
Yes I’m in PS4
---
Doubt it is fallout 76, make sure you do a hard reset and pull your power cable for at least secs to clear the cache. You might have some weird hardware fault. 
---
Do you have a friend with a XBV that you can test your disk if it is physical ?
---
Another DDO fan ... yes I want to TR ... loved that system. 
---
Only thing I wish we had was some faction or community bragging rights. "Responders have killed more SBQs than anyone ... suck it raiders!"
---
We did increase the STASH to 800 with this last update. We're going to continue to monitor that increase.
---
And yet no blame goes towards a corporation/game studio, who does -for a lack of a better phrase- Copy+Past of a game that had the same bugs/glitches/exploits as something that came out in 2015 and never got fixed. 
---
IMO majority of the blame lies on BGS at this point. Developing a half assed game which at best is just a copy+paste version of an older game and lets the community fix its issues for free, then fails to even try and incorporate the fixes into future updates.
---
And pretty much all kids toys (blocks, toy cars, toy trucks, I think even baby radles) and paint have lead.
---
The official statement when that rumor was going around was pretty clear. We won't ban you for mods, we will ban you for 3'd party cheating applications like cheat engine, but we also won't guarantee your game will perform at all with mods. 
---
This was mainly in response to people in the comments and the other posts on this sub that are bashing anyone who had anything negative to say about this game. 
---
Great question! We'll be sharing more details about how this works in the coming weeks, but we'll be sure to include an answer to this when we give a more detailed look at the legendary vendor system.
---
When there’s optimism and good news there’s positivity , what’s your point.
---
Alright! So can you collect the option to swap points or do you have to decide once you level?
---
Do you think I should just go explore the world and worry about builds later? I’m currently really enjoying the game! 
---
Aw, here it goes!
---
The bottom line of reading all of this.
---
You don't want the game to change from past games. 
---
You are unable to cope with that change, and as such, you can't not accept the game.
---
I'd honestly hate to live that way. 
---
Open your map then hit L1 go to setting then game and the bottom option is for pacifist mode
---
Let the circle jerk commence!
---
I’ve been here long enough to know when a comment is legitimate or not 
---
too little too late for your shit comment....now go away
---
I'm not "offended" but "Someone played the game in a way that in no way was meant to cause me harm, that asshole" makes you look like a very special kind of asshole. 
---
Or the more simply named [Goatman](https://cryptidz.fandom.com/wiki/Goatman)!
---
They're very creative when naming a lot of these Cryptids.
---
But wait there's more! Go roadmap go!
---
and you still visit the sub? who is the real moron?
---
Fair enough, I don't condone bashing people for their opinions, unless those opinions are baseless shitting on things. :-P
---
Honestly,this is the same company that fixes a visual bug and creates several game breaking glitches.The roadmap looks great ya,I just have doubts BGS can actually pull it off.
---
Cool thank you! I’ll be sure to strategize with space and legendaries haha 
---
I paid 60 for my copy and the 40 for my wife's tricentennial edition when it went on sale. We will probably start playing again when the updates actually come out.
---
My compass is too busy being off ~20° to be backwards. Although it's free game inside buildings like the Whitesprings.
---
Yeah maybe :) looking forward to finding out!
---
I just think it's hypocritical as fuck that you're objecting to people making the same content, while making a post that has been covered to fucking death. 
---
I saw it on popular fuckface
---
Fanboys have a really short memory.
---
You shall now be known as the "The Butcher Of Wes-Tek"
---
It's super fucking insignificant in a game where you can spam stimpaks that instantly restore 20% health MINIMUM before perks.
---
Not to fucking mention that's ONLY if you're in a full fucking group, alone it's an even MORE insignificant 15 fucking hp.
---
What makes it even less significant?  The fact IT NO LONGER EVEN FUCKING EXISTS.  It was a ONE WEEK event buff that is GONE.  You mother fuckers are trying to stir up shit as if Bethesda is at this instant selling guns with a permanent damage boost instead of a fucking trenchcoat and tights that gave a temporary minor health boost weeks ago.
---
i been complaining about this for months.
---
just doing this takes 1/5 of my budget?     [https://ibb.co/T2mwTRw](https://ibb.co/T2mwTRw)
---
or this that took 1/6?  [https://ibb.co/tKhGtK0](https://ibb.co/tKhGtK0)
---
neither of those are insanely outrageous, yet i had to take down a lot of my building just to put them up.
---
lol loser
---
He invented the internet and cured global warming.
---
I mean, the only thing that might be problematic is the custom name system. In which case... maybe remove that feature entirely? 
---
Well good thing I bought a 2nd copy for my son, who I can't get to play.  Mule time, baby
---
Make a Franken-Mutant
---
I want to say I really hope that "Ever Upwards" involves the Appalachian trail, and I really hope they put the [AT conservancy](http://appalachiantrail.org/home/about-us/get-in-touch/harpers-ferry-visitor-center) in Harper's ferry and that's where the quest begins. Because that would be amazing. And putting some white blazes on trees on the trail somewhere that you have to follow. It's way too much potential to waste. 
---
Also, while you're at it, how about the cobblestone wall plans, like in the pic above?
---
..!..
---
all aboard the hype train!!!
---
LOL actually tho haha. But wtf is this, are these glitched items lol
---
&gt;has there ever been a perfect game? 
---
Roller Coaster Tycoon
---
I liked them in FO3 and NV. You could help them avoid the path of fanaticism there. 
---
In FO4 the redeeming path (where Danae was supposed to take over) was sadly cut out. 
---
I’d love to cover my humble camp with scorchbeast wing fragments. 
---
I used to hit west-tek for radioactive goo and steel and lead all the time. I've probably been through there...twenty plus times. 
---
When you have just launched a nuke, are in the middle of a nuke zone, are managing multiple workshops, etc. "just rebooting" doesn't change the fact your game has been broken. Everything you have worked on is gone. Now maybe on some systems or in some circumstances you can rejoin the server, but that isn't applicable for everyone. And I'm almost certain this is one of the main factors that have driven many players away from the game, who would otherwise be enjoying the game and less frustrated by even some minor things being "adjusted" or broken with a patch or update. 
---
But on top of all of that, then there are the things that just add more straws to the camels back. Simple, basic things that if they played the game they would see for themselves need fixed, but haven't been fixed in all of this time, which lowers the value of the game and company in the eyes of the player seeing these bugs, however minor or nitpicky they may be, over and over again every time they log in and play.
---
So I just need to get this off my chest. Some people will just hate for no reason. I love this game. I have loved this game. I have been through a lot with it, spent hundreds of hours on it. From hours played I got my moneys worth. From bugs and frustrations I'm extremely disappointed. It didn't need to be this way. 
---
I'm not going to keep complaining about it, but I just need to get that message across. They made a great game, and ruined it by some bad decisions. Maybe they will recover. Maybe they will make the right decisions and put the right kind of resources into fixing it. I don't know. But I'll definitely be a lot more cautious next time.
---
I mean yeah, but I think I’d just be really antsy, not MURDEROUS over it lol
---
Fanboys, fanboys never change.
---
is that a thing lol?
---
Thank you :) 
---
Those robot spawn stations alllll over the place had me suspecting that a while ago.
---
Sweet. I've been debating shelling out for it, then this damn bug happened. Thanks for the data!
---
&gt;⁠Dupe bug that existed in Fallout 4 carried over to Fallout 76 unfixed.
---
I *love* seeing this sort of thing keep popping up.  Everyone else, every game, takes that list of bugs they never got around to fixing in the previous game as a starting point when making their new one.
---
Not Bethesda.
---
FFS, even Obsidian went through the effort to fix some of the bugs left in FO3 when they did FNV.
---
But you don't need to craft ammo, if unarmed was same/close to armed....which has advantage?
---
can you put any skin on any PA?  cos if it is just one skin per PA that fucking sucks, the X-01 looks like shit and that's all I rock
---
Sure.
---
Makes sense, especially if the game is meant to be ongoing and evolve
---
Agreed, would absolutely love to travel to the Kingdom of the Mole Miners.
---
Butcher Pete??
---
Side note do you have a screenshot you can send me? :)
---
Gonna finally put some pool balls on my pool table.
---
Have any of you learned anything?
---
Yes, upvoted. I sold my weapons thinking I could remake them later but realized you need the weapon to make the weapon. I wish we could refabricate them to get them back.
---
Hey there! [We have a general support article here for crashing on xbox.](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44380/kw/xbox%20crash)
---
Yeah, it's fun.  It has it's issues still but I've been playing it almost every day since Christmas and haven't gotten bored yet.
---
Give it the "ol in n out" with a power fist.
---
No idea sounds like it though 😆
---
But terminals give LoRe ;-;
---
making one right now, give me a few minutes
---
Time will tell. Maybe they got it together and realized that this is their only chance to actually save the game and bring back players, or it could turn into a crap fest. 
---
relax, this was angry comment for your crying messages. i dont liked how you turn this dialoge where i am very bad guy and you and people who like fo76 are poor child full of tears. i just made a post that if Bethesda release they game with no rushing then situation will be different for all. They would make more money, fans would be happy with a great game. Dont act like child. Beside that, there were plenty of posts where people ask Bethesda to rerelease game after fixing it like Square Enix did with FF. 
---
Looks like npcs are coming later this year
---
My guess is it will run as a new mode in the mode select menu so that new players can continue to leave the vault into the scorched storyline.
---
What is hunter/hunted?
---
Yep. Remember someone needs to need it, for the price you set. For low enough price even .38 should sell.
---
Well done sir. Well done.
---
Very much so yes.
---
Bring a few thousand rounds and don’t have a gun equipped when you fix the cores or it’ll take ammo 
---
I run a bloodied+rad build. I can die to invisible damage pretty damn quick. 
---
Thank you! You can DM it to me. I'm checking to see if these are in-game items, I personally can't recall seeing them myself but double checking with the team.
---
Bethesda is trying to replicate what Division 1 was able to do. 
---
Yes, I think it would be easy enough for them to add in the ability to refabricate items after you've completed all the quests. 
---
Buy it imo. Price might go back up No Man's Sky style once the new content in the Roadmap starts hitting.
---
Letme know when your online. Thanks again.
---
Thank you
---
I don't care if they  deliver on the rest of the roadmap, if they make the rest of the backpacks as good as the one they showed, I'm fucking sold.
---
Not a problem
---
I have no idea if that option stacks once you hit 50. Part of the fun is tinkering every level up, so I’ve never let them stack.
---
My one regret is putting points to boost weapon type damage and not investing in the cards that create better melee weapons.
---
No worries. Thanks for taking the time to reply.
---
Request received! Passing along :)
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm excited to see what they bring, but these posts have reached a level of hyperbole that I thought was impossible.
---
I'll join you, give me a few minutes to get my shit together :)
---
I saw a 900 once. Think I saw a 1400 but I may be getting that wrong.
---
Endgame isn't so great but the journey to it is fun imo.
---
Endgame is basically farm for legendaries and be disappointed in the rng.
---
The Minutemen being an accurate representation of r/fo76FilthyCasuals actually :P
---
Yeah, that would be a big let down.  Hopefully fixing that is in the pipe as that's pretty much the ultimate achievement of the game so far.
---
Yeah, pissed me off how prejudiced everyone was, I think thats one of the reasons it got so much hate, everyone decided they hated it right from the announcement
---
Don't go full Trump now.
---
My guess is they were thinking that if they were separated, you might keep one equipped as you're walking around.
---
Relatively easy to keep one 1-point card equipped.  Harder to keep one 3-point card equipped.
---
Have you tried reporting it? I would think that would probably accomplish more...
---
Ok, I just wanna make sure because I'm worried about having them on me. Idk how to do all that Gyazo stuff or Tumblr stuff so I'll just plop them into a google doc and send you the share link if that's fine
---
Well, this conversation has been had a lot. Personally, I like the desolate last man standing feeling. 
---
I'm sure in time we'll see more NPCs. But i also like the idea of anyone I meet in the game, is a real person. 
---
The game is laughably easy...
---
The syringer just has a special barrel if I recall and you can just recraft it and add the barrel.
---
Just FYI, it’s only a FEW trailer doors... and I’ve not found an easy way to visually ID them. Ya just gotta run up and see if you can interact with them, and then remember them. 
---
I believe there is a no witch-hunting rule on this subreddit so no name postings.

If they brought back The Pitt I'd eat my shorts. My first fallout experience was playing The Pitt on my uncle's PS3, so it'd be amazing to revisit it on the current Gen. Wouldn't want it to be the same story though, it'd have to be something new.
---
Now THAT'S what I want from a survival mode.  I was so disappointed when "Survival" was just PvP, but if that's what Nuclear Winter is then I am totally looking forward to that.
---
They already stated that private servers and mods will likely take at least a year before they're ready. So that's a good reason not to include them on this roadmap-- they may not even show up until the start of 2020. 
---
https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-how-mods-and-private-servers-work-and-w/1100-6462371/  (there are more articles on this topic I think, but this was a quick find)
---
While I also desperately want mods, I think it made a lot more sense for them to focus this roadmap on showcasing what ~they~ plan to do for the game, rather than talk about modders-- not only because it's good for them, but because all of this stuff on the roadmap is what people expected when they were told 'free DLC'. It's good that Bethesda creates public awareness of their commitment to that promise, rather than letting the focus fall on complaints like 'Bethesda failed and are running to let the modders fix their game for them'. xD
---
Well I mean they're not gonna say, "Yeah we really fucked up on that one lmao, give us your money", they have to admit it professionally
---
In FO4 (through Creation Club) backpacks added an extra equipable item that increased carry weight slightly and gave a small bonus (hp Regen, 5% explosive damage, extra defense, etc) and a small stat buff with patches (+1 SPECIAL). They were highly customizable (change colors, patches, overall function).
---
Could be but also could be anything! In my mind I’m picturing what Final Fantasy XIV  and WoW: Cataclysm pulled where they changed the world and it the game prior was still canon.  I do like your idea more though. I know it may be wrong to speculate at such an early stage but the name of that update and a new story may suggest a return of human “Wastelander” NPCs. I like the idea of that it would help with any new main quest they’re establishing.
---
Vote this shit up 1000 times for headgear lights, or equipable clip flashlights 
---
I just blow apart the CAMP with my TSE shotgun, and when they show up to investigate I challenge them to do something about it. Most don't.
---
I know that such things exist down in the Emmett Brothers storage "mine" near Whitesprings.
---
Yeah you understand. This is what I meant.
---
Is there a tl;dr of this content?
---
I really, really like the short message. It admits fault, it reaffirms that they definitely care for the game and for us, and show that they are dedicated to make this game amazing in the long run. Very wholesome &lt;3!
---
I have the exact same thing! But it's also reduced weight haha
---
 I have 140+ levels on PC and I have been griefed once. It was not even much of a grief although I was killed. I noticed him staying in one place nearby and went and tossed some Plasma 'nades through cheap door. Wrecked his Extractor and killed his turrets. Sucker would not come out and fight, so I ran my bounty up to 100 and left.
---
 It does seem to be uncommon on PC.
---
I’m sure I butchered the title but it’s found in the radio. 
---
No, like what is it? I saw that radio channel but I wasn’t sure what it does.  
---
So the game will be actually worthy of being considered finished? Only a few months after launch. 
---
Amazing. Thanks. One more: snap reed so I can complete the recipe? :P
---
Firing it up now
---
I still think that the 'no NPC's' was a narrative decision. There is SO MUCH voice acting through holotapes that could have easily been turned into NPC's, not to mention certain NPC's like Grahm and Rose being immune to damage to prevent griefing (so we know how they'd handle NPCs that they didn't want to die). 
---
The game's story is focused on rebuilding America (even though gameplay-wise we might be limited in our ability to do so), but that runs into the problem that many other games do, why don't the NPC's take care of their own problems? If we were in a lush thriving wasteland rife with settlements and humans, that'd contradict any need to 'rebuild'. Personally, I also like the point that many others have made: that this is a story where the hero didn't arrive on time, so we just have to dig through the aftermath and try to make something new. 
---
Again, just my opinion, I don't expect that everyone will share in it. I do think that if what I wrote **was** their intent, they advertised it wrong which made it a turn-off for people. 
---
It's a bug that's tied to emotes.  On PC, hit "V" twice during play to reset it.  On console, it's whatever button toggles between the first and third-person cameras.
---
 I like Wallace far more than Arturo. YMMV. ;)
---
What a whole lot of posts to say nothing besides advertising.
---
Looks like player vending was planned from the beginning, you could see the vending machines in the E3 gameplay, looks like they just couldnt balance it in time or something for release
---
I think you are overestimating how much is in the roadmap. I think you people would be fooled by any graphic. 
---
I'm joining your game now :)
---
&gt;Distilling!
---
Unlimited Grape Mentats, here I come.
---
K, you do you 👍
---
I suppose it would, but I'm not sure I want them banned. I also just wanted to know if posting their usernames would be against policy. 
---
So fucking pumped for everything in here. Distilleries, camp decorating, legendary scrapping, vending, new quests and factions, backpacks! 
---
Like god damn. This was a total injection of fun into the game. Would LOVE to hear some details of the legendary scrapping system. Then we can start hoarding what need need to get a head start on our dream weapons/armour
---
To little to late, most people moved on from the game. I wish I would stop getting the notices.
---
Yeah, I didn't even think of that. I'm sure they could work around it, but that might be a lot more work than it's worth honestly. Especially when you know a change that big in the vendor inventory system would definitely come with bugs.
---
If you click their name under the "social" tab, you have an option to block the player for your session. This mutes them, and removes your name marker from their map, making it near impossible for them to locate you once you fast travel away.  
---
A better question would be: are solo players primarily the ones complaining on this forum? Probably.
---
Everything is 75% easier with a team. 99% of the complaints are solved with smart team work. It's a 25p game and they're the ones usually asking for NPCs.
---
I'd hate it if i solo'd.
---
If you go to extreme, fallout could go the way of Mass Effect, which I loved by the way.  I'd rather be patient and support the game because they are still working on fixes, when they could have just chalked it up as a loss and pulled the plug and the game is still really fun, despite it's problems.
---
There are halo tapes and annoying quest tag audio everywhere....pretend the NPC was in front if your face.
---
I don't mind the lack of NPCs in the first chapter, you walk out the vault and are like WTF? Having to piece together clues like a detective while fighting monsters and a hostile environment.
---
You reclaim the wasteland from the Scorched and finish the Scorch Cure research to make the area safe again to inhabit.
---
The question is will the new inhabitants agree to live together in peace or get weapons, form tribes and fight?
---
From the sound of it, the area is just more irritated and probably filled with bigger, badder creatures.
---
Though to be honest, someone described a little further down a Battle Royale version that...could be fun?
---
It’s for PVP
---
It’s kinda like a mode where 4 people have to hunt each other down. 
---
I would agree that being unable to rejoin without a teammate is frustrating, but I would hardly call that game-breaking. I’m also certain someone from Bethesda has acknowledged that rejoining servers is on the wishlist and will most likely be rectified in time. There’s just no feasible way to give everything everyone wants at once. Yeah losing workshops sucks, but they give you materials to build that you can’t even keep for not using so it’s not like you actually lose anything unless you dipped into your own resources, likely through repairing several times which is a pretty good indication that you either occupied it for a while or overextended yourself. Keep your play sessions concise and efficient and enjoy the fact that the post-apocalyptic wasteland is, in fact, sometimes unforgiving.
---
Yeay!!!! Finally get to decorate!!!  Seriously my favorite part of FO4 was creating immersive settlements.  
---
Good to know. Thank you. 
---
&gt; People are probably going to destroy people's CAMPs if they don't like the prices.
---
My raider side likes this idea.
---
300 caps for a Stimpak? *rabble rabble*
---
You fucking idiots are not getting the concept here. DUPED STEALTH BOYS. DUPED. D.U.P.E.D. I cant infinitely have berry mentats W...T...F IS SO DIFFICULT ABOUT THIS
---
It's the Bovine Six!

---
This is the first time I think a dev has really meant "Thank you for sticking with us" and it making sense.
---
Lets be real honest... People know absolutely nothing, they are going to hype the shit out of it in their mind, and then bitch and moan when it comes out. But if I'm guessing, its a torso armor Piece with Deep Pockets.
---
How do people keep defending this broken POS game?
---
Yeah dude. It seems like a good amout of time that i load into whitesprings i start hearing rockets and shit going off and i think...great. There goes half my loot. 
---
Is your rifle a sufficiently high level?
---
Also maybe you need to try armour piercing mods or something to take down the robots? Your situation sounds ridic lol
---
You can not choose and if you gain more than one level you'll get to choose for the times you haven't chosen. The game will say 'Level up(2)' if you have two choices to make, for example. I usually hold off on choosing when I am near a perk card pack, which you get every 5 levels, just because I'd like to see what's in the pack first.
---
I don't know if you can save level choices to swap points, if you stop picking at 46 and get to 51 to hopefully move 6 or so special points around. I'd guess not because the perk card choices pre-50 seem to be level locked. It'll prompt you with your level 46 choices, then level 47 choices and so on.
---
If you had to live cooped up with someone for years and listen to their snoring, farting, belching, and smell their bodily odors without relief, you'd probably want to murderize a few of them too.
---
Nah you just literally have no understanding of how economic items relied on being limited to be balanced are not balanced due to duping. This is a simple concept.
---
Bad things happen to you if you hurt the mannequins.
---
LOL. I'll admit. I'm gloating a little. Not a lot. 
---
But much of what I've said about the game, is panning out in one way or another. Like stash increase. When people complained, I said that it's coming. And it came. 
---
What I'm most happy about this roadmap, there was so much in that no one really saw coming. Which, I was hoping to would happen. Yes, they could have really dropped it, with not really having much to talk about. But there was a part of me that felt that Bethesda was playing their cards close to their chest. 
---
They are trying to do something different this time around with an online game. And that means taking risks, but long term risks. Risks that require them to really take a shit of negative attacks. 
---
Yes, I felt some things should have been in the game from the start. Like perk decks. I know they are working on that for the future. And while it wasn't in the game to start, ok. I can work around it. My life isn't ruined by spending a minute switching things out. 
---
Nothing in the game has ever made me angry. No bugs or glitches have made me stop playing. I just deal and work around or wait. 
---
Here's something I really like. The idea of three different kinds of play. Adventure, which you could call basic/regular. Then a hardcore PvP, and then a hardcore PvE. Which is what I feel Nuclear Winter will be about. 
---
The exciting part. I can have my character move from one to another easily. I won't have to start over. I think that's pretty exciting. I have no interest in PvP. But it would be fun to do a more harsh PvE setting. 
---
The next thing I would love to see. A revamp of the crafting. Every online game promises some of the best items in the game will come from crafting. But always, always people grind for the best items. 
---
Only through mods can that be true here. I don't want to grind mobs in certain areas for better chance at items. But I understand others do. So there needs to be some kind of combination of those two I think. 
---
So yeah. I'm happy with today. It's been what I've been saying about the game for a while now. 
---
totally fine! You can also upload to imgur or if you have a twitter, post on there and tag me @ladydevann whatever is easiest for you. No rush :)
---
Yeah, found that Responder bot last night in Grafton proper, not the train station.  Had a long list of available mods.
---
 No witch pursuits here. No. ;)
---
350 hrs in, seen him once...
---
Just got your chat- thank you!
---
Right, just move your CAMP object over a bit and you can have your whole CAMP back for like 20 Caps.
---
Just remember, this is the game that Bethesda wanted, not what Fallout fans wanted.  They WANTED that element of danger from other players.
---
Dang-right, excavator armor is great for being an to fast travel
---
I'm hoping it's a team deathmatch like overwatch.  Let the thumbs down commence.
---
Wait how are people being duped? I often get other players giving me stuff 
---
I hope it is more than that. I hope it is the categorizing addition a lot of people have been asking (sorry I don’t know how to beat word it). You know how people have been asking to seperate different types of food and chems and aid into different sections as well as separating weapon categories into sub menus. If I had to guess I would assume it would be something like that. So all our our consumables (food/aid/chems) aren’t in one long list. Same goes with weapons and grenades and melee weapons etc.
---
Yeah I feel like a dick for selling all those junkie weapons and weightless leathers. 
---
Hire bodyguards, well even then we'll still fight you  but at least you tried right?
---
I think they are not directly related.
---
I am looking forward to Nuclear Winter because that sounds more serious survival againts enviroment challenge than this wimpy survival we have now. After about level 25 or so, you have no problems with food, drink or radiation, and you neither need to even sleep.
---
Im in
---
So apparently I need to say this again. The point is consumables are ECONOMIC which is tarnished by duping and thus be now be revamped. Idfk why you dumb fucks do not understand this very simple concept. I'm not saying you should agree, i'm saying stop saying berry mentats because those do not compete with duped stacks of consumables.
---
Yep I got impression some follower bot.
---
Yeah, on a weekday I can play about 2 hours max, though I am a full time student and work part time. Most of my gaming happens on the weekends.
---
It reached popular, I can confirm that. Why the fuck would he lie
---
What if there's 3 players on the server? Overseer could only have two hands. I think that's just player.
---
The mine NE of white spring, or anywhere in the mire swamps 
---
Someone asking 300 for a Stimpak is also asking to have his camp destroyed. 
---
I really like the idea of a player trading area better than vending at my CAMP. 
---
Remember Diamond City in F4? There were a bunch of different vendors there for most of your trading needs. I’d love to see the Vault patio become a similar thing. Allow us to place our vending machines there. One stop shopping with no travel costs and no strangers visit our CAMPs. 
---
Top of the world second floor. It's pretty central and it's already like a shopping centre, it's going to be an unused and unvisited area after people see it once. 
---
It would be cool to see the area revamped, get rid of the enemies, maybe close it off and make it instanced (like they did Evan's house), it should be automated for simplicity. 24 assigned vending machine spots for the 24 players on the server.
---
Give up your dream on a nice camp and made a fortified trade booth.
---
Complete with 6 rocket turrets.
---
Actually that is one of my fav. memories! Monongah, about level 30, with a new buddy - and we took down our first SB by spamming basic turrets!
---
It was an epic battle worthy of dragon slaying!
---
I mean, there just needs to be a hub in general. If you put a bunch of social elements, work benches and other tools into an easily accessable address, it opens up a lot more opportunity for dynamic player interactions like RP, trading, and pickup groups.
---
Make it some place that is lower level, easy to get too, and not an area with high traffic due to combat like Whitesprings. Putting it in a place like Flatwoods would be perfect. Then people of all levels and play styles can just mingle and get shit done.
---
They probably don't want to release with metro RE anthem 
---
&gt; My idea why there is no npc's in fallout 76
---
The NPCs were rude to the developers and locked in the Dev Room as punishment :)
---
I think a "wandering bazaar" might be better for those selling stuff but want to be on the go.  It's a concept I've seen way back in Final Fantasy 11 where you set up items for sale on your character, and people buy them.   
---
As for the vaults being raids, I'm not surprised but a bit sad.  They do need more high end content, but gating vaults behind raids means for those who are interested in lore finding you won't get time to look around as most gamers are of get-in-get-out mentality.  If it's more of a public raid then I'm totally down for that, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I'd join, but I need to start stacking CHR perk for party bonuse cards I guess.
---
I'm exactly the opposite.  It's part on the Fallout experience.
---
Best of both worlds: all player vending machines go into the same pool. So when you go into a vending machine to buy you see the stock from every other player on that server, and when you put something up in your vending machine it's put into that pool for all the other players.
---
NPCs summer of 2019 wastelander dlc ???!!
---
Same
---
Same same, but different, but still same. 
---
Too bad they aren’t weapons that I would pay s lot of caps for
---
Couldn’t agree more. Arturo did NOT have a soothing voice. 
---
Must of been dupers lol
---
It has gotten much better since launch other than the huge season nerf recently but even that wasn't super bad. Having never played, you won't know the difference. Once you get to max level and you can start really shaping your build it really gets good. 
---
haha atfirst when I picked them up I thoruhg it was armor stuff
---
I think a "wandering bazaar" might be better for those selling stuff but want to be on the go.  It's a concept I've seen way back in Final Fantasy 11 where you set up items for sale on your character, and people buy them.
---
Thank you so very much for this! 
---
This is a lovely roadmap.  The only problem currently, for me, is that this is effectively telling me that I won’t be playing until after Nuclear Winter drops (assuming it’s a mode I care about).  It’s a great plan for content, but most of it isn’t really relevant to someone high level.  
---
They may have had concerns about duping, which would be a very good reason not to release player vending machines. Widespreading duping would ruin the whole idea. :/
---
Literally will hoard all the  jangles the moon monkeys to fill my camp with them. My passion for this game has tripled since seeing this roadmap and all the cool plans they have coming up. 
---
Heard its canvas.
---
I’d hate moving.   Like at all. 
---
This will be lost, but I want to say that I have trashed this game since launch. Now, I do think the criticisms have been rightly deserved, and I am not taking any of those back. Gamers can be passionate, sometimes a bit too passionate to the point of being irrationally angry, and I'll admit that was me when this game launched.
---
I am very impressed at how dedicated the Fallout fanbase has been to this game, and I am also impressed at how well they've called out Bethesda on their mistakes with this game. They've done it respectfully, which I can say I haven't done. 
---
I still have no plans to play FO76, as I didn't really play Bethesda games growing up, but I am very happy that the FO fanbase is finally getting the content and fixes they deserve for this game. So good job Bethesda on taking the steps to correct the concerns of this community.
---
However, do not get complacent. It will still take time for people to trust Bethesda again. I hope to see community engagement like this in future Bethesda games. I also hope the next Bethesda game will be complete at launch and be a good experience for everyone.
---
I've kinda dropped 76, should I get back in?
---
It sounds like you'e just trying to make excuses really. Workshops, silos, nuke zones, SBQ fights, etc. It doesn't change the fact people have quit, and they won't be back. Unforgiving is an interesting choice of word. Like people who will no longer buy another EA game. Or people who will no longer buy another Bethesda game. They probably think "We have these massive IPs like Elder Scrolls so whatever we do, they will still all buy it, multiple times on different platforms."  But a significant number of people these days are not forgiving these big companies. They're standing by their principles. They're taking direct action, protesting, making videos, posts, etc. spreading negative word of mouth, spreading "hate", because that's their only recourse, using every screw up as ammunition. It's in their best interests to stop screwing up. Will they ever learn? Maybe when the concurrent player numbers are in the gutter? Maybe when sales are down 80% at release? Did it ever have to come to that?
---
That'll be fantastic.  I'd pay real world cashish for that
---
Do you think Berry Mentats are rare?
---
Yeah, there are plenty of ways in lore to explain it being build. Hell, make building the flea market an event. Make repeatable daily quests where you deliver resources to a location and the robots build it. The more people donate across all servers, the faster it unlocks in game. Maybe even release functionality in waves to help roll it out smoothly. All of this could be used as in game content and is definitely a huge boost to QOL.
---
So apparently yall don't understand the nature of consumables and how duping effects that since you keep spamming "use berry mentats" so i give. Enjoy your pvp server. It will be run by duped stealth boys.
---
I’m lucky if i get 4 hours per week! Wow
---
and make it a neutral area. no pvp while shopping.
---
Sorry about your disability
---
While i spawn at front side of the club, ur fucking base pulls all the ghouls outside backwards and kills them while I'm still loading textures and objects. This is why we fuckin hate your shitty ws bases 
---
Omg I hadn't thought of that, my mothman shrine is getting some new decorations 
---
Did LadyDevann not get the Butcher Pete reference? Sigh. 
---
*New Features: Legendary Vendor and Scrapping – Locate  the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary  items for new legendary gear. For every star rating on a legendary item  you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of  your dreams.*
---
Please confirm : do you implement a system to control loot ? 
---
If I scrap 100 wooden mutant armor, I get a unyielding sentinel ap refresh marine left arm ?
---
I have not dropped something worthy for 200 levels, please give me hope...
---
just keep ignoring the raiders and they go away.  99% of them are just looking for some PvP, and when you do not oblige them, they go away.  in my 400 hrs of play time (PC), i have been raider'ed maybe 10 times.  all but 2 of them walked away when i ignored them.  the other 2.....wellllllll, i just blocked them AND server hopped.
---
Wow! I've put the game down, but if the bugs aren't out of control when this stuff goes live, I will start playing religiously again this looks like a lot of good stuff!
---
&gt;New Quests: Ever Upwards – Journey to the deepest reaches of the woods with new stories for the legendary Pioneer Scouts. Earn merit badges, climb the ranks, and earn a customizable backpack for increased utility.

Do the merit badges do anything, I wonder? Or is it just for the sake of doing it?
---
&gt;Locate the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary items for new legendary gear. 
---
This is awesome! Selling a piece of crap with a star on it for 1 cap to the vendor felt so dang wrong. 
---
&gt;Build vending machines and flag items for sale.
---
Yessss! I can finally sell all the magazines and bobbleheads I always pick up but never use, lol
---
&gt;An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
I'm excited about this as well, although concerned about balancing issues. Considering how "balancing" has been done in the past, this makes me temper my optimism, but I really am curious to see how this works.
---
Bethesda, we really need a chat system on PC for this ge, expecially since you can't contact people from the game Launcher like you can with other games. 
---
I would actually really dislike that. I don’t want to buy things from my own camp after setting it up, I would rather travel to others and see what they have, if someone charges 50 caps for a stimpak, and someone else charges 12, how would that work?
---
yay
---
Called it. &lt;3 76 because it's ambitious; Anthem seemed like a Destiny clone to the point i thought it was the same code.
---
Let's remember Monster Hunter on PC was almost completely broken for a month. Warframe has constant glitches. Destiny 2 felt like a downgrade.
---
Do ESO and Conan really have the same features glitch free? Rust? Not personally experienced with them but i try to not have unrealistic expectations.
---
Griefers aren’t just jerks they are either retards or just doormats in real life. 
---
The Mysterious Trader came to kill stuff and disappear? Better let Nick Valentine know.
---
Exactly!
---
Even before E3, when the teaser hit, we all heard rumors from that Kotaku guy that it wasn't going to be a traditional 1 player experience.  That's where it started.
---
A sizable portion of the audience was against this game from Day -10.  Then Bethesda made some mistakes that everyone absolutely jumped onto immediately.  Then the YouTubers found that 76 hate = loads of clicks.
---
If this game turns around I want to see some YouTubers eat crow.
---
If someone takes my Mr fuzzy doll there will be blood 
---
I would *love* for it to actually be a winter season with snow everywhere. The Seasons mod took my enjoyment of Fallout 4's scenery to the next level.
---
I'd be entirely cool with it also being a distinct epoch in the post-apocalyptic timeline, some sort of aftershock of the Great War causing massive environmental disturbance like more frequent and intense radstorms, and some new sort of storms.
---
Any info on the military paint from fallout 4?
---
Obviously they arent rare but neither are stealthboys. Doesnt mean you dont have to farm them to engage in lengthy pvp though. Why should one farm to fight a not farmed stack of consumables.
---
There’s just one NPC. But he’s been duped a thousand times. They all have one quest 
---
Well if you want to lose a lot of personal resources... yes. But the gears and oil are soon coming out of your own pocket when you spam turrets.
---
I bought 2 PA editions, and a Tricentennial for my wife.  Never once cried about my purchase.
---
If that Wastelanders update doesnt make the game an actual Fallout game (NPCs) So help me god Bethesda I will flame you 
---
I’m hoping for the categorization feature too, but since it’s a change to the UI, it won’t be dependent on gear. Since is a “customizable” backpack with “added utility” means you’ll be able to slot mods at a crafting bench. 
---
Yeah I waited almost 30 minutes for this latest one to leave, but I'm low level so... I will try blocking if it happens again. I'm new so I didn't know you could do that. 
---
Just do what I did, purge 90% of it. It sucks at the time but later you will love the freedom being able to pick up what ever you want. Plus you will realize how quickly you will gain all the stuff back.  If it's a bunch of weapons you will see you didn't need them anyway
---
Yeah. They pointed that out to me already.
---
I really don’t want this. It removes a drive to interact with each other. Which is one of the principle design ideas. 
---
Well, come to think of it, on my "first run" I actually did hack every terminal to read all the juicy lore bits.. so yeah, I guess it is important to have 3 perks ready at all times.. and enjoy the process of swapping them each time with whatever other perks you are using. :)) However later in the game it's easier, since you almost never will need them..
---
I also recommend getting a dedicated friend who will always hack terminals - best perk in the game. Shout out to my buddy u/SeriWolk ;)
---
I'm glad some of you are happy, but it's too late for me. I just wish it would have came out as a complete game. *downvotes in bound*
---
 The Mire! 
---
Not really, there is just a spot in a mine where early FEV experiment carcass pieces were stored. 
---
*PLEASE* let this happen!
---
Ghouls, workshops.
---
Wonder if they slow you down, imoact sneak, or cause faster thirst/hunger?
---
oh thanks so I guess it is a legit item haha
---
BUT IT WAS MY FIRST TIME AND IT WAS FUN!
---
That extra 200 lbs increase is going to be instantly filled with all the legendaries I can find now. I want to have tons to trade them in with the new legendary vendor. 
---
Super excited to see what that's all about when it comes out
---
I just worry for your feelings people around here are very sensitive when it comes to implementing things the way they expect and I’m working to prevent aneurysms. ;)
---
 I've lived there for a long time and never caught aids. You might have lived in a more interesting part than me though. ;)
---
First post - love people who grief. They always tun when I take 80% there health with 1 shot! 😀😀
---
If you are running in pacifist mode you should be alright as far as other players. The only time it might be an issue is workshops. I’m level 91 or 92 and had my first one contested after numerous with hardly a peep. It went down more like a mugging than any kind of PvP. The real bummer is using up caps and and all the work getting everything up and running only to have someone take it away. I don’t want to discourage claiming a workshop but it something to be wary of and know can happen. Most the time I think people will leave you alone though. It’s a great way to get plans when you defend from game generated enemies. 
---
No most p2w games have small short lasting buffs exactly like this. You can cuss at me all you want, doesn't change the fact that Bethesda claimed the atom was purely for cosmetics and wouldn't effect in game stats.
---
I get it you're salty you got lied to by Bethesda so now you got to do everything in your power to defend them otherwise you'd have to admit you got tricked by them.
---
Boy oh boy you radiated folks ready to go genitalia out unmentionables in hand crazy in some vault!?
---
Cosmetic options across all weapons would be awesome. I have thousands of atoms yet nothing to buy to decorate my beloved shotguns and Gatling. Nada, zero.  For an online game people scream IDENTITY yet so far it’s next to none. Everyone came off the same assembly line it’s just pathetic. Please Bethesda go play COD WWII and behold how much everyone can customize their looks. 
---
"Anyone who uses the term npc is an incredible confirmed" wow youre a fucking moron and I dont even play this game. 
---
You'd probably have WAY more fun with Odyssey to be honest. 
---
I only do it anymore to do the atom challenges. 
---
The game is already in a good place and getting better. Try it out and I really think you will be surprised.
---
Thats not griefing!!! If you dont like being shot at you should change servers. Its literally apart of the game... Griefing is different
---
They all died of dysentery
---
I want more details on Survival and Nuclear Winter.  I want a harder game and I want to start a new character. 
---
I know the pvp details of Survival but are they making anything else more difficult, like Survival mode in 4?
---
And Nuclear Winter has got me expectant... I need information! 
---

---
Yeah, it fuckin’ did
---
I'm. Excited for backpacks. How sick.
---
OH and legendary characters?  Yess
---
There's a simple solution to this. Make it FREE to travel to the whitespring. People camp there to get there faster 
---
funny, for me the thing holding me back is the almost complete lack of grouping up with other players.  was not too bad early after release, but as people got upset with fo76, all my discord servers are empty.
---
the toxic environment, both here and in game, have led a lot of players, not i, to ignore or run from, other players.  like there was a glitch that allowed a player to view and take from, another player's inventory.  that is just 1 example of why players are afraid to interact with other players.
---
in an attempt to counter this, am running around with 10 - 20 plans / recipes and dropping them off to the lower level players.  just trying to spread some positivity in an all negative atmosphere.
---
there are some "good guys" out here.  my friends list has only 6 people on it ATM, but i KNOW they are kind, friendly folk.  not like those HILLBILLY RAIDERS OF WV!!!!  ;-P
---
Honestly I'm gonna reinstall 76 tonight and make a new character. This roadmap looks promising.
---
&gt; I'm not sure I want them banned.
---
Not to worry, they wouldn't be - shooting you (even if you don't like it and cry a lot) isn't against the ToS/EULA.
---
But I will be pissed if there isn't an in game use for them at some point.
---
Same with the time machine monorail. You don't dangle shit like that and leave me unfulfilled.
---
Someone was making meat soup....
---
I don't see what me being a moron has to do with you not playing the game tho. Also "gamergaters" was the group that coined that phrase, and yeah I thought almost all of them were incels
---
Entry level laser pistol is definitely more effective that .38 pipe pistol against low level ghoisls/scorched. Even dies a good job against level 5 super mutants.
---
You got your work cut out for you.  I'm pretty sure there's at least 5 per update  ;)
---
Or super aids
---
You can make one too with some concrete foundation 
---
Boys and girls of all ages are welcome aboard this here hype train.
---
Time to hoard, a time to join, a time for a looting we have today onwards.... 
---
Let’s all get rolling... Xbox user WarzoneBETA checking into the Whitesprings... please standby.
---
They arent griefing or breaking any rules. You could be banned for filing a false report. :)
---
Why would you port anything over to ps4 are u some sort of S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
haha I spilled my soup
---
ikr I thought I struck gold
---
Coming from someone who is active in the Smite community, this is rich.  Hi-Rez is one of the worst developers out there.
---
Don't throw stones in that glass house of yours dude.
---
Most armor has higher ballistic DR than energy DR
---
If you like shitty boring games with a creepy overly fanatic tiny fan base then you'd probably enjoy this game. Don't spend more than $20. Anything $20 and below is totally worth a couple of weekends and then removing it from your hard drive. 
---
&gt;needs more content, so let's cheat to trivialize the content there is, so we can burn through it even faster
---
Hmmm
---
Hairstyles suck in general i just want an version of rebel with more hair next to the ears and a measure style near the back of the head/neck area
---
Its over heating. Move it where it has better air circulation before you kill it completely.  
---
Blocks the trolls?
---
Ahh the old "im rubber you're glue" rebuttal, good for you random 11 year old.
---
Bethesda please will you ever let me display all the Teddy Bears I've collected?! :P 
---
Youre missing some elements. Vaults were only designed to hold roughly 1000 residents. There are 4 if you include your vault, 5 if you include vault tec university's ''test vault'' where all inhabitants died. So you are looking at 4000 people of that 1.81 million having a secured bunker. You can add in survivalist types who built their own bunkers.... but are MIA as well as the inhabitants of Whitesprings.... as well as potential public fallout shelters.... providing that society took to and held all of the cold war ways..... 
---
in the end of the day.... thats a few thousand.... maybe ten thousand or so that found safety from the radiation after the great war. Leaving millions of people outside to either succumb to radiation sickness, or have improvised enough to where starvation, dehydration, or your neighbor may be your biggest threat.... next to radiation.
---
Now radiation in fallout does not work like it does in real life. The United States was attacked by large amounts of small lower yield bombs (still bigger than fat man and little boy, but still on small side.... the goal was to push radiation in the air, not damage hard targets.... killing more in the long run.... which was the real game plan in the cold war) this radiation has a shorter half life than real life, but still was able to mutate generations quickly.... whereas in our world it would just cause cancer, it formed evolution. Furthermore, in real life precipitation would have made the outside world's radiation more hospitable..... places like the ash heap and the swamp and the bog...  or even the glowing sea of fo4 would not exist in our world. 
---
He tried but Bethesda broke thst function too.
---
I don’t think anyone can manage expectations. They need to just not even announce a game until the day of release or very shortly beforehand. You think Apex Legends would have gone over as well if it had time for people to speculate and rumor mill around about it. Especially with EA having it’s name attached. Better probably to just put it out there and hope word of mouth works out for the best. They’ll just have say good bye to preorder sales. Which maybe that’s for the best of the industry anyhow. 
---
You wear power armor?
---
I'll be honest, I thought it wasn't going to get any updates like we see in the road map. Still not 100% convinced but am very much satisfied that we will be getting something.
---
Im excited for the new few month
---
I'm just excited for bug fixes
---
Looks like it’s on the roadmap! :)
---
I mean not trying to be a negative Nancy here. But so far what Bethesda says and does are often not correlated. Let's hold the praise for when these features arrive and not for a marketing image and a 2 paragraph letter
---
That's the industry's problem, they dont do that and cause studios to rush out unfinished products. Now that it doesnt matter what they put out to start, they will just keep grinding studios into dust.
---
Hope it's instanced to character and not account
---
I agree with everything u say and I know it's just a game. 
---
Great, he muttered to himself, after accidentally scrapping all his robot models from RobCo research facility.
---
I'm not sure what the dupe bug was in FO4. It was a single player game and if you wanted to start Day 1 in power armor with a legendary gatling laser rifle, you could. Just load up the right mods. 
---
I roll with a shotgun and a silenced 10mm for tagging low level mobs, and I save all my 5.56 for my rifle toting buddy, and everything else gets dropped. Last night I deposited 45lbs of ammo in the overseer's cache in Flatwoods because I couldn't find any low level players in the area to gift it to.
---
The guys with the camps/turrets that annoy me af; yeah, they can't set up camp and I can just enjoy my time there without bullets going through the windows.  Otherwise, I end up wanted as I destroy all those damn turrets.
---
I posted my thoughts on the game after I had played the beta for a hour on FB. My friends tore into it almost immediately. No questions about the game or any inquisitiveness towards it at all. Just instantly written off. 
---
Harder? Let me guess you have a bloodied build and it's normal to die 10X to a queen and often to everything else and you probably curse at your TV every time.
---
I'd personally like for NO LEGENDARIES in Survival but it will probably just be the same but with PVP and friendly fire.
---
We'll probably have to wait for Raids for that content. Can you imagine a Raid with Survival, even a Queen? No one has organized discipline of any kind it will be a major achievement to actually complete those.
---
I hope that in a raid if you die you're booted out completely. How will anything matter if you have a full sentinel set? Just worry about the occasional knock back?
---
The best would be a raid, friendly fire, no legendaries, and also you are directly competing with another team or at least 1 player to your 4 Dark Souls invader style.
---
Some in power armor, some out of power armor.
---
Jumping in here from hearing the news from other places. I'm not really a fallout guy, but I do love reading a good roadmap! Some of this stuff sounds really cool like the Nuclear Winter and the Vault Raids! Really curious to see what's in store for the Fall with a new Main quest.
---
Take it from me as a Destiny guy who stuck with D1 and D2. Never give up hope even when everything seems like trash. While this sadly might not remove the stigma around this game, the content for those of you who have stuck by it, or might return sounds awesome and I hope you all enjoy it! &lt;3
---
Ps4 
---
Sorry. Just realized that i left it rather incomplete. There are too few bodies for the game to not have friendly npcs. Some would become supermutants from the chemical spill infecting the water table, and theres some that succumbed to radiation poisoning becoming ghouls, but we dont see enough quantity.... though it seems it may be fixed with bethesda's roadmap....
---
Now if only everything in the game wasnt a bullet sponge
---
I hope they do take note and have games more ready upon launch. I’m 30 and lived through a golden age of great games with no upcharges, micro transactions, or dlc. As much as I wish those days were coming back, they just aren’t. But there’s still a great number of manufactured outrage from you tubers and streamers who DO stand to make a profit from over-blowing every little bug or design choice as “game-breaking”. It’s overused and over exaggerated. I’ve played since the BETA most every day, usually for an hour or two at a time, I’ve never quit and never really experienced anything I would call “unplayable”. I stand by everything I said and will continue to defend what I said and continue to play and enjoy everything that does work about the game and revel in the fact that 90% of the things I did complain about are now less annoying or fixed entirely
---
Do you have targeting hud on your power armor?
---
I know of one in-game, which is ok but I'd like a clean one if it exists, and one in the Atom Shop, which is ok but the silly face is on my character's nose instead of over her mouth.
---
Dude I'm so stoked, it's downloading right now as we speak. 
---
Not on the toon I was using at the time.
---
Hey.  The Supreme Court says that companies are people, too.  
---
And there is a large number of people who feel like Bethesda lied to them.  About everything from rum to canvas to stable servers to bug patches that aren't more bug than patch.
---
And at this point I don't think it's a lack of maturity to assume that a system put in place by Bethesda would malfunction.
---
Are you getting excited about things that have already been promised and were not implemented until 100 days after release?  
---
Road maps are standard...they release it almost 4 months after the beta and people get excited....at least now I know when to reinstall the game
---
It sounds like we’re going to see human NPC’s later in the year with the Wastelanders update. They don’t spell it out, but I don’t see how we get new factions without them. 
---
I have no issue with no NPC’s at first. They wanted to create a desolate, empty world. That was the entire point, and they accomplished it. Now it’s time for the world to evolve, so hopefully that means we see some compelling characters in the not too distant future. 
---
I could have been more clear on my explanation but I'm glad some one else took the time to helped add to this post! :) so thank you for that. 
---
The bullet sponges remind me of the division pre 1.4 patch lol
---
Contrary to common perception,BGS knows exactly what they are doing.It wouldn't surprise me in the least that the purpose of this announcement was to create a surge in sales.Just for the reasons outlined in the OP.Do you really think they WANT to "disincentivize" second accounts? These secondary dead mule accounts bolster the numbers of active accounts while at the same time,causing little stress on the servers.Win-Win.No I think they will continue to do things and make changes to make mule accounts a thing...limited stash space,special crafting only mules,legendary storage,etc,etc.
---
Bye felecia
---
I'd love for Raider Radio to have raider based PVP events based on tuning in on it to hear what Rose wants you to go mess up at the moment.
---
And those sweet little action figures :D
---
Civ Call to Power 2
---
No PVP in the shopping area for sure. But Top of the World is a bit of a tricky spot for low level players. Part of why I like the player vending idea is to be able to help low level players. 
---
Maybe TWO vending areas, one for selling cheap water and Stimpaks to low levels and another for selling high level weapons and armor at a different location? 
---
What kind of updates would it have gotten then? These all seem like mostly basic additions. Just not sure what you were talking about in terms of envisioned content
---
You'd see them both just like any other online marketplace?
---
I like the idea of finding people's camps and buying from them, but from a practical perspective, it makes more sense to have vending machines "access" a marketplace type interface. Selling only while you're online is rather limited (we only have what? 2 dozen people per server max? And they have to happen across your camp?)
---
Lol if only 
---
I've coined the phenomenon a "Ghost World"
---
Which fallout?
---
Works now, thanks so much!!
---
Fuck yes! I already know of several places where model robot figures spawn. I always placed those around my settlements in FO4.
---
Hopefully these dlcs will be better than the last patches they have released. I'm hopeful for it, but I'm not going to make the mistake of getting excited for this until it is actually released and shown to not be a broken mess, because Bethesda has already burnt me on the "beta" release of this game.
---
Hopefully it will be good, just look at how they have handled everything else.
---
I love Fallout too much to ever give up on it. Any title in the Series!!!
---
There's all sorts of implementaton of BR. Not all of them are quite like the FPS shooter BR. Some are amazing.
---
Do you have team viewer installed, often causes this kind of problem
---
If this is what it takes to flush out the duped stuff, including weapons, armor, mods, ammo, rare materials, XP.......great. wonder if you have to give up all of your caps and atom shop purchases?
---
Note- most folks only focus on first level benefits to duping....that one weapon or piece of armor, ignoring the derivatives.....that weapon/armor with duped ammo resulted in accelerated XP, flux and rare materials required for the best mods, etc, etc. Plus selling the surplus for real $. ....
---
This will be the re-entry price for suspended players.
---
What is this downvote nonsense, i'm lvl 218 I like this game a lot but I ain't modding his stuff for free yikes
---
fair enough, it was also a sp game but in any event, anyone who sees the current legendary weapon system as a good system is a glutton for punishment.  
---
I'm ok with the game having a grind.  But the odds of finding any specific, desirable legendary item in fo76 is extremely remote.
---
Can i make sentences.
---
So cheating is ok because it gives people a reason to play. I'd rather play on an empty server than play with lazy ass cheaters. GTFO
---
im pretty sure meat piles are there to *reduce* server stress.
---
or stress on the local machine, anyway, less to render.
---
I did Whitespring Nuked on an empty server with multiple reloads for over an hour and almost everything was 1 star.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if there was a legendary cooldown.
---
Having shops with very rare items would be worth the journey for many players. Similar to now, people would join other people’s games only for the purpose of trading.
---
I can sell you any for 300 caps each, but I won’t be on until late tonight 
---
And no children. That always creeps me out a bit.
---
I would hope not human npcs
---
They need to fix the stimpacks 
---
Na near the farms at the very top of the forest , like up near deathclaw island 
---
Just read it and could not help thinking someone at Bethesda read our complaints. ;-) I'm excited for the masks, too, although they got the wrong date: in Germany, Fastnacht this year falls on March 5th. But maybe the North American variant is celebrated two weeks later?
---
&lt;-------------- minuteman
---
It's downloading will follow up
---
Hopefully the game will run better on low end laptops like mine.
---
its nice to cure the endless rad worms you contract, now that it no longer buffs your mutations :(
---
Chances are it will be your pope lick monster , check out the creature underneath the ‘Wild Appalachia’ text on the in-depth roadmap.
---
You'd have to know the rare items are in there in the first place. You'd also have to know the specific person so you can friend them and then join their server. Then you'd have to know where their camp is.
---
Two players looting an empty vault. Notice the bag. Could be a player and "wastelander", as the other don't have vault suit.
---
Could make Vault 76 interior as the other location.
---
Top of the World 2nd floor and Vault 76 interior. Both instanced, non-PvP zones.
---
It's a dupe flush and re-entry price for suspended players.
---
Make it so. 
---
Good stuff. Only I think there should be an area around vault 76 where where everyone on the server has a vendor machine all side by side in one spot. Make them all permanently placed and when a person leaves the server it clears that vendor machine and auto assigns it to a new player as soon as they enter the server. It's gonna be way to hard to find everyone's camp to find their vendor. And make this building a no fire zone to keep people from griefing. Just a suggestion
---
ps: you can find player selling serums for ~250-500 caps each
---
So, I'm going to generalize here a bit.  Everyone I know is really into multiplayer competitive FPS games... does not play Fallout.  Everyone I know that loves Fallout, does not love competitive FPS, in fact, most of them HATE it.
---
Add on top of that that the twitch gaming in Fallout sucks ass compared to the other games out there featuring BR.
---
There has been a huge desire for multiplayer Fallout since Fallout 3 and the reason was never pvp.
---
That said, whatever because they're adding PvE content so yaaaaaay!
---
Alright and thx I appreciate it
---
Valley Galleria is probably the darkest interior location aside from mines.
---
My interpetion is that smarty is just a normal human long dead. Most super mutants are stupid and they know they are superior to humans, but ordinarty humans are smart compared to them.
---
Hahaha so true though my man 😂
---
Doubted? The game has stunk it up since launch. Dont kid yourself. It will be a long road to recovery for this game. What clickbait youtubers say wont change that for better or worse. 
---
Yeah exactly just the 3* legendaries!
---
Everything on the golfclub but please let me stay at the river bridge behind the golfclub.
---
I’m unsure of which type of platform you’re on, but on Xbox, this is the same exact system we have right now, with all of these steps. To join people, you don’t have to friend them, just invite them to a team and sell. It’s really not too time consuming or difficult.
---
You cant stop me from selling my Stalker's rolling pin. 10,000 caps in case anyone is interested. 
---
Did anyone else notice on the summer update it has an icon with 5 stars on it? 5 star legendaries? Hmmm
---
No human NPCs has always been a design choice, not a lack of resources. I would not bet on NPCs showing up.
---
The ole ultraviolence and in n out.
---
Gt Mrbiigstuff 
---
Its a shame they didn't announce this a long time ago.  Might have kept the playerbase more active and prevented a ton of people from leaving.  
---
Better late than never but I have to wonder how many people moved on and never looked back.
---
Hahahahahaha anyone? Anyone for a 10,000 cap kitchen item? 
---
Around what time you'll be on
---
Loot everything off them and they disappear, just drop the crap you don't want.
---
Thanks, I just had to log out again because of it.  I guess that's what I get for waving at everyone I see.
---
I love that putting money in your tub is your first thought! Ahaha XD 
---
I'm going to make a Moonshine restaurant camp and liter it with beer bottles!
---
Targeting HUD is what used to cause all my crashes til I quit using it. Of course if you play with someone else who is using a targeting hud that could cause you crashes too, especially the more players and enemies there are in the area
---
...you still have to know that person exists in the first place, dude
---
You sure it will change the base item :) ?
---
But its a *Stalker's* rolling pin. 
---
100% vats accuracy when not in combat, at +50% vats cost
---
*100* ***PERCENT***
---
Do we have to pay for the dlcs? Feel like eith all the crap that people who preordered it/got it when it first came out should get this for free
---
20 years ago gaming was in a different place,digital downloads weren't a thing so games had to be released on a physical disc.This meant the game better be pretty much polished and complete.Nowadays companies are getting lazy,they've adopted this,download it now,fix it later approach.Its not just BGS,it's most game developers as a whole.And I'm afraid it will continue until we collectively start voicing our concerns with our wallets.
---
Hard to gauge the value of legendary weapons tho, I have a two shot explosive Tesla rifle for example. But it’s on my melee character so it just sits in his stash. 
---
To see if a player exists you just look on the map or in forums. I don’t understand what makes this process so complicated.
---
Fuck that's obsurd making an item of ammo into a currency will promote that item of currency to be abused and exploited not good for the economy
---
PSNid Enterres we need community.
---
Would anyone be up for a BoS clan like the other platforms have?
---
Thank you for considering it.
---
Not with the Aquaboy perk. :)
---
Honestly I love the game I have just run out of things to do. I am sorry 3 excited for new content. That's really my only big complaint
---
Why don't you try it before saying it's a lie buddy?
---
It helped me every time and I hope it helps many others until bethesda fixes it straight.
---
About your "concern" about the bag, you can just drop the item and pick it up the next second, DUH!
---
This is why I don't lock fabricators / extractors on resources I don't badly NEED. IT's like a community service to me. It's being made, people who need it should just come get it.   
---
Yeah it's a PvP zone, and we can trade off or contest it for XP etc, but I don't see the need to fuck with people over it if they are not fucking with me. :D
---
I'd be down for any good faction, so long as they aren't like the BoS from Fallout 4, those guys are just racist
---
HACK THE PLANET!
---
Awesome, glad I helped.
---
Takes the fun out of exploration don't you think? 
---
Funny enough i sort of feel the same way; i'd just as happily be a raider but we're going to need each other for when survival comes.
---
Nah you're a liar man, this isn't a guess this is experience and no, this is trash advice and aint shit you can do that gets those meat piles to load.
---
Institute/minuteman ftw!
---
Oh no way I'd join raiders other than for loot in any game, I almost always play good characters
---
So EazyMac were you one of the kids? Or one of the 100+ backup grunts they convinced to help them out?   
---
"This  dude is grief-cheating on us! help!"
---
lolz
---
He's easy to find. Just start at any point on the map, and follow every road and trail there is. Make sure you're going to right direction, and hope he's not actually following behind you.
---
See? Easy.
---
(Not really, sorry)
---
Or trade it for screws.
---
Hey I can let the occasional wild shot slide, esp among low level folks. But sustained shooting at me is gonna get you a few buffed hammer strikes back, just sayin.
---
Then she got a level 1, stub barrel, thimble.
---
Excuse me. Eso says hi &gt;:c
---
I hope they do take note and have games more ready upon launch. I’m 30 and lived through a golden age of great games with no upcharges, micro transactions, or dlc.

---
Downvoted because no, it doesn’t sound like I’m making excuses when I say something completely reasonable such as “you can’t just post your problem on reddit and expect it to be fixed next week” which is exactly the problematic mentality of this and many other subs. You sound like you are making excuses because you can’t control every single workshop in the game knowing that each additional one is going to place additional stress on the server. That’s just how computers work. 
---
What’s happened here is exactly what I’m afraid will happen with any MMO or “game as a service” or whatever you want to call them from here on out: the game launches, diehards put 500 hours in the first two months and run out of things to do, trash the game online when no one should ever be expected to release a game for you to sit and play 24/7 without ever beating, then try to convince others who don’t have that much to complain about that they should have more to complain about. We have what amounts to a $50 season pass for any other game being handed to us for free, along with a sincere apology and commitment to make it right. As stated before, that’s good enough for me. 6 patches in 3 months is plenty reasonable response and, weather you acknowledge it or not, the state of the game is vastly better than it was and will be vastly better in the future than it is now 
---
I imagine it would be nice to do some Whitespring nukes all to yourself.
---
Next time it happens to me, I'll make a video, then you can try saying it's shooped too.
---
Sorry if it doesn't help you, I'll keep looting my corpses and helping others do so too.
---
Explore the map as much as possible. It's the best thing this game has IMO.
---
I've played I think about 500-600 hours, Ive reached level 160 because in early days EXP just kept coming and coming, and I've done fairly little of the main quests. Barely joined BOS but haven't done their quest further. Trying to join Enclaive but I get distracted all the time.
---
If that camera isn't a Codac or doesn't have any lore behind it, I'm seriously going to cry...
---
Welcome to reddit
---
No. Free DLC was a thing since launch. 
---
The river right there, in between Flatwoods and the vault Tec agriculture center, has blood leaf and snap tails growing all along it.
---
Yeah, it does get better with experience and sometimes I'm sure I price stuff too low but I justify it by telling myself that I wasn't making even zero caps from it sitting in my stash and someone might actually use it. If I price too high they just don't buy lol
---
Bro. I can see many people online. What about your username tells me that you are selling something I want? What about your username tells me where your camp is?
---
It's not about complication. It's about practicality.
---
Say you're selling something I want. You're in your camp, you put it in your little vending machine, and you go about wandering the wastes.
---
Now I log in. Luckily, I log in the same time as you are online. Also, miraculously, not only do I log in when you're online, but I also happen to land on your very server. Cool. Already we needed a bit of dice rolling just to get this far.
---
Now I'm also wandering the wastes. I have no idea where your camp is. I also have no idea you have this item I want. I have no idea which one of the other 20 people you are (and why should I care? I don't know you.) I'm just out there living my best life tryin' to survive another day without a scorchbeast fucking up my good time.
---
I have to happen to run across your camp in order to even check your vending machine to even see that you have what I want. I don't know about you, but I don't tend to cover the entire map on my journeys. Oh and I'd need to do that before you log off, too.
---
That is a lot of lucky coincidences it takes to sell a particular item to someone who wants it. 
---
VS.
---
Vending machines access an online marketplace-like system. You put in what you want to sell, and can log off if you want. Everyone can check the marketplace from a known location (their own vending machine) and can search for what they want (including the thing youre selling).
---
If Bethesda is doing it the first way, hey, it's something. It's cool. It's just a nifty side feature. It's just not *practical* for the purposes of meaningful trade.
---
I love crafting and building my camp. It would be awesome if you could add some interactive features to the camps, such as a tv where you can play the pip boy games. Or maybe make the blast radius board game playable. Would just be so fun to deck out my camp and actually have a reason to have friends over and hang out there for a while. 
---
Right now it's kind of just like, hey look at this cool thing I built. Would be so awesome to actually entertain company!
---
Thanks for the road map btw!
---
I recommend playing around with foundation layouts to build in a less square looking home. 
---
Also, I have found that building a smaller upstairs compared to the downstairs reduces the boxiness.
---
Lastly, I don't ever use my budget on turrets. They are pretty weak. I would rather place more decorations.
---
Looks good though. Nice water view! The important thing is that your happy with it!
---
First of all: You felt like you had to look me up to find some dirt to "fight" what I said. Why? What makes you be like that? You should reflect on this.
---
As for smite and hi-rez: It's been 7 years, isn't it about time to stop expecting the game to just drop dead out of the blue?
---
Any chance of an offline or private server mode for those of us with shitty internet service, Bethesda? 
---
Yeah I hear u, maybe I will try do some trading then. 
---
many of us have proven that the issue is all the unlooted meat pile containers. as soon as everyone starts picking up all the garbage in all the corpses in a nuke zone or white springs, everything goes back to normal.
---
ghouls and nuke zone mobs have special loot that can spawn for each player, regardless if you tagged them or not. so every corpse is generating regular loot for those that tag everything and random glowing blood, glowing meat, ionized meat, hardened mass, glowing mass, high radiation fluids, for everyone else that happens to be in the zone.
---
if you want to do the white springs circuit, pick up all the crap loot and drop it in the ice chest outside of the golf club between spawn cycles.
---
I don't think at level 15 he could craft water purifiers. It of course depends but I think more likely not.
---
No, no no.  That would take away from the 'drama' of having a giant target on the map showing everyone's camps so the griefers can zero in on you and smash one camp after another.
---
Because they can.
---
I just want to know when you are going to expand the map and add new missions and fix the things that are broke instead of taling things away from us
---
*hint*: expecting downvotes will get you downvotes. 
---
I don’t think anyone blames you for it being too late. I put 400 hours in and I still don’t think I’ll be reinstalling it anytime soon.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. I wish that was it.
---
Sweet I too am excited about starting a moonshine still. I hope if you drink too much you temporarily go blind that'd be awesome!!
---
My favorite part of the whole post was the _and we mean "together_ part.
---
I'm pretty sure that server hopping to reset the ghouls is what causes the lag spikes.
---
How was the Skyrim system like? I remember you could make a skill legendary, although I don't remember there being any benefit, it just added a marker and reset it.
---
I would think it's something like that.
---
It really is baffling that they set it up like this in the first place 
---
The Pupper Pack
---
For Smol adventures 500 Atoms.
---
The Big Ole Pupper Pack
---
For all your adventuring needs, 1000 Atoms
---
The Doggo Side Pouch
---
For that bit of extra carry weight, 750 Atoms
---
(Comes in pink for the ladies)

I used to be a HUGE competitive FPS player. If I had a nickle for every hour I spent in the various COD games, I could probably buy a car. A nice car, not some shitbox. About halfway through Black Ops 3, I just found that I couldn't give a fuck anymore. I burned out HARD. 
---
Fallout 76 is *almost* perfect for me. I get to play a game and not be stressed about shit. If I want to find other people, I can. If I want to be left alone, I can. The only change I would make is to the "pacifist" flag. It should cancel out PVP completely. No slap damage. No slap damaged to death and still drop all your junk. Just no PVP damage. But put it on a lock out timer so it can't be abused. 
---
His route covers a fairly large area so he may be tough to track down.  Some players have followed him while plotting his route on the map, like [here](http://dulfy.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-graham.jpg) .
---
It's not your compass, you're just facing backwards.
---
I cant wait to roleplay a member of Gwar.
---
People keep calling it dlc but it seems like it's just updates. Cool none the less but when people tell me Fo76 is getting free dlc I'm expecting new areas, new weapons, new quests for the new area and such.
---
I know there is plenty of people who complain about issues, this thread was aimed at the people who pretend everything is alright, asking why.
---
Looks good! I’ll return in the summer for the vault raids.
---
You left out the obvious answer: Because it was cheaper to produce the game with no scripted, acted, animated, and voiced human NPCs.  Don't think any deeper than that.
---
Say wat? If you camp is in middle of nowhere, even if someone knows where it is, you except that someone to travel to it?
---
You'd have to be known to have something valuable for that to happen.
---
Finally you guys did something right. I fought hard against all the mindless backlash against this game once it was announced, because it was entirely unwarranted, but since the game has been out the entire experience has been a complete trainwreck. I had given up hope that this game was going to improve but this timeline does give me a little hope. Glad you guys gave us actual dates. Hope you can somehow turn this car crash around
---
Isnt the goatman just a wendigo? They always seemed so similar in the stories I read.
---
Nothing to reflect on, it takes 2 seconds to click your name and see your posts in the Smite reddit.  I am always curious when someone bashes one game, what game they hold in high regard and in this case had to laugh.
---
Sure Smite has hung on by life support for a while now, woopity do.  What about all the other games Hi-Rez ran into the ground, taking the money people poured into it to keep it alive and then killing it without a care in the world.
---
Sigh. It's going to be vending machines you build into your camp. We already saw them on noclip doc  before the game was released.
---
Just ballistic, you need a  different perk for energy ammo. I don't know what that one is called.
---
Oh, okay. Thanks for clarifying on that. My intention was to understand your point, not to piss you off, so sorry about that.
---
I agree. I don't personally want to travel all around the map. I hate doing it with the faction vendors. They could let you place a seperate one with the same inventory at your camp if you want. Just make the machine "busy" if someone is using it at either location.
---
All they really need to do is put the machines in the vendor hallway at whitesprings. Make the fast travel free and spawn you inside in case of a nuke. There is the artisans shop right there to craft or access storage. Not to mention tons of other robot vendors.  Perfect location imo.
---
The server just needs to allow 24 spots for all players. Once you leave it disappears. 
---
Wait, so you spent the first six months trying to get basic features to work and now we’re seeing. 3 major updates in the next year?? Talk about going from 0 to 100...
---
I'm fine with the atom prices, because it makes me be picky, save, and really work on weekly and daily challenges. I really think it would lower the aesthetic value of a camp if everyone had ALL these little knick knacks around. But that's just me. 
---
You can really make a few hundred atoms a week pretty easy
---
I hear ya.  I enjoy most genres myself, except I sadly burn out on everything quickly.
---
I also would also rather have a pacifist mode than a survival mode.  I think most people would agree.
---
seems plausible to me, particularly since the servers are so stable with the looters gone.
---
so, really, the nuke zone loot issue is the "everyone can loot flux mats" regardless of tapping.
---
ALSO... yeah, I'm not picking up *all* the trash and carrying it around the whole circuit.
---
This is possible. Your camp visibility can be toggled by having a vending machine.
---
However you going pay 30 caps to travel to other side of map? Neither will I. You want your vending machine  to have action, you better have central location.
---
Cheap? LMAO it's 60$
---
That's not the issue, the issue is when they leave the base there ant go adventure elsewhere, f'ing up the respawns for other people.
---
I’m getting PSTD thinking about the jumping ghrus from dark souls 3 now. Thanks 
---
Wendigo Cave has a good selection of dark themes to use.
---
I can do it for free, GT Xwolfpackleader 
---
Too bad the map is literally every road on the map. It's also been fonfirmed that Graham travels on the roads **not** listed on the outdated map.
---
It was basically just a skill tree reset, allowing you to gain more health/stamina/magicka through leveling. No bonuses or anything, just more levels.
---
But here they specifically state, "resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities".
---
If it's 2000 nukes or fusion cores hell nah
---
cringe
---
Reported spam
---
I have mothman wings stashed, just in case.
---
I wish you could craft dps dummies. Something you could hit or shoot so you can try out weapons. Make it so you can adjust the ballistic, energy, rad, etc .
---
I can mod all pieces of combat armor. GT Xwolfpackleader 
---
[Yeah, I suggested elsewhere earlier today another solution that I think is rather elegant](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/atjylk/2019_fallout_76_roadmap/eh1u5b6/). 
---
did not know that!  thank you! 
---
This game is still shit and that will never change. Rip 76 you were a failed abortion
---
Honestly the negative press was warranted. I would have agreed with you when the game was first announced, because the hate from the start was ridiculous and totally undeserved, but since launch the game has deserved every bit of criticism it has received. Bethesda fucked up bad with this game but this road map gives me a bit of hope they do actually care and want to turn it around.
---
Hopefully they've realized that this game, if it continues on in the state it currently is, is going to hurt their brand and reputation of their company in the long run. I have loved Bethesda ever since I first played Oblivion all those years ago and ever since then knew I could buy all of their games at launch and have a great time. After the FO76 debacle, I had sworn off buying any more of their games until I can see them in depth first, but if they can turn this game around they might be able to save their reputation.
---
If you shake your game boy upside down and turn around three times you can move the truck by the S.S. Anne in Pokemon red too. It helps if you have a full team of pure raised (no rare-candies) lvl 100 Nidokings with strength.
---
i do a vendor bot check at charleston several times a play session. he spawns 3-4 times a week there as a random encounter. his caps are shared with some other vendor, he never has any caps when I see him, only once did he have anything worth buying.
---
Inside an instanced area of white springs where all players of that platform are allowed. Multiple instanced rooms I guess once the player base goes up.
---
Okay.
---
Just trying to give him a starting point.
---
Farm what tho? Turrets don't tag for XP or drops.
---
The issue is when they just leave them there once done farming. 
---
A doggy bag.... Perfect for the hungry wastelanders who demands the freshest ingredients...
---
You are using a play station 💩
---
One can also say that if they truly cared the game wouldn't have been shipped in the state that it was, or that they would have devoted more time and money on getting fixes out at a faster rate rather than taking months just to leave the game in a playable state.
---
You shouldn't feel like you owe them, that isn't a good mentality. They aren't "granting you" the good bits, you paid (and quite a bit) for them, and you are gaining nothing from allowing the bad to be. 
---
F 
---
That's probably the All Rise the game stole from me. Got killed by 2 scortchbeasts with it in hand. When I came back it was gone.
---
I don’t think anyone thinks the game is at all like that. I think you are confusing people who have some positive things to say about the game, and enjoy it regardless of its problems, as “pretending everything is fine.”
---
Just because someone continues to play the game, and doesn’t express every bone they have to pick over it; doesn’t mean they are ignoring problems. 
---
I don't think it does. Some people purposefully hide their camps in a secluded spot to hide it from griefers. Making people's camps harder to find. And to add, out of the 20 or so people on the server how many camps do you normally run across anyways. Having vendors at people's camps is just not a good idea imo
---
Makes way too mutch sense... if they are at your camp they will be useless for the most part, let's do that instead.
---
