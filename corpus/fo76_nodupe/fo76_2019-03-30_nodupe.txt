Cool. The rest of us will continue to play our rich, server hopping, aluminum finding, caps collecting, awesome legendary receiving game for 85 more levels and many more beyond with all of the new content that's dropping through out the year.

---
Enjoy your return to the surface, and thank you for choosing Vault-Tec!
---
Just relog it‚Äôll correct itself. 
---
Eh minor thing but it's originally a $60 game. It's not like there is any other game that adjusts the MTX ratios when the price of the game drops.
---
I'll be the better man and say that we agree to disagree.
---
Good talk. Come back when you have proof to back up your claims.
---
But that‚Äôs an extra 1-2% of budget when knocking is free. Other people suggested ammo but that‚Äôs another expense when knocking, is again, free.
---
The idea was always to release the fallout spin on ESO have something a small studio could dedicate themselves to and keep updating for years
---
Yeah probably should have waited a week and got the cd key for $15.
---
If your on xbox I have a lot for trade
---
Sniper. All it takes is one little patch and gunslinger won‚Äôt work with rifleman. 
---
Just northwest of Watoga 
---
I so wish you were on PC!     For me its not about the protection - I would love the thrill of having to deliver a 'old world royalty' level riddle or die!
---
(if you don't know look up riddles and royalty)
---
I didn‚Äôt know they stacked I gotta tell my friend he‚Äôs a rifle build 
---
If you want level 25 legendary gear, you have to kill level 25 legendary enemies. I understand the frustration, but just stash the good stuff and sell the rest. Will be much more frustrating when you kill the ghouls at level 50 and they drop level 40 legendary gear.
---
Cool, I appreciate the explanation.  It just goes to show that everyone's experience is different. I try to take the approach of "assume positive intent" on everyone's part, something I failed to do. I'll try to chill too. üòÇüëç
---
I'll ask you this, how do I have so many confirmed kills in which I spent only one bullet?
---
No idea if it still does now but I know it did a while back.  I don‚Äôt use pipes anymore so. 
---
I was also disappointed 
---
Join a team and Invest in luck and agility perks with the soon to be released medical malpractice. Best pistol build endgame.
---
My first day in the game and I got a floating spark - I knew then an there the Fallout build tools were working as well as they ever did.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sadly, no. 
---
Sure. I have thought about this myself but I haven't been able to compare the damage between the two with gunslinger and all. I'll compare them when I get the perks and check then. Thanks for the reply.
---
Here's a selection of perks from what you picked that would probably be better. I removed anything related to crafting, lock picking, etc since you can equip those as you need them. The key to a good build is to specialize. Since you want a commando build, you honestly would want the ammo crafting perk (running a rifleman right now and I still want it. Finding ammo is either hard or expensive. )
---
I hope this helps. I also threw in starched genes since mutations can help a TON (marsupial is a must IMO) and you don't want them to disappear as you try to take care of those rads.

Im trying to join your world but it has 24 people on it already. Can you join on me?
---
Good to know I'm not alone. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4
---
Somewhere between those I think
---
Thank you
---
Honesty, the entire reason I posted this. Although I figured I could be the only one, I also realized there could be others like me suffering in silence and Bethesda needs this brought to their attention. 
---
You‚Äôre in my world. I sent you an invite
---
Holy shit that's awesome
---
How you get that hyperbole from my suggestion is up to you. I don't want anything to get *easier*, only faster and more convenient. If there is a chance to eliminate just one loading screen in a game, I am in.
---
Weird.
---
Unyielding is best for bloodied. So is sentinels and cavaliers. Nerd rage is also very good.
---
Could I add the gunsmith perk or is that not ideal for this character build?
---
Also squirrels or opossums 
---
That's kinda what im hoping for, wanna see how he grows up.
---
Here's a tip:
---
Don't spawn at train stations, walk and flank around
---
Nah current mothman looks dope! Also I wouldn't  insult mothman, he could be watching and listening...
---
The BE sniper cause you can trade it for a BE lever.
---
You can find dog armor. So maybe?
---
Everything is fine expect the spawn killing on train stations. For some reason spawning works on vault 76 but not in stations.
---
Why you put it there? Mine‚Äôs on the edge of the cliff right southwest of the Top of the World.
---
Odd I would of just assumed he was a raider in X01 armor.
---
 All this time I never realized I was roleplaying as a Civil War reenactor.  I thought I just liked the outfit.
---
Increase your luck
---
There‚Äôs a good view of top of the world and there steel and copper resource things there
---
That doesn‚Äôt actually work 
---
True...and dead money blew rocks! üòÇ
---
I haven't loaded FONV on my new gaming laptop yet, but I will soon, same for 4. I'm actually worried my RTX2080 card will actually cuase me issues with the older games, but we'll have to see!

Exactly

I have those little pipboy games, why can't I take a seat, pop one in, and play it?
---
I wholeheartedly agree.

OMG, OMG, OMG...

SHE KNOWS WHO WE ARE!!!!!!
---
It‚Äôs usually not a one-shot, it‚Äôs quick fire handmade. They also could be critting. This update has been pretty damning for high-dmg melee
---
There was this movie, say it isn‚Äôt so..the hairdresser guy used to call the peeping Tom, prevert..lolz
---
It‚Äôs really obnoxious. It‚Äôs happened to me twice. I hesitate putting my camp anywhere now since I don‚Äôt know what will get it deleted. 
---
It shouldn‚Äôt allow you to place it if it‚Äôs going to be deleted 
---
Berry mentats. With a crit build and crit banker. You'll crumple no matter what
---
Those are really fair points with the player count. Maybe with the inclusion of higher player servers? Also, I feel like blocking quest progression wouldn't be too big of an issue since adventure still exists (plus it would make it interesting if you have to gain a faction's permission if you really want to play this mode all the way through, it would even really fit for BoS type missions). 
---
Also, you forget about assaultrons. I feel like ten of those ganging up on someone would likely make them die (unless troubleshooter sentinel builds start becoming common). And it was honestly just my DnD nerd coming out with the two dimensional Karma system (plus I really want it acknowledged that vault-tech is lawful evil)
---
It‚Äôs a bit Sad, but in terms of melee tiers. 
---
Unarmed is god tier right now, and if you‚Äôre melee and not using it, you‚Äôre at a significant disadvantage 
---
Yes, unarmed perks work with deathclaw &amp; mole miner gauntlets, death tambos, power fists, meat hooks, and knuckles. There might be more, but those are the most common ones for sure.
---
Is it the best choice? Probably not, but I guess it depends? 2-handed definitely hits harder. But pretty much all unarmed weapons are medium speed, so even though you might not one-hit spongier mobs like super mutants or robots, you can usually get 2 or 3 hits off before the enemy can do too much. Overall, it's a pretty good balance between speed and raw damage.
---
My current toon is an unarmed/explosives specialist. I got very lucky with random mutations, and landed talons AND twisted muscles for free, which really makes the build playable long-term. Tactics wise, it's not rocket science, but it sure is satisfying.... sprint towards the enemy (preferablly from behind) and punch them in the face. I often lead with a molotov if I've got enough distance between me and them before the explosions start. Early game it was all about throwing knives as your're charging, but they don't scale especially well for late game.
---
I guess no on can be a "classy" raider :p
---
Pipe bolt has a slower rate of fire and no mag modification (no Armor piercing rounds). But using those perks, my IE pipe bolt will kill anything from stealth. It's all about the gamble of if they'll change it. and if you will have perk points to take advantage of the boost. Even just having gunslinger, expert gunslinger and master gunslinger will raise your overall dmg 30%
---
No but i can craft xo1 targetting hud and from what i know theres no recipes in the entire game for xo1 but the armor 
---
Oh. Sweet. I'll have to hope my luck in game is better than my luck at work. Wont be able to test my game luck for at least another 2 hours. Bah. 
---
Lol, ty though for the input! :) 
---
Where do you get the plans for those hats?
---
I did exactly this on my first playthrough. I started with 2 handed and almost spent 9 points on the 2 handed perks until I found my first mole miner gauntlet. The unarmed perk card works with unarmed weapons. Even tho unarmed has less damage perks than 1 and 2 handed, it's the melee class with the most potential DPS output. Both the twisted muscles and talons mutations work on unarmed weapons. The meat hook is bugged and gets the benefits from both unarmed and 1 handed perks, but I wouldn't invest in it because it will most likely get patched in the future.
---
Right. I‚Äôm just mentioning it because that was the solution Todd proposed on the stream today 
---
Oh really?  I have the X01 targeting HUD and the XO1 helmet attachment that scans living things.  Had no idea that it was bugged, thought it was just rare lol
---
Yeah he looks cool. But still i wouldve preffered a man looking moth
---
I hate to say it, but you're wrong. Pretty much everybody who ever reported seeing the mothman described it as a giant bat or bird (usually an owl). It was the papers that started calling it Mothman because a) Batman was already copywrited and b) alliteration. I've literally read The Mothman Prophecies (the first major book on the subject) over a dozen times, and have read copies of a lot of the initial witness reports, and not once did anyone call it a man moth.
---
If there were another counter to VATs critical headshots that slice through otherwise effective damage reduction, I'd be inclined to agree. Stealth is the only rock for that scissor, currently. 
---
huh? they just had two decent patches and have months of shit lined up. how the fuck is that skeleton crew vaporware?
---
as if a business is gonna rend their garments and self-flagellate in public like it was fucking Oprah
---
Oh ok, my bad. I didn‚Äôt watch that. Is there going to be special rewards or is it just the weekly reward things? Because no point in making a new character if they just get deleted.
---
/gatekeeping
---
Thanks for rubbin it in. That‚Äôs why I love this community so much. üò∂
---
I think its a bug cause the recipes for the attachments arent real at the moment 
---
What im talking about ist he depictions off moth man the one the mothman from the game is based off. What im saying is that i wished it looked more like the statue they have of him
---
Different bolts for different folks.
---
Peradokid on ps4
---
I have 3* AA 40% power attack damage deathclaw guantlet. Is that worth making unarmed class for??
---
If you‚Äôre on console, try power cycling the console. I‚Äôm on Xbox and the quest didn‚Äôt work until I held the power button 10 seconds and pulled the power cord out. 
---
I disagree with this. I agree that handmades are out of check right now. But staying out of sight is the way. I‚Äôm Melee and stealthboys destroy the ability to compete effectively. 
---
The problem with your argument is that it seems to imply new players won't get better? Even if you constantly die, you still get better as long as you keep trying. I'm not sure where this fact got lost in the last 10 years. Way too many people seem to think you need a newbie only server. Newbies playing each other doesn't make anyone better. Actually, it can make you worse because you learn bad habits.
---
Stuff like that really takes a lot of the fun out of survival
---
Unfortunately probably 
---
You have had a much different experience than I have had. Good Luck to ya!
---
I could use it on my t-51 but the helmet wouldn‚Äôt work. Also unlocked a vault boy garden gnome which I now can‚Äôt find anywhere and it said it was an hour sale. Maybe related?
---
You might be right, but they used the term 'dungeons' in the panel. Will have to wait and see what that ends up meaning. 
---
Not only that, the in-game cryptids are supposed to be only vague semblance of folklore creatires not literal representations. The actual mothman doesn't exist in game, but the mutated giant moth does, and while loosely called mothman, it is not *the* mothman. 
---
Which is fine for basic things but when you have intricate wiring involved it becomes a pain. 
---
3000 rounds enough?
---
No, what I‚Äôm saying is if a newbie starts with an actual good player, it‚Äôll be fair. But if a good player starts when the newbie is level 50 the guy will probably get bullied into no tomorrow.
---
People camp vault 76 and you can‚Äôt fast travel if you have to make a new character. 
---
That's fair. Personally, I like that they made it different. But I hear ya.  Have you ever seen the Boris Vallejo [painting](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e7/1d/1b/e71d1b22d86442cf7a07b01f49fe5cc7.jpg) of the Mothman they used on the paperback version of the book? I always thought it would make a sweet tattoo.

How can you guarantee you really switch servers? A few patches back I notices that the game toggles me between 2 worlds over and over. So I perma block random people to get past that. Does quitting to desktop get you out of that loop? Or is there another way to break the server repeats?
---
I didn‚Äôt say BL3 was coming out 4/3. I said I‚Äôm out on 4/3.  But thanks for bursting my bubble??
---
No clue.. I‚Äôd assume so, though. It was only a short proposal, not an official announcement or anything 
---
Only reason not to do unarmed is power armor other than that do it
---
Well, when someone is not moving because of sentinel armor, accuracy does not matter much.
---
I can deal 1,800 damage with sneak, head shot, and critical hits on a black powder pistol. After the survival update, every player is left with 20% HP. Some people say they can one shot people, but they never have an explanation why they are able to.
---
The only time I have seen someone with over 200 kills without a death was people boosting kills by shooting friends. So, I call BS on 890 kills. Unless you have three friends endlessly drawing enemies attacks, you did not get that many kills solo. If you are not completely full of shit, I would like to see a twitch stream or video of the greatest PVPer ever. But considering you were banned from that filthy casuals 76 subreddit, my vote is you are full of shit.
---
Wouldn't it just turn into a PVP bloodbath?
---
Would like to hear how you stay out of sight in melee with a ranged combatant. At some point you will have to close the distance, and unless you've found a way to pull your head in like a turtle, that crit is going to land.
---
*live free* **OR DIE**.

Survival is trash.

Went on last night. 
---
Top player has been alive for 11hours with a 15k bounty. 
---
What‚Äôs he doing? He‚Äôs either A. Exploiting with cheats and or B. Exploiting by boosting. 
---
Add NPCs that allow factions to be joined. 
---
Allow all areas to scale with level once past 50 or 60. (Incentive to go back and play the whole left side of map). 
---
Along with that add it many different Legendary spawns for Deathclaws, sloths, Mothman, super mutant behemoth, etc.   Also add in random encounters raid like a group of wendingos attacking your base.
---
Finally chance to choose your race or mutate into Ghoul or super mutant
---
Yes i do know that but i still would like to see an omnious gigantic mothman 
---
I'd love to see some sort of binding or lock feature that would prevent certain items from being sold, dropped or scrapped.  I accidentally scrapped a lvl 30 Dragon I got off the Fasnacht sloth a little while back which would have been a good gun (solo rifle build) for that character once he had reached that level.
---
Perhaps with criticals, but that‚Äôs not true on normal non/vats shots.
---
I don't know, which is why I'm wondering.
---
+karma
---
Yes it does look really cool would love to see this version too
---
Did they say anything with regards to having your character name displayed in the world as opposed to your account name? 
---
I'd be fine with having account names displayed on say the map screen in the character list in Brackets after the character name. I really wish though that the character that I created could actually be known in the world by the name I gave him.
---
I agree with you because that's what raiders did in previous games. 
---
If Bethesday really wanted people to roleplay they would force you to pick a faction and then you would have to wear their equipment,  access their resources,  etc.... this would effectively create classes in the game capable of doing different things. 
---
Like if you choose the Enclave you would have access to the bunker.... other factions would not. 
---
However,  this would never work with the system they've set up for nuking. And people would complain. 
---
I've actually been preparing to turn myself into a low level quest giver once player vending comes out. I've set up a bar outside Flatwoods and I'm planning to send new players that don't have any caps to spend on simple fetch quests in exchange for a set of basic supplies 
---
? 
---
I‚Äôm given the option to just join another server. 
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I do 
---
You sure it doesn‚Äôt work on the PS4 non pro? Every article I read says it works on both. 
---
True. I nearly have all the gunslingers and I have all the riflemans, and am going to invest in some stealth damage perks, so hopefully that will be quite damaging when i‚Äôm done.
---
It‚Äôs not that another person has placed it in my spot, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs a area for future content, but it may be glitching. I‚Äôm not sure.
---
who gives a shit, you'll complain about something else by then anyway
---
I'll buy 3 per cap. 
---
New weapon incoming. 
---
Objection! Knuckles: reflect all damage back to target at 150% it‚Äôs damage. 
---
\+1 for an answer on this... what were your spots, u/Mistiqe? I managed to get about 5 verified legendary kills in 30 minutes last night between Leader of the Pack and West Tek, but then even with server hopping, didn't get any more for the next hour and a half. Any tips would be appreciated.
---
Are you aware that you can't have 30-50k?
---
Same thing happened to me too. But no door just boarded up. Hopped servers a few time but didn‚Äôt fix. 
---
Wow, that‚Äôs really weird. 
---
Yah fuck Bethesda 
---
Just wave infront doors..
---
So every time someone wants to come in you think that the apocalypse is happening again?
---
Hmm, strange... because across my several characters I seem to have much much more than that. 
---
Didnt they say something about the vault being under Arktos Labs ?
---
yeah, I know. but I have a lot of little stuff at my camp and it's annoying to have to do that for every piece especially when there is a perfectly fine "repair all" function already built into the game.
---
Isn't there a perk that auto uses stims?
---
Coming soon.
---
Capital offense! Handmade rifle: +10% damage to players, +25% increased rate of fire
---
Oh ok
---
It is weird, I don‚Äôt hate them I‚Äôm just hoping for a solution. I really liked my camp :(
---
Never should have come here
---
I'm having with with it and it actually made me go back and play 4 more as well when I feel I need all those npcs and non environmental story.

It also explodes.

I have had the RNG nirvana about a half dozen times now. Even to the point of multiple legendary items on a single bot. Nearly every time, the more insanely good the drops are, the more likely it‚Äôs a countdown to a controls not responding / disconnect. 
---
Exactly.
---
And I am really tired of these people like complaining about others because they just don't like the game
---
Are we damn forced to like it?
---
Do we have to apologise for not seeing it as good as they claim it to be?

Keep the brainless looting &amp; vendor selling &amp; events. I have been out for some time and I can't say I miss it.

But yes the fault is ours.
---
Whatever, dellusional fanboys
---
1.  Best news I have heard.
---
2.  I seriously hope they don't add a Battle Royale mode to the game but I think they will.  It will probably be the Nuclear Winter thing.  Wastelanders will be Vault openings with Human NPCs.  I hope!
---
3 &amp; 4.  Excellent news.
---
8.  I think the quests in general are very good, especially in comparison to other live games.
---
*blows smoke from barrel* too bad I only heal myself
---
I have that one yes, but it‚Äôs never conflicted before the game was updated so I‚Äôm presuming it‚Äôs a new issue since the patch. 
---
Quite confident on that considering swapping the perk out and equipping it again seems to fix the issue, I have a feeling it‚Äôs happening when I‚Äôm doing something specific like fast travel or joining a new world.
---
Appreciate the suggestion though!
---
Tomorrow sound good? Around 2 pm est
---
They have dark nuka cola
---
Mmm... levels don‚Äôt mean a lot though. Level isn‚Äôt a direct power measurement. There are lots of 150+ players who have hybrid builds that aren‚Äôt meant for pvp. Your SPECIAL doesn‚Äôt impact you all that much compared to FO4. Only perks do. 
---
I‚Äôm in my 200‚Äôs and have been killed by good 40‚Äôs who built entirely for a specific kind of combat.
---
It‚Äôs somewhat impractical to balance around new players unfortunately. No one stats a new player. You can only make the learning curve less jarring, but considering FO76‚Äôs design it would be very very difficult to do. 1-50 doesn‚Äôt take long in adventure mode. Then when you‚Äôve learned mechanics you swap to survival mode.
---
&gt;Just roleplay as a shitty raider please.
---
-OP
---
Unyielding armor for sure. Its extra damage and max ap on low hp. It can help you make the most out of barbarian and thw agility equivalent.  Cavalier is better than sentinel for melee builds cause you can use it to close the distance but be careful as it disengages when you attack.
---
Yeah I have the Woodland Warrior for my T-51 but I never bought it. I like it a lot but I can't add it to the helmet. I think I'll buy the camo pack just so i can change my helmet Haha
---
I only have one character and she‚Äôs at cap limit and I always carry 250 stims and 250 Radaways. No way in hell in going to pvp mode without a new character. 
---
agree
---
Rewards in Survival Mode should unlock across all characters.  So earning a unique Legendary Weapon or Armor should grant you a schematic of the item in Adventure mode.
---
I might be being thick but what is Wastelanders? Can't find it on Google. well can't find anything similar to Fallout called wastelanders?

I actually just clicked "Hide All" and clicked on Vendors and it's already revealed a lot. Turns out I had met with a Raider affiliated vendor in Sutton. I never knew! But now I know where all the vendors are and have my next goal.
---
It's at least nice that most of the unique Vendors are situated rather close by. I can see a Responders in Lewisburg, to the East we have Raiders, East of them is Watoga, North is Harpers Ferry, and South West West is Whitespring. Seems like a decent route, maybe not most optimal in that exact pathing, but not too shabby. Especially if you want to be closer to the center of the map, and I guess depending on where you want to be you can change the route a bit.
---
Thanks again.

I do have the advanced connectors.  I tried putting the one threw the wall. The have the code pylon on outside. And I just wanted a switch for the inside. Do I have to use the floor plate?

i have a few times gotta get lucky and let the top 3 live in peace. you may find a server with no pvp maniacs

I've been having trouble with that spot recently. Usually I go there and there's about 3-4 ants fighting the deathclaw. Now I've been showing up to a deathclaw surrounded by one dead ant and several dead roaches
---
Changed from a normal PS4 with SSHD to a PS4 Pro with SSD. A little faster it got.

I keep hearing the "If its ever on sale at 20$ or less i'll buy it"  
---
  
---
So aggravating. 
---
Read all the other responses, moron. 
---
I have a scar across one eye and intermittent double vision in the other. 
---
Trust me, if I could fix the problem entirely with glasses, it would be fixed. 
---
Imbecile.

What about people who don't have the time to sit a while and complete challenges on a regular basis? Between the atoms themselves being the price they are, and the cost per item in the atom shop, someone who doesn't play so often wouldn't have those kind of Atoms sitting around, and if they wanted to buy atoms via microtransaction they could end up paying as much as another game's DLC just for some cosmetics. Take the Blackbird paint, for instance - that cost 1800 Atoms, and was available for only one day. If you didn't have the ability to consistently earn those atoms ingame, you'd end up having to spend maybe up to 20 dollars just to unlock one paint job - the same price as the whole Nuka World expansion for Fallout 4, just for a set of Power Armor paint jobs.
---
If you can get online regularly and do your daily and weekly challenges to save up, that's just fine and dandy, but anyone who can't do that is just outta luck when something shows up on the Atom shop for a limited time - even if they were to drop everything and complete every challenge they could, there's still a cap on how many atoms can be earned daily so they might end up still missing out on what they want unless they purchase some Atoms instead, even if they hadn't bought anything else.
---
On their own, the Atoms' microtransaction price *or* the Atom Shop prices wouldn't be an issue, but combined they make Atom Shop content too expensive if you're not going to be grinding Challenges every day.
---
You shld post this on the fallout subreddit. Posting it here won't make much sense since mostly everyone is alr playing it. Posing it here mostly only gets replies essentially saying yeah it's a shame. 
---
I could up my luck but I would have to change around my whole build
---
Ah yeah maybe with the sale.  Gotta place that gnome before it ends lol
---
Yesssssssssss!!!!!!
---
Oh and I am going to absolutely abuse the fact it‚Äôs customizable as well 
---
I think you shouldn‚Äôt worry about how much money you spent on it or how much time you invested in FO3/4 into developing a character compared to this game. If you‚Äôre not hooked now on this title, don‚Äôt bank on being interested in it later. You‚Äôre doing yourself a disservice if you think you have to like FO76, and don‚Äôt feel bad if it simply doesn‚Äôt fit you.
---
I could talk about all the reasons why this game is great for me, but my criteria isn‚Äôt how you should evaluate your enjoyment.  Play something you want to play, otherwise you‚Äôll just end up concentrating on why you don‚Äôt like it.
---
You can get 100% damage reduction, at least from explosions, without legendary armor by using the right perks. My character has the doggy perk and as long as I have stamina the sonar attacks just tickle my character. The agent orange (agent green?) attacks are a different story...
---
With non crits it can kill almost anything but ass sent if my first 2 shots deal no dmg I crit and it downs them
---
Sorry someone already claimed it
---
The high level people are looking for fights where the low level people probably arent that's why they probably get in the top 3 
---
I'd never played an MMO before...but I had played a LOT of BSG games so I was pretty well prepared for what I got! üòÇ
---
With that said they also fixed a lot of the most annoying ones quicker than they ever had with previous titles, so I was actually pleasantly surprised by a month in.
---
No problem. Thank you!
---
My buddy has a collection of signs expressly for this purpose and it is indeed a salt mine. He wants to kill people with more and more lame weapons until he's beating people to death with a bobby pin. 
---
It's a guaranteed salt is a way of life down here method. 
---
Supressors gatling gun (super luck on this one as its 90% less weight) supressors gatling plasma (full weight) supressors ski sword, and vampiric walking cane (honestly the attack rate is amazing and I can heal pretty steadily off of it. Very small vats cost)  and a tesla rifle, and a furious laser rifle. 
---
Overall its fairly heavy, the gatling plasma being the worst. The tesla rifle is for low level swarms. And the laser rifle is for mid level fights. High levels get the heavy guns or melee.
---
Maybe this is just next level marketing.  Accidental skin unlocked and then ‚Äòwhoops, guess I‚Äôll buy‚Äô.
---
Nice try, Todd.  I‚Äôm going to buy Skyrim just to spite you.
---
I figure those people will probably when(if) we get real NPCs
---
It‚Äôs a great game. Thank you for being polite. 
---
Carbon offsets
---
It's even worse when. They OHKO you with something that you wouldn't think would be able to like a full auto handmade. Kept getting killed by one bullet from it 
---
I see. Thanks for the heads up on the black titanium. I didn't know you could tag things either, I'll check that out.
---
I definitely am gonna take forever to try and sell the Steel, so I think while I'm still a very low level, I'll make some throwing knives and throw them around before they end up getting weaker. As for wood, maybe I'll build a CAMP to expend some of it haha.
---
You mentioned Super Sledges and that they can only be equipped outside of Power Armour, but then go to say "if you do run without power armor" and mention the Deathclaw Gauntlet. I'm just a bit confused on wording and which can or can't be in Power Armour.
---
As for perks, I've got two Pack Rats so far which help with junk, ironically I'm maxed out in storage and can't store any more scrapped junk. Armour weighing less would be great, maybe aid too.
---
That Power Armour sounds great, hopefully I happen to find it, if not I'll check it out myself. Thanks again!
---
I think it's fine the way it is, because players should never at any point be paying real life money for cosmetics and hand waves. 
---
It's like when you get some websites trying to get clicks saying a skin pack costs the same as a GOTY edition of Witcher 3 or something, it's like yeah it does, except the fucking Witcher can't be bought for taking photos inside of mines ever. 
---
That would be amazing and save on fast travel fees.
---
1.  New characters only, you cannot transfer.  You start with nothing.  Seasonal with rewards.  That solves pretty much everything you have mentioned.
---
Go play on survival for 30 minutes I promise you won‚Äôt have that problem no more lol 
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Absolutely!
---
A disease you say? That sounds like a glitch to me. Cause that's the thing. I had a feeling the scorchbeast attacks where way more powerfull than other times. Atleast today right before I made this post. Almost like a was wearing next to no armor. Which wasn't the case.
---
I searched for that name and it says it can not find a user with that tag, can you search for me RogueAOV and see is that works?
---
Beat me to it.
---
Sweet, thanks for this. I was looking for a post like this last night when I was farming legendaries for Crushing Blow and was hella salty that only one of them counted. 
---
The story has a happy ending though, I went to find what exactly Crushing Blow is and saw all of the upcoming rewards for legendary challenges. They all suck so I'm good!
---
Yeah I've seen that too like they fart those things. Let's hope they also adress this in the future.
---
Spot on sir, spot on! All these people that had supposedly been playing the various FO, (and other BSG games) for years were suddenly surprised a new title had bugs. LMFAO. 
---
What was surprising was that BSG fixed as many as they did as quickly as they did!
---
Hahahaha. 
---
"I made a Super Sledge from FO76" is the same as "I made a Vault Suit from FO76." They're different in every game so you SPECIFY. Even from 4 to 76 the SUITS are different so you'd specify WHICH GAME
---
I assumed they were supposed to be doing that when I first played the beta lol
---
I'm an idiot, my name had 187 after it
---
Oh yeah buddy, I was there too, that's why I carefully used the word "still" in my title.
---
Yeah, but it kicks in at around 20% health or less. Not 50%
---
Any one wanna tra√≠do me marsupial serum I got a two shot combat shotgun,asassins explosive dragon,and a zealots grognaks axe
---
Can you post a screenshot of where your camp is on the map?
---
May I ask what exactly is the effect of the doggy perk?
---
I‚Äôm asking the same questions
---
You know, I am totally for these "we should be able to make it" threads, but to be really honest, converting oil to plastic requires whole refineries and chemical processing facilities and I'm just not sure that level of technical sophistication is going to fit into the ol' tinkerer's bench.
---
If you upgrade it, then it kicks in earlier right? I think up to 40%. 
---
Stealth Boys + Chameleon armor + Fireproof + Dense = dead kids with their duped TSE. Smoked an entire crew of 50 odd dudes clearly on alts in about a minute flat. Good shit. 
---
Diseased SBs can give you blight. It‚Äôs an annoying -1 to all special points but it‚Äôs not new or a glitch. 
---
&gt;   Sentinel seems a bit over powered 
---
I wonder if  Sentinel  assassins will be nerfed. I think Bethesda introduced it into the game with the assumption that it was rare and that no one could possibly acquire more than one or two pieces.  I don't think they took into account trade and people even paying real world currency to build a full set.   
---
I don't think so, but I will check it out.
---
Anyway, I'm certain it wasn't a perk, mod, or anything like that, because they didn't regenerate health as a Stimpak does - over time - but instanstly.
---
Like I said, it was a common bug back in the day.
---
&gt; I like to make the sounds of the guitar from the Mysterious Stranger from previous titles, with my mouth over area chat, and only when killing other players.
---
lmfao
---
This is the best post on r/76 EVER. 
---
Curious too, would like 
---
No consequences?   While you were studiously destroying his in-game camp with a virtual toothpick over the span of an evening, ‚ÄúJohn from  Accounting‚Äù was cinching the real-world deal with your gal.  
---
I'm sorry but what's a SSDD??
---
Make stash boxes not replicate with the server all the time, allowing for virtually unlimited storage without server instability.
---
That is awesome. I did not expect it to have such a big variety of weapons. I'm looking forward to stumbling upon them all!
---
And thanks for the guide too, this will be super helpful for helping me start up and get a better understanding. :)
---
It's easy to get into the top three, just go anywhere other than Whitesprings or Watoga.  I hit #1 last night just roaming around the ash heap.
---
Solid state disk drive
---
Haha I love posts like this, gives me ideas I didn't know where possible.
---
Our lord is the black mirror in front of us, and the abstract number tied to each and every one of us known as a "bank account". What do you mean there is "no lord". You're touching it right now!

i am finnish...ed with the game
---
They aren't different, though. They use the same models, and vault suits just change the numbers.
---
How do you play? Melee or ranged.
---
Thank all of you for your help. I got it to work!
---
Up until about lvl50, when you start getting Ammosmith and SuperDuper, I would carry several weapons of different ammo type otherwise I would run out.  One solid melee weapon to save ammo too.
---
I pretty much keep a shotgun around as soon as I could take Enforcer, that perk saved me so many times.
---
 Mostly ranged
---
Bloodied?
---
Tbf I don't think they can retroactively change the prices of the paint jobs already in the shop without refunding Atoms, which might not even be possible. 
---
At 3 points, avoid 30% of all damage at the cost of 30 AP. It's an agility perk.
---
Not sure if you Have to. That‚Äôs what I did though. 
---
No not a low health build I just wanna do pve
---
&gt;If you didn't have the ability to consistently earn those atoms ingame, you'd end up having to spend maybe up to 20 dollars
---
But that's my point... nobody HAS to buy anything, they're just cosmetics.  They're not going to make you any stronger, live longer or get farther.  
---
I was lucky enough to see the Blackbird when it was available, others were not. That's just the luck of the roll. Life isn't fair, never has been and never will be. You can choose to rant about how unfair it is or you can press on with life and beat the bastards the next time. I choose to live my life with the latter outlook. 
---
I‚Äôm on pc, so completely different set of servers....but I have had horrible server stability issues all week.  Disconnects and crashes regularly.  So don‚Äôt feel too bad 
---
PLEASE PLEASE BETHESDA, make an "EASY MODE"...it could be called something like "Explorer Mode" and have easier combat and not so much killing/being attacked all the time! Then those of us who aren't such great gamers could still feel good about playing. 
---
Why though?
---
Is this over a lead resource? I think it‚Äôs near my base. Awesome job!
---
Yeah I could use those perks but I currently have a build that is all offense and almost no defense. That's how I really hope to play and mostly am able too. I want to strike fast and mercyless, while being rather vulnerable myself. Hence why I would love to be a little more agile in my first person controls still. I'm thinking in terms of the acrobatic perks like there were in Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion or heightened movement speed like that one shout from Skyrim.
---
I love it for one simple reason - the servers are almost never out of stock because people are so busy killing/griefing each other places that are always empty on Survival servers are often fully stocked. I've picked up items in Sugar Grove in the last week that I didn't even know spawned there because they never - never - been present on a server I've been on before. 
---
Yes it's dangerous as hell (another layer of excitement imo) and lawless but a safe server is just a click away. I didn't think I would be on it much but I really like how at any moment a couple of dudes can just run up on you if you aren't careful/scouting well. 
---
I was in my underwear until rosie awarded me harness. wore that till lvl 80 when slicked paint was released. now I look like i just came out carebear massacre.
---
Iv been seeing a bunch in fort Defiance lately
---
Ah that‚Äôs odd. Figured if I bought it it‚Äôd be permanent. Oh well, guess I learned 
---
There's legendary armor that does that as well. I once had a piece of it. There's also regenerating armor but don't think it works that fast. Not saying it's not bugged. Knowing Bethesda it's most likely a bug. Hard to believe they implemented this with the invisibility bug still in the game. This is why I will avoid PVP for a long time. When the complaint lvl drops to something reasonable I may give it a try.
---
That's kind of a shame though, I don't want to see it so one sided for either choice
---
The fact that melee does much of anything against power armor is pretty silly, it should require powerful ranged and explosive weapons.
---
Ehh, I totally understand someone being upset at the quality not being to their standard. The absurd amount of hate toward the game and the developers, however, is not justified. 
---
lol no worries, i have added you to my friends list. i am in a team right now so you can join the server i am on if you would like.
---
No I‚Äôm complaining that I paid to be a beta tester to a game that should have been complete on release, like Division 2.
---
You can pve with low health. With ranged you want hydraulic bracers, they'll give you more strength so more carry weight. Jetpack is a decent answer so you can get into position. I recommend emergency protocols if you do use low health. Kinetic servos for legs to regain AP while retreating.
---
This is illegal
---
Todd talked about it at PAX East, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to fundamentally change the game and I‚Äôm not at all allowed to talk about it‚Äù.
---
Alright thanks
---
What about a 50 bloodied explosive ultracite drill? I might have one.
---
are you for real LOLLL
---
What number is cap limit?
---
Always check their notes for plans. 
---
What?
---
Nah, I can actually be pleased. I was impressed with Division 2 launch. It feels like a complete game even though they are still adding things to it.
---
Hope so because if not I‚Äôm screwed. 
---
Server crashed ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ heading into silo now. 
---
Run down the road from the shooting range, there‚Äôs a truck with a .50 on a stand in the bed. It only spawns once per server so if it‚Äôs not there someone already got it. Hop til you find it. 
---
Looks like it's near multiple pre-existing locations. I've heard that the issue you're experiencing could be caused by having your camp module too close to a pre-existing location. Try moving the camp module as far away as you can from the pre-existing locations in your build area (in this case put it at the right edge of your build area) and see if it resolves it.
---
I've had the "A recent update has blocked your camp" error as well with my camp that is almost right outside Site Alpha. Moved my camp module to the north edge of my build area (part most far away from Site Alpha) and haven't had it happen since. 
---
I think that's a problem with some FO games. If anything criminal groups should be the best equipped. They survive so long and live nicely because they're able to make the tough decisions. Morality be damned, if they see something they want, they'll kill for it. They should be wearing the NICEST gear. 
---
Yeah, I'm avoiding it from now on too.
---
Not really! Is a bit south of the west tek
---
I‚Äôm on pc and bought the game on day 1.  While I genuinely enjoy playing the game, and I really do that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still here....it is a massive disappointment.  I will go for entire workweek (I wish I was exaggerating), where the game will not even work or servers can not handle any actually gameplay past 10 minutes.  A lot of the butthurt comes from a AAA game that is barely functional for many 5 months after release  :(
---
I just want to the game to work.  That‚Äôs it.  I don‚Äôt want new content, I want the content that we have to work.  Even I am sick of the excuses
---
I‚Äôve seen people suggest this before but YES I would love that!
---
It‚Äôs just frustrating because it‚Äôs built in a way I can‚Äôt just drop and replace it. I‚Äôm not sure which way id move the camp piece it fix it.  It doesn‚Äôt make sense it would originally let me place it.
---
I got a Dragon from one, thats good
---
Ok, I‚Äôm gonna need evidence for 1-2 shots.
---
That doesn‚Äôt match any sort of test I did with the Hunting Rifle.
---
been playing since launch, took a couple months off at the new year, 500 hours of gameplay later i am just bored. bethesda nerfed a lot of the core mechanics that made the game interesting. and they're so slow in updating the game for essential quality of life features.
---
don't get me wrong, server stability is defiantly a lot better than it used to be [xbox] but with every update there is something taken away or new bugs pop up.
---
as long as the dlc are still free the atom shop can stay, ill pop in from time to time.
---
Doesn't bother me at all. It would be like Elder Scrolls VI being released and someone that's a huge Skyrim fan hearing it sucked on Youtube and not getting it. Hell I saw a video in my feed the other day that was like "WHY ELDER SCROLLS VI WILL SUCK" and I'm like "Wow getting on that train early aren't we. 
---
I'm having a good time playing 76, my buddy is, my sister is, my neighbor is. Everyone I know irl that actually owns the game has been having a great time playing it. Internet wankers mean nothing. 
---
Thanks, but XB1.
---
I will after I make dinner
---
Yes, a few days now
---
Roadmap says winter is coming..,
---
It can only work in a couple of ways. I shouldn‚Äôt worry, it won‚Äôt mean hundreds of camps on a map. More like say if 10 was the max on a map, 9 might have a camp placed. Only one spot is then free on that specific map/server. If somebody picked up their camp and logs out, there‚Äôs now 2 spots. 
---
It also goes hand in hand with private servers.
---
What missing child?
---
What does a PC code cost?  
---
I dunno, you can't ride a bike.
---
I would recommend r/fo76bazaar but if you are interested in trading your gilded minigun I would offer you my tse minigun with weight reduction and 3k caps for it
---
Apparently I heard that some guy on eBay is currently selling a lot of copies of the game for PC for 5 dollars. Just heard it today. Not sure where
---
Sounds like a good problem to have. 
---
$60 if I'm not mistaken 
---
First guy gets there, he flips a switch that sets off a ‚Äúraid radio‚Äù which you can then tune into on the radio, which gives you the location on your map, and you can the fast travel there.  Those 4 are made into a team, and the door opens.  
---
Laying the third triggers the first and so on, makes kiting through narrow corridors and choke points a lot of fun. Not that I need more than 2 usually as they hit for 400 damage plus 125 radiation damage. 
---
Just one more bug in Fallout 76.
---
Add it to the list.
---
It sort of is... the recoil is a bit of a pain though and it breaks a lot faster.
---
Keep up the good work 
---
I looked through ebay because I heard about that but I couldn't find it. All I found were a bunch of most likely stolen keys
---
Good boy....
---
How can yo7 not prove its your account? Surely it is locked.to.your email address?
---
time to hunt down the howard
---
There‚Äôs a trader named pirateglenn1 - that‚Äôs his PSN, and I believe he probably has a legendary .50 cal he could sell you! He‚Äôs a great dude, has wonderful prices. 
---
I‚Äôve server hopped both locations multiple times and keep getting low level MGs and can‚Äôt find any on bosses/scorchbeasts/legendary creatures 
---
Add it to nukashine for nukashine dark, +150% melee damage, but -4 perception and may cause blackouts.
---
the fuck are you talking about? If you're role-playing at least label the post as such, it's hard to understand what you're saying.
---
Thank you for the lead
---
I‚Äôd love to get ANYTHING off the SBQ, period. Out of the last 5 times I joined in to fight the queen, inflicting SOME damage mind you, only one time dropped loot. JUST ONE TIME. The other times wasn‚Äôt my client trying to catch up with the server, just nothing, not even meat or hide. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if this is because only those who‚Äôve done the MOST damage get anything, or my client is so laggy that on my end I may have gotten the hit marker but the server doesn‚Äôt register it and says ‚ÄúF U‚Äù but it‚Äôs becoming frustrating to say the least. 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be cheaper to buy a used xbox disc and set up new xbox live?
---
Mine started doing it today after I got home from work. It worked perfectly when I went in this morning though!
---
All of these features aren't just for survival right?
---
I'm awaiting completion of an update. I might not make it in time.
---
You are a troll. Change our minds.
---
Absolutely! Happy to help. 
---
Yea, I was going to continue going, mentioning that Mr Handy (Gutsy) wouldn't be able to apprehend you on account of lacking hands or even appendages that could restrain an adult human, then cookup some excuse for Assaultrons, but that would've just dragged the joke on way too long! lol
---
Granted, we could always switch back and forth on mods, but I kinda feel like that cheapens everything on the whole. Like it's a "Oh, BRB everyone, I have to pop over to Adventure Mode so I can do the next part of the quest quick!" kind of situation lol That's the sort of thing we'd want to avoid. It might work to make them join the faction but on the same token, where's your loyalty then if you're going to bounce back and forth? Plus, if Karma plays any hand in things *(that's assuming **both** of my ideas get added)*, you might not even be able to join them. I think that's sort of a nice feature with having Karma. If you want to change your side, you have to make up for it by doing good/bad first and prove are committed to the change.
---
As for server sizes... If my theory of how their servers work is at all correct, that each player is assigned to a CPU Core on a 24-core Xeon, then there's hope for increases. I suspect we'll be stuck with 24 for at least another 12 months, assuming there's a higher-core count Xeon that's compatible with the motherboards they're using. Otherwise, switching to AMD EPYC and gaining a ***massive*** core count increase (and upgrade path) would be great, but much more expensive in comparison. However, given those 24 core Xeons are capable of 48 threads, if Bethesda can optimize the game even further, they could maybe bump it up to 28, or 32 players. That'd still leave 16 threads (albeit not as powerful as a dedicated core) to process any of the overhead and inter-engine-communication that keeps everything synced up...
---
Damn that offer is beyond tempting, but I'm afraid ill have to decline. However should I sell it, I'll let you know first before posting an ad
---
how do you go invisible
---
That is what I thought but apparently they changed it, the password, and phone number. I added 2 factor authentication to a bunch of accounts today so something similar won't happen again. 
---
And a ton of hotel rooms... ü§î
---
48" TV at a few meter and i was begining to feel pretty old with how text is so small in a lot of recents games.
---
I‚Äôm here for all of this 
---
Thanks I will always be happy to buy it anytime and I can even throw in several 3*legendaries if you do ever sell it
---
I really think it will have humans. *And* it will introduce Robot Companions. Mark these words! 
---
Random spawn at another players camp....
---
Just watched it I line on PAX east...It's the name of the Fall update 
---
Heck yeah.
---
Anyone remember the Gunners?
---
Ah ok
---
I mean, it'll barely cost him more than your bounty to repair it... Tbf it doesn't matter. 
---
Honestly just a player who feels like we should get compensation (at least in game) for being pro bono beta testers. Hell, Rockstar gives players gold bars for testing their online Beta - if Bethesda is going to take notes from Rockstar releasing a Beta game mode on a full game, they should also take notes and give us some atoms for our trouble. 
---
It's because of the drop rate nerf on 3 star legendaries, but uranium fever was never buffed, only 3 star legendaries in other events like one violent night and the 3 stars out in the world will give 3 star rewards
---
It happens sometimes when you log in or Fast Travel, randomly.
---
It's been there since launch, so... yeah. Very efficient.
---
atleast its random
---
Because you killed a level 7. They are obviously disgusted by your lack of standards. 
---
Server hop for nuke zones at whitesprings.
---
Or just whitesprings in general. And look into any foods that grant XP bonuses. I think some cobblers do. It's nothing crazy...only about 5% extra but every little bit helps. 
---
True... haha.
---
Thanks
---
A rusty concept. 
---
Level 29, got a sweet snub nose revver and a hazmat suit. Can I come?
---
Most fun fallout since 2
---
Survival gives 20% xp bonus play on that with a few of the +xp% consumables then sleep for another bonus then head to whitesprings and you will probably level pretty fast. Just be cautious while in survival
---
Same, though i lost my original account that was lvl 283 to the ‚Äùxbox doomsday‚Äù. Now i‚Äôm almost 140, but levels don‚Äôt really matter after 50. I understand that the game gets pretty boring if you are not into the legendary farming, since the quests etc. Are pretty limited in the long run and the events get old pretty quickly too. 
---
Server stability has certainly increased through the updates, and to be true, it was pretty bad at launch. The new/old bugs etc. every new update brings are always a bit of a hassle, but also pretty expected at this point too, since it has happened every time. 
---
The dlc should stay free, keeps player base from dividing, and the atom shop is okay too, since you can get the atoms pretty easily without paying. 
---
Have you found the Alien Blaster? Check some YouTube videos. I have the keys and the blaster but cannot remember what I had to do to get them. I do know where the blaster is if you need help finding it. 
---
I stopped calling them because I never got anything beyond rarer attachments on normal guns that I no longer need. 
---
I think I have like 40 now.
---
I'm also slightly high, so... bonus?
---
Also:   Your Bethesda account was set up separately, right?  Any way to approach Bethesda about relinking?
---
Xbox?
---
atom shot paints and skins lock the items in your inv. they wont even show up in trade
---
Well I mean like the nuke silos are way easier with 4 people running around and doing all that crap you gotta do to get to the nuke launcher. But a solo player can totally do that so long as they're pretty decently leveled with good weapons and they don't drop the ball on anything.
---
So yeah if the vault raids are anything like the nuke silos (which I think they totally are going to be) then solo players wioll be fine.
---
But I'd also like to think they could be like the Fasnacht event where just four randos show up an work together toward a common goal, which was actually the most fun I think I've ever had I 76. (At least the first 4 or 5 times.)
---
That one seems capped at like 25.
---
Not true. Power armor wearing raiders exist in fallout lore, they‚Äôre called The Enclave. 
---
When this actually happens, feel free to post again
---
Actually what I thought you meant, is players need to confirm they gun they own is not a dupe and need to roll their weapons to prove they originals if they want to use them in survival ..
---
A wife or husband is all well and good until it bugs and attacks you , or its model is randomly replaced with a snallyghaster,  or it keeps wandering off a cliff or its pvp able and every day or so bored players come by your camp go yeet yeet , shoot them then dance on the corpse ....in second thought place me down for a companion too :) 
---
I‚Äôm on so it‚Äôs open 
---
There are dozens of us! I bought the original PC version in '97 at a game store because I thought the box looked cool. Been hooked ever since. ü§ô
---
I like the idea but having to do the main quest over and over again is gonna get old fast
---
Can you put it on semi- auto? Or are you specialized for full auto rifles?
---
I'm sorry but 3 years and a game is pretty much dead as far as the majority of the audience is concerned. Pointing to one companies failures as an excuse for another companies failures just goes to show that the game industry needs to get it's shit together. CEOs need to stop going into good game companies, pumping their loyal fan base for all they are worth, and then leaving the company in tatters afterwards. 
---
I wish that spawnkilling feature would be removed.
---
lol
---
I LOVE your neon lettering work, it's so precise! Holy crap, man! Are you on Xbox by chance?
---
I collect them now, have like 150+
---
I'll be on tonight, send me a friend request and I'll hook you up with some better gear. I dont have any legendary stuff for lower levels, I give it all away, but I can make most armors and weapons. IGN=The_zimmers 
---
It took me ages haha. Your CAMP is amazing. You have some serious skill my friend. I'm on PS4 I'm afraid 
---
That's honestly a neat premise for a modded server.
---
Check the map lol
---
Wanna discuss now?
---
I had it happen once tonight on uranium fever
---
You might want to give it a go sooner rather than later then, there is really not many nasty bugs left. I'd go so far as to say less than most, if not all, of the other FO titles to this day. 
---
You'll want plenty of wood until you get around to making a "permanent" base. Possibly steel and concrete, as well, depending on what you build the foundations/walls out of. Once you build your base, you can limit your hoarding of wood. You may be finding a lot of ammo right now, but once you get automatic receivers of any kind, you'll need steel and lead to make ammo. I usually limit the amount I keep on hand to 1k-1.5k of these two.
---
There are also junk items that sell straight out, no bulking necessary. Go here:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_junk\_items](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_junk_items)  and sort by base value. This'll tell you what has base value.  
---
Of the junk with value, I usually keep:
---
Ultracite scrap: all I find
---
Ballistic Fiber scrap: all I find
---
Crystal Shards: 50 (unless you use energy weapons, I think you need this for energy ammo)
---
Fiber Optics: 50
---
Nuclear Waste: all I find
---
Gold scrap: 50-75 (it's useful to make linings for Vault Suit underarmor)
---
Fiberglass Spool: 50
---
Silver Scrap: 50
---
Raw Asbestos: 0-50 (this is useful for lead lining armor, but I always do Deep Pockets for carry capacity instead)
---
Circuits: 50 (unless you use energy weapons, you'll need it to make/repair them)
---
Black Titanium Scrap: all I find (you'll need this to build/upgrade/repair Excavator Power Armor)
---
Waste Antiseptic: 50 (useful to make Antibiotics and possibly Stimpaks, but I find enough of them)
---
Loose Screws: upwards of 200-250
---
Of the junk that must be bulked to sell, I keep:
---
Wood Scrap: about 500 after building my base (you use this to cook as well as build)
---
Steel Scrap: 1-1.5K (for ammo)
---
Lead Scrap: 1-1.5K (for ammo)
---
Molded Plastic: all I find (used for shotgun shells as well as bulking junk)
---
Loose Springs: 200-250
---
Loose Gears: 200-250
---
Excess Adhesive: 100-150 (I have an adhesive farm, so making and bulking this is a decent amount of profit)
---
Concrete Scrap: 100-150 (after building my base, this is used to build concrete foundations and brick walls, and to repair brick walls)
---
Aluminum Scrap: 200-250 (used to build/repair weapons)
---
Waste Acid: all I find (this is used to smelt ore)
---
Everything else I keep about 50 of, just in case, and bulk and sell the rest.
---
Once you get further in the game, and pick your weapon specialties, you'll of course refine this further. I'm all ballistic, so I don't use anything for energy weapons/ammo.
---
It's an entirely different critter. A lot of really fast little hits. I actually really like mine when it's at 200% durability. Literally I can just let ghouls come at me and they pile up around my feet without touching me.
---
Serendipity and dodgy won't buy you nearly as much time because the hits are so fast. I don't like bloodied builds, but my AA buzzblade is murder on a stick. Literally. Even against scorchbeasts.
---
Vertibot farm
---
Not sure what you mean - it should be permanent, if you bought it.
---
I didn‚Äôt buy it, but ended up with it anyway!
---
RNG. I usually get 3* from the legendary bosses in the event but just as often get 1* and 2* or none at all. 
---
Not really. Because they fight among themselves and each others. They don't have access to high tech facilities.  Their PA is perfectly representative of their situation.  A bunch of junkies trying to scrap together armor in a backyard garage.
---
I mean I don't really see how salvaging 60 clipboards can make X-01 armor.  
---
But that rusted pipe frame raider? yeah.  I can.  lol.  I love raider armor and wish it had more love.
---
So it's working now? Because I killed like 50 legendaries when survival launched and got no progress
---
People have been saying this for years, that lore wise power armor should be near impervious to small arms fire. 
---
Near impervious. 
---
No way paladin buzz lightyear would be taken down by one lucky shot, but throw several hundred rounds and thats still a lot of kinetic energy. Some would clip the Kevlar weave suit liner, a single round may not penetrate the visor but it will shatter it and render the pilot blind, chew up the delicate hydraulics and actuators behind the knees and at the ankles. It's not outside of realism for a group of raiders with pipe weapons to out maneuver a cocky power armor jock and take them down. 
---
A single AP round from .308 or higher should pose a serious threat, as it'll blow through those plates 
---
AA buzzblade with reflects damage while blocking is also monstrous.
---
i also noticed a lot of people are using alt accounts or low level accounts to lock in the top three leaving the rest of the players unmarked. killed someone camping at the top of watoga and they put a 1k bounty on my head and sent me a message explaining their reason.
---
What system? Mainly asking for the other readers. 
---
Wow, thanks! It took me so long to build, too. You're talented as well, friend!
---
I use my AA buzzblade regularly. It's savage.
---
Be sure to make a fresh post any time that happens
---
use them to bait people into oppening them the player will become wanted killing the player usually results in a mixed amout of junk sometimes in the hundreds
---
Or talon company
---
Oh, wearing better armor is griefing too now?
---
Stop being a crybaby.
---
Are there other materials you get when owning this one?
---
I don't think I've ever had it work, but I chalked it up to the timing being really finicky due to latency.
---
Why would downvotes be incoming?
---
&gt; don't drop the ball on anything.
---
I was drunk off my ass the other night trying to think of something to make a video of, and decided to launch a nuke, and I literally just half-assed my way through it.
---
It's not even that hard haha. I think I died one time, and then fucked up once reading /typing in the launch codes and wasted a launch keycard but otherwise, even the silo isn't THAT hard.
---
Its reddit, and when this game first came out downvotes were as popular here as they were on r/politics
---
&gt; Players who regenerate their entire health after every shot out of nowhere.
---
That's due to having assn/sent set or assn/cav set. It's weird, you do full damage but then the game adds reduction after, so you see their health bar go low, as in it's all greyed out, then it instantly goes back to full.
---
&gt;Players not taking damage at all after a certain point (for example, that one guy who is on his knees but simply refuses to die even after you've unloaded a whole magazine on his head).
---
I've seen this too. I think it might be due to assn/sent + nerd rage and other DR making them literally immune to further damage. Wonderful balance isn't it?
---
&gt;Lag. Not just lag, but extreme lag. In a game in which people can move so fast, this isn't good at all.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Oh, let's not forget that people can still be *completely* invisible without using Stealth Boy thanks to a bug that was reported **at launch**.
---
No arguments there, seen both.
---
IDK man I gave up after a day because I couldn't even do the challenge lol.
---
Mole men don‚Äôt give ultracite shells so it‚Äôs crafting or nothing for some of us
---
Yeah, I am. I've got quantum x01 and cola t51.
---
You'd need to get a suit though. For t51, relogging on Watoga is good.
---
There's a frame spawn on top of the Highschool, one under the AMS tower, at the crashed Vertibird. There's one on top of the Civic center next to another crashed vertibird. The fourth is on the hospital iirc, If you face directly away from the vetibird on top of the civic center, it's the green building right there. The best way to get to the frame on the roof is, assuming Jetpack or Marupial, to follow that bridge on your right side that goes to the mono rail, get on top of the mono rail and follow it until it starts to end. You should see a frame on the hospital, near to elevator.
---
If you don't mind spending caps to FT, you can also check Firebase Alpha, Dropsite v9 and Forward Station Delta (all southeast of Watoga. Delta is very very close to prime, though.)
---
It starts at 20%, and with perks goes to 40% or 50% i think.
---
Yeah. That's the reason I went from r/fallout to here because they were the same. Then all those downvote fetishists came over here. They seem to be gone for the most part though.
---
Exactly. The only ones who should have better gear than those who fight kill and steal for a living should be the ones with the Intel advantage like the brother and enclave. They have pre war records to go "this place has a cache of plasma rifles" where raiders go "this place is defensible and ideal for staging raids" 
---
Honestly, I am curious about this. In on pc as well and rarely have any issues. What are the specs on the rig you use? Also, could it just be related to an unstable internet connection?
---
Literally not even trying to troubleshoot, just interested in what makes our experiences so different....
---
I cant wait for the decorstions update. I'm gona go to town haha 
---
Well, it depends on whether or not it can be re-placed.  The game often has issues with that.  But if they can, then yes, it's merely the cost of moving the CAMP object... and probably far less than what it cost Op to destroy it. üòÇ
---
Beta, more like an excuse to hurry out the door an untested piece of content.
---
So yet another system that is one open to trickery and exploits then. 
---
25k
---
I've uninstalled the game, as the only thing keeping me interested was Survival when it was announced. Now that I've seen how bad it is, I don't think I'll be coming back in the foreseeable future.
---
Still, I hope Bethesda manages to fix it so others can have fun.
---
What do you request fr this service? My camp is woefully bland and I'd like to add some spice to it and convert it into more of a player vendors camp(ie Garage door out front, light up signs, furnishings, etc.) I don't usually have enough time in my day to do it myself and I have a lot of improvements that could be made lol
---
What decoration update? And when is it happening ??
---
Full auto only my dude, well that and melee.
---
It took me so long to figure this out, thank you!
---
This is a great recap - thank you. My question is how do I get a legendary weapon drop from any of these? Is there a perk/card to improve my odds? I've killed tons of legendaries - usually I get nothing; sometimes something weird or worthless like a boxing glove with +15% damage on bots; very, very rarely (once and I'm lvl 64) I got a weapon that was legit (All Rise). I've resorted to trading/buying instead. 
---
Thanks again for the detailed post. 
---
That‚Äôs a neat find 
---
I got this one here if you'd like to buy, just shoot me an offer
---
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XakjRZFaZNShCJu_WhsDCiD5mu-xTNiJ/view?usp=drivesdk
---
Yea! I found this too! 
---
so it's not worth doing anymore
---
If you're fine with a non legendary version, there's one that spawns in the Abandoned Bog Town north of Watoga
---
Did you saw him fight some scorch with his albino friend? I keep getting this random encounter and each time I am unable to protect him.
---
"find sentinel armor set" lol. You know Sentinel is rare as hell though right? I've gone through thousands, maybe 10,000+ legendaries and only seen 2-3 sentinel pieces.
---
They should make explosive weapons use super rare/hard to craft explosive bullets, it'd balance the game out so much and make it feel like proper Fallout combat instead of Michael Bay Fallout
---
Pretty much not. Also someone downvoted me so can you upvote :/
---
Oh I found it, thanks
---
Yeah, could be. But it doesn't regenerate HP instantly.
---
Nope, bounties carry over too. There was a thread earlier about how you can go into adventure mode and get a 10 cap bounty and go into survival, and when you die you lose only those 10 caps (instead of 1x your level in gold), essentially discounting your death prize by more than 90%.
---
It's not like they can do anything to you in adventure now. You and your camp are 100% immune to all player damage unless you fire back at them with pacifist mode turned off.
---
In the current environment I think it‚Äôs the only way to play (new character).  No way am I bringing my lvl 150 into this mode with how glitched and unbalanced the gear and weapons are.  Losing 300 caps a kill would suck and you automatically have a target on your back.  Lvl 5?  Lvl 10?  There‚Äôs no risk.  You die, so what?  
---
I was struggling with this as well until I tried your suggestion, stood right next to the tree with the pathway around it and it finally worked 
---
There are conceivable circumstances where that could happen, so... yes.
---
If they based legendary rerolling on micro transactions I would delete every Bethesda game off my PC, even my ultra modded Fallout 4 and burn every physical copy of a BGS game I have. 
---
I took my GF back after she cheated on me, but micro transactions to reroll legendaries is a step too far.
---
I'm on xbox I have around 100 -150 but never get much from them
---
In many ways, I thought Fallout 4 was a better Borderlands, if only because it was actually fun to play in single player, whereas single player Borderlands is... yeeeah.  So, you can imagine why I think 76 goes even further, because it added the online co-op element 4 didn't.
---
I still think Borderlands 3 will be fun.  It's just that I don't expect Gearbox to make it particularly great in single player.
---
I love playing solo but you're right if it's something like fasnacht it could be awesome! I've played the sh*t out of the veteran dungeons in eso, had many fun times but most of the time I was pissed cause the damage dealer didn't applied damage or the medic joint them by dealing damage... the problems I see, there are no real roles like DD/medic/tank we've only the  DD medic tank x 4. And some people with a bloodied build. Think about a tank that has no chance to move cause sentinal. Every one is dead and he is standing their, crying.
---
When there are really roles and every one get the same rewards then I think it could be awesome. 
---
I would just hate it when you get a demigod on you team and you only sprinting though the dungeon so fast how possible to get to the end. 
---
Had a person yesterday talking about dragging hordes of mobs to peoples bases. Griefers will always find a way.
---
Cheating can be duplicating items that make the game economy and even gameplay unbalanced.
---
Usually it's just people exploiting glitches in the game due to Beth's tendency to have LOTS of bugs, especially at launch.
---
Yep ran into them several times, wish there was a live one, cause I would love to buy things form a deathclaw. I mean what would they sell? Likely unique bone weapons and armor. 
---
Blocking in 76 is horrendously laggy. You need to lead the hit by 1-5 seconds depending on the lag at that given moment. It's bad in PvE, but it's worse in PvP.
---
What exactly was supposed to be the point of Nukashine? You scrap an extremely valuable Nuka Cola Quantum to get a mildly beneficial drink that... amongst other underwhelming benefits gives you a boost in your unarmed combat (because that's a thing that happens to all of us). The one unintended benefit might be that if you were in really deep shit you could use it as a fast travel alternative. But even still, for all the resources this thing sucks up I'd just assume keep the Quantum. 
---
i would use the M202 flash.. ONLY if it has access to the targeting computer, best missile launcher mod IMO
---
Will be on in 15 minutes
---
There's a quest up at the water park to track down a missing child: as you explore keep your eyes open for a Miss Nanny robot, she starts the quest.
---
"You hear" a lot of stuff that I've never seen or heard of happening to anyone that I know. There are a LOT of crybabies on the forums that will gladly make shit up to further their misplaced agenda.
---
Maybe burst it then, or go full Rambo lmao
---
So the opening of a pvp mode is not a good time to discuss those who pvp in the old mode?
---
I think it goes in the way with the vendor machines. So you get still money even if you're off. 
---
The struggle of not being able to sit down and drink a nuka cola is real.
---
Don't see why it wouldn't, would likely have to buy from a vendor though. 
---
So cheesy... 
---
If Bethesda can do one thing right, it's saving a game that had a bad launch. 
---
Yeah, just don't use Strange In Numbers - that breaks it and makes you do less damage.
---
Bladed commie whacker
---
I like it too. It feels like you really destroyed something.
---
Eh, could go the ‚Äúgourmet‚Äù route. Tuxedo, that maiden of mysteries mask, walking cane and a pistol.  
---
Only get food by using cannibal and get the perk that lets you drink blood packs for thirst.
---
Classy power armor... maybe T-60 no paint?
---
Spotted that one also. Not sure but I think it was at the Red Rocket in the ash heap. And he fought mole miners.
---
This. Did a ton of WS farming, nothing has changed.
---
Usually I can get the first hit blocked because for some reason nobody ever blocks or expects other people to. The weed whacker ate right through that shit. 
---
Yep. It's just so different. Everyone uses fists and claws, and here comes the sewing machine lol.
---
How are they "doubling down" on Survival? You mean by supporting it and not immediately dropping it? Adventure will get the same support that Survival gets. 
---
Explosive just makes it more likely that you'll hit your target, thus causing a stagger, which means free hits and sentinel gets broken, which = instant death. Two Shot hasn't been ideal for a long time.
---
Yeah man im keen, xbox name is the same on here. Ill add u tonight aye?, what times that is WA, 11am?
---
Hope u got a stage to jam on
---
Actually im wrong my xbox tag is nashy96
---
By adding seasons to it. I see no mention of adventure seasons or other similar, exclusive content.
---
Not sure but maybe Mayor for a Day. There's several quests in Watoga. 
---
After joining an event, you can go to your pipboy and reject the event. This makes the participants vulnerable. There was an earlier post saying to keep an eye on people who join an event then pause and go to their pipboy. They're probably rejecting the event to murder you all.
---
April. You will be able to display thing in display cabinets etc. I can't remember he full details but it's on their roadmap
---
https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.vg247.com/2019/02/22/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-release-date-2019-roadmap/amp/
---
Why would you want seasons in Adventure? That would be awful! Adventure isn't ultra-competitive and PVP focused so there's no reason for everyone's characters to get wiped out and be on an even playing field. 
---
OP needs to check their sodium intake
---
Platform? 
---
Didn‚Äôt know about that one ty
---
PS4
---
don't see why not
---
TSEs arent even that great, and also...maybe a crit headshot with a double barrel , ya know, isnt the most accurate weapon.
---
Oh you enjoy not getting the legendaries, sorry thought you had an iq above 40 but clearly you don't. Begone now
---
Time to hunt down Todd Howard. If you see this, im coming for you!!!!
---
I have completed the quest as well. Was wearing the veil, but put on a Faschnacht Mask during the parade. The veil disappeared. Nothing in my inventory. I would like to return to the lair to help a friend complete the quest.
---
I don't, hence the 'other similar, exclusive content' tidbit. However, nothing about seasons needs to imply ultra competition. Diablo 3 has seasons and it doesn't ven have a pvp mode. Survival already has exclusive gear, now this? That development time should be spent improving the game for all players, the vast majority of which are pve adventure mode players - and the people who have kept the game going.
---
Gun mods?
---
Thx, will do
---
No they are the same
---
The Enclave weren't Raiders.  A Raider's motive is to kill you and take your things.  The Enclave don't care what you have, if you're a mutant or non pure blood, they just kill you.
---
Not sold by vendors anymore. 
---
Can find them in the wild at armor mod plan spawns.  I found the deep pocketed Torso mod plan in the church at Harpers Ferry. 
---
The condition also matters. Repair them both and see which one has the better condition, then sell the loser.
---
You kinda come across as a dick and that's  probably where the downvotes are coming from... but I agree with you. 890 seems far-fetched and one shots do seem impossible currently. Haven't came across a bloodied build yet that has withstood the gamma gun, even at long range.
---
The problem the less damage one is 50% crit damage and 15% faster crit bar
---
Private servers and mod support are on their schedule.
---
The ONLY announcement that matters.  The instant fix to the game imo.
---
Online now for a few hours 
---
At level 7 in survival they won't have caps for long, I would have done the same thing.
---
On survival, that's cool. On Adventure, dick move, bro. Dick move.
---
I am also that reason. 
---
If your on ps4 and dont mind waiting I can do arms chest and idk about legs but I can check I'll be on Monday afternoon and I'll do them free as long as you provide the mats
---
Did Todd apologize for all the lies at all?
---
Xbox 
---
A few spots. A deal civil war guy usually has some type of civil war plans. I found mine to the left of the overseers camp. 
---
Fact of the matter is Survival is still in Beta, they don't even know if it's going to be game mode with any sort of longevity. It's also a game mode that I haven't seen many people requesting or advocating for. The pvp focused griefers have mostly moved on and Bethesda should let them go. Still, I have read negative comments about the mode nonstop, have yet to read anything positive. I just dont understand why they would spend so much time developing systems to segregate players instead of making team play better, updating the UI, balancing gear, fixing bugs, making loot and storage more scalable, etc.
---
They both engage in wanton slaughter. One wears power armor, the other doesn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm sure the Enclave engage in the theft of property, how else do they acquire all of the technology that they have? Yeesh go back and play Fallout 1 and 2.
---
Thanks, I am on PC but ty for the offer.
---
All good gl man
---
All great points made. I was trying to remember and I think that on my first run through, I camped the WV Logging Company (furthest top left) from like level 20 into the mid 30s. Was running with pipe weapons then, so anything i pulled off of the mutants was scrapped and used to repair my weapons. They would occasionally drop ammo, but also gunpowder to make more ammo. Might just have to farm these guys repeatedly, given their large base experience.
---
well it would let me for like one of the legs, is it letting you for all the pieces?
---
I had it available for 1 piece,  not the whole suit. 
---
Of course they are...sigh...Survival was handled SO badly. If you don't have a full suit of Assassin/Sentinel and either a TSE automatic or shotgun, don't even bother. Someone who DOES will eventually find you and farm you for caps, and I am seven seeing people put that gear on low-level characters so they don't lose many caps on death, and can take out high-level people for huge gains who lose 300-400 caps each time. The only thing that seems to counter these dicks is a Bloodied build with Adrenal, Better Criticals, Eagle Eyes, Nerd Rage, very low health, Chameleon and a high damage bloodied rifle. And you NEED the bloodied weapon. Because of the IDIOTIC first-hit damage limiter Bethesda put in the latest patch, Bloodied VATS builds that used to be able to one-shot crit counter the gear-to-win crowd and kept them in check won't work any more. The damage just isn't high enough without the extra boost the Bloodied weapon gives you, otherwise you will VATS through their Bullshit Armor, do maybe 2/3 damage, and the idiot will just stim and pepper you with explosive spam. IF you have Bloodied gun and all the other cards and a crit saved up you can overwhelm the damage filter and kill them. A stagger-based build with an explosive shotgun can get the job done, too if you can get close enough. But aside from those 3 builds that require specialist rare gear, you are fucked. Don't try it. And Asshole/Sentinel has the advantage and will win most of the time. This gated out 90% of the player base and 99% of the weapons being viable, and was beyond stupid.
---
Ya know, that is why I grabbed video and also screenshot, cause I'm fairly tired of hearing people say this.
---
Also, you missed the point of the post.
---
Well pompy I believe is indeed going to be the scout leader for the quests according to the game files!
---
I had a bounty from destroying a whitesprings turret camp the other day and the ridiculous bounty sound would go off at least every minute. So annoying.
---
I think I'll be launching one tonight. "3 codes to go" if your on I'd be ok nuking there 
---
desdemona?
---
YES YOUR A GODSEND! And you mean you have 3 key cards left?
---
You have to clear the scorched from inside the civic center.
---
Plasma cores can be cheap to manufacture if you can source the nuclear material
---
The whole ban thing? You mean the ban s that were finally given out to the dupers and cheaters? Redundant, I know....
---
Sorry, no place for that at all on a multiplayer game. They knew it, they flaunted it and they thought Bethesda wouldn't do anything.  They were wrong. 
---
Code fragments. I have the key card. I wanna do it right and not look online for the launch code.
---
Oh I thought you meant the gnome. Paint stayed I guess. Will have another check in the morning. But there was a weird hour sale for a gnome, bought it, can‚Äôt find it in the camp thing 
---
They're isn't a new adventure mode server.  There's a new survival mode server. 
---
Ah God damn it I dont know how to decode and what site are you going to that makes you have 3 key fragments?
---
I feel like raiders aren't that smart, so they'd likely use it for awhile, and not be able to completely repair it like normal players can. So in the end they'd have one or two operational pieces, but I'd expect a raider to kind of ruin it by adding different types of repairs, very similar to actual raider power armor. 
---
cool gun but i looking for 1-2 effects that boost damage. suppressors western is vendor trash. 
---
I didn't.. camping spawn points is TRASH. BUT. I have a 2 star non explosive auto handmade, and i can wear garbage armor and you still couldn't kill me... know why? I spent a month preparing a separate PVP character/build.. reaching,  testing, and min/maxing... bringing a general pve character over will not cut it. 
---
Why can't you? 
---
I stumbled across this I got so excited looks like it should be a fun quest line
---
In my haste I forgot the Coke.....
---
Cause it's boring without a friend 
---
I had this last night on ps4, what I discovered was it occurred when I'd jump to select the first power connector. If I was high enough to be standing still when selecting the same it'd work fine and I'd be able to connect it to the nest conduit without the unwanted jump occurring. This has always been a bit finicky when jumping and selecting for power but it seems worse at the moment. 
---
Ya, that happened on my first solo nuke. I even decoded the password irl. Ran the silo. Dropped the nuke. Ft to the zone. Ran in hammer raised.
---
Then hard crash as I killed the first glowing one. 
---
But have you even really played fo76 until your nuked server crashes, amiright? 
---
Yeah, totally! I‚Äôm waiting for the next DLC now :)
---
If the servers had more people it would have been awesome 
---
I bought the game and am open to experiencing the good and bad aspects of it. So far I have had a lot of fun. Right now I'm just trying out Survival mode to see what it's all about. I am enjoying it for what it is, the game tracks other stats so it's not just all about who has survivdd the longest.
---
whenever i launch a nuke at whitesprings i keep the radius covering the station so no one can respawn there
---
I just had a look in the store, it is on sale
---
Something tells me those raider boys and girls in Nuka world could get that rig "operational." Cuz they r the Operators afterall...
---
As I understand it you need all 8 pieces to get the launch code. I currently have 5.
---
Yep, I'm always wearing assault gas mask and traveling leather coat to hide my full sentinel assassin set underneath lol. 
---
Ah why you got to make it harder lol it's fine but hit me up once your going to launch the nuke
---
How about a smart raider then?
---
Seriously. Raiders are dumb enough to use bit of junk they found laying around too make armor instead of finding a perfectly good usable suit of armour, witch your character finds in fallout 4 in a matter of minutes after leaving the vault, quest or not.
---
Even the raiders of nuka world can use gear that is from higher quality, and the player as raider overboss can as well. Don't see why it has to be different here.
---
Enclave has always been the "baddest bad guys."
---
I personally haven't noticed a correlation between luck and more legendary enemies, but luck certainly improves the durability/condition bar of an item, dramatically if you're running around at low health with a few unyielding pieces on.
---
I think the atoms are fairly priced. The Atom prices items are not
---
Yeah. You were probably going to be killed either way. So definitely a win.
---
My first one, kinda wanna do it right. And I will. Leahm_Grove PSN add me so I can send you an invite when I'm ready to launch.
---
Cause they aren't actual fallout fans
---
Yep
---
Also up to trade if anyone has a spare T51-B left arm that's the last part I need thanks lol
---
Crap. I see where I kinda jacked up that wording. Lol. Super sledges can be equipped at any time. The gauntlets can only be equipped outside of power armor.
---
Cash registers don't reset, the one in White springs' crafting room is always full of random crap.
---
I guess you have a point, but I'm thinking a lot of the work done in Nuka world was done by Fritsch.  Also I feel like the Operators were more concerned with making caps than being repair men. 
---
Well look at it from the super mutants point of view. You definitely would look like a raider of their goods, even if they're "bad." Or raiding the raiders. Are raiders that only raid other raiders not considered raiders? Wait I forgot where I was going with this...
---
Tell me this is real lmao 
---
No.
---
Wow imagine how contested the workshops would of been if they never did add camps
---
I wish we could create screws or springs from Steel if we can't at least recover them from guns or armor even with the Scrapper perk.
---
Nope responders
---
Vaults opening will be part of Nuclear Winter.
---
Better yet, slap on some REAL armor.
---
/r/rorikroll
---
A man of culture I see.
---
honestly when I did play... I found one... one single piece in 75 hours of playing.
---
Really. A separate character? So, what armor do you have? What mutations do you have? How did you get any of those items?
---
I'll even go as far as saying go ahead and screenshot your inventory, effects, perks, hours played and everything else. Ill do the same and share here or someplace else, then I'll be more than happy to PVP against you if you want to prove your entire build is on the up and up.
---
Bit late to the party, but thank you for this. I'm currently building a 'Predator' type character with mutations, starched genes, and class freak, and this is a great help.
---
Your point is absolutely valid. They wanted the money, Pack wanted to "party," and the psychos just wanted to kill. 
---
If i remember correctly, the Operators were pretty tech savy (for the tech they could get their hands on/build). 
---
u know what i mean
---
Patch notes stated that players would have so much time before they could take damage after spawning/fast traveling.... But I see no evidence of this, I checked out the new game mode and instantly lost about 3k of caps and it took about 40 out of 50 stimpaks off me.
---
Evidence of people using 1 shot weapons, with armour that can't be put down....
---
PVP is really bad at the moment, prob's why they decided to call it a BETA, they don't have to deal with complaints that way.. 
---
yep, the enclave is organised, has political motives and is actually a remnant of the US government, raiders are just a loosely associated group of local criminals working together one way or another
---
thanks
---
I think the players should be the ones testing the game instead of employees.  why because employees care bout quotas and players care about having fun.
---
Why?
---
still confused how this works
---
This is very good news. Thank you for the very to the point post.
---
The ambient sounds in this game are making me go insane. 
---
I had been hearing owl hooting noises and general ambient noise like cicadas and frogs in the distance.
---
Except I wasn't hearing that from in-game there were three owls outside my house having some kinda territory dispute.
---
I live in Maryland so the ambient noises in this game are *exactly* the kinda sounds you hear around here. Honestly, I wouldn't have noticed if the owls hadn't started fighting practically outside my door because I **have** heard owls hooting in the game and its spot on.
---
Tldr they nailed the ambient nature and critter sounds in this
---
No, get the Grounded mutation or use leather armour
---
I‚Äôll never understand why people are so sensitive to truth. Someone tell me with a straight face that it‚Äôs ok to trust what Todd‚Äôs Howard said free being caught boldly lying about this game already?
---
Love the game, just can't find anyone to play it with my age.
---
This is all great and completely addresses all of the areas I‚Äôve had problems with as well! Great suggestions :)
---
Really? Because I can already make Fusion Cores at the chemistry station which are far beyond our current level of energy technology.
---
Ok, how about the tinker's station then, where I can already make fusion cells, gamma rounds, plasma cartridges and grenades. Would that be more believable then? :P
---
I ran through watoga yesterday in one session and found 15 legendary robots.
---
What hats? Did someone say something about hats? 
---
I always felt there was a lack of legendary enemies. I think thats why everyone ran whitesprings and still does. I have noticed that almost every legendary enemy i see in the wild runs away now especially super mutants. Its ridiculous.
---
that would be a sad, but ok ending for him cept we know he made it to a vault.
---
The rust devils would like to have a word. There's a difference between craftsmanship and intelligence. Real world example, building construction in developing countries, they're using whatever "tools" they can get their hands on. 
---
Smart raiders are a rarity, but very present. The forged boss was using t45, the gunners in Quincy using the armor that sturges fixed up. 
---
It's like a lottery really. Except you don't "buy" your tickets. 
---
You just stumble upon it in your in game adventure. I build about 5-6 a day. All on different servers. 
---
There is a little message inside for those who find it. 
---
I got the Wasteland walker bundle and am very happy with the way it looks. 
---
But I would hold off on the Woodland Warrior Unless those atoms are burning a hole through your vault suit. I think it will be bundled or discounted at a later date. That being said you can paint almost a full set of T 45 with it, even if you haven‚Äôt bought it. That should be enough of a preview to see if you want to spend the money on owning it for all the T models or not
---
Yeah I always forget about Watoga, but that is about the only place other than whitepsring with no nuke that is consistent anymore. 
---
Giving out gifts in 76 is a blast for anyone who grinds and ends up with excess :D Most of the stuff I give away isn't too great, but I do frequent Flatwoods and saunter over to the Overseer's Chest to drop off loads of plans and the occasional lvl 5 or 10 piece of legendary armor or weaponry, which naturally I've upgraded to the nines! I'll also chuck useful junk items, some spare chems, and all manner of clothing/hats I've accumulated in my travels. I do my best to flag the nearest new player over and take a look. 
---
I never know when any of them are alts to high level players and can use it, but what's great about containers is they'll persist and maybe the next person who comes across it can use something!
---
Which my advice to you, from a "Generous Stranger", the best gift you can give back to us is to do the same thing to some other random player. In other words, "pay it forward" is all we ask \^\_\^
---
oh ok thats the part i wasnt understanding there are multiples on different servers ok i was like theres no way i get put in this guys server so whats the point lol
---
Less damage that you would normally do with the mutation, or least than 100% of your normal damage?  I use strange in numbers ally the time so this is an important distinction for me - thanks for the info!
---
Doesn't even seem like bloodied one shots. I don't even have assassin sent armor but I can tank a few hits from friends with 1000+ damage (2-3 hits maybe even 4 depending on weapon). But everything is a 3-6 shot and most use explosive so I guess people still assume.
---
Raider left arm, robot chest, leather legs, and a marine right arm. Paired with an assaultron helmet and it looks rather rust devilish
---
Yeah I understand. 
---
Still kind of a new thing I'm doing, it's a bit of a work in progress. 
---
Yea. I find it great to server hop watoga killing robots with my bloodied crossbow, checking the vendors for legendaries, then server hop again.
---
I hate when they run away, it is so annoying. Legendaries have always been a bit hard to find, but there were always those few spots you could go to like white spring, Watoga, or west tek, to get spawns and now there‚Äôs even less than what there was before. 
---
That was their original intention.
---
I noticed it. Maybe the did it because of the weekly quest 
---
I will be done with pvp personally then, I am not gonna be playing 24 7 grinding for new gear every few weeks/months...having multiple characters...all to lose it..rinse and repeat. I am high level, and earned my spot..gear..perks etc etc, so I shouldnt have to apologize for being OP and kicking ass in the pvp servers, part of progression, or so I thought. Its not my fault or anyone elses that these low level/casual players cant hang and have shitty gear and need to be pacified. I am tired of hearing the constant whining and bitching from people on all forms of social media about getting their asses whooped in pvp, deal with it, and if you cant hang with the high lvl big boys in PvP, keep your asses in adventureure mode until you can hang.
---
it's cool im just lvl 301 have like 800 hours try to find things to keep me busy
---
You weren't griefed and there is no PvP mode
---
You can make it so workshop owners and their squadmates have a slower respawn time on their workshops when they are being claimed by attackers, then.
---
So you‚Äôre telling me we should be buying games to test them for the developers? What kind of backwards thinking? How do you have fun when you‚Äôre essentially doing someone‚Äôs job? Let‚Äôs just all buy incomplete games, let‚Äôs give these companies our money to test their incomplete games for them. Jesus. 
---
I'm level 77 and just found my first beer hat. I'm saving it in my stash, in case I need it at a party.
---
I am getting it for the full suit it seems.
---
The rust devils definitely are a good example. They have some intense robots. I guess I just think 76 should have more options like another commenter said. 
---
I run calibrated shocks, stealth boy, targeting hud, and optimized bracers on my T60. ‚ÄúOl Reliable‚Äù
---
Try searching in third person. That help me just now. 
---
CAMPs were NOT PART OF THE GAME!!!!!?????  jesus, that is all that is keeping me here!!  lol
---
As soon as they add the tier 1 equivalent of nuka world raider armor I will. Otherwise I'll do what a raider would do and use the loot I get? Most raiders issue with lasers/power armor is lack of know-how. We all came out of the same vault with potentially pre-war experience. Any vault 76 raiders would be more on par with nuka world raiders or the mechanist dlc raiders, not wasteland thump dicks. 
---
Just my 2 cents as a part-time raider (who wears a full set of trapper btw, though I could easily rationalize another RP)
---
It was an example of how it takes time to get things to a functioning state.  If you noticed I mentioned two games there.  With just a smattering of research you should discover it is true for almost all MMOs. The simple fact is they are incredibly complex and there are some issues that never become apparent until you start seeing it run on thousands of machines that do not have the same equipment inside. 
---
lmfao, yup, way to dodge a bullet there, Galahad.  
---
Oh shhesh... I just realized this op was 4 months ago...
---
Can do them on PC for a few hundred caps if you're interested. Also BoS material and the dense torso mod. Have an older character with nearly all the armor plans.
---
You keep commenting on the post instead of replying to individual comments, lol.  I did that twice earlier.
---
I‚Äôm with you now - the gnome is supposed to last forever once you buy it, and can be placed forever.
---
I mean you're not wrong that we make a lot of crazy stuff :) 
---
The only thing that trips me up about oil to plastic is the scale of machinery needed to separate oil into it's components and heat, extrude etc. I always imagined the physical construction of fallout stuff to be construction of smaller scale parts machined and bolted together, but I don't think you can make plastic out of oil without big industrial machinery. 
---
That being said I also wish we could do something more constructive with materials than just bulking it. Farming the Grafton monster generates.....a lot of oil lol 
---
How about the .ini files from My Documents? Have you, at any point, edited those?
---
I missed the live stream so sorry if this has been already discussed, but I noticed Chris Mayer said that he recommends you bring friends to the Vault Raids because they are pretty tough. Should we be taking that as they can be solo'd? If so that's pretty fucking cool. I don't always get to play with my friends, schedules and what not.
---
I am Co-Leader of a Raider clan that has blew up on PS4 recently and I‚Äôm happy to say yes we only use Sentinel and Cavalier armor that may be BOS or other mixed armor pieces of sorts (NO POWER ARMOR) and it‚Äôs not griefing.. just quit crying and stay in Pacifists!! üòà
---
Lol he must be new. 
---
Honestly, please. Pip-boy use is already real time and it'd be fun as shit as a gimmick
---
I didn't see any scorched but I also didn't look around too much since I was in a survival survivor. Would be sweet if he can be saved!
---
I dont know what their goal is. To reduce the number is stupid considering they already dont drop appropriate gear. Add that stupid fasnacht event into it and we are playing for impossible rewards. Not to mention the game can and has crashed and the game fails to save the loot you just picked up this is still a SBQ problem. My odds of winning the real lotto shouldnt be better than my odds of getting a 3 star item in a game.
---
Yeah. Concrete, copper, and junk iirc. 
---
On pc?  Have mods installed or adjusted your .ini settings?
---
Thats actually whats Ive been hearing thatsupposed to be in it.
---
Haha I figured if he could be found alive he would have to have some badass stuff. I wondered if it was a reference to intelligent deathclaws from the older fallouts, although I'm pretty timeline wise having an intelligent deathclaw in this game wouldn't make sense
---
Hahaha Gaaaary....
---
Nice, I was in the southwest area of the map, not quite inside the ashheap area but very close
---
They didn't say anything specific. But I'd assume they can be solo'd, like everything else in the game.
---
Thumbs up 2x.
---
Yep, I tested it many times moving it around, it depends on where your camp node is and it‚Äôs completely stupid. Just give us fast travel mats 
---
I bought the pc one month before 76 was released on nov 14th.  It has a gtx 1070 and I have fiber optic internet.  It is a gaming only pc.  It‚Äôs not the most insane rig, but it can run Dirt Rally 2.0 on ultra settings at 60 FPS with very few frame rate chugs.  I‚Äôm comparing apples to oranges, but this is a bit discouraging nonetheless.  
---
I upgraded to fiber optic internet to play 2D fighting games online (Skullgirls, Guilty Gear), and can play people all over North America with very little interference from lag.  Again, I‚Äôm comparing apples to oranges, but this is also discouraging. 
---
I‚Äôm not bashing the game, I‚Äôm just sad over my experience.  If you aren‚Äôt having the issues I am having, please consider yourself lucky and enjoy the hell out of the game.  There‚Äôs good in the game, but many don‚Äôt get to see it
---
Initially they wanted to make Workshops very much contested, but the idea was later dropped. This was in line with Todd and part of the team wanting a much harder PvP experience in the game, but the team decided against it later.
---
I saw a raider in full scribe scientist. Didn't really make sense.
---
It definitely caught me off guard lol
---
I'm sure with bloodied, rifleman perks (even just the 3 x 10%), gunslinger perks (even the 3 x 10%), sneak dmg, it will already be overkill, I'm sure you'll be able to kill anything 1 shot. Anymore perks and it will be overkill
---
Definitely one of the more subtle surprises
---
It's definitely your mods and tweaked ini files.
---
yeah, about 11 am for you, and I can get a stage up and running real easy. 
---
PC, Never installed mods or adjusted .ini settings.
---
Never once edited those.
---
What are some perks for non-automatic rifles that I could equip that would help me kill some enemies from  far along with the perk chart that you made for me?
---
Yeah, they are making it to where the end game things like launching nukes on the SBQ are pointless because the rewards you get from it aren‚Äôt worth it 95% of the time. 
---
Why are you in Survival Mode at LEVEL 5?
---
Ive been getting disconnected alot more and the popup or fill in for areas is horrible now. Its 20-30 seconds for things to just appear in many areas and they arent even fully rendered in great detail. That takes another 20 seconds and im on PS4. I cant even imagine running this on pc and having to find the right settings and it still not work.
---
I said it in the description
---
I like the idea of some kind of door bell. 
---
Couldn't they have used an emote today?
---
Trying to trade with someone last night and we had 5 or 6 crashes between the 2 of us. Maybe having new survival servers is making things difficult
---
After looking things over, this is my attempt. If you want a full Demolition Expert then you could always take away one point from Batteries Included, Power User, or a perk point in another SPECIAL stat.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff34e23&amp;d=s01c72su2sd1so1sp1st1sy1pc2pd1pk1pp2pr2pl1id2eh2ih1ig1s12as1li2ib3&amp;w=at1lm2&amp;n=War%20Machine
---
Hahahahaha. 
---
It shouldn't be as I've never installed mods or tweaked ini files, should I attempt to delete them and reinstall the game again anyway?
---
Swap the commando perks for rifleman and use concentrated fire instead of ground pounder.  Those are honestly the two biggest differences between the two types of builds. 
---
Funny because I don't use a TSE and I maul people. With a sniper.
---
Reported for reporting. 
---
Maybe try contacting the support?
---
Oh okay so I would easily be able to switch between them
---
Once you have the cards, yeah. Honestly, it wasn't until now that I realized how versatile that combo can be. 
---
I'd recommend that. Definitely delete your ini files. Try a scan and repair after that, if that doesn't work, reinstall.
---
Banker doesn't exist in fo76......
---
Or they called it a BETA to get the complaints and adjust? What do you think the whole point of a BETA is? It‚Äôs to let a mass amount of people play a game, break it, report what‚Äôs broken and then adjust it before final ‚Äúfull‚Äù release. 
---
Okay thanks I guess I‚Äôll use them in a combo then
---
They need to make this door. I'm tired of hiding my speak easy behind some bookshelves 
---
I've gotten so many  1* wooden legs from her that I can be a pirate
---
You are correct on both accounts, the rare times I die in my Sentinel Assassin set, I will be sitting there and waiting the timer out as they continue to light me up. You do not get staggered when downed. This means complete immunity. I have had my friend come to revive me even and get vengeance on the dude too.
---
That gives me a good idea. If you wear a full set of raider armor in adventure mode, you should flag hostile to all other players immediately and be able to damage them without them attacking back.  Thanks OP!
---
it was good until it started to not be good xd
---
Not raiders though.
---
Might have changed, my post is 120days old :p
---
Its Sentinel or cavalier paired with assassin. It is just how the other player sees the health bar, its glitchy.
---
degenerates
---
Still works.
---
Please yes. I know Johnny Cash music is expensive, but they already got the fucking beach boys' #1 hit. Even just some of Cash's lesser known songs would make me happy.
---
Raiders are a specific faction though with various sub-factions. They have different motives, different brain disorders, different methods.
---
Hell yeah, for once a GOOD glitch!
---
Point me to one. I read this subreddit all the time and nowadays I almost never see "trash posts". Almost all people who hate this game have abandoned it and those few who are critical/salty get downvoted to hell and so don't post.
---
You got any more of those to sell?  I am constantly coming across level 30+ enemies (I'm lvl 15) with level 10 weapons/armor.  Even in the safest of areas.  Have a few thousand caps and zero cores. :(
---
this must be the new hipster word, I keep seeing it everywhere the last few weeks.
---
Dude game changer üòÇ
---
Just as guilty are the ones whom are blinded by their rage and choose to feed the campers by spawning repeatedly.
---
Hands down agree 100%.
---
We can go hold the power plant and make them for free if you want. I‚Äôm online now
---
To be completely honest I'm more surprised that Todd actually plays the game.
---
This is definitely a cool idea!
---
I'm confused as well. Does the same thing to me
---
I've had bad luck with stability again. It was good for like a month but it's noticeably worse now. Lost a ton of junk and flux after loading into a nuke zone, dying before i could see character and then being dc'd before i can respawn. Really terrible experience and makes me not want to play. All the junk can be replaced but the time i spent farming can't and that time feels wasted 
---
Maybe the players telling the Devs what they want is more useful then employees telling the company what they should do? They say the customer is always right.
---
OK.  I'm evyAG :) will be online in 5.
---
My kinda play by play. üëäüèº Will read if you post again.
---
So many possibilities with this. Conjoined camps into an official settlement would make a fast-travel point with the name agreed upon the settlements dwellers. This would be pretty incredible on survival. Would basically work like a clan/guild system but with buildings. Can have up to 8 players max to join a said settlement to allow a bigger building radius with a higher budget (all added up by the number of players in said clan/guild) but removing your ability to use the C.A.M.P due to being in a settlement C.A.M.P. 
---
We can only dream.
---
Happened to me too
---
Appreciate that knowledge!
---
I was just pumped because it‚Äôs rarely ever that smooth for me. Felt like Rambo haha.
---
Is the consensus then that if you use strange in numbers you should hold off on this mutation, but if you don‚Äôt use SIN it is ok to get them mutation?  I use SIN all the time so It sounds like I should hold off on adrenal ...
---
&gt;Arktos is the red and black  building in the most recent load screens.
---
I thought that was the nuka plant. 
---
fbi open up
---
I want to appreciate Dr Ameola,I contracted HERPES in 2015, I was told by my doctor that there‚Äôs no possible cure for HERPES. I started taking my ARV‚Äôs, My CD4 was 77 and viral load was 112,450. I saw a testimonials of Dr. Ameola, also I saw a lot of testimonials about him on how he uses herbal medicine to cure HERPES. I contacted him and told him my problems, He sent to me a herbal medicine with prescription on how to be taking it and I took it for 14 days after then I went for check-up and I was cured. The medicine has NO SIDE EFFECT, there‚Äôs no special diet when taking the medicine. He also cures BV, UTI, HIGH/LOW BLOOD PRESSURE, HPV, ALS, HEPATITIS B, CANCER, WART, HIV, DIABETES and lots [more. You](https://more.You) can reach him on WhatsApp contact him via +14158551136
---
Yeah it's kinda funny how much stuff we can't loot. Like, there's no reason I wouldn't be able to pull steel off cars and stuff, too. 
---
Nice job! My CAMP is nearby your location at the top of those mountains, my view of Watoga is very similar to yours (just higher up the mountain)
---
not really otherwise it would allready be done by me I can mod the audio files but the I don't have the time to do that.
---
First thing I tried when I bought 76. I was sad
---
Hunters long coat, gas mask with goggles, army helmet. Think "No NCR yet, but what a Ranger would wear."
---
&gt; Private servers and mod support are on their schedule.
---
Okay, but any news on the infinitely more important "Rejoin last server" option? I'm willing to give y'all a *lot* of leeway, but there's really no excuse for this one.
---
Somebody is a salty boi. 
---
Don't blame them though. 
---
I don't care what level you are. This. This is what survival is all about. Good hunt man. Good hunt.
---
Silos are easier for me solo than they are in a group. Less robots, and I can take my time hacking the terminals and shutting off the turrets before going into each segment.
---
Played for 90 minutes tonight. Kicked off the server 3 times. Lost a total of 5 workshops. So frustrating. 
---
Yo I'm definitely down for this. GT is SexyKarl777
---
How about a way to reset your character level to 0, but you keep everything (things learned, guns, ammo etc).  
---
Or just a way to respec.
---
Only problem is the servers themselves. Remember, the servers have to track everything each person does. It really is, no pun intended, quite the load.
---
They are adding a Legendary Dweller system in Wild Appalachia.
---
Absolutely. Its not terribly far from my camp and loved reading about it. If I remember right he has a ton of unique models in there too. 100% a sneak peak at what's to come. 
---
Did you lose the loot you received? No? Just some junk you can always find elsewhere? I don't feel bad for you. Go scavenge more junk. 
---
No one:
---
Bethesda: YO GET DRUNK AND NAKED AND TAKE A PIC
---
Where do you guys find the plans for this stuff? 
---
They're adding CAMP protection to Adventure soon, remember. So that'll only happen in Survival.
---
Interesting. Personally I thought BL2 was a lot better than FO4. After level 70 in FO4 my game would lock up after every hour of play. Xbox1. 
---
BL2 never locked up on me once. Very stable game
---
It worked, thanks.
---
What does this do? 
---
They talked a little bit about this saying that performance wise the servers couldn't handle more than one camp in an area.
---
When you get drunk with Beth...
---
That explains why I always find a freaking camp there. Maybe I'll intentionally destroy one if I see one
---
I'd be salty (insert dinner joke here).
---
While i don't agree with it,its part of the game. Thats why i only carry enough to quick repair weapons and armour
---
Fuck Bethesda right in ass. Because of FO76 and their lies about the game I will never buy any of their titles again.
---
Mods supports are a bad news D:
---
Right! Added a new level of excitement for me. Shoot I died to a lvl39 yesterday üôÉ
---
I had transfered ammo to my buddy. It was duped but come in fuck that bud. 
---
Not fully revealed but it will let you reset your levels after level 50, but each time you reset, you get some special benefits.
---
This all sounded dreadfully lacking tbh, and I have 100 hours in the game. 
---
You mean the desert ranger armor? Maybe, seeing as how there was a small Marine presence in Appalachia, but it seems they were equipped with wetsuits and Marine armor instead of dusters.
---
Personally, I just want the assault marine helmet.
---
Appalachia belongs to the Brotherhood!
---
Um...why? What was lacking in this?
---
First I heard of that. What exactly is that?
---
Fuck Bethesda right in ass. Because of FO76 I will never buy any of their titles again, It's so fucking bad and riddled with bugs, I fucking hate it.
---
You speak the truth! I've been preparing since launch for pvp. All of my perks are damage or defence oriented. I have what people consider to be best in slot everything for my build. It's funny to me how these people who want no legendaries, or fresh characters only, don't realize that people will always be luckier or have more time to optimize. 
---
The lost loot isn‚Äôt a big deal. It‚Äôs just the fact that some people are just dicks
---
I ran across a triangle doorbell at one location you could activate and it you make ding ding ding sounds.  I want that for my camp.
---
No, they are better giving it another 6 months. The game is far better than it was on release but it is still a long way off of being what I would consider a great game. It is a fun way to kill a few hours, but it really is a far cry from its full potential. 
---
Ranger combat armor 
---
That sucks because I was psyched for this weapon
---
I was out farming Mutations to the west of Watoga station yesterday, I caught a glint of a  lvl 62 3\* Glowing one, so I abandoned my post and went after it, only to see it being comically chased, like a Benny Hill skit, by 3 lvl 68 scorched, who promptly chased it away, Lucky I got a tag on it and I heard the ching of XP but couldn't find it. 
---
Hum? Not too familar with thoses...
---
Known bug since launch.
---
Don't walk while picking your spot. 
---
They were quirky and fun the first few days..
---
Welcome to the post apocalypse. Take it as a learning  lesson of what people are gonna do if the world collapses for real.
---
I laughed too hard at this.
---
Ef those 
---
what are wastelanders?
---
Someone should go check up on them.
---
I was thinking the same thing today when I was on a plastic run, all that wasted plastic!
---
Has to be at least a 1 star, not just legendary.
---
apparently if you kill enough of them, a Mr. Gutsy security force spawns, with a  lvl52 3\* leader.
---
Or in the outhouse.

Also what mask is that?
---
It's the name of the Third set of DLC, coming in Spring 2019.

Wierd...I got it for everything but the helmet.....?
---
I'll be bitter due to reddits obsession with downvoting shit.  Hope you die of cancer.
---
The sign for cancer kinda resembles a 69 so... nice.
---
Yeah enjoy 
---
I really wasn't into the whole CAMP thing until the I got a shit ton of plans from the Fasnacht Parade. My first few months playing I went from having a few workbenches and turrets to a tiny shack with a bed. Since the update I've added a brewing station and all the event decorations and my interest has taken off. Every day I'm looking for plans for rugs, instruments, etc. They really do know how to make the game better and keep people interested. It's safe to say if it wasn't for Wild Applachia I probably wouldn't be playing anymore and to know this is just the tip of the iceberg is super exciting.
---
Makes a mfer want to put on a red bandana and equip a compound bow so you can chant ‚ÄúWA-WA-WA-WA-WA-WA-WA-WA-WA-WA-WA-WA-WA!!!!!!‚Äù while arrow sniping through the bushes.
---
‚ÄúI‚ÄôM GONNA KILL ALL YOUR MEN!!!!!!‚Äù
---
Hey I now need the nuke to drop at whitespring instead 
---
You can switch it to most kills, most events completed, etc. 
---
Cool. I'm working on the last 3 pieces now 
---
Wait you mean we're not supposed to pay more than the first price if we move our camp subsequently?
---
It's been a real PITA in some places because of the many elements you can't remove after placing, which force you to move your whole camp to start over...
---
How? Killing officers right?
---
Yep. 2 to go
---
This is old but did you ever find the bright headlamp for the excavator?
---
There isn't more caps in the economy, just people who have PVP gear are able to take more of them from others.
---
Unless I missed some additional cap reward in survival, it just means you take more from people you kill.
---
Mercenary group from fallout 3, described by three dog as there being no job too dirty to handle. 
---
Sure 
---
I'm a sucker for cosmetics, but I've only purchased a one time $20 atom bundle because the prices just seem too high. Usually only nab myself things while they are on sale as it's the only time the price seems reasonable.
---
Probably deserved it if you duplicated items. 
---
You're just trying to dodge being an asshole. 
---
Hey, we're neighbours. My place is a little more west of yours, just on the other side of that transit arch support, on the cliffside, overlooking Watoga and Cranberry Bog.. got me a nice little pond as well.
---
Depends on what kind you mean. The standard gear used by Troopers is (allegedly) roughly based on British and Australian equipment from the second World War, so that wouldn't be that much of a stretch.
---
The normal Ranger armor (the "NCR Ranger patrol armor", not the Veteran suit) is described as being handmade in the NCR so it's probably a post-war design, and that would be right out. Which is a shame, cause it looked pretty awesome and I would have loved to see it again.
---
The Veteran Ranger gear (from the cover art, with the duster and full-face helmet) would be the easiest to bring back. It's just pre-war riot armor, though as we saw in New Vegas's DLC there were also versions used by the Marine Corps (Desert Ranger armor in Honest Hearts) and Army (Riot Gear in Lonesome Road). We've got a new type of Marine armor from Fallout 4 so I don't think they'd use that connection, but there were plenty of riots and strikes happening before the war with Army and National Guard involvement so it would be easy to justify having some law enforcement or army-issue suits lying around.
---
Saw one tonight. Can confirm bloodbath is the correct term.
---
Yes when the apocalypse happens there are gonna be a bunch of people who have somehow leveled up and when you shoot back they somehow take no damage and survive, not to mention all the events that are gonna be happening for them to hang around at and raid people, yes that is the real world apocalypse that would happen.
---
Finally someone agrees!
---
I‚Äôm stuck around all my sad sack friends telling me to stop playing it and I‚Äôm so glad there are people who play it to enjoy it not just to find ways to hate it.
---
I duplicated on my mini and I acknowledged my mistake and I feel so terrible. I wish I never did this :(. I‚Äôve spent money on my main and I will be so sad if I lose my account. 
---
I‚Äôm so stupid for duplicating 
---
The NCR merged with the Texas rangers, right? Those outfits are pre-war and would be available I think
---
No. When the world crashes there's gonna be a lot of people better armed and more skilled (not poking, just simple truth) who are gonna prey on those they deem 'weaker'. Humans are, at base level, smart, savage, violent creatures.
---
Me too at first, and the quantum armor made that make sense, so I went there and it wasn‚Äôt that building, but when I did the Fasnacht event I was wandering around looking for the marchers and saw Arktos up on the hill, and that was the building.  I went through It and didn‚Äôt find anything new...and there are all those sequencers in there that I couldn‚Äôt make work...
---
I am also that reason
---
Sometimes you gotta learn the hard way and it sucks. 
---
Here's how I got mine:

Not in camp. In workshops you can manually remove some items, but very few give any scrap.
---
Todd‚Äôs greatest lie, yet.
---
He doesn‚Äôt play this game lol
---
Same, hella down to try - GT: QuasarSilva
---
And you have that on record, where...?
---
Yah man it suck and it‚Äôs all my fault! I‚Äôve spent so much time in this game. Nearly 250 hours spent on this game and it‚Äôs all gone now. 
---
Haven't tried myself but im sure its very possible especially with a teammate that is more than willing to take all the aggro for you
---
What amounts to discrimination against the differently abled seems like a legitimate concern.
---
I had a similar thing happen in adventure mode, but with the Cultist outfit and mask. I had just found it (Lucky Hole Mine)and I fast traveled to Whitesprings station to sell/scrap stuff, then I see a dude who had the mask but not the outfit, he emoted that he wanted to trade, I emoted with a thumbs down saying no,he then attempted to kill me for it..lol He didn't succeed..and I had just sold all my loot and stored my scrap, so even if he did, he wouldn't of gotten anything out of it.
---
 I think they're talking about the challenges.
---
They were fine up until the brewing came out.
---
It's possible, theres a perk under agility called ninja which increases sneak melee damage. Likely youre gonna want to fill agility for the sneak and crits, strength for the melee, and either intelligence (atleast to five so you can mod weapons) or luck (for more crits and damage). Hope this helps
---
So fucking accurate.
---
You need a deadly build. Vats crits stealth sniper, bloodied melee, etc. Dodgey with Max agility, serendipity, etc will do a lot of work too.
---
You make me wanna try survival with
---
my AA bash damage minigun now.
---
It‚Äôs gross how quickly it eats through high level enemies. Would love to see it against players 
---
At the crashed space station. Far as I know its only place it is.
---
Responder bot has them. If you can get him to spawn
---
Ahhh I knew the new title screen was all images that had to do the with updates from Wild Appalacia and I couldn't figure what Arktos was doing there, thanks!
---
I think it‚Äôs a 2-3 hour cool down. If you have the missile silo holotape it tells you
---
Thanks bro, I didn‚Äôt know if there was a meta to the game or not and didn‚Äôt wanna die 24/7 trying to have fun with my own build 
---
Now to just replace the skyrim dragons with scorchbeasts!
---
No idea how it would do. Melee damage is easy to cheese out. I haven't done much with heavy weapons since the patch that adjusted them.
---
You'll 100% need one gun army 3 to stagger sentinel builds.
---
I dont think it matters which account, its more of an issue that it happened at all.
---
Not a hipster word. It's a subreddit.
---
Melee is incredibly OP in this game. You won't even need Stealth. With a Strength of 15 and a good 2-Handed weapon with the right perks, you can kill almost anything with 1-2 hits. I tried doing a VATS-Crit pistol build and hated my life for a while till I moved to a melee build and now I feel like a god.
---
Why are you on the sub for it then?
---
It also destroys the game by fracturing the community
---
 5. They plan to add a feature where CAMPS will persist after you log out. 
---
This. Rebuilding America might actually happan!
---
1 more
---
Well, you're one of the few who feel bad. As an honest player who never uses these kind of cheats, I don't feel bad. You people waste dev time and that is better spent elsewhere, not to forget you're negative impact on server performance. 
---
Good riddance. 
---
That‚Äôs really good to hear, so adding stealth to melee won‚Äôt be bad at all then since it‚Äôs already strong?
---
For some reason they don‚Äôt aggro on me anymore. Will legendaries still spawn in spite of that?
---
Just stop playing, that's how you win
---
Bragging rights 
---
They sure dodged a bullet by adding camps. I think I would‚Äôve dropped this game in a couple months. Not having your own base and having to fight a bunch of players for a settlement only to get disconnected sounds terrible. 
---
They need to take notes from place anywhere mods.  Building is lazy janky.  I like the changes the made but the snaps and ignorance of gravity looks novice.
---
Why would anybody pick raiders if there going to be forced into bad gear? There was hostile enemies in the other games that hD good armor. Enclave, gunners, Pitt raiders, talon company, BoS depending on view of synths. It‚Äôs not lore breaking to imagine a person hostile to other people who also has nice gear. If anything it makes sense that a murder would have nicer stuff than a wage maker. 
---
Stealth is kinda wonky in this game. Some enemies detect you at long range, enemies may spawn close to you and break your stealth, and much of the world is too open and vertical for effective melee stealth. I felt like stealth worked better at range, but I didn't have the Sneak perk cards, so maybe with Sneak and Ninja maxed a melee stealth build could work better.
---
There's a few Metas, I guarantee the first little bit of the game lvl 1-15 may prove a bit difficult, but by the time you hit lvl 50 or even 35 you'll make me rage quit the game. I should mention I hate fighting melee builds with a fuckin passion, they're extremely powerful if built right and combined with the right gear etc. Anyway best of luck to you friend
---
Yea I'm pretty sure a real raider wouldnt give a single fuck about what you think they should be wearing. All while eating breakfast from your skull of course 
---
I saw a lot of people prefer long range stealth builds so idk what I really wanna do yet 
---
With the money Bethesda has made off this game your statement makes no sense. If I'm smarter than they are then wtf ? 
---
The daily is actually 1400 daily. Each faction has 200 and you can sell to 7 every 20 hours. If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can show you an easy route. 
---
I just want them to fix the floating item / needs support bug.
---
He said criminal groups, not just raiders. So that could include the institute, BoS, gunners robot raiders, and those are just from 4. Many of the baddies in the fallout universe are well off because they can just take where as law abiding wastelanders have to save up caps. 
---
What
---
Xb1 here. Whatever the case this shit is stupid. There is no reason they cant have more of a limit. I shouldent have to quit the game for 24 hours just to sell one damn gun for 50 caps. That shit makes no sense. I can deal with the stash limit, nerfing the weapons, and lack of actual dlc content but for shit sakes this is not rocket science.
---
__With the money Bethesda has made off this game your statement makes no sense. If I'm smarter than they are then wtf ?__
---
Sigh
---
Thats what I was afraid of. I i had ever done anything to earn it other than not go looking for PVP that might be worth something. But I don't so it isn't.
---
Grenade it is.
---
Todd may seem like a cheapskate but he‚Äôs definitely a gamer at heart.
---
"No True Scotsman" Logical Fallacy. To imply that to be a fan of something you must love/adore/enjoy *everything* that is related to it is just plain silly. 
---
Long range Stealth builds are good, but become harder to use nuke zones and silos, where hordes just rush you over and over, and is basically useless against Scorchbeasts, but for fighting lower level and smaller groups, ranged stealth is pretty good. With a headshot, you can take out enemies much higher than you before they even know you're around. It's good for the exploration phase of the game, but for end game stuff, frontal fighting is what you need to be good at if you don't want to spend a lot of time carefully fine tuning your build.
---
More shapes and styles would be nice.
---
Yeah.. I‚Äôm a bit late on this game because everyone hated it or talked bad but I wanted to give it a try 
---
It‚Äôs the definition of gate keeping. Sorry about the downvotes. Each one of them came from someone who feels entitled to an advantage in pvp 
---
Its economy control. I could make 100k plus daily if they had no cap. It would dilute the value like crazy. Daily limit puts a bit of supply and demand value in it. 
---
For sure and also depending on how late in the process CAMPs were added could explain the general buggy-ness around launch. In addition to the dupers and other exploits we already know about, the addition of letting people build massive complex bases pretty much anywhere on the map couldn't have been good for stability if the game wasn't originally designed with that in mind.
---
yea, they should...I mean the 3 star General Gutsy that spawned for me last night just floated there and looked at me, spouting off how I was a commie...but his buddies that spawned with him shot at me.
---
But, if you've done the quest "mayor For a Day" the protectrons, Assaultrons, Mr Handys and eyebots in the area will have you marked as a friendly to them. Unless of course you shoot them, then sometimes they'll attack you, but it's only sometimes.
---
I'm only really saying they only like certain games of the fallout franchise like most likely: 3 and NV.
---
Wow that is so sweet, I've really been missing decorating with random crap I find. I remember feeling sooo burned when I first realized I couldn't use the teddy bears to decorate...
---
They did actually say that they have implemented an immunity system while you spawn, but it seems to be not working.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/330107/dear-bethesda-how-about-an-api
---
So that's why there were gutsy's running rampant. Thanks for saying that. They were no match for bloodied explosive harpoon.
---
You'll just need to keep hopping servers (logging and logging out) until you show up in a world where it has not been looted. 
---
Just wait till your level 100+ 
---
Then someone is gonna make this post about you, sir. 
---
Especially for those of us who trade in game merchandise, it would be nice to be able to jump into the app on your phone to check the status effects of weapons you are trying to trade here or in Discord instead of having to load the game and fast travel back to a stash box. Please Bethesda make this happen!!
---
Been playing Fallout since the original all the way back in the mid 90s. Personally, I find the game boring unless I'm playing with mates. If I've no mates, there is no fun. The world is empty, the world is bland, and all of the "interesting" things that happened happened while I was locked up in a vault.
---
It's great going to and fro across the Mountains of West By God Virginia and finding out about things like in the Mistress of Mysteries questline--that's a great story, it was fun, engaging, etc.. 
---
But only because I had a mate with me. And THEN I started thinking "I only get to hear of all this cool stuff, all the survivor stories of people who didn't make it, etc. Where's the fun in that?"
---
So I put on a clown suit, made a serrated machete, and went stab happy.
---
Because it's a make your own fun game.
---
All that said, if someone don't like it, that's their business, that's their opinion--most of my mates absolutely HATE Bioshock Infinite--does it bother me? Not in the least. And so it is with Fallout 76--I only find the game to be "Fun as hell" when I've my mates with me. Now, if they add in NPCs as this thread (and others) seem to speculate, then it may become a friggin' GREAT Fallout game. 
---
But right now? It's pretty bland in my opinion (and really, that's the key--in my opinion. It's just that, an opinion).
---
Sorry if that rambled a bit, but when they tell you not to stay awake after taking Ambien, BOY DO THEY  MEAN IT. Secondly, don't mix ambien and moonshine, and lastly, don't go to bed with a loaded firearm strapped to the inside of your thigh.
---
Oh that's really weird, it seems to depend on the person. I haven't checked the chest piece or head but I've got arms and legs so far.
---
Aight
---
He doesn't seem to be asking for sympathy tho
---
I think it has something to do with distance from your current camp.
---
i approve this idea, i would also add that maybe there should be a bit of a delay on the player marker on the map, like a, "last known location" kind of thing.
---
Melees been nerfed really hard
---
Thank you. I just kinda accepted the downvotes at this point. I just stated an opinion that's mostly right and received flak for it, just like the raider comments. They state you must kill and take to be a raider, but why do they ignore me killing super mutants and stealing from them? There's no way they could be wrong...
---
When you Choose your own adventure sometimes those are the best kinds.
---
The mysterious sniper. Great NPC pitch!
---
You mean the structured mercenary organization?
---
Good to know thanks
---
Wait till you see the Castle of Curvyness.
---
I think you need to find the appropriate law enforcement agency to fine someone or something.
---
What happens if you get the lawn gnome all the way through
---
Are they still changing the weight on those?
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted for that. Months into this games release and we still have crashing servers...
---
#4: oh fuck yes, ive been saving EVERY legendary i get for the legendar vendor in case it let me straight trade in for legendaries rather than just sell for caps
---
those handprint things everywhere.. interedasting....
---
Yeah it was kind of smart they did that because otherwise you could just walk around for hours there XP farming. The Gutsy's aren't the most formidable enemy but they're not sitting ducks either.
---
I bought Fallout 3 at the same time of the first Borderlands game. I played FO3 until we get out of the vault. Then i tried the other game and got "seduced" by the claptrap. It's only weeks laters that i went back on FO3, but also back then i didn't have as much time to play games (on top of having room for only one shared TV).
---
More recently, i now have my own room that is similar to a man cave and a few years i was replaying FO3 from scratch waiting for a price drop o  FO4. Then something bad happened in my life and i felt like i needed something to help me not thinkinb about it too much so i acquired FO4.
---
That‚Äôs impressive ! I could not be doing that the slow walking speed would kill it for me. 
---
Don‚Äôt you ever just thinking about throw all that junk away and run into the wilderness ? :)
---
yea, I've seen them before but figured they were a random spawn, but at the same time I was wondering why the Watoga bots weren't shooting them, I guess I know why now, lol.
---
Overgeneralization. Black and white thinking. "If you think 76 sucks, you probably only like 3/NV." More logical fallacies.
---
You've no idea where the people who dislike the game are coming from. For instance, I find the game bland at the moment--it's dull, boring, and I feel there's no real payoff to anything I do. What does it matter to me if a robot thinks I'm a nice guy? What does it matter to me this person has been dead for a decade, killed by (spoilers) who was then betrayed by (spoilers)? It's got nifty stories to uncover--and I was hoping for something similar to the Father in the Cave--the closest I've come to was with the above reference for the Mistress of Mysteries quest. But the sad reality is, those stories happened to other people. Not to Chester T. King, Psychotic Stabhappy Clown.
---
So yeah, love Fallout. Have every game. Have been playing them since 1997. Even had to buy a 3DFX Voodoo just to play the original. Been playing BGS games since Daggerfall.  Have several collectibles from Fallout adorning my computer desk this very moment.
---
Fallout 76 in it's current state is dull, boring, bland, and just plain not all that fun. If they fix it (and I admit they are doing a bangup job thus far--the new brewing system gives me a way to "make my own fun," as it were), then yeah, I'll be right there. For now? I play with my mate when he's around, and when he's not, I pretty much don't--because it is, to me, boring.
---
Sincerely,   
---
A dedicated Fallout Fan
---
I thought I had read that but dying on respawn made me think I was wrong. Thanks
---
Raiders don't role play, who the fuck thinks a bad guy should follow rules? Raiders raid and the raided weep, such is the world you play in buttercup.
---
Don't go into surival you will die
---
Uhh..
---
It makes people hunt you. Them hunting you means you don't need to travel for free caps. As long as you're a good shot and quick on the draw.
---
And now I‚Äôm just wondering who would win against each other, gunners or talon company. My money is on the talon company. Gunners just come off as another raiding faction.  Talon company comes off as a lot more organized. 
---
Flex your handmade and stealthboys the hardest
---
yeah, it goes from a mine to a c4 charge when you lay down number three haha. seems like something they may change, so shhhh
---
Considering the app didn‚Äôt work with even the DLC NO, I don‚Äôt expect them to update it. 
---
Best tip! Dive in with your love for Fallout and enjoy the massive world they've built. Ignore the pros and cons on here... live in it.
---
Claim a ton of workshops. Every time you claim or defend or reclaim a workshop you get a plan. Ever since I learned this, I always claim workshops at the beginning of a session. It cuts down on cap travel costs too because workshops are free to fast travel to.
---
Pay caps to go there, burn ammo, freeze and crash to desktop when the queen is almost dead. Some days I hate this game. The remaining bugs aren't that bad, except when they are. 
---
I'm the opposite bet, gunner lore they are the closest thing to super soldier's. The vault they're from culled everything but the cream of the crop
---
I literally just saw a post today saying ‚ÄúLegendary spawns have been up!‚Äù 
---
Goes to show how BS this sub is.  
---
Hide your camp better 
---
It would cost lag issues most likely. Its not the only game that does this
---
Well, as we can see with my others comments on this subject, i'm not a Fallout encyclopedia. They may be mercenaries like people said of the Talon group, but to me, while i was playing FO4, i felt like they were no better than raiders. Just more organized and better equiped.
---
That been said, i was only talking about them to say that people could be playing as others types of baddies. 
---
If you‚Äôre wearing that, would you be a gunner???
---
And ridiculously heavy
---
*Grabs gay dick*!
---
In a future update, camps will be immune to damage in Adventure mode
---
Lag? Its another quest marker on your radar. Do you know how many quest markers you can have? A lot.
---
And as for bags, its fallout 76, every player drops them when they die or simply drop items. That's a lot of bags per world.
---
It‚Äôs meant to an assault rifle and LMG. So my guess it‚Äôs meh in its terms of that. I love it as a LMG full auto providing suppressing fire 
---
Its where they spawn from ;) The vertibots come to pick them up there.
---
Maybe they were planning on weeding out all the whiny players that were dumb enough to travel to pvp hotspots expecting not to die. To the spawn campers keep killing these fools.
---
It was reduced some time ago.
---
Is it confirmed they come from that vault? I thought it was just a coincidence, and it sounded like they had much more mebers than what that vault would've held.
---
I shouldn't have to trick the game with a metal pillar to stack prefab staircases. 
---
It does for quad rocket but that‚Äôs about it. I totally agree
---
Not confirmed at all.  Just a fan theory.
---
bro, next time use a flaming chainsaw. It will never break, destroy a whole base down to the foundation and best of all.. never runs out of fuel cause it feeds on the tears of noobs.
---
Nice. Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt mind damage from npcs (I like having some upkeep but  I realize I‚Äôm probably the odd one on that) but didn‚Äôt care for it made it easy for other players to grief you. 
---
Read the entire post
---
 Not for the Excavator I don't think. 
---
Theory only, unconfirmed
---
Yeah I think I know what your talking about
---
Umm... Go play adventure mode
---
I can‚Äôt resist a lead extractor with a steel vein to the west and east and an aluminum vein to the north all with a view of the whitespring without being in the nuke zones
---
Nah, raiders conceal themselves as other factions to infiltrate and deceive. Don't be salty. 
---
I'm beginning to think it doesn't exist. Thanks for replying though
---
Lol someone is tilted
---
I think the best fix for survival is to delete it.
---
But seriously you can't make train stations a safe zone, because people will gank and fast travel to a station so they cant be counter attacked.
---
Enjoy the framed base (: 
---
I think a neat middleground would be persistent characters whose level gets reset to one but keeps their plans/blueprints.
---
It's alright. I've been defending the game since launch because I really think it's a diamond in the rough. There are many aspects of it I love and think have huge potential, but Bethesda really needs to sort out the major issues. Like the crashing. The most fun I had was when my SO and I held the middle of the map, nuclear plant + munitions factory + a couple more workshops. The constant invasions coupled with periodic pvp was really fun. Then the server crashed when someone nuked white. Meh. Tried multiple times since then but server always crashes right after getting everything setup, which is infuriating since you can't exactly blueprint workshops.
---
1. Don't play Survival Mode at low levels. It's not what you think.
---
2. Don't rush through quests.
---
3. Prioritize an early kitted out CAMP.
---
4. Explore, have fun and enjoy.
---
5. Do Nukashine at your own risk.
---
If there's a crafting station anywhere at all nearby, you can hear other players using it. It seems like since patch 7 you can hear things from crazy far away. I was near the crashed vertibird in the middle of Watoga and I could hear the sounds from someone using the tinker's workbench back at the train station.
---
Skip survival mode and enjoy the Forrest. Don't think about quest lines because that was my biggest mistake wait til you're level 50 so the rewards are better when you complete them
---
Just gimme a dog. Lemme pet the dog. Let me feed the dog. Give me a reason to come home to my camp. I mean, it's not like I don't have all the canned dog food in the world.
---
The cool down is a couple hours just server hop and launch that nuke. Btw what console you playing on.?
---
It's not that your quest marker vanishes. Your previous death bag does vanish, so there is nothing to mark.
---
10 level difference in this game doesnt make much sense, as levels just mean you have some more perk cards. The power difference between a lvl 100 and a 400 isn't very big, all other things held constant.
---
Hell yea, One was a three star goulper. Took off like a fucking Nascar driver.
---
Sorry, where did all this info come from? A livestream of some sort? Is it rewatchable?
---
Isn't it Atom Shop only?
---
That plus Basher 2 baby. Cripple limbs and stagger and they‚Äôre done. I‚Äôve cut through scorchbeasts in 3.5 seconds. Once I break their stagger I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way to stay alive. Shredder barrel has been low key insanely strong since day 1 but it wrecks durability.
---
I thought the original mechanic was if you died again before grabbing your old bag and after picking up any new junk your first bag disappears
---
Yes. Live stream at PAX East. It's up on their Twitch and YouTube channel as now.
---
Than YOU for replying!
---
I don't think I've seen the blueprints at either Grafton or the amusement park. 
---
I've only seen a handful of gulpers in the game, let alone any legendary ones, I didn't know they did this too. Only ever saw super mutants do it before.
---
There is one in the game you can get that is brown and yellow
---
I have all my stuff stored on my survival characters.  I bring it out to use it then put it away. 
---
What lies?
---
These suggestions would drastically improve Survival. Now let's just hope Bethesda reads the them and mulls them over.
---
Dome if them can be opened.  You can get a key from crevasse dam on top if the building on the raider corpse on the throne/chair.
---
No actually I haven‚Äôt seen any headlamp plans period, only the mods themselves. 
---
Except this one. 
---
Excited to see how this goes, but always against too much random stuff, gets people annoyed.
---
I know random is locked in, but I feel it is better to have a currency you can earn, even if it is very hard to earn, to buy a vendor item. Maybe buy a blank vendor item (Weapon, Armor), then buy each star you want, then buy each attribute. Takes a while to earn what you want, but it is better than random and possibly having nothing you want ever.
---
The best attributes may be a rare random roll and we all know how Fasnacht rare that can be.
---
Focus on melee weapons, at least first. They are way stronger than rifles from what I can tell. 
---
You can have mine. 
---
As a solo player, I've been sharing this a lot lately because it changed the game for me: If you're running into enemies with stupidly high levels, server hop. They spawn based on the player who gets to the area first and there are obviously a ton of high level players now.
---
I hit a wall a few months ago because everything was overleveled and my stuff was running out/breaking trying to kill level 50s at level 12. I couldn't even do the main quests. Got this advice two weeks ago and now I'm actually progressing! I'm level 27 now!!!
---
EXACTLY! Plus can we get more creative ‚Äúraider role play‚Äù than just constantly hitting me with a powerfist or blowing up the CAMP for zero reward lol
---
Who said all raiders had to be dumb? Using the best stuff you find is smart across the board. Get over it 
---
Raiders could get buffs elsewhere to make them a more viable option. Something like getting better boosts for chems or damage boosts for pipe weapons. They'd make a cool class that would be powerful early game but falls off later game whereas enclave would be the opposite because without their tech and armies they're just idealogues.
---
I think the problem is the player character. Why are they always the only one to end up getting crazy suits of armor and weapons outside of the factions that would normally have access to that stuff?  
---
Yes, cause I did. In the past. Thus I owns it, and have continued to own it. 
---
AH right I was confusing with the Western duster.
---
Well put.
---
I run a DC gauntlet unarmed build. I can oneshot most enemy‚Äôs, but the biggest issue is nuke zones. You can not use any unarmed weapon with power armor, so you have to run a hazmat suit and are VERY squishy. You can negate some of the squishy ness with the proper perk load out (I don‚Äôt know how to be the most effective with this method, I just use 2h in most nuke zones besides whitesprings). 
---
Where‚Äôs your record of him playing the game? O_o
---
i can recomend a good plastic bottle of booze for em. 
---
The only reason your character finds that power armor in FO4 is because the Minutemen lead you to it.
---
Honestly, it drives me nuts when enemies run off. I only notice it though if I'm in a place where they can't reach me. Like I'll usually try to jump onto something when fighting ghouls and then they always take off. 
---
How much money for NCR esk riot armor? You can have it bethesda.  SOOOOO MUCH WANT
---
Lvl 50 legendary fireflies. 
---
That‚Äôs a pretty solid idea, didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd agree on a middle ground. But imo having them viable end game with add more variety to the play styles. Like you said chem using bandits could gravitate towards the raiders where more tech oriented bandits would likely join enclave.
---
Sorry that we cant all have your great luck to get awesome legendary weapons.  Since you can get all perks, weapons, etc. from adventure and bring em to survival it is kinda unfair.  And ‚Äúbig boys in PvP‚Äù, getting a little cocky there eh?
---
This is almost poetic
---
Who are you?
---
If the door isnt dented or 'scorched' you can open it.
---
Um, that is dumb. It's a game, not global economy. 
---
3*, Wood Armor or Drills
---
I'd suck a **** for a legendary drill
---
It‚Äôs not fixed. My friends and I still don‚Äôt use strange in numbers because it takes damage way down
---
So if I am in raider armor and raider PA, and doing normal griefer stuff. You‚Äôll be okay with that? Legitimate question.
---
Wasnt the fasnacht masks their April Fools prank?
---
Happened to me the other day. First wave came took care of it, then the second wave never came. I waited like 20 min lol
---
Fallout 76 was never real. It was a holodeck program created by William Riker. 
---
Anti armor, 25% faster drill speed, your VATS critical meter fills 15% faster
---
They could just add sets of riot armor that the police use pre-war. Like the ones in New Vegas, it would be more lore friendly than NCR armor since NCR doesn‚Äôt exist yet. 
---
Right? People take criticism of this game WAY too personally. Like they‚Äôre the devs or something?
---
There has been multiple time where I've gone to defend a workshop and the creatures will get stuck in the wall
---
There's a house with many cats on all the walls.
---
So whose **** do I gotta service? Lol
---
Agreed, friend! I‚Äôm in the same boat as you, the game could‚Äôve been dope, but sadly, it is not.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug if you entered the code at that same silo this week you don‚Äôt have to enter the code the rest of the week. Just swipe a nuke card and select a target.
---
If you launch a nuke from a silo and enter the code the code stays entered all week for you so all you need is a new card don‚Äôt have to re enter the code 
---
I have been a pretty big fan of Fallout since I played the first game. That app was pretty much worthless and didn't add to or improve my experience with the game at all. They should be working on trying to unscrew the ness that they made with 76. 
---
What system you on 
---
Wait...wait...oh dam.  If i did not just start another Skyrim playthrough two days ago,  i would've given you only one wait,  lol.
---
1) Whitesprings sucks now. More so when a nuke is dropped. Better chance for loot without a nuke. Respawns are timed and doesn't matter if new people arrive as in the past. That place is dead now
---
Wait, others can build on your claim?
---
But the institute and BoS fit closer to misguided left over governmental agency than active criminal just trying to f shiz up. Big man SwagYolo420 couldn't really role play destroying some poor ladies shack house bc they are bored as the Institute or BoS üòÇ.  The RANDOM pvp leet dude "Ima keel j00 lulolll" aspect of most douchebaggery is representstive of Raiders.
---
the sound is still a dead giveaway though ;) thats why i like Weightless with chameleon mutation, you can stand as well as jump while invis. i have killed many chameleons because they weren't true chameleons and gave their position away with the sound.
---
good luck wastelander
---
Honestly I‚Äôm fine with the limited time of some stuff as a trade off as their way to put pressure to buy rather than designing the game to be grindy in order to make you pay to skip the grind. But I agree the prices are too high. I think though this will hurt bethesda the most as hey are high enough to discourage people from buying. I know I thought about spending some for the blackbird armor paint until I realized it was going to be 20 bux for one paint job. If it was just 5 bux I would have not hesitated. And I prolly would think of doing it again if something I really liked came up. Instead now I make sure to have a buffer of atoms I don‚Äôt spend in case another thing like it shows up as a one time deal. 
---
That's a mod I believe, not a legendary affect. Just like the Triple barrel.
---
At least 2-3 times a day since I bought it. Updates don't change a thing with disconnects on Xbox. 
---
Yeah same
---
"A¬†griefer¬†or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game (trolling), using aspects of the game in unintended ways."
---
Someone else killing you in a game that has PVP mechanics isn't griefing it's intended game design. Also Raiders used power armor in prior games.
---
I just dont understand why Bethesda thinks PVP is something that they should be focusing on and dumping all this energy into in the first place. I wish they kept it a pve focused game with some opt-in pvp. Now they have a whole game mode with all sort so changes, exclusive gear, and now seasons? Y tho.
---
They can beta my ass ain't gonna play it. Y'all have fun
---
No, it's not. The paint for normal armors was WW but the power armor paint (for t60 at least) was a sand coloured camo. 
---
There will be a vendor coming soon where u can trade in you're legendarys for other legendarys
---
You guys need designated Outfit Sets or Servers that allow you to select roles.
---
Any military bases. Camp McClintock, fort defiance, etc look for military ammo bags they will be on shelves, desks, beds, etc and they give ballistic fiber when scrapped
---
I made a post about Super Mutants that do this. I chased one literally at West Tek all the way to Whitesprings. My AP Regen sucked. 
---
And the reward? A 2** War Drum. FML. 
---
How about the sonic boom it makes on Xbox when you switch over to Microsoft Edge to Google wtf you're supposed make out of bulk bone shards and you switch back to Fallout 76 and Back Norris backhands you?
---
They removed the camo skin from the shop? Even if they did, isn't there a $10 camo bundle available now?
---
No, not cocky at all, I win some and lose some like anyone else...but its a place where people are competing to be the best, for a lower level player to come to the server and be shocked/cry about not being able to hang is assinine, its to be expected.
---
Are you quoting Dr. Stanley Goodspeed, a chemical specialist with the FBI sent to Alcatraz in 1996?
---
Nicholas Cage rocks. :)
---
Can I get an amen? No? 
---
Retreat! Retreat! Lol. I remember the first time that happened to me. I chased that mutant all over west tec trying to find him and get him killed.
---
A very good point. At a higher level, it also won't work because level isnt a clear indication of power. A level 50 character that was well planned out could very well be more powerful than a level 300 character. You don't really gain power every level up.
---
Beer hats reliably spawn next to the vendor in Harper's Ferry, over by the wall with "Allison" written on it in chalk (just in case you ever need to get another one).
---
Thank you. I will check them out.
---
I don't pick a ton of locks anymore but it has happened to me at least once since the last patch, exactly as you describe.
---
Heh. They actually had that one on its own but only for a day. And it was relatively cheap (enough that I bought it on a whim).
---
Did you try both entrances?
---
So biblically speaking (since that's where the Horsemen originate), the Pale Rider is the Plague Bringer. 
---
Buckle up, I'm'a lay out my thoughts on how this do, and what buffs (if any) the armors might give.
---
First, the relevant passage, 
---
 
---
&gt;**1** And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.  **2**¬†And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.  
---
&gt;**3**¬†And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.  **4**¬†And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.  
---
&gt;**5**¬†And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.  **6**¬†And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.  
---
&gt;**7**¬†And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.  **8**¬†And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.  
---
&gt;Revelation 6: 1-8, KJV (I like the poetic vibe it has to it, since this is all about imagery and flare, I felt it appropriate)
---
From the first two verses, we learn the White Horseman is to go forth "Conquering and to conquer," but he has no arrows for his bow. The verses are oddly specific about every detail of the Horsemen, so it stands to reason that if the Horseman had arrows, that would have been mentioned. There is a thought amongst some theologians (and was made more popular by the Jenkins/LeHeay series *Left Behind*) that the Horseman will conquer not through war, but diplomacy. 
---
The White Horseman Armor, if it grants buffs, will be Charisma Based (i.e. buffs to things that help your teammates).
---
Next, verses 3 and 4, we see the Red Horseman. He's given a sword, and the power to take peace from the earth. Not much to say on that one, since again, it's oddly specific he's given a "Great Sword," which given the time of the translation (1611) it would seem the Horseman has been given a literal greatsword--not the most practical from a mounted combat perspective, but the imagery is nice.
---
The Red Horseman Armor, if it grants buffs, will be Combat based (i.e. better melee crits, better weapon drops).
---
In verses 5 and 6, we see the Black Horseman. He is given "balances," or scales. Two schools of thought on that are the Scales of Justice, or the Merchants Scale. I tend to lean towards the merchant side of things, because of the voice giving absurd (for the time) prices on food stuffs. It is fairly safe to extrapolate then, that this Horseman represents famine.  It's also possible that alcohol will play into the stats for the armor, as the Horseman was instructed "see thou hurt not the oil and wine."
---
The Black Horseman Armor, if it grants buffs, will be Survival based (i.e. resource collecting, taking workshops).
---
Finally, in verses 7 and 8, we come to the Pale Horseman. The only Named Horseman, Death, and Hell followed with him. He's given power to kill in any way he sees fit, famine, plague, murder, war, animal attacks. Now, there's some debate on this, but theologians can't decide if that power was granted to Death and Hell specifically, or if it was referring to all Four Horsemen about that. Either way, the Pale Horseman is almost always depicted as ruling over the Plague--also an interesting note, the original Greek word from whence the translation came could also be translated as "sickly green."
---
The Pale Horseman Armor, if it grants buffs, will be Endurance based (i.e. resist disease, inflict disease).
---
And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, hobos and tramps, my breakdown of each armor, and what (if any) benefit they'll give (since there is speculation that they will grant some kind of buffs). Hope you enjoyed the read, I may take it upon myself to make a video on the subject, might as well, I spent all this time writing that out lol
---
Also, I will pay for these with cash money. I got the game free with a hardware bundle--so as long as they're not STUPID expensive, I'll be buying the HELL (eh? eh?) out of the Job Lot (that could also be turned into a joke, Job/Job, Lot--oh nevermind, wasn't that funny anyway).
---
If you do enough damage they run. Maybe looking to find an advantage. Or backup.
---
Enemies only scale in certain areas if they are scaling to higher level it‚Äôs an area you shouldn‚Äôt be. Try exploring the top of the map by grafton people make the mistake of growing left to right and the right side of the map is end game enemies will spawn high leveled without scaling. 
---
Your game plan should be middle left side then left/middle top then middle middle then bottom left then right side then right bottom. Or to be simple. Flatwoods then grafton then Welch and whitesprings then he far right side where the free states set up i don‚Äôt remember the name of the town off hand then watoga and fort difiance then fissure site prime. 
---
perhaps the duping community has found new exploits since the new patches. 
---
I can pick lvl3 locks. Try a roof and no doors. Then only the owner can go into build mode to move a wall to get in.
---
I think they meant you can‚Äôt die in one singular shot. ie: power first, DCG, TS shotgun, things that openly can clear a health bar in a bullet or swing. 
---
Yep and neither one is correct. 
---
Ok - thank you For the update - I will hold off on getting this mutation - hopefully it is fixed soon :) thanks!
---
To add to this, the Cranberry Bog in general is a decent source of ballistic fiber because it's the site of military and Brotherhood presence.  There are various camps and outposts around the region, and usually where you find them, there will be at least one or two ammo bags around. Watoga also has a few military ammo bags. There is one APC with an open hatch that has like two bags in it, and on a rooftop with a vertibird by some barriers, there are some more up there.
---
My camp is just down from there alongside the dirt road leading to it. Been there since beta, nice and quiet, hope the neighborhood don't go to shit. 
---
Yes, I know certain areas are high by default, just like any other Fallout game. It's not like I was trying to go to Cranberry Bog at level 10. But even going to Morgantown early on in the game was spawning too high of enemies.
---
Once I got to Whitesprings a few days ago by myself and spawned level 15 ghouls, I knew the server hopping was doing something right. It works.
---
If they are grouped with you, yes they can.  They can open doors you locked withandout picking them and build stuff in your camp (non-atomic shop items) that you will get to keep unless you scrap them.  I love leaving oil lanterns and electric chairs in the camps of people I randomly grouped up with. :)
---
my melee won't even work since day 1.
---
in VATS, i will click, it will play the squelch/slice sound, but no damage. this happens over half the time, Can someone help?
---
They have been there since release.
---
Sorry it bothers you that I choose not to play a broken, half-assed game, even if the location and enemies look really cool. It‚Äôs just not worth my time. But if you get enjoyment out of it then I don‚Äôt mind, have fun! 
---
Yes, I tried both entrances, unfortunately neither worked.
---
Happens rarely. Just exit the mansion and go back in and it'll work.
---
and how is it unfair that I played more then someone else and got good gear/perks that I earned vs the average player, its unfair that I bring my stuff to pvp with? So I have to be penalized cause I play the game a lot? Think about the logic there. Its not my fault the next man/woman cant hang/play a lot or doesnt have good shit or friends to help them in the pvp servers.
---
If you could go back would u still?
---
There are no unlockable mods for the Enclave plasma gun except the prime capacitor:

---
I honestly just put my camp by a junk pile and had a rescouce machine on it. Have so much of it now. 
---
CAMPs persisting is a nice idea. Problem is I have my CAMP all locked up to prevent people from getting inside in Survival Mode, it would have to lockpicked to get inside of and use its commodities in Adventure Mode if it persisted. I would love if we had separate CAMPs for Adventure and Survival, that way I can have a more welcoming camp in Adventure and a fortress of solitude in Survival.
---
Alternative would be to restore stuff to full after 24h time.
---
I agree, maybe not particularly *so much* about the trailers, though I would like to loot those things too. They usually had interesting goodies in the other games. 
---
Since you mention it I think the game could use some more skill checks in general, and I've been wanting to see some alternative method to open locks in particular. The idea you're proposing could probably make use of the Gladiator perk or something to force open locked doors with that pry bar - would need to have equivalent level in the perk to open a particular level lock (Gladiator 1 for level 1 locks, Gladiator 2 for level 2 locks, and so on) and it would damage the pry bar each time, so you'd have to repair it every so often. There would have to be some kind of requisite item like the pry bar so it's not just a "get out of jail free" card if you run out of bobby pins.
---
On top of that, in my opinion it would also be cool to open locks with explosives, maybe requiring specially-crafted charges in order to work as well as requiring quite high ranks of the Demolitions Expert perk. Both of these methods could have the downside of alerting nearby enemies more than lockpicking (with explosives being far louder than the pry bar, of course) as to keep some valid reason to use lockpicking instead, but it would also free up some Perception points for use with other perks and have the added benefit of being roleplay friendly (buff melee character brute forcing through obstacles, explosives expert character using precisely controlled explosives, and such.)
---
Mostly I'd like to see features like that just to mix gameplay up a little bit, but also to maybe cut down on swapping perks out *all the time*. My character runs with rifles and a healthy side of grenades, these days. I'm always runing with Demolitions Expert anyway cause of how many grenades I use, so if I could use that to open locks instead of lockpicking perks in Perception, I'd be able to permanently open up those three perk points for another full Rifleman card.
---
Yes in fact I am. It seemed to convey the level of wtf I had going
---
How about that metal box outside the nukashine speakeasy?  In theory anyone doing Biv's dailies will run past it twice a day, and I always dump extra recipes and ingredients in there on my way out.
---
Raiders can and will use whatever they have st their disposal. At the end of the day they‚Äôre just survivors on the wrong side of the moral spectrum. They‚Äôre also not all savages or brutes. Raiders are just like any other community except they play by less rules presumably. 
---
Let the build zone be square.
---
Hurry and let us put things on empty shelves.
---
Have the radio default on and the jukebox default off.
---
Radiation shower, let the power button work.
---
Change the animation when we sit down to our toon  drinking.
---
Let us put a container that we can put stuff in for others. Can be just a single 5 item container if it needs to be.  Same rules as all the other containers in the world.
---
This happens to me all the time, I also crash when reading notes looking at treasure maps and picking up magazines. its getting annoying
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind some hand crafted tricked out stuff! Im on PS4 level 24. 
---
Do you still have the plans I‚Äôm finally home
---
This! The Atomic Store funds the continued development of the game.
---
It's better than a subscription model because it's opt-in by folks who have the will/means. It's also far superior to the pay-to-win model, as everything's cosmetic and doesn't give a distinct advantage.
---
Hasn't "mysterious signal" typically been for alien stuff in fallout? 
---
If there are random rolls for Legendary gear, will there be a rarity involved for the top most wanted attributes. For example easy to get the Hunter attribute, harder to get Explosive or will they all be the same chance?
---
Wondering if it will be Fasnacht rare to get the best attributes. 
---
I laughed way more than I should. 
---
We all came out of the same vault, with the same opportunities.  Were you issued BOS armor out of the vault, or did you salvage it?
---
Are there any concrete build plans or just the defensive walls?
---
I'm just saying that if you have the technology to make a man-portable cold-fusion reactor that can power an armored suit for hours at a radioshack bench, you might be able to convert oil into plastic within a similar work area.
---
That sheet great and all for future reference. But I know for a fact that I‚Äôve unlocked a short barrel and stock before.  And that‚Äôs not  the regular one I‚Äôm thinking about.  It regardless of that gun. 
---
Stuff it missing. 
---
Yeah this should be pretty self explanatory. 
---
natural regeneration would be totally cool with me. with the supposedly upcoming pacifist camp update i'm even more eager to get it all fixed up as hopefully most of it won't get damaged after that.
---
Can't help sorry. I played 500hours and readed thousands of posts here, still i had problems to find them.
---
West tek have biggest chance to have legendary mob if you manage to server hop.
---
Events - uranium fever 3leg, wolf pack 3leg, AOWL 1leg, horde (if you are lucky) 1leg
---
Watoga have many spawns, so you must run around, same with golf club.
---
I found one legendary also in house near Rob.co
---
It is about luck and crazy grind.
---
Project ATLAS is a particle beam weapon that uses satellite reflection for global targeting.
---
There‚Äôs no reason for an observatory to have a Particle accelerator and the scientists log has a very Oppenheimer feel to it.
---
I also have been charged about 140 or so caps when moving my camp a few feet despite the pipboy saying 48
---
Early game Camp McClintock and a homestead?that starts with A north of the vault.  Late game/levels the bog, all the BOS firebases.  I actually sold some BF the other day as I had 200 plus and I rarely use it.
---
You'd have do make sure that people are locked to a single server then. It wouldn't work for everyone as some people prefer to server hop. Good idea for private stuff tho
---
Went there a few times to get plastic. But each time it seemed someone got them before i could.
---
Dude is running along. A crazy maniac with a chainsaw runs out of the trees and attempts to murder you.  You quick on the draw so u headshot him with your 44. congratulations... u have killed someone first now ur a global target for the rest of the maniacs on the map.
---
Seems like taking over workshops and defending them yield legendaries 
---
I am also that reason.
---
Anything that does multiple damage effects can kill you in one shot. For example: shotguns, explosive, ts, ballistic+energy damage, ballistic+rad damage, energy+rad damage
---
Server hopping doesn't do anything, unfortunately, it'll stick with you until they reset.
---
In the update coming sometime next month, all vendors are going to share their caps pool so you at least won't have to hunt down one of each faction to sell the maximum amount of stuff - you can just sell everything to whatever vendor is closest to you - but there's still gonna be the overall 1400 cap limit that only resets every 20 hours.

I usually spend at least a couple hours on one server and today I spent three on the same server. Iv been trying to find the x01 jetpack and it never happened so i decided to make a few laps at white springs and earn some easy xp. Leveled up three times today. Anyway there were very few legendaries as they were very few legendary enemies. Mostly i got armor that I would never use, robot this or that, wood armor, and some leather stuff. Sold .most of it but ended up helping a new guy, who was level 17 and was in over his head against a bunch of high level super mutants. I cleared the area, and all the loot I had plus what I got from clearing the area and all the ammo I dont use I dropped for the guy to nab. Point is, out if several hours of roa.ong around hitting stuff with a spiked fire axe, the only weapon I kept was a armor penetrating gauss rifle that I got at the very end. Frankly, it's kinda lame. I'm not complaining about the xp and leveling up, but I think there should be more decent loot like the game had at the start. 
---
Looks nice!  Definitely more complex than mine.  I have a nice view of the bog and Watoga while I play guitar, lot's of awesome spots to camp in the game.
---
I've had the door actually missing since the patch. The esm file no longer has a spawn point for it. 
---
What do I play on???
---
That is crazy lame. I. Very disappointed in bethesda after this game. Ready for fallout 5
---
Sounds like you have to find a 3 star.
---
Did you try removing veil and relog?
---
Same here, I just restart workshop mode completely because sometimes restarting the wire doesn‚Äôt even work. Works for me
---
I found the spawn camping and getting rofled  being unprepared really frustrating. Then... Then i realized if i change my spec around, go for stupid range, some hide and seek tactics... Good damn this is stupid fun, like, i seriously can't remember the last time pvp has had me this pumped, other than seeing a naked dude spawn in wielding dragon bone... That was up there to. 
---
Lol gunner and talon are kinda mercs my guys a merc raider I got all metal! Running that x 01 though!
---
To be fair, in Fo3 they were just raider reskins.
---
You are incorrect. Tse does easily one shot most players that don't have fp3 and dense. Due to providing 4 different damage sources
---
&gt;I[f] you're go[i][n]g to "rol[e]play" a ra[i]der you [s]ho[u]ld being wearing Raider armor and Raider PA.. If you're wearing Heavy Combat BOS armor and [X][O-:] you're just a griefer.

Wasn't this subreddit just talking shit about Bethesda last month?
---
Oh yo same you wanna trade some time?
---
What's the point of : blocking with pillars in Conan; putting a player inside a burning dog cage in GTA; wall glitching while killing other players in \_insert online game here\_.... 
---
People enjoy trolling others. If you can block someone from getting the \_\_\_\_ through some low effort means, someone will do it just for shits and giggles. 
---
Your problem is that the folks with current meta sets and explosive weapons are using sets that give their damage resist while in motion (jumping + falling) **and that shouldn't be a thing because the set says it should only do that when they are standing still**, and that explosive legendary bonus basically has no falloff on their explosive shots, meaning they can counter snipe people with hitscan explosive bullets that have, of course, aoe, so even if you missed them you'll still hit them. It's like if the Soldier in TF2 had a rocket launcher that shot hitscan rockets with 0 falloff damage. Where's the balance in it? Explosive legendary weapons need damage falloff relative to their base weapon's damage falloff. You want to laser people with an explosive gun across the other side of the dry lake bed near Charleston? Then get an explosive sniper rifle.

U*. My bad

we watched one of those suicide super mutants with the mini-nuke Shout "retreat" and run away. my friend is like "Are they supposed to run away like that" :D
---
I just found the legendary [Killer Opossum of Caerbannog](https://i.imgur.com/Lp6SNTC.png)
---
Because the player is SPECIAL
---
I get it, I really really do. No seriously, I do. I almost made this exact rant myself last night. However, I disagree. Put the top player in every category, all seven. On the map. Why top three? Third place could simply be a fluke. But the top seven? The top killer, whoever survives the longest, the most events, the most xp..all of it. But a notification is going to be needed. Kind of like wanted to let you know that you just joined the soon to be departed. But and here is the fun part. If someone is number one they are immune to first shots if out of combat. Basically turn the slap system back on but just for them. Now see you have a reason to want to be there. Trust me I cannot tell you how mad I was at getting assualted by two people, a third individual who in turn killed my attackers and tried to kill me only to join my attackers after my friend arrived, a fourth who did finally kill me only to die seconds later (how'd you like that ya prick, he left server) and then another group of three people who heard all the killing and wanted their blood from a stone. All of this and a buttload of my caps, because I avoided everyone and played the game in a harder setting. 
---
The problem is groupthink.  It baecame a fad to dislike or even hate fallout 76 for a lot of people.  Us loyal folks knew that it was worth the wait and we were proven right!  Enjoy!!
---
Can confirm. Got killed multiple times, exclusively by getting hit one time.
---
But both servers are PVP I thought?
---
There are dog only equippable items in the game as well as enemies who have flags like cantbedogstaggered which applies to a stagger ability. Maybe we will get dogs? 
---
You awaken in a brahmin-drawn cart with someone talking to you, the say this: ‚ÄúHey you, you‚Äôre finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush same as us and that thief over there.‚Äù 
---
No not from an originally single player franchise. And even someone thats well stocked stands no chance against someone like you. Its an unbalanced game in a lot of ways dont justify it cause the scales tipped in your favor.
---
But if you aren't in survival you shouldn't have to worry about your camp.
---
It's because some people have he (Netflix) mommy/daddy get it for me now complex.
---
Had my camp right near there for a long time. 
---
Mercs are kinda bad guys for hire but not necessarily bad guys!
---
Also it could be set up so the number on the marker is how many of the boards that player has top of
---
I like it, makes camp placement strategic and relevant. Otherwise everyone would just camp train stations
---
Most of the time I'm playing this game I'm intoxicated so the quest line was basically like a regular day for me. 
---
I've noticed blanks when it's radtoads or cave crickets for some reason 
---
Sorry, no. I don't keep items with Suppressor's prefix at all. I honestly would love to gift away most of those 3\*s but players are usually too high level, ignore me or they'd just sell them to the nearest vendor.
---
Super mutants do it on purpose. It's supposed to be funny. Other mobs do it because of pathing. If you are hiding on top of something and a melee based mob can't get to you they run, then come back, when you come down. 
---
Ever heard of video game physics? 
---
Well, i meant pixels trying to kill the player and i could not use the word monsters neighter.
---
Witch Hat and Halloween Skeleton Mask are gone.
---
Not the end of the world but irking all the same.
---
First the COBJ record was 'broken', was missing the workbench keyword, then several patches later it was fixed; I had a cursory look the other day an now it seems to be gone.
---
It does however make one wonder what else is gone.
---
Are the outfits labeled atx in the esm? If so that's because they are atom shop planned. Otherwise they just aren't in game yet 
---
They are in a future update. No damage to you (like the recent patch) or your camp unless you attack back.
---
Yeah I have to chase down ghouls and it's stupid. Like I'm fighting 10 or 15 and after I kill a few the rest take off like they are scared. That would be fine except the definition of ghouls is " humans that lost their mind due to radiation poisoning and are nothing but violent and aggressive yet they run off. Makes no sense
---
Notice how if you drop stuff then move away and drop more stuff your first bag vanishes? It's because it gets put in 1 bag and moved to your current location. 
---
How many drills and syringes did you get? I still get too many of these. Each time, I think  a legendary mob as not dropped a  legendary item and then the feeling when you see the drill or syringe...
---
Raiders have crappy gear cuz they trade the good stuff for chems! Good raider = good gear!
---
Next time I log in, I will try. Thank you for your help. :)
---
They once said that the better the scrapped gear, the better your chance for getting good effects.
---
Right?  Among camp plans. Several guns and melee mods aren‚Äôt there. Even some armour mods that I got in beta aren‚Äôt there. 
---
If it doesn't work the next time I log in, I will try that. Thank you for your help. :)
---
It's too early to think about all this right now. It's not like they are implementing this feature in the game very soon in it's present state.
---
Lol who wears wood armor Neanderthals? Aka no one!
---
They reduced the spawn rate cause people whined about farming, yet they were the same people farming. It's also the same bunch that complained that people with tse were one shotting enemies so others couldent farm the area as easily and then bethesda nerfed the tse weapons. Pretty stupid honestly. Now the few legendaries only drop armor most of us dont want and end up selling to gain caps and lose weight. I just deal with it. I still find the rare jem but only now and then. Really, a loop around white springs is more about the xp for me than anything. Just wish they would raise the number of points you can have. Limiting them is lame. Every other fallout game you either had a level cap or could keep gaining perks. 
---
Well said, TazBaz. If I wanted to PVP without purpose, I would not be putting up with the mechanic issues and bugs galore in a FalloutMMO. Want to remain in Adventure mode and PVP?  Listen to Hunter Radio.  As for bugged mechanics - tonight as workshop owner, All 3 members of the team were victims of a lower level's one-shot. Ok - we were not prepared. When I spawned back I was again killed outside of the workshop area and unable to return any damage. Workshop was not contested, and player left server. I was not able to reconnect with team nor seek revenge. Must learn to survive within the wasteland of bugged mechanics. 
---
On my low level characters I keep a fast and medium melee weapon, a pipe revolver, a sniper either hunting or bolt action pipe, and a shotgun. This round with a new character I added a 10mm as my speedy pistol
---
Your generosity has attracted beggars
---
It happened to me when I wanted to turn in the final step of the quest line. The laser grid wouldn't let me through. I exited the mansion and came back in and the grid started turning blue again for me.
---
Probably because they don‚Äôt have any caps to give 
---
Yeah and that area can be pretty wide.
---
I'm playing a new character because i'm waiting for player vending to help unload the inventory of my main, and for a few days i had my camp almost in front of Slocum Joe.
---
Each few time i loaded into the game i had a message saying my space was occupied and last time i said "ok, i'll use that free camp move". Earlier i had the idea i could make a camp using that big add pannel just north of Slocum. As i was trying to deploy, i could see the limits of a "no build area".
---
Yes, it was partly because of Slocum Joe but also because of the other player camp. I moved around it with my camp device in my hands and it was pretty big. Ultimately, i chose to relocated farther, on the hill where Arktos Pharma is.
---
How does this person follow you if you blocked them?  Wut?
---
The only camps I destroy are the turret camps people build at whitesprings 
---
I think that‚Äôs in two weeks? I‚Äôd have to double check it‚Äôs getting close tho my stash is full with all the best legendary drops I‚Äôve found 
---
No clue, maybe one of my friend forgot to block her 
---
They said the next inside the Vault (coming on April 2, I think) will contain more news about the next patch, so it'll be on it I guess.
---
Yes that makes sense. But ones out in the middle of nowhere being destroyed by random people gets very annoying.
---
That ruins the entire aspect of being in a wastland filles with raiders and other things that destroy your base... This is the kind of stuff that kills games like these...and hey put your self in pacifist mode they cant touch your base.... Dont try ruin everyone elses fun just because you had your base attacked. Join the party lol your not the only one
---
Currently I have:
---
7 Antibie

I'm currently operating assuming I can get at least one cap for each item, and probably more for the Rad-X, vintage Nukashine, Med-X, Addictol, and Antibiotics. I just don't have more accurate value approximations, though I have been looking to see if I can find any previous trades of those items and base prices on those.
---
Yeah that even is garbage lol 
---
The biggest difference for me is not being able to save my game.  FO4 is in my top 5 all time games, so 76 feels like a huge online/dlc skin of it.  I guess I don't see what the problem is with a few glitches or server drops, I've enjoyed it for what it is and it's 100% exceeded my expectations.  
---
The nuka cola power plant it marks t with a way point 
---
Happens to me all the time
---
Realy? Never saw that, maybe new feature going to check out.
---
You win the obscure reference award. And I win the Uberdork award for not only recognizing it but publicly admitting it. 
---
First of all, I‚Äôm a Beatlenaniac. And second of all, these sound better. 
---
Losers always cry about their best. Winners go home and..... ;)
---
Well, the most conspicuous one that was removed long time ago was the 'travel' mat.
---
To be fair I don't 'build' camps; the first time it got levelled I decided that being a preventable source of frustration I'd go for the 'take it out when you need it and put it away when you are done' approach.
---
Once 'pacifist' extends to CAMPs I will get on with it but then I won't know what is missing because I never noticed it was available to begin with ;)
---
Some items present in the game in BETA were removed from the full release.
---
If you Google "fallout 1 Super Sledge" it shows you what it looked like in that game and also there's pictures of the 3/nv version. They're all different. And the vault suits? I thought that would convince you but you think they all look exactly the same?? Google vault suit fallout 3, then vault suit fallout 4, THEN vault suit fallout 76. THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT
---
I have been trying to test this myself for some time but like other obscure info like vats cost, no one knows.
---
What I know is that there's an "overkill" meter when you're about to go into injured state. If you get slapped by glowing deathclaw on your last 5% of health, you're certainly gonna drop dead right away. But if you get pew pew by gutsy, you usually drop injured. 
---
I know about those. But I‚Äôm missing things like tables, chairs, stuff like that. Things that really don‚Äôt matter but shouldn‚Äôt just vanish. 
---
It‚Äôs one thing if they were causing issues or something. 
---
Seemed like the gunners were far tougher and more organized. For example, they have entire towns in 4. 
---
Because the intro isn't tied to any volume setting and I'm getting tired of my ears being raped.
---
Dude go play survival mode, your base will get destroyed less, because unless your on the top 3 top survivors (easy to avoid) they will have hell of a time finding u and your friends.
---
Yes please Bethesda! I would lovely to adoringly scroll through my notes and food whilst in a meeting at work :)
---
I'm on Xbox and I'm looking for stable Cobalt  and Violet Flux to complete my T 60 Jetpack. Also interested in a weapon the fires exploding rounds.
---
QQ
---
I‚Äôve started being afraid of this. Because it can trigger PvP
---
Nah I see your point, but my friends and I just like to relax and not be on edge. Plus we weren‚Äôt expecting to get followed server after server by the same people. 
---
Actually, the ATLAS device is a very GI Joe like weather control device
---
If you're a raider, you take/scavange equipment. Taking the best armor you can find is completely within a raider's jurisdiction.
---
At least you get a bag marker, I haven't gotten even that for awhile. I do get the skull and crossbones though.
---
Pacifist doesnt auto disable.
---
Short and sweet, I approve of this post.
---
What platform are you on? I'm on Xbox and can share a couple.
---
But if I read the whole thing how can I make baseless assumptions? But for real though, somehow I missed that. My bad. 
---
I guess I keep an eye out for that, especially if I'm meeting someone. 
---
I cheerfully point out that if they're farming you on one of your workshops, they're going to start farming you on the others you'd give up by logging anyhow, because they're not farming the workshop, just you. All my suggestion does is speed up the process by accepting that you're going to lose the workshops and moving on.
---
You were referring to 4 and 76 in your previous comment... 76 uses the same exact assets for everything that returned from 4. Never did I claim that for any other game.
---
4 and 76 super sledge are identical. 4 and 76 vault suits are identical besides the numbers. That's all I claimed. I have no idea how you understood otherwise.
---
I hope you're right.  Also both happy and aggrieved at the whole 'all vendors at white spring' thing, because I just fuckin know that as soon as that happens, I'll never be able to log in and have my camp again.  It's in a perfect spot near WS, and once that becomes the new de facto """hub""" I can kiss that spot I suffered a fucktillion scorchbeasts for goodbye.
---
Give us almost all assets to build like those giant windmills and crashed airplane pieces, just to name a few.  There are great mods for Fallout 4 that give you access to build pretty much every asset in the game to give your settlements more character.  Norespawns and NAHTE1696 made great settlements with that freedom.
---
Allow CAMPS to be a bit bigger to accommodate player-made towns.  Especially is NPCS get added later one.
---
Make building less strict and more lenient like in Fallout 4. 
---
I also kind of miss the Workshop DLC stuff from Fallout 4, like the munitions factory even though it would be pointless because of the Tinkerer‚Äôs Workbench.  
---
Here‚Äôs a fantastic idea on how and when to implement this:
---
Nuclear Winter is coming up on our roadmap next. Let‚Äôs have Protectrons and Eyebots ringing bells outside Train Stations asking for donations on behalf of the Responders. Common items can be picked up for those donation bins.
---
For the rarer legendary items/plans/recipes, players can meet with a Sentrybot dressed up as Santa Clause in the lobby of the Whitesprings Resort. If the player has been a good little Vault Boy or Girl - which could be something as simple as seeing if they have engaged in PVP or more complex requirements - they can tell old Santa Sentrybot what they want for the holidays based on what has been donated on that server.
---
As an incentive, those who donate could get some chocolate Atom Shop coins. They could also rerelease holiday items that can no longer be purchased. Maybe even Graham could get in on the spirit and also dress up like Santa with Chally also sporting some reindeer attire.
---
Christmas in July.
---
This thread has restored some of my faith in online discussions. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
I thought it was supposed to be next, I was really looking forward to it and camp decorating.  As it sits, I'm kind of burnt out, what with lack of engaging content left for me (I don't pvp and Survival is a broken mess, as I hear it) and the tolerance for all the ~~bugs~~ *features* having reached absolute zero at last.
---
You'll live, you die, you'll live again.
---
Go buy one from the Nuka Cola vendor at The Whitespring. She will sell you one per server hop.
---
Had the same experience a little while ago. My friend was grieved just like this through different servers after using "block". I think the in-game block only works for that session  so I believe they followed him/us through the console menu and recent player section where you can select a gamer and out to join.. thoughts?
---
Why though? like i said, you can already hear people coming way off. And coming across players in this game isn't that much of a rarity. So why does this 'everybody can see you now!' exist? 
---
It's artificial fun in what should be a realistic sandbox experience. It also hurts stealth builds massively since people know exactly which direction to be looking with their frickin berry mentats. It is a punishment, although it can attract people to your CAMP, so perhaps a positive if you want to lay traps or just lure people to kill. But in my opinion, that positive is not as important as making the game balanced and not a game of WHO CAN PRESSING ESCAPE constantly to check the map to win.  
---
 Whilst you **can** guess that people will come to get you from a train station, it is still far too unfair that they can **pinpoint your exact location (I mean to exactly which corner of a tiny building that you're in).**
---
So it should only exist for the top 3 top killers i.e serial killer mass-murdering 'pvpgods' or those kind of RP'ers out there who just grief.  
---
The  slapidea, while it works, contradicts everything people wanted out of a realistic survival experience in my opinion.
---
You interested in a ranger hat? 5 capsüòÇi dont know dude.im only a lvl 10.ps4 too.glad to see we're out there!
---
I want ro be able to repair everything in an itemized fashion at the CAMP. 
---
She is on one of your friends list. That's how they kept following you from server to server.
---
How is Bethesda this braindead? Survival should be a fresh restart for everyone. What the actual fuck 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs OPs intention to ruin anyone‚Äôs fun. Some of us never asked for a multiplayer Fallout game, some of us don‚Äôt mind the multiplayer but just want to do PvE content. Plus that‚Äôs why they placed survival mode, for those who like to PvP and like to live on the edge. 
---
Yeah I'm pc but I won't be on until the end of the offer I think. I'll let you know if I'm around.
---
you can msg me in discord anytime mate
---
They haven't even acknowledged it. They aren't working on it at all 
---
It depends on the player you‚Äôll be trading with. Overall I‚Äôd say drugs that boost the amount of damage that you can deal.
---
Orrrrr, you can leave the world if they do that.
---
same with desk lamps and those annoying ass paper holders. 
---
She‚Äôs not on my list as I blocked her. But maybe one of my friends forgot to. But for me I just find it sad how others have to harass people to feel happy about themselves. 
---
Guns don't get very enticing until around lvl 40.  It's just a constant grind for ammo.  Find a machete or combat knife and hoard ammo until you find something good.  Armor was my problem, do the 'Leader of the Pack' event every time you see it on your map, 3 guaranteed low level legednary pieces
---
I feel like that‚Äôs a strong possibility, though I blocked her through Xbox.
---
This runs contrary to the primary function of human social organization.
---
While we are at it..recycled tires are a thing.
---
The game is broken, barely functional, full of bugs, yet filled to the brim with bland, unrewarding content. Of course people aren't going to give it a chance. 
---
It's so bad some stores are literally giving it away for free ffs 
---
essentially i am saying that listening for footsteps and scouting the area is more fun than repeatedly pressing ESC, and it is also unfair for the pacifist survival player who has invested their whole build into sneaking -  their precise position is updated in real-time to the whole server. ?!?!
---
Why have I not had any problems on my Xbox One X?
---
The answer is in the title of your post because it's called SURVIVAL. The goal is to survive the longest and once you get there you have to defend it. That said It would be nice if highest kills were on the map too. Unfortunately if you watch it kills, are reset with deaths and they are constantly changing as players die, my guess they dont do it becuse it would cause alot of lag.
---
Yes..maybe a little personalization on our end that wouldn't effect the online part. I don't  know if that makes any sense..lol. love to be able to text with a key board. On console.
---
For me its Buffout (and "buff" chems) and calmex running a stealth tank character so both are great
---
Fair enough 
---
?
---
You can use the perk sun kissed although it may take a while
---
Eh. It could be worse. It could be Swarm of Suitors. I swear, that one is almost never able to be completed because the event spawns the mirelurks on the other side of the lake so they never show up. Doesn't help that they're out of draw distance too, so you can't scope in and find them. So then you're forced to leave the island and kill the mirelurks, which will, again, fail the event. I had a Heart of the Swamp event where the defenders spawned out of the event zone too, and Mr. Messenger events are always a frustration because of how Mr. Messenger likes to get stuck in geometry. Then there is Census Violence showing its active on the map when it actually isn't. I've even had Mr. Gutsy spawn at AWOL Armaments event that would run out of the event zone to go fight a Scorchbeast over by Bogtown Workshop. Basically, a lot of the events are a headache and in need of fixes.
---
So the goal is to survive and the reward is a punishment to some, reward for others. It makes no sense.
---
Not everyone wants to lure people into traps or for stealth builds to have their position updated in realtime and have everyone know that they're in the northeast corner of a tiny shack. Even if they're chameleon and fully invested in sneak you will always have a disadvantage against any good fps player who knows how to read a map.
---
If anything just make it less accurate (100m radius or something) and I'd be happier.
---
The roadmap on their site has exact dates. Think vending is the 9th. May want to double check.
---
dumb question how do you even start this quest 
---
You've made my day. Nine to five keep your distance.
---
The Decon Arch can also remove your mutations when healing your rads, just like radaway. The only sure way is to have Starched Genes 2.
---
I'm on Xbox and it happens frequently. Now I immediately block and push the enemy back if possible.
---
At what level can I equip the second rank?
---
I see it on this picture but in game she looks nothing like desdemona hahah
---
May try it but another person brought up starched genes rank 2 which guarantees I keep it so I'll keep this in mind
---
will happen after the roadmap is done and a few month's are gone. mod support and private servers will kill the live servers for all tryhards and real fan's who want to play as immersive as possible or with their own rules. 
---
Meanwhile I get the people who destroy my base on a daily basis or just hit me 24/7 hoping I‚Äôll hit them instead of a enemy 
---
Yeah you just mentioned you weren't high enough level so just thought I'd throw it out there. I usually keep sun kissed on just for the fact is saving radaways. And I can free up two points in luck
---
As long as it keeps people away from my spot so I can finish my tavern/bar I am fine with that xD
---
Yeah that little ‚Äútick‚Äù sound make me go crazy , especially since i started using a headset 
---
Agreed I only ever do line in the sand, distant thunder, uranium fever, and breach and clear all others just don‚Äôt seem to be any good. Either buggy or just not fun/ rewarding enough. 
---
I tried 3 of them on PC today and no marker ever showed up on the map, yet I could see the drone with them flying far away. It seems to be broken atm anyway. But yeah they give average crap. Nothing horrible, nothing great.
---
I guess there is a significant number of real Bethesda fans, who prefer single player. So it's very good to know that some day, they will implement it 
---
you know what - exactly - your scenario highlighted why the whole global target idea is dumb.
---
But people who want to keep it, whilst minimizing hackers/exploiters/griefers, this is my idea: Changing it to have the top killer(s) would hopefully act as a barrier to go on an absolute murdering rampage rather play the game and actually do some questing too - otherwise things get more difficult. 
---
It's highly unlikely you'll keep number 1 for long just by defending yourself.
---
I'd advise bringing "class freak" to 3 üåü so your character doesn't starve to death. And 2 üåü ' starched genes" Once you have starched genes in place don't remove it unless consuming another mutation serium (put it right back in place) or you'll lose the mutations.
---
they already do so. me and alot of my friends have mule accounts, they always trade with them or other players from our group. you just need at least one friend, drop stuff into an open world container, log out and join the same server hooking on the friends world and collect the stuff.  i could imagine they add account wide stash with let's say 2000 carryweight for all chars of the account. that would prevent mule chars and they can sell it as quality of life, everyone lick their testicles for adding such a great feature and everyone will be happy. 
---
Is this for the arm? If so I'll pay 500 caps
---
So top it out at a certain amount of camps that can snap. I think we're already limited to how many people in a team, why not let a team build together? 
---
Someone is offering 6k about to close the bid
---
I mean, I guess. But a preexisting town has more stuff than a few people building together. 
---
I have a good spot.  Not keen on losing it after all the shit I've put up with to keep it.  Shit like three fuck ugly shrieking cancer bats attacking it at once.  
---
Iam trying one more thing and I redownload all of it to a new disc , was on the ssd before .
---
But Iam not keeping my hopes up :/
---
The app didn't work with the DLC? How so?
---
Oh, nvm
---
I‚Äôve noticed that too. I think I‚Äôve only seen like 5 people between lvl 30 and lvl 100 in the past month. Probably just coincidence.
---
i quit the game last week, played since beta almost every day mostly pvp but got exhausted from the state of the game and lacking content + updates.   
---
Imo the only way to get this game work as a game should work is to open mod support, it won't take 1-2 weeks modders get the game nearly perfectly fine and balanced with low effort, looking at the mod comunity from skyrim or FO4 which grow over time to such a awesome thing with so many cool and creative mods which have so much love for details, quality and creativity bethesda could never reach with their team even if they try - what they don't even do. 
---
I believe that there's a note or a holotape that triggers a quest.
---
Caution, spoiler alert :
---
Project Atlas : you can learn everything by going to the Observatory.
---
Huntersville : the army poisoned the drinking water of Huntersville with the FEV virus. Hence the quarantine and the muties there.
---
Have fun :)
---
Absolutely! I was so sure there would be an app for 76...but then nothing came up. I loved it in Fallout 4 and even have a Xbox controller smartphone mount, just to use it. 
---
If you're going to "roleplay" a raider then walk around in circles with your gun drawn shouting 'You never should have come here' while letting me shoot you from crouching behind a bench.
---
I do that! I lose literally every time but it‚Äôs fun! I have my camp by the top of the world and I try to fight people who encroach on my territory. I try and shout raider lines from Fallout 3 like, ‚Äúthis is gonna be fun!‚Äù. I‚Äôm usually mowed down before I can finish anything though. 
---
I‚Äôm also running cannibal and trapper gear for the one day I do win and I can eat them....
---
üëÄ
---
Nuke cola grapes will cure rads safely.one can spawn in frat houses or purchase from vendor second floor whitesprings,think one can also spawn in Tntdome 7.
---
yeah my point is they probably don't want to encourage people to use mule accounts, so why would they let people be able to do that?
---
Git gud.
---
I figure with the (unbelievable) number of frames in the wild a raider would have a pastiche of parts. Basic raider PA unless they found a better piece. 
---
That said I dont see them repairing said pieces so once that T45 arm or T60 leg breaks they just ditch it until they find another. 
---
Same for regular armor, a mixed bag of the best they've found wear it til it's worn out. 
---
My raider is a newbie but she rarely wears outfits, just armor and harness or road leathers. 
---
I think they meant "the atom shop isn't necessary. You can just choose not to grind" without meaning "You can just pay instead of grinding."
---
Power armor? In PvP?
---
You‚Äôre better off with your best legendary gear and damage reducing perks.
---
If that minigun had AA you might as well of been naked to him
---
Its the daily challenges.
---
I like this, great idea man take my upvote 
---
Dude, I'm not sure but I suggest you to uninstall your Fallout 76 and Bethesda launcher. Delete every folder exist about fallout76 and Bethesda. Then try to install again, please.
---
I think some files damaged and system don't know this, so you need to help your sweety computiy.
---
I'm role playing as a raider who robbed a guy with Power Armor.
---
I‚Äôm talking about starting the nukashine quests
---
Player vending comes out on April 9th
---
Sounds like a bad hardrive happened to me on my old HDD couldn‚Äôt download anything new and a few current games were not starting right hit a new drive and everything was good again. 
---
It would be cool. But it breaks the lore. Vault 76 shuts down completely. As in all life support systems are offline and can‚Äôt be restarted by us. 
---
Yea I tried to too yesterday ! But the launcher seems to remember my username and favorites so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a clean new install , don‚Äôt know how to delete everything and make it fresh beside uninstall option .
---
Thanks for you‚Äôre help though 
---
All they need to do is expose the API with specific key control/permissions and the community will build the websites and apps  for them...
---
I would love to see an event or new quest that lets us go back to the vault. Like Trouble on the home front in fallout 3!
---
Because new players still start in it. Also in lore the vault becomes uninhabitable once everyone leaves.
---
Yeah I have a few hdd and I tried a new one now . Fingers crossed :)
---
Lmao üòÇüòÇ
---
There is no level requirement for higher ranks. Starched Genes unlock at level 30. Get it twice and upgrade the card. You will need a minimum Luck of 3 to equip Starched Genes 2.
---
I would like to join too, I might have a few friends too..
---
I agree, there's a lot there if you take the time to appreciate it. I don't miss human NPCs babbling the same inane shit over and over while refusing to stop blocking the doorways.
---
I have a level 5 Assassin's Pump Shotgun for sale if you are on PC. There is a picture of it from one of my recent posts under my profile. 
---
We don't hit the main spots and we've seen an increase not a decrease. Maybe they just leveled out where they spawn.
---
With mods, every customer can be made happy. And then suddenly, everyone loves Fallout 76 üòÅ
---
It's true tough. The impossible happens, and all little wird quirks are satisfied. And I agree with you. I give it 2 weeks, and modders have 100 solutions to every single problem.
---
If it works I‚Äôd assume it was the drive and I‚Äôd replace it and back anything up that‚Äôs not corrupted. If that still doesn‚Äôt work then I have no idea lol  
---
I guess the problem people are having with the story is that it feels just off. In other Fallouts you have an interactive story with choices and meaningfull interactions. Fallout 76 feels like reading a book or listening to an audio drama. The potential is there and I myself even started enjoying it more  with the time but working yourself through a checklist  so you can listen or read  the next tape/note is nothing compared to (only one example)  all the interactions and choices you need to make to decide the fate of New Vegas' different fractions. 
---
The writing was allways great when you listened to tapes and read notes or diary entries on terminals etc. But it was the some of its parts that  made it special.
---
Definitely would love to see that! Also a game for android/apple where you can won atoms for the store!
---
Keep that hardcore survival crap in survival, yeah.  Don't water that down, absolutely.  But leave it out of adventure mode.  You want an extremely difficult experience because that's what's rewarding for you, by all means, stick to survival.  It sounds like it's exactly the sort of thing all these people complaining about adventure being too easy wanted.  
---
But leave adventure mode alone.
---
Yeah me neither , thanks 
---
Yeah it's seems you didn't clear every nasty files, I suggest you to search Bethesda in your driver file. I'm sure you will some hidden nasty files too. Maybe you must check your documents file.
---
-Scorchbeast shriek-
---
"Watch the skies, traveler."
---
why do people that hate 76 feel the urge to watch the entire stream to tell the stream that 76 sucks, trying to watch the vod on twitch is getting stuck into a logic vortex 
---
Sounds like you're in character to me
---
Source: level 102 in fo4 with full power armor and Gatling laser and raiders still try to melee me with a crowbar.
---
Where do you go then that has an increased amount?
---
Wouldn't that be a pip... 
---
Up stairs to the left the door will open at the end of the hallway is a button in a portable toilet. 
---
Though it would be fun it could make the game even more unbalenced, good idea though.
---
Because people are assholes.
---
Imagine hating people because they play a video game you don't like. That's how pathetic these people are.
---
Are you gatekeeping raiders who like to upgrade their armour? 
---
Yeah, that happened to me a lot during the Fasnacht event and was a pain to try and target enemies.
---
I see far less 2\* and 3\* in non-nuked Whitesprings and either a lot of legendaries (10+) or practically none. I'd be fine with a lot of 1\* as I'm farming for versus effects on Handmade rifles, but still, a daily 50 drops (12 hrs of gameplay) is kind of slow as a 1\* handmade has a base chance of 1:200 or so.
---
So its a toilet down in the silo?
---
This. Todd is a hell of a hype man, and it's easy to see that he's passionate about what he does. I think it was clear that he didn't have much to do with the development of FO76, and there was lot of conflicting information between him and the developers on certain features in those early interviews (i.e. stash size). 
---
I hate that the FO76 release left a lot of egg on Todd and Bethesda's face, but my hope is they've learned something and we continue to see game improvements that make it worth playing.
---
I run one chameleon piece, really not worth running more. One gives like 90% of the benefit, leaving more space for sentinel and unyielding.....
---
Or buy a PC with an ssd like a person ;p
---
I'm all for the separate modes. I just think they need to stop making Adventure mode a hybrid. They are stuck on keeping it a softcore PvP and Hardcore PvP, which is never, ever what the game was marketed as. It's left a lot of the people that came from The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series disenchanted. We didn't buy this game to be harassed by some adolescents from CoD with foul mouths and a lot of angst.
---
They could even make 3 modes. Adventure, or solely PvE; the weird CoD style PvP mode they just created; and then actual Hardcore Survival. New, locked characters, harder food and water penalties, exhaustion penalties, completely map blind, no fast travel at all, make the AI enemies just as dangerous as the other players so that you have to think twice about attacking that guy for his stimpacks and caps because you just snuck past a deathclaw before you saw him by the road. Ghouls should always travel in hordes and stop tripping just because they miss hitting you (every mode actually lol).
---
I'm not against gameplay challenges, and I do occasionally like to PvP, even if I lose repeatedly. I don't like that there are ways to force me into it. In adventure mode it should be a button press to invite to PvP, and they should have to accept it. Then make other modes for the people who want to be able to kill on sight.
---
The biggest issue I've seen is that people who begged for survival can't hack it over there. So they come back to adventure mode and pick fights with people who don't PvP so they can win and feel like they suck a little less. It's just harassment, and it's a stressful impact on the game.
---
Sounds like you want a player hub. I believe the devs are slowly making white springs into this. Making whitesprings have every single vendor there is going to make it a very player heavy spot for a one stop shop all it needs is a passive zone when you enter inside and you got a player hub ready to go
---
The shell of it is
---
Yep it‚Äôs actually an elevator that takes you to the top 
---
I wonder how communication will work if a player doesn't have a microphone.
---
I guess you're oblivious to the dozens of professional reviews and thousands upon thousands of posts, threads, and comments across various websites pointing out the issues with this game?
---
Somehow you got the perfect copy and are playing a flawless game? 
---
Stop being blinded by your fanboyism
---
They made it to where you can't ever be completely powerful. You have to choose what you are going to do. It was a good decision.
---
Yeah I try that too , thank you 
---
They should cap it at lvl 100 while still allowing double that ammount on survival.
---
The greatest story that goes nowhere
---
We had a conversation about PvP on a different post of mine lol. He just happened to respond to both. We are both adults though and can agree on one topic and disagree on the other and still be civil! 
---
Wow, that was helpful.
---
I like the method where you keep your character but it can't enter the hardcore server again.
---
Look for a poster in train station 
---
Yes! We need a true hardcore, realistic survival mode. I can't stand the dumb leaderboards. I'm hoping Nuclear Winter might give us a difficult adventure mode with some of the survival mode elements in there. 
---
&gt;But is it fun as hell? YES
---
That's very highly debatable. 
---
Thanks - hopefully I will find it.
---
This is actually a great idea. I would love that. It would be cool to see what it looks like again without having to create a new character. 
---
Honestly the equipment isn't the issue. It's the setting. If you aren't on the mode where you can attack on sight and be attacked on sight, you aren't really roleplaying a raider. Picking and choosing who you want to harass and fight with without the risk of someone else coming and killing either one of you is predatory harassment, not roleplay.
---
Great, thanks for the advice
---
Damn, I‚Äôm on PS4
---
Some up an coming YouTubers have been popping up. Here are two I find enjoyable.
---
Gamermomover50 seems like a nice lady
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsxDSa4b6H0-ABGu7KYTFew
---
Jug has some nice videos
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/PLlSKlN
---
Yes I think so. The 15% DMG reduction should be independent from the item's lvl
---
You could also see if one of the normal vendors has one for sale too. 
---
Ah nice!
---
Yea in fallout 4 it didnt have much use, but in 76, where the menus are all real time anyhow, being able to reach down and select equip on your melee while running around could be a great thing in this game.
---
since the others explanations seem a bit opaque here is a clearer explanation hopefully   
---
instancing refers to creating a clone of a dungeon for a specific group of players it allows multiple people to raid a dungeon while at the same time keeping them separate unless there in a group together 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen them anywhere since Patch 5. Patch 5 was evil. 
---
French tomahawk used to steam it a lot. You could check out his vods on twitch
---
Yeah you are totally right, I saw too much mess about it. Even I deleted a friend on game. Yeah he killed 2 level character, I mad and said to "don't do it again", after some hours, invited a 23 level to team, fast traveled him. I was angry and left team and game session. When asked him to what happened, he said to he killed him and he found good loot. It was really enough for delete him on my friend list and report for abuse. But he isn't only one on this mind.
---
Bethesda, please, if you read this, survival need some improvement.
---
I agree, but I look at each game differently much like how the protagonists of each game have lived differently in their respective titles. With FO76 you're the 'best and brightest' and come out of the vault into a world so damned strange and pretty much empty that you have no choice but to rely upon what is left for you to find, and in the wake of a global nuclear annihilation where humanity is in essence gone what do you have but recordings, notes and computer entries. Just like how in New Vegas you're playing as the Courier who is looking to change his/her world because of the choices that many bad and good people have made and you have to rely on those NPC's that are around and living in said world. In FO3 you're fresh from a life in the vault and have to learn along the way and deal with those also learning and living, FO4 you're dealing with the existential dread that is waking up 200 yrs into the future and uncertain if you can even carve out a life for yourself along with trying to find your missing son while also doing your best to work with those around you to rebuild society as best you can. IMO Bethesda's marketing of the game and then even pushing this out way sooner than it should have been is what really killed it for a lot of people.
---
‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt made by Obsidian.‚Äù Usually the main issue with some people. 
---
So silly that it doesn‚Äôt, the game also notifies you at level 5 that you can now engage in PvP but you can kill and be killed from straight out of the vault. 
---
I like the idea of a player hub of sorts, but I don't think Vault 76 is the best location for it. I really feel like the Whitespring is the best location to be a hub. It's big, well-protected, it's already got a bunch of vendors (and soon all faction vendors) and is just a generally popular place to hang out. 
---
As others have said, Vault 76 was not designed for people to live after 25 years. Vault-Tec wanted it's residents to go out and reclaim Appalachia, not shut themselves in.
---
I love the enthusiasm, however. I love the vaults. The aesthetic, the lore behind them, I can't get enough. But yeah, it doesn't make much sense to reopen 76 when the game encourages us to go out and explore.
---
Really petty gatekeeping, even. The game is set in the fucking post-apocalypse, what could you possibly expect.
---
Some people, and honestly I get that, I really do, I used to be one of those, but to say Bethesda can't write a good Fallout story is ludicrous IMO.
---
Hey OP your post implies that survival mode seasons are a Guaranteed thing while in the talk it was more of a potential idea they had 
---
And the atoms get harder and harder to get -_-
---
they said that the reason that isnt allowed is due to performance issues
---
Yes I would love to grab the perk cards I left in there.
---
IMO for F76 you must have at least Luck 5 for Starched Genes and Class Freak. There are simply too many benefits from mutations to play without these two perks maxed. Once you have them both you get the benefits of mutations with limited negatives and are free to clear rads in whatever manner you like if your build doesn‚Äôt benefit from low health. 
---
I feel ya on the doorway thing man. Assholes won't get out of the way, I just want to go finish the mission you gave me why won't you *MOVE!*
---
Be patient with glitched and crashes , it‚Äôs a great game and worth the occasional bug. Don‚Äôt be afraid to say hi to higher levels , most will just drop some plans or excess aid for you 
---
Just making available plans (in game, not atom shop) for items that were available in Fallout 4. Especially the half stairs and the "abstract" paintings. The paintings missing really annoying considering they are all over in game. 
---
And every character should have terminal cancer thanks to all the radiation, right? Sometimes realism in games doesn't make much sense, it's a game first and foremost and PvP is a central part of it. It's also a post-apocalyptic game, people being shitty and desperate is kind of the point.
---
There's a poster you find and it starts the quest can't remember where but I'm sure if you google it you will figure it out.
---
Fuck those guys!!
---
if i remember right DLC items wouldn't show as well as sometimes the wrong item would be selected
---
Pacifist is definitely not enabled, and I don't even think that's a thing.
---
Obviously a bug, as I later became invulnerable and appeared friendly to others that I was killing.  We talked on area chat and evidently it had been happening in certain places.
---
Spoilers and I don't know how to blackout. We found five doing the questline for finding the holotape fragments for the top of the world questline (heading north), and the quest before it of stealing from supers and making traps Southeast of Top of the World.
---
I have a similar build but find that speed demon and twisted muscles are worth adding. It's like an "all rounder" setup but to make it viable and effective, the extra speed reloading and melee damage is really the icing on the cake.
---
Yes!! I would love to do that, start a raider gang and rule the wasteland!
---
Add me, my gt is divided outcast
---
It is a thing, pacifist stays enabled when you enter survival unless you go and disable it. But I‚Äôm not surprised there‚Äôs bugs like that happening too.
---
It'd be cool if with Modus's help we looked into a way to restore the Vault's life support and then the vault would serve as a sort of basecamp.
---
I got this also.
---
https://imgur.com/a/MpL0q3H
---
I didn't think that the questline was active already, but I figured I would join anyway. But it changed to Event: EyeBot Horde: The Forest upon arrival :(
---
I guess the Sheepsquatch will be quite the cryptid horde, in the upcoming future.
---
Sweet! I'll add you in the morning. Btw, I'm on a new char _and_ survival mode, if that's a turn off.
---
Pacifist mode doesn‚Äôt protect your base from someone coming to ruin it. I play in pacifist in adventure mode cause I‚Äôm not there to PvP, but alas my CAMP is destroyed often
---
[They have intense power armor mods, too.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tesla_T-60_armor)
---
I roll with an all rise and a kitted lever action, that's all. So is that gonna make the lever action worthless?
---
Definitely willing to get speed demon now though
---
Yeah so I tried to remove everything I could find but when I redownload the launcher it still
---
Remember my username and favorites . It‚Äôs so strange ! :/
---
Not really. In the past 1470 drops on two different characters, 2\* drops 2\* 55% of the time and a 3\* drops 3\* 35-40% of the time.
---
In the last 470 drops on my second character, I get 75% 1\* enemies, 5% 2\* enemies and 20% 3\* enemies (luck 10). I get 83% 1\* loot, 10% 2\* loot and 7% 3\* loot.
---
What armor is best? Marine?
---
IF YOUR BASE IS DESTROYED MOVE YOUR CAMP ITLL STORE EVERYTHING AND COST NO MATERIALS
---
Got'cha. I'm kindda new to all the Fallout lore. The games have been out for years, but I only started playing them back in November of 2018, and I started with FO3. I got FO76 in December and never even finished 3, so thank you for that tidbit of insight to the lore :)
---
I wrote in the bracket that nothing concrete has been said yet.
---
So I will check on my pc when I can use my pc, maybe we can find a way for fix.. 
---
Bird watchers lookout was really cool, i just found that yesterday myself. I wish we could craft the bottles after visiting, it would freak people out! 
---
I reckon the leaderboard should be based on number of kills not time alive AND I don‚Äôt think you should be able to swap back and forth between modes with the same character as that creates and allows a lot of exploits which break the intent of the game.. but other than that I‚Äôve made a new character in survival and I‚Äôm really enjoying it a lot! Despite not typically being much of a PvP player. It brings a new level of excitement, especially as a low level.
---
Also there is a lot of glitches with the leaderboard that need to be addressed- but hey, it is a beta, hopefully they get it sorted out for the full release (fingers crossed)!
---
All good. 
---
&gt; Survival Mode WILL add a Season mode that will require news character every season 
---
Would change WILL to MAY or MIGHT i misread #5 though that my only recommendation i can have
---
It sounds like my wife wrote it
---
The mine next to Whitesprimg Train Station has a ton of mole miners who love to use the shotgun. Melee them down and you got a lot of shells that will last you a while.
---
True, but they could possibly make the hangout vault separate from the server the players start. However, as mentioned above this goes against the lore of the game, so Vault 76 isn't gonna work. But it was mentioned below that Whitesprings would work for this, and I agree with that. It just seems like a total waste of code to cut the place off after our significantly short visit. So much more could have been done with it, but I get that closing it off goes with the lore of the game as well.
---
It‚Äôs not Bethesda‚Äôs responsibility to shut down every rumor that pops up. Just like every other company, they set a schedule for when they want to make big announcements relating to upcoming content, and they do not deviate from that schedule unless the topic is either too big to ignore or too minor to matter. Bethesda choosing to not address a rumor proves absolutely nothing. Anyone that gets hyped up over completely unconfirmed information, to the point that they are legitimately angry when the rumors turn out to be false, is an idiot.
---
Thank you ! This is driving me crazy . Iam no amateur on PCs but never had this problem . 
---
Iam going to work in a bit and i will try to install the game again. Should be done when I get home 
---
I‚Äôm having flashbacks to how much fun I had in SWG‚Äôs - a feeling I thought was long gone.
---
This game just keeps on giving 
---
Most likely it would prevent you from matchmaking in most multiplayer games. Have you always had this issue and have you actually ever been able to login before? Are your network settings set to Auto/DCHP? Do you have the port number manually selected? Who is your service provider and what is your home network setup(modem to router or modem/router combo aka gateway)? Are you running your Xbox wired or wireless? 
---
To quote *Home Alone 2*, ‚ÄúDown the hall and to the left‚Äù
---
Whitesprings, Watoga and Harper's Ferry have the highest concentration of legendaries in my experience. 
---
Also if you are looking for a specific legendary effect, keep items with that effect in your stash/inventory, even if the item itself is useless. For example, you want a Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet, so keep any Bloodied Pistol, Lead Pipe, Knuckles, etc in your stash and you should see more Bloodied type items drop for you. Also try not to hunt legendaries at night because that by itself increases the drop chance for Nocturnal type items, assuming you don't want those. In addition, to be safe, do not pick up or keep unwanted legendary effects between kills as that can skew the drop rate temporarily. If you want the caps, store those items in a nearby world container and come back for them after the hunt.
---
I watch FO76 vids on YT more than I care to admit. 
---
Check out Captain Noob. Great weapon reviews and his recent streams are very entertaining. 
---
Innovsurvivislist has an amazing voice and is very informative and active in PvP (on PC). 
---
Miz Tracey has some great walk/thru videos as well as tutorials and play. She‚Äôs great to listen to also. 
---
Azkriel Gaming is getting better. His intro is way too long, but content is quality. 
---
RifleGaming isn‚Äôt a streamer but he does Nuking Experiments and posts helpful tips and walk thrus. He‚Äôs VERY up to date. 
---
Jug has great informative build videos. 
---
Final Render is another expert builder. 
---
Avoid Oxhorn and Jughead, despite their sub counts. 
---
Enjoy!
---
Agreed. I would also like to add that we should be able to pick up all the unused plastic cups at the fraternity party house. Just make the respawn timer for the plastic really long.
---
in the livestream they said it used to allow placing camps really close but was removed for performance reasons
---
I agree, but mostly because it is so easy to exploit the current system as it is, because all you have to do is jump off a cliff and then pick your stuff back up when you respawn and voila no consequences and you never get on the leaderboard. Which completely goes against the intent of the game.
---
**My suggestion would be showing a leaderboard of BOTH the longest alive AND the most kills BUT only the most kills actually show up on the map giving you their location.**
---
Combat or Power Armor? You can find BoS PA mods from turning in Technical Data.
---
If you're talking about Combat Armor, I haven't found any plans. From everything I've heard, they just don't appear in vendors anymore after the vendor patch. 
---
People claim to be able to get them from scrapping, but I've scrapped hundreds of Combat Armor pieces since the BETA, and I've unlocked every other mod except BoS and Pocketed/Deep Pocketed.
---
So, either I've got atrocious luck, or something's not right...
---
Same thing has happened to me. There is no visible timer for it, but it will go away after a long while. Relogging does fix it as I've done this before...more times than I'd like to admit :(
---
Damnit we were in the same server earlier lol
---
If someone puts a brown bag at your feet, flashes their light at it, shoots it, beckons you to it, teabags it, whatever.. that means they want you to please take it please just take the damn free stuff haha
---
To his face if I could
---
Any chance of a picture of the perks you use?

The new Brahmin milk also removes 50 rads.

Oh snap, nukes and dragons was supposed to link it, give me a few lol üòÇüòÇ

During our first visit, we're just so excited to get out there and explore the wasteland that we don't really take a lot of time to look around, especially since there's little to nothing that can be picked up from inside. Why hang around a place that has so little to offer? Almost like the devs did all that work on the place just to force us out of there by not offering much to look at and preventing us from going in other rooms. Not to mention not being able to take much of anything with us. I mean, sure we can make another character and take some time to check the place out, but with so little to offer I just feel it's useless to do so. It's just so under used. But lore is lore, and I get that. Maybe Whitesprings :)
---
Well I found the registry files and deleted those and now it‚Äôs a clean install . I need to log in and it don‚Äôt remember my username or my favorites . This give me hope :)
---
Was that in survival?
---
Make a friend with somebody that can share the rad sponge perk and follow them around for a while when on a team. This perk will remove rads randomly from a teammate when in close proximity, when the perk is shared then it works for both players. 
---
Whitesprings would work too, and is an even better idea location for this to happen. Now throw in a game room, and I'm completely in board, LoL.
---
It‚Äôs all luck unfortunately. 
---
I was playing fo76 yesterday when I found a power armor frame and 1 high leveled guy was near me, he offered me 5 fusion cores for free, but I didn't want them. I love the fo76 community. 
---
on pc at least you can see a recently played with tab and join people who arnt your friends
---
All good. It was just a bunch of really useless 1* armour. And tons of food and ammo I made too much of. 
---
It depends on whether or not you want to use stealth, semi or auto. If you're going stealth commando/sniper you'll want armor penetration, if you are running and gunning than you'll want ammo capacity. With semi you'll want more bang per bullet, so armor penetration, if you're going automatic then ammo capacity because you'll be raining bullets left and right.

---
There. Sorry, I hit share on the page and it never ported it over.
---
Whitesprings, Watoga, Harper's Ferry. Events are too rare in general as I could do 4-5 runs of these 3 locations before one shows up (Uranium Fever, AWOL, Horde events in the mire).
---
Sometimes I don't think Bethesda themselves know what they can or can't do with this game. 
---
Looks lovely! Where is this located at?
---
5. How about NO.
---
No it doesn't count cause it didn't happen on the first.........or in April. Nice try though.
---
Thank you! I'm now trying to figure if I want to do a full on stealth sniper or not. My friend recently gave me a tse pump shotgun and I'm having fun with it 
---
Ok so I'm thinking full auto with a drum, no sneaking. Making mass amounts of ammo is gonna suck but it sounds the most fun right now.
---
What about recoil? I'm thinking most encounters will be short to mid range. 
---
&gt;  Todd Howard's in-game character is "a giant man in a Nuka Girl suit".
---
dumb question‚Ä¶ aren't all characters same height?
---
No. Logged drops since early February. I got about 200 drops since Survival arrived, but since Survival is unplayable for legendary farming purposes, it is from Adventure mode. Survival doesn't seem to have changed any RNG/chance calculations so the 450 drops since Patch 7 is reliably based on the same server behavior.
---
Semi-auto or auto? Hardened for Semi, Powerful Automatic for automatic for highest dmgs.
---
Drum mag gives 75 ammo, no armor piercing (auto)
---
Perforating mag gives highest AP (15%?), 20 round capacity (semi-auto)
---
Stinging mag gives moderate AP (7%?), 35 round capacity (either)
---
Non-vats, use forceful or bruising stocks to increase durability.
---
Any of the long barrels for range, I usually use the True Long barrel for the small tick in accuracy.
---
Take Gunsmith 4-5 in INT **as soon as possible** to improve abysmal durability rates.
---
A functional game room would be cool, yeah. Something like the Caravan mini-game from New Vegas would be a neat little feature. If not that, some arcade machines with the holotape games on them would be fun.
---
This is what I wanted to know. Thank you. 
---
Decontamination shower does not work, it removes mutations, I screwed up with that one
---
I had one and traded it for a quad explosive. I didn't like the inaccuracy of two shot. Shotguns already struggle with accuracy as it is, and to me two shot just isn't as effective in practice as it is on paper.
---
I started a new character for this mode too! I‚Äôm having a blast! No way am I bringing my main character over to survival though haha!
---
And you are very welcome. 
---
I live in an empty train cart on the rails about 20 feet south from there :) 
---
Nooo, don't tell then the secrets to pa build
---
For the 5.56 for the handmade, the munitions factory actually produces 600-800 an hour (taken out at 200 increments), crafting with Ammosmith 2 you can get 36 rounds per 10 steel, 4 lead, 4 gunpowder (I think that's right?).
---
That and a shitload of jet. 
---
Honestly, a rifle/stealth/crit build can do insane damage all the time and then do even more when successfully sneaking. You'll just struggle constantly with carry weight.
---
Ha! That's fuckin' pure gold! I wonder: Did Todd actually weigh them? ü§î
---
What event was it?
---
Little of it is functional though and certainly can't be moved.
---
Haha. Nope.
---
lol didn't know it was a secret. 
---
Same here. Picked up duped items and then ended up dropping them later. I got banned during first wave, though my friend who picked up the same items (we found them in a shack near vault 76), was not banned. I got unbanned the 12th or 17th and the rebanned a few hours later... Emailed and they said I had too many items and would fix it once a solution was found. But I had a low carry weight??? No duped items in my inventory at all or in my stash
---
Clam with what? pliers?
---
If you're aiming down the barrel recoil on the handmade is highly manageable, of however you want to hip fire (I don't recommend this with the handmade unless it's with vats) then you'll definitely want some recoil control.
---
Nah mate, raiders are a group, role play is a character. 
---
Are you a trapper or a rust devil, gunner or forged, diehard or cutthroat. This is a role playing game, you can pick any role you want, including raider. 
---
Ocd is a life destroying mental condition. You just like things to be neat 
---
So what‚Äôs the best unarmed weapon? Swing speed anti armour for my standard build but what weapon?
---
For my standard build is anti armour the best with swing speed? Thanks so much for the reply.
---
It does happen and is likely due to server mitigation. One of your previous kills was supposed to but didn't get a legendary drop so the server will add that item to the next legendary you kill. Of course, as others have mentioned, some qualifiers override the legendary qualifier so you may never know that the previous diseased ghoul was supposed to be a legendary one if it didn't drop.
---
Gonna have to be a killjoy here and say while I want this too I want server stability even more so, no the game is not ready for this and probably never will be. Stability has regressed since the last patch and while we all have our wishlists of features, few people are asking for the boring but important stuff.
---
as for the events there is only a few worth doing currently either due to guaranteed legendaries or that event being really buggy and inconsistent
---
Mitigation is king. I would still wear it until you're able to find something comparable.
---
So what‚Äôs the best unarmed for me? I run a standard build so anti armour and swing speed right? But what item and 3rd legendary perk? Thanks for the reply.
---
This might sound weird but I kind want to play the Handmade like a Call of Duty AK47. Just run and gun, dump ammo down range and kill shit. 
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure but I think the rare outfits go for a lot more than 1000 caps 
---
what means they misused the term.
---
It‚Äôs probably real ambient sounds, if you listen carefully you can hear that a lot of attention has been given to the sound design of this game, small little background noises and ambient music or environmental sounds are abundant if you listen carefully. I love it.
---
Thanks everyone for all the replies. Just trying to work out what weapon now and what perks I‚Äôm sure if swing speed and I‚Äôm a standard armour build so am thinking anti armour but unsure about the third perk, maybe +1 strength. Thanks
---
Find someone who can fully mod guns your level would be the easiest. A hardened receiver on anything at your level can kill in one shot.
---
I‚Äôve never been big into a ‚ÄúRaider‚Äù character, but I love the idea and support it. If you need an extra pal, add me! The Exile 223
---
Whelp looks like survival will forever be trash. Excited about everything else tho :)
---
Woodland Warrior is darker and more weathered/dirty looking than the standard woodland from the older camo PA skins.  It looks pretty cool but it doesn't really work well as a disruptive pattern and looks black from a distance.  I bought it because of the limited time factor.  I don't regret it but it's not as satisfying of a purchase as Blackbird was.  For me, at least.  
---

Ok thanks for the detailed response so I should good for a gauntlet? What stats? Anti armour swing speed and +1 strength? Really appreciate response
---
Ah crap.  Too bad you are ps4.  I'm Xbox. :(  no closer to those precious power cores...
---
Me and my best friend have put alot of hours into fallout(over 400 each). The story is not lacking at all, it just doesn't scream at you like in fallout 3/4. You and whoever you decide to play with are supposed to interact with what you find and try to figure out the story behind everything. Him and I have found numerous locations and things around Appalachia than no one is talking about. And we'll some of it is as big as going into the enclave. If you go exploring and become aware of the surroundings you will find the "empty" locations are not empty at all. Like in earlier fallouts you may find a random note or holo tape and then it gives you a waypoint. This game you are supposed to have online interaction with people and try and figure out where the next step is on the holo tape( sometimes the flat out tell you). 
---
...and those dungeons are pretty garbage compared to dungeons.
---
Workshops are fucked up and broken beyond reason. Someone designed it to be a hub building experience, and then someone slapped PvP stuff on it later without ever listening to players or giving it a second thought.
---
End result is utter chaos. You can get ganked by a squad WAAAAY out of contest zone because *one* dude in that squad just activated that.
---
Meanwhile, defense quests periodically pop up (Including the one that starts AS SOON AS you take the place) as a world event so gank squad can instantly get a drop on you even in the survival mode.
---
And plot twist : Your attackers are not there for the workshop. They're likely market dwelling murderhobo dudebros with fully kitted out PvP gears, complete with storage alts. They just want to kill you and take cap.
---
Now you have to strategically plan out your real estate investment over some fucking fusion cores or junks when market types have "Legit" stuffs for wholesale. This is a fucking joke.
---
Please finish FO3! Honestly, it‚Äôs worth it. I loved FO3 so much, it was the first ‚Äúserious‚Äù game I played and it will always have a special place in my heart! 
---
Should it be though? If they aren‚Äôt going to allow the rest of the game to be played properly then why didn‚Äôt they just create a pvp battle arena mode. Because that‚Äôs mostly what Survival is, except for the people that keep to themselves. 
---
Mabye not a secret, but not popular it seems.
---
Companies would be in 24/7 catch up with the ways communities can spin up fake hype, buy into made up rumors or 'leaks' and the sad fact of the matter is... It doesn't work. Made up bull spreads farther and faster through communities then the plain truth can.
---
Jokes on you, OP doesn't live in the EU.
---
Executioner's is maybe good if you are not specced for that type of weapon but you are forced to use it for some reason. For example, you are a rifleman but have to switch to melee because you run out of ammo or get mobbed. I never keep these legendaries.
---
I'm also not mutated so Mutant's is completely useless for me. Unfortunately, I'm looking for versus-type Handmade rifles so I keep a Mutant's Handmade in my stash to have the Handmade drop chances increased. I get significantly more Mutant's weapons though due to this.
---
It was installed as a safeguard against people wanting to just hide in the vault, instead of doing their jobs and going out into the wasteland. 
---
Dear low level player who don't want to get killed at end of the quests, go to Adventure Mode.
---
Plans and mods do rarely drop from treasure map loot.
---
InnovSurvivalist is whom I watch for straight to the point Fo76 quest walkthroughs.
---
As someone who is chronically short of plastic for making shotgun shells, I wholeheartedly support this idea! 
---
Oh thats an exploit and its utilising internal mechanics of the game against the design of the game and against its ToS. While I totally agree its a form of cheating, what I asked about was something else.
---
While I guess we'll both agree its cheating that breaks the purpose of the game, once those items are exploited-out, their math is still legit.
---
Asking for cheaters I was wondering about things that make you for example receive 0 damage from crit headshots - in orher words not using the math of the game but math of the cheat.
---
I haven't seen such thing yet.
---
You can buy the poster for free from the atom shop. Place and interact with it afterwards. If nothing happens, write below my message so I can give you tips.

Don't you mean that idiot 'Juicehead'?
---
Why the hate against Oxhorn?
---
I mean don't get me wrong he kinda makes me feel uncomfortable, especially the skimpy settlers he has in Fallout 4. But uh you get what I'm saying.
---
Other then that I agree with your suggestions.
---
AlChestBreach is another good Fallout YouTuber too, he rarely does Fallout 76 videos but I imagine he will soon once more things come along no question about it.
---
There's also Alex Duos (Really nice guy, I was originally part of his Desert Rangers Discord for Fallout 76) he definitely has quality content and knows what he's doing despite the small subscriber base he currently has going for him.
---
And the light effect too! Almost blinding every time I stop up while crouched.
---
Nice. Do you have a video we can see? I wanna see this in action!üòÜ
---
If I were you I would drop the energy ammo perk and put those 3 points somewhere better. 
---
I'd like to see the free states get more of an important role in faction wars. I mean, they had a US Senator backing them. Id love to see any in depth stories or conflicts of most of the factions
---
What I wouldnt give to have crushed cars, piles o junk and junk walls to be placeable. I too like to rp as a scavenger and the decorative options are trash. 
---
Yep... I agree that Survival Mode sucks - and is still highly unbalanced. You don't lose minimal anything - but usually between 50% to 80% of your aid items. Furthermore, there were over a dozen times where I couldn't damage anyone and they could one-shot me... Tried this with a friend - and lo and behold, neither vats or normal combat seems to work... even when we are shooting point blank, standing still. On the off chance that I may do well... server keeps disconnecting. Really didn't think the game could suck any worse... and now, we have survival mode. 
---
I usually talk with friends in party so that is one way of blocking that communication.  
---
Second, playing with a controller is good to play the game but not good to communicate or going throuh menus. The selection wheel is kinda wierd and not being able to communicate throu text can make emotes become akward.  
---
Boring as Hell more like it
---
Killing after the event is completed is a very clever move. First you let your target to help you out and when he gets some rewards from the event, you kill him and get some of his rewards.
---
You'll want the 10% more damage while aiming legendary effect on your handmade if you can get it :)
---
How cute. :3
---
And they know...
---
Nuka world raiders had all the ducking resources and free x 01s They just don't know which is better, they're idiots, Colter had a raider power armor, what if normal power armor needs special training to use? The sole survivor is either a veteran or the wife of a veteran that could have been taught to use it, a raider wouldnt
---
savage divide treasure maps dropped bos combat arms plan
---
rare stuff though, so dont get your hopes up..
---
Yes.
---
Also there are many posts about this.
---
If you were going for a roleplaying and even dmg perspective, you could be a bloodied build and just be highly irradiated all the time, and there's also another perk that boosts strength the more radiation you have. Max evasive, ironclad for protection.
---
But even still, I think there's quite a few perks that aren't so necessary. Makeshift warrior 5, weapons take a while to break, especially once you have the weapon artisan perk and melee doesn't cost much to repair.  
---
No. The numbers are remainder multiplicative:
---
`DR remaining = DR base * (1 - reduction A) * (1 - reduction B) * (1 - reduction C)`
---
For example, a Scorchbeast Queen has 300 DR. Stabilized ignores 45% armor so
---
`300 * (1 - 0.45) = 300 * 0.55 = 165 DR`
---
Anti armor ignores 50% armor but the stacking is multiplicative as above so, continuing:
---
`165 * (1 - 0.5) = 300 * 0.5 = 82.5 DR`
---
A perforating magazine ignores 40% armor, so
---
`82.5 DR * (1 - 0.4) = 82.5 * 0.6 = 49.5 DR`
---
So you have 49.5/300 = 16.5% armor remaining which translates to an effective **83.5%** armor ignore value. The order doesn't matter as they are multiplicative.
---
With a perk card such as Exterminator (PER, ignore 75% armor of insects):
---
`49.5 * (1 - 0.75) = 49.5 * 0.25 = 12.375 DR` (95.8%)
---
but armor ignore is capped at 90% total.
---
I think the best armor ignore can come from an Anti-armor Puncturing (40% ignore?) Melee weapon with Incisor and Exterminator:
---
`300 * (1 - 0.5) * (1 - 0.4) * (1 - 0.75) * (1 - 0.75) = 5.65 DR` (98.1% ignore)

Well you see if you look at this completely unrelated thing, you'll see that Todd in fact lied about something even though what he said has nothing to do with the thing that's being pointed out. He also did what every movie or game director has done in human history and over hyped his production,  but it's bad when he does that because I don't like him. Check mate
---
[Here's mine.](https://i.imgur.com/PUuHkqb.png)
---
Hardened receiver for raw damage. Stabilized barrel and stock means better accuracy when firing rapidly. Stinging magazine is a good compromise between armor penetration and increased capacity. If you're not worried about stealth I'd switch out the suppressor for a compensator, and the short barrel will give you even more recoil control if you don't need long-range precision. When I run automatic I go with the tweaked receiver and drum magazine. I like the powerful automatic for combat rifles, but on a handmade the tweaked gives you the same base damage rating with better crits.
---
Well in the mean time I'll be grinding for enough springs to repair my ultracite PA
---
More gate keeping on someones role playing please
---
its not the amount of damage its the WAY the damage works. you arent able to be one shot by a SINGLE source of damage. however tse shotguns for example provide a ton of different damage sources which bypass the changes bethesda did to stop one shots from working. There are multiple people who have tested and found this to be the case. its why tse weapons are so useful in survival.
---
Bethesda, I am almost done playing FO76 forever. The FO76 rewards are sad and weak.
---
That makes him a fanboy
---
A quite sanctimonious and dellusional one
---
Noticed the same with my coat, usually spamming equip/unequip few times works, if not try unequip - exit from pipboy - equip 
---
Yes! It‚Äôs so much more interesting starting a new character for survival.
---
This post completely describes how I played for my first 900 hours. I used the text chat mod to find people to give stuff to. I was hoarding up gear/aid/ammo to give away at community events. And I did for the most part until the mod stopped working and I got banned. I gave away assassins/end/cavalier armor. I gave away many explosive guns. I gave away Shielded Underamor recipes. I gave away low level OP leveling gear. I gave away serums. I gave away so much cool stuff to community events and other players simply cause it's how I played. I just played Fallout 76 and had a blast. I didn't care about profit or trades.
---
Since I got banned and since literally anything thing I post here gets me hate, I don't play like this anymore. I am completely selfish. If I see your bag of scrap you dropped on death, it's mine. I would rather pick it all up and dump it somewhere no one can get it. I am enjoying survival mode purely as a way to take out frustrations. I enjoy Fallout 76 still, but I do not want other players in my gaming experience anymore.
---
Agreed!
---
Survival mode makes the game even less playable... now with even more serve disconnects than ever before, and "server not responding" during PvP battles.
---
Exiting and reentering build seems to work 90% of the time.  Have definitely needed to exit and reenter more than once though.
---
You can but you have to somewhat exploit the system using a campfire

Started last night. I'm doing okay. Mainly making soups instead of carrying good aid. Just hiding in fear most of the time haha 
---
Would you know anyone who could make a base like that for me
---
With stocks the stock you choose will effect the length of the condition bar so you‚Äôll have to find a balance between the amount of recoil you can manage and how long you want your handmade to last before it needs repairing, at mid range the recoil isn‚Äôt that bad tbh so you could afford to go with a stock that will give your handmade more condition.
---
My friend and I started new characters for survival and we are loving it! Trying to hurry through the main quest without being spotted, and focusing on survival tactics and staying hidden haha.
---
Last night we ended up 1st and 2nd on the leaderboard (as level 8s) and some level 69 in PA came to take us out at a workshop we claimed (needed that Aluminum bad). And we ended up killing this guy with a little help from a bunch of turrets and tactical sneak flanking! We stole his stuff and ran the hell outta there but it was super exhilarating and we got heaps of much needed aid from him too haha
---
Eating Pringles will make you happy.
---
Not much of a point in killing low levels when you‚Äôre a high level, not to mention rude lol. However, I did hide in the bushes as a newbie level 9 whilst a level 8 guy completed the land view lighthouse event and then promptly sniped him upon completion haha
---
How about make a double side walls so I can build walls on the inside of my house without it being brick on one side 
---
Hey guys!! Missed the panel so thanks for putting this list of discussed things together. I have a question though that I'm not sure was touched upon. When doing one of these Vault raids it's obvious its designed for a group but I was wondering if they mentioned if you can complete it solo? If not will there be a way to join other people who are doing it like a matchmaking system. Most of my friends have left the game after feeling betrayed while I trusted to Bethesda to come through and fix the issues and have been a happy dweller since. Sadly though I'm without a group to play with and still want to experience Vault raids. Thanks!
---
Yeah I was looking at radicool (more str for rads) just not sure if I need the points for missing perks. Going to switch to weapons artisan though
---
PC!
---
No sir. I use a TSE combat shotgun and Qaud Explosove double barrel. Even the people under lvl 10 in survival take at least 2 shots to kill. As someone who uses them constantly I can tell you this isn't the case and yes the damage does matter. In a shotgun if the damage says 250 that is divided by 8 because each individual pellet does not do the full 250. Even when all pellets land it isn't a 1 shot kill.
---
I'm on pc
---
Then you are doing something very wrong. The explosion adds another damage source which gives the weapon the ability to one shot. 
---
remindme! 8 months 
---
It doesn't sound much to me. Must be affected by some settings, unlike the silly background music on menu.
---
im ok with the vault dwellers using workshop when they started to get out there but then having a rad shower and PA in their secrets camps like i as a veteran player did, they were helpfull but i don't need them now
---
What system are you on?

That'd turn 76 into a co-op game as you yell at whoever has the phone to pump you full of stimpaks while you fight.

Then I suppose you should thank u/ScientistRickSanchez for keeping you updated!

"To be played properly" because the implemented features aren't part of gameplay. It's a shitty thing to do, but thats part of the environment of the game, you can't wander through a post-apocalyptic wasteland where the premesis is to survive through any means possible, and complain about people being mean sometimes

I‚Äôve been playing on PS4 since launch and I‚Äôm pretty much always playing solo. I‚Äôve met three people in my entire time who a) has a mic and b) wanted to team up. Three. It‚Äôs pretty depressing.

Well, it‚Äôs a BETA and I can‚Äôt imagine them not adding safe spawn areas and other things. So you may like it a lot in it‚Äôs current state, but it‚Äôs going to change, and hopefully for the better. 
---
Its worth itüôà i went thru the same thing bought since release date, i played maybe about 100 hrs on it n just stopped completely, i just recently decided to re-download it n start a new character n i gotta admit i been enjoying it so far, mostly knowing that theres new quest n other cool new things to do 
---
An MMO that works without being buggy as fuck :^)
---
I havent bought the cable, because from the last patch everything is working good, without a single lag 
---
This reminds of of The Dark Zone in TD1. Freaking rogues stealing my crap just as I put it on the line for extraction. Good times :)
---
I‚Äôm trying to set up a vendor shop for the pacifist thing outside whitespring and need some good defences
---
I like it in its current state, but I highly support safe spawn areas, it'd be a good way to stop the continual spawn camping, and killing people before they load in
---
I agree. Another thing to note is all the doors were not able to be interacted with, making me wonder what was behind the doors.

---
From other players or creatures? Just use elevated wood floors. Cheaper to build, floors are indestructible. So as long as you secure the stairs leading up to it
---
There are normally numerous workbenches, and tons of clutter. How would that be any different? 
---
Still buggy af
---
This comment intrigues me. SWG had me till it closed. I loved it and nothing since has given a similar feeling.
---
Now I played fo76 at launch and it was abysmal, thought I'd never go back to it and I havent, yet. At the mention of swg though, that could change.
---
So can you possibly elaborate? How is 76 similar to swg. 
---
An mmo that isn't buggy? Name one
---
Oxhorn, alexkgb and captain noob
---
I am not sure if this is an exploit. I am sure that is sucks and makes workshops that extra bit worthless however I think it may be a feature.
---
It has been reported numerous times month after month and the developers have neither acknowledged it nor taken any steps to address it.
---
Conversely 'fortifying' the workshops to prevent them from being contested without at least incurring in a hefty bounty was only 'on the nose' for a very brief period of time and again not sure how widespread.
---
In almost a 1000 hours of gameplay I have not seen anyone do that, only on YouTube videos, yet the devs scrambled to get on the Nefwagon on this one and as with TSE they put the foot on the accelerator, sped past 'Reasonable City', left the suburbs of 'Balancedville' behind, zoomed through the town of 'A Tad Too Far' and only stopped when it run out of fuel in the outskirts of the infamous podunk of 'Almost Useless'.
---
That would make it a feature, not a bug?
---
Is not a feature I particularly like either but mechanics I dislike are not necessarily bugs.
---
Start a new toon and take your time relearning the world
---
Much easier and more enjoyable to get a build you actually want that way, plus you have 50 levels to really decide what you wanna turn the toon into/experiment with different setups before worrying about respecing
---
When you pick your special card it asks you what you want to put your point in. Then it shows you cards from that category but you are allowed to pick from any use able card. It's not the game at fault that's actually you
---
It's alot better than the November/December days
---
Frame rate can still be an issue on console but there's been several QoL improvements
---
I'm enjoying my time back alot
---
I mean like playable, not like completely bug-free. Bug-free games will never be done, especially from Bethesda
---
Well you probably are on place they can't reach you, what makes it actually very clever.
---
Ew. YT clickbait. No thank you.
---
You‚Äôre mad a mod was taken away and now you‚Äôre taking it out in other people?
---
You can have a dog, just need animal friend rank 3 first. Heres a guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up97cMP7eSQ
---
I meant that you can adjust the volume of sound effects. 
---
There are some mods for it. 
---
It'll burn through a lot of ammo, but at close to mid range, it would probably be great vs swarms. 
---
Better than a 1 shot mini gun. 
---
Then as soon as someone finds your camp you can‚Äôt spawn there either and after 10 minutes your base is completely destroyed. In other words I‚Äôm actually broke and have no where to spawn for my pvp character
---
Totally unfair comment, what about the "inner raider"?   
---
Can't someone be a Raider in personality, but still dress well?  
---
Who are you to assume someones inner self on just their external appearance?
---
I wear a cavewoman outfit when I PvP, that work? 
---
Whatever someone is willing to pay. 
---
There's nothing standard here. I might goive it away. Someone else could poddibly sell it for a few thousand caps. 
---
It's not an MMO, unless you count 24 as "massive".  It's less buggy than it was (not that I ever had much problems with the bugs -- YMMV).
---
Take out 'Vault 76' and replace it with 'Whitespring Resort Interior' and then you've got something.
---
I mean...you can wear Trapper armor too.
---
If I see people go red and they are near me the first reaction I do is 'kill them immediately'. It's a defensive posture, to be honest, because I try to avoid people being near me in events to avoid the cheeky guy who gets close while you're not paying attention, rejects the event, and then kills you.
---
I would prefer the design look of concrete blocks just like maybe 1 or 2 high and then go to metal walls
---
Heh, this. I'm a massive fan of BGS but I know even without seeing any reviews etc when I buy their stuff I'm in for a bugfest. The only real difference with FO76 is due to it's online nature we have to rely on devs not modders to fix it lol.
---
not really, i stated above what i talk about in the video. the video is just there incase anyone want to watch it
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 and it‚Äôs max level 3 star. I‚Äôll give you 3k caps
---
Best armor is based on perks. Marine has high defensive capabilities against ballistic and energy damage, but the truth is those are secondary parameters.
---
Level 10 leather armor with perfect set of perks (i.e. assassin cavalier ap-refresh) outclasses level 50 1* marine armor.
---
I agree with you. It just feels like Bethesda wanted to make a game they had no Idea how to make. Of course there is an in game explanation of why there are no people around but it still feels  like a cheap way out of why the game has no NPC's except of Robots. But that doesn't stop me from enjoying the story. Bethesdas strengths are still present.
---
Perhaps Raiders could be naturally hostile to pretty much everyone, unlike all of the other factions, they are forced to use worse armor and weapons, but also don't get bounties for breaking stuff or killing people
---
Now every guy in a Nuka Girl outfit is going to be asked if they're Todd. xD
---
Frodo was on a journey to Mordor to destroy the one ring. He got to Rivendell. The end.
---
Gunners were an offshoot of raiders who also raided though
---
Most certainly playable. Lacking a dedicated healer at the moment. Survival is currently full of cheap bastards and is to be avoided.
---
It‚Äôs not that I have hate against Oxhorn. I absolutely loved his Fallout 4 coverage. He‚Äôs made it pretty clear that he‚Äôs not a big fan of 76 and despite life streaming the game for a month straight, he is rather visibly not the same Ox that covered FO4 Lore so theatrically.
---
He covers FO76 now but it almost feels obligatory. He‚Äôs covering Metro and other games and I think that his passion simply isn‚Äôt with this game as it was with 4. 
---
Believe me, there are some very entertaining and informative YouTubers that either covered Fallout 4 and gave up for the most part on 76 or simply never even started covering it. 
---
VinylicPumaGaming; AverageBaters (highly inappropriate but still entertaining), JV2017, and Petard moved on. 
---
Some newcomers showed great promise and published quality content around the games relewww, but have since drifted off. Channel 5 gaming comes to mind. Another is The Triple S League, which put together some incredible perk card build videos at the games release but have since moved on to insulting things like covering Fortnite. 
---
I think there is but a small handful of trustworthy, entertaining, and thoughtful FO76 YouTubers. My biggest piece of advice would be to not dismiss smaller channels. Some new content creators with only a few thousand subs have been putting out some truly great content. 
---
Yeah, survival does look like rust( I've never played rust). And it's obvious they didn't listen when they said they were gonna take inspiration from that game.
---
T-60 and combat armor = Gunners (who also raided)
---
X-01 and combat armor = Enclave (who also raided)
---
I‚Äôm on PlayStation but it‚Äôs a 1 star. Sorry
---
They also should add the map and social menu to the pit-boy
---
It belongs to Mole Men!
---
Then we are down to 1k caps ;)
---
I haven't noticed much difference. In adventure I could quickly go to multiple mob dense areas using fast travel and not have to worry about anyone, so xp can come at a decent pace. In survival I have to walk to each location while avoiding any train stations due to players, so the extra time walking from place to place probably takes up the same amount of time I'd spend killing more mobs in adventure. Not to mention each time I fast travel back to camp for cooking or scraping I have to rewalk back to wherever I want to go for more xp. 
---
It felt about the same to me. Though I was also doing this with a new character, and caps were hard to come by with people taking them all off you after you get 1 shotted. 
---
So excited for Fallout RP! We just need those private servers...
---
They're 0 weight now, I think. Now I hoard them and basically use them as pennies for vendors because I always have excess.
---
Are you kidding? They seemed ragged and disorganized as hell. They might control major areas but that‚Äôs just numbers. 
---
I mean they all basically wear rags, old army fatigues, masks, helmets, what does Talon Company wear?
---
Badass black combat armor.
---
What else does Talon Company have?
---
A missile base.
---
I got to like level 7 then gave up last night. I started the Nukashine quest. Obviously at to low a level ended up drinking it woke up in watoga lost all my junk due to high level mole rats. Didn't think you could even die by mole rats... I was mainly creeping around in fear and anxiety haha
---
Farming Legendary creatures in a circuit doesn't get old real fast does it.  You don't have to do the main quest at all if you don't wish to.  More quests are also on the way.
---
That would be a neat feature. Until then, I'll stick to using them to mow down the bad guys.
---
If I wanted the same plot mechanics every time a new story came out I'd still be reading Dean Koontz. Getting into his novels is like being married for twenty years and only having sex in one position. Sure, it was great when it was fresh and new, but now it's just a chore.
---
Can you not just break the walls?
---
In Fallout 4, this was handled by mods like Scrap Anything. Like you, I'm tired to throwing away useless ammo I never use.
---
Try another server.  That worked for me.
---
Sounds neat. I'd rather they add mod support first.
---
The lack of perk point freedom (i.e. the ability to shift perk points at your convenience) forces everyone into this decision.
---
Honestly my lvl 153 is a pvp build and I‚Äôve never lost to someone lower than 100 unless they have some stupid TSE build that one shots me, then again, I guess it‚Äôs what I get for not duping and playing the game right
---
Jeez man... come in, let me make you a brew, bury those irradiated clothes and find something fresh for you to wear.
---
The decon shower is to your left, behind the privacy wall.
---
I feel you; I have experienced similar issues with the 'server hopping' due to CAMP spot being occupied grotequely misfiring, said that in my case I should have known better than logging out inside the Whitesprings concourse. That was a rookie mistake and totally on me.
---
It certainly makes me not want to touch workshops at all until it gets addressed. If this is what they had in mind then I think it works perfectly indeed.
---
But for very long they didn't say a word about Whitesprings farming either, so who knows what they are thinking.
---
I still did it! Easy atoms ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yeah, I agree. I've seen the concerns with Oxhorn (skimpy settlers, his talks about "manliness" and "classiness", etc.), but I feel as though that stuff doesn't really affect his content. Watched a stream of his for the first time tonight, and while I understand why someone might not want to say, donate to his Patreon or buy a T-shirt, I feel like just watching his content is pretty okay. 
---
WidgeonTV is a good example to doing fo76 lore without the disliking attitude. 
---
Came across this behavior at the end of a Fashnact event. A player i had just gave consumables to and then freind req tried to kill a low lvl. He was lvl 90+ against lvl 8. I jumped in between them and took the shots,which did nothing to me,lvl234...and gave lvl 8 chance to quit world or whatever. I just don't get it...bullies are bullies,lowest of low. So don't make excuses about it.....if u can't play nice piss off!! lol
---
I think ive seen more male chars with the nuka girl suit than females. 
---
Somebody at Bethesda got this huge idea to pour lots of resources into Survival Mode instead of fixing key bugs that should be easy to tackle. It's poor task prioritization.
---
The wendigo fight is pretty interesting. It's pretty fast, but a fun fight. My problem is that I have to server hop (nobody should ever have to server hop) to find one in the Wendigo Cave. You'll find that most of the monsters before you reach it are harder to kill than it is.
---
They still haven't fixed SBQ. I helped take one down the other day and still got no loot for the wasted ammo and effort.
---
But it‚Äôs usually not single shot weapons, the majority of the time it‚Äôs a handmade or mini gun in which case you‚Äôre dead before you can even press a button
---
I feel the game needs constructive criticism but deserves nothing out of the shitstorm that surrounds it. Most of the destructive criticism can be easily proven unsubstantiated. When I met some of my friends and said I'm playing F76 they all started saying stories about youtube content that presented the game as terrible, but were completely disconnected from reality. An example I heard was that because nuke codes are hardcoded when one person solves it and shares it everybody can freerly nuke everything in a minute of work even with level 2 character. Umm no.
---
Whats important to differentiate here is that the work of the people who made the game and work of its marketing team are separate topic. I do believe that Bethesda deserved the shitstorm for the Dufflekerfuffle, but its on Bethesda, not on their creation, certainly rating the in-game experience based on the IRL collectibles material is a ridiculous thing to do.
---
Another problem it has is that its super complicated and people who don't understand what happened say its completely broken. I myself agree that on adventure servers players should be allowed to drop ownership of workshops and prevent being workshop-trolled if they don't want to fight over it and are on the other side of the map. But its not broken right now, it works exactly as defined and while I'd love to see a change that would make fellow PvErs experience better and lamefucks-free and griefers forced to go survival and get rekt by actual PvPers, I'm voicing my support for a particular direction of development of this game instead of saying it doesn't work.
---
Personally I‚Äôm a fan of Clowndaddy. 
---
You too, eh? It happened to me more than once. 
---
I honestly think it helps with other people identifying that there is a sneak nearby. I don't pvp myself but it having that sound can alert others thus making it challenging for those people while giving the victim of it a chance to react. 
---
Another poorly thought out "feature". Wish they would have put mods in first...
---
I agree with the spawn killing aspect, there definitely needs to be more random spawns around the train stations. 
---
As far as how much aid is dropped I feel like it‚Äôs a fair amount, although if I have 10 stimpacks it‚Äôd be nice if not all 10 of them dropped, like maybe 8 or something just so I can survive long enough to find more. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure what all you mean by balancing damage, for example I have a full Ass/Sent build and I‚Äôve been killed by pistol builds with a simple 1* Bloodied pipe pistol because they were able to get multiple crits off in quick succession. I‚Äôm always interested in other people‚Äôs experience tho. My AAE handmade only takes 3-4 shots on most people but I feel like Bethesda said they want weapons to feel more powerful and that‚Äôs an op weapons for sure. 
---
I think they should push the no build zone further back from train stations as I‚Äôve seen groups camped in sniper bases ready to spawn kill and it‚Äôs tough to get to them without getting sniped when you try.
---
Not sure it would work with the vault but I do agree that a player hub would be cool. I always think it could be kinda like diamond city so you have traders etc and make it a safe place for players to gather. Maybe even make it free to fast travel to 
---
I was wearing level 20 leg until long after level 200, until I luckily managed to snap a level 40 one thats so infinitely good I don't believe I'll ever be able to upgrade. Funny thing is I got it for 800 caps and its ultra-necessary for my build and perfectly aligned with it.
---
Legendary perks are much more important than DR and ER parameters and thats what you're getting with their levels. Level 10 godroll &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a regular lame item.
---
Your piece aint super good but its definitely worth wearing until you get something thats really better. Its main value obviously will be seen when PvEing against the ghouls, but you'll appreciate the standing bonus everywhere else too.
---
That would be convenient, but in Fallout 4 that purifier also had to be placed in water. I guess it makes sense to put these goliaths into water because they would need a large source to draw upon. I have found it more productive to place five or 10 small ones. You can outpace the production of the larger ones if you do that.
---
I wear X-01 because it has Quantum paints and I‚Äôm a Nuka fan, but I have a melee build and don‚Äôt have that infamous weapon that has become prolific due to dupers, so if you have that setup gun, then yes, you‚Äôre a griefer and there is no pint in engaging in PvP with theses players as you‚Äôll rarely come out on top...
---
I have a shitload of technical data. Going to turn them in asap to see what I can get.
---
I've been stockpiling treasure maps because they are weightless and I had other priorities. Time to use them all...
---
I truly hope these tokens aren't tradable or droppable. This would ruin the cap market more than it is already. I need my caps!
---
I do wish OutsideXbox or even OutsideXtra covered more Fallout 76. Jane Douglas is pure awesomeness. 
---
lmao... it‚Äôs funny you should mention that, because that‚Äôs exactly how I die more often that not. I didn‚Äôt dupe either, nor copied the flavor of the month. There‚Äôs a whole lot of one shottin going on in surval though. And chameleon. And everyone with the same duped gear.
---
There is no real difference between a level 50 and a level 300, except they have a larger variety of perk cards to choose from.
---
Thank you so much +karma 
---
Widgeon YT
---
you were right
---
I agree. The current system doesn't make much sense. It is only to fine tune your build really. For a game with so many builds, weapons, etc it punishes changing it up. Weird.
---
Great idea!
---
Todd please fix this!
---
Find someone to make you a BOS hunting rifle. It will come with a ton of mods. I make them all the time for my alt account characters when they reach each level tier. I'm on PC though, so can't help you. If Bethesda would unify the server pools across platforms, like Fortnite does, there would be a great deal of increased cooperation with other players.
---
She will also see you other varieties of Nuka Cola
---
Yeah that under armor bugs out on a lot of outfits 
---
Could you say where it happened? If this is a bug then its uncool enough that it should be tested until reproduction is confirmed, and a PSA message should be sent here suggesting people to go elsewhere if they want fair fights. Good repro will also make debugging and fixing it easier for Beth people. I'm a double-PCing professional software tester and can research this on my own. If I'll find the exact reproduction and then a workaround, I'll share how to fight against that. Gimme the info plz.
---
I find it funny. XD
---
it's not just headphones. 
---
You might want to indicate what platform you are on. It would help those who might be able to purchase them from you.
---
Nira wouldn't, mags kinda would 
---
Just tried it on pc...doesn‚Äôt work anymore.  Read it the comments on the vid that it‚Äôs been patched out
---
No, I can‚Äôt explain what is good cause I‚Äôm uncreative as shit and can‚Äôt do that with anything. I enjoy the game, what‚Äôs so wrong with letting other people enjoy something? Just go back to your anti-76 circlejerk on r/fallout and leave us who enjoy the game alone
---
You are correct!
---
Yes! Just to hear Biv alone is worth the DL!!
---
We do have laminate floors. 
---
In the atom shop. :)
---
The areas that makes you think there were important people there are worth checking. I noticed lots of my quantums I got from goverment buildings and offices of gang leaders. They can also appear totally randomly. I had a camp in a particular location for more than a month and recently I just found one quantum bottle by the doorsteps. Not the bag, the lovely shiny blue object.
---
The 100% success rate way would be to go to whitesprings nuka vendor thats upstairs near a bar area.
---
That is actually very easy, as people in events cannot hurt you unless you hit them (initially or back). Of course once the event finishes, the screen turns to red...‚Ä¶
---
I get your point though, yes.
---
For real?
---
\*AHEM\* MOTHMAN \*AHEM\*
---
I woudn't call it economy balance. Limiting each regional vendor to 200 caps was a poorly conceived excuse for economy balance. It was perfectly fine at launch and actually mimic'd the reality of shopping at any vendor. You buy items from them and their cap inventory increased. If you turned around and sold something to them, their cap inventory decreased. Although it is beneficial to be able to buy most plans/recipes, it was a horrible tradeoff with the 200 cap limit. It ended up turning the game into more of a grind.
---
Lets hope they are tradable and you will probably only be able to earn x amount a day. They will be the middle currency between caps and high end gear. Lets also hope you need tokens and caps to reroll gear because then rerolling gear will be a double caps sink for people that want to buy tokens and still reroll gear. The more caps sinks there are in game the more valuable caps are and a middle currency will give you something you can earn daily to trade for caps. I could go on but basically you are thinking about the entire thing the wrong way. 
---
I wonder what ‚Äúclever‚Äù things you do in real life.
---
As a PvP oriented person thats not a raider (no spawnkilling because thats Pv and not PvP, the second fucking P is still loading), who loves a challenge but does not necessarily KoS people, I agree. If your excuse to KoS people is raider roleplay, look like a damn raider.
---
I think they have been pranking us all along given the large number of bugs which still have not been fixed.
---
If that's not legendary then damm ur a RIP off
---
Pfft why cant u upgrade my raider life style
---
I‚Äôll never understand why people downvote a plea for help. If you can‚Äôt offer me assistance then why downvote and maybe hide it from view from someone who can? Just seems childish imo.
---
No other game that I played allowed me to express my creativity the way F76 does. Started my Fallout experience from demo of F1 and instantly lost my head for this universe, been following it last twenty years.
---
This happens to me all the time when  I die, but have no junk to drop. 
---
My camp is built on a hill. why? because I can't move it anywhere.  You should fix the broken stuff before you add more broken stuff.  
---
It either should do more damage, have more ammo cappacity, or at least have less recoil (due to weight). 
---
You don‚Äôt need to remove starched genes to drink serums. 
---
Armored marine helmets dont exist yet
---
Don't understand, why rip off?
---
If you are offering... that is incredibly generous of you.
---
If you are asking... good luck I guess?
---
Sounds good, please do
---
WTB
---
Just make a blueprint and switch between simple and elaborate camps depending on where you are playing.
---
I'd pay 1.5k if it has no legendary effects on it
---
Strange. Either hasn't happened to me or I haven't noticed. Hopefully someone out there has better info. Or even better a dev replys. 
---
I have one.
---
Not even that tbh
---
private servers!!
---
You pc? 
---
Sometimes I run 2 pieces, if I don't have a better effect.
---
Yes
---
Sent pic
---
Haven't noticed. See them all the time. Fwiw, I never see legendaries at wes tek, but I frequently see them at huntersville. 
---
Most locations on the right side of the map will spawn legendaries, change it up. Check out the steak house and Harper's Ferry. Or just hit random spawn locations. They're out there.
---
Thanks I appreciate it. At first I thought it was just coincidence but I always check the atomic shop before I hop in a server, not every time I‚Äôm disconnected is a new item added but every time a new items added I‚Äôm disconnected. It‚Äôs not game breaking by any means but if it‚Äôs something others are experiencing as well then hopefully it gets patched, if it‚Äôs just me then thats my luck lol, I‚Äôll still be playing way too much tho!
---
There have been several posts citing Bethesda Customer Support - including screenshot - saying that the item does indeed exist in the game?
---
I cannot really be arsed to look for them but you are welcome to do so unless you have evidence that they have backpedalled on that particular?
---
Complete agree
---
Or at least triple if not quadruple the yeild from gathering wood. 
---
I have a feeling these will not be a bundle, but sold separately.  If it is a bundle, be prepared to spend way more than 2k for it -- these aren't just paintover skins, they have added meshes on the armor.  It kind of feels like they're softening us up with all these other stuff before they put these up on the shop.
---
They could have done better. If they would allow vendors caps to go back up when you buy something, that would be a manageable way around it without spoiling the economy.
---
I'd have to check exact numbers, but IIRC, with my standard setup at 19% hp, my bloody .50 cal does 331 damage. With Strange In Numbers, it goes down to 274.
---
Correct! One you get the key, you can just go in there whenever you want.
---
I got the silver one from the crashed space station and the red one from the atom shop during a special. Not sure if it is still for sale though...
---
I went back to it when wild Appalachia started up but nothing had changed yet. Keep this place in the back of your mind, though.
---
So.. what's in Sugar Grove?
---
I actually gave a toll road base sadly I‚Äôm on PS4 üòÇ 
---
Every single sentence in this is amazing holy shit 
---
I have a prime enclave capacitor plan. Have no idea what to do with it. Pc if you're wondering.
---
For whatever reason, most of the quests like this which involve multiple item fetching don't display the target indicators until you are down to the last couple.
---
I tried this quest solo many times and never finished. I just finished it the other day because two other people were doing it. I ran around outside and collected those items while they focused on the inside. The time limit is way too low given how everything is spread out.
---
You're right, loot table for this amount of effort is awful.
---
You actually want to buy it?
---
I always find it strange when many people get major performance problems inside nuke zones and I get none. 
---
I sent you a team invite, but you declined. I figured you didn't see it, you were at Whitesprings, and I was too over-encumbered to fast travel. Then I got a party invite, and got distracted with a couple of nukes and helping another new guy level, and the next thing I know it's morning, and you're definitely not around anymore. So, sorry. Maybe we'll catch each other on this weekend. Hit me up if you see me on. 
---
They are legendarily chicken
---
Ran into the problem too the other day. Wandering around a Whitespring nuke zone for 15 minutes with nothing to  kill.
---
Seen it a couple of times myself. I figured it retired from mauling vaulters and decided to go into the vendor business. The deathclaw mob came and wasted it for not paying union dues.
---
Dude, dont be an ass. No one else is, your not cool. Be nice, or piss off. 
---
This is a great source for them. 
---
Thanks a lot.
---
I agree on your opinion of Oxhorn. Seems like multiplayer isn‚Äôt his thing and best to stay on single player only games. Seems like 76 is a chore for him so I pass on those vids.
---
I had a issue where some textures were missing at certain graphic levels. I removed the mods I was using, ran scan and repair, and magically it was back to normal.
---
It's a terrible system. I end up finding a cool weapon and just starting a new character for it, since I'll be grinding anyway to spec for it. Seems like at the least they could have an auto doc which costs caps to respec.
---
Well in survival i went in with around 50 purified water, 13 salisbury steaks, 11 canned dog food, around 20 stimpacks, 30ish radaways, 2-30 Rad X plus other varies stuff. Died twice and lost it all.
---
damage wise, i was getting one hitted by a level 130 (im level 56) i was putting 3-4 hits in to them and then i got hit once and died, a feature they said shouldnt happen.
---
TSE weapons are also mega powerful and you stand no chance against people with them.
---
Although all of this, i know its the beta and i still enjoyed it
---
The stew you get at Mama Dolce's gives XP
---
Was that a serious criticism of my comment?
---
I was simply continuing to quote lines from The Rock, as I thought it was humorous to continue the movie line drops. 
---
I never thought I was ‚Äúcool‚Äù. I know I‚Äôm not cool. I‚Äôm posting quotes from The Rock on a Reddit forum about a video game. I‚Äôm about as uncool as they get. 
---
I got them just the other day from Savage Divide and Cranberry Bog treasure maps. They're still out there since last patch. 
---
The 1 star drops from 3 star monsters is really lame. It was better when you could actually have a reasonable expectation of getting something worthwhile.
---
It doesn't effect perk cards
---
Doesn't change perks at all, will affect everything else the stat provides.
---
Add me 
---
Psn: purpleduke_15 
---
Here's to hoping that they will become viable again in the future
---
Haven't done that event in a long while but here's what I've figured out. All the events seem to have spawn tables with some swing to them. There's a minimum and maximum amount of enemies per wave and its randomly rolled every time. 
---
No, that's the Brotherhood.
---
All your tech are belong to us!!
---
But you should get rank 3 of Class Freak. Negates the negative effects by 75%
---
leave your friend alone he obviously doesn't want to play with you. 
---
You can also be on a team with someone sharing starched genes 2 and take a radaway or go through a decon shower. Just make sure it's shared first. 
---
Looking at other threads, this seems to be an issue on the XB1.
---
Ill give you 7k if you've still got them
---
Who says cheers, are u British, just asking.  Also mostly u can‚Äôt find anyone reliable to play with unless it‚Äôs a friend in real life. I haven‚Äôt found any online friends in this game that I play with
---
I wanna do this now. 
---
yea the whole "BETA" excuse is bullshit. these people have been developing video games for how long now? and something as simple as being killed before you even load in and have a chance to defend yourself somehow slips through the cracks. and to the lowlife who talked about being stupid enough to spawn in a hot zone; when you have zero caps its either you spawn right back where you were killed, vault 76, or your own camp. if 76 or your own camp are far away from the action you're fucked. get off Bethesda's dick and admit when they get lazy, otherwise you're not giving them any incentive to improve or develop a decent, balanced game.
---
the PvP has been shitty the entire time. power armor sucks, which is insane to even think about, and i get one swipe killed by some loon in a clown suit and a mole miner gauntlet while in power armor. now they can do it before i even get a shot off because of the spawn killing. such an awesome idea for a game ruined by lazy, brainless developers
---
Yea that's an idea.  I wouldn't mind paying like 100-300 caps to fully respec my character in-game. I still think it should be free but that works for me. I just want the option to do so, not having to level up 10-20 times to do so.
---
look at you on their dicks. you still got a few of the board of directors pubic hairs stuck in your teeth
---
They really need to switch the opt-in point for PvP with workshops.  In every other instance of PvP the player being attacked decides to disengaging SLAP damage at the start of the encounter.  With workshops the player who currently owns it can have SLAP damage disengaged by their attackers, it's the only time the attackers can do this.
---
Bethesda should let workshop owners relinquish ownership at any time.  At the very least have rejecting the "stop the attackers" quest from the pipboy make the workshop unowned.
---
And I‚Äôm not a dude. If there‚Äôs one thing that I‚Äôve learned from being a mother of teenagers in 2019 that plays an occasional video game or two, it‚Äôs that I stopped caring about trying to be cool long, long ago. 
---
And I would like to think I‚Äôm one of the nicer ones on here. Granted, lacking brevity but a lonesome long winded esoteric eloquence that is perhaps akin to the musings of Dennis Miller should be uncool enough to post on a subreddit about a fallout game. 
---
I can go on. :)
---
Mine has been glitched since a long time ago... when you did a Scrap all it would scrap quest items as well... they claimed to have fixed it but never did... I have the quest to craft the upgraded motors, but I can't get the motors needed to do so again. 
---
Yep. Saw him on the road by my camp so I went and sold stuff. I then went back in my camp and a moment later heard a weird noise. Went out to find Graham standing over my dead Brahim. That jerk killed my moo moo. He hung there for a bit and then walked away.   I was like, dude ?
---
Just had three dc's in twenty mins. Something is up.
---
-4 STR for example will give you -20 carry, less melee damage, etc, but doesn't touch your perk slots - which I personally think is stupid, there's very little point to most of those stat changes then. Mutations should really count, not this half-assed crap.
---
Also, Class Freak 3 is the only reason my LCK is more than 1.
---
A little confirmation bias and paranoia on your part I think. People like shotguns therefore they use them. Grind long enough and get a good one. Doesn't need to be TSE, just explosive with all perks is amazing.
---
Was it? Didn't notice. How so?
---
If you can craft, my offer still stands. 
---
Will check when I'm home.
---
Currently at work, will be a couple of hours.
---
Np
---
I've made it my personal mission to help new players. I've also had the luck of making some good wasteland friends in-game. We have a blast together, and I'm always happy to make more friends! I can make you some proper armor/weapons/etc, fix up your camp, help you get some fast travel locations, and I'm a crack shot to boot. Feel free to add me, PSN thekikibee
---
This happened to me few days ago...it really sucks. 
---
So I claimed a workshop at Sunshine Meadows industrial farm back then (just for the daily challenge, 10 atoms :P ). 5 minutes later a 240+ invisible dude sneaked into my workshop and one shotted me when I was managing my inventory. I tried to respawned at somewhere eles and still get killed multiple times all before I even load in, lost hundreds of caps just because of this unbalanced pvp scaling (I'm just a level 40 with a crappy build + pipe pistol) That's just unfair. This is not PVP at all....If you're a real man, go fight the 200+ ppl instead of bullying low levels.
---
 I believe there's a lots of ppl using this method to farm caps out there.. so be careful while youre owning a workshop.
---
Damn ok
---
I‚Äôm Australian and prone to wandering off chasing a squirrel but I‚Äôm always down to help my psn is sam_is_scibbles
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound like a healthy or fun way to go about it tbh 
---
Basically when your next playing I could come along and join your group and basically I just fire idea and try diffferent things till your happy with what your base lookd like
---
Wasn't Fallout inspired by the Operation Overkill online BBS game? Medkits, Rad-Hounds, Giant Ants, taking Rads, etc all while traveling The Wasteland.
---
Try a dense torso mod. Scorchbeasts are play things after that.
---
there are some people i sometimes enjoy playing with. they talk alot. evey minute. seriously it isnt funny. today i discovert i can't hide from them in this game. its game breaking. i quit playing now. i wonna play but from the moment im online they are there. fucking frustrating. im sorry i bought the game. 
---
Seems to be because he was banned but managed to get his account back. 
---
The game takes place close enough to south western Pennsylvania that there should 100% be an early The Pitt area if they were ever to do a landmass expansion.
---
That and the server crashing in general on Sbq fights...happened to me yesterday. I got what was probaly the best piece of 3* armor ive ever gotten off a legendary that was there, and the queen was well on the way to dying.....server crash, nothing saved. Angry
---
Maybe just play the game how you want. I wear the mistress of mysteries outfit in PvP.
---
Areas are being blocked off for future dlc. 
---
1. Game play is similar to fallout 4
---
2. Depends on where you are and what your doing. It's not hard to avoid people.
---
3. Subjective. You'll have to decide for yourself.
---
4. Yes?
---
Looks like bug to me, because I am sitting on junk pile. I have forced to move my CAMP few times, until I realize, that if I move my CAMP bench, after I place my it down, after relog, my base is gone andthis message appear. So simple solution is, do not move your CAMP after you settle down. 
---
Small base and rocket turrets
---
Yeah it sucks. I would suggest blocking them and leaving server after the first death though. Especially at high levels where it costs hundreds of caps per death.
---
Also put it near one of the outposts with the ground to air missiles that you repair 
---
Add a guest book for people to sign.
---
Because all of those will be client side.
---
For a camp what has to be saved is:   
---
(a) the location of the camp  
---
(b) what loose objects do you have around and what zyx coordinates are those  
---
(c) what foundation(s) do you have and where. 
---
(d) what is directly connected to the foundations in (c), what orientation and varient, then go what's connected to those and repeat.  
---
(e) damage values for everything. 
---
The precompiled assets can undergo quite a bit of optimisation but stuff like the camp cannot so easially be optimised, even on just the damage values alone it would take up more space
---
I dont care how many people believe that TSEs are just as powerful as prepatch that doesn't make it true. I have all damage perks fornsaidnweapon class and the demolishen expert perk maxed as well. I am not doing anything wrong. You are mistaking bloodying explosive or possibly furious explosive weapons for TSE. It's a case of mistaken identity on the weapon in question. Being as myself and all of my group use them I can tell you from 1st hand experience on the delivering end that TSE no longer get one shot a full health person that is wearing any type of armor. As I said before in survivak even the fresh characters take more than one hit to kill.
---
That's not a one shit kill so the OP is still wrong.
---
I was four years old I don't know xD
---
Is it the bird watchers lookout in the north of the map? If so I just discovered that this morning, really neat place, loved the firefly bottle lights.
---
Sometimes I put on my clown outfit with my fas'nacht man mask and run around outside of vault 76 pretending to chop down trees near new players.
---
 In that latest video Todd did mention something about them experimentin with chopping down trees and it just caused a lot of problems.
---
I was under the impression that you could pacify them?
---
Or you want to kill them for some reason?
---
T_Ronix. He's active here too u/T_Ronix
---
What do assist servos do
---
In both cases I am not looking at (or picking) strength; the first thing I did from 25 to 26 was click Intelligence, and click Gunsmith.
---
I had 1 rank of Gunsmith before, ranked it up.  Upon dump into the card interface, I find I still have 1 intelligence and +1 strength instead of 2 int and the same STR.
---
[This is my VATS Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2e145ff&amp;d=a72ar2ao0an2a32p02e60c72ic4a01sb1pd0pk0pl0pp2ps0l12lv2lk2l71lu2lr0&amp;w=pa0p80p90pe2p10ii0ij2i61if2ik0i30ia0i50lm2au2at1s72iq2pg0ph0pi0lf0lt2sa1s01em0el0c52cr0&amp;n=) i started as a pistol build with gunslinger and got rid of them for better VATS damage skills
---
My gut assumption looking at your build and complaints, you're using PA and a 10MM/Pipe pistol with either a hardened or powerful automatic receiver.
---
Mod your pistol for Calibrated or Tweaked Automatic.
---
Get an armor set with some legendary effects you want, but i'd suggest 1 of each: Chameleon, Cloaking, Auto-Stim, Life Saving, Vanguard, fill in with 2\* and 3\* with some AP regen and 20% weight reductions.
---
mod your armor with shadowed
---
i use a 1\* assassins 10MM pistol with a tweak automatic receiever, stub barrel, stinging mag, reflex sight, simply because i haven't found a better 10mm pistol, and have no problem clearing WestTek and White Springs, without ever being detected or running out of AP, and only use VATS head shots while nearly in enemies faces.
---
Torso armor mod. Can find them for every armor type. Reduces damage from car explosions, scorchbeast screams and explosive guns.
---
Total game changer.
---
Few thousand caps at most.
---
Exists for chest. Can't be combined with dense.
---
The best melee counter to reactive plates is a full health melee crit build. For some reason, the full crit damage doesn't seem to reflect. Bloodied melee is at a serious disadvantage since the last patch in survival mode
---
Can that be applied to any armor?
---
PS: That third rank of fireproof is doing nothing for you. You only need 2 ranks
---
You really only need the 1 star bloodied buzz blade. Even your 3 stars with perfect rolls don't get you much else that you need.
---
+2 Strength 
---
For more info about PA Mods: https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Power+Armor+Mods
---
The Wendigo fights are kind of funny as melee; cuz I'm strong enough to kill them in 1-2 hits, but they still don't register (no matter if I'm in wendigo cave or whitespring or any other spawn point for them).
---
I haven't had issues with loot on SBQ, but client/server stability the same as everyone else.  Granted, the SBQ loot is insultingly bad with the generally bad loot table she has in kind with any other generic 3* legendary thing.
---
I like the sonic boom, really let's me know I made a selection. I wish all the confirmation actions had that exact noise. Use a stimpak? bBDRUMMM
---
I want to be able to hang out at this location without always getting attacked, I can move around and do stuff inside the base and stay hidden but it will randomly aggro to the structure and start attacking.
---
It's my understanding that if you have the chameleon mutation it makes no noise, so my head canon is the sound is us using a device like a stealthboy to achieve the same effect.
---
See it as a Prestige system.
---
I'm a hearing person and I find that kind of shit insulting. I mean I know there are worse things regarding accessibility but it just seems so lazy and least effort. Probably because it is.
---
Why is every game post (seems to be alot lately too) about fallout 76 the exact same type of post? The game fell flat in my opinion, and was an unfinished mess.
---
Build a bar, a saloon or maybe a free Infirmary and invite people over!
---
Thank god for that.
---
One of the friendliest communities there is as long as you don‚Äôt play survival. You will often be given a lot of items by higher level players when they see you. I often leave my low level legendaries outside vault 76. It‚Äôs also very easy to get one shot on a high level enemy and another high level player will help you finish it off for EXP. Definitely pick the game up. 
---
Scratch that anyway, I forgot that 'pacify' only lasts a few minutes.
---
I guess what the other fellow player suggested is your best option: rocket turrets.
---
You will find plenty of lower-levelled players.  Also, you don‚Äôt have to team up with someone all of the time.  The majority of the content can be done solo.  Teaming up can be fun, but it depends on the players and what you‚Äôre doing.
---
It‚Äôs fine for new players... I‚Äôve been playing since beta and am only lvl 60 ish.. I take my time... I‚Äôve maybe had a hand full of issues with higher lvl players griefing this entire time 
---
Thanks I am very happy to hear that :)
---
But the game is already super easy ?
---
I agree the spawn stuff is a problem but on the other hand it makes me very cautious when entering different areas and made the very action of simply moving around an intellectual puzzle.
---
Regarding to weapon balance, I think we had some common assumptions regarding effectiveness of various weapons. I think lots of those assumptions were made obsolete with last patch and the problem is that the playerbase must realign and not necessarily with the maths. Haven't finished testing it tho so hard to be sure it aint a mess, but my current observation seem to suggest that certain weapons were given additional legendary perks penetration effects (i.e. weapon X was similarily good against build A and B and now its the same for B but it completely shreds A)
---
They do pop up very rarely in a few costume static drop sites, scrap it and learn to craft them. So would imagine if you bought one it would be the same as buying a plan, unless it carries slight risk not to learn it
---
It's looking good for the future but lets not get ahead of ourselves, we're not a that point yet.
---
I'm a field medic build on ps4. Level 35. skellyassassin, just put your reddit user in your friend request and drop in anytime. EST timezone. 
---
"your opinion"
---
Stop being the fun police and let people enjoy things. 
---
I don't mind griefing every now and again, it is to be expect with any online game. Thanks for the comment!
---
I got the flying helmets like that but as far as I can tell those cannot be learned by scrapping...
---
I agree with this. The Talon Merc company always seemed much more organized and like a band of mercenaries trying to survive. The gunners were just...well gunners.
---
I am also worried that the game would be less fun without teaming up as it has been built around online play. 
---
gunners have heavey combat armour and in some cases T-60 PA
---
Thats your fault for being careless, if you don‚Äôt like something about the game don‚Äôt play it.
---
Imbecile
---
Not just since patch 7, it's always been the case as far as I've noticed.
---
I would if I could. Gauss is a lovely gun and Quad is great for low magazine weapons that hit like a truck. I‚Äôd probably go as high as 2500, but that‚Äôs just me.
---
Ps4 also.
---
They can be, that‚Äôs the only way I got it myself, but didn‚Äôt know if the scrapping rules of discovering mods worked similar to learning costumes from scrapping.
---
Must do as I‚Äôve scrapped 3-4 flying hats without luck. Started to think they were plan only
---
\&gt; Survival Mode may get a Seasons mode that will require news character every season. \[Nothing concrete yet but they are working on something like this\]    
---
Literally the only way I'll touch survival mode. I got the game pretty late and catchup is a fucking nightmare. Survival is pretty much unplayable right now to me due to the massive difference in power. 
---
Griever*
---
They couldn't even update the pip boy app with the DLC maps tho...
---
Ohhh thats and idea. It could also make for swapping perk cards handier 
---
That‚Äôs good to hear! Sorry you had such an out of pocket experience with the last patch, not many people were having difficulties. 
---
My friend calls power fisting a door "knocking" on it and I mean he is sort of right. Right enough I figure.
---
We always help out those whose doors we knock on, of course.
---
Glad it worked out, Guess I was wrong :)
---
I have checked the esm and a far as the local copy goes - we know that the server esm can be different - flight helmets are neither one nor the other.
---
With this I mean that they are just a 'world spawn'. One cannot learn to craft them in any way, neither by scrapping them nor by finding/purchasing a plan. There is no COBJ record for them.
---
If you have the caps I will sell you it for 2000
---
Good find!
---
This is the dumbest post I've ever seen in my life. So someone should dress a certain way to kill people? Please gtfo here lol. Jesus. 
---
You said it, man.
---
Yeah man. I horde the gauss! 
---
Damn those union boys really haven't changed
---
It aint dumb if you dont play it dumb. I know this because I played it dumb initially myself.
---
Sometimes you get weird reactions from low levels too though.
---
I'm lvl 158, PA heavy build. Was doing uranium fever and a lvl 30 showed up and literally emptied an entire clip of his silly pipe rifle in my face.
---
My only response was the "?!" emote lol
---
Do you have .308 and if so how many caps are you asking for?
---
I've tried living right beside a fissure site for a acid deposit in cranberry bog. Its a bit of a drain on resources, so i didn't stay for long. Keep your turrets spread out and possibly wired up so one break in the electricity chain inst going to unpower other turrets. 
---
Found the griefer. 
---
Browse the 76 category on twitch or any other streaming site. With how the game went after release a lot of people stopped streaming or playing it sadly (I streamed it for a month but was hard to keep up with state of the game at the time.). Still fun streams around. A lot of the times it's also the 76 players in chat that make it enjoyable. Some nice people most of the time.
---
I can't today but I'd like to meet with u
---
Stop by when you can!
---
Last night I was stuck in constant danger mode, no matter where I went or fast travelled. I love stealth build but every other day it feels broken one way or another. DPS fluctuation, caution to danger being a permanent feature, full chameleon and getting spotted 100+ distance. I rolled a melee toon, last time cause that almost seems to be the least buggy build. Levels much quicker and never seems to have issues. I would love to smoothly run my stealth but just doesn‚Äôt seem feasible at his time. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only stealth suffering.
---
I will be on the game in a couple minutes, I‚Äôll let you know. 
---
Offer me
---
So like a working stealth build, no one knows if it‚Äôll work. It just does or doesn‚Äôt
---
They do. Some people trying to lowball a trade wll pop saying they got duped,but they 're extremely rare nontheless.
---
Well i hope they atleast add that when you "attack" a tree with a chainsaw or even an axe you get some wood..
---
It was absolutely my intention to live in the vault. I was very disappointed to learn I couldnt at Beta....but I adapted. Lvl 103 now lol
---
Had this happen to me during Fasnacht, I was controlling Grafton Steel. Traveled to the event and while I was loading in I saw the pop up for my workshop being under attack and once I properly loaded in I was dead instantly. Working as intended. üòë
---
Out of interest how do they actually drop? Is it just from random events?
---
I think they are still there just rare to spawn in that building near where you travel. Some plans also spawn in church. I never found the marine plans there and I always check when doing vendor runs, but I have talked to folks that have. And I think I got some other under armor there so they probably still do. 
---
Best confirmation would be someone that did find them recently to confirm. 
---
I have about 2k .308 on me but I can make a lot more if you wanted me too
---
if it sounds like a bugged or broken system it should be considered as such until otherwise confirmed
---
üëç
---
I do actually I'll be on and off all day today
---
everyone that upvoted this, be honest, how often did you use the companion app...  it's a novel idea but I don't see how it will enhance the experience.
---
Its not a problem, see you in Appalachia 
---
No thanks. You have already shown your ass plenty. 
---
If you are on PS4 I have a small letters set you can have for that alt.
---
gee its almost like fallout was never designed with PvP in mind &gt;\_&gt;
---
It Would be unrealistic as hell to Not included humans later on 
---
I have two 3*Gauss rifles if u want
---
I did a few Harper Hops several times last night and saw them there. Just unlucky bud. 
---
"Most of the time you see a complaint on here its some little millennial cuck who thinks everything should be handed to them."
---
- u/constantinelv
---
Oh I'm sorry my opinion impedes on your fun. I am just stating an observation, carry on.
---
That would be great because my brother made my character and as doing the stuff in the vault and I finally got back home and I was already outside
---
Well, let‚Äôs get real here. Who‚Äôs the one that opened the door by referencing, and I quote, ‚ÄúZeus‚Äô butthole‚Äù?
---
If there is to be an accusation of a predilection of the human posterior, wouldn‚Äôt it be the one that vividly pointed out the cavity of an Ancient Greek God?
---
TD1? 
---
Less servers but more server capacity 
---
Heck I want the table games from New Vegas back. I loved playing blackjack. Roulette and slot machines also welcome.
---
Captainoob
---
I found them spawn more often in Camp Venture and the train car west of Watoga Station.
---
I've had them spawn so many times while turning in Tech Data, I ended up dropping the extras in Flatwoods Church.
---
I‚Äôm like lvl 30 doing boa stuff with the transponders and am being hammered by like 3 of them with the dust and all
---
Just stop. I'm sorry I apparently offended you, but your not even trying to move on. 
---
I made a doorbell! Using a speaker and a pressure plate at the front door :) you can also wire a speaker to a powered gate for one that just alerts you to someone entering. Always use a speaker and never a siren haha 
---
I thought so to, then they went and pooled all the vendor caps, so you only ever need to visit one vendor, and it doesn't matter which one, so why even add the other factions to Whitesprings?  one or the other makes sense, but both?
---
Also MaCready was in the gunners for a time I believe, and he's definitely not from a vault
---
Why are you still in this sub? It‚Äôs fine if the game fell flat for you. As someone who has played all of the Fallout Games, i can say it‚Äôs not my favorite, but at this point I think it‚Äôs a solid Fallout game that tried something new which is a good thing. And two IRL buddies and I still go out in the wasteland most evenings together, something no FO game has allowed us to do. 
---
Either way, like it or don‚Äôt, but if you don‚Äôt, move on man and stay out of this sub because this sub is for the fans of the game. You know what else is getting old and tired? Listening to you butthurt haters booing from the back row. There are lots of great games out, go play one and bitch about it in their sub and let us enjoy this game in peace. 
---
Because Raiders wouldn't kill and steal the more powerful gear of their foes, apparently. 
---
I can't remember seeing it ever, and if the Camden Park vendor doesn't have plans for it, it probably doesn't exist.
---
the Vault is closed because it would be too easy for a dweller to just live there for the rest of their lives ignoring the horror on the surface, we are supposed to rebuild and having the lifeline would be too tempting for those that can't cut it on the surface. 
---
I find intellectually devoid sparring on the internet to be truly cathartic. Thank you, sir, for truly adding some entertainment to my evening. 
---
Now, how about those Wedigos?
---
How much are you asking per 1000 rounds?
---
This one time i started playing fallout 3, then I played a different game until i started trying to play fallout 3 again, but i brought fallout 4
---
I thought it was Wasteland but sounds like maybe Operation Overkill was the inspiration for that one. 
---
&gt;Disable legendary effects. These are half the problem when it comes to balancing issues. Still let us use the legendary weapons. Just don't have any of the affects active. You could still have the legendary rewards, that then benefit you in adventure mode?
---
I think we should see how the legendary vendor gets rolled out before we do this. Gear is important, and the main problem is everyone is running the same assassin+sentinel gear. We can nerf the playing field so everyone's on the same level or we can buff everyone to put us on the same level. That's what we need from the legendary vendor and I think we should wait for that.
---
&gt;Armor needs to matter a lot more. I shouldn't be getting one shot in power armor by a shotgun 100ft away.
---
I appreciate that power armor is more of a niche thing. There's only some builds it works for and I'd be bothered if it became a one size fits all thing.
---
&gt;TTK needs to be higher. This game isn't a twitch shooter. It shouldn't be about how fast you can turn around and lock your reticle on the opponents head. Especially with how unstable this game can be. Give people more time to react.
---
I think this boils down to tactics. If you know you're going into a risky engagement, you drop a CAMP in a distinct spot for a respawn point. I've had hour long engagements doing 4v4 because we both knew this tactic. If you die, you respawn at the primary point or the fall back point. If they die, they do the same thing. In survival mode in FO4 everything was tense because everything died in 2 shots. The enemies did, and so did you. You had to rely on picking the right fights and using the right tactics. CAMP placement is much more tactical now and means more than decorating things.
---
IMO, it sounds like you're trying to make PvP TTK something more akin to PvE TTK. In keeping with how previous survival modes in other fallouts worked, that's a big departure. Making this change would offload much of the intended tension that's meant to be in survival mode. I'm against this change, but I understand it's a matter of opinion.
---
&gt;The only things that should be one-shotting anyone are things with very high risk, very high reward. This is anything that does massive damage, but has a massive tradeoff (Missile launcher, Fatman, grenade launcher have to reload after every shot, sniper rifles have low firerate and need headshots, shotguns at point blank range, melee, etc)
---
I think crushing the bloodied melee meta was probably for the best. That said, melee really needs some attention because it's no where near as viable as anything else. Right now it seems like full health melee is much more viable, but it's still quite lacking. Gunslinger and rifleman builds are really hard to play with as well and that needs some sort of re-working.
---
&gt;My first suggestion is make train stations a no combat zone to help prevent spawn camping, and provide a somewhat safe area to conduct business. (Maybe make inside whitesprings a no combat zone as well?)
---
&gt;If that doesn't work, make the spawn radius for stations larger and make the spawn location randomized to help prevent spawn camping.
---
I think spawn/fast travel vulnerability is just bugged or I don't understand the mechanics. Sometimes I get invulnerability, but more often then not I don't. Not sure what's going on. Maybe your weapon has to be holstered?
---
&gt;I personally feel that owned workshops shouldn't be marked on the map. If we don't know where anyone is, why do we know who has what workshop?
---
I think ownership needs to come with risk and survival mode needs to encourage social interaction in some limited way. Events do that, the top 3 does, loot bag drop locations do, and ownership does. Even with all those mechanics, it's quite hard to run into others when you're trying to and removing more of this is essentially trying to turn survival mode into a watered down adventure mode.
---
Lastly, I think something that really needs to get fixed is the player damage debuff when you're broke. I'd make it so people on teams with a bankrupt player can't loot bags, can't fast travel to team mates, and players with 0 caps can't join survival mode. If you got in and went bankrupt, you have to earn caps to get any benefit out of continuing play and must play with a damage debuff. The amount of players I've killed over and over that keep blitzkrieging at me hoping for a lucky kill that have 0 caps is quite annoying.

Found a person who misuses word "Griefer"

The Division
---
You are probably correct but I dont now what goes into making a man made cold fusion reactor. Maybe you have a Mr Fusion strapped to it somewhere.
---
How much are you willing to trade for them?
---
I‚Äôm new to the seeking economy. Just offer me something, I‚Äôll most likely take it
---
Try stashing the set it lets you move to see if that perhaps fixes it??
---
Think it may give a fair few people a disadvantage though. I mean you‚Äôd have the timings to take into consideration, synchronisation and connection speeds will be different for everyone so using stimpaks or other aid etc. Would be unfair. 
---
Using it as a map or inventory management would be great, even objectives or a wanted list? Would have to be VERY fine tuned and would probably end up being exploited somehow. 
---
In a dream world it would work perfectly, be able to use to heal or use items etc. And be fair to everyone who plays though. 
---
And for the record, I'm a 41 year old father of five, I reference every movie or TV show I have ever seen at some point weather they be iconic or not, even spongebob. The rock had some great lines, unlike some of cages other movies. Point is, I dont remember every word of anything, especially sense I have likely had to replace that information with something else over the years. Anyway I'm sorry, let's all be both civil and have a drink. I'm heading to kill the sbq. 
---
Yeah no they are creepy. Not tough, but creepy. 
---
Haha wow, didnt know my simple view on this topic was so detrimental to your life and gaming experience. Toughen up butter cup.
---
ofc it was. You can't hurt player in Adventure Mode no longer.
---
I love when they yell: GUNNNEERRRSSSSSSSS
---
I would expect to pay more, as it‚Äôs random drops only? Thanks for answering btw
---
I brought this up when it was announced and literally got -30 downvotes 
---
No, i don't like the idea, it is no lore friendly at all. Excavator power armor was made before the great war for miners to mine, not to fly. And it wouldn't make sense because you find the plans for the excavator power armor in a locked room, which means that no one has seen it except you, therefore no one could make plans for the jetpack after the great war. And before the war there was just no need for it. 
---
250 per 1000 rounds?
---
Where did you hear that? I've never heard talk of such a thing. 
---
&gt; I am enjoying survival mode purely as a way to take out frustrations
---
Most people just have a wank or something mate
---
There's lots of low level players about. There's been a steady stream of new players turning up since the patches and improvements and also a lot of high level players, myself included, like levelling alts. You can always say hi on [r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) as there's plenty of friendly low level types there :)
---
Just curious, doesn't No Mans Sky do something similar, but keep the bases in game/on Server?  
---
Likely showing my ignorance here; but I wonder if Bethesda could learn something from Hello Games.  
---
did you miss the FO76 livestream?  the reason we can't camp on top of each other is performance
---
How about 300 each and I‚Äôll sell you 2k for 600 caps?
---
Hoohooheehee
---
Thanks :) I will go check it out. 
---
My friend is nearing level 200 so I used to just use his decontamination shower
---
Trafiic cones too, road barriers made of wood, old tires for rubber.  
---
Literally everything is made of something so if its an item in the world and not part of the map we should be able to collect and recycle
---
They could always revamp the poorly thrown together pet system. I spent a week to look for a cat, got it and in 10 minutes it turned red, had half health and disappeared while in camp. I am taking a few weeks off from fo76 after this, lol.
---
2k for 550?
---
This doesn‚Äôt work anymore it was patched out.
---
A lot of the time you won‚Äôt even be using vats due to the amount of people sneaking, a lot of people rely on vats and you can take advantage of it.
---
They need to add it to the factory, though. Every other ammo is in there!
---
Ok yea, that‚Äôs fine by me.
---
50 pounds? You can move them to a chassis?
---
I was wondering when can i get some custom raider armor paint jobs ? I call my gang in fallout 76 the ultracite raiders  we raid the scorched and ghouls to get what we need and i really want to look professional 
---
You pretty much answered your own question tho. It's not good in your opinion, and that's fine. It's fun in other people's opinions and that's fine too. Funny how the opinion thing works.
---
This is my worst experience with FO76 to be honest, we've bumped into the same players twice doing the same thing, even after we blocked them, we ran into them a few days later and they did the same shit to us.  
---
I recorded it after it happened a few times so this is what it [looks like](https://youtu.be/BOCtWf9Nev0) if anyone was wondering
---
Ok
---
Yup, so annoying. Enemy detection is broken as well, with 19 Perception I SHOULD see lots of red dots on my radar but never do.
---
Deal. I quote movies and make references that few to no rational people would ever recall. 
---
Quoting Airplane!, a classic from 1980, falls on deaf ears to people who‚Äôs grandparents might not have been born yet when it came out. 
---
When I say ‚Äúabout ten years ago‚Äù I‚Äôm always referring to 1994-1995. Time has simply passed me by. Humming along to Seal‚Äôs Kiss from a Rose and All 4 One‚Äôs I Swear as if they are still played in Casey Kasem‚Äôs Top 40. 
---
Cheers, Foe. Good luck with SBQ. 
---
I think I‚Äôm going to pop in a DVD if Cheers Season Two. When Sam and Diane we‚Äôre still a thing. 
---
Yes, that I'm aware of. But I almost always have at least a little.
---
Weird. I just played ten hours and had none.
---
You have Survival Mode, what is basically free for all and then there is Adventure Mode where everyone is protected. Somehow Adventure Mode players keep getting lost into Survival Mode, thinking that they should be protected in this mode like in Adventure Mode. They get killed and then they complain how killer is d#ck and misuse word griefer. have you not played Dayz, EFT or Rust? This how survival games work, its free for all, no one is friend, everyone can kill you.  If you expect people not to shoot at you and kill you, there mode for that- Adventure Mode.
---
It‚Äôs my wasteland, I can wear what I want to.
---
I got more wood armor I'm so lucky:)
---
Damn, what's the max level?
---
The fireplace glitch was patched out but I‚Äôve heard you can build next to a mountain and stack foundations 3-4 high for pretty much the same effect.
---
I can sell you adrenal reaction for 300
---
Really? Pacifist mode still says we can be murdered.
---
Could be used as a backdoor for cheating
---
This game is already too easy, if there was no vender cap people would clear Wes tek twice in an hour, collect all the assault rifles, and sell them for like 25,000. 
---
I‚Äôm happy with the cap limit. If you want more Hunt mutants or hunt humans in survivor mode 
---
Oh ok, its you haha. Yea sure
---
Your "simple view" is not detrimental to my life, but as my post pointed out, go somewhere else. Why are you still hanging out in the subreddit dedicated to a game that came out almost 6 months ago that you didn't like? And your "simple view" has been repeated a thousand times; we've all heard it, no need to keep repeating it. And more importantly, you likely don't even know what you are talking about if you quit the game in the first few months because it has been greatly improved since then, so we aren't even talking about the same game. Go be miserable somewhere else and let the fans talk about the fun experiences they are still having in the game.
---
Wait a second your the guy I am buying ammo from
---
Haha a real raider doesn't care what you think!
---
You can edit you comment, in case you were unaware.
---
Had that spot for awhile as a bullet farm. I had multiple missile turrets on the roof of base and was constantly repairing and fighting scorched.
---
I still wish they had the foundation glitch that would have saved alot of time and resources. 
---
Finally gave up and moved.
---
Let the PvPers decide how the mode should be. If you don't  like killing or getting killed, stay in adventure.
---
Different vendors have different stuff. 
---
The biggest problem I had was the map didn‚Äôt work on DLC areas (as I basically only used the app for a live map.) If you went to The Island or Nuka World it would just display the Commonwealth map with all the DLC area‚Äôs icons randomly on it. 
---
Youre right. I think its funny how butthurt people get over sinple things.
---
I have the same problem. Betheada blames microsoft and microsoft blames bethesda. If you plug in your headset, the sound will come back. Idk why
---
ah, right, I was only thinking about selling, nvm, carry on...
---
Any screenshot to see the difference between wearing 1 chameleon armor and 4 chameleon armor?
---
Yeah someone made a post the other day after the vendor announcement about one of the atom shop camp items having their picture taken in a white spring room. Might have housing there soon too. 
---
Because when it first launched I was excited and subscribed to the sub reddit. But you're right god forbid someone disagree with you. Ill leave. Nice community btw.
---
This is pretty true.  I've had to learn to stop leaning on VATS.  
---
Anything above level 60 can be full pvp build. Lvl 240 doesn't make any difference in damage. It just means they have had more time to farm for weapons and armor which most have multiple characters anyways.
---

Thats pretty cool, I built right above you on the cliff with the dog. Kinda sucks tho because there is no dirt for purifiers or crops. 
---
I already hunt mutants ect but I dont do pvp, not a fan unless it's a game like titanfall, battlefield or something more military. My real issue with the cap limit is the refresh rate. If your in a packed server all the vendors will be broke, all the time. That makes no sense. I kill stuff, then sell the surplus to make money. Always have. In stoked about being able to set up a vending machine soon so I can sell excess legendaries and surplus ammo. Currently I'm giving the stuff to low level players
---
&gt;Why not reopen Vault 76‚Ä¶? 
---
Because it‚Äôs sealed and inhabitable. Clearly you didn‚Äôt read the terminals within the security area. No dweller is permitted to return as we have to rebuild America, not lounge in the safety of the vault. 
---
Gatekeeping roleplaying huh
---
Well I can't really blame them, they carried these noobs through an event who are just leeching 20% extra xp. It's all fair game. It's a very realistic situation, you can manipulate people to do your bidding, and turn on them for your own gain after. If you can't hang with the big boys, you don't belong. Sorry but I'm not playing survival to babysit some noob, sure I'm not just a blatant asshole to everyone, but in survival, I will most likely kill you if I'm able. I am roleplaying a bloodthirsty murderer.
---
Is Orbweaver the software?
---
There isn't one.
---
Can confirm this. I just bought the sledge hammer plan from Grahm the super mutant vendor. I was looking for a mirror ball or stone bench from him but I saw 1 plan I haven't learned yet; the sledge hammer.
---
I would have given him a 2mm electromagnetic haircut.
---
Just got the plans for excavator armor but haven‚Äôt got nearly enough scraps to build. Is this armor worth it?
---
I mean, it's not really "free" if you want the materials for it but this is a nice initiative, keep it up! 
---
After playing another day I'm starting to see what you mean! I guess survival only works if you're encountering people around your level.
---
No you won't get banned
---
If starched genes isn't an option there is always Nuka-Grape from Whitesprings
---
I had a guy with a mic yesterday raging that I took his junk bag at whitesprings. He wouldn‚Äôt stop swinging his melee weapon at me and yelling. His junk bag was behind him on the floor the whole time. 
---
Thats what we can call "Make your own content" ;)
---
People like you are one reason for me to still play this game. Luckely my camp never gets destroyed and only get killed a couple of times. I dont need help anymore but i like to see this mindset
---
But Bethesda! We all still waiting for new content
---
I would like to see a mole miner gauntlet attachment 
---
I can see it becoming useful but can also see a possible exploit with adding a second controller to an online game that manages your inventory. And with the "security" we have now I don't think it would be a good idea.
---
I don't want a mule account I just want my level 5 melee character to be able to inherit an item from my level 80 rifle girl.
---
Would be cool to see what you have done with it
---
I got a serum from Jim last week and also got the Nuba-cola paint job for my X-01. 10/10 might visit again!
---
Yah I knew things were up for the taking, so I stashed the bulk of my aid but kept 10 stims on me. One kill and they were all gone. I thought that was a bit extreme. 
---
They recruited to increase their numbers after leaving the vault, I'd think. 
---
Or you can play in adventure mode and not worry about it...
---
I have no problem with killing or being killed. I love the constant tension exploring the wasteland in survival. But i do kinda have a problem with the spawn killing at the stations. I like getting involved in the station spawn pvp wars every once and a while just like anyone. But survival mode is supposed to be more than that I think.
---
I didn‚Äôt once say I don‚Äôt like killing or being killed. You should think about your replies more.
---
Stop by whenever you see me on!
---
Grahm is the only person that has them now. They've been removed from Vendors for some unknown reason. 
---
Because it adds a hugely fun and suspenseful aspect to an already fun game. This is what Fallout 76 should have been from the start. They would have a much larger playerbase, and not have to listen to the people whining that they never want human interaction in their lives.
---
PvP is something people like, competition is fun and gives a reason to better yourself. Games with PvP aspects have alot more replayability because humans are always unpredictable and different than an AI.
---
RPGs will always be popular, Battle arenas are very popular right now, but an RPG with PvP elements throughought (see Soulsborne series) is amazing to experience.
---
Well that is shit. And I'm level 92 and still have yet to find grahm
---
Yesterday I found some investevstion files, but not in that cabin u described it was I believe near the burning mine.
---
I‚Äôve only ever seen one chainsaw where and what even drops them?
---
It‚Äôs people trying to convince themselves the purchase was a success. I have over 100 hours in fallout 4 with every achievement but this game is like a shell of that. The lack of NPCs is 100% the reason for that. The world is empty.
---
Yeah I was trying hard to find them recently and realised that was the only way now. If you go to Charleston train station and server hop, you'll find him pretty quickly. That's where I always go when I need to find him. 
---
Just because you roleplay a style or type of character does not mean you have to look the part..... do u thing pirates dress like captain hook and have a peg leg??? Hell now, they wear polo tee shirts and carry ak 47.... how silly... sounds like you're the greifer
---
He's easy to spawn. If you own the workshop that makes food and fast travel to defend the place he spawns by the road. Works with hemlock holes and the ammo factory. Just have a friend hold him and relog till you get the plan you want. That's how I got the radiation trap plans.
---
Never said they were, but in this case they are in rather deep with the community at this point and as such are quite aware of the rumors and the desires for such content. They are aware of how critical such content would be for their game, and how quick to backlash all the "angry", "idiots" can be. Also, I'm not sure if you've ever been on the internet, but a (and yes, this is likely a bit of an oxymoron), a rather substantially large vocal minority that tends to shape the tone of most games lately are angry idiots that don't take their expectations being let down so well. Especially in the case of Fallout 76. Did you not see the launch?
---
My point is that it's more likely to have real NPCs than it isn't. Not that anything is proof of anything. So you can relax in knowing that the word "speculation" exists, and is obviously what describes this situation perfectly.
---
Ffs it's a game..escapism...sort of do what you can't in real life because...well it's not real. Generally I'm a fairly peaceful player but if I get smoked by someone I tend to think it's part of the game...perhaps some ointment for that sore vagina there.
---
Im not really sure when to find or what drops but i have 1 lol
---
I am against putting all the faction vendors in one spot. The pool combining is fine, but players should need to travel around to shop imo.
---
I know we aren't going to see eye to eye, but I've got to say: There is nothing better than someone who comes into a positive post, contributes nothing but an old, outdated, negative opinion and tells people to "toughen up buttercup" before crying about the community not being nice to them. People here are defensive because it was toxic opinions that were bringing this sub and the game down. 
---
It has gotten so much better since most of the "This game sucked on launch day." posts. Believe me, we know it did, but we stuck with it and it is much, much improved. And honestly, reread my posts, I have been respectful of you opinion, I just don't understand why anyone with the months old, "This game had a shitty launch" opinion is still here repeating it to us. It adds no value to the people that still like the game.
---
apparently slap damage was reduced to zero at the last update.
---
So if you have pacifist mode on and don't take workshops no human should be able to kill you. 
---
You can't damage them so they can't damage you in theory.
---
Haven't had that tested yet but I'm sure I would have read somewhere if it weren't working.
---
Very nice, I‚Äôve always liked that spot but it‚Äôs always taken so I built my base close by on the dam that‚Äôs just behind harpers ferry
---
Sounds like it's both of their fault. This works but now I have a wire just loose which is annoying. Every time I come back to this game something fucks up.
---
Yet you're the one who went out of his way to post about it on a thread where people are enjoying themselves.
---
Can you tell us your build and gear?
---
Agreed.  I think part of the trouble I was having at the time is that I didn't realize it was under Energy Ammo.
---
The ultracite armor doesn‚Äôt have a jet pack either. which is weird since the brotherhood scribes made it and you would think they would adapt a t-60 jetpack
---
If the game was more like this at the start, people would have been teaming up, working together to tackle the challenges. Especially with the limited respawning, and benefits from being teamed up.
---
Instead, they waited until now, when 80% of the playerbase is dried up, and the people returning because of survival are the ones who actually put time into pvp builds and wanted this type of mode from the start, or the casual players who stuck with it the whole time, but want extra xp. These same people who run QoL builds and expect to keep up. 
---
This means that Survival mode is doomed before it starts, at least if you wanted any normal or "intended" adventuring. Wait, maybe that's why we have a mode called "adventure?" Maybe they INTEND for adventure to be where you adventure, and survival to be where you survive.
---
It‚Äôs cool! Hope your enjoying it!
---
Raider aren‚Äôt they all dead?
---
If you haven‚Äôt sold it yet, may I purchase this? I know it‚Äôs been 11 days but let me know
---
I have no problem with PVP with no restrictions!
---
I have a problem with the current state of survival. As much as people like to say it‚Äôs only meant for pvp and treat it like a pvp battle area game mode. I stand by saying that it‚Äôs meant to be more than that. 
---
If you want to spawn in to instant pvp action, let‚Äôs have a battle arena mode.
---
But I feel like survival Is intended to be a hardcore alternative to the base game. And right now, you can‚Äôt even spawn in safely. Bring on the hardcore and tense pvp interactions. I want to wander the wasteland and come across another adventurer and have us both try to decide if the other guy is going to shoot first. I want the lows of losing all my aids, because that will make the high moments feel even higher. 
---
But right now a lot of the playerbase is simplifying it to a basic deathmatch mode. I know it‚Äôs not up to me to dictate what the game mode is and how people enjoy it. It‚Äôs just what I think it should be. 
---
I‚Äôve completed the game multiple times solo and still thinks it‚Äôs pretty fun.
---
As for the bugs and crashes I‚Äôve been very lucky and never really had any, especially in the past few months 
---
It had those locked rooms so maybe with gear that will give us oxygen tanks or we need to hack the air circulator, it will turn into a dungeon.
---
As someone who wants to do 100 character builds, yes please allow respec
---
I have the bad habit of joining the same server as someone I know without checking which mode they are in.
---
Must look before leaping lol.
---
I‚Äôm down, will replace this comment with my list when I get a chance to log in. My kids watching the telly box atm.
---
Unless you can delete SB before they destroy your base it‚Äôs not worth it no amount of turrets are going to help. 
---
Well I agree with the spawn camping part. It is unrealistic, poor sportsmanship, and I believe an unintended aspect. They meant for the invulnerability to save you long enough to find some cover, or make some distance. I think it dosen't last long enough to cover some people's long loading times.
---
I know I have been killed before loading fully in, I couldn't see anybody or move, I could only watch my health deplete as the game struggled to fully load me in.
---
It is unrealistic for the reason, if you killed someone, they wouldn't be back seeking vengeance, they would be dead. Gone from existence.
---
I wonder if people would like or dislike a type of survival mode where you were booted from the server upon death. Like a softcore hardcore mode. Maybe you can't rejoin that same server for 30 min or so, since you may have friends you want to play with. 
---
I have checked and I can still craft it if you are still interested.
---
Wait, people you team with can alter your camp? That sounds really awful in 99% of cases.
---
I think that just about did the trick getting it posted mate, well done. 
---
This is a regular issue with biv apparently. Not encountered it myself. I‚Äôve had some latency with him recognising my successes, but he always comes through in the end. 
---
I also see him walking through whitesprings fairly regularly. 
---
I definitely would agree from a stability standpoint.  Borderlands is rock solid in that respect.
---
But as a single player game, Borderlands is pretty tedious.  People who complain about bullet sponges in 4 and 76 don't understand how bad it gets in Borderlands.  And in Borderlands 2 especially, the game had an annoying habit of trolling the player, either by undermining its own mechanics, such as that projectile that would instantly deplete your shields and x% of your HP), the fight-for-your-life mechanic where enemies immediately run away, or quest design that was fully aware that it was wasting your time (more so in Pre-Sequel than 2).
---
Fallout 4, by its nature, had to be a better single player game and I think it successfully adapted a lot of Borderlands' looter-shooter mechanics and free-wheeling approach to combat, which transitioned into 76 fairly well.
---
And it also fits looking like a Raider too, the Marine arm might be a bit too much but overall looks good, if you can get a Heavy Robot right arm you'd look like a Rust Devil boss.
---
So they added to his camp, didnt delete the existing parts? Makes more sense. Can also make moving camp harder.
---
Sounds like a plan! 
---
And Vertibirds. Don't forget Enclave Vertibirds.
---
Yeah, the Gunners couldn't find me at 50 yards when I was picking them off one by one, but the Talon co ALWAYS knew where to find me!
---
I think a huge reason is that people are bored, these people whom are spawn camping hardcore, and generally being toxic, are the same people who would follow you around in adventure, harassing you with slap damage, or workshop exploit to murder, etc.
---
Welcome to survival mode?
---
Yeah. If you've got pacifist mode on, slap damage is gone and you in theory can't get hurt. But you don't have to have pacifist on in Adventure if you don't want, and normal rules still apply.
---
I've only tested it in as much as, when I've accidentally been shot by people at Whitesprings, in the middle of a ghoul party, nothing has happened to me.
---
If I remember correctly only the user will hear the sound...
---
Absolutely 
---
Disagree. 
---
I agree. But I think it‚Äôs better to talk about the things they need to address. Rather than everyone smugly saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs a pvp mode‚Äù and moving on. It‚Äôs a BETA after all. It‚Äôs going to change a lot. 
---
You may have rejected the "quest" to retrieve your loot at some point.
---
What they really need to do is make spawn points no kill zones. With the way the game loads where you take a while to get control but you load in, random loading in a small area won‚Äôt really stop camping. 
---
Cant get on right now. Ign so I can add.
---
Truth
---
"TALON COMPANY!"
---
"I want his one's head on a fuckin PLATE"
---
"TheeeEEEERE you are..."
---
Yes I still have them
---
I dont think its the best by any stretch, but we're all entitled to our opinions. If you keep an open mind with it i think its a good game. Theyve ironed out all the gamebreaking bugs and added plenty of QoL features. The lack of NPCs im not crazy about, but past that I can play it like any other single player fallout, so thats a big plus. Its decently fun with others too.
---
Somebody tried to do this to my new alt after a Fasnacht event. He was level 50 and I was level 20. Boy was he surprised when I slapped him back, then 2 shotted him in VATS.
---
I just feel bad for them to be honest.  Imagine having the low self esteem to need to attack people who can't fight back.  They likely get beat at home and this is their projection.
---
You can‚Äôt get banned for that...
---
So VATS doesn't work if you are sneaking or the opponent is sneaking, or both, or something else ?
---
There isn't... But anything above 55ish is kinda meaningless. Hit points, damage, etc. don't scale with level, they scale with special, perks, and gear. At 50, you've maxed your special, can use the highest level gear, and have access to every perk.
---
I have a new toon, level 15 now but I still enjoy running around on my 187 unarmed nurse to punch people to death.  Though I have to get like 10 kills to equal one death, despite all my enemies can one shot me from range with pipe rifles lol
---
You do know, if it's in adventure, they hit you, and you initiate back, the first shot you deal doesn't do full damage right...
---
There seems to be a problem with the sneak attack quest. Had this happen to me once and have seen other posts about it. Relogging usually fixes it, but sounds like you've been dealing with it for awhile. Might be worth a ticket.
---
ps. When this happened to me, removed my chameleon armor stealth multiplier perks before logging just  in case, not sure if it did anything. 
---
That I‚Äôm aware of, sneaking negates vats I could be wrong 
---
Lol sorry to necropost but jesus dude face facts.
---
The Razer Orbweaver is a one handed keyboard controller for use with mouse and keyboard games.
---
The software used to configure and manage all recent Razer mice, keyboards, and controllers is called Razer Synapse. Synapse 2 is the version for the Naga Epic as well as the devices I have.
---
https://www.razer.com/synapse-2
---
It requires a creation of a Razer cloud account to store game and controller settings, although some controllers can store the settings internally too.
---
If you need to remap and configure your Naga Epic mouse, Synapse 2 will allow you to do that.
---
I did this one yesterday except it was vodka. Went outside of Big Al's took 10 steps crouched down and sniped a weak scorched. Bang. Complete.
---
PM-d you IGN.
---
If there's a weekly survival challenge to do events, I'll probably do as /u/giant_key does and go on area chat and hope for the best. That's out of my comfort zone but maybe talking to people will help.
---
hahaha! thanks i strive:)  With biv though, this has been a while. ill give it another week, and a little more patience than i do reddit.
---
So your going to try karma farm this since it got into hot?
---
Having server hopped hundreds of occasions, notice the same usernames at specific times. This suggest as with many online games, Fallout 76 probably joins the closest available local server. This means at certain times there is probably only one or two available! So unfortunately if you quit that particular game, there is a high likelihood of either re-joining the same server or one the 'griefers' frequent. 
---
If the player(s) continue to 'grief' either report them, or ask for an ally on this website. So at a particular time you have back-up! The community did self-police the servers, so if those individuals start to cause trouble, check the map for a high level player and ask for assistance. No guarantee, but the majority of players are 'good' people. 
---
I'd love some red ant lager but have not found the recipe yet.
---
People still play this?
---
I agree, no mention of violence, drug use, nuking the world, etc.
---
In survival? Low levels shouldn‚Äôt be in there
---
I wave at people when I see them. But I‚Äôm fine with them ignoring me. Long as they don‚Äôt start shootings at me (and the fact very rarely does anyone attack me is why I wave rather than sneak). And I encounter a decent amount that wave back. But yeah, I party chat so I am silent in game. 
---
Of course not, it's posted ironically to mock you sheep.  Next question.  I farm downvotes on this shit sub
---
If you just need a sledgehammer you can find one in Whitesprings at the clubhouse spawn next to the bus. Right behind you when you spawn is a vehicle and in the back there's a sledgehammer. 
---
my player is all max out sneaky too, hmmm so try to remove all the chaemelon and the cards, reload game and give it a 13th try?
---
Check my post history if you doubt
---
What platform you on? 
---
Ole Biv E Ridge
---
It‚Äôs been almost continuous today. So many disconnects since survival went live. 
---
You on now? Add me - klirbyni 
---
Funny thing is, when I mentioned this during beta and later as well, I was always downvoted and told to not engage in PvP if I‚Äôm not prepared. 
---
It‚Äôs not pvp to stalk the person holding a workshop until they stand at a vendor, have a teammate contest the workshop and one shot him/her. 
---
And people that do that will never go survival mode at this is so much easier to earn caps. 
---
...What's this all about?
---
Also on XB1X-- I had the same problem.... if I plug a headset in (you don't have to use it), the sound comes back.  
---
Not that I've ever been able to hear another player.... but at least the sound works that way.
---
Might be worth a try, like I said not sure what got it to work again. Luckily after that first time, I've never had a problem with the stealth quest since
---
do you wear chamealon armor and have sneak cards in?
---
Ill be whomever I want, and look however I want. Thank you very much.
---
DCG or PF
---
honestly the community is around 45% solo people 45% team people and 10% who we just avoid 
---
that said finding a team and friends is pretty easy I've made since day one well over 60 in game friends I play with when I choose to and run solo when I'm doing a mission I want to lose myself in the lore the majority of people are very friendly to new people their is a few RP raiders but they are few and far between and with the new pacifist upgrade no one can hurt you unless you decide to pvp and soon your camp will also be unable to be damaged so if you don't want to pvp or worry about such things switch it on put your feet up and relax 
---
What fast travel location is next to the Lemonade stand? I forgot where I found him. LOL
---
This worked for me as well... removed all my armor (chameleon seems to be a common factor), hopped servers, and then did a sneak attack; finally cleared for me. 
---
P.s. I do have chameleon mutation on and that did not hinder my ability to complete the quest after the above steps. PS4 
---
Thanks.  Just wondering because i got the Hard Lemonade from a Lemonade Stand out in the world.
---
Tired of people role playing as a nurse with a chain saw but instead they are geared like a vats crit build
---
Thanks man 
---
Gunners have satellite comms and are extremely powerful soldiers from a vault, meant to create super soldiers. Talon Company ain‚Äôt shit
---
Don‚Äôt use one that you crafted. I did mine that way. I got the quest but I already had one on me so I used that and it worked. Maybe it‚Äôs only bugged with the crafted ones?
---
No pls stop griefers
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5e365cb&amp;d=l71li2lt2la2pk1pr1pl1pp2p01pf0pd0c81s01sg2ib1a72a12au2an2ir2&amp;w=eh2cu2&amp;n=
---
Agreed.
---
Some dude tried it on me, traveling back and forth around 3 times before giving up.
---
Ah but you don't - it's not until you're about lvl 80 to 90 that you can clean up the mutt build that you need to level up to 50 and can start a focussed perk set. Unless you're a second character who's been twinked to the eyeballs, you need a lot of random perk cards early on in order to get through the tough times in the 20s of ammo and med shortages. 
---
still trying to get a slice of that from that food dispenser... 
---
Fallout ... the game in which you permanently bend over ? LOLz
---
I am most likely going to buy it for PC, why you ask :)
---
I'd be fine with it if you could only do it a few times, and it would cost a perk point/ level each time for a total respec. Or even 1000 caps, but it seems like it punishes you for not fully planning out your character, with not alot of room for exploration.
---
wait, what? Mountaintop bar? Well i know what I'm doing this weekend. \*fires up xbox\*
---
Who says you can't be a successful raider?
---
i actually found one yesterday too and was like why not. It was one of the 2 i tried in morgantown, the other i crafted. Tried them there to see if proximity to Als had sonething to do with it.
---
Nice ! I have my camp near there too but in the mountain side , I can see the train cars from my house :) love the spot and usually when I log in there is 2 megasloths spawning so my screw supply is always full :)
---
Thanks for all the info I truly appreciate it!
---
"It just works" would be a great start.
---
Idk then, that is super unlucky. I‚Äôd definitely submit a ticket. 
---
Most merc work for money. As a level 5 you have none. So your looking for people to protect you for free but they could actually make 10c everytime they killed you. Your character is acually more valuable dead then alive. Play adventure mode. That is all.
---
For now the fix is to server hop when it becomes contested. That's only option presently available. But if everyone does it the practice of others hunting you will end.
---
Cool story bro 
---
+1 for this. Can‚Äôt leave a vendor with 1 cap. Take a bobby pin. 
---
üò≠ no.it's.not.    LOL
---
Or they could make significantly more killing the high levels that try to constantly grief me üåö
---
That good to hear. I was worried about game breaking bugs but I have mostly heard that Bethesda is fixing bugs and working with the community
---
It depends on whether you‚Äôre revived after or before the grenade with the stranger, it‚Äôll kill you (or hurt pretty bad) if it‚Äôs before. I‚Äôd test with the timing a bit 
---
ohh yeah I'd rate its buggyness as a solid 7/10 maybe a 9 if hackers were on but now most of the bugs I personally run into are pretty minor only get ejected from a server once in maybe 4-5 play sessions and the other stuff I've mostly learned a work around for 
---
What does awareness do? I've never tried it. 
---
I like that too. Everytime you rank up you can do a full respec or get a card. 
---
I would like to be able to craft it my self
---
not killable? i want to challenge you and proof you otherwise
---
Thanks. I dont have Synapse 2 which is most likely the issue. I will install it when I get home from work. Thanks a ton for the response
---
I have a lvl 45 tse prime minigun I'd part with for the right price
---
I'm sorry, wish I could help. 
---
And Assaultrons. That Gunner Assaultron on the Mass Pike Interchange was my first Assaultron fight and it repeatedly handed my my laser-crisped ass. 
---
Always enjoy seeing a good Harper's Ferry bridge base. üëç
---
Watch it on YouTube instead.
---
They didn‚Äôt do Pittsburgh justice the first time around. 
---
Ok, without the stranger perk. Would last laugh stack with grenadier &amp; demolition?
---
Would also be cool if you could sell/trade/ exchange your unwanted perk cards.  So many charisma cards and I only play solo anymore.
---
I considered everything you said until you used the TSE phrase. You obviously haven't done much research into what is meta in PvP. This also leads me to assume that your build is less than optimal, and possibly even geared towards QoL perks like weight reduction.
---
That's what I'm saying. As a SW Pa native, the Pitt was a huge letdown. We need a reimagining.
---
I will be getting  on soon. My psn is warriordls90 
---
Every online multi player game has a bunch of punks. You found one. A server hop will stop that. You will lose your junk but there's lots of junk and it's a good idea to store most of it in stash. Just bulk to save space.
---
I saw a new player just yesterday, level 3, walking around the starting area. I gave him some food and sent him on his way. So mostly friendly, yeah!
---
The Raiders would like to have a word with you!  
---
They probably determined who gave them to him, and made sure that they never got a TSE weapon or decent loot ever again, and always logged them in to a special server where Whitespring is picked clean of everything, and all the ghouls are level 9-22, and always drop cracked bowls as loot.
---
Kinda like me.
---
Good for you. I‚Äôm level 105 and still got stomped by TSE shotguns, so it‚Äôs not level based. 
---
‚ÄúBath‚Äù 
---
(It's only in FO76 so don't worry about missing the old games, in FO1&amp;2 nothing stops you from entering old vaults. )
---
U.S had missles to didnt win vietnam...
---
Oh Luna's tail do I wish we had that option... my plants are so fickle for growing too, seems the ash heap isn't the most awesome place for a farm ;)
---
Amen thank you very much. I guess just swing speed and +1 strength with anti armour or instigating I guess
---
Honesty you do you, you can kill any level in Survival and that's point but please people stop spawn killing. I've lost 2k caps from people spawn killing at Whitesprings Station and it just sucks. I know you probably don't care about this random dude off the internet but you're making other people's gaming experience less fun.
---
Oh wow yeah I'd be way down with that. 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
The first time I played FO3 the Talon Company was like the boogeyman, appearing every time I fast traveled to attack me like they were out of a nightmare. The last time I played FO3 the Talon Company was a handy combat armor delivery service, appearing conveniently when I fast traveled so I could slaughter them and repair my badass black combat armor with their own. 
---
Killing a level 9 for caps is low
---
They also mentioned how someone made a post about nuking the fasnaught parade immediately after it started....  
---
Im sitting here like... oh.. dear
---
Very much so. Hard aim with a lever action it drops em like flies
---
If you're on PS4, let me know and I'll hook you up. 
---
There is a short period of time you cannot be damaged when you spawn. If you shoot it ends. But that should allow you to hop servers. Your camper event may have been before that was added to the game.
---
Awesome just let me know when 
---
Serious question, how did you find the ending ? I thought it was shitty, since you literally have a "click this button to decide if you're good or bad", with all your previous choices making little to no differences.
---
   (I was with a super mutant, who's fucking immune to everything in the last room, I asked him to push said button since, you know, it's to prevent his own kind to be wiped from Earth, and he answered "I cannot interefere with your destiny". lolwut.jpg)
---
If you liked it anyway and can pass upon the graphics , try FO1&amp;2, they are AWESOME.
---
Shoot em first then try vats youll be suprised with the results . theres plenty of ways to counter sneak nust gotta find em first
---
spawn killing is always a dick move
---
This.  Even better when their idiot posse shows up and tries to gank.  It‚Äôs a bit amusing.
---
What‚Äôs not amusing is a team of lvl 75+ that plays the same card(s).  I may be lvl 150, but those are the groups or teams I watch out for.  
---
because my friends and I love to help noobs, if you do buy it on PC hit me up ... my in game name is wheeldogz .. we'd love to have you join us for some play sessoins sometime. You'd have some instant friends ; )
---
I mean if he was continually spawning at a station, that's on him. It's a public spawn point and there's often PVP action. Keep getting killed at a station? You've always got your base as a safe haven. Spawn killing him at his base is a dick move on your part though. 
---
I hope Bethesda fixes it soon
---
I found the plan for the bos chest piece plan in a foot locker at the black mountain ordanance works and also the arm plan at camp venture in the level 3 lockpick room in the main base area this was just before the last patch, I haven't seen them at vendors ever maybe I was unlucky there.
---
level 20 chainsaw has a static spawn in the kennels behind the ranger hq in the cranberry bog.  it has a low damage so it's not that useful for high level creatures. or even medium level creatures.  very hard to kill scorchbeasts with it.
---
Sometimes 
---
Haha yeah one star mutants always run ! I even had a legendary suicider mutant running away yelling : retreat, run away ! It was hilarious 
---
I don‚Äôt know how to link another sub, but you should check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals. I‚Äôve found some cool people to play with there. I‚Äôd join you as well, but I‚Äôm on Xbox. Good luck out there!
---
If the world collapses for real a lot of people are gonna be in for a lot of hurt
---
I lay people out with my LMG, Vats is not an option die to how fast in consumes AP
---
As a level 210 I can tell you it will only get worse as you become more of a target. The higher your level the bigger target you become. I do not take workshops anymore, even when I love to build 
---
this would be so incredible. and I stress IN GAME. more build assets that already exist to find in game not buy in atom shop.
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem getting killed when I know it‚Äôs a mutual interest in PVP.  Although it hasn‚Äôt happened to me much recently, the problem I have is getting ganked while minding my own business, like crafting materials or the like.  Again, now that I‚Äôm leveled up (150) it‚Äôs not as common, but every once in a while some slappy with their powerfist or gauntlet will try to sneak up and gank and that usually ends badly for them.  
---
It hasn't happened to me, but I've seen it happen to other players, and it really annoyed me that there wasn't a way to avenge the poor guy 100 levels below his killer without getting a bounty on *my* head (if it was even possible, since the aggressor could easily go into Pacifist and be completely immune since they aren't Wanted for this action).
---
Thanks I will probably install it too night, if you get a request from username with zfruit somewhere in there it will be me :)
---
&gt; I am roleplaying a bloodthirsty murderer
---
Strange how 99% of the population to leave the vault in survival mode has the same idea
---
public "mailbox" to leave stuff would be HUGE.
---
:D
---
I think they'll relase a patch to fix all the bugs when deep down in an underground bunker under BethSoft Todd is running a team of minions to hide double the bugs in every patch to keep us on our toes.
---
Hardly a new word, you're just behind
---
Do chainsaws go to level 50?  I wouldn‚Äôt use it as a main weapon. More of something different when I‚Äôm low level areas, similar to how I use a dagger at the moment.
---
I kept having it happen ...rinse and repeat until done.
---
Its mocking some post from yesterday saying that if you roleplay as a raider you need to wear raider armor and raider power armor or your just a griefer.
---
This is true for real life since the only thing that seems to stop people is the current consequences for doing such a thing, not that I agree with it, but its true
---
Do chainsaws go to level 50?  I wouldn‚Äôt use it as a main weapon. More of something different when I‚Äôm in low level areas, similar to how I use a dagger at the moment.
---
One game's end game is another game's begin game. 
---
I‚Äôm gonna jump on this but I‚Äôm PC, I also lost all my caps because I tried out survival for a minute
---
It's always epic to see high level players helping noobs, keep up the good work!
---
Logging in now
---
Not just not fixed, but fixed bugs coming back the very next patch.
---
Tbh I'm used to the walking, I did a no fast travel play through of skyrim and it's lucky Bethesda seem to have nailed the environments of their games so walking has never bored me.
---
It really doesn't take so long to walk from one end of the map to the other.
---
Nah I love all my junk and it's come in handy for myself and my team-mates on countless times whenever we have needed to repair anything 
---
I think I have an extra one about to log in 
---
Well, technically speaking, high levels shouldn't be in there, people should start a new character for survival. The Bethesda guys even mentioned this yesterday that one of the reasons people were allowed to take their characters over to survival is because they are already super OP and they could find ways to balance them now as opposed to waiting 3 months for people to get up to those levels again
---
No one cares about bullies who can't hang with their own levels so they pick on lowbies though.
---
I won't be able to log on for about an hour or two... Can I catch up with you later? What's your tag? 
---
And Gamma guns. Oh, and Gunners can be legendary which means explosive combat shotguns or miniguns.
---
You're trying to get in without getting a bounty
---
I‚Äôm like mid-level, but sure!
---
&gt; perhaps some ointment for that sore vagina there
---
Literally the worst people Ive encountered in this game thus far have been women
---
Protip I love to make these but they are a PAIN! The cooking oil is set to scrap (like harden masses were) so once you pick up cooking oil NO MORE SCRAPPING! till it's in your stash box.
---
No worries it's not going anywhere. I'll message you my GT.
---
Cool. Much appreciated!
---
So can you engage since he shot you? Should have lit him up if so. 
---
It's the beginning of Skyrim in the cart. Took me a minute too
---
Not sure how that works. Question if breaking the walls would be worth it. How much ammo would it take. Or how much damage to weapons. Then in my camp defenses would kill you if you didn't take them out.
---
There‚Äôs nothing fun or strategic about spawn killing.   It‚Äôs either a glitch or poor design or both.  
---
It brings out the idiot and tool element of the game.  Congrats Bethesda.  Now all you need to do is adjust the gameplay slightly and it‚Äôll be a decent game mode. Until then, I‚Äôll never set foot in Survival.  Losing 300 caps a pop (spawn kill) is stupid and frustrating.   And there‚Äôs nothing challenging about it. 
---
I seem to recall when he was giving his very first talk about Fallout 76, he made a very specific point of saying "As we all know, sometimes it doesn't *just work.*" 
---
So I mean, I feel like not only are you wrong, but you're specifically wrong. 
---
Perfect.
---
Agreed, plus higher levels offer you a lot more flexibility to play different roles/use different loadouts, beyond that crucial optimization.
---
This is awesome! What platform?
---
But their clothes! 
---
I just wanted to add that at Todd has actually mentioned this in the new fallout panel, and hearing them address that had restored more of my confidence in this getting resolved!
---
I wouldn't even mind if it wasn't that much bigger as long as I had more budget! and yes to all of the assets!!! (and not from buying it all in the atom shop.) I mean for example glass wall options and greenhouse pots/tables etc. floors, walls and decoration assets that exist in the current game but we can't use. stairs? fences? a few really home feeling things to mix in. a mailbox to leave stuff and get stuff from players maybe with a guestbook. maybe a vendor bot that can record messages on a terminal and dispense stuff, idk.
---
the new quest lines for DLC aren't bought in the atom shop so why can't buildable camp items (not free streamers and decorations) be free content too?  I didnt even have budget for the new brewing benches at my camp.
---
Ok Tipper Gore 
---
The amount of unmarked locations on the map is stunning. I'd guess there are at least as many unmarked as marked...probably significantly more. Except for vendor runs, I don't fast travel anymore and I try to take a new, circuitous route whenever I'm headed in order to see areas I've yet to trek through. 
---
That I haven't seen everywhere at least once already is mindblowing by itself as I've been playing since a week before beta ended and I'm level 151 with &gt; 500hrs in. 
---
From an ROI perspective,  I'm literally paying just a penny or two per hour of entertainment.  I dont think in my 30+ years of gaming that I've ever reached such a mark...and it continues to get content. At the risk of being redundant, mind blowing! üòÇüòÅ
---
I believe the dev's nerfed everything to make the game harder instead of making new content. People have said there were complaints about players using a tse to one time ghouls during blast zones and not sharing the loot but that is just bitching at best. I have one tse, and the damage was dropped by 300. It was my last resort weapon and not I hardly use it. As for the workshop issues, I have owned three at the same time and no one tried to take them after the pvp mode was created. Before that I got bullied a bit by high level players but I started to carry an anti armor dragon or a fatman to deal with them. The players that demand pvp, bully low level players, and whine that they are not getting their fair share of loot, and complaining about the game being easy are also the same people that spent weeks farming blast zones for hours on end. They complained about the tse until they got one then did the same stuff they whined about. 
---
PC :) 
---
I have reported this before and it's been an issue since launch. 
---
There's no way to really prove it but it seems to happen every time to be more than than coincidence. I also benefit from actually experiencing very few disconnects unlike some. Back before server stability was improved, I was getting 6 hours uninterrupted regularly, so a disconnect was unusual and noticeable.
---
I have had it happen a few times: I literally checked the atom store, gone and played for a couple of hours, got a disconnect and went to check the atom shop and seen an update was pushed to it with a new item on sale. It's too much of a coincidence that I believe updates pushed to the atom store cause disconnects.
---
You cant survive survival alone if you dont have your camp mobile :(
---
Just shows weaknesses, i swap it for sniper perk card most of the time 
---
Here‚Äôs what you should do: check the Harpers Ferry building, then go the the C2 bunker and finally check the train between NAR and Watoga Station. I‚Äôve been able to get all the plans: Marine Helmet, Wetsuit, Torso, Arms. For some reason I just haven‚Äôt been able to find the leg plans yet. I‚Äôve probably tried all locations around 70 times.
---
Note: when you see or hear no enemies around Harpers Ferry, for someone the chance for a plan in that building seems to be lower. 
---
The platform could be useful 
---
The base is neat. But I get triggered when I see the decon arch that's always on. I usually set up a switch to only have it on when I need it. That's a tricky space and you've utilized it nicely; even snuck in some water purifiers in there. 
---
That's all it can take though in real life, it all boils down to this one moment, one decision that can seal the fate of the wasteland possibly forever. Ultimate power placed in your hands, the power of good v evil
---
I posted I am xbox
---
I'm sorry for any potential emotional or physical abuse you've suffered friend.
---
I feel like I had a chainsaw at some point that was higher than 20 but my memory is not what it used to be.  we had a thread some weeks back about this. I'm not sure what the conclusion was because I lost track of the thread.  
---
wait till summer
---
Exactly!  That‚Äôs how you should play Survival. 
---
Camping out at a train statin jacking fools while they spawn in and can‚Äôt defend themselves is weak.  
---
I'd like better control over how I place things. I made a bar counter out of shelves but because they can't snap together and don't snap to a grid I can't line them up perfectly. 
---
Why did you delete your original reply that said you did it because this subreddit sucks? Not brave enough
---
I‚Äôve been hoarding cooking oil. One day soon I shall release it upon the wasteland. üôÑ
---
Yep.
---
are you starting the silo now? or are you fixin to launch soon?
---
No self-respecting Raider would wear power armor to PVP.
---
I am at the silo about to forge through it
---
Sometime in the past few months, it feels like they added some kind of cooldown timer to legendaries. It also seems like Glassed Cavern only resets once/week maybe now, instead of daily - so there go all those sweet sweet stimpaks and fiber optics! (Boss scorchbeast still resets as usual though.)
---
The frat house you have to investigate for the nukashine quest. Theres a room decorated with nuka cola items and wallpaper, on a shelf in that room theres one of each variety you can pick up providing someone else hasn't looted it first, safer than whitesprings if your at a lower level but not there a 100% of the time. Your other safe bet is the nuka cola factory the enemies there are low level too.
---
Check in the weapon bench if you can upgrade it, it may be a different weapon I'm thinking of from Mistress of Mysteries though.
---
Glowing meat pile mod, wait for it to decompose, easy find.
---
If you had a 3 star legendary rolling pin as the only item in your loot table, you‚Äôd be running away, too. 
---
Xim Apex.......
---
They also spawn at the Drop Site #2 just northwest of Watoga. I found both the Marine Armor arms and the wetsuit there. I also found a set of Marine Armor arms at Harpers Ferry, so yeah they still spawn there. Just gotta get lucky.
---
Any quest that gives you an item gives you a leveled reward. I just finish getting my second character to 50 and this time I didn‚Äôt do any quests up to 50. It was kinda a pain but at least I‚Äôll get some better rewards out of it. 
---
because when it is about kills, most of you are going to be passive and then there is no way to compete in other categories like:"Most events completed","Longest survival","Most exp earned", because there is no way to find those player in leader board top to end their reign. With current implementation, people can't just sit on top of leaderboard, longer you sit the harder it gets.
---
I got a TSE level 10 rifle I plan to use this way ^^
---
I keep it on because I sometimes swap to a biocommesh torso for when I'm looking for players
---
I kind of assumed biv was a quiet drunk like me  üòÇ but your right, I was struggling to hear him and I was relying on the subtitles
---
Enough people snatch bags that you can't blame the guy though - like this one knob who required rescuing at Whitesprings in a blast zone, so I went out of my way to help him, but died as I killed the last glowing SOB. My rescuee promptly scoops my sack. Then whines like a bitch when I destroyed him with my TSE, even though he wasn't fighting back. (No, I'm not some min/max bloodied crazy, this was just pouring a ton of ammo into this jag).
---
Your fine, no the first person
---
alright man, I will friend you back if I see that. Then you can join me anytime you see me online and I'll introduce you to people if they're on :) 
---
Yeah but my problem with that is that takes up around 1-2% of budget when knocking is free
---
There was a point in time earlier in my FO76 adventures where some were complaining about being ganked at SBQ events. They were pissed and bitter because they burned up ammo and time and effort and someone got the drop on them.  My experience was the complainers were usually lower levels that probably weren‚Äôt there for any reason other than to leech higher level rewards from mostly 100+ lvls there going the actual fighting. 
---
It‚Äôs the same feeling I had when I saw a lvl 15 camped out behind WS golf club with their turrets and missiles.  Either play straight up or go farm another area that‚Äôs more your level or experience. 
---
I lived in Flatwoods and other less challenging areas until I properly leveled up before adventuring to Watoga and the SE part of the map.  
---
My melee can break walls pretty quickly, but you are right. It‚Äôs not worth it but it‚Äôs still doable if you really wanted whatever was behind it
---
So are the Gunners the real American Patriots or what? Nothing screams American dream like explosive miniguns and murderbots all with a healthy dash of idk wtf I'm doing.
---
üòû sadly no video. Will record from now on just in case. Although I feel like the planets aligned for me on this one haha.
---
Nice! Do you mind posting a pic of it for me ? Thanks!
---
Welcome to New ButtTown! 
---
Alright 
---
Nice edit
---
Now if you want to summon groups to hunt you its best to be the leader. If you want to be the leader now, you just gotta make sure noone hunts you down, and there are only three players you are incentivised to kill. This way, I dont have to do stuff I dont want to do, such as spawn-killing people, and still get to leaderboards.
---
Otherwise, I'd just have to kill everyone in sight.
---
If on the other hand I'm currently just looting PvE, then I can take precautions, such as controlled suicide in my camp, and remain invisible. Its good the way it is.
---
That extra 20hp isn't going to make much of a difference.  You're better off speccing into luck and grabbing serendipity.  
---
You do know you cant actually see the level of the other player during the event? And when the event ends if i try to see the level they kill me. 
---
Since this was discovered a while back I've only been taking workshops for Challenges and then server hopping to remove them. They are pointless anyway, you can get far more materials looting places and mining then a workshop will ever give you.
---
Think I found the discussion about it. Search is my friend apparently. Thanks for the info.
---
Lucky!
---
I still use my t51 and I‚Äôm level 119. I just prefer its look
---
Lol I don't think Todd like when the community manager said that
---
Hey I have a spare! I can hand off. I will be on whenever so feel free to message me for pricing or whatever
---
I have read posts from the dev team claiming the servers cant handle more stuff in them and that's why they limit us doing this or that. But if that's the case then why have so much crap no one can use in the map ? 
---
Having higher endurance means higher health, allowing nerd rage to activate higher up. I have 51 HP when nerd rage kicks in, I wish I had a few hundred.
---
Not necessarily, the OP could have been doing a workshop defense and had a high level show up an kill him at the end.  Though in that case, I only consider it worth a "fuck you" if after you respawn away from the workshop with no intent to fight for it, a team member hunts you down again, because they actually have no interest in claiming it, just griefing you the only way they can in adventure mode.
---
That's fine, the systems could all shut down but the vault could be left open? 
---
t51 has the highest ballistic resistance 
---
No reason for it on pc atleast 
---
Exactly, but you should be able to use the t51 ultracite and put the same paints on it right? I'm not sure what Bethesda is thinking
---
Oh thanks. I'm sure players were really waiting with bated breath for pheakelmatters' official rules of how to play a video game. How helpful of you to honor us with your rules.  
---
Let me guess, you are one of those people who moan about "griefers," but applaud people who destroy camps built behind the golf club at Whitespring?
---
Just make one I‚Äôll link one I‚Äôve made‚Äî&gt;
---
Is that ultracite or regular
---
Regular
---
Yo, what‚Äôs up with that naked dude?
---
I got to level 45 before I really decided to try out a power armor-less melee build and it's going to take me 38 levels to get readjust my perks/special. It's just nonsense. Instead of making me want to play more, it's making me want to play LESS. 
---
Huh. Didn‚Äôt know that. I put the nuka cola paint on it and loved it so much I still use it
---
Then why isn't ultracite t51 stronger? 
---
I did uranium fever, Wes tek and huntersville
---
On the way!!
---
I have absolutely no idea 
---
Thanks for ur advice. That's truly a helpful tip !
---
Maybe they'll open up access to the guest rooms?
---
Access‚Äî&gt; deny ‚Äî&gt; Profit
---
That is the million dollar question...
---
If we could use our phone to go through inventory and stuff rather than be super vulnerable, that could be cool. It would be really useful when stuck in a corner by ferals and in need of rad meds. If we could hack and lock-pick using it, then even better. I still want to know who the banana was who decided we should need to exit several times to get out of a computer interface.
---
Perhaps take a second look at it...its come a long way since launch! I'd honestly say that FO76 is now more stable than any of the other FO titles. Its added a lot of QOL changes, mostly well implemented. I'm unaware of any uncompletable quest lines. Of course,  YMMV. 
---
Doesn't slap damage not do damage anymore? 
---
Omg, no. No, absolutely not.
---
You are not the result of ONE decision in your life. Let's say you raped a girl but saved a whole bus of children from the flames, are you bad or good ? 
---
And it doesn't change the example I gave with the mutant : why can't I tell that invincible beast, who pledge allegiance to me because I saved his life, to go and press that button in my place, since it's HIS destiny that's in the balance, but I CAN ask a random human girl to do so, because "she would die" ?
---
That's lazyness and bad writing in order to give a sense of "you had three options", when all doors give on the same stupid thing.
---
Noone's life is decided by a single moment. I really hope you're young to believe that cause if you're an adult it's scary.
---
When I first heard there would be no NPCs, I got a little nervous. Got 76 for Christmas and thought I would try it. I have been hooked since that day. Haven't played any other games since then.
---
The human element really makes it for me. I love when "raiders" show up to bully me and my mates. Then you turn around and meet a guy who hooks you up/ goes partying with you. I have had non stop fun and can't wait to see how it grows.
---
Thanks OP, couldn't have said it better :)
---
So what your saying is you don‚Äôt care?
---
I want a player hub, with housing, and the ability to obtain "Lovers Embrace" buffs if we sleep with other players.  Of course, the last suggestion should also be accompanied by a new set of possible diseases. STD messages like "You have contracted the Nuclear AIDS," "You now have Rotten Crotch," or "Your balls fell off."
---
They do have paints for excavator and ultracite.   One each currently. 
---
See that's my point. They set up all of this power armor, they make different ones have higher resistances, but you would think that ultracite and x01 would be the strongest. So why not come out with cooler paint jobs for ultracite and excavator? They are so commonly used and they look like my daughter painted them
---
Bahahaha no kidding!! 
---
Ok so here‚Äôs the thing, this was not my base getting destroyed. This was my friends base, and he didn‚Äôt want to move it because we all spent hard work building it. And if we blue printed it it would be almost impossible to try and place it somewhere else because of how we built it. 
---
Nigga
---
great story, would have loved to see this.
---
Thanks for the information haha, I‚Äôll keep that in mind thank you
---
Chameleon armor + grenades is a fun combo in Survival, especially when you're hidden about Vault 76 and rain them down on respawns / FTs.
---
Thanks for your suggestion ! I always save my junks into my stash box :D Actually at that moment I was going to put them into my stash but unfortunately I got back stabbed before I can even build a stash box :'(
---
When you‚Äôre sitting on the front porch with a cold beer in your hand, watching that sun sink low in the sky. You‚Äôll take a deep breath and think "yeah..... that‚Äôll about do"
---
The Somerset special is from Final Departure WAY early on in the game. I think you are thinking of the Voice of Set
---
THAT WAS YOU!?!
---
I think I understand your argument to ‚Äòhow else can you end their reign‚Äô but I raise you the question ‚Äòwho cares?‚Äô  Or even how about a non-exact pinpointed location forcing constant map checking?
---
When it comes to leaderboards , IMO the game should be fair first and foremost for leaderboards to mean anything at all.
---
But fair enough, i can see now that some players like you do care about that stat.
---
If Bethesda want to keep this particular leaderboard they should at least widen the pin area to not be an absolute disadvantage to builds that rely on the jump or stealth. Right now it‚Äôs just so precise and forces map checking and ruins stealth gameplay for me entirely.
---
In fact I was so excited for survival but now, meh. I‚Äôll keep playing eso and wait for vanilla wow until I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm playing on a timer waiting for inevitable death the moment you get up to go to the toilet 
---
My issue with making the Whitesprings the player hub it that its constantly getting nuked, more than prime fissure now or anywhere else. If they make it safe inside from the radiation and other effects of being in a nuked zone, and gave you a safe way into the building when the area is nuked I'd be fine with that location.
---
Heard every single one of those in the game voices.
---
Can confirm, you get it as a reward from doing the Biv quests. I got it as a drop a few days ago!
---
So thats why i can't place my camp all the time.
---
My guess is your camp stays until someone who built there replaces it. Also don't forget they want to extend the PvP protection to the camps. 
---
I don‚Äôt really understand how this would work either. You‚Äôre going to be getting so many ‚Äúyou‚Äôre camp can‚Äôt be placed on this world‚Äù messages if they are persistent. 
---
Yeah and they fuckin ugly as sin! When people asked for new ultracite paint, we didn't want a step backwards into prototype paint (everyone complains about yellow excavator so why the hell would you make yellow ultracite?) When people asked for new excavator paint, we didn't want a dark turd with red highlights on it. I'm talking Camo, Nuka Cola Quantum, BoS paints, because what's available is no bueno.
---
Any player hub will be nuked heavily by trolls your already safe inside from nukes all they would need to do is make it so you fast travel to  the inside and problem solved 
---
I got one from the SBQ yesterday...
---
Exactly why I was looking forward to survival and the removal of slap damage, it gets rid of toxic assholes like this from adventure mode.
---
If you are using mods, you need to keep the archive list updated to the current list Bethesda have set it. Go to the mods and read the description and stickies on the comments page.
---
Nah, it's cool if you have a regular friend to play with. My girlfriend and I constantly add stuff to each other's camp that the other might not have plans for. Super convenient.
---
I have the opposite of this problem. I've never made it past lvl 40 on four separate characters because I get thirsty for a different build and different areas of the map. 
---
Ha is that a good or bad thing?
---
Where did you get that information.  I feel like I missed a tape or something now.
---
I like it, could grow like glowing fungus to make a load of radaways or something 
---
I'm not sure you understand how the reddit buttons work, when you think something isn't appropriate for a subreddit or a thread, you are meant to downvote it, sortve a community bullshit filter. We don't think you're negativity belongs on this positive thread put up by a very kind person, so we downvote you, this isn't an abuse of the downvote, we just don't think this thread is the place for such negativity.
---
I think it was dropped in place of a legendary item.
---
&gt; I don't care what level you are. 
---
I mean, it doesn't hurt being 50 levels above your opponents...
---
 Let me  Play with you w your Xbox name
---
Oooof. Unless you really love chainsaws.
---
It‚Äôs the journey, man
---
Yeah I think the game is generally perfect the way it. If they make any changes including releasing dlc, I‚Äôm going to quit the game. 
---
Controlled suicide is not good the way it is! Do you even know how that sounds? Some people hate immersion breakers and that‚Äôs just a ridiculous workaround to an easily fixed issue. Just have general area to 100m so at least some audio-visual cues ingame rather than looking at a cruddy childish map (could‚Äôve worked fine on the pip boy let‚Äôs be real) with no animation. God I hate that map. 
---
This is the best post on this sub I‚Äôve ever seen. Creative and would be awesome to play. Throw in this little wrench though...play on survival also lol
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue. Have you found a solution? 
---
LOL. Possibly, I guess.
---
I need to level a few low level characters and wouldn't mind running around with a few other low level folk if you want to group.
---
I'm betting you haven't even played, or at most played for a short bit after launch? Maybe you should give it a go again. Its come a loooooong way since launch...more stable now than any other FO title, IMHO. 
---
If you do give it another go, slow down. Dont try to power level. READ the notes and terminals, listen to the holotapes.  If you do you'll find some very good voice acting and very deep and rich lore, expanding and extending all the lore that came prior. Try walking to your destinations, dont use FT. There are at least as many unmarked locations on the map as marked. 
---
Give it a try with fresh eyes, you may be surprised. 
---
No they disappear when you log out, I play in the same room as the wife and when she logs out her I watch her camp go with her too.
---
They plan on raising the volume in the next patch 4/9.
---
also if you see a high lvl run up to you and start jumping and aiming a gun at the ground look down they are trying to give you the paper bag at their feet generally with random items they don't need you might find useful 
---
I do recommend to leave voice chat on even without a mic and to switch pacifist on moment you leave the vault it will stop you having to worry about players since 0 dmg to pacifist if you hit them or they hit you so no accidental pvp lols also lots of low lvls are in game and around 50% are high lvls making new characters so you should have company if you want but solo or in team the games fun 
---
I think the terminals in vault 76 say that all the life support and eventually oxygen systems of the vault would be shut down about 24 hours after the message was received to exit the vault.
---
That's interesting. I am usually solo because of trust issues.
---
Yo, what‚Äôs up with that guy playing piano in front of you?
---
The end game is the friends you make along the way.
---
This makes much sense, for I have lost bag recently looking in areas I was supposed to have died in
---
Unless they start private servers, not gonna happen. You will have people grief the server's by building camps, then leaving. You would probably have hundreds of camps in whitesprings. It's just not logical for them to do that, as your camp needs to o deadpan when you leave so you don't clutter it. 
---
Yes but this is changing. 
---
I'm level 86 and usually drop the weapons, ammo, armor, and chems I happen to have on me that I dont use for the lower level players. Usually fly solo and dont trade, people try to get you to trade all the time and to me its annoying. If I do an event, or see a lower level player getting their ass handed to them I usually help clear the enemies out then drop my surplus loot tho some of it they cant use due to their level but it can be sold or traded with other players. It's a habit I wish more people got into. When the game first came out there were a lot of online bullies playing this game but they have pvp servers now and are less frequent. I know people like to trade for caps or gear but a level 1 does not have much to offer me usually as they cant offer weapons or gear that can beat mine. And helping another player for free is never a bad thing. When I give someone stuff I just ask they pay it forward later on and help someone else. There are more people than me doing this, and it makes the game more fun for everyone
---
It's not deleted, check again.  Maybe you should learn how reddit works.  If you're using your messages panel to view/reply then only the one you're replying to shows up.  If you're using your phone, it will bring you to the main post, as well as the one reply you're replying to.  
---
X01 has the highest radiation resistance. Ultra cite was experimental so they probably never perfected it
---
I really want a full set of raider armor 
---
Ive restarted 4 characters so far, the game itself is kind of sketchy on in-game info as far as perks and builds but the player base is knowledgeable and friendly enough.
---
Yes it's an absurd rare chance at the end of events. I farmed for three weeks for them and none dropped. Ended up buying 4 from here.
---
Amen!
---
You're still not convinced how much better the game is now versus the launch?
---
Serums, have both the positive and negative effects. You can mitigate with perks, but there will always be a negative effect if applicable. 
---
Wow you really stirred up the stingwing nest.
---
Thank you! 
---
Some fallout 3 style alien weapons would be great. I hope they do a zeta type dlc soon
---
Civil war era dress?
---
The intro to the game for new players makes no sense now. You overslept? There are level 300 players outside. You might exit just in time to watch a nuke get launched. Were you in a flipping coma?!
---
I'd like a safe player hub, but I think the game can't cope. If you've ever fast travelled to Whitesprings and played the bungee cord spawn game\*, then you'll know why.
---
 \* *appear* to arrive at Whitesprings, then see how far you can get before you *actually* arrive at Whitesprings. I once made it all the way through the shopping centre before I spawned outside by the robots.
---
I can not confirm, but I am thinking it was based off of "A boy and his dog"
---
I noticed today that if you have a beverage given to you by Biv as a reward and the next quest is to craft that beverage you can just give it to him right away and complete the quest, 3 days in a row now I've auto-completed the quest thanks to keeping the reward beverages in my inventory üòÅ
---
I've also started hording rum, whisky, vodka, and wine for those "get drunk and do something" quests. 
---
Incidently does anyone know how many actual recipes there are? 
---
They give you the negative affect and (afaik) the then suppress all negative effects for 1 hour
---
I mean I kind of understand about ultracite being a prototype. I do. But it shouldn't be weaker than regular t51b. I have no qualms with the x01 armor btw ( because I can actually use different paints on it already) 
---
Serums give you the mutation and suppress the negative effect for an hour. After an hour the negative effect returns and it will behave just like a mutation gotten naturally. 
---
I got 1 from a treasure map and 1 from a found plan only last week.
---
They should make Flatwoods, Harper's ferry and top of the world fast travel points... And more that's just the ones I came up with off the top of my head.
---
No problem.  Anytime 
---
Love it
---
Take a serum will give you that mutation and remove the negative effects of said mutation. Once an hour has past you have both positive and negative. 
---
I have no build at all. I have 15 perception and 15 intelligence, 6 strength, 3 charisma, 4 luck and 7 agility
---
I have made tons of friends. A couple in beta and a few others
---
Witch costume maybe. Found mine at the Pumpkin House.
---
when it's not disconnecting im fine inside it
---
Dewd... you duped and got caught and got banned because of that. If you're whom I think you are, "900 hour guy", you lied and misled everyone in this community in order to garner support to pressure BSG into lifting your ban which fell apart when some of the details came out, like have &gt; 250K of ultracite ammo, requiring violet flux, in under a months time. Ring a bell? 
---
With all that said, it's really rather amazing that you've come back to the game. Quite the endorsement,  even if you are a raider and a cheat. üòÇüëç
---
Oh yes, because pointing out that something that has the label "free" isn't really free is definitely negativity. 
---
Don‚Äôt spawn camp looser you just do it cause your bad at the game
---
I drop stuff for low level players all the time and only do it in open areas that the bag will be easy to find cause the game seems to drop your stuff 5 feet away from you instead of at your feet. I picture the bag on the floor and my character trying to toss rifles and ammo into it from 5 feet away lol
---
This was a great post.  Thank Odin its not another "I'm bored.  Where's the content?" post.
---
I agree though.  I've enjoyed other FO games, and knew I would this one.  But it's more than that.  This game is just incredible. 
---
P.S. - I'm still waiting for my luck to stroll across an ammo dumping generous wanderer, haha.  I'm going through shotgun shells like a maniac.
---
Oh yes, because pointing out that something with the label "free" isn't really free is definitely "negativity". All right then, have it your way.
---
They are releasing dlc. It's just free. 
---
Is that you Thanos?
---
Which is what I‚Äôve been telling my friends since day 1.  All this inaccessible doors can be tagged as unique cells for players/guilds.
---
I'm not talking about lvl 50s and up I'm talking about everyone below level 50
---
Also, no two SBQ fights are alike.  I still enjoy them.
---
I'm sure miners got a lot of mileage out of those recon sensors and stealth boy mods before the war
---
Got the BOS arms from a scrapping combat armor the other day just out the blue
---
With the expansions that little line from Fawkes changes drastically.
---
That's what I thought too.
---
I'm on Xbox, I need Trick Blood Tequila Sunrise Tick Blood Margarita, Lead Champagne Bellini and Lead Chamapgne Mimosa. I can make pretty much anything else...
---
Chainsaws are awesome once nodded and repaired to 200%.
---
Cause fallout noobs farmed blast zones for hours on end and loaded up with kick ass weapons and armor, leveled up fast, and barely did any of the actual quests then when they started doing the quests they blew through them as they could pretty much one shot all the enemies and had good armor. Had they actually played the game as it was meant to be played, they would not have whined to the dev team and got the rest of us screwed over with nerfed weapons, and stupid changes
---
If you don't play the game exactly how I think you should play it, you're a bad mean person.
---
*Wah*
---
Anger leads to hate.  Hate leads to suffering. 
---
I rarely buy expansions for a game that disappointed me that much.
---
Perception however can be a bitch.
---
There‚Äôs a jokey saying that goes,  ‚Äúyou can cure cancer,  end world hunger, and stop pollution.  But you fuck one goat and that will be what everyone remembers.‚Äù
---
Look at it this way, *all* legendary items will have a base value now, not sure what the market will settle on obviously, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it were 100 or so caps a star and the weight of the item being factored in too.
---
I've had some of those people argue that they "wanted their low level friend to have the workshop so they could farm it for events", but if that were the case, they could just invite me to their team and have free acess to my workshop.  Instead they kill me, then hunt me down across the map, then make up excuses in what I'm assuming is an attempt to convince me not to report them for griefing(as if I'd waste my time reporting them for something that nothing will ever be done about, and that doesn't really count as harassment IMO).
---
The two shot effect rather than 2x the power of the gun (before perks) is now 1.25x and explosive is down to like a quarter or fifth of what it was, so the damage of TSE was reduced to almost as little as 1/5 of what it was pre nerf.
---
Blame griefers and dupers for that.
---
Can you send a handmade rifle though the mail?
---
I'm old enough to know that if I had made some very particular decisions my life would be completely different to how it is now, any 1 of those decisions would have changed everything
---
I'm the different type of player (a bit like pacifist run). I like the camp building aspect of this game so my priority is to build a fancy home :D  I don't farm legendary enemies or kill everything on sight. I never use workshop to farm resources either
---
 If I really need to engage in a battle I prefer the longer ttk bc that would make the whole pvp more meaningful and exciting to play.
---
It's a bad experience. But the griefers are rare. I've only found a couple. Change server help.
---
What about my bloods stained combat armor? Feels more raidery..
---
I actually found survival is worlds better for workshop building. Hear me out. You don't show up on their map, fast travel is extremely limited (any workshops in the nkrtheast part of the map are basically a 15 minute walk unless an event is going on). And they can already PVP whoever they want. Hilariously enough vanilla PVP is broken enough that survival is a more viable mode to build workshops in.
---
Get a fucking grip dude. 
---
I saw that last night and was thinking I need to send him a bucket of paint with a note reading: "Tell me you can't put this on excavator or ultracite PA" so many paint packs can be used on ANY PA EXCEPT EXCAVATOR AND ULTRACITE T51B, and there's no reason for it. 
---
Don‚Äôt make me snap my fingers boy!
---
No word yet. I'd encourage everyone with this issue to submit a ticket. The more tickets they have with this issue, the more likely they are to work on a solution
---
I QUIT!
---
Yes, many players power level then complain about lack of challenge and content.
---
This has been happening during free roaming but not on a quest.
---
Such as? I have them there while out grinding to mitigate the weight of my fusion cores and keep my Intelligence where I can swap out the 5 rank crafting perks. Is there another intelligence perk that synergize better?
---
Fallout 2 is my favorite game of all time. Its one of the few games out there with such an immense world. My favorite part; you have a timer once you start the game. So good.
---
rofl I didn't say it was new as in just invented. But yes, it's a hipster word, that wasn't really a question.
---
It would be cool if they made a bunch of player hubs for each faction. 
---
Top of the World - Raiders
---
Watoga - BoS
---
Whitesprings - Enclave 
---
Harpers Ferry - Free States
---
And someplace for Responders
---
Then add back in a karma system for access to each hub and limit the inventories of each group to force more trading or interaction between each faction. 
---
Or make it possible to build persistent faction camps in certain areas so you could set up a bazaar or marketplace with player traders. 
---
both.
---
This
---
Yeah her dumb ass has got my mini nuke in the face before. Shes a loser bully. Cant hack it in real life so she does it online. She thought it would be funny to destroy my camp and then take my workshop. So her and her crew piled up at the workshop and I carpet bombed it until they were all dead then took their stuff. I carry a fat man and an anti armor dragon for people like her. I hate a bully. This game was never meant for those kind of players and that's why they created a reporting and pvp system but a few of them cant bully anyone in the pvp servers, they get their ass handed to them and cry about it plenty themselves so they come back to adventure mode and bully people again.  
---
After watching the entire stream. I can understand what direction they want to go but are still working out a plan. They did mention leaving camps but they are making steps to make it possible (ex. Unable to destroy structures). I believe it to be a great idea that will be only in certain areas like how the workshops initially started (original camp only areas). Eventually to where we build the foundation of a player hub built by players. As they stated, they are still working on the performance wall that has to be over come to leave a camp in the world. But too many things remain unspoken of what‚Äôs to come of how they will shape the game. A majority of what they want is still an idea and we can only speculate what they can allow us to do.
---
Did they specify if higher number of star items get you more tokens or have any other benefit over just turning in 1 star items for tokens? Wondering if I should hold on to heavy 3\* items or just hold on to 1\* weightless wood armor or whatever.
---
Damn i say i get kicked off every 20 minutes i get downvoted to shit and they tell me its my fault... Shoulda played on xbox one
---
Open world PvP appeals to psychopaths and people's anti-social tendencies.  You see this kind of thing all the time in games like Red Dead Online and Black Desert.
---
Thanks for the info!  I have been able to login before however we just updated our router firmware and this happened. Not sure how to check what my settings are.  The ports are not manually selected.  Century link is the service provider.  We have a modem to router  and my Xbox is wireless.
---
Lol right?

üèÖüèÖüèÖüèÖüèÖüèÖüèÖüèÖüèÖüèÖ
---
Most likely :) 
---
You got the helmet mods you can't get the others from scrapping...
---
How old is your Xbox and how good is ventilation for it? Could be dusty and/or overheating
---
Exactly. I mean, even if not used as a gathering spot for players, at least keep it open so we can get back in. Just make it a safe zone so trolls don't go in killing newbies. I just think it'd be neat to leave open as another place to explore, and we could still hang out there only without all the perks I mentioned. We'd have to leave eventually if we start getting thirsty or hungry and have run out of food and drink. After all, there's no control panel outside the vault so who shuts it behind you?
---
Thanks for the info!  I have been able to login before however we just updated our router firmware and this happened. Not sure how to check what my settings are.  The ports are not manually selected.  Century link is the service provider.  I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs a gateway however I‚Äôm not sure how to check.  My Xbox is wireless.
---
I actually leave one cap on purpose so I know I've been there and it's not just a glitch saying zero caps
---
Thank you.
---
so how would you paint my x-01?
---
Especially where mine is. 
---
Or small ones with larger reservoir capacity 
---
Not even a year old, it is well ventilated and I clear any dust on a regular basis. Also makes no difference if I've been on for a minute or hours. These locations are the only issue. 
---
I find 76 is like imgur or reddit. I technically don't need to do a fucking thing, but I keep opening up to see what's going on.
---
Then they'd never level up and that'd be on them.
---
Does he even talk?  I just spam the interact button until he spins around and I get the quest update notification.
---
lol this
---
Check the Atom shop.
---
I like it. But sometimes I dislike who I‚Äôm in a server with and love others. Hate to be tied down to same people if this is the case at all.  Unless it‚Äôs easy for us to choose. Then thatd be cool to see all your friends camps no matter if they on or not. Will give you places to refill even if they are offline 
---
They always says "you claimed the workshop, that's you invited ppl to kill you". 
---
That's wrong. After they killed you. victims always have a option to ignore them meaning you basically give up/lose the workshop (technically they shouldn't able to touch you anymore).... but idk why they can still follow you and spam kill you after that (I'm 100% sure my pacifist mode was on)
---
If they do so, that's basically harrassment.
---
Cool I‚Äôd be interested in visiting you for some T-60 stuff. Where are you located, CAMP wise? I can‚Äôt ft due to being overencumbered. What hours do you keep? My IGN is hellsnels if you get that friend request. I‚Äôm on PDT.
---
Well... Most vaults are pretty automated and there's robots everywhere so I'd assume the robots closed up.
---
You drop it I jump in it paint it and drop it back to you. 
---
How has it been nerfed? I'm not having trouble with killing stuff, its staying alive out of my power armor.
---
You‚Äôve done a man‚Äôs job sir!
---
Photo bomb!!üòÇüí£
---
Why does a raider have to have raider armor?
---
Of course any decision changes your life, which is the point : you are defined by each decision, not by a single one. 
---
Where as in FO3, the ONLY thing that matters is the last choice : "push that button, die and save the world, or don't and let the world die".
---
That's plain shitty, and if I need a DLC to make the game slightly better, it's still a shitty game.
---
The concourse area in The Top Of The World would definitely make for a good player hub. It's big. It's got many storefront areas. If guilds were an actual part of the game, it would be really good hub for people who side with raiders.
---
This was me... Before survival *evil grin*
---
ok, just sent you a friend request
---
They mentioned that they tinkered with this idea and ultimately it didn't yield the result they were hoping for. They sound it to be too tedious and jarring to be pulled out of the game to sit in a lobby just waiting. I think the final word was that they are still working towards a viable solution.
---
As others have mentioned though, I'd imagine that it's able to be done with less than 4. The whole game can be done solo, I could see this as another feature intended for multiplayer, but still doable alone (likely need to be high level/good gear)
---
Unarmed has been thrown out of the meta with the ‚Äúone-shot‚Äù nerf. Now handmades and maybe shotguns remain
---
The mentioned the brahmin toss and dearhclaw maze too. They seem to be paying more attention than people realize!
---
How about let people play how they want to play?
---
I thought you couldn't build those foundation camps anymore?
---
Did they have at least one star? Did you kill them by yourself with no other players?
---
No! Ultracite prototype is not a paint job, it was a mistake imo. Nobody wanted a step back on paint jobs. And I don't consider the Garrahan paint as very good either. I want to put wasteland wanderer and nuka quantum paints on my excavator and ultracite armors. But no....
---
Hmm that's really peculiar. I have a really shitty clapped out and dusty original black xbone fat and it doesn't encounter that. Could it possibly be a corrupt install/update?
---
He must have built it pre patch, or its bugged cause I seen 1 earlier.
---
Standing ovation.
---
He must have built it pre patch or its bugged cause I seen 1 earlier.
---
I dont think you know what hipster means.. you just said you've been seeing it everywhere, that would make it mainstream...thats kinda the thing hipsters hate and the opposite of such
---
Wait, what?  Jiggle physics?  
---
When I first started there were level 200's and above roaming around. When I pulled up the map for the first time, I wondered what that red circle around Whitesprings was until I experienced my first Death from Above. If that's the only issue you have, then sadly newbies all over are gonna have intros that don't make sense. That's just what happens when you come into the game this late after its launch.
---
The postage would be too high, I mean jeez don‚Äôt you know an AK weighs around 26 pounds? and if you attach a scope? 30 pounds. 
---
E
---
Ah OK. Well at least he got to the top of the leader board and that means he gets, um, nothing? üòÄ
---
Tell me more. Somehow I‚Äôm just now realizing repairing stuff to 200% increases their damage so I get that. But what mods should I look out for on the chainsaw?
---
Yeesh, go back and pay attention.  No Enclave in Fallout 1.  In Fallout 2 they had their own supplies and made their own Power Armor, vastly superior to everything else out there.  They didn't need to steal anyone else's technology.
---
Fucking casual.
---
I just try and sell them a bobby pin to reset it to 199. 
---
Bobby pins are the true MVP. 
---
Are you now gatekeeping that gatekeeping is only a hipster word? Yikes. 
---
And now you know why he he ran lol
---
Great isn't it?!  I went in last night with a plan and ended up getting barely any of it done!  Why?  Because I got distracted by other things ... first was 3 Scorchbeasts spawning near my camp, then someone nuked Fissure Site Prime, so I had to go and have a go at that.  A stroll through Whitesprings always seems to take longer than planned and a little housekeeping in my stash soon leads me into a mission to stock up on something .... just in case I need it!
---
Loving it!!
---
Yeah, I get it's a week long, but 25 is a high ass number for a mode with limited fast travel and very few places you can farm easily
---
Your best bet at getting the legendary kills efficiently is going to be events. Leader of the pack, uranium fever, one violent night, or any of the enemy hoard events should all guarantee at least one 1* enemy to count toward the challenge. 
---
Raiders steal so it‚Äôs possible they can have those pieces 
---
Your aware there are factions of raider mentioned by the brotherhood in 2 different games that rival them in technology 
---
I can‚Äôt get him to give me a quest and the daily pop up for the SPECIAL taster doesn‚Äôt complete no matter what I do.
---
Are you in adventure? Because if so, they removed slap damage there.
---
I'll buy it all and accidentally scrap it on my way home. 
---
Yep that sounds about right. For rifles you need to go bloodied and crit hits to catch up with melee damage.
---
I just bring my spoon. 
---
Wow you got issues, anyway that's enough of my time enjoy your post and the attention it brings you
---
Mine is apparently a very popular spot. It's at Flatwoods behind the church, over the river and I tend to get three of those "Your camp can't be placed in this world." messages at least three times before I finally find a world where I can have my camp placed.
---
All the tryhards abusing workshop pvp to farm caps coming out of the woodworks to defend their "roleplay" now lmao
---
Haha no worries my dude
---
Valseek said previously they‚Äôre doing this in a future patch
---
You and your team are fucking awesome.  Nice work!
---
That sounds like a fantastic idea. 
---
Nice
---
Yeah it‚Äôs sad like people like her exist, picking on people that don‚Äôt want be bothered. I probably should‚Äôve been better equipped like you to deal with them though haha. 
---
I found one today, on the golf course in whitesprings. I befriended him by lure of ammo. He removed a piece of the wall, I jumped team, shot him and his "protectors". Now I have more aid/chems than I'll ever need.
---
Note: my stash is full with all important shit, I regularly leave aid and chems, also junk in various locations around whitesprings. 
---
Well no, you can decide to blow up megaton too, wether or not to help the ghouls get i to tennpenny tower, if president eden blows up raven rock or not, you can choose to destroy the brotherhood in broken steel or destroy more of the enclave, side eith the mechanist or the antagoniser, kill the people in tranquility lane or keep them as dr brauns prisoners, wipe out paradise falls or capture people for them, help the vampire people or kill them, theres loads of desicions to be made and its not a shitty game because you obviously only focus on the final point.  
---
Think if new vegas, you can either take the dam, or you can take the dam from the other side. FO4 you can either blow up the institute or blow up everyone else
---
The bag still drops at your feet if you stay stood still for around 5 to 10 seconds after exiting your pip boy, it's just lag between exiting your pip boy before the world registers you have dropped it for someone.
---
Thanos and Kratos? Kranos?

Nuke him.

If you don't want to lose your stuff, don't die. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I have tick blood tequila sunrise on me and I'm on right now. Gt BrokenMoons, come find me. 
---
People who do things like this and grief are so sad
---
100 bonus carry weight with another 100 bonus if you log in while in your armour. Loose the second bonus if you get out of armour 
---
Work on improving your weapons, armor and build ready for the more challenging content to come such as vault raids.
---
Exactly. I've been in the same position and had it happen. It sucks but doing that run in Survival was silly to say the least. 
---
Did you play survival for 5hrs on one server? 
---
Killed them alone, wasn't paying attention to stars but they all dropped legendary weapons
---
But that is PvP. I don't liked, tough.
---
Just don't take the workshops. When you think about that, they are only for the PvP. Beside, across Appalachia there are several good places to loot. Without the PvP aspect the workshops become overpowered and easily exploitable as a (even more) very easy way of get resources. Currently, at least you can lose that resources easily.
---
Also, I don't found griefers frequently. But I understand you, contest a workshop could be a better PvP experience. On the other hand I'm just not interested in the current meta for that.
---
And its more like lvl 70 and 300 where there isnt much of a difference and that's only if they place there perks properly which some dont even get sorted out until lvl 100
---
thanks again for the x-01 quantum paint
---
If you had the product launch at work that they did, you'd be obsessed with booze also.
---
I referred to all the games. The 4 and 76 Sledge are the same. The suits aren't though but that never was the topic
---
love glove = condom.
---
"Don't run after I got my rubber on to fuck you."
---
Kthnxbye.
---
It might have been the same one.
---
That‚Äôs my favorite thing about all of this. Every single thing in your inventory was salvaged, raided, stolen, etc. People act like they play it straight and shit, but they are Raiders. I want to see someone who only has weapons / armor / aid that was gifted to them or they won through events with no murdering.  
---
There should be a lot more types of armor in the game.
---
carry weight in games has always been a factor of relative encumbrance and pain-in-the-assness to carry, not a measurement of mass.
---
Shit, it's like you kids never played an RPG before.
---
Well it was almost worth the biscuit till he ran into you.
---
You had a disease and/or were starving/dehydrated.
---
Or dodgy from the agility special.
---
But‚Ä¶ Raiders DO wear power armor at times. 
---
Thanks for dropping by. 
---
Still gotta eat and drink even when building lol. 
---
Now there is a good reason to be able to turn off your HUD.  Get to work Bethesda
---
A few of them are little kids but majority of  ‚Äògriefers‚Äô are dumb low-lifes in reality. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a raider‚Äô is just a lousy excuse to act out their fantasy violence upon others. No balls in real life so Bethesda gave them a virtual set. 
---
Yeah, if I wasn‚Äôt on mobile I‚Äôd try to find it for you lol. I think it was in the comments of a post about a previous patch
---
I'm thinking of deleting to reinstall and hope it fixes the issue. 
---
Yeah I would see it more like the ruins of your CAMP persist past logging out, so that there's always new places on the map to explore. At least for the Adventure Mode it seems like they're working more to make it harder for people to grief! 
---
Yeah, but they don't have the knowledge to maintain the advanced types.  They just weld plates and rebar to armor pieces, hence the 'raider power armor' pieces.  They should use that if they want to RP a raider.
---
Always go back to the same server, that way you know who camps and where. They never switch tactics, just location. 
---
My teammate loves his chainsaws. I remember dual chain bars. I will have to ask him what else. He used it mostly in ghoul and super mutant swarms 
---
Considering the expansion completely change the ending of the game and the GOTY version comes with all of the DLCs it seems like you bought a release version and are missing out on some fantastic DLCs.
---
Actually it showed up as in my inventory AND in my stash. I couldn't move it, drop, scrap it, equip on another chassis.  
---
For me the end game PA is T-51b for non radiation battles and X01 for nuke zone battles. The atom store paint can be applied to both of these and it's probably no coincidence that they each have their own unique nuka cola paints as well.
---
It's been like that for almost two months. I kill them all the time. 
---
I hope you're from a country with good internet and not Australia lol
---
reactive plates for PA is the best solution as well as hunkering down 
---
I‚Äôm behind Emmett Mountain Disposal Site just East of Whitesprings. 
---
Once we have access to contained armor (HAZMAT Suit, Power Armor, etc.) we should be able to go back into the vault anyway. The air was pumped out but if we bring our own...
---
My favorite part of the panel yesterday was the dev talking about how much he enjoys the community. Talking about how we help each other out more than being troll-ish to each other. Good times. 
---
Why run around survival full of valuables? Doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
---
They need to have at least one star. There are 0 star legendaries that will drop a legendary weapon but will not count towards the challenge
---
This happens to me a lot lol, without have a disease, starving, or dehydrated. Gotta be a glitch, I look down and blood is splattered on the ground but I don‚Äôt take any damage.
---
If you think that's bad try firing a gattling plasma.
---
I set it off and tbh I don't know if I'm hitting enemies, friends or players just caught up in it all lol
---
It's good fun tho, I recommend using one 
---
"Nobody cares about t51-b"
---
Said the pleb
---
Well, it‚Äôs pvp in the definition of these devs. I would expect to be attacked if I either take or choose to defend a workshop. Not to suddenly enter a free for all the moment I claim a workshop. The description is also very vague and ambiguous, so that does not help.
---
I would have not expected to suddenly become a target for a team mate of the person that is contesting my workshop. If that is what was intended is sure was not clear. 
---
I wish I could offer advice on how I "fixed it" but it stopped happening randomly
---
I can come to you if you join my world. 
---
You got to give the level nine credit though. He made a new character for survival, so they have some balls. You, on the other hand, are on of those asses who don‚Äôt like a challenge, so you take your character from adventure into survival, and spawn camp, as well as kill lower levels. I understand that since he was a lower level, it should be expected that he die a lot, but you‚Äôre the one who was spawn camping him at his own base, which is a ass move. You‚Äôre basically saying ‚ÄúOh he‚Äôs so dumb because he doesn‚Äôt go anywhere other than his base‚Äù, but that‚Äôs probably the only place he can go because Vault 76 is camped out a lot, as well as all the train stations.
---
Because Beth games are a power fantasy haha 
---
I thought the same, why?? It literally makes no sense, I have sat and genukne put time in thinking, trying to find reason and there is none. I do feel bad for the guy but at the same time why? The only explanation is that he was in Survival, went to adventure, then jumped back, when you do this your time alive is there still and how many kills you got, it only resets if you die. 
---
Idk if it‚Äôs a bug or if they wanted to give sentry bots that many 5.56 but that would make them the best payout enemy in the game for ammo easily 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it only goes up to level 45.
---
That's what I always thought
---
LOL. Yeah, right. Like a Raider wouldn't equip the pimpest power armor in Appalachia if he got his hands on it! A raider is going to do what they want when they want, and it's not inconceivable that a raider infiltrated the Enclave or BOS. Nice try softy.
---
I always bulk my junk, then forget to out it back in my stash. Then, later, I will find a work bench in the world, and scrap all if my bulked junk because I still haven't stored it.
---
The marker to retrieve your loot is in the data tab as a "quest". If at any point you "rejected" said quest it will not show you an indicator until you go back into your pipboy and manually select to activate it again. You may have done this in the past and not realized it (I have). 
---
Yeah sure you might not be a griefer, but you‚Äôre still a dick
---
No worries, I need to go to white springs anyway to sell some stuff. I‚Äôll add you and see when you‚Äôre online. Thanks for the response!
---
Charred feral ghouls,  already tank motherfuckers and according to lore are supposed to be highly aggressive but stupid.
---
I take a defensible high vantage point and suddenly they‚Äôre faster than the Flash and capable of cover tactics.
---
What the fuck?
---
Thanks, enjoy not having any idea what's going on in the world and never acknowledging your mistakes :)
---
Cool. I‚Äôm online now and will be for a bit yet. Stop by anytime. 
---
You're right, it's just me. That's why I see people using t51b all the time. Just kidding, I don't. And furthermore, why would t51b have higher DR than t60? Wasnt t60 made after anyways? Or is it because of the higher ER and RR that it has a lower DR than t51b?
---
Don‚Äôt you hate it when mobs move. Or shoot back. They need to remove those features. 
---
Inside is completely safe from a nuke, no blast, no rads, no affect whatsoever!
---
I'm using the mod and can say that Biv absolutely needs this.
---
Yikes. You got busted cheating and managed to get your account back, which is almost unheard of in most games. You cheat, you‚Äôre usually gone **for good**. You can‚Äôt possibly be surprised that the community lacks sympathy for a player who falsely claimed that they were innocent.  If it makes you feel better to be a dick from here on out, by all means, but don‚Äôt act like you don‚Äôt get the reasons why you‚Äôre not embraced with positivity. 
---
You can absolutely play without VATS in survival. -- Yeah it can help you drop players when they're jumping around like jack rabbits, but a lot of fights will end up with both players getting low on AP. So many clutch kills with manual aim. If you lean too much on VATS you'll only get so far.
---
Fantastic idea.
---
That‚Äôs what you get for teleporting back their while on the leaderboard.
---
That's good to know I've always avoided the area when its nuked. Actually now that I think of it I barely ever go to the Whitesprings, I forgot everything was inside. I think I was thinking of the golf clubhouse because I've watched a few legendary farming videos lately and that area is open
---
I was wondering how this went. It had been a while since that article that came out. 
---
I honestly think that's what the nuclear winter expansion is for. They want to keep the storyline continuing. We're just too impatient. 
---
It occurs during a free roaming period when I'm not on a quest. Some days I do not quest, especially when trying out a new weapon(s). As I pick stuff up for sale to a vendor if I die and respawn I have to search for the bag. Difficult within the forest.
---
How about you don't tell people how to play a game they paid for, that is all üòÇü§£
---
I found Ivestigation Files on desks at Sugar Grove as well. Could they be similar in function to Technical Data that you find then drop at Fort Defiance? Only a different location? 
---
Billions, millions, according to Todd.
---
Trillions of people globally across all platforms.
---
I'm not even counting the other galaxies!
---
Yeah never underestimate low lvls I killed a lvl 50 when I was just a wee lvl 16 with tomahawks and throwing knives 
---
It was the ‚Äòbetter‚Äô combat rifle until Nuka World introduced the handmade. Now it‚Äôs just a mob weapon. 
---
 Even without bullets for me they are the best payout in the game. I also like the fact that in nuke zones it seems like I'm the only guy who is killing them.  So yeah kinda hoping they don't fix that one. 
---
I found the mod at camp venture randomly last night
---
You sound much kinder than the DB that came stumbling into my workshop I had just gotten (from no one) and built up half way.  I see him beeboppin along and as I was about to team request him so he could share the loot, I give a thumbs up.  Just as I give a thumbs up, he rapes me with an auto grenade launcher.  Obviously some 15 year old who gets bullied at school........
---
I would uninstall lol
---
So even though the great boundary rift of Xbox vs that other one blue one exists between us 
---
Can I Jam a riddle at you for knowledge instead of physicality?
---
 Just returning into FO76 with the intent of actually knowing more than 6/50 of my perk cards/making a true "I see you, but you don't see me" sniper build..from your description you seem to have nailed the "Overwatch" style of gameplay I love down pat, so im super curious how you decided to perk and build!
---
Sniper-Apprentice information is always confidential as well, if that helps sway the mood
---
No, others hear it. That‚Äôs the one advantage the chameleon mutation bas
---
Tried the pvp mode earlier... ended up 1400 caps down, 100+ stimpaks up and a load of other meds up. Don't think i will be going back now.
---
If they did none legendary/god roll items, with a fresh start, i may be more inclined to play it. Survival is also rife with teaming. Came across 2 teams of 3 working as 1 earlier. I somehow came out on top though?!
---
I ended up going out and tipping a few pints with the guys from work. If you still need anything hit me up. Should be on within the next hour or so. 
---
Yeah, I was actually wondering the same thing yesterday, how, in reality, wouldn't it be smarter to make 76 your home base and explore/go from there? But I started a new character today, and in the process read everything on the Overseer's terminal, which is where it says this - that within 24 hours everything including the air system will shut down. I'm not sure if I missed it the first time or had just forgotten.
---
Or metal armor? No?
---
I need 5.56,  a literal fuckton if you have it.
---
Due East of Relay Tower EL-B1-02 in the Cranberry Bog, about halfway down the cliff it plateaus with a few lovely ponds. 
---
If you travel to Johnson‚Äôs Acre and then stay at roughly the same elevation keeping the cliff on your the left when going east, it‚Äôll lead you almost straight to it!
---
Orbital strike works with last laugh. Grenadier adds to blast radius and demo helps dam..
---
Just place them carefully. But esthetically, rooms look more normal when everything is titled just a bit like it isn‚Äôt a museum piece. 
---
You are correct. Thanks
---
I can't get the dailies to pop for some reason... been a few days since I got the daily to do one. Got both the brewing and fermenting stations in my camp, frequently visit the speakeasy, and still can't get it to pop. Been brewing alcohol daily as well to keep my stock up. Anyone else running into this?
---
This is the one thing that I love area chat for. I've only had one person do this to me in the week I've been playing, but while another player was protecting me (and trying to give me Radaway I desperately needed) I was absolutely roasting the idiot trying to kill me. Their outfit was almost as stupid as their player handle and for 5 minutes straight I let the 10ish people around know exactly why and everyone laughed the idiot to death. 99% of the people I've met have been unbelievably nice and helpful and it's so refreshing for an online game.
---
I feel like there are two ways to get the key, an "official" one that people somehow found out about (leaked from Bethesda? datamining?) and then there's the "actual" way to do it, which is that it's in a locker somewhere in the ash heap. I followed the "official" unmarked quest line and yeah, the key wasn't where it was supposed to be, so I googled the other way of finding the key in the random locker and there it was.
---
:shrug:
---
I wouldnt mind paying 1000 caps tbh
---
Well shit. Twinked to the eyeballs is now a phrase I'll be using, not sure for what but it's hilarious.
---
They could just set camps to not take damage when you're logged off. I think it'd be pretty neat, finding a camp out in the wilderness is always a cool experience and doing more for that would be a benefit to the game. It'd also be waay easier having player vendors set up if we didn't have to be logged in to sell stuff. 
---
exactly. Becomes an unnecessary grind to change it up. The current system only frustrates the most loyal players that have reached level 50. 
---
sure. I find that a lot but I still agree there should be a way to do it instantly.
---
Yes. I have one on pc and can trade if you have anything i don't know
---
Yes, that's one of the most popular theory! I really hope this is a connection to the elder scrolls. I bet they've been planning something like this since bethesda bought fallout! =]
---
I've acquired Combat Dense, Marine Dense, Robot Dense and Metal Dense from the BOS Watoga vendor and the one in inner Grafton.  I don't server hop, but of these, I've only seen Combat and Metal *once*.  Marine and/or Robot Dense, on the other hand, come up maybe once a week.
---
If you ask me, it's *way* too rare.  A vendor will typically carry a plan random armor + random mod plan.  The odds of it landing on the right combination are very small because there are so many.  I'll see plenty of Pneumatic, BioCommMesh, etc., but rarely Dense.  Players also noted that the Combat Dense plan was incorrectly named at one point, and part of me thinks that in the process of fixing it, Bethesda removed it from the table completely.
---
Many players also press tab immediately to give up so they can get back to their loot bag quicker so sometimes it may appear as if you one-hit them but it's just them instantly giving up
---
They said they're building instancing tech for the new vault raids. So I expect a bunch more instanced content to come once they get it all working.
---
Holy crap that's frickin next week!!! In my head it was months away!
---
Bethesda's predatory free to win DLC has fractured the Fallout 76 community! Pls like and subscribe and hit that bell
---
People like that would do all that same shit in real life if not for the punishments involved. They would destroy other peoples property, kill and harm others just for sport. They think it's funny to cause misery to others. Basically, they are terrible people yet will openly claim they are nice and would never do that in reality. But the fact they grief people then make fun of them after proves they are just lying to themselves. I wouldn't carry the fat man or the dragon constantly if I didn't have to deal with idiots like this. 
---
I like the explosives idea, maybe a crafting skill in which you use the shape charges and blasting caps with a timer? That would make things interesting !
---
Thanks, I never check the Grafton bot. I'll start looking there too.
---
Will do! 
---
Recruitment blues, is the way point marker lying? I fiddled &amp; farted with that quest for a few days &amp; it wouldn't complete. There was an entire room I was missing with the actual terminal needed to complete it.
---
Stupid waypoint was stuck in between floors 3-4 of Fort Defiance for me. 
---
"What is terror to fly, is normal to spider."
---
..But is the killer really a dick for killing you? I mean, this is survival mode. If player wants to kill you and take your junk, that doesn't make killer a d#ck. You calling your killer a "d#ck" and "griefer" is more being d#ck, than killing a player in a mode where it is natural to kill each other and loot from other players.
---
I can sell 1500 how much caps for them?
---
&gt;This will mark that player as Wanted and display the Bounty amount on all other players‚Äô Maps.
---
You guys really have no idea how to design the concept of emergent gameplay, do you? It really is sad how far Bethesda has fallen. Zero creativity, zero thought given to this mechanic whatsoever.  
---
HEY YOU MAGICALLY KNOW WHERE THAT GUY IS! GO GET HIM!
---
RIP Bethesda.
---
Someone get this person some gold, karma, flair, I don't know but this. Fucking THIS. I am so over the griefer bullshit, Bethesda is really letting it get out of hand by letting the people who are gaming the system back in to further alienate people who want to enjoy what is a pretty great game.
---
Hopefully the chuds who are playing now with Survival BETA get bored again and go back to their Calls of Duties and Fornites.
---
I mean, I get the /s, but I still had to read it twice cuz I thought you were defective.
---
Brahmin toss and deathclaw maze? You cant just say those things and not link to them
---
Why Day is it dropping?
---
Heh. Looking back at how consistently you get downvoted. 
---
So you're saying that because my vision is poor and can't be entirely corrected, I shouldn't be able to enjoy this game. ... And that nobody else in this thread should, even though the fix would involved maybe 10 lines of code at the most. 
---
Got it. Thanks so much for your amazing insights.   I can't believe I thought you were just a stupid jerk. 
---
April 9
---
I think it's their ammo reserve.
---
Killed the sentry bot by NAR north of the White Springs. It started at 12 missiles, quickly jumped up to 36. Grabbed it of course, only 12 ended up in my inventory. 
---
Just to clarify for everyone, player vending drops April 9th, not this coming week April 2.
---
Just found some in hampers ferry (torso) 
---
I hope Biv will be screaming and yelling his drunk lines now.
---
true
---
Yeah, he says some funny shit. Reminded me of the joke-telling beer-buddy bot in FO4.
---
The issue for me personally wasnt that they gave Bobby pins unrealistic weights,  which is common for items in RPGs with weight and encumbrance, it was that in the previous FO and all other FOs to my knowledge they have always been basically weightless.
---
The weight here deceived people who used to horde the Bobby pins in fo4.
---
Everything is out of proportion weight wise then again we run around snacking death claws in the face with hammers that have rockets....wth is realistic about anything in the FO games lol.
---
Alright, my bad, I was doing other stuff
---
I found him dead last night next to a live deathclaw. Is he ever alive?
---
Nobody is roleplaying a raider. They're just bored griefers, all.
---
Yea ik lol
---
Or a little pond-like area for the aquatic plants like tarberries and the like
---
Right? Thoroughly enjoyed that tire cleanup in FO4. 
---
If you plan on being melee, then I recommend you get the twisted muscles mutation.
---
Highly probable. 
---
Why the actual fuck did you get downvoted for this. 
---
I farm grafton steel and uranium fever event. All the mole miners have guns and each will have the gauntlets when scrapping them with scrapper perk card on I'll get upwards of 300 to 400 steel scrap. Always look for short assault rifles. Those are 18 steel per gun with scrapper on. And any veins I come across I grab.
---
They come from the vault that is in the one schools basment
---
If you have just started belly if the beast you are right at the end of the BOS questline and it's all done in the cranberry bog area.
---
I definitely will join up with you sometime agaim
---
Take over every workshop in the mire and bog and do their defend quests. By the time you take over your fourth, the first one will probably need to be defended again. 
---
There really doesn‚Äôt fell like there‚Äôs a Really good spot to farm xp. You just have to keep plugging away at the kills till they add up. 
---
One way I see it could work is Home and Guest world system, where when you login you are put into same server as your camp. Then when you server hop to another world, your camp stays in home world. Later you can just hop back to home world where camp is.
---
Happens all the time in watoga. It fusion cells for me though. I'll lot a corpse and it'll say 300 rounds of it but when picked up it's only 6. I've also noticed a new PA bug on my ultracite armor. When I put in a fusion core, it suddenly said i had 4. So i opened up the transfer menu and saw:
---
Fusion core(8)
---
Fusion core (7)
---
Fusion core (6)
---
Fusion core (21) 
---
And all at the same time!! When I pulled them off they disappear so it's not an exploit. Just funky numbers popping up in creature/equipment inventories. At least it doesn't screw with your own inventory. 
---
Or they're playing a PvP game, and you don't know how to handle it...
---
Does survival mode drop more junk than adventure? Or do you think it was just him grinding/gathering from others?
---
I haven't had a chance to dive into survival yet, mostly because of work but also the negative feedback I've been hearing about campers, but I feel like I always need ballistic fibers so if its possible to get so much more in survival I might just suck it up and try not to get killed lol
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that just make you the Enclave if you‚Äôre using X-01
---
I was done with my build by 60 as I used a planner. So they definitely could have been there too. Plus it‚Äôs survival. Not sure what you expect? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm grieving anyone. 
---
And too add further this was technically a 5vs1 situation. I won‚Äôt even count the guy I dropped first cause he had no idea. 
---
Those details grind at my ocd
---
You can also fast travel to workshops you own, any events on the map and to friends still. A lot more ways to get around than immediately obvious.
---
Could they also turn down the sound of a super sledge while they're at it?  It's so friggin loud I can barely hear my team-mates sometimes.
---
I didn't say those were much better :) 
---
All the choices you provide in fo3 don't change the ending, which is why I say they don't matter. 
---
In the previous games, as in any real ttrpg, choices of the player matters and open or block paths. In the first you could finish the game without killing anyone, just by convincing people, but you could also create alliances between groups, or betray your kind, which is Judy impossible in the next games.
---
You can if you start taking a workshop owned by the player, then travel to that player. I just got killed while ark that way.
---
Are you a computer programmer? Things can‚Äôt be changed just like that just so a handicap can get a bit of a better experience. You aren‚Äôt missing much anyway
---
I'm still waiting for them to allow the Blackbird paint on my Excavator... \*junk hoarder for life\*
---
You can kill those. Nuka grenade rads go through foundations. If you are with friends do it like this: the friends stays over the guy on top of his camp. You leave and rejoin the server. You see your floating friend nearby, just go through walls before they load.
---
Also, you dont need any glitches to build indestructible base.
---
People make the game. They kind of have to at the moment. 76 compared to others is really lacking in solo mission content. For me trying out weapons and builds while meeting new people to play and trade with is my main draw. I'm over 400 hours and I leveled pretty fast early on. The game is as fun as you make it.
---
You can search this question on reddit and get 10.000 answers. You can even sort by newest.
---
We see these posts everyday and yes its ALOT better than release.
---
Collecting all plans and recipes is one I‚Äôd like to try, but as of right now I‚Äôm hunting for all the rare outfits.
---
Yeah!!!  I‚Äôm curious how they I tend to roll it out.
---
I‚Äôve seen them go between 1 and 5k
---
It still doesn't make sense. Why not stash your junk? Maybe he forgot to stash it but it sounds like you were following him for quite a long time so I don't think that explains it either. So much valuable junk as well, it's not like it was 500 wood and steel.
---
I don't think YOU know what hipster means. They do things they THINK are obscure, but in reality, they're pretty mainstream. Like gatekeeping. And every other stupid fucking meme/trend/whatever that happens on Reddit. Hipster. 
---
It drops Aid and more Caps, but the Junk is the same (which is to say, all of it).
---
Keep killing her till you get good loot.
---
I went with mutation farming and min maxing my heavy weapons build. Once I'd sorted that out I made a new character and am working on a vats critical sniper. Enjoying it alot as it's changed my play style substantially. 
---
What's up with that anyways? Was it in FO4? I never got to play that one and I keep wondering where this "blackbird excavator" keeps coming from. Even still, though it does sound better than the garrahan excavator paint, it's still not camo or anything. I just think it's silly not to include them when you can use Wasteland Wanderer on everything else. 
---
They got the name because they...raid. Mate.
---
Well that's how it works. That's how it worked in F4 too. 
---
Mine has short recon scope because it's fairly silent gun and close range it's a bit weakish. I wish I could find something better than the TS I have, probably even furious would be better. Though Im hoping for a nice 3 star.
---
All my other rifles have reflex sights.
---
Gary? Gaaaaaaary. GARY!
---
IMO you already have the two best unarmed weapons. I'm pretty sure the mole miner gauntlet doesn't do the same damage
---
This is an online survival game. There is no "beating the game"
---
Which is great because one time i forgot. Collected all the irradiated matts and made some stable flux...in whitesprings. Dude was clearly waiting for me to finish and the moment i moved from that chem table i was blown apart. I wouldn't make that mistake again but now i don't have to worry about running around like a bloated tick holding bundles of matts.
---
Isn‚Äôt that what video games are for? Not griefing necessarily but acting out the things you want to do but cannot do in real life? I mean I imagine you‚Äôre not actually using laser pistols shooting giant green men, Bethesda gives you the tools to act how you want, its why we play their games.
---
I found him by the Overseer's Camp when I had been playing for not even 5 minutes.
---
Sure, it can, no one has tried restarting it is all.
---
I'm sure, us reclaimers can restart it and open all the locked doors if allowed.
---
It should indeed be awesome. What are you planning on selling?
---
Yes they are super easy solo. Can easily breeze through it without any trouble. As long as you have reasonable gear your fine.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Yea those fusion cores doe are super nice
---
Yea same. Well guess ill have to start hunting again.
---
You don‚Äôt need all that stuff. You just need teammates. 
---
Oh lol and i made a mistake as well. I guess im gonna folo ur ways. 
---
Your* 
---
I guess so
---
On the right side of this subreddit page there is a button called "Community Options", click that and it will show a drop-down menu with "flair". Click the pen icon next to the flair option and you should be able to pick one.
---
Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence. Your memes are now forfeit.
---
Alright
---
Ammo, ammo, and more AMMO! Haha. Seriously, though, probably custom weapons and armor, too. My character has a very high intelligence and it's time to monetize it.
---
No longer than 15 minutes, I made my way from grafton Station lol, then followed him. Would of got him sooner but fog crawlers, cave crickets and    blood bugs kept slowing me down. I think maybe he was just so awe struck that he had all that lead nd fiber he totally forgot wtf he was doing lol, where he was. 
---
Damn can you imagine getting that many fusion cores that‚Äôd be insane
---
In fo76 it would because pipboy usage is in real time. So you could easily change your weapons or eat and drink
---
Same but for repairs and crafting.
---
yo i u is gettin rid of it shit give me a fuckin pack of water yo. aint fair that you get all that shit jus cuz u playin linger then me? give me shit, i need 
---
My game crashed so hard the other night it shut my Xbox off, had to hard reset and haven‚Äôt had it since. 
---
Sadly the current fast travel spawns you outside if they moved the fast point inside the the resort then it be perfectly fine as a player hub as is 
---
i see more and more using it on pvp. should not be available in this mode imo.
---
Started off not so interesting but you guys have made the game quite fun! I do enjoy the small little updates like these to! I do apologize for the hate from people but the adults that play see what your doing and look forward to more of your work!!! Be safe guys
---
I‚Äôve never been a tracked by a single stealth boyed character but I suppose it does happen. But not that often. 
---
One of the final quests for Rose gives black diamond, ski sword with +1 str
---
End of Enclave gives last bastion.
---
I think both are leveled rewards 
---
Underarmor doesn't work in PA. Maybe you had perks/team before. 
---
You have to spell Reddit correctly, then it automatically triggers. 
---
Survive. 
---
I would read this if you ripped your wall of text into several segments. 
---
That's a great idea. You could even wait and see which mod combinations on armor and weapons sell well and if something stays in there too long take it out and change it
---
nice, but nit a good idea in survival. 
---
I know at first I was jacked thinking its be a one time exploit. I've never exploited before but I haven't found a single fusion core in the game since they lowered the drop rate (oh yeah and then they made it so any fusion cores dropped as loot are only at 25%) weeks ago. So I was gonna exploit for once (cuz screw Beth. for taking them away), but of course, did not work in my favor. At least it not working leaves me with my self respect and I don't have to feel like a cheater lol
---
Tbh I'm all for perminant camps, without them actually having player vendor machines would be mostly pointless.
---
You would only have someone trade with it if you were playing yourself, allowing camps to stay when you aren't opens up players to visit your camp and trade 24/7 
---
Are you one of the idiots who goes around here bitching endlessly about griefers, while they're online griefing? 
---
The campers do ruin it but if you put your camp node out of the way you can go hours without bumping into someone, obviously you get highlighted if your 1st, 2nd or third but I've last ages without bumping in to anyone. People seem interested in building up caps, but there is a max for a reason, you just don't need them. You can find everything yourself. Anyway no he was just grinding, he didn't drop a lot of aid, aid drops are random, sometimes you drop a few, sometimes you drop most of what you have.
---
A few people made the mistake of taking everything with them and lost it all, serums, stealth boys and so on. I only keep psycho chems and bobble heads, the rest I sell or put in containers depending on my location.
---
If your a high level player then you risk losing a hell of a lot of caps, fortunately I've spent ages Pvping, testing builds out so I'm only lvl 112, I lose 224 caps if I get shot, but half the time people slap a 200 cap bounty on you which they pay if someone kills you.
---
I have to admit at the moment I focus on high level players, but my main attraction of survival is the gun battles through team Pvp, its awesome. 
---
[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b40yhi/i_built_a_brahmin_based_minigame_i_call_it/) the Brahmin Toss, and [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/azaaoa/i_built_a_maze_and_then_trapped_players_inside_it/) the Deathclaw Maze.
---
Yeah, VATS is broken for melee rn anyway. Plus you've got people using stealth boys out the ass. 
---
Belly of the Beast is the final quest in the bos line, so you don't really need to move camp (unless you want to). 
---
While there are a few stages to this quest, they must all be done at one time. If you do the first 2 stages, for example, then log off, you will need to repeat them next time, as this quest isn't checkpointed for some reason.
---
I want to throw up
---
I would like to be able to send buddies shipments via aid drops to their camps. I find something that suits their build when they‚Äôre offline, I‚Äôd like to have it delivered to them when they log in later. 
---
Sorry sold
---
Very, very interesting. Why spoiled veggies?
---
Okay so I didn't know that. What about your regular armor? Half the time my menu makes it look like you're wearing it in your PA and the other half the time it'll say those items aren't equipped. And lastly, it definitely wasnt related to teams, I play solo. 
---
Try signing out of your profile and signing back in. This has fixed unregistered achievements for me in the past with other games. 
---
Agreed, they should start from making their outputs awesome enough that players would be claiming and defending them. Right now they are mostly fast travel locations if you know where to get junk faster.
---
Most are in the southwest area by for defiance and the south mire near camp venture. I placed mine by the antiques store and my fast travel costs are around the 10 cap mark
---
ggaaaaaarrryyyyyyyy.....!?
---
I always thought it was Operation Overkill ‚Üí Wasteland ‚Üí Fallout
---
I unlocked it yesterday no recipe given was just unlocked for me to craft
---
I think these were all influences yes
---
I started a week ago and have met so many nice and helpful people. Random high levels have teamed up and given me things, built stuff in my camp that I didn't have plans for, and protected me from the one annoying murderer I've encountered.
---
In ready to interact with the NPCs of the Mothman cult 
---
Good to know that is not only a problem from the spanish version
---
r/karmaroulette
---
And it couldn't have been tied to my regular armor either cuz I upgraded last night and went from 121RR to 225RR
---
I been feeling like there's more recently, I think a lot of it is our brains playing trucks on us! 
---
Oh okey then, yeah some issues can be different, it's normal. And, I will be accessible to pc in hour for check it.
---
Thanks for the suggestions! I switched to a sneak/crit rifle build where I use an AA lever action or a furious combat rifle. Insanely strong build!
---
I think auto-pistols are somewhat decent because they benefit from concentrated fire a lot, they have armor piercing mods, the option to use a silencer and most importantly pretty high dps. However, auto-pistols pale in comparison to auto rifles. There is literally no reason whatsoever to use auto pistols over rifles. 
---
Non-automatic pistols are by far the worst weapon class in the game. There is no option to sneak, they have a low fire rate and low damage. A comparable (non-sneak) rifle build can easily output 5x as much DPS as a pistol build. 
---
At the moment, there is just no reason to use a pistol ever. I just think that should change.
---
PS someone on the sub calculated that hardened receivers are better for DPS for a crit build (which also is a bit wierd imo). 
---
Co leader of a raider clan, eh? 
---
I‚Äôm certainly not which means 
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm your huckleberry‚Äù 
---
And when I blast you and your ‚Äúclan‚Äù in my PA I‚Äôll be sure to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre no daisy‚Äù 
---
Game on 
---
How?
---
I have handmade plans for sale lol
---
I have been saving my 3 star gear in hopes that it is worthwhile to trade in. Is it safe to assume 3 star will be viewed better in the trade than a 1 star. 
---
I use my spoiled food and alcohol for pennies since I don‚Äôt need either
---
If you can't beat em join em.
---
I think you can and people do 
---
They just don‚Äôt talk shit about their role playing on Reddit lol 
---
Lol that jumping around like jack rabbits is why I am taking a break from Blackops4 free for all sprinting and corner hopping with no stamina limits. 
---
But, I see 76 has some sort of unlimited marsupial jumping mechanic :(
---
Oh good news, I'm happy for you indeed.
---
If it is all black then this is likely the witches costume. Plans for this dress can be found on a dead corpse dressed in it, which is a random encounter that can be found near Dyer chemical in the mire (right on the route 65 sign on the main highway). Sometimes on other locations on that road, I found it slightly south of that.
---
It can also be bought from the travelling vendor but that also sells the hunters coat (I bought mine from there).
---
If it is a grey/black checkered dress then it will be the civil war era dress. This can be found at the civil war museum north of grafton dam.
---
Exactamundo. Only problem is that I'll have to move my camp from the middle of nowhere junk farm to a location that has a lot more traffic. It'll be worth it if I can make enough caps, though.
---
Long before camps will be able to stay in the world the camp protection promised in one of the recent patch notes/inside the vault will be implemented, it will soon be the case that camps cannot be destroyed but the whole camps staying in the world is more of a wish list item within the development team for the future so don‚Äôt worry.
---
Except when twenty people have saved camps in one world and they aren't playing. So the plots and spots in cue are taken by them? So if they aren't playing only five people can be on the server. Too many issues for this. Private servers is the only solution and I doubt they will ever allow that. 
---
My game is done about an hour as well( slow crap internet :D) and hopefully it works now ! 
---
Thanks a lot again for you‚Äôre help 
---
Skimpy outfits in FO4?
---
Did I miss finding a skimpy outfit for my protagonist to wear.?
---
How remiss if me. She currently runs around in a ballistic weave red dress lol.
---
A lot of people are sheep, incapable of independent thought and motion.
---
Yeah so let‚Äôs hope it works now so I can get my Fallout 76 fix before the weekend is over :)
---
A raider with style or fashion sense hails yeah 
---
Why the hell not?   Raiderette perhaps?  That would be sawheet 
---
is it really any easier to switch peripherals though?
---
I've started investing caps, buying rare(light) items. Like plans, recipes and shit like that. I don't have an alt or another account so I spend my caps on things that don't really move in terms of value. People are hoarding caps over numerous characters, but I don't see the point. I've got most of the best rifles now, a mixed armor of Sen/Ass, Bolstering/Sentinel and Chameleon/Sentinel. All 3 star, so I'm good in terms of gear but it's finding ways to spend your caps is now my genuinely biggest problem. I die but not a lot lol. I only really struggle with Sentinel/Assassin builds but once you draw them to you and there on the move they go down in one shot. I always wait for cavalier builds to jump or they recon the area then one bang them. Got plenty of tips if your ever needing help. I've spent hundreds of hours in Pvp now, almost forgot about the whitesprings legendary farming. 
---
I was saying something similar. I will never contest when someone absolutely has to have my workshop, but they are just using it as a way to initiate PvP, because hunting down someone who doesn't want to fight you makes them feel better about being complete shit in survival mode.
---
All for it. They need to finally separate PvP and PvE now that the servers are there for it.
---
My idea is, since workshops are so valuable, that the person "claiming" it can be invited to the team, and if you are unwilling to allow them to share in the resources, then let them take ownership for a while, as a game mechanic. Otherwise have them on the team so they too can loot it a few times. Completely negates the need for PvP, and would keep the griefers from exploiting the system.
---
You know you could use that flux to keep taking mutation serums.  Just an idea.  Even if you have the mutations, taking the serum again should suppress the negative effects, so you could walk around with all mutations at all times and not need the perk for reduced negatives :P  
---
Looks like someone struck a nerve.  Where‚Äôs my jet?? 
---
Okay thanks I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was also really good and If I should get either an aa version or executioner for queen 
---
Let‚Äôs hope for that new bear head one 
---
your camp will vanish apon leaving a server, I've seen it happen several times when a friend left and i was at their camp
---
Oh you are welcome^^
---
meta its a thing for a reason, thank bethesda for adding pvp to a naturally pve game
---
Having to make (sometimes) hard choices is why I like playing games like this.  I‚Äôm ok with the perk system. I‚Äôd actually prefer more consequences in the game. Infamy would be a welcome addition for me. Or not being allowed into the Bunker if your too cozy with the BOS. 
---
If anything I think the game is a bit forgiving in that if I really, really want to unlock that level 3 safe, I can swap out a few perks, get the loot, swap perks again, and the go back shooting things.
---
Oh and I'll be sure to keep an eye out for t51b users while I wade through the seas of yellow that I'm always seeing lmao.  I'm not saying "nobody" uses it. Its hyperbole. It's a statement, to some degree it's true. Of course a percentage of people use the other PAs, duh. But when you're hollering from the back of meeting that I'm not "100% correct in what I say", then you're not really adding to the conversation at hand, just being loud and obnoxious. My conversation highlights wanting better paint jobs for ultracite and excavator armors, so your reply has nothing to offer on the matter. So thanks for nothing, not that i expected much
---
I like the system because I can change builds at whim without starting a new character.  
---
This is true, some other people were mentioning that they just changed where they spawn more often and I‚Äôm just looking in the wrong places, but I also don‚Äôt know many other places to look other than the usual spots. 
---
Im lvl 80 and I love my T60. I dont really know the specifics on all the PA. Guess Im making a mistake lol. 
---
Oh well, its sleek as fuck. 
---
What about the goofballs with a clown mask and only drawers - and the obligatory deathclaw gauntlet.  
---
Discuss.....
---
Yea it did that for me too. I reloaded the world a few times that worked once. But then I just did what I was supposed to by looking on youtube and that completed the quest but then the next quest in line is supposed to start but doesnt.
---
I mean yeah, that sounds good. My miners gauntlet is a zealot's, bit what you describe sounds pretty ideal.
---
The thing is they won't jump in the role completely, i think we just have to accept that the majority is just assholes with an addiction for taking stuff out on others that they can't do irl.
---
Those are just nightmare fuel psychos. Their the early version of the pack
---
I'm fine with them doing that, as long as they suit up properly when they attack others, who cares what they wear when they slaughter generic scorched #769
---
Oh look I'm a griefer, grow up. 
---
See yea I looked at both places and it wasnt there almost like they took it out of the game. I dunno either lol
---
They finally buff energy weapons and plasma specifically? I may be tempted to play again if so. 
---
Guessing you were the weasel hiding in your fortress. 
---
Swapped mine to a flamer barrel with a recon scope for marking enemies and to increase durability. Is a two shot, and no need to aim much as it's a flame thrower now lol
---
there are too many "must have" perks, like who doesn't play with bloody mess?  just raise the damage 15% across the board and get rid of the card...
---
And it's totally cool to feel that way. But for people who refuse to use anything but the highest quality (and I know plenty) it's frustrating to see all the BoS paints get put into t60 when t51b ultracite is FOUND on a brotherhood mission (but no BoS paints why?) And it sucks to only have one other option for excavator (which also isn't camouflage or anything)
---
As for your comment, go look at my threads you cock, I've never bitched about griefers lol. Neither am I one, although I love "griefing" people who talk shit and lack all evidence of their statement. You ass clown. 
---
What newspaper would write about this?
---
You are the true heroes of Appalachia. Extremely well done, and major congratulations to all of you.
---
One last thing: this was not a wasted effort. You all delved into the depths of Fallout 76 much deeper than anyone before you, and you've emerged with clear, undeniable results. 
---
(And for what it's worth, in my head canon, Tourniquet was a success.)
---
the better the game sells the more it will be supported.  and there are ways to mitigate trolling, with the changes to pacifist and those applying to camp it will be very hard for someone to troll someone in adventure mode
---
Then survival isn't the place for you. 
---
And I don't say that to be a dick.
---
Survival, like any competitive game has a meta. The meta is determined by what equipment is best and the competitive minded players shift toward that equipment because it gives them a better chance to compete and win.
---
An example comparison is Magic the Gathering. They run competitive level tournaments where people use the same decks that are viable at any given time.  Usually 2-5 decks depending on format. 
---
This seems stale to people who play casually and want to innovate and use their own ideas but those decks aren't as finely tuned as the meta decks and you will lose.  
---
If that isn't fun to you,  stay home and play magic at the kitchen table or don't play the competitive formats (in this case survival mode).
---
Survival mode has several viable builds but you're going to be restricted to those few if you want to compete. 
---
If that's lame or unfun to you... like it is to me.... go back to adventure
---
I've been a cannibal since I could use the card. Never had a mutation or a deaeases from eating corpses. Judt used lead belly and ghoulish. Alrhough. I've not seen anything from actually using ghoulish? Anyone help in that
---
Speak for yourself. I think Bethesda has saved the game already. 
---
People that take videogames so seriously and as some indication of a persons personality are so fucking lame lol   
---
I would rather pay for a game that runs. I you want early access, then more power to you. Get the early access. I'm not against it.
---
I am however,  against AAA development releasing a game that is barely even playable for 30% of thier consumers while doing thier damnedest to milk all all the money they can thru shady ass marketing ploys.
---
The whole bag fiasco was one thing. Then the "limited time" 50% off Christmas deal that was on sale that never saw it's full price. How's that considered a deal? There's also the plastic collection rum bottle. And one I've never seen mentioned was the wallets. I bought 1 myself. and its falling apart. I've had the same wallet MADE FROM PAPER!!!! for around 4 years yet it's still in good shape other than the design fade.
---
Fallout 76 was fun no doubt. But it was most definitely broken. It needed at very least 6 more months. But Bethesda really fucked themselves with all thier shitty marketing ploys. Contracting poor quality suppliers and selling it as a quality item is shitty as fuck.
---
There is just so much piss poor management around fo76 that it reflects on the game too. I agree that the marketing stuff shouldnt....but it did. And While the game itself didnt deserve every bit of hate I guess, Bethesda does. But still, the game was pretty shit the first month.
---
Who's the one projecting here üôÑ
---
I can‚Äôt imagine freaking that much over a dropped bag unless it was right after a materials run without a chance to drop it in my stash. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt have gone after scorch beasts at that level with junk I had intended to keep, and scorch beasts don‚Äôt really drop anything that counts as junk to lose, so I don‚Äôt know what the deal is. The guy probably got more than enough junk back before even logging off. Honestly, even if some jerk wad took my bag after a good run, I‚Äôd assume he needed it more than I do. I could just go get more the next time I play.
---
I can get what not it might give the people with said app an infrared advantage.
---
1. There's lots of spots to camp and will encourage exploring instead of going for the popular spots.
---
2. Private servers are confirmed as in the works 
---
I appreciate the work you guys put into this.
---
My endgame consists of walking around the map like a tourist, taking pictures of all the little things. My favorite so far was four shopping carts, lined up coming down a hill, and each one had a skeleton in it. And the leader cart was wedged up against a police car! So these poor kids were having a great time, almost got busted by the cops, and then the bombs went off. 
---
I‚Äôve always loved the stories that the skeletons tell in these games, so I hunt for that. But there‚Äôs all kinds of other stories told as well, so go find them!!
---
Also, allow a voice chat mode that is BOTH team and area.
---
In that case, no worries. This will get patched. 
---
Chameleon is silent, which is exactly why I got weightless gear
---
Neon letters you can get from vendors but you're better off buying it from a player for cheaper. Nuka cola signs I believe are from the atom shop. Those marquee arrows you can buy from the watoga, raider or harpers ferry vendor. 
---
Count the amount of interactables. Now, count them in your CAMP. Every single item can either be used with an action, created, destroyed, stored or moved. In the case of the latter two the server has to do a check to ensure it's legal. Some of my experimental CAMPs have crashed the server, I'm now sure of it.

Diseases should be a lot more contagious.  You should catch every disease I have if you eat my corpse.  If you sleep in a bed I slept in recently you should have a chance to catch what I have. "Sleep tight, don't let the Rad Worms bite!"

Diseases shouldn't time out either in survival:  stays on till cured.

And I should get to spit in my food so if you take it you can catch something too.

Nah. It'd be cobbled together stuff... creative, yes. Wasteland ingenuity? Yes.

I use all of them, even the t-45 as it has the best hotrod paint and there's very little noticable ingame difference. T-60 is cheaper to repair, x-01 and ultracite are a pain in the arse to mod but that's about it.

I made a new character. I don‚Äôt want to lose my tamed pet. üòÇüòÇ

I understand nuking the parade once.  It was a useful experiment and we just had to see if anything changed.
---
Once it was clear it didn't change anything and also made gathering intestines impossible that should have been enough.
---
I just hope we find new overseer tapes where she's ashamed we nuked Fasnacht. 
---
I made a new character, and I love it! Survival will completely change the way you play the game. No longer do I hunt for junk, build a nice camp, or hoard caps. Now I leave junk behind unless I need to repair armor or weapons, my camp is literally just a stash box and fast travel point, and I spend all my caps on aid items, which get dumped straight into my stash. 
---
I like that I have to treat it like a more realistic survival situation, and am forced out of my typical play style comfort zone. I say do it, and try something new!!
---
Just wondering what build you used? Starting a new character and this sounds wicked fun.
---
How much for the quantum paint?

Thanks, I think I‚Äôll do it 
---
Lol who dies fighting scorchbeasts?
---
Oh man, this is the best suggestion I‚Äôve seen for survival mode! I agree 100%!!
---
Agreed!!
---
I've honestly been wondering about the "feel" of the other suits and how they stack up to each other in-game.
---
Personally, out of all of this... I find the Cargo Bot aspect to be the most interesting, because I noticed this sort of thing back in very early December, so not even a month and a half after launch. At this time, I was so new yet that I had NO clue what those were as they were just circling an area way West (and just a tiny tiny bit North) of the downed-bridge across the river. Again, being so new, I got excited as I thought the map was even bigger than I thought and extended beyond the river... sadly not. Crossing back over and getting on top of the nearest building, with my Pipe Revolver I cautiously took a couple pot-shots at them... sadly they were out of range and nothing made contact. At this time though, there were anywhere from 5 to 8 of them circling and I've returned a few times over the months to witness fewer at times, but I'm not entirely sure if I've ever seen more than that... Even now I'm just guessing that there may have been up to 8, and I feel like I had witnessed more during other visits to Point Pleasant.
---
Honestly, I always just thought this was a strange spot inside the map (outside the playable area) that Bethesda selected for the bots to return to and circle in a holding pattern until called upon to drop cargo.
---
**However,** now that all of this gets mentioned and I reflect back on it... ^(\[tinfoil hat\]) It makes me wonder if just *maybe* the fact that they do circle about and within \_visual range\_ of us is actually intentional, so that we are able to keep a count of them... That picking Point Pleasant was intentional for 2 reason: A) It's a spot on the map that has a bow in the river which means there's sufficient landmass over unplayable area for them to congregate (possibly outside of gun range) B) It's a location that they will be noticed because it's a spot that players are **going** to visit to investigate Mothman.
---
In addition to that lets not forget that the Cargo Bots also are holding onto Nuclear Cards. So for a moment lets pretend that I had actually seen 6 hovering around that day, and the reason people see less than 6 over there at any one time could be due to the fact that one had already been shot down previously... As such, what I'm getting at is, could the Cargo Bots be of some significance also, and play an odd roll in all of this as a "condition" needing to be met before all of this happens? Perhaps you need to take down all of the Cargo Bots in addition to all of this?
---
That being said, I also wonder if the original *order* of the nuked sites were in the wrong order? The original theory was, based on lore in the game, that after nuking Prime the other fissure sites opened and new SBQ matured to take over... What if you have to nuke them either with Prime first, defeating the SBQ, before continuing on to the lesser ones? Or perhaps in alphabetical order?
---
**Which, as I was getting the fissure site names, this now throws a huge wrench into everything...**  
---
There are waaaay more than 6 Fissure Sites... There are [14 marked and unmarked sites!!](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fissure_site)  
---
Even if one omits the 5 unmarked sites in the Bog, that still leaves ***9*** sites that need to be nuked. Yet, if one were to speculate that there are 5 regions of the map and 5 marked (named, at least in the files) sites, then maybe nuking only 1 per region is the ticket? Perhaps it also comes down to other factors, like a specific fissure when multiple named sites are in a region? Perhaps, again, alphabetical order comes into play?   
---
Working with the one-per-region, thus only 5, is a much easier task to take on instead of the original 6. Yet, if all 9 named need to be taken out, that's... well I think that's the nail in the coffin on the subject of the fissure sites hiding anything special to unlock *(at least at the time of posting, as Bethesda may take the guy's original idea and run with it)*.  
---
^(\[/tinfoil hat\])
---
The real endgame is buying a second system so you can have a simultaneous alt character. Once the alt is built up pretty well you can team up the two and pick two sets off of each legendary kill. Alt can be charisma maxed for work sharing, use empath, etc. 
---
If you want a full set youll need way more than that
---
Then your looking for a different game altogether because FO76 isn't a MMO
---
Normal armor also won't work while wearing PA. That means also the legendary effects of said armor.
---
In PA you only get the PA stats, nothing else.
---
Make an offer, I'll deliver after my next drop

They *should* yes, but in all likelihood, it will be regarded as an unfair advantage to change gear or use Aid without going into the pipboy menu in a multiplayer game.
---
Stealth ranged rifle basically. Not exactly a sniper as only 1 of my guns is ‚Äúscoped‚Äù just prefer the reflex sight. When I get home I can prolly send a planner.
---
No. It effects me badly as well. I haven‚Äôt been able to read any of them, and following clues to background fluff is what I like most in fo games tbh. 
---
The fact that you can so doesn‚Äôt mean you should.  Lawyers and court costs get the money anyways (I‚Äôve been in several lawsuits), with you getting like a few bucks at best.  Not a good option unless your the lawyer. 
---
Efforts should be made to get them to address this without suing. Suing first is damn near always a frivolous exercise because your not looking for a real fix, just cash, which you won‚Äôt end up getting anyways. 
---
I have also experienced this.
---
Yessir
---
Psn is Daedrael 
---
There‚Äôs a level of academic rigor with which you conducted your experiments that really appeals to me. Thank you for being so thorough with your research, and I hope you had a ton of fun!
---
That being said, if we know now that it‚Äôs impossible to have all fissures closed simultaneously, maybe Bethesda could consider that a unique angle for a conclusion to the scorchbeast story. I hope a developer sees your mission summary and uses this to create something new!
---
Day 1? I wanted to enjoy it on Day 1 but every play session ended with "I really don't feel like loading back into the game after that application crash".
---
Only now can I enjoy the game. Sure there are occasional server disconnects, but the application crashes have been managed well.
---
I look for skeletons and try to figure out the stories they tell. Since killing the SBQ the first time to finish the main story, I‚Äôve become a wasteland ‚Äòtourist‚Äô, finding cool stuff in the middle of nowhere and taking pictures of it.

Awesome comment. We are planning on checking out theories with less chance of success in the future. As a side note, there are guns capable of hitting the cargobots, but they go down out of range. You can‚Äôt target them in vats, or else anyone could do it with a dragon. 
---
I got stalked for 45 min the other day, heard the guy  went chameleon and we faught!!! I died and it was awesome!!!! 
---
Junk, chems, ammo and PowerArmor if possible!
---
I don‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs just preference for me. I don‚Äôt really use it in adventure, either. 
---
Dumb idea. Makes SPECIAL pointless. SPECIAL is there to make you have unique builds each character invests in. If its a free for all 100% of the time, then why have SPECIAL at all. 
---
No sometimes easy sometimes takes forever
---
Tbh with you, I would agree with you. But this last update, with its nerf to ‚Äúone-shot‚Äù just ruined any other option. It hurts to say, but it is just not fun. I understand a meta, I just think it‚Äôs unfortunate that it‚Äôs finally looking like there really is a single king out there. 
---
I'm working on that, that's the point of doing the Raider quests..
---
I can't believe there is no accessible a stash box there
---
Like this idea. Although I do like the idea of carrying maybe one thing in junk like a pen or beer bottle üòÇ
---
Thank you to everyone for your field work! Its been awesome reading about this. So as far as we know, the fissures closing have no other effect other than being cosmetic?
---
Before this last update, there were many fairly equal options to fight with. Now it just looks like
---
Handmade is the single king. I just think it‚Äôs unfortunate 
---
I can't wait for the caps to just start flowing in. 
---
Oops.  @Bethesda 
---
It stops scorchbeasts from spawning there, and turns off a light in the Enclave bunker. 
---
A raider would steal and use whatever they get their hands on, why would it be hard to believe that they killed some guy and stole their stuff and are now using nice armor?
---
Stealthboys reveal you when you attack. Remove this last ‚Äúone-shot‚Äù nerf; it make handmade the only king in the meta, and ruined melee.
---
Once fallout went multiplayer pve stuff kinda took a back seat to meas I've been bored with it for years really. 
---
I'm pretty sure hes always dead, at least that's what everyone else has said who found him
---
There was a Gamma World RPG before Operation Overkill. By the time OO arrived, the PA genre was pretty well established in pop culture. As for direct inspiration, that would be Wasteland. 
---
Yea he was.  He was from Little Lamplight which was a vault full of kids.  They just expanded to the cavern around it.
---
Fair warning, if you switch to heavy, be prepared to farm ALL the lead and steel in the wasteland. I keep a minimum of 10k .50 in my stash at all times, and I can burn through a large chunk of that on any given SBQ run. 
---
I re-enabled subtitles because of him lol
---
&gt; A little confirmation bias and paranoia on your part I think. 
---
Wow lol. That's so ridiculous. 
---
Mostly Savage Divide if I recall correctly, for the Enclave 
---
Heh heh, Gary!
---
It‚Äôs not giving me a trade option I don‚Äôt get it
---
I've seen that same glitch of a swarm of cargobots over point pleasant, any idea why that happens?
---
Ya ppl should get sick from other sick players but you other suggestions suck lol
---
yes of cours we are :) we are stormlords from now on :P
---
I'll take the emphasis on 'likely' then ü§®
---
If a player is standing up, absolutely. If they are crouching, which is often, then I switch guns.
---
Last time I tried survival I went to check out someone who was wanted and found, essentially, a castle outside Watoga. 
---
The issue of "only one appearing on server" isn't attributed to being wanted is it? I'm sure you guys know if you have a bounty out, you won't see any other players.
---
Me and my friends that I play with were always like ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be nice if they made it so you can merge camps?‚Äù You and your friends could basically build a whole settlement, just like you said.
---
Are u mutated ?
---
+karma thanks! 
---
Does Steam have a toxic community or something?
---
Would you want to sell the two recipes?
---
You 100% on that? I be seen guides on YouTube that show them gettin different BOS plans from scrapping? I could be mistaken 
---
100% agree. I have a bar and I want to put a ton of alcohol on the shelves behind it. Plus I wanna put a bunch of those teddy bears up and get a full collection of them
---
We didn't buy the game, only the license to access the servers lol
---
If they show 0 when they‚Äôre supposed to show 200, if you sell them anything (I use pins, because 1 cap) it will correct the value. If it hasn‚Äôt been long enough, it‚Äôll say they don‚Äôt have enough caps. 
---
Thank you!
---
I'm fairly sure I learned mine by scrapping a lot, I don't think I've ever seen plans.
---
Not as hard as opening the Pip-Boy on screen, faving your weapons and meds, or spamming the button that pumps you full of stimpaks. And for those who are playing Survival now, it could be extremely helpful. 
---
You don't. 
---
Mostly around whitesprings and the area between savage divide and mire regions.
---
This sounds like the grenades on super mutant issue a while back. It's a glitch but be wary. The menu said you were looting 20 grenades and while only 2 or 3 showed up in your inventory, your weight would increase as if you picked up 20. This was causing "ghost weight" on a lot of people. Might be same thing here
---
I didn‚Äôt fire a shot or open a container for the last two hours. I‚Äôll ask z3rosun.

The Deathclaw Maze is so amazing. I so look forward to that guy's next trap.
---
What platform?
---
In new Captain Noobs video Mole miner g was little bit better than those two
---
&gt;People like shotguns therefore they use them. Grind long enough and get a good one.
---
Uh no. I have an anti-armor LMG with a prime receiver.  I easily killed a guy five times who took my workshop last night.   Grind long enough and yes, you can find good gear for PVP.  But there's very little chance you will find  a two shot explosive shotgun.
---
And yet they are literally everywhere. 
---
There's nothing paranoid about it.  That is not confirmation bias. That is simply a  fact. 
---
 The fact that TSE handmade and shot guns have been duped isn't even a debatable.
---
Some real interesting ideas here!
---
Its somehow tied to the server. It‚Äôs something else for us to figure out.

You wanna share any of your treasures? I'm level 64 but I've been playing since the beta and I suck, I feel like I'm low on everything. Probably because I can only play solo maybe. I get scared trying to do events myself is how bad it is. 
---
It's not meaningless. A level 200 may have way better gear than a level 55.  They have farmed more and participated in events and so on. Also mutations are maybe a factor. 
---
The only way I see it being an advantage is if you have a second person running the app and pumping you with chems and meds. You would still have to take your eyes off the screen and at least one hand off the keyboard/controller in order to operate it. The only difference is that you wouldn‚Äôt be hitting the back button when a mob of gouls suddenly show up to rape you. 
---
I can't wait because I've been saving so much crap to sell and I'd like to be able to walk again 
---
Half the reason I‚Äôm still playing is cause I need the XP cause I‚Äôm constantly tweeting my build.

I still get excited when the level up icon pops and I‚Äôm 148.

That'd be great! Thanks.

it's glitched now if you are completly full on budget it will still let you tame one

Defense events at workshops provide plans for CAMP items. You can also take a break and wait for the new content.

If you can, use a dedicated SSD for this game with only your favourite browse maybe to avoid conflicts.

Thanks for the heads up I can check next time I play if something like this is occurring.
---
The best part is that short hunting rifle, all you could do is watch lol
---
Try survival. Pvp in adventure is silly
---
So, what are you trying to say if you agree with my original point?
---
I think the best way to do this would be to allow us to move more than one point per level, but only from one special to another. So you could pull your 5 points off strength, but all 5 of those points have to go to the same SPECIAL when moved. It would allow you to redesign your character faster, but you would still have to pick and choose your points and perks. Otherwise you would have people running pure damage in the wild and moving all their points/cards when they get home to scrap and craft. The really high levels may still do it for a while (I know I have quite a few unused levels), but eventually they would run out.

PA being ‚Äúcool‚Äù isn‚Äôt the reason I wear it because it‚Äôs not.  It‚Äôs like a minivan- totally practical.  I like the ability to protect myself and carry a variety of things - weapons, gear, junk, chems, you name it.  I also like to trade so it all allows me more options. 
---
I get why people don‚Äôt like it - flame away!  I run sometimes without it but have average to above average body armor I‚Äôve crafted.  None of the assasins sentinel killer gear.  
---
***oh yessss***
---
Thank you my friend that's exactly what I needed to hear xD
---
It took me weeks to realize that was what happened. I would loot a box at a workshop, get wanted, and then be confused why I saw nobody on the map.
---
I appreciate it, just glad to know I‚Äôm not going crazy lol. I‚Äôll look into other threads about this and see what‚Äôs been mentioned, thanks again!
---
People are doing it. If you want to try, just be aware that when each patch is released your mods might mess things up, so you have to wait for the dev to fix the issues. Also, don't use mods that would give you an unfair advantage (i.e. the lockpick sweet spot mod). I used the one that showed known recipes until Bethesda implemented the fix.
---
Good point. My bad. No disease from eating with cannibal. But you do gain rads. Ghoulish only heals lost health up to your rads. So if you take a rad away it‚Äôll reduce rads but leave your health wherever it was. If you take rads from a melee hit, or by eating with cannibal, it‚Äôll heal the gap a bit between where your rads are and where your health was. So ghoulish prevents the need of taking stim packs. Same situation in a nuke zone. If you get low on health and high rads, take a rad away and it‚Äôll remove some rads, because you are taking rads non stop in a nuke zone, you‚Äôll see your health climb to where your rads are without a stim pack. 
---
Ghoulish helps reduce the number of stim packs you use as it closes the gap between low health and where your rads are each time you remove rads then take on radiation. 
---
Is this a swearing jar reference?
---
Pushing and supporting PVP modes will bring in the griefers more than steam.
---
Sent you a message on xbox and upvoted, a very kind and generous offer indeed. 
---
I've had this happen with my combat rifle A VERY LONG time ago, it just fixed itself after a while. It was nice while it lasted
---
You're joking right? Cuz if that's the case then I need to stop using PA all together. My normal armor gives me better resistances than almost all PA suits. If that's the case then we need a shout out to Bethesda about making legendary PA parts.
---
Thanks for sharing your experience, hopefully it‚Äôs something the devs are looking into. My fame is pretty stable as well. I squally only have a couple random disconnects a week but every time an item is added I do disconnect so half I‚Äôm not just going crazy lol. Thanks for the input!
---
It was weird because I had it happen in fallout 4 as well with the same gun.
---
Little lamplight wasn't a vault full of kids, it was a cave system full of kids.
---
I want it to be a thing, but I suspect that this is the reasoning it is not.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt expect the prices to drop anytime soon, due to the amount people actually paying for this crap, so my advice would be just to wait until they add something that isn‚Äôt overpriced garbage and use the atoms you save up to buy what you want
---
Oh I'm really happy for that then! :) 
---
I'm just saying that everything affected a very large portion of thier consumers. That's why it got hate.
---
It doesnt deserve praise becouse it ran good for you. I dont know how it ran on PC.
---
Ok I‚Äôm down. I‚Äôm on right now, add me
---
I‚Äôm going on now I‚Äôm going to invite you to a team 
---
I‚Äôve tried to do as much of that as I could too, but man my inventory gets heavy quick!  
---
Yeah sometimes it‚Äôs tough to search for threads on the mobile app, which is what I use, and I don‚Äôt mean to beat a dead horse so I‚Äôll check those out and see if anyone had any recommendations. Thanks for letting me know it‚Äôs a known issue and not just me, much appreciated!
---
Top 3 kills would result in too many ties (most people only get between 1-3 kills per life anyway). A fix might be to have the longest life break the tie. 
---
Really though, most kills would mark players for pvp and punish them for using the game mechanics. 
---
Just remove marking leaderboard players altogether and keep marked players as wanted and keep death bags visible so players who want to engage in pvp know where to go
---
Hunting the top 3 down is one of the most fun aspects of Survival. The top knows they gotta keep moving or hunker down defensively, attackers have to be smart and think ahead (is he in a group? Melee vs sniper? PA or Asstenial?)
---
It gives random players and groups something to do, how many games do I get to actively stalk down and murder a person of my choosing?!
---
The second they disappear from the map, and all you have left is those exact squads you spoke about reigning all hell at train stations and V76
---
I'd much rather see legendary effects/vats toned waay down to even the hunting grounds, rather than remove the hunt itself
---
For Oxhorn, to be fair, 76 is quite different from 4. There is not quite as much elaborate, semi-obscure lore to talk about, and it's a lot harder to research what's out there because there is no solid, informative wiki at the moment.
---
Outstanding!
---
In eso, I remember they had cats and whatnot that could be companions. They had no function in the game tho 
---
I believe the PSA Events were canceled due to the Bot Protests breaking out all over Appalachia 
---
You are correct.  I remembered the inner structures as a vault for some reason when i t was actually a pre-war tourist attraction.
---
I both hate it and love it, i just go into adventure if I'm not in the mood for dog hunt.
---
You interested in trades? I have some 1* gear that I've not been able to sell that I could trade you.
---
It‚Äôs blue and teal. If that‚Äôs what you are calling green?
---
I think it only won't work vs stealth. It certainly works when you are sneaking or in stealth yourself.
---
To be honest I like survival as is and dont want it to change 
---
Or you could've just said the line
---
Ah sounds like whatever settings you had before got cleared out after updating. With a web browser, try logging in to your router settings by going to http://192.168.0.1 or http://192.168.1.1 - some times it can be http://10.0.0.1. You may need to login with an admin (defaults are sometimes username 'admin' with a blank password). If youve made this far then try to locate a software tab (most likely in an advanced page) and see if you can find a restore backup settings or roll back to previous settings options. Otherwise my best recommendation is to enable uPnP.  
---
I also was watching a video about it. I heard that high level dungeons are coming to this game AKA(if you saw the trailer they released) it‚Äôs gonna be those new underground locations. I think they might be coming April 9th because I heard some people saying that, or it might come later
---
No joke. It's always been like this.  Do you not have max leveled PA?  Usually has the best resistances. 
---
Thanks guys not all my shower thoughts are great
---
Just passed to him: got one Marsupial and one Healing Factor serum nearly for free, i just gave him the flux + a little extra as thank you! 10/10, love this
---
care to address any of the other points I raised about stealth builds or fairness lol
---
Oh may get one then what would u say anti armor or executioner I play mainly pve 
---
Mostly the player housing and player vendors (which are getting improved even further). Can be placed anywhere on the map and are actually useful. 
---
That, and the RP/player made experiences are all unique and fun like in SWG. The game doesn‚Äôt hold your hand and force you through content like other MMO‚Äôs. It‚Äôs pick your own fun and adventure.
---
I‚Äôve run into a ‚Äúchurch of atom‚Äù where the guy RP‚Äôed being a worshiper of the bomb.
---
I have seen player made trade areas where people are buying/selling crafted gear, plans and ammo.
---
I play as a cannibalistic shotgun/explosives psycho and run around after players eating dead bodies in their wake.   
---
The RP and experiences are pretty unlimited and the game seems to be being refined to further that kind of gameplay.
---
New characters are actually at an advantage. With level balancing to help lower level players, you lose less caps upon death. Level 300s have the disadvantage even with better gear, they lose 600 caps each death
---
Yeah,  unfortunately there's an ebb and flow to competitive games where they try and fix something and it breaks other things.  (Jeeze I could compare this to Magic all day).
---
Nothing to do but wait for things to be modified again. 
---
When I first got this, I tried everything. In the end, I had to strip down completely to make it work, not sure if it was an armor effect or what.
---
Now, I just re-log when I get the sneak attack quest and it triggers a new one.
---
Bundle it, sell it to vendors. You'll get a lot more. 
---
Would be cool if cars had a steel node.....like picking up wood from a log.
---
Here's an idea: let us build a car in our CAMPs that also function as a fusion generator, I mean, they've all got working fusion reactors in them...why not harness that into running our CAMPs?
---
Kill her every chance you get , trade good rolls you cannot use 
---
"PA" as in Power Armor, or Post-Apocalyptic?  There were also literary inspirations such as "A Canticle for Leibowitz" which had ghoul-like mutated humans.
---
Shoot, I missed ya!
---
Aye!! You actually made a post thats awesome üòÇ
---
Pieces go for 10-25k each lol
---
I can already see how this mechanic is being abused.   I tried it for the first time last night.  The  three players at the op of the list were all lowish level and kind of weak. I  know because I hunted one and easily killed him.   Also, he had only been alive for about 30 minutes or so.
---
Seems they guys who can stay alive longer would be guys with better gear/ builds doesn't it? So why is it that the top three guy were low level with bad builds?  
---
Could at be that guys with the best gear and builds are having their friends kill them to keep them out of the top 3?
---
There's been several Reddit petitions here for that. I'd be happy if underarmor would work and we could get more options for mods.
---
I'm sticking with my T51b PA as it has double of the ballistic armor I can get from my legendary pieces.
---
And also PA has excellent armor for all situations. It might not be the top best with all right perks for non PA sets, but all basic armor tend to have one good rating while others are shit. Combat armor is basically shit evenly all over.
---
Pretty sure, I tried it a bunch myself and I've heard that through data mining its been determined you can't but I guess I'm not %100
---
There is no benefit to starting over other than whatever personal pride you may get from it. It‚Äôs a tough time out there for low levels.
---
I wouldn't say toxic, just very very negative, people will actually buy games just to put a bad review on the Steam store page, then they refund the game but the review sticks.
---
Preach it. If you go to SBQ fight with less than 8k you will be switching weapons to another. On average of the 10 fights I've done so far (lvl77). As a hvy Gunner. 1 1*furious 50 call. And 1 1* furious Gatling. I've used per fight about 7k 50 call and 4-5k 5mm. And I make 3 solid mine runs in excavator for lead and do a farming lowbee run. For steel/gunpowder witch takes me about 1 hour each. Then I can do another SBQ fight. That's without doing any workshops. Hope it helps. And I am a hvy wpns/sniper build. Hvy in PA and sniper outside. So it is do able. Just takes time
---
I‚Äôm a lvl 67 and still haven‚Äôt been lucky enough to find a decent legendary weapon to use. I‚Äôm trying to respec into a rifleman build so I‚Äôd like to have a good weapon for that. I‚Äôm at comic con this weekend but I‚Äôll be home Sunday night if you want to schedule a time to meet up. I really appreciate you‚Äôre doing this!
---
You mean when you bring up your Pip-Boy while crouched?
---
Hope all the vendors are bored shooting their explosive 2 shot shotguns so I can buy them ,,üòÅ
---
I love survival too and I dont want it gettin soft cause"i lost all my aid and caps" bs.. this is the fallout 76 I've been waitin on. Infact let's make it even harsher!!!
---
Yeah but I hardly think a new character is going to kill a level 300. Maybe a level 40 or so.
---
I do but I don‚Äôt have two so I can play with the Mrs.  like a middle class person :-/
---
Here‚Äôs the thing - they were a team and had numbers.  You get to lvl 75 or so the playing field evens up a lot.  I‚Äôve died several times in one on one battles with lvl 75-100 and I‚Äôm lvl 150 now.   In fact, I generally get more concerned with the lvl 75-100 players (compared to 150-200+) because their cap losses are half and if they take me down it‚Äôs more than worth it to them. 
---
If you rape a girl you‚Äôre not just bad, you‚Äôre evil.
---
And gratuitously using rape as a frivolous analogy to discuss a video game doesn‚Äôt make you awesome either.
---
Is it racist that I read this in an Eastern European accent 
---
I repaired mine to 200% and added 2 mods.  Longbow bar and flamer.  It does nice damage now.   This weapon is good for enemies that move slow.  Animals, Super Mutants, Robots, etc.  Even though it is listed as a slow weapon, your enemy gets sucked into it and staggers!  So it rips through them.  I have perks that work against armor too.  Slice and Dice!
---
Well it's a good idea for small animals but death claws sloths hermit crabs excetra shouldn't be able to be tamed as there a bit of a bullet sponge and you can't tame legendary animals. Other wise good idea Also  shouldnt be able to respawn if killed
---
Ya I got max level excavator, ultracite, and x01
---
I appreciate the offer but my ‚Äútrader‚Äù toon is coming up on maximum weight limit and I‚Äôm doing this to make some space. If you‚Äôre looking for a particular item I‚Äôll extend my offer to you as well.
---
It‚Äôs lag my guy 
---
Or have a timer
---
Yeah, it seemed pretty obvious that you wouldn't be able to close all of them. Sorry you guys had to waste your time, but good job.
---
Haha yeah knocking would be great :) 
---
My handmade isn‚Äôt that great I‚Äôm wondering what mods make this a god weapon in survival.
---
My version as found: from memory away from game.
---
Speedy receiver 
---
Short Barrel 
---
Silencer
---
Stabilized Grip
---
Stinging Magazine
---
On?
---
Maybe for pvp, but pve i don't think that really has affected pve has it? I usually run 2H anyways. Too hard to get a god tier 1H, meanwhile I've owned a few really good 2H.
---
Good point!
---
Ah, that‚Äôs the activity in clarksburg? Brilliant, makes sense. Of course after that things only got worse, so here we are I suppose.
---
No it‚Äôs not you can‚Äôt even bring up the menu for they body
---
Up until our discoveries yesterday, there wasn‚Äôt any reason we couldn‚Äôt. Thanks. 
---
For sure! Just message me on Xbox and I‚Äôll be happy to help you out. I work weekends as well so I‚Äôll probably hop on for an hour real late (like 12-1am est on Sunday). Either way we‚Äôll figure it out.
---
Very true, that makes me feel a lot better, they crack down pretty hard on toxic people, didn't they issue lifetime bans to people not too long ago for something?
---
You sound so certain it‚Äôs not lag, then why post? 
---
Maybe he/she is being nice and offering for the people that don‚Äôt have steel.  
---
That or some planter boxes so people don't have to plant them on top of campfires lol
---
I don‚Äôt think we should be able to have armor and power armor on at the same time, or else I would have nearly 1,000 DR and ER. Maybe we could just keep the legendary effects though 
---
Legendary power armor is definitely needed. Fo4 had i think a single piece of legendary pa. It was the pizonucleic t51 torso. Which always made me wonder if one why not many? 
---
I would like it if fallout 4 creation club items that you purchased become decorative in fallout 76
---
4 months later and this is still an issue... monkaS
---
This is the left over of what I have after using up the vendors.
---
Huh ok, that‚Äôs good to know
---
It's not an exploit. When you take a workshop, you become flagged for pvp *wherever you are*. Period.
---
Don't want to be killed ? Don't take a workshop.
---
I have every unarmed weapon and nothing does more damage then my death claw gauntlet. Knuckles are fun but the animation seems weird. 
---
My fav melee weapon is actually my bloodied Bowie knife. 1-2 hit everything and it swings faster than any melee weapon I own. 
---
I end up on the top 3 alot just because I'm off questing (1-14 survival only so far) doing my own thing instead of actively looking for PvP fights. I know I'll eventually get hunted down by the hitsquad but as long as my name's on that board, I ain't making that task easy
---
I mean, if I get the chance to send a .308 towards your face before you can see me that's a bonus for me, but rarely do I go rushing into the known hotspots looking for action
---
Oh boy get ready for the guys who exploited to get their full
---
Sentinel/cavalier/assassin sets to start crying 
---
To complain about it because Bethesda can fix it if they are aware of the issue
---
So what‚Äôs is your issue other than lag? 
---
It wasn't a waste of time. We learned a lot. And had fun on the way - which really matters in the end ;)
---
Gotcha. Not a bad way to go. Was just offering input. üëç
---
Yea. Hard lemonade is the only one of the new alcohol recipes that you can't earn from Biv, and can only be obtained via the lemonade stand vendor. 
---
Hadn't thought of that at the time. I definitely jumped the gun on that one. üò¨
---
what does the spoiled veg do?
---
Yeah. Try five characters with 25k caps each haha 
---
Cool thanks for the info. 
---
Thanks for the info but What would u recommend me get - I don‚Äôt run bloodied build 
---
Did nobody see this racist ass name?!?!11
---
I think you could practically get a full set of legendary power armor from completing certain BOS side quests. 
---
My suspicion is that this is what they are going for.  Not sure how they plan on keeping servers from being cluttered with camps though...it should be interesting to see how they plan to implement it. 
---
üôÑ that I can‚Äôt loot body‚Äôs that are inside intractable plants and that I got a glitched item worth neither 2 billion caps 
---
The point of a survival mode is going right over your head. Go play DayZ and tell me if you'd think a Top 3 mode would work in that. 
---
Excellent, looks like I will be heading West. 
---
I haven't been able to replicate the campfire trick with anything for moving around crops or stacking/floating foundations, so I think he just didn't get rid of his camp post patch.
---
I guess my problem is that all you gotta do to stay out of the top 3 is get yourself killed. 
---
"Oh look I'm in the top 3! Time to disarm, get naked and jump off this cliff!"  
---
I dunno it's kind of lame to me.
---
Haha very nice. Karma for you
---
Noob had 40swing speed executioners with extra spike.I think swingspeed is must.I have swingspeed powerfist and just got swing knuckles but havet try yet.
---
A little floating rebounds would work.. although, if companions function anything like ones in skyrim, no thanks! Block doorways, set off traps while sneaking or walking, get stuck on rocks and end up a mile way.. I'll pass!
---
I hear you can drop an item close to your bag and the bag will relocate to your location as the game combines they into a single bag.
---
Pic or it didn‚Äôt happen 
---
We're all wondering the same thing.
---
I really wanted to give Bethesda the benefit if the doubt for fixing 76 but this just shows how much they don't know what they're doing for a survival game. 
---
Yeah I kind of felt the same. At least underarmor should still work (cuz I don't see why you wouldn't be able to use underarmor UNDER your ARMOR) in PA. But that's why I'm really leaning toward Power Armor parts with legendary effects. Cuz I have full vanguard's armor and my resistances are better than PA when at full health, which doesn't seem right to me since using PA comes at a continuous cost (youd think wearing PA would be almost hands down stronger than regular armor, especially if you can't have legendary effects).
---
seems like they should make it part of the challange...strip down naked and sneak lol
---
But stimpaks are already easy to use. On PS4 just hit right on the D-pad.
---
I guess maybe you misunderstand me, I already did "required effort". Its clearly buggy. I have move points to reach a high enough charisma, experimented with the two perks at max level cause there is a lot of vague information out there on taming pets. Investigated locations where events take place. Camped said locations for about 5 hours every day for over a week. Finally, the preferred pet appears. I tamed it, it appear in my camp. Then it simply disappeared. I placed the CAMP in a level area. The animal was enclosed, safely with the camp device inside. Everything is locked and clusters of turrets everywhere. I researched the unfortunate mistakes of other players(which I know what that feels like now!) when pets clip or fall through foundations, but it did not matter. kinda frustrating.
---
One thing I did notice though, is on the time it disappeared, it was raining outside. I am unsure cause the weather is nothing to me in this game, but it could do so rad dmg or something I suppose even if its inside. It was a level one creature, but was inside. Just some info for other people like myself who is trying to tame on this Russian roulette like system.
---
Bethesda has stated that they are working on a patch that will make camps persist after logging out. It's not a thing yet though.
---
I jabent gotten to play fo4 yet. But that's great to know that a piece already existed. Gives hope for the future. Upvote this post and hopefully Bethesda will see it
---
Well, they *could* lower the price, but the result would be people flipping their shit because they paid so much.
---
I have to agree with you I‚Äôve noticed that I spend about an hour swapping perk cards around during 4 hours of playing it would be nice to see maybe two separate decks one for combat perks and one for non combat perks, the limitations on special points is a bit much in my opinion also maybe give ten points at the start of new characters so we can actually make different builds and have some breathing room I mean being able to make different builds is one of the biggest things in the old fallout games 
---
Pic of the inability to loot a body inside a plant or my negative 2 billion cap item
---
except level doesn't matter beyond 60 or so.
---
I have no feels for exploiters so...
---
Thanks for stopping by!
---
Swing speed is really good I have it on deathclaw g and powerfist 
---
Billion cap item 
---
Yes. All angry grumbling about "buying broken games," people need to realize that Bethesda puts out fun but buggy games. They probably could polish and clean, and sterilize bugs until we basically got another boring shooter, but then it would not be a Bethesda game. If you want perfect running blandness, there's at least three new ones per year, go get one. I'd much rather have something unique and fun, if buggy.
---
There is a reason crashing the game with tumbling cheese wheels is a thing for Bethesda gamers. They could optimize the engine and deny players the ability to fuck about, but then we don't end up with Brahmin Toss, where people try to figure out the shenanigans they can get into with a buggy or unintentionally complex system.
---
But  game with a massive community needs a controlled economy or it will collapse.  I dont understand why thats difficult to understand
---
I love being number one because it draws in more kills for my count lol. I died at 31 kills last night, then worked back up and logged off at 53 kills. I was number one till the first death, then I got back up to number 2. 
---
They should implement multiple leaderboards maybe.
---
Could be missing textures, which is what that used to mean in other Beth games. Might need to do a clean reinstall. If that doesn't work, it's probably the mods.
---
I'd first start with uninstalling ALL of your mods and going from there. If that doesn't work, then you might have to do a clean re-install and try it fresh without mods first. If the textures are right without your mods installed then try putting the mods back on. If none of that works I got no idea man. 76 isn't supposed to be ready for mods yet so you might just have to live without them until it is.
---
Nope
---
Depends on why are you read this in an that accent.
---
Just look if there are leaderboards when you‚Äôre loaded in
---
I let the action come to me. I love the leaderboard because of this.
---
I'll be by to collect.
---
Enclave vendor will drop Dense mods once in awhile, but no plans.
---
Ok I will include that in a few minutes as i will need to take a picture of it in my stash which will require me to load up fallout 76
---
It's too bad you're on PC, man. I got one on PS4 I want to get rid of coz I'm just not into the pump actions. They reload waaaay too slow for me. üò¨
---
Thank you for stopping by and the donations!!
---
I will refrain from asking "what if you rape a man then" and proceed with the rest.
---
I don't use it "gratuitously", I use it as an example of something very bad. I have no idea what difference you make between someone who's bad and someone who's evil, that seems more philosophical than practical.
---
Also I note you didn't answer the question about "if you do that bad action then that good action, what are you?"
---
If you feel uneasy with me mentioning rape, I apologize since I just wanted to use a very bad act as example. 
---
Awesome job man, I'll add you. GT is Kaise7en. I'll also have some gear for trade/donation to needy players. 
---
Only one ive found to work was the early game achievements. (Get to lvl yada yada). But since i had gotten my character in beta past tgose two levels. I had to start a new character to get them.
---
&lt; claps &gt;
---
Usually the logo shows up on your friends list
---
Nah nah. When you open your frienda list every online friend either has or doesn't have a campfire icon. Those with campfire are on survival.
---
On a serious note 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing PA with maybe half the leg effects
---
Or only allow 50% of effects from armor to activate while wearing PA
---
Guilds could become a thing, we could band together and build our Group Unity In Last Days (I'm not good at acronyms, but you see what I'm getting at) settlement together. The low population servers could be a problem, maybe limit them to 4-8 members, so there are chances for multiple guilds to spawn on the same server (or just up the population limit I guess, lol). 
---
Awesome thanks
---
Dumb question here, but has nuking sites alpha and beta and then prime and SBQ been tried? It seems like a logical first step but I have not found mention of it.
---
People are claiming that the Legendary vendor will be found in the Mire, at the boarded up train station. I like this as a location. Always thought the reason it was boarded up was to support the Free Stater's isolation
---
Nah, he's "roleplaying a raider"
---
We have not. There wasn‚Äôt sufficient evidence that the file names had any bearing on the secret. We may try at some point anyways. 
---
lost 222 caps to someone who just kept killing me and camping around the workshop, not capturing it. I ended up reporting him for greifing and blocking him, I have PVP disabled in the menu so I couldn't do damage even if I wanted to. but its ridiculous that someone can attack you without actually paying/attempting to capture the workshop.
---
Thanks for your quick and complete answer, I will try that, I wish you a good day and a good weeekend
---
Good to know not to pick up the ammo. I left 50 missiles on a sentry bot the other day that would have a been a huge pain to deal with.
---
I have a weightless fat man weigh less than a grenade. 
---
It really helps if you just want to be a walking heavy arsenal. Ive got 3 harpoon guns, two missile launchers, 3 LMG's, 2 gatling guns, a gatling plasma, a couple fat men, 2 50cals, and a gatling laser. And it all weighs less than 20lbs.
---
You have to delete your custom INI and not use mods, there is supposedly a way you can use mods without effecting the atom store stuff, but I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out how to keep t working 
---
Fun fact. The more sirens you place, the louder they will be collectively, and it only works if they're all connected to the same power source and turn on at the same time. There's a principle with audio where if you want to make something sound louder, like on a concert stage with numerous speakers, if you want to make 1 speaker sound twice as loud, you need 2 speakers, and if you want 2 speakers to sound twice as loud, you need 4 speakers, and so and so forth, but the effect only works if they're all synchronized. I've placed around 26-32 sirens and somewhere in that range it starts to peak your speakers with how loud it gets. You can also spam the switch they're all connected to and the sirens will overlap the audio 10 or so times and it's even louder, so it goes from around 30 sirens playing to 300 of them playing at once. This works because siren audio plays in a loop and will continue to play the loop a single time even if it's powered off, so flipping them on and off triggers 10 loops of 30 sirens playing at once. 
---
Once you done this, a single siren sounds utterly pathetic and weak in comparison.

I detail that post here.

Tell me how that works out for you.  The X-01 is battle armor.  The excavator is well, basically a backhoe/forklift.  Just be glad it doesn't beep when you walk backwards.

I'll be in the wasteland tonight. Hoping to meet you! IGN: lucienyo 
---
I don‚Äôt hVe this issue, but am curious:  have you modified the ini file, or run any mods?
---
I would say it's pretty friendly to new players, that's in adventure mode at least.
---
If I‚Äôm not online shoot me a message. I‚Äôll try and sign on. 
---
Deleted my comment.  It was stupid.
---
We determined that it was impossible yesterday. We have no hard feelings against Bethesda. We remain optimistic that some way or another, it will eventually be possible. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7c54g/conclusion_to_operation_tourniquet_a_secret/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

Again, that community never has the same population. Some would have a lot of caps, others would not. Yall are trying to base the concept off of reality. That's not the case if I have 2000 caps and jump servers, the number of caps in that server changes same as the one I left. The reasoning your trying to attribute does not apply
---
Cool thanks 
---
Could have used your help last night lol. My main character is lvl 143 but I just started a pistols/gunslinger build. I moved some low level legendary weapons over so I'm not completely weak but lvl 15 strong is a far cry from 143. I'm usually on after 10pm central most nights (it's my cake day so not tonight) my PSN is Thumbnugget. I will take you up on the offer if it still stands some night in the future :) 
---
Haha don't worry about it. Sound works when I plug headphones into the controller for some bizarre reason. 
---
Thanks everyone
---
It didn't affect a large portion of the people playing the game. There were a bunch of trolls who were faking a lot of that shit.
---
Don't events still charge you caps for fast travel?
---
Irony.
---
You're saying I'm missing the point of survival mode like I've never played a "eat more, sleep more, less ammo, air hurts" difficulty version of games. This is awesome for single player games as an extended self challenge but we already have that style of survival lite being all of FO76
---
In this frame, you have to "Survive" to stay at the top 3. This means proving you can actively gather resources, escape ambushes, successfully fight off or out maneuver an entire servers worth of enemies. Real &amp; AI. 
---
I challenge you to go make a level 1 survival only character without any outside help from friend accounts or your alts, see how long it takes you to get 50 and how frustrated you get cause you can't find radaway or water
---
In a place where people just want to murder you for your shit, where you need to constantly be aware of your surroundings and have a game plan for you and your team,what do you consider "Survival"?
---
It would be cool if players can claim a module in T.O.W.N. and build their base on the plot of land. That would make it feel more like  rebuilding society. 
---
would create an unfair advantage tbf.
---
I'm sure they did think of it but in thats the way it could go in the wasteland. 
---
This would be great. Having a little farm with everything you need so you don't have to drop hundreds of caps just to grab 1 of this and 2 of that to brew for a daily. 
---
Fuck that was comprehensive. Thankyou very much. I've been experimenting with what I can do to increase cannibal efficiency and thus far I'm not getting much. I'm basically a melee.
---
Thankyou for this. You've answered a few questions. 
---
Lol its probably not coming till end of april or something,  not that they need time. They aren't keen to fix an issue banning few 1000 players but theyll allow unbanned people to continue duping ahahaha 
---
I play on xbox with an alt account and have been seeing people still dupe. Games as bad as the dam graphics haha.
---
How so?
---
Item displays are most likely coming on April 9th
---
Best open-world map yet.
---
I have full Sentinal assassin and I didnt exploit AND I think legendary PA would be dope. Seems like you are generalizing a bit.
---
TSE isn't even the best.  Bye Felicia.
---
Unforunately i'm having the same problem so no solution here. But for me, i was trying to do the daily quest where you bury the soldier and when i picked up his body, the quest didn't update and it just kept saying to pick up the body, but the quest marker was now on me. I think that maybe the two issues are related and that the game isn't recognising that the item has been picked up somehow. 
---
I have the green one ..u are thinking white powder jumpsuit
---
How do you receive the weapon? Is it one per account (whichever character completes it)?
---
VATS/Manual Both depends on the situaton
---
Ok here is the link to the evidence to both my claims https://youtu.be/5iLFi--Fsx8

Double post for visibility! Got a sexy "Armor begone" sniper from him just now

Got damn you proved me wrong I salute you sir 
---
Never seen that before that‚Äôs a new one 
---
Same deal as last time?
---
Same here. I've stopped taking workshops because of this issue, which also removes any motivation to power up any power plants.
---
Xo1. 
---
Excavator is better if you want carry weight, X-01 is better if you do not want armor made of rice paper. it is mostly preference. 
---
&gt;!IMO T51b is best!&lt;
---
Yes. 
---
The challenge for this week requires you to "Kill 25 legendary enemies." 
---
I have a character up to 12, only doing survival, with no legendary finds (little time to play) and i've met a few people that just enjoy killing you over and over even if the first kill didn't give caps junk or aid. I spend and store. 
---
That being said, so many events or landmarks have legendary enemies or a chance if you abuse server hopping your chances go up.
---
[This "Inside the Vault"](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview) shows that most of the weapons are lv45 or with 3\* and I imagine those are pretty accurate when you complete it. I have not yet.
---
I'm pretty set up already but I'll meet you after work and take something to pass on to someone. I've had a lot of requests from people that I wrote down and if they can get it for free they will be even happier
---
No prob man! I've had this problem numerous times in fallout, elder scrolls, you name it. It's almost always a conflict with textures due to the way Bethesda does their stuff and modders not doing it the same way. It's almost never game-breaking, thankfully, but it's always immersion breaking. 
---
But yeah, good luck. Def try the easier option first of no mods, then if that don't work, try a clean reinstall vanilla run. If it's cool, then try pop on mods and see if it's still kosher. Good luck, have fun, and enjoy your weekend too man. üòÄüëç
---
Looking for a reason whyüòÇ
---
Chrisblue it‚Äôs me xHaydog I miss you bb
---
Thx man. Do you have the nuka cola paint in your armour
---
Unblock me man lmao
---
I see them all the time in Harper's Ferry and Watoga. 
---
How do.i find there discord server?
---
But only by 13% if you have class freak 3
---
i can craft the Nuka cola paint for the 51, and the Quantum for the X-01
---
Just get smashed and do anything and you'll probably tick the boxes. The dailies and weeklies are 99% alcohol related now.
---
Bethesda devs have obviously discovered those coffee cups that say "this might be wine" and they're way too excited about it.
---
T51b is the best PA in the game bar none.
---
‚ÄúI will refrain from asking "what if you rape a man then" and proceed with the rest.‚Äù
---
Mate, you were the one who chose to use ‚Äúrape a girl‚Äù as a totally non-gratuitous example of something ‚Äúreally bad‚Äù (unless you save a bunch of kids in which case - rape away, you saint, you!). So if what you‚Äôre actually asking me is why we‚Äôre not discussing male rape - because you specificed ‚Äúgirl‚Äù in your original post?
---
On the other hand, maybe your question is genuine, since you seem to need to be told that rapists are bad, which I would have taken as common sense. So just in case you‚Äôre confused - yes, raping men is bad too.
---
Raping anyone or anything is bad. 
---
You can google the power armors and see how much of each defense they give. Some give more ballistic resist, some give more rad resist, the excavator gives the carry weight. 
---
Thanks for all your answers !
---
You have better luck than I do.
---
I check Watoga and Harpers multiple times everytime I'm on. 
---
Word. Weekends can be kinda weird for me as I‚Äôm working late and try to spend as much time with wife/kids as I can but message me anyway and I‚Äôll figure out a time we can meet up.
---
OhüòÇ. Was going to offer to make one for you. Looks like I‚Äôll be farming for T-51 now
---
Look, this is about the amount of code needed to create the world. There are ten thousand things we cant access or use that could be removed to make room. Now, on top of that, keeping the number of caps low makes it so instead of being able to buy materials we would all just buy them which would make the game shorter as we wouldn't have to grind constantly. Which would mean the dev team would have to release new content more often which would cut into Bethesda's bottom line as they would have to spend more time and money making said content. Nerfing the weapons, limiting the stash and cap limits, making us pay to fast travel, are a means of making the game take longer for the average player thus extending the time between releasing new content. During these gaps, the micro transactions are making bank. You really expect me to believe the nukashine quest that took all of an hour to finish cost bethesda all the money they have made sense the start of the game off those transactions? We are talking hundreds of thousands of dollars, likely a lot more. The dlc content should be massive for that price. Instead, make the game harder, take longer, and slower paced, and they can sit on new content until they pad their bottom line enough to impress the share holders. I'm pretty sure upping the cap limit or at least putting the caps we spend back into that limit would not kill the game. 
---
You own a workshop, you better be ready 2 pvp. I hunt workshop owners because of high easy profit and junk. Stop moaning and gear up
---
Wow ok. Is it expensive to buy on reddit 
---
Same, just got a stalker lever action rifle from him myself, perfect for my character. Very generous indeed, thank you for the opportunity Corvid, much love 
---
its the legendary effects that make it great, not the mods. Mods as a rule add minor changes, legendary effects can add tons of damage.
---
Nice thanks for your help
---
Hopefully just creeping watching to hear all the things we would like to see then just design new content based on fan fictions.
---
Hornwright Air Purifier #1. On the map it's literally a tiny walk South East of the billboard (The Rusty Pick?) on the map . (In the region South West on the map, I don't know the name of it).
---
From that spot directly to the main road was where the Lemonade stand was. I am not sure if it moves as I've never been back there haha.
---
Only works like this with uranium fever apparently.
---
I need to find a better handmade then, thanks for the info üëç
---
It's quite a mess, yeah.
---
Ahh! That is what I thought was the case haha. Glad I can use a Super sledge either way, love that weapon.
---
Yes. However if you have class freak maxed out it reduces the negatives to just 13pc.
---
In all honesty though, it is barely noticable when class freak is maxed, and you will quickly have more stim packs than you know what to do with when you have this mutation, so the negatives are pretty much trivial.
---
Move your camp box to somewhere else. I moved mine away from my house and it helped. Now I'm not falling off a cliff every time I spawn in
---
Agreed! They conducted an experiment, completed it, and published results. That's a successful execution if i've hever heard of one.
---
No one should be carrying all those aid items in survival.
---
He mods are. It had to be a lvl 50 set btw. You can just server hop to farm at the 5 or 6 PA spawn locations in the cranberry bog. That's what I did. Plus it has the nuka cola paint so that's cool.
---
I did it last legendary took me 4hours. I wanted sleep so much, but no way i could pass it. 
---
Didn‚Äôt get have a fast travel mat in the beta? If not then they should add one
---
besides.. i use 6 different paint jobs on my 51, all from the atom shop.
---
There is more people that have talked about this item
---
Ah nice tip, perhaps a mass workshop hoarding is in order, perhaps a break might also help, don't wanna be burnt out when it rolls out
---
Yh well thanks manüôÉ
---
i told him to leave shit in has stash but he said it put to much weight in it, now he paid the price
---
myself i head back to camp after any kills and store shit for adventure mode but im still very low on caps due to dying to god tier fuckwads
---
My teddy army is in slumber until they can populate my camp!
---
YW
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate yes
---
That is a whole other level haha don't think my bank account would appreciate it though
---
I went in with my level 20 character and have killed many level 50+ characters. Yeah, I die a lot but who cares. Don't spawn at a train station lol I'm loving the mode.
---
Wow, I'll definitely send you a friend request. What time zone are you in?
---
I also love all the little bits and bobs, truly the heart of fallout, relics of the past!
---
What are your specs? The minimum specs for FO76 are a lot higher than GTAV's recommended.
---
There's a bobble head. I've been there probably a hundred plus times and didn't know that. 
---
I‚Äôm Central time. 
---
And please do!
---
So plans are worth buying too? I have found a couple recipes and plans but not much so far. Mostly a lot of (Known) repeats.
---
Unfortunately the only outfits I like are the one in a billion with no real way of aiming for it, no-one seems to have a sure fire approach
---
Adjust your depth of field slider in your options.
---
Turn down the Depth of Field slider but it still remains a bit blurry after that.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I think they can create the ilusion of persistent CAMPs by filling new servers with random people's buildings. 
---
Uh Geforce gtx950 and intel i5 6400 running 76 on low 
---
Thank you for this excellent "junk" advice! This will be a real nice way to tame my hoarding habits and help me as I learn the game more. I will probably keep this up so I can see it whilst I play.
---
For ammo, you mentioned Lead and Steel. Do you also need gunpowder too?
---
there could be a 100 power version (rad shielded of course) that lets you grow nuked flora, maybe you could even turn out some high radiation fluids (every x-number of harvests?)
---
Just got stuck on the same spot.. ü§î
---
The reason you did not find a secret ending is because there no ending yet this just the start of the expansion. 
---
There are Fallout76Custom.ini settings to disable depth of field (DoF) and fog. Just Google that and you'll find the settings. I'll post my custom ini setting later when I am back at my computer.
---
The Public Defender is obvi a pump shotty. Bloodied because public defenders are savage beasts, and faster fire because their case load is massive
---
I carry X-01, T51b and excavator on me. T-51b is my go to for killing stuff, X-01 is my nuke zone set, and Excavator is my holy shit I need to go sell and I hope I can still fast travel set. Yeah thats 30 pounds of crap, but I have 15 strength and the excavator gets me to almost 500 pounds carry weight. I don't use the X-01 all that much, so I should put it in my stash, but that would require my stash to not be full all the time. 
---
every level 20 i've seen gets obliterated. fast.
---
Go anyway. The fact that danger is around every corner is kind of thrilling. Even fully powered you're not going to be rolling around Appalachia one shotting everybody, you're going to die no matter what. 
---
Like it or not, that‚Äôs not wrong. You see a pop up explaining that you‚Äôve opened yourself up to PVP when you claim a workshop. If you want to do it for a challenge and don‚Äôt want to keep yourself flagged then your best bet is to server hop immediately after claiming and getting credit for the challenge. 
---
People killing you within the bounds of the rules set by the game isn‚Äôt harassment, no matter how upset you get. 
---
1st. No they shouldn't remove legendaries because that would defeat the only purpose of the which is to get better gear.
---
2nd. No we shouldn't lose all the work we have out into this game since launch in order to play the new game mode.
---
3rd. You aren't supposed to be carrying 80 atoms and other aid in survival
---
4th. Players who one shot are using bloodied builds and can also be killed in one shot the majority of the time.
---
5th. Yes, the trainststions and spawn camping are a problem and it definitely needs to be fixed.
---
You and my buddy have been squirreling away legendaries for months now. He's got two characters at 800/800 waiting for this. I thought he was a lunatic (still do since there's currently no benefit) but he's going to have a lot of tokens. 
---
i wish growing stuff was more complex. Like needing fertilizer (makes that brahmin more useful) and a steady water supply. It would be a good way to balance out farming rarer crops.
---
I killed a level 90 and 100 yesterday using crits. It's def possible and hillarious when it happens.
---
So does XO-1 gove you extra rad resistance 
---
I've learned from my mistake the first time, but I don't want to take a hike from vault 76 to fucking watoga just because im scared of some spawn campers
---
Absolutely lots of spots that's not the issue the issue is it's an online game with people swapping in and out of worlds. If you reserve your spot in the world while you are not there the world wouldn have to keep you registered as a player. So if you and a bunch of others are at work or school that world will not have the full amount of players in it. I don't think Bethesda could program this properly ... 
---
I do like the idea of reserving a spot and always having my camp attached to others. Having a shanty town set up would be sweet
---
It was always going to be a mess. If it had been a separated game mode at launch it may have been better but the dupe bug exploits would have ruined it too. 
---
It would kill the in game economy, Caps would become completely worthless, there would be no grind when you could just buy anything you needed.  New content would last days instead of weeks as people could just buy everything instead of grinding it. New content would never be able to keep up at that rate.  So its far from any of the nonsense you are spouting.  
---
more than the t51b. 
---
with chameleon mutation or armour,  or only is there a sound every time you stop up, but the screen goes brighter too. Every time you stop up (while crouching of course).
---
That timer isn‚Äôt long enough. People are regularly reporting that they spawn in dead because of the time it takes to actually load enough to be in control of your character. 
---
Appreciated thanks
---
Indeed it was not. I've noticed lately that loot isn't instanced on all mobs, especially if you're on a team in a nukezone. I've tested it and of another team mate lots the body first, the high rad fluids and hardened masses etc are global loot but weapon spawns are instanced per player. For example, we kill a scorched conqueror. Me and my team mate are both looking, I see a hardened mass, 10mm pistol, and 6 10mm ammo. He sees the hardened mass, and a hunting rifle and 4 .308 ammo. If he picks up his hardened mass, it also removes mine, but if he loots his weapons mine remain.
---
Every single MMO type game from the past 20 years allows instant respec; usually for a modest monetary cost that doubles each use before capping at a certain amount. Others use a less common ‚ÄúYou can respec, but you have to wait a few days or something before you can do it again so choose wisely‚Äù option.
---
The fact this game doesn‚Äôt have any instant respec blows my mind. 
---
People will always complain about stuff. They are the same people who report players for killing them repeatedly. If you suck at PvP or don't want to risk the caps, don't play Survival. I die all the time but am having a lot of fun.
---
Are there plans for chainsaw that people have found?
---
Besides the former residents of Vault 76, there's like no humans to raid. RP wise there was only, at most, a couple hundred people in the vault, there's a good chance the RP "Raider" knew the other person. 76 was supposed to be a control vault, if you want to RP properly it would go more like this:
---
\*Raider: "Rawr! I's a Raider! My name is xX\_DETH\_Xx"  
---
Rational Person: "What? Your name is Steve, you're the vault orthodontist... We've met. Are you high?"  
---
\*Raider: "NO! I's a Raider! RAWR!" \*shoots TSE wildly in random directions\*  
---
Rational Person: "Shut up, Steve."  
---
\*Steve takes off his helmet and kicks a dented tin can\*  
---
Steve: "You're no fun."  
---
^(\*Not actually a raider)  
---
And they left. Never to be seen again, the Appalachian Wonderers of Operation Tourniquet went there separate ways. Going forth to provide truth and dignity wherever there was a need. Fighting back the hate with facts, fighting The Good Fight. It was here The Good Fight was born. It was here The Good Fight will thrive.
---
The story is absolute garbage. If you showed this story to someone who knows about storytelling, they will probably tell you it's shit.

---
X01 is better than Excavator in the ballistic and energy damage, and radiation resistance areas. Excavator is better if you add calibrated shocks cause you get an additional 200 carry weight, and with Excavator you get double the materials when mining ore. I personally prefer T51b, as it has more ballistic damage resistance than any other PA. I have the nuka cola paint on my T51b and the quantum on my X01 so I alternate them now haha
---
Bit I did not cheat. That's the entire issue here. I never cheated. Yet I'm still banned. 
---
Same! The game got too much hate id say but that hate made everyone so fuckin nice! It's like the Canada of online games
---
I lost my t51 nuka arm crafting x01 armor ):&lt;
---
IT TOOK SO LONG TO GET THE FULL T51
---
Crying inside.
---
T51 and xo1 are both badass tho
---
Kinda hope they bring fo3's enclave plasma armor into the game(doubt it)
---
Even if you‚Äôre in pacifist you will be able to damage someone who has challenged your workshop.
---
The only reason someone was able to keep killing you was because you kept spawning in the same area. Why would you do that when you could choose to spawn at your camp? Did you think that after being murdered a few times you‚Äôd suddenly stand a chance? 
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be mean here. It‚Äôs an honest question. The only way someone can farm you for caps is if you just don‚Äôt give up. If you get wrecked and don‚Äôt want to lose more caps then just bounce and potentially server hop. Don‚Äôt keep coming back for more punishment. 
---
1: Then tune down the legendaries so you arent 1 shotted by everyone or they dont take little to no damage
---
2: You pretty much lose all the work from cap gain and aid gain if you dont store your shit
---
3: some people have full stashes or dont want to weigh stashes
---
4: not everyone uses bloodied, theres explosive builds and chameleon builds that can be used to kill you in mere seconds
---
I just want this mode to be good, not something everyone stays away from because only the people with god tier builds or cheated in weapons stay at the top and drain you of everything you have on you
---
Is he really that quiet for other people? I'm on ps4, and he is a little quieter than other bots, but due to that fact that's he's isolated from the outside, there's basically no louder noise to overlap his. I've always been able to hear him just fine. Maybe he's much quieter on other platforms?
---
Biv voice seems fine to me. Its holo tapes on the other hand that are quite as hell no matter how max out I go. I had to put subtitles on.
---
I never cheated. Their system is flawed. I showed all the proof I have.

PvP in this game is a lost cause. 
---
Bethesda should just accept the loss and make another fallout and making it co-op with no pvp. 
---
Pvp doesn‚Äôt work with Fallout. I think that‚Äôs just the reality of it now. 
---
It goes to your inventory after completing. So probably only one per account, on charracter you killed last legendary with.
---
Caps diminish in value because they are easy to get. 1400 caps per day is close to 10,000 a week for a regular player. That's only from selling stuff to vendor bots, not including player sales and looting. This would make it way too easy to reroll some crap weapon into a bloody explosive boot in your ass.
---
That shit should stay rare and geting one shouldn't be as easy as buying a reroll token.
---
Naw dawg, the game is trash because the AI is LITURALLY the worst ever, the servers are LITUERALLY the worst ever, endgame sux because after getting to level 300 via exploits there is LETERAILLY nothing to do and it's waaaaay too hard to keep enough bullets around! Literally!
---
Yeah I don't get it either. I stalked some dude for a good ten minutes last night on Survival and jumped him when he was fighting a Mirelurk Queen. It was quick, efficient, merciful. I took his things and slunk away like a proper assassin. Great stuff.
---
Your heroic attempts to annahilate the Scorched menace once and for all and looking for a deeper meaning than just killing the same Bat over and over has been noted by the Brotherhood of Steel. Hail to you all, Steel be with you!
---
Durability levels contribute to overall damage resistance. Among these damage resistance is highest for t51b, followed by x01 and t60. There is a chance t60 have more dr if it‚Äôs repaired to over 100% and x01 is below 100% in terms of durability.
---
X01 is highly overrated in this game. Overall it has very good stats but t51b has the highest DR overall.
---
Good point lol
---
np. I believe all the power armors except for excavator have a set total value for rad, energy and physical resistance if you add them all up. XO-1 has less rads than ultracite, but has more physical and energy resistance instead. T51b has way less rads but also way higher energy and physical because of it. T45 and t60 don't really stand out in any particular way, so they are kind of meh, while excavator has the carry weight but way less resistances across the board. Raider i think is comparable to t45 and t60. 
---
At max level most people end up wearing one or two of the sets i carry, unless they really like the looks of another one. I have at least one of each set either on me or in my stash. Really Hope I can display them all at some point.
---
keep your spoiled food, 10 of them can be made into 1 fertilizer
---
They could make it so that you can use fertilizer to speed up the growth rate
---
You are completely right! My bastard level 50 was nothing compared to my now focused perk level 80. But I've spent the last 25 levels to get there. These days I can go mostly wherever I want and not be afraid of dying... 
---
Thanks.  At least I know it's still possible.
---
That's funny because I just fully upgraded a plasma rifle last night and I was shocked how great it was. Dropped my Handmade and Executioner's Ultracite on the spot.  
---
Right but there‚Äôs no way to verify that either way so of course the community is going to be at best split. I don‚Äôt think people should treat you poorly no matter what, but you have to understand why some might. 
---
Is that only available on browser  version as I don't see anything on the app? 
---
So here‚Äôs my question.
---
I usually just stay on the periphery in survival mode and collect xp.  Haven‚Äôt come across more than three or four people in the hours I‚Äôve played.  
---
Why would anyone ever fast travel into a railroad knowing there are probably people camping?
---
Are you suggesting that put a rocket on a sledge hammer and beat people with it?
---
All energy guns got a boost including plasma. The sniper variant actually outdamages my best guns now so I've canned the Handmade and Ultracite in favor of it. Best part is it weighs under five pounds. 
---
There are multiple farms and home stead‚Äôs in the Forest region which can be farmed.  Look for bags of fertilizer and break them down.  Also, food and platnts eventually turn ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù in your inventory and can be crafted at Chemistry station with acid into fertilizer.  
---
I love your methodology!
---
Good lord this is wholesome.
---
Too wholesome!
---
Raider card revoked.
---
Go to flatwoods and go to that place where you do fertile soil all that place is full of easy fertilizer also you could build ( if you have plans ) a fertilizer producer on camp with your own brahmin 
---
I always thought it could be a new quest... find the keys to the backdoor....  get in, get it on.... boom. Safe house. Like the Enclave, you can get back in only if you‚Äôre that far in the quest. It may have a second marker too.... not the main free 76 icon.
---
You can use the auto-doc, do some research.... buy basic supplies.
---
Maybe it wasn‚Äôt Vault Tec‚Äôs plan...... but seriously those ass hats have messed with so many dwellers!!!
---
Yeh That makes sense. I'm not sure how exactly but I have litteraly only had to repair my PA once and it takes a hell of a beating as I play with a super sledge. But I do have quite a few PA perk cards equipped 
---
They really should add this as an weekly endgame quest to give you some Flux 10-15and legendary gear. Like 2-3 2 to 3 star items.
---
Same goes the other way in level 190 I don‚Äôt want randoms going after me just because I already have an hour with no deaths , should never show players unless on your team regardless of leaderboard position
---
World of Warcraft, Diablo III, Path of Exile, Dragon Age, Borderlands, Dragon‚Äôs Dogma, etc. 
---
Do you even realize how many games with skill systems allow you to instantly respec? Basically all of them. It‚Äôs never pointless. It‚Äôs an RPG standard for a reason. Skills are not why people get invested in a game like this. It‚Äôs obtaining the best loot and clearing end game content that makes players feel rewarded and like they‚Äôre accomplishing something. Being able to respec allows players to complete those goals in the most enjoyable way possible.
---
Maybe you‚Äôre just some kid so I‚Äôm not going to insult you for your comment, but it does come off as fairly uninformed. Look up ‚Äúplayer agency‚Äù to maybe get a better understanding of the subject. 
---
Yeah, closing off the fissures and eliminating the scorchbeast threat seems like an end-game scenario. Not end-game as in what you do when your each high level, but end-game as in something they will drop for the final story content update to finish off the game
---
Exactly! Survival should be on the off chance you find another player you can engage in unrestricted PVP
---
That‚Äôs the beauty of the mire 
---
Google. Set up Xbox as home. Should answer all of your questions 
---
I must be doing something wrong as I have never had a weapon do over 300 damage. I have a melee build but even with max perk cards! strength increase etc I have never done over 300. any ideas? 
---
Perk cards doesn‚Äôt affect pa stats, they do affect weight, repair cost, crafting etc. if you repair a power armor using fix it good perk, it‚Äôs durability goes above 100%, damage resistance increase exponentially with it. Therefore a max level over 100% repaired t60 piece may have higher stats than an x01 piece with half of its durability left
---
It's most likely your specs, then. Both your GPU and CPU are below the minimum.
---
how did you get all of the recipes for the serums?
---
Thank you! I just did this after seeing your response and it has changed where I spawn. I‚Äôm still in the lake but much nearer the edge so I‚Äôll keep moving it until I spawn outside the lake. Thanks again, I didn‚Äôt think to move that!
---
I'm sorry, there is literally no excuse to not let say, 4 people, build closer together. If your system can't handle 4 camps in a proximity, upgrade your hardware. 
---
All boxes in your CAMP are connected to your stash, so your mule can't collect them.
---
This is why I just suicide as soon as Im in the top 5.  I died 3 times the first day of Survival to the same shit, now I kill myself and run and go get my loot and it resets your timer
---
Are you....okay?
---
there are a few power armor paints not in the atomshop, the ones i know of are
---
T51B Nuka cola
---
X-01 Quantum Nuka cola
---
T60 Brotherhood paintjobs (each rank of the BOS)
---
I have no idea how to replace those things or the money to do it. Is there some site I can look at to get info on what I need to buy/how to replace? I‚Äôm no computer whiz and don‚Äôt wanna break my only PC trying to add stuff to it 
---
Thank you. Good old google. Should have thought about that
---
Perfect! Thanks for the help
---
It helped a bit! Thank you
---
I bought them from other players. They drop RNG from the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
What about a paper sack drop?
---
How do I get them?
---
I‚Äôve got that one - it‚Äôs about the only one I do have!
---
Apart from that have cocktails but don‚Äôt have the recipes for the alcoholic ingredients :\
---
PM me if you‚Äôre PC and need some. 
---
Nah. Stealthboy'd Assassin's Deathclaw Gauntlet is much stronger. I only use it when other people do because people last 2-3 hits tops. Had a crew of three ~50 alts with TSE weapons converge on me a couple days ago, stealth'd up and slaughtered them all. 
---
On the plus side if you kill people using stealthboys you'll get a few for your troubles. 
---
I am not sure I understand your question.  
---
I can tell you that I have three framed sets T51, T60, and Excavator but prefer T51 for general use.   
---
I don‚Äôt mix and match except while i was farming for the rest of the set.   Yeah, I‚Äôm ocd like that, lol
---
If you leave the world the bag can disappear 
---
THIS. Nothing pisses me off more. I NEED A CLEAN SPACESUIT, PEOPLE.
---
Ok makes sense.   
---
lol what the hell happened here
---
These dudes jumped you and then gave you a Queer Eye house make over? 
---
How you gonna get back into that servers tho ? 
---
YouTube guide is your friend 
---
100% backed. Just bought them so I could optimize my space but I can't place it...
---
Just server hop
---
Yesterday I played for close to 4 hours only got killed 2 by other players as soon as I hit the 1 hour mark and it‚Äôs always the same MO sneak one shot or really close and melee wielding.
---
I went with the intention of getting those legendaries and found a group of 3 other players that joined me but then once we got a due of those griefers not even mini nuking with assasins gear seemed to had work ( over 800 damage ) so people idk maybe gear maybe cheat idk but I don‚Äôt go with the intent to havoc another‚Äôs player just reaping my own reward 
---
You know you can sell rad ant lager and tick blood tequila. Probably the high voltage hefe, too.
---
If you go after people just to PK, you're a griefer.    If someone isn't at their workshop and you kill contest it just so you or someone in your crew can kill them half-way across the map, you're just being a jerk. 
---
Hell, I'd argue that if you kill people AT a workshop you're a troll. Most people are fine to share the resources if that's what you're after.
---
Who knows? I find it odd that the Enclave bunker tracks fissure closures if there‚Äôs no point in closing fissures...
---
Best just to try n find someone with good karma or have a friend do it 
---
I'm just trying to collect all the rare outfits!!! That's all I want!!! PLS
---
Except I did. In as much detail as possible. No one gives a shit. So in just over it. Fuck trying to help people. 
---
You want to know why? Go through my post history if you feel like it. I posted how shitty my last 6 months have been, culminating in my grandma's death on Wednesday.
---
I'm done with people. Have a good one. 
---
I wish he would respond to comments so we know when he asks a question 
---
I have friends that will stay on the same server.   
---
I'm so tired of hearing this from people that seem to have never played an MMO that included any kind of PvP mechanic at all. This is the way things work with it, if you don't want to be involved in it, then heed the warning that pops up in your face when you take a workshop and DON'T TAKE IT.
---
Same thing with Survival mode... No, I don't want Bethesda to change this or that because people that don't understand the concept of adapt or avoid a clearly laid out game mechanic want to call it a bug or an exploit. 
---
It's NOT an exploit... it's not a bug... it's simple... if you don't want to put yourself in a situation where you may run into someone that enjoys stomping your non-PvP casual ass... then DON'T put yourself in that situation. Period.
---
\* And just to clarify... I've been playing MMOs since 1997... No I do not enjoy PvP... but I don't expect everyone to cater to my playstyle... I avoid situations that I know I can't (or won't) handle... and I adapt when I have to. Figure it out. 
---
Before the changes to slap damage I'd say high levels were avoided way more than low levels. As you've probably picked up, people tend to seek out the low levels to help them out. We get good, but low level gear even at high levels and a lot of players are happy giving it away unless we're hurting for scraps or hording until the legendary vendor releases.
---
Their time has come
---
Billings Homestead on the west side of the map is a great workshop to take.  Build a fertilizer producer over the phosphate deposit there and reap the benefits. 
---
We have 4 Xbox Ones. 1 is mine, then 3 are for my boys, ages 22, 17 and 13. I set my 13 year old's Xbox as my "home Xbox." He is able to use gold/live under his own profile on his xbox because it is set as my home Xbox and I have gold. 
---
It gets a little confusing with games. My older boys have theirs all set amongst friends and they say they share games all the time. My understanding is that if it's a downloaded game with no disk, whoever is using your "home Xbox" can play the game. If it has a disk, or came with a disk key, you cannot share and would need another copy of the game. 
---
Obviously. That‚Äôs what the butt of rifle is for.
---
I‚Äôm glad people actually did it but this is one of those things where it‚Äôs kind of like, no shit. I thought, when the game released, Bethesda said that the nukes are used to close the fissures meaning lore wise yes the fissures close. I thought that was the whole point of the nukes. It would be pretty stupid gameplay/MMO wise to have something one person/group of people did change the entire server. Gotta say though, Operation Tourniquet is a pretty badass name.
---
Then have them hold it dude lol or guard the bag your leaving it in 
---
I said the same thing a while ago, I would Absolutely love the return of the companion app. I mean destiny was able to make one as well that worked well with online so it is do able.
---
Yes it was so therapeutic!
---
And restrict one shotting of any kinds there‚Äôs no pvp if there‚Äôs no engagement there‚Äôs no shotting back it‚Äôs more like a glorified hot potato game and it‚Äôs sad because it‚Äôs the only way to get those exclusive rewards , i already got taken by a fool once because of their ‚Äúmask parade‚Äù 
---
0.003 % ... 
---
going into the menu for items or even the shortcut-menu takes your shooting, vats ect away, if i just lay down my phone and do a quick tap that would be a little unfair to people without the app.
---
I'd say number one, you probably either want to buy\\trade or grind legendary for some  **Bolstering(** Grants up to 35 Damage and Energy Resistance, the lower your health ) or **Unyielding**( Gain +3 to all stats except END when low health )  armor and bloody weps as that is the current OP build in game. Melee is a little harder for Survival I've found but the nice part is with just a few perk switch outs, us melee can switch to sniping pretty easily.  Its just hard to get close when someone is blasting you with a TSE shotgun and not even aiming because its AOE  
---
But basically with the right perks, mutation and armor, you run at like 20% health, using radiation to keep yourself there, but the massive damage resistance buff you can get means that as a melee,  normally if I power attack someone, I take them down about 80% life  - when I do manage to hit a fully spec'd bolstered person, it takes them from like 20% to maybe 15% - and if they are using a TSE shotgun, they can literally just shoot the floor and Im dead in typically 1 or 2 shots without the same armor\\setup\\mutations  
---
We have International_XT to thank for it. If he‚Äôs still out there. He dropped off the face of the Earth, apparently. 
---
Actually no, I write amateurly and have studied multiple different types of stories and honestly it's some of the better story telling I've seen in modern day AAA games, also I don't kno who hurt you but you should talk to them about removing the stick out of your ass. Have a happy day.
---
Excellent work!
---
I had seen one in my early days of playing (early December) and I've not been able to locate it since... Unfortunately the screenshots I had taken didn't get that player in them. Two visited me at my home I was making, one had been carrying like 8 or 9 PA frames and gave me one (which blew my newbie mind lol). 
---
Anyways the one was similar to this description, except how I remember this one was that it had a slit up the front so it could elegantly drape away, with a white second layer. Similar overall to what you'd see women in Westerns wear, or for any Browncoats here, the "pink ballgown" dress that Kaylee wore in the Firefly EP "Shindig", just... with a slit up the middle in the front. It, too, was slinky and very ruffled. It bounced with movement and swayed about when stopping. Twas very nice looking.
---
I've datamined the files for it and have come up short. No website had shown it as I remembered (not seen any dress in 76 with that front-slit). I've been meaning to make the Civil War dress to see if that indeed is it, since it's similar, as well as seems similar to the color I recall. 
---
Scrounge scrounge and scrap scrap scrap.  Craft craft craft.  Equip cannibal to eat stuff if you don‚Äôt want to craft food.  Check out the various perks,etc online and tailor your build to your play style.  
---
It‚Äôs tough out there.  
---
I just buy it. It's easier to farm stuff to sell to vendors than to farm balistic fiber itself.
---
Stealthboy'd Assassin's Deathclaw Gauntlet...
---
Available at all good hardware stores, don‚Äôt delay buy today!
---
the Nuka cola paint jobs (both) are a part of unmarked quests, you will have to just find the parts needed.. or ask youtube
---
the BOS paint jobs are a part of brotherhood quests as rare rewards. the easiest to complete though is the quest "forbidden knowledge"
---
Then why bother with disabling pvp at events at all? 
---
You could ask over at /r/pcgaming, /r/pcmasterrace or maybe /r/buildmeapc for info. They'd most likely be glad to help you out.
---
huh, weird
---
I am not talking about that i am just saying there is no real ending yet 
---
That's interesting cause I can hear him as soon as I enter the tattoo parlor. 
---
Make some new plants maybe by co bing different resour es then waiting for that fungi to grow, combine those new plants with other new plants to make even newer plants
---
Great! I'll be on prolly around 10pm your time.
---
Or maybe that's the start of the end game. The whole reason for the vaults was to protect us from nuclear fallout and the radiation. We just set of a nuke because of the scorched. Now we have to learn how to survive in a nuclear winter. 
---
"Gearing up" consists of either hoping someone has what you're looking for on your build and is willing to sell it or relying on RNG.  Sort of hard to "gear up".
---
friends: why the fuck are you playing fo76. theres nothing to do
---
me: i know, but i need to finish building my camp(and rebuild...and upgrade...and rebuild...and improve)
---
friends: WHY
---
me: I DON'T KNOW.   
---
This is a good point, but why allow us to move special points at all in that case. 
---
Lol gonna keep my base rightbwhere it is hahahah
---
It‚Äôs Beta.  Leave for now, come back later.  
---
What‚Äôs the difference from that to using a gaming mouse with hot keys or the H button for stimpaks?
---
Have you tried a different character? Just thinking you have something like a corrupted save file, as that would sometimes hit me in FO4.
---
Sorry I am new to Reddit.  You see, I‚Äôm just a caveman that fell into some ice and was frozen....and then thawed out by your scientists.  Your karma system and reddit demon magic frightens me and makes me want to run into the woods and smash things.   I.....I don‚Äôt know how to react.   But......what I do know, ladies and gentlemen, is that Lumpy31 needs and deserves a means to store all of the shitty 1* gear he‚Äôs accumulated playing this game!
---
K well don't be surprised when it gets fucking destroyed ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yeah and I feel for you (condolences on the loss of your grandma), but again you have to know that there will always be people who don‚Äôt believe you. This is thanks to the people in every game ever who have been banned, claimed to never have cheated, and went through great lengths to manufacture ‚Äúproof‚Äù (edited screenshots etc.). 
---
Honestly, I believe you, but there‚Äôs a 0% chance that everyone would.  It sucks, it really does. I think the only chance you‚Äôd have is if Bethesda themselves chimed in and said that you didn‚Äôt dupe. I‚Äôd bet that even then you‚Äôd have people who don‚Äôt believe it. This community is filled with people of all different levels of intelligence and reasoning capability (see the posts of people calling getting killed while holding a workshop ‚Äúharassment‚Äù for a funny example of dummies).  You can scream facts until you‚Äôre blue in the face and still have people that refuse to believe. 
---
Hang in there, man. Make some friends, choose them wisely, and try to remain as positive as you can both in game and IRL. 
---
Sold a 2* at whitesprings last night. If I loot another will keep you in mind. I seem to find them every couple of days. 
---
I was playing today and none of the top three were showing up on the map.  I didn't think you could hide your position by crouching in survival. Was this a bug?
---
Lol try me
---
Where can I find that outfit lol
---
You're not on xbox, otherwise I totally would, trick ass bitch
---
üòÇ
---
people take chances. maybe they spawn there to have an easier time hunting legendaries at a location near a station, maybe to quicky sell shit and fast travel to camp for safety, maybe to kill an unsuspecting player. maybe to do a mission for the extra XP 
---
Lol oh boy threats over text damn im shaking
---
Nah
---
Cool. I‚Äôll try and be on. 
---
Any stash in your camp counts as your stash box and they use same stash pool as known your stash box.
---
For example, your metal box will show you every item in your blue stash box. 
---
Have to go mutations, bud. I didn't want to but after seeing the power they have, at least for now the no mutant creed of the Brotherhood has to go.
---
[Here's my PvP build in the SPECIAL Planner](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fc54578&amp;d=s92ss2sg2se2sf2lt2lu2l71pd2pp2pl2pk2eh2ej1c70ck0i12ir1am2a12ae0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=14efgh). Currently all of my Unarmed weapons do well over 300, around 330ish. My main boo is an Instigating Mole Miner's Gauntlet that will do almost 700 damage the first hit. If I'm in combat with another melee person, I'll switch to an Assassin's Deathclaw Gauntlet because it also has +40% attack speed. Both of them will molest other players. 
---
Were you already at the site watching the fireball or still at the control complex?
---
Probably not out just yet. 
---
I agree. Should be changed to the top three with the highest kills. 
---
I am still just level 23. Would it still be ok for me to message you? Looking for powerfist/deathclaw gauntlet with a nice modifier(anti armor,furious?) / and or lever action gun.(explosive, two shot, furious or anti armor?) Would be nice to have something at 45/50 :)  running / building a unarmed/rifle build atm while leveling
---
because H only uses 1 type of stimpack.
---
and you'd still be left with ps4/xb1
---
Actually I may go back to survival mode. Going to give it a go with zero caps in my pockets, no aid or junk. Also with the drop a nade when I'm dead perk. I'll get the last laugh on them üòÇ
---
Sounds good ty
---
Only way, unless of course you have other workshops on the boil.
---
PA already comes with some sweet features, if it got legendaries then there would be 0 reason to use normal armor. Normal can't negate rads, negate fall damage, give a bunch of extra carrying capacity or auto buff melee. This doesn't even include mods or PA's coolest unlockable feature: flying.
---
I'm not trying to say that PA is OP, because in PvP it is nowhere close to it, but both types of armor have their own benefits that the other does not. Giving PA legendary effects would just mean it completely out classes regular.
---
I just had a similar thing happen, but I was in a nuke silo. I destroyed the last mainframe core and boom, server crashed. This is the 4th time since I started playing this afternoon that either the game or the server I was on has crashed.
---
It has been even more unstable than usual for me since the last patch. Gonna go play something else instead of getting more annoyed with this :/
---
It also has +40% attack speed. Some rando sold it to a vendor in Watoga, bought it for like 240 caps and I've been terrorizing other players with it since. Thank you based rando
---
I like it! Good place to meat new players too. 
---
(After nukashine blackout)
---
Just destroy it. 
---
The vendor still spawns even if there is a base there.  Look around a bit before you become a dick to some random player.
---
Sounds like a nuclear strike is in order, lol. 
---
I suspected they may be in weapons range, but didn't want to get hopes up lol Particularly since they *would* go down outside of the playable area.
---
On the flip side, maybe they were set to congregate there so that they were quickly able to be taken out, so if you already had the proper number of Nuclear Cards, their cargo wasn't relevant? 
---
One may only need to go there \[Point Pleasnt\] a bunch of times on various servers to get the maximum number that fly around out there, which may *(or may not)* provide a hint to the number of Fissures that need closing in total. Noting the min and average may also not be a bad idea, for data-collection sake
---
Hang out in flatwoods and murder some bramin. That‚Äôll re supply your food. For resources hit up the mine north of town. You‚Äôll come out with a tons of resources. You‚Äôll also probably be over encumbered so having a camp nearby is a good choice.  And if you need more take the workshop to the west of flatwoods. And if your worried about people wanting to kill you for it. Set a 30 minute timer and swap servers when it goes off. 
---
what they mean to say is, you loose caps equivalent to your level, double in Survival.
---
Thank you :)
---
return to low level sector near flatwood if you take your time to search arounds you can find what you need in a matter of hours
---
Thanks guys.  I‚Äôll just keep using the risky method unless one of my friends is around.  Don‚Äôt put anything in an empty box you aren‚Äôt willing to lose.  That‚Äôs what she said.  
---
Of course that is an option, but why not be able to give up a ws without doing that? There are many reasons that someone might not want to leave the server that they are on. Server hopping is treated like a cure all game feature, when it really shouldn't be. imho
---
You missed the whole "without leaving the server" part. Honestly, they need a way to abandon/concede workshops. Make it so a person doesn't have to quit the game and restart (hyperbole, don't kill me) just to be able to do something. 
---
Do you start all your sentences with ‚Äòlol‚Äô ?
---
Orbital strike grenade
---
Uno memento por favor
---
sounds like someone is in your house in Chameleon.   
---
I am ok with the system the way it is.. but to add to your point, which I think would probably be cool and not really that far of a stretch from the feel of older Fallout games... would be a Skills system that works along side the perks. Maybe put Picklock and some crafting stuff on that list... that way we still have to make choices that matter... but it's separate from the perks. 
---
Agreed - I don't know how everyone survived with 400 stash. 
---
No. Bad idea
---
Thanks for the info sir
---
4th It's a bit tricky to turn around and kill a bloodied player after they've killed you.
---
That works.  
---
‚ÄúFriends‚Äù that I may have once drunkenly smashed white springs with.  Don‚Äôt really ‚Äúknow‚Äù them and it seems like an imposition.   It‚Äôs fine. 
---
Caps farming exploit that needs fixing.
---
I really appreciate the write up!  I‚Äôll just out the video.  Build sounds ridiculous 
---
Just the ones that got me laughing my ass off . lol so sure hahahahaha
---
This.  
---
Look at me answering comments!   Thanks guys. 
---
The point of this mode is to *force* PvP on everyone. 
---
OK lol
---
Yesssss! I'm fully on board with this! Sneaking is a way of life down here!
---
I logged into a server last night and was number three on the leaderboard with 3 mins. Whut. Had to hit up my C.A.M.P. in secret and thankfully some 1hr dudes logged in to take the heat off of me. 
---
I was dicking around in Watoga when I saw a dude's goodie bag pop up nearby. So I start tracking him by the sound of his gunshots which leads me to him dropping his loot bag (again) to a Mirelurk Queen. 
---
I'm Assassin's 4/5, Chameleon 1/5 24/7 so I slowly inch up to the battle site with my AA Gauss ready to go. I see him dancing on rooftops, trying to snipe the queen, completely unaware that a much more dangerous enemy is lurking behind him. When I get in VATS distance I switch to my Assassin's Deathclaw. He dances a little more, is getting wrekt by her poison. At this point I'm directly underneath him, waiting for him to come down. At around 40% life he jumps down to heal and one swipe finishes the job. I collect his bag and slink away. 
---
And wouldn‚Äôt you know it.  ‚ÄúTake me home, country roads‚Äù comes on right when I load in. 
---
I have but the same issue occurred. I've reinstalled the game so I'm hoping it'll sort itself out. Luckily I managed to finish 'mayor for the day' earlier so I'll just stay away from the municipal centre. 
---
Some folk get real excited over the small stuff i love it. 
---
Lol not sure where I said anything that would constitute me being a dick, other than the random troll who commented, but okay buddy go off I guess
---
I kind of like them  ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Over the course of three sentences, by the looks of it! lol
---
Kinda, don't think I've seen some shit like that nor heard of it 
---
Absolutely incredible job by all involved. Thanks for putting so much effort into this!
---
Grenades do almost nothing against someone with fireproof and a dense mod. You'll catch someone though lol
---
I want that red gun at Fort Defiance for my base.  Solved.  
---
Beat me to it. 
---
I dunno, I made it to #1 in under an hour just by hiding in some grass. I stayed #1 for about 20 minutes when I got bored and logged out so someone else could have it. 
---
It'll come out with one of the Wild Appalachia updates in April, iirc.  Check the roadmap for more details.
---
I‚Äôve always repaired camps I come across and kill anything attacking it, doesn‚Äôt cost much and it‚Äôs kinda fun.
---
Lucky, I still haven't seen the Lemonade stand. 
---
I too was constantly out of plastic. And then I remembered from early on, the high school has a shit ton of plastic! Those plastic pumpkins, plates, forks, bowling pins and a few golf balls. All in the gym and cafeteria areas. One run gets me close to 100 plastic. 
---
True! And yet, everwhere you look there seems to be a screwdriver laying about... So I'd say it's not outside of reason that the one we're using is one that happened to be nearby. lol
---
There's quite a few years of Synth infiltration and Brotherhood rebuilding ahead.....
---
Neat idea!   BGS, are you lurking?  üòÅüëç
---
Same tho, even if it's like one wall
---
Still experiencing this after the latest update. :/
---
Sounds like dick.
---
Just server hop again. I don't see why it's an issue.
---
And for those saying just destroy them, what if they're a new player who doesn't realise there's a random encounter there? All you're doing is showing this person the community can be shit. If they're there, put your mic on and explain. Don't just destroy. They won't know why.
---
We‚Äôll look into it
---
Getting on 
---
...
---
Yes I do...
---
Thanks for the input 
---
Ohhhhh, ok. I've looked for my bag a few times and it was certainly not where I died, so I've been rather confused. 
---
Good luck I hope it helps!
---
Oki :)
---
I've had my bag pop up recently no where even remotely close to where I died, though. 
---
We could have an equivalent to Eve Online‚Äôs corporations so we can easily share amongst our characters and other players, without the hassle and risk of brown paper bags. 
---
Yeah!  I‚Äôve been on it since the beta and it was rough.  Really, it still is rough.
---
Same, you have to deal with you junk responsibly, if you lose a hundred pounds of plastic it's your own fault lol. 
---
Excellent 
---
but it loses meaning when literally every player uses the perk
---
That place is bugged there‚Äôs a spot that worked for me closer to church right side.
---
Regularly spawns in a shed at the rangers station north of Watoga. 
---
‚ÄúI wish there was a fallout pvp game‚Äù said no one ever 
---
The game has gone on sale multiple times already, I bought it for like $20. 
---
Yea, PA unequips all armor and stat increasing items until you exit the armor. I used to only use PA, now mainly unyielding combat armor.
---
Who cares about reviews? If they buy the game and give a bad review and get a refund they're not playing it. 
---
I am fairly certain that if you are sneaking, you will not show up on the map. I don't know 100% though
---
Thanks a lot !
---
War. War never changes.
---
I too had my base there as it was the prime location for trade.   Someone stopped by and politely informed me of the vendor spawn issue.  It was an undertaking, but ultimately relocated.  
---
Not that hard, i 
---
TSE = shooting kittens in a barrel... boring and pointless.
---
I just tried all around the church, no luck :( thanks anyway! 
---
They said, at PAX, that they're eventually going to introduce some kind "Seasons" where people do have to start new characters to participate.  This really is just the shakedown run of Survival, I suspect it'll get better.
---
im on pc and this game has caused my computer to freeze up twice where I had to restart it. This is the only game I have had this issue with
---
At the conference yesterday they indicated they want to give the camp system a whole lot more love in the future, especially after seeing the sense of pride and accomplishment it gives players.
---
Well considering i have 2 fully geared characters I would disagree
---
Quests, events, super mutants, cap stashes, selling unused armor &amp; Chems. I usually farm about 500-700 caps in a weekend. 
---
Gather plants and wait till they expire and they'll turn into spoiled veggies, use a chem bench to turn these into fertilizer. The fertilizer to spoiled food rate is 1 fertilizer : 10 spoiled food.
---
Raise his voice but please lower that new sound effect when you go into adventure mode. my neighbors don't want to hear my server hopping üòÇ
---
There will never be a real ending.  I suppose at some point there will be a new game that takes place in a new area and at that point maybe they create an ending to help migrate us all to the new game.  But until then the whole concept of an endgame is boggling to me when people bring it up.  If you are Bethesda, why would you have an endgame?
---
Legendary? Are you sure? What are the legendary effects?
---
A lot of people try to sell it. Some just junk it. I and a butt ton of people put it in the cash registers or suitcases of low level train stations to help lowbies.
---
I did have a disease
---
Really fun, along as you remember it's just a game and they're just caps ;)
---
Sell it to other players
---
Love that xp
---
And honestly if you stay away from the train stations it‚Äôs a lot like adventure.
---
Last time I was in survival mode we killed the SBQ.
---
Save up for Civil War Top Hat plans. The hat costs 1 cloth to make and sells for 25 caps at vendors.
---
Seems like a reasonable thing to do. 
---
Except at a broken down camp at Whitesprings. We need a urinating emote for times like that.
---
Is it a level 50?  Do they go to level 50?
---
I looked at the list of the items available from the challenges.  They are all dogshit that wouldn't fetch more than a couple thousand each.  Chances are you'll find a better item on all the legendary mobs you have to kill to get it.
---
And yes, letting people in with duped gear and full assassin sent/cav sets on their lvl 50 or so adventure mode guys who were made for a format that didn't yet exist seems bad as well. 
---
Would I have to buy them from a player or a vendor?
---
The Enclave is in Fallout 1 though so you fail.
---
It will get easier, once they add in player vending and the shopping gallery in the next update. You will be able to sell up to 1400 in whitesprings, since they will be putting all vendor factions there.
---
With seasons and forced restart in a game like this, where you're supposed to farm for goodies and hoard loot, it will not be worth even playing in survivor for any reason. The xp increase means nothing, all of it means nothing if it's all just wiped at the end.
---
" Make everyone start the mode with a brand new character and if your ass dies then you bad that's it that character is dead pal. "
---
I like it, but kind of limits the choices on build (low health builds would be horrible). I been getting great amounts of xp. Blow yourself up before you get in the top 3 and grind. I seen a wanted high level (5 caps) earlier, that's a way to get around the cap farm but you can see them on the map.
---
Ahh okay, thanks!
---
I will try my luck, thanks!
---
To allow some wiggle room without making SPECIAL completely pointless.
---
What a great service. I just added you. I think I have some extra flux I can donate to the cause 
---
Great! Stop on by!!
---
I certainly hope so. I'd really like to see a game where in PVP you really are AFRAID TO DIE just like in RL. Fallout is the perfect game to try this kind of PVP out.
---
..the most useful place would be wherever I'm questing at the time..but my wife tells me the world doesn't revolve around me, so really anywhere on the right side of the map? central.. maybe close to Whitesprings
---
Look man, the dude was unhappy about low level characters not having a chance in Survival.  I have him some news to give him a little hope.
---
They're not going to take away your old character when they add Seasons or whatever. Don't be so negative
---
If you‚Äôre in a team go to SoCial tab before respawning and travel to teammate 
---
I have full crit. So you're telling me there is 2 ways to play this game. Be a melee build or strickly use bloodied, unyeilding, full rifle, crit?
---
Makes sense. Wish I would‚Äôve found that in the BBS days!
---
A player. They typically go for around 2500 to 3000 caps. Alternatively you can try to find the plans yourself, but that takes some sever hoping. 
---
Mine is level 20.  Not sure if that is maximum?  
---
Yes the legendary es that spawn from that event are level 5 and 10. You may b better off crafting certain weapons tho. A lot of them are not as strong. 
---
Ok thanks for the help man and sorry abt your armourüòÇ
---
Thank you.   
---
I drop all my unwanted ammo in the overseers cache in the Flatwoods church. 
---
What system are you on? I'm always looking for ammo?
---
Alright, just need to confirm their level now then. Thanks for the insight on the collecting experience.
---
I'm at level 275 and do my best to help lower levels get started by crafting weapons, underarmor, armor, etc. for them.  My IGN: cyberhawk1 if you need anything.  
---
No. If I go and see someone‚Äôs camp is messed up I‚Äôll go and fix as much of it as I can.
---
I‚Äôm level 53 and carry xo1 and excavator and their the only ones I have. Should I carry T51 as well or stick  to what I have
---
Haha nice 
---
It has always let me, it was just if I wanted to build anything else it was a no go. 
---
I think that's an important point. Something in game tracks the fissures, if they are opened or closed. Meaning there's something to it, but it's probably not implemented yet. This gives me hope for some real in depth stuff later.
---
Oh, I'm still around, don't worry about that. I just like to torch my accounts regularly because I'm paranoid. You guys are the true MVPs, and I'm so happy you were able to do together what I alone could not.
---
The Overseer said it better than I could:
---
&gt;The more I travel this godsforsaken "Wasteland," the more I realize what truly destroyed West Virginia. And what destroyed any chance the survivors had of actually surviving. Mistrust. All these divergent groups... Responders, Brotherhood of Steel, whatever. Separately, they had everything necessary to beat the odds. Brains, brawn, and bravado to spare. And what did they do? Close ranks. Get paranoid. Refuse to work with one another. And it cost them all their lives.
---
&gt;People of Vault 76, if you're listening... DO NOT fall into the same trap. **You find each other. You work with each other. Only TOGETHER will you win. This is your Overseer.**
---
&gt;And I'm begging you, please... Save our country.
---
I believe they're still 10%, I know the brahmin is. 
---
I suggest post in one of the fallout sale and trade groups for a cheaper price. Most will sell the plan at a fraction of what the vendors charge 
---
If youre on ps4 ill be your body guard for 5k caps an hour . 
---
Classic
---
That would be great, I'd love little terrariums in my CAMP. 
---
Overall I'm actually enjoying it. And no, I don't have assassins sentinel gear and some super explosive surrogate dick.  I have 1* bloodied weapons and mostly 1-2* unyielding gear, and I hold my own ok. As long as serendipity procs :-D
---
I think one big issue for me is, there is really no incentive to prevent you from just killing everyone the instant you see them.  You're actually at a severe disadvantage if you don't do that. 
---
No it‚Äôs at watoga train station 
---
No level requirement.
---
All building sets are available 100% of the time at Whitespring Station since like... Patch 5.
---
What a god.
---
I don't think the pvp scaling is the issue if you're level 40 with a crappy build and still using a level 10 pipe pistol. I don't think you should be doing damage at all.
---
The Bobby pin box what a riot!!
---
Hit the workshops until you get the brahmin pen plans.
---
Haha!!
---
It isnt There either
---
I had a 3* level 1 pipe rifle.
---
Yeah murdering people is fun but I must request you don't farm people that're a quarter of your level like most people. 
---
That's typical with all of the "Take Photos" challenges.  There are a few that are just mysterious in terms of what the game wants you to focus on.  Just move on to a different one if it doesn't work.
---
Not to be a poop, but how are you dropping hundreds to get anywhere? I did some math and with the perk that lowers cost of fast travel I could make it from the edges of the map for like 45 caps. If you use your CAMP and Vault 76 as free points, it would be way cheaper, too.  Depending on where your CAMP is, of course. 
---
Will try to see if its There its certainly not at any other station that Ive been to
---
What is the point of having a bunker if the nukes do not penetrate inside white springs?
---
I suggested this a while back and people didn‚Äôt get this is what I was requesting. 
---
The building sets are pretty much the only thing Whitespring Station sells.
---
Watoga tracks the number if players and robots on the main sign. Bethesda dies things like this because they can and it is a cool touch, nit necessarally because they didn't anything on a grand scale 
---
I agree totally with you. It would seem to be a reasonable basic function to be able to abandon a workshop at anytime. Server hopping is just immersion breaking for me personally...I'm no multiverse travelling Time Lord, just a mutated, filthy vault guy in a dress..
---
Best thing is to take the death, go to the map screen to respawn, then just log out of the server. Respawn right where you were without the corpse run!
---
My main alt is a cannibal and can drink whatever water she wants. She's also supported by my main so junk acquisition isn't too important.
---
Not really minding the PvP deaths at all.
---
Yes please, the whole "just make new characters" argument is awful, I shouldn't be more or less forced to plan out every single level and perk I take. 
---
This isn't a game like WoW or other traditional MMOs, there are no classes, every character you make is more or less the same until you start pumping perks into them.
---
But yeah, just let me toss a couple hundred caps at someone so I don't have to restart and lose everything. Thanks
---
The forest is your place to stash up items and aid. Just use melee weapon on low level stuff if low on ammo.
---
This is why it would make a cool raid. We know there's a weapons cache that was confiscated when the bombs went off, so we can go in to get them, but in the meantime maybe something has escaped from underground to make it a high level, dangerous fight
---
1. Just because people dont wear it doesnt mean shit, if the masses walk from a cliff will you follow?
---
2. As for why its stronger than t-60 idk some dude in bethesda decided
---
3. Excavator and ultracite will be getting more paints in the future
---
Exemplar's T-60 torso 
---
Reduces AP costs in VATS by 10% 
---
Visionary's T-60 helmet 
---
Increased AP refresh speed 
---
Honor (T-60 left leg) 
---
Vengeance (T-60 right leg) 
---
Reflects 10% of melee damage back at the attacker 
---
How much for the deathclaw gauntlet?
---
Or those folks who play that are not Reddit users.
---
I can never find a screwdriver in my house when I need it. Your luck may be different.  
---
Yup some asshat hunted me down on the map when trying to harvest acid from a workshop. Deep in a fight with super mutants and a stealth death tambo loser murders me. Forgot about the getting hunted on the map when owning a workshop. Blocked and changed servers. Fixed problem that time.
---
Agree PVP should simply be removed from workshops. Currently it's a bad experience when asshats who can't cut it in Survival do this to compensate. Put a timer so you can only hold a workshop for 2 hours before possibly conceeding to another player. If someone contests it, they get it for 2 hours. If you can't wait 2 hours, jump to another server. 
---
I think this is the main reason, also, why we don't see a Bos/Good Guy faction.  Because battles are often over before you know it, everyone is encouraged to shoot first and ask questions later.  Players have absolutely no reason to trust one another in this mode and it probably won't happen unless they actually implement some kind of faction system.
---
Go back to the sims
---
Oh yeah, I understand they'll do virtually nothing. Fun though.
---
Same
---
 *Stop trying to decide how PvP modes should be based on your own experience.* 
---
maybe take your own advice too...
---
Fair enough. I'm not trying to bash them too hard (I did get carried away) but i don't feel like there's any reason not to allow the other paints on those armors
---
Hard bargain perk
---
Gives people interesting choices, the way I see it.  
---
Give me a drinks machine i can chill nuka cola in
---
Add a medieval building set
---
Add a glass n steel building set
---
Gun rack for the wall of my camp and weapon rack for non gun weapons
---
Display cabinet for trophies.
---
How about i can put a scorchbeast head on my camp wall
---
Fridge to keep food good longer
---
Meds cabinet
---
Scope and other improvements for xbow
---
If your ‚Äúfriend‚Äù leaves the server not knowing what you are doing, you risk losing the items you are trying to transfer. 
---
Thanks! Was curious how it worked
---
I will have to do such things when I'm a higher level and can afford to spare junk
---
Some people can only play at night and there are limited servers it seems.
---
Do you not have to go to the ones that are listed to complete it? 
---
Tbh, personally i'm perfectly fine with the sound of my gauss rifle firing to indicate someone just got PvP'd \^\^ 
---
Yep, that what I'm seeing as really the only option. So maybe they should put in non-PA jetpacks in the game (was thinking of a way to add more carry weight to cover calibrated shocks, but they are coming out with backpacks soon), and maybe some way of making your armor electrified as a non-PA Tesla coil mod. 
---
Watoga Shopping Plaza has all plans.
---
Had that glitch happen at a workshop a month ago. The loser was trying to farm me using repeated death cycle. Had to hard reset PC to stop the fleecing. Still lost about 240 caps while trying figure out how what the hell was going on
---
My mule account key should come in tomorrow by mail. From what I gathered, you can use the same computer to run 2 instances of fallout under 2 accounts. Trade and alt-tab? If that doesn't work, I guess a vm should (but it'll be slow) or worst case put in on a second computer. All I know is I'm not dropping anything. Lost good stuff in paper bags before dropping at a friends camp (disappears).
---
I would totally take you up on this if yoy were pc. Just long enough for the weekly challenge.
---
For real. I did that the other day and one guy refused to move. He was a lower level, so I told him if he was there it would interfere with a rare vendor spawn, and he thumbs downed me and I noticed he was still there hours later. 
---
I was using the instigating Deathclaw *** with faster swing and +1strength.  Then I switched to the bloodied version of it.  My goodness!!!   I can now hit for thousands of damage.  Very OP but the trade off is you have to be at low health to really get those numbers.  
---
This word, "griefer", is a fuckin cancer. You are in a pvp game, you *can* escape the pvp mechanic. Yet, if you fail to (by picking a workshop for example, which is *clearly* stated as a PVP action by the way), you are putting yourself in danger. Thus, you are not "griefed", you are killed because you and you only put yourself in the exact situation where it's possible.
---
Death has almost no penalty for the smart player. Drop you junk when you are taking a workshop, simple as that. Or, if you don't want to be "griefed", stay in adventure, activate pacifist mode, and stay away from workshops. They are worthless anyway.
---
If you want to trigger the quests "take a workshop" and "defend it", then just pick one, stay the time the second quest triggers, and leave the server. Boom.
---
Might have been those damn mole rats.......they love walls.....lol
---
I have a plasma flamer, and best I can tell, it acts like a laser with a fancier visual, as far as what it can hit. The cloud of green flame it shows doesn't actually hit anything, only the spot you're exactly aimed at (of course it can hit anywhere within the crosshairs as the bloom outward from movement and stuff).
---
Drop it or give/sell it to other players. I keep one gun of each caliber and switch back and forth depending on how much ammo I have.
---
What a dick, hate people like that. You can put your camp ANYWHERE, yet choose to stay in a spot that can spawn in a rare vendor. When I was told that I was built where stuff can spawn (Overseer's camp) I moved cause I'm not a dick, and I can put my camp anywhere else!! What a concept!!
---
Absinthe doesn‚Äôt make you hallucinate. But using the can could make A new type of drink.
---
Lol, would have been funny. Unfortunately it wasn't mole rats, would have preferred mole rats tbh
---
Do you really not see that you in fact just validated everything said ? Why could there not be a happy medium between the two extream?
---
I‚Äôve repaired Whitespring camps behind the club house, climbed up to their perches and dumped bags of loot from my ghoul killing route at their feet and run off üòÇ they just stand their like statues.
---
1. If people don't wear it, then it means it doesn't have a very decent viability. So it means exactly shit, it makes my point more valid even. If nobody wears it, why not put out paints for the ones people ACTUALLY use the most?
---
2. I know you had nothing to do with it I was just wondering if there was some lore-based answer as to why.
---
3. I assume as much, cuz they keep adding more content. But why exclude excavator and ultracite when paint jobs work on EVERY other armor? It makes no sense. "Oh sure you can have camo armor, but not on the one you want. Nope. Why? Cuz.... "Excavator and Ultracite will be getting more paints in the future." All I'm saying is paint is paint, it should be applicable to all PA. It's not like the paint thinks "Ew gross! I don't want to be put on excavator armor" its friggin paint! 
---
Right now I don't trust anyone.  I usually avoid lower levels, but if I spot someone ~40 and up, I'm killing them before they see me. 
---
Some kind of faction system would be interesting.   If done well it could lend itself toward larger scale battles which is what I'd hoped to see more than the 1v1 stuff.  
---
No I hear ya. Just kidding around.....
---
It sounded like it would be it‚Äôs own separate mode, and not take away from survival. If that‚Äôs the case I see no problem
---
What armor do u use I would try get a unyielding sentinel set to go bloodied build but that really expensive 
---
I know lol you're fine dude
---
That blows.  
---
The robot vendor in Watoga. Not the train station. There‚Äôs another one. He‚Äôs Brotherhood of Steel. There‚Äôs also the repeatable Forbidden Knowledge quest after you finish the BoS questline that sometimes drops plans. I read that they‚Äôll be putting robots from each faction in the white springs with the next patch. So the BoS vendor there I assume would have them. Then there‚Äôs the nuka cola paint job, which is T-51 only. 
---
Yeah I ask them to stay on until I am done. 
---
Why can‚Äôt there be 3 modes, Adventure, Survival and Seasons.  
---
Exactly. If you did the math you would calculate per travel not a single travel. Idk how many times you fast travel in your daily game time but I travel probably 20-30times in a given session. 
---
So you're making the assumption that the way you're supposed to play is to, "to farm for the best gear, hoard items, and build your character into a 'spec.'" That's not the only way to pay, it's not how I play, and I can only assume that I'm not alone.
---
There will be incentives to do the "season" thing I'm sure, but they won't take away your current characters either. I am actually excited about this.  I have so much fun scavenging for any kind of gear in those low level times.  Maybe I plan to make my character a heavy weapons guy, but I find a sweet low level legendary pistol and end up doing that instead.  And to make those low levels all tense fighting other players when I still only have 3 stimpacks and neither of us are all optimized yet? That sounds amazing, I can't wait!
---
TLDR; just because it's not for you doesn't mean that no one will like it.
---
Success.....thanks to all.
---
It will most likely be done just like it is in Diablo 3
---
A new mode you don't have to play if you don't want to but most likely will have rewards only available for that season received from season play
---
I like/hate the season mode in D3 cuz I'm not a big fan of starting over however I don't complain if people have stuff I don't or if there is something I really want I play
---
Also it's unlikely you'll lose the season player you make just won't be able to use it in a new season
---
Hmm.   How much damage does it do?  Do you want to sell?
---
If your in ps4 I can just craft you one
---
It's there T51b in the trailer, iirc
---
Its because that level 12 is only a representation of that character not the overall persons game knowledge and armor. That was prob their alt account made for pvp. In regards to the top 3 no one I found tries to kill themselves because they are near impossible to kill lol
---
Gotcha! I‚Äôll be available starting this Monday.
---
So why wouldn't be able to have a camo paint job on your armor not be better? It's just giving you more paint options for your PA. and that's all I'm asking for. I think it would be awesome to put hot rod paint on my ultracite armor, camo paint on my excavator, and Nuka Quantum on my x01 (currently this is the only one allowable). But having paints tied to specific suits just kinda... sucks. 
---
The map is too big and there‚Äôs too few players to really have one spot. Some of the beginning area train stations would be good spots though.
---
Successfully accomplished mission. Thanks
---
You can get weight perks and armor that gives 10 carry weight per piece. I actually went with unyielding, with each piece giving 3 strength, I get around 15 strength. Each point of strength adds 5 carry weight and melee damage. 
---
I know. More of a pop culture suggestion for a fun game mechanic.
---
Just keeps everything from being easy choices.  Do you want to look cool, or carry lots of junk? That's an actual choice, which I'm okay with. 
---
But I wouldn't be upset with your thing either.  Just saying how I see it
---
That's a scary thought really. Don't want to sound pretentious by quoting Nietzsche, but I think it's relevant:
---
&gt; ‚ÄúHe who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster... when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss also gazes into you‚Äù     
---
And then just replace abyss with fissure.
---
You said " hundreds of caps just to grab 1 of this and 2 of that to brew for a daily", not an entire play session. But yeah, I FT a LOT and with my base and the Vault I keep it fairly reasonable.
---
My fan fires up loudly when I'm in Biv's room. It's the only time it seems to happen in my game, but it's been happening the last four nights. About an hour later, when I'm going to repair or modify a weapon, my screen will freeze for five seconds and then the Xbox powers off. I can turn it on again right away, but it's really strange. I have an Xbox One X and it's less than a year old. 
---
I'm really liking it, makes things more tense and interesting. Have to pay attention and not just traipse through the game like a field of flowers like I had been doing for a while.
---
It has the barn building, brick and warehouse building set and a plan for a walking cane not a metal one 
---
You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Responder ambush, same as us, and that thief over there. Damn you, Raiders. Appalachia was fine until you came along. Responders were nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that Power Armor and be halfway to the Mojave. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these Raiders the Responders wants. We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, thief. 
---
I've been saying that since before Bethesda bought the franchise haha
---
Likewise the vault completely shuts down when we leave as we are the last to leave.
---
Life support, water, electricity, it's all offline and the door shut.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to it reopening but it should be a really cool community quest, let let players donate materials and as we hit milestones let us go deeper have more rooms and stuff 
---
I wish we could get those bubble turrets you see on the radio towers. Honestly wondering why those aren't available. 
---
Same shit happens to me. I got a semi flotaing camp and I always fall threw it when spawning in. I couldnt figure out why lol
---
Other people hear the noise? I never hear anything when Im around other people using chameleon armor and not the mutation. As for being spotted and usefulness, Ill have to retest. When I tried just the mutation, it seemed like i was spotted/in danger more often than when I used my five piece chameleon set. Plus the chameleon dropping during shots was killing the mutation for me. 
---
*sky turns green in boston*

Not that.I mean placing items you have in your inventory or [C.A.M.P.by](https://C.A.M.P.by) that i mean placing items like Nuka Cola,Power armor frames,etc.

Agree....all that translates into..."I wana be able to destroy people who dont stand a chance, cause they dont have a tse and sentinal armor , like me"    
---
Yeah, I miss the glowing absinthe bottles!
---
What system? 
---
Kids/trolls tend to do that, I‚Äôve noticed. 
---
Sadly. I wish they'd just make it a no camp zone. Like the place in the middle of nowhere I camped since beta that was apparently no longer available after the alcoholic patch. üò°
---
I suspect the challenge rewards will get better once they get balance ironed out a bit more, but who knows 
---
From what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs actually adding to the base damage. But I also heard that it‚Äôs some sort of an exploit buff adding the extra damage. Take that all with a massive grain of salt, it‚Äôs prob just a few really good players (maybe even lower levels) using handmades and killing players with all the top gear who aren‚Äôt great idk.. I do know when people who are used to winning the majority of the time in Adventure find themselves losing in Survival thy don‚Äôt take it well. And.. it must be the game glitching, or server lag, or exploiters, or Bethesda‚Äôs fault. 
---
If you went around looking for a fight in PVE you could usually find som but, that doesn‚Äôt mean those people you were fighting really wanted to.  Most people will fight back if harassed enough even if most of them are not set up (by specs or by gear) to find success with PVP.  In Survival it‚Äôs the reverse - most are going into it ready to put up a good fight. 
---
I think we can live with the name  Stormlords and Stormladys üòÑ
---
It is silent but it has a graphical thing where a large cylinder like stealth effect hits you. and so instead of hearing you, it just telegraphs where you are via that way sometimes.
---
I wish they would allow Raiders to still be able to destroy buildings in Adventure mode. But thats my own opinion cause we need some evil in the adventure mode cause the scorch plague isn't scary anymore.
---
I like having things the way they are now. As things are, you‚Äôre forced to make decisions as to how you want to build or what you‚Äôre going to wear. Power armor already has a lot of benefits with the mods it does have. If you added legendary effects to that, literally everyone would be running PA. 
---
Perhaps not, but that doesn't mean that things shouldn't change. I'm fine with being open to PvP with a player contesting my workshop, but *only* if that PvP is within the bounds of the workshop itself. For example, if someone contests it and I fast travel back to it to stop them and they kill me? That's fine. By travelling back, I chose to engage with them and fight for the workshop. If I'm halfway across the world and they scour the map to look for me so that they can leave their teammate behind and then come one-shot me when I've opted not to contest it... that's bordering on griefing, because they're not doing it with the intention of capturing the workshop, they don't care about that. They just want the free kill on an unsuspecting player. Whilst it is an action allowed by game mechanics, it's absolutely a wilful exploit of the system, as I doubt it was intended to be used this way.
---
to be fair sometimes when wearing armor and or outfits I appear naked on my friends and families screens.
---
+++++features  (no such thing as bugs!)
---
ITS KILL OR BE KILLED AHAHAHAAHAHAHHA. Jk I understand killing the low level once but not 4+ Like jeez they learned their lesson let them go
---
Use the spawn up near lady Janet's soft serve. I had better luck up there.
---
 Run South on the road and it spawns right past the bus.
---
omg yes i will thank you!!
---
You mean Hellfire Power Armor or Tesla Armor?
---
It doesn‚Äôt stack. Just like armor doesn‚Äôt count when you‚Äôre in PA.
---
They have a team of pr people that we see reply to every major thread. It‚Äôs their job to relay the stuff they see on here to the higher ups for events like this.
---
Fallout 1 had the timer, both for Vault 13 running out of water and discovery of Vault 13 by the Super Mutants.  IIRC in Fallout 2 they make it seem like there is a timer but the shaman just keeps bugging you in your dreams every week or two and nothing changes.  I haven't done  a full playthrough of F2 since the early 2000's so they may have changed it to be a hard time limit in later releases.  
---
Clothes and armor are removed in power armor. Its not a bug.
---
Really appreciate the help! Been getting back into the game lately  because the community is really awesome.  
---
Hell, both :p
---
I loved alot of their armor, giant tesla rods stickin out
---
When new vegas came i was sad that there was nothing but remnant
---
And fo4? Rip
---
So? You die once, don't seek revenge and let them have the workshop. You lose less than you gain claiming them in the first place.
---
Same I wish we had Evil player factions in adventure honestly but all I get is silence back.
---
Don't rp as a raider if you're gonna wear your xo1 pa and use your gatling plasma. That's not a raider that's an asshole.
---
BE Handmade (perks set for vats crit), BE Gauss with Recon scope , Bloodied Tesla Rifle  (great for taking out mobs of enemies) , Instigating supersledge (1 hits most things) and AA Mole Miner Gauntlet . I'm a rifle build . 
---
You can but the weight perks AND strength points are effective in PA so they don't help the balance. Getting deep pockets on everything only gives you +50 carry weight (still not balanced) and the strength system is actually really fucked cuz check this out: 
---
Strength increases your carry weight by 5 lbs UNTIL you hit 6 points in strength, where it drops your initial carry weight BACK to 105lbs (the base carry weight with no strength points or armor AT ALL). Afterwards, each point increases your carry weight by 5 lbs UNTIL you hit 12 points, where it drops back down to 105 base carry weight AGAIN!  Afterwards, it goes back to normal and increases by 5 lbs per point in strength(this includes going beyond 15 as far as I've noticed) 
---
So what's really messed up is that unless you're pushing your strength beyond 15, the carry limit doesn't change much. In fact, the base carry weight is actually higher at 5pts in strength (125lbs base carry weight) or 11pts (130lbs base carry weight) than it is at the full 15pts (120lbs base carry weight).
---
I know that sounds dumb but that's what the guide book shows and what I've personally seen between my own and other peoples characters. 
---
No problem at all.
---
 I just wish it wasn't a random spawn.
---
 Sometimes you go 30 hops and not see him sometimes he'll appear twice in a row.
---
Too bad he isn't static.
---
Fallout is more amazing lore and immersive world's. While I understand some find it cool to PvP in said world, Bethesda should focus more information what fallout is known for. Plus there are far better games that allow you to PvP unrestricted
---
Power armor doesn't stack with under-armor, armor, or specialized clothing affects. This is not a bug, you just don't know how the game works. 
---
We‚Äôll look into it. 
---
Quit game and come back, unfortunate workaround. 
---
To be clear the watoga shopping plaza vendor Phoenix sells all of the pa mod plans not the body part plans
---
This is badass.
---
I am a lvl 150  battleaxe-wielding maniac and I suicided regularly when in the top 3 or close to it.
---
Just isn‚Äôt worth the caps and aid to risk imho. Sure, I could probably kill that explosive automatic user in 1 hit but he can kill me at 200 m with a few left clicks.
---
It‚Äôs very easy to learn to craft a lot of ammo. That may be your best bet. Check out Lucky Hole Mine for a ton of lead.
---
cheers my mate &lt;3
---
I just need steel
---
Melee is broken in a bad way now
---
Just need steel
---
So what I'm reading here is "If you're not dumping hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of caps into buying top tier gear, don't do PVP". 
---
Seriously, sounds like you're the problem. 
---
I‚Äôm blown away. Thank you!
---
Best place is at whitesprings. Only place I see with multiple people usually 
---
Nuka grape from robot vendor second floor in WS the room which will lead u outside..it has checkerboard floor..that is ur safest best without starched genes
---
I would also like to know
---
I didn't quite understand some of that, but I'm at ~41 in total on a team, and can carry 400 weight, no chems or alcohol. 
---
This is great, very nice. My brother wants to do something similar when the Player Vending comes out, but by setting up a market near Flatwoods and selling stuff for super cheap for low levels. 
---
Broken as in useless or broken as in stupidly OP?
---
Hey mate you can join me ill be on later on tonite after work
---
PSN Thumper4739
---
Most of the time I just drop it or give it away
---
I REALLY wish we could break it down to make different kinds of ammo even if it took 1000 to make 100 or something just to have a use for it 
---
Rare? Ur looking at spending 5k and up 
---
Hi Jim, I'd like to grab some serums from you some time.  Happy to donate some extra stable flux as well.
---
And that's why I was thinking about a new series of effects for PA. My problem is that if my resistances are higher without PA AND my legendary effects are active, then what's the point of wearing PA at all? Cuz what I'm seeing now is that the only benefit you get from PA is having a jet pack or calibrated shocks. It used to be (in the older games) that PA was OP resistances compared to ANY other armor, but now their not. 
---
Go to westek kill the mutants and scrap their guns (: it grab tin cans 
---
Ahh thanks, I didn't know. I guess it nice that each one has different downsides.
---
Lol the ranger hat is dope tho
---
I drop it at a suitcase in a heavily trafficked train-station, watoga, whitesprings, etc. 
---
Ok. Thanks
---
Thank you for admitting it. 
---
I'll join and help
---
Sure, add me, join me, fast travel to me. I‚Äôm around. 
---
It would be a huge security risk, I think that time would be waaaay better spent on fixing the game.
---
Yeah, I'm tired of people coming and shitting all over my camp in Adventure, even when I try to make sure it's out of the way. They don't even get anything out of it but Wanted status, so what's the point of destroying all my walls and lights?
---
Agree
---
The terminals(overseer maybe) says this exactly. 24 hours after the vault opens, everything is shut off; the vault is no more than a dangerous, lifeless cave.
---
I'm not sure what happens with other abandoned vaults that allow us to enter. Possibly they keep running since they're real experiments, while ours is to leave the vault.
---
Lvl158 Omw 
---
nice. good advice
---
I saw many posts on lfg looking for low levels to be bait so the poster could farm unexpecting players for caps and junk. That alone made my decision to never play survival mode. All survival mode does is cater to cunts who lack self worth and need to feel superior on a video game by killing people for the Lols. 
---
The worse part is we were starting to see a drop in asshole players and survival mode brought them all back. Hopefully one day we can play survival without any toxicity.
---
Right?! It's so weird when I see people expecting others to play a GAME, that gives you the option to do all these different things, exactly how THEY want you to play it...and even worse, they expect you to behave as you would in the real life. Like how absolutely boring.
---
All you have to do is pop berry mentats and keep a stelthboy on you when you near populated areas and go kill the hunters. What I find to be the problem is the bounty that gets put on your head when you piss too many people off üò≠
---
This annoys the shit out of me 
---
&gt;Take me home, country roads
---
Is John Denver canadian now?
---
So I found the clean space helmet on the top of a metal shelf in Morgantown where all the tents and ghouls are. Next to the tall wall. Never knew it spawned there.
---
Can‚Äôt recall exactly where in the ash heap but you can find a good amount of iron there. I think it‚Äôs north of one of the hornwright air purifiers.
---
But you if you want to trade for them I think you gotta offer something. Maybe others are far more kinder than I but I wouldn‚Äôt just give you a bunch. 
---
YES.
---
Yeah I would love to scrap a lot of this stuff
---
Gatling gun is very good. One of, if not the best choice. High damage, cheap ammo, slow fire rate. 
---
Yeah I wanted this for player vending being able to snap camps together to make whole entire settlements, it was pretty much my envision for launch that we would just snap our camps together and barter.   
---
GEEEET YOUR SWATTERS HERE!; RIGHT FROM THE DEAD CORPSES!
---
I could give 700 5.56 ammo
---
Lol
---
I could offer 700 5.56 ammo?
---
I disagree. They can drop prime receiver plans and aren‚Äôt hard to kill with a good rifle.
---
You are a bitter, bitter little person.
---
Find a stranger adventuring, wait until they're taken down. As they call for help, you kill all the enemies, walk to their side, [and eat them.](https://i.imgur.com/lQIrn6X.gifv)
---
How often does the vendor spawn in the two locations, is it just a random encounter?  I‚Äôve been trying to find it for the last two days with no luck what so ever 
---
Go to survival and raid away. "Roleplaying" a raider in adventure mode isn't valid. If you were really into it you would stay on the mode where it's all hostile, all the time. 
---
I'm playing a heavy build and it feels pretty solid in pvp. With one gun army (12% stagger and cripple chance) almost no enemie comes near you and scorchbeast either get forced to land after a few hits or get staggered in the air as long as you keep shooting. Most of the time i play a tse 50cal, but for range and ammo saving i suggest a gatling gun as secondary. 
---
Posts like this is exactly why real griefers do it.
---
What's a cobalt bomb?
---
That‚Äôs awesome. Yeah, I‚Äôll be setting up vending on all my toons as well. This game is great, it‚Äôs community is even better.

*crafting in the forest* ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I got a instigating power fist that does 244 damage on first hit for free, and there were 30+ other weapons with equal worth! It was hard to choose just one!
---
I‚Äôve been trying to figure out what the odd white noise is I keep hearing is. Turns out it‚Äôs the flames from my super sledge. 
---
I agree and thought the same thing , but a friend made a point...if I was an actual raider I may not want advertise it constantly. Might benefit some to wear other things to infiltrate from time to time.
---
Side note...is Raider PA not as good at the highest level? I rarely ever see anyone wearing it.
---
To each their own you might say it is invalid but if we are being honest this is a Wasteland. There are no rules. Also why go to Survival mode when I could stay in Adventure and tick you off. Just saying.
---
Right, and I understand that. But you're using perks and skill points, both of which work inside and outside of PA, which means there's still an imbalance between PA and nonPA users. However, you can put cal shocks on excavator armor (that's +200lbs) and only deep pocket +50lbs max) on your regular armor. We will see here soon if backpacks will be equippable in PA. If they aren't, then that balance is already being fixed. Otherwise a balance still needs made. 
---
I killed my first scorched beast and while doing ut i ruind the moment by falling in to a fissure site and i didnt die i just took rads
---
I‚Äôve got a sniper build so I try not to use power armor whenever possible. I do use it if I go on extended scavenging sprees or if I do a nuke zone. It‚Äôs got its place but, as you said, it would be OP. 
---
just after it landed.
---
Forgot about the ammo... So you basically burn through your ammo pretty fast and i wont recommend the 308 lmg, since the ammo is harder to craft. For 50cal and 5mm just run uranium fever, pick up every weapon and scrap them with scrapper equipped. Then head for lucky hole mine in your excavator and get all that lead. Ammosmith+super duper = enough ammo for days. 
---
Don't forget the 100 after applying calibrated shocks
---
At least you tried
---
If you have an alternate character u can also double or triple the caps u can make
---
It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs op.... it‚Äôs just that other builds need a buff to match melee. From a strategic standpoint, there is very little reason to run any other build. 
---
I also find it weird every single person has an explosive gun, EVERY SINGLE ONE
---
It would be actually usable in 76, since pip boy doesn't pause battle any more we could use the ability to use it without stopping in place
---
Sorry, I use .45 too. Just trying to help a fellow wastelander be self sustainable. Try posting on fo76bazaar, there‚Äôs a lot of traders there that may be able to help ya. 
---
Technical data hunting is a thing. I'm trying to get a full set of spare BOS t-60 paints. 
---
 Can only do it every few days as the desks and filing cabinets have some random respawn rate.
---
 At the rate I am getting the paint this will keep me busy for weeks.
---
 I also jump into sqb fights if they appear, doing AWOL and Horde events, little bit of trading now and then, dailies, weeklies, yeah I seem to still have plenty to do.
---
Also, just because I love knowing more about the game, is there any way you could give me some insight as to how you got to ~41 strength? Ie perk build and everything else you have that alters your strength? My favorite builds are ones where someone went absolutely OP in one area and how they accomplished it. 
---
Same as spamming the spawn locations?
---
Free xp for a few rounds and some seconds of your time with a solid build
---
Lol. Sure, total expenditures my friend. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Ok thanks 
---
Hotkeys my man
---
But the player could be smart enough to put atleast t51 jetpack (well, a modified version atleast) to the excavator.
---
You're up there in the New Appalachian history books with French Tomahawk and whoever completed the first SBQ event. Good job.
---
God bless you,
---
God bless America,
---
And God bless the Enclave. 
---
They didn't update it
---
Way to encourage diverse builds!
---
I'm glad they at least had the option to be drunk OR drugged.
---
Looking out for everyone I see.
---
I always feel bad especially when I see like a really sad little wood house that is all busted in.  I can usually spare the wood/steel and other components to at least fix up walls and doors and get the lights running again.  
---
Sorry, sold 2 hours ago for 4k
---
This feels like a trap. 
---
I can see where you're coming from, but I think that there is a lot of potential in having immersive worlds where players are able to interact in a variety of ways, for help or harm.
---
Warcraft was a RTS franchise for the first three games, but I do seem to remember them doing some kind of interesting experiment with an online RPG thing.  Imagine if they'd listened to fans who told them to stick to what they were good at.
---
Now, there will probably never be another game like WoW, much less FO76, but I'm glad that Bethesda is trying to innovate.  It's early days, and they're clearly not sure what kind of game they have.  But they're trying new things.  We know that factions will eventually be introduced, and I'm sure there's a lot more of a roadmap in that department than they're letting on.  There's so many places they might go with all this, and I'm willing to play along for a while to see what they me I make out of this.
---
What system are u on 
---
For lead, I went to Atlas observatory and there were tons upon tons of Liberators that drop lead. I got a ton there, but there might be different enemies that spawn.
---
"Who wants a Radioactive Sunset?"
---
Lucky hole mine for lead. Take your excavator set and look for all the lead at the bottom of the mine.
---
Assuming you don‚Äôt have cloth and acid to make gunpowder, go kill some super mutants. They like to carry it and they are always at places like hunsterville and west tek. 
---
Still doing it? I would love to join.
---
Charleston Fire Department Weight room, Vault Tex University, the nuclear silos, and the motel in Flatwoods all have weights that can be scrapped for lead. You can get 200+ from these places. 
---
As for gunpowder, you get it from Supermutants. I suggest going to the lumbar mill in the northwest corner of the map. With a decent melee weapon you can one hit all the Supermutants and get a ton of gunpowder while not wasting any ammo. 
---
Same, same, and same my man. Which is unfortunate because excavator only has 1 other paint job and itd be cool to have some of the other ones while I'm using it to get around. I've honestly thought about getting cal shocks for my x01 and dropping the excavator entirely.
---
The actual piece plans such as arms legs etc can drop from events like distant thunder, I once got a t51b arm plan from a distant thunder event
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 as well if you give me lead and steel and gunpowder I can make you a ton my psn is Krisiboy21 
---
lead: you can get truckloads from a lucky hole mine run with excavator arms and smelt the ore with super duper
---
gunpowder: i run collision course for prewar money, then craft it into powder (also with super duper)
---
you will need a bunch of acid to do my way though
---
I'll sell you 500 .45 rounds for 150 caps.
---
For 200 caps I'll give you the 500 rounds plus an assortment of supplies for the road.
---
Agentgibbs1398 is my PSN
---
My understanding is you get to pacify OR take, it‚Äôs random, and there are requirements to be able to tame.
---
I got the helmet somewhere already, some random spawn. But I need that suit üò≠
---
Ok - but can you tell if adrenal is still working, just not as well?  I am ok with that ... as long as it doesn‚Äôt reduce my base damage (less than 100% damage) like some people have said ... I guess it may be tough to tell that on a bloodied weapon ... thank you so much for the help!
---
Haha its not. Just jurious how much Assassins/sentinal/Cavalier is actually changing hands.
---
Well thats the thing I get X to Pacify or Y to Pacify and I am confused
---
Low on caps atm, but I could offer some legendary weapons or high level weapons 
---
What level are you? It's only available to buy after a certain level - I think it's 50, but not sure.
---
I am level 200. Level 19killed me super fast with handmade.
---
Balance there is.
---
ugh fun?!!! this is what you call fun?? people keep fckin killing me and griefing and stealing from me! its called SURVIVAL mode, that means youre not allowed to kill me and steal my thing. meanie pant people aleays griefing me omfg
---
Ok, I‚Äôm low on steel atm is that ok I got like 100 lead and 360 gunpowder 
---
You‚Äôd think so, but even if you get the jump on the target they hop in the air trying to avoid the melee swings. Last guy I snuck up on had a bounty on his head and even though I surprised him, he brought me to 20% hp AND dodged 3+ VATS melee.
---
A bounty on me would be great! Nobody‚Äôs gonna spend 600+ caps to place a 300+ bounty on someone. I‚Äôm losing 300+ a death normally.
---
I don't get why they changed that, they honestly should have left it the way it was 
---
You wouldn't tell me it's a trap if it were a trap.  Trap-22
---
It will take away 5 pounds of carry weight (-1 STR) with Class Freak 3.
---
rereereeee splitting the player baseeee rtrrreeeerrrreeeeeeeee
---
Ye it‚Äôs T-51b it spawns randomly in power armor locations if you want I can show you mine if are on PS4 
---
It's like every time I've done it lately that I've gotten next to no enemies to fight. One time there was another guy doing it with me and we spent more time emoting at each other than having things to kill
---
I love that too! Bethesda has put tons of stuff in like that. 
---
I found a letter from husband to wife that actually made me sad to read it 
---
or when you see a pram amd a dead body next to it. Heavy stuff Bethesda! 
---
Lol I had a 400 dollar bounty on my head yesterday üò≠
---
Mound Blair lol (jk) . Have a great trip and take lots of pictures!
---
How is that different from overpowered? Isn't the word overpowered inherently comparative to things that aren't?
---
I approve of this message.
---
That's what I was assuming but just wanted to be sure, thank you so much for your input
---
Every point of STR is 5 carry weight, so it will.  Marsupial does +20 so together it will be a net positive with class freak.  
---
Happy to help.
---
I'm sure this is a server space issue.  Camps can very really elaborate and that's a lot of server space.  
---
No worries.
---
They can drop plans(receivers/ultracite pa), and well, regular scorched beasts are easy. I don't mind wasting 20-30 bullets on one.
---
Yeah they're annoying and the chance to get a plan is low but i have to take that chance. 
---
"I laughed my ass off...and then I came to Reddit to complain about it...."
---
Very randomly rare is a good way to put it.
---
Someone destroyied my huge Church of our lord and savior Mothman when i was thinking about killing myself irl (doing survival weekly). From that time when i come across camps, TSE minigun join the party!
---
Just remember the game map is not in line with the actual WV. You might want to double check your trip's path with the actual locations so you arent going further out of your way than you think.
---
Don't buy the plan. I assure you by level 45 you will have one. They can't be used until 45 anyway.
---
You're expecting human being to consider others time and energy? Daring of you, I must say. 
---
I can't wait. I have been holding litteraly everything I come across in anticipation  for the legendary vendor. I hope it's not been a waste 
---
Touche
---
I thought the specific area ones were weekly / daily challenges.  The anywhere in a region being the one time character challenges?
---
I agree, but only because I love the Fucking sound of the gatling gun.  And my little lady looks like a bad ass carrying it. 
---
And it kills things.  What more can you ask for?
---
Wate untill the updates arrive or prepair for them 
---
There are two spots there where the vendor bot can spawn, so if someone has built their camp there, you can always check the second spot still.   When you first load in on the tracks with the train station in front of you, Turn around and follow the tracks away from the station, to the red bridge over a ravine.  I'm not sure how far across the bridge you have to go but I go at least one third of the way.   Turn and head back the way you came, after the bridge going down the hill he will either be on the tracks or in the field just to the left of the tracks.   Its at the point you can walk into the field from the tracks without having to jump down the rocks.
---
That is true, never thought of that. Thank you 
---
Make a cow in the recourses section a make a fertilizer thing it make like 5 every 20 min
---
TOGETHER we shall close the gates of Oblivion!
---
Bethesda, please don't let their work go to waste. Make something that will spawn once you do this, please!
---
I get it yesterday at Harper ferry 
---
Agree - especially in pairs. Just had a two belching on my camp and I didn't feel like wasting the rounds. I've got a TSE Lever action does 215 dmg  per and it takes hella shots to knock out one of them plus it's a guarantee rifle repair.
---
If up votes and a quick message would make this happen that would be awesome. That app was the bomb!
---
Make sure it is powered up. 
---
You mean like scraggly played out beards and PBR?  Ok got it 
---
Agreed. I was near bog workshop, someone else had it. I was just at the Red Rocket to dump at stash. Scorchbeast came in and event was to defend workshop. Figured I'd help out since guy was no where in sight, and worth the random rewards. Finish off the SB, scrap at the tinker bench, suddenly I'm "Wanted" for 10 caps. Then it bumps to 20 caps, and then some high level jerk came and killed me. I performed zero hostile actions, killed the SB with a lever action, so no explosive or incidental damage. All in adventure mode. 
---
Yea that's exactly what I did. Even went to the train stations poster and nothing. 
---
What does this mean?
---
Yes, but that shows up under Miscellaneous. Make sure to stash it every chance you get, too, since none of the weight perks work on it, and it's heavy.
---
Do still grab everything and scrap it, just make it a habit to sell some every day. 
---
Yes that too. I've reset power. Replaced generators.
---
You mean like a spot on the map with a half buried guy or just that armor type?
---
I found the asshole...
---
The power light on the artillery is lit.

Yea, power armor and normal armor need balanced for sure, but no nerfs. Just better reasons to use. I have 15 from my specials (heavy weapon perks) my unyielding gives 3 to all stats except endurance, which gets it to 30. Radicool is +5 from high rads, some of my armor adds +1, and strange in numbers plus herd mentality adds 2 or 4. Something might be off idk.
---
I'm not, but i've worked closely with developers for about 20+ years. I can guarantee that I know more about programming than you do. 
---
This is a UI change. It involves enlarging an image file. It doesn't do anything substantive to the game mechanics. 
---
And it also isn't difficult for a good developer. ... Which you would know if you knew anything about application development. 
---
Great tip! I've been living virtually inside of google maps the past week plotting. Ending up near Chattanooga to visit some civil war sites and eats lots of BBQ!
---
No, high damage melee is at a significant disadvantage now. Real king of the game is rifles

This NEEEDS to  be in the game

Because we need to be punished.

yes and i wish I could access a repair all button when  I come across them because sometimes it's hard to repair totally destroyed pieces I can't mouseover.

I‚Äôve been playing since closed beta, only quitting for about two weeks around patch 5 because stability was at an absolute low and I was out of quests and tired of legendary farming the same events over and over. I can honestly say it‚Äôs the best it‚Äôs ever been and getting better. I‚Äôve gotten back in to just looting around various places, claiming a work shop or two, and knocking out events and dailies but switching it up more so I don‚Äôt get as burned out. I don‚Äôt really have any interest in pvp or survival mode but I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre making adventure mode even more friendly for my solo/PvE play style. Welcome back to the wasteland!
---
Every event need legendary mob and every "dungeon" (factory/houses/...) Need legendary leader.
---
Kill 25legendaries is fucking nightmare right now.

Id call it mustard gas.

Why are you guys still supporting Bethesda's malicious behavior towards it's players by continuing to play and promote this game?
---
No.  This is scheduled for debate later this week. Thanks for checking in.  
---
Maybe it's just you...  
---
Quite the interesting looking syringer...
---
An exploit is not necessarily synonymous with a bug. Something within the game that is working correctly but gets used in unforeseen ways (often for the personal gain of one player, usually to the detriment of others) is an exploit. In other words, workshops putting you into open PvP with anyone contesting it is an intended feature. People leaving a teammate at the workshop then hunting unsuspecting players across the map is entirely within the bounds of gameplay mechanics, but was not the *intended* use of the workshop PvP capabilities. I'm not saying Bethesda cares enough to change it, but it is undeniable that workshop PvP was not established with this use in mind. Players worked out an aspect of the system that could be exploited for personal gain, and they exploited it.
---
We think it‚Äôs fun. 
---
They are removing damage done by players to camps
---
Not a glitch. Excavator has a hidden bonus, and thats the weight. U need calibrated shocks for little carry weight
---
It has to be a creature that spawns at one of the "random spawns"  ie. The places that the messenger can spawn
---
Not quite...there's not much after lvl50,but u still unlock more perk cards every 5 lvls.

When it says T-series it means that to works for T-45 T-51 and T-60

Lots of train stations are generally safe to travel to. The real hot zones are usually watoga, whitesprings, and vault 76. You should be generally safer at the other locations.

What. It works for X-01 too. What the actual fuck. I want to die. So it wasn‚Äôt related to the company?

I wonder if me mentioning that the damage on the drill scales up every time you repair it will make it get taken of the loot table any faster ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Watoga vendor or Phoenix has them
---
Well fuck me sideways and call me a duck, but why is that a thing and where do I get the calibrated shocks for the proto x01 is it the enclave bunker 
---
Stop saying "greifing" if you don't actually know what it is. 
---
Gotcha. I found a level 20. Just wasn‚Äôt sure if I should start modding it yet or if there is a higher level available. I got the long bar mod to use.
---
Well, the absolutely excellent news is that soon you won't be able to tick anyone off in Adventre mode. Survival will be your only option. Enjoy!
---
Heh no. It means specifically for the head lamp part and it works for all of the T-series armor
---
I avoid them like the plague (heh). I‚Äôm stealth melee, and I‚Äôm not carrying a spare weapon around just to take out the flying spam trolls. I leave them alone, they leave me alone. 
---
Ok post canceled 
---
T-series in fallout means the power armor 
---
I kinda salty about the weight issue because I can't fast travel
---
Pick up an AA minigun or AA 50 cal for Scorchbeasts and Mirelurk Queens. The rest you can kill with an AA gatling gun with great ammo per kills ratio. A TSE 50 cal will also destroy everything. A nice quad harpoon gun is also a great and very efficient weapon. 1-2 shots for most everything. Non-quad harpoon guns reload after each shot, so I don't find them fun to use...
---
For energy, a furious gatling plasma (even 1 star) is killer. With the durability buff it's gonna last many many cores plus they're cheap to make.
---
Heavy is fun. Just gatling lasers need some love...

Or survival of the fittest. Stop being an entitled child.

Does it really?  I scrap it every time I see it.

‚ÄòI‚Äôve worked with developers‚Äô my wife works with disabled kids but that doesn‚Äôt make her disabled does it?

Power Armor STR bonus is only if you are under 11 STR.  It will be raised to 11.  Over that, you gain nothing. 
---
Excavator has a hidden passive bonus of +100 carry weight for having the full set.  
---
Gunsmith rank 5 and your rifle breaking issues will vanish. 
---
Also i don't really get it how your TSE lever, which it seems it does more damage (if that's the number without perk effects active) than my rifles is so inefficient at killing scorched beasts.
---
I usually use an instigating 50cal rifle for the first shot, then i switch to anti-armor 50cal rifle. Both are just 1* weapons. It takes about 6 clips/30bullets to kill a basic scorched beast. Using vats for headshots. Every 2nd or 3rd shot is a crit.
---
I mean....it should have been obvious not to pick up a bunch of stuff that you suspected the be duped, so that kind of is your own fault on the banning. Whether you did it yourself or not.
---
Do a little bit of research on the topic before posting. The excavator armor Discussion has been had to ad nauseam.....
---
Don't think I've seen plans for that armor, if theres any at all, don't think there is.

Calibrated Shocks are a rare vendor item in the Armory of the Whitespring Bunker (Enclave).

Haha is this for real?

agreed
---
I run in pacifist..helps when yoyr all trying to 'tag' kills instead of 1 shots. U can blast away with no worries about someone taking it the wrong way and killing u .Plus I just dont take any damage for some reason..little bit but not enough to wo6
---
I found one last night, but its not going to change hands. Don't want to arm the enemy.
---
32 people with 5 camps each 160 player camps in a map. Yes somehow I dont think that is ever going to be in this game

There‚Äôs 7 vendor factions with a pot of 200 caps each, pick up everything and sell it, some outfits are worth more than others but pick up golf outfits, straight jackets space suits and ranger outfits if you see them, bulk junk to sell and off load excess chems to them, the perk pharma pharma will mean you can search medical containers for more to sell. Kill graffton monsters they drop 15-20 caps, I kill the one by Poseidon while I‚Äôm in the area doing the energy plants cap stash run, then head into Charleston where there‚Äôs 2 cap stashes on the fire breathers exam run, keep following the river past the Charleston building and another graffton will pop up, you can then clear enemies from Wade airport for 20 caps reward and they are super mutants so they drop caps on their bodies too, then you can go over the bridge to do the riverside cap stash run and kill the supermutants at Summerville for their caps, from there head to whitesprings there‚Äôs cap stashes and the ghouls drop caps plus that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find the bunker vendor if you‚Äôve done the Enclave quest and there‚Äôs the whitesprings vendors, from there you can go to black water mine as there‚Äôs 2 cap stashes there. You can look up all the cap stash runs online and make your own route taking in all the vendors along the way and also any workshops, you don‚Äôt need to claim the workshops just clear the enemies from them for the 20 cap reward if your passing them on your route. You‚Äôll be able to find maps online of all the vendor factions too so you‚Äôll be able to make an efficient minimum fast travel route, also charisma bobble heads, sweet roll, and grape mentats will get you better vendor prices
---
Lol, of course it does. What doesn't work is the community. A bunch of entitled socialist idiots who don't understand the world of competition. That's what Pvp is. 
---
Same here, I also can't go to that temple of peace or what ever because of lag.
---
My specs:
---
i7-6700 and a gtx 1060 6gb, I've also got 18gb of ram so I have no idea why these 2 places cause lag for me.
---
As far as I have test it yes, *mfw best weapon is legendary drills* :O
---
Bleached dogwood would need to be in ingredients imo.
---
Yeah that's what I am thinking. 
---
It‚Äôs really weird but I refuse to play on PS4 because I refuse to pay for an online service (Yes Wifi is an online service but atleast i can get other stuff out of it)  
---
I believe you just find pieces of it. No plan. Sans for the quest reward. 
---
Don't carry so much shit with you.  That will allow you to fast travel.  
---
It would take 6 months to spawn
---
I‚Äôve got some but not much
---
Point place mothman statue
---
Thank you very much
---
I did... I had to put t60 legs on the xo1 though because the mods are impostor find otherwise
---
I routinely repair camps unless they are turret camps or missile farms behind WS.  I‚Äôll blows them up and get a big bounty and it‚Äôs all worth it 
---
I mean if each player can still only have one active at a time than it would be the same number of camps as before.
---
That's awesome! What system?
---
Mines up on the cliff right above yours, just because I want that sweet dog friend up there.
---
Or, you can let us adventure in Adventure mode and you can go influence people's ability to survive in Survival mode! Imagine that.
---
I know what it is, you guys can't handle the competition in Survival mode, the fact that you can't pick and choose who is able to attack you. You like to prey on people that want absolutely nothing to do with PvP, because you don't want to lose.
---
If we are being honest, you're just being a beta predator, no better than a chicken hawk. You fear those stronger than you, and would rather exploit the mode left for people trying to enjoy the game than take advantage of the mode created specifically for your behavior.
---
Ok duck. I think its a thing because the excavator PA is for mining
---
Hmm, how‚Äôd you get that? :D
---
I guess I haven‚Äôt killed enough players to get such a bounty.
---
How much of each
---
So nice to hear from an intellectual. . .
---
Don't you need a subscription to play online on consoles?
---
But then he will have less people who aren't fully geared to teabag.
---
Something is def up with the handmades 
---
same issue here. I can see someone who's wanted. I saw a #2 once.. but that's it. 
---
Yes?... thats what i said in my previous comment 
---
I think I found it once, but you gotta track it down.
---
Oh ok i get what you're saying I think. I could see maybe 2 per player but the second one would be small like a pit stop just for fast travelling
---
So what you really want is blueprints...which are already in the game.
---
364 gunpowder, 96 lead and 1 steelüò¢
---
Yup just me, nobody else.  
---
That makes sense 
---
I tried.  It's okay I guess.  But I'd prefer PVP with a purpose. Like faction based PVP.      Spawn into the map and some people are your allies, and some are enemies depending on your faction choice.   Everybody shooting everybody for caps, because they can,  just feels kinda of dumb to me. 
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve raided the jet stash posting this
---
Ah.  der Teebeutel
---
Tbh, you should start the game with these plans.   How to make wood armor:  take rope,  wrap or around a piece of wood you hold on your body.  Done.

Mariposa Military Base
---
What would a human npc repeating the same dialogue over and over, have over a robot npc doing the same? It‚Äôs a different model doing exactly the same thing. This seems a pretty desperate way to stick human npc‚Äòs into a game where you have real live people to talk to every session. Not a criticism, I just don‚Äôt understand.
---
It‚Äôs a solid suggestion, and perhaps they‚Äôll implement it in time, but in the meantime people should be aware of how the game works and avoid flagging themselves lest they get murdered while far away from the workshop. Calling it griefing when it‚Äôs a legitimate way to get caps is just silly. There are clearly defined ways to avoid being killed by other players. Flip pacifist on and don‚Äôt touch workshops.
---
Make building things like floors at an angle I want mutiple buildings in my camp and I want to be able to to use the rooftops as well
---
It does lore side but gameplay side its dumb
---
Blueprints - the hassle of trying to place them. Some builds are near impossible to replace with a blueprint.
---
Roleplaying a Raider but scared to go to survival.  Sorry about your microphallic condition.
---
There‚Äôs huge differences between online games. You don‚Äôt hear people getting griefed in CS or COD Hardcore, why? Because the rules are fair. 
---
Imagine some folks are too unfit and broke to do sports. Bethesda comes over and says ‚Äòsee those little kids practicing over there? Now put on this helmet and shoulder pads and do whatever you want to them, I‚Äôll make sure the rules are always on your side‚Äô.  There‚Äôs your griefers. 
---
Doesn't this make you the griefer, according to the definition this sub has created?
---
There are a lot of meanie pants, I'll give you that.  
---
Yeah it is
---
Entitled Socialist idiots? Lmaooo. You‚Äôre a joke. 
---
For me, the biggest thing was running the game directly from the EXE, completely bypassing the Bethesda launcher, you have to manually log in but I found the game to be MUCH more stable, gives more FPS, crashes a lot less
---
Also make sure the game is running on full screen.
---
Definitely agree. But I think a lot of newer players don't know players on each of the three platforms are isolated from each other (and it's unfortunate it has to be that way). I didn't until I discovered this forum. I'd argue the mods should add a rule to have people specify platform when asking for help, trades, etc.
---
They will get it figured out eventually
---
How many color-blind people have complained about Fallout 76?
---
Good because I'm pretty sure this is a trap
---
Hit up Charleston hospital. When you finish looting the place put on chemist and superduper. Craft stimpacks.
---
Do events. Even if you have done them already and they are easy. In fact, it‚Äôs better if you have done them and they are easy. You won‚Äôt use any while doing it, and the usually give you at least 5.
---
Thanks everone! That was quick and a good turn out!
---
For the time being it's relatively solid that this is not the case.
---
The actual solution for those of us that like building near cities and other structures is to not move your CAMP unit after placing it. If you do and you (inevitably) move it somewhere it isn't allowed, they'll pack your camp up.
---
yes your right it is my fault. when i picked them up i did not know anything about the duping, found it out i think a couple weeks after i had the items then it made sense to me where they came from. i should have got rid of the junk then but looking at it in my inventory i just couldn't drop them lol... i wish i did
---
oooff
---
You should use two thirds of your budget on the small lettering set telling folks how to use a door.
---
I was thinking full sized camps, but only one active at a time. So while you may have 5 fullsieze cams built, only one can found in game.
---
Screenshot your "non-ridiculous" prices here first. 
---
I've seen it go for 10-15k tbh. There's another outfit, a modified Firebreather outfit, that can be obtained as a reward for doing events in the forest area, that goes for the same price.
---
Quest giving, like Elder Maxson in Fallout 4. It‚Äôs just an idea to tie the world of Fallout together more. Makes you realize that there are other people outside of Appalachia. 
---
I put two cardboard vault boys on each side of the switch pointing at it lmao
---
You said Wifi so I thought you meant you don't like to pay for internet.
---
I was thinking PS+ membership.
---
my bad.
---
Listen go to summersville and kill all the super mutants there
---
If you can get me like 200 steel I can craft you around 500 45 I think 
---
I killed this guy after he completely set up a workshop and his friend and they each put a 200 dollar bounty on my head üò≠
---
Isn't the atom shop music playing in the Whitesprings vendor area too?
---
We‚Äôre talking about the lore reason, not the gameplay reason. Vault-Tec wanted to force people out into the wasteland to rebuild, so Vault 76‚Äôs systems were shut down upon Reclamation Day.
---
I've actually picked up a couple pieces off a loot drop over the past few days. Not exactly what I want and 1* but now I know what I'm looking for. I know I've probably dumped multiple sent/Cav armors over the course of my play because I just didn't know. 
---
I was asking myself this today as well! 
---
I found a place outside camp venture, down the hill a little that looked like it, and had military things sunk 1/2 way in the mud I jumped around for a while but didn‚Äôt find anything.  
---
I think he means is there a spot where you can see power armor buried in the dirt. Not necessarily that you can take it, he was just wondering if the scene in the video correlates to an actual in game spot.
---
Nice write up. I just learned something new after 300 hours.
---
I have heard of a couple but just because its a couple people doesn't mean it is not a problem, All games usually have a color blind option.
---
Ahh kk
---
I'd recommend passing right through West Virginia...
---
You still want the shocks
---
I know Xbox has a built in magnify feature
---
Nuke Monongah instead. 
---
I did a pretty big write up on these bos plans and someone from Bethesda responded and said they are aware that the drop rarity is broken.
---
BUT I can confirm I got the chest from scrapping. But I must have crafter and scrapped thousands of pieces... and I‚Äôm not exaggerating at all... I spent countless hours and hours farming material the. Spent thousands of caps on buying material and weeks crafting and I got the chest from scrapping and maybe the legs as well. But I did manage to buy a set of arms plans 
---
I‚Äôve also got 10 caps so can‚Äôt really go anywhere, I‚Äôm in top of the world so I‚Äôll kills super mutants there
---
also, the Farma Pharma (or other way round) perk helps for an extra, deep in the corners, search of aid containers. at least I think that's the perk.
---
I respectfully disagree. I like cooking up some Scorchbeast brains! The food buffs they provide are amazing! Also I enjoy the different tactics one must employ to take a Scorchbeast down. It can be quite the rush. Especially 2 or more!
---
We want the plastic cups too 
---
Great tip. I waited on the first quest to get a notification the fermenter was done, don‚Äôt ask me how long I waited before even figuring that one out
---
In this game, subtitles are your friend.
---
Events and hospitals. Just got 18 (glitch?) doing messenger. I thought it was weird it said 6 stimpak 3 times but they were there in my inventory 
---
Thanks, happy to help if I can üëç
---
Can they kill you anywhere? Anytime? Or just at the workshop
---
I used to until I kept getting a 5 cap bounty because one shotgun pellet would miss the target and hit their wall or something. Now I just let it be. I might fix something, but i won't kill anything lol.
---
Killing ticks with butchers bounty on at moonshiner‚Äôs shack then serverhopping.
---
2 tickblod = 1 bloodbag (2 with chemist) 
---
1 Bloodbag = 1 stimpack (2 with chemist)
---
Super duper can proc too.
---
Another way is simply farming whitesprings. If you kill the ghouls without taking much damage you'll notice that your stimpack/rad-x/radaway stash is increasing. This may not work for melee builds.
---
Over the dozens I've killed I never get anything good. Usually it's a lung, wing fragment, and some other shit but never any plans, weapons, or armor. 
---
Well... I guess I'll just hold the excavator until I CAN get the shocks ( hopefully player vending and the new mechanics coming out will help with that) cuz I'm just not seeing the point of PA anymore 
---
In the Glass Cavern, near one of the bodies (I forget the name but it was a quest checkpoint) there were toy blocks that spelled "Seal H".  Do you think you'd need to seal Prime plus this mysterious H?  It looks like the Greek equivalent is Eta but there's no Fissure site Eta.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, it's good that they are trying something new, and despite the shit 76 gets, I adore it and think that once it gets up properly it will be one of the best games out there. My concern is that if they really wanted to do a PvP mode they should have hired Devs who know how to make these sort of games. It feels like Bethesda just half arsed it and gave us something that only caters to griefers and PvP meta abusers. 
---
I was reading how literally everyone in your comments ignored the majority of your question and focussed on you wanting to find power armor, then went to do a bit of a search, and found half a dozen other posts where exactly the same thing was happening. Bizarre.
---
I think the general consensus seems to be no, it‚Äôs just a trailer thing, but I‚Äôd love to be wrong. I really like the all roads references in new Vegas, is a very cool little Easter egg.
---
Yes, repair all is nothing but helpful, there is no reason to leave it out or way to exploit it.
---
Do we have special couches for dead people? Do they make special boxing gloves for people without hands? Accept that you were born faulty and move on. 
---
They‚Äôre one-time social challenges, yeah, but I remember when I first started playing the game they would have you take pictures in different locales in that region. For example, in the forest, it would tell you to take pictures at Morgantown, Helvetia, Charleston, The Kanawha Nuka-Cola plant, The New River Gorge Bridge, Etc., etc. You would have to take pictures in each of those areas, and I thought it was really neat because it would require you to actually go to a bunch of different locations on the map. But then they changed it, and you can take pictures wherever now.
---
Well u will be able to use tokens and make ur own god tier soon.
---
Did you unequip some perks? I haven't noticed any change if armor or weapon break speed. Course I repair to 200 both. 
---
The Pharma Farma perk is pretty useful for finding stimpacks. Just make sure you hit spacebar to search all the chem boxes, first-aid kits, chem coolers and bathroom mirrors. I currently have over 120 in my stash and 35 on my character and I'm out there face tanking everything.
---
My gatling plasma shreds now, totally worth trying out.
---
No, the #1 problem in PvP is people bitching about PvP. Stop. 
---
Amazing thank you
---
Holy crap, why so much?
---
Thank you everyone for the tips I have pharma farmer and the one that makes stims heal for more. I dont have the super duper perk so I will keep my eyes peeled for it!!
---
Also, I only have one rank in the card.
---
And even then, you shouldn't need a "large majority" to make a game accessible. Colour blindness isn't exactly rare, and even if it was, it's not that hard to make some small adjustments to allow people with it to play properly.
---
You, it'd be faster to just google is and see the other 523 threads on this already this week, than waiting for a response. 
---
Will you be on at 1AM EST? Im gonna need two serums. Maybe more
---
Events will also spawn on that hill in front of the crashed train, and after you have crossed that big red bridge N of Charleston station. If you can get lucky, it could be 2-3 bites at the apple each server hop. Once by going S of the station by the fallen electric pole, back to the shed. One crossing the bridge, hill. And the other crossing the bridge, on the bridge/under. Maybe those latter two are the same, maybe they‚Äôre not.
---
And same with Jane‚Äôs Soft server. Crashed bus, down the hairpin turn, and turn around from the crashed bus back towards the soft serve store will trigger a potential 3rd.
---
Maybe 5-6 for me
---
Or stop defending people who aren't really roleplaying. It's not real roleplay if you don't fit the character. X-01 would be a rogue government agent on a postal killing rampage. There's a valid excuse to wreck stuff in X01 with a gatling plasma. 
---
I‚Äôm gonna be able to make you the stuff tmr kill all of them and scrap their guns and your ammo will be delivered 
---
I agree. Even if the Damm camp is ON THE TRAKS. It still spawns. Just because you see a camp when server hopping does NOT mean that's the cause. I have seen the Damm bit 10 times this week with camps therr
---
Let me ask you, does your character eat too much?
---
I bought mine a couple of months ago from the Watoga train station vendor
---
Yeah WS is a goldmine
---
Gotta make that ultracite ammo lol. My whole team need it 
---
Without "bitching" there is no change. I understand where your coming from, but it's clear PvP only caters to a small playerbase, and that needs to chnage so that everyone has an equal footing so that they can enjoy the mode without needed to no life for caps and gear. 
---
Good, I'm glad ya'll enjoy it. I wish the rest of the people that claim "Raider" membership would stop making excuses to stay in adventure mode.
---
I go to whitesprings most of the time I can get 3, I usually go to Charleston with Pharma on and can get a few there. If all else fails go to survival 
---
Can't help, wrong platform and all, but good luck haha
---
Haha I see what you did there. üëÄ
---
all prices are negotiable. If there is something on the list your interested in feel free to make me an offer :) 
---
I have dozens of other legendary weapons too 
---
Hah, that should do it..... watch it not though right.
---
We‚Äôll look into it. Thanks for the info!
---
Awesome I was wondering this myself, maybe they will add on
---
I picked up a super elusive Chameleon Powered Sentinal BOS right arm. Guy didn't really know what it was, but I still paid a ransom.
---
He‚Äôs throwing a tantrum because he got banned. If he didn‚Äôt get banned then I bet he‚Äôd still be defending the game along with everyone else who is having a lot of fun despite its flaws. I understand his frustration. He maintains his innocence and if that‚Äôs really the truth then I‚Äôd probably be just as salty. Not sure I‚Äôd spend my time on the subreddit shitting on the game, but who knows. 
---
I'd also like a way to leave a gift as a way of saying sorry someone wrecked their camp after I repair it all. like a housewarming present. I appreciate coming across camps a lot.
---
Slow day eh?
---
The issue with that is these duped legendaries will still be here. We can't just let them stay, what happens if the next big update comes out and adds really cool items and dupers get a hold of them and flood the market. It ruins small player trading and the idea of rarity

Your regular stuff isn't technically equipped when you're in power armor. Yhe game effectively considers you to be naked under the power armor frame, under the justification that you wouldn't be able to fit any other kind of armor (or a hazmat suit, for that matter) inside of a power armor frame. Instead of making you unequip those items before getting in the power armor, the game just negates their effects to simulate having them unequipped.
---
So what this means is stuff like Hazmat suits or legendary armor effects won't work while wearing PA. Your only armor benefits come from the Power Armor frame and the Power Armor itself.
---
Generally that's pretty reasonable in my opinion, but there's one flaw in this line of thinking - undersuits with buffed linings like the Brotherhood Knight / Soldier / Officer suit or the Enclave Operative Underarmor won't work either, despite being designed to be worn under anything, and *specifically* being designed for use with Power Armor in the case of the Brotherhood suits. They would be the only thing you actually could wear while inside a power armor frame so there's no reason for undersuit effects to be taken away, too.

---
Also I haven't got a firm price for anything and I am always happy to accept exchanges.
---
For example the instigating Quad barrel missile launchers is 1500 caps :)
---
Well, usually, there are more options in the list than places you need to go.  I don't know about this week's cemetary one specifically, but when it's mines, caves, lakes, that kind of thing, there's usually some flexibility.
---
Why the downvote? That's crazy, 
---
We have a repair all. Harvest all is definitely a valid excuse.
---
Def would like to see that link, just made a new character planning on doing that type of build
---
I was way in the Northwest corner of the map looting some farms when I saw a dot appear on my compass. It was then that I went complete stealth mode and sneaked my level 6 ass back to camp.
---
This dude apparently saw me and stalked me aaaall the way back to camp. I think I heard him a few times but I thought nothing of it. I didn't know he was really there until he put a super sledge through the back of my skull when I was planting melons in my garden. Scared the living daylights out of me. Big ol' boy in X-01 and a sledge sneakin' through the forests for little old me.
---
Who says they're roleplaying? Maybe they're just playing the fucking game and have been playing longer and/or better than most? Stop trying to control everyone.
---
Thank you so much
---
Yes, this too!
---
Does tick blood spoil ?
---
How much did you end up paying?

Not true, I hear him the instant I enter the tattoo parlor. ü§î

Do you have any for level 15?

This is where [my suggestion for the re-introduction of the Karma System](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b730e5/raider_mode_instead_of_survival_mode_better_name/) comes in... :D Granted, there'd be no true punishment still, but you'd be visually identifiable as a WVA: Waste Virginian Asshole. lol At least you'd be able to redeem yourself by doing selfless acts of kindness to earn Positive Karma! In turn, (hopefully) making yourself feel less horrible as a result.
---
This would be amazing!
---
?\_? I upvoted the original post...

Well the devs need to fix duping of course but there was talks of seasons being made where folks make new characters. So dont lose hope just yet.
---
No you thinking of pharmacist .. Pharma Farma allows you to search the boxes for more, make sure you hit Y and search the med boxes as well as looting them, it is not obvious.
---
There's survival mode now. But the rule is, you're not allowed to complain about the PvP setting if you're playing in a PvP setting. Because thats just stupid. 
---
Summersville..low-level mutants all carry gunpowder..clear out area..server hop..repeat
---
Love it when I don‚Äôt expect it and have no time to react. I‚Äôm like üòÇ touch√© 
---
Stealth bug, has been happening for the last few weeks in adventure mode before survival came out.
---
Well, maybe you just have to move your camp, unfortunately.
---
The player start is always some distance north of wherever the CAMP object is placed.  Likewise, if a teammate travels to your CAMP (or if it decides you can't spawn at the aforementioned point for some reason), they will go to where the CAMP object was *originally* placed.  This is why teammates will sometimes spawn inside floors, because let's be honest, no one thinks about this when they place the CAMP object.  They are just focused on the spherical extents, and many will just build in the middle of that sphere.
---
Knowing that, you should be able to find a better position.
---
Yeah, not much going on on my server so you know how it is.
---
It takes away -4 strength so..20 lbs
---
Oh I won't, I adore this game and I will always support them in there endeavour. As long as they don't make PvP ark 2.0
---
I would but I'd probably just find a bunch of young kids hiding in a shed not contributing. üòâ
---
To late..but why?
---
It is always worth it. Even just to see if you still do not like it...... cheers
---
Ouch, but I still laughed!
---
I don't think so.

Tick blood bags (or something like that) are used for crafting blood bags, tick blood for antiseptic.

Just remember to use that butcher perk

Don't play something competitive if you aren't ok with being beneath others. Your entire post, AND the point you've just made is about equality. Equality will never exist. Especially without punishing others.
---
Think, I beg you, before posting again.
---
It‚Äôs really personal, but personally I enjoy this game because I‚Äôve met great people. And exploring the world with them feels great. It doesn‚Äôt matter where we even go sometimes, we just follow instincts. Sometimes we go meet new players and help beginning ones by crafting them some stuff, giving away aids etc. I feel like many people need to realize that they don‚Äôt really need ‚Äúquests‚Äù to discover interesting things or experience great gaming moments.
---
I hope you‚Äôll get back into it with a fresh perspective, and that you‚Äôll have a ... blast !
---
depends on how much you wear power armor and if you have a set and the room to carry it. plenty of people only carry one or 2 sets. my X01 isn't fully modded yet, I've had shit luck getting the shocks and dont want to pay reddit price, it does have a stealthboy mod. my T51b is fully modded with jet pack so it's really handy to get places.  my excavator is modded for max carry. 
---
Lmaaoooo. Why? Explain please.
---
I found the deep pocketed for chest at Grafton station before the static plan locations started. Wish I didn‚Äôt stop until after I found arms and legs. I grind events and check vendors daily and have never seen or rewarded deep pocketed arms or legs. I craft and scrap when I have extra mats but just can‚Äôt get them to unlock ;(
---
What's the level and 3* roll on the the .50 Cal. Also asking price
---
No I checked several times and they do not have Them 
---
they are not really hard to kill with endgame gear, I usually down them before they land, sometimes before they screech
---
I Saw someone Else say it had No level requirement
---
What level are you they are level locked
---
As stated, this occurs on all characters at multiple different CAMP locations. That was the first TS step before I pestered the Reddit-verse about it.
---
Take the tour at Greenbrier, the bunker is pretty cool and they were very accurate for the resort.
---
Hopefully a techinical limitation in the creation engine prevents them from doing so.
---
Its exxxxpensive  - like as in you may have to sell your body for a set 
---
Oof. I know the pain. Also You Win!
---
I never get anything good from the queen. Fun to do but it's just boring. Monongah is loaded with glowing ones. Multiple legendaries but you need to scope it out first. If there are ghouls then it's good for nuking it. Leave the scenic overlook out of the nuke zone and it's a good place to fast travel too and start your run. 
---
All the building set plans have a level requirement.
---
It‚Äôs annoying for sure. I moved the actual camp thing and it started spawning me somewhere else but it seems to have gone back to the same place now so I‚Äôll just keep moving it around lol 
---
I saw someone on another thread spout some bullshit about how ‚Äúa real man wouldn‚Äôt [kill lower level players]‚Äù LOL. Pretty friggin‚Äô sure that plenty of actual, real men have done terrible things to those weaker than them. Also, not all who play are equipped with a Y chromosome anyway so... ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Same, weirdly I tend to notice it at lower levels. My higher level characters don't lag as much around Charleston and I can't explain why
---
Last I checked, the going rate was 6 caps. Up 72% from last week though, worth investing I'd say.
---
You will be lucky to find cap sellers for top tier weapons as the value of caps plummeted with survival mode giving double caps.  Most traders will only sell top tier items for other top tier items and only sell 1-2 start weapons for caps 
---
If you see a multi-level red barn coming in to Flatwoods (starting area), feel free to stop by and use any of my stuff, including the resource collector, water, garden, and balcony guitars. 
---
I'm normally on somewhere around 9pm until 11pm or 1am central, also PC. Same username as here, although I don't do friend requests much. If you see me in the wild though and I have stuff to spare I'll drop it off. If you've got a mic, I can hear it but don't normally talk much myself. 
---
Just don't go in my banjo room... 
---
I would suggest playing adventure mode to lvl up.
---
 I've played 99.9% of this game solo and absolutely love it.  I get a lot of group requests so it shouldn't be too hard to find a group if that's what you prefer.
---
 When my stepdaughter gets on to play I team up with her that's about the extent of my group play.
---
 I'm about to start a new character here tonight with a different build than my main. Still having a blast!
---
It's a game, not real life. I have no issue starting at the bottom but most PvP games give players a way to climb up the ranks. If I wanted to actually fight back I'd need 10s of thousands of caps to buy the gear. 
---
Regardless, as I've said in the past, fallout is a pve experience, tacking on a half arsed multiplayer as an attempt to removed pvp from adventure mode is stupid
---
Yeah, no. It's not there. The link u/Jezz_X gave from Removeddit says it was 'removed' (red), meaning a mod removed your comment.
---
Even if you can see it, we can't.
---
Unlikely. I‚Äôm usually on in the mornings on the weekend and early evenings CST during the week. We can maybe work out a compromise but the rest of my weekend is probably no good. 
---
I think they go for 5k 
---
You can compare it to the standard equivalent mod on a weapons workbench.
---
*faster movement speed while aiming 
---
*bullets explode 
---
*additional projectile 
---
....lvl45 with standard receiver and heavy barrel..... 
---
3000 caps
---
ok cool thanks
---
Wait searching is different from looting??? And I have both is what I was saying to maximize how effective they are and letting me use less. I did not know at all about the search thank you very much for that tip
---
but there's always a meta, before the update there was a meta, now there is a new meta, what does it matter what the meta is? 
---
its supposed to be "contesting the workshop" not abusing the workshop to force pvp on someone who clearly has no interest in contesting for the damn thing.
---
Just accept the fact that you and anyone else using this exploit is a shitty little griefer.
---
The food processing plant workshop has two fertilizer resource. 
---
Ok so I went and looket at a few vids and streams of the game but all I see is just a few glitches and and some akward looking gouls but other than that it looks like a regular FO with no NPC of course. No improvement at all same ol game again. What do you think?
---
I have excavator and XO1 the XO only nodded with headlamp and excavator with calibrated shocks. Where do you get T-51 mods from
---
have you tried traps
---
I'm not short on caps right now. I just cant find it
---
I‚Äôm sorry guys, but I target fusion generators.
---
No, it's exactly what you people asked for and you STILL can't handle it. Once again, if you don't want to play something that's designed to be competitive, don't play it. Stay in Adventure mode, where it's separate from Pvp...which is what you wanted...
---
Do some market research, look for players selling similar and ask them. Adjust your price accordingly
---
K
---
You're definitely right about everything, and _I have_ made a new character for solely survival mode. And I've got to say... it wouldn't be so bad if some level 263 with X-01 and a super sledge didn't follow me to the gates of hell for all my caps and loot. Its extremely difficult to make gains in an environment where I have no building mats or aid items, and I knew that going in-- just wasn't expecting the intensity of that difficulty. 
---
Yeah searching and looting is two different things, you want to do both. Pharma Farma allows you to search, without it, you can only loot Most of my stims comes from searching.
---
You still need that 45 ammo?
---
Never happened to me at least !
---
[https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Legendary+Weapons](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Legendary+Weapons)
---
I mean, that‚Äôs pretty understandable, I‚Äôd probably be the same way if that happened to me but idk. I‚Äôve had my camp destroyed a few times (one just recently because I was unwillingly being used as ‚Äúbait‚Äù to bring out a friend of mine who had history with these couple of people.) they destroyed my crops and a few other things which isn‚Äôt too bad and they offered to fix it after but it‚Äôs whatever. 
---
I guess it just depends on the type of gamer you are. 
---
You really think the game would have you go through so many loops and servers for a secret ending?.... thats silly
---
Stop being a dick
---
This is great advice. Spending 15-20 minutes at Whitespring doing this builds up lots of helpful non-perishables. Also very handy for getting coffee for crafting white russians!
---
Not going to happen.
---
I‚Äôve stuck it out since beta- there were low points when bug fixes created new bugs and the servers dropped off in population. With the two most recent updates I‚Äôve witnessed life coming back into to the game- I enjoyed fasctnact though about dozen plays of that event I never got any rare drops. Playing with 10-15 others with the same goal was great fun. I‚Äôve yet to log in for the newest update but looking forward to it when I finds the time. 
---

What a nice guy JIMS1973 is! He fixed my Evacuator armor today and now I can carry a ton, almost! Thanks again. That was very nice. Oldandslower
---
What‚Äôs the 3rd on the 10mm SMG?
---
It‚Äôs better than no endgame. 
---
My pleasure! Enjoy!!
---
Stop soapboxing.
---
Bethesda isn't disallowing us tonreenter the vault. Vault-Tec is.
---
All Rise is part of my inventory, but that is not the noise either
---
I had that mutation for a while, was awesome especially with lizard skin. But I didn't have starched genes yet so I lost them 
---
Melee FTW
---
Honestly I agree, especially in the case of the Brotherhood. If we had a direct connection to Lost Hills like Taggerdy did at one point it could allow for a rank up system and commendations along the lines of the Enclave‚Äôs. Granted the Enclave‚Äôs ranking system only really lets you progress from Member to General, but I think it‚Äôd be fun to be sent on missions by Maxson or some other staff member from Lost Hills and progress from Initiate all the way to Sentinel.
---
Lvl 24
---
Wtf is soapboxing?
---
Nice üëç 
---
I'm pretty sure the buried armor isn't, but the location might be.  My guess is that, if it does exist, it would be somewhere near Camp McClintock.  There are no distinguishing landmarks on the horizon except the power towers, which do run through the Forest.  He's standing next to a "U.S. Army Property - No Trespassing" sign beside a road.  Behind him, there's a telephone pole.
---
25% less AP cost in VATS...and it's a lvl50
---
I am a bloodied build, not specialized in melee but can kill in 1 hit. I'm specialized in heavy and semi auto rifles.
---
Oh alright so he probably reported it then? Lol either way he is accusing me of cowardly behavior for deleting it. Still invalid. :P
---
Before this update there was a discussed meta sure, but there was a lot more room for variables previously. At range, you had your one-shots which included powder weapons, snipers, and gauss rifles, up close you had melee, and all around you had your rifles (handmades essentially) 
---
Melees chances have been devastated by the nerf of the first shot, same with ranged snipers, their damage has been greatly reduced. 
---
Up close, right next to your enemy, you‚Äôd be better off with an automatic handmade at this point than you would have been with, what previously would have been superior in that situation, a good unarmed weapon. 
---
A games a game, so I can‚Äôt say it ‚Äúmatters‚Äù to anyone. But I loved this game for the dynamic gameplay I always encountered. Now the only formidable and deadly builds are those with vats handmade builds. 
---
I liked it before with a sort of rock-paper-scissors setup, not a definitive meta where we all look and act the same. 
---
Someone had posted a link to WV tourism page with info on FO76 locations which might help locate interests along your path.  New River Gorge is a very pretty sight.
---
I didn't need that second kidney, right? ü§î
---
Well stop looking you ain't going to find them anywhere unless you buy them off someone for another 26 levels
---
Go to the New Vrindaban ! (Palace of the winding path, in the game)
---
I‚Äôd like to have wallpapers or paint 
---
I just wish that pesky to unlock sight was actually usable, instead of just slightly increasing accuracy. 
---
Excellent points, survival is the great equaliser.
---
I wouldnt be surprised if they added a secret ending to something down the road because of you guys. Awesome work. This was really interesting. 
---
Body of responder next to vault 
---
Which vendor is this? (yes it's a dumb blonde question) 
---
In front of the vault.
---
How much for the furious shotgun? 
---
No, come back in summer.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work for me either guessing it‚Äôs bugged 
---
The dead responder just right of the vault as you come out or the Overseers chests are good.
---
Wow, impressive
---
It will? I might have missed something then.
---
It's a wandering responder bot, rare vendor that can spawn over there and somewhere else apparently!
---
I grab a gun I'm not really specced for, head West and have some fun.
---
The hunting rifles nice, but it's name is better it's called the "Hunters .50 Hasty Hunting Rifle" ignoring the ".50" of course.
---
Agreed, 100%. Purified water as part of this too.
---
What you want for the junkies
---
if your a PS4 player visit my shop  alteron_command I have tons of legendary weapons for sale for caps including bloody melee weapons. I'm online in 5 mins 
---
You can't hear other stuff though especially when my PC volume is already extremely low.
---
I just want my Deep Pockets to continue functioning while in PA :P Though, I have two armor pieces with -20% Weapon Weight, so that doesn't help either and would negate Deep Pockets carrying over anyways. I had been hauling back a ton of Assault Rifles, Combat Rifles and Combat Shotguns *(since you get get 30-45 caps each with lvl 3 vendor perk and only 4 CHA)* and then they nuked Prime so I want to participate... Imagine my surprise when hopping into my PA to be overencumbered, then to check and see by how much only to find out I weighed some &gt;650 lbs!! lmao Was a head scratcher for a moment.
---
Also like you replied with earlier, the removal of you **Underarmor** when getting into PA makes absolutely no sense. Without underarmor on you would chaf so bad in PA, getting slammed around all the time! 
---
As far as legendary effects persisting, that's a tough call. As much as I'd like it, I'm not sure how fair it'd be. It'd remove any challenge, that's for sure. At least currently, we're all kinda equal when it comes to SBQ battles, and standing still taking no damage wouldn't be that exciting. They could make the SBQ deal more damage, but now we're kinda back where we started except having some legendary powers which are kinda offset now by a more powerful SBQ.
---
Personally I'd like the "Mk" upgrades and all the paints from FO4, which the paints carried with them their own "legendary effect" in essence, which would at least give us more diversity and stuff to try and obtain. :)
---
Not really. I won't touch survival mode, but I appreciate who it was made for. They needed a bigger fanbase involved, so when the CoD fans started going hardcore PvP (which PvP was never an advertised integral part of the game) Bethesda  gave them a special mode. Unfortunately, some of them are shit at PvP so they still troll survival mode harassing players and finding ways to force PvP.m, so they can have easy opponents and feel better about how bad they suck.
---
Ugh, sigh. I was waiting to get this recipe purely to run more with my Gatling Plasma.
---
Ohhh. I didn't know and I been making it a point to visit the rare vendors. (exact location?) 
---
I realized the other day that some folks might miss that, but there's a body further down past the robot that has the machete on them.  Might be a more obvious container.
---
whats this season stuff? i havent heard of it yet

Oveerseers cache boxes

Welcome to superDuper Mart
---
Skip Whitesprings. It's no longer a good farming spot. 
---
plesent view ski lanes pal. :) 
---
Yeah but it was limited time you can't get that now without buying the entire thing. 
---
Is There any Way you Can get it earlier like Getting it from a drop or something ?
---
I'll take 500 caps for it. The 1* effect is damage increase with each consecutive hit on target
---
That would be great. I remember the epic fight to solo kill my first, and the disappointment at the fact it didn't have anything. Sick burn. 
---
Right at the edge of the river that's next to the charleston train station. To get it to spawn (try to spawn it) you run across the red train tracks, and run back. Something random will spawn there
---
Who the fuck asked for a survival mode that ignores the franchise's most recent amazing survival mode and instead just makes a griefer friendly PvP that ignores almost every other aspect of fallout 
---
Good to know. I'm also heavy/semi auto. I've honestly been wondering about bloodied builds because it seems like there are several legendary effects and perks that make you op, but what measures are required to keep yourself alive? I just imagine mobs being able to overwhelm your intentionally already low health really quickly. Do you have an auto stim piece and only carry diluted stimpacks? Do you have to keep your distance from mobs? I just can't quite figure out why they're so popular.
---
R&amp;G vendor seems to spawn this one quite often for me. If not that one then Lewisburg. one of the two down there on my circuit. occasionally found on Phoenix bot.
---
In believe they mean the half buried guy from trailer they wanna know if you can see him in game
---
Anti armour 
---
I remember finding a gravesite and there was half buried power armor
---
Ok. Will try now 
---
ITS LEVEL LOCKED NOT RNG. Buy it off someone
---
I‚Äôve had this issue with xbox1
---
There‚Äôs only 5 listed and 5 required :( oh well! Lol
---
1500 caps for the junkies assault rifle 
---
there are no armor plans for wood armor. they're automatically known from the start.  There is one wood armor mod plan for "shrouded"
---
What you asking for anti amour power fist.
---
I got a few legendarys I could trade or I'd offer 2k for it as it's only 1*
---
Irrelevant to pvp. Recent data showed that pvp is so unlike pve that most legendary effects don't matter. Weapons are categorized into subsets and those subsets do roughly the same amount of damage. 
---
Port forward your Xbox ports from Xbox official website
---
I think I remember picking up a wood armour plan in one of the bunkers around the mire. I play drunk tho mostly so take with a pinch.
---
That‚Äôs what I figured, I found it shot dead the other day just outside of Charleston station. Why do you people the need to kill the trader? 
---
The first overseer cache at overseers camp. And some of the containers in flatwoods. 
---
Yes I do but I won‚Äôt be on until tomorrow. 
---
come To my shop. Add me alteron_command  I'm sure we can work something out :) I will happily sell it for less then 2k :) 
---
A few months ago I wanted to give the Lakeside workshop which I had decked out with resource collectors and turrets, all powered up. I noticed a sub lvl 20 player was camped just up the hill so I ran up there and with my mic I told them I was leaving and they could have the workshop if wanted.  They apparently did not have a mic but understood and followed me back to the workshop. We arrive back at Lakeside and the player approaches the workbench and initiates the claim process. I'm kind of amazed it all went so smoothly and at that moment my turrets cut them to pieces in an instant. Oops, oh yea forgot about that. I left the server then so hopefully the tried again or did not loose their items. 
---
Overseer's Chest in Flatwoods is where I leave it all. Reason? Because if they're legitimately a new player (not a new alt), they're going to follow the quests and **will** end up at that chest. That, or I physically meet them (wearing non-threatening attire) and drop a bag, waving them over.
---
Since Flatwoods is the only one with an overseer's chest to plop stuff in, everywhere else I'll use a colored suitcase nearest the vendor bot. The cash register would've been the ideal choice, but it's generally obscured and not so easy to recognize. If there isn't a suitcase to use (like at Charleston's station) then I pick the nearest container to the workbench (the tiny side table in Charleston's case).
---
Early on I did testing with dropping stuff in lunch bags, and unless they changed it, they will despawn after only a few minutes. Which was a bummer, as I was running the food plant just West of Flatwoods and had put out a bunch of bags full of food and water (spaced out as to not combine). :( lol
---
Instigating. Why use two shots when one will do?
---
What did you do for five hours that you know he never left? 
---
A duper would say that.
---
weightless (armor) because im setting up my armor for cheap repair and weight reduction
---
AA/furious (weapon) not sure which i like more yet
---
Sweet! Is it lvl 45 or 50?
---
You are correct
---
Always store spare parts on spare frames
---
Frame weighs 10
---
Parts weigh like 10 each, lol
---
It depends wich build are you using. Im runing a bloodied + unyielding  stealth ranged build, and with that you can simply one shot every enemy, or player in PA. On the other hand, you must be careful not to get to close combat. Instigating it's another of my favourites
---
Willing to play. But you may want to level up to maybe 5 or 10 before you team up (so you have some of the basics sorted out by then)
---
In the first weeks there was a bug where that vendor just randomly dies.
---
Might not have been fixed.
---
Yeah I've had that happen on my farming runs too. Pick up a bunch of weapons and only be overencumbered when in pa really had me whirling. Underarmor in your pa is a must for sure, cuz it makes too much sense not to. And unfortunately I haven't gotten the opportunity to play 4 yet so I'm not 100% on how those worked but it sounds pretty cool I won't lie. 
---
Power armor frames with or without the armor pieces weigh 10. So by placing them on the armor the pieces weights don't count on your stash box 
---
I still would like to have SPECIAL quick respec option so I could try different gameplay styles on one char instead of grinding another
---
I drop everything I don't use at train station so. Starting to get better about not picking it up in the first place. 
---
Let us build Green houses.... they are already in game!
---
I do it all the time.
---
Find a low level player. Fast travel. Drop paper bag. Area audio- ‚Äòhi. I have some xyz for you- it‚Äôs in this paper bag. Have a good one‚Äô.

It's a lvl50.....add me and meet me at my camp. Schwiftywhisper 
---
&gt; TL;DR god tier weapons should be extremely rare but the trading groups disapprove this. Not only are they not rare, they always seem to have the exact same perks meaning it more plausible that these weapons are duped rather than found. 
---
And god tier weapons are rare, if they werent rare, people would be selling them for caps, but they aren't because current meta wasn't dupers priority. Back then no one gave a sh#t about assassin set or AAE weapons, so no one cared to dupe them. Now that they fixed dupe and nerfed TSE, meta shifted, people had to start again getting new meta sets.
---
You can say for TSE that these are duped weapons or unyielding sentinel, but these aren't even top tier gear and these aren't even op.
---
Thanks for the info. You run with heavy gun perks maxed out or one point in each?
---
Ok message me then 
---
Thanks for the info. I‚Äôll keep my eye on the market. 
---
I too would like to know. My gut tells me no, but maybe its something they will add sooner rather than later.
---
Supposedly they put more time on it last patch. Not sure how long it is.
---
Wait.. So is that why my camp was always griefed when I was set up there lol
---
This game was NEVER intended to be all about PvP. It was a way to finally explore the Fallout universe with friends, and people crossed over from Ark, Fortnite, and CoD and they are the ones doing the most bitching and complaining about the way PvP is handled. So, Bethesda did the right thing and made an Adventure (PvE) server and a Survival (PvP) server. They acknowledged and accommodated their new player base. Still that's not good enough for a lot of you, you want to still be able to leave survival and troll Adventure. You are missing the point; certain groups of players have made a valid, thriving PvP community, but this was never meant to be a PvP game. Hence why it is so broken and the two playstyles are being separated.
---
As someone who placed their camp near a spot where bloodleaf naturally grows as they make a lot of medical supplies; I vote for this.
---
As well as allowing us to plant aquatic crops 'freely' if we are near water. After all our camps are already case-sensitive when it comes to extractors.
---
One can only wish. Also a resizer thing because the image displayed goes outside of the boundaries of my tv.

No

Sold online in watoga. GT is AssaultLife352
---
Duped weapons have some impact, but it's all the sets of duped assassin/sentinel stuff that really broke pvp.
---
I have to vary a lot, since im overloaded most of the time (carry hundreds of legendaries with me) and have to use most weight reduction perks in strength :D
---
But most important are lvl 1 dmg perks, one gun army and stabilized (45% armor penetration). Rest is up to you. I'd also suggest bear arms and bandolier, so heavy weapons and ammo weigh almost nothing. 
---
That's the funny part. You can use auto stims, serendipity perk (I should get this, but want 15% more damage more) survivor autostim perk. Be warned auto stim perks and armor waste stimpacks randomly. The game uses one for no reason sometimes.  Since I have high agility and perception too, I sneak and vats targets. I can 1 hit most enemies if sneak attacking from a distance with 95% vats hit chance. I use distance to protect my health, and die to bad decisions a lot. 
---
I'll work on that. 
---
GrandHighblood36 is my name 
---
I think you‚Äôll have more visitors near Whitespring
---
The robots stop attacking you once you've completed the mission.  What you're missing isn't a game feature, it's friends.  Get some people to play with who can give you guidance and help you out and the game becomes way more fun.  If you're playing without a headset, get one, ask here for people on your platform who want to play together and you'll never regret it.
---
Will do m8
---
That has to be the politest and poshest reply I've ever known.
---
there is that child that wrote a letter to his father saying that he was waiting for him
---
and then you found another one saying that he is grown up man now, and understand that he leaves and also forgives him.
---
Nope, sadly. The best thing to do is level up and choose a card you need of a lower level. I hate it too.
---
Thank you for addressing all of my question. I agree that they probably did not put the place in the game, which is a shame. I miss the type of development that went into new vegas
---
How about Hallucinth
---
But you're very limited if you play solo or have nobody else to play with or have no caps (which happens often in pvp)
---
Wow, salty 
---
I don‚Äôt really understand your post but I find it interesting. Could you please use more words ?
---
Nuke made with cobalt. Cobalts reactions cause a fallout that can continue up to 130 years irl, and is even longer in fallout universe.
---
Oh interesting, if you find it again I'd love to know
---
The actual spot
---
Some are. Just look at first. After awhile you will figure out what you need or want. But you will have a good idea of where to look. You can get plans in cretain spawn locations. Each spot will spawn a different group of plans. If the plan there is not the right one leave it and server hop. That will change the plan. If you pick up the plan it won't spawn another one for something like a week.
---
5 is a bit much...maybe 2...1 is your main the other has reduced size.

"brain in a jar, Brain in a jar"

Holy cow!  I would love marsupial. I'll definitely try and find you. Saving up for the serum is not easy..

What's TSE?
---
I meant the actual spot and it actually being buried
---
Added your GT but says your offline?
---
I have duplicates on my excavator armor. 2 of each piece and 2 fusion cores show up on the frame. I know I only have 1 set, it‚Äôs got to be a glitch. I just ignore it, doesn‚Äôt effect anything for me. 
---
You're a legend. That's the type of mind-set that makes 76 worth playing. 
---
Yeah, I agree.
---
At least now you can do some legendary home improvement. Or...maybe legendary dental work?
---
Don't forget to drop by the wendigo cave, I hear it's value for money and the gift shop has some cool fridge magnets

I read another post. And it moves. I now know of 4 locations the stands been spotted. And they're all over the map.

See and that's a really hard trade off for me. As much as I do enjoy more of a sniper feel, I get too excited and like to jump into the shit guns blazing. And it wouldn't be so bad to wear PA when i wanted to do that, except for a few reasons. 1. Fusion cores spawn less often or cost a lot to make. 2.when they spawn, they are most often at 25%. 3. And most importantly imho, it takes too long to climb into PA before you get slapped to hell by whatever mob is around. 
---
Yeah it makes me wonder what you are doing, because almost all of the players I run into anywhere are friendly. There are occasional D-bags but the overwhelming majority are polite.  
---
You are one inspiring dude. :)
---
WTF does 'Can't do anything' mean?  Can't open menus?  Can't move?  does it log you in?  Can you get to the main menu?  A few details would be useful.
---
Yes, that's what I meant
---
I think it is 15%
---
Hey neighbor! My CAMP is directly underneath this bridge. I prefer to go under and keep a lower profile. But this looks like a cool setup you‚Äôve got going on!
---
Yes sentinel assassin is definitely functional in pvp is but I am doubtful that tse or even bloodied has much effect. A standard lvl 50 shotgun kills in 1-2 hits.
---
Can you do anything? Other apps or games still work? 
---
I‚Äôve never had a problem with my base but no, I haven‚Äôt tried traps. Have you found them to be effective?  And what about hitting non hostile players?
---
I will try to find that then
---
Power Armor can get really screwed up due to latency.  I remember once, coming back from a Scorchbeast Queen fight, the game considered me overencumbered after I got out of Power Armor because it was storing the pieces of the Power Armor on my character instead of on the frame, and there was no longer any "Power Armor Chassis" to place.  This went on for about 5 minutes before the Power Armor finally recalled itself to my inventory.
---
Modded raider under armor does 
---
What‚Äôs the other effects on the AA dragon?
---
There are no stat boosting clothing items in fo76. This is probably due to the fact it's an online game. The only forms of stat boosts you can get are legendary effects on armor
---
Hahaha, class.
---
oh I was playing with friends, we were all playing at the scorchbeast time and just trying to get the mistress quest done. 3 scorchbeasts pelting us in an area with only a corner of a single building that we could find as a safe haven was not fun
---
Thats where the bloodied/adrenal build comes in handy. You can do tons of damage very quick if you know how to handle the area. Scope out enemies and jump in with a TSE LMG and mow them down.
---
I still feel like I'm light-years ahead of you, boyo.
---
your use of the word griefing is incorrect.  Play more games to learn what multiplayer is all about.  Then reassess your post. 
---
This...should not shock anyone. The biggest complaint about PVP in this game is that the \_vast fucking majority\_ of "PVP" players are just toxic griefer assholes.   
---
That's the audience bethesda is trying to recruit into the game. 
---
Sadly, I am a poor struggling survivor whom collects junks for scrapping just to get by in these harsh times. Yet sometimes whilst murdering and cannibalizing my fellow survivors I wonder how could my life be simpler. Then I pull out my anti-armor explosive combat shotgun which I bought from with my hard earned caps and think "oh my heavens, what if this is an illegal copy?". I cry and cry and cry.
---
Tattered dress( i think it was called) ( a green and black striped dress
---
It wouldn't surprise me if it didn't exist in the game too.  But, pretty much everything else in the trailer does (it's actually fun to go back and watch it and be able to identify the different locations now).
---
Bethesda won't remove them anytime soon, most people who have duped items still paid for them (Be it with caps or even real money) and just removing all of them (Without any way for them to know if those items were duped or not since items in this game don't have an individual ID) would just cause a major backlash. 
---
If you played fallout 4, the same thing happens there too
---
That is super handy to know. 
---
Two Shot Explosive
---
Not new ones. At level 50 you can unlock every perk. If you planned your build out carefully, so you have no wasted slots, you could have a finished build at 50, or maybe a few levels after, if your build requires multiple points in a perk that unlocks at 50.
---
Everything after that is just moving points around or picking up different perks because you didn't plan things out well, or are changing your build up.
---
Oh that is cool
---
Huh, I guess my reading comprehension failed, my bad.
---
I've server hopped there ten times in a row and had a camp every single time before. Admittedly, it was the same camp three of those times, because bethesda. 
---
I live off diluted stimpaks, there's a perk card to double anything you craft with chems, forget what it's called but once you have that you can turn 1 stimpak into 4 diluted stimpaks

Two-Shot Explosive

There is actually something that might be a bit better than a switch, try to use a pressure plate instead, seems to be noticed more. 
---
Hmm, I'll try and set that up when I get back on. Thank you!
---
There is a surprising amount of minors playing, especially in the US servers
---
What I mean is that I cant do anything at the start menu, I press a button at the Press any button to start and it doesnt load the main menu, and then i tried joining my friend via the ps4 menu and it loads me in, but wont let me move, open my menu, or open my map
---
Damn, I figured this was the case. Tried this like 4 times last night. Does this mean I can‚Äôt get the next recipe cause I can‚Äôt finish the quest?
---
It took me ten tries to get it for that location.
---
I think your experience has been drastically different than mine. The audience as it exists is chock full of toxic, evil douchebags. 
---
There is no difference between level, lets say 100 and 500. Or 50 and 100.
---
It's not only weapon range issue. There seems to be an invisible wall there which cannot be penetrated by any weapon. Tried with most weapons, even guided missile launchers (rockets just disappear when hit it). More over - all cargobots restore health rapidly behind. The only way to take them down is to destroy their engines first to slow them down. After that - they may leave safe (for them) area for time enough to take them down. That requires enormous amount of ammo regardless of skill (took me about 2000 bullets for 4 bots, most of them hit that invisible wall). 
---
One thing is more interesting about that. During my attempts to take all of them down - I've triggered a bug. All my friends, even ones I was in team, saw me as in main menu of the game. Previously that indicated to server's instability and possible crash. But that time it was safe.
---
Here is a screenshot of one bot been taken down (not sure if I've added it right).

---
Just travel there in Adv, log out and log back into Sur. at the place you want.
---
If the camp is even partially unlocked and open I will repair anything that is broken and leave a bag with some plans or goodies before I leave.  If it's all locked up and is busted in I leave it as I found it.
---
Ofc they will. They want players to fight over workshops, not each other sh#t tons of distance away from workshop. If idea is to fight over workshop, then killing each other outside the workshops has no gain towards claiming the workshop.
---
Lucky hole mine is the single largest lead ore source, just remember you need acid to smelt the ore into lead scrap. But each unit of ore becomes 3 units of scrap so a little acid goes a long way
---
OH it's completely obvious the mass of duped items, as they are all the same.  TSE pump with weight, TSE gatling with weight, TSE handmade with agi (or was it per), TSE 10mm with ap cost, etc etc. 
---
they didn't break pvp though.  it was never intended to be honest or equal or even for everyone.  The only way to have a balanced pvp would be to create a seasonal ladder that would require brand new characters from everyone and have no crossover or compatiblity with non seasonal. (then just move that char to non-season when it's over)  It's not rocket science, I have hopes they go this route as it's a well established method.
---
To rule out controller issue have you tried another one?
---
Nope, just tried Call of duty, and it doesnt work at all either, now im confused
---
Yes I had this happen to me , ultracite armor had two sets in inventory for some reason after I stored it. Eventually disappeared but would be nice to figure how it happened so could farm cores or parts.
---
*I brandish a commie whacker made of Grafton monster skin*
---
Thanks I‚Äôll try that
---
Yeah privacy settings  screwed up what's your gamer tag
---
Next time, invite them to a team and then leave the server. It auto gives it to a team member when you leave. 
---
Not true all upgraded under armor had stats.
---
I've played Fallout 3 4 and this one and I never noticed.  Smh.  I feel stupid
---
Same logic still applies, ask for help, plenty of people will help and at the same time show you the techniques or skills you need to succeed.
---
I posted this idea a few days ago, having a tiny world you load in that shows you all your characters and their Stash, an lets you interact with everyone's inventories in order to move gear around. 
---
That was all a subset idea of adding in a Mail system to the game where then between-characters we'd be able to send packages of infinite size to easily transfer stuff. Mailing to other accounts would be limited to 50lbs though. 
---
If you're interested in reading the ideas it in their entirety, it's somewhere in my profile page (I'm assuming we can see each other's post lists, like I can see my own?)
---
In other words, I support this message! :)
---
Yes it‚Äôs happened to me a few times. You don‚Äôt actually have 2 pieces. It just displays it as you do. üëç
---
A level 200 *may* have better gear be they farmed more, *OR* the level 50 may have better gear because they got lucky or bought something from another player or are on their second or third character. There's no way to know that based just on the characters levels.
---
Yup. There aren't any raider RPers. Just sociopathic griffer asshats. 
---
One small favor in regards to stash limits.
---
I hated this game, because I'm not a multiplayer kind of person. However, I started playing it and realized that its not as bad as I thought. I actually love this game now and I often find myself playing for hours on end when I probably need to be doing something else. I love building bases (except for the stupid powered posters) and exploring everything. It does need a lot of fixes, but hopefully those kind of things will come with time.
---
Okay so talk to me about that combo. I assume bloodied gives higher added damage. So where do you draw the line? How many of each gives you the best damage output to health regen?(ie 2 pieces that are adrenal and 3 bloodied)
---
So I used to use the overseer's chest at the overseer's camp. But then I had a thought...if they haven't hit that chest yet, would they even get the stuff as it's filled with quest items.???
---
I only look at reddit on my iPhone and Iv never figured out how. 
---
Thanks! 
---
how you did fasnatch then?
---
It's most likely the engine they use. It just cant handle it.
---
That's why stash limits and camp budgets are so low.
---
Well it wasn‚Äôt a feature in Fallout 3. It was added for current gen systems.
---
I would also like to see 76 open up again, but not as a player hub, but instead as a dungeon of it's own.
---
Force your way back inside, nothing is running, it's dark, and suddenly all those Mr. Handy's aren't friendly anymore.
---
Obviously the place shut down enough that it couldn't sustain life anymore, but it's not like they sucked the oxygen out, people could still technically go inside if they can get past the door. But what secrets lie inside that we didn't care to look for until now?
---
Lemme think on it stealth builds and fairness for a few before I comment. I will say that  a general area marker would be better that pinpoint location. But if top 3 players were based off kills it's usually a nearly unkillable player which isnt fair or fun to fight. 
---
Not really 
---
if you have some anti robots mace you can go one shooting everything xd
---
I could dig this. Can I make mole rat hide armor like mole miners while we are at it?
---
Solo with lots of others around.
---
I had to solo the entire event twice though.
---
Adrenal reaction is a mutation. You trade a little health (12 if you have class freak maxed) for more damage at low health. Bloodied is a legendary weapon type, in the first star slot.
---
I really enjoyed building power armour. That was my thing. That was the best progressive thing because it helped you survive harder bosses. Is there anything updated with that side of the game?
---
IIRC there was just a system update, are you currently up to date?
---
Accept the fact that you somehow don‚Äôt understand how to not put yourself in harms way with the current rules, despite it being painfully simple. Personally, I enjoy contesting shops and slaughtering people as they attempt to defend. I don‚Äôt need to stalk people across the map because they just never give up and keep seeking revenge until they‚Äôre totally broke. The salty runback is real. 
---
So that you dont accidentally kill other event participants when you are fighting mobs. Most mobs are melee based and if you shoot them you also shoot the person they are attacking. That's why.
---
Storywise explained through Terminals inside, Vault 76 would have shutdown excatly 1 day after YOU left the vault. Means No Air, Water, Energy etc and never would go back online
---
Flat woods chest and Overseer camp are my two drop offs on PS4.
---
FU.
---
Oh yeah duh.  üòÇ
---
Instigating is the unsung hero of PvE combat. Swing speed for melee players is amazing. The thing about anti armor for melee builds is that Incisor makes everything 75% armor piercing
---
If I remember right, the enclave underarmor gives the biggest perception boost, especially when shielded. 
---
Wow you are a saint, that worked!!
---
When was the last patch? I‚Äôve been away at PAX so haven‚Äôt played much, but kept seeing posts about people being chain-killed in survival (which sounds horrendously frustrating).
---
Maybe but it's possible and it makes since if someone sneak attacks you. Sure they are a bit unbalanced for single shot damage but if that didnt kill you then they wouldn't stand a chance once you found them. 
---
Check out the greenbrier!!!
---
Oh and if possible the real life fasnacht parade in Helvetia.
---
Those two are the main reason i want to go to West Virginia
---
Heh, I'm not surprised - I would highly suggest you quit while ahead, but I wish you luck in whatever you do. 
---
A copy of the above note was  found by a kid called Three Dog about 200 years from now.
---
I'm with you man, cuz I swear if I get one more godd**n wood left leg, I'm going underground and b**chslapping SQB with a burlap sack.
---
When does this happen? Will it still happen in survival?
---
No probs, everyone needs these free atoms.
---
Literally nothing that would cause assholes to flock to me. I'm nice, I give out free shit.
---
Criticals do +50% damage. 25% less AP cost. Ignores 50% of targets armor
---
If you drink enough high proof booze you can in fact hallucinate. Absinthe before the early 20th century bans frequently had other things added besides wormwood that might have made people see things.  Lots of pre 20th century absinthe had been made by people with grade school educations and sometimes the cuts would have significant amounts of the heads and tails of the distillate , which contain toxic substances, in it.  Finally some people never too the plant material out of the mash and thus the distillate would sometimes have wood grain alcohol in it.  All of those things can make you loopy. 
---
There‚Äôs a diesease that makes you take 50% more rad damage, rad worms I think.
---
I agree that it isn't very authentic but I say let people use whatever they have as that's what raiders do. I personally dont use PA at all. I just run a quad explosive doublebarrel and full Assassin Sentinal which is much better and looks more authentic with the new blood covered "survival skin" on it anyway.
---
Schwiftywhisper
---
Hmm it is for me and I‚Äôm lvl 22
---
Oh shit my bad I was even looking it up and wasnt looking at the fact that it's a mutation. I'm not so sure about needing class freak (my build has high luck and I'd rather not rebuild to suit it), but picking between using a couple more special points and having 38 less health is personal opinion. However I don't have a high endurance either so my health is already not amazing. 
---
lore-wise all life supporting systems were shut down three days after reclamation day; so no water, no food, no lights and no oxygen. 
---
Yeah I had a checked for diseases cuz I was around s lot of glowing ones but nothing. 
---
I find the best place to leave gifts for new players (or other players in general) is ‚Äúat their feet‚Äù
---
There's a half-buried set of PA when you approach Huntersville from the SE (going NW) around where the BOS cemetary is.
---
Inventory meaning on your person or is in the stash ok

What do I look like a scab or something? I only use  the good stuff! Psychobuff, now that's where it's at!!!

Kudos to all involved. You are LEGENDARY *** 
---
I agree! I'm tired of getting killed for a workshop I don't even want. I even tell them I don't want it and they still kill me (shot in the back while walking away).

I still comeback to adventure mode but when I do I usually go to workshops and drop all my unwanted aid and junk from my victims for lower level people. 
---
Wasteland Robin Hood style.
---
Scared to go to a gamemode with a few bugs and problem thats still in Beta. Who wouldn't be scared.
---
Awesome. Thanks again.
---
Ya, I see that now. Was skimming in my lunch at work.
---
Ah, I figured it was a mobile trader. Maybe on the spot if you come across them you offload some chems or junk at least.
---
As I said to each their own opinion. 
---
I actually never did bos line. I didn't like paladin danse. With his douchey attitude and smug I'm too cool for a helmet face. I did railroad then farmed brotherhood ass holes who gave up full t60 suits and gat lasers upon death. 
---
Thanks for the heads up. I'll have to also learn to not pick up known plans again and try server hopping instead.
---
Because you drop aid items in survival mode.
---
Still happens in Survival but I don't know when it will be implemented
---
No problem here.
---
Can I join?
---
I made this point back just before duper ban. Got downvoted to oblivion. Almost all OP weapons and armor are duped and used by A LOT of people. If I see TSE anything being used I'm assuming duped cheat weapon instantly. Not fair to the guy who hit the lottery and legit got one, but the dupers ruined the uniqness of this legendary since day one.The drop rate for this effect got gimped as I've never even seen explosive anything but have seen everything else drop for me. I've seen you tubers using a plethora of OP duped TSE weapons which are player trades.  Just because you willfully ignore the roots of the OP weapon you buy or trade for does not mean it's not a cheat weapon. Duped weapons really hurt this game (especially survival mode) and I don't think BSG can stop it right now. They need to DNA each 2/3 star legendary and delete dupes using that DNA fingerprint. 
---
That's why having more useful mutations reinforces class freak's benefits. I have Bird bones, adrenal, carnivore, grounded, healing factor, herd mentality, marsupial, scaly skin, and speed demon. Barely any negatives at all from class freak.
---
This is exactly why I got a second account...
---
I‚Äôll be on again in about 90 minutes. Swing on by!

Thanks!!

Damn it I got excited and saw you're on PS4.
---
This is a well reasoned assessment so far I'd say.  
---
By speaking the truth?? I actually run a rifle build as melee is boring as all get out. 
---
Explain what you think the competition in PVP is exactly, because I don't think it is what you think it is. 
---
If Bethesda couldn‚Äôt be bothered with proper 21:9 support on PC after a month of ‚Äútesting‚Äù. I don‚Äôt think ever do anything like that on console.
---
It's very unfortunate.
---
There's a fix for that. Can't remember exactly but something to do with aspect ratio settings on your TV. 
---
Holy hell! There was a ton more stuff in fo4. I hope that's what it'll look like in fo76 some day. 
---
Interesting...
---
You're nuts if you think people aren't still duping. 
---
Same im lvl like 25 dippity_dab 
---
Far as I heard server hopping is hard in survival mode as adventure is alot more popular. But that just what I heard.
---
And just to be a little evil, I wouldn't mind maybe having a perk card that you can leave a grenade that would go off if picked up. 
---
Flatten it.
---
Is it alteron_command?    Psn
---
The last thing this game needs is a nerf. Nerfing melee is not the answer. Melee is fine where it‚Äôs at. It‚Äôs the other builds with the cost of bullets and power are the real problem. Make those compete instead of bringing melee down to match. 
---
I'd say option 1 is delete and reinstall
---
As a person who made an alternate character, which has no duped items, 
---
It‚Äôs still easy to kill people.
---
SBQ isn't worth fighting. Turns into a shitshow, and half the time I get a couple ammo out of her and that's it. 
---
At least you tried. I have tried giving them away before I leave a server, by way of sending out team requests and a message telling them my plan. no one has ever taken me up on the offer though. 
---
"they didn't break pvp" really? So the guy griefing a half a dozen of us with his TSE Gatling wasn't broken?
---
Just messaged you on Xbox.  
---
At  least you tried. I have tried giving them away before I leave a server,  by way of sending out team requests and a message telling them my plan.  no one has ever taken me up on the offer though.
---
TSE isn‚Äôt even the best anymore and explosive on shotguns seems annoying tbh.  I would go for instigating if its a DB or furious +fire rate or AA + fire rate if its a combat shotgun since there is no armor piercing perks for shotguns.
---
yeh
---
Death penalties are fine to me, so os bbn lack of fast travel I wish we could make disposable spawn points tho so we can plan thi gs out and not get trapped to spawn campers. But bvb I like that is harsh I like the pvp so j can get 200 plus caps each kill if I can pull it off. And someti.es the loot you get sells for alot cuz it seems ppl carry alot sometimes 
---
I got no problems with tye awesome weapons and then being used in PVP. Except the fact that these weapons were A) likely duped and B) farmed in adventure mode. Both of these facts make survivor mode broken.
---
I know that is what i am saying they made it like a  mmo so it can be played  for years  
---
Uranium fever would be a good one for you since The enemies that spawn there are maxed out at level 40.
---
White Springs golf course it doesn't have to be nuked.
---
Inside and outside of West Tek
---
 There a bunch more spots but anywhere really has a chance of spawning legendary enemies.
---
Survival mode.. I've gotten  afew hundred by now lol
---
Not really , just join events specially sons of Dane 
---
I do it all the time as I use the facilities for purified water and such.
---
Because by releasing a product a small minority of the player base wanted, they ended up alienating the core fan base.
---
Lmao
---
Stop picking it up. 
---
That happened to me too. I tried getting away but kill after kill, my friend just left the event so I could get away.  Then the dude kept coming after me.
---
You feel like duplicated weapons broke pvp!? Theres a lot more wrong with the current pvp environment than a few duped gear.  What if the tse that you all got mowed down by was legit.!? I have a couple explosive's that were legit dropped. Would that make you feel like it's not broken if you got mowed down by a legit one!? Nah man..its a larger defective system.
---
Plans for individual pieces are awarded though the "Distant Thunder" event but it's all RNG.  After running that event dozens of times I think I only have plans for the left and right leg. 
---
Server hopping for level 50 T60 and level 50 T51 is way easier than server hopping for most things. Keep hitting the right places, and you should be able to have full set in a matter or hours.   I've done it for myself and for people I play with.   Watoga and cranberry bog area is best, at all the brotherhood bases in the bog on on top of the emergency center.
---
800?
---
I‚Äôm optimistic but I think I‚Äôd rather use caps or run events to ‚Äòbuy‚Äô the modifiers I want. Want anti-armor? Kill 100 sb or bring in 1000 fuzzy tokens or whatever
---
I would be happy with a buff to SPECIAL points -- let's say 1 point each perk.  Additional 5 points wouldn't do much to make anyone OP, but it would allow better multi-role builds.
---
Can someone please confirm this?  I can't find anything online about it and I want to make sure they are truly bugged/useless before replacing them on both legs.
---
Just saw it for 11000 caps... that‚Äôs crazy! 
---
Lmao Only in the gaming industry is it totally ok to buy a broken unfinished product at launch.
---
Your A is mostly irrelevant. (Because instead of 5% of players owning the servers making everyone QQ, you have more folks killing more often) The B is spot on. 
---
I've never seen this vendor... How do I do this?
---
Higher fov means more to render which means console performance would be even more fucked (not that its good on lmao)
---
Do a search on this sub. It‚Äôs been gone over a lot. There are specific routes that make it the most beneficial. The uranium fever event is great for lower level 40 and under legendaries but is capped at 40. Not exactly end game gear. 
---
Also, and I might be alone in believing this but I think nuke zones are somewhat a waste of time as you and everyone else will be trying to farm the same stuff. I find server hopping and farming fresh areas much more efficient.
---
cheers ill be sure to grind that out as i just got a bos knight paintjob for the t60 and thought id find a decent set and put it on there
---
What are satellite comms compared to missiles?
---
Thanks. +Krama
---
Seems like all vents are bugged 
---
Who cares? It‚Äôs a role playing video game. They‚Äôre role playing an asshole. Be better or die. Online games are designed for how you react to a real person doing something. Amazing that you think the rules are unfair when the rules heavily benefit the player who shoots second, generally not the aggressor. 
---
IIRC there aren't any level-based plans anymore after vendors were reworked to carry mostly the same plans, but I'm not sure.
---
Move your camp to flatwoods and go afk in a bed farm that one event automatically 
---
Whenever i give estimates is for the most realistic scenario. 
---
It's also based on my day-to-day build. Not on my SBQ fight set-up. I don't carry with me Prime weapons. I also got a Bloodied The Dragon which could be boosted up to a few k in damage but i'm not carrying it with me. 
---
Then we have the missed shots, which i'm including in my estimates. SB will fly around and usually there are lots of trees/obstacles. I do have to take low % shots so concentrated fire improves my hit chance.
---
Yes in theory we can all kill a SB with just a couple of shots, but that's only if we're prepared for this encounter and only if everything goes perfectly.
---
I don't want to go down the theorycrafting rabbit hole, check this thread if you want that https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9wic1m/sneak_crit_headshot_multiplier_theory_crafting/
---
You can theoretically kill SB in 1 shot, if everything goes your way.
---
Thanks for that. :)
---
Its worth it in general. 
---
you can max out the first one then get it again and it starts over at one star. 
---
There are random encounter spawns all over the map.
---
 This robot vendor spawns at 2 of them that I know of, I'm sure there are other spots.
---
 One is by Charleston train station and the other one up near the soft serve ice cream place.
---
 You have to be really lucky and hope he spawns out of the 15 to 20 random encounters you can find at those spot.
---
 Some people server hop at those spots to increase the odds of finding him.
---
 I am level 150 I can count on one hand how many times I have seen the robot vender.
---
I think it was in the forest region or on the boarder of it, I can't remember it was back in the beta when I stumbled upon it.
---
Well one possible fix is to add level based matchmaking so you wouldn't have higher lvls players cause higher spawns
---
What serum recipes? 
---
Too bad this got an instant negative vote. If this got some steam I'm sure a lot of people would also like this idea. It needs to be thought about, otherwise a few months down the line developers will wonder why people are upset that loot is tied to a specific season character that wont be played again. I'll personally dump them and just keep loot on a main like I do with other games that have season features. 
---
So, does server hopping help with this then I take it? I'll be doing that all day I suppose lol.
---
i currently have 13 left
---
Thats not a bad idea. 
---
The only place I've had this issue in is in and near Whitesprings since thats where everyone hangs out. 
---
Most definitely. Keep in mind that FO4 takes place like 200 years later, but realistically, in terms of PA, those are all pre-war. So these 'models' and paints would technically be available to us in FO76's time *(they're indeed in the game files, I just don't think they're actually obtainable yet)*. Except for the X-01 "Mk" models, which I won't get into due to qualifiably-irrelevant spoilers with lore, but I suspect it would be mentioned on the X-01's page if you felt so inclined to find out. However, fair warning that reading too much of the FO4 wiki is ill advised as you'll spoil the entire story quicker than you can imagine :) *(And it's a good story, so you really don't want to do that!)*

Yes yes yes, check my previous post. Totally stuck here.  Tons of level 40-50 mole miners trying to get into the bloody mine. And then when you get in there, level 40-50 packs of wolves or dogs or whatever. I started trying to do this quest at level 15. Im now level 17, tried it again, after server swapping several times to avoid all the level 100+. I still got owned by these beasts. Please help someone.
---
This is exactly how I feel about the game. I like the game, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt be highly critical of it. If I pay money for a product I expect quality. Especially for a franchise like Fallout. It seems like only in the gaming industry is not ok to expect quality for something you paid for.
---
I do think all PA pieces should receive another craftable mod slots. 
---
In a regular armor I have 5 craftable mod slots and 15 legendary mod slots. In PA I only get 6 craftable mod slots, and it should at least be doubled.
---
I think it'd be cool if legendary vendor tokens would allow you to slot non-PA legendary effects into PA pieces.
---
Yup.  If you going to server hop best bet is to do it by the ice cream shop because people have camps at the Charleston station all the time.
---
Anything over max weight will get destroyed anyways once you do get back on. 
---
You should have received an email saying you had ‚Äú_____‚Äù items. 
---
Right now banned players are not a priority at all so once they know they can remove items they‚Äôll let the suspended players back. 
---
Tell them the truth in the ticket plain and simple... 
---
Will you be on later tonight? 
---
They should splash and they don‚Äôt do anything 
---
Not being able to communicate long range is a huge disadvantage, not to mention form a lore perspective Gunners outrank Talon Company. They are literally stronger enemies. Having a missile base is not what wins a war, strategy and tactic far outweigh munitions. 
---
Biv is that you? Get off reddit and back to handing out daily quests. You silly drunk.
---
Your absolutely right. I am not really angry I got mowed down. I am simply wanting this game, which I very much enjoy, to be treated by Bethesda in a less bizarre way. This game is gonna die of they dont pull their head out quickly.
---
Wait your camp can be destroyed?? Even in adventure? 
---
Do I lose all my shit like the walls and crafting tables?
---
Man I wish I knew then before I plonked it down out in the open 
---
I was thinking one main camp, and a much smaller one for shopkeeping, some signs/lights, and vending machines. I‚Äôd be happy with a little 2x2, so I can just place that close to one area, and my main shop/camp where it is. No need to move, and tweak things on my main shop, but can still have a smaller shop that I can place around the map. My camp/main shop are too complicated for the blueprint system. I‚Äôd hate to have to tear it down all the time. 
---
&gt;most people who have duped items still paid for them
---
And they knowingly bought them from people who were dupers.  Secondly, the people I know who did that only bought them because ***not having them*** made surviving in PVP impossible. 
---
I don't think there would  be major backlash. People who  paid caps and real money for them tell me they did so because they felt like PVP was impossible without them.  They have told me they wouldn't care if Bethesda removed theirs as long as all the others are removed too.
---
People bought them trying to level the playing field.  A lot of people would be fine to have a level playing field where TSE is a rarity. 
---
If the top 3 killers would be displayed, people would simply have to kill everybody on sight if they wanted to lure organised groups. Now you can take precautions to make sure you are nit a map-beacon AND you can be leader without spawn-killing people.
---
Opposite: tick blood for stimpaks, tick blood sacks for antiseptic. 
---
How far away from the ice cream shop is it? So I can see if it spawns in? I love rare things.
---
I'm lvl 109. Knightofthecrow is my players name. Ed Knight on the PS4 I'm about to jump on after a shower. I like helping new players.
---
Upvote
---
You‚Äôre literally naked in PA... nothing stacks at all.
---
If you place it just right, you can spawn inside your house just about every time 
---
Ugh you're really in the same boat as I am. Its irritating since I completed the quest last night but then got the progress reset. I'm really not sure what to do here. 
---
Yea
---
There's a challenge to kill 76 Scorchbeasts for 40 Atom pts. It's something :)
---
Yea if that‚Äôs ok
---
holy shit this was awesome.  thank you for the info. you rock
---
Exactly, I became a fan of the franchise, because of the amazing narrative it used to have. Whilst, exploration, base building, and crafting is fun, it will never replace a good story.
---
Thanks for correcting me. Always getting the 2 confused :D
---
I can't get them to work for the life of me.  Really disappointing, they were a great tool to have in FO4
---
You don‚Äôt lose it, it just needs to be repaired
---
Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not that bad
---
Anywhere that's not certain death for a level 20 character? lol
---
Furious or 25% faster fire rate 
---
I myself wear a great set and have a perfectly aligned characters. It allowed me things like 1v3ing group of people that tried to spawnkill me. I intend to keep my place on top, but I fight people and while being a good player thats perfectly geared I'm not unkillable. I fight and I sometimes die. For a group of people there is no reason to get rid of bounty or the leaderboards position. As a map marker you are guaranteed people will come after you, but its up to you and your team to set up the arena and define the rules of the encounter. Nobody sane loses that advantage intentionally.
---
Got any Trapper Armor by chance? I'm pretty good on weapons though I'd be interested in an AA Boxing Glove just to see what that's like.
---
I know I wasn‚Äôt involved in these trades, but I have to thank you for saying the selling price.   I wish more did that. 
---
That comment was directed toward Beth. I should have specified.
---
To be fair I find it equally annoying when I have to server hop because the low levels are making my enemies lower level. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm pretty sure there are more than 5 listed, it scrolls down to show more. The one you mentioned bugged for me too and I just continued to next cemetary after trying 3 times.
---
That was the mod for shrouded in Raleigh Clay's bunker. Good memory for being drunk, man. 
---
Stop trying to do quests out of your league and do the ones designed for lower levels in the forest lol 
---
maybe real late but i can put it aside for you if you're sure you will get them at some point in the near future
---
thank you.  you said it way better than I did.
---
Last 3 nukes I walked into the last 2 days and server crashes soon after. 2 queens mid fight and whole server disconnects 
---
No problem  i figure it helps with the price checks 
---
Nah man
---
*pulls out commie whacked made from liberator bots*
---
maybe I'll shoot pistol fingers out there one day at ya.  good hunting ya hear
---
This quest isn't out of my league. I've completed it before but my progress got reset. 
---
I mean Talon Company have never really shown the full extent of their abilities. And aren‚Äôt just in Washington.
---
But yes be able to communicate long distances can deflect missiles.
---
I had the same problem. You have to go to Big Al's Tattoo Parlor and read the poster there, this will trigger the next step.
---
&gt; And they knowingly bought them from people who were dupers.
---
That's not necessarily true, those items likely switched many hands before their final destination, plus you would still be punishing people that used their legitimately earned caps (And I suppose real money as well) for something that's still Bethesda's fault at its core.
---
Nah I still think the best way to solve the duping problem will be the legendary vendor. 
---
Uh
---
I don‚Äôt 
---
Wdym
---
By not doing this they extend play time for each player. It‚Äôs in their best interest to not do this tbh. Even tho I do agree doing this makes sense. 
---
You are absolutely correct, and the only way anyone is still playing this game is for three reasons.
---
1. They were a duper/exploiter
---
2. They are new
---
3. They are so hopelessly invested in this game that they force themselves to play against their own judgement and just continue to grin in the hope that it will get better, or they will encounter an exciting experience.
---
Oh! I didn‚Äôt know it scrolled. Thank you!
---
I smelt something was off the first time I spent 2-3 hours getting dicked on this quest!
---
Sometimes you can remap each game to match the default settings on the mouse, but some games like Fallout 76 have a few keys that cannot be changed, making a custom profile necessary.
---
You should be able to make a profile in Synapse for each game that needs to be customized, then configure each of the buttons on the mouse to match the controls for the game as needed.
---
Thanks! =D
---
Hi, imprezo.  It happened once on the north side of Watoga and then once again on the west side of Harper's Ferry.  Had my frustration not got the best of me as I bled caps, I would have kept the running capture.
---
Running theory: Event areas were not reverting their "Status of PCs in an event area" rules after the event timers had expired.  I was fresh on the server in Watoga but I saw the Harper's Enclave event about 40mins prior to heading to that location. 
---
if you have the caps go to the vendor in watoga and buy the plans you need
---
1000 and I'll throw in the ammo I have left 
---
eh it's all good.  no worries
---
Yes noticed two weeks ago with a bud of mine we figure it would be good adoptions for our jet pack
---
Seems like a lot of work to do every time i wanna get somewhere
---
Fallout 76 isn‚Äôt made to just follow the missions.  Some missions require you to level up more and explore before completing them.  Everyone tries to rush the storyline missions when they‚Äôre not ready.  The forest is made up to 15 and the top area to 25, the south until 35.  Once you go east it‚Äôs level dependent.  It‚Äôs meant to keep you in areas to level up first.    Or you can get a high level to come along and kill enemies for you but it takes away the fun.
---
I totally agree. Perks that are used for functional tasks like crafting and lock picking shouldn‚Äôt be apart of the current perk system. Combat and functionality should be separate because the current system just involves tedious swapping.!
---
&gt;so they still troll survival mode harassing players and finding ways to force PvP.m, so they can have easy opponents and feel better about how bad they suck.
---
And  a lot of times they fail in adventure mode too. Some guy took my power plant last night, which I could have cared less about because I had the cores I wanted.
---
He tracked me down and I killed him... about five times I think. 
---
Even though I won, none of it was what I consider "fun." 
---
Right from the start I made a theory that one of the possible realistic 'end-game' scenarios would be to fully destroy the scorchbeast threat, through the use of these nukes and finding the real queen and lair. Upon doing all of this, the new vaults should open to release their own dwellers since the wasteland would now be  much safer (as prognosed by the BoS).
---
After this the game could dynamically change direction, with the aid of hidden trigger-able storylines or completely new DLCs.
---
It makes the most sense to do it this way. I mean scorchbeasts are literally the most evil and annoying enemy I've ever seen in a game. We HAVE to have a way to end those sum'bitches.
---
Ive seen a scorched conquerer run around and fight with an auto grenade launcher... as an unarmed melee weapon. Had his fists up with the auto grenader launcher clipped through for some reason.
---
...and other times, I see scorched with gamma guns with a minigun fire rate, and then i die shortly after
---
Faster than hoofing it, depending on your load times.
---
Plus less chance of getting ambushed, right as you hit bottom on your AP, from sprinting across the map...
---
I understand that, it is just irritating to have completed this quest only to have the progress taken away then apparently not be able to complete it again. 
---
Precisely why Survival mode should be a new character that cannot transfer between modes.  If there are rewards that you can only obtain from Survival mode that you would like in Adventure mode then if you manage to earn it on your Survival character you will obtain a schematic for your Adventure character, but not vice versa.
---
Just lucky on the X01 shocks.  I have found 2 X01 shocks myself (and equipped them).  In the same time period I found 9 T-60 Calibrated shocks.  And 4 X01 Jetpacks
---
T-60 shocks just aren't as rare, and a lot more vendors can have them.  (Plus, loose mods spawn in places like Camp Venture).
---
I‚Äôm going to have to move it around, in every camp I‚Äôve had I spawn quite far away from it. Any tips on placement or is it completely random?!
---
Apparently there's a drop down in the top right corner. I use Android, but I'm also a mobile only person. 
---
First impressions matter whether you like it or not. The game came out unfinished and broken. Even if Bethesda manages to fix every single problem the game has, people will forever see it as broken mess. Look at No Man Sky. While it‚Äôs a pretty decent game now, the general perception that it failed hasn‚Äôt really changed.
---
Weird, on PS4 I could hear him from upstairs before I even realized how to get to where he was.
---
Vents appear to be bugged across the board, even Excavator ones.
---
Plans for the Power Armor pieces can also be acquired thru Treasure Maps.  Rare drops though.  I've done a lot of maps and only got two pieces of Power Armor armor plans. (Not PA mod plans, got plenty of those from maps, they drop more often than the actual power armor plans)
---
Watoga is the best spot I've found for finding those high level T60 pieces.  Easy to hop, and 4 PA spawns.  Bog has some too, but you don't usually have to worry about nuke zones or scorchbeasts just hopping in Watoga proper.
---
I completely logged out and back in. that seamed to fix the issue.
---
Mmm.  I'd say it's common in prostitution too.
---
does it jump up to 760 and 7600 after the 76? 
---
This.
---
It's like turning things off and on again. That is actually a really cheap fix for really bad design. It may work as an interim fix, but it really needs to have to source problem fixed. 
---
Where do the mods spawn at camp venture? If that's a possibility, the BOS may start getting more of my technical data.
---
I mean we‚Äôve already got the bone club which is a weapon made of what looks like a scorched‚Äôs bones so I‚Äôm down for this
---
Truth the game definitely has some issues.  Luckily it‚Äôs only progress vice your best gear.
---
Sounds good, I‚Äôm doing some survival challenges atm so can I get it from you later?
---
Soooooo did you sell all of it?  My offer still stands! 
---
Ok, in the interest of full disclosure, I feel the need to say I did not, in fact, pay for the game--it came with a hardware bundle (Blue Yeti Blackout Microphone, for those curious). That does not negate anything you said at all (I agree 100%), just feel that for the sake of integrity and truth in journalism (now *there's* an oxymoron) it needs to be known that I got my copy free (I'm a wannabe gaming YouTuber,  I don't want that to come back and bite me in the ass, is what I'm driving at).
---
You're right though, the gaming industry seems to be the place that you just have to accept dross trash, with a smile what's more, because you should feel special they even deigned to grace you with the product in the first place. Sad state of affairs, it is.
---
That's the price at a vendor right? I got that price w hard bargain 3.
---
Not all law suits are about getting money.  I never said I want some kind of payoff.  I do believe a corporation is more motivated to fix a problem by a court order than a friendly recommendation on a reddit post.
---
Honestly, it could just be those that farm stuff have dropped in number, making it appear that much more for you. For instance, I'm guessing it's a lot easier to get the quantum paint job now that the hype around it has died a little. 
---
I‚Äôm no raider, but I am a crazy cultist on my new character roaming in Ritual Gear to ‚Äòcleanse‚Äô the survival lands. 
---
However... interfere with Enclave business in adventure... You be dealt with. Severely.
---
Agreed! I also very much prefer PvE.. but will engage PvP if I have to. 
---
I took the opportunity to try out Survival mode for leveling my Alt for the XP boost. Although it's sad when I die, it's the chance I take for the boost. Hopefully, when I get her leveled enough and sorted with perks and gear, I can do some challenges. 
---
Totally on point with you about the leader board. Should have something in there to account for kill count I think.
---
Nice post! 
---
Is there any mention from Bethesda in regards to this issue?
---
Why is that irritating? You should expect higher level enemies to be there. Your character us the one that doesn't belong.
---
Both are okay. I have an Exterminator's Handmade equipped but no Exterminator's item in my stash at all. I'm getting a lot of Exterminator's armor and ranged weapons, but almost no melee for some reason. In an unbiased distribution, the split should bet 2:1:1 yet it is 3:0:1 effectively for me.
---
This. Ban this ass.
---
Me and my GF drove down from The Pit and hit a couple of things close to the pan handle. VTU is in Morgantown, Pricketts fort, Fort Defiance,  Senica Rocks, Spruce Knob, The Penitentiary  The Teapot and the Palace of the Winding Path  are all pretty close to Morgantown.  But the WV tourism fallout map was super helpful.  Yes it's a real map made by the West Virginia tourism department. 
---
https://wvtourism.com/fallout76/
---
Everything was level 10 when I went there the first time and completed the quest. 
---
Yup no problem. GT is Schwiftywhisper 
---
That's a repeatable find though. It spawns with the server. If someone else got it, it's gone. The mods at a vendor are rng when you load the area from what I've read and those are a set spawn rate/odds. I get your thought process though. You're probably right about the quantum paint, so thank you for a new goal.
---
The locked storage room right next to the Tech Data turn in slot.  There is a shelf that has a missile launcher, random grenades, and some other junk.  It can spawn a mod.  Usually a weapon mod or a power armor mod.
---
The shelf beneath the tech data turn in slot can also spawn plans/mods, but I've never seen them spawn a power armor mod.  Usually Dense/Hardened/etc mods for Marine/Combat armor.
---
Up in the middle area with the Scorched, the three crates next to the Power Armor Stations and the Power Armor spawn, a power armor mod can spawn there ontop of the crate.  I've never seen it spawn anything other than power armor mods.  (But it's not always there).
---
And I'm pretty certain I've seen a Power Armor mod spawn on the table next to the Weapons Bench inside the level 3 locked cage area (room next to the Power Armor Spawn).  It's usually a weapon mod plan (Beta Tuners and NV Scopes for the most part), but I think I've seen it spawn mods before, and sometimes they are Power Armor mods.
---
There are two mod spawns up on the very top level inside the room by the shooting range.  But I cannot say I've ever seen those spawn as power armor mods.  So I usually ignore those two.
---
The new inside the vault states they're adding it 
---
I think the game is pretty new player friendly.
---
I often help out new players with exploring and quests and give them items and plans. I think many other high level players are similar in my experience. It's something fun to do once you've completed everything else in the game.  If someone doesn't want to help newbies they are more likely going to ignore them then cause trouble.  
---
I don't experience griefing very often, and the few times I did it usually was someone deciding to destroy my camp. That only has happened maybe twice in the 250+ hours of playing.  
---
Overall I think the in-game community is pretty friendly. The exception now might be in Survival, where many people will kill others without warning. With survival being an option now and slap damage removed in the normal Adventure mode I think a lot of people who really want to fight others have gone over there. So if you play Survival you probably will find it more hostile, so maybe stay away from Survival until you feel your ready for that.  
---
Welcome to FO76, and have fun! If you ask around in game and places like here on Reddit you can find others who would be glad to play with you as well. FO76 does have it's flaws, but playing with others can be a lot of fun.
---
What??? Hell yea!
---
Its lagged with the queen from day one for me on xbox. I expect it always will.
---
I started a new character yesterday, and that bot was in the clearing across from the overseer's camp. 
---
You should read it every Tuesday and every Wednesday it shows whats gonna be in the atom shop for how long and whst it costs
---
That was the price without any perks played but even with them it doesn‚Äôt lower it that much. However I‚Äôve see it for 9200 caps also
---
5 star aint real yet
---
Oh wow.
---
That is awesome! Off to Camp Venture! You should make that an FYI post.

I think you can get them from the Vendor at superduper mart in watoga. I paid someone for them though.
---
Pretty sure you cannot go above 4 stars, and 4 stars are just 3 stars with special mods like Scorched Killer or Cultist Sacrificial Blade.
---
Hey. I‚Äôll buy it for 3000 caps. 
---
You must have the entire EX suit for the carry bonus to work.
---
Oh and do u have the healing salve recipe?
---
Leave screws, ballistic fiber, and 5.56 please.
---
There are a bunch more plan spawn locations in there, too many to list.  It's a trove of good stuff.  I always make sure to stop by at least once when doing my daily vendor run, as a stop between Harper's Ferry and Watoga vendors.
---
Meh people have alwase tried to find a end to manny of bethesda's games weather it be skyrim , elder scrolls online , or 76 but in hine sight there is no true ending as long as people continue to play.  Bethesda is one franchise that has created never-ending and limitless gaming that feeds on our imagination and thaughts
---
For sure feels like teeth getting  pulled 
---
Greenbrier Resort (and bunker) in White Sulphur Springs
---
That would finally make a good use for it aside from the water filter (has anyone EVER used that) or scraping it for wood.
---
Another good question 
---
If they DO stack is it direct or compound?
---
I'm in the same boat, I'm pretty much self sufficient now however I need to find a stable supply of lead.
---
you blaze your own trail in this game 
---
Lol I meant 3 star my bad
---
You did play the game. Whether you got it bundled or bought it individually, that doesn‚Äôt invalidate your criticism. Despite what your detractors might say. Especially on this sub where all the fanboys hate Youtubers because they didn‚Äôt give this game glowing praise. Lmao
---
By the way what‚Äôs your channel? I‚Äôm curious about it.
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm at work right now however I have roughly 700 hours clocked in, if you need any help I‚Äôll be available in 3 hours. Always down to help out newer players Psn:Welcometothefunk
---
What‚Äôs your offer on the clean suit? I literally just got one.
---
Im all for seasons in this game like poe or d3 but as it stands, this is just rubbish. The amount of tse users is way to discouraging to want to play. Also i highly highly doubt that the amount of these users obtained said weapons legit. So yes give us seasons please, because as it stands right now, its shit.
---
You won‚Äôt see the spawn until you pass the Whitesprings bus flipped on its side.  And this is after running past a group of super mutants/feral ghouls/scorched.  Often I‚Äôve either fought or run my way through only to encounter another group of super mutants/feral ghouls/scorched/frenzied robots/dogs etc...
---
Bethesda‚Äôs little inside joke at that spawn location.
---
Maybe it's not a bug.  Maybe it's Fallout 76's way of saying "Why you no use Calibrated Shocks?"
---
I disagree with you, the Savage Divide, Mire and Cranberry Bog are not designed for lower lvl players where as the Forest, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap are designed for them.  The higher level players causing higher levels spawns are only in areas where they belong, hence the right portion of the map. The lower level areas do not see level 40-68 enemies which is how it is designed.  The game wasn‚Äôt designed to fly through it and beat everything before you are level 50. Enjoy the wasteland and don‚Äôt rush through it because you will miss a lot of really cools things. 
---
Just my two cents... 
---
I play with a level 124 rifle build and I always give lower level players aid and gear I don‚Äôt need or have a need to sell and I know there are a lot of other players like me.  
---
It might be random. Mines in front of my house close the boundary.
---
Sweet where I located America or Australia? Just so I know when you'll be on in my time zone as I'm in Australia
---
BOS combat armor mod plans drop from scorched beast also. Rare. But they do drop. 
---
One possibility is to get some higher level friends to help you. Or make them. In some ways I think that's part of Bethesda's plan with this is to have people work together. 
---
Spawn raping.  :)
---
Getting spawn raped.  :(
---
Yea, it‚Äôs fun if you can escape the cycle of getting spawn raped.
---
Minimum levels still exist for some plans to appear.  But the max level cap has been removed (like the Handmade plans used to disappear for players above level 40 or so before the vendor update.)
---
This! Sometimes I‚Äôll take like 4-5 workshops and always try to gift them to a lowbie to give them materials and fast travel points when I log out. Unfortunately it also opens them up to pvp but I‚Äôve always found it to be worth the risk. 
---
Okay :)
---
I was afraid of that. Thanks for confirming 
---
Yeah, true. It looks like I'll just need to wait and quest elsewhere for now. 
---
Wixon Homestead. 
---
I just grabbed 5 bags that turned into 20 fertilizer.
---
I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve grabbed upwards of 9 bags at a time there though. 
---
It‚Äôs just south of Gilman Lumber on your way to flatwoods from vault 76.
---
They should be able to let us name power armor
---
So glad im not the only one that needed this
---
Shit is ass as fuck it‚Äôs just straight up spawn raping. 
---
Yeah I'd say you're right. It's mostly there to encourage grinding. 
---
Yeah. If you can get the marsupial mutation, it can really help you level up (namely that you can get out of the way of melee characters. 
---
Would be nice if they make a fast travel point that loads inside white springs instead of outside and having to run in. And if you log out while inside white springs, you should reload back inside white springs. 
---
Just make a new intro. It's only the overseer's comment that tells us we overslept. She could've decided to let some people out early, and then she left just before you. It made sense when the game first came out, but not now.
---
How much have you sold online for CASH?
---
it's 988th nuke  this week :P
---
Shit is fucking ass legit just spawn rapein
---
They could be like warframe Dojos, where each member can work towards something in it, adding decorations, adding workbenches, maybe doing quests to unlock special plans or even just donating materials and aid items for the guild to share.
---
Completely agreed. For those that don‚Äôt want to open themselves up for being killed but also want to do the atom challenges, this option is a must. It‚Äôs great that there‚Äôs technically a way to do it but hopping servers shouldn‚Äôt be mandatory. 
---
Oop you're right I forgot megaton was blown to shit yesterday
---
That's funny because I would say that this can be the worst community in online gaming
---
Imagine being like a level 10 with no caps right in the center of all of those
---
Each unyielding armor you wear will give you +3 of each stat except endurance. So 5 pieces will net you an additional +15 perception. 
---
They seemed to stack 
---
Good point 
---
They were pretty low. They either went for safety or fear! We had a good laugh about that!
---
I should be on tomorrow night. Hit me up. 
---
Well, FO3 and NV were gliched for me too, but not as reminding as 76. Not glitchy, actually. There are some BS going on, most of them are "OK", those we can live with for a little while, but the server part is really shitty. It can be a pain sometimes. The delay of loot being listed on bodies you killed in nuke zones was one the got tolerable now, but the social part still fail hard. Sometimes it shows a friend offline but he's playing, or it says he's at the main menu screen and no one can invite him not even going to the main menu. Sometimes it's a rubber band effect, like you going back in time on the server... But for the most part, it's Fallout, the good and the bad we are used to.
---
The server have been improved, like a lot now, the last PvP update actually fixed it more. The social aspect need some attention, it's clean. And the game shenanigans were also heavily fixed. There is still bugs in mission that make you get stuck, I had this problem, but the lastest update fixed it for me, all of the sudden the game activated/enabled the next mission from the quest.
---
I read that, laughed out loud and then everyone at Jiffy Lube looked at me funny. 
---
As long as I can put a mini deathclaw or gulper in it. This would be epic.
---
The UI shows them all at the same time, so I assume they all stack properly...
---
I‚Äôm glad to see Bethesda taking a little ownership of the issues. 
---
I‚Äôm over the moon happy with their plans for the future and incredibly excited about it as well. I look forward to years and years of stuff with the game. 
---
If I were them I would have been terrified
---
I have the exact same problem with almost the same hardware, only difference is I have a ryzen 5 2600. So it's not just you and dont get your hope up that it will ever get fixed, its been like this for month.
---
Long live the Enclave yeet
---
Thanks! I'll add it to my run now.
---
They are rare from vending machine, but they have a constant spawn point.
---
Really? Where's that??
---
By the way, the PvP mode is actually cool. I was really skeptical, actually, I was more like "wtf! why?", but I played it a little bit and I had a great time. It really make the game more tense, like something can actually kill you out of the blue. Make you play more careful. Like Ina survival, actually, games like DayZ or Rust, that feeling that you can lose everything if not careful. But you can only drop chems, caps and junk.
---
none. all I had was junk
---
I meant legendaries as a whole. I mentioned sentinel armour I'm the post, j was just using weapons as an example 
---
Flatwoods or Morgantown would be decent for Responders.
---
Not sure if they were paying attention. We did a 321 launch, so all 3 left simultaneously. Not many nuke there so if you didnt look at the map... oh boy. Pretty sure we wiped a camp or so as well. My apologies.
---
cool, you are the exception
---
The roof of the West Tek Research Center
---
Very true. As someone else suggested awhile ago, they should make every Scorchbeast a legendary by default. Or, at least give them a guaranteed rare drop of some kind. Right now you only get a rare drop occasionally and it's barely worth it to kill them.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôll have a play around and see what works 
---
Just curious, why use the .50 reciever? Last i checked the hardend .308 does more damage.
---
My problem isn't griefing. Like the OP, I have a problem with how Bethesda defines the top three, but for different reasons. 
---
I hunted down the #3 person on the list thinking it was going to be a challenging fight and that he would be a badass. 
---
Instead, he went down ridiculously easy and was fairly low level,  and his build was nowhere close to being ready for PVP. 
---
If you are hunting the guy in the top spot shouldn't it be, you know... challenging? 
---
On PS4 as well.  Can't hear him standing next to him.  I actually hear him louder from the main room before you open the nuka  cola machine.  
---
below 20% health
---
No kidding? Huh. Well, I guess my opinion on the matter has changed.
---
There's legendary armor with that perk 
---
Modus likes this.
---
Gazii on twitch is fun to watch. She‚Äôs very knowledgeable and plays within the limitations without complaining or bashing everything that could be different.
---
We should be able to build a hot tub that has a tarberry farm in it.
---
At this moment in lore we don‚Äôt know of your existence and in fact aren‚Äôt at war with you üëåüëå 
---
Because I have plenty of strength/perks to help with my carry weight and I like to diversify. :)
---
Just leave it alone from that point. Even after you fail a defense event and it gets overrun by mobs, it still serves as a free fast travel point.
---
Yea if that‚Äôs okay
---
I think it will get some balance. Most games like this when new always has balancing issues. I remember WOW going through the same thing. Hopefully Beth won‚Äôt fall into the same pitfalls though. 
---
It varies depending on your health. But max at 20% with +3. 
---
You just not have stashed them. You don't lose anything at all from your stash when dying in either mode.
---
I just found the prime receiver plans and now I dont want to give it up. Sorry my man
---
I'm going to go with you're just kicking that much ass more regularly.  
---
Still...only spawn in the world I know of and takes server hopping to farm.
---
&gt;all it needs is a passive zone when you enter inside
---
I think instead of a forced passive zone, just put a ton of high level deadly robots in it. Then set them to attack any player who engages in PVP.
---
This way, you can still start a fight with others, but there is a cost and a challenge to it.
---
Please add an ender box for our characters! 
---
I think, that if  a "Retake Workshop X" quest starts, you should have the option to ignore it and have the quest fail and mark the place as Abandoned/unowned so someone else can take it.
---
Depends on what the * are
---
I like to believe that this is part of the canonical story of 76
---
This post was meant to to address how duped weapons have ruined the game. I used PvP as an example as most pvper will run a TSE or bloodied sentinel build. I wasn't trying to focus on PvP entirely.
---
Your comment is pretty objective as you may have just gotten lucky. The point about PvP, is you shouldn't need god gear to be able to enjoy yourself. Im guessing you haven't ran into any of those builds if you found it easy. You can't fight a god build without one yourself 
---
Right lol!
---
You just need the materials to repair it. The overwhelming majority of people who stop by your camp will not harm it.  
---
The only time my camp got destroyed it was by your typical bloodied build griefer, who was luring people to come back to their camps to defend them, and then killing them in one shot with some TSE rifle. 
---
Since then I‚Äôve decided that if I get the notification that my camp is under attack, I‚Äôd just server hop. It hasn‚Äôt happened since that, though. 
---
I think 5 or 6 consecutive hits caps the bonus. I've read 6 and 15% increase per hit. My Furious death tambo is my go to for melee without PA. 
---
Lol aight, will do
---
You guys are ruthless
---
I'll be your friend.  Ps4?
---
uk :)
---
I found the machete first
---
I‚Äôll check her out, thanks
---
If one of the reasons a person is playing a game is because they are new then that's a good sign for the game. Which is all the more reason why the issue should be sorted. This comment reads as yet another attempt to degrade 76 for those who actually enjoy it.
---
I've only ever gotten one out of the machines, and I try them every time I see one. I mean, how can you come across a Port-O-Diner and *not* at least give it a try? I saved the one I got in my stash box as a worthless trophy, of sorts.
---
I never understand these questions ..everyone has different perspectives..not sure how that will affect how you would feel about a game you already experienced
---
I kinda just want to the planters we had back in Fallout 4 so I can put my garden on a platform instead of having to search for a perfect spot everytime I move my camp. 
---
yes
---
That's what happened to me! Now I get it. I was getting cap farm murdered over and at a workshop and couldn't get out of death loop cap stealing cycle. Dying before I could use the controls.  Must have been a defend workshop event going on. Had to hard reset the PC to stop getting robbed further.
---
Been playing daily since Beta... 10 pies to show for my trouble and 2 came from the roof.
---
The issue with this, is that if the game got to a point where you could not dupe anymore, and duped items were still everywhere. I personally think most people would be ok with Bethesda removing all of them. Even if it meant losing your weapons and armour, if it was for the good of the game. 
---
When you have 25 man servers and you never join the same server with the same people that means there isnt a community to begin with.  
---
That's pretty impressive.
---
Ive been grinding 10-20 events a day for the past 2 months and not a single rare costume drop. 
---
If you're on PS4 and need help, I'll help you transfer items.
---
If you don't trust me, at the very least you can add me as a friend, lemme know you wanna transfer items, and you can just use me to anchor you to a server so that you can use a world container to transfer your items between characters.
---
I say every single item has a 300% price swing.
---
The swing on this would be something like 500 caps to 1500 caps.
---
Do you have any mods? Deactivate all of them and see if it helps.
---
I am still trying to find the the house with the complete plane parked in front of it.
---
Well done. 
---
I‚Äôm amazed the server survived.
---
Why would i go throw the whole trouble of making this post if i wasnt sure i had stash em my dude?
---
I buy ballistic fiber bulk from vendors or ammo vending machines. Farming for it is a joke
---
Yes i am on ps4 Bouncer-Wolf is my psn
---
But I like being able to carry around 10x what I can hold in my stash... heh.
---
I'm not home right now but I'm playing later on tonight, I can trade you 1000 for your 700. 
---

Standard 50cal receiver does the same amount of damage as the hardened 308.
---
Refined 50cal receiver deals 2 points of damage less than the 308.
---
Hardened 308: https://i.imgur.com/zU5Zimk.png

---
And yeah, it makes no sense.
---
Ok I‚Äôm up for that
---
I just want garden plots, and more plants available in the  C.A.M.P area. Make the rare ones worth more budget. I'm just tired of looking for slit beans!?!
---
Yes i am and thank you!
---
You doo realize there are multiple servers right?
---
I‚Äôm in the uk so what time is that about a
---
Yes indeed my psn is in comments thank you
---
You can't find a way to farm steel?
---
Yeah but I find that it's more a novelty for me when I can already carry enough to make multiple runs without having to hit a workbench or stash.   Definitely useful though.
---
I have:
---
2* unyielding BOS combat armor left arm with +25 rad resistance, level 50
---
2*unyielding BOS combat armor right leg with +1 intelligence, level 50
---
2* unyielding welded raider left leg with +1 charisma, level 45
---
I'd sell them for 2500 a piece or 7000 for all 3. 
---
Okay adding you now, I'm justseeker623
---
A bobble head display stand. PA displays. Weapon display racks and armor maniquins. Are all things I‚Äôd like to see what‚Äôs the point of grinding for all this great gear if you can‚Äôt show it off 
---
"Don't put your base there because I want my special outfit and I don't want to server hop"
---
Yea, nothing dickish about that lol
---
Awesome thank you again!
---
Do you play modded? I know that the changes to the .ini don't okay well with their updates, and this seems to usually be the result. It might just be that this last patch want as dramatic of an update, so you don't fall through as much. 
---
The exact same thing happened to me but with T51, all but the helmet and I didn't even buy it.
---
Why would you store 190 stimpaks at 1 lb a piece in your Stash...  That's almost 25% of your whole stash...
---
Don't PvP with rando's. Make friends who aren't pieces of shit and play with them.
---
Not sure why you‚Äôre being downvoted. It **is** unfortunate any time that we have to quit/server hop, but currently it‚Äôs the only solution. I‚Äôm sure the devs are aware and will implement a fix before too long. 
---
I think I saw it in one of Oxhorn‚Äôs streams during the bos questline so possibly.  
---
I'm in California,  I'll send you a friend request on the ps4. 
---
I'm gonna admit, my first thoughts when I first heard of the fissure sites weren't even "What happens if we seal 'em all up?", it was more along the lines of "How fast can I club this assaultron to death with a rocket powered aluminum baseball bat?"
---
No problem. This has been a feature people have been begging for since the start, unfortunately it hasn't become possible so it's up to the community to help out
---
Ok. See you then.
---
Cause normally i carry em with me since the traveling farmacy perk makes em almost weightless, i stored em cause i was on survival i didnt wanna lose all of em
---
I've found you can also just quit and come back if you dont want to respawn at a station. Helps if I'm exploring. 
---
That‚Äôs ok. What were you hoping to get for your submachine gun?
---
Got you I'm glad I'm not the only one who has asked for it lol
---
Agree with the sentiment cranberry bog and parts of the Savage divide are going to spawn higher level stuff. I didn't go to watoga until I was lvl 70. Now it's a cruise at 140 but level 70 and below is a nightmare for the higher level areas.
---
Everything degrades faster
---
good to know thank you
---
I would be careful with painting stuff with stuff you haven't unlocked.  It would suck to have that armor disappear because you had it painted with a pattern you didn't own. 
---
How much ballistic fiber for a recipe?
---
Don‚Äôt tell me what to do.
---
What system?
---
300
---
Same. IMO, if you're nowhere near the workshop, the PvP shouldn't be active. 
---
With Super Duper, ammo scrounger and Ammosmith, I can make and find a ton more ammo than a workshop would make for me in the same time limit.  By the time I've run out of mats, I've got enough ammo anyways and the next time I run out out ammo, I already have the mats to make more ammo.
---
the free states cannot stand for such imperialism
---
I too carry almost 270 on me with traveling pharmacy.
---
I'd _never_ be able to fit them in my Stash.  I am curious _how_ you were able to, given how much they weigh (traveling pharmacy doesn't apply to Stash) and maybe you thought you stashed them but they couldn't fit.
---
Let me log in and see what I got. 
---
And the fight continued on...
---
Xbox.
---
Survival is about mobile camps that you move often depending what you are doing and where you are. It‚Äôs your respawn point. Shouldn‚Äôt be static. 
---
Gt?
---
K but i just got off and can't get on until later
---
I'll pm you and message my gt u1smoothOpr8r 
---
What's your gt?
