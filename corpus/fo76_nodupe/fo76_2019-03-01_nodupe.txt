Your post reminds me that I should test medium speed weapons DPS as well. I really wish I could get some solid numbers to work with. I have seen people boast 2000-4000 damage so I was thinking of comparing critical sneak guns to that.

Aside from your initial sprinting attack, assuming you are fighting something that doesn't not out right die on first hit, are your consecutive attacks just regular button presses? Do melee users typically use regular attacks out of vats or always heavy attacks?

Field surgeon allows you to recieve all of the sim pack healing immediately and if they have auto stim plus first aid 3 easily could heal up to fil every 20 seconds.

Aren't we all Fallout 76 players?

---
No, they removed a number of the spawns completely, especially around Whitespring.
---
Change ur rez. Some TVs can’t cope with the high Rez on Fo76 so they lower it
---
Nope. I have had it were I spawn in and by the time I get control I've been attacked by enemies. 
---
Yeah it seemed unnatural. I did a lot of basebuilding in FO4, and no-clip was essential. Obviously an online game is different, but this is handy to know!
---
Can you link me to that exact quote? And the product from Jones cola? 
---
I see Nuka Quantum from Jones..... In a regular Jones bottle.
---
&gt;they don't seem willing to broadcast/admit that they've made a mistake and keep it hush-hush as possible
---
Sound like the behaviour of government.
---
Ay I don't listen to classical any other time apart from while playing fallout games , I enjoy it , but you are right in this one it feels like 2-3 songs repeated 
---
You are Not understanding the words I’m typing.
---
It takes 2 ppl to PvP or fight 
---
IF a person leaves the workshop area but still gets chased around the map by an asshat,  it’s not PvP it’s a dick griefer move.
---
In real life applications it’s  called  bullying. 
---
That coat alone would be worth joining the BOS in this game. 
---
Pros
---
-Great game beyond the apparent bugs and glitches
---
Cons
---
-Everyone except people on this sub will hate u for some reason
---
&gt; I had thought this would have been fixed by now.
---
Maybe the code is very complex or it is on the back burner, something for later.
---
Ahthat makes sense I didn't realize that haha.
---
Like it was said elsewhere, tag it for search.  You'd be surprised how much stuff it's in.  I now collect scissors and billiard balls religiously.
---
No.
---
Yes
---
Who's loading the damn things anyway, they are chunking away when I get to the event with nobody else there. Brakes the immersion for me, just feels silly.
---
Only in specific cases because just buffing everything is how you lead to power creep.  GTA Online is a great example of unrestricted power creep allowed to happen without worry or care. 
---
Aye..am tagging now. Thanks
---
&gt;Id much rather have my friendly turrets defending a rabbit hutch or a Brahmin pen
---
Great idea, maybe just a dream but I'll dream right along side you :)
---
Nah it is a decent system to help deal with the high over flow of weapons that can be farmed from mobs. With rarer weapons requiring more work to make more powerful. And opens up the community market for creation and modification for sale. 
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
You do bring a fair point but it has worked in almost every game that is online and rember not every report has to be acted on. Reports would need to be investigated first like all other reports in other online games

Missles and nukes need a buff. Energy weapons yes but not as much as missles and nukes.

There are two kinds of people in the world, the ones without explosive revolvers, and the ones that make the rules.

I just happened to play this event for the first time since the game started out in BETA.  It was somewhat entertaining if not a offshoot of the Monster Mash event giving the player tokens instead of candy.  Anyone know what the “big haul” item is if you have the right number of tokens?
---
When I'm on party chat my with friend I still hear area chat from other players.
---
You beat me to it lol
---
The wasteland is dead... Long live the wasteland O.o
---
I don't do it myself and I hate griefing but it's apart of the game. Not really a reportable or bannable offence. First of all it's quite easy to run away or fast travel (couple caps) or for free switch server. As for camp if you move it everything is repaired, costs a few caps yes but better than if you can't afford the resources to repair. People will be dicks, if can't afford the caps spend 10 mins scavenging you'll rebuild. 
---
(The extremely reduced damage if you don't hit/shoot them back helps alot, if someone's shooting, just run away. If you hit back your fucked lol)
---
People still play rust though and the developers are active. Fallout 76 is just wilting away like it never happened. So they're running out of time to make a move here. People came back and said NMS is actually really really good now. But if you check steam charts at the time of the big release that made everyone happy a year after that massive fail.. you'll see that there were still only a few thousand people online. Whos going to be online to see fallout "possibly" get fixed. They're only adding a few quests. It was nearly impossible to convince me friends to play with me the first time. No way in hell they're getting back on ever ever ever again
---
I would like to point out they have a constant debuff of 1.5 pounds of weight until you use them. 
---
Clearly I have no idea how that industry works.  Although reading your link I'm not sure if it means I was right and it does work that way and artists are bitter about it or that it doesn't work that way but lots of people want content for free and try to take advantage all the time.  To clarify my position, I'd like new music in a way that is a win/win for Bethesda and the artists.
---
I had the same problem 
---
Survival mode for you, adventure mode for us that want PvE only.  Is that so hard for people like you to understand?  And yes we do get to have a say on what sort of experience we want for a multiplayer game as paying customers of Bethesda.  Some of us just want coop PvE and we're just asking for our own game mode.
---
Haha that’s awesome. Player oven and now flying trap. What will people come up with next
---
Make the wasteland... wastelandier, again?
---
Server hoping doesn't work for me any more, I always get placed back into the previous server, same players.
---
I started alone, then my friends noticed how much I was playing so they all bought it, then I had 5 friends to play with. After just 2 weeks they all quit and I’m alone again
---
Why take the risk.  Better yet make copies of your favourite PA and make a statue of it. Wood, stone and metal.  
---
More tattoos, hair and everything in between 
---
It would make sense or carry armor, weapons, and other things on your person in Excavator while farming to minimize what you lose if you die. There are a few important considerations here that nobody has mentioned:
---
(1) there is a bug that happens if you have more than one normal pieces of armor per slot in your inventory that causes PA parts to become unequipped on login or fast travel. This is a real pain and makes it much more difficult to carry extra armor.
---
(2) there is a bug that happens if you have more than one of the same type of weapon in your inventory that makes it so that your favorites wheel and hotkeys get confused about which one to use, and often it will bring up the wrong weapon
---
(3) stashing a "reserve" of junk so you aren't SoL if you die and lose your junk is typical. Carrying the rest and getting the benefit of the 75% weight reduction of pack rat that you don't get in your stash enables you to carry enough stuff to make all your daily vendor visits in one long, cost effective run.
---
(4) for players that specialize in high-end crafting, we need LOTS of materials, especially stable Flux, of which there are 5 types and they weight 1 pound each in stash. That eats a tremendous amount of your stash space. In order to have room to store the occasionally dropped 2-3* legendary armor and weapons in your stash, plus flux and a minimal reserve of junk, you end up carrying your surprise junk on you. And that usually requires excavator armor with calibrated shocks. Even the 800 pound stash weight is barely enough for a high-end crafter / trader with a small inventory of legendaries to sell. To get around / "game" the artificial stash limit, almost all high-end crafter / trader players use mule characters, either or both on the same account or by boxing two accounts at once.  For those players that don't "game" the system with mules, you really don't have much of a choice but to always carry some junk on you.
---
They key here as you pointed out is to just never bother with workshops if you are in this scenario. I don't bother with them anymore, and I always keep my health bar high to prevent being slapped to death by high speed weapons. If a player does take a workshop that is loaded with junk, they are either uninformed / unaware that this can open you up to be PKed anywhere on the map,, or choosing to take a calculated risk.
---
Im not just saying griefing I'm also saying hackers and cheaters ive dealt with griefers and cheaters but it ruins the game when a level 30 wants trade and they have 489473 .308 ammo or 489295 bobble heads 
---
Braxeons quality medical supplies has them to. It's near Raleigh Clay's bunker near the edge of the map
---
I just want a nuka cola recipe now, to make my own cola to either drink alone or make into nukashine
---
That sounds absolutely awful, tbh I had a huge griefer moment on my original character and it basically made me stay away from Workshops for a good while because I was afraid of being griefed and "One-slap killed" again.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Dunno if Bethesda ever did anything about those griefers because they said they couldn't do anything about it without evidence but like I had no way to know they were gonna kill me without even taking my workshop(only took it after slap killing me).
---
Tbh I only took like one Workshop one time from a level 8 because I **REALLY** needed the cores. Felt bad about it but I had the generator plans to actually power the place up on the spot. Kept trying to fight my missile launchers.
---
Otherwise I don't take workshops from people, though I do take most of them purely for plans and defend events rather than using them for materials.
---
\---
---
God, I remember literally starting this character like a week ago and got shit on at my camp since it was at the junk pile right next to Gorge. Literally came right to me just to shoot me in the head.
---
I also don't know how to feel about them including the ability to steal workshops away from the bench itself, I think it should be limited to unclaimed workshops that you can hold down the build button and take it tbh.
---
I suspect a lot of the resistance I've seen to removing PvP from adventure mode comes for the fact that there's a small segment out there just looking for easy kills/ganking/griefing for lulz and they are afraid of actual hardcore PvP.
---
I want both junky rifle and shotgun, what lowest you can go? i have 400 cap
---
With full unyielding i can get 3.2k off a bloodied power fist
---
I used to constantly run out of fusion cores, but after I took the perk card that makes them drain slower, I haven’t had to farm in over 3 weeks and just pick one up here and there when I’m exploring. I only have the card at level one also, so make room for it if you can. It really helps.
---
Thank you
---
tried it about a month ago and got to last step and game crashed.
---
Sent me back to the start of the quest aaaaaahhhh fuck the DMV.
---
i havent gone back since, one day ill go finish it 
---
Right right.  Not talking about the damage output, rather the damage resist . Is having the sentinel effect worth it ?
---
&gt;wastelandier
---
One of my favourite pieces by Sibelius.
---
Really useful in pvp. Hard 2 die unless i come up 2 someone with equally good armour/weps
---
I love the music that plays when you fight a scorchbeast, it’s sort of a remake of the main menu music (that I love so much)
---
It increases all of your stats, which increases your melee damage with strength. It also allows for max caps from selling to vendors, and max AP with agi. It's probably the best legendary modifier until they nerf it
---
How do you do against level 28 missile turrets with your sword? I'm just curious. I'd imagine you could snipe some of them but idk.
---
I should have worded my post better. I meant mainly the sentinel effect on unyielding armor. Is that worth it 
---
Ahhh XBox needs to play with PSN! Wheeeeee!
---
Stop saying there is no player hub. Walk into the Whitesprings resort, set up behind an empty counter. the one room has multiple of each crafting bench for fucks sake.   
---
Y'all got that brainfungus.
---
I’d like to pick my mutations instead of the random method I’ve used. How do I reach you
---
Part of the fun for me is the gathering and crafting, so I usually do not fool with pre-packaged food.  But that is an alternative!
---
To be honest id like more of literally anything new but hair has my attention. I like fashion too much in these kinda games.
---
Pics coming soon?
---
shotgun sold but lever action now,can sell that for 400 caps 
---
I had a guy trying to take my workshop, so as he hid, I repaired the turrets he had shot. He got mad and said he was going to report me. I laughed.... I have no idea what he thought he would report me for. We'll get a lot of this if there is an actual reporting system. A bit like, Mom, he won't let me win. 
---
Well, if all five pieces have Sentinel's then that's -75% damage while standing still. Pretty large damage resist. you can stand and kill ghouls all day with the the blocker perk also equipped
---
fuck, how about 300? im still trying to learn the game lol 
---
the first time that happened, I was surprised. I told my friends it was just like being back home. They went the extra mile with some of these little details like that one.
---
Not many people like working for free, and those songs should be 'lore friendly', and afaik not many people make songs that fit Fallout (30's-40's pop). So that means they would have to be written, performed and later edited. That aint cheap chief
---
That's why I live in the mire - all the creepy crawlies are delicious (and drop good loot)!

Right i suppose that is true! I just see people offering max caps for it. And to me it seems nuts. I have a friend who has an unyielding sentinel set and one vats crit takes him out . So why spend so much on an effect that still let's you be one shot. 
---
Perfect for my alcoholic firebreather character.
---
Still not what I mean yes there are people like that but theres a line between being stronger and taking a workshop and walkimg in oneshotting a low level player who owns it and killing them until they have no caps and then claiming the workshop 
---
Multiple times and it will drain your AP almost instantly even with 40ish agility from unyielding. With the ripper, buzz, drill, chainsaw you want to use your plain old normal attacks for highest DPS. For everything else vats should just be a gap close and ap should be used for power attacks instead for max DPS.  For melee that's not buzz or ect. Sneak&gt;pwr attack&gt;vats crit&gt;normal. In all instances where you can sneak and pwr or sneak and crit you should.
---
deal,will add you after i done scorch beast queen,will take 15 minutes i think

All good, it's just that some only see a nice water hole, and don't even realize the consequences of building there.

start up fallout, get a notification that states it could not find my latest save data. keep trying and trying again. now it is just stuck at an infinite loading bar "syncing data for fallout76"
---
True but in their defense Bethesda never willingly describes what the game should be and their intentions as a developer.  PvP tends to mean something different depending who you say it to.  There's a strong argument to be made that the game is far more similar to something like Rust than it is to games with segregated PvP or opt-in PvP, although I personally don't prefer the Rust type.
---
I haven't noticed any lvl 3 toolboxes but I probably opened some and just don't remember them. 
---
In regards to different containers I think there is a difference in terms of loot tables. One of the items on the list is a green footlocker that I haven't seen anything of value in. I will keep it there for now and if it shows no promise after a few more tries I will remove it.
---
Thank you all this is awsome!!!
---
Oh probably not, I have no idea how to do that. lol
---
Also it seems to be always dark.  
---
Wait the robots inside the resort wont attack?
---
That could be the case, or it **can't** be fixed.  I feel like they don't care much about balance in general or things properly working.  When I was testing perks a disturbing number of them either flat out didn't work, did very very little, or performed their function in a round-about way (for example, field surgeon increases your inward healing speed, not your outward healing speed, so it makes you a better tank but not a better healer, contradictory to how it's worded).
---
Ok, I am just a noob in F76. I somewhat liked micromanagement of previous Fallouts, but this is extreme. Hungers, thirst, spoiling food - do you guys enjoy this? I don't know, I feel like the game is Fallout, but not for every Fallout fan out there. I don't have a firm opinion about this game yet, but sadly I'm not amused.
---
There is a way to report. Through Bethesda's support page.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
Not in my experience, hasnt happened yet. Unsure if it's just a glitch but it's been consistent
---
After not having a custom.ini for a while and remaking it a couple days ago, I started experiencing seriously long load times and lag in places I just had no trouble. Smooth experience on my old rig without the custom ini that is no longer needed.
---
But how about in-game?
---
The problem isn't necessarily griefers playing as raiders. 
---
The problem is when they can abuse game systems to be untouchable and leave little to no way to fight back without those same systems creating severe penalties.
---
Also, if you killed a  raider previously, they couldn't respawn and indefinitely eat away at your resources until you had nothing left to defend yourself with. That's a part of being a griefer and not part of role playing a raider.
---
Don't get me wrong, being a raider should be an option but it's been implemented horribly to prevent legitimate griefing. 
---
I love it but my friend moved recently and claims he doesn't have decent connection anymore. So I'm kind of taking a break but occasionally get on to do some solo time.
---
I have, however, been keeping my Fallout drive alive by going back to Fallout 4.
---
Hey I just got to level 100 and I'm taking a break want me to give you some free stuff
---
Part of me feels like we should have a Mire neighborhood association and have block parties and stuff.
---
This is what I thought the Brahmin pen was going to be when I unlocked it and I was sadly disappointed 
---
Errr. Loaded it up and server connection time out. They really need to revamp the PC menu and not make it obvious they don’t care about the PC. 
---
Doesn't that mean there is a sixth rule though, but the rule is that there isn't a sixth which means there is but that there's not a sixth rule so there must be one but that means there isn't...... 
---
Sure bud! I take some stuff. I hope you can hope back on so we can play some stuff
---
Which you know it will break - much sooner than intended 
---
Energy weapons should be the “go to” but are basically junk in this game 
---
Thanks Bethesda.  You’d rather inflict more damage with a legendary rolling pin than a badass looking Gatling Laser. 
---
Man I wish I knew that before lol, last time I pissed off the staff was during a nuke zone and I ended up switching servers.
---
What's your gt ill text you and give you some stuff
---
Underrated how?  Like in terms of complete and utter disappointment?  
---
Oh hell! Heads up that if you go back outside, they will still be pissed
---
&gt;Where would someone start then?
---
At less active subs. It's a reasonable request.
---
Sounds like people need to stop nuking the same spot thinking its the best when its all they've had.
---
Thank gawd (not Todd), finally!!!
---
&gt;The spawning in adds is not a bug. 
---
Have you compared the rate it spawns vs. other leaders? I'm not even sure I've seen other leaders to do that at all. While this one spawns them, if you are fast enough to kill them, two times a minute.
---
lol You must not have played ANY survival games in the past decade.  None of them tell you jack.
---
I think they need to release M00by to the wild!
---
Unfortunately it's probably going to be Whitesprings.
---
90% of the player base doesn't visit reddit, so it'll be like trying to herd deaf cats.
---
Good luck finding land there, everyone is going to be setting up Camp Vending Machines.
---
Server hop 10 times, only to find out your camp spot is taken on 10 different servers.
---
I sure WISH they would've just made the terminals indestructible and all in one central location that's a no-build zone.........you'd get a LOT more trading done with a LOT less frustration!
---
Where ever the story marker takes you
---
Oh i agree its not good for the in game economy, i dobt recommend a game work like this, im just saying i personally do like the feel but completely understand why others dont. Thats why i started with unpopular opinion. 
---
So yes, i agree.
---
And to your last part yeah but actual wasteland would suck ass to live in id rather play the hollywood style atm. But thats just me :)
---
Well the problem is the other unarmed weapons are lower base level, and your base weapon delve damage is *extremely* important due to unarmed getting a crazy high damage % via stacking strength, mutations, perks, etc.
---
  
---
Vats is only really useful for the first initial hit to bridge the distance.  It's more about the gap closer.  I can barely discern the damage difference of a crit and a regular hit, due to the crit formula not multiplying total damage but it's kind of on its own half of the equation.  I've also found that VATS is generally bad because it unnecessarily drains stamina, can't power attack, and enemies can and will side/back step you and take no damage despite the vats teleport although this happens less as you get more attack speed but it still happens.
---
You also want to cancel sprint when you get to a target or it will keep draining AP.  It's semi rare something doesn't die from a sprint attack or sprint attack + normal followup attack but you can kinda do a short sprint-&gt;normal-&gt;short sprint-&gt;normal etc or maybe sprint-&gt;normal-&gt;normal depending on swing speed? I think there's a slight delay on when you can resprint not 100% sure and I think you need to toggle off the old sprint to do it.
---
I feel like the numbers for melee aren't really that indicative of the end damage, as power attacks are a total 1.5 multiplier which is something guns can't get and I think some things don't get calculated into the pipboy display for melee or it could be that I was just really buggy.   Like guns can get crit, but crit and damage aren't multiplicative off each other but additive, whereas damage and power attack modifier *are* multiplicative.   I also think, due to higher base values on weapons, unarmed tends to hit much harder than regular melee, but can't use power armor, feels like a good trade-off imo.
---
Yeah but i want it in fallout :)
---
Launchers as well.
---
Private servers would allow the community to solve just about everything and for us to pay for our own server over-heads and/or run less populated servers so we can do things like increase weather frequency without having a large impact on the game.  This game never should have been open-world BGS run servers.
---
True, and hazy. Hard to get a good shot. Either way its always nice to meet the neighbors. I'm a smidge south of you in lake. Just off shore from the mall. Cheers
---
Lols im kinda hoping thats what the pvp version is but idk i havent read up on it at all
---
Because his room has utility as well as the vendor himself.
---
That's the beauty of moddable private servers though, it doesn't matter what they think.  Their bad design decisions can be kept to themselves and we can do whatever is needed to fix the game, like an alternate perk system.  To be fair Fallout 1&amp;2 are completely different games (and basically one game, FO1 is insanely short and more of an introduction to FO2 than anything) made in a different era by a different studio.
---
That's ingenious!
---
excuse my hyperbole, but this aint that
---
Yay holo tapes and robots wooo
---
Yes - but since their only revenue source is the atom store, it will never happen. 
---
yes i do.
---
That happens if you click start very soon after the button appears.
---
I trade junk on there from time to time :)
---
A hair that doesn’t get eaten by ones hat would be nice.
---
Because of the pre-existing assets and relatively fast release date, this was probably planned prior to launch.
---
That would be fine by me. A static statue of the PA sets I've had, in the paint jobs I had them in, (since we can't apply them universally across all sets). 
---
Crafting.
---
When you craft a Core, it'll be at 100% plus your Intelligence -1.
---
So Crafting with 10 Intelligence gets you a Core with 109% charge.
---
Someone crafted it from Flux and had 9 intelligence
---
**This is Developer Vision.**
---
It's a dirty word in the gaming industry.
---
I'll give you the definition:
---
Developer Vision = Create whatever the developers want, and ignore the communities' priorities.  AKA you asked for X, but we decided to work on totally different Y instead.
---
I too have seen ZERO posts about brewing.   I'm sure someone can dig 1 or 2 out of the scrap heap somewhere, but this was NOT something the community asked for repeatedly.
---
Basically everything that needs dirt casts a ray down till it hits something so you can position crops to be on the edge of a platform while placing them (easiest with tatos if you just wanted to try) then after placing them you can put the other half floor down to have them flush
---
Is it winter? There' no snow. Even at the Top of The World where there would be. Never noticed the in-game date.
---
Unyielding Sentinel isn't best for PvP, that's Assassin's Sentinel. You can one-shot a player without Unyielding in a bloody build, so Assassin's will be preferable soon
---
I like it. 
---
No, Bethesda never did anything.  Just look through this sub and see all the frustrated players venting about this exact scenario.  
---
Then look at the comments from people who tell them it’s their fault for playing the game and they should git gud noob. 
---
Can confirm, was bait for my team a TON before my ideal build finally worked itself out. But that's ok, if my sacrifice to the team meant drawing out the buttholes attacking us then at least it was it was for the greater good! 
---
Thanks!

i'm kind of in the opposite boat. Big fallout fan, played 'em all (including tactics, which imo was actually a good game). had 3 friends who were super excited before release. I had no confidence, bethesda had no multiplayer experience, and the usual bugs and missing content for the first year or so after release won't fly in a MMO (a genre I don't like anyway). I finally caved to the hype and bought the beta, was shocked that it worked at all (after the day one redownload issue). Have had tons of fun, tons of frustration, hopeful for  the future of this game but I'm absolutely dead set that, in its current state, this is a niche product which only appeals to SOME fallout fans amd SOME general audience gamers. Of the 3 friends who were hyped before release, only of 'em stuck it out with me and still plays. I'm around level 80 now and enjoy the game, bugs and all, but would never try to convince someone to subject themselves to a garbage collecting and water boiling simulator if they're not already interested.
---
Good to know! Thanks for the tips!
---
I’ll add you when I’m on. Thanks!
---
Most people cluster them together, so it's one or two quick swings for each and they're all down. If someone spreads them out, like at a workshop, they are more annoying, but still underpowered. Definitely doesn't feel like you're getting hit by a missile. The one caveat could be that when you have already aggroed turrets and have to re-approach from a distance it gets a bit harder.
---
Reddit - "we need more things that are not at whitesprings"
---
Also Reddit - "Can I have my cap stash back at whitesprings plz"

I have an abundance of screws, just grab every office fan and typewriter you come across! It adds up eventually! 
---
Yes. Reason i dont wear hats.
---
cool where is this

"Appalachia or bust"
---
Wow, you are a great tactician! 
---
I think that would be alright if it drained AP.
---
Similar to how Stealth Boy works in Power Armor.
---
I always found Chameleon Mutation to be a huge drawback instead of a benefit.
---
1 piece of chameleon armor VS 1 whole SET of weightless armor

I think I hurt myself laughing at you all not at the mistake but at the comments as I did this myself not as bad I didn't spend all my Atoms just got something I was just meaning to look at.

Um no. If I were them, I wouldn't put one in-game.  It's too easy to just hit the button when just mad about something. They have a channel set up at their support link. It's easy to use. If a person really wants to report someone, the means are right there.
---
Looks a lot more like Zangief than Maxon. Amazing job!
---
You may not know this, but you can't build inside buildings lol
---
Yeah FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar are good places to trade.
---
I prefer Market because it has a Karma system, more players, and more active mods.
---
Same!
---
This is the thing that bothers me. 
---
People saying,  "hurr durr I'm role playing as a raider blah blah."
---
I have never seen  raider running around the wasteland in another game with balls-to-the-wall equipment like X0-1 armor or the ability to one shot the player without something like a Fatman.
---
They've always( the are everyone to this but very few)  run around in RAIDER power armor or no PA. Leather armor,  pipe pistols and crap melee.
---
They are meant to be lower level and overall weaker than the player character to try and fail as antagonists (except Nuka World).
---
"Hurr durr I'm a raider. "
---
No you're not,  you're a min-maxing player that's justifying your douchebaggery by SAYING you're a raider.  
---
Thank you!
---
That's good, so good it makes me wanna put a bullet in you.
---
Just wait until Player Vending at your Camp comes in.
---
You think people are douches now.  Try 10 server hops to make sure your camp location is open "somewhere" around Whitesprings.
---
People are going to go nuts griefing bases there......lol
---
How does trading actually work? 
---
Take me back to the fallout 2 days in New Reno. 
---
The fact that the original Country Roads wasn't chosen over the cover they used was a travesty. The original is damn near the state anthem. 
---
Personally I would love more pvp. However it’s pointless unless you and the other guy are similar levels.
---
With perks I have 500+ ballistic and energy resist in my Unyielding combat armor - that's practically Power Armor numbers. I don't run full Sentinel, since it's boring AF - 2x Sentinel, 3x Aid weight, cuz I carry ALOT of chems. In PvE I run at 40-50% health and 1-shot almost anything besides high level Gutsys with my Power Fist, and I'm not interested in PvP whatsoever in this game.
---
It does let you stop the contest of the workshop. It looks like you did stop it once during the claim part but the second time, it bugged or something. At least you got all the stuff out. I hope that's not by design cause too easy to grief.
---
I've only had a guy stop the contest once on me, not the second time. It's kind of useless to contest anyway, there's no camp plan.
---
I would.  I want the supplies.
---
I like visiting other people's camp. The chance of walking into one is too small... I also like to show my camp to visitors. But people don't stumble over at my camp very often. 
---
Bethesda should give us the option to put our camp visible on the map.
---
It looks great, really. But I've got a couple of tweaks for you to implement. This can make a huge difference in how a character looks, rotate the eyes to be slanted like his JUST a bit, and the brow is brought down so it kinda accentuates the slant of his eye. The brow difference is super subtle, so I wouldn't worry. His mouth is a whisker wider than it should be. Ears should be rotated in a tiny bit and not stick out to the sides as much.
---
Otherwise, it's damn near flawless. I've been working on Nate for a while and it just looks off.

Why not 150 tho?

Yeah, let's have them hire Word Police!

Then we can throw all the bad word people in JAIL!

That is the heart of the reason I am doing these calculations right now. Most people look at the damage in the pipboy for melee and guns and do not think about all the calculations and bonuses you can get in the background. I do feel, however, that melee wears the majority of its potential damage output on its sleeve whereas most of ranged damage is being calculated in the background.
---
The Fallout 4 formula, which I am using, calls pipboy damage Paper damage. Base damage is essentially an extra hit you get which is based on the damage you have before any bonuses from perks and other buffs. Base damage is what is used for critical calculations. Paper is for sneak attacks and headshots (or so I believe). 
---
Now, melee and ranged use a similar formula for criticals and sneak attacks but there is one thing guns can do which melee cannot take advantage. If you activate a critical using an automatic weapon, every consecutive shot is counted as a critical hit granted you do not let off of the fire button. This is apparent in the 100% accuracy bonus you get during a critical hit. Personally, I am getting 12 critical hits off before I run out of AP. Combine that with sneak attacks and headshots and you get a disgusting amount of damage over time. That 53 damage my pipboy says is not at all indicative of total potential damage output. This is why I am working on this little article.
---
Hey I got the game at launch and enjoyed but soon got distracted by other games my first impression was there wasn’t much to do but I really enjoyed the world. What I’m getting at is could you elaborate on what there is to do? I’ve been thinking of picking it back up.
---
A few times
---
Good work team!
---
What do you mean by ingame music? Classical radio?
---
Was this inpired by the corpses at Johnson's Acre? 
---
Yep. These whiny babies are griefing me on these forums all the goddamn time.
---
Ohh that could theoretically do some disgusting DPS if you combine sneak attacks and criticals. Every buzzblade hit should be counted as sneak criticals.
---
Field surgeon speeds it up, but it's not instant. It's also not what he's talking about. I've seen it too, where they're health bar is depleted continually by an automatic weapon but they never die and spring right back to full health. 
---
My guess is it's either    
---
A) a bug where the actual health damage against a sent/ass wearing player or someone with some buffs that aren't being displayed right   
---
B)they're spamming the stimpak button  
---
I downvoted based on the giant bold text wall
---
Stock up on a LOT of steel and aluminum. Go to the Munitions Factory workshop. Spawn the vertibot and destroy it, repeat. This works best in a team with shared useful perks 😉
---
All of the yes- I love canning in real life and once they let you decorate your camp with items in your stash I would love a shelf full of shit in mason jars in my kitchen.
---
What happened?
---
And all my aunts.
---
Facts
---
If a cargobot crate detonate fairly nearby, this will happen.
---
Why though? You want less people playing or something? 
---
Robo DJ, all the way.  Phasing out human workers across the board in WV wouldn't have just stoped at the mines.  A robot DJ would tow the company line, not go off script, and not take potty breaks.

Holiday Jim-Bob's Good-Time Jamboree!
---
There's also a PA frame locked inside a lvl 3 locked room at the transit center next to a fusion generator. So that's two more power cores with a chance at a bobblehead, a mod, and a plan spawning along with a mini nuke and various chems and ammo. One of the best locked rooms in the game imho.
---
Holy crap, I'm level 225 and this is the first I'm learning that. TIL!
---
No just then people who ps plus runs out can still enjoy the game
---
So.. No one told you life was gonna be this way?
---
I don't have plus at the moment and I can still do everything the same as if I did lol
---
You do realize you've been suspended right? I.e. You will get your account back once they fix how dupers dupe their stuff. 
---
You sure it won’t even let me start the game takes me to the ps store to renew it
---
Lol. Got the Grounded mutation. I was not concerned AT ALL, did a silo with a friend. Soon thereafter, I found Starched Genes in my Luck cards, equipped it level one and the FIRST rad-away I use, it vanished.
---
Hope you have fun with the game 
---
100%
---
That just stopped when i fast travelled to the area. But zou can't interact with the worshop station at all during the contest. And standing next to it doesn't stop it. Killing the player contesting it doesn't stop it and he can just respawn and keep coming at you. So i guess your only choice is to let them have it. What is the fucking point of claiming it in the first place Bethesda what the fuck?
---
It's why I never made another UC core after the first few I made. I made 5 for when I finally primed my gatling laser when I was a lower level. As I was running around doing missions I noticed I only had 4, then 3. Wait!  Where are they going?!  
---
Then one day I grabbed a new chassis (the one from Sons of Dane). When I put in a core by using the enter option, it was a UC core that was automatically chosen.  Mystery solved. 
---
You go up to someone and he the y button (on xbox) and it takes you I to trade.  Then you can see their entire inventory and they can see yours.  You click on an item of yours, whatever you're looking to sell, and set a price and they don't same.  If you want to buy something, then you click on this item and confirm the buy and it takes your caps. If you wanted to do a trade, I suppose you'd have to talk about it on voice chat or on here and each sell an item for sale same amount so it cancels out.
---
And have the AA legendary effect apply to energy resistance not ballistic.

I don't understand how I have a a gun that shoots bolts of lightning but I can't figure out a way to fit a boxing glove over my power armor....

Np, hope you get your dream pet soon =)

---
I say instead of contesting workshop have a time limit on how long you own the workshop. Let say an hour you would need to head back and activate the workshop first come get it. This way there won't be any pvp and the person who work all that time building that workshop doesn't get killed by a high lv guy waiting till he is done to contest it. 
---
Maybe an actual trading post. The dude only wanted plans. :(
---
Ripped to shreds in style
---
Well the crit meter gets used so there will be attacks in between crits just cause of how the game works. But you can certainly make every one of those buzz blades hit for sneak damage. There might be a small cool down timer between sneak attacks or perhaps it only displays the sneak attack pop up at a certain speed no matter how fast you attack. Regardless of if /every/ attack is a sneak or if there is a cool down the buzz and any knife with swing speed will get you sneak attacks at least as fast as the game allows.
---
Rad x diluted even though in the text is says it does , does not seem to suppress mutations

---
I offset this a few ways :
---
1. NEVER exit the game in a highly frequented nuke zone when you turn the game off.  There's a possibility it will put you back there.  I always go to my CAMP before I quit the game. 
---
2. NEVER exit the game with junk in my inventory.  If I die when I spawn in,  that's my fault.  Junk gone. Protect your junk if you're worried about it. That's what yo Stash is for. 
---
Thats very good.
---
I've had the high level charred ghouls attack at the sunshine meadows factory, was minding my own business when the defend workshop bit came up. Thinking it was going to be the appropriately leveled ghouls I traveled on in without my PA and got my ass handed to me. I was only level 16 at the time and still have a raging fear of them!
---
Some people get "lucky" and PS plus will work after the sub ends. I've seen this a few times on the PS Plus reddit

I eat up plasma grenades like nobody's business. You on PC?

Bethesda sent me a similar response that my 980ti and i7-5930K did not meet minimum requirements. Luckily the issue was either fixed in a patch or corrected itself. I would randomly be disconnected then not able to rejoin but only on my desktop. My old ass laptop ran my boyfriend's game just fine and if he logged into his account on the desktop, he wasn't experiencing the same issues.

Armor perk, quite easy to get and useful even at 1*
---
But you forget most of this content was probably in the works before the game was released. No one asked for backpacks either but they are releasing those. It has only been 4 months and you expect every request to be added to the game. 
---
I liked the tuxedos because you get a few of them. 
---
ok thanks
---
Good doors with unbroken glass, that don't fit in door frames ...
---
Yeah and I would have thought it was a great trick, because it is.
---
Did you ever consider that you might be the bad faith player who is deliberately irritating me? 
---
Like.  RIGHT when it kicks in.
---
Is this the same as at Top of the World?  I see this a lot up there.
---
I feel like I read something saying that the enemies spawn in relation to the level of the local players.  Which sucks for low level players to deal with...
---
Mutfruit, tato, and corn homey... grow them, make into vegetable starch at your cooking station, then scrap to turn it into adhesive! I have about 6 of each and every time I head back into camp I harvest and make some adhesive.
---
It’s a ton of ore and random crap.  Honestly it’s kinda not worth it. I think I’ve received some pretty worthless 1 star legendary items a couple times as well. 
---
Yeah I got thoes with my atoms 
---
Yeah I’m rocking the tux pack 👍
---
Real life rats can chew through concrete, so it’s actually not unrealistic 
---
Can confirm. Lvl 159 here with experience of nearly 40 SBQ fights. First time I’ve seen this happen. The image shows the Queen hovering above the drop site out of weapon range.  Disappointing to say the least.
---
500 rounds for one to do all at once I’d do 20,000
---
Lmao. 
---
None of them really, it's all cosmetics so it's going to be more of what you think looks good.  For me I won't ever spend atoms on power armor paints or outfits.  I like building so every atom I earn will go toward camp stuff.  But if you like your power armor to look cool that's what you should spend your atoms on.
---
  As far as actual monetary value, I personally don't think they are worth purchasing.  I think the items are way over priced, that's just my opinion though.  
---
Where did you store that many? 20 is my limit from a WS.
---
I really need to clean out my storage to fit the fusion cores needed for my PA :)
---
Maybe is was best 3 out of 5 and one dude just swept the other. Seems easier than going a full 5 rounds. 
---
Take my upvote!

God, the more and more I see posts like this, the more and more I want to reinstall FO76..

I got the camo combat armor paint, haven't used it yet though.

Honestly this community is awesome i find.

Good job!

There were quite a few boarded up buildings in Fallout 4 as well. It was dense though.
---
Cool! Will look out for you guys.
---
I love how there is no upvote
---
I have had several complaints, and quit playing for 10 days (was in the hospital) but it keeps me coming back and I don't think I have done 1/4th of the quests. I just roam around kill stuff, collect stuff and either break it down for parts or sell to the vendors. Sadly, I will be taking a break starting until the following Saturday as I am flying out to visit family and I don't think they have an xbox 1, they are still on OG xbox and ps3. 
---
Or have pvp servers pve servers and pve/pvp servers 
---
so is Biv like that lady from fo3 that sent you on the wasteland survival guide quest?
---
Lmao, these guys are legends!  Ran in to them when I was doing a Whitesprings farming run a week or so ago, one guy was there stripped down to his underwear trying to get me to bareknuckle brawl him.
---
Never did take him up on it, but I laughed for a couple minutes, good to see people enjoying the game 👍
---
Lmao, I'm loving it.
---
Obviously learn new words of power from them for Dragon shouts.

My building is locked with the highest lock. No other object is damaged and the letters should also be damaged. They are simply hanging in the air. I'll check later and see if there's an easy fix.

I don't use mods.

I do have Atom Shop items which I've only used in-game currency to get.
---
That is pretty awesome lol
---
Actually that would be great. I just need you to stop upping the storage space and give us builders a little more wiggle room for once. Im fine with a turret cap if i can just fit a bit more in my circle.
---
I don't use 3rd party mods.  
---
No mods and on PC.
---
I keep several corn growing at camp just to make corn soup. It fills both food and drink pretty well. Eating 2 to 3 at a time keeps me topped up for a while, and with super duper i make about 20 at a time. 
---
Canning would be fun too. Or even drying meats for jerky.. As long as i don't have to can creamed corn. I don't like that stuff. Not sure why.
---
I agree with this. PvP is so broken I can't even participate. Yesterday some newbie came up to my base to check it out but the door was locked and he got himself wanted by breaking the door. Once he was wanted and in my house, a bunch of people ported in and just broke all my shit. I turned off pacifist so I could run them off but one guy just hopped around with a permanent stealth boy and one shot me whenever I got close. I had to hop servers to save my house.

Need a perk called Jodie/jody. If you use that perk, you are a total bitch and can be killed by anyone at any time even if the person has passive on. But if you target a person with the jodie/jody perk, your perception, intelligence, and luck are reduced to 1 for 5 minutes. Jody/jodie cannot physically harm his or her attacker.

Watching the guy fly down with the thumbs up emote is killing me!!!! Lmao

Yeah doesn't look like you can stop it a second time. That is some crap =] Good to know though.
---
&gt; Workshops - there's a solution for this. Make a different game mode/mechanism for workshop challenges in adventure mode. Challenge for a workshop takes caps from the challenger to initiate a challenge for ownership. A warning is sent to the owner that their workshop ownership is being challenged and there's a time limit to respond. Then send out several waves of enemies to attack the workshop - player that gains the most kills wins the ownership challenge and gains/retains ownership of said workshop.
---
This is so much cooler than the shitty pvp workshop system we currently have.
---
 which was ops point. People are idiots, bad at pvp, then complain "i got griefed. This game is broken"
---
Maybe, however think of all those people that are left handed ( I'm not ), how do they feel throughout life always catering for the right handers.
---
Don't think I ever saw that one.  I haven't really paid much attention to the paints though
---
Sorry, but I'm on Xbox
---
I eat through them with melee power attacks and ranged VATS. Both will absolutely wreck a fusion core.  The jet pack will do it too. 
---
The workshop pvp is just terrible and unimaginative in itself. 
---
When I first heard Fallout was going online, I immediately thought "Oh wow, I'd love to join a faction and build a fort with others and then defend said fort from hostile factions and raid other factions' forts holy shit that would be so cool."
---
Ah well. It was really fun in my mind.
---
Had that happen once.  In this particular instance, It was great! Logged off the night before doing a quick Whitesprings run.  Spawn in and nuke loot zone! I had all my weapons primed for this so it was great!  If I had not, then it would have sucked big time.
---
Right in front of Whitesprings -- no one around, a billion ghouls, and me.  had a sea of them mobbing me so I lit them up trying to tag each and every one with my gatling then ran for the Whiteprings entrance.  Full shoot out between robot and ghouls, cars exploding bots going wild and I'm on the balcony watching the fireworks and beating off the occasional ghoul that made it past the robots.  Once the ghouls were killed off, loot city.  Great time.  must have been around 40 glowing ghouls.
---
Average legendaries, but LOTS of scrappable stuff and chems up the wazoo.
---
It's cool looking.  I passed it over to wait for it to appear in a bundle or cheaper but kind of regret it 
---
Not really. You're safe inside and this would make it easier to trade shit you just got from a nuke. It seems like a better idea tbh.
---
True but when it's for your left hand but on the right side where theres a wall like the enclave service entrance than it's a little difficult 
---
Same could be said about a non PA user not able to benefit from using a PA helm, we could insert some energiser size D batteries to make it work.
---
Most legendaries are hardly worth hauling to the nearest vendor. ;)
---
I got the fireplace and the nuka quantum sign. Yeah cosmetic only but i spend alot of time dicking around with my camp.  Oh and one of the floor tiles and the pink princess bed that everyone pissed and moaned about. I go around capping workshops for plans then putting pink beds on rooftops and and on top of extractors then server hop.
---
Ah yeah, I'm sure it will come back around.  They make things temporary so you feel more pressured into buying some atoms.  I've been trying to save mine up so if there is anything I really like that's temporary I can get it.
---
Time zone would be helpful 
---
Thats like the left hand reject on some of the guns yet your character holds the gun right handed lol

I kill them anyway for the adrenaline boost. The mirelurk queen is the only threat there but she goes down if you treat her like the queen- endangerol syringer and aa. The degen she puts out is pretty heavy, guessing it's poison. There's a radscorpion too that can do about the same. Get a aa weapon and use the perks to get near full damage on the queen. You actually need 2 nowdays cause one will probably break if lucky strike doesn't proc much. You can repair in the barn but takes you out the xp ridiculousness there on the ground.
---
&gt; You can't fast travel in a nuke zone.
---
Yes you can, you can fast travel to teammates who're inside nuke zones. Most people I try adding to my team during a nuke typically accept.
---
I don't think there are camp locations for both lead &amp; aluminium together.
---
They say, "It's easier to attract bees with honey than vinegar." Someone at Bethesda/Rock*/Blizzard must be allergic to Fn bees.
---
&gt; The social one could have high level sentrybots and other things to auto fire at anyone trying to fight and keep mobs from disturbing the players.
---
So whitesprings?
---
i agree or at least drop the price of the stock they are removing by like 80% so it would make people want to buy it before its gone.
---
Wow, I didn't know this one had rad storms at all lol
---
Yes. But not a high nuke target or farming zone. 
---
Yeah, me too. 
---
I think the sandbox part of the game has decent possibilities for user created content, but with all the savage criticism and the negativity this game received, hard to invest time and efforts. 
---
That, and the fear to create something cool, just to be easily destroyed by random scumbags.
---
Come on by!
---
Faction PvP would be a lot more meaningful - I’m in for this.  Could be a future game mode - join a faction and sign on to faction PvP servers where you end up in coop PvP.  They’d have to matchmake enough so servers are balanced faction wise.
---
I did but got tired of being destroyed by invisible high level enemies every time I loaded in lol
---
Just to be clear, I always try to help those under lvl 50 at whitesprings, including stimpacking them when they die. But the turret bases are super annoying and I wish people would stop.
---
Both near each other? Can't really think of a spot really like that to be quite honest. 
---
In my opinion, I think it's better to set up a extractor for aluminum somewhere then just farm for lead using the gyms at the motel near Flatwoods, the gym at Charleston Fire Department, the gym(s) in Vault Tec University and the Hornwright Estate mansion down in the AshHeap. If you have your excavator power armor by now, I would suggest making the trip to Lucky Hole Mine (In front of Front Defiance) to get lead ore from there (An easy 300-450ish lead ore if you're thorough enough) but you'll need a lot of acid, and if you couple this with Super Duper rank 3, you can easily get over 600 lead scrap from this and should last you a few weeks if you use it wisely.
---
Yes please
---
Fallout 4 I used mods that opened up many of the buildings and added loot to them.
---
I’d throw a buck or two at them for Rose’s Raider Radio.
---
I just got a jet pack on Xbox one.  I'd trade for calibrated shocks or 2.5k caps.  If anyone's interested let me know.  For the X-01
---
Damn, sounds like Bethesda though. Shame they didn't do shit. That and a certain infamous griefer seems to be back, same name just with x's in the front and back though.
---
Why? It makes more sense to me to do it there for that very reason. It makes it easy to offload your wares to other players, which is pretty common right now except people sell to the vendors then other players buy that stuff. 
---
If it's because you can't fast travel inside a nuke zone then I'm surprised at you and the rest of this sub. I figured that most people would have figured out by now that you can fast travel in a nuke zone. You simply need to add someone inside the nuke zone to your party and fast travel to them. If whitespring was the hub, there would be people inside aware of this fact that would be happy to party up to help you fast travel. Hell it's not the current hub and I still don't have a problem partying up with people at the club house to help me fast travel there 90% of the time.
---
Url link please

Watch as this update also nerfs Party Boy/Girl. Calling it now.

Surprised no one has said Mothman Statue. I mean it turns into moths, man. For 700 atoms
---
They do just *walk* from there, if your camp is far from where you tamed them, that could be a lotta time. Then you gotta pray it doesn’t get killed...
---
The picture says whitespring but I've never seen the boxing ring. 
---
Unless it's there and didn't notice it
---
They could incorporate a minigame that gives you two options.  
---
1. If you want to keep the workshop that you own,  you are given the option to engage in pvp. Whoever wins obviously gets the workshop. 
---
2. If you don't want to engage in pvp, your second choice is to just surrender the workshop without a fight. 
---
I mean I went to the mire and my camp is by the top of the world like in the mountains
---
Get the Carnivore mutation, Lead Belly 3 and use ionized meat. Lead Belly 3 removes the rads and Carnivore gives you 40% food instead of 20%. Ionized meat doesn't spoil!
---
It literally walks back to your camp, so the farther away you were the longer it will take to get to your camp. If it wasn't killed in the process since I believe that is also possible.
---
What's the link?
---
I want the more options on where to put the tattoo 
---
We were so close...if the AMs and PMs were switched, I’d join ya. 
---
But, congratulations on the baby! 
---
I would guess that player needs to be present
---
Wow. I see they found you too. Its just... kind of unbelievable! 
---
Nice but any idea where I can find an aluminium vein to plant an extractor on?
---
Love the "Awe you should have got bird bones."
---
This sounds like it could be true I hope this gets seen. 
---
&gt; pathetic
---
It's pathetic to have different gaming preferences from yours?
---
and not for friggin $18
---
Thanks dude, that's awesome of you. Odds were against us too.
---
So it dying is possible? Fuck
---
you gotta wear it now so you get your moneys worth. 
---
I think so. I've never tried it though.
---
Your weapon should show the damage with perks, you can do the math there. Can only assume and you know how that goes.
---
We'd be much more cool than say... the golf course crowd. (?)
---
86, and getting some mean crafts, let's party, I'm in in the mornings, MTN time
---
Looks like he got attacked by a couple stingwings.
---
Fun Fact :) 
---
 it was the British who were Tommys/Limeys/pom , Americans were Yankiee / Yank, German Fritz , Hun..  Russian Ivan/russkie, Japanese Tojo - and then theres a few terms id rather not repeat.  
---
Thomas is a brit anyway so Tommy works :)
---
No. Op thinks these people know what they're getting into because they're high level. The likelihood of getting a workshop contested, ever, is incredibly rare. They're only contested by people that actually want to do PvP. People that want the resources just server hop usually. So someone that wants to PvP now starts taking their workshop, quits take over, kills them and takes their junk and now repeats this. Workshop holder can now be killed until they hop servers. I know exactly how all of it works, so I avoid ever taking them and when I do, I take 4-5 and travel between all of them, and don't do anything else because I don't want to be out clearing West Tek and getting killed by a bunch of "raiders" abusing the workshop's broken mechanics.
---
Most of my friends just think the game is too expensive. I could get them to play it but they just don't want to buy the game :( 
---
Why in the good shit would Bethesda look into your scenario?  What did the guy do wrong?  
---
Except he had no mic, but then yelled as he was ejected?
---
FAKE AS SHIT
---
That's true
---
I've never been a rule maker obviously
---
Seriously!  At very least he should have bulk of ALL the types of junk, it matches with theme of the location, and if anyone was going to have a strong inventory, it should be him 
---
I was asking because I don't have the relevant perks to test manually, I can always grind up another level or two and figure it out, but I want to pick up other things beforehand. 
---
I just like making informed choices before devoting resources to a specific build.
---
I am indeed without
---
https://fo76map.com
---
Enjoy :D
---
It is fun.  I've spent countless hours fighting my friends.  I gain enjoyment.  The ammo and mats spent on repairing are well worth the entertainment.
---
Glad to see those traps got figured out. I couldn't figure it out for the life of me. 
---
Not my scenario?
---
Looks cool nice work! 
---
Lol that's awesome.
---
What armor Is that level 55 wearing?
---
Damn
---
Lead? Go anywhere there is a lot of toys 
---
My camp has been a bar/trading post for months now. With the addition of brewing and vendors and  stash decorations my camp will be more complete! Hopefully the update comes with the ability to show CAMPs on the map so people can see it (optional). 
---
Only other major thing I want is CAMPs to become BASEs and give us new CAMPs with smaller bugets to move around. BASEs would be more permanent and make it feel like we actually rebuilding America.
---
Yes it's possible. My buddy tames deathclaws and Yao gaos but it's only happened to him once or twice that they died before getting to his camp 
---
They are going to "vault" them.  Like when Disney takes certain movies out of circulation (can't legally buy or stream them anywhere) for a while and then brings them back.  This is to drum up interest and demand for those items.  They won't give them to you for free, the whole point is for them to be gone and for you to miss them so that when they come back you'll buy them.
---
This is west virgina son we speak 'merican round these parts
---
I did the same thing. I used raised concrete foundations. The sound thing and conduits with wires to make 2 ropes.
---
I love jug &lt;3
---
If a vats build also try &amp; get ap refresh as one of the armor perks
---
Weren’t Germans also called Jerry’s?
---
Would you know any other random locations for them to spawn? Not set spawns? I really want a mega sloth
---
They stay until taken.,once it leaves ur inventory it is no longer attached to ur player
---
No, but they should be looking to the "customers" aka us for ideas.
---
Not just implementing random things that pop into their heads.
---
If they took people off half the stuff (aka what we didn't even ask for) how much faster would PVP servers and Player Vending be in?
---
I like to build in pre existing structures and just extensively decorate. And no turrets
---
Maybe enclave
---
Any horde event should guarantee a 3* enemy, watoga can be ok as well.
---
I know he got a mega sloth in between harpers ferry and tanagra town. North of the cliff with the dog that chills with its deceased owners (I placed my camp around the dog and it's awesome). I also see alot of decent lvl enemies there like gulpers and mirelurks that are for sure random spawns. 
---
How is it spoiling someone elses ebtertainment?  If your enjoyment of something is so fragile that getting shot at in a shooting game spoils it for you, then you probably shouldnt even play. 
---
I wasn't paying attention and just realized you're on PS4 and I'm on PC.
---
Anyway, keep doing your thing. It's a necessary service.
---
Note Disney has been called out for their vault BS because half the time you can still buy the things in a standard edition. 
---
Like in the middle of the two?
---
Are you running solo or with a team?
---
Like everyone else I am concerned about the dailies being glitched. I want to grind the mire dailies to get that travelers leather coat, but they will not trigger for me. Any of them, except queen of the hunt once every week or so.
---
Yeah but more so east of the river. East of the river and right above the tracks on the map.. If that's descriptive enough.. Lol
---
Thanks I’ll see what I can find!
---
Thanks! 
---
Imo tank killer is better investment over sniper
---
That was my favorite.
---
"Awww what?"
---
Plays by the “bigger font = better argument” ruleset.
---
On the side of tanagra town right?
---
i could try this, i have 100% reduced fall damage xd
---
Perhaps I should start offering my defense attorney services for those wrongly arrested by Appalachian PD... :)
---
They’re already doing this. From ITV February 14th:
---
&gt; Starting soon, our Community team is going to start livestreaming Fallout 76 on Twitch and Mixer. We’d like to start working to answer more of your questions in real-time while also having fun hanging out with you. We’ll be curating these streams based on what you’d like to know, as well as using them as opportunities to chat more directly with you while we share in our excitement for new content, quests, events, and more throughout this year, and beyond.
---
&gt;We're currently aiming for our first stream to take place on Friday, February 22, from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. ET.
---
Go to lucky hole mine to grab ore to make your lead. You can get hundreds in a few minutes. 
---
I've heard people advocate the razorgrain soup diet, too - but essentially automating my food crafting seems a little boring.
---
Fuck the police! But thanks for helping out, cheers 
---
Which is the exact problem. I hope they are looking deep into my accounts to fix this. If i could make literally everything I've done in 76 public I would.
---
As an example of my hoarding. The food Brain Bombs doesnt expire. Its made with 3x Sugar Bombs. But only the sugar bombs with rads. I know of 2 spots spawning rad sugar bombs in whitesprings. I have like 20ish brain bombs on my account in the event I ever needed food without an expiration, that also gave massive AP. Kinda redundant TBH as nuka quantum is really similar.
---
Many thanks to the guy who gave me 6 fusion cores at Poseidon today,what an awesome community this is turning out to be.
---
We make sure we have proper warrants! Only arrests made are against wanted players! :)
---
 Is it me that the only listen to the same songs over and over again? There's genuinely no diversity on it. I never heard Big Iron, but my friend told me it's there? And i can count on my hand the number of times i heard Country Roads, maybe 4-5 times.  
---
 
---
Yeah. East of river, west of tanagra and north of the tracks. 
---
This is what I'm worried about. I know they are in the wrong. But if they do fess up and say "whoops we fucked up" could you imagine the shitshow then? I honestly expect to never get unbanned.
---
not as much as molerats hates my windows and walls xd
---
I would like to know this as well. I have an extra set. On ps4 if anyone is interested. Not trying to hijack post. 
---
Yeah i forgot that one, there were quite a few nickname depending on what nationality was saying them, Canadians called the Germans Heinies short for Heinrich, Hungarians called the Brits Pudding Heads, Germans called the Americans Ami &amp; During WWI the Scots were Ladies from Hell or Devils in Skirts because of their Kilts
---
You are making broad assumptions that they are not listening and implementing things players ask for based on they were not released yet. They have added plenty of player suggestions in the game. Good and bad. I doubt any of the items in the road map were random ideas. I would bet that they were either meant to be in the final release but were cut later due to deadlines or they were already on a content road map made before release. 
---
And if I am correct player vending machines were in the pre release gameplay video released by Bethesda. 
---
More so west middle of abandoned waste dump and tanagra town
---
It is only useful for decoration but it is so small and hard to order it really isn’t worth it
---
That's the Wilhelm scream. It was edited onto the video. It's a sound effect that's been around since the early days of black and white cinema. It's like the original meme before memes were a thing. 
---
Oh, yeah I guess we need someone to test. I'll see what the numbers are like and post back
---
Interesting.
---
Can't even drop nukes on the forest, because it's the starting zone and they don't want low levels to get wrecked.
---
This is why I avoided higher level players like the plague until I was lvl45.
---
Yes. (Its from the montt python skit "the bruce club")
---
Damn right I would post his name too. 
---
There are some pretty cool power armor paint jobs coming. The four horsemen of the Apocalypse paint jobs look pretty cool. 
---
It’s me coming to grief you and everyone and everything you’ve ever loved. 
---
Vibrations.
---
Yeah but a little south of that lol
---
i mean, feel free to waste your time
---
RPG 101 basically.
---
If you can something it should pretty much be good for a year in game, which means it shouldn’t really spoil
---
I think the dark wood floors are worth their price.
---
I plan on mainly doing solo
---
I mean cannibalism is in the game. This is a step down from that I would like to believe.
---
But the ones that we really need them to fix last 4 games
---
"Oh you really should have gotten bird bones"
---
Implying I didn't already have a bar at CAMP from launch.
---
I visit around 62 Stashes daily and can confirm that many of the old locations are no longer spawning stashes. For Example: Morgantown Train station only spawns one stash box.
---
I feel like someone level 400 should be able to do more things than someone level 50
---
I noticed that fenced walls help protect your gardens.
---
I might be wrong though.
---
I’ve been doing that for 24 years, so why not.
---
(As side a note, I’m entirely joking. I’m pacifist and like passing on the supplies I don’t need to those who could use them.)
---
You can't use images in posts... not sure what you mean. Do you mean why did I use WoW as an example? Because it's a commonly known game that has had good social systems in place.
---
Favorite quest in the game. I died when I was sent away for having the wrong form.
---
Hasbro would fucking slaughter Zenimax and end up owning FO76
---
might drop by this arvo
---
Then I would get lone wanderer perk for sure.
---
That's true - can't run a grocery store if you stock spoils every 24 IRL hours
---
Yeah they do look cool, but they aren't very lore friendly.
---
I don't want to be critical but the camo paint job looks like an amateur modder made it. 
---
We need Blackbird back and a few good Faction paintjobs. 
---
They dont yet. there is already a Fallout: the boardgame with a new california expansion (vault 44 on the box)
---
Maybe its because those perk pack challanges are tied to specific characters so it cant show them till your loaded in a character. I know the rest are account based but thats the only thing I can think stops that. I agree though would be nice to view my dailys and weeklys from login screen. Maybe they could just add it to the top right with tips and news thats there.
---
So destroy them, rather than restrict them from being built.
---
Turrets are pointless.  Get rid of them.
---
What are you doing with purified water that you need more than one pump?  I grab 5 when I log in, harvest my crops and the naturally occurring dead yao-guai and radstag around my camp, and I've always got 3-4 silt bean soups, 4 corn soup, 4 tato juice, 2 bloodleaf teas, 3 firecracker berry juice, plus one of each yao-guai ribs and radstag steak.  All that with the 5 purified waters is more than enough for 4-5 hours of playtime.
---
Streamline your lighting setup by removing a bunch of connectors, and even more space will free up.
---
I have 7 lights for an entire 2-story house.  Careful placement will allow the house to be well lit at night.  Windows also let in a lot of natural light during the day.
---
I'm at about 60% budget with this house.  I got rid of the turret and outside crops a month or so ago.

---
I would not recommend disabling or skipping it, it gave me lots of login errors when I did. I guess the game initializes the network when the intro plays, if I let it play normally it would let me in without any issues every time.
---
I have 4 up in my camp
---
Oh I see well I collect it regardless just in case I come across a decent 50 cal so if you want the rounds my gamertag is gofukyurslf326
---
Swap out aqua boy/girl for rejuvenated...swap out light footed for evasive. I would do at least 2points in strength for Bandolier for carry weight and ammo weight reduction. I assume your gonna use mutations?
---
After level 50 levels don't matter. So level 246 is no stronger than a level 60.
---
If running with mutations then 2points in starched genes and maybe some vats crits perks.
---
First content drop will be March 12th in the form of Brewing &amp; Distillery mechanics as well as some quests to go with it. Bethesda did drop the next 100days roadmap a while back and things are looking good for the future (as far as future looking goes).  
---
Link if you haven't seen it yet: [https://bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019](https://bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
so a lvl 50 out geared another lvl 50.
---
sorry I don't mean to rain on your parade, but that is what it boiled down to. past lvl 50 levels dont matter.
---
&gt;a large portion of players aren't interested in pvp
---
Just simply not true. So many people would've played this game if it had real PVP.
---
this RPG about carrying really heavy stuff and running my own found junk repositor(ies) surprised me in the ways the gameplay grew on me. :D
---
As head of the NDA I demand official application for a permit to exist. The NDA is the premier organization in Tall out 76 for law enforcement, trade and rule making. The Appalachia PD is a rouge gang until officially permitted to exist. The application fee is 500 caps. You will pay the price or be destroyed.
---
This is AWESOME!
---
Wow! Thanks for the solid build tips!
---
I just wish they’d fix the brick keypad door
---
For lead you can go to the Easter penitentiary and collect all the tin cans there are 9 which = 81 lead and 192 steel once you are done sever hop and repeat
---
And have you seen Jumpforce with those damn animations? Rushed af. They. Should. Just. Wait.
---
The Zetans are coming...
---
Enemies will spawn by your level sometimes, even if low levels are very close
---
This is pretty clever man. I love the creativity. Props to ya sir!
---
I have a deep and utter loathing of the PVP vs pacifist mode as well. If I am pacifist that means I don't want to even be bothered by trolls trying to get xp by killing my two headed cow. This makes it less fun for me and less likely I will return as often as I am able. 
---
sounds like crickets, other bugs, and frogs. 
---
Your skill shows but you may want to work on proportions and angles a bit more, other than that I applaud your “fairly new to drawing” skill.
---
wish i had a could name and not my shitty nazaguerrero that i use for my login lol
---
It doesn't really have most, it just has 2. Lone wanderer/strange in numbers, dodgy, and serendipity are all in different trees. It does have plenty of flat resistance perks, but mitigation is pretty light. 
---
Crickets 
---
modders unite
---
Nice will have a sus of it ! Thanks 
---
I wish I had 100 downvotes to give this post.  If you want pure story mode PvE, go play Fallout 4.  This isn't Fallout 5.
---
I used a Suppressed Hardened Pipe Revolver Rifle with a Forceful Stock which gives the revolver a rifle stock and allows the gun to take advantage of Both Gunslinger and Rifleman Perks. Gun Runner works as well as other Rifle perks suck as Tank Killer. This Gun with a Gun-fu/Adrenaline set-up took me all the way into my lvl 100's when I switched over to a Lever Action.
---
Gnomes casting soells
---
I need the automation dlc in fo4 so I can make a terrifying garenteed death machine and name it Harold and we could go on all kinds of lovely adventures.
---
Good idea!! 
---
im confused by the sub here,, i presented an idea about improving the pet system a little as id like a Named pet and a pet reviver craftable &amp; it wasn't a bad idea yet it got completely crapped on by some , i just don't get this sub sometimes.
---
truth, there should be an element of multiplying synergy and the ability for players who work hard and align all of it to become extremely powerful and gain access to top level of difficulty. people want to acquire the best stuff and gain something new to do, this is evidenced in one of the best games of all time to be played online, diablo 3 seasons
---
Lol
---
I wouldn't blame the 293, cuz he was first blood.
---
I would blame the level 50 for not trying to pressure me out. He cowered by the bus, making it virtually a 1v2, considering he was hiding and the 293 was down. Also the sniper took so long to show up, as he was farming ghouls lol. So if he was there when his buddy ran to revive the 293, he would have caught me as I constantly shot at his buddy.
---
Then again the level 118 dude ran to revive his buddy who was sniped. Kind of an idiot move as well. He should have took over and waited for his sniper to engage.
---
The thing is, teams easily underestimate their opponents esp. when it is a 4v1. They thought I wouldn't be able to harm any of them. They learnt to think otherwise the hard way.
---
??? Idk it says it’s upvoted
---
Genius idea.
---
Honestly, I think cooked food just shouldn't go bad. This is a game, meant to be fun, and this takes all the enjoyment out of cooking. Plus, with all the radiation floating about, things should last a lot longer than they would in real life. With the speed that food spoils and the rate of hunger, you have to either spend the first 30 minutes after logging in hunting and cooking every time, or else carry around tons of canned food. It's a chore and a time tax that takes away from other parts of the game.
---
I still have faith in the game
---
I mean, it's all cosmetic stuff, so what's "worth" the price is largely in the eye of the beholder.
---
I would say that things like the laminate floors are pretty nice for sprucing up your CAMP.  Succulents are cute for adding more greenery.  I find most paints and outfits overpriced, so I don't have any of those.  I did give my character a 76 Trucker Cap though because, frankly, I don't like how the Baseball Cap looks and the darker color goes with her armor scheme.
---
well blizzard almost totally forgot what made them classic and top shelf. i recently found that they didn't lose it in diablo 3, that game is almost everything ic ouldve wanted from any other blizzard game experience, but i'm still sitting here wondering if the potential of the overwatch world as a vivid setting will ever get properly utilized for a co op / adventure style game, the sports pvp is really one dimensional despite being well done.
---
I’m level 90 and have 8 “focused fire” perks
---
Lots of drugs are inside stimpaks
---
Or you buy it but you get a quest to go into their base and loot the plans. In case youd lose it make so it always spawns in this special box. But make it account bound.
---
seems like a minor thing, there is a much greater design issue that should be addressed .
---
i won't be happy about bobbles or mags until they get acquired as cards on a second perk setup screen. eating them doesn't make sense, players want to use them to decorate, and the special abilities and boosts they represent should be configurable with limited number equipped simultaneously and time limits on the usage and reapplication
---
&gt; do you guys enjoy this?
---
Nope, can't imagine many do. 
---
Wish there was more actual stuff to do, rather than having to micro-manage your junk inventory and craft food. 
---
Ill add you. Im on in the morning a lot. 
---
Pm you 
---
Emmett mountain is good, I’d look on the market though, most people sell serums rather cheap.
---
Can my cop be one of your cops??
---
No you got down voted care your a whiney no lifer who's acting like an ungrateful entitled child on a thread about new content people are  excited about. Why don't you wander outside of your parents house and catch a ride or really a bus to a store to buy some other game where you can hang out with a bunch of no lifers who chew through content at a rate only producible on a Chinese click farm. When your "git-gud" fest goes down for maintenance or you finally hit a wall; I'm sure the devs will have added hours of new content for you to chew through in 1 day. Ahh tithe pleasures of not having a job.
---
P.s.
---
Since you have so much free time and love to waste ours. Spell and grammar check my shiz. After your done i expect you to to make a full Essay about it and post it here on Reddit so we all know that your on your way to that come back your parents used to go on and on about.
---
Add fireproof to your chest piece, now your doing fire damage with melee (assuming it could work this way).
---
No... the fresh effect doesn't cause fire damage...
---
They are semi rare. I'd say 500 caps or so? Not very useful, but can be used to label areas of a camp or to put a door code up so players can get in but not random enemies, etc
---
I've gotten a few from turning it in.  Always a random 1* combat armor.  
---
Other than making people panic buy, I dont see the need for this "spring cleaning" there isn't that much in the shop as it is yet.
---
Sure! We always accept new recruits when we see them!
---
the problem with this solution is it adds another layer of bloat to the usability of this system, a much better solution would be to add the missing elements of this user interface, removing the bloat and solving the features gap
---
1- a reset option to just re spend the points you have access to, significantly time limited against repeats so it is used with care
---
2- an auto upgrade function that cuts out the mechanics of acquiring a duplicate card and combining two into one of the next level. instead the lower lever and the next level are both owned after choosing to get the next level. duplicates no longer happen, packs do not give a card you have maxed, and you can only pick cards you don't already have maxed. if you max it it disappears from the pick a perk pool
---
3 - ability to store the cards of lower or upper level you aren't planning to equip. bring them back from the stored tab if/when the situation comes up you want to regularly use for equipping again. same as when we choose what gear to carry into an adventure and which to store in the STASH
---
\*This message was Brought to u by marsupials herd\*
---
Huh? Seriously? 
---
U had stable flux on ur character?
---
That's amazing.. I've loved being an Appalachia cop! Can't wait to meet more likeminded folk!
---
Thought of putting together a village people set?
---
I wanna bet on robot fights!
---
It honestly isn't a bad idea
---
he gets it :)
---
Set the other Robots up as Provisioners to link all your settlements to one Settlement &amp; i found Starlight works well as that settlement because its clear and all the Robots will patrol the Commonwealth and meet at Starlight!! One of the best parts about Automatron imo :)
---
Great skills, but - and this is something that nearly every comic artist in history has gotten wrong - *boobies don't look like that*.
---
Meghan Hetrick did an awesome tutorial/cheat sheet a few years ago. Absolutely worth printing out and pinning up:

---
the host shoudl be a ghoul like the one encountered in fallout 1, even he is not the first humanoid NPC you encounter but it was the first cool one.
---
Was gonna mention each one of those things, so I’d say pretty accurate critique 
---
Yeah I don't engage in random trades..I only set them up thru the reddit market subs
---
I like the part where when you crash or leave half way through, you have to start the entire process again from the start.
---
Absolutely fantastic realism
---
It could be flagged as a nuke zone. You aren't allowed to fast trave or respawnl to a nuke zone, should be the same for dropping you in. 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
When people say no NPCs, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re misinformed. Most likely what they’re actually complaining about are the lack of dialogue options and agency in the story.
---
Good eye, definitely was.
---
You playing now or you getting on tomorrow?
---
Lol maybe it was just terrible rng then I always look forward to getting a bunch of stomach or rad chems.  Nice surprise though.
---
Tomorrow morning. 
---
I really like the simplicity of the first option. I’m not sure how willing they’d go for it though. 
---
The second option would also be nice to stop future duplicates, but we’re still cluttered with older duplicates. 
---
Third option could work but there are enough things to store so I’m not sure I’d want to deal with it like an item. 
---
Well to bad it is happening. That isn't the suggestion. That is something they are already going to do.
---
I hear what you hear and I feel like maybe it's a remnant of the Scorchbeast lures or the Sonic traps the FS and BoS were using? I only hear that noise around Watoga or maybe it's a bird?
---
Yikes. I don’t think I have that many of a single perk.  Rip 
---
Are you using VATS? 
---
Then what’s the point 
---
Ok buddy!
---
It just makes your breath smell that bad.
---
Honestly, just get Herbivore and eat whatever Berries/Flowers you find with Slow Metaboliazer if food is so much of a problem. 
---
yep, I just hope it doesn't catch fire with the youtube crowd again. but as we have seen week old drama is good enough for them.
---
Must be a lot of fire in that whiskey then 😇
---
or, why don't they attack every building? i'd be happier with them attacking my camp if that were just standard operating procedure for everything.
---
This suggestion is posted virtually daily. Please read the Bethesda plz list before posting suggestions. 
---
Come out of the vault and it's just piles of rubble everywhere. 😂
---
Tremors.

you can build a terminal.....i wonder if people can play a holotape if you load it up. then I wonder if they can steal it....
---
are you on pc by any chance? I kinda wanna test this.
---
Do these drops “dry up?”  The last several times I’ve done this quest I’ve gotten nothing but purified water and 40mm rounds.  Before that it was the regular assortment of ammo, plans, and gear. 
---
400ea?  Ouch. Myself and many others sell for half that. 
---
That's what self-immolation usually means. To set oneself on fire.
---
The device was good enough on its own it didn't need your friends pretending to be "legitimate" players, the cringey acting devalues the idea you had.
---
It is vital to have the option to hide a useless card in order to avoid scrolling thru them each time the need to equip a card arises. The streamer I watch is over L300, SOO many garbage cards. If scrolling thru garbage each time is enjoyable, u are welcome to never store any. And congratulation u are a hoarder :D 
---
Any chance of eggs?
---
Why protect wanted players?  They're going to get killed sooner or later, that wanted sign doesn't go away on its own.  If I get wanted I simply dump junk ASAP and head to a polulated area to get killed.
---
Why make a new character when we could have Grahm become the radio announcer.
---
Puny humans wanna set the world on fire
---
Gotten one in almost ever perk pack I’ve opened, F
---
Tried to create Marilyn Monroe Took 45 minutes trying to perfect her. Only thing wrong was the mole. But was worth it.
---
That guy was kind of a dick tho
---
I gave a level 1 bloodied sickle to a fresh out of the vault level 2 at the overseerers camp the other night. 
---
I love giving people stuff. If I can, I make them come to my house and jam with me before they get it.
---
We protect low level players from wanted players. 
---
My camp sits on the edge of a cliff. I have a range of animals and Super Mutants that will casually walk up to my camps stair and then just turn around and walk away. Of course by the time I hear them walking up, I am crouched in my chameleon armor. Its funny to see them come all the way up to my camp to just turn around. I've only been engaged in combat if I'm on my work bench or playing my tuba.
---
You can look for me or add me if you like. Name here is the same as on XBox. Always happy to help out. I'm US Central time zone, usually on evenings during the week and marathon on weekends. 
---
Please do a series similar to Skyrim
---
Cops!!
---
Oh awesome!  I mis-understood.
---
I’d personally like to see you able to take 4 perk cards, make a pack out of them that could be traded and only opened by someone else.  What they open is random.  Let’s old characters bleed off junk, a boost for new characters, and something that can bring people together helping each other out.  Exploitable?  I’m sure, but don’t see the harm.
---
Pretty sure most of the youtube crowd are just jokes by now. Think only one or two are still good. 
---
Just add a cosmetic blunt like in fallen earth.
---
Let's do it! I won't be home for a bit, but add me and we can get to it if you're still online later. IGN: kiddhavoc
---
I had HBO access for almost a year after I cancelled Vue. 
---
Sony doesn't know how to do things involving subscriptions.
---
You and the other poster suggest to me the opposite.  Probably about 50% of the time all I ever got was a stack of purified water/RadX/RadAway and random ammo and other worthless items.  I have gotten plans a couple times but it's been something I already know. Looks like a straight up crap shoot.
---
It does sound a bit sonic-y like something related to Scorchbeasts.  
---
Do you think 80 steel and 20 lead with 24 gun powder is worth 180 caps?
---
This needs to happen, and there needs to be a table flip option for when I loose. 
---
With armor one isnt always stronger than the other, its more your play style.
---
For example the best armor in the game is technically marine armor, however, heavy combat armor can also match its stats. 
---
The only real difference between the two is that marine armor covers physical, energy and radiation damage. But combat armor only covers physical and energy but it still equals up to the same number.
---
-Like if for example if marine armor has 20/20/10
---
-Then combat armor would have  25/25
---
Same numbers just split differently. So for armor it comes down to where you like to grind or what enemy you find yourself fighting most often, etc etc
---
Right? Like what the actual fuck?
---
I imagine blast radius as a game where you are trying to move your piece on a board to get further and further from ground zero.  Knocking other player back,  getting setbacks and bump aheads, with the nuke randomly going off at some point in the game.
---
Oh and the nuke actually gives off real rads, since rads seem to be trivial to cure in this universe.
---
Same here, they need to increase camp budget like they have for stash limit.
---
Everything’s a trip when you’re tripping LSDeese.
---
To be honest I never needed to cook anything in the game only doing it for a small bit of exp. I always having a lot of post war food on me, however I do agree with this concept of canning. I also think that the many spices you find in the game can also be used like spiced meat which could give extra benefits or salted meat that last longer.  Nice Idea!
---
I've been enjoying quite a lot actually! It's really fun imo, and honestly, just ignoring what critics say is what helped people enjoy a game. I haven't had any complaints so far, and I'm around level 17-18. I chose the Colossus Javelin because I like playing tanky classes in video games, and the Colossus is one heck of a tank. The flight movement system is also really well done in my open, and though some of my friends play on PC with a controller, I find it rather easy to pick up and maneuver with mouse and keyboard!
---
I built a terminal and holotapes do not stay loaded when you leave the screen sadly.
---
Still I like your idea and it even gives a large use to going through the trouble of finding all the games.
---
No
---
I want to join you guys and be that one officer who is always overprepared. What I’m saying is... blue power armor and red headlamp. I’m a walking police car.
---
so let me get this straight. to get all the switches and stuff you have to buy the barn set. what if you already have learned the barn building stuff? i got the barn set from claiming or defending a workshop so if i buy a second set of barn building set i can't use it, how am i supposed to get the switches and stuff? seems pretty stupid on bethesda's part.
---
Aww, darn. Thanks for checking though! And here's hoping the devs pick up the idea for a future update!
---
I personally like bos armor it gives you a balanced amount of protection from rads ,damage, energy damage, and by now you might be able to mod it to your liking. You can find it in glasses cavernas on taggerdys body...
---
Now this is some high quality trolling
---
That’s not a bad idea!
---
and rad resist for rad weapons
---
Love it! Great job... well designed, both the look of the shop and the mechanics of the trap. Very cool.
---
How much would you pay for those supplies? Maybe 50?
---
So am I in or...?
---
lul
---
I’m on now but just trading. Idk what level you are or if you need stuff join and I’ll see how I can help
---
Do you guys have a discord server, or a PSN chat, or something people would be able to join?
---
Hey, neighbor!
---
Location, location, location. If your camp is constantly being attacked, I'm sorry to tell you that you've chosen to live in a bad neighbourhood. There are some real prime estates where you can live out your days in peace and comfort.
---
Don't be lame
---
I was thinking for the change in scene. Everyone and their mom knows the whitespring. Why have a moving zone. 
---
and yes I know of the no tping to nuke zones. 
---
We don’t really like recruit per say. We just allow people to join the cause when we are in game!
---
really? I did the cavern twice and didn't get any BoS armor
---
Brahmin skulls count as well! And disarming bone chimes have a chance of dropping skull-related pieces.
---
Oh okay! Then I’ll help bring justice to West Virginia!... I guess.
---
Each one will have its own bar. And it’s more of a overall affect. 
---
I’ll let you know when I get online next time!
---
Nice post history/karma
---
Any room for anymore new recruits? I'd love to protect anyone and everyone from the harsh wasteland!
---
Used to seal that tasty nuke flavour in bottles
---
I was going to say that they weigh more lol that's there debuff 
---
I like going toe to toe with her wielding my shiskabob. Something quite epic about being an armored knight slaying dragons with a legendary flaming sword.
---
Great minds think alike!
---
I’m on now just trading 
---
I believe it's been fixed.
---
I’m only level 6 
---
I bought my first really good legendary melee weapon from him. Aint seen Jack since.
---
Lol I forget what they weigh for me with the weight reduction perk but I dont think they need any negative effects tbh
---
Absolute madman. 
---
"well, i guess when they said we're rebuilding civilization, they really meant it"
---
Please let me rick-roll Appalachia 
---
Enemies over like level 15 shouldn't be able to spawn in the forest. I haemve had level 60 super mutants spawn at Morgan town Airport somehow however 
---
I need closure on the saga of Butcher Pete!
---
Not having both parts is like playing We will Rock You and not following up with We are the Champions:  it should be against the law.
---
Finally!  I’ll have to see on Xbox after the kids go to sleep
---
Yep, this is why i lesrned to logoff wearing PA or a hazsuit.
---
Great I’ll add you ASAP 
---
I have the same thing going on.  I was supposed to go to the wendigo cave and get something but one day the quest disappeared.   Now I just have a marker to Rose which doesn't trigger anything.
---
Yeah. I have to agree with that one lol. Who knows they might add it in later updates. I hope somewhere in June we get more summer like songs like The Beach Boys lol.
---
TSE is still very viable for endgame. LVL 109 and I can kill most things with my TSE handmade in under 4 shots. I saw a post a few weeks ago that did the math and TSE still had like 9 points of damage more than AAE but this is the internet so take it with a huge grain of salt.
---
Every time I say this about the broken record topics I get downvoted to oblivion 
---
The only advantage the 246 has is that he's had more time to collect perk cards. If the 50 planned his build out well and stuck to it, he is indeed on equal footing or even better than the 246. 
---
Constantly? No. Occasionally. I'm literally on a cliff edge with only one way in. I could pick a quieter spot but I need better map access points too
---
maybe just a new shop where these games are set up and you can play against other people and an ai option also make some working arcade machines.
---
No just raw flux. I was in a blast zone farming.
---
I also have a few other TSE weapons for sale if your interested.
---
There is a streaming fallout themed radio station on you tube I sometimes play in the background while playing on PC. Has the classics and songs that are from the fallout music era that works well. Just like GNR without 2 dog... Miss that guy.
---
Raw flux won't drop..only junk does..but stable flux will..but..if he was being  jerk..he deserved what he got
---
I’ve updated the post. It could be coming!
---
I never really got into D3, but I was heavy into WoW since BC. That game has left a giant hole in my heart after my disappointment in BfA. I had a lot of fun, met a lot of great people and all that disappeared shortly after BfA's release. 
---
I just want perm bonuses back for bobbleheads and magazines.
---
Who is flying these things
---
That's the beeping from the site code officers I think
---
Love me some fun trap bases...looks good!  
---
#1. You can build resource collectors from the start, no plans required. Find the resource map online, place your camp and reap the benefits!
---
Warning, raiders use this map as well.
---
#2. Do events. Any of them. All of them.  
---
That con is most definitely true.
---
I totally understand! Once you guys get something up, I'll be happy to join in on the fun!
---
Thanks! I’m so much a noob right now and trying to learn things but thanks
---
If u max the good with salt perk..it takes a longgggggg time for food to spoil..it's awesome
---
I seem to have the opposite issue everywhere I go seems to have super low lvl ghouls spawning. Like 16 but I'm at the southern  point of the divide and am the only person :/
---
Anytime! Sorry for the delayed response, was playing!
---
Since the TSE nerf, AA seems to have pulled ahead but you still see mostly TSE on SBQ. 
---
swoop in and take it all ASAP!
---
I approve this message! This is so cool. Thanks! 
---
It’s nice to see people that are enjoying this game as much as I am. I hope to see you all out there!
---
I've got quite a few.  I believe they are always Heavy Combat Armor, and always 1* (never 2 or 3).  I am running about 15%
---
Just a small list of the items I have received:
---
*Regenerating Combat Torso
---
*Zealot's Combat Right Arm
---
*Ghoul's Combat Left Arm
---
*Zealot's Combat Left Leg
---
*Cloaking Combat Right Arm (x2)
---
*Bolstering Combat Right Arm (x2)
---
I always try to turn in at least two at a time (it counts, 350 exp reward for 1, 400 exp reward for 2 or more).  Mostly because I only do about 1 a day, sometimes two if I pick up more when I'm doing stuff.  Got the Shielded Lining plan and a few T-60 Paints, plus a handful of outfits.
---
I cannot say if the increased reward also increases your chances, but I don't see any reason to stop, myself.
---
I just went on a super mutant killing spree.  I was going to do that anyway but it's nice to have a reason :)
---
Officer, am I being detained?
---
Maxson’s Battle Coat was the greatest thing in 4
---
I've had a lot of issues with CAMP budget (Phantom items eating it up), and had to completely scrap everything &amp; start over several times on my main character.
---
I have on numerous occasions had things disappear only to show back up in storage days, or even weeks later.
---
I have 6 other characters that have never had this problem, but my main has been a constant battle, budget at 60% one day, then 98% the next, for no apparent reason.
---
I think he was after my hardened mass. I thought maybe he accidentally shot me because a ghoul was right there. But then he kept coming after me. So I ran around a corner, ran into a bunch of bloated glowing ones. Ran past them and he ran right into them. They kept him at bay just long enough for me to clear, turn and fire. It was amazeballs.
---
oh, phew. i was almost irate reading the other comment lol. i’m glad there’s someone else who’s nice to other players, i love handing out power armour and cores to lower level folks and giving away excess resources. that’s what makes the f76 community so damn great
---
No, they don't dry up.  I was doing well with turn ins, then went about 7 days with nothing.  Then today I got a piece of Cloaking Combat Armor (being hit by melee generates stealth field for 30 seconds).
---
That’s the call. Tbh. I just look inside. If I need it I need it. Like some rando started getting loud with me for taking stuff in a bag that was there since the start of the nuke. Lol. 
---
It’s definitely making the game more fun!
---
Got recon sensors in your PA?  If so it does this when ADS with any ranged weapon. Otherwise, it's a nice glitch. 
---
I don’t usually wear my PA but you may be right
---
Ahhh ok yeah there's a ton of hardened mass in the nuke zones..I was going to say tho.,don't ever go in the wild with stable flux..I'd be mad at myself if I lost it
---
I'm on during that time on my days off. I invite you to team if I see you in world.
---
"I owe my soul to the company store..."
---
Oh dear oh dear, I'd forgotten about these lyrics.
---
It would only do that when you have the helmet on. It will mark anything you line your sights up on. 
---
Side note:  it's super useful against stealthboy users in PvP. Tag them before they start crap and if they try to be sneaky, you'll still know where they're at because you can tag non-hostiles and friends too. 
---
Halloween candy is the end all of foods, no weight with thru hiker and never spoils
---
You must be a Dark Souls fan.
---
&gt;You all crawled out of the same vault and then after a week you just go batty.
---
We're working on weeks? I figure they've been out for at least 3 months now, that's enough time to make someone crack, especially the folk that might have relied on vault supplied medication to stay sane and now don't have it.
---
Um, this isn’t the help/rant section for Bethesda.
---
Seems they have my blackberries - those poor things get attacked all the time.
---
And my turrets just sit there and watch
---
Yeah I've unsubscribed alot of YT people 
---
God this would be good - the number of times I have spawned at the base of the cliff of my CAMP is ridiculous 
---
Awesome.
---
I missed out too because I only wear excavator armor and it was a mistake. 
---
I used a curio table variant 5/7 with the CAMP on it. 
---
We have due process rights!!!
---
Each one has it's own bar, but if you have one type of meat for example opossum meant and it's about to spoil and you pick up another opossum meat fresh from a kill, it will share the condition of the opossum meat in your inventory and also be about to spoil.
---
You’re a genius! Thanks!
---
Just keep interacting with her until she gives in. I was lucky and it only took 10 minutes or so, but others have had to switch servers, get insulted over and over, leave the server, get insulted over and over... until she finally realized you did what she asked you to.
---
Because the alcohol is so much worse than the murder, drugs, and even cannibalism. 
---
Over level 50 for power armor mods/plans.
---
I did the same thing as you. Sadly some non believers took flamers to the place. 
---
Between whitesprings station and watoga suit cases ive gotten and given lots of stuff away. 
---
Better than throwin it away 
---
Yesterday I was in artisans corner low on caps..thinking about how I'm gonna earn some more..and their was a little doggy bag sitting in front of friedrich..there was over 10 1* legendary weapons in there..it just seemed someone just sessioned the golfclub and was dropping weight or whatever..it also had some junk and ammo..I almost cleaned out the vendor of caps..want 200..but it was a pleasant surprise finding the bag and extremely helpful.,not the first time someone's dropped ok items there
---
I was thinking the same thing. I thought because I was killing the passive bots I was denied the safe. 
---
no they patched it
---
I think I will, it'll be fun to actually interact with other players!
---
Interesting, thanks!  I didn't know that multiple gave more xp.
---
What platform are you on? I've been at the camps that have two of them without any frame rate drop at all. 
---
Last patch they made the safe a one time loot, you can see it in the code listed under prewarsafe. 
---
&gt; Why have a moving zone.
---
This is against the point of having a hub.
---
Can I have your chameleon armor if any?
---
Nice to see a group of people helping out, I usually just follow low level players when they're in high level places and safeguard them, but then they start wondering why a high level players is following them.
---
And what is your gamertag?
---
And when are you on?
---
Cool story. I don't think it was necessary to point out the weird accent. But that's minor.
---
I don’t mind. He was so polite it was worth it. Its just some in game currency
---
Wasn't asking for help or ranting, was asking bethesda when they play on introducing this.
---
That was the only fix I found online. Hasn’t worked yet. I guess I’ll throw YouTube up on my laptop &amp; mash y for an hour lol
---
At Camden Park, there is a stall set up with four skulls on it. Easy way to get most of the challenge done.
---
So I’m new to the game. Got it yesterday. I’m lvl 10. What’s flux and why are people killing for it?
---
I couldn't make where it is from. Never heard of it before. So I think a different word could have been more suitable. Then again, no race/nationality was mentioned, so it isn't really offensive.
---
Encountered three scorchbeast attacking the hornwright security bot in the battlebot event.
---
Was it supposed to be in at release? I must have overlooked something that said it should have been. Can you point me to that?
---
Sorry wasn't meaning to accuse you of anything. I have a non American accent so probably being a bit sensitive. Sorry - very cool story though! Running a bloodied critical build myself, too.
---
believe me, theres a reason we disappeared. from all out deletion of legendary abilities and unlocked appearances - the fact they could even treat any individual player segment the way those black harvest demon spec players were foretold to me the drain was what we were circling - to just the general drag of losing a little bit of fun out the glyphs system and speccing with all the pruning and squishing that they felt the need to do. there was a somewhat golden moment in the 5.x pandaria and about then is when all the voices of reason ceased to exist, about the same time the mythical Titan cancellation went down.
---
It takes them all in one shot for some reason. 
---
Cause that’s how it works.  You turn in every piece you find at once.  If you want multiple separate turn ins you have to pick them up one at a time.  
---
And they only show up as one in your inventory no matter how many you pick up ( once you have the quest that is ).
---
Picking up 1 and turning it in gives you 350 exp and some items.  Picking up two or more gives you 400 exp and some items. 
---
Ahh. That sucks! I’ve been fortunate enough not to have been attacked. The only thing destroying my camps is me. I can never stay satisfied for long lol. 
---
Somke wede
---
You have to store them in your stash then pick them out one at a time and turn them in
---
That's frustrating. So basically I should have put them in my stash and turned in separately?
---
 I really want the bos under armour level 3, any advice on farming technical data?
---
You only can't drop nukes on the areas closest to the vault like Flatwoods and Point Pleasant over to Sutton. You absolutely can drop nukes on the rest of the forest such as Morgantown, Charleston, and Summersville. I've been in those nuke zones before. Not worth the time and I don't recall ever seeing anything above lvl 60 spawn.
---
Sorry my GT is KillaOutbreak and I closed shop at 9:00 PM CLT.  Are you looking for anything particular?
---
I might suggest going during either TOOT (Taste Of Our Town) or the chocolate festival weekends. It’s in Lewisburg (where I live) which is about five minutes away. TOOT is usually in October-ish and sees all the local restaurants giving little samplers and such. Chocolate fest is similar but with only chocolate 
---
The few downsides are you gotta pay for tokens to use for samples. One token=one sample. The other is that the restaurants don’t actually sell the samples they give. They’re just extra special things made specifically for the fest
---
There’s also the greenbrier river trail if you like bike riding/hiking. It stretches for several miles on a mostly flat path. You’ll see a lot of wildlife if you do it
---
Flux is nuked flora..so basically if an area is nuked..all of the flora..will then turn into nuked flora..which is raw flux..to convert it to stable flux..which is used with making and game items such as serums and armor..and u need a chemistry station along with other materials in a nuke zone..to convert it to stable flux..the only way u can drop flux (if you die) is if it is in a stable state..when it is raw..it is in your aid items..but not after u convert it..also..raw flux is very valuable..if u have the perk to get better sales at vendors..it will sell for 8 caps..and if u have green thumb equipped..u will pick up 2x the flora..so..if u think about it..a normal flower or flora can sell for 1 cap..with those two perks I just mentioned you are basically gaining a 1600% value increase for raw flux..these can be obtained in a nuke zone and is still avail even a couple hours after the nuke zone clears up
---
I think Bethesda should reward players for sticking around through all of the issues with a few power armor paints!! 
---
The Military Wing of the Whitespring Bunker usually has a few. 
---
I usually turn in two at a time.  Once or twice a day during my daily vendor runs.  
---
As a Lewisburg resident, I have to agree with you. Everyone here is a fucking socialist hippy that charges way too much for everything 
---
Yup. It’s good. 
---
Exactly. Has to be a bug. I don't think I've ever seen a normal spawn in the forest of anything over 15. Even after multiple workshop defence events.
---
Why are their blood splatters on the floor?  Is that police brutality?  I see an unarmed Mutant and far too many police officers...
---
Also, fuck Jim Justice. 
---
Yeah, it happens to everyone. For some reason when it becomes a quest item, the quantity gets removed. Apparently turning in 2 gives you slightly more stimpaks or something than turning in one, but from everything I read more than two doesnt seem to have an effect.
---
If it wasnt for someone pointing that out, id say the quest erases all of them but one. Havent verified a change in rewards personally.
---
Its dumb you cant turn in multiples at a time
---
We saved him from mole rats!
---
What is your strength? I think that strength increases base weapon damage, and then perks increase that damage.
---
No, it is all good. I got your point, and I hope no one takes it offensive. It wasn't in my intent to point too much focus on the accent, other than to shed light on a bit of detail towards the speaker's identity which I couldn't point out.
---
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
---
&gt; Would be nice if we could build one of those machines in camp, but have to put food in to get the preserved food out.
---
My favorite machine in Fallout 4 is the one I can put dead raiders into and get cans of Soylent Green out of.
---
Best mod.
---
Hand over the chestcam footage...
---
They’re really expensive, and the owners are terrible people, but I’ll be damned if it’s not a beautiful place to be. Everything’s pretty pricey, but it’s got some outstanding food
---
&gt;Its dumb you cant turn in multiples at a time.  
---
While annoying, it would be way too easy to complete the quest dozens of times per day if you could turn them in one at a time.
---
17? 
---
I lost 96 of them.
---
Pipe revolvers benefit from pistol and rifle perks, and the reload is quite manageable with quick hands and speed demon. I’d say they are more powerful than lever action rifles, but are held back by their lack of legendary effects.
---
Just another oversite from a Dev team that seemed to do little to no play testing.
---
Flatwoods for responders
---
Top of the world for Raiders
---
Watoga for bos
---
Whitesprings for enclave
---
Tech data doesnt stack for the mission. And from the looks of it the mission only activates on new tech data you pick up after you finish the quest. So in otherwords anything you had been gathering while you progressed didnt count. 
---
The hardest part about living here is there’s not much to do, and most of the residents are either the forced yokel hillbilly (by this I mean the accent is clearly fake and exaggerated, but in 20 years I still haven’t figured out why they do it. Don’t forget the big trucks, guns and trump either) or a pretentious socialist hippy who are so far left about everything and shove it down your throat, until it comes to their money, in which case they’re some of the greediest people you’ll meet
---
They do let you respec. It's called leveling after 50.
---
Hear hear
---
Gauss rifle has decent durability, as does Tesla rifle.
---
They haven't, at least as far as I know said they had plans to offer a full respec. Though I'm not sure why it's necessary. I'm level 121 and have over 30 perk points in the bank. Also TSE weapons are still powerful even after the nerf, and it's not like a TSE build looked any different then a non-tse build. The only thing you might want to alter is your intelligence if you don't want demolition expert anymore in favour of something else, but you can fix in a couple of levels, not 50.
---
To do it the "natural way":
---
Go to west tek (fast travel, go around the building to the back door).
---
Go inside, theres a bunch of vats of toxic goo. You can collect as much as you want, and drinking it gives you 100+ rads.
---
Do that and stand next to a decontamination shower (theres one in west tek on the second floor). Just rinse off the rads when you get close to dying. Just remember after you get one mutation to start swapping on and off starched genes before you get in and out the shower (ill admit this part SUUUCKS)
---
If you do get a mutation, I think theres a cooldown to where you wont get a new one. I think if you change servers it clears the cooldown.
---
Because I dump excess legendaries in his cash register, and you know others do too. 
---
Did you ask thr air speed velocity of a swallow? 
---
Radshield doesn't suppress mutations iirc. 
---
lol weird, the super mutants who walk into my camp always shoot from a far, outside of my CAMP's green circle. They're shooting so far away that my missile turret wont even shoot back at them.
---
Yeah I based it off the original poster. But it's also my first person I have ever drawn lol Thanks for that reference image though I saved it for future reference! 
---
&gt; That's true - can't run a grocery store if you stock spoils every 24 IRL hours
---
Well... IRL grocery stores have extensively complicated logistics that go into keeping fresh produce and other perishables on the shelves.
---
Picking or hunting your food hunter/gatherer style would decrease the shelf life significantly. 
---
Canning or refrigeration would be needed to keep this stuff fresh enough to eat.
---
I didn't say I don't understand PVP. I said I don't understand why people keep trying to fight me. This guy was 40+ levels above me. I thought he wanted the titanium, but he never took the workshop.
---
I’m from a neighboring county and that fucker got every power truck to come to his dumbass resort to get it running for the golf tournament. Our county didn’t have power for at least a week because every truck was stuck there. Not to mention how he thinks he’s royalty, like when he belittled the police officer asking him if he knew who he was and that’s why he didn’t deserve a ticket. 
---
Yeah so it will be available again in 20 real hours
---
Bloodied explosive is seeing a lot of love around the markets these days, furious heavy weapons are also quite good... But TSEs are still viable and effective. 
---
I built my camp inside on of those Electric Power Towel that already had a wreck camp inside (tents, cooler, duffel bags etc). It’s raised above the ground and I get random food items. I rarely get attacked and when I do, it’s always one single enemy. 
---
I’m glad I finally stopped getting attacked by scorched beasts, super mutants and mole rats. I rarely have to fix anything nowadays. 
---
I wish you were on Xbox, I’d ask where I can volunteer! 
---
Gross, but it would pair nicely with the cannibalism perk.
---
I got stuck here too. I just spammed the talk button, relogged, and spammed talk again. Took quite a bit but it finally worked. Happened to me twice during that quest chain
---
I'm gonna play What's New Pussy Cat?  7 times followed by 1 It's Not Unusual
---
How are they not lore friendly? They are just paint. 
---
Where do you turn them in?
---
Yeah one bad piece of whatever will spoil the bunch..this applies to vegetables and fruit too..so if u have soup that is close to spoiling and ur crafting more..eat it or sell it..otherwise..the new soup will also start in the same condition of the others 
---
the WS jumpsuit 
---
That would be great.  I miss that place in the days of vanilla.
---
I already respecced twice. Don't intend to level up and do it again because they changed things around.
---
Also, it has nothing to do with tse. I don't really care about that. It's about their system they currently have in place and how trash it is.
---
This is the only mmo ive come across that doesn't allow a complete respec and its asinine.
---
Don’t let that stop you! Spread the good deeds to Xbox!
---
Mysteriously, he’s the only human NPC in the game.  He’s all about that action and doesn’t wanna chit chat about it.
---
A cicada? The thing you here in summertime maybe idk that's what I usually hear in background on game
---
We need Gwent
---
I think i know who's house u were ..when I was there there were like 10 others there all trading
---
If want I can tag along with ya on your quests, probably can make ya some armour and a rifle
---
Yeah, but you can dig treasure as many times as you have maps. The maps give you better loot than forbidden knowledge 95% of the time.
---
Ok, completing the quest gives you 250 xp each time you turn it in, where youd get a bunch of xp all at once if you could turn in multiples. Im still getting the same amount of xp over the timespan, its just broken into smaller pieces. Its just forcing me to go out of my way to turn it in asap, before I find another document.
---
This is the funniest game video I have ever seen.
---
Bruh I paid 150 per serum today
---
Cry 
---
You literally said you wanted to respec because they nerfed tse. Now you're saying you actually don't care about that and just want to respec because respec. Something tells me you just want something to whine about.
---
I'm in favor of it because Whitesprings is over farmed  and boring.  Whitesprings be fun if you were the only person on the server, but you're not so you have to share it with a dozen other people all running around clamoring for a couple of ghoul kills. It's like Walmart the day before Christmas, two hundred people climbing over each other for a TV. You don't need to farm Whitesprings, there are monsters all over Appalachia, go explore.
---
After about 30 seconds and a quick history search you’re making up BS, you’ve never formed a sub at all. 
---
I just got a weightless combat leg turning in a technical document. It weighs 2.7 lbs. WTF? Theres no mods on it...
---
Razorgrain soup ftw. As a vego it gives me 60hp 20% food and 15% water as well as 10 disease resistance but ain't nothin stopping rad worms
---
I want to see it, where is it and what platform do you play on
---
https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/26/thq-nordic-8chan-ama-but-why/
---
I'll post photos of my camp and hopefully catch some baddies casually walking around my camp when I get on later
---
THANK YOU. I swear, people are trying to be as inconvenient as possible sometimes
---
that "i hope your not mad" really shows how you were just trying to have a bit of fun.
---
Just seen this..no not at all..u def should have melee perks..for when enemies are too close..or when u are fighting the quicker smaller enemies like mole rats ticks and radrats..the sniper/melee build is extremely common and well-liked
---
Hummm i am level 47 and i got to "I am become death" soooooo, could a level 20-30 nuke you 😂?
---
Then if Bethesda does such, they would have to make the grind even bigger than it already is, therefore triggering again fo76's hell. So in theory would be a good idea, but it shouldn't be their main focus if they don't have the right conditions for it. 
---
I dont see why, the more the merrier. Even if they feed off the drop it only helps em out without taking from those without high levels 
---
I’ll help you out but I’m done for the night.
---
PSN maxpowers_69
---
;)
---
I used AA ,explosive,furious even a damn Fatman lol nothing till adds died then AA was eating her hp. We had so many adds tho. I think ya could have walked from v9 to the shed and never stepped in grass there were so many meat piles and bodies. 
---
What are you actually even talking about? Yikes.
---
Thanks bro I should be on tomorrow night late
---
Oh wow. Jug your videos are great! Really handy stuff!!!
---
Another run i tried to keep track and it seemed the add waves came every 2-5 min or so. So this goes towards mechanics. But I'm still unsure. It still fun. If ya not attached to your ammo in an unhealthy way. Exp galore lol!
---
*Seems someone needs THE CHOPPER COPS*
---
I need more finger gun emotes
---
So if you pick up more than one it actually counts? In your inventory it says that you only have 1 technical data. 
---
A thank you and here take this would be good
---
Original plan per the Todd: November 2019 would be private servers, pvp servers and mods. As you know pvp servers are coming out a lot sooner than planned, complete silence on mods and privates.
---
Wrong. Its about the current system in place and how trash it is.
---
Any other top mmo on the market right now allows you to respec. You don't need to grind levels to change points, then grind levels to get perks, etc...
---
Trying out new builds is grind grind grind. It's stale as hell, and asinine.
---
Great
---
Hmm... its the only place to get it that I know of I farm it every day ive sold whole suits for about 1000 caps some times less or just trade it for some 5.56 ammo lol depending on how generous I feel
---
No. Resources will definitely be an issue. It's a shame that junk takes up any space in stash, although I don't think it should be unlimited but when you compare the data used to track junk, description, quantity and weight is nothing compared to the data used for power armor, 6 separate pieces with applied mods, weight, condition of each piece. And that would be nothing compared to actually displaying a suit of armor. Even if it's static the amount of camp budget used will make turrets pale in comparison. 
---
What spooks me is that I can't see how they can decorate your camp without maintaining it still in you inventory, meaning it'll take up space in BOTH your stash AND camp budget. 
---
YES! ALSO PIPES
---
I like how your undercover agent looks, very natural
---
Brewing Refreshments Alcoholic Style (B.R.A.S.)
---
That happened to me and they refunded the atoms. It actually happened twice for 800 atoms each but the second time I recorded it for proof. They refunded all 1600. I only asked for 800 since I had a video and I started to like the patriot paint
---
... Now i want weekly episodes of Live Appalachia PD...
---
"Let's go live to Watoga where Officers MonkeyNutz and DieNewbDie have once again been called to a drunk Phoenix attack local government workers..."
---
8 in each stat would be average. Lots of people min/max. Melee max Strength and Ranged max Perception and Agility. VATS crit builds max Luck. Personally I run a super-duper do max weight reduction crafting at S:11 P:7 E:2 C:7 I:15 A:6 L:8. I use all weapons well being high enough level to have all the perks and swap in any perk to make me effective with any weapon.
---
I still rock a TSE lever action and can 1-4 shot almost everything, so while nerfed, still viable 
---
Haven't played forever but pick up any fans, typewriters, clipboards, etc you see those gears n springs will come in handy
---
Yeah like I said, you just want to whine. Nobody gives a hooping funt if you log on ever again. If you want to tweak your build you grind it out, it's how the game works. If you don't like it that's alright, it ain't for everyone. 
---
you should refund the game. 
---
Average character would probably want to carry as much as possible to makeup for low stash. High str for weight reduction perks and carry weight. More stuff yay
---
Buff jetpack: add hover mode
---
You might be onto something. We tried to fight her tonight, got her down to 1/3 health and all of a sudden she was nowhere, looked on the map and she was at drop site v2. So I tell everyone to go to v2 and she is Soo far in the air just hovering than no bullets will even hit her. Ugh at least I fixed my addrealine reaction
---
Also, depending on your build, a full set of BOS modded heavy combat armor in either a Vanguard's or Bolstering can come insanely close to power armor levels of damage resistance, just not the rad resistance. Add sentinel to all the pieces and you're a tank in human form
---
yeah it is no mans sky all over again. people need to learn some times just give a game time. and atleast here they didn't lie.
---
When I tried doing this with a friend, lower levels ran away. And we kept telling them that we were there to help🤣🤣
---
I subsist on soup, juice, and sundry meats. I stop by camp and make a few items before I start off adventuring and it keeps me sustained the rest of the session

Ghouls drop radaways like crazy, and the pharma farmer perk is good to. At level 23 your options are limited, but there's the medical center on the southern tip of the forest near the Ash Heap. For caps go kill super mutants, not only do they drop them but they also drop assault rifles which you can sell to vendors for roughly 20 caps a piece. You can also plant loads of crops at your camp and make food and drinks to sell to vendors and clean them all out on a daily basis.
---
Any comfirmation on where to get the little cooler?
---
oh man, that totally sucks
---
I lucked into Grahm tonight and held him with another character.  With relogging I got all the other plans I was missing (Mirror Ball, Metal Picnic Table, Stone Bench..Sledgehammer also) but never saw Radiation Emitter.  i've seen multiple people claim it can also be found in the Penitentiary and to 'search Youtube'.  I can't find any reference to it in the Prison.

Fellow Mire neighbor here. I agree, it's a  nice place to live.  equidistant from Whiteprings/Watoga so it's right in my loot route.  It's quiet,  only a couple of bugs but lots and lots of flowing water around for water purifiers.  Hardly ever get enemy spawns but they are usually scortched or super mutants when they do.  Have to lock my place up because the enemy usually can work doors no problem.  But I have a full player workbench/bed set up outside for those wandering by.  
---
I was wondering why this wasn't there from the begining (sounds like it was but got removed).  I put down a welcome mat only to have it just welcome monsters into my CAMP did nothing else for me.  Vote me in for a Fast Travel Welcome Mat!
---
That sounds cool - I'll have to play around with it!
---
I lol'd when  you said "now I must eat every single omelette alone and think about this failure"
---
Read up now and research the perk cards and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats you want based on how your play style will be. otherwise you'll have to burn level-ups fixing and respec-ing it later.
---
I do something similar, but my spread is s14 p12 e3 c4 i12 a3 l8 , I can use any weapon effectively other than pistols, and can't use vats (live in my PA anyway) really like running around with 10mm SMGs as they're hitting about 80% as hard as my handmade, weigh only 6.3 with my loadout and perforating mags have 30 shots. Highly recommend 10mm smg to everyone always lol
---
Because someone can easily shoot you in the face,steal all your junk and they might even just destroy everything for the heck of it
---
Damn I wish the PDs near me acted in this altruistic manner 
---
Just watched this. Almost pissed myself. Great job Jug! 
---
Nope
---
Is this with the power armor camp or combat armor in atom shop???????????
---
S9 P9 E6 C6 I6 A9 L11
---
S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
This is just a guess, but maybe legendaries weight a bit more?
---
I am intersted. How much?
---
Well they already promised us private servers so it'll definitely happen, and they likely try to sell a number of said servers themselves at a higher price so they'll get additional revenue from that.  Rust has a cash shop and does private dedicated servers as well, so it can be done successfully.
---
1. already suggested like a thousand times  
---
2. there's a mod to do that
---
I’m on Xbox, otherwise I’d send goons out to distract you while I try to steal the priceless diamond. 
---
Haha awesome. I love watching all your build videos. Thanks for sharing
---
I seem to recall a location (one of the ski lodges?) that have some stills and terminal entries about brewing with the new plants. I wonder if this will feature in the new quests.
---
The premier cuisine of the common wealth!

It's the community team, not developers. They can't answer any real  questions.
---
-Every Citizen Since the Dawn of Law Enforcement
---
They don't aim that high. Their target is to get a couple of new quests and one-two new items. They never said this is a huge project. In their minds, the atom shop is the content we want.
---
It's probably the heavy combat armor variant. Standard, sturdy, heavy.
---
Yup.But don't say this on reddit, you'll get downvoted to hell.
---
Good Luck
---
I’ll do these once I get online tomorrow thanks! 
---
Could you make a discord  and create 3 branches PC PS4 and Xbox. You could also work on stopping duped items if they return
---
Any medical facility should have a stash of radaway and stimpacks and any Responders camp should have medical facilities and tents. At L23 you should be comfortable hitting up the Responders facilities in Morgantown and Flatwoods. There's also a hospital west of Charleston by the power plant, a pharmaceutical company north of Helvetia and a responders vendor on the west side of Grafton. Another thing to check out are raiders camps. They'll frequently spawn chem containers which will also contain stimpacks, water and radaway along with the usual Psycho and Buffout.
---
I hope you’re right. It would be glorious!
---
This just isn't commonly true. Maybe 10% of the time at best. In general better level means better gear, more flushed out Perk cards and point distribution, modded armor and PA along with mutations and experience.
---
I agree with where you are coming from, but if someone is 65 i assume they are just beginning to really understand their builds and have enough caps to have the things they want
---
&gt; Gross, but it would pair nicely with the cannibalism perk.
---
It *is* gross, luckily I have a very juvenile sense of humor. 
---
As an applachian firefighter. I'm sorry you guys couldn't pass the test. The firefighters entrance exam that is hahaaaaaa. Just kidding have fun out there.
---
I think you just got lucky. I got booted 2 times today and lost all my workshop stuff twice. 
---
Move to a different server. The ammo workshop attracts pvp people.
---
Don't shoot back. Move to another server
---
Unfortunately no all you can do is leave the server and join a new one or kick there a$$. When you agree to claim a workshop you are agreeing to pvp pacifist only makes it so you can’t shoot people on accident. Hope this helps
---
Nope, I checked. I edited the post to add in that explanation.
---
What about super sledge? The only advantage of fire axe is the mod that adds armor piercing.
---
This, I did not know!!!! Thanks for the info.
---
At your level, I'd recommend getting PA before going to Whitespring, and a shotgun to cripple legs. Charred ghouls will give you about 30 rads per slap if you're not wearing PA.
---
Groups of ghouls will spawn in the golf club, and around the apartments. I've found that they frequently drop rad-x and radaway.
---
:D 
---
I'd like a crying emote.

He looks *fucking ready*
---
I've been to Ordos Kangbashi district and it was pretty cool. Although it was more more populated compared to when all those ghost city articles were written about it.
---
Hilarious :D
---
Do you have any main quests? If you do, you probably completed it and didn’t notice. Are you on the quests at the free states bunker?
---
It's funny because of PvP balance, the lvl 60 is more powerful than  a lvl 246. A long time ago, after the EXP glitch ,when i was level 40-something, i killed a lvl 500+ a few times with only ONE hit.
---
It's been solved I just had to reset fallout 76
---
Pretty cool guys. Now can we get live bodycam footage and put it on Live PD? I can just picture a Ghoul getting shaken down for his Psycobuff. 
---
Yeah, but they hotfixed the Bobby Pin revert, Known Plans on same profile characters, and Bulk Scrapping.  What was the difference with that one?
---
Not for me (PS4).  Back in the Fall I was really taking my time exploring the map so by the time I first did the Brotherhood quest line I had a stack of 12 chilling in my stash.  I always just do it right away for free chems but I've 100% have had 2-3 on a few occasion recently still.  There is one spot I know of that is nearly guaranteed but it's late and I can take a pic of a small stack for ya tomorrow.
---
Any chance you maybe tossed them in your stash cleaning up your inventory or something?
---
If he has the shop he doesn't have to shoot back for PvP to be initiated. If one person on the other team starts the claim process, the owner is flagged as hostile to that team, and vice versa. 
---
The game is a lot more fun and rewarding with friends. 
---
Join "The Brotherhood of Steel", Discord group not faction in game. 
---
We are always looking for new recruits and are a bunch of helpful, friendly players from all over the world. 
---
Location seems to effect this more than anything.  I've got one spot where I never get randomly attacked and my friend refuses to move his CAMP until he gets attacked, been there for over a month.  Both of us use generators and have crops growing.
---
Wood. Whenever you come across a log or woodpile, gather as much as possible. You will need it for both building CAMPs,modifications and cooking. As well as for boiling water until you get a purifier going. 
---
Part of me thinks it would be great fun to have players become the DJ and speak freely and all that. But that's me knowing I would use it for good to spread cheer and what not through the wasteland.

Though, uh, we can all imagine how it would go 95% of the time, SCP Secret Lab anyone?

I've seen 3 different sack hoods at pleasant valley station. Sutton is also ok. Regular, with hoses, and another one.
---
I built and scrapped 14 radium rifles today and got 1 mod, which was worse than the others I had. 
---
Related to that, I thought that if you made 10 of the same thing, you could scrap all of them at the same time and increase your chances of getting a mod. I should swear that i've done that with something. 
---
Am I dreaming that up?
---
Good hunting.

The overseers holo tape says Evan is a scorched, so he can’t be the purveyor.

/u/valseek did comment on it and said they were looking into it and at the very least the "Hangry" effect wasn't intended
---
Cheers peeps, really appreciate all tips and advice so far 
---
The weightless effect on both guns and armor is buggy as hell. 
---
My guess is that it's gaining weight from a "mod", specifically "standard".  Obviously this shouldn't be happening, but something is making it weigh more. 
---
Part of he Brotherhood questline in the mire!
---
don't claim the munitions factory, it is the most contested workshop on the map
---
You do occasionally get on the same server after a disconnect or relog. I got on the same one twice today while farming Watoga. This has always been the case. 
---
I'm level 257 and I swear everyone around my level has just vanished from the servers I go on at least. 
---
The next time you login, it won't be showing the positive effects.
---
Damn. I wish i had a PvP build or a friend who did to rekt them. They got like 300caps off me :/
---
also if someone pisses you off like this just leave the server 
---
I hate raiders. 
---
Yea it happens and cap loss is scaled to level just so you know
---
Not all "leaders" are "alphas".  Just because something has a crown icon (labeling them a 'boss' for an encounter) doesn't make them an "alpha".  Normal 'leaders' don't spawn in other enemies at all, they are simply the 'boss' for an encounter, I think.  I've never seen normal 'leaders' (aka, bosses) cause any additional spawning.
---
There is a non-marked quest to get some raider power armor under the bridge. Level up your lockpicking to level two first. This is the only PA you can wear at level 15.

I've tried to engage in friendly, legitimate, and non-malicious PvP. With as much scorn as I've gotten, being called a duper and a griefer when all I did was hit a player once just to see if I could tell which players actually play with pacifist mode off, I'm more than willing to go all in with a raider attitude. And honestly if the PvE crowd wants to see PvP as nothing but a community griefers, I'm already guilty by association. There's really little keeping me from finding ways to be courteous about PvP anymore. 
---
Mother forking shirtballs!
---
They would probably need to revise Obsidians notes , they're the only developer to successfully integrate in game activities in a fun and productive way in the FO verse. 
---
Yes, all junk in your stash is available at any work bench you find in the world. Work benches will also prioritize what's in your immediate inventory over anything in your stash.
---
Radway is the new silicone.
---
There's a chance of rare plans from them.
---
Elaborate? What type of rare plans
---
What bridge? Thanks for the heads up
---
Sell the chems you aren't going to use.
---
Since you can only use one at a time, they really stack up and weigh you down. I am constantly going through my junk and selling chems I would have otherwise kept in any of the other fallout games.
---
I cannot stress this enough. Things that work tend to be variants of psycho. The rest are mostly trash/situational and they stack up fast.
---
I feel like they nerfed 2 shot too hard, like it feels like you might as well use the standard variant of a gun rather then a 2 shot variant
---
There's a key if you can find it...
---
The difference was WHY all those things reverted.  When they compiled that patch one of the programmers was working off an outdated build and ended up partially overwriting a whole bunch of shit from the previous patches. This meant not only minor things like bobby pin weight but huge things like some of the early dupe fixes reverted and God knows what else under the hood was messed up that we didn't know about. They had to rush that hotfix because the very stability of the live build was at stake from being a Frankenstein of different patch versions. 
---
Well the 100% way to prevent this is to not claim the Munitions Factory. I know it's not the answer you wanna hear but with the current system they have it's the only way. I would however recommed the Grafton Steel Mill if you need ballistic ammo. Has two steel and one lead extractor and tons of muties with gunpowder, you may still run into the same problem though so just have to stay paraniod. Hopefully Bethesda changes it so you arnt entered into PVP when your on the other side of the map.

One of the few occasions my boyfriend was watching me (he doesn't want to spoil the experience for when he can afford it) and we both just fucking lost it. The whole thing had us giggling but that was the last straw.
---
I don't understand how the mongrels and brain dead ghouls, scorched, and mutants keep getting inside my house. I put max locks on everything. Doors, windows, etc. Still, atleast one of them always finds their way inside. I need a better locksmith. 
---
Generally if I see someone over level 150, I just assume they're a PvE only player. Those kinds of players aren't going to engage in PvP unless you're right in front of them at their workshop contesting it. A good amount of the extended PvP fights I've been in tend to happen along level 70-110. You have most of your convenience perks around there, your build is set, your gear was likely pre-farmed/traded for, modded by a main, mutations farmed or serums crafted, and PA just has close to zero utility in PvP. There's just too much liability to do PvP at too high a level. 
---
Personally I've only gotten camp plans (sorry can't remember which), but here's a good breakdown of what you can get:
---
https://np.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a187r9/psa_try_to_save_your_treasure_maps_for_higher/
---
Depends on your level and your build. Early on as you are accumulating stuff you want to take perks like bandolier and thru hiker.
---
Once you get to level 100 or so you should start carrying around only what you need and free up some space for damage maximization by taking off the weight reduction perks. The damage bonus perks hit different special stats so it depends on what you want.
---
The current meta is melee, there's a combination of perks you can take that lets you do serious DPS on the SBQ when she's on the ground, even if you don't have any particularly sexy legendary weapons. That build works best with str 13-15, meaning you have to minimize something else.
---
If you want to use mutations (like in the melee build) you'll need starched genes and class freak, those are luck perks.
---
Thank you. Wish they put some sort of cool down on trying to clain workshops so you cant just repeatedly do this.
---
Not a problem if we just C.A.M.P. the place.
---
Does it work to just drop all but one in a bag at your feet and then just keep turning them in one at a time?
---
I'm dead center of all 7 vendors on a junk resource node. I'll take the attacks 😂
---
Like if you fail to claim the first time. 2nd attempt has a 5min cool down before you initiate and it keep going up as you keep attempting.
---
The big one. You'll know it when you see it, and it's on the map.
---
oh right
---
They just spawn inside my fence, if anything it makes it harder for me to protect my adhesive farm. They need to hurry up and add in planters so I can move it upstairs lol.
---
Or use the good with salt perk and preserve food in your inventory by 90% 
---
Actually a really great idea!
---
yeah i have a stack that i can't turn in. Was quite disappointed since i'd been saving them forever and even buying them at vendors when i saw them.
---
Currently closing in on 700 hrs of play in fo76. As I see it the only thing left to do is collect god tier items to trade for other god tier items that I don’t have. And the best place to do that is the whitespring. If you know of a better place then please let me know.
---
Tonight I tried server hopping and both times wound up on the same server I started from...
---
I usually find spoiled vegetables. 
---
i have gotten actual power armor plans for like t45 legs arms ect.. from them
---
Yeah that's normal. I recorded a little bit of the end of a queen run we did just now. Pause at frame 1 of the video. You can see how much damage me and my friend lend to the team, we practically carry any group there. I don't even have a prime receiver, too cheap to run it. He runs a 50 cal, probably has higher dps but the trick is the syringer, stabilized, one gun army, adrenaline and the str perks for heavy gun without explosive.
---
I wish more people would run armor bypass perks for their gun and have a endangerol syringer. It would make things so fast. [https://youtu.be/3KGQARCiy3s](https://youtu.be/3KGQARCiy3s)
---
Thank you. Hopefully they do something like that. 
---
Unfortunately it just kind of depends on the player and how many caps they have on them. For example, I see someone else in this thread thinks 500 caps would be fair and another who implies that they find the letters worthless.
---
As a camp enthusiast, I'd probably pay up to 2,000 caps for the plan. I paid almost 10K for the neon letters and my budget is so full I could only spell "HELLO!" in neon. Totally worth it.
---
“You should have got bird bones”
---
This is correct. It also awards 25 or 40 caps respectively. 
---
The script only discriminates between 'one' and 'two or more'.
---
It seems to have no bearing on the 'quality' of the items it rewards.
---
Originally it was possible to have a friend 'feed' you copies two at a time - by dropping them on a paper bag for instance - and you could just feed them to the box.
---
I have not tested myself, friends quit playing, I already have all the rewards that can be legitimately obtained from that quest and more effective means to acquire distilled water, stimpacks and 1* legendaries but apparently this somewhat desirable behaviour was patched rather swiftly and with extreme prejudice.
---
but why.gif
---
That one belongs there. However, while I love the Beach Boys, 'Wouldn't it Be Nice' firts neither thematically nor in the Fallout Universe's timeline (difference from ours starting around 1944)
---
I haven't used one since beta. Now im a lvl 200+ thinking I should try using them. 
---
Your gamer tag is spidemonkeyy? I usually get on in the morning since I work the night shift but I'll probably be on at 2:00pm on Fridays and Saturdays. You have a mic?
---
Thank you, I didnt think about standard being a potential cause. Next time I get on ill try changing it to see what happens.
---
Me too, lol. 
---
If you've got lots don't spam them! Hit the plot and let it all load in. Wait until everything you get from each hit stops scrolling across the screen before taking the next hit. You can (unless it's been patched) bug your character if you just spam all your maps at once. Better be safe than sorry.
---
And make weapons last longer I'm sick of running around for junk to fix them every 5 minutes.
---
id rather have fridges tbh
---
This happens sometimes. If you really need to be on a new server I just reboot my console (xb1)
---
Not to mention legendary scrapping and recycling. 
---
Thanks, really loving the tips, and preferred locations to build camp?
---
The early dupe fixes weren't revert.  The fact that you'd even bring up this misinformation calls into question your whole argument.
---
I heard that before and its actually why I haven't used this. I've had this character since the first day of beta. Im a little attached. 
---
I figured the whitesprings already took that position, it's just there's never enough people on a server at once for it to be viable, although I personally like the second floor of top of the world, I think that would be cool place for people to congregate and trade stuff.
---
It’s because they can clip through your foundation. The AI doesn’t seem to know that our walls and foundations/floors are places they shouldn’t spawn. Which is a real shame. Kind of ruins any possible defense you could set up. 
---
Enemies can also walk up any foundation block, because Bethesda attached invisible stairs to them. Hence how rats and roaches can so easily get to and chew our walls. Oh wel. 
---
Right now all workshops are attracting pvp. People are just using it to farm caps. Sure this will change when the pvp modes come out. 
---
The mic one is dumb.  But the rest seem good.
---
should make it so players can choose factions (maybe based off outfits), cops, raiders, etc. or maybe once players hit a certain level. And a diff player gets chosen each day, from whichever faction has the high score controls a radio station (for a week or month), high score can be based off workshops held by each faction, scorchbeast kills, random enemy kills, wanted players killed, total caps earned, number of daily/weekly challenges completed, or any other number of ways. 
---
They can then use their mic to say whatever (within reason), and yeah pick songs and such. I really like the idea and it'd give people more end game content and a reason to keep playing.
---
Rebuild America! But before that we kill each other even though we lived for many many years in a vault and are the only ones there. 
---
Schemers trying to control their little worlds.
---
Just kidding, I love the idea, although I secretly wish I could become your antagonist 🤡
---
the first thing I would do as Appalachias DJ is be like "soo... uhh... " talk just like the dork from FO4 lol
---
I am level 148 and i feel people avoid me lol. I went to a workshop looking for a trade because i saw 3 players there and they just moved servers when they saw me. I didnt even started a pvp. 
---
I have checked the post you linked and in my experience after 100s of these used in every region and spot I am fairly confident that you cannot get legendaries from them.
---
Maybe you could at one point, many things have gotten the ~~nerf~~ 'rebalance' treatment since release, but not anymore.
---
Said that in my opinion they are still great little things. I have obtained many chems to feed my habit and many many 'free' weapon /armor mod unlocks by scrapping the items they yield.
---
The Cranberry Bog ones - and to a lesser degree The Mire ones - often yield things like ultracite pistols and radium rifles which are damned 'expensive' to craft just to immediately scrap to learn mods.
---
Thats the reason why i run good doggy and only eat Dog food. Cannot spoil and fairly common to find. I always cook too much, never eating it before it spoils. 
---
Ah nice find.
---
I'd also like to have pip-boy game holotape "Ghouls vs. Tatos".
---
Buy mutations you want. 
---
Well, the other combat armor mods weigh at least as much as Standard. I think what happens here is that Standard has a non-zero weight modifier, and weightless only applies to the base weight, even though that's unachievable in practice.
---
a level 150 something female with white shirt on flew through the air and exploded me in one shot earlier, quite annoying. Wish only people within 10 levels of each other could attack you
---
I ran into two of you guys about a week back. You frisked me and asked if Iv seen any dirty dupers since I was building one of those stacked concrete bunkers. good times
---
Yeah its great! 
---
Yeah, I don't think that works unfortunately. You have to do them one at a time. It can be a crushing experience haha
---
Don't worry about repairing your stuff until you start using legendaries. It's just easier to pickup new weapons and armor when they break. Take workshops when you run across them, and do the defend quest you get shortly after, you'll get useful stuff for it. When you get a plan go to your pipboy under "notes" consume it and sell ones you already know. Adhesive, Springs, Screws, Aluminum are your new masters, collect them, hoard them, worship them. Plastic is important too. Super mutants and cryptids drop the best loot. Don't fear the high levels, if one approaches you they probably want to give you things. 
---
Thats right. There should be no pacifist setting for babies or slap damage nonsense. Full pvp death match or get out of my game. 
---
Right ?
---
They are like trading cards yes? So why not let us trade then with each other?
---
I didn’t. That’s extremely disappointing, and I look like an ass now XD
---
Yup!
---
There can only be one. His name is Grahm.
---
all vendors have the same amount of caps, 200. certain vendors are connected to a faction, meaning they share the same amount of caps. for example, if you sell stuff to a responder vendor and it has 0 caps, every other responder bot will have 0 caps. same goes for the raider, and the vendors in white springs. there are other vendors that are connected to a faction but they don’t share caps with any other vendor. hope this helps :) 
---
Agree. I ain't buying any of those colored FACE tattoos because i don't wanna end up lookin like Tekashi 69.
---
If there's a tribal tattoo all over my body I'd get it in a heartbeat and wear a shirtless outfit.
---
Plastic is gold in this game. 
---
[It still looks pretty cool](https://imgur.com/8MCyPZj)
---
I use them relatively often... As long as you don't spam a single spot many times in a few seconds you'll be good. Like I said, if you wait until all the loot stops scrolling on the screen after each hit you should be good. Give it a good 1-2 minutes between hit and smooth sailing!
---
Whatever you want to believe dumbfuck.  You wanted to know why they rushed that patch and I told you the exact reason why.  
---
Bethesda explained exactly what went wrong to require that hotfix, a bad merger using an outdated build overwrote enough important shit that Bethesda was freaked out enough to pay for a rushed cert and get everything properly patched asap.  That's leagues beyond "people are pissed because a single mutation stopped working" and that's why you fuckers have to wait for the next actual patch instead of bitching that they won't treat a single fucking mutation with the same urgency as a patchwork live build.
---
Badass :)
---
I got banned and have called and submitted tickets. Still nothing looks like they dont care. They got their money. I've been posting stuff on YouTube about their home office and the lawsuit against them 
---
This...  Then again those turrets dont really do anything anyway. 
---
noooooo i have 40 corn 40 tato and 40 mutfruit and 8 carrots..with speed demon i go through a LOT of water and food...i craft like 150 soups and juices at a time to keep.me.going through one play sesssion..come to think of it i could do with a bit less plants lol
---
Go to www.nukedragons.com and it will allow you to play with all the options for SPECIAL perks. 
---
Imagine 25 people in the whole server tryin to talk to Preston Garvey and everytime you click him, the game tells you that he is busy right now, try again later.
---
And then it comes to this part where one person can't wait any longer and start "don't stab people while they shop" just like what the vendor bot said... 
---
Long story short, there's a bloodbath fight in front of Preston Garvey and he's just standing there enjoying the view.
---
I somehow doubt that; only a small fraction of the encounters I have had were with people that would embrace the idea of engaging on PvP with other players that were ready and willing to shoot back.
---
In most cases when they realised that all was not what it seemed they hastily moved on.
---
Hi!, first of all, which platform? PC, PS4, XB1?....
---
Jumarox is my IGN, i play on PC, add me if you want, im lvl 149. Casual player from Uruguay. 
---
so exactly what's on the roadmap for summer then 
---
I currently have 3240 atoms saved up for the four horsemen of the apocalypse paints
---
It has nothing to do with believing.
---
They didn't explain "exactly" what went wrong.  They gave a broad and vague explanation.  You actually have no idea if they actually had to pay for a rushed cert and if they even managed to properly patch things after the hotfix.
---
I'm saying that the mutation being left in a broken state is unacceptable.  It should have never been left that way before they pushed out P6.  Forcing players to clear the mutation and then re-acquire it is unreasonable.
---
&gt;Not all "leaders" are "alphas". Just because something has a crown icon (labeling them a 'boss' for an encounter) doesn't make them an "alpha".
---
I thought the loading screen tip referred to these crowned bosses. Perhps I've been mistaken.
---
Stereotypical much
---
I managed to get to 550 today, I spend them pretty liberally but only on Camp stuff. I’m saving this week to see what they add next week cause no new stuff this week :(
---
Early on diseases are a problem (instead of a bonus later on once you get the right mutation). So it makes sense to build a camp on the river on the west side of the map so you can get snaptail and bloodleaf and then all you need is some firecap from next to the railroad tracks. And you can get dirty water from the river and build an industrial purifier too.
---
There's a place where legendary mirelurks tend to spawn, that's a popular place. I don't know where it is. There's a place nw of Watoga that has a horse trailer with three giddyup buttercups in it, and there's a concrete resource pit nearby, if you like building with bricks.
---
Later on being in an isolated place where you're less likely to be harassed becomes a higher priority. Then it just becomes a question of your personal preference plus being located somewhere convenient to vendors, if you need to farm caps.
---
You are not being forced to do shit.  It's a bug, it will be fixed when they patch it.  Reapplying the mutation is just a short term fix for impatient fuckwads like you.
---
Hopefully it’s a few new camp items that relate to Tales from the West Virginia Hills, it would be nice
---
We

suxxxx
---
Someone made a map of vendor locations and their factions :) 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9xvioy/all_vendor_locations_map/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
It happened to me for the second time last night.
---
The first time was my fault, I logged out near Whitesprings station. I struggled into my PA and bugged out just in time.
---
The second time I was at my base, half was between Harper's Ferry and Berkeley Springs and someone nuked... half way between Harper's Ferry and Berkeley Springs.  Why?  There's nothing there (Or so I thought, it did turn out not so bad for pure violet flux from flash ferns).
---
I died.  It let me respawn at Berkeley Springs.  I died again.  It let me respawn at Southern Bell motel.  Ok, into the PA and off to see what I can get.  Poof, the air clears, the nuke is over.  I manage to pick a bit of raw flux, but no irradiated enemies are to be found.  I wander over to Harper's Ferry, and after adventures with scorched and supermutants manage to find *one meat pie* with some glowing mass.  So, net result I get a load of raw flux that will soon decay and two stable violet fluxes (thanks super duper).
---
Not the most fruitful way to start a session.
---
Google Fallout 76 vendors. There are maps showing their location and faction affiliation. Level 25 is a tricky spot, in my opinion. You are probably in the forest region, if you aren’t making gains. You should probably explore the toxic valley to the north or ash heap in the south west. Stay clear of the eastern regions for a while. 
---
It's not really an "issue", it's just something that can happen in the game.
---
Random bender spawn? The robot in the train station?
---
Congratulations, you played yourself. 
---
So true. Damn. 
---
Cool thank you makes me feel alot better. Now off to get that loot. 
---
"this game is perfect for me! I don't even engage with a games content or story, so a lifeless void is perfect for me!"
---
thanks, another question I have is  where can I find under armor that makes my armor pieces visible?  
---
I think *just* buffing the players would make the game just... easier. And it's already quite easy for the vast majority of time. How should such buffing be counterbalanced to maintain at least some semblance of challenge?
---
It's usually easier to fix the outliers in any balanced system than to rebalance the system based on them, be it buffing the underperforming or nerfing the overperforming ones. The aim, after all, is probably to provide various ways to tackle problems with varying benefits and drawbacks, but with roughly the same level of challenge averaged over all the gameplay. To maintain a set level of challenge, changes *toward* the expected level of performance require no additional adjusting to the challenges, but changes *away from* it do unless the point is to make the game generally easier (in the case of mass buffing) or harder (in the case of mass nerfing). Larger balance changes also have a significantly larger risk to break the already satisfactorily balanced parts of the game.
---
If you just want the game to be simply easier, sure, buffing just about everything is a simple answer. But do you?
---
I can't point anything in regards to the mixing but there's a little bit of info on the pioneer scouts being cut prior to release. Would you want that info?
---
I think Bethesda are more likely to drop the amount of caps you get for them instead of stacking them... 
---
by doing quests, sometimes found on vendors, i don’t remember the names of them all so in this case google would be your friend 
---
Just stop playing that game all together. Try fallout 4, is the same thing but less predatory. 
---
There's actually five. One's in a bucket inside the stall.
---
76, surely.
---
Will do thanks!
---
Wait, Gatling lasers are out of the game?
---
I wonder when I last fixed my rifles? With gunsmith5, luckofthedraw3 and weaponartisan3 they seem to last quite a few play sessions. Not saying other types of weapons don't have issues with durability, just wondering.
---
Unfortunately mules are too expensive to make on pc lol
---
I just got off work a little while ago. I tried going through my Liked videos on YouTube and even tried searching in my video history but no luck :\
---
I typically listen to YouTube while I'm at work so I frequently let it run on autoplay for hours on end.
---
Report for what lol, people playing the game?  Block and server hop. 
---
The neon lights were a big letdown. Very expensive plan if you pay vendor prices, they take up a lot of budget PER LETTER, and as if to add insult to injury, they don't snap together properly, appearing at an angle to the preceding piece. 
---
I'm definitely not the one who started the argument, I made a post to the OP where he was defaming people for crying when they "got what they want" but in actuality we did not get what we really wanted.
---
Make it. 
---
Go to Vault-Tec agricultural complex. Stand in the river and walk north picking up all the glowing fungi using Green Thumb. 
---
While you're there, grab snaptail reeds, bloodleaf, and soot flower. Continue until you've reached Slcoum's. Head toward there and collect the firecaps out front, on the side, and along the hillside heading back south. 
---
Return home. Equip Chemist and Super Duper. Make a ton of Radaway, Disease Cures, and Healing Salve. 
---
I like it :(
---
i live on a mountain and sometimes spawn falling to my death :D 
---
Leave the server
---
You want me to kill the cook?
---
Rad resist for rad weapons wouldn’t make sense in the lore of the game you use them at your own risk it not like you magically become resistant cuz your using a type of weapon 
---
I love the name 
---
I think that will be part of the point of the legendary trader trying to give those higher tier players access to that and legendary power Armor mods would help that as well  
---
Thanks, yeah I was pretty stoked. First tamed animal and it hates me..
---
No, not really... with farming Whitespring for gear and selling at vendors for app 1400 caps per day and/or selling excess items to other players on a regular basis the cap limit is easily reached in a fairly short time... that is if you dont buy anything expensive in the meantime... and frankly, what plans are worth buying if you dont plan on setting up a shop when items can be purchased from other players at a much lower price -take serums as an example plans sells for 18k+ and serums alone about 3-4k.
---
Buy serums from players for 250 and with starched genes you'll never need the plans unless you by accident erase them... for 18k+ you can buy a lot of serum from players... try adding up the number for all the mutations you want/have...
---
So no, not due to duping... dupers, I'm sure hit the cap limit faster, but legit players can also hit the limit pretty fast and if you dont buy expensive plans you're stuck with trading... this leaves us with players with caps maxed out, and due to spawn  rates on sought after legendaries, and nothing to trade with... Result: stale mate on in game trading and hello to paying real money on ebay for equipment...
---
I know the explosive side of a tse has no affect on the queen while she is flying so in that instance your better off using the generic version until she lands anyway
---
The Cake Is A Lie
---
This was my worry so kinda glad I didn’t get perk but now after hearing that name I just want my own angry angry deathclaw lol
---
I can stack concrete foundations. So if you need help later I will make your deathclaw a proper unbreakable cage
---
Definitely need weapon artisan 3* if your having that problem 200% gun health comes In handy especially when your doing the queen 
---
On your map, its the choochoo trains to sell stuff. 
---
And underarmor you can buy off of said choochoo robos. 
---
I'm not saying I like it or it's right.  Just saying this is probably what they are going for so it makes it very unlikely they will add that stuff for free.  Hope springs eternal though!
---
I don’t know if it would make it necessarily easier there are a lot of people still having trouble with the ****one end game boss especially after the latest patch you used to be able to drag a few low levels through but you can’t do that any more unless you really have a team that knows what they’re doing 
---
*** more endgame is coming I know it’s just not there now 
---
Ill join the force, but only if i can be the bad cop in the good cop/ bad cop senarios.
---
You mean until you sell them?
---
This is my thought every time someone mentions any grievances related to cosmetics and selling.
---
'Next patch cosmetics will have a value of 0 caps or the 'UnsellableItem' keyword added to them.'
---
Problem: Solved.
---
Which is why the first rule of fight club is you don't talk about fight club.
---
Marsupial and bird bones is better anyway then that clears the chest of your power armour for something like the stealth chest or core assembly which give you better AP refresh 
---
Really doesn't
---
Your family sounds amazing!
---
Want to avoid ever having this issue? build a set of stairs on a boxed foundation and have your building in the sky, when they attack to invade, the enemy destroys the box foundation, now you have a permanent floating house they can never attack. simple.
---
Doesn't matter, they still action figures from fallout at Target. Everything's bought and sold and one day they'll sell daylight.
---
yep, there is a chance they might put some for free as a few of the items where found in the DEV room with their atomic shop requirements removed. 
---
for me some of the funniest moments in this game are watching mole rats and mongrels viciously chomping on my patio furniture. sigh..no leisure time allowed, apparently. 
---
all this, of course directly under the unwatchful eye of my laser turret. 
---
Yeah.... Go have fun with your Disney final fantasy story- what's next? Broniequest?
---
Well, the optional quest objective that leads to it says "8+ players recommended" IIRC, so that should be the yardstick. With 8 reasonably endgame geared (let's say lightly modded X-01 PA, fully modded non-legendary weapons and near-optimal perk cards for them) players, is it winnable? Because it seems like that's how hard it was meant to be.
---
That's great! Armchair activism! Show us you don't stand for nothing!  Lawd... You guys are bottom of the barrel.
---
Appreciate that! Unfortunately she’ll probably just spawn elsewhere each server hop but definitely not a bad short term fix. Gonna take the time to maybe level an alternate or do my dishes. 
---
Why not use the bottle caps as intended and Brew beer? Aft least that's productive
---
I've read you can tame another animal and that releases the first one. Idk, but it's worth a try.
---
Nah your just lucky you get 800 stash limit at the beginning. You dog. 
---
It certainly is. Thanks!
---
Yeah like you we borrow them from our parents. Or is this where you ask for our numbers? One this thread was a panty raid
---
Don't use glitch - problem solved....
---
I know right! It's only a matter of time!
---
I'm all for helping people with tips and tricks but some things shouldn't be shouted about when they can easily be taken away. 
---
Nice job on the coloring 
---
Esc, Z, quit to menu...
---
So what you're saying is, we entered the room to engage Bethesda in conversation about mods and servers, but they are completely silent about our privates?
---
If you choose wisely in the first place, these problems wouldn’t exist....
---
Duh, corporate espionage is real
---
I second that lol.
---
Scam? Lol. There's nothing to gain in that shop to help your game poor kid. Now run along back to White springs for your little ghouly loot.
---
^ this
---
YouTube isn't the source of anything for adults. It's for children, just no one takes Reddit deeply beyond simple PR
---
Yea no worries pal, it's doesn't matter anymore. Rumours of a fallout 3 remaster, so I hope we enjoy that. All the best
---
First tell me how 15 hp will change anything,? I think a mole rat will do that much damage in the first hit of it's combo.
---
Awesome!
---
In life there are hunters, and there is prey.  What do you know. . . Bethesda has been looking for customers just like you. ;)
---
As a new level 50, I'm a bit jaded about speccing melee going forward, even though I don't mind the playstyle, I just can't shake the feeling that they will come out and nerf melee for no reason because it's 'over performing'. I feel this way because of the way they handled explosives and stuff last time, its got me worried. I wish we had more information about the legendary players leveling from the roadmap future, i hope its a solution the whole respeccing thing. 
---
You got how many atoms at the start of the game.. don't bother i won't wait. You get how many from doing a challenge? Lowest price costume was how much? Ahem.. sir your obviously to inept to practice law because for all intents and purposes it cannot believe argued in any substantially sound way the costumes were not free. Your operation under the pretense of bias and your whole diatreb was unnecessary and did nothing to help your grandiose claims... Idiot
---
Wll i thas for 2 days now
---
RELEASE: SUMMER 2019
---
New Feature: Legendary Players – An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
I'm hoping this is their solution, because i'm dealing with similar negative feelings about choosing ANY build for this very reason. Like melee for instance, if i start now (i'm at 50) sure i'll be set before too long but if they gut melee then what do i do, same thing your dealing with, wont want to play. 
---
Indeed.
---
When we started playing we dutifully documented and reported every bug, 'broken' mechanic or unintended behaviour.
---
These days 'we' is two of us and only one of us documents and reports bugs and issues.
---
If I find something that is potentially not behaving as expected, is beneficial to me and not detrimental to others I keep to myself.
---
The reasons for this change in behaviour should be glaringly obvious.
---
Could you direct me to the YMCA?
---
Thanks, very informative reply. /s
---
My scorched megasloth attack my base too, but it doesn't inflict any damage. Did you show animal cruelty to your deathclaw?!?
---
Drop all your junk into your stash before you begin your treacherous journey by running towards whitespring. Once you unlock whitespring, run towards watoga. Those are the difficult ones.
---
No, I fed it plenty of mole rats and people parts, but it still shrieks every second of the night damaging things across the whole base. 
---
me too, level 170 here. Log off when they see me at their base, I wasn't even firing.
---
Firing your weapon with weightless or no armor and the chameleon mutation will unstealth you after each shot.
---
I personally like the idea of PvP within the workshop area when challenged, stops them from gang killing you, if you don't respond to fight for it they just get it after the timer, no ability to hunt you away from the workshop area. If you do challenge to keep it, the timer stops, if you don't stay inside the boundary for the PvP then the timer for the opponent to win runs down and if they leave it also runs down for you to reclaim the area.
---
Yeah, I think it was called the "Beantown Interiors Mod." Definitely a nice little addition to the game. 
---
That's bad, you could try to move your camp cliff side, then your pet will spawn at the bottom of the cliff.
---
I can't wait for that. I'm planning the same thing. A whole kitchen full of my cooking supplies, jars, pots and pans, etc... I think junking up camps is the biggest thing I'm looking forward to.
---
He looks great though maybe a bit too happy.
---
I miss Caravan from FO:NV =(
---
I really don't understand how they haven't put in emote's for "Gift" and "Sorry", such a basic it's odd they left them out at all. I say "Sorry" should be just a waving Canadian Flag. Canadian born and know all to well we say sorry for everything, even when someone runs into us we say sorry. Started back in 1812 I think.
---
Well, 3 months later. The game sucks and I got it refunded, but at least the updates on the horizon are still free. Still playing?
---
So go pick them up goto vault log out than bk in and goto eggs?

Those objects take up so much space because they require AI to run and moving models and massive polygonal shapes to create, if you had any idea of the code involved and the difference in rendering a textured wall and a moving turret you would have understood this. I have worked in the Creation kit and the G.E.C.K. and tried my hand at the code in Skyrim, animated objects and exponentially bigger in lines of code then simple low polygon non-animated objects.
---
What about build steel or is gears the only one?
---
I worry about that too, but to get the 700 hit point per swing kind of build it takes a huge sacrifice in terms of devoting perks to it and running around at low health.
---
As long as they are not revenue raisers ticketing you for a broken excavator headlamp....Post apoc PIGS wouldn't get away with the shit current "Law Enforcement" do.  
---
I, too, roleplay as a post-apocalyptic police officer!  I'd like to join you as well.

I have found a workaround for the crap snap bug, it only works with the letter I as base but it [hangs the neon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vMoklmizEI) very well. I didn't test if a wall can be placed behind it, but why would you.
---
Can you actually tame an animal or is this a meme
---
Hale mothman! May it's wisdom guide us all through the perilous world.

Ive seen it on Graham
---
The mods have said that there's a number of bug-fixes coming out along with this new content in the next patch. One doesn't preclude the other. 
---
Great tip on the asylum. Ghouls can be a bit hard core but lots of sellable items. I quickly got enough caps to buy the Handmade plan and am well on the way to modding it into something useful. 
---
almost every hair mod for beth games focuses on ponytails yet they seem unable to get the hint
---
would pay big atoms for a nice ponytail
---
reeeeeee
---
And it would bring a lot more diversity to the currently bipolar nuke zones (Whitesprings/Fissure Prime). You could explore your little personal nuke zone somewhere you would normally never ever see a player-launched nuke.
---
I find them well worth it. I use the interactive map online when I get a few maps that have more then 3 copies each and I'll head out and dig those up and any I have that are near or on the way.
---
[Something like this would be perfect](https://www.metairiebank.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AdobeStock_140963560-e1502489971273.jpeg). And I agree this is a great idea. 
---
Recently? I thought I had check him earlier and it wasn't there, Ill have to double check
---
His inventory is randomized, so it'll be different every time you load in. 
---
I prefer the overseer's caches. I put the lower level guns, and more aid in the ones in Overseer's camp,Flatwoods, Morgantown Airport, Sutton, the other get a bit higher level weapons and armor.
---
IDKFA.....IDDQD I think 
---
I thought that they made plans always appear on vendors now
---
Not him or the wandering robot
---
Full set of modified excavator power armor I'll provide some black titanium 
---
But the awesome
---
Awwww man, my right leg is chameleon. Not giving that up for anything lol, plus I’m lvl 29. Rock on PS 🤘
---
Idk about the armor. But hes wearing the enclave officer uniform for sure.
---
Why do you want your armour to be visible?
---
I have speed demon also but don't need \*that\* much food, yeesh. Well, I do have the carnivore mutation also, that probably helps. I usually manage with about 20-30 purified waters/melon juices, some grilled radstag and emergency rations of a dozen dog food or so.
---
I can't express how happy I am that you guys are on PS4! Good looking out!
---
yeh im just addicted to corn n tato lol
---
Some people in this game make me not want to play sometimes. I really don’t see the whole fun in it but I guess that’s because I’m not a loser going around and destroying peoples stuff for fun
---
it happens when a scorched beast attack ur camp and that will tranform ur pet into scorched and will start attack u and ur camp. this is how i lose my two star legendary deathclaw what defended my camp for a long months.
---
AAAANNNNNDDDDD after patch 6 the tamed animals stop respawn after die.... so:
---
1. u can't tame replacemnet becuase they always die on the road back to camp
---
2. but they still ocupie 10% of the budget of ur camp, THANKS BETHESDE FOR THIS QUALITY PATCH.
---
\+they just ruined the adenal reaction mutation and no fix weeks ago, silently nerfed the unyielding legendary perk... i jut borred tolerate this bullshit what they make patch to patch...
---
chat is so broken right now
---
atom store?
---
Sorry to be contrary, but I think it's a bad idea. The game forces you to make many, many choices. Choosing to kill or harvest stuff frequently is a choice. Alternatives include, as several posts here describe, eating preserved pre-war food, and selected relevant perks. Making those choices and dealing with the consequences is part of the game. Same goes with the refrigerator suggestions. Having all food preserved would be like having infinite ammo, or guns that never break, or an unlimited supply of gears and springs, or a free supply of stimpaks, etc. There would be no point playing.
---
You come across animals in random encounters that can be tamed, as for wether a scorched deathclaw is tameable I'm not sure, but you can get a normal one 
---
This is my fave, fave faaaave thing to do.  There are tons of us like this out there, glad you came across one! 
---
welk.i was at a vendor...owned no workshops..wasnt in a team..and got killed in about 30 seconds  buy a knife attack
---
What is predatory about 76
---
The number of active worlds scales to the number of active players. With a dwindling player base there are fewer worlds and a higher chance of spawning back in to the same one.
---
I said from the day dot that they should have a pvp and pve server.  None of that ridiculous slap damage garbage, just two servers and NO transferring your character between them. It would have been a much better design choice right from the start.
---
yeh my teammate got the rewards without digging the treasure
---
Redesign it.  You don't keep a broken and poor game design simply because you can't be bothered rethinking and implementing a better system.
---
I never said it would. So where do I get it lol?
---
I’ve seen them on Phoenix in Watoga a couple of times now. 
---
huh good to know
---
I've brought quite a few this way. I do not apologize for capitalizing on their naivete...such is the way of the wasteland. 
---
Are you fucking kidding?
---
Know what bro, you’re right. It’s totally kosher to sell a Santa skin people will use for one day for 20 bucks and no in game way to earn them.
---
Hey good try Todd, FO76 is the last60 bucks Bethesda ever gets from me.
---
Cool, maybe I'll try server hopping, I keep checking him and I don't see them lol.
---
ACAB
---
Cool story bro
---
Plus it’s not that great.. ammosmith and super duper gets you way more ammo
---
This is the *perfect* time to be sharing this video:
---
So in my case I tamed it while it was a Lv 91 Scorched
---
" full Marine set (Helmet, all armor and wetsuit) " wait what ?! are you talking about the Recon helmet (the spider man thingy) or the Marine Combat Helmet ? I though it was a dev room item
---
It's like this.  My first character is level 210.   I have zero need for workshops.  I know where needed resources are located and I have plenty of caps to travel there.  
---
It's pretty clear that workshops were mostly meant for early to mid level players who are short of resources and don't know where to find them yet. 
---
They are clearly targeted to lower level players, IMO, 
---
If a level 10 player takes over Grafton steel, then it's because he is desperate for steel and lead.  If a level 110 character takes it from him, he's simply being a dick. 
---
this
---
That's what ordnance express is for though 
---
Sturdy and Heavy modifiers count as mods (unable to be changed tho) and the increased weight isn't affected by Weightless.
---
FO4 taught us such bad habits
---
Apparently not
---
Side note.  
---
Has anyone tested a Hallucigen gas grenade on SBQ and her scorch squad?
---
It'd be nice if she helped clear her own adds, lol.
---
because I'm wearing it?
---
ahh those were the days
---
thanks
---
Can't wait to shoot a mini nuke with my laser rifle. 
---
Why do I feel like I’m looking at a future episode of Reno?
---
&gt; Ugh at least I fixed my adrenaline reaction
---
How so?  
---
I got it just yesterday, but mine shows no positive perk. Only -HP.
---
Roses quests have been bugged since the beta. You just need to server hop to get the quest markers to display correctly.
---
This has been proven before; you cant get killed in pacifist
---
Yeah you can I linked a pic
---
Fair enough 
---
Had a similar experience yesterday but I'm a bloodied pistol build and it didn't end so well lol
---
Im dumb, its ordinance express that affects them.  
---
It's possible that someone just left your CAMP location. The spot remains "reserved" for a while till the servers refresh ir something. Do you camp in a very popular spot?
---
FYI police are civilians.
---
&gt; I gave a level 1 bloodied sickle 
---
This is something I'd like to do, but how do you find legendaries so low?
---
Now wait for the moonshiner patch. Possibly. And no more spoiled fruits
---
Dwindling player base is definitely not the reason. It depends on the time of time day around the world. There are certain times when player count is low and in these times, less servers are used and servers gwt restarts.
---
Yeah, what a disappointment. She was so far up bullets wouldn't even hit her and she was still spawing scorched enemies around drop site v2. 
---
Can you provide me with data to support your assertion about the player base?
---
I'm a rich vault dweller who has emerged against his will to simply survive.
---
PSN dtb7591
---
After I attacked the one guy I stopped, I just kept asking them to leave and not fuck up all my stuff. I already have a hard enough time being on the edge of the Savage Divide and the Mire with the mobs, players are just too much lol.
---
After they roll out player vending and separate PvP and PvE a little more I think it will be better. As of right now even if you have pacifist mode on all it does is stop YOU from hurting THEM. They can still murder you.
---
That's what I ended up having to do. I had 4 workshops I had set up to grind plans though so I was hoping they would leave. No such luck.
---
Got a screenshot of it bud?
---
Awesome. I'd love to see a follow-up image, because you've nearly got him as accurate as can be.
---
Because that would mean consistently seeing fewer players. I see loads of full servers everyday, even with server hopping. 
---
Yeah I don’t really like this system with the whole pacifist mode. Wish it was more like GTA online. Just don’t make us see through basically lol. But I know how you feel with the Griefers and I do hope player vending won’t be too bad and our stuff doesn’t get ruined by these people roleplaying as “raiders” 
---
I used the phantom device once and it seemed to affect the scorched and ghouls. 
---
are you on PC?
---
Join the Enclave.
---
We have a discord.
---
We raid workshops. All the workshops in a server we're in belongs to the Enclave.
---
We hunt wanted. 2000 cap 'bait trolls' get wrecked.
---
We orbital strike trolls' camps.
---
We launch nukes.
---
We trade internally and help low levels. We're running out of space for materials and ammo, so we've begun making mule characters to help with the absurd amounts of materials.
---
We don't follow arbitrary RP roles. 
---
Our only rule is 'don't dupe' - we started as a group of people that would actively seek and grief dupers until they left whatever server they're in.
---
I wish we were more similar to a cult- but the other admins disagree. Maybe some day.
---
Don't be a nuke-cop. Police are bad, Enclave is better.
---
If you have an Ushanka hat I will personally vouch for you.
---
Also we're on Xbone.
---
Hopefully they'll fix it at some point. Although if they would let some carefully screened modders work on stuff, just for performance and bugs, it would go a long way. I don't want cheat mods or anything that alters the gameplay, just ones like the UOFO76 patch or Director Cut or something.
---
It almost makes having a decent camp up kinda futile. I'm about to just go back to a small little 2x2 shack by a resource node covered in turrets. Anything bigger just makes it more likely they will spawn inside.
---
Hm, I've had this problem since at least January if not earlier (may not have noticed).
---
Because the players that remain are in a smaller number if worlds. You don't have any data do you?
---
This is what I suspect is really happening.  Bravo for stating the obvious in spite of rabid fan boyish and down votes.
---
The guy expressed an opinion which you don't need to share. Your response sounds like you should be in a mental asylum.
---
Yes, it is going to be like the vending machines for ammo and aid scattered around the map
---
I can’t deny this is true
---
And you assume I don't know all this? And that limiting amounts of these more taxing objects by NUMBER instead of by workshop budget wouldn't solve the problem? I think I knew pretty well what I was talking about, understood the problem, and provided a viable technically astute solution. I have done a good bit of fooling around in the G.E.C.K. myself, been modding for YEARS, and been tinkering with Bethesda games since Morrowind came out. I think you just threw out a superior-sounding answer before even really looking at what I was proposing. Obviously I DO understand the reasons why certain things take up so much budget, or I would be just asking for a larger budget instead of providing a technical solution that would allow it by putting a hard cap on resource-intensive objects, therefore allowing a LARGER over-all pool for simple items. Bethesda wouldn't have to design a workshop around the possibility of dealing with 8 missile turrets if they know the maximum a player can place is 4. That's how safety tolerance works: You design for the worst-case scenario. If the worst-case is suddenly limited, then the safety tolerance can be lowered to match the new worst-case, freeing up resources.  
---
As neither do you.
---
Lol that would be something if we had those cheats in this game.
---
Ok thanks :) 
---
Depends of buyer, but couple hundred caps max - I got few of them and I see no demand for them (listed for 300 caps).
---
I was stoked on the idea of a deathclaw pit for unwanted visitors, but it spawns elsewhere every time :’(
---
It seem I can trigger the quest (and only one random of the three tokens quests) once per IRL day. I tried many time cos i moved my camp pretty close to camden park. I try multiple times per IRL day, log in, log out, seems like there's a 20-24hrs cooldown for it.
---
It will take forever to collect that many tokens, as I can get only 3 per day.
---
Please correct me if im wrong
---
I say just make separate PvP and PvE servers. It's already bad enough that we can't stay on the same server, which encourages server hoping and leads to me going through and area and all the stuff outside of containers is already looted. Atleast let us separate ourselves by desire to PvP or not. Give us the ability to form settlements to. I would give my build budget to a group if I had a safer place to log into every day.
---
So I just wiped out my 3 mutations to fix addrealine reaction ( marsupial, speed demon). I then re-applied marsupial and speed demon, then waited till they were unsuppressed from the serum, then applied addrealine and it worked.( Though the positive affects don't show on ur status they still affect positive on ur damage.) I did have them glitch off and k just re joined the same server and it was fixed.
---
My buddy added marsupial after adding addrealine and both mutations work for him.
---
Me either. This game has so much potential and Bethesda definitely has the vision to see it through. I can deal with the glitches as long as the content is great like usual.
---
Nuka quantum gernades don't seem to hurt the queen at all
---
Radstorms actually spawn fairly frequently if you're near a power plant. You can see the glowing green cloud come out of the big chimney things, it's super cool!
---
Camp Venture! 
---
PSN deadpelican will be on tomorrow 
---
Sadly nerfed.
---
Yeah I want that too. I just said that because of the workshops. Maybe it would switch off of pacifist mode when we claim one. (Which I have never liked doing workshops because of the 3v1 I’ve dealt with and no I will never touch one again unless something changes. I understood the pvp aspect of it but player v player isn’t player v a group of friends that are together.) 
---
Yeah, I do too. I played with one other person a few weeks ago. It wasn’t what I was expecting. The instruments didn’t sync and we were playing two different songs. One was on guitar, the other on banjo. We were both a bit disappointed. 
---
This is absolutely beautiful!
---
Darn thanks!
---
There was a theory on here that they removed it to stop griefers making trap camps. It seems odd that you can still make and use them in workshops but not camps unless they did it for a reason.
---
Lol, I'm not the one saying DEFINITELY 
---
Really? That is cool! Although it’s pretty odd that I haven’t seen one yet myself in all this time. The constant rads and greenish hue would be obvious to me I would think. I don’t spend a ton of time around the power plants but I have explored them all and done their events a few times.
---
Oh, and can we get a mutie or Scorched boss named Leroy Brown or Jim Walker if were including Croce?
---
Thank you again. What a guy!! Came and found me last night and gave me the mod. Love this community  ..sometimes :) 
---
Sturdy and Heavy both count as invisible mods. They can't be changed and directly increase weight. This weight increase still counts as a mod and is therefore not discounted by the weightless legendary effect.
---
You could do that, but what if you get a server disconnect or a spinning zombie bag :-)
---
Better off using your stash.
---
Cheers , really appreciate all the tips
---
This should really be #1 on their list. Ideally a mode where crimes and sabotaging other players missions is simply impossible, but I realize that might be unrealistic... As a casual pacifist player there's just nothing worse than having what little time you can set aside for gaming ruined by some griefer. Knowing this is always a possibility makes me not want to waste my energy on this game at the moment, which is terrible because it's such a beautiful and fun game in every other aspect.
---
Moonshine + cops = shenanigans!!
---
Nice to see you posting here jug love your videos.
---
I did a bunch yesterday. There’s a red rocket just north of there with stash box. Just run to the rocket, grab one and turn it in. Go back to the rocket, server hop to reset and grab one more. Repeat. 
---
I think you are mixed up. You most certainly can be killed in pacifist mode and the game tells you that in the settings menu where you turn on/off pacifist mode. But you can't kill anyone if its turned on. 
---
I could give you one for free! I get outfits from the technical data stuff all the time 
---
I’m sure he is reading this....
---
what do bloodied legendaries do?
---
The charisma perks, "wasteland whisperer" and "animal friend" lets you pacify and occasionally tame creatures. You can send them to your C.A.M.P and they'll stay there for a budget cost.
---
It's the spawn system from fo4, so yeah it's poorly designed for a multiplayer game. They desperately needed to overhaul it for 76, but they must have thought it was fine? It's not... but most of us know how to abuse it to our advantage and we do.
---
Love it!! Great job! 
---
Heck yeah awesome 
---
On PC Esc, Z (menu), Challenges
---
&gt; I feel like I read something saying that the enemies spawn in relation to the level of the local players. Which sucks for low level players to deal with...
---
This is very much the case. If a low level player has spawned an area then a higher level player cannot spawn more mobs on top of that (anymore) however, if the low level player has cleared the area, then its free to respawn higher level mobs if someone else comes along. You also can't personally respawn the same set of mobs (clubhouse at whitesprings for instance) without leaving the server and rejoining or waiting about 15 minutes. 
---
I tend to fire at the ground a few times for "take it, its for you." and ??? works for wtf.
---
winter at the earliest.
---
Meh, workshops are nearly worthless to anyone but new players anyway. It's simply faster to learn farming routes and get mass junk the manual way. I know people who sit at workshops for 3-4 hours a day to get what I get in 15 minutes of farming. The only thing of value that comes out of workshops are the recipes from successful defense events.
---
Whaaaah!!
---
Simply do some challenges and you can get it for free. It's not hard.
---
I got both the elf and santa bundle for free and I am now at 2000 atoms again.
---
LOL
---
Good idea but 3 points of my special just for food makes me cry
---
I'm not sure anymore, but I think I dug up a 3 star lvl 40 revolver from one of my first buried treasures. Furious &amp; Explosive
---
an arcade cabinet with different skins on the Atom Shop would be a lot of fun for sure. 
---
+1 for humble pie! 
---
Please, please increase vendor caps, even if it’s only 100-200 per faction. Hate having to wait to sell my bulk!
---
I had the same attachments as you and the legendary effect was +30% damage against robots. I just played the weapon for fun while having a heavy weapons build.
---
Ohh i almost forgot some theories: server performance seems to have an impact on the bug. Everytime i got out of a nuke silo the also bug started happening. 
---
Who else read that in the voice of the Silver Shroud? 
---
This is brilliant mate!
---
LOL :D
---
Just give me a mohawk pls.
---
Hell I would pay atoms for the base game hairs from Skyrim to be imported. Reuse dem assets!
---
Nice job wasting your gold, and your money.  It's not going to happen, at least not in this years roadmap.  Hate it all you want, they have more important things to work on.
---
I got this error a few times on my PS4 and just kept trying login.  Most of the time it lets me in on the third login attempt and when it doesn’t I just close the game then login and then it works.  
---
Me. Out loud. At work. 
---
96?! I only encountered 15 or so in my 400+ hours since beta, how come you got so much of those? xD
---
\^\^This\^\^ so much this!
---
I get this all the time once I enter combat, before combat or if I jump out of reach of enemies I can swing fast and mutations seem to work, as soon as I get up close in melee and start fighting (on PC) I can left click as fast as I want and my knives, 1h or 2h weapons only swing about every 6 clicks.
---
This make my max melee build fast weapons and Speed Demon mutation pointless. I swing like a drunk slug and get hammered by everything.
---
I'm so relieved others are seeing this also, I thought it was me, something I was doing wrong.
---
And no my hardware and software (Windows 10) is kind of dedicated to Fallout 76, no other games installed or apps running while playing and this is a dedicated gaming pc. Everything else works fine, just the melee speed gets stuck on slow/intermittent.
---
Bloody frustrating.
---
I just found out on my low level alt that I can craft them. Can't remember finding the plans. It's possible I've picked them up during this little time, even though I've not played much with the alt.
---
Seems semi-okay as craftable to sell items go, vendors give about 13 caps for it and it costs only 1 cloth to craft.
---
Bit weird but ok 
---
On a strictly technical level, it is. 
---
easy, on xbox press start, then LB, go to challenges, scroll through daily/weekly/etc
---
I don’t like mutations. In hover mode weapons shouldn’t be available
---
That was a silly comment, if this bug transferred to ballistics where guns only fired every 6 or so activations of the trigger there would be outcry, but if it is melee then, don't worry just adapt O\_o
---
Ugh. Thanks for keeping me sane.
---
is this going to be moving over to PC Version too? cause if so, I'm down to be a part of this, where do I send my CV? 
---
I thought there was sliders? If you are on ps4 you hit L2 or R2 I’m pretty sure and it gets it down/up faster and L1 and R1 for it to be smaller. 
---
Update: helped launch a second yesterday with no problems 😍
---
I made a church called 'new eden' and yeah my character looks a bit like joseph seed XD
---
Server hop for lead Charleston fire station and Flat woods gym are a good source additionally you could put your camp next to a lead resource and extract it. Add super duper and ammo Smith as previously recommended and you will swimming in ammo like Scrooge McDuck are you on Ps4?
---
I hope exactly this will happen after the next patch due to some usual mix-up that happens quite often when they try to fix something :D
---

Really?
---
I had the same issue with my deathclaw. I had numerous people kill her, and she died a few times fighting scorchbeasts. She finally just didn't load in one day and that's how I got rid of her. I  really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really  wish Bethesda would fix tamed creatures. Either make them just decorative, or make them dismissible. 
---
RIP Steve. 
---
Feel like if the gameplay loop wasn't so boring it would way easier to pull people in. 
---
 I like making a run through glassed cavern, where there a bunch of lootable fog crawler, cave cricket and a few scorchbeast corpses. Also a scorchbeast at the end which is easy to kill as it doesnt fly, decent cave for exp, as scorched are very dumb and weak.
---
Gulper Slurry also lasts me a long time. 
---
As for water, I just had 2 industrial purifiers going at camp, and quickly just got about 100 saved. I seem to get more than I need from defending workshop events, if you take like 3 workshops and just keep doing those.
---
I use blueprints. Don't put too much into building because it'll get taken over.
---
Interesting post, from a guy with that name. 
---
🤣
---
Bloodied melee/be weps 
---
I don’t get it?
---
Til
---
He is telling you to experiment yourself to find out what works for you and your perks. Isn’t that part of the fun?
---
Well, instead of asking others, maybe you should...ahem...try some out. 
---
This should be in every Raider C.A.M.P!
---
It sounds perfect
---
I don’t mean they log off I just don’t see them on to begin with ever since the explosive weapon nerf update I haven’t seen anyone around my level 
---
There are many things that needs buffed, but 2SE was just too OP. It had to be fixed.
---
I usually point out the paper bag with my power armors flashlight! 
---
Personally, I have no qualms with taking what I need from them.
---
Losing junk is the only consequence of dying, so too fkn bad if your bag isn’t there when you come back.
---
&gt; This game has no training wheels
---
Is that a joke? It is perhaps the easiest game ever, you would have to be handicapped severely to ever die outside of PvP which requires both parties participating even
---
If his 5dmg/sec is pseudoaccurate that would be at least 150 damage they could do to you in 30sec.
---
No, what I’m saying is if you have anything armor penetration or an anti-armor effect on a gamma gun or radium rifle it should actually reduce rad resistance on the target. As it stands, armor pen in general seems to only apply to DR and not ER/RR.
---
I just love spending 10 mins spamming the follow me emote to get a low level player to open a little brown bag of goodies I dropped them absolutely no sarcasm whatsoever 
---
ok..yeh maybe it took 60 seconds..i was ignoring him thinking he couldnt kill me anyways lol
---
Have you got 3 star martial artist perk card ?
---
For cargobots: Missile launchers with tracking missiles
---
I'm still leaning on my melee build, where I use bloodied gatling gun and bloodied sledgehammer for the SBQ fight, and lesser powered bloodied melee weapons for the Whitespring so I don't one-shot everything.
---
I don't know what the non-melee meta is now. Depends on your build I guess. Yeah like other people say, if you like to snipe there's a build for that and you'll want instigating. If you hate power armor there are builds for that. 
---
I’ve played since the beta all the friends I made in game don’t play anymore. Push me to the edge all my friends have left 
---
Is this a luck thing? Cause people wouldn’t know what server you’d be on. 
---
They are not like trading cards at all, so no. 
---
How about on PS4?
---
I have a eclectic collection of armour based on their legendary affect. My rule of thumb is the more expensive the better. 
---
Just over 5000 here. I'm waiting for those new power armour skins.
---
BUT STOP TEMPTING ME WITH DAILY OFFERS!!
---
Too bad I'm on XBox. But love the idea! If BGS would have at least kept Dogmeat, you could have had a K-9 Unit as well. You got my upvote friend!

It's rocket girl, you expecting her not to have new tech implants?

Definitely a good reference, however, I would argue that this is a stylized drawing, not a realistic drawing therefore it does not need to be perfectly representative of reality. 
---
The rounder breast style is more idealistic, which is suitable for this style of drawing in my opinion. Ultimately it just depends on what the individual artist's intent is. It is not that it is necessarily incorrect, they would only have gotten it "wrong" if they intended a perfect realistic representation and for comic books, I find it doubtful that many sought to represent true-to-life imagery. 
---
That wouldn't explain why melee swings faster when not in combat. I'm on PS4 and have had no issues. 
---
If you remove those perks it wont make any difference to an already tamed animal right?
---
Now, as I was saying: Smoking's bad... mmkay? You shouldn't smoke. If you smoke, you're bad. Because cigarettes are bad. Mmkay? It's a bad thing to smoke... so don't be bad... by smoking. Mmkay? That'd be bad... cause cigarettes are bad...

Get yourself starched genes level two before you do anything.

Till about lvl 80 I didn't know that crits ignored assassin/sentinel armor. I would wait patiently in stealth for my target to be walking, but without a crit I usually couldn't bring the griefer down in one shot. Their natural reaction was to simply freeze in place, then start spamming an explosive shotgun at where they thought you were (Which before the TSE nerf usually killed you if it got anywhere close. Now that I have a sniper build with chameleon I grief the griefers. I always get "Dirty sniper!" "Coward!" and "Stealth builds are OP!". These same idiots whining are the ones making people's lives so miserable that half the entire combat meta shifted to Fireproof crit sniper builds with chameleon armor just to deal with their nonsense. A good melee build can wreck a sniper if you don't play like a moron and run him out of crits. These whiners are just like the salty dupers: They don't care about the rock-paper-scissors of game balance, they just want an un-fair advantage. I love watching them eat shit and cry about it. :) 
---
That's helpful Fatboy 
---
The folks at biggest risk are those with low endurance running bloodied builds. I wonder how things like exploding cars ate counted .. likely second attacker? 
---
Lol! Thanks for the heads up on the vid.
---
That's....not how it works at all.
---
"are you ok? Ya there?"
---
To be clear, I was asking if you could provide us with a picture of the actual outfit. I see that you got the reward, I'm just curious what it looks like.
---
Take over power station work shops. Power up the fusion core generator by building a 100 power generator. I always take over 2 check them every 15-20 minutes and they'll have 3 cores each. It's a very efficient way to farm cores. You can have 20+ in a little over an hour.
---
👌
---
You are in luck with the charisma emote 
---
Cool story 👍
---
I’ve seen the in game emote files and unless they add more for some reason these emotes don’t exist sadly 
---
Hehe, I myself have quit smoking when I got married... why not let me smoke in the game, you know? I swear I'd only smoke in my C.A.M.P. building, not in public places like Watoga station.
---
Oh and I should add you have to say the whole thing it's like a tribe named Quest smh
---
The endurance emote with power armour is all you need anyway 
---
Looks like Elder Maxson as a lumberjack, you’re pretty close tho
---
Can you not run around without pa? But good places to farm are anywhere pa spawns. They always spawn with a fusion core.
---
Watoga has 3 or 4
---
Black water mine
---
Etc. 
---
from my experience. this sound happens when there is a "power box" nearby while the related power plant is repaired fully.
---
Thats a random event buddy.
---
This ain’t it chief 
---
I had the same thing happen. Kept hearing this noise and found a rat chewing underside my house. I couldn't get to it and it was really annoying. Had to take part of my house out just to kill it.
---
If you’ve done the Mayor for the Day quest, check watoga. There are 3-4 power armor suits that spawn outside and one generator in the transit center Behind the lvl three door... you might collect a couple quickly but not worth it if you have to dodge robots the whole time. 
---
No but laser weapons cannot get the explosive modifier anymore and the ones that had that prefix have been deactivated.
---
You guys are awesome.
---
I did the puking and heart emoticons simultaneously to show how overcome with emotion i was...
---
You can fast travel to events on the map this is great for opening up new areas without having to walk there.

Not sure

Not sure ask u/themadscott

Cool, Thanks.  Yesterday I quit using the Tesla and didn't have the issue at all including doing a Silo Run with a friend and WS Nuke without the glitch appearing at all, though the nuke event was very odd as about halfway through enemies quit respawning entirely.
---
It's really not as bad as people make it seem, even people who haven't played the game shit on it.
---
It's quite true, the meme. Bitter people who feel the need to tell others what to do because they have no control in their own personal lives, get mad when you enjoy something they told you not to
---
I've added my DukesDragons build link. Yes I have Martial Artist 3\*.

We are not allowed liking fo76 even with it's flaws?

Apparently not.

And then we're called sheep for NOT following the crowd?

I agree. I announced it yesterday on here that I was at the Whitespring dropping loot into the trash cans. When I left the server, loot was still there. A guy asked if I was trying to bait. Nope. Not me. I actually like helping others. I collect everything lol. I bulk it. I sell it. When I cannot sell anymore, I share to other players. Other players have helped me. Been overencumbered for days needing to bulk. Someone dropped a nuke at the Whitespring and some wonderful person gifted me with a ton of plastic, allowing me to finish bulking what I had. So, later I got online and did some runs to get more stuff and I filled those trash cans and the medical register as a pay-it-forward gesture. I even streamed dropping stuff in case someone was questioned my motives 😆. Plan to do it again today when I play this morning. I really hope they put in a gift emote. We sorely need this.  
---
what i meant is that you can't get 1 shotted in 1 shot with explosive bobblehead stacking when people claimed before you could

I wonder if it could just be a boardgame version of Fallout.
---
It’s the same thing that happened to No Mans Sky. The game was overhyped and underperformed. NMS didn’t have the same number of bugs but they promised SO much and couldn’t delivery right away.  By the time they got all the content in, reputation was turning away a lot of new players. 
---
I’ve been playing FO76 since beta and while I have enjoyed the game a great deal, I can certainly understand why some people got frustrated and quit, not willing to give it another chance. 
---
Going to experiment with suppressing mutations before fighting 1h 2h melee to see if there is any connection with mutations interfering with melee speed.
---
They've changed how the game prioritized the use of cores. It'll use the lowest charge first so if you had 3 33% charged ones they'd disappear pretty quickly and make it seem like you were burning through them. 
---
Existing explosive weapons still work.
---
That certainly is some projection there pal.
---
I see I hit the nail.

Not hard when it's on your own head to be honest.

You are just proving my point. Thanks!

There were some good answers in a thread from yesterday. The Ash Heap run is less frequented than the Watoga run, so it's more likely to work on any given server.

No, there are people who enjoy the lite pvp elements in Adventure mode that don't want to be forced into either hardcore pvp or no pvp.

If you want a pvpless mode ask for a new game mode instead of trying to take one away from other people

Here I was thinking safes spawned a lock level based on the level of the first player to go near them...

He's not even inside the ring yet and he's already in a defensive stance

Ah I see, good to know. Se they just don't drop anymore then
---
The NPC mentality is 'The people who criticize this game just hate other people having fun'.
---
Replace the last line with 'Stop giving Bethesda money for mediocre efforts'. Too bad gamers have an incredibly weak concept of quality where the only requirement is 'good enough'.
---
And it just works.
---
You have checked that you are not wanted by accident, have you?
---
Thanks for adding to the community and pushing building further! I find it so hard to learn new things from YouTube, it always seems like I saw/did everything a month before it shows up there, but I can always count on your videos to totally blow my mind haha! :) great work like always 
---
I thought I already commented on this post but it got deleted? Anyways, if you are on ps4 then the buttons are L1 and R1/ L2 and R2. I literally just tested it for myself and it works fine. I have 7000 .45 rounds. 
---
I did. Not wanted. Had some friends join the world to see if I can see them in random places. I could see them. Was able to trade.pvp. build in there camps no problems. 
---
It seems to be a thing with anything scorched haha 
---
Ah I see. You don't tell people what to do, you just tell them what they are. Smh salty neckbeards right.
---
I miss it too!!!
---
That’s great!  
---
Now you have to build and scrap the handmades . It took me about 40 guns before I finally learned the silencer mod. 
---
Why would you take duplicates if you didn't want them the game lets you know if you own a card. It literally says 1 owned or max level owned under the card. The only reason to take dupes is if you wanted lower level cards to experiment with perk builds. 
---
I tend to sell them for 200 caps.
---
I’m trying to get rare outfits and saving up on some semi rare ones to sell for the player vendors. Also haven’t found my ideal weapon I want so just doing that really until the roadmap stuff starts up. 
---
They should just let us equip all the perks always, because no one seems to want to actually want to make a build with pros and cons.
---
People just want everything all the time, which is why these kind of suggestions keep coming up over and over. Let everyone just be a perfect little clone of everyone else.
---
I get that yeah 
---
I always give them away
---
The most impressive thing here is that a fatman actually killed something.

Camden park is on lower left of map. Get on slide and run on the tracks. In a coaster car stuck at top of tracks, is the key. Where I found it

Bulk as much spare scrap as you can, it’s surprising how much you have you probably don’t need.
---
Exactly! Glad we agree.
---
I can, but I was farming materials so I was using the PA for extra weight, it's just my little farming machine/nuke zone machine, I usually go PAless everywhere
---
Duh. ..It's mutation friendly many post- apocalyptic citizens have hand mutations. We wouldn't want them to fell left out.
---
I don't have the recipe for the 100 power generator yet :(

Never found anything worth keeping. Just stuff to sell.

At first i was like " what is this fuckery about " then i watched the video, the 1st minute i was laughing so hard i choked on my coffee to the point i have to put my phone down and one of my personnel had to come over and see if im okay and warned me of the Sgt. That was around the corner. After catching my breath we proceeded to watch the whole video and had guys taking turns checking the hallways so we do not get caught on our phone's. ( we work at a fed facility in which im in charge of the watch, it's a DoD fac that has a strict " NO Cellphone's allowed" policy, a policy in which i made sure i emphasize to the Army and Navy personnel.) Within that half hour span your  video has been replayed over and through different phones passed around the whole entire building, and by the last 15 minute break of our shift everyone was using the " aww what? " as their new word for the night. Thanks for the video!

Leveling 'mules' thus promoting them to 'alts' which in turn require the creation of additional ~~pylons~~ mules.

The game battlecry made before was an online multiplayer game as well. Zenimax doesn't have any experience making multiplayer games?

Just complete any powering up a power plant event and you'll get them

It only shows the negative affects in the status bar, but ur weapon damage should still go up but now like it was at day 1 of 76 it only increases at 50% health and below
---
Lol that's why lucky was in quotations It felt mean to put they're stupid

I hate griefers, but that is awesome. I guess you should start a Justice League.

I try to use other players as a source of new content. I'm active in trading circles and do PvP.

---
Absolutely amazing experience. I'd pay to be flung that far. It's good for the lungs. Really opens em up.
---
A similar process. Hit the button which opens the Map, hit the button that pulls open the menu, select Challenges.
---
That's very disappointing. I figured if they put a whole bunch of instruments together you would be able to play a song you can't hear on the radio. And if you play with a group you should get another temporary perk on top of the Fine Tuned perk. 
---
Ghoul slayer's gamma gun, weightless mr handy buzz saw blade, vampiric shotgun.
---
Not my base, however I'm sure the owner would agree, that any base build on the golf course should be destroyed so others can enjoy killing mobs as well.
---
It's also nowhere near as good as people make it seem.
---
I picked it up on a risk buy and honestly the game is great. Not "great compared to what people say" but i actually think its far better than Fallout 4 in every way, and am having way more fun than in more successful titles (looking at you RDO) 
---
I’m still wondering when we’re getting a respec. I haven’t played in weeks, largely because I’d have to spend dozens of hours grinding levels to move points to have a build. 
---
People like to jump on the hate train. Unfortunately games only get one chance at first impressions, and I think we can all agree that fallout 76's first impressions we're kinda shit. But let's be honest. Bethesda games have always been buggy. It's just so much noticeble and worse when it's online
---
Always glad to see a group dedicated to lower level players, I don't really have an interest in PVP so I won't be joining you guys, but any of you guys needs some upgrades on your gear or camps, let me know, I'm on PS4 as well.

Essentially, yes. But wait until you have a few, then knock em out all at once.

With the upcoming additions and fixes yeah it’s worth it, I don’t regret buying it full price tho I had a blast

It's an intended game mechanic. If you don't want PvP, don't join PvP zones
---
I'm rolling another character and the game is harder due having so many high level characters. Makes it fun but I bet people who aren't decent at the game (first time FO players) would disagree.
---
They expected New Vegas 2 that’s why
---
Holy shit for the first month or two after release me and my friends had all found police uniforms and did exactly the same thing except we were kind of bad cops... 
---
the mod's been broken for a while and isn't the best to use anymore
---
I have to politely disagree I believe they're on the right path. We're getting a lot of new content. That will bring players back. Currently all that's left for high level players is grinding there wasn't enough content to keep the game interesting and grinding gets boring.
---
Not to mention a major overhaul would most likely just introduce new bugs. Minor patches reintroduced old bugs. I'd hate to see what happens with a major overhaul.

&gt; The amount of damage reduced by damage resistance climbs very quickly until damage resistance is about half of the potential weapon damage, after which diminishing returns means one gets less and less damage reduction per point of damage resistance. If damage resistance is exactly equal to the potential weapon damage done, then exactly half of the damage is negated. In other words, if one has 50 ballistic damage resistance and is shot by an enemy doing 50 ballistic damage, then they will receive 25 damage.
---
A 3 sentence quick rundown of how damage resistance works, impossible!  
---
&gt; Damage resistance in fallout is difficult to explain in brief, I suggest you educate yourself on how it works. That "Small difference" is actually massive
---
Though the person calling everyone ignorant seemed to swing and miss on the whole diminishing returns the higher your dr part...
---
It's crazy, everytime I've been attacked by someone with an explosive gun I enter area chat and, without being angry or insulting, politely ask if they paid caps or traded for it...everyone including you got them as a legit drop!  
---
I've been playing online multiplayer games for almost two decades and I wind up being 50th percential pretty much everytime.  I accept of the matchmaker is doing its job I should lose half my matches.  I'm not really sure I need to call OP guns what they are to feel better about myself though I'm pretty sure you hate hearing it because it invalidates you.
---
But do they have to have their P.O.S.T cert. Or would 25 years experience in vault dwelling count as qualifying experience? 
---
There's already an Appalacha PD, but I might have to 😂😂 stack a bunch of assassin's gear and get to work.
---
First try? Really good!
---
They expected a finished game that they could run on their hardware for full retail.
---
Wait, there are recipes at the plant?
---
I've honestly never had anyone try to take my workshops. I usually take over Poseidon, Charleston Junkyard, Wade Airport, and Billings Homestead and then just bounce around defending them to grind building plans/XP.
---
You’re mental if you enjoy something that the bandwagon hates. /s 
---
If you can find enjoyment in something then by all means go for it!
---
Are the skins or preparation for new content? Seems NPCs in this armor wreaking havok with hordes of scorched supporting would be a pretty good quest.

I am on XB1 but I will try with the bumpers. Perhaps I haven't tried that! I hope it works because this has been annoying haha if it works I shall remove the post or if any XB1 players knows if it does

Also the cannibalism perk has been a godsend for my weight because I don’t carry much food around.

Can you explain this better? Are you placing two walls (or doors) in the same position on top of eachother?
---
Right? Fallout 4 songs was too ironic and goofy tonally. 
---
When I was a level 20 I took George’s junkyard only to get plans because that’s what I head everyone talking about and in fallout 4 I LOVED building and decorating. It’s definitely my go to for stress relief. But when I was defending, a level 80 come up and contested it and threw a grenade at me and killed me. 
---
Hahaahaha, the irony here is...
---
Most people reading this and the base owner as well, may think it was intentional, as people do this to bases at Whitespring, esp. to the annoying turret bases by the club.
---
You know as well as i do that those ghouls are low key traffickers, most of them drop chems and a lot of them are packing but are too blown to manipulate said objects. Whith that being said, we need more of them around preferably their big bosses with 3* on em, but watch out they roll deep.
---
Even if it means doing meth! /s
---
I mean, taming in general, while neat, is a pretty big waste at the moment. The only reason to do it is to have the experience of doing it. The whole taming thing is pretty buggy and they can end up wasting shitloads of camp budget.
---
I'm an adhesive farmer for my friend group, and being stupid enough to not build on a river, I have a dozen tatos, a dozen corn and a dozen mutfruit plants, as well as 4 small land purifiers and a Fusion Generator. 
---
They all ignore my home with workbenchs and stuff, but attack everything else. I hate using turrets because they take so much budget, but I had to make some, so it's 1 for the generator 1 for the purifiers and 2 for the crops. 
---
It's worked so far, though a Scorchbeast wanted to say hello and eat all my crops a few days ago...
---
There is a random spawn point next to the Pond by the train station.
---
If you follow the tracks from Charleston Train yard toward the Station it triggers the spawn, which will sometimes be the random vendor Bot, he is a Responder Vendor but sells a couple of plans not found elsewhere.

Yes, this!

Gosh I hope the patch on the 12th is as great as it sounds. 
---
&gt; maybe level an alternate or do my dishes.
---
You prollycould but why not build a floating base that he can't destroy in the mean time?
---
Horde events spawn legendary creatures so just do one that pops up in the forest and you'll get a low level item
---
I had one hell of a session there in a nuke zone. I discovered keeping the king ghoul alive will continue to spawn hordes, including legendaries. I mowed 12+ legendary ghouls in the horde before some doofus with a TSE came along and killed the king.
---
around 290
---
True
---
hahaha, very cool and a nice place you got there :)
---
You need a well rounded build.
---
\- Bloodied explosive level action for long range
---
\- Bloodied explosive pump shotgun for up close
---
\- Bloodied power fist when not in PA
---
\- Bloodied Axe when in PA
---
All this ofc is if you can run a low health mutated build
---
No green stuff here!
---
Fuck your wall!
---
If he killed you the first time that's probably fair enough because you obviously hit them too, but yeah the trolling afterwards was shitty, just hop servers
---
Or maybe they just want something different? 
---
I grow all my stuff inside so things don’t attack it anymore.
---
So Blaster meant to say $17.10 is a good price for FO76 I paid $48 (best buy gamer club discount 20% off full price) and I'm still happy with the purchase

More damage the lower your health.
---
That's why I can never find him he's on a tour of cool C.A.M.P. builds
---
Hey I’m allowed to mix meth into my sugar bombs and nuka-cola!
---
There's one with wolves, to kill 3 legendary and then the Alpha in a follow up event.
---
I find that's pretty frequent with decent 1* drops, it's how I got 2 chameleon pieces at level 10.

We need antiaircraft for our camps.

The only way I managed to stop this issue was to remove anything electrical (lights, generators) and use candles etc instead.

Paid 40. No regrets.

I used to see them all the time at Watoga/Watoga station, Harper's Ferry, R&amp;G Station, and some other's, but that was before the recent patches. Not sure if they'd still be there, since I haven't traveled that way in a while
---
how much more damage can it do
---
Looks like he broke all your windows.
---
Lol I thought I had a server to myself before come to find out I was wanted. Took forever to get someone to kill me. PSA if a wanted player is running around bare ass in whitesprings it's not a trap just take thier caps and put them out of thier misery.
---
I truly hope so. I just this game, for free with new PS4 controller, so I'm at least somewhat ok with not paying for it. But I really don't see at the moment a drive to get back to it, which is truly sad.
---
Yeah it must be a bug. The enemies have a level cap in forest

Time for a new alt!

Can you reach a few areas listed here? Tbh I have pa for that exact reason too. And tbh if u need some extra cores till u find some and ur on xbox I can give u a few. I have a fair few cores.
---
Have you invested in any fusion core perks? There's one that with two ranks cuts out any extra usage of power when ur sprinting in pa. 
---
Last couple times I saw Graham, he had the fusion generator plan for about 250 caps.  Found him once in front of posiedon, and once near ... the mystery of the veil mansion.
---
I haven't spent much time on the right side of the map, but there are lots of places on the left side of the map to get cores.
---
 Check the table next to the processor at posiedon.  there is usually one there.  Sometimes someone is kind enough to get the plant running and connects the processor, then leaves the area - you can the get cores without taking over the plant.  
---
  When I completed the challenge at camden, I got two 2, and I've found others in an ammo box at camden.  An sometimes, in the generator there.
---
Any location that spawns power armor will usually yield a core.

I saw them recently but can't remember exactly which station.  Either Charleston or Sutton.

People that 'want' a Big Mac for the price of a michelin star meal deserve to be scoffed at.

Great idea, but I'd suggest just getting rid of the condition when canning.

The other canned goods in Fallout 76 don't have a shelf life.

Perhaps they could add a new perk card with the scouts DLC that teaches us how to preserve food indefinitely?

Ok, I see the trick is out so sooner or later the advanced version would reach the surface, might as well be now, might as well be from me. I'd like to introduce you to what happens when, instead using electrical signal to turn the traps on, you will instead hit them with a bloodied melee weapon.

You have a good post with a valid question. I find it interesting how much love there is for low hp builds I'm a bullet sponge only high hp builds so far (I'm a reckless player) currently I'm saving my bloodied weapons for an alt so I can try a low hp build.
---
That's true too.
---
I do use PA a bit and still don't use flux. But I just mix and match pieces if they break.
---
Great idea, maybe have a saloon style venue where we can play for caps, gear and shoot cheaters.
---
How to be Bethesda support
---
Check their system specs &gt; based on just looking at the number because you don't have a complete understanding of absolutely hardware heirarchies because this is an incredibly complex topic &gt; tell them their hardware does not meet minimum requirements &gt; close ticket
---
If their hardware happens to be the one explicitly listed as one of the recommended ones &gt; press Ctrl+V &gt; fill in the blanks next to "having a problem with" with information from their opening sentence. &gt; close ticket
---
Wait since when? I've always used Batteries included and have never seen missles weigh less than 2lbs or nukes less than 6lbs. 
---
You never need to spend hours farming flux. You just buy them online. Have you joined one of the markets yet?
---
I’ve got about 10 I could sell you but I won’t be on until this evening.
---
If you’re on xb1 that is...
---
Flatwoods always had them for me
---
Please, don't be salty. You are embarrassing yourself at this point.
---
Wrong sub bro
---
Tyler county fairgrounds, is where it happens. Good place to collect plastic.
---
Same, either Charleston or the Morgantown vendors (airport or train station). One of the three has the plans.
---
I think a big reason we see such a large amount of low hp bloodied builds is because a lot of people are interested in dps optimization above all else. Which results in everyone copying everyone and getting pretty much the same build. Which would be the same result OP will come to if he follows most advice. That’s why I advocate not seeking advice, and just finding out for yourself what playstyle and guns are your favourite. 
---
Phoenix vendor bot in watoga shopping area. I think he had it yesterday
---
No mod for consoles :( and yeah suggested multiple tines every single day I'm sure they're aware that we want it.
---
Yup, that is why if you make a turret base at the club you make it out of only foundations as they are indestructible and you can glitch the turrets inside the foundations to where they can't be targeted but can still shoot out.
---
Almost as embarrassing as the OP with that 'this cliche is definitely right this time' attitude. Ah well I suppose it's a change from the 'I bought this game yesterday and played 15 minutes, don't know why people are saying they are bored' posts. Same braindead levels of awareness though.
---
The problem is a lack of nuance among both fans and haters.
---
The problem is that Bethesda crippled their own population by releasing the game in the state that it was.   
---
What happens when a AAA title is released is that a truckload of players try it out on lunch, and then a percentage of them gives it up in a week or so while the rest keep on playing.   
---
However, FO76 release was unbelievably bad, it spawned rage, memes, mockery and Bethesda's PR team did everything they could to make things worse. The situation irrevocably damaged the game, and people are not willing to give it a chance anymore.  
---
Personally I preordered the tricentennial edition and I play the game for a few hours every couple of weeks when I get the chance (my 2012 pc can't handle it so I have to visit a LAN cafe near my place). To be honest, the vast majority of issues that existed on launch still exist to this day, and it saddens me because it could have been a decent addition to the Fallout franchise. I would still suggest it to people who like building stuff though, the game can satisfy your artistic cravings.
---
Me too. You just have to change it up a bit. Last night I found a lv 30 getting destroyed at Watoga. I went to help be a bodyguard and we ended up running laps around town together and it was a good time. 
---
All I ever see you do is complain. Why not just go play Fallout 4 if you don't like interacting with other players?
---
I haven't actually seen any other game that would be prone to false reports as much as Fallout76 is. It has a large communnity of PvE oriented people exposed to PvP people who lack tools to properly engage in consensual PvP experience.
---
The results are that you see your workshop is attacked by two people, you enter there, you see two guys in power armor, you are sporting sprint-oriented build with full cavalier set hence as long as you are not staggered, are sprinting, and they are not critvatsing you, you are indestructible to them. While what it actually is is hundreds of hours spent trading and learning the math of the game, the people who come into a fight with full HP and in Power Armor will only see a cheater.
---
Start a new character to see the problem is still there. If it is not, then your characters mutations may be bugged (it can happen when they are updated in a patch), and removing/rebuilding them is often the cure. 
---
Oh.  Ok.  You think your opinion matters *objectively*.  Haha.  Poor thing.
---
That's damn good for being your first person. Keep up the artwork!
---
They spawned in the sanctity of my small personal room within a 5 story structure and proceeded to beat me with pitch forks and axes.
---
Ok thanks for the update
---
That is why you report players using foundation and los exploits. I can’t wait for the smaller but effective Ban Round 2
---
Nice! I will check that out!
---
Lol and I'm mostly seeing level 10-30 people :o
---
&gt;  Why would I risk a chance of getting a disease everytime I hit something.
---
It'd be perfect for Plague Walkers
---
45/50 is the max level for gear.  Nothing exists beyond that.  After that it's just maximizing mods and legendary affixes to fit your build.
---
That's kind of what he was saying...
---
bleh, all the low level characters I see now are 400+ players leveling up an alt
---
The only problem I have right now with the game is how toxic are the people. The players on this game are all friendly, but anywhere else you get disliked. I can't talk about this game with my friends because they think it's garbage.
---
So it's basically like a pet Iguana. 
---
Awesome thansk
---
They don't care. Literally 90% of the remaining player base uses building exploits of some kind to get around BGS shitty coding. Just go look at the post about camp build limits it turned into everyone explaining the best way to bug the neon letters so they don't snap to each other. LOL
---
That's a great picture, too.  Nice one.
---
It would be funny if the ghouls could use the stuff they carry, I can picture it now; Vault Dwellers all over the wasteland with bobby pins superglued all over them.
---
Another issue is the more they fix, break, or change this game it makes changing your game impossible and shortens the time I'll be playing this game. 
---
I have. I just don’t use it myself and wondering if I should just sell what I got
---
TI(apparently)L that you can complete the quest more than once/day.  \*facepalm\*  
---
Not sure where you got that from.
---
The problem is that the game has already become almost bug free and it got better, but the youtubers still make drama of anything (like the "pay to win" scandal of the unstoppables suits, I saw videos like "Bethesda lied to us")
---
Line in the Sand event at the Assylum always (or almost always) rewards with power cores. If you have more than one player in it it's easy and kinda fun.
---
I'm sorry that you feel the need to criticize the likings of others on the Internet, bro. 
---
There may be some kind of bug with this. The guild I am in had this exact issue, one of us was on a server and seemed to be the only one on it. We all joined on them.
---
Our guild members were the only one on the server.
---
It was glorious. We each did our own thing, spoke on discord and agreed to keep high level characters out of quest zones low-level characters would be in. All three of my low level alts killed the Whitesprings Golf Ghouls...
---
This is really what I hope private servers are like, just groups of friends exclusively playing together.
---
Which markets would you recommend?
---
No, all you need is instigating sniper rifle using VATs crit to the head. Absolutely can 1 shot someone with the slap damage from it.
---
Maybe Sunday or Monday evening. My off days
---
Induviduality is nice it'd be dumb for everyone to have the same build. I remember when everyone had duped tse shotguns it was lame.
---
Laser weapons are my favorite type of Fallout weapon I really want the durabilty fixed. I just want to run around saying pew pew instead of pew pew fucking thing broke again dammit!!!!!
---
First thing is go through your stash and start scrapping stuff.  
---
Duplicate weapons is a good place to start.  
---
I haven't found much need for glass and bones.
---
Once you have learned a plan or recipie, you dont need to keep it.  
---
I put them in an overseers cache or find a sub 15 level and give it to them.
---
Train stations all have vendors (and your stash).  Camden has a robot vendor, so does the airport (not wade, the other one with all the scorched)
---
I'm L32 - I'm able to do some of the stuff along the savage divide - top of the world, path of the wind, but it a high level has been around, both can be difficult.
---
Toxic Valley and the forest are your friends.  Even after a couple months, I'm still discovering new places in the forest.  Edges of ash heap are ok, but lewiston is exteremly hazardous.  I've been to whitesprings 3-4 times, but died a lot.
---
Given how any criticism of a product is taken as a personal attack by people who enjoy that product it would probably blow your mind that there is an entire industry built on 'criticizing the likings of others on the internet'. In fact, before the internet they did it on the TV, and the radio. They also wrote it down and said it in the streets before those were a thing.
---
'It is ok to like bad things but that does not make them good' is not a lesson most people here ever came to terms with.
---
Over and over and over and over
---
I had a server to myself last night, too. Great for farming a recently nuked Whitesprings! I just fast traveled back and forth between WS and Watoga and collected hundreds of legendaries. Then, after some hours, the Golf Club was nothing but diseased lvl 1 eyebots (how funny was that, but good for the Kill X Robots challenges I'm working on), and shortly after that, the game crashed.
---
Funny thing, though: four or five workshops on the map were taken, and the player icons remained there all the time, even when those players were nowhere to be found. And no, I wasn't wanted either, also there was a lonely lvl 21 player still on the map for some time, exploring the Ash Heap region.
---
Cue in automated standard response: But maybe everyone was crouching! ;-) Lol.
---
You will still need flux to build a Rad Shower or to make Serums if you use those.
---
Otherwise I only occasionally pop in to a nuke zone for yellowcake to make Orbital Strike Bacon.
---
Oh man......I laughed......"Do you have bird bones.....you really should have!" That's some funny stuff.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you just want to clarify something.  Griefing can take many forms and doesn't necessarily have to be harassment level behavior.  For example putting your mic down next to your speakers and blasting incomprehensibly loud music to everyone in area chat, no objective benefit besides annoying others? Absolutely! but I dont necessarily think the griefer in this example should have their account suspended or anything.
---
 LET ME LOOK THROUGH THE TOURIST VIEWFINDERS!!!! For Feynman’s sake, you’ve got scopes, binoculars, etc. - the functionality is already in the game - it’s just a little touch of immersion.
---
My camp is located next to Watoga and theres a bunch of cute beavers that hang aroud building a log DAM next to it. Sometimes they end up inside my house, but they are very polite and non-destructive.
---
We know that radiation makes every living things strong, aggressive and hungry. 
---
How can you see what coming the the atom shop?
---
Lucky hole mine is probably the best spot for lead as long as you have enough acid to break the lead ore down
---
I think the reason I get the same 2 scorchbeasts spawn when I load in is my level. It's happened a few times at my camp and a few times loading into other areas on the map. What are the chances that would happen so many times so far from a fissure site. 
---
2 men enter..1 man leaves..
---
I'm pretty sure the ones you speaking of are for decoration only they can't be picked. Any flower or plant which can be picked will turn into a nuked version.
---
It’s great! The lips are just a little big
---
But No Mans Sky is so good now, I highly recommend it 
---
slap damage is capped
---
It just makes no sense. They can't be that nutritional lol
---
I attribute mine to being from an event. My camp is high on that cliff overlooking Munitions Plant, and whoever owned it decided to try to get high ground on the defend the Scorchbeast event. Right to my camp. He was like a level 45. I got a robot arm, level 30 (I'm lvl 35) out of it though.
---
oh, and presuming you have a set of power armor, euqip the pieces on the frame, or if you ar not around a PA station, just transfer the pieces to the chassis.  Its instant weight reduction - the chassis weighs 10 whether it has parts equipped or not.
---
since the pieces are 15+ # each, your'll save that much weight in your stash.
---
Caveat: you cannot store parts above your level in the frame...you can store raider (L15) and T45 (L25) in a chassis, but not 51, 60, or X01, as they are L35+ parts).
---
I suspect once they are certain all duping methods are patched they may release higher level legendaries to fix the market by making the duped ones obsolete in comparison.
---
Tell that to the level 290 that got 1 shotted on video yesterday that got posted. That wasn't wanted or in a workshop. 
---
If you changed your hair to ginger you're nearly Tommen from Game of Thrones.
---
Also Maxson is prettier.
---
....they're just raiders tho, have you ever played a Fallout game before? It's nothing new
---
 There's still no Silver Submachine Gun skin in the **Atomic Store**. 
---
Really? Shop? Why not just in the fucking game without spending money? Like the one from Fallout 4, that already exists and just needs to copy pasted?
---
I've been doing the same thing for the last 15 levels of my build because when I was a newbie a guy helped me out and was super gracious in teaching me the ropes of the wasteland.
---
Long story short - a lvl 91 found me when I lvl 8 and walked me through Summerville letting me get a shot off on every SM before he one shotted them. Stood by and let me grab all the loot and when I couldn't carry anymore he picked it up and carried it back to the Oversees camp and dropped it for me to collect and sell. Totally AWESOME way to introduce a newbie. Also showed me how to farm soot flower to make healing salve. That alone saved my butt a number of times early on.
---
I try to find a low lvl once a session and take them to one of my locations that I call the "circuit" where they can follow along and farm xps and grab gear. My way of paying if forward but you re right it's become a lot harder now...
---
I don't believe foundations can be destroyed. And I'd rather have a normal looking building versus the floating house thing. The ground level stuff only attacks fences and posts. Scorchbeasts do more widespread damage either way. But I feel like I would spawn those wherever I go. 
---
Definitely seen these at the Pleasant Valley train station vendor.    They don't show up every time but they certainly can show up.
---
Being able to accept that things can be just good enough, not perfect, is a pretty healthy attitude. 
---
https://youtu.be/RbtflLkVv4E
---
Having said that, fix bugs pls Bethesda.
---
&gt;almost bug free
---
Looking at the post launch track record for *every single bethesda developed game ever.* I can hardly believe that's the case.
---
You need to have anchor. I've lost a lot too. You need someone who you can rely on not to leave the server, tell them what you're doing so you can always get back.
---
This will always work unless you both crash.
---
RC
---
I had a friend on the same server
---
Came here to say this.
---
ask friends for help. They have to shoot it, and then run far away from your camp, then kill it. Deathclaw will not ressurect after that
---
There is a huge gap between 'good enough' and 'perfect'. That has been a constant logical flaw in this sub 'No game is perfect so this one is fine as it is'. Why does the latest triple-A game get to scrape along the lower boundary of acceptability while smaller studios pump out absolutely stellar games?
---
You can always add those support beams to the corners of the house and make it looked propped up, i have seen a few like this as many don't like the floating look.
---
I don't really understand why you feel the need to tell others that what they like is "bad" or "good". Does it make you feel better somehow? Are you simply looking for attention? 
---
I had a floating spaceship camp I had to deconstruct because in this version of the game atom shop floors don't work for me.
---
To express my frustration in being unable to use own base, I scraped the spaceship and built what I consider to be the universal sign of disapproval of those whose voices are being unheard. Yeah, its an eight-floor tall floating dick.
---
But to the point - as a 400+h player I have severely limited my playtime last few weeks and I consider new content a reason to return as I loved the game up until the challenges ended. I agree new stuff is a way to go, but I also agree I want to discuss overhauls of systems. Two most pressing matters IMO are way to make use out of unwanted crappy legendary items, and actual possibility of rebuilding the America. They both need an overhaul.
---
You believe that what you judge to be good is of high quality - hence the comparison of Big Mac to Michelin star meals.  You feel that because you are an able determiner of quality that you are superior.  Your superiority gives you the right, nay the duty, to scoff at those who do not share your opinion.  They are unable to view the world through the same lens as you therefore they are inferior.
---
If you feel as though anyone 'deserves' to be scoffed for what they want then you must feel that there is an objective truth behind what is good and what is bad when it comes to entertainment.  You take pride in your knowledge of you chosen interest and opinions which vary from yours threaten you.
---
And that's ok.  We all need an identity.  You value your judgment and you derive pride from what you see as having superior judgment.  By coming into this board and debasing yourself by giving into your petty need to defend your superior judgment you continue to get sweet little dopamine drips which allows you to continue seeing that the world is ok - that you are still superior in your judgement.
---
And that's totally cool - the world needs all sorts of different people - people with all sorts of merits and flaws.
---
You have yours - I have mine - go - live - be free!
---
I'm sorry but this is one of the worst ideas I've ever heard for fo76, as a high level player 250 on my main the only thing that is any threat to me what so ever is another player. I can less than 10 shot the SBQ and she never attacks me, normal scorchbeasts can use the Sonic attack all they want I have hundreds of stimpaks and super stims ontop of quality armour and defence skills and when they land I normally one shot them.
---
I get it your mad you got killed in PvP but that's no reason to try and remove it from the Adventure mode.
---
Why is everyone doing stuff like this on PS4
---
Where’s all the PC players @
---
I had to move because it kept plopping me down in my little pond giving me waterborne diseases
---
Also why isn't the entire estate reduced to a smoking glowing wasteland given the hundreds of direct hits it has had from nuclear missiles.
---
My *suspension of disbelief* needs to know.
---
ZeniMax Online Studios was founded specifically for the purpose of making ESO and spent 7 years developing it, whereas Battlecry was co-opted a year before Fallout 76 launched - obviously Bethesda rushed things and released the game far too early.
---
If I see any of you cops you better be packin'. Ain't no law in the wasteland lol
---
This is what I do with flux. I sell it right away before it turns, and then I sell the weapons/armor I picked up in the nuke zone later because that stuff doesn't spoil. It's an easy 600+ caps and since I'm already running around the whole nuke zone anyway, I don't even consider it farming.
---
What do you do now actually? Like main content and gameplay
---
Lol, bullshit
---
Even if true. Doesn't make it not griefing. Only funny griefing.
---
Good day sir
---
Well it’s got a few campaigns, I do enjoy exploring the plants, building bases and over all just playing the game honestly. I do also tend my farm and do the occasional grind for money.
---
That is awesome I just watched a YouTube video on it thanks.
---
Yeah I'm xbox one, I've managed to find myself 3, feel free to add me my GT is the same as my name here ^^
---
I was hoping so badly that they were going to do a three dogg type of thing with her. But nope she just sits there on repeat.
---
So why can’t you kill it?
---
Because they’re probably in sentinels x assasins armour or maybe you’re just bad 
---
theres no video posted tho
---
and he was in some sort of PVP,you can test slap damage yourself it is capped
---
&gt;Orbital Strike Bacon
---
 That sounds delicious :)
---
But still reading this sub, why bother?
---
Oh we're at 800 now? Okay I'll play again. 
---
I have, which is why I know you can 1 shot people with instigating vats crits still. There is pictures, he can't share the video on the subreddit because it shows the players names, but if you ask him nicely he will share the video with you privately.
---
The only one that was in pvp was the low level "lure" with the 50 wanted bounty, the other 3 were had no bounties or workshops.
---
If all 4 had bounties people wouldn't show up, they didn't have bounties or anything because they were using the single bountied person as a trap.
---
I honestly would play this
---
Write a support ticket to Bethesda and explain your situation.
---
Something similar happened to me a while ago and they refunded me the Atoms, no questions asked.
---
I’ve been hearing a few of these stories since the last patch :( They might have changed something. I’m so sorry this happened to you!
---
Keep coming back!
---
They also stated that before FO76 came out they brought people in from all their other locations to help finish it, which would have included people who worked on ESO.
---
Still probably a trap, their team mates are waiting in the wings.
---
2 shot lever action  
---
explosive handmade,
---
 you can even get the tse version cheap of each relatively cheap  they are still pretty good even after the nerf
---
I bought it at pleasant valley yesterday
---
What’s prestiging? When is it getting released?
---
No one can resist it.
---
I still do this.
---
Only do it with aid/junk/cheap stuff
---
Never risk the perfect gear against a crash.
---
&gt;You believe that what you judge to be good is of high quality - hence the comparison of Big Mac to Michelin star meals.

---
Absolutely not. It's called a consensus.
---
&gt;If you feel as though anyone 'deserves' to be scoffed for what they want then you must feel that there is an objective truth behind what is good and what is bad when it comes to entertainment. You take pride in your knowledge of you chosen interest and opinions which vary from yours threaten you.
---
Good and bad are not synonyms for fun and unfun. Yes, there is an objective relative scale of good &lt;-&gt; bad. I am only 'threatened' by opinions which vary insomuch as if a company that used to make objective blockbusters realises it can survive just as well on shallow microtransaction chatrooms because people enjoy the boot to their throat then that is the end of the blockbuster games industry.
---
&gt;And that's ok. We all need an identity. You value your judgment and you derive pride from what you see as having superior judgment. By coming into this board and debasing yourself by giving into your petty need to defend your superior judgment you continue to get sweet little dopamine drips which allows you to continue seeing that the world is ok - that you are still superior in your judgement.
---
Yep. It's like watching children repeatedly stick their hand in a fire over and over again. But every time they turn around and say 'NAH it won't hurt you just hate fun'. It really is a fascinating social commentary, the repetitive hyperdefensive patterns of game loyalists. The same arguments, the same positions. Anthem is a mirror for Fallout 76. You could literally predict what posts were going to be made and when. All the while you sit there thinking 'I wonder if these people are self aware enough to know just how stereotypical they are being?' They sit there and claim they are the only free thinkers because they haven't been brainwashed by the insidious Youtube cartel seeking to undermine this GOTY. All the while repeating verbatim the exact words others before them have levelled in defence of other bad titles.
---
Aight
---
Prestiging in most games is when you reset your level to gain a prestige level which in some games like CoD it means nothing but in others there are bonuses
---
Had some really good trades tonight, didn't lose them, so the night is still more good than bad :)
---
It’s the noise of the Sonic Generator. You can find one at Fort Defiance. 
---
I have revived many people but have no credit for that medal too
---
Jesus Christ, that would give you a permanent boner 
---
I’ve even heard others refer to the game as therapeutic, so if you’re ever having a bad time, hop on no mans sky and let the good vibes ride 
---
r/FO76filthycasuals has a Grahm channel!
---
Lol im lvl 197, 600 hours in game im not bad lol just can't understand why pa is so bad compared to said armor,its law breaking 
---
I accidentally attacked another player in a horde of ghouls at WhiteSpring and was taken into custody. 
---
Can you help me 
---
\&gt;  its pretty cheap now
---
Oof. Right in the feels.
---
Why spend money? I never did and I habe plenty of Atom Store items. Just doing challenges. 
---
Would be nice. The current Workshop system is pretty crappy. A while back I took a workshop for the weekly and was gonna leave it after the defense event but even though I was very far away from the claim workbench someone triggered it and instakilled me with gun sneak attack (players still do way too much damage &gt;.&gt;). 
---
I ignored him when it triggered cuz I didn't need the workshop and thought I had to slap them or contest the claim field for them to do full damage but apparently not (I had pacifist enabled). But he wasn't after it anyways and only did it for the suckerpunch kill and didn't finish the claim. Since I died the moment the event ended it didn't give me credit so I wasted my time fighting buggy spawns for nothing. :v 
---
This was before the patch that lets you contest it from anywhere though or whatever they changed; I assume it's even worse now but I haven't looked at it yet.  With PvP literally being a 1hit killfest back and forth it's not really entertaining and I rather not participate in the form that it's in currently.
---
Is that a friendly mutant?
---
I can assure you this incident was not our badge. 
---
I got stuck in an unwinable pvp spawn die scenario last night.
---
I’m not one to go out of my way for pvp but when someone is being a jerk I will. 
---
So I’m at this guys camp near whitesprings, watching this group of 3 people destroy it, for what reason I don’t know.
---
And to be honest I don’t know how the pvp even got initiated in the first place, but there was a level 76, level 117 and a level 203.
---
Even when I just hit regular respawn. I would end up same place initiated in pvp.
---
So whatever, I’m in it anyway, I’m a melee build, and with all the buffs I can do 1600 on a heavy swing. With the armor penetration that’s enough to one shot 9/10 people.
---
But these guys, I couldn’t even 4 shot them, even the level 76. Never mind the level 203, and they were all melee builds too. 
---
They even traded with me initially b4 this started and there wasn’t one weapon or piece of armor they had that wasn’t godlike, 
---
3 star everything. Anyway it sucked. Lost half my money before I gave up. 
---
It’s pretty clear they go around pvp everyone for caps then buy primo gear, which is bs for those who don’t wana pvp like that, I’m not gona take people’s caps just to go buy a big axe. 
---
Anyway, rant over. Lol
---
Yup. Spent an hour or so calling people out on their shit on the red dead sub yesterday. One guy kep saying how FO76 sucked - I think he was triggered that FO76 was compared to Red Dead - but could never state why he hated the game, or his personal experience with it. 
---
My base has no turrets and doesnt obstruct anything, still evil?
---
Caravan might be a later creation and thus not exist yet.  I just want a safe place to give Wastelad a try.  
---
Plants Vs. Zombies.
---
I'm hoping one day, we can start official guilds and stuff in 76. I mean, if they're coming out with that "Raid a Vault" thing later on in the year, I think having a guild would make it a lot easier.
---
Jesus - are you kidding me?  This was meant as a joke.  So many whiny little snowflakes.
---
I really like this idea
---
we already have pipboy games!
---
That's it exactly? We suspend disbelief but subject to some rules, otherwise it would all be some arbitrary mashup. Like things should generally be treated alike. But the pretty flowers aren't. 
---
Sigh. That makes sense. And also doesnt.
---
Mmmmmmmmmmm
---
fuck the police
---
Nah glitch building is generally cool, its just a small subsection of it, like the above, that is uncool.
---
Awesome. I got a shower and let mutations run wild so I guess I’m good. Thanks a bunch for the knowledge. 
---
What's the location for this?
---
Lol 8 floor tall dick nice. I'd have went with a middle finger. Also FYI the Legendary vendor will handle the unwanted legendaries. By letting you reroll them. Still RNG but it's something. Let's just hope they do it right and eliminate some of the RNG and the cost isn't too stupid.
---
There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead.  Mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead, well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do. Go through his clothes and look for loose change. 
---
That said, are you sure they are not actually fully dead when you try to revive them?  There is "dead" and "DEAD".  One can be revived, the other cannot.
---
I think I was there with you last night, did you end up killing her with about 30 secs left on the timer? It was very odd, would hit her with my All Rise and wouldn't see any drop in damage. Went though all my stim packs, about 1500 5.56mm, and all my corn soup. Glad it wasn't a waste thou and was able to take her down. 
---
Good idea, I've only my main so about time I invested in a new character, just to test this would be worth the effort.
---
The game is far from "Pay to win" but what scandal is there with the unstoppables outfits? I don't think it's really talked about on this sub. I doubt it's a legit issue. 
---
Hmmm It is a good set up
---
Reset the level to what?
---
It seems like you're agreeing with me - but see it as good.
---
It didn't seem to work for me for ages either. That is until my buddy u/da13371337bpf repeatedly commited suicide. It worked eventually 👍👍
---
That’s a legendary roll that you can get on armor you can’t learn it.
---
1. A gun to tag monsters
---
2. A gun to crit-shot players
---
3. A gun to kill monsters
---
Or
---
A quad harpoon gun
---
1
---
How is it law breaking ? With the right perks and legendary effects armour can be as good as power armour , armour is different to power armour in this sense because you can’t have legendary power armour and there’s not that many power armour perks which means that it can’t be made as overpowered in PVE x PVP.

Watoga station always has the fusion generator recipe
---
If you want to sit in the 'my opinion is equal to your opinion' crowd then you can go and join the flat earthers, anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers.
---
Is it possible theres some server lag induced from enemies just being there?
---
Yeah that's the point of my post. Perfection is virtually impossible so it's ok to be ok. Fine to be fine. Yeah stellar games should be applauded but that doesn't mean that less than stellar games should be hated. You said there's a huge spectrum of good to amazing, there's not just perfect and shit.
---
Mongrels also apparently hold a grudge against bath tubs that are laying around junk yards.  They will go after those more often than not.
---
The multi head thing is just the heavy club mod. I have a 2☆ vamp club I ocassionally use I can clear whitesprings with it and never use a stim. 
---
I have over 400 hours and have still never seen a blunderbus (a faction mate finds them and gave me a blunderbus pistol, but I have never seen them)
---
Thats my point, its on the roadmap, but the fact of him being a roadmap IMO is enough to warrant a discussion about the role of RNG in character progression, and anything that touches this subject means overhaul.
---
I havent had issues loading in. Using camp fires for my grow room
---
you can't he was in some sort of pvp

After the annexation of Canada in 2072, the Canadian flag has ceased to exist.

Playing other games.

I'm level 173 right now and sitting at 3k caps. I've never had more than 10k caps. If you are maxed out on caps it's because you've been obsessively making cap runs daily and trading for duped gear and serums at rock bottom prices.
---
The reason you have too many caps is because you only needed to pay 200 caps for those mutations and the only reason they were only 200 caps is because everyone and their mother has the recipe thanks to duping. It's basic supply and demand economics.
---
The only people having problems with caps are the people who are constantly rushing end game. The cap system is working perfectly fine for the casual player and by raising the cap limit they're only making end game gear even more unattainable for the casual.
---
Well your character needs to be level 50 or above. When you prestige you go back to 0 but gain things like better drops and higher guns based it. In Borderlands 2 when you prestige started back at the beginning but everything was more difficult but the loot was better. It's not really clear how they'll do it, I am sure some people with level 200+ will not.
---
I do not think anyone wants to waste their time to pay for a server. *Cough* Battlefield. *Cough*
---
In the context of the fallout world it's law breaking, so why didn't American soldiers wear sentinel armor in anchorage during the war saving millions of dollars lol thats why 
---
I... did you even read the post? They were all in PVP from trying to ambush him. Good lord, man, even your “evidence” supports me- he talks about how HE was worried about dying from slap damage because he was a low health build! Yet he still escaped the initial ambush with 3-4 guys shooting at him, because they were only doing slap damage (he hadn’t fought back yet)
---
Nope, it's working just fine.
---
That sounds nice.
---
Sure. Hold on.
---
Were they near to where you were? 
---
I think containers can reset if there's nobody in the zone, or if somebody enters it after you've logged out (like how enemies can respawn at higher levels).
---
I paid 55 EUR.  I'm happy with it.
---
*Holds up protest sign* "Block the Todd"
---
Anyone noticed that sometimes the stashes aren’t even there, and other times they’re there but empty, even after at least
---
a day since you’ve looted them? Wtf is going on there?
---
I've considered the overseer's caches, but I've always been worried that whatever I put in there will be overwritten when a player comes along who is discovering it for the first time.  I don't know for certain if that would happen or not, but have personally always been wary
---
If you didn't have enough Atom, then you should have bought more. This is exactly why they should not bring it back. Limited time items encourages people to spend money.
---
You can’t “learn” any legendary effects. If you hadn’t realized, sentinel is a legendary effect. 
---
Never even heard of those!
---
Okay I view changing RNG as more of a QOL patch and not really an overhaul. I was seeing the term overhaul as a complete rewrite of the game. I'm not too familiar with game developement so that's why I misunderstood
---
This is Bethesda with a triple-A, premium priced title in a hugely competitive market. With this price point, this studio, this legacy of games, 'ok' should not be acceptable.
---
Having to scroll through all my witch costumes and civil war hats is very very annoying.
---
I have an alt that I got up to about 80 or so before I realized it was completely screwed, might prestige that one depending on how it works
---
Very nice!  
---
I'm only lvl 49 but am working my way toward something like what you've done.  
---
Have you run into issues with one terminal getting stuck at 'initializing'..?  Seems it could be a bug on XB1 but not sure, not too many appear to have built them.
---
1. its Fallout
---
2. Exploring
---
3. Graphics
---
4. Lore
---
5. visual humor and IRL references
---
Regular armor can have legendary effects. It takes forever to get a good 3☆ legendary roll. PA is very common. IMO There's nothing wrong with rare items being powerful.
---
That's amazing because I was going to bring that up!  The consensus used to be that the earth was flat - but now the consensus is that it is not!  Which is true if both involved consensus?  Consensus doesn't inform truth of the matter in only informs truth of opinion.
---
But i'm seriously interested - i'd like to know what makes a game objectively good or bad - anytime i get in one of these discussions no one will answer.  To me it makes no sense - unless you're speaking from a purely technical standpoint - but for a game that makes no sense to me.  Impressive technology does not make a game 'good' because the purpose of a game is as a tool to enable play.
---
It seems to me that being fun is the purpose of a game - and if it does so that it is succeeding at being a game.
---
You seem to think that there is some other means of determining the quality of a game outside of whether or not it is fun.  In fact you've staked your identity on it.  So please enlighten me to your worldview - you have my attention - I want to understand you, you beautiful being you.
---
There was an event where if you wore an Unstoppable's Outfit you gained +15 Max HP, and for everyone in your team wearing a unique one, that's another +15 Max HP (so a total of +60 HP). 
---
The Unstoppable Outfits could only be bought using in-game currency ATOMs though. 
---
Honestly I got the ATOMs needed pretty quick since there is Daily, Weekly and Account Challenges that throw ATOMs at you for one of the outfits. 
---
I also don't see why an extra 15-60 HP was a massive deal. 
---
On my only character, I made a run to the Munitions Factory in my late 20 levels, just to check it out.  I ran into some tough mobs (and away from tougher ones) near the factory, but the current owner, level 150-something, dropped a barricade so I could seek refuge.  
---
Another high level player showed up, and as I was using the workshop owner’s benches, I heard a shift in music.  After five minutes, I turned around and found the players serenading me with a banjo and steel guitar.  Most inviting was an empty chair with an acoustic guitar perched against it.  
---
The icing on the cake?  The three instruments together sounded great.  We played for several more minutes before I stood up, gave them both a thumbs up and went on my way.
---
Really depends on the benefits, if there are a lot of passive things, why not
---
GUYS GUYS WAIT WHAT IF THE USELESS JUNKIES PREFIX WAS REALLY SCALING ON THE WORST ADDICTION EVER? HOARDING!
---
That could be the problem. 
---
I move from wi-fi again to Ethernet, restarted everything and the problem persisted as I fought the WhiteSpring mobs, though it also happens with single enemies or just a few. But lag could indeed be causing this, what to do though, this melee slowdown really ruins the fun and freedom of playing melee with no power armor.
---
I just found that out the hard way. Do I gotta make a new one?
---
That’s why my base is two foundations tall   All the way around.  ( it’s like a 20x8 base long wide)  and then another regular story after that.   It looks like a huge barn with the workshop area open on the sides.  
---
Moira Brown's persona transferred into robot form? And the plot thickens, dun duh dun! I honestly found Moira to be a touch on the annoying side. It's been a long time though, maybe my memory of her is off.
---
Usually the instruments do sync, rhythm and chord/ note- progression- wise. It’s just some mountain music, but sitting in a group of players is pretty fun. 
---
Holy shit, Preston Garvey is Ace Rimmer?  
---
I never understood people shitting on games they never actually played.. 
---
Like if I hear a game is bad I usually just won’t buy it and leave it at that until I see something that changes my mind. 
---
Looks really cool!
---
The thing is that RNG is currently in the very centre of character progression. It is a foundation upon which the rest of the mechanics are placed. It you anyhow changed the role of RNG, make it, lets say, path to optimise your gear from 95% perfect to 100% perfect instead of main tool of character progression from 10% to 100%, then you need to fill the game with an alternative system to do the 10-95% progress, and hence every activities around which the players are focusing will be changed, resulting in a completely new game that just looks this same. In my understanding anything that changes the relationship between building your character and RNG is an overhaul.
---
I like taking workshops to turn them into rest stops for other players with every workbench, water purifiers, cooking station, lights and lots of cat artwork everywhere.
---
The only time I ever had someone 'challenge' me for a workshop (it was Sunshine Meadows), they were almost double my level, they killed me in one shot and then they didn't even stay to keep the workshop. 
---
It certainly didn't feel challenging or fun from my end.
---
I wonder what people think when they see a level 200 doing leader of the pack...
---
I’m pretty dead center too. Only mole rats  attack me.   They love my tatos 
---
I think you can find one in the little shed just to the left of you when you fast travel to Harpers Ferry. The shed is just outside the fortified wall of Harpers Ferry
---
I just have guns.  With bullets.  I shoot things.  When I shoot them lots they usually die.
---
I have found exactly one legendary weapon almost worth having - a quad hunting rifle.  But a pipe gun ways less and does the same damage, so I just keep using my pipe sniper rifle.  So I reload more often.  BFD.
---
(Level 74 ATM).
---
Currently carrying -- silenced pipe sniper rifle, hardened receiver handmade with piercing mag, civil unrest, lever gun to soak up any .45 ammo I find lying around, assaultron blade if I feel like killing radroaches.
---
I would love that. I long ago stopped fast traveling to help defend a workshop because I was almost always the only one to show up. I like seeing and fighting alongside other players.
---
&gt;&lt;also makes all workshops into settlements&gt;  
---
Hey, nice defences, would be a pity if super mutants *spawned inside your eight foot high walls that you depended on to keep you safe...*
---
Might have to become a raider
---
Cool! My gt is the same as my username as well :)
---
Green Iguanas are horrible pets.
---
Nuke zones do too much radiation damage to survive (Long) without power armor or a hazmat suit- both have hidden bonus radiation resist you cannot match any other way. People have tested back when you could stack rad-x. Even when over 1k rad resist from chems, more than a hazmat suit, they were taking like 13/sec radiation damage. 
---
Is it fair and balanced? Oh hell no. But it is what it is, at least for now. FYI. 
---
I like the idea of option 1. I had no clue what I was doing for my first 25 levels, tbh, and now I'm trying to fix it (at level 42). It'd be nice if it was allowed every 50 levels? That seems reasonable imo as a reset option. Wipe and let you rebuild.
---
Here is what I do. Have a friend who you tell what you're doing. He needs to remain in the same spot somewhere safe where another player can't just some and take your stuff.
---
When your with your friend, drop one item of non-value, a piece of food or something. Move back and see if your back appears on the floor. The reason you do this is because things have fallen through the world plenty for me. 
---
Once your sure the bag is there, drop your look in to it.
---
Leave the server, grab your other character, join your friend (still at the bag) and bobs's your uncle!
---
Done
---
Oh damned, thanks mate
---
Fool me once shame on me fool me twice and I probably did something to deserve it. That being said I might come back when the new content is out, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
I must be stupid, lol
---
Usually, if you have stuff to offload, may people do that into the blue suitcase at Watoga train station, or at Whitesprings (forget exactly where). That way nobody have to take another's death bag by mistake.
---
Or you could just offload into any old furniture any place lots of players go.
---
Frig Nukashine. . . I want to mass produce Nuka grenades. So I can strap a bulk ton of them to my next nuke. Nuke the entire Cranberry Bog, now that's what I'm talkin' about!
---
Yes,. He clearly states "the other 3 weren't tagged for PvP". Aka they weren't hostile. They were waiting for him to attack the low level friend who was tagged for PvP.
---
It is obvious you didn't read it.
---
I don’t usually because they are useful around packs of legendary glowing ghouls.
---
The worst part is that it is probably a bed hog!
---
Is this a confirmed up coming feature? I haven’t seen anything on or heard about this 
---
Whitesprings and West Tek
---
I can appreciate that you want this, but since Excavator is my least favorite PA (I absolutely hate the look, everyone wears it, it has garbage damage resistance stats) I haven't collected many mod plans for that just yet. I have a base level 45 full suit, and I have a couple people that can install Calibrated Shocks, but that's about it at this time. I have to pick and choose carefully what plans I buy because they're expensive, and I'm pretty low on violet flux, but I could make it happen with a little time. 
---
Oh I know. Keep in mind it's not really a big deal. Like I said before it's annoying at best. It's just odd. Especially when the game is encouraging you to "rebuild". Attacking players and crops makes sense. Structures? Not so much. It's just an odd choice to include into the game. 
---
Unfortunately not that I can tell :c
---
Haha, that guy saying "Oooh, no" as he's flying away and falling down, voice fading as he's realizing what happened. So funny. I'd be pissed but laughing at the same time.
---
I've read through a handful of threads on this topic and what a recurring theme is only comparison of each series.  I get that, but if you haven't already, you should mix and match for the ultimate set for your needs and desires.
---
I'm currently lvl 110 and prefer not to wear PA except in certain situations, like nuke zones or when I get weighted down.  Instead of having multiple sets of PA for different purposes I've put together the following as my general PA and carry it with me always so its always available.  That 10lbs is not a big deal to me.
---
My PA load out is a combination of X-01 and Ultracite.
---
Helmet - X-01 with sensor array for a boost to perception
---
Torso - X-01 with jet pack
---
Legs - X-01 with calibrated shocks
---
Arms - Ultracite, no mods
---
This gives me 536/495/495 (ballistic/energy/radiation)
---
It works for me.
---
Nay sir, you cannot one shot someone through slap damage. No amount of damage stacking or exploits will one shot someone through slap damage currently. 
---
&gt; the other 3 were had no bounties or workshops
---
They were in the same party though, that's how this griefing tactic works... one player is wanted and when someone attacks him the other 3 in the party are able to kill them  
---
Dude bobble head stacking has been fixed for like 3 patches. Lol of course that doesn't work since that glitch was patched months ago. Lol
---
Idk, I got in a random PVP encounter last night and some dude in PA apparently was AFK for a second when I respawned, I unloaded a shitload of AutoGrenades at him and he wouldn’t die (and I’m a low health build in PA, my AutoGrenade are like 400+ damage each. Even if he had fireproof that’s still 200 damage a shot against power armor). And he wasn’t moving.
---
2 terminals controlling 2 switches, 1 switch inside and low, the other outside and high.  (Though still reachable to those with jump mutation. - Something to work out later..)  
---
I had it working for a day on XB1 before 1 of the terminals suddenly went to stuck at 'initializing' and haven't been able to get it working again since. - But its only been broken for a couple hrs of game time so maybe I just need to play around with it more to get it working again.
---
You can build foundations on a campfire I believe.
---
You won't do it. You're scurred /sarcasm 
---
Seriously, doooooooooo it! Lol.
---
Joke's on you. I've got bird bones. 
---
Most damage boost sources are multiplicative, which is why you can end up with insane numbers with bloodied/adrenal reaction builds. 
---
Yeah see this is a good system but in Borderlands you keep your level but you can start the main story over and get better drops
---
Get yourself a 10mm with a silencer(not absolutely necessary) . Get a rad suit, go to a nuke zone or server hop until you find one. One shot(don't worry about killing) everything. Let everyone much higher level then you kill everything. As long as you get one shot on it you'll get XP. 
---
Run the Lone Wanderer Perk maxed out too.
---
So....you’re asking that, from a gameplay perspective, why you’re not allowed to have god mode pretty much? 
---
I don’t know but probably not, because that would be a well thought out mechanic and effect. 
---
I wouldn't hold Fallout fans to the same analytical standard as Galileo.
---
&gt;i'd like to know what makes a game objectively good or bad
---
Good and bad are relative terms. Fallout 76 is objectively bad because relative to the quality that Bethesda have proven to be capable of in the past it falls short. A C grade is an objectively bad result for a straight A student.
---
&gt;You seem to think that there is some other means of determining the quality of a game outside of whether or not it is fun.
---
'Is this game as good as the games we know this studio is capable of creating?'
---
"I'd like to order 1 Orbital Strike Bacon cheeseburger, side of fries"
---
There are people who datamine what's coming to the atomic shop when we download updates/patches. Here are the ones I was talking about. [https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy](https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy)
---
if it only scales me back 50 levels im willing to try it,if its a full reset no matter the level then idk
---
It was in the Fallout 76 roadmap
---
No they weren't, he clearly states he had to build grits to bypass the slap damage nerf. Did you even read the link?
---
I kinda like the idea that you can have a scorched deathclaw pet or a tidy CAMP.  Not both.
---
Sorry you cant get rid of him though.
---
I said solo, not relying on others for kills. 
---
I've recently learned why you don't build anywhere within about a 1000 unit radius of a workshop build area. I built near the Summerville bridge by lakeside cabins and the cabin nearest to the bridge is a spawn point for workshop attacks. Except that they spawn and decide that nothing is worse than some standing corn and a porch railing and ignore the workshop and wail on my base. Unfortunately for both me and the workshop owner it seems that my camp is outside the radius for failing the workshop defend mission, so if they're a melee character they can't come and kill those guys to defend their workshop. The only wait to kill the guys who wandered way over to beat on my corn is to snipe them from the edge of the mission radius. If I had known this before I built a massive complicated building that took me 8 hours to build I wouldn't have built there but it's too late now.
---
i mean its 15 pounds lol
---
you have nothing to lose
---
Thank you! Those looks sweet, I’ll be getting war rider for sure. Do you know what that symbol on the chest of the pale rider is by any chance?
---
You can also chain 10 of the generators that produce 10 power  together and it will fire up the fusion core processor
---
You should offer to take the wanted into "custody " which is a police station jail cell you hold them in until they are no longer wanted . They get protection but have to serve their time . Justice 
---
I just wish I could delete/discard or hide unwanted perk cards because having to scroll through all the garbage and duplicate cards adds a bunch of time to a simple card swap.
---
That is solo
---
Shit I must have skipped over it. Genuinely excited now
---
I hear ya. I feel like ghouls have a swing range of like 5ft, they will always hit me. I either am the worst blocker on the planet, or timing blocks is impossible. It gets compounded when the ghouls decide to space ~~walk~~ sprint across the ground at erratic speeds
---
Awh man :/
---
Can i make a shot glass of gamer girl pee?
---
It was removed on purpose to prevent abuse.  People would move the CAMP object around and then place the MATS to get to inaccessible places.
---
So to prevent exploits done by players, they removed the tool used to do it.
---
Nice burn on Bethesda :'D shame tho
---
Only if they add new proper story quests in. It's getting a bit tiring doing the same dailies and events over and over again. 
---
Check the desks in the Military wing of the Enclave area under Whitespring. I always find 2-3 in them.
---
I've realized and accepted that we are all BETA players. Maybe it's not what we signed up for but we are the game testers in an extended BETA. 
---
Where is it cheap? I've been looking to buy the game for my friend.
---
I bought for 9,99 Euros on g2a
---
I think what you were looking for was “Thank you” because that is excellent leveling advice for a lone wanderer.  
---
That wouldn't stop some people from taking it.
---
In fallout 76. Always think, PA is a human shaped car. However with the right PA mods and play style it’s good and while it can’t stand up to 3* armour it does what it needs to do. 
---
Im only level 10. Just got the game. Was like level 6 or 7 and the scorched horde at the airport triggered. I got a little overwhelmed and then about wave 3, 4 PA lvl 130 players swooped on and mopped up. Then one of them gave me a legendary weapon. Honestly I didn’t expect the community to be so nice. So far I’ve not had any griefing
---
I’d love to sign up but IDK how I would find your server
---
It's really fiddly, and very inconsistent. When you place a wall on a foundation, you can sometimes approach from the other side of the wall and place a wall "backed up" against it. It's almost like placing another wall in the same place as the original wall,, just rotated 180 degrees. Make sure there's no furniture pressed up against the wall or else you'll see the "this item intersects another item" message. I think it has to do with the wall being on the outside of one foundation, and the other wall being on the outside of the neighbouring foundation, and that common wall gives the appearance of the two sided wall.
---
I've got brick walls around the outside of my house, but in the inside, I've got two 'interior' sides, so they're white from both sides. I even had a solid wall one one side and a doorway on the other side to make it look like the doorway had been bricked up. I have had it with the red barn-style walls as well, but I certainly haven't spent a long time testing and trying out different combinations. I'm just glad the interior walls can be white so my crafting room doesn't have a red brick side and a white side.
---
Good luck.
---
I have the names and locations (platforms) of a few douchebags I'd like you to arrest...
---
Why so much budget for the letters though? They shouldn't take up any more space than any other wall hanging should they? Not talking neon letters, I mean the ones that look like cheap mailbox stickers.
---
Luckily the 3 people I game with with most of my games enjoy it too. Plus that's why we all are here, mostly. To talk and discuss about a game we all play.
---
Lovely - a beginning.  
---
But what qualities make it bad or good?  You have given a judgement but haven't explained how your judgment system works.
---
I would say that fallout 76 has many qualities that make it superior to previous titles they have released - in regards to the quality which I am using to determine whether or not a game is good.  Which is fun.  However fun has no objective standard so it can't be the quality which you are using to determine the objective/relative good/bad state of the game.
---
Get as many Deathclaws as possible and RESURRECT THE FUCKING CHADCLAVE!!!
---
And when they got there...it was already too late - they were buried in their own junk avalanche
---
mostly I get 3 sometimes I get 2 and sometimes I get 0. :(
---
Lol Nice user name. I have no problems with manual aiming but I do agree automatic weapons should have reduced ap cost
---
Same here, never join my buddy's Discord anymore since all they do is get on the hate train about fo76 though they have never played it. A lot of criticism is well deserved, hell I've complained in the past, but at least I've played it. The amusing thing is they're around my age, 33, and playing Roblox. 
---
I get the same, I talk about Fallout 76 or seen playing it and people are like, "BaD gAmE, ImAgInE pLaYiNg A sHiT gAmE" dumb stuff like that
---
Currently working on this!
---
I never enter a queen fight with junk I can't afford to lose. Hit a stash box before you go in.
---
Maybe they are some form of fallout universe of nuclear plastic flowers?
---
Not sure! It was just sitting there
---
Especially when the whole Whitesprings area is nuked.
---
Yes, I read it... did you? He doesn't say anything about "bypassing" the "slap damage nerf" using built up crits... did you read the link? Quote the part you're talking about... there was no slap damage, all 4 of them were open for PVP.
---
Can you post a pic of some examples what this would look like?
---
Really? I've always got 3 and some chem plus the occasional bit of armour. All of a sudden it's become a coin toss. 
---
Grahm walked past my CAMP twice within a few real days of my playing, but I haven’t seen him again since mid-December.   I guess he didn’t like the looks of my camp.
---
Um havent you read the lore?
---
He says he needed crits to kill all 3 of them to the point of shooting toads.
---
Well, how'd you get this footage, if you were banned?
---
Have you got a link please? I'm fairly new at reddit and hopeless at finding things on it... 
---
I think I isn’t get tokens before because I’m not very good at the doss toss lol I missed almost all of the hoops 😂
---
Workshops and events
---
I'm curious about that as well.
---
Better call FBI, the fuck grown ass men doing on Roblox?
---
I want to say I saw it at the bottom train station by charlie
---
Watch the video ya silly bugger 😉 haha I did an inventory check on the 14th of feb one day before the dupe deletion patch (I feared I would lose items) so that footage now stands as proof that I did not have what Bethesda claims I had
---
It doesn't need an objective standard to determine a relative state. The story is, relatively, bad. The gameplay is, relatively, identical to older games. The grind is, relatively, bad. The perks are, relatively, bad. The survival mechanics are, relatively, bad. The loot is, relatively, bad.
---
Now take your pick about which part of these gives you your fun and then ask yourself why you would play Fallout 76 for that fun instead of &lt;insert game that did that concept well here&gt;.
---
Is it really one time loot now? No wonder things wouldn't appear for me. Ugh....
---
The only reason I ever took workshops was to build it up and "Rebuild America!" for the fun of building.
---
After I got one-shotted well away from the workshop and realized that owning a workshop makes you active in PvP I never take a workshop anymore. Ok... if it's a challenge I may take it and immediately log off.
---
If you use PA pretty heavily, you should consider investing some perk points into it.  Power User, fully ranked up, doubles the duration of your cores. And if you have a fully ranked up Full Charge perk, sprinting in PA doesn't drain additional power from your cores.
---
In this case that is a suggestion I flat out refuse to consider, since I will not go around as a low level, spraying a bullet into enemies *hoping someone will do the work for me*. 
---
I didn't. That's the point. He only got common easily found scrap. Why take the junk and taunt with with a wave.
---
Now if the bag was marked as owned and he got a bounty for taking it. I would have had an immediate opportunity to get even. Sure, I could lose and lose caps. That would have been by choice though.
---
Each patch broke my game save worse than the one prior to it, so I had to abandon it.
---
What makes you think that has anything to do with slap damage? He needed the crits because he's a sniper going 1v4. If you don't one shot them they'll just heal and kill you.
---
I hop between events. Most of the time I get 300 xp for completing, plus whatever I got for the kills. I also take as many workshops as I can, and as soon as they become contested, I server hop. Costs a lot of caps to do both of those, but it’s easy xp and doesn’t take a lot of time. Hope this helps!
---
That was a few days before the ban wave, how do we know you didn't get a bunch of items a few days later?
---
you haven't seen the golf club?
---
Dross toss usually gives me 0 whether I make all the shots or not. The others have always given me 3 upon completion.
---
We criticize the game because it's not near a finished game, and a large majority paid retail price for it.
---
Only for it to basically be given away free after only 4 months, we feel cheated.
---
So how many rounds are fired per full auto shot? If I remember right all previous FO games only fires 3-5 shots per VAT trigger pull.
---
Those multi shots balanced out a single higher round in a semi automatic weapon.
---
Ah, I don’t know how to help you there friend 
---
If I never had copious amounts of items why would I get some a few days after most of them just got removed from duper’s inventories, I see what you mean tho. 
---
The west side of the map has lower level enemies. The north west is the easiest part. Hit up Wavy Wlliards waterpark, clarksburg, Grafton, Camden park, and the ash heap region(lvl 20+) don't move to the east untill your a bit higher level. (40+)
---
I don't understand why Vault 76 has the entrance facing south it should face north as this is an easier area.
---
Pacing mostly. And little of everything. Chances are you’ll find something that is better or does you more by the time you can actually use an item. But it makes for a good back up. 
---
Hours played has no relationship to skill
---
I am over 200 and will not. This game is not worth grinding twice. 
---
Aim above the hoops 😉
---
Well...I was helping two of my friends do Mayor for a Day last night, the first time I’ve gone in that office for probably two months, and nothing. So one-time must be absolutely literal this time. 
---
I was just in a queen fight too and was look up at a scorched beast and fell right into a fissure site. I’ve never laughed so hard. I can’t be mad about that but I understand where you’re coming from. Had a lot of junk in my inventory before our stash got upgraded and was doing a silo run with a friend. I died and other people were there messing around and took all my stuff. Ahhh oh well  
---
It's probably Dross Toss, right?  Dross Toss is flaky.  Shots that should count, don't.  Shots that don't, do.  The amount of tokens you get from it is definitely tied to the targets you make.
---
Depends on how this works. Is it forced? Can we chose to do it? What happens to players like me who are level 180+? Do we get 3 prestige levels at once? What are the benefits?
---
The whole thing is "a bit" unclear as of right now.
---
So you died like a loser. Wipe away your tears and don't die next time. Dead men have no rights and that includes the crap you carry. 
---
There are three issues currently affecting Adrenal Reaction that we're looking to address:
---
* Adrenal Reaction's positive effects are not applied to the player if they had the mutation prior to Patch 6 release.
---
* Adrenal Reaction's damage bonus was unintentionally reduced following Patch 6 release.
---
* Reapplying Adrenal Reaction after Patch 6 release can cause some of its effects to fail to display in the Pip-Boy if the player logs out/back in.
---
We're currently working toward fixes for the first two and hope to have them addressed with Patch 7. The third requires some additional investigation, but we're looking into that as well.
---
He didnt say anything about there being turrets. 
---
If you are smashing CAMPs without turrets then you are the asshole. 
---
Can you provide a source? I've not seen any evidence that anybody from ZOS worked on Fallout 76, but I'm hardly omniscient - I've just not seen or read anywhere that that was the case.
---
It seems that unless it's DLC related it's not going to just be randomly added by a patch. I expect we will see some skins/paints with DLC but for stuff like this it's unlikely to be added any way other than via the store. The reason for the store isn'st just a cash grab, but also to encourage people to start new characters and try different builds. Each new character has it's own fresh challenge list to unlock atoms for free, and varied play styles will unlock different challenges that past builds may have side stepped.
---
I try but I’m no good lol that’s why I don’t touch grenades! 
---
I show my whole inventory and my stash, I collect weapons and nothing else, I’m a weapon hoarder (always have been in all fallouts and all elder scrolls games) see I use weapon weight reduction Armor and perk cards to carry around everything (single player games don’t have weight restriction) so I think me having such a large collection tripled there system to ban me
---
Don't let it bother you then. It's just junk besides some people are just jerks you've had a reddit account for 7 years I'm sure you know this by now
---
Funnily enough that's today's one. Char number 3 got his tokens ok.
---
Thats the exact same thing that happend to me. I preordered the game and was hyped af. As I was playing the game, one of my friends texted me and asked me how bad my experience is. I told him the game is actually pretty good and he should try it out too. He just gave me a nah and stopped texting me the following days. After two weeks (I was still really enjoying the game) he started sending me reviews and how badly Bethesda ruined the game. I've read them and even though he though he changed my opinion, I still told him the game was cool. Well, he was pretty annoyed by that and started every argument with things like "at least it's not as bad as FO76". I stopped playing the game two months ago, but I wanted to start again in a couple of days.
---
Cheers

This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
From what I understand, their detection is based off of what you acquire in a 30 day window at a time. If you found a bag of 100,000 of one item and picked it up and then immediately dropped it, their system will still show you acquired 100,000 of that item. Even if you only actually had the items for a few seconds.
---
TSE is still very good. I have a pump action, and unloading both barrels is almost always a stoppered enemy. Or against some, like a 60-ish scorched, just one barrel. 
---
Think I'll get drunk and play something else bethesda 
---
You have a funny definition of the word "proof."
---
THIS.
---
The viewfinders are up there with "useless ladders" in video games, for me. Why put them in at all?
---
You spawn fifteen feet to the right of your CAMP unit. Like clockwork.
---
Lol hey dude nice to see you on here! Yes I’ve seen it but nothing from a drop
---
R-C-MAN
---
Yeah I’m aware of that, I’ve heard cases of people just picking stuff up thinking they struck gold and bam they get banned, I haven’t picked up any of that stuff tho, have no use for it in my inventory takes up too much weight, I realise there may be holes in my story but I have all the proof I am able to provide to show I did not have anything that would make me deserve to get banned.
---
Caravan... was so breakable. It's how I made every cap I ever had in NV.
---
Wear dense armour, doesn't matter where they land then 🤣
---
Buying from vendors is never a great option unless you score a hot legendary or cool mod. Stashing gear used to be a real headache when stash limit was 400 but I squirrel stuff away at a pace that stays pretty even with my ability to sell it these days. The perk and leveling breaks might help identify preferences and give you a chance to distribute points and perks more effectively for your play style.
---
I kinda feel you. If you die to a player in pvp your junk is fair takings. But dying to a mob should have a timer to offer a chance. Then again nearly all scrap is replaceable. 
---
fuck BOS, fascist pigs!
---
I’m waiting until the new shit comes out, the game has like nothing to do 
---
Thanks for the tag, I'll see what I can find out!
---
I'm sorry, how did Borderlands 2 do it?  Borderlands 2 was basically replaying the whole game on True Vault Hunter Mode and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode difficulty with your level carrying over.  They set it up so you had diminishing returns if you remained in one difficulty beyond your level.
---
It really wasn't a good system, imo.  Most because if you spent too much time in TVHM, you screwed yourself in UVHM.  That, and Borderlands 2 is an extremely tedious game to replay.  One of those things I did, but in hindsight, I don't have a clue how I had the patience for it.
---
I just paid $60, 2 days ago, on the Bethesda launcher. I don’t regret a thing. It’s amazing
---
there's another Lord Nikon I'm sure...
---
in what way is this not proof? bethesda claims i had 100,000 pounds worth of items in my inventory, heres footage i recorded doing an inventory check and there is clearly nothing of that description, proof
---
I find that sometimes the game can’t handle when there’s a mess of enemies and other players. 
---
Like whitesprings golf club for instance, my two handed melee build works great for a few seconds, then stalls, then works then stalls. If it weren’t for auto stim and my dr I would die a LOT due to the shitty performance of some servers. 
---
Playing on Xbox (I am low level... only 13 right now) but I see a lot of low level characters, every session there's at least one or two poking their heads out of the vault for the first time.
---
They aren't learnable. But there are 3-4 recipes (I believe they were all on a computer iirc).
---
They tell you what materials to use for nuka colas of various flavors. In fact I think they even used current ingame materials. Atleast one or two of the recipes did. Some showed prewar materials.
---
"Thank you" = heart emote
---
"WTF" = confused emote
---
"Need (item)" = already have for food, water
---
Unless things have changed, it doesn't.  I have been putting items in as low levels take them out. I have had friends who just started grab items from overseer's camp.
---
Whitesprings nukes convert flora to produce crimson, cobalt, yellowcake, and florescent.
---
Sorry I thought you were him😲
---
I want legendary PA parts, nothing as crazy as the non PA legendary armor effect but like maybe something like faster base movement speed or solar plating to give your FC a change while outside during the day. Stuff like that some small QoL things.
---
If you are truly desperate, south of the Top of the World is a train crash (north of the train yard), if you are a high enough level, a Sentry bot will always spawn in the middle. Just server hop till you can get a few cores going to start a proper farming route. There is also a power armor in the Trainyard that is south of the crash.
---
How rigorous is the police academy training program?
---
I dont understand how people dont realize they are wanted. That little red  cap circle drives me nuts. It's all I can look at until I find someone to kill me. 
---
I had that happen once at the race track. I kept thinking to myself "where the hell are all the enemies" turns out they were going aggro on some poor bastards base. 
---
https://account.xbox.com/en-AU/Profile?xr=shellnav&amp;activetab=main:mainTab4 xbox profile shows the date the dvr captured this footage
---
Ehhh. I played for the first 3 weeks the game was out. I had fun but the bugs outweighed my enjoyment for it. And the limited storage. They increased it, sure, but not enough. I'm a diehard fallout fan but they didn't do enough for this game. At least not yet. It felt... Just plain wrong. Like they knew how bad it was but were forced to publish. 
---
* Adrenal Reaction's damage bonus is dealing less damage than intended following Patch 6 release.
---
To answer your question OP, reapplying Adrenal Reaction should work you just may not see all of its effects in the Pip-Boy right now after changing servers/relogging.
---
LOTRO had awesome player music.  You could save MIDI files in your music folder and have the game play those songs based on what you were playing.  You could also sync them to other players to make a better song.  It was not exactly MIDI, but I think it was called ABC files or something.  But I had over 100+ popular songs.  All players synced, would have to have the files, but it was cool.
---
I actually see quite a few low-levels.  Whether or not they are new players or existing players on new characters, I don't know.  But what I can tell you is that they are incredibly skittish and it makes crafting things to help them very hit-and-miss.
---
no worries mate, I mean I guess I could be, but your username doesn't look familiar...  actually now that I think about it it kinda does, where did we (possibly) meet?  in a different sub?  in a game?
---
I had my fun with it, walked away with no regrets.
---
It's very strange with the letters you ask about.
---
The neon ones give off light and light sources also put a strain on the rendering engine. Shouldn't have any effect on the server though. I think that CAMP budget have some strange quirks.
---
The division with D0jitsu
---
Exploding cars are tied to the shooter of the car.  I exploded a whole bunch of cars around whitespring, many chaining off the original.    Even the chained cars that hit a robot caused them to aggro on me specifically. So I had to sprint away from like 15 robots because of car-chains before.
---
The higher levelled you get, the more the stuff you are always short on changes. At lower levels screws and adhesive were my bane. At level 100, it was springs. Now it is ballistic fiber, acid, and steel. It does get better. You will master the tricks to build those items up.
---
It would have been nice to have these guys in the Beta, I was a pretty low level because I had to work, and so these guys that were higher kept PKing my cousin and I over and over again.
---
There’s a perk in perception that’s gives you an arc when throwing greneades, definitely helps with this quest. 
---
also, on the buyable planter in the atom store that looks like floating orbs coming out of a nuclear missle shell
---
I'm reinstalling the game again, but this time on my internal harddrive instead of external..  
---
ive had three tames. my first was a scorched megasloth - George disappeared in front of me as i followed a few and never showed up at camp. my deathclaw, Lilly, the second one showed up, attacked some team mates then disappeared never to return :( (was she ashamed! it didn't do any damage, they understood the play). the third was another megasloth, Lucy. She ran so fast there was no following. I waited and waited back at camp and finally decided to go on a junk run. I came back later and she was dead on my porch. I never saw her again.  
---
This is an incredibly cool feature and i NEVER used defenses (the budget is so steep and I can barely do a camp with the budget currently) but this is something i was willing to put budget into. (i REALLLLLLLLLLY wish budget was adjusted all around but that's another discussion)  
---
This feature is broken though and needs to be fixed. Please.
---
The quest for the Leather Right Leg is my favorite FO76 meme so far.
---
Simple he had a DeLorean and crafted a flux capacitor at his work bench that he used to travel back in time. 
---
I plan on running Nukashine all over the place, guess I'll have to watch out an not get caught with to much on me and intent to sell. Might need the lawyer after all to explain all that Nukashine in Bulk. :)

As usual, it looks like at least one cop secretly wants to be with us firefighters too. ;)
---
What system are you on, I’ll help you out with your extermination issue if PS4.
---
Where did you get that?
---
Well I’m glad you’ve got good memories of it friend 
---
The armor doesn't always spawn, but it's on a corpse in the big end area, where the scorchbeast spawns, just to the right of the exit tunnel, near the radio transmitter thing that you need for the BOS questline. Can't remember the name of the corpse though, so hope this helps a little
---
Hi I'm somewhere around 45 and can use the help haha
---
I have been spending my time dropping purified water and canned dog food in the starting areas and just general exploration and side quests.
---
Lol I hope they incorparate the Moonshiners cabin in the questline. Seems like a waste if they don't
---
I'll see what I can find out about reports of increased add spawns during this fight. Thanks!
---
Nope. Got bored almost as soon as I hit level 50 and found nothing fun to do. I might go back and check it out in a year or so. 
---
How much would it cost if it had celebrated shocks with it?
---
I get three-ish for the games... except the damn coal bucket thing. I can never find them all. 
---
This is exactly what I think every time I see someone bitching about things like this. 
---
It's the fucking apocalypse.
---
"Wah! I just got killed by someone saying they are  a raider! Not in MY Fallout!"
---
Are we seriously all supposed to sit around singing campfire songs and loving each other like a bunch of dirty hippies? 
---
Yes, I clearly find in-game frustration exhilarating!
---
It can be a reward for turning in technical data, I just got one today
---
You can check out my previous post on Reddit and you will see it there. It explains how to earn it.
---
Camo business suit and tie.  I still wear it once in awhile just to remind myself to pay attention to what the hell I'm doing.

Each their own.  I'm lvl 110 and this works for me.  In its current condition and what not, I have 331/233/34 (ballistic/energy/radiation) and a carry weight of 240 (12 in strength).

BOS Fatigues with Protective Lining (still haven't been awarded or found Shielded and turn in tech docs all the time)

Yeah I was lucky to have Amazon give me a full refund for it. If it drops below £20 and improves significantly I might get it again but not at this stage. Such a crushing disappointment.
---
Covfefe! 
---
I just checked my psn. The LordNikon I have on there is LordNikon70. 
---
It’s even the right colours!
---
So whats the actual item name? 
---
Is it clean ******
---
Or just fatigue?
---
I usually just see dirty fatigues
---
So you no longer believe that there is an objective scale of good or bad in games?  It's now relative and non-objective?
---
You might not need an objective standard to determine a relative state but you do need to compare it to something - you state things are relatively bad - but you don't compare them to anything - which isn't relative - it's arbitrary.
---
If you'd like to put forth an actual relative comparison, or an objective assessment I'd love to hear them, because I'd still like to understand.
---
Somewhere the ghost of Driver Nephi is nodding in approval. 
---
The thing that I've noticed is that, periodically, I'll just be unable to swing my weapons at all.  I have to swap from one weapon to another to fix it.  Otherwise, I'll keep mashing LMB and nothing happens.
---
Because it always seems to happen at the most inopportune times, I'm convinced it has something to do with being staggered.  Usually, some melee enemy hits me, I react, and I lose melee controls.
---
That'll be Awesome; Thank you for your quick reply.
---
 I look forward to the future content bcuz I think the game is going  to be epic like ESO. Plz more holotapes as well 
---
Yup, me neither at over 300 hours 🤷‍♀️ 
---
I was confused as hell when my friend mentioned them the other day
---
word, and I'm on PC, well nice meeting you anyway!
---
How often do workshop Defend events trigger and what is the exp you get for those?
---
I have one. It was a reward from a brotherhood quest I did. 
---
Have seen reports of this as well, thanks. Looking into this!
---
Once you earn it. It will be named, "Army Fatigue."
---
All of those comparisons are to Fallout 4.
---
I see your point but I would be very careful bringing the matter up publicly.
---
The 'video evidence' is not watertight and there is a lot of 'face' at stake with the 4:8:2000 conundrum.
---
It is entirely possible for Beth to turn around and say something along the lines of 'upon further inspection of your account the violation(s) have been found warranting a permanent suspension. Please take the time to read the ToS and have a nice day.'
---
In fact if you consider the broader implications this is a far more likely outcome than an apology and a lifting of your suspension.
---
IMHO the 'temporary suspension' thing is not binding in any way, they can still do as they see fit and realistically there is little anyone else can do about it.
---
There is this old adage 'possession is 90% of the law' and in this case Beth has the only key that can lock and unlock accounts.
---
Thanks
---
Lvl 67 never seen one of those.
---
Yeah, I have a full suit of heavy combat armor, with the legs and chest having BOS (I never got the arm plan from grafton before they changed the vendors sadly), and my resistances are still in the 250+ range. I don't remember them exactly, but it's like 260 something for energy, and 300 some with the 200% CND, which causes an increase in ballistic resist.
---
Nice job! Do you like it?
---
Lol. Nice one 
---
Hey don’t worry. I’m lvl 120 and this is my second one this week 
---
Fuck! I was going to do the Suicide Squad for survival mode!
---
Was this on Playstation?
---
And did you get their names?
---
I want to join up. I was going to be Deadshot though. Guess I could be Captain Cold or Bronze Tiger. Maybe someone lame like Capt Boomerange. I wonder if a throwing weapon build is legit?
---
Played FO76 quite a lot but missed out one can use the same map several times and therefore dropped more than a few duplicates. Reddits FO76 is THE best.
---
It also means those games they were meant to beat can release later and then just walk over the competition, especially attracting jaded gamers from said rushed games.
---
No offense, but you’re friend sounds like an asshole
---
For Dross Toss I've discovered if you hop the counter to throw them in it rewards zero tokens. If you stay behind the counter you get tokens. Once I started staying behind the counter it rewards them every time now. 
---
Thank ya! Almost killed me a few times so decided to go heal up and get a quick pic! 
---
Thank you, appreciate the advice and knowledge bomb. I’m just a guy who enjoys Bethesda games and fallout, and im just trying to make all the noise I can for myself and any others that have been suspended or banned 
---
Missle is the best.  It requires Home defense 
---
Dont turn on pacifist. What is the benefit?
---
I'm not even sure how to do it 
---
One key thing you might be missing, they werent looking for stacks of 100k +. BGS now had the ability to track when, how much and possibly where you get an item.
---
What they were tracking is if you aquired an abnormal/large amount of a rare item in a set period, than the game would normally allow, or that you would find in a normal play window.
---
Ie. If you found/aquired 96 bobbleheads in a 4 hour play window, thats gonna raise a red flag. But if you found those same 96 bobbleheads over a 1 month period and you played everyday it probably wont raise a red flag unless they are all the same type, ie all explosive.
---
Not saying you cheated, some people who went duper hunting, or were the crafter for groups were affected. Either way you got some time to think about how your actions got you to this point.
---
I’m on pc as well same username without the 2
---
The light through the roof is a very nice touch!
---
Is he playing "In Your Eyes" on a boom box?
---
I’m glad it’s cheap from a consumer standpoint but as a lover of fallout as a whole it’s not good to have a product devalued multiple times in such a short period. I can only hope they use this as inspiration to make a better quality product in the future in terms of bugs and issues. 
---
Hopefully in the future we get to customize our PA as we see fit bcuz it'll be lore friendly too in establishing clans 
---
Add to that legendary weapons but not optimal 3\* and I have been in several failures lately.
---
Never said I was killed by someone claiming to be a raider. I go on here and see people saying they love destroying peoples stuff while roleplaying ad a raider. 
---
Awesome base, i'd love to join your server!! Can i add you on psn ? Im a Outfit trader and i like to build bases too
---
How as a high level do you get higher level npcs to spawn?  I am level 87 and I find new exploration can be a bit boring in certain areas because it’s all level 10-20 and I missed those areas when I was low level.  
---
Thank you! I’ll go ahead and wait for the fix then. 
---
"You have to run all the way up the stairs and then finally hit it directly. but rifleman? Nope. Just stand across the bridge and snipe it from a mile away with vats perk cards kay thanks bye. way too easy and honestly bruins the challenge of the game."
---
Uhh… you just pointed out the reason firearms were invented. So you can kill shit from far away, and not have to run up to it and punch it. Not everything is "equal" in it's utility. It's a game, man. Chill out. Play it how you want, let others play it how they want.
---
But I 100% guarantee you... it's supposed to be easier to shoot a Super Mutant in the head from a distance, than it is to run up and kick him to death.
---
Red dead 2 is so overrated. The campaign is great but the online has zero content and is extremely buggy
---
Well damn girl. That is aggravating. They need to level scale or something, like they do in every other mmo. Or put a minimum level threshold, or a level cap per area for workshops. There's something they could do to make it not so one sided.
---
Yeah all of this reinforced my original thought that you need to work on your reading comprehension. He isn’t trying to bypass slap damage by building crits. 
---
And when he said the other 3 weren’t tagged for PVP... that was when his story just started. Shortly after, they all started shooting at him, which puts them in PVP. 
---
Slow down in your reading! Don’t overassume and gloss over what’s actually written!
---
Exactly! Thank you! 
---
Lol RoboCop
---
RadX diluted = 100 rad resist and no mutation suppression
---
RadX = 200 rad resist and suppresses mutations
---
RadShield = 300 rad resist and no mutation suppression
---
IIRC you can stack RadX diluted and Radshield
---
I know mate I understand all
---
The logistics and inner workings of what is going on, I’ve researched it heavily to try and get my acc back haha, I don’t have stacks of rare items like bobble heads nuka colas or junk or ammo and certainly not weapons and Armor if you see my inventory in the video I keep it to the bare minimum so I can carry all my guns around. I don’t even remember picking up 100,000 of anything rare ever, if I did then I’d know hey I did that to cause my ban, but no such thing has happened
---
My thoughts exactly.

Where did you read the part with rerolling? Was it on the roadmap or inside the vault? I’d prefer the vendor would just sell legendary mods... would be the easiest solution... the “get the gun of your dreams” bullshit doesn’t work if i have to reroll my gear 1000000 times because there are god knows how many possible combinations....
---
I mean, it is, but it seems odd that the player can't relinquish control of the Workshop by getting killed.  If the aggressor doesn't claim it, they can keep doing this rope-a-dope thing literally until the owner quits, because the owner has no other way to relenquish control (short of waiting for the Defend quest and failing it... but even that isn't in their control if someone else completes it *for* them).
---
I wish 😒 he wasn’t very kind
---
I figured they were intended to be very mobile and moved routinely based just off the name and the acronym. I don't personally think either way is wrong or right.
---
I do it on all my three characters and then my friend helps me transfer the tokens to main when I’ve got enough. Usually only one character has this issue/bug but most days I get 3 tokens per character.
---
Exactly and what was delivered was far from that. I played it Bugs and all for about a week then the game kept crashing every few minutes. Or the bugs would get so bad I couldn’t progress. 80 bucks!?!? Are you joking? The less then a week later it’s down to 40 buck?? I just want my money back. 
---
I play Battletech.
---
No problem. You are welcome. :)
---
They all had the number 387 in their name, other than that not really.
---
Meh. There's various grenades, throwing knives and tomahawks. Idk if you can craft tomahawks or not though. The only perk for throwing is you get an arc you can see and they go a little farther. Explosives get buff perks though.
---
You could wield spears and throw tomahawks?
---
Just log out when someone is in your camp that is up to no good. 
---
I thought this was generally understood but CAMP defense has to be higher than resources otherwise NPC attacks will happen with frequency.
---
Mobs generally have the same sound sensitivities that the player has, as well as sight. 
---
 There are a few other challenges associated by location and mob spawn points However it is not random. 
---
Get a fusion generator and get it off the ground, no foundation stacking, second level by way of stairs, defend stairs not generator. 
---
Critter spawn points (like my herd of radstags mmmmm) can also spawn mobs instead and it's based on the zone which mobs are in the pool, scorchbats seem to be an exception they are just really rare and definitely add immersion and flavour. 
---
I have a strong ethic against buying a game when it's cheaper and "finally has a fair amount of content". It angered me when I had to spend a year of waiting and $140 for something like Destinys Taken King expansion because I was a day 1 buyer. I despise that I spent $60 dollars for Fallout 76 to watch people wait a week and pay 40 dollars. Two weeks and people payed 30. Its insulting to me as a consumer, and as a genuine gamer, to be promised/lied to about the potential of a game at release to realize if I just waited a few months instead I could've saved a lot of money, hope, and time.
---
OK. Is that something that is out of character for a raider to do?
---
I was thinking 200 is a good #...
---
What the fuck 
---
Crap that’s not bad.
---
Each shot takes AP.
---
I'd love crossplay for 76
---
Unless you are actually farming the workshops for their resources, it's more efficient to just claim and do the first defend event...then leave server. 
---
stay off me lawn 
---
Dont worry, I'm not that easily offended. He kinda is, but I'm trying to avoid such subjects. Otherwise he is cool to be around
---
They’re there they just need a function.
---
That's what I ended up having to do. I was trying to keep my workshop grinding going though, I had just set up the 4th one and was hitting my base to tap my water purifiers and resource collector. I've moved my base now though, that place was too much trouble. I have an old double-resource spot that I never have that many issues with.
---
I was able to fling myself on there once.
---
The only penalty for dying in the game is losing your junk, and you want to reduce even that?
---
How about PvP, should your bag be protected when you die there to?  What if your opponent knocks you down to 1% health, can you kill yourself with explosives or run into a mob so they don't get the killing blow?
---
The risk of item loss is the only thing that makes dying have any meaning at all.  If anything penalties should be increased, bag makers removed, etc.
---
Wow really?  I see Fallout 76 to be clearly superior to fallout 4 in many ways!  
---
Subjectively I find the story to be more compelling and better told - putting together a mystery is fun for me.  
---
The lack of a voiced protagonist is also a great turn as I found it an annoying conceit that damaged replay value and role-play potential.
---
I found the characters in 4 to be rather boringly written and I actually think the voice acting for some of the dead characters was far superior in fallout 76.  Also the robot npc's and Graham are all excellently written as well.  Especially fluffy - who I still find myself quoting.
---
They got rid of HP being given out when you level which was something I always hated in bethesda games because it created an end game drag where everything was a bullet sponge.
---
The gun modding system now actually matters.  I love the camp system and the ability to unlock things to build as a reward.
---
I love the increased variety of monsters in the world.  And the world in general has a much greater variety of environments to explore.  
---
I thought you were going to compare it to three or to Morrowind or something.
---
Also the perk system is way better in 76 than in four - in four you could end up getting every perk with enough time and none of your decisions really mattered when it came to character build.
---
Do you have any specific examples about what you prefer about four or reasons why it's superior in your opinion?
---
All I was talking about was my experience and someone said that they think there should be level scaling and I agree with that. That’s all. The whole roleplaying as a raider is whatever. I think it’s stupid to be a level 80 messing with a level 20. No matter if they took a workshop or not. But all my experiences have never been with people claiming to be raiders. Like i said, I see people on here saying the like to act like raiders. Yeah raiders are supposed to do that stuff but I think a raider AI is a little different from a raider that’s a real person on the other side. Just my opinion 
---
When I get 3-4 the events hit so quick it's usually just a constant cycle. That and retaking them gives plans too. I try not to server hop.
---
It's true. The game is really fun playing with other people and sometimes just playing alone. These YouTubers and websites are too harsh on Fallout 76 for no reason without seeing how much the Developers of Fallout 76 is working very hard to make the game a good experience.
---
I was just mostly kidding anyway. 
---
I do want to make a Suicide Squad but I dont really want to just go fucking with people just because I can. Seems pointless. And not really the Suicide Squad's gig. 
---
Guess I'll start my own crew. 
---
They were probably being the dumb movie version anyway. 
---
I do wonder about an all throwing character though. May have to mess with that later. 
---
It's fine, just trying to provide a broader perspective.
---
No one is going to corner Beth on this one, they are always going to have the high ground.
---
If you have evidence that thinks can help your case bring it up with support. Be civil, be polite but be firm.
---
Besides I would not recommend lumbering yourself with 'everyone else', you don't know how was guilty of what and to what degree and those who have nothing left to lose will throw you under the bus without a second thought. 
---
Plus one is always Charleston Landfill. Junk nodes ftw.
---
Dark souls lvl of bulshitery lol, great job! We need more of these
---
The emote that I wish I had most was an equivalent of "LOL."
---
A second might be a "Wait"/"Stay Back."
---
Think that'll be hot!
---
 Helps set groups apart since farmers would've needed to band together and without tractors a must. I would think that's how Shady Sands was formed

New Features: Legendary Vendor and Scrapping – Locate the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary items for new legendary gear. *For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams.*
---
They literally say it in the description. It's a chance to get the Legendary of your dreams so still pretty much RNG 
---
It’s a shitty game, but it’s fun. If you look at it form a critic point of view, it’s shitty. Player point of view, it can be fun.
---
HahHa love it 😂
---
*I have encountered this on a few occasions, and if it occurs at 1 event or location, it's likely to occur at all.*
---
I have also experienced the Polar Opposite; in One session (server) (No nuke zones) 3 times normal amount of robots at Watoga &amp; over 25 legendaries, Continuous re-spawning of ghouls at WS golf club (collected 47 legendary items in about 30 minutes), 4 legendary SMs at West Tek, 6 Legendary SMs in Harpers Ferry, 4 Supervisors in UF (this has occurred several times in UF), etc..
---
These patterns seem to be server related, and each time it's happened, at both ends of the spectrum, I have noticed that there was a smaller than normal number of players on the server.
---
I routinely hit 9 different Locations/Events while hunting legendary enemies, so when I encounter 2 locations with less than normal spawns, I will server hop, and when I find one that's over performing I will farm my entire circuit, quit and then rejoin the same server, as the pattern tends to repeat.
---
The throwing knives do 75 flat and bonus from sneak attacks so they are super viable till like kid game. Late game idk.
---
Yup! I genuinely enjoy Fallout 76. I encounter fewer and fewer game breaking bugs, to the point that it’s just fun.
---
Where the fuck did you get it
---
If you are on PS4, I will take your bounty anytime you want lol
---
I think your luck's out of date, I haven't had these problems 
---
But letting food spoil gets you fertilizer
---
um, i guess i have to be the one to say it to you, but the card packs you get give you random cards, so we dont have an option to "choose wisely"
---
I actually respect Bethesda for actively trying to improve the game 
---
If you have a bounty just go sit in the bottom of a deep body of water with aquaboy/aquagirl equipped :-)
---
Alternately, what if there was a "gift" drop button that changed the color of the bag? Make it more visible? 
---
It's very common item, got at least 10 of these, all went to vendor or even to paper bags, since it's in-game value is like 15 caps?
---
Not a bad idea. Maybe have a timer (45-60 minutes) before you can pay it off. Allows other players the chance to hunt you down first and collect the bounty before wiping your slate clean. 
---
How is it different? They are both playing a character. Is it because the living player has an actual moral choice? I dont really buy it. 
---
And for the record, I totally agree that people messing with lower levels just to be a prick. 
---
Over grown look especially👍 bcuz all suits couldn't have ALL maintained their luster
---
Always stay Well-Rested, and if twinking is allowed the make sure you are always eating Cranberry Relish.

Run a Strength based build with 3\* in Iron Fist, Blocker, Martial Artist, and Incisor.

2-20: Events and tagging mobs at White Springs nukes as @rcman2 noted.
---
20+ Farm the Ghouls at White Spring (unNuked) solo.  Server hop to force reSpawns.
---
That’s just the thing tho , I held off on posting this video for a week, I sent ticket after ticket after ticket called them (very politely) and emailed them, and got nothing, I asked specifically to show what I was banned for (like how the 900 hours guy had a ticket saying he had a lot of ammo) and they couldn’t give me one with specifics! 
---
I spent $75 on FO76 for the beta because it had the fallout name attached to it.  Then I learned that the beta playtesting was only during a few small, specific time windows - none of which worked for me.  NO PROBLEMS!  I still love Fallout, and can wait for it to be ready to launch.
---
Then it launched.  I took the day off work to play.  I went back to work that morning because of all the bugs.
---
If it had been a $30 title like it is now?  No worries at all, zero.  But it wasn't, so I didn't get close to my moneys worth.
---
I may eventually, but the stink is still on the fish.
---
I have a problem with that, had it since the beginning of the game, only like 1 patch in, when I found all locations, but I have all 17 of those tapes, and the quest never completed for me. I even listen to them all again and the quest keeps telling me to find the tapes.... anyone know what I can do?
---
I gave the game a chance, it sucks DICK... Why do you think its "PRETTY CHEAP NOW" ? Because IT SUCKS DICK!
---
It's hard to say. Damage mechanics are a black box. Double damage @ 10% health? Maybe more. Maybe less. 
---
Everybody has a different number. All based on experimentation. Bloodied kicks butt, that's what I can tell you.
---
It is not a common item. I am not sure how do you get so many but perhaps your lying and making this up just to troll people. But the outfit is at least top 3 of rare outfits in the game. It would cost 500 Caps to 1K to at least trade one.
---
I actually found a blunderbuss on day 1 of the "beta." It was kind of crap. 
---
I would.
---
It's been mentioned several times before, unfortunately.
---
Can Find a fiew in Helvetia near Sutton and also a civil war outfit 
---
This. You have to use five times as much a p
---
The mod works fine. It has been updated twice since the patch. However unlike before where you could save in-game profiles, you have to use the nukes and dragon profile to make the builds. You still get 8 slots. You can change/update the profiles live while running the game.
---
Gah! I knew I was on the wrong system!
---
I think its one thing to be lvl 101 and take a workshop from a lvl 60+ that has pretty much done all in the game and could be somewhat equal to attempt a fight. But when your lvl 20 and lower, pretty much just starting out or this is an ALT-Character your working on... come on, just find another help them out or find another workshop. I much rather run up an help defends someones Workshop them try and take it myself. I still get plans out of it at least.
---
Are you just trying to get views on your YouTube channel, cause it seems like you're trying to get views on your YouTube channel.
---
In every video game, there is a loud, angry, vocal minority that is there at launch, that think they are clever simply because they are unhappy, that write a bunch of stuff Kotaku copy pastes and calls journalism, and these guys are gone in 6 months. 
---
Fallout 76, No Man's Sky, Battlefront 2, Red Dead Online.... My favorite video games are the ones that the internet says are terrible. It is my HOPE that people are learning to just watch a buddies' stream and make up their own Damn mind. 
---
Negativity breeds but positivity doesn't get clicks. There is mountains of non partisan science behind this that anyone can find 
---
Ppl actually asked for alot of the kiddy stuff..on this very sub. Bethesda seems to want to plz everyone 
---
And I offer the same services for PC
---
Yeah nice. Exactly what I feared. What a bullshit.... sorry but re-rolling a gun when there are thousands of possible combinations is just pointless.... and I bet we have to give the vendor a shitload of items for one re-roll.
---
I wish you good luck against the griefers that will be zeroing in on you sweet camp.  
---
I'd love an emote to communicate "here's some stuff, enjoy, no strings attached!"
---
Pretty sure there going to add some bar themed plans when they add this.  Could be wrong but who knows.
---
I've found ONE
---
Too afraid to scrap it for mods since I'll probably never see one ever again
---
I prefer the heavy Laser Turrets as they seem to engage enemies more readily.
---
I have only ranked up and used the plain "Science" card, not sure if the others would work or not, but you also need "Home Defense" ranked up.
---
When we had the Mothman event last week, I came to realize there was a potential Mothman spawn just to the east of my CAMP.
---
For just a moment, it made me realize the walls were awfully thin between me and the outside world.
---
What are you doing in this sub
---
that's good but it's not the best option forbuilding on ground level though. 
---
A week may seem a long time but there have been... issues, I cannot go into specifics, that took in excess of 6 weeks and a lot of diplomacy - from both parts I must say, you cannot do diplomacy if one side is unwilling - to resolve.
---
I empathise with your frustration but is not much anyone can do about it and in this particular instance bringing the matter up publicly without an ironclad case may actually be counterproductive.
---
Classic!
---
I am having similar issues only with one character  though I can play my other 3 just fine
---
I think that may be solved with the upcoming player vending.  I am sure you will be able to set price at 0 caps. Other players can the take... just my impression.  Cheers
---
I have a tip for you!!!!
---
i also had an issue with spawning in in  bad spot at my camp, but yesterday i read that if you move your actual CAMP machine (but leave your camp where it is) you can make the game re-calculate where you will spawn in at at your CAMP.
---
you can replace it anywhere within the green border circle you see when in build mode, I'd recommend moving it as far from where it is now and see if it makes the game place you in a better spot next time you fast travel!
---
it helped me alot!  (i had to build a long staircase up to my camp as initally the game placed me near the bottom of a cliff i was near, once i moved my CAMP machine, i spawned in right near my front door! much better!)
---
"wack"
---
Man I really should stop sharing content to reddit, its always negative comments, accusations and abuse 😂
---
What else am I supposed to show video evidence of my inventory on, YouTube has the most chance of getting shit noticed haha
---
The real disappointment with the golf clubs is that there's a mod called "gold club mace" that is separate from "golf club heavy", but when applied they both look like this. 
---
This is fantastic!
---
Definitely saving this for use in literally any thread that Bethesda posts to Twitter, and the legions of the "I've never played the game, but YouTube tells me I'm supposed to hate it" trolls which descend upon it. 
---
ah yes this guy gets it, i also posted this advice, good call!!!
---
Well, vending machines are supposed to be part of the Player Vending update, which is scheduled for April 9th.  I would like to assume that the ability to set the price to Free would be an option, and it would also mean that the items won't reset.
---
your friends still play? lucky
---
It's common as a BoS technical data radiant quest reward, I do this quest at least 5-7 times/a day so I got this outfit many times. Same as Bomber jacket, but I think Bomber is more rare (got it less times than Army fatigues).
---
The instance I am reporting also happened on a densely populated server where almost all of the players were huddled up in WS. Maybe 12-15 at once. Not to say that it matters, but populations have been on a really odd distribution model lately. Lots of empty servers without new joins.
---
WEIRD.
---
Oof the entitlement. The game’s not nearly as bad as it was at launch now, and it’s genuinely fun.  And you’re literally just a troll who does nothing but spam f76 posts where people seem to enjoy the game and you seem to feel the need to shit all over that for- what, some sense of individual superiority? You also do this on Anthem forums. Is that what you derive enjoyment from, going to forums of games you don’t play to shit on the people that stuck through the bugs because they saw potential behind a messy (and kinda catastrophic) launch? Grow up.
---
Yep, even NoMansSky has this figured out. 
---
We’ll just have to continue planting in fire pits lol. 
---
People listen to youtube to get their opinion and act like it's a fact. It's sad.
---
Thanks, still working on Part 3.
---
Actually from what I saw they were giving Bethesda more credit than the fallout sub does. Of course it was cause they wanted to compare another game that had a  bad rep and how at least that game had a companyt hat listened, had PR reps that went to the subreddit and interacted, was improving the game, and wasn't trying to encourage griefers due to MTs. Something R* relies heavily on (griefing) and I'm glad people are *finally* calling them out on it... took R* a while of being greedy to get some of their fans to actually start calling them on it. R* I swear has the most defensive fans who refuse to listen to any criticism, I've seen them call for a critic to be fired because she dared say one criticism of GTA V while calling the game great overall.
---
But from what I saw there was a lot more positive about Bethesda than I'd seen in a while. And people acknowledging that Bethesda was trying to fix the mistakes. And as some one who likes R* games but is frustrated at how R* treats online and microtransactions it was really refreshing to see them so down on R* for how they treat online.
---
Yeah that’s all I’m saying. That’s all of the experiences I have had. But keep in mind none said the were raiders. Idk I just like helping other people out and it’s sad to hear someone’s hard work gets destroyed. If you play as a raider, what do you do? Do you mess with people your level or what? I hear people talking about destroying things but that’s it. 
---
Makes sense, trying to keep the spirit of the original idea alive.
---
I like to think of that in real life terms. As it makes me smile...
---
Hello officer, I just robbed a bank 20 mins ago, and I'd like to turn myself in. "Sorry sir, your minimum 1 hour of police chase has not been met, come back in 40 mins." 
---
Yeah I went to buy NMS at Gamestop. It hasn't come out on Xbox yet, but i didn't know that. The clerk was like. Its not out on your platform but I have it on PC and I wouldn't let you buy it because I like you. All this did was make me excited for the Xbox launch. It is far and away the best game I have that I don't have time for. NMS is the best game nobody plays and its a damn shame because it deserves more community than it has. 
---
Damn 6 weeks for a response! Possibly counterproductive but I’m beyond frustrated hahaah I get banned just as they announce new dlc for the game and as I’m two achievements away from 100% 😔
---
I have to disagree with some of your comment. 
---
The campaign is phenomenal. It's without a doubt the best singleplayer experience I've had since Titanfall 2, and falls behind only Dragon Age: Origins and its DLC to be my second favorite single player game ever.
---
Red Dead Online has an absolutely MASSIVE amount of content (I think more content than FO76 even) and seems to be a pretty unique experience in my opinion, as far as overall online experiences go. I do absolutely despise the fact though, they call online a beta and have microtransactions implemented, as well as shitty camp system.
---
I agree with you on bugs, but I dont know if I would consider it to be "extremely buggy". There are plenty of issues that border on game breaking, but they seem to be rare, and besides that there's just cosmetic stuff it seems (clothes can be weird colors, sometimes your arms disappear).
---
Lastly....to call Red Dead Redemption 2 overrated is unjust. The game was in development for years, and the game mechanics are so in-depth its mindblowing. The story is fantastic, online is meh in my opinion, the voice acting is phenomenal, graphics in general are breathtaking, and the hype/positive talk on the game is very much well deserved, and the studio behind the game has earned 100% of their praise. Also, it made more in sales than this year's biggest box office haul (I think Avengers Infinity War?).
---
&gt;But let's be honest. Bethesda games have always been buggy. It's just so much noticeble and worse when it's online
---
That's kinda why there was so much of a hate train. People are tired of Bethesda's bullshit, and for once, even the fanbase and the first-day purchasers were pissed off (while with every previous game almost every criticism was swept under the rug). So the years of frustration came out. And of course some trolls took the opportunity to pile on that.
---
But let's not pretend that all criticism came from haters. Loads of people started hating on the game out of frustration, and that's really sad for the game. 
---
I think it would with all the bodies laying around.
---
 Ppl would decorate their personal suits just to frighten the others and establish superiority to the sheep who look to follow someone strong 
---
The range is REALLY SHORT. like.....8
---
Hope so! Have good expectations fork them adding Camp related plans/atom shop decor in this update. But just in case they haven't and are still working on it, maybe they'll listen and add this in time.
---
You have also not filtered in where the attacker is using any CHEMS, Bobbleheads, or Magazines that might boost the Attack and Damage being dealt here.
---
Eww shill
---
yes
---
*and those crouching players wee behind you the whole time!!!
---
dumn *duhn DUHN*!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
While the event was going on, nobody complained about it. Players didn't care. Then a couple of weeks after it ended, someone who doesn't play the game apparently heard about it somewhere and made a YouTube video about it and suddenly Twitter threads by Bethesda were full of complaints. 
---
What this suggests to me is that the people who were in a position to be effected - people playing the game - didn't care, whereas people who are in no position to be impacted at all were outraged only because someone told them to be and they wanted to be part of that group. 
---
In light of which, it's hard for me to take these complaints in good faith. If they were, there would have been these complaints by players during the event, which there weren't. This is manufactured outrage by people who just WANT to be angry.
---
Yeah, I have a feeling R* is finding out that they can't get away with the same shit they do with GTA online where they can entice you with really cool/fun crazy machines to get you to deal with the grind/griefers. And they're ruining what RDR online is good for imho (they keep gimping hunting as if hunting and fishing was enough not to make it a grind to make money... it doesn't help that they don't have much to entice you with and can't get away with quite as much that they do in GTA online).
---
Also some emails said 100,000 pounds of weight while others said 100,000 rare items so inconsistencies in tier emails
---
in mother russia house plop down on you!
---
There are no mods anyway.
---
Love this idea! Thanks for sharing :)
---
The game will never be amazing, I dont expect it to magically turn around and meet people's original expectations, but you can EASILY have solid fun with it for what it is.
---
You just leave the buildable area on respawn and don't seek revenge. Usually when you respawn you already do it outside the buildable area and you respawn as non-hostile. I'm not sure on the mechanics, but in order to get farmed you kinda have to deliberately offer yourself up after the first death. One death isn't "getting farmed." The only other way to farm players is the aggressor leaves the buildable area, they let ownership remain with the owner as the counter returns, re-cap the shop, and kill you again. Even with that tactic, there needs to be team coordination or the aggressor has to constantly run to the owner's location and within the buildable zone. Retreat is in the original owner's favor. Contesting to capture is in the aggressor's favor. 
---
Depending on how built up the workshop is, re-capping and killing the owner might not be profitable (ex: it takes 100 caps to claim but the owner is level 95). Even things like taking dropped loot are mainly a tactic to encourage players to seek revenge, re-enter the buildable zone, and get cap farmed.
---
But there should be some sort of mechanic to relinquish ownership.
---
But this would ruin the fun of people running at me in their undies begging to die. 
---
JK, it's not a bad idea as long as there's a time requirement first.
---
Agreed. Its refreshing to see people who dont blindly follow the circlejerk around "fo76 is trash".
---
I have rank 3 home defense and one of the higher tier science from a perk pack. 
---
That's the black powder pistol/rifle. The blunderbuss is different... but not by much.
---
I'll try my best!
---
Damn, beat me to it.
---
The easier way to earn the uniform is technical data quest in the first place but it isn't that easy to earn it right away. It would take hours or even a day or two.
---
I have a video of one scaring me during the mothman week! I was just minding my business at my camp then all of a sudden the loud noises he makes happened. I’ve never been so scared lol. 
---
No man's sky did it, destiny 2 did it, I think sea of thieves did it
---
Not a shill...just stated my overall opinion. I dont like seeing people shit all over games, if they have no experience with it.
---
My guild does "Wild Wasteland" days.
---
Generally this means we dress up in some kind of costume and hide until a player is coming by then act out a scene.
---
One example: We had three of our four man team dress as cops and the fourth dress in the varsity outfit. We had the guy in the varsity outfit do the camera pose that makes them look like they are afraid, stood in a circle around them, and started hitting them with batons while shouting in area chat "Stop resisting!"
---
Another time we dressed up in military fatigues, equipped commie whackers, and would run up to other players (we made sure we had pacifist turned on) and start shouting that they were commies, and basically anything Liberty Prime would say while hitting them with commie whackers.
---
Other times we have all gone chameleon and lurked in places players frequent and used soundboards to play unsettling sound clips that sound "creepy".
---
We make our own fun.
---
I paid full price for the game, have played since launch, and--even before all the patches--never experienced any bugs that I personally considered "game breaking".  I've been told this means that I have low standards, am easily amused like a child, or that I'm an idiot (haha), but I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game.  Have loved it since the day I stepped out of the vault.
---
Do you have Twitter? There’s a page that updates it everyday! 
---
“Almost” bug free? Yea, no. Not even close. Although, it’s certainly better than launch.
---
&gt; Subjectively I find the story to be more compelling and better told - putting together a mystery is fun for me.
---
This is a game not a book.
---
&gt;The lack of a voiced protagonist is also a great turn as I found it an annoying conceit that damaged replay value and role-play potential.
---
What is the replay value of Fallout 76? There is only one path through the world. One story. One outcome.
---
&gt;I found the characters in 4 to be rather boringly written and I actually think the voice acting for some of the dead characters was far superior in fallout 76. Also the robot npc's and Graham are all excellently written as well. Especially fluffy - who I still find myself quoting.
---
Robots and dead people. What excellent characters. Certainly perfect for creating narrative hooks and incentives for the story.
---
&gt;The gun modding system now actually matters.
---
No more than it ever did. What does matter is that too bad when you find that rare energy weapon, it's going to be worse than your pipe pistol until you find and scrap 100 more of them.
---
&gt; I love the camp system and the ability to unlock things to build as a reward.
---
Fallout 4.
---
&gt;I love the increased variety of monsters in the world. And the world in general has a much greater variety of environments to explore. 
---
All those environments which are identical once you peel away the veneer.
---
&gt;Also the perk system is way better in 76 than in four - in four you could end up getting every perk with enough time and none of your decisions really mattered when it came to character build.
---
You get every perk in Fallout 76. And none of your decisions matter for your character build because the perks are all so generic and boring that they pick themselves for you. 'I'm going to use handguns, guess I'll take the handgun perks'.
---
&gt;Do you have any specific examples about what you prefer about four or reasons why it's superior in your opinion?
---
The story has actual characters, a narrative that the player is involved in rather than merely observing.
---
The gameplay is identical to that of Fallout 76 with the slight advantage of being able to pause which alleviates the absolutely atrocious user interface.
---
The game is not designed with a 'keep the player online as long as possible' mentality so all the grinding and collecting feels well paced instead of needlessly extended just to artificially prolong player uptime.
---
The perks are worse than Fallout 3 but still have some fun gameplay-altering picks higher up the trees. (Penetrator, Blitz)
---
The survival mechanics can actually kill you if you don't pay attention.
---
Mods and upgrades to gear are tied to perks instead of grinding items so loot is better because you can actually use it as soon as you find it.
---
They kinda suck anyway, think a shorter ranged version of the flintlock pistol, except it’s only close range and does less damage
---
Oh it's possible, I just dont expect it from such a big company. They will make more money putting their resources into a new game, hopefully they prove me wrong though 
---
Have you tried turning it on and off?
---
I must say, there is a bigger picture and looking at individual cases is time consuming. 
---
Besides there is a strong possibility that in many cases is just fruitless and just ratifies their findings.
---
This does not encourage good will or going the extra mile. 
---
I don't think that's the case. People started hating the very IDEA of this game the moment that it was announced. Long before we saw the first hint of gameplay. They made up their minds that this would be a terrible game, and they've stuck by their guns ever since. Once the gaming websites and youtubers realized how many clicks they could make by capitalizing upon everyone's reflexive hatred, the bandwagon really got going and has never slowed down since. 
---
I'm not saying the game doesn't have its flaws, but the sheer volume and ferocity of the hate directed towards it is wildly out of proportion to any of those flaws. It's people who want to hate and who want to be angry *because they're having fun and feeling rewarded* by hating a game they've never played and have no interest in playing. 
---
Not playing the White Knight here, but...they are not that rare, I do a lot of Technical Data drops, and have several on my Armor/Clothing character for sale right now, and they can also be found as random spawns at Appalachian Antiques.
---
I sell Army Fatigues, Military Fatigues (Camo version), Science Scribe, &amp; BOS Lab coats for 500 caps each, Field Scribe, &amp; BOS Engineers go for 750 each, they are a little more Rare and sought after.
---
Honestly fo76 was my first entry to fallout series, played for 100+ hours and recently bought FO4 and now i kinda understand why people were dissapointed about this new fallout, i'm having more fun on FO4  and can't quite put the finger on why, it feels like the quests have a purpose, while in FO76 i barely receive any rewards for completing a quest, everyone just wanted to level up at the golf club which got me bored very quick.
---
Dude, wake up. Every Bethesda title in the last X years is a disaster at launch, goes through all sorts of hate and it doesn’t matter because people still play it years down the line - because it does get improved and is still good. The legacy of games comes from people playing the games years after release. That’s why they rebuy Skyrim on their switch and whatever other platform it’s available on. What exactly is the projected end goal of your crusade here, apart from instilling your own misplaced sense of superiority?
---
I would love to see PvP exiled
---
to a shit server full of shit people
---
I tried replaying it but keep getting really bad stuttering every 10-15 seconds its a shame no clue why cus i have a RTX 2070
---
Someone, somewhere, must have built a chessboard C.A.M.P. by now...
---
That’s irrelevant. Damage boosts don’t matter when it’s capped at 5 damage. For the record I’ve done previous tests to confirm the 5 damage cap, using everything from a 10mm pistol kneecap shot to a vats crit sniper headshot. There was no variation on max; once I was above what armor would reduce it to (PSA: a base 10mm against a naked power armor frame does like 2-3 damage, so it’s not hitting the cap) nothing would go over 5 damage. If you could go over 5 damages, the sniper rifle crit headshot should do more than a handmade body shot. It doesn’t. 
---
Only BP gun mod is the bayonet for the rifle.
---
I found several of these ar lower levels.
---
Watch the video, go ask him for it he will send it. They never connected any shots on him in the beginning. So they weren't flagged for PvP.
---
Workbench emote.
---
I've been to a workshop and tried to ask the owner if there was any workbench around. He was mostly just scared since I was 100 levels more than him and he probably knew he was in PvP without slap damage.
---
i would like to point out that we are not talking about "some" more adds. we are talking about wave after wave of adds. i just had a SBQ fight where we had to take down 3 mirelurk queens, 2 megasloth and about 40 scorched at the same time. and that was only one of the waves ...
---
the  compass  in the HUD where you have usually a couple of dots for the enemies is basically colored in red during the whole SBQ fight.
---
if you focus on the adds you can make at least 2 level up's per fight even if you are above level 100.
---
&gt; to shit on the people that stuck through the bugs because they saw potential behind a messy (and kinda catastrophic) launch?
---
Is that the story they spin themselves now? Not that they got conned into buying a buggy mess, but that they had the *true vision* to see the potential of the game and eventually will be rewarded for that? Well I suppose it is an easier thing to tell yourself than 'Damn, I should have just waited for it to be good before buying it'.
---
All invited players will be given our gamertag before the event. 
---
Purchased it from a vendor for 600 caps. Train station at Whitespring.
---
Because sentinel is a legendary and rare effect and power armor is mass produced. 
---
Exactly.  Because people are artists and bland sucks. Surviving miners would be angry with Garrahan so they'd definitely defile the logo if with nothing else; but a / across the chest in spray paint 
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I've played the game I didn't like I have the right to shit on it 
---
First off you need to be a mature pet owner and either live with him and all his querks or find him a good home who will adopt him. I don't think you were ready for the responsibility that came with owning a deathclaw. Have you even walked him recently?
---
So, the thing I wind up doing if someone has a smallish bounty is watching them on the map.  If they are traveling from place-to-place, basically acting like a normal player would, and there doesn't seem to be anyone shadowing them, they probably just need their bounty cleared and there are no tricks involved.  Granted, players who sneak don't show up on the map, but it would be difficult to keep up with a player who is moving around at a normal clip and fast traveling across the map - more work than your typical trolls would want to do.
---
Was from one of the talks Todd did where he said the last3 months of making the game was an "all hands on deck" situation with all the locations worked on it to get it out "on time". 
---
I'm an outfit junkie so it's a permanent item in my stash lol
---
I saw a level 2 just leaving the vault and gave them 12 stimpaks, a pipe revolver rifle, some ammo and leather armour I made. They were probably just an alt account though 
---
you do you boo
---
The Harpers Ferry Vendor does sell the pistol Blunderbus, but... tis rare...
---
What works for me is fast traveling to your camp again and I spawn next to it
---
That's exactly what I was implying on -))
---
Horseshit.  It's one of my top-10 games of all time at this point, with over 200 hours in so far.  And been playing PC games since Doom came out in the early 90s.  It's a fantastic game if you like the genre.  If you like NPC-based story lines spoon-fed to you like FO3/4 then it may not be someone's ideal game, but if you play coop with a friend it's fantastic.
---
I have 2 friends that have not played FO76, but absolutely hate it.
---
It's so unjustified it's crazy. Sure, if you've played it and hate it then that's one thing. But to have not even played it?
---
There's a word for that.
---
When players shoot back it shows they have a willingness to fight. If they have a willingness to fight, they have a potential to get farmed. Most PvP players want that. Otherwise, they end up server hopping until they find an workshop owner rich server, spend time traveling into locations, spend time trying to instigate, etc. You don't have to server hop for much these days, but you do if you want to find consistent PvP
---
I do the same only with 5 characters. A little depressing that today's total is 3 tokens. I've got the suit and am just over 200 tokens in towards the head. I think I'm just get grumpy with it today as on top of that I got disconnected from my own nuke when I needed to farm flux and had the game crash at Charleston station just as the bot appeared. It's a very testing day.
---
Appreciate your feedback an testing, something is broke then an frankly they just need to make the only PvP in adventure tied to any Workshop circle area or the Watago High School event. Rest move on to survival!
---
People wanting you to dislike it, to hate it as they do, are the worst. A lot of them have never even played it and wanna tell me how bad it is. Its fucking annoying. Live and let live, FFS. 
---
Go ask the dude for the video, none of them managed to get a hit on him before he stealthed, so none of them had initiated PvP which is why he needed the crits. The video shows none of them were PvP flagged except the level 50
---
Is that the pistol/rifle? I know what the blunderbuss is, I've used one a couple times. I thought that was a spawn for it, apologies 
---
I follow that Fallout News site but it doesn’t seem to be consistently updating Atom Shop content.  
---
&gt;I feel like ghouls have a swing range of like 5ft
---
That is so true, bloody things are impossible to avoid, just the mechanic I suppose. Scorched also run sideways and backwards with perfect aim and hit like tanks, so unrealistic unless this is the hive mind at it again :)
---
Gould sprinting is hilarious though pretty annoying when I'm stealth sniping, tracking them is impossible.
---
Anyway, I'll just keep slogging on until I find *or don't* a solution to this annoying game behaviour.
---
Ah I see, you’ve been saving money your whole life to buy the game and were so disappointed when your nylon bag helmet edition arrived that you vowed to spam f76 subreddit daily for the past month to condescend anyone that might have an opinion that doesn’t align with yours...gg buddy, keep it up lol
---
Seen someone say that AFTER I made the post in the comments section...smh I spoke too fast 
---
Yeah... Mentally instable people really sounds like the best of the best...
---
I suspect, most of the times I have been on a sparsely populated server, it's because other got disconnected.
---
Added!
---
Sorry we all can't be a proactive as you with your 28 days later comment.
---
You should be able to find one at Helvetia sometimes, in the wooden shed looking building along with random hunting rifle variants
---
It is, I farm that spot all the time ;)
---
Oh what do we have here? Someone with a misplaced sense of superiority coming round telling other people what to do?
---
The Army Fatigue is pretty rare. You might do a lot of missions because you are probably high level and could easily farm areas to do so but I know its Rare to me. What console do you use?
---
Iv had Fo76 sens day one and to be totally honest its only fun with friends and well only one of my friends got it when i did everyone else got RedDead2 and they made the better choice. I do belive FO76 can become a great game but in its current state it has entertaining moments. But i do want to clap my hands for all of you who have been playimg sens day one and continue to play today its your determination thhats keepimg the game even going.
---
Yeah it's just less fun gta with a big empty map
---
Nice. Lol.
---
Tricentennial gives you some in game cosmetics and the power armor is basically the “collectors edition” right? Check to make sure I guess if you are considering buying 
---
Goddamn, I didn’t realize you’re a 10 year old. Keep on keeping on little guy. I’m sure Bethesda will refund your money and you can go buy something else you’ll enjoy.
---
The powe armor is the collectors edition that comes with an actual powe armor helmet.
---
Hey /u/Jullz-Wolf/ this guy seems to think you're one shotting people through slap damage with banked crits... can you clarify that you are in fact not?
---
Oh you're one of *those* guys. Part of the 'dud it's only $60 lmao' crowd. Well enjoy that corporate boot to your throat friend.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure after you've bought enough of their hastily released games they'll give you a spot on the board of directors as a thankyou.
---
Although I don't wish this on others, it is good to hear I'm not the only one with this melee stalling issue. I've never managed to get auto stim armor to work, died too many times and gave up on those pieces. Not yet modded my PA to auto stim, but mostly play in standard armor, I like the freedom and unencumbered view.
---
Wow
---
Thank you I look forward to them. 
---
So, I don't take Workshops, but I was under the impression that after the last patch, the PvP mechanic wasn't limited to the radius of the Workshop.  If an aggressor attempts to take control, they basically have carte blanche ability to hunt you down anywhere on the map, even if you aren't near the Workshop.
---
This may be incorrect.
---
What kind of stash box was it? The standard blue and yellow one, or one of the other varities?
---
"Plenty". Of course you can have plenty, if you don't spend them. You can earn about 400 per week with challenges. There is not much stuff which you can buy with 400 per week. The good stuff costs much more than that and will cost you several weeks to buy.
---
But yeah, why having stuff for free, when you can spend currency for it. Got it now. 
---
Oh, alright. I thought it was the blunderbuss lol
---
It's just more frustrating to mess with unless you're alt+tabbing or dual boxing. This would be a whole lot easier if Bethesda just added the feature already. It was one of the first additions suggested by an Obsidian dev at early launch and it seems like a simple QoL addition.
---
Yeah I prefer no pa too but I find that nuked zones with hazmat suit makes u too soft and squishy
---
Junk...junk never changes.
---
It’s a mod for the standard golf club I think.
---
The rarest thing that I’ve only seen once in 500+ hours was the Bone Club, I think it was in the beta and was so long ago I’m starting to think I imagined it 
---
I have a bloodied black power rifle and is my go to gun for massive damage up close 👍 (breaks really easy though) will switch it out for a good legendary dragon once I encounter one cause it fits my rp/hunting style!
---
There is one unstoppable outfit available in game. 
---
I'm excited for new DLC too, but I'm testing out different ways to play, enjoying stealth sniping at the moment so not bored quite yet.
---
Nice explanation thanks
---
I was watching some kool aid dude playing Fallout 4. He was bashing FO76 and I said “You should stream some 76 so I can see the Mothman” just to bust him. His response “I don’t have that game.” Unbelievable.
---
Intentional. It’s so you don’t have to jump.
---
word, which do you play more?
---
So much this!!
---
I’ve picked up bone clubs just yesterday. Not legendary.
---
Yup, it’s a hastily released game
---
Yup it was $60.
---
Yup I enjoy playing it today and have been for a while.
---
If you feel it’s a boot to your throat you can’t be an adult with a job and disposable income.
---
I like fallout. Have since the first game. And like Bethesda despite all the bugs.
---
You claim to hate it but can’t seem to stop discussing it. Whatever floats your boat.
---
Is....is this real?
---
You do indeed have that right, but if you're going to shit on the game then back it up with your own experiences.
---
You say the game is overrated....and that is far from the truth.
---
You say the online has no content....that is FAR from the truth.
---
You say its extremely buggy. I do kind of agree with you on this statement.
---
I've only played online for a few hours, but I've watched my wife play it a lot, as well as lien to her grievances about it. And I've spent hours the campaign, and beat the main story. Redoing chapter 6 to change a few things in the epilogue.
---
I mean they are literally fascists and racists
---
I think I paid $250 for my Power Armor set when it was first offered.
---
Get in the cave man clothes and go primal on everyone 
---
There are probably different amount thresholds depending on what kind of an item it is. Ie 100k normal ammo no red flag, 100k ultracite will raise a flag, 35 bobbles in a month = no red flag, 200 bobbles in a month = red flag, or 35 bobbles in a day = red flag. Or 35 of the same magazine in a week = probably a red flag. Im just spitballing numbers here for a reference, but you might not have to have 100k+ of an item, but if your aquiring items faster than the game normally allows for, its probably gonna raise a red flag.
---
There are quite a few legit daily players who didnt get banned, so you must have done something out of the ordinary to get your account banned/flagged. They probably went with a 100k amount because it puts most legit users at ease, without specifially outlining the values so dupers cant abuse them, by saying within the thresholds.
---
https://gear.bethesda.net/products/fallout-76-power-armor-edition    That shows what came with it originally.  They had substituted a nylon bag for the canvas bag which led to a lot of complaints.  I think it was $250 originally.
---
Not calling you a liar but do you have proof of this? 
---
Let me tell you my worst experience with this: 
---
I have a friend who decided he wasn't interested in this game when it was first announced because he didn't want a multiplayer experience. I said something to the effect of "If you feel like you're at a point in your life where that's not the gaming experience you're into, then I totally understand that. No problem." To my mind, that was the end of the conversation. 
---
Over the course of the next four months, he kept coming back at me, with increasing fury and intensity, e-mailing me over and over again, AND cc'ing all of my gaming-friends in these e-mails, attacking this game based on YouTube videos he'd seen, and attacking me for liking it. I kept basically saying "Well, these videos aren't reflective of my experience. I'm enjoying it, and I feel that many of these arguments in these videos you keep linking are being made in bad faith." 
---
After months of this, I just stopped responding at all because I had no interest in any further discussion with him. I e-mailed him a week or two later about a show I thought he might like and he not only launched back into his angry diatribe about Fallout 76, but attacked me for trying to change the topic. 
---
Finally, when I told him that his bizarre behaviour was never going to convince me to change my mind and that I was trying for a third time to end this conversation, he changed tactics: He told me that he was convinced that I was enjoying this game that YouTube told him I was supposed to hate was a sign that I was suffering from some sort of mental illness, and he was just trying to help me; by showing me all of these clickbait videos, he hoped to guide me away from what he presumed to be self-destructive behaviour on my part. 
---
I pointed out that this was literally *peer pressure*, and that I found it both laughable and pathetic that he would attempt the sort of social leverage against me that is practiced both by and against easily-bullied fourteen year old girls. I then told him that I wanted to stop talking to him about this game because nothing good could ever come of a discussion which was being conducted in such bad faith. 
---
He then furiously told me that trying to end the conversation by telling him WHY I wanted to end the conversation was by definition a continuation of that conversation and it was inexcusable of me to try to steal the last word that way. 
---
It took another month of near-daily e-mails to finally convince him to stop talking to me about this after that. His last e-mail on the topic was a sigh of weary disgust on his part at my failure to understand his perfectly valid and very important arguments. Which I didn't respond to, because by that point I'd tried to stop talking about this something like seven times by then, and was happy to grant him the last word if that's what it took. 
---
Bonus: During the late stages of this conversation, he accused me of trying to convince him to play the game, against his will, when I had said in response to his very first e-mail on the topic that if he didn't want to play it, I totally understood, and had never wavered from that position. He was accusing me of bullying him by not allowing myself to fall victim to his third-of-a-year of ridiculous bullying attempts. 
---
Woulda been awesome if it stayed because you'd have been a legend in Appalachian lore especially if it looked like smeared blood!! 
---
The very first Blood Raven...
---
This would be #1 on my list of things to see.  It would go great with the vending machines we are getting.
---
A nuke dropped close to Morgantown, and I was in the mine southwest it. When I went out the north exit, I Instantly starting to die from radiation (being a level 8).
---
I ran back into the mine to get away from the radiation. Realizing the only safe exit was the western entrance, I ran back to leave the mine. As I was walking away, the earth shook and a Glowing Deathclaw appeared. I tried to run, but couldn't get away fast enough.
---
I was gutted where I stood. 
---
The Power Armor edition came with various physical goodies.  The Power Armor helmet, some figurines, a glow-in-the-dark map, and that infamous bag.
---
I was playing this morning and had a lot of Level 10 and below.
---
I think it's just server luck of the draw.
---
I always craft them a full set of pocketed armor and gift it to them.
---
What's the Twitter account that updates Atom shop items?
---
Well I use both a lot. I made maps for the game Insurgency. Have a few games on pc I play. Just been playing FO76 because I’m having fun. 
---
But my sense of pride and accomplishment! 
---
Yeah I haven’t done anything intentionally out of the ordinary, I’m a legit player and I play ALOT, in the video I cover two theories I have on why I was banned
---
I read about that
---
If your interested in it make sure you research it thoroughly. Many people were upset with the quality.
---
Quick question lol. Where do all the good weapons like this drop? I’m lucky to find a legendary creature once every hour or so and even then they still drop the most useless legendary’s, so far I’m still using a legendary cultists blade with double damage on the first hit I found when I was like level 30. Is there any rhyme or reason to it?
---
I follow FalloutSearch. They do a good job at updating 
---
I have seen and killed about a dozen of them.
---
They are good targets if you enjoy getting 4 caps and a toothbrush...
---
Guaranteed Mirelurk Queen spawn at Sunrise Field (south in Cranberry Bog) and Mac's Farm. Also both are great places to farm Cranberries.
---
Oh disregard my comment then
---
Cough cough rug glitch still works cough.
---
I made Nate in Fallout 76 before: https://imgur.com/gallery/aU3SsM2
---
I suppose he looks alright? I’m sure there’s something I could’ve improved. 😅
---
this behavior by a game company should in no way shape or form be rewarded
---
So nerf ballistic weapons you're saying? Irony :P
---
I didn’t get any caps! What the heck. Only a toy truck and some other little things lol 
---
That's super weird. I could just place a stair if I wanted to walk over without the need of jumping. But thanks for information.
---
Oh jeez, that gift looks just like our Swedish flag! Haha!
---
Wait an actual npc in the game?
---
That's like the only reason I use workshops, not even for the resources just the plans, now I have like 80 plans I need to sell off but most of them are lower tiered(though I have two Nuka-Cola Machines and a Small Letters Set I need to sell off when I can).
---
Let me know once you've read this so I can redact the info so people don't use the exploit.
---
That exploit has existed before the last patch. The only change that happened was you don't have to interact with the bench. Bethesda didn't recently break workshops, they've just been broken.
---
When players are tagged hostile (by contesting workshops or any other means), they are no longer visible on the map to the person they are hostile to and their team mates. The hostility seems to hold for 5 minutes or so, then both players revert to non-hostile and are visible. 
---
In cases like this where PvP is forced from across the map, you only get one kill. The only way to get farmed again is the method I described before, or the original aggressor's team mate must fast travel to the aggressor in order to get their kill. Each player on a team gets one kill per flag of hostility (like initiating a capture of a workshop) and all kills must happen within the cooldown window which is something like 5 minutes.
---
No. There's a glitch where the AA effect on energy guns applies to ballistic damage only, meaning it's a totally useless effect on energy weapons as they don't deal ballistic damage. 
---
You can farm with friends but honestly when you go to sell your crap loot to a vendor carefully go through what he has first. You’ll be surprised what people dump because they have tunnel vision.
---
I'm sorry it wasn't to your tastes. Perhaps you should unsubscribe to this subreddit and find some other subreddits relevant to games which you DO play? 
---
Thanks bro means a lot I should be on around 9:00 pst
---
While being way better now, it still doesn't deliver on everything they've promised. But hey, at least you can play with your friends now.
---
You'd think the rarer monsters (Flatwoods and Mothman) would have something good for how infrequent they are.
---
Nope.
---
Have some garbage!
---
Just looked it up, exactly what im looking for! Thanks :)
---
You can legitimately take on mobs with auto weapons in vats. Ive already played around with it some and it works just fine. If youre having a super bad AP issue, you should invest in things that can regen it or find an auto that has lowered ap usage. 
---
Hey no problem! You’re definitely welcome! 
---
Apparently people don’t expect Bethesda releases to be full of bugs on launch, because they certainly wouldn’t have an established history of this pattern.
---
I haven’t watch the video because he didn’t post it, but nowhere in his post does he say no one got a hit on him before he stealthed. You’ve already made several unequivocally false claims (“he clearly stated he had to build crits to bypass the slap damage nerf” is a direct quote of you. Give me the direct quote of him saying this.) that I assume aren’t your malicious intent to mislead but instead your over assumptions due to inattentive reading. And this isn’t me trying to attack your character, man, I’m trying to encourage you to reread it and learn something. Everyone makes mistakes. It’s mature to re-examine and recognize it; it’s not mature to double down on a mistake. 
---
What I have done is go to Flatwoods and sit on a chair at the cooking station.  Anybody that comes by, I ask them to kill me.
---
But you are right, people sometimes think it's a trap.
---
Yes. I've been in pacifist mode and had a claimed workshop. I got one shotted well outside tha workshop area. That's how I found out that PvP from workshops is on outside of the workshop area and that I'll never keep workshops anymore.
---
Well honestly that alarm base with the 10 turrets is one I'd love to destroy myself...but this guys base wasn't like that so I felt a bit bad.

Nah, im good here. Thanks.
---
&gt; Rumor
---
Let me just stop you right there...
---
Then 1. They didn't watch the promo material Bethesda put out or listen to Jason Schrier when he told them what the game would be. 2. They didn't pay attention to the fact Bethesda was making it. Bethesda is not going to make another New Vegas 2. They aren't focused on the right things to do a second New Vegas (They focus more on player freedom where as Obsidian was more focused on RPG).
---
Courts = innocent until proven guilty. Reddit = guilty until proven, wait we don't believe anything as proof... There needs to be some sort of way to get thru to bethesda about changing their ways.
---
Once you join the Brotherhood and can do the quest, It has a hidden "count" that isn't shown in your inventory.
---
Picking up 1 starts the quest.  Turning it in will give you the rewards and 350 exp.  If you pick up more than one, then turn them in, you will get similar rewards, and 400 exp instead of 350.
---
But, if you log out, hop servers, disconnect, etc. before turning in your "multiples" it will reset this count to 1 and you will only get 350 exp and rewards for turning them in.
---
I almost always turn in 2 or more at a time because I usually only do a single turn in per day unless I find more in my explorations.  I just grab everything the Enclave Military Wing gives me and turn it in.
---
I cannot say if turning in more than 1 at a time gives you any increase chance of rewards.  The chances are already small to begin with.  But I will say I am running about 15% of my turn ins (overall) providing me with 1* Heavy Combat pieces.  And have had numerous T-60 Paints and the BOS Shielded Lining plan.
---
Whether or not turning in more than one depends on whether you are personally planning on making multiple trips, or just one trip.  If you are only planning on one trip, there is no harm in grabbing any of them you see to turn in all at once.
---
This. If you hang around outside of whitesprings when I nuke it and have a farming session, I will give you HUNDREDS of worthless legendaries.
---
I started a new character yesterday. Left the vault and walked toward the lumber mill on my way to the overseers camp....and he was there. I was about to snap a pic when he left...only thing I have now though is a "last 1 minute" screen capture on xbox
---
I managed to stumble upon one of these when I was lvl 10, thought I'd keep it but didn't realize how rare it was haha
---
helvetia
---
Fair enough. I'll just hit "ignore" on you then, since you'll never have anything relevant to contribute to any discussion of the topic. 
---
Can buy bone clubs from vendor near top of world 
---
Haha love it!!! I know no matter what I say the people of reddit will react negatively, but hey I presented my proof and facts and statements which is more than any other Cunt claiming innocence 
---
There's a chart around here somewhere, but I believe it's 65% at less than 10% HP.
---
Hey, good on you for pointing out other testing criteria; I hadn’t mentioned in my post how I’d verified the 5damage/hit cap previously. (I’ve even done it with a bloodied mininuke list at about 1800 damage.)
---
What do you mean? Your post was about people who didn't give Fallout 76 a chance and critique it. I posted in here because I actually gave it a chance..
---
And because I didn't meet your circle jerking bottom line, you're asking what im doing here? Re-read your reply to me a hundred times until it sinks in: Your post might as well have said "BETHESDA IS THE BEST GAME DEVELOPER EVER, LET ME SUCK THEIR BALLS" because that reply to me was everything I needed to know about how "OPENED" you are to people "GIVING IT A CHANCE" and how closed off you are to critique..
---
THE...GAME...FUCKING...SUCKS!
---
My friend I play with refuses to play without having offline mode set on PS4 because he has another friend he just doesn't want to listen to who will rant at him if he sees he's playing FO76. And I would rather toxic non players than toxic players ;). I can just not talk about it with non players but players will ruin my experience if I keep running across them in the game.
---
Okay, I’ll take 10
---
Good bot.
---
Even though this seems like a bug... Bethesda please for the love of everything don't nerf it. Make it a perk or something and make it all or nothing, as this forces a super stealthy playstyle to be viable. I went from a melee build to this and I don't want to do melee ever again, i hate it so much.
---
let's face it, you can't deny that a lot of the hate comes from people who were and still are against the idea of a fallout title being MP.
---
It's a circle jerk of who is the biggest Fallout fan and how F076 hs hurt the series. Yes the game was full of bugs at release but no fallout title has been bug free. Even though the devs are working hard at fixing the game bringing in more content, and listening to the community these "fanboys" will continue to bash on everything Bethesda does regarding F076 (just look at the twitter responses)
---
Critique is healthy, but this is a witch hunt.
---
I'm on PC and, dare I say it, server stability has been excellent ...I think it's been a week or more since I last got a DC
---
More like this is a possible origin story for his clubs.  Driver Nephi hasn't even been born yet.
---
Yeah it’s been like that for the whole time I’ve played this game. I’ve tried to go around the places people claim he was for them but nothing worked. But where my newest camp is, I’ve seen him 2 times this week and was finally able to kill him both times. 
---
I have a lvl 147 ATM and recently started an alternate build.  Around lvl 35 I came across a melee called a bone hammer and it is really cool but so far no plans to make and I have yet to find another to buy at a higher level (now lvl 50+)
---
If you click on the link it explains it....
---
Wow, that's so frustrating. It took a lot of digging to get 17. I can only imagine the rage when you found out. 
---
“The video shows none of them were PvP flagged except the level 50”
---
Oh, and per that- something you should know. A wanted player ALWAYS shows up as “red”. Players who attack you do NOT *until you shoot back*. But once they attack you, they are in PVP with you. So you can shoot back without slap damage. Once you shoot back they will ALSO be red, but not before. 
---
All of my friends that played left. Just me now 
---
Nothing relevant to contribute like how Bethesda contributed Fallout 76?
---
HA! Gotem.
---
There's a Responder medical center in Grafton.  I saw like 20-30 different excavator upgrade plans there.
---
Please God, no.
---
Speaking of which, I have at least 8 treasure maps I haven't even looked at and just hit level fifty.  Anything I should know? Is there a good resource to help me find the treasure if I get lost? 
---
Agreed, they shouldn't nerf it.  They should bring some of the other legendary effects up to par.  Berserker specifically comes to mind, as you lose all the benefits of armor, which is worse IMO than rolling at 10% health all the time :)
---
So, as someone with 2 accounts, the way that I farm is typically to nuke Whitesprings and then tag all the ghouls with my alt and kill them with my main. Double the loot and I get to power level my alt and I have a mule right there to transfer excess items to. This is obviously easiest when there's no one else there ot mess up my pulls. 
---
When I'm done farming, I always feel bad that I'm just leaving the world. It would be nice if I could hand it off to someone like myself who could really make use of it. What I propose is that we form some kind of Discord server or subreddit dedicated to handing off "solo" servers.
---
I think this would be a great idea. Then no one could say it was accidental 
---
That’s been a concern of mine. I’ve made some donations low levels and I’m still at 19. 
---
Have a good set of gear, but can’t get the Xp farming to go my way yet. Got shit I don’t have levels to use. Almost three sets of power armor assembled -45 -51 -60 started scrapping and selling. Some of it before the stash size upped to 800. 
---
It is overrated IMO it doesn't deserve the 
---
Fallout boy haven't been good since from under the cork tree, prove me wrong 
---
Ah, so you meant to say have the AA legendary effect on energy weapons to do that, not in general.  Got it ;)
---
Just a plastic toy, OK if you're into that kind of thing.
---
Honestly, that really sounds like a bug because it's absurd otherwise.

I use this site.  You can find good stuff too.  Like PA Mod Plans.
---
I hear Luck affects how often you find plans.  But I am running only 3 Luck myself and have had a good yield.   
---
is it cheap on pc? any deals? saw it go for 47 ish usd on g2a but i’m not 100% sure i wanna use that site.
---
I see your all purpose golf club and raise you a barbed drill!!! It was a queen drop! I can feel your jealousy already!!!!
---
Never seen a flying assaultron or my weapon suddenly transforming to something else or heard anyone else report it; if those are bugs, they sound like very rare ones.
---
The keycards have been an issue for a while.  Took me forever to realize I wasn't picking up the one with the quest diamond next to it.  DOH!
---
And yeah...that rooftop battle is a bitch. I got my ass kicked pretty hard the first time I attempted it.  Luckily some robots at street level kept the scorchbeast's attention through a lot of the final battle.
---
Compared to almost any other game in the past year, on a technical level 76 is just straight up terrible. Please don't even try to defend this.
---
Helping low levels was gratifying, but with how few people want to play this multiplayer game with other people it's kinda a bother to even try anymore.
---
I'm farming 3 star legendaries to trade to purveyor when that guy comes out, and I'm just trying to learn everything I can / test everything that I can for when Survival mode comes out and eventually Nuclear Winter mode. It's become a lot more fun since I got a 2nd account and I can farm / mule much more efficiently.
---
You need flux for the lining of your underarmor, but not a lot of it.
---
It's pretty impossible to give anyone here "proof"
---
No one here can do anything about your ban.
---
Everyone here can speculate innocence and guilt.
---
First thirty seconds, sceptical brains will say.
---
1: transfer duped items to mule
---
2: take video of main as insurance
---
3: transfer items back, or not.
---
None of us here have any sway in these decisions
---
Same.  I saved mine until I was over 50, and eventually went and collected all of them.  I didn't get anything worth keeping (except misc. junk).  I had about 15-20 maps.
---
There may have been a plan or two I didn't have, but mostly it was all junk to me.
---
It's in a watery area right next to Treetops in the Mire. Its also facing towards the road so if you run forward from the front of the red rocket you will run into it also
---
Exactly. I'm just starting out. I took the first workshop I found and this is what I get. I'm sure he could have easily server hopped and found an unoccupied workshop. I barely see anyone take workshops when I'm logged in and now I see why.
---
It's a scumbag thing to do, but perhaps he was looking for some PVP action. 
---
I think maybe they should also show the owners lvl when hovering over the workshop? That way these guys can't claim ignorance on the original owners lvl.
---
Power up any of the 3 power plants 3 times with the event and you get all the generator recipes for free.
---
Why are you so mad, do you need radaway for that toxicity 
---
Just because I have disposable income doesn't mean I enjoy wasting it. Having 'more money than sense' is not a good thing.
---
Can someone from Bethesda take this to the devs so we can get an answer? /u/ladydevann /u/valseek
---
Would be nice if the devs can address (perhaps in a future Inside The Vault) if they feel PvP is necessary in adventure mode when a clear majority of the players are for a full separation (just look at this topic and many others that have been raised in the past for separate PvP and PvE servers).  There are alternative formats to PvP combat for challenging workshop ownership if that's a concern to the devs.
---
LOL!!!! aww no relevant reply...
---
Thank you for proving everything I already assumed about you. Please, circle jerk harder.
---
Im gonna LOVE seeing this shit go free to play and then die.
---
You mean a container that you could build that was accessible to all? Kinda like how the artillery chest worked before they patched it? It was used for exploits. Maybe if they could find a way to implement this without adding a doorway for an exploit
---
You didn’t waste it, you’ve been having the time of your life daily shitting on this game on this subreddit for the past month. Money well spent, mate!
---
[no](https://imgur.com/a/33nnqlZ)
---
The appeal of Tech Data to me is how it fits nicely in my Vendor route.  Plus the legendaries are always Heavy Combat Armor, which makes them nice.
---
Sorry do you mean one Unstoppable (from the comics) or one Unstoppable (you cannot die while wearing this), Outfits? 
---
I agree that "-50% Gun Accuracy" is a really vague concept.
---
I haven't noticed much of a difference since taking it.  From what I understand, aiming-down-sights and VATS are basically unaffected.  And Shotguns are favored for their "inaccuracy" to begin with, so, especially if your main use of a Shotgun is to trigger Enforcer, it wasn't game-changing for me.
---
They have self-respect to not buy and defend a product that is notorious for breaking itself even further with each patch it gets
---
Two unstoppable outfits were available in game without using atoms.  For any of the other outfits you could easily earn atoms in game.  And that in no way makes the game Pay-To-Win.  The only thing that did was give an advantage to playing in groups instead of by yourself.  Even then, I have no problem with it.
---
Because your reply is irrelevant, people like the game, deal with it, now go treat that anger issue 
---
Yup, it is the post-apocalypse after all.  Every other Fallout game has hostile humans. In other fallouts I could be ambushed on the road by raiders or hunted down by ncr or the legion.  In a game built around the premise that war never changes and humans will always fight with eachother, there is an intense lack of fighting amongst people.
---
So to replicate this, you need to get below 10% hp with the adrenal reaction perk and log out / back in?
---
I consider myself pretty lucky. I’ve gotten some nice drops. Not exactly for my build but interesting just the same 
---
Launch the launcher with Steam (add a shortcut) and use steam to customize the controller.   I got the nintendo switch working that way.  You might try my settings profile for it called Zbad something or other
---
YO fuck this police *Proceeds to throw a bottle at them* 
---
I think hype might be a problem. The smaller studios you mentioned might just say "Hey guys we made this game, what do you think?" and having no expectations people will have an appropriate reaction. Studios like Bethesda will be on the big stage with flashing lights at e3 saying their game will be FUCKING AMAZING, and then when it's just ok folk are disappointed and internet folk are furious.
---
I think the core game here is really good, but they've failed when it has come to dealing with stability, bugs and exploits quickly. That is something that a large experienced  company like this should be on top of.
---
So, it’s only good because of a glitch? They’d just patch it if they ever roll it out.
---
"Limited storage"  If you want unlimited, get an FO4.  If you could store whatever you wanted, it would ruin the game!
---
One thing thay will be a bit tricky is the favorites wheel since the gyro will want to make it flip all around erratically.  I got around that bby making the faves wheel button disable gyro while held down

\&gt; "It just works"
---
\&gt; Crowd laughs
---
"But he said it just works! Clearly that wasn't a tongue in cheek jab at themselves, moments after saying they intended to evolve and support it because they have no idea what issues might pop up in the first online Fallout game!" 
---
The wife and I got 2 copies at launch.  I'm a huge fallout fan that has played every fallout game.  She's never played any but knows I love them and was excited to play one with me.
---
So we spent $120 bucks on the game.  I consider a game to be worth it if we get one hour of fun per dollar spent.  We certainly didn't get that.
---
From a technical functionally aspect the game and servers didn't work well.
---
From a design aspect, it's not nearly as fun to me as other fallout games.  But they took a risk on the design so I can respect that even if I didn't like it.  I found myself bored without NPCs and only interacting with bots, terminals and holotapes.
---
I also just don't understand who wanted PvP in a fallout game.  Granted the wife and I played together only about 80-100 hours but we were griefed several times during that time.  We had to give up on quests and got our camps destroyed as well.  And yes, we were in pacifist mode.
---
And we don't hate PvP.  Battlefield is one of our big games together.  Just don't like the idea of PvP in fallout and certainly not the implementation of it.
---
At the end of the day, when the wife and I were deciding to do housework instead of play fallout 76 we knew the game wasn't for us.
---
Sure, it might be better now.  But it's already dead to us.  It's like that crappy ex girlfriend who claims to have turned her life around and wants you back.  Why bother finding out, you've moved on to greener pastures.
---
I will say though, people fussing about you playing it need to get a life.
---
Shit, you sure destroyed everyone who enjoys the game. I don't know what I'm going to do.
---
Buy some nuka-grapes and save the rest of your caps
---
Idk dude no man’s sky was basically an indie game made by like 20 people at most, and most gamers didn’t actually expect the game to be as fleshed out as Sony and them were pushing it to be. It was surprising it even worked as well as it did, at least to me.
---
76 is a AAA game from a AAA studio with AAA funding and hundreds of employees and its surprising how much it DOESN’T work. 
---
I’m pretty sure both had around the same development time. IMO the situations aren’t comparable. Not to mention according to who you ask 76 has actually gotten worse since release, NMS kinda just didn’t do anything until they were ready to improve it 
---
Don’t be an early adopter. This is happening across the market with people rushing a product to market, but people keep voting with their dollars to sustain these practices because we have no impulse control. That burden is on the consumer, not the producer.
---
Is It Possible For Me to start a Xbox one operative base / version of the if so  Im Nintendo\_man447 Aka Operator Hobo
---
Just let is spawn and place an Overseer's cache with a decent weight limit in it.
---
And all those people enjoying the game must be having so much fun if they come here to post about it instead of playing it. Truly time well spent.
---
I only know of the MoM one. What’s the second? 
---
That doesn't make much sense.
---
If a game is fun to play, it must be doing something right. It's a shitty fallout, but an enjoyable game on its own. To be fair, Fallout 4 fits the same description.
---
Read it.  Thanks.
---
r/suicidebywords
---
I know I've played all of the games... I still want faction stencils.
---
It’s not a bug, per se (the hidden bonus is basically 90% radiation reduction that stacks with radiation resistance- think if it like how damage resistance from armor stacks with % damage reduction from perks/legendary effects.)
---
They clearly added it to those items intentionally.
---
But I agree that it’s not *balanced* at all. 
---
Cool...?
---
He's providing soothing white noise to help you sleep. 
---
You don’t go to subreddits of your favorite games to engage in discussion? Oh right, I already know the answer to that...
---
This so much.
---
Oh duh! For some reason I was having a blonde moment and was thinking release date, not year. I need some coffee. :P
---
And flies around the top when it's spoiled food....
---
Sure, if you want to bring yourself down.
---
Maybe they mean "bug-free for a Bethesda game"?
---
I agree and I'm in the same position, and it would be the best place except everybody thinks the same thing so you have to compete with everybody else in the same position. At this point I log in and check the vendors to see if anyone's sold any legendary items I'd consider using, then unless somebody launches a nuke in that time it takes me to check the vendors, log out.
---
When i read those i wonder if they ever stop and think about how fucking stupid it make them look.
---
I always use pistols as a back up. Either automatic or non automatic but not both. But im assuming you'd want to do both. I think packing light isn't necessary because they're already pretty light. Sniper perks are useful because revolvers handle alot like rifles. Not much groundbreaking info here for you but that's all i got. 
---
Doesnt deserve the? 
---
Were you going to finish off with "hate" or something like "brainless trolls like u/Shaggyotis who talk shit about the game, and can't form their opinion because their last brain cell died alone a few years ago and just want to say that they are 'against the mainstream' because they don't circlejerk-off their fellow redditors, even though they are a loud component of the internet echo chamber?"
---
And how is online lacking in content? That alone is the biggest lie in your comment, and isn't exactly an opinion...at least not one that can be backed up with facts.
---
Then again, your last brain cell died alone a few years ago...
---
Enforcer was life at lower levels. Or when my unarmed build got in a pinch. Take out the legs and then mop up with the giant deathclaw on my hand. Lol. Plus it is always funny watching some of the mobs try to do the worm after you take out both legs. 
---
That’s how the quest is at the end. It’s how it was for me. Died my first time and gave it a bit before I can back. Made sure I was ready for what I was up against 
---
the bone club spawns at top of the world in the area with the fire traps, I've found one there a few times but so far not mods have unlocked for scrapping it :(
---
I also get the Bomber Jacket frequently, but a couple of friends never got it after more than 100 TD drops, so I traded them for Engineers Outfits that sell better in my shop.
---
At the end of the day, I play the game daily and enjoy it and feel like I’m getting my $60 worth. You just find people who enjoy it so you could disagree with them as if it’ll change their mind. So joke’s on you.
---
Bugs are to be expected in a multiplayer game that came from a company with little to no online game experience. To top that off they are  company known to have bugs in all there games at launch.AAA titles are coming out like this because of the direction sales system that’s in place now in the gaming community. Five to ten years agoidea the major game developers at the time thought it would discourage new buyers if games went above the standard 60+tax so they started with the nickel and dime hack jobs we’ve been seeing season passes , cutting content to resell later,loot boxes, pay to play, etc... games on average should cost about 100 now,if they had continued the 20 dollar price raise every decade or so. So now we’re in this shitty limbo where developers are rushed out the door with their products because of cost . Don’t take the time for the little things like they used to. games are getting staler by the year we keep seeing reskins ,ripoffs, and generally no originality at all. we get one new idea/mechanic/game changer in the gaming community and the developers see this and realize they can make profit off someone else’s Idea and every one  does it all at once .as you can see from the battle royal fad it went from one to that’s all that’s coming out for a year or so . They developers need to up there base price to 100 and don’t do any more season pass charges or loot boxes (for other than cosmetics) and do fewer games spend the time on the games they work on to make them works of art like they should be not the mass produced cattle feed we’ve been getting.

'Hey guys, I'm here on my computer to talk about how much I love this other thing on my computer instead of doing that thing.'

Time well spent, mate!
---
Life is tough in the Wastelands.
---
This train derailed with the MANY and I mean MANY screw ups Bethesda has done.
---
If you need to look at the state of the game and its small portion followers, check out the day Bethesda "fixed" duping a week or two ago. Everyone was PRAISING Bethesda for something they should have done A LONG time ago. PRAISING Bethesda for "doing something right"..
---
When you have to praise a company for what other companies do automatically, without a hiccup, there's something terribly wrong with it.
---
And when all circle jerk posts are upvoted and any critique is downvoted, there's something wrong with the community.
---
This game is gonna die and nothing is gonna stop that.
---
Someone give me gold so I can give to this gentleman please, very respectful comment
---
game of the year
---
Lol wut. They are literally cards and come in packs with gum like baseball cards used to. They're exactly like trading cards.
---
That is actually a really nice idea, have the bag be all mold-stained and lots of flies!
---
Yeah, I like the iron sight, I don’t like automatic anything lol and I don’t like Vats either. 
---
I thought it would be good to try coz I was fighting a scorchbeast in watoga and all I had on me was a two shot 10mm I found and I tell you it didn’t to badly at all, burnt through a LOT of ammo tho lol 
---
I just got my second Unyielding+acrobats leg (and it had AP refresh! Traded a Chameleon/rad resist/Sentinel leg for it). So nice to have on a Bloodied build, I’ve accidentally died to fall damage too many times running around at 10-20% health all the time!
---
YES!!!!!!!! because i've been in parties and grabbed bags not even realizing it wasn't mine. There is no way to try and sort that back out either ...
---
Personally I like it and it’s the only reason I bought the game. I dont care for p v p and the constant upstaging and cheats and bullshit. The map is huge and the exploration doesn’t get old (if that’s why you play like I do). It’d be nice to have more npcs and such but overall it’s really well made. The fact that it resembles fallout 4 in that regard doesn’t bother me either as I loved that game. But to each his own. That’s my penny and a half
---
I will look in dropped bags when I stumble across them. But if they have any of the commonly used materials in it (ballistic fiber, adhesive, etc) I usually leave it alone and assume it is a death bag. Unless I kill the person. If I kill them I take it all, because they did something to ware t me to take off pacifist and pvp their ass. Lol. 
---
It goes against the whole aesthetic and will not happen. Maybe we'll get some new songs on the radio, though.
---
That's not innately the consumers fault. No matter how you look at it, its initially the producers that are scamming or intentionally producing faulty products. Current consumers help promote that habit. But it's not the consumers fault for buying into market tactics and a promised product. 
---
If this was virtually any other kind of product the blame wouldnt be on consumers. Imagine putting down money for the Tesla when it came out to find out that its battery life was half of what was promised, the fabric on the interior was fake and half stitched together, marketed a touchscreen radio/UI but got a single turn knob and 4 buttons, and they promised.... I dont know six cup holders and you only got 1. You wouldnt be like "its early adopters fault... Teslas in the clear".
---
This \^\^ I'm sure not going to, my build is now at a sweet spot, enough cards to change builds depending on how I want to play, the idea of starting again gives me the shakes.
---
I think it's improved a lot since the last patch and I'm having more fun playing it now than I ever have. Still wish I could have my base near my brothers base though. It's not like the orange circles overlap.
---
If you can set your sale price as zero, the new vendors will do basically this.
---
I... need to figure out how to do this. That’s amazing. My base is on a cliff and has a balcony (landing pad for jet pack power armor to come in the top, really). 
---
I'd say it's still pretty effective on higher levels too.  There isn't a whole lot that isn't neutralized by it, save for maybe Scorchbeasts (who seem to treat crippled wings as more of a "suggestion" to land than a mandate these days).
---
Is it free to play yet ? 
---
Are any of them for sale? 
---
Most games used to be all text in their dialogue - and that was fine with me.  As you didn't actually make an argument against the story itself - which is multilayered and amazing - I'm going to go ahead and offer you the opportunity to actually say something about the story - or drop the argument because you have nothing to base it on.  Your choice.
---
As for replay value - i tend to enjoy replaying games when they have a big sandbox for me to play in and lots of interactivity with the environment.  I also like playing different character builds and the SPECIAL system in 76 incentivises different playthroughs because you can't have everything on a single character.
---
In regards to the characters, if you don't like robots or dead people that sounds like a personal preference, but many of the characters are great.  Abigail is one of my favorite characters since Moira Brown.  She's endearingly awkward, brave, intelligent - her being dead doesn't change her impact on me as a character.  She pulled me in and made me want to succeed where she had failed.
---
The gun system is more in depth than in 4 - you can toggle your guns more specifically to your play-style - as opposed to there being just stronger or weaker mods.  Here you can fine tune a weapon to work with it's legendary mods more effectively as well as with your specific SPECIAL and perk loadout.
---
As for the CAMP system I prefer it to the settlement system.  You can build the CAMP almost anywhere and you don't need repetitive settlers in order for it to function. 
---
In regards to your points in my playing of the game I never felt as if I wasn't involved with the narrative - I think the story of someone finding the world in ruins and investigating in order to find out how to stop it from total collapse is a pretty compelling story.
---
In regards to game-play there are some significant differences - VATS is a lot more engaging in 76 than in 4.  It takes practice to get used to it but it is far more enjoyable than the bullet cam slow down system used in four - for me at least.
---
I like both survival sets - i think 76 style works better for a multiplayer game - though the system in 4 was really fun for single player.
---
I'm split on your last point because I love using resources to research gun mods once i get the plans - it makes me feel like my character is perfecting the plans by doing independent engineering research, but I can understand why someone would want to use a gun immediately.  I for one like that I have earned my ability to use my favorite weapons more effectively.
---
I'm still not seeing a connective thread in your points where an objective standard exists for what is a good or bad game as you had said earlier.  Have you abandoned that conceit or are you saving your excellent reasoning as a happy surprise for me?
---
Or are you claiming that a standard exists outside of whether or not it is fun to some as some form of hyperbole?  But why would you do that?
---
Look at the pictures, where it shows the caps they got for killing them. Notice how it doesn't say anything about receiving their bounty?
---
I can't find your GT. Can you add me instead? I'm frostysundew70
---
I'm not here to change your mind. I'm here to laugh, heartily, as all these *free thinking individuals* perform the same routine in front of a big corporation. If you feel like you're getting your $60 then congratulations, your quality standards have been eroded to such a degree that you have become the perfect patsy for huge publishers to milk.
---
Someone said this when the original game was coming out but they were proven to be wrong. Maybe the deal just fell through. I also heard that Linkin Park could do some new songs. I am guessing these are trolls making it up. With that being said, I can imagine "In The End" blasting while I'm dropping some radiated rat meat in my friend Jon's mobile home. 
---
Not saying Tesla is in the clear, I’m just saying this has been a prevalent market practice for a while and people still buy in. I stopped early adopting unless I know I can trust the company and even then, sometimes I still wait. You never know.
---
Not right now sorry.
---
This is exactly why I said you’re not an adult. When you grow up you’ll find disposable time during the day to go to subreddits. But yeah, keep it up till you tire yourself out!
---
Acts Like a Shotgun though doesn't it? I thouhgt Shotgun perks effect blunderbus?
---
When Bethesda designed to FO76 version of camps they decided that all areas of a camp building should be accessible. Because foundations are tall enough to prevent people from getting on top of them if placed at their max height, Bethesda added and invisible stair like mechanism. 
---
It should be easier to respec, but in addition if there’s not a built in option to allow everyone a free respec after balance changes, there should be. I’m new so if there is already...good on them!
---
So sad...
---
Thanks! I'm gonna sojourn and find more!
---
True to This.  I kept having Ticks destroy my fusion generator, so I locked it inside a building that literally had no entrances.. 
---
log back in, power is out again.  Go to build mode, move a wall out of the way, theres another destroyed generator with a single tick inside the sealed building.  
---
Tried putting turrets around it, no help.
---
after about 6 times, I just moved my camp.  Now I have scorched shooting my tato plants constantly.  They sure hate their tatos.
---
Yeah I was like WAIT WHAT A WEAPON I'VE NEVER SEEN!!!!?!?!?!
---
I'm at level 170 and too many hours invested but I know I'm shit so I play within my limitations.
---
Or maybe I knew it was gonna be a buggy mess at launch and decided not to get a refund after beta before release. And I can’t wait to play tonight!
---
Also can someone tell me why any player is allowed to retrieve my loot when I die in pve? 
---
Dying of radiation then getting your loot "stolen" is frustrating.
---
I've tried to organise this and been unsuccessful. I tried to use the Danny Shorago (Hancock) AMA on /r/fo4 as leverage and as an example of how smoothly it can go, but I've never once heard back from any official account or CM, even to say "no".
---
I'm not a man, I'm a woman. Stop misgendering me "man". I know how instigating crit sniping can 1 shot people because I have a instigating sniper rifle for that exact purpose and used it as recently as last night.
---
There have been a few people in the last few days here that are giving it another go and seem pleased with the game improvements. More changes and additions coming this month, so I'd say it's a good time to step back in.
---
Pretty sure photo mode is client side. For others to see the photos they would have to be server side to be viewed by others most likely 
---
I was surprised By how much I enjoyed third person perspective using a pistol. I almost never prefer third person but the early levels of the game with a pistol and third… Just feels great
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
I try not to take any Junk along when entering any Blast Zone, but when I do so, I have no expectation of retrieving it if I die, and won't even look for it until all the fighting is done, surprisingly in SBQ battles, 90% of the time I find my bag intact after the fight is over.
---
I don't really mind that you think a mediocre to bad game belongs in the all-time top 10 of games. To each his own.
---
I will give that a try lol
---
Thats probably becaurse you are a rational human beeing.
---
He's been playing since beta. How the hell is he supposed to get a refujd 4 months later 
---
BETHESDA IS LEAKING!!!
---
100 percent agree. I have the gear and cards I need to enjoy the game without the endless grind. I really do not want to start over. 
---
That's a really strange find!
---
Tagging to follow the mystery.
---
Saw it too , game froze when I tried to purchase 
---
For someone new to drawing this is fantastic, you're a natural. My only critique would be to watch for proper proportioning and perspective, i.e. Her upper torso &amp; the nuka bottle respectively. But really, this is very good.
---
Ultranoob
---
I really enjoyed fo4 as well. I liked the npcs, but I’m in the mood to just walk about and discover. 
---
I like the idea of a massive map too.  How’s the gameplay as far as server connections and bugs? Does it feel improved? 
---
If the Nuka Woeld full theme song was the only song known by every singer in Appalachia..
---
Would be both fantastic and terrible 
---
I like getting wierd weapons like that.....ive never seen that one! 
---
make a ton of cranberry cobbler for xp bonus
---
So weird, I might try this
---
Let me know if you want to sell that Radium Rifle :)
---
Yeah can't buy anything from the vendor with a value of 0. So if you run into that take off the "hard bargain" perk if you want to buy it. Although it is pretty much useless as it is like a "hot plate, cooking scale, or coffee pot". It is just a junk item and can't be used to increase food durability.
---
I'm not sure the percentage that it heals, I prefer it on an automatic weapon. I have it on a .50 cal and when I shoot, no matter if it's a ghoul or mirelurk queen, my health doesnt move and stays full. It certainly saves me on stems 
---
Best advice is just wander for now. You’ll pick up random materials, but you’ll have a chance to learn the new workbenches, weight limits, etc. Dont worry about completing the main line quests yet, but any daily or event quests you stumble upon will give you good experience and some needed mats. 
---
Ok that’s good to hear. I never picked it up to begin with, but I just want to explore the map. Most of my time spent in fo4 wasn’t mission related. Just walking around and clearing areas. 
---
This on PC? I sold a Food Dehydrator at Watoga Train Stn. I think I found it at Whitespring or Moonshiners shack (memory is fuzzy) first time I'd seen that item too
---
I think some things have gone wrong with the SQB.  I generally stopped doing the fight because it never seems worth it.  I did jump in to two of them back-to-back last night and saw some of these same issues.  I'll try to list them all since it's still fresh in my memory and I had several "WTF?!?" moments.
---
A.  The adds are insane now.  Not just in quantity, but also in quality.  They were coming from everywhere and in what seemed like an endless wave.  If I didn't disengage and start killing them I would quickly be in trouble.  Also had a few  slinky-dogs show up...  In fact, we started getting an unstable server a few times there were so many adds showing up.  If the boss fight is breaking your server, I'm thinking it's probably bugged.
---
B.  The SBQ froze in mid-air above us for a few minutes until someone unfroze her by crippling a wing.  Other times she'd just check out for a few minutes with no one knowing where she went or she flew off to another point in the zone and started attacking random things.  The fight is much harder now, so those 2-3  minutes of no damage being dealt can add up into a failure easily.
---
C.  I think I agree that there's some sort of damage bug.  My melee build hits pretty hard and I'm used to seeing at least a sliver come off every time I wallop the SBQ.  There were multiple times in the fight where I'd be nose-to-nose, seeing the blood spatter animation from a hit and nothing was happening to her.  This is in conjunction with no discernible damage being done by everyone else throwing lead into her.  Then, the SBQ would start taking damage again and it would be coming off pretty reliably until the process repeated.    
---
The issues above came up in both fights so you may be on to something about some fundamental problems with the SBQ fight.  
---
Sign me up, lol PSN: drakken75
---
Cool, thanks.
---
Xbox
---
I’ve been asked many times but no that’s a keeper. Since I bought the plan to build them I’m very interested.
---
Never mind. Just noticed you said WS Stn.
---
Be happy to, add my psn, catch me when I am on
---
I've asked for this too.  
---
If I come across a player and pull out my pipboy to drop things they're usually gone by the time I look up again.
---
Most often waving them over makes them run away.  
---
I put stuff in suitcases but most don't know to look, especially in low level areas; (cos they're more likely to need aid than someone who's made it to Watoga).
---
They’re 12000 caps to buy I heard.
---
that have nothing to do with power armor. it's just becouse you always wear a pa in nuke zones doesn't make it crash. it's hardwarebased to desync the memory in the processors cache what make the game keeps crashing. it's all about the codes the game is written.
---
Huh. I’ve never run into him. That’s good to know, thank you.
---
Hello Games (makers of NMS) has 16 employees. 
---
Bethesda Game Studios employs 400. Its an apples to oranges comparison there. 
---
While I understand the comparison because both were somewhat of a bust at launch, there’s even less of an excuse for Fallout because it’s a ton of recycled content and it’s not even their first MMO. 
---
That being said I do enjoy the game. I just think the comparison between the two is way off base because it gives Bethesda some kind of credit that they don’t deserve. 
---
Someone might seem to have a mental illness,lol. But its not you.
---
Haha agreed. Album still holds up. 
---
Ah gotcha.
---
XB1, thanks for the offer though! This would be a perfect game for cross platform, kinda hoping for it.
---
I looked at all 3. He got a 293 reward for killing the L293, which is exactly what you expect from winning a mutual PVP fight.
---
The second two pictures BOTH SHOW HIM CLAIMING BOUNTIES. 
---
At this point I’m done discussing anything with you. You are doubling down on your mistakes and not re-examining what you believe to be your evidence, and if this continues I’m wasting my time trying to reason with you because you’re only trying to defend yourself. I get it, you feel attacked and are getting defensive.
---
Don’t let your ego choke down your intelligence. Be better than that. 
---
You can get it from a vendor for 10,000 caps but someone on the market76 could be selling it for 4,000 to 5,000 caps
---
"Oh my God, I just stabbed a parking attendant, where's the button to turn myself in!?"
---
I actually read it as The Tick....
---
Avoid doing any quests that reward you with unique gear until you're level 50 so they are leveled up. If you complete the quest at low level the gear will be low level. So wait to do the Grafton mayor quest for all rise. You can do the story line quests up to Morgantown airport then wait. Morgantown is a great place to level up lowbies, then once you hit around 20 go and do the quests around the dried lake east of Charleston and become Batman, and then go down to the ash heap and level around in the mines. After thst you should be mid 30s and have a decent grasp on the game.
---
I really disagree with the NMS comparison. BGS told us exactly what to expect, and never lied about the content of the game itself. Hello Games straight up lied multiple times. 
---
Sorry but this is a ridiculous excuse. Before, we could get a fan made patch that would fix the game. Now you get banned for modding if you add small patches. Sorry but this is ridiculously circle jerky.
---
&gt; Most games used to be all text in their dialogue - and that was fine with me. As you didn't actually make an argument against the story itself - which is multilayered and amazing - I'm going to go ahead and offer you the opportunity to actually say something about the story - or drop the argument because you have nothing to base it on. Your choice.
---
The story is not multilayered and amazing. The story is over by the time you get there. Chasing ghosts and saving no one.
---
&gt;As for replay value - i tend to enjoy replaying games when they have a big sandbox for me to play in and lots of interactivity with the environment. I also like playing different character builds and the SPECIAL system in 76 incentivises different playthroughs because you can't have everything on a single character.
---
'I'm going to pay a strongman that...runs through appalachia, launches a nuke and kills a scorchbeast.'
---
'I'm going to play a smartman that...runs through appalachia, launches a nuke and kills a scorchbeast.'
---
'I'm going to play a &lt;x&gt; that...runs through appalachia, launches a nuke and kills a scorchbeast.'
---
The only replayablilty is when you literally decide not to interact with the designed game.
---
&gt;In regards to the characters, if you don't like robots or dead people that sounds like a personal preference, but many of the characters are great. Abigail is one of my favorite characters since Moira Brown. She's endearingly awkward, brave, intelligent - her being dead doesn't change her impact on me as a character. She pulled me in and made me want to succeed where she had failed.
---
What impact did she have? You didn't talk to here. You didn't influence here. You didn't interact with her. If she was actually a robot not a person would it change anything? Great characters being a complete non-entity in the actual narrative.
---
&gt;As for the CAMP system I prefer it to the settlement system. You can build the CAMP almost anywhere and you don't need repetitive settlers in order for it to function. 
---
It's the same system.
---
&gt;In regards to your points in my playing of the game I never felt as if I wasn't involved with the narrative - I think the story of someone finding the world in ruins and investigating in order to find out how to stop it from total collapse is a pretty compelling story.
---
Who are you saving? Why does it matter? If your character didn't exist what difference would it make? You aren't involved in the narrative, you are a tool of it. You don't get to decide anything, you just do things because the weak story demands you do it.
---
&gt;In regards to game-play there are some significant differences - VATS is a lot more engaging in 76 than in 4. It takes practice to get used to it but it is far more enjoyable than the bullet cam slow down system used in four - for me at least.
---
So the 'significant difference' is that you can't pause a multiplayer game.
---
&gt;I like both survival sets - i think 76 style works better for a multiplayer game - though the system in 4 was really fun for single player.
---
76 style has absolutely no danger. There is no scarcity and also no real penalty for death so it is both hilariously easy to survive and also hilariously non-problematic if you do die.
---
&gt;I'm still not seeing a connective thread in your points where an objective standard exists for what is a good or bad game as you had said earlier. Have you abandoned that conceit or are you saving your excellent reasoning as a happy surprise for me?
---
The 'standard' is defined by the existing material. I have said this already. Multiple times.
---
&gt;Or are you claiming that a standard exists outside of whether or not it is fun to some as some form of hyperbole?
---
No, because as I said fun can be had with something that is bad. The only people that equate fun with good are the ones who take criticism of a product as a personal attack on taste.
---
I do run a tactical shotgun with a drum mag even at lvl 100+, but I don’t use it as much as I used to. Mainly if I feel like messing around or if I do a nuke run and get overrun by ghouls I pull it out, being unarmed I can’t take many hits before I am fucked. My deathclaw gauntlet can one shot most mobs at full health even at ~350 damage. 
---
My advice is that I don’t think it’s cheap enough still. I paid less than $20 for mine sealed on eBay. I’d recommend that because it’s still $40-$60 in stores (and more for digital strangely). 
---
I still enjoy it. But there are a ton of valid criticisms. And I don’t think it’s going to live them down. Mostly because Bethesda should be held to a higher standard. 
---
You guys have brainwashed yourselves. 
---
I honestly believe it's noise that brings them. When I build they attack, when I have generators going they attack, same with purifiers and pumps. But if I live by oil light, have no purifiers, and am not building nothing attacks. Heck I get animals like squirrels and rag stags instead. I truly believe silence is the best way to live in 76.
---
My favorite Fallout. I avoided it because of bad press and clickbaity YouTube vids and I wish I didn't. A friend bought it for me asking me to just try it and I play it more than he does. Yeah it has bugs yeah it can be annoying but I don't really ever let it get to me as I don't see them as a deal breaker. 
---
Horde is fun for awhile until you hit the limits. Dont pick up absolutely everything you see, your gonna have to decide what scrap is more valuable to keep. For example wood may only weigh a little, but I've seen people carrying hundreds of it, and with how common it is why? Instead of stockpiling lower tier materials keep a "par" of them and if you find an area that has tons of a particular resource make a note of it. So that way if you do end up needing hundreds of it you can always come back.
---
I agree its still a complete mess.. just was saying I am having fun playing it despite it still. even if it takes three attempts to log in lol. 
---
 Just turn on your mic. Talking to people is so much better. 
---
 I use the "come here' emote to give stuff away but just turn your mic on. Sticks and stones ... you know.
---
I thought every character got these. I had mine BEFORE I got the dirty ones. 
---
I put in 55 hours. The bad outweighs the good for me but glad you like it. 
---
Ironic consequence:  Gifting emote shows up... in the atom shop... for 1000 atoms
---
None of their other games are fun enough to focus on.
---
HA! It has not dude. 
---
My friend who was born in an abandon train station loves fallout boy and if this is true it would be a much needed lift to his otherwise sad and meaningless life.
---
Wait what? You mean I could have disposable time to be posting on subreddits? Wow, good thing you told me, I had no idea I could do that with my disposable time.
---
This is fine.
---
Yeah I pretty much just server hop there and a few other places. Just load in spawn the area, log out and repeat.
---
Welp, don't have to worry about scrapping it ever, then. :)
---
 You are wearing the gimp mask. ;) I sell em' but putting one on is not something I will do.
---
 No matched set, what is the world coming to?
---
"we promise to only sell cosmetics with no pay 2 win mechanics."
---
*sells cosmetics with pay 2 win mechanics*
---
"Thats not a big deal."
---
They lied and you're okay with that. 
---
None listed on the Gamepedia pages I usually pull up to track what mods I've learned or still can potentially learn...

As I said, the perfect patsy.

Is it just a different muzzle mod?
---
Oh we've given it a chance fam...  it's still garbage

&gt;Almost bug free
---
Join and at a minimum protect, or revive those who damaging the queen, but some hits in on her for the loot.  If you have a cryolator use it on her when she's on the ground.
---
The campaign for RDR2 is nothing short of an absolute masterpiece IMO. It's one of the best games I've played in my life and I've been playing video games for almost all 30 years of my life. 
---
given a lack of links or context, is this your idea that you are trying to pass off as a rumor? &gt;\_&gt;
---
Because it's not. He's convinced himself it is.
---
Source: I played up until a week ago. 
---
I’ve been playing in nuke zones more and I’m lvl 66. The servers outside of nuke zones have been much more stable. Inside of nuke zones, however haven’t been very good. 
---
Laggy, glitchy and very frustrating to say the least. 
---
No it wouldn't. Servers are one thing but no. It would not ruin the game. 
---
That was my favorite part. plus the "Awwww dude...." fading was a nice touch.
---
not really, there’s a lot to know haha
---
As long as you have decent dps you'll be fine. Even if you just tag the Queen and then spend the rest of the fight getting the scorched enemies off of the other players it would be a big help 
---
That's fair enough :)
---
You can use the cryolator against her? 
---
Its either: this game SUCKS (o hours playtime)
---
Or:THIS GAME SUCKS (450 hour playtime)
---
I'd love to hear your top 10. Honestly, I would. But no. It's not horseshit that he said that because you like it. I like the movie Ready 2 Rumble despite knowing it's complete dog shit. Doesn't make it less dog shit because I like it. 
---
 Feels good. Has since launch ... do not watch youtube and you'll be fine.
---
Currently I am playing with my lvl128 character in the forest. I am searching for interesting locations which I might have missed so far. Sometimes I go to Flatwoods and just walk around the town, remembering how lively it was at the release of the game. It feels really empty these days. However yesterday I met a lvl4 player there and dropped him a few stimpaks and a whiskey. He was very happy. And today I saw 2 new players exiting the vault and heading to the overseers camp. 
---
I keep 15 of each bulk in my stash and sell the rest, that leaves me with pretty good room for any few legendaries or extra other stuff besides junk in my stash, I found that to be successful for keeping enough of everything to build how much / when I want and to only need to farm the few more rare things when needing to craft or build something more unique.
---
Also, get lone wanderer under charisma as early as possible if you plan to be solo for a good amount of time
---
Thank you for your service
---
Red Dead is 100000x better than 76. Period. 
---
Get a team of really nice players 2 it makes the game a lot more fun. I have a team of 10 people and it just makes wondering the wastelands a whole lot of fun
---
Jesus lmao if there that much nevermind
---
If you see a movie in the theater for $15 do you get upset when someone rents it from Redbox later on for $2?  The day one experience is meant to be like seeing a movie in the theater, and if you see a bad movie it is money down the drain, but it happens.  I knew Destiny players who played for *hundreds of hours* who were pissed that a new player paid $60 instead of $140 for The Taken King, in complete ignorance of the extra gameplay they experienced for a year.  
---
Now, it sucks that Fallout 76 was on sale shortly after it released, so early adopters got less of that value, but the game was not alone.  Really well received games like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey and others were on sale shortly after release because of holiday sales.  I paid $99 for the gold edition of that game and could have paid $50 by just waiting a few weeks.
---
I’ve found some of those laying around in random homes. 
---
That's really sad. I wonder if u/Ladydevann or u/Valseek can give us an official response as to why.
---
How is it defined by the existing material objectively, outside of whether or not it is considered fun - which is subjective.
---
Again I ask - have you abandoned the conceit that a game can be objectively bad - and do you admit that it is entirely an individual opinion based on what a person sees as being fun?
---
How can a game be fun but not good if the point of a game is to be fun?
---
If higher level players are around then the game loads in   higher level mobs
---
Yes, it slows her down, and she changes color to appear frozen
---
So the game is overrated because a separate component isn't great? Nobody plays red Dead exclusively for online and nobody overrates the online. The campaign justifies all the praise it gets. The campaign is a better experience than everything in 76. Don't be ridiculous. 
---
To be fair, an extra 15/60 HP isn't a big deal to me, 60 is 20% of my Current HP, I do understand that this could be a stepping stone to larger P2W mechanics but I feel it's just a small bonus of the Armor during that week. 
---
It's like if every three months it was Mothman Season and the Mothman paint was on sale at 25% off and it gave you bonuses for that week (like +20% Sneak Speed and +10% to not being detected). 
---
Cheaper prices if you want it and a small bonus if you are wearing it. 
---
As long as the FatMan Paint doesn't give it +25% Damage forever, as that wouldn't e broken I'm happy with ATOM items increasing something for a week or two if you're wearing them, since it would help with RP and it's only a small benefit. 
---
 Get a Western Revolver with a Reflex Sight. Mine hits a 98 and takes care of all the trash and gives my my 20% speed buff.
---
 VATS is for babies.
---
From a vendor too

Ignorance. The word is ignorance.

i know that but even when im alone they spawn. and i server hop to see if its fixed

It was a dark and stormy night......another Dame just walked out on me cause she saw ive been using this .45 SMG, and trying to fake it was the shrouds real gun......im headed to the bar to figure out my next case.....getting Bethesda to make weapons i actually wana use. 
---
I don’t know exactly but even with a collection of melee I never leave home without my vampire axe. As long as I keep swinging I’m usually in good shape. 
---
I'm honestly curious which platform you're on if you didn't hit any game breaking bugs. Or perhaps sub hourly crash to desktop errors are not game breaking (not saying you got those, but that was my experience for a while after patch 5 I think).
---
Brand new i9-9700k, gtx 1070ti, 32gb RAM and a delightfully fast nvme boot drive. And a fresh build of Win 10 right before I got it for unrelated reasons. And it ran like an alpha even weeks into retail.
---
I still see loot circles in Whitesprings and prime fissure, though only a couple minutes in the latter if it's busy and now not on SBQ. Most of the CTD and server instance crashes are gone thankfully.
---
But we're 4 months and some change into one of the buggiest game launches I've seen in 37 years of gaming.
---
\^ This. Crowd control, specially of the damned creepy crawlies that get lost on the tall grass or the $£"%\^£$% bugs that fly right on your face will make you a welcome partner.
---
Said that do not CC everything, some of us need to keep Adrenaline up ;)
---
Also wondering the same thing 
---
I’m rifle specced and have it on a semi auto handmade, it’s nice and my hp doesn’t move as long as I got ammo and can keep persistent shots on a target, it’s also pretty powerful when used in combination with a stimpak
---
You say scorched creatures hate electricity? Explains why my energy guns deal damage to them.
---
I have a suppressor on one of mine. 
---
 Its a terrible gun. A well set up 10mm pistol is far better.
---
No they didn't.
---
They expected a game that "Just works." and it's still buggy after months now. You like the game and that's fine, but pretending like their aren't issues is just stupid as hell. 
---
If you have enforcer see if you can cripple her wing

I swear that at one time I scrapped a bunch of things, like maybe assault rifles, all at once. Could have been armor. And maybe it was glitchy or somehow could be exploited and they stopped it. I can imagine if dupers could replicate something 50 times and then scrap everyone one simultaneously, they'd immediately have all the mods. 
---
Is that what the head piece is really called? 
---
Where is the game cheap now?  Still $59.99 PC in the US... 
---
You remind me of the lizard man from star trek (gorn?). Anywho, love it and keep up the positive/fun posts.
---
I always recommend to newbies that they stay on the West side of the Map, and chase events, not following any of the quests that award weapons until level 50.
---
Chasing events gains XP through both the event completion and the higher levels of enemy exposure encountered in the event.
---
My bloodied does 200 dmg so thats good for me
---
Lol holy shit. Misgendering you would imply I had some way of knowing your gender in the first place. Would my statements mean anything different if I said woman instead of man? Grow up.
---
I’m well aware you can oneshot people. That’s completely separate from slap damage. You can’t oneshot people if slap damage is active. 
---
Lots of people are having a great time with the game and lots aren't. Hard for me to recommend the game at this point though. I'd say wait a month or two then check back in. I really do hope this game ages like a fine wine. I still have faith. 
---
Good suggestions, Thanks!
---
Why are you here?  To warn people not to play a game that you don't play, or like?
---
If you finish this quest you reduce the number of legendary robots that spawns in watoga afterwards
---
a deathclaw dropped one for me. random drop. but u havent seen anything until u have gotten a ghouls slayers gamma gun
---
I agree lol even with my rifleman build, my favourite weapon is glow sighted hunting rifle. I find scopes way too bulky and having to switch between close range and far range enemies is a pain when u got a scope. 
---
Nobody expected New Vegas 2. He's making excuses. No way people don't like the game due to glitches and just straight up not being that fun. No way. Has to be expecting new Vegas 2.
---
Same. And many people still refuse to accept that opinion/experience happening in this game. Whatever dude, I'm still playing and having fun. So who's really the idiot here? Me, who is enjoying his free time and decompressing by doing whatever catches my eye at that particular time? Or you, who has made it your mission to "inform" people that they are enjoying a "bad" product? Get a life. Btw, this is in no way directed towards people who have had a generally bad experience in game. I believe this does happen. Just not to the extent the echo chamber would lead everyone to believe. /rant
---
I’m not sure how often they trigger, I’ve never timed it, but it seems to happen about as often as settlements were attacked in FO4. I normally get around 200 xp for defending. The world events are the best, especially the power plants. Lots of enemies to farm. 
---
yeah, sometimes things stack but generally they don't
---
I didn’t even know that. Thanks for the info! 
---
I love how you claim to be legit but i look on your channel and you have 2 or 3 different  video tutorials on exploits and glitches for infinite xp and caps. Lol
---
Yeah, I stored my generator and ol Buffy is docile as a lamb.
---
I ran from her if that counts 
---
It would be nice if the developer chimes in with their reasoning behind this. My assumption was the insolvent stairs are attached to all foundations so animal Mobs can easily reach and attack walls/doors. 
---
Regardless the invisible stairs are gamebreaking, immersion breaking, and a bit annoying. Come up with better AI Bethesda. Don’t butcher our limited building blocks. 
---
Nice. I think i had one long time ago but sold it.
---
It's called research. The game is not good. Sorry. I have 50 hours in. It's not good. People say it's not good. People do research and find out it's not good. People don't buy it. Isn't that what the no pre-order mentality is about? Now people have to buy a game before deciding not to like it? Give me a break.
---
This is the most circle jerky game sub on reddit I swear. You guys are brainwashed. 
---
Have noticed it bugs out sometimes. Try joining a team then leaving the team and see if it changes. Sometimes works for me.
---
No, a game can be objectively bad. There are objectively bad games.
---
&gt;How can a game be fun but not good if the point of a game is to be fun?
---
If a person has fun stabbing themselves in the hand does that mean the knife game is a good game?
---
Research. The word is research. 
---
Problem is I routinely play fallout 1- 4 on a regular basis. 1 and 2 get played around once a year or two and new vegas still gets a playthrough once a year. 3 not so much but 4 still gets some playtime.
---
76, well after 50 hours I got bored. No story, no investment in the world. I played because it was fallout and I tried to enjoy it. Perhaps in another year or a couple more major patches the game will start to shine; however, it will be too little too late imo.
---
The potential was and is there but it remains to be seen if they are willing to make the needed changes in the requisite timeline to compete with the other team oriented multiplayer games coming.
---
it is a little bewildering we can have a nuclear reactor but no refrigerator
---
Wait, isn't Gamma Gun the one that does no DMG to Ghouls?
---
Lol if a movie was 2 bucks at redbox a week after I paid full price. Yeah I'd be pissed. Especially if I upgraded to the more expensive tickets. 
---
Chekhov's Ladder... and viewfinder
---
Wish I knew that
---
I need some help with the last part of I am become death quest and the end of belly of the beast quest (glass caverns). Can offer some caps for the help. Let me know I'll be online in about 1-2 hours
---
I have several legendary BP rifles for sale if you're on Xbox, from 1\* Vampires to 3\* TSE, and I'm very reasonable.
---
Like Grahm, Fair trade only.
---
That’s so they could devise a way to prevent people from using mods to cheat down the line.
---
Huh, maybe I'll do some farming
---
I'm not arguing with you about the campaign. I think it's overrated not sure why you want this argument so bad I think it's overrated it's my opinion. You aren't gonna change that 
---
Hell, I'll do you one better. 
---
I greatly enjoyed the first two Final Fantasy Dissidia games. When a third one came out for PS4, I bought it, downloaded it, and played for about an hour. That's the time it took to realize that it had none of what I enjoyed about the previous games, and that it just wasn't for me. I shrugged, sadly, and uninstalled. 
---
It would never, ever occur to me to then spend the next three months trolling Square Enix's twitter account or harassing and demeaning people for playing or liking the game. I just accept that not every game is for me and move on to something better-suited to my tastes. 
---
On now, next time will be Sunday 
---
He used Destiny’s second year update as an example as well.  Most movies are at Redbox within a year.  As for sales weeks after release, like I said, lots of newer games were on sale for the holidays.  It happens.
---
Not really. I've got like 10 of them from data turn-ins
---
Reddit - it’s where you go to for information!
---
On now, next time will be Sunday  butt_ermybr3ad 
---
I would love that actually, at least to see what you have. I certainly have the caps or trade. GT reznorkhan and I’ll be on this evening!
---
I've done over 400 hours of "research" so far. It leads me to believe that the word that fits his "2 friends" the best is in fact, ignorance. 
---
where does that drop?
---
Me and my friend have just started playing and a high lvl gave me a power armour chassi,  who ever you are thank you kindly
---
tried it once but forgot oof. ill try it again when i get on
---
Maybe they designed it where you have to find your own fun. Ever since I decided to recreate my character as Grognak when I found his axe I've been having a blast. Just running around cleaving baddies, while interacting with people, saying, "Grognak help!" "Grognak UNSTOPPABLE!" Or just yelling out the F4 quotes from taking psycho. It makes me look at the game in a whole different way.
---
That's sad. For real. Sad. 
---
Good advice, I’ll wait for them to be released in the future =)
---
Name one time a game was 50% off 5 days after release.
---
you can sometimes buy one at Harpers Ferry. Ive seen it. 
---
Inconceivable!
---
I do think the game should’ve come out in the state it’s in now at least. There was the beta so you could easily find out it was gonna be a buggy mess at launch, didn’t even have to play it, just go watch/read some reviews.
---
I hope your quest to change game studios so they release finished games works out. I support that cause. And on that note, time for half hour of ghoul killing before work!
---
What is the best to bulk up
---
The barrels for this weapon do not have the required attach point for muzzles: ap\_gun\_Muzzle "No Muzzle" \[KYWD:0002249C\]
---
Moreover there are no 'muzzle' mods for the 10mm SMG.
---
Regarding sights I can see two front sights, small and large, however these are part of a modcol with no specific priority so when a weapon drops or is crafted as far as I can see it can be either and cannot be modified, whichever front sight it 'manifests' you are stuck with it.
---
that would be cool if we could have a food dehydrator in camp to make mutfruit or other crops last longer and provide lower hunger 
---
Everybody, as it will probably be set up in such a way that you're gimping yourself if you don't prestige
---
Love this.  Typical.  “Looking for advice...  I don’t like that advice, you’re a dick.”  Gotta love Reddit.  
---
I assisted a level 3 Wednesday. Gave him supplies, followed him around helping. Was fun
---
I dont know if you know this but if your starving and thirsty you do more damage. I dunno why. 
---
I saw one once and it disapeared from existance befare i could hit it
---
My camp is a 7-story, 3 by 3 closed tower, no entrance at the bottom, I travel into it. Not exactly hospitable, I know, I like my privacy and play alone. My favorite part about it is that enemies sometimes spawn inside my tower, always on the 3rd floor, when I am up top. They dont work their way up to me, they just break all the walls on the 3rd floor.
---
If high level players were there recently, that can also affect the level of spawns.
---
i have tested it with a vats/commando build and a limb dmg weapon ages ago (patch 4 or so). on vats i had crippled both wings and she  did starts flying again (yes after her legendary heal effect too) did they fix that and we CAN stun her ass down to the ground???
---
You also think 76 is better so that's why you don't want to argue lol. 
---
We all have that one buddy, that stayed on the server long after everyone else said they were gonna log off, that ended up spending the next 3 or 4 hours crawling somewhere with two broken legs.  ;)
---
They always run away from me and have voice chat off so I can't get them to stop lol.
---
Previous Fallout games, and I refer mainly to 3 &amp; 4, had a clear main story (and with NPCs to support the narrative, sure...), I played through and enjoyed, but what I enjoyed most were the countless later play-throughs where I roleplayed, maybe didn’t follow the main story, even modded to escape it... just playing and creating my own stories in the world. It has honestly surprised me that there hasn’t been the same adoption in 76, or at least that hasn’t been widely spoken about on forums and channels.
---
Didn’t bother with the “EDIT:” of your title, I see.  Classy.  
---
Case in point.
---
yeah i know but my level ghouls have never spawned
---
Does Cannibal actually work now?
---
Particularly as the game contains nuclear material... 
---
except they keep unnerfing it everytime they bug fix something. they will end up just making it so nothing spawns loot there eventually. 
---
Because alot of high lvls try to grief lower lvls, im a lvl 10 and its fuking annoying when your trying to learn the game and a lvl  200 comes over and starts to pound on you
---
I know it does do alot of damage but its fuking annoying when you just trying to go bout your business 
---
I literally did last night, it is why I have the instigating sniper rifle in the first place.  
---
It's been pretty cheap since the week after everyone spent their 60 bucks on it. 
---
 LOL. My Nocturnal Combat Knife hits at 190 at night. Its extra fast too.
---
 If all you are getting is 200 for being near death all the time I might rethink my build.
---
If they let me re do main quests I'd consider it
---
Why did you make a video? I'm assuming you didn't record this after the ban. So why?
---
It's bullshit plain and simple. This narrative that the game is secretly amazing is just the next false narrative die hard fans are spinning. 
---
The game is fun. The game can be decent but it had crippling bugs and some poor design decisions. A game can be enjoyed even if it's mediocre over all... but people here seem desperate to act like the people wary of the game are idiots.
---
I think melee base is still the best damage build. For ranged you depend on crits and stealth hits to deal massive damage. Melee does good chunks of damage every swing. That being said, yeah ranged builds can still be very viable with the right build, it's just harder to get a ranged build together then to get a melee build together.
---
When was it broken?
---
 I think Marine Tactical Helmet but I could be wrong. I'll fire the game up in a while and look.
---
The Nuka Cola variant.
---
I don't use the Sentinels armor myself, but reserve it for trade to get the Weight Reduction pieces I want, my current configuration makes me able to carry more out of PA than I can in my T60, but still a little less than the Excavator.
---
If I didn't lose my Armor perks when using a hazmat Suit, I would ditch the PA altogether, I only use it for Blast Zones, or the occasional jet pack long Jump/Drop.
---
But you don’t support that cause do you. Because you didn’t refund in the beta.
---
It's a junk item in the game. Fairly rare, but i've seen them about a dozen times in 160+ levels.
---
Where is your camp?
---
Month or so ago.  It just never worked for me.  And heard some other comment that after on of the late 2018 patches it was broken. So I bailed on that perk.  Will have to give it a shot again.  Also carnivore and would be nice to to eat and run.  
---
Already did, I wish I listened to the haters before spending money.
---
I think Marine Tactical Helmet but I could be wrong. I'll fire the game up in a while and look.
---
It depends on what you want to do in the game. Personally, I like to build, so I spend most of my caps on building plans
---
For every one of you there are 5 a-holes.  
---
I had the day off work and wanted to play a bit. I'm level 50. Had a level 280 show up, and the spawns jumped in level. Before I knew what happened, dead. Go back and bag gone. So I left the area. 2 minutes later, same a-hole shows up on the other side of the map.  
---
So I quit and tried to get another server.  
---
 Somehow after 3 tries he was still there.  
---
Day ruined.  
---
I hope he enjoyed the piddly loot.
---
Listen partner.  There is nothing shameful in admitting that you are wrong.  Putting up wild straw men isn't going to save you.
---
You either have a criteria for establishing objectively what is a good game or you don't.
---
If you can show me that there is an objective way of determining the quality of game outside of whether or not it is fun I would be overjoyed to hear it. 
---
But as far as I can tell the purpose of games is to enable enjoyable play.  
---
I don't take it personally as you previously posited - in fact I feel bad that your identity is so strongly tied to the need to be 'right' about the objective quality of a toy.  
---
I ask again: What objective qualities - if such qualities exist - determine whether or not a game is a good game - outside of the quality of the game which allows it to be subjectively enjoyed as a fun experience?
---
How do you calculate that?  I've seen a lot of folks say they do xxx damage per hit but I can't figure out how they are seeing that.
---
Thanks for the caps
---
I feel you. 😒 I feel the same way.
---
Sent a friend request 👍
---
what armor set/outfit is this? 
---
Sentinel is weird though right?  It can be combined with other legendary affects?   I find this odd/interesting/confusing. 
---
Cavalier also?
---
Dude, wtf? Calling something overrated or not is an *opinion*. r/Shaggyotis has a right to their opinion, just as you have the right to yours. Their opinion is no more false or correct than yours. Please stop acting like your opinion is superior just because it's yours.
---
stacking double damage. like most games each 2x doubles from the last
---
I cant see any weapons, cause they are all fucking broken, and I dont have any junk to repair it. Also I got so radiated that I had less than a fifth of my health bar. I'm slowly getting back up, I need to find a place to loot for weapon materials in piece.
---
-Crowley
---
Just because they're the best in something doesn't mean they aren't the worst in other things. Say for example you wanted the best of a soldier, so you got some guy straight out of the war campaign for the vault, but that guy also experienced things so traumatizing that it left him mentally disturbed.
---
The 290 character is the one I was talking about. The fact that he had no bounty proves my point. If he would have shot the guy first he would have had at least a 10 cap bounty.
---
research is defined as:
---
"the systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions."
---
This is hardly a matter of facts and all a matter of opinion. Your opinion states the game is not good. I disagree. I'm enjoying my time in West Virginia. If a group of people hate something and they raise hell about it, there's no reason for you to follow suit. Have your own opinion.
---
Yep, neither is more powerful then the other. They jsut have different situations. And both laugh at anyone trying to use a laser. 
---
Too much math. Me swing axe good. 
---
Pumpkin grenades, you say... 
---
200 dmg on a full auto smg is pretty effing good you can ask anyone and yes i have bloodied grogs axe with over 1k dmg so thats not a problem
---
Hey km making the same build
---
Melee, pistol but  very speedy. I'm having fun
---
Everywhere all the time 
---
You'd expect Flatwoods to be a source of alien blasters and or legendary alien blasters, but nope. :(
---
Please let me put a live grenade in the gift bag too that would be great fun 
---
Me too, GT= Medieval Paul
---
I'll message you on XBL when I get on this evening
---
Oh, that's not creepy at all. I think you need ALL THE TURRETS!
---
How many people need to prove you wrong before you give up?
---
Yeah, that Black Friday price drop was a real punch to the gut to everyone that paid full retail at the release just *two weeks* earlier. Completely killed my desire to buy *any* future Bethesda games as pre-order or on Day One for full price.
---
Awesome looking forward to it!
---
targets hit with them take 2x damage for 5 seconds. you see people throwing them at the SBQ from time to time. You get them from the pumpkin house daily. 
---
Had a monster drop a Bone Club the other day. Was only lvl 15 and not legendary though. If it was higher level, probably would have kept it. Seemed somewhat decent.
---
You swing ax, I shoot gun. We both kill bat. 
---
Distant thunder event
---
So, lemme get this straight. People criticize the game, yet don't tell you you shouldn't like it or have fun with it, they're just providing their opinion about it, and you somehow interpret it as 'oh man they're so angry that i'm having FUN'? 
---
the lack of NPC \*is\* story. it's story driven narrative. 100% bethesda will introduce NPCs down the road. you'll get it if you play the game and follow the story.
---
Well, I enjoyed it even during and after beta so I’m an outlier. I expected bugs and wanted to play it anyway, so I wasn’t shocked that they were there. I think Bethesda got a good enough rattling of their cage from f76 launch regardless of whether I personally refunded or not. Hope they learn from this going forward.
---
That said, if you refunded during beta, why are you still wasting your time trying to convert people who enjoy this game now?
---
There are a few arguments for the opposite though. Between setting an industry precedence for selling early alpha or incomplete builds to disenfranchised fans from the FO1/2 era.
---
Let's not lose sight of proper arguments.
---
Anytime
---
Bloodied furious swing speed, adrenal twisted muscles would probably get him there
---
Ah. Not as fun name. But thanks! 
---
Nah. It'd go away after a day or so. Permanently.
---

---
Here you go! Happy hunting! 
---
Same same. Enjoying it even more than Anthem atm. 
---
I play on xbox.  When the game was first released I crashed maybe once every hour or two.  However, I have almost exclusively played solo the entire time and from talking with other players it sounded as if teaming up actually exacerbated the bugs and glitches.  For once in my life my introversion may have finally paid off haha
---
Did you see it?  Maybe he was an Unyielding melee build with a 3* legendary Bloodied Buzz Blade?
---
 Cool. Its not a build I like much is all. 
---
My sniper at low HP can pull off 975 base damage with my bloodied lever action. A sneak attack will hit for 2437. That's 4874 if it's a crit. This is why I laugh when someone says melee is op, or the only viable build.
---
Just lower the expectations. Don't expect some grand adventure on the level of the single player games. I think of it more as a proper survival game like 7 days to die or something, with the fallout gameplay that I like.
---
That’s why I got confused! Ha, that’s it. Thanks bro.
---
Well, time to pack it up everyone. Time to shut down the Oscars, time to call closing on the review business, time to do away with the notion of quality. Because if I can watch a film, eat a meal, sleep in a bed, then who cares about any metrics.
---
Just make sure on your way out you pick up a copy of Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing.
---
That level of hyperfocus is more a sign of a mental issue than enjoying a game that YouTube reviewers don't...
---
Sneaky rifle should be enough to take down cargo bots.  Seem to do OK with mine.
---
you can get a higher damage with a pumpkin grenade added into that. I am capped at the 4.75 do to my instigating effect but you can get way higher. 
---
He does have low health but jeez how much damage can it do
---
 Its changed but I got a few out of the train car west of Watoga Station.
---
Found a lvl 45 one along highway 65 (near the 65 marker on the map) while farming random events for the different costume plans. Has a mod on it that causes bleeding damage but can't see the name of the mod. 
---
I do play and follow the story, and really enjoy the game! That wasn’t a criticism but a comparison to previous titles in the series, or rather the reviews of FO76 that make comparisons without considering players’ enjoyment beyond and outside of main story.
---
I believe its when you put a generator in your Camp. They're probably sensitive to the frequency
---
A lot of grenades. You can toss them up and try to time the explosion to be near the cargo-bot.
---
First person yes lol. I drew some spiders and dogs before. Closest things to people. Mainly did some line art of buildings trying to learn perspective. 
---
Well, a full armor set will give +15 to every stat when they are at low health.  So 15+15 STR to start with.  Plus the Bloodied increasing your weapon's damage, and then the mutations for melee damage and low health boosts.  It stacks up fast.
---
I got the Helmet for T-51b and T-60 from Distant Thunder (ONCE each out of several dozen completions). And the Left Arm from a Savage Divide Treasure Map (Once out of ~40 SD Treasure Maps).
---
Jesus
---
Racist towards Super Mutants that are trying to rip off my arms because they think its fun and feral ghouls that literally cant help but try to eat me? 
---
Or are we talking about the super weapon synths, who were never once actually proven to be "sentient"?
---
Also, because they are a military run organization doesn't make them facist. 
---
I bet you think they are "nazis" too?
---
That's lazy thinking at it's best. 
---
At least he didn't bring the probe with him
---
That’s very true! 
---
 Umm My Anti Armor one hits at about 50 when repaired to 200%. That's insane damage when you touch something with it. Does in Gutsys really well. ;)
---
Man cave is like Tony Stark's.  Cars, equipment, battle station, consoles for normies that hang out and lots of swag from Fallout.  I'll never play or allow F76 played there.  It is like what Disney did to Star Wars.  Deplorable.
---
It's almost like some people don't understand what a sandbox style game is and that you have to make your own fun after a point...
---
I had a level 15 Quad Double-barreled shotgun (8 Shots per 1 reload fires as fast as you can pull the trigger) and it took me 3 days to even find someone to try and give it to. Found a Level 13 in Flatwoods when i was doing my vendor runs and finally was able to offload it.
---
So you think Bethesda got their cage rattled and hope they learn from it because of what other people did? You want better products but you want other people to demand it so you can continue to enjoy the mediocre products? I’d be more than happy for Bethesda to completely screw up TES6 and Starfield so that people actually have to put their money where their mouth is, and either keep buying crap and being served more crap, or stop buying crap.
---
Your buzzsaw ? 
---
Something is definitely fucky with the new AR... I found what you said seems to be true (though it may be a visual bug) but the inverse happens also.  If you log in with low hp and then heal to 100% it REDUCES damage too... my gauss went from 217 damage to 68.  Had to log back in to fix it.  
---
Yeah dog, I paid full price for this and they dropped the price two weeks later. Fuck Bethesda.
---
There's also Tenderizer, Adrenaline, Nerd Rage and a couple of other multipliers that I haven't even factored in that gives me crazy damage output when they are all procing together. 
---
You got some stupid friends on discord. But it's good to have a friend to play. Personally I live somewhere where no one plays something unless it's really popular(Fortnite, League, PUBG) or streamed a lot(Sea of Thieves), but they also don't care about other games because they don't read about new games. I only met another Greek after 300+ hours of playing it. Thankfully I found other friends from other countries that are really fun and amazing people.
---
Several Weapons and Armor types top out at 45.
---
From my perspective, honestly I've spent ~90% of my 400+ hours in game solo. Now there are certain things that playing with others makes more fun/achievable. But it's not necessary at all. In fact you may see those hours I posted and say "jeez I'll bet you're lvl 250+". Nope. I enjoy slow playing and doing whatever catches my eye in the moment. Whether that be exploring the map, or farming for materials, or just messing with my base. I'm "only" lvl 127 iirc, and given the amount of time spent playing I consider that to be kinda low. At a dollar spent to time enjoyed ratio, I consider myself waaaaay ahead to put it bluntly.
---
Correlation is not causation. 
---
 Yeah the Mr Handy Buzz Saw one. 
---
I’m gonna come buy more violet flux if you still got some
---
Live free or die
---
Aim for a thruster. 
---
im getting it as soon as I see it 35.00 or so. Im guessing there will be seom good deals whenever they release the first major dlc for it.
---
Strong kill bat, eat human later
---
I think your issue is that you think there’s one solution to any problem.
---
I’m pretty sure both Starfield and TES6 will have hilarious bugs at launch, just like Skyrim and Fallout 4 did. And I’ll be there day one.
---
Be the change you want to see in the world and don’t preorder. I don’t really give a crap either way, I’m just out to have a fun time and enjoy myself, not fool myself into thinking my one person’s input will affect the gaming industry...hahaha
---
The issue is that with sniping, if you miss or fail to kill the thing on your first shot, or the game just decides that that Deathclaw 5 miles away is now aware of you, your DPS takes a nose dive.
---
With melee, if you miss your first swing, you just swing again. Nothing changes. Melee is super easy, and super forgiving. It's related to "dominant strategy" in game-design and it generally means the balance is very, VERY off.
---
I didn't. I just happened upon it and this was all I knew about it... ima starve my guy when i get home
---
So this is another misunderstanding of game mechanics on your behalf. Okay.
---
You don’t get a bounty just for shooting a player. *that player* gets the OPPORTUNITY for a *reward* if they manage to kill you (which is exactly what the screenshot shows, the reward). You get a bounty for damaging camp/workshop items or *killing* another player who didn’t fight back.  
---
Oh and i would suggest makeshift plumber. Yeah it got nerfed but with all the 38 ammo available from mutants and scorched an automatic pipe pistol is a good day to day. For extra versatility i put on a long barrel but then a bayonet with basher perk. Bashing is a bit underwhelming but you can unload a clip then poke em once or twice to finish them off.
---
I think that the weight you carry on you also factors in to that, so its not just 800+800, might be less depending how much your character carries
---
Bravo.
---
You just earned me odd looks from my coworkers. 
---
Played both and really like both but RDRO doesn’t have “MASSIVE” content.
---
Comparing it to Gta &amp; RDR2, you can’t own property, can’t change your appearance, can’t gamble with poker/blackjack, can’t complete challenges for the trapper, can’t rob a train/stagecoach/bank, can’t enter theatres, can’t change your appearance, can’t make a new character, can’t go passive.
---
It’s fun with friends, but all you can do are a handful of different missions and hunt animals that don’t even give you special rewards. There’s nothing to work towards except overpriced mediocre guns/ clothes. 
---
It gets old fast. Fallout on the other hand has been entertaining since day one (for better or worse) and has been patched more than just once.
---
People hate on fallout because it’s buggy. People hate on RDRO because it’s boring.
---
It's an opinion business.  People read reviews to be entertained and to inform their own opinions.
---
However your straw man and ad hominem attacks have not distracted me from the point.
---
You claimed that there is an objective standard which determines what separates a good game from a bad game - outside of the qualities which allow the game to be subjectively enjoyed.
---
All you need to do is describe that standard.  Saying that you compare it to other games does not define the qualities - all it does is defer to opinions on previous titles.
---
So what is it?  What is the objective standard for determining the quality of a game?  Or isn't there one? 
---
Very much so from my personal experience. . . But mileage may vary. All in all the disconnect complaints as a whole around here seem to few and far between these days from what I can tell. Only time I was ever hit real hard with the disc. though was back in late Dec.-early Jan. I would imagine the duping ban hammer plays a large role in the added stability of things of late. 
---
Be very careful buying keys of G2A. They are *not* a legit reseller and are just a marketplace, so you really have zero guarantee that the key you're buying is legit. Yes, a lot of the time it's a legit key, but it is very possible to get scammed.
---
Note: I'm not saying you are *going* to be scammed, just that it's not a bad idea to take precautions like using Paypal or a credit card with fraud protection to give you a bit of extra insurance just in case you luck out and it is a scam.
---
Nothing better to do that shit on people who like the game, another angry kid
---
For me Todd said it was going to be terrible at launch. That's what I expected. So I pushed through the bs and I am enjoying it immensely. I am ready for the new content updates. However of they did the launch and called it "early access" and release the game at the start of Wild Appalacia. I think it would have pissed less people off.
---
It certainly isn't visual. One shoting scorch beasts with a black powder rifle (non instagating)
---
 I don't actually know as I have X0-1, but Phoenix has stacks of PA plans.
---
Not to be an asshole, but based on your previous misunderstandings and logical failings elsewhere in this thread, I’m don’t believe you without a WHOLE lot of supporting evidence. I believe you killed someone. I very much doubt you oneshot them through slap damage. 
---
How did you know the level 40s had high end weapons? Did you get a chance to look through their inventory? Something seems fishy about this whole story.
---
There's a few, just no humans
---
I want to be able to put plates and forks down in my kitchen and possibly nukacolas in my nukacola machine! 
---
It works for me now so I guess they fixed it :)
---
Oh yea, how much? On different server tho
---
All the more reason to set this up. There could be an opposing group fighting for anarchy. Could set up some excellent conflicts.
---
The account limit isn't 1500. It's your character's carry weight plus 1500. That's how they describe it unless they changed it.
---
Possibly..look at far harbor
---
Like 20-30
---
my biggest problem with it is the ammo drain, the enclve terminal usually gives me level 25 targets and those things are huge bullet sponges for me
---
I use an anti armor lever action on my stealth sniper. It'll be down in 20-30 shots.
---
awesome!!!! this is the fo76 I love.
---
I have a bloodied Mr handy buzz saw blade. Fully repaired with all the armour and perks of does 356 ballistic and 118 energy damage. It wrecks scorchbeasts
---
Marine tactical helmet /marine wetsuit/ leather armor 
---
Just because you don't like the game doesn't mean it's a bad game.  It might just mean you have bad taste in games actually.
---
Are you sure you have to cumulate the multiplication? The vats crits, stealth and weak points don't double only the base dmg of the weapon? 
---
It was temporary (6 days). You could get 2 ingame so the only advantage was for 3 or 4 unique players. It didnt apply if you wore pa. It was a shitty stepping stone to pay 2 win.
---
I love your response lol 
---
will have to try that, sounds like a good alternative to using a rifle because it takes way too much ammo to take a bot down
---
I tend to avoid spontaneous trades. People always want the gear I’m using and get mad I don’t want to sell it. 
---
Having a mic does make it easier to answer your question. 
---
I've been playing F076 since beta also. I went through phases. At first it was great fun with buddies, in the beta it was 'well glitches are expected" etc. Then we played for weeks with game breaking glitches, I broke a mouse in anger , I Lost weapons and got griefed and couldn't place my camp and couldnt get out of my PA and couldn't connect to my buddies etc etc the list is very long as you well know. I kept playing. I just kept playing and one day it hit me. 
---
This game is brilliant. It might not fit in the lore correctly but it's addictive and it's brilliant and if they would just bring more content. They need to start rollling out new content toot sweet. I'm level 267 and people are gunning for me due to my level and they need those PVP servers and open the vaults. 
---
It seems a fake story. A boring story at that as well 
---
I got mine for a couple thousand from someone on Reddit... Ask around 
---
I wasnt. I probably had rad worms at the time from the dogs. I just wanted to do anything but melee and this was a godsend as I can't find any rifles with a mod that isn't zealots
---
Im adding you all on psn. Ill just hang out with your gang lol
---
Psn:  paulofg1980
---
I've been playing since launch on and off (registered addict of Siege) and have almost 100 hours I think and I just reached lvl 35. Yet I am having so much damn fun just exploring and searching for anything I can find. Also should add I've experienced very little bugs, and the only major bug was a few weeks ago my game froze and when I restarted my PC, the game deleted itself so I had to reinstall.
---
[deleted]
---
I can confirm that stash space does not factor in.
---
I have a mule with a full stash + around 1600 lb and she can still pick up food/drinks. 
---
If the stash would factor in I would have to either shift a large amount of stuff or watch her slowly die. 
---
As I said, the perfect patsy. Imagine how happy the directors would be to know that there is an entire contingent of players prepared to buy a game regardless of quality because ‘hey, it’s not like me *not* buying it will make a difference’.
---
Ammo hasn't been an issue with me since I started using my Lever Action for most everything trash these days.  It uses relatively little ammo.  I'm almost always floating at about 9000 .45s  Super Duper and Ammosmith and I just craft ammo a couple times a week for it.
---
Take out the four prop things on the sides and it just sits there waiting for you to kill it.  The Vertibots drop quickly, I usually take out each one's engines first.
---
I'd imagine that with melee main, you would use even less ammo.
---
I dont judge people for playing games thats just childish lol. I might try it if its free tho
---
Im going to have to incoperate this into my base, I made a 7 story tower outside Watonga and placed all the crafting benches on the edga so after someone uses them, they fall to their death lol
---
what about the non feral ghouls?
---
I found the plan in one of the creeks near the SBQ. 
---
In the same day I got a bone club and a bone something else (can’t remember). One was level 40 the other was 25. 
---
The whole price dropping is still what is getting on my nerves. They should have never charged that much money then in the first place if they dropped it so fast.
---
Thanks again. Out of violt now. Lol
---
 My daggers are far too much fun. My Nocturnal hits at 190 with extra speed and AP. 
---
 Stabby stabby.
---
Just off the top of my head, in no particular order, I'd probably say Deus Ex (original), Quake, Half-Life, World of Warcraft, Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption (the first one), Bioshock, Civilization series, maybe a couple of others that I'm missing.  I've enjoyed FO76 equally as much as most of them, though Witcher 3 and Half Life are right up there at the top. 
---
Not a on a 10mm smg you don't 
---
Sounds like it. Yea I think I did the math and it would be 60+ days if doing in one char and closer to 20 with3 characters.
---
Some of my friends dont even get the daily anymore.
---
Had this one drop and modded it.
---
[https://imgur.com/NwbzmsF](https://imgur.com/NwbzmsF)
---
A bloodied, adrenal reaction build would make it op
---
Not a problem I’m always glad to help and to buy
---
I'll take the downvotes. I take every bag I see. You want your stuff back you can ask, but otherwise I'm keeping it.
---
Hopefully decorating with our stash items is as plain and simple as they've made it seem. I'll be pissed if thisv translates to say "only a small group of items is what they meant" 
---
Let the camp chaos begin, Bethesda! 
---
Thought they gave up on the lore in this game.
---
I paid $60 for it and got value for my money with my level 190 character. I don't think it's a bad game, but it's definitely not beyond mediocre and most definitely way below the quality expected from a $60 game from a large publisher like Bethesda Softworks.  
---
The real problem ain't even the game or the haters. It's people like you, the shills.
---
I been collecting magazines for the mag rack.
---
Also they need an emote for “thanks for participating in my trap base while I roast/missile/launch your ass off the top of my base.”
---
The in game community is one of the best things in this game for sure
---
I play with my alt now more than my main character 
---
I said F all that and just paid 3k for the whole suit on the trade subs.
---
Come to the DarkSide.
---
Same. If you got something good for sale. Fyi, I can also make serums. Well about half right now. 
---
Steel. Steel kills me. Every once in a while I go in to the stash and toss out several thousand steel. So I can collect more.
---
It used to add a lot of damage before the nerf. I would keep it on and maxed out. After the nerf the damage addition is so minimal that you might be better off using the points you were going to use for that perk somewhere else. If you have it, equip it and check your weapon damage. Then unequal it and check. Its not a huge difference like it used to be. Just my two cents. 
---
Lame
---
Got to say i found a Level 50 3\* instigating switchblade with the 40% faster perk and stabby stabby indeed!!! It's insane!! I can just run through hoards like a knife through butter, and the thing has never needed repairing yet either!!! 
---
I've had bone clubs drop several times. They were all low level though. I got no mods by scrapping them. 
---
I hv a 2se hm and leveraction.  I run gun Smith 3 but the leveraction still breaks crazy fast.  Thinking of running rank 3 demo expert instead of gunsmith at least while using my hm. Atm i have no demo experts though. 
---
Imagine taking that on the mini golf course I have to make one.
---
I'll just leave this here:
---
"All new rendering, lighting and landscape technology, it allows us to have sixteen times the detail, and even view distant weather systems across the map.” - Todd Howard
---
I never thought about that. I will say though by massive I was thinking about all the game modes you can do, as well as the missions and side stuff (i.e. fishing, hunting).
---
In fallout (I like FO76, dont much like RDO) theres building, quests, and events. Not a whole lot of game modes
---
 " which is more than any other Cunt claiming innocence has done "
---
The word "other" there pretty much sums up this whole thread and explains why nobody gives a shit.
---
 Repair it to 200% for much extra goodness. The faster the weapon the better that works.
---
Biggest mistake I made - around level 24 I went to Whitespring. DO NOT GO HERE. Not only is it a buggy mess, but it can also mess=up your adventure exploring the map and leveling as Bethesda intended.
---
See, for me, Whitespring gave me some amazing legendary weapons and armor - that I could not wear until level 40+ ..which made me focus on leveling as I wanted to use my new shiny stuff (and there were bugs then that caused you to make 3-5 levels during nuke events in Whitesprings, so it was relatively easy). Next thing I knew, I was a high level with awesome gear going back to the story quest.... and everything in the storyline (and the story locations) was too easy.
---
So... stay away from Whitespring and the lure of shiny legendaries!
---
Oh, and what's the fuss about? A few posts recently have been from new players saying this game is great, why all the hate! and they reap in the Karma. 
---
Understand, There are not any big issues with the game at low levels... the older complaints from low level players came with the initial buggy release. 
---
Problems come later, and hopefully will be solved by the time you get high level. 
---
Early on the game is very rich - enjoy it!
---
It depends on the level of the first person in the area.  And the level of the area you are in.  Most of the stuff in the Forest area (green area around Flatwoods) you won't find much beyond level 6 enemies.  You start going East, and you will enter areas that are level 25+, but will spawn level 60+ enemies if high level people enter.
---
If you want in between, head South, to the Mining areas in the Ash Heap.  Those areas tend to have lots of level 20-30 enemies.  And North to the Toxic Valley, as that area seems to cap around level 25-30.
---
Sold out of the violet. Sorry.
---
I think they despawn after a certain amount of time , unless you’re dropping these bags outside vault 76 I’d say you’re just burning mats.
---
Sold out of the violet, sorry
---
stop using a massive scope which i'm assuming your using. i can do 5shots with recon scope or full clip with reflex sight and still have ap left
---
Instigating dragon will take down the cargo bot in one shot. That's what I use.
---
Once you leave the world, your bag disappears into the abyss. Just tested the theory in a team. 
---
I would suggest looking through the perk cards online n planning out a character build. Also don’t waste perk points on maxing out perk cards initially as you’ll get better damage stats unlocking say “gunslinger” , “expert gunslinger” n “master gunslinger”. Also at the moment most weight reduction perks are located in strength as well as all the melee cards n strength maxs out at 15 points. So you’ll have to choose which perks you really need for your specific build. Also like people have said be careful about carrying too much weight. Heavy items hide in your inventory all the time, gunpowder for example has a weight to it n since it’s located in the Miscellaneous tab of your pip boy most new players don’t realize how much they are carrying around with them. Other than that it’s online fallout walk around n explore the world, join some events, build some camps, if a high level player is trying to get your attention n spamming the heart emote look for a paper bag on the ground near them these people are usually bestowing a gift of plans, weapons n or materials to you. Just respond with a heart emote. 
---
Sold out of violet. Got plenty of fluesent
---
Lol, you'll be alright dude.
---
&gt; That's 4874 if it's a crit. This is why I laugh when someone says melee is op, or the only viable build.
---
If I had a dollar for every "haha! But my super specific ranged build that just so happens to VATS stealth crit based which totally no one else had any idea could be good also make big number! Because having one niche ranged build that can actually compete means ranged super good too!" post...
---
[I know that feeling](https://i.imgur.com/Q5mA60N.gifv)
---
And I’m pretty sure it doesn’t tell you that you can’t stack cards. I didn’t realise and now have a bandolier perk card just wasting space 
---
I believe putting items in public containers, like suitcases, sacks, last longer; paper bags disappear rather quickly.
---
Where is the ash heap? I'm lvl 20 and haven't found a new place to grind for decent exp. 
---
I feel like that doesn't even matter one bit.  No Man's Sky lied about literally everything.. and they convinced you there was something amazing at the center of the galaxy and it was just another god damn galaxy.
---
Oh and even then rogue junk nodes produce much faster than workshops for some reason.
---
Only have crimson now. Yellowcake and violet went fast
---
We're just going to have to agree to disagree and wait for the person from the other thread to reply if he was using the crits and instigating sniper rifle thst does enough burst to bypass the slap damage.
---
There are tons of other ways to bypass the slap damage anyways, gamma gun, radium rifle, mini nukes, etc.
---
No, there’s an entire contingent of players prepared to but a game because they love all their previous games despite having lots of bugs and messy releases.
---
But wanted to thank you, just had a great bit of fun before work exploring and killing super mutants! Now I’m in a good mood for the day. Wouldn’t have happened without your help!
---
Slave collar on the neck and holster a tesla rifle will give you a blinking red and a blue glow
---
I’m glad we are in the same boat, friend
---
High end, as in plasma turret, gauss rifle.  
---
Sorry, why is that fishy?
---
I'm impressed. 
---
You knew a ban wave was coming so did a "detailed" inventory video....
---
Smooth moves not showing the paper bag you dropped with all your other "legit" stuff in it 
---
I'm gonna go ahead and assume that's what you did.
---
Its where Welch is, directly south of Charleston.
---
I think this is the way to go. I like to use suitcases at train stations
---
I remember when my friends and I were in our mid-teens, we went to the water park in Toxic Valley.  Spent a good 20+ minutes looting and clearing the area.  We were new, so we were running low on supplies, going around finishing up our looting and getting ready to leave.
---
A level 80+ shows up at the front gate.  Every single scorched respawns instantly, and they are now max level for the area.  We were getting blasted from all sides as they all came running to us.
---
We were low on ammo, weapons, and supplies.  We had no choice but to run as fast as our overcumbered legs could take us.  No Excavator power armors yet to assist.
---
Now that we are levels 60-90, there really is no danger to enemies respawning on us.  In fact we love it a lot of times cause it means we get another Boss/Legendary for places like Harper's Ferry.
---
But it is really deadly for new players.
---
Yeah sorry, i repaired it to 200% when i found it and it's still at about 150% 3 weeks later lol
---
Add Martial Artist to the case and i feel like i'm just poking everything at the speed of light and most things drop dead at a touch.
---
Or he just dropped a paper bag full of stuff, which he "forgot" to show in video.
---
Ha! I had no idea you could mod those. Time to scrap a bunch
---
Wtf are you going on about?
---
suppressors save lives.
---
He didn't. He already had them. Just dropped em all of screen, fimed, picked the bag back up.
---
Good question - I'm 99% solo player but I use the area mic all the time just for this type of thing. It is soooo much easier to just chat up the other guy when trading. 
---
bat tastes better. 
---
The golf clubs are hilarious
---
Are you still wearing the uniform you got before being able to do the boot camp drills?  Did you log out after starting the boot camp stuff, but before finishing it?
---
There is a half dozen ways to bypass slap damage, gamma gun, radium rifle, mini nukes, exploding cars, etc. It's up to you if you believe it or not. My PvP character has no problem killing people through slap damage in only 1 or 2 hits.
---
Yeah. low health builds are insane but balanced as you are a glass canon who will die the moment some one sneezes on you. 
---
Barrels I have learned are Stabilized Short, Stabilized Stub, True Short, Aligned Short, and Aligned Long (which is what I use).  No sights. 
---
Yeah, I do this almost every time I log in. I power up the plant, and then I take over the workshop and let the fusion core generator do it's thing while I play for an hour or two, checking back every so often.
---
I've rarely run into PvP trouble with it.
---
What I really love about this game so far right there \^\^\^\^\^
---
Exactly. My arena, my rules! But in reality it was more like I'll just let them fight until they get bored and after losing 3 rounds, the one with the losing streak admitted defeat and said its enough for him. 
---
Just get any shotgun with a maxed out enforcer perk card if you the points. Take out the four thrusters in seconds. Then it's just a matter of shooting a stationary target.
---
I agree that no mans sky lied worse, but I'm not sure that means much. 
---
Your basically saying that the guys who stand out in video game history as telling the most lies about a game pre release told more lies then Bethesda did about fallout 76. It's not exactly a stellar endorsement of the game.
---
Yes I am still wearing the uniform, however I did log out several times (all but the first being due to the quest not continuing)
---
Don't forget if you iver-repair it with weapon artisan it almost quadruples damage output
---
Dewd.... you probably hit the flag for over 100k lbs of legendaries, you have pretty much every weapon in the legendary specs most people want, I didnt watch the whole vid as I'm at work. But between the weapons/armor you showed that you got as "gifts" and the rest of the ones you got as drops, I'd strongly have to agree with the fact you aquired more legendary items in a set period that was possible playing the game legit, and that was why you got banned.
---
I've been playing since beta and I'd be lucky to have a tenth of the legendaries you have, and mine are mostly 1* and 2*, not 3* god rolls. Like I said, not calling you a cheater, but you definetly benefitted from cheaters, that or you know a ton of people with god roll weapons just taking up space in their banks.
---
That would be great even better would be the ability to take a wheelbarrow from White Springs and fill it with scorchbeast guano and fill there camp up with it.
---
Ive been getting rid of lvl 45 stuff to hold out for lvl 50 for nothin
---
What, where did you hear this?
---
... this isn’t a disagreement, it seems more like a misunderstanding of game mechanics, but okay. 
---
And mininukes don’t bypass slap damage. I haven’t tested how the radiation damage from gamma/radium weapons works with slap damage so I’ll make no comment there. 
---
There's still nothing to do at end game.
---
Absolutely amazing idea! I would love to join!
---
Same thing happened to me. I just exited and reloaded into a different server.
---
Try talking to him again. At this point it half reset the game for me and I had to do the first 3 trials again and then it would complete.
---
To be more accurate Reddit isn't holding people to be guilty until proven innocent on a whim.
---
They start off innocent. Then BGS investigates and finds them guilty. 
---
Then they come here and post. So they are in fact actually already guilty. 
---
I have posted about this before. I like to set up a Responders Aid station CAMP. I would love this, Responder Decor, and the ability that when we decorate from the stash another player may take that item freely(but it must be toggleable for individual items)
---
As for the gift box, other players should be able to put items into it. Then I could post a sign saying, "Take what you need, leave what you don't"
---
None of that is high end. Plus the two level 40s are nothing. You are 50+, that means you are maxed out in special points, power armor is horrible in pvp, so you had him beat too. Unless you and the level 40s were rocking bird bones, fall damage reduction gear and/or perks you would have taken serious damage from the fall Nothing about your story makes sense. If you want to make up stories go ahead, just don't post them as facts.
---
No one has proven me wrong, no one has offered any evidence to go against the evidence I've supplied. You seem to not understand what "proving you wrong" means. Proving insinuates proof being supplied, they haven't offered any proof. I have.
---
I generally down vote anything that isn't asking to make the game harder. You shouldn't try to win through begging; this isn't even an official forum please leave reddit for fun.
---
I notice it mainly in constricted spaces like silos.  A lot of random ceiling shots.  But you really don’t need vats—shotties are point and kill weapons
---
Totally never lied when they said it would be 4x the size with 16x the detail and showed a heavily doctored ‘gameplay’ video at the reveal.
---
Is a solo world possible?
---
Reddit has actual voting. You don't need in game changes to do this it's just that no one wants to.
---
Love stealth, the op knows what he's doing. The cost is in ammo though. I use stealth melee in my farm run and it saves quite a bit of lead. You can hybrid. I don't know why everyone wants to min/max one build when you really can run it all (not maxed but enough to one hit mobs which is what you should be tweaking for). If they would put in card presets, it would save you from manually swapping perks out all the time.
---
1 example?
---
I second this (don't have the game, but sounds really cool?
---
1 tiny example.
---
I look at it in my app bar and say "you coulda been great". I got the goddamn game for free and I still won't play it
---
No.  All worlds are public.
---
Some people report that they get into worlds that other people are not in.  Those reports are few and far in between, and some of the reports are by new players who get "wanted" and don't realize that they are no longer able to see players on their map when wanted.  A few of them are legitimately on servers that are either new and take a while to populate, or something happens and no one else gets placed.
---
But there is no actual way to force that to happen.
---
Yeah you seem to not realize if you can burst enough damage it overflows and ignores slap damage. For gods sake you don't even have an explosive gun in the game het somehow you want to act like you know everything about this game. Here is a secret, you don't.
---
Ok
---
I feel like another container object would just end up being used for dumping again unfortunately 
---
I’m not saying that they had the same problems, just that the issues they did have turned a lot of people sour on the experience. Those people in turn continue to post negative reviews/comments, turning potential future gamers away. 
---
I agree with you that they different with regards to content issues vs stability issues but ultimately the negative experience has the same result
---
Same, but I’m wanting to be more involved with other players. One time a spontaneous trade turned to a player initiating PvP and following me around for an hour and I still don’t understand what I did wrong. 
---
Why no mics? Everyone on party chat? I’m on Xbox. 
---
Awesome 👍 been since I was 13 can't believe how well you retain game information but yet when you want to remember something important it's gone lol
---
Good Sir, 
---
How dare ye claim to having the fun with a less-than-perfect-at-launch video game! Your enjoyment is clearly a lie or possibly a complex conspiracy to troll the reddit-verse. Do you even have \*A\* friend? You must provide proof of your enjoyment at once! 
---
You're supporting a criminal operation that likely eats babies! You should be weaponizing all the circle-jerking YouTube reviews and hating it like a sane person for the rest of your life and/or mankind. Bethesda, have you no shame? Boycott Boycott! Refund the game and pay me for my wasted time! 
---
Ooooh nice C.A.M.P. man. Can I friend you? Think I'll join you...
---
When are they ever once openly hostile to a non-feral? Sure, they are understandably wary towards someone that could lose their shit and become feral at any moment, but they've never been shown once to hunt down non-ferals just because they are ghouls. 
---
Hell, in Fallout 4, the game where everybody is basing their  hate from, they just let you walk around their base of operations with your ghoul companion like it's nothing. 
---
And also, we would have to differentiate chapters. 
---
The Midwest faction (which actually is facist) strait up enrolls ghouls and super mutants right into their ranks. 
---
Those are plans for Mods, not plans for the pieces themselves.
---
Excavator, Ultracite, and X01 armor plans are learned from Terminals tied to side and main story quests.  But T45, T51b, and T60 plans are from events and treasure maps.
---
Ultracite armor plans can drop from SB/SBQ too, but are redundant these days with the BoS quest giving you access to all the plans when finished.
---
At this point, I’d probably give somebody at Bethesda a blowjob just to get a good fucking drop in this goddamn game. I’m getting so tired of the shit drops.
---
Welcome! Loving this game.. what I enjoyed most in previous titles in the series was roleplaying away from the main story; creating a character, imagining a backstory and finding my own narrative out in the world.. I hope you and more players are able to do the same!
---
[Here’s](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCbWUGGTvBiwzWZEg06l0w) a little of what I’ve been doing so far...
---
Same problem here. I bought a hard copy code and a digital code from Amazon, neither one worked.
---
You’re right but after a point when there fuck all to do and the game doesn’t have the tools to make your time  fun, what are you to do?
---
Can you please just go find the next game you'll play and complain about ? The malcontents have done enough damage to the community. You're not being clever, you're not being smart. You're just being negative. That doesn't require skill. It just requires an internet connection. Grats on your first world privilege.
---
I usually charge 1500 caps for that. I’ve installed them on the legs now, and it has Motion Assisted Servos on the torso for another 10 lbs as well
---
 Must be nice. I ground the fuck out of Modus for my Jet Pack. ;)
---
That would be great brother / sister :)
---
I try to organize PVP with friends but you all hate effort. And debate. Also complexity. Fun. Excitement. 25 players.
---
You play Super Mario and it amps the complexity, but then you play Fallout and want it to become simpler.
---
You could also organize pacifist clans but that too would take effort. Removing PVP = no effort, no trying, no excitement, no tension. Truly is the laziest path for the most mundane fun.
---
But rivers are nice 
---
Gotta have them sweet sweet rads to make the food stuffs good.
---
So, in other words, you let launch negativity pass and stopped worrying about the biases you brought to the table, and when you picked it up later, you realized its just a video game and video games are a fun way to relax when you just let yourself play them. This is good for the community and I like this kind of post. 
---
I agree!  I played for around 100 hours after release (another game I enjoyed despite the issues) and came back to again after the second big patch. They delivered a lot of what they promised and I really like the content. 
---
I don’t know how many people are willing to give games another shot considering how many options there are for us these days was my original point. 
---
If you get ammo reduction armor you can use it with a lower level bandolier perk card and get the same reduction in weight. Freeing up a perk point or 2 depending on how many armor pieces you have.
---
Can you explain investigates? I don't think they put any amount of real investigating into these banning. I think they rely on software that can be wrong because humans make software and Bethesda already has proven to make bad patches etc. I work in IT and Help Desk and I know that if you wanted to ban someone you need to do a pretty good investigation of checking logs and documenting them. Since Bethesda doesn't disclose their process you and I both have to guess what their process is and that is where the problem lies. Reddit seems to assume that Bethesda is through and just in their banning where the people banned feel an injustice since their is no way to plead an innocent case. 
---
Jesus Christ liberty prime, can you chill just for a second, I don't think there is commies in this game!
---
I don’t care about belief, I care about proof. I’m only talking about things I’ve tested (and I’ve tested mininukes. I can push over 2k damage with mine. 5hp slap damage). That’s why I’m not speaking to radiation damage weapons, I haven’t tested them yet, but now I will. Another poster in this thread said car damage was still considered to be sourced from you, but I’ll test that too (I actually wouldn’t be surprised if you can kill someone with an exploding car. But that would be environmental damage, NOT “bypassing slap damage”. )
---
What platform are you on? 
---
Don't buy from Amazon.  Neither my physical nor digital codes from Amazon worked
---
I'm very pissed.  and I'd better get refunds.
---
Sentinel and Cavalier are secondary effects so they can only spawn on armor with another primary effect. But for some reason the armor will sometimes have Sentinel in its name instead of the primary effect. It is weird.
---
That's a toxic suggestion Bethesda DOES NOT owe you any reply. You're simply playing the wrong game. Try Minecraft or Star Dew valley.
---
Complex = fun this is just boring.
---
BoS only gives you access to the Ultracite Armor plans, not the Mod plans.  Ultracite Mod plans gotta farm SB/SBQ for.
---
Enclave gives you access to the Full X01 Armor plans just like BoS does for Ultracite.  Only you can just server hop for X01 mods, where as you have to deal with SB/SBQ RNG for Ultracite mod plans and then craft them.
---
Yeah she can get ground locked still. Before the patch she would fly away off the bottom of the map and get stuck if you locked her with a +50 limb damage weapon and let off. I haven't seen her fly off since the patch, maybe they fixed it.
---
U can locate the club mace mod near pleasant valley it's a random spawn. The Ally near coliseum is where I found it.
---
Please don't buy Fallout and ruin it for everyone else if you're too much of a snowflake to handle PVP.
---
It's like 190 caps to buy. Super cheap.
---
I have a high level heavy weapons character that I could use, but I need to wear my power Armor constantly because if the carry weight if that’s cool with you guys. I also have a hunter, that might be more suitable fir the job
---
Add gears to combat knives to the list of. Wtf, why not?
---
What console are you on?
---
Sold it to a vendor - doh
---
West Tek usually has a couple outside and a couple more inside. 
---
i think last laugh should drop a live mine inside of the bag, taking anything acts as a PVP action but ONLY long enough for the mine to explode., the bag (and the mine) collectible without triggering the grenade, if you have no equipped mine it will randomly select one.
---
The chosen one 
---
I tend to notice a difference. Like previously said, not as obvious as before nerf. But say versus a lvl 40-45 mole miner, that maxed out demo expert card makes the difference between them being a 1 shot kill, or a 2-3 shot kill. 
---
while they have not actively hunted non feral ghouls there is plenty of dialogue and terminal entries to suggest they hate them and have killed them, as to the companion, everything about companions in Fallout games is lenient, factions will let you in with companions they don't like and companions will stick with you even if you do something they don't like, to a point, it's a gameplay decision.  face it, they are fascists and racists
---
What is doh?
---
Sounds a lot like the enclave buddy
---
He showed up the golfclub last night there was like 10 players there he was fighting all of us lol
---
Milk of human kindness best
---
Isn’t bulk better to sell than the raw/scrap?
---
I agree with your points. I wasn’t trying to place blame, absolve, or justify either studio... just pointing out that the results were similar with regard to perception 
---
In all fairness, he may not have known it was yours.  He may have thought you were looting the bag too.
---
I look for low level players fast travel to them turn my mic on and say there is some good stuff in the bag also some new players don't know about paper bags.
---
Good one. Don’t forget to precede it with “I’m not answering any questions” and “I’m not showing you my I.D.”.
---
Farmers and sanitation workers have a higher fatality rate that LEOs do. Don’t buy into the artificial hero worship.
---
Milk of human kindness taste best
---
Like different branches of the police force
---
Probably nothing. . . Chances are the guy was just a D.
---
I mean, we are building functional guns out of plastic straws from fast food drink cups, pencils, corn, fruit, and a couple TV dinner trays...
---
Okay?
---
How much is enough? Provide me some kind of evidence to work with here. What was your testing scenario? What were your results? 
---
I put stuff in overseer's caches too.
---
The sound Homer Simpson makes, an exclamation of one's own stupidity 
---
I feel your pain. I can't even open the door to my camp anymore junks everywhere. I feel so ashamed someone call the Hoarders tv show so they can chainsaw the door open I need access to my work benches. Just don't let them throw anything out I need my junk. 
---
Negative coverage generates more clicks. 
---
The worst are rosies quests. Most are in areas high levels frequent.  I hated those missions. Level 20 something and trying to fight 6-8 lvl 68 super mutants.....wtf. 
---
Im at lvl 150 or so now and try helping low lvls if I think I spawed in big baddies.  
---
Honestly some of the low level missions should have been kept in the forest, ash heap, and toxic valley. 
---
Even better, being able to set the bag on fire forcing them to stamp out the fire!
---
FO76 is not your personal erotica.
---
Bringing up exploits really is ridiculous. What happened to gaming that it's just about having a safe space and not about excitement? Who told you it's ok to be analogue and basic like this?
---
It's a 25 player game where you can do epic 12v12 but you just want... Minecraft? Solo play? NPCs? 
---
Why did you people even buy this game?
---
First tell us why you even bought a PVP game? You seem liked the confused one.
---
If u press the right analog button on PS4 it shows just what u are offering or what the player wants..but I'm done with random trades anyway
---
See my even better list: item 1
---
I'm on pc and. 2k is nothing for a vats crit sniper builds especially with instigating legendary sniper rifle. The sniper build is a glass cannon you are built to literally kill anything in a single shot through sneak buff perks, crit buff perks, vats damage perk, and an instigating weapon. That first shot should easily be much higher than that.
---
Imagine Grahm in a police uniform giving equipment to new recruits
---
thanks!
---
Hope this camp has delicious foods for Chally...
---
What do you mean when ppl see you play on Discord? Isn't it a chat room? 
---
I would love that! Make it a daily quest! Hahaha
---
Ya... I wish Marine Armor had better stats.
---
Studded Heavy Leather is pretty much on par with BOS Heavy Combat.
---
I personally don't see the Rad resist making up for that much of the Marine stats.  I kind of wish Marine had a "Heavy" version.  So far it's just "Marine" and is a Sturdy level armor.
---
But, in the end, the difference is pretty small, and it really comes down to the legendary affixes.  Which piece you get that has your Sentinel, Vanguard, Bolstering, Unyielding, etc. effects.
---
At least 5k a crit.
---
But why not?
---
Ok message me when your done gt progamer56737 
---
Ok I have tried again and it still does not seem to work. Will I just have to wait for a patch?
---
Not sure when system your on, but on ps4 you hit the R3 button and it changes the view to only show offers. So all you see is the stuff you or they are offering for sale, or the items of yours they are requesting to buy. And you hit R3 again to go back to the normal screen.
---
Put your weapon away too, I still run into the odd person that believes that you can steal somebodies equipped weapon, if you trade with them with your weapon unholstered. Which I dont think was ever more than a Reddit rumor.
---
“Pay us to help you or else” bad or “we suck at our job” bad
---
You... Don't get how opinions work, do you?
---
 It was over 50 visits for my Jet Pack. SBs I kill all the time although I have yet to do a SBQ. I want it to be my nuke, but I'm busy with other things. ;)
---
Of course everyone should still be able to grab whatever they see if they feel like it and want to. This is just a suggestion of a visual help aid for those that don't want to grab someone else stuff by mistake, not a limitation of anyone's gaming style. Loot on!
---
First instance I recall it being stated was in F4, and sounds like it was a phrase adopted after the loss of the BoS Citadel.  
---
And why are you saying that I am stupid?
---
The police engineer, that would be cool
---
I know, I have high hopes for the future. Will reinstall it later this year after I beat a couple other games
---
have you gone back to ESO?  it is more RPG than MMO and can easily be played as a single player game
---
Thats just immersion ;)  as a cook id rather use purified water for my gourd soup.
---
In my lvl 70s I started earning/selling/saving for signs and letters. Took maybe a week or so doing my daily grind of farming maybe 100/150 purified water to sell along with whatever scrap I could give up, as well as highly priced cooked food I’d get from holding the 1 or 2 workshops I’d hold. 
---
Felt kind of like work but I went from never holding more thank maybe 1500 caps at s time to saving 10,000 caps for one plan. 
---
It was fun learning how to make the 1400 caps vendor run. 
---
I have an addiction to rads from chasing marsupial. My friends have given up any sense of panic seeing my health constantly at 20-25%
---
New players will come. I’m one of them. 
---
Just bought the game last week, at lvl 18 now. Based on the nightmare stories I’ve heard from launch, the game has made huge progress. You guys actually get some communication from the dev’s. It’s clearly being supported. 
---
Internet sentiment seems to be coming around with FO76. I’m seeing more and more posts of people saying “It’s actually turning out good, give it a chance.”
---
Nice try, Todd Howard. 
---
Really, though - I can't bring myself to support Bethesda on this one. There are better things to spend my time and money on. It's not just quality, but the controversies since release as well. I have zero faith in FO76, and even if they turn it back around like the Division or No Man's Sky it won't change my mind. It's the exact opposite of what I want from a Fallout game, personally. If *you* enjoy it for what it is - knock yourself out. Some people aren't willing to even give it a chance, and they are totally justified despite your experiences with the game.
---
I feel like its important to say because so many people say they lied out their god damn teeth about this game but.. i feel like I've known what this game was gonna be since it was shown at that press conference.  Nukes, base building, multiplayer fallout, no human NPC's.  So many people I talk to about this game end up saying some shit like "I would never play this piece of shit" and "I just want singleplayer Fallout."  It's absurd.
---
The problem with this game was that it was glitchy as fuck, it was in the spotlight, and Bethesda kept screwing the fuck up.  Lies weren't part of it at all.
---
&gt;. Is that so hard for people like you to understand?
---
You get your say BEFORE you buy the game back when Bethesda was developing it. You agreed to PVP when you paid cash for this. It's not understanding we do not respect your over privileged attitude; just go play Minecraft.
---
You sheeple are obviously wrong because you're down voting everyone who disagrees with you. There is no discussion or debate here you're a bunch of toxic over priveleged players and Bethesda DOES NOT owe you a response. PVP is what you agreed to.
---
I want Survival mode, Nuclear Winter, Wild Appalachia not wasting time on kiddie gloves and worthless fridges and a reddit babysitter. REAL content.
---
I think it could be a nice upgrade on last laugh, add another star and a mine gets placed with your loot. That might make people think twice before just rushing to loot.
---
You can still do it, but you have to pay the price in health and stimpacks!
---
Not sure. Like I said it just reset for me.
---
Maybe inform the team of this bug? For now just do other quests and hope it resets.
---
What platform you on?
---
It’s under 3lbs but slow AF? Who the wields this thing?
---
Personally I’d slap damage the guy responsible 
---
Not all that different, really....
---
That will be me except I also have a minigun for when their resisting
---
 Its not, they lied. ;) BoS Heavy Combat is the bomb. Mine is at about 315 325 3 right now. A bit stronger than my level 35 Excavator, except of course Rad Resistance.
---
That was hilarious. Good work!
---
You played a master tinker on Ultima Online I bet :D
---
The load screen lies.  The best base armor (without Legendary effects) is Combat Armor with the BoS mod.
---
This is because both Combat Armor, and Leather Armor for that matter, top out at Lv. 50.  Marine Armor caps at Lv. 45.
---
Having a mic helps I usually wait about 2 minutes before I walk away and wave bye. I don't want to be rude but I hate waiting and wondering if the other player is done looking.
---
Great idea - hope big B sees this.
---
Some untold number of SB kills and only 3 SBQ attempts (one success) and the only Ultracite Mod plans I have are Explosive Vents (woohoo? /s).  Only SBQ kill I had, she dropped the Plan for the Ultracite Helmet, which I already knew cause they gave us all the plans via terminal for the quest.  No mod plan at all.
---
Those X01 mod server hops are a cake walk, relatively speaking, to me.
---
Ya can try switching the walls out with foundations. But my buddy went through this with the Scorched Deathclaw. He ended up killing it and switching to a regular Deathclaw.
---
Hey, are you guys gonna have s jail for people who surrender cause I could be a warden if that’s cool
---
Plastic. The real question is why we can’t pick up all those fake flowers for plastic harvesting if that is the case, though.
---
Everyone who tries to debate gets downvoted by you safe space over priveleged grass munching sheeple.
---
...i still owe you an apology for the bold text i'm as skillful at editing as you are at confrontation.
---
Bethesds DOES NOT owe you any reply, this is way too petty.
---
Awesome, how does one go about getting BOS plans?
---
I've done the forbidden knowledge quest a few times, but am only getting a poxy amount of ammo each time
---
I’d like to see a salty emote that made me sprinkle salt as well.
---
Level 150ish and I've seen 2. I will say, I think I saw my first one around 35 ish.
---
Excellent!   That is indeed an objective standard which can be defined based upon predetermined criteria.
---
I disagree with your opinion that it is the best way to determine the quality of a game, but it is objective!
---
I believe you can state objectively that a game meets certain established criteria in regards to public perception - as long as those criteria are defined, but I don't think that determines anything about the game itself - which I still feel is determined entirely subjectively through experience - the public reception being a conglomeration of many of those subjective experiences.
---
I want to thank you for talking with me about this as I do feel as though I understand this perspective better now, and I appreciate you taking the time.
---
I would like to state one thing I was thinking when I was having my lunch - and I could be wrong, but it seems as though you think that an objective truth is more important or of greater importance than a subjective truth.  I would argue that this is not the case.
---
You don't need anyone to agree with you for your subjective truth to be valid.  No one has the right to take your perspective from you no matter how greatly it differs from even a well defined consensus - and especially not something so nebulous as the opinions of the community of critics.
---
I also think that there are a large number of people who agree with me and don't take into account public perception when determining their opinions on the quality of the games they play.  I don't think this makes those opinions any less valid - though I do recognize that they may be outliers from the norm.
---
If you don't mind my asking - why do you think consensus is important when deciding your opinion on the quality of subjective entertainment?
---
Would only work if it were solely spoiled food in it though and nothing else.
---
Interesting. Would you pls tell what you harvest? Is it random junk?
---
More like we just ran around shouting we were the police but never actually helping anyone just kind of roaming the wastes, creeping up on unsuspecting dwellers and causing a ruckus.
---
I think Raw Fertilizer or Spoiled food already gets the point across...
---
depending on the mine that is applied. some of them are quite devastating. pulse melts power armor, plasma is just deadly in general. and Nuke mines would be harder to avoid.
---
Yup. Generally speaking if the bag is all junk, it’s practically guaranteed to be a death bag.
---
All i did was use #'s and points, i edited it but i can't figure out how to turn off the bold. Do you know how?
---
I ran into that same problem, as I was starting on those quests at lower levels (I since put off most questing until after I was 50).
---
My solution was to keep track of the high level player, aggro the high level mobs, and kite them back to the player.  Usually the sight of a 20-something player sprinting away from level 50+ mobs was enough to get the higher level player to step in.  
---
If that didn't work, I have a pretty high level of 'run away screaming like a little girl', so I could usually escape :P
---
Losing your junk upon death is to be expected, I consider myself lucky if I'm able to retrieve it, but never have any expectation that I will.
---
I do however believe some things should not drop, like Fluxes and Bulked Items, unless you are the instigator of a PvP fight.
---
I also believe the instigator of a PvP fight should be Lootable for enough of whatever they have on them to cover the Bounty or cap reward that's due, this alone would put an end to 90% of the Griefing that goes on in this game.
---
Hit thrusters, then claws
---
Its Watoga for All Rise.
---
 I thought everything calculates off of base damage?
---
258 base + 258 for insti + 335 for stealth = 851, not 1187. How do you know it all stacks?
---
Usually you can look at the Fallout 76 market or bazaar reddits to get a set that is a few thousand cheaper than the vendor. 
---
It just doesn't feel personal enough to me.
---
if its your second character, then you have seemingly already failed at doing it right the first time.... :D
---
All I’m saying is if he’s gonna perv ya, he should expect 
---
[a boot the head](https://youtu.be/tfMcxmOBmpk) 
---
I miss having these BELOW my body armor like in FO4.
---
All Rise comes from the Watoga mayor quest line.
---
I'd like to see the timing tweaked a bit where if I hear trouble and decide to go help a lower-level, I don't run the risk of respawning everyone in the process.
---
Read post please. That was a rifle build. Thanks for the help!
---
 Well I walked from the Mire at least 25 times allowing only one server hop per trip. 
---
 It took a while but the Flatwood Monster and the Mothman show up on my trip a lot. Whoope de doo, but I hate the Mothman. ;)
---
And that doesn't even take into account, is base damage calculated off of weapon base, or base + dmg adds from perks?
---
And from this point forward 2/28 will be known as Deathmasclaws Day and he will spread love and cheer to all the vault dwellers.
---
It spits out broken down junk components:  Springs, screws, circuits, glass shards, etc.  It spits out maybe 5 in 10 minutes?  It only holds about 20 or so so you have to keep emptying it.
---
I feel like I never get placed in servers where this happens. I'm always the one having to start crap alone.
---
Yes, bulk weighs less than the component scrap.  But you still want to limit yourself to 10-15ish of each bulk \_\_\_\_\_ so that you don't use up all your stash space.
---
There were a lot of answers I was expecting. That was not one of them
---
It's on here and you still see stupid was comments " this is why I still don't play this game" like either you play it or you don't and if you choose not to play then don't complain. Yes there are issues but I find most of them are while annoying are not game breaking. Some people are just overly entitled twats. 
---
It's funny how people bitch about the game being  shitty for the bugs yet when IGN gave a low score to prey due to literal game breaking bug that was recreated 3 time even after dev intervention people lost their shit on ign 
---
At the end of the day the masses are morons and nothing will satisfy them. 
---
Ahh yes, change view, I will try that next time. 
---
Couldn't help it, don't know why, but now every thought in my head is in the voice of the Silver Shroud, and you are partially responsible.
---
I love that so much lol 
---
You sound like a griefer.. downvoting 
---
Yes, this idea is suggested on a daily basis 
---
Duuuude...what locations do you go to in order to find such epic drops... Those weapons have such great legendary effects.
---
pro tip: the museum. People will often snatch them up, but if you just server hop you should be able to find them all there. I don't recall there being multiple museums, but you'll find both the rifle and pistol in there always (as long as someone didn't already find them there in that session). No idea what respawn timer on them are.
---
Just to smash your hopes right now, there are no mods for either of them. If there is, I never got any mods from crushing dozens of them. I've also only played somewhere between 100-200 hours and I've seen and done everything. What are ya'll doing for 400 hours where you haven't seen and done everything?
---
I want a people are waiting so please stop afk'ing the vendor emote. Perhaps a fart...
---
I'm a griefer eh? What makes you think that?
---
I just started playing again after quitting the first week.  I’m level 16 and see other low level players too.  On PS4 
---
Yeah i got all the barrels too but none of the muzzles that rifles have
---
I got a rifle really early in the game, like level 8
---
It was my most powerful weapon by far but the ammo was hard to come by
---
That would be a great idea! I recently acquired the alien blaster, and I wish you could craft more AB rounds! Also maybe the could drop weapons similar to the ones found in the Mother ship Zeta DLC?
---
Upvoting because I love any story about assholes getting beat.
---
Mine sometimes does the same thing. I'm not sure but best guess is its a terrain clipping issue with something. You get a free replacement, so plunk it back down but raise it up a foot or so. It's worked for me in the past. 
---
My theory that covers all nukes in this game is that they’re neutron bombs: low heat and force yield, high radiation yield. 
---
You looked out for your friends at a cost to yourself.  Well done :)
---
Perfect, I’m on PC too.  Come prove you can 1shot me through slap damage. 
---
I think it's possible.
---
This would be a great idea. I've lost count of the amount of times I've died right next to where someone else died and grabbed their bag by mistake
---
Forbidden Knowledge only nets you the BoS initiate paint job plans and other BoS apparel but never paint jobs for the combat armor from my understanding (I really hope I'm wrong cause I still need the limb paint jobs lol). It used to be that you could get the BoS paint for combat armor from the Grafton train station but I guess it got bugged when that update a while back change the plan listing on vendors (They did mention it was something they were looking into)
---
 They have disappeared. They have been gone since the last big change. The Dense mod is also awol.
---
 With the Dense mod I found at R&amp;G Station and 3 Fireproof my BoS Heavy Combat takes no damage from explosions. None. With Strengthened Limbs I take no damage at all. With Pocketed I sometimes break a leg, but still no damage. 
---
 Its very sweet. "Hey got any more missiles/" To any SB "Your screaming is doing nothing honey." ;)
---
Haha I found a location the other day and was like O_o how did I miss this?!
---
Exactly, I farm as much plastic as possible then bulk everything and once a day go to a couple vendors (that don’t share cap limits) and sell any excess over 15, that’s how I keep a steady income of caps
---
If you’re behind/way over on weight than you can buy a plan or two to restock the vendor caps to sell some more  
---
You can find mutant hounds everywhere you can find super mutants, which is a lot of places.
---
Separate PSN on the new console would definitely work.
---
If it's a physical copy, you need two discs.
---
I can be online in about 45 minutes
---
Hm... I don't think any of my building was too weird, I know it's done that before if you have too much like merged into other things. I was hoping not to have to rebuild RIP
---
Both would need subscription.  Not sure about guest acvounts etc.
---
Same here, I definitely hadn't seen a radium rifle the first month the game came out, til about late December. Didn't know what a gamma gun was until I started trading.
---
That happened twice to me yesterday,then I decided to go have a look and nothing was even near my Base so yet another bug we have to put up with.
---
Yes these do but I pick up a lot of crap too. Nuke zones mostly.
---
You might consider a bloodied build.  I started out similar, picking rifleman over commando.  Once I switched to a bloodied/steal/commando style I really started crushing stuff.  I run around with a 1\* bloodied combat rifle and rip through everything but the SBQ with minimal ammo loss.
---
I keep a bloodied Dragon handy for those times when I really need to hit something hard ;) 
---

I usually run around at about 30% HP, which gives me enough damage for day to day use.  The extra strength perks and radicool are for carry weight/QOL type stuff.  
---
I also pop nerd rage on when my health gets below 20%, and run adrenal reaction.  
---
Thank you for the defense. Exactly I'm worried about this guy. Like what did I say to deserve that kind of vitriol. Funny thing is, I love FO76. I can love the game and totally disagree and be turned off my the content Bethesda is releasing.
---
Shit. My pet was more of a mongrel... not at all a super mutants mutant hound. 
---
Maybe it was a scorched mongrel? Something like this.. I only had him for 40 minutes! Lol
---
It’s not perfect, but the salute emote, especially in PA, looks really good for it. Fist over your heart and everything. 
---
I was playing (streaming) for several hours a night until anthem early access day.  Hundreds of hours total.
---
Haven't played since, other than to log on after last patch to find that my power armor still won't stay equipped and my handmade won't stay on the favorites wheel, followed up with a server disconnect.  I had planned to stream that day.
---
Last straw.  My love for the game has turned to a mixture of disappointment and disdain.  Perhaps a tinge of contempt.
---
Why over repair is this with all items
---
If it's anything like Xbox, to play two instances of the same game as separate players on separate consoles would need two copies of the game and two Xbox Live accounts. 
---
Having not played 76 on anything but PC, though, I can't say for sure. 
---
Ok. Harvesting lead atm but this'll be pretty useful too. Thx for your reply.
---
This makes me very sad... Thanks for the info tho
---
Have you even played Fallout 3? “Most "smooth skins" are tolerated, as long as they don't cause trouble. The Brotherhood of Steel are not welcome because of their hostility towards ghouls and their tendency to shoot them on sight. The super mutants leave the ghouls alone.” That’s a piece of text taken from the Underworld page. Hell even the super mutants are nicer to them.
---
I’m pretty sure I remember seeing it at the end of terminal entries in this game though. 
---

---
Are the scorcher immune to radiation, since they're basically ghouls?
---
Just to clarify... I made a mistake with the name. My pet was more of a mutant or scorched mongrel/dog. It was not a mutant hound that the super mutants have.  
---
Should I still keeping walking to west tek?
---
Blunderbuss = strong black powder pistol
---
Dragon = strong black powder rifle 
---
With excavator armor you can pull 400 lead ore out of a single run of the lucky hole mine...
---
Which console are you running? 
---
Do you know what those subreddits are called? I know it says I've been here awhile but I have no idea how to use it. I started using it again because me and my friends are doing that Appalachia PD thing 
---
Ahhh...Okay that makes sense I guess. Tbh I haven't had much luck with drops at nuke sites. Almost always crappy armor haha.
---
yeah getting to know the map is the best option first!
---
Tell me about it, and no problem! I'm actually shooting for the initiate paint job doing Forbidden Knowledge too but if I get BoS combat paint jobs from that or any other even in the Mire (Distant Thunder, Census Violence, Sand in the Line, ect...), I'll let you know.
---
I think most people are going max into perception, agility and luck. Perception is all rifleman perks, tank killer, and concentrated fire. Agility for the sneak perks, evasiveness, and escape artist. Luck for crit chance and damage increase. I switched things up a bit by removing some damage and crit perks and added starched genes and class freak. I can’t resist all those mutation benefits.
---
The king of building! Love your videos Jug!
---
I imagine the ingame mechanic of dropping junk on death, works differently to manually dropped items. for death bags just do what they did with the cargobot drops and mark them as owned and give you wanted status if you take it.
---
Thanks buddy, much appreciated 
---
I tested long shot and it doesn't help vats and really isn't needed for snipping out of vats in my experience
---
Also four leaf clover had been broken for two patches but since i run critical saavy Grimm reapers sprint is far better,  however it broke the same time as four leaf clover.  These were the cornerstones of my build but i have since adjusted.  I run class freak and use shielded Under armor and always go deep pocketed to compensate for low strength.  I have 11 mutations i love. 
---
and let us discard perks we don’t want to pan by over and over and over...
---
Ok buddy I’ll look u up
---
The thing I didn't like is they stack in inventory and you can't drop them. Even though they weigh nothing, it triggers me xD
---
I find not all nuke zones are equal. Sometimes you’ll get lots of stuff but low level and other times better stuff.
---
Lolz quickly deleted your comment after 2 ppl downvoted you lolz
---
It’s ok, we know why..
---
I find your bag, I'm taking it, period. Hell, most of my collected bounties were more for the loot vs caps.
---
Hey man, I'll be on again after 4pm Pacific time if you still want me to make the armor.
---
I didn't delete it
---
Looking at your post history, you seem to claim everyone's a duper, so go away
---
Super mutants give the best experience points of creatures that cluster. They can be a bit tough to take on, one at a time is how i do it. Just be sure when leveling to consider your defensive side as well, whether that be through damage mitigation or stealthing. You can't be a glass cannon without a strategy, though you CAN be "too tanky" and do little damage, it will just take longer to kill stuff. If you're not into min-maxing, just remember to consider both sides of the field. Killing stuff is fun but staying alive is too.  
---
That aside, if you are power leveling, just repeatedy run into mobs and kill them, even if they kill you. You will get experience for a monster's death if you deal 1 pt of damage to them, even if you do not land the killing blow. I leveled my second character this way, just ran into mobs constantly while kiting them in Whitesprings.
---
Personally, I would take Rank 1 of the various Slugger perks and spend the savings on Martial Artist.  I also ended up replacing Barbarian with the flat damage reduction of Blocker.  Melee enemies can be a surprising threat when you are melee yourself.
---
The Legendaries you find ultimately shape what kind of melee you want to specialize in.  I ended up gravitating into Gladiator instead of Slugger.
---
Serendipity is good for rushing toward your target.
---
I think you have too much in Agility.  I wouldn't go without White Knight, but that's just me.
---
Flux and bulk should definitely remain lootable. There's little enough consequence of death as is. 
---
Players receiving no caps from a high bounty is likely so that people can't exploit  the system i.e. getting a high bounty that the game would 'cover' instead of the player so unlimited caps isn't possible from that method if using a friend to kill you.  
---
 It's annoying getting no cap reward from killing a player but I see why it's like that, and it'll be interesting to see how they implement being able to loot Aid items from players in the upcoming 'Survival' mode.
---
People always run from me. I guess wearing silver shroud trenchcoat, enclave officer hat and sunglasses, or x-01 power armor makes me look spooky.
---
I just want to give you a lvl 5 BoS recon rifle, enclave officer suit/hat, some stims, .308 ammo and pocketed leather armor!
---
Suffer.
---
This is an Awesome idea to combat food spoilage!!
---
 Dog,  I think that "forever canning" would be nice for fallout 4 but for 76 idk.
---
Bethesda really needs to consider this suggestion to have the Canning make food last 2-3x normal most definitely but to do it should take rarer mats. 
---
(not fire cap rare tho bcuz homemade disease cure is near mythic) 
---
Welcome!
---
 this is assuming that everyone has mic and they speak your language, which is often not the case
---
You forget about trap bases. A stray paper bag is used as a lure right now. Imagine if you made gift boxes official! Every box is set to kill xD
---
Because otherwise there'd be practically nothing to make dying something you'd want to avoid?
---
Animated cards seem to exist solely from some version of this game where card packs were lootboxes or something that got cut, they don't really make a whole lot of sense as the card system is now. (the card system as it is now feels pretty weird too, since you just pick cards and the card packs are pretty weird rewards for most of the game)
---
Yeah. Tried with the event one at Morgantown. Thought it worked because when it dropped off the cargo I was able to stand on it, but then it just clipped through me when it took off.
---
Guess I was wrong lol. That would be cheaper than having two paid subscriptions. Good to know 
---
I wonder if any of those would work on a Wendigo wearing a clown costume?
---
j/k, that quest never ends.
---
The memories... ah man, so much fun!
---
Only bulk Aluminum and Lead weigh different when bulked, all other weight loss comes from the plastic being used to bulk.  If you can't bulk a junk item, that means you can sell it loose/as is..most junk can only be sold in bulk form.
---
We need a curated suggestion list for great ideas like this
---
Lolz 
---
You’re the one who deleted your post.. I’m not the one hiding any thing..
---
If it helps I’ll block you so you won’t have to plan and think out your responses..
---
I have the same experience, with an added data point.
---
I run a mule account in addition to my main, login simultaneously on two boxes sitting next to each other.
---
More often than not, my main mule's house will not load when Joining my main character's server.  However, if I quit to main menu and **re-join the exact same world then my camp will get placed on the third or fourth attempt.**
---
The above of course only applies when there are no other camps around.
---
I have a pretty fancy camp with a some intentional clipping of floors into water purifiers, and a variety of manually placed foundation sitting really close to one another.  So, I could see the game having a hard time figuring out what to put down first.
---
Not meant to restrict looting, just to help those that do not want to take someone else stuff from doing so by mistake. 
---
I've been down the terminals and entries path before. Look it up. It's right on the wiki. There is a bit of kinda discriminatory language in the dialogue as you pass idle soldiers and there may be an occasional racist character (I cant think of any specifically) but as far as terminology al entries, if you go through all of the Brotherhood's terminal entries in the entirety of Fallout 4, there is only one entry that even mentions hunting down ghouls. And it is specifically about feral ghouls from some nobody initiate. 
---
A few semi-intolerant people doesn't make an entire organization racist. (I should point out I say semi- here because I still havnt specifically seen anything even remotely, openly racist) 
---
And you still havnt even tries to point out how they are fascists, so no, I won't face it. 
---
The patsy. The brand loyalist. The ‘guaranteed sell’.
---
"Lolz" what are you, 11?
---
With Xbox game share, you only need one digital copy of the game and one gold account. The main Xbox is set as home and the other piggy backs off of it. I share with my husband and we only get one of anything. 
---
Is the damage shown on a weapon the damage done during a power attack or normal attack?
---
Man, I'm level 42 and I've still never seen one of those guys.
---
Also, it wasn't a post. It got removed for "harassment"
---
Something that really stood out to me was you had 5 in adrenaline, level 1 adrenaline gives 6% damage and level 5 gives 10% so that’s only an extra 4% damage for a big 4 point investment so I only use level 1, I also have more points in luck so I can have good with salt 3 to keep those glowing meat steaks fresh for the extra melee damage bonus, with endurance I have rejuvenated 2 and chem fiend so Chem’s like Fury last longer giving extra melee damage. Personal preference is to use level 1 of each slugger perk and have level 3 incisor as all enemies have armour to some degree and that lets me take travelling Pharmacy to mitigate the weight of all my stimpacks, melee chems etc, I wear P.A with the medic pump so I don’t need born survivor but out os P.A that’s a good choice 👍
---
I scrap them for screws and plastic.
---
NMS is an amazing game now, if Bethesda puts half the work in that they did on NMS fo76 will be great.
---
Bless this comment. 
---
Why do you have to rain on my shine with this suggestion? Here I was looking forward to pretty little bows wrapped around the FO version of a bag of shit
---
Psychopath I've also found to be broken just as long.  I swap out glowing sightsand rank 1 concentrated fire for concentrated fire rank 3 when not in nuke zone.  Since i run concentrated fire i opted not to get tormentor as i typically go head shots.  Since both my guns are two shot explosive I've just recently decided to try out demo expert but haven't yet.  Gun Smith has never ever been needed for me until recently my  leveraction two shot explosive breaks seemingly three times as fast as any I've had in the past,  however my two shot explosive hand made still lasts long.  With 15 luck and critical saavy you get a crit available after two shots so four leaf clover even when working isn't ideal since they nerfed back to back criticals.  I switch to shielded raider leathers when I don't need the carry weight which gives me 3ag 3per 1 luck so just recently decided to go down to 14 luck.  Remember that won't help in power armor though.  I use chameleon mutation with all weightless armor highest defense deep pocketed and prefer vats or ap refresh bonuses.  Also i never have invested in sneak as I've heard it's broken and I've only used escape artist and nothing detects me hardly even if i walk right next to it.
---
I server hopped 5 times in a row a few days ago &amp; every server had a turret camp by the back of the Golf Club, leeching everyone else's spawns.
---
It brings the damage up. I was full health when took that. With health &lt; 90% with should do double. Then adrenal double that. So your looking at a 200+ damage that is very fast. Other's too like twisted muscles and all the melee perks, incisor..
---
I think he’s saying “whoops I sold mine to a vendor and regret it” not calling you stupid.
---
Normal, I'd have to assume.  Some folks on here probably have entire Excel spreadsheets (not kidding) on the topic of weapon damage though,  so I'll defer to them. 
---
cause the game does multiplicative not stacking. 
---
Instigating weapons do "double" damage.... Is that on just the damage portion or does that apply to the electric and radiation damage as well?
---
I am currently on a server with multiple lvl 2-15 players, so I am dropping goodie bags with deep pocketed heavy leather armor, low level legendaries and diluted stimpacks for them. The hardest part is convincing them to approach the bag.
---
I have the 40% boost on a Super Sledge, and it's pretty great, but I can only imagine it on my preferred tiny stabby knives.
---
Why does it burn when I pee?
---
I get that a fair amount.  It’s annoying. Other than that little whine I got nothing for you....sorry.  Did I mention it’s annoying?
---
How can a Tesla rifle "explode".
---
\*Hands a quantum\* 
---
Can you explain to me what your end goal here is apart from being a smug and condescending? Also do you feel like you’re accomplishing anything? You’re exactly the type of player I’m glad isn’t playing the game. Let’s waste more of your time! Tell me more about how people aren’t allowed to enjoy things because of how you feel about them...
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKjxFJfcrcA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKjxFJfcrcA)
---
+60% for 5 ranks is better than the actual weapon perks, which each eat 3 ranks for 20%. Or is my math wrong? Or maybe it's not a direct increase like those?
---
LOL - bows it is!
---
Isn't the Blunderbuss the supposed shotgun variant? 
---
Does ANYONE actually use "Junkie" legendaries?  Perhaps there is something here we're all missing out on.
---
Pissing on fires will do that to ya
---
I think Camp Spawning is affected by passing creatures and PCs. Not sure where your camp is, but if it's in a high traffic area or near where critters spawn, try moving it away from that spot a bit.   
---
Someone posted the other day with same problem, but his camp was on the other side of the road from the Overseers camp, on the busted tent, which has at LEAST 3 spawn points within a very small area. I've seen scorched, robots, dogs, and even the elusive "downed satellite" show up in or very near to that little spot (to the right of the pickup truck as you head for Flatwoods). By the time you fully spawn in, whatever it was that was there may already be gone/dead. Otherwise, we'd be doing a Wicked Witch of the East/ Dorothy House-drop on randoms as we spawned in (which, admittedly, would be fun to get a picture of).   
---
My camp gets bumped a lot too, because my location is SO AWESOME that everyone wants to camp there once they find it.   
---
(on the plus side, I get to see a lot of alternate designs for my spot when I spawn in and see the other players version of "Camp Lead Deposit Watching CliffWatch")
---
Praise be to Nipple and Derpalerp!
---
[](/derp)
---
It's a more aesthetically pleasing combination than I thought it would be.
---
I bet your sleeping bag was on the ground.
---
Having to get my loot back isn't the issue. It's having my loot stolen by a non-pvp opponent that makes my frustrated.
---
Love that. Maybe a bloated ghoul that spawns already dead named Jim and another one that’s walking around it called Slim?
---
That was the guard lady outside Underworld right? It's been a looooong time since I've played that one. 
---
She is an unreliable resource for factual information. She has a strong ghoul bias that will (understanday) color her perspective. 
---
I dont doubt that the Brotherhood's triggerfingers are insanely itchy in the warzone of the Mall. Can you blame them? They are six feet from a trench warfare battle zone where at any moment anything could come around the obscured sightlines of the next corner and kill the shit out of you. 
---
Mm, not really. The Blunderbuss has identical dmg to the pistol I think, but with garbage range
---
Where was that drop ?
---
Cool. Upvoting because I like the idea.
---
Question, in the lore, the order had discussed aligning w/responders. Are you all going partner up or strictly stay responders?
---
This opens up the fire breathers as well.
---
Thanks! I’ll definitely try this.
---
I'm a new player and I am really enjoying it. Haven't seen any bad bugs or experienced any toxic players. So far its just been fun and cool people.
---
Ooh, I don't use  PA now but I guesd it's  unevitable. I'm lvl 107 and can't do endegame stuff. Respeccing but it's tedious.
---
He could have said that instead. Thank you for letting me know.
---
White spring nuke zone 
---
Honestly, not sure since I trashed it for my flint pistol
---
Your response sounds completely theoretical, I’m basing my information on facts in the writing of the game.
---
Yes rarely from treasure maps and Distant Thunder event in Cranberry
---
no chameleon unfortunately, but the legendary effect on the right leg is PER+1 and ‘up to +35 Energy and Dam. Resist w/ higher health’
---
I think one can be reliably found inside the diner at the east end of Watoga.
---
And for the record, I'm not at all saying they arn't assholes. Hell, they are the literal kings of the assholes. That's a military run superpower for you. Doesn't mean they are wrong. 
---
Yeah, mine is in sort of a high traffic area; there's a small creature spawn point nearby and it's by a road so occasional random events like the robot vender/Grahm come through. I forgot that I'd built something kind of fussy so I could have a dock in the river though, so it being unable to replicate the placement might have been why it was being weird tbh
---
As someone who had made them, board games are hard to make fun, balanced, unique, AND easy to understand.
---
...but putting rules to these games should definitely be someone's pet project and I would _love_ to play them, especially Blast Radius as it is pretty iconic.
---
It’s very easy to miss him sometimes. You’ll hear a strange hovering sound and then he’s gone. He’s not always hostile either so finding him like this makes him stick around a little longer while he tries to kill you. 
---
haha its the damn same still!! 
---
It's a video game mate.
---
I just found one of those the other night. It said club.
---
I have one of these and the brotherhood fatigues. Since the army looks nice and clean I might start wearing it now
---
cept now the greifers are level 300+
---
I have a legendary vampire lvl 50 10mm silenced pistol
---
I was gonna sell it but, each time it kills a target it heals me.
---
Too fun right now to sell.
---
Serious question, is there documentation regarding this? I would be interested in seeing it. I really dislike how they're vague on all of the damage modifiers.
---
I had thought to go with chameleon armor pieces instead of the mutation. Is there an advantage of relying on the mutation instead?
---
Didn't know the golf club had any mods. I just found a bone club the other night. I have still yet to see a tesla rifle.
---
There isn't an option on Xbox to open a combat log...does that exist on PC?
---
No thank you for not correcting me
---
I spelled few as fiew.
---
Yeah I think it’s different because they nerfed explosive damage on a TSE from 100% to 25%.
---
So I think that 60% demo expert only applies to the 25% not whole damage of the gun.
---
So if your gun did 100 damage then the demo expert would apply to 25 of that damage which would be about 15 extra damage. At least that’s my understanding of it.
---
Oh yeah. That last paragraph was a crazy stretch. 
---
My first point though I think is valid. 
---
You cant take someone's opinion as fact. 
---
A single "fact" even, that could easily be hyperbole. 
---
This might be obvious but I have been stumped when it comes to finding vendors that don't share a cap limit... Mainly because the only vendors I think of are the ones who are at the train stations, do you have any advice or suggested locations for finding alternative vendors?
---
Nice! What console are you using?
---
I met a newer player having some trouble with the Grafton monster on Grafton day. I made myself into a walking shield for them and helped them thin out the super mutants, bots and the Grafton monster. If I accidentally killed a monster I gave the player the loot. Let them reap the XP. I also offer to make them level appropriate weapons and armor if needed.
---
They're still forcing you into Power Armour and there aren't anymore quests.  
---
Lots of QoL improvements and other stuff.  I suggest reading the patch notes from Bethesda and seeing if the changes you wanted got implemented, theres about 15-20 patches by now.
---
It had seemed like some of the stats for Marine were less than Combat but I wasn't really sure. I appreciate the advice!
---
Bump.
---
Promoted my mule to alt and now back to main to finish quests I’ve done with alt. Lolz
---
I have several armor pieces that give plus 1 strength along with a rotation of chems like Fury and any of the Psycho variants also Mole Rat chunks will give you plus 1 strength and get a good legendary melee weapon executioners, instigating, anti-armor and you will be fine.
---
The armor. Do you have to find or loot it? Or can you craft it? Where can it be found
---
It's a flat value thay applies on every hit over a very short period of time.  It's not a massive amount, so for best results, it should be on a weapon that hits fast, like a knife or Minigun-type weapon.
---
I don't know how it works with a Tesla weapon.
---
I think you might have to use the crystalizing barrel (sometimes called long barrel) to get the freezing effect on her. Not certain about that though.
---
I could pass full gaming sessions without anything but farming would be going on. Just got to catch the tide in the right time. Lol
---
I am on XBOX One...and did the same...bought at launch....couldn't get into it.  Game is much more stable now, in fact I have not been disconnected in a couple of weeks now.  I have not run into the griefing issue, if anything, i see the opposite...high level players wanting to chip in and help low level people, or just give away their extra stuff.  I don't know if the experience is much different on PS or PC.....but if you enjoyed fallout 4 I think fo76 is in a good spot finally.
---
Upvoting because you’re in a great area.
---
You’re gonna need a sign though 
---
There are two. Club is a Medium speed wpn, Hammer is the larger Slow speed wpn. Both can be bought from Raider vendors sometimes too, if you're looking.
---
I would have killed him. 
---
I would have killed his friend. 
---
I would have killed his friends' friend. 
---
I would have killed his pet mirelurk.
---
And worst of all, I would have found his camp, opened all of his doors and windows, and turned off all of his lights.
---
And that was Lyon's faction too
---
You cant use the biggest group of boyscout glory warriors in the entire Brotherhood as much evidence as to how shitty the entire Brother is 
---
Where do yo7 guys get the plans ?
---
I have home defense lvl2
---
I was not aware of that service, as I pretty much only game on PC. I know in the Before Time, the Long Long Ago, you needed two copies or were forced to use a guest account and split screen. 
---
Oh yeah, forgot about the actual legendary damage increase nerf itself, ha. Was misremembering and thinking that only the perk got a nerf
---
I’m on Xbox 
---
You are not wrong....but I have to wonder if Bethesda is holding back on this because of potential backlash.  If they had been dropping a lot of content in the store while the game struggled everyone would accuse them of a cash grab.  Hopefully now that the game is in a better state we will see more options.
---
Aw. Okay. I'm on Playstation.
---
Dont forget to swipe the tatos.
---
It’s improved since launch. It’s still needs work but it’s better. We are getting dlc in March so coming back now might be a good thing
---
i run healing factor mutation which only heals outside of battle.  I didn't know that initially but also attached great mutations.  This being the case i don't think light footed is necessary.  I run Lone wander Max when solo and Rejuvinated when not radiated to max my ap refresh.
---
I'll probably run gun Smith 3 and demo expert 1 in nuke zones and demo expert 4 when able to easily repair my weapon.  
---
I run bird bones eagle eyes marsupial speed demon carnivore unstable isotope electrically grounded healing factor chameleon grounded and plague walker. And love em all, though lately I've been thinking unstable isotope probably heals Gouls I've never noticed. 
---
Yes.  The Penalty happens when you go 1500 lbs above your carry weight.  So if your character has a carry weight of 400 lbs, you can carry up to 1900 lbs before hitting the max limit.
---
Yeah, that is pretty much all they are worth.
---
Ok..will u be on all day? I should be on in a few hours 
---
Then I'd suspect you'll find a lot to like in 76.
---
Bountys are mostly traps nowadays 
---
With healing factor a bloody build is not too practical i think so was advised to try furious or anti armor so keep that in mind if you decide to use that mutation.
---
Sometimes he sells the larger Bone Hammer too. They're really not that uncommon 🤣
---
Sorry, its been so long since I did those quests, I just remembered it had something to do with mayor in the quest title. Couldn't remember which, and just figured it was the grafton quest since most got it at like level 25 and watoga is mainly for 40+ people
---
That only works sometimes sadly. 
---
I understand, also we can’t really say the Brotherhood of Steel is this or that. There are so many chapters and they don’t all share the same beliefs. It seems that each elder has their own rules.
---
We need more places like Watoga in my opinion. Dense locations with more interiors for farming. There's only like 3 cities and they would actually benefit more from nukes as each interior is affected as well
---
I'm not home ATM I'm out with my kids right now.
---
In order to use "Junkies" effectively you would have to be able to get and maintain addictions.  Which is currently not very possible since it appears they reset when you log out, and take a lot to actually get.
---
I believe it's sold at the Sutton or Charleston station it's one of those it's like 250 caps

I saw a vid on the tube with someone running the effect. Seemed to be doing ok.

Lvl 50 Anti Armor Gatling Gun makes short work of cargo bots.

This also happens when the camp machine is picked up and placed in a location where the terrain interferes with it's placement upon reload. For example, if a large rock that was there originally, gets bulldozed, you can then place your camp machine there. When the game reloads, it loads the terrain first, then tries to place your camp, but can't. That's why I tell people to be careful about moving their camp machine around. I've had mixed results replicating this, but have found one method to replicate this behavior every time. Lay down a foundation, set the camp machine on top, then pick up the foundation and place it underwater. I guarantee you'll never see your camp again (also a way to be able to move your camp for free) can't say for sure this is what is happening with you, just a possible explanation.
---
Not an issue, what later time works for you?
---
Didn’t realize there were two versions! Do they share the same model? 
---
Whenever I encounter those I dramatically jump around the wanted player while doing the finger guns emote and saying "pew pew pew" over the mic. They usually leave after a few minutes :-)
---
Drop down a level of maybe long shot or even one of your damage cards for Concentrated Fire. Shooting someone in the face with Vats will increase your damage by +50%-100%.
---
I also get the feeling that critical sneak vats builds should use automatic receivers as each consecutive hit is considered a critical. 6-12 criticals vs 1 critical per use seems way better.
---
Also consider fireproof and blocker for defense.
---
Sorry friend, somebody just bought it. Thanks for your interest though!
---
For me (PS4) the clean ones would go under the armor, dirty on top. I like the dirty ones better plus they hide the full Marine armor kit I'm wearing
---
Get friends and a mic.
---
I think it would be the opposite. If they released those high-quality power-armor skins right now, a lot of people would forget about the issues because they look cool. 
---
I honestly feel like with the way Bethesda is handling their flash sale's right now it is a cash grab. There throwing sales on items people never bought in the first place because they were so expensive. It's like there trying to throw a sale at us and say "please buy this, the numbers are doing terrible". 
---
That's why i made this thread. These flash sales are hardly even sales because the items are so lack luster to begin with. 
---
Oh ok thx
---
That’s how I play.
---
I think that's part of it too, yes.
---
I'm not that fussed about it because I accumulate Atoms in gameplay faster than I find things I want to spend them on, so it kind of works out.
---
Yeah I looked for a high rated dude, it was just 10 bucks, I wasn't too afrid of losing it if it was fake anyways
---
Some of us live there because our beautiful, twisted weapons demand it.

whoa whoa don't bring the mirelurk into this thats just savage

There is ONE other benefit to the chameleon mutation in PvP. (To contrast with the massive drawback of the mutation in PvP :P)
---
The mutation makes no noise when it triggers, the armor does. 
---
If only there was a way to convey your voice to friends and/or nearby players. 
---
Workshops. Events. I get like 40 from workshop events and lots of radaway
---
They should add text chat. Not everyone wants to talk on a mic.
---
I diddnt start playing until about 2 months ago. So i wouldnt know how bad it was at launch but it seems to have cleared up very nicely. The game as it is right now is possibly in its best state so far, much needed server stability has been improved and countless bugs have been fixed.
---
no thanks, i dont play fallout games to hear fatty eating cheetos in the mic
---
And that could be okay if you make the payout worth it, but if it's just doing the same percentage more in damage that a hunters or instigating effect would have....then it's useless.  Fodder for the legendary vendor. (Which I can't wait for btw)
---
Outside of a few damage display mods in fallout 4 not really. And event then I have to admit I am not 100% sure it works how it did in fallout 4. I just know the numbers from some boarderlands like damage display mod. so that is my base line.
---
Same, tbqh
---
I figure that anonymity is intentional. 
---
If one faction falls (such as whatever you call the 76 version) then the whole command structure wont be destroyed as well. 
---
There are still apparently High Elders back in California that at least Maxon (FO4) was reporting back to. 
---
Text chat would be helpful for cross map communications. I get a lot of team invites that just fast travel to me and immediately disband. At least with text chat they can be courteous about it.
---
No the Hammer is a bit bigger and has a bigger nobbly end
---
Morgantown airport in the medical area. Pharma pharma perk helps.
---
What would the mass of scope have to do with anything? That does not affect your AP
---
that is how it seemed to work in fallout 4, and I don't think they changed the system in fallout 76 and even with it increasing the other way that is still around 2-3k per shot.

At 20 you can equip a complete set of Raider PA (Lvl 15+) and start hinting some parts of Sh Heep and Savage Divide, but if a high-level player comes into your area the enemies will start spawning at much higher levels.

Max earnings per day is 200 caps per Vendor faction, so 1400 once you have access to the Enclave.

I've been curious about this too.  How much more damage does a power attack actually do?
---
To me, it seems entirely random.  Sometimes I'll stroll through Watoga and not have a single bot be legendary.  Other times it will only be one or two.  But sometimes I encounter 5 or 6.  Of course, I don't know how this compares to before I finished Mayor for a Day because I was too busy running haha
---
I joined somebody who said that ps4 community if it was a trap jokes on them, i went from zero caps to 480
---
Sometimes when I get marsupial I'm down to 10% health and too terrified of loosing my jumpy boi ability to take a radaway. At least 90% of the time, nothing is able to hit me. Super Mutants would be a threat if they weren't thrown in to a pathfinding tizzy the moment I leap on a roof.
---
Well, he’s probably got 50 health. So a decent vats headshot crit only has to do 200ish HP damage to kill him. Which if you remove crit and headshot that’s only 50 base damage. Add in his armor and other % damage reduction effects, and you need more than that, but counter it with armor penetration and the fact that most weapons have vastly more than 50 base damage, and yeah. 
---
It’s more for PvE, but it helps in PvP too; a sniper may not be VATS targetable at first since they’re sneaking/in Chameleon, which means you can’t do crits, and may not be able to hit a headshot. 
---
That'd be great.
---
Who is forcing you into PA? There is no need to use PA at all unless you go to nuked zones.
---
Here put a potato on your jeans. The starch helps if you’re lucky. 
---
Now I will.  Thank you.
---
Hahaha I like this!
---
Definitely get adrenaline though.  Idk if it was because it was before the last big Nerf but i had my adrenaline going,  and as a scorch beast climbed out the fissure i switched to my instigating dragon and critical shot their head and they died,  one shot. even before i added bloody mess.  It was pretty epic
---
It’s not their fault
---
I think the mod randomly shows up at the Watoga and Harper's Ferry vendors.
---
I honestly find the bright version a bit annoying and kind of regret adding it, but I play in third-person.
---
And you don't get what a good game is. If you say red Dead is overrated and defend 76, your opinion is terrible. 
---
That's more so what I was wondering.  Cause if you're running low health, I didn't think the 75% damage reduction would offer much support 
---
Just my opinion but if they show up once and kill you, they could have easily just happened to be nearby. If they come back and repeatedly kill you with no other intention, that's griefing.
---
Huh interesting, that looks like it will come in handy. Thanks!
---
It would make it so much easier than the current -Look up player in global search,  click player, type message,  send  message - that is likely to get you eaten by feral ghouls.
---
And the nukezones is the endgame.
---
So if you like endgame/SBQ, you must wear PA.  I tried hazmat suit but you're just to fragile.
---
I had to rebuild my whole unarmed loadout into rifles to have a chance.  Then the rifle nerf happened.  Now I await an unarmed endgame patch, lolz
---
I can’t cook them either or their eggs which is weird...I can’t even find the recipe for it under the options when using a cooking station.
---
Understandable, it is really bright, but that's why I like it lol. And thank you!
---
It's new to me
---
I’m excited to go see the nobbly end 
---
What’s tatos, precious?
---
I dont think there are plans for head lamps. I think mods are still random, so id just keep checking phoenix, Harper ferry, and watoga station.
---
The bright headlamp is blinding now, I had to go back to the normal headlamp.
---
I just logging off. My time and mats are more important then wasting it on asshats.
---
Agreed, had not thought of it, but will now...great idea.
---
*Strong loved that*
---
well, there's a LOT of synergies with low-health builds. Both for dishing and avoiding damage. Look up Serendipity perk.
---
That's as good as that Ghoul Hunter's Wardrum I got in a drop. 
---
40% more power attack damage
---
+30% damage to ghouls
---
Reduces target's damage output for 3seconds.
---
Probably around monday morning as my kids and I are taking the weeked to go visit family.
---
Watoga Station, Watoga Shopping Plaza, Enclave bunker, the Whitespring Station, Flatwoods just to name a few. Hope this helps.
---
They're plastic.
---
Well I visited 3/4 places where cores are located and none were present. They’re not everywhere.
---
Neither example is griefing to me.
---
To me, griefing requires a certain degree of willful harassment.  Constantly going after a single player who has expressed no intention of fighting back, for example.  Especially if they quit and end up getting followed to another server.
---
Yeah, kinda wish they hadn't buffed it to hell. It's crazy, but I kind of got used to it
---
Yeah this is how I run it with my wife and I. We only have one psn account. Basically my psn is available to anyone on my home console and it also follows me to any console I sign in as a guest on.
---
agreed!!
---
I like the thought.  I will do that as well.  Well played.
---
Make throwing knives with it and drop those.  Or bulk it and sell it.  Get some use out of that weight lol.
---
then don't be friends with cheetos eating fatties?
---
Nice! I work weekdays, my Mon/Wed/Fri evenings and weekends (pacific time) are my available times. 
---
Oh, gotcha. I know exactly where you can find a group of three that will consistently spawn. It's kind of hard to describe because it's an unmarked location but it's near West Tek. Go there and start heading directly west up the mountain. There's a fairly easy to climb path you can follow, it shouldn't require any jumping. The spot you're looking for is near the end of the semi picture on the map.
---
The location is a little pond with a locked door leading over a bridge to an outhouse. The point is surrounded by spikes. There will pretty much always be three mongrels around it.
---
If you find a spot with some vegetables and a bathtub full of fuel cans you need to go further up the mountain.
---
Yeah.  It still gave me a sensible chuckle.  Saw one for sell on ebay for $5.  Actually thought about it as it will be a fun collector item.
---
Do the daily challenges. You can get around 50 to 60 atoms every day if you do the challenges. Add in the weekly and character challenges and you can make a few hundred every week without even trying hard. If you want to grind, you can pick up a couple of thousand in a week. There's nothing there that I'm dying for. I've picked up some stuff, but it's been mostly camp stuff. 
---
Hmmm. I can get Eso morrowind for 8$ on greenman gaming right now. Maybe time to check it out.
---
If you are in a pinch, id just go buy bloodpacks from a vendor (around 40 caps). Use super duper and chemist.
---
Events, Morgantown Airport, and AVR Medical.  If you have Pharma Farma in Luck, you should find a decent supply during natural exploration.
---
I see, yeah the brotherhood of steel will most likely never fall because of their numbers across the U.S. There are chapters like Maxson’s that assert dominance across the wasteland and ones like McNamara’s that try to stay hidden and isolated to survive.
---
I understood what you meant XD I'm not one of THOSE XD
---
Taggerdy says it once or twice I think, and Vendor Bot Phoenix says "Ad Victoriam, Soldier" if you're wearing BoS clothing or armour.

Prob not shit game
---
Workshops are PVP zones. Anyone thinking otherwise is wrong. It warns you before taking a workshop that anyone can initiate PVP on you. I'm surprised no one has made a surprised Pikachu meme about this yet.
---
My primary source of random scrap is PVP. Last week I got 300 lbs of scrap from three separate encounters. All three encounters were in workshops.  We do this for gains. Caps and scrap. We're all looking for ways to fuel our machine. Passive workshops are fast, but taking someone else's shit is faster.
---
There is no set definition for griefing in this game. Literally everything is fair game and by design. Contesting workshops, murdering low level people, goading people to attack you, it is all fair game. That being said, I do not see much profit in killing someone level 5. They won't have much scrap, they barely give any caps, and you wager way too many of your own if you die. I only go for people I think have a lot to give me. People in excavator power armor typically have a lot of scrap. I hunt them down. High level people? I hunt them down.
---
hehehe i think i might just have to do that!
---
I want to build a shack and fill it with giddyup buttercups, also I wish there were those monkey with cymbals, I would totally put those everywhere 
---
I just don't want to have to keep chipping away at my base just to add a few more things 
---
Im a filthy casual and proud of it! :)
---
Me too
---
And folks wonder why girls have such issues with body image. 😂
---
But whether it is “right” or “wrong” in a philosophical sense. Great job drawing it. Always keep growing your talent OP.
---
There might be less confusion and hurt feeling if you could not claim a workshop while in pacifist mode. 
---
I do not begrudge anyone who wants to pvp and understand that I am taking a risk by taking a workshop. I learned that the annoying way though. Very few respect pacifist mode.
---
Once I had enough plans I stopped claiming workshops because I got tired of being ganked during a defend mission.
---
I found a Bone Club or something like that. I think they snuck some things in during the last uodate
---
I like the idea of making the paper bags into the Vault tec lunchboxes
---
I understand what you mean by following players who don't want to fight back. But you do think it's acceptable for a level 127 player to attack a level 12 player? I'm just curious not attacking you. I just find it hard to accept that a kill by a player 115 levels higher than you is somehow okay. 
---
I love it! Will start doing as well!
---
🤣 I'll snag a photo of both if I'm online later, for comparison
---
Go on back to watching brooklyn99 from your moms basement.
---
Noted and added to my repertoire.
---
I remembered how when i started playing, a random player gifted me some radaway and purified water which saved me, so I like to hope i can make other players get that warm and fuzzy feeling as well!
---
How about a Dark Souls answer where you don't even get meaningful rewards for invasions.
---
When it comes to role playing it's simply about making it fun for both parties. It's about sportsmanship.
---
For me personally that means organizing like minded equally skilled players for workshop PVP but for some reason most of you hate using reddit for something so logical so i guess you're all griefers, or soft.
---
No one really cares that much about a few caps we're all just here for reciprocal fun.

A nicely wrapped present-- 4 mines taped together.
---
It's a lot better than it was. They stopped most of the duping, and server stability is a hell of a sight better. I remember crashes and ungodly lag and all of that mess just a few weeks ago. I couldn't play for an hour without crashing. Yesterday, I played a 7 hour set and not a single crash. While lag is still an issue in some areas, I think it's a lot better than it was. I am once again enjoying the game like it should be. I can't wait for the new content coming. 
---
This. A fast firing weapon will keep your health full. A vampiric Dragon is... not useful.
---
From the Fallout wiki:
---
&gt; This game is published by the Don't Be Bored Games Company in the years before the Great War and is for ages 5 to 29. A text blurb describes the game as "an exciting new board game that brings friends, family, and nuclear explosions together. The first player to make it to a safe distance will survive. The rest will perish. Do you have what it takes?"
---
&gt;A board/dice game, where the board is divided into twelve sections with the middle holding a nuclear mushroom cloud spinner. Spinning it will make the arrow point to one of the sections, each having three layers with a circle containing a certain outcome or action to be taken by the player character.
---
Thought that was only for pictures? Didnt see any salute emote when I looked through them. 
---
The person who 4v1 those people was already pinged, I'm sure they will respond today so won't even have to wait to get on and prove it. As I don't like sharing my username on reddit as I have lots of stalkers that hate me.
---
Oh I thought you meant they force you to wear PA all the time. I also tried wearing the hazmat suit but it was impossible to stay alive.
---
Try twitch.tv or one of the Discord groups or reddit chat. You could solve this today or complain for a life time.
---
Just completed a trade with seafog. Very nice guy. Offered some very helpful advice regarding perks to use with the gun I purchased as well as providing a very nice gun.

I find them in the north part of the map at the civil war museum. Just south west of the fort.
---
It absolutely did in FO4, I haven't tested in FO76 but I've no reason to assume it's not the same.
---
Wait, I get it. I think what HE meant by "massive scope" was a "long scope". The higher magnitude the scope, the more AP the gun uses. I only use a Medium scope on dedicated sniper rifles; other guns are reflex scopes or short recon scopes.  
---
The Vegas Brotherhood were more open, they just lost a war right before you meet them. They are hiding to replenish their numbers a bit. 
---
Even though I disagree I still upvoted your comment. I think killing anyone several levels lower than you, even if it's only once, is unacceptable. I do agree with you that repeatedly killing someone is griefing though.
---
No, there’s a salute one. It’s under the hello/wave one, so you have to hover over that one and then hit expand or whatever. Forgot how much it costs though. 
---
I think he's playing "I'll Be Watching You"
---
I would have to call BS on his claim of not knowing your level, no one at level 100+ should be stupid enough to contest a workshop without locating the owner first to see their level as well as location.
---
The other part people don't understand about workshops is that claiming one automatically puts you in PvP mode regardless of your pacifist setting, so it's not slap damage you are receiving when they attack.
---
hahah this is the stuff this game was meant for i swear
---
If I remember right, Blunderbuss’s main selling point is it’s faster to reload? Don’t take my word for it though

I found a bayonet mod for a missile launcher recently

Oh, my character looks greasy and unwashed, so you might be onto something. He is kind of a wasteland hobo who is packing serious firepower while stumbling around looking for stuff to sell. Say, that is a nice carpet you got there, really ties the room together.
---
Okay. I know you are pretty clear on not using mods, but there is a reason people keep asking. Your symptoms match identically with people who are using mods or have used them in the past. So forgive me for asking, but have you used them in the past? Tried one out but didn't like it so you deleted it? Halfway install one? Have someone with access to your computer who may have tried one out? Just covering bases here. Now I don't know much about the install process or how it works, but it may have been possible for your ini file to get messed up or corrupted during the update, or something to the effect. Either way the fix would probably be the same. My advice is to look at those threads - they have a fix posted. And try to follow the steps anyways. 
---
New window who dis.

U can also ask here every few days!!!

They won’t read this and they don’t care. But I care. So there is that.

for leveling purposes i find hopping into power armour asap helps.  you can start equipping it at 15 with raider PA.  level 20 i think is t45?  all PA scales on a 10 level scale, so some are 15, 25, and others 20, 30 etc.  focus on your damage and what not and replacement your defenses as you level up.  or just live in power armour.  even at newb levels while in full PA and drugs you can live in a nuke zone with management, so killing glowing ones can be done.
---
putting a perk or two into a melee option is a good solution to level.  you can pick so many perks in the long run that 2-3 wont set you back.  optimize to your overall strength available.  i have 15 str and 6 perception so i can slot 3x rifleman/commando perk variations for ranged.  you could potentially reverse this to achieve an optimized ranged build.  
---
im level 131 and i only use PA for nuke zones or high rad areas.  i only made this adjustment around level 80 or 90.  it can be done much sooner if thats you're thing.  
---
Literally 😊
---
I said it is a valid suggestion, but not if I don't want to involve or depend on others to do the killing, or to force them to play around my inability to kill the monsters (ie low level jumping into high level nuke zone unable to solo running around like headless chicken until someone feels sorry and saves me). I said in my original post it has to be solo and not depend on others to make the kills, did you even read and understand that before giving a thumbs up to rcmans advice? I didn't say you are a dick, but that anyone who wanders into a SBQ fight expecting to just tag things with a shitty weapon and getting the rewards whilst boosting the health of the queen, is a dick because they are making her harder to kill and not contributing in any way. If you still think your strategy is valid even at that extreme (the toughest fight), and would use it yourself, then fine you are a dick to me for thinking that. 
---
But way to twist my words that I was calling you a dick for not agreeing with you because I consider leeching bad mannered in this particular instance where I have decided I can only solo and kill for myself.
---
Targeting someone over and over again until they leave the server. That’s the short answer for me. It’s the same logic as “if you’re getting bullied online turn off the computer.” Stay on the server and take the slaps, and you’re just enabling them. If you two duke it out and then send emotes to each other to show that you’re good now and wanna part ways, then that’s just casually playing against someone else.

  The forest is your friend.   Do events and explore to level up.   
---
Learn what weapons are most effective against which type of critter.
---
At L18, you should be able to do toxic valley - although once in a while, a critter quite capable of using your carcass to wipe the map will appear there.
---
Depending on whether high levels have been around, the western edge of the savage divide (path of the winds, top of the world) are doable.
---
Parts of the Ash Heap will get you in trouble fast, as will Whitesprings.
---
You can play "solo" in as much as you can declining team invites and not responding to voice call-outs, but by design, some things are made easier by being in a group.  
---
That and as much as you read about griefers and such, there are also a number of people that would rather help you than harm you.
---
I like this but it needs some diminishing returns or everyone would easily get everything they want. 
---
Maybe make 6 cards into a pack, that the person who opens it gets 4 from. This way you can’t just keep at it until you get all your cards, as some get lost. 
---
Just because we can tame certain things, doesn't mean we should. 
---
Sorry, it.. happened?  Don't know why the trolling.  I mean the weapons probably aren't legendary but I don't know.  Maybe I'm being too shortsided, though thought I did okay in a 3 on 1 with a guy 20 levels above.  I DID end up getting killed at the end, so, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I just walk up and down from flatwoods and the overseer's camp making healing salve.
---
I'm rather new myself (just reached 21). Scorchbeasts were the flying things, right? I've seen one circle around Morgantown airport and while I was scared for a moment, it didn't seem to do anything much other than, well, make rounds in the air. Is this one a fluke?
---
For sure. I'd rather encourage OP than criticize them and make them self conscious.
---
I don't think that OP meant anything by the way they made their drawing either way and it seems odd to insert the problems of others into OP's personal artistic development.
---
I’ve seen a huge amount of low levels in the past month on Xbox, set up a camp on the road to Flatwoods if you want to chat with them and help them out. It gets lots of traffic and is a route for graham 
---
Orly? I honestly don't think I remembered to check that. Guess I know what I'm testing on the next Blunderbuss I find, thanks for the idea 👍 I was basically just super disappointed by it before but maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised
---
In what way did I edit my title? 
---
How do you make it instigating?
---
If all the good junk workshops are taken by low level players and I go take one I'm not griefing. I'm using my advantage and that low level player can go PvP another workshop and take that one. Workshops are invitations for PvP and while I try not to kill lower level players ever - sometimes I have to. Griefers don't feel slightly guilty though. I do.
---
I've done this a few times at prime, you'd think I'd learn. The last time I happened I took a pic to remind myself of the dangers and its the only pic on that console so it's shows most loading screens. 
---
I found it as a 1 star legendary drop
---
You should have said : "f*** you metal man!" Like the guy at whitesprings 😂 Good laugh though 
---
It's very unsportsmanlike, but no one would ever accuse Raiders of caring about that.
---
I found him in that exact spot, I think it may be a spawn where he looks over the town below
---
The last update kind of broke the camel's back. 
---
They just haven't addressed basic QoL issues (non-bugs), they haven't fixed any major bugs, there's no content, and in my opinion most importantly, there's just *zero* communication from Rockstar.
---
It seems like it has no direction, and the few things that they have added are things that no one wants.
---
&gt; Tell the truth you downvoted everyone and you'd be toxic to Bethesda if they bothered to reply to this petty trash.
---
Nah. Downvoting is a waste of time and I don't bother the Bethesda social media guys either.
---
It might be coming with cameras in the next month
---
Nah, it just happened so late in the game that I didnt have the supplies or perks to build a useful suit.
---
I crafted lvl 45 Excavator and then gave up.
---
Hopefully the new content offers more viable builds for late game.
---
Thanks. Ill have to check when I get home. From what Im seeing through google is thats from the tri-centennial edition which I didnt purchase. 
---
I love my booze in game, have an entire murder hobo/Mistress of Mysteries build around debauchery and dumb luck. 
---
I genuflect in your presence. 
---
Nice man, good guy
---
I bought nms literally blind because IIRC it was 30 bucks new.
---
I had a blast and didnt understand the majority of complaining.
---
"Hepped up on Waste Land Juice" I was laughing so hard I almost had a tear in my eye. But vault dwellers don't cry unless they are getting spammed by multiple Scorched Beast doing sonic screech attacks and your excavator power armor  legs are broken and you are overweight now looking for a hiding spot so you don't lose your junk.
---
You may not see profit in killing a lvl 5 but there's plenty of high level players that do it anyway. I'm currently not playing F76 anymore but when I last played I created my third character so I was a low level character with experience in the game. Once my third character hit level 5 and it was like putting a big neon sign on that said "attack me" and while in low level areas (like flatwoods) I was being attacked by players well above lvl 100. They may not gain anything from the attacks, it's just fun for them. So I'm just trying to ask is it okay for me to call these guys griefers? Sure they didn't follow me when I fast traveled away from the area, but I have a feeling that if I stuck around they would have repeatedly attacked me. 
---
This. Look at his other YouTube videos. 3 of his videos are exploit/glitch videos. Seem like a legit player to you?
---
I saved my video of me falling lol my friend fell a couple weeks ago and I thought “how much of a space case do you have to be” and now here I am :/
---
I usually leave my extra unwanted items in the cash register at the artisan in whitesprings, or whatever vendor I’m at at the time 
---
I’m saving my jangles the moon monkey 
---
I knew they planned on adding to the limit you can store in your camp, but they never mentioned budget. I honestly wouldn't get my hopes up considering having 24 people at max on one server. 
---
Yes. That one is part of an event. Any other scorchbeast you encounter WILL attack if it notices you.
---
I dont mess with the trade inerface.  
---
  On the occasion I break radio silence for more than just a "hello, no threat, just passing through" type comment as I walk by, I'll ask if the player need anything. 
---
   I know more or less whats in my inentory - If I have it to spare, I'll drop it....and hope they wil honestly reciprocate, if I need anything at the time.
---
  In the case ol single digit characters, If they don't run, I'll tell them I'm dropping (weapons, aid, whatever) and to retrieve the bag.
---
Put us into pvp with whoever loots our death bags so we can beat the shit out of them
---
For the term griefing I define it as this: anyone who chooses between an objective and player kills. If the attacking player shows up at say Wade Airport. You have already claimed it and are running around looting the place. If they go straight for you and kills with ease and waits for you to respawn and precedes to kill you again and ignores the workshop that is griefing. 
---
As he could have took the place with little to no effort. 
---
If a player is stalking you and attacks your camp (which has very little to gain as it’s a bullet sink) that’s griefing. 
---
If they hit you and you return fire the griefing rules doesn’t apply. 
---
You’re still able to get all of that stuff. I mean I got that thinking that it’d be exclusive, but...nah, it’s for everyone last I checked. 
---
Based on your utter fearlessness, I can only assume that "Disconnecting before someone can kill me" is part of your "Totally not griefing" repertoire.
---
Watoga emergency Services. Equip the perk that lets you search containers and you can walk away with 8-12 stims 
---
Jesus christ. So the first one you meet is supposed to lure you in a false sense of security. Well, I'm going to make sure to keep away from them as much as I can.
---
How strong are they compared to other stuff on the same level? When do I need to run and when can we try to engage it? As a pointer, my brother and I managed to kill a 40ish glowing wendigo (and a few 30ish ones as well, but they were less of a hassle).
---
that is a good point.
---
especially the rug in the living room.. It really ties the room together....
---
That’s a fair answer to a vague question.  The responses in the thread make me think I would enjoy it just for exploring the world. I think for $30 it’s a low risk and I’ll give it a try. 
---
I thought a switchblade was better than a combat knife. Conversely, a knife with swing speed is the fastest weapon in the game, even over "v fast" weapons. They have their spot, can deal just as much damage in the same amount of time as some two-handers
---
You... Still don't get what an opinion is, do you?
---
Iv gotten a few 3 star weapons and every single one only has one buff, its awesome!
---
You may be able to buy the emotes separate, but it’s definitely attached to the Tricentennial Edition. 
---
I haven't seen this green thick boi, since the first week this game.came out. Too bad.inwas broke as a joke, and couldn't buy anything!
---
A truly humbling experience 
---
&gt; Roleplaying as a BoS character, 
---
This is one faction that it's kind of sad to try and roleplay as. They have an actual, still existing structure and organization that no one in Appalachia can join now that the pre Plague ones are dead. Maxson is never going to contact you and all you can do is rummage through the trash and corpses and try to playact as one of them through a distorted understanding of what they were.
---
Odds are, in one or two generations, your descendants will start to lose the plot.
---
A few generations after that, they might be the Gunners.
---
Life can be frustrating because it is unfair.
---
Cool location/journey but all three were untamable. 
---
There should be an panel in the pip-boy for RobCo text features.  It would be cool to see. A feature that only Vault 76 pip-boy 2000 could have. 
---
Not everyone wants to play Wasteland Instant Messenger either ;)
---
Are you also aware that the “new” version completely breaks with Strange in Numbers? 
---
100% some people enjoy pvp, whether that be against higher levels, same levels, or lower levels. 
---
The willful harassment part is the foundation of what should be considered griefing. A few minutes a taunting players with the glove slap pvp system shouldn’t be considered griefing whereas following a person through several severs, sending derogatory messages, and following a single player to the ends of the earth for 30 minutes is. 
---
The new pvp severs will help quite a bit, though on the flip side receiving explicit message from players that fight back gets old fast. Being shitty to people in general because the enjoy different aspects of the game (short of harassment)  whether that’s building a base or destroying a base is just juvenile. 
---
Thanks for the detailed post. The idea I had was to level up to 15 in order to use various 200% repaired automelee weapons and Raider PA at Whitesprings to solo it forcing respawns, before 15 would be using an OP melee weapon. It was basically how to get to 15 faster and if there were any other strats, places, spawns etc people could suggest. So I think I'll follow your advice up to level 15, then try out my automelee approach with increasingly powerful sets of gear in the wings as I increase my level. Though I won't tag mobs simply because as per my original post I will not depend on others and will solo (for me that means making my own kills).
---
no cause you can only tame animals at the "random event" spawns. That location you tamed him at has a chance for different random events you will just have to hope it shows up there again
---
I hear monanga? Is a good replacement for nuke mob farming. 
---
Ayyyy!
---
it's not just being alone it has to be at one of those specific random event locations
---
It is very bugged with strange and Numbers IF IN A GROUP. If you are NEAR them, and have SiN equipped, Adrenal does zero bonus damage. If you are FAR from them, suddenly you start doing REDUCED damage. If you unslot SiN, it goes back to normal. If you aren’t in a group, it doesn’t affect it. 
---
Eh.
---
Arguably more, given the penchant of certain enemies of blocking attacks.
---
Shadowed arms and legs. Rng hates me
---
Yea do side quest and events to level up to get better guns 
---
But some stuff is one day only.  i was lucky to be home when they released Blackbird power armor. 
---
Is there any complete list of mods and weapons that are in the game? Just asking to have a checklist.
---
I have two legendary guitar swords from legendary drops and use them quite often. Twang!
---
Agreed
---
The ones who complain claim they don’t play but still actively troll a Fallout 76 reddit 
---
What the F*** 🤬 WHY are you still posting hate about a game you don’t play?
---
Huh. It certainly did in FO4. My aversion to the long scope in 76 was for different reasons (way too zoomed in to be useful given the actual damage range for guns, as well as render distance, in this game)
---
Agreed- what I’d love more of is a place with dense enemies, some legends ties, in a short walk of full set of workbenches and even better if there’s a vendor nearby. (Or upcoming legendary vendor). To me, it’s the combination of those things in a close area that makes WS special 
---
Yes just google legendary weapon affects 
---
Yeah it’s a awesome place but only if ghouls spawn there. And once you kill all the ghouls none of them respawn unless a player joins the server.
---
I have always just joined in on the action. Just be prepared she has some serious health I am a melee build and always bring a few instruments of my trade along with a Anti Armor Gatling gun.
---
Apparently nukes actually do affect the inside of buildings. People just need to test more places out.
---
Oh, I know it’s part of the tricen package. But I also know my friends that got the standard version also have that emote. 
---
Ad Victoriam, brother. 
---
SPOOOON!
---
Hopefully they’ll realise how much revenue they’re losing from the atom store with such restrictive camp budget. I’ve got items I can’t place that I’ve bought and I’m not buying anything else until I can place what I’ve bought already. I’ve heard other players echoing this for some time now.
---
Yer outta yet element, Donnie.
---
Go back to the forest and do your time. Ain't nobody got time to do your homework for you.
---
They should add a city in toxic valley or something or colonize the bridge near that one ice cream shop. Let places change overtime or something.
---
The ammo factory in the north makes various types of ammo
---
You can help me!

I’m debating which to use. Have a 3 star ski sword, 3 star death tambo and this club
---
You owe it to yourself to play the older fallout games.  4 is good, but IMO (and most others) 3 and New Vegas are better.  
---
Fallout and Fallout 2 are also fun, but they are in a different top down style instead of the modern first/third person style that started in 3.  So that bothers some people when they go back to them.
---
You can skip tactics and brotherhood of steel though.
---
For level 10's?
---
If you ask me that’s how nukes should be. Treat it like a workshop. Kill the defending mobs and loot and forage and whatnot b
---
I was stalked once by two players who knew I was returning from flux gathering (saw them in the Blast Zone) they started attacking my camp so I would engage them, I killed them both several times before they managed to get me, but received less caps than they got from me for 1 kill, then they stole the Flux I had just crafted, and logged out.
---
I do have their GTs and will get even (Revenge is a dish best served Cold an Unexpected), but it should not have been able to happen that way in the first place
---
My friends and I have discussed the very same thing. Some things are only in my CAMP because they were Atomic Purchases making me feel obligated to use them
---
Once you hit level 50 levels don't really matter. So your 55 and his 76 are pretty much the same. 
---
And no trolling, just don't believe your story.
---
You can craft it.  Its the marine wet suit and marine tactical mask.  I make them all the time and drop them off for low levels.
---
Trust me, you don't want it.  Stupid thing turns itself on every time you fast travel to your camp.  It's gets extremely annoying, extremely fast.
---
A tinker’s workbench. Great low-level place for lead: the motel in Flatwoods, or even better is the gym in the Charleston’s Fire Station. Steel: It’s absolutely everywhere. Gunpowder: super mutants carry it, other than that is to find it (it’s not as preeclampsia as steel, but it’s all over). 
---
There’s no level requirement to take it 
---
If this is the cave with all the mirleuks...bait the mirleuk queen to chase u.. Run up where the wendigo is.. And activate him... U will die... But it doesnt matter.. So will the wendigo.. Sneak back in and collect the loot..
---
Assasins armor. 
---
Putting aside the issue of workshops, it's seeking out someone who is minding his or her own business and attacking them, and continuing to when they make it clear that they have no interest in PvP.
---
It's especially griefing if you're some tank build who can one shot kill a lvl 80  mirelurk queen and your prey is some player who is 20 levels below you who is currently crafting and not even set up for combat. 
---
Unless they have specifically done something to intentionally anger you, you're just a stupid coward for attacking a player in instances like that. 
---
You realize not everyone can hear right? Maybe they want to use text instead of VOIP because of hearing problems.
---
Get the perk that lets you search containers for ammo. 
---
The area around it? 
---
What about that one guy that constantly hits you waiting for you to fight back and the other guy who randomly and constantly attack’s your base.
---
I don't think they're talking about it on a technical level.  I think they're talking about it on its merits as a game - ie. it's ability to enable fun through play.
---
Always has been enjoyable. 
---
If you didn't think it was at the beginning, then stay away. 
---
There’s not much out there really, you can just run away from anything you see. The factory itself is either guarded by super mutants or dogs/wolves I think. It’s not the hardest place to capture 
---
Not everyone can hear either. I guess if they are deaf they are just screwed?
---
Going melee is a good way to build up your ammo stores at low level.
---
I think I may try it. 
---
Best melee weapon? 
---
Yea dude, if that's what you want, you will definitely have fun with it. I played since the beta and took my time with it and still have lots to explore. I just got a bit sick of the bugs so I'm taking a break. I was getting disconnected from the server a lot, pretty much whenever something interesting happened, so that killed it for me.   
---
I do believe that this game is only going to get better, so have fun out there!
---
Oh I have no issue with you taking a workshop because you want the workshop. I guess I'm referring to players who see a taken workshop, kill the owner, then run off with no intention of using the workshop. 
---
How were you able to post a image to this sub??
---
At level 12 you should still be in the forrest I would say
---
The mire as well. Each zone should have it's own major city/town with unique nuked enemies. 
---
I'd love a sort of shack/tree house city on a massive scale, in the mire. 
---
Level up more. It's a marathon not a sprint. 
---
i had it but i just had to exit the game and join back
---
That's a good idea. Though I'd like the regular death bag to be a color when I get close to it so I can find the darn thing.
---
If you want a piece of prototype x01 paint you have to craft a new one. When you craft a new piece it has prototype paint on it.
---
That sucks thanks bro
---
I once saw a giant bloody bone two-handed melee weapon at a vendor but the server crashed before I got it.

---
This would be a great addition. As it is now, I just have my camp on a spawn point for wild animals. Every time I travel back to my camp there's a fresh batch of something to kill and eat. I get radstags, squirrels, rabbits, chickens, beavers and frogs. Occasionally fireflies which are useless.
---
Good to have friends on the same server.
---
what ammo do u need? i can give u some for free and then sell u some others
---
Seeing low level players is just going to be really scarce moving forward. There isn’t really anything compelling about the game right now that promotes growth of the player base. That on top of the horribly bad publicity this game gets on what feels like a weekly basis is the problem. 
---
Why would I disconnect? I want to kill people as much as they want to opt into PVP. More caps for me. It is on them to call it quits. Seeking revenge opts into PVP. Taking a workshop is opting into PVP. Why are people so surprised when someone answers their call? 
---
Post apocalyptic America is not going to be all sunshine and rainbows.
---
But that’s not the case with the OP who just doesn’t want to listen to “fatties eating Cheetos”.
---
I stumbled upon a camp with a couple of players there last night.  They beckoned me over and gave me carrot soup.  I thanked them for their hospitality by crafting a couple witch outfits for them on the spot, which the girl in the Ritual Outfit seemed to really enjoy.
---
50 cal
---
Theres 3 theme parks and I think one should be boosted to white springs level of mobs. Has anyone nuked them? I think the waterpark would be best..m might try it tonight
---
You.... Still don't get why a good game is. Do you? 
---
The workshops are designed specifically for PvP interaction. That is literally what they were designed for. They are the pvp aspect of the game, it is why slap damage isn't a thing in workshops and if you are a level 12 and choose to take a workshop and show up and try to defend it from a level 100+ that is your own stupidity. 
---
One, you shouldn't be trying to take workshops at such a low level, and two after level 50 any levels above that are pointless, you are as strong as you can possibly get at level 50, so being level 250 has no advantage over a level 50. They actually have a disadvantage as they will lose 250 caps for each time they are killed, while the level 50 will only lose 50 caps.
---
scope is mandatory in this game for various reasons..
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
beg to differ, based on my experience.
---
Previous iterations of FO taught me to heard junk and weapons, adn I haven't broken that habit yet, so I'm always overencumbered.
---
My characters limit is 200.
---
Using the stated formula, I should get 1700 total, 
---
(carry weight 200 + 1500) = 1700.
---
My stash 796; as soon as my character hits 701, movement drops to an unacceptably slow crawl.  796+701=1497.
---
  I can temporarily regain normal movemnet by consuming a Radstag steak, but AP  disappears much faster than normal until I drop the weight back to 700 or less, then I can move as usual.
---
Or maybe they just said that so they don't have to go out and be like "yeah I'm hard of hearing". You do realize some people are sensitive to that type of thing and don't want to broadcast it and be mocked or anything for it. Right?
---
Event hoping 
---
Why did you engage them without putting you flux in your stash first?
---
Is this near berkely springs?
---
Not for a while, but I couldn't get into it.  To me it looked and sounded like Elder Scrolls but really didn't feel like it. 
---
I did it’s due to moving the controls before you character has fully rendered in it confused the game. Or when you spam the pip-not button. 
---

But even though its not in the pip boy, if I re applied it after the patch it is working? Just not as well and after patch 7 will be fixed?

there's a mirelurk queen in there? i only saw kings

I used land mines. And mostly stayed away from players to let things respawn. 
---
I’m a big fan of Party Boy/Girl on Melee because it makes booze give a nice boost to Strength especially if you use whiskey. It is a bit of an investment as it’s a 2/3 perk but you might consider it as an alternative to Lone Wanderer, especially with the booze-based content coming out later this month. 
---
Haha yup 
---
What do you propose that wouldn’t detract from the experience of those farming in that area, just curious.
---
.50 cal for dmg
---
Gatling for ammo control 
---
Auto grenade launcher for crowd control. 
---
Minigun is ok but it doesn’t do enough for me. 
---
&gt; Avoid doing any quests that reward you with unique gear until you're level 50 so they are leveled up. If you complete the quest at low level the gear will be low level.
---
Honestly, a lot of the unique items aren't worth waiting until levels 45-50 to pick up, since they're usually easily replaced by random-drop 1\* legendaries. All Rise might be worth waiting for since you're probably going to be in the upper 30s to mid 40s by the time you reach Watoga if you're following the main quest in order, but it's really not worth waiting around for a max-level Somerset Special (Armor Penetrating .44 pistol) or Black Diamond (+1 Str Ski Sword) when it would take 20-40 levels of grinding to get there.
---
Bulk doesn't weigh less, unless you are counting the 2 plastic needed to bulk, at which point you could just have the resources unbulked and have less plastic.
---
No it’s mainly by Middle Mountain Cabins, Big Fred’s BBQ Shack, and National Isolated Radio. I live in the middle of all of that. I’m in the half way mark from Silo Alpha and Emmett Mountain Disposal Site. 
---
When I was low level (10 or so) I tagged along with a high level friend while he did thus quest - in the process I learned the layout of the cave, which is invaluable. It allowed me to beat the quest as a level 15 playing solo.
---
Sneak through as much of the cave as possible. If you can get past half or more of the mirelurks without getting caught, you’re smooth sailing. Once you do get caught [Danger] - just take off running towards the end of the cave (where the quest marker/Wendigo are at).
---
In that final chamber there is a waterfall where the Wendigo hangs out. On the other side of it (from where you enter the room) is a small shortcut cave that takes you back to the beginning of the cave in typical Bethesda fashion. Hit that cave and enter sneak mode... the Wendigo will not pursue you down that cave beyond visibility of the waterfall.
---
Once you’re back in the cave, walk the rest of the way and wipe out the low level enemies between you and the drop-down point (drops into the room with the dead Army man and his holotape) - there are a few mole rats and such that shouldn’t be a problem. After the shortcut cave is clear, return to the Wendigo room and start sneak attacking it. Anytime it finds you or tries to attack, recede into that tunnel knowing it won’t follow you. 
---
I'm a PC player so area mic is what I use. A lot of folks don't use mics. Personal thing but it makes it harder.
---
Yeah, I experience the same on new characters, but the game gives you all the tools you need to deal with them. Unless they have some sort of damage over time effect, just crouch down and fast travel away. They cannot see you on the map if you are crouched. Then go and use the ignore feature. Now you can safely run around Appalachia with no risk of them following you. They would have to randomly stumble upon you to continue punching your butt.
---
You may actually be right on that, but I'm pretty sure it still wasn't used until F4 and they may be trying to shoehorn it in as a long term phrase being used.  
---
Ahhh gotcha 
---
Make it so it literally isn't the only place in the game worth farming?
---
The place spawns tens of legendary enemies that makes it the perfect place for people to grind for their stupid two shot explosive guns.
---
No other place in the game does that reliably. Whitespring isn't an INTENDED high level farm zone. It's just one because bethesda didn't think about their spawning rules and enemy placement.
---
Spend your hard earned trash.  Break down all the weapons (ALL OF THEM), use the parts to make more of the more advanced types you have and break those down too.  You'll free up a few hundred really fast.  Then bulk and sell all that broken glass and cork.
---
Tilted Towers 
---
I think waiting for daisycutter, and all rise are definitely worth it.
---
I’d love to see a robot PA set that has robot part for armour and weapons. Ripping off the sentrybot gun and mounting it on your arm would be dank. Or robobrain treads or whatnot of the likes. It fits with the lore. As people in Appalachia were destroying bots left and right. 
---
Ah, bummer. Now that you mentioned it I do remember hearing that you can only tame random event spawns. Haven't dabbled with taming myself so I'm a bit out of the loop.
---
Don’t tread on me !
---
Make your own!

Any tinker's bench makes ammo from 10mm to plasma cells to missles and mini nukes. For most ballistic ammo you'll need gunpowder, steel and lead. Gunpowder can be found on super mutants but you can make your own at a chemistry bench from acid and cloth which you can make from detergent and money. Lead can be found in pencils, paint, toys and free weights. It might be a bit of a jaunt at level 10 but there's a mini gym at the Charleston Fire Department  full of free weights that scrap down to a bunch of lead. And of course there's steel which is literally everywhere.
---
If shotguns are more your thing, you'll need plastic. Guess what? Pens and cigarette packs are your new friends.
---
Later on you can get perks like Ammosmith and Super Duper that will maximize your ammo crafting skills, so that's something to look forward to.
---
But you say you need ammo on the run? Know thine enemy my friend. Muties carry 5mm for their miniguns and 5.56, .308 and fusion cells for their rifles. Scorched carry .45, 10 mm and shotgun shells. Mole Miners are also a fan of shotguns and rifles.
---
One more piece of advice: Pick a melee weapon that works for you as a backup -- they never run out of ammo. Sure some of those folks look pretty scary but never underestimate the value of a trusty sledgehammer by your side.
---
Really? Because all the friends I've made in this game are in my region, basically. I have one British friend and that's only because I manually added him. Everyone I've met in game is Midwest/Southern east coast like me. Oh, I met some Puerto Ricans once.
---
They’re also really picky about their group, they don’t typically let outsiders in and only let people born within their ranks become knights and paladins. Keep in mind it was Father Elijah who led them when they lost that war.
---
The trick with scorchbeasts is getting those cancer bats to land.  When they're on the ground, they're not too bad.  When they're in the air they've got a sonic screech that also kind of blinds you to exactly where they are and can also "cropdust" this radioactive shit down that will eat through armor like candy.  And they've usually got ground support via a crew of scorched who will also be attacking you.
---
Best bet for low levels is to run, though the beasts will aggro after you for a while.   If you're up for the battle, clear the Scorched from the ground, lure the scorchedbeast into a fairly open clearing, and then focus fire on the wings.  if you cripple a wing, that sucker *has* to land and that's when they are most vulnerable.
---
This is normal and a completely different limit. There is a hard limit of 1500 over your carry. Meaning, once you get to 1500 over, you aren't able to pick up anything else. Period. There are other soft levels lower that have side effects. The one you point out triggers at some multiple of  your carry weight. Once you pass it, you can only walk, as you noted. Just like once you go over your carry, you can no longer sprint or fast travel.
---
I have bought them from Harpers Ferry. 
---
Haha all the more reason to go through with this! We could have a big civil war between the new gov’t and the people who don’t want one.
---
Bloodied 50
---
He is just left of the wendigo... I remember i didnt have far to run
---
I do the same except I only build garbage like bone chimes and dozens of Vault posters because I'm kind of an asshole.
---
aah, i diped out the second i got the loot. absolutely hate that cave
---
I want to make nuka cola purely so I can make more nuka grenades. 
---
Leave the government stuff to the robots they are nailed the DMV quest spot on.
---
me too. I wish this was an easier thing to do, honestly.
---
But can he buy a trenchcoat to wear in the atomic shop?
---
At lower levels I mostly used my camp as mobile stash and repair. Also, when things got rough, a place I could toss out a few MG Turrets to help kill things.
---
I wouldn't worry about a more permanent place until you get closer to 50 or higher.
---
Even just wearing the frame helps early on if you can find the Fusion Cores for it.  60 DR before 15 is difficult and nearly everthing early game deals physical damage(which makes me question why you can only craft leather right out the vault and not the more physically resistant wood armor).
---
I could 1 shot the lvl 68 bloated ghouls at WS with a single headshot at around 30 with my shotgun. A scorchbeast showed up at WS while I was farming there at that level and I barely killed it with the help of the sentry bots and assaultrons from the WS. 
---
The scorch beasts are easily the hardest mob in the game for their level.
---
It seems to happen most now when you try to open your Pip Boy as soon as you load into the game, but the game isn't fully loaded.  You are basically "Stuck" in the pip boy without the pip boy being opened.  You can't leave it, and you cannot do anything but open map and fast travel.  Even after fast traveling you are stuck.
---
You'll want to avoid it by just not opening pip boy at all when you first load into the game.
---
Seemed to happen before if you moved around too much before the game actually finished loading, but after the last patch for me at least, moving along didn't cause it.  Only opening the pip boy did.
---
Thanks for the info. I will make sure to go down guns blazing thinking of these tips the first time we completely overjudge our abilities while we get our asses handed to us ;)
---
Eh? Man I am British and have met people from my home town on FO76
---
Honestly I did just to have a base camp for free fast travel. I put mine right beside the overseers camp pretty much so that I had quick access to stash box and a lot of the benches needed for crafting. (To fast travel straight to the overseers camp costs caps) so if u put one right close then it's free travel to it.
---
sending a level 10 to super mutants, cruel!  craft it! gunpowder = cloth + acid
---
I am like you, a returnee after trying it the first week.. I am usually seeing a nice mix of low and high levels on the PS4 also.
---
For a lore reason I have this: through holotapes and clear visual evidence we know that the whitesprings security bots killed or made people leave after their time of staying as patrons. Why are the vault dwellers (us) aloowed to love on the golf course or most of the grounds when the previous people were killed if not more for the same action. 
---
The bots should come around and warn you to leave after time X and enforce that time. 
---
Granted most of us can outlast the bots and the respawns, but it’s an idea. 
---
I am a level 16 and I did build a campy early.  IT is very basic....small one room cabin with a bed and a lamp....and a large deck that has one of each work station on it...and a few turrets for protection.  
---
That said, you could easily get by just using the overeseers camp outside of flatwoods for a while, that is what I did until I put up camp.  
---
Grahm is one of my favorite parts of the game, I get so excited when I see him and his moomoo 
---
I hear u.. Me too... Ran as fast as possible... As a solo player i have to put enemies against each other... The first time i killed a scorch beast i baited him into whitespring for back up... It was awesome!!!!!
---
More like people wasted $60 on what is pretty much the E.T video game of our generation and their ego won't let them stop defending it no matter how bored they are. 
---
Where do I get the BOS armor?
---
Griefing means to cause other players grief.  If you are taking owned workshops (which is a pretty no gain behavior, unless they are locking their extractors and even then junk is generally worthless), there's really no gain except to hassle the person you are taking it from, unless of course they didn't build anything.  
---
I mean, there's really little to no gains from pvp in this, if you are doing it it's because it gives you a thrill, and most people don't want to be bothered with PVP, so it's almost guaranteed to be griefing.
---
My first take was at level 10. Usually guarded by Super Mutants (make sure you have the fire tower and family cabin nearby on your map to respawn to)... I died a few times, but ultimately wiped them out.
---
At low levels your “defense event” is usually either wolves or Liberators (mk0/mk1). Easy peasy.
---
There’s really nothing in the area that you can’t run away from pretty easily. Just don’t wander to near any fissure sites and attract things that you can’t handle. 
---
i hope more than anything this can be so. it hurts so badly that lights are so expensive budget wise because I have a hard time in low light situations so not just for decorations I want task lighting ... 
---
but also I won't even use defenses in my camp just for building and decor and yet it never is enough :(   *this* is my end game and it's very limited  :/
---
not just a bigger budget but fixing all the quirky bugs like doors not fitting and the foundation pieces on laminate having a tiny crack of not fitting together when placed sometimes. and items slapped down floating or not placing ...all the bugs  but I'd be so happy if budget increased. I want to build so big :(
---
Maybe there is a limit on automatic weapons? Seems busted if it proc’d at an alarming rate. 
---
yea the game is kinda hard for soloplayers (if you dont abuse melee and dont have good legendairy gear)
---
A claw or spike mod would be awesome 
---
They're pretty unimpressive unless you can find a decent legendary one.
---
Never checked to see what the damage is with my furious buzz blade is but that one absolutely rips through scorchbeasts. My bloodied buzz blade does 150ish at low health, but I'm not really optimized for maximum damage so I could push it a lot higher.
---
If you log off your camp will log off with you. 
---
"is the game worth it/I played beta once and never again, what's changed" needs its own subreddit at this point.
---
Too early... But when u do look for a tent plan.. Its easier..
---
On a side note might be down for a player government for my low level alt character. Essentially the game mechanics would force high level players within the government to periodically give my little guy caps...because he obviously needs them more.
---
If he didn't put a lock on that generator then they are free game in my opinion.
---
I leave all my resource extractors unlocked so people can take what they want, that player may think the same.
---
You mean the 50 cal machine gun? Or a hunting rifle with a 50 cal receiver? 
---
I use semi auto rifles. Like I said, I used rank 3 before so I have a good idea on how often it should activate. 
---
Tbh I made a 1 foundation and four walls when I had the resources for it. But it makes you build or at least understand the building in a quest. 
---
Whatever does the most damage. Also, pick up and scrap every weapon you find to learn those mods.
---
You are so full of shit it hurts to read it.  
---
You did not gain 300lbs of scrap from three kills.  There's almost no gain to be made stealing from other players.  Even if they are overloaded with scrap, most people take 3 screws and leave.  Workshops are even less of a thing since any sane person will build a workbench and stash and stash their gear within second of arriving.
---
I was farming the Golf Clubhouse last night on my mid-40s character. 
---
Clear --&gt; swap servers --&gt;Repeat
---
Not sure how many clears I made, quite a few, and then it happened.... I joined a server and the Club House was fully populated with level 8 and 9 Ghouls.   Must have been deserted and been triggered by a low level player who never went in.
---
Why is this important?  **BECAUSE those level 8 and 9 Ghouls were about 75% Golfer Ghouls!**  I finally finished that stupid kill 10 Golfers after clearing White Springs many dozens of times.
---
My take away from this is if you want to get that quest done, Clear the Club House with a friend, swap to a newbie character and Fast Travel to your friend to initiate a low level spawn.  Then head back to your main and go get some Golfers.
---
Fantastic ideas!  I hope Bethesda sees this!
---
For some reason tamed deathclaws (and a few other creatures) are very anti-electricity and have been terrorizing a few C.A.M.P.s until generators are stored. In all seriousness though, this issue is currently being looked into and we'll follow up as soon as we have any updates. 
---
Thanks for sharing and I hope Buffy Crazyclaws is doing well otherwise!
---
Santa's gone :(
---
Or the wealthy horde all the caps and good items and the poor would revolt against them.
---
Yeah, I'd agree with this.  Early on, your CAMP is more useful as a portable stash and repair station.  You might build it upon a single foundation and load the various workbenches on it, then store it as a blueprint for easy retrieval.
---
Yes, stash boxes aren't uncommon, but not every vendor has a stash box.
---
By the time you are Lv. 50 and have explored the world, you can start thinking about your "forever home" and probably have a few spaces in mind.
---
And you’re absolutely right about 4 being the first time it was used. But, retconning isn’t exactly new. We have the cryolator, even though it was the pet experiment of the overseer of 111. 
---
Increase the add spawn by 4x
---
The entire game as it is, is a face roll at lvl 50+
---
I want hard PvE.
---
I decided instead of dumping stuff outside of Vault 76 or into the trash cans inside/outside of Vendors, I would directly take stuff to low levels. 
---
They all run or get creeped out. I would fast travel to them, walk near them and drop ammo, aid and weapons and basically stuff I didn’t need or want. 
---
They all run away for the most part. 
---
So I’m back to dumping stuff outside vault 76 and nearby locations. And if a low level wants to trade, I price everything the request at a single cap. 
---

---
Shotgun and whatever is in the revelover 
---
Followup testing due to other possible ways around this that people have brought up in the comments. Note that these are all tested to see if they get around SLAP DAMAGE. IE, damage when you are NOT in PvP with someone through some form or another.
---
Test target is a level 21 character with zero combat perks, level 20 combat armor with about 130DR/70ER, zero RR, a few mutations including Electrically Charged. I used two different attacker characters for tests (bloodied HW/explosives for some weapons, bloodied stealth/vats sniper for others)
---
Mininukes don't make a difference. A bloodied mininuke doing 1800 damage (I wasn't going to waste a bobblehead pushing it over 2k) VATS targetted did 5 damage.
---
Exploding cars don't make a difference. At all. They do zero direct damage. They do do their normal radiation damage if you stay near them, but it's very minor.
---
Radium Rifles are capped at 5 damage for the direct damage, and &lt;1 radiation damage. I don't have a Gamma gun on hand to test with, I'd assume it's the same, but if there's interest in verification I'll scrounge one up. The radium rifle test was enough to satisfy me for that type of weapon. Note that I followed up with a retaliation and then a second shot, and was now doing the expected 15 radiation damage a hit.
---
Electrically charged mutation did NOT initiate PVP. I couldn't tell if it  even did retaliatory damage at all. Attacker was naked, using a Bowie knife and triggered the mutation several times, and I never saw a HP drop on the attacker. I do have the Healing Factor mutation, but I was in Caution/Danger, I should not have been self-healing from it. 
---
Anything else people would like to see tested? I just realized I do have at least one explosive gun in storage, a blackpowder rifle. I'll dig that out.
---
Is it actually prompting you to return to him?
---
If you're talking bout the golf club...I have one I'll sell
---
Raiders will be raiders
---
The screams...hahaha 
---
Stability has increased significantly, lag and other issues seem to be much less frequent.  I picked the game up at launch but saw enough issues to stay away until recently, so I can't compare it, but i Can say I have really enjoyed it since hopping in two weeks ago.
---
They are not remotely the "PVP aspect" of the game.  The odds of you finding people at a scrapyard are so minimal, they are designed for you to come in, set up some extractors and whatever you need to use right now and bail.  Most people don't lock shit making them public facilities.
---
I keep seeing people complaining about PVP problems and I wonder if we are playing the same game.  I've been killed just a few times in my entire play time.
---
Man, you know you can get atom points in game right?
---
I thought it was a .50 cal marksman rifle
---
Yea this is definitely incorrect.
---
I’d record a few minutes of it at rank 1 and with rank 3 and send it to BGS 
---
So what happens if the person who occupied the industrial place logs back on, will they get moved to another server?
---
Nice.  FYI you can lock the doors on porta pottys. 
---
Don't take the ammo Depot. You will be swamped during workshop defense quests.
---
Connsider moving far south to the ash heap. There is a quest you can do for level 25 power armor which quadruples the yield from ore veins. Near the quest is Hornwright site 3. They have a small patch of lead ore and tons of steel ore. All you need then is acid to smelt. 
---
Far north is a workshop for acid. It's in the toxic valley. Hemlock holes is the name. Fairly low level, so the defense quests are doable. Just be warned workshops are PVP zones, so don't complain about being griefed on Reddit when someone attacks you. Take what you can get and try again later.
---
Yes they are, bethesda has said numerous times that the workshops are designed to be the main pvp part of the game. That is why they are there. They are like the contested areas in WoW, they have better loot, but they also carry the risk of pvp encounters.
---
I mean, veggie starch. Doesn't Class Freak counteract this debuff anyways?
---
Weird. I almost don't want to believe you, but you're Brotherhood, so I should have no reason to doubt!
---
I’ve found a 60 day old post in reddit of someone with the same issue. They unequipped the card, logged out, and logged back in. Trying that now.
---
Maaaan I want that radium rifle. 
---
SOOOO many things I would fix with the CAMPs 💯 I've really been losing interest in this game recently. A big part of it is honestly their lack of care for what the players want
---
Scorchbeasts are very durable boss-type opponents, as implied by their massive size. Other than their screech attack volleys they don't deal a whole lot of damage while in the air, but they can eat up hundreds of rounds of ammo at lower levels.
---
Getting them to land means you can whack them with melee weapons, but they can't be staggered by power attacks the way smaller creatures can (other ways of causing a stagger effect, like Tank Killer or One Gun Army, will still work) and they have melee attacks of their own with fairly long reach.
---
Although there are some differences, the overall experience of fighting Scorchbeasts is not unlike fighting dragons in Skyrim, except that you can't learn Dragonrend in 76.
---
I had to do that with starched genes. Lost many a mutation. 
---
So you mean like [r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz)
---
Everyone does. What do think I could sell it for so many people asked 
---
So I said “I don’t like apples, for these reasons, but I eat oranges”. And you said “fruit is mandatory”. 
---
I’m not sure what you were really trying to say. Did you not understand what I was saying?
---
My friend, this is why snipers exist.  You don't always want the enemy to know who is 'taking care of them'.  While I'm all in favor of justice being an axe to the face, sometimes a bullet from the next zone over is a more...expedient solution.
---
Plus, you can easily log out when everything eventually goes to hell ;-)
---
When I hit a mob, their health goes down, first to a grey bar, and then away completely, what exactly is that indicating?  Is it how much damage I did in that attack? Is it the damage I did in the last “pull of trigger” since it seems to stay longer for automatics. 
---
Does anyone else’s damage show in there? If they hit at the same time as me? 
---
Griefing is doing something for the sole purpose of causing the other person grief. 
---
I'll PvP with anyone, regardless of level. I'll hit someone and wait. If they hit back, they're fair game. 
---
Workshops are designed for PvP, even if I don't want that workshop, I'll take it from you and sit around waiting for someone to try and claim it.
---
Tangentially, I find it odd that people say the purpose of workshops is PvP. Yes, PvP is an element, as it can happen. But workshops have a lot of other things associated with it that attract people who aren't interested in PvP. So to say people who have no interest in PvP shouldn't take workshops seems off. I'd rather take the workshop, and if someone wants to contest it, I'm happy to hand it over.
---
On the other hand, I think the Hunter/Hunted station is solely for PvP. And I wonder why all of these people who love PvP so much don't seem to participate in that very often. It seems to be the perfect venue with other people who want TO PvP.
---
I get that what classifies a game as good is subjective, and it's entirely down to (guess what) opinions for each person playing it. Your determination to make your view of what makes a game good the general consensus just clues me in that you don't understand the difference between opinion and fact.
---
For the record, I'm not even saying RDR2 is worse or overrated, my only opinion on it is that I was severely unimpressed by how they handled GTAV after saying they'd make single-player DLC, and having never played the first I've not got much motivation to play the second.
---
Finally! A Police department is exactly what the game needs from its players, IMO, as long as you guys don't devolve into The Mob, lol. Stay good, PoPo--stay good.
---
Imma friend you guys on PS4 when I get home. Do you guys plan to keep playing long-term? (I've been waiting for the Adventure servers to dive in...)
---
Wanna add?
---
I do love my 3* instigating rapid gausse and chameleon armor from a hilltop fired using ADS well out of VATS range....
---
Sounds like you have a bad computer cuz that doesn't happen to me at all
---
Totally like that
---
Happy too but I'll be on Sat all day long
---
I got tons in Watoga. From the vendor bot at the station and off of the legendary bots. 
---
No, they fucking well aren't.  Bethesda's intent is irrelevant, there's no benefit, need, or honestly even way to use workshops as a PVP mechanic.  It just doesn't work, no one sits around in a workshop waiting to be challenged, the odds of you and someone being in one at the same time are so close to zero that even if you are trying you are straight up going to fail.  
---
No one cares what Bethesda WANTS them to be, they aren't a PVP mechanic because functionally that aspect of it does not work.
---
Surprise, there are people who wear power armor, use weight reduction perks, and don't stash their stuff immediately. Scrap is not worthless. I bulked all the stuff I got and made about 2800 caps selling it to vendors over two days.
---
Maybe I just need to keep hopping. Thank u
---
Nope that's kinda how it goes
---
A lot of nerfs, increased stash space to 800, server stability, and temp bans. 
---
I have a ultra light robot plan can’t remember what part it is I also have a shadowed robot plan
---
What would you want for them. 
---
It works great on my PC.
---
Yeah it is, it's fun to take a break from the regular grind, find a cool spot to setup camp either temporary or permanently .. you want to build a sleeping bag asap as it will save you wasting Stimpaks and heal your health.
---
Try an SSD and a graphics card upg?
---
What are you looking at? He posted a link to an outside image host.
---
Yes it is.
---
Had 2 level 1's on the server I played on last night.
---
Link.
---
It is Imgur.
---
Wow... Reminds me of the Nuka World maze in FO4
---
Events are fine. In a high traffic server there can be between 6-8 events going. If anything it needs a notification system when a player enters the area. 
---
I have the ability to craft a Mr Handy blade, not sure how rare that is. 
---
OMG, another old soul. Ultima Online was great. Now there was a game with real death consequences!
---
i think i got one there but didnt have ammo for it so i scrapped it. didnt realize it was rare
---
We don't need a bow animation I think the bow would be enough lol
---
You can make them on a chemistry bench with a blood pack made from ticks blood and antiseptic. And then something else I can't remember to make the stimpak. But I don't know if you need to find a plan or recipe for it. Then you can dilute them.
---
Also, if you do events, you get stimpaks.
---
And as someone else said, you can make healing salve. And purified water brings up HP. And if you get your hands on any nuka cola products, those work as well.
---
Lol, that's hilarious, because I can sell bulk to 7 different vendors every day and still have a shitload left to sell.  It's worthless because if you play the game, there's a completely endless supply of it that's impossible to deal with.
---
I mean, you'd have to not play the game and sit in one location waiting for people to kill to be able to significantly benefit from banditry in this game.
---
I always thought of it as potential damage.  Kind of like a stimpacks is potential health.  Bleed damage is a big part of some weapons, and can last for around 3 or 5 seconds after a hit.  But if you hit them during that time the bleed damage is interrupted and resets.  Kind of like when your healing with a stimpack and die even if you had some healing left to do.
---
i can give u like 300 .44 flr the revolver for 100 caps. 
---
When fighting the queen, does it look to everyone that she has agro on them? Does she target agro on who is doing the most damage?  
---
Does the loot showing up have any connection to how much damage you did, or when in the fight you did the damage, I feel like when I do a bunch of damage, or get that last hit in, I get the loot immediately, but if I am a more supportive role, fighting the adds at the end instead of the queen I get nothing or it takes a very long time.  
---
I don't think you are playing wrong, you seem to have just scaled up beyond the individual stash limits.  I am still just using one character in the hopes the stash grows with future updates.  
---
Just take laps around and enter the buildings from time to time. 
---
Will do. 
---
A less viable though more convenient option is to get an armor set that reductions the weight of your inventory along with weight reduction perks 
---
Heavy Weapons players are steel junkies with the needle still sticking out of their arms, guys- sell that stuff on the trade subs for good caps. I've never had an ad for 500+ go more than a few minutes before it found a buyer.
---
Platform? 
---
No, this is the system players have invented in the absence of a purpose built system within the game.  
---
Also remember that if you hit max caps, you can use NukaColas instead.
---
You on PC? Sold an Assassins Ultracite laser pistol earlier today..
---
What platform are you on?
---
Like 100caps a plans I’ll be on in a half hour my psn is the same as my username
---
You have not started the Rose / Top of the world or Hornwright missions yet? What level are you? and I'm curios as to your in game playing style
---
Ps4
---
Hey have you tried the train car west of watoga?    
---
I found all my BoS stuff there.
---
Gold
---
I actually got a blunderbuss pretty early on, dumped it assuming it was common and have never seen one since, or ever fired one
---
So am I supposed to wait until the damage completely registers? 
---
So...?
---
To your point about Morgantown, that is slightly unfounded as it is in the forest and has a spawn level limit of 15 I believe. That area has also always been a little harder than the rest of the forest due to being kind of a gateway to the toxic valley. I first went there under level 10 but was over my head and struggled but I got through it, and I expect others will too. I think my first death in game was after being surrounded by the ghouls around VTU. But the rest of your points stand.
---
To restate your point: I've been thinking a lot about this as it's one of the reasons I hate Harper's Ferry. I've yet to explore the town fully because everything respawns every 5 minutes due to someone fast traveling in. Being surrounded by lvl 68 super mutants or feral ghouls in an instant sucks no matter what level you are. The same thing was common at the penitentiary when everyone was trying to farm the handmade rifle plans. There needs to be a cooldown on respawns in an area. Honestly 15-30 min would be appropriate. That should be enough time to kill everything and search every nook and cranny. However, if everyone has left the area, next person in can trigger a respawn without cooldown. 
---
Back when I was doing Rose's quest, I went to Sunnytop and didn't realize there was a level 17 sneaking through the place because he didn't show on the map. He had cleared it out and I triggered everything to respawn, including a 3-star legendary super mutant right in front of him. He went tearing out of there while I drew their fire. He never came back and it's obvious he didn't finish looting the place as the power armor and recipes were untouched. I felt bad for him. This shouldn't happen.
---
The exception to this? If an enemy is an essential part of a quest. That's the ONLY reason things should respawn. So, the wendigo in the cave should be the ONLY thing that respawns if someone joins me in the cave. Otherwise, you end up with the issue everyone had right after the release with Evan.
---
There has been many times where I would have liked to help or have help with a quest, but instead of joining someone at a location when I see them on the map, I stay away because I don't want to cause the area to respawn.
---
Ok. That's awesome. My psn is carcass_stew. I'm not sure when I can be on though
---
Will try to be on

xbox

I knew someone I worked with many years ago that would play WoW for the sole purpose of harassing someone so much they logged out. That was all he did. He did not RAID. He didn't care much for quests. He hid himself in areas where players were half his level. He would stalk them and kill them over and over and over until they logged out. He told me the joy he often got out of doing it was out of this world. He said the rush was addictive. How his prey would struggle. How they would beg to be left alone. How he would ignore their pleas and tell them that this is PVP server so he was within his right to do whatever he wanted to them. He lived for the hunt and the grief he could cause to another person. He would hope they cried, begged, pleaded, etc. That, is griefing.
---
In “heart of the swamp” does the hearts damage meter go down and then refill 1/3-1/2 of the damage done every time for everyone, or just me? 
---
I have 2 characters. Ones level 131 the others 51 and the 3rd is 11
---
You can fast travel to the workshop when someone contests it. You get a notification and a few minutes to get there. So not sure why you think they would have to sit there and wait for someone to attack it. 
---
You claim it and then go about and do your things and then if someone attacks it you can show up and defend it, or you lose it.
---
That is how it is designed, don't like it then don't claim workshops.
---
Ok just send me a message on psn when you get on don’t rush they aren’t going anywhere 
---
Why i use a level 1 level 3 and level 5 versions of the same cards all the time on the same char.
---
Thank u. Will send invite from phone now
---
Same here.
---
Why??
---
You know,  I do have a "business" that can help you out with that if you're on ps4...
---
I wonder if someone was holding onto them for the Legendary Vendor?  I personally have started stocking up on low weight Legendary weapons so I can take them all to the vendor when he's live and turn a bunch in at once.
---
You know what emote is sorely needed? The ability to sit on a bench and slowly unzip my Vault Tec Mechanic Jumpsuit, so I can ask players walking by me, "Yaranaika?"
---
That’s really interesting lol. Honestly, it’s been fun dealing with it, but fix please! Really enjoying the game, edited post with happy deathclaw photo!
---
I'm assuming you can put a long recon scope on that?  Makes it easy to keep track of where those pesky little ones run off to.  Just make sure to mark 'em all before you fire!
---
Im referring more to Perks u get in the packs and then never use. 
---
If you've got the crippling pistol perk, I found that an explosive pistol works great to cripple your foes.
---
But your'e right it's extremely underpowered in terms of damage output. It is however extremely mobile and can be fun to use.
---
I run a support build with a pistol. I recently started sharing the mysterious stranger card in groups where people use vats a lot. It's just fun to watch him proc with enemies decending on him for the 8 seconds he lasts
---
i really did wait a long time to see if anyone was going to come back for them!  
---
New update 1.10 = 50gb.
---
Why?? 
---
I thought Marine Assault was like a heavy version, or am I wrong? But I don’t know, don’t own an assault piece.
---
“Suppressors” is supposed to lower damage of the target 20% for 2 seconds, is that useful at all???   2 seconds, that’s not even how long it takes a supermutant to hit back, so I can’t imagine he’s actually doing less  damage, and 20% is that noticeable at all? I just can’t tell. 
---
There is also a suppressors perk, does it stack? 40% for 4 seconds? 
---
Why not have both options?
---
Pretty sure I made it clear that it might be a coincidence, but sure.
---
Would be nice if you could hook up a speaker to the terminal and have it play the holotape through the speaker for other people to hear when you load it in.
---
Why I have to download 50gb for update 1.10??
---
I just want to play and don't want to wait for 20+ hours... 
---
Scrap hunting rifles to learn the .50 cal receiver mod. 
---
some of the negative comments are/were pretty legit as early on it was laagy crashy and had a ton of weird wtf moments but as time went on they fixed a good number of those and still are fixing it - then came the wave of fake stories about bans (not all of them but many of the more news worthy ones) that youtubers repeated over and over till people not playing the game believed - then the stories of it going free to play or the "p2w"both of which was discovered to be made up stories for views - at same time some people did get banned by accident and some weird things did happen
---
 But long story short love the game or hate it for your own reasons not because someone told you - I like it I still think it has a long way to go but I got what I paid for and I really don't care what others tell me of why I'm (insert random cursing rant here) and stupid cause I have my own opinion 
---
I tested it with the Blackpowder rifle. Assassins/Explosive, and to test 2 different things I also cranked my rad load up to 95% percent, pushing my pip-boy damage for the rifle to 1175. I loaded a crit, and on my VATS sniper (so 2.5X sneak attacks, 2.4x critical damage) popped a sneak (2.5x) critical (2.4x) headshot (2x). I don't know if the math is based in resultants or if each mulitplier only goes off paper-damage, I believe it was resultants in FO4, but I'll list the "should-be" damage for each.
---
Resultants:
---
1175*1.1(Assassins)=1292
---
1292*2.5(sneak)=3231
---
3231*2.6 (critical)=8401
---
8401*2 (headshot)=16802.
---
Base damage:
---
1175*1.1=1292
---
1175*2.5=2937
---
1175*2.6=3055
---
1175*2=2350
---
Sum=9640
---
So I'd either be doing 16, almost 17k, or I'd be doing a hair under 9k.
---
How much did my unwitting test subject take?
---
5.
---
The second test was to test explosive area of effect damage. Note that on this character, I do not have explosive radius(Grenadier) or explosive damage (Demolition Expert). Also, this is testing with a BPR, not an explosive shotgun or minigun or something of that nature; I don't have those to test with. Given my results, though, I don't see how those would be any different, but we all know how inconsistent this game can be; if anyone wants to loan me one for Science! I'll happily test that too.
---
The area-of-effect damage from the explosive legendary did ZERO damage to my target. I repeated several times, getting close enough to kill MYSELF with the explosion, but the target took zero damage every time. Only direct body shots did the expected 5 damage.
---
(Through a mouthful of Cheetos) Hey!
---
Damn I must've played this game a lot a lot 
---
[How Sweet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5fts7bj-so)
---
Yeah, I don't pick up anything except acid. I mine for lead and steel. Everything else is either from workshop quests or taken from people like you.
---
Banditry is how you make more than 1400 caps per day. Killing high level dudes gives you caps. It is far more profitable than being passive.
---
I have never found Robot Armor plans themselves at the vendors  (Light, Sturdy, or Heavy).  But I have seem the Robot Armor Legs/Torso/Arms plans spawn in the Armor plan locations at Camp Venture (The old BOS outpost where you return Tech Data).  Both Heavy and Sturdy versions of them.
---
I am a fan of the plasma gatling prime. But they break fast, so I have 6 of them.
---
I've played a lot of hours in this game.  People don't come back to defend workshops.  They don't care, they don't want to fight you, the scrap is just scrap.  No one does it.  It's not part of the game.  It may have been intended, it just DOES NOT HAPPEN.  I shouldn't need to explain this to anyone, we are playing the same damn game here.  
---
And it shouldn't happen.  The workshops don't provide any significant tangible benefit.  They are best as a place where you can slap some tables down and handle your inventory needs while on the road, throw up some free extractors as a public service, and then go about your business actually playing the game.  To take advantage of their supposed intended purpose, you'd need to put effort in.  No one is going to stop looting/crawling through whatever they are in the middle of because you went and touched their workbench.  Why would they?  PVP itself has little to no benefits as well.  I'll be glad when survival mode is implemented and the PVP twats toddle off to their survival servers to hang out with the rest of the PVP twats. 
---
Throw some workbenches and a place to sleep down when you need it, I would say a more established camp is nice before lvl 50, you don’t have to pour hours into making it super unique but I thought the game felt a little different in a good way when you have a home base to go back to, craft/scrap/rest/play some music for your buffs.
---
When you craft it, I believe it is under the "Sturdy Armor" menu.  As opposed to Light or Heavy Armor menus.
---
Jesus. That's way better than mine.
---
Yep. I just wanted to put the comment out there for anyone who might not realize that G2A is a marketplace. It's like buying from an auction site like ebay or a place like Craigslist or Facebook. Sometimes you get ripped off.
---
Oh, and don't worry too much about the downvotes. People are just downvoting because you said you got it from a marketplace site like G2A. Reddit can be... special about them.
---
haha... I ran into my first one when I was level 7. I was exploring portions of the map that a level 7 really shouldn't have been messing around in. I was running down this hill with Scorched firing at my ass and the damn beast attacking from above.  Came to a road and saw a cave on the other side, which I thought was perfect. The flying monstrosity wouldn't be able to get to me in there and I would be able to heal up.  Wrong. I ran into the cave only for an equally leveled Deathclaw to turn around and kill me with a single swipe.  fml.
---
On the flip side, though, when you take down your first one solo it will truly be a moment to remember and they will sing your praises in the halls of Valhalla. 
---
I'm a level 10, last night someone dropped a rad-away recipe for me. That's honestly the first nice person I've seen, most of the other players I've met I've avoided though. 
---
Bummer and good tip.
---
If you are on pc I am up for helping with a nuke! 
---
Morgantown is a fantastic nuke spot. Lots of glowing ones and even more nuked flora.
---
Dang
---
I totally knew that! I absolutely did not learn that from your post and after 127 character levels, I swear......
---
I'll agree on that, I built on acid extractor for a while because of that, decided later that only screws mattered and moved to a junk pile though.  
---
But PVP isn't profitable.  The problem is it basically requires someone else to be willing to be involved.  You can't keep killing the high level dude you are capable of killing for caps, because he's not going to keep engaging you.  He'll die once, go incog or server hop and you'll never see him again.
---
Not sure how you could think otherwise, have you actually run into people who keep getting killed but come back for more?  
---
If it's a workshop one loose it after logging off or switching the server. If your camp location is occupied you get a message asking you to stay in the world (your camp won't be placed but you can place it elsewhere and it gets blueprinted or if you don't place it again it comes back when you switch the server and the place is free) or to connect to another server.
---
You won't be playing on the same server twice. 
---
"get out of here, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.!"
---
Scorch beasts are evil. Super hard to kill. Don’t drop anything worth while.  I’d love it if Bethesda changed them to drop better stuff. Or maybe added a perk or mutation to make the scorch beast scream do less damage. 
---
I've found bone clubs on scorched. Never found a bone hammer though.
---
I'd agree with this advice. Shame you cant tell what gives these items.
---
When I was lower level I used my camp to farm crops for adhesive. Other than that, can't say I used it very much except to save on fast travel costs.
---
Maybe I missed something. But I'll ask here and see what I get in return for a answere. Does anyone notice that the weight of everything in your inventory is drastically reduced? I'm not talking the heavy weapons unknown there are perk cards for that. But the melee weapons are reduced to not even a pound where they are supposed to weight more then that. A few of then actually weigh 10 times more then what you have shown in your inventory. Are you running a perk card to reduce all weight of everything in your inventory? Just seems kinda odd that your weapons weight less then a pound on more then a few when they are supposed to be alot heavier that that. 
---
I’d recommend buying some mutation serum off other players. You can probably get them for 200-400 caps each. Go the healing mutation, marsupial and speed daemon. 
---
If you feel lucky. You can farm a mutation from the nuclear disposal site. Search it up in a YouTube video. But buying mutation serum is a better way to go IMO. 
---
ah, i have seen morgantown nuked before, but i was such a low level i didnt even try going that time
---
exactly!!!!!!!
---
Negative coverage came form hive mentality and the game devs not making good decisions and a poor launch it is still a great game with friends who are into fallout and a great game to make friends and the devs clearly still care
---
Isn't "Assault" just what it changes to when you mod Marine?
---
Non-modded:  https://imgur.com/pQP7L3V
---
Modded:  https://imgur.com/PrRz8S4
---
For the other armors, Metal, Robot, Leather, and Combat, each armor has three "starting tiers".  Light, Sturdy, or Heavy.  And all three tiers can get the same mods, improving them further.
---
So you mod Light Leather with Studded and you get Studded Leather Armor.  But if you start with Heavy Leather, and mod it with Studded, it may only say "Studded Leather Armor" again, but it has greater DR/ER, cause it's actually Studded Heavy Leather, not just Studded Light Leather.
---
It appears that Marine only has the one tier.  Listed under "Sturdy" in the crafting menu.  You mod it and it turns to "Assault Marine" but if a "Heavy" version existed, you'd start off with a higher DR/ER rating, and end up higher when you modded it.
---
also its yellow
---
Nice!  If you ever decide you want to sell it rather than respec your character, let me know!
---
Ah. I was going to say. Join me on Xbox I’ll run laps with you but alas 
---
My deathclaw stayed when I went from 11 charisma down to 10. 11 is I think the minimum to tame one of these bad boys. I also took off the Animal Whisperer perk and nada. So i think it’s safe to say once you’ve tamed it you’re good. 
---
I'm looking to make my legendary pieces BOS
---
The other Vaults will be coming with Raid like features to work as a team, my take is this is something not meant to be a solo run.
---
As someone who actually does engage on PVP, there are many people who die, think they can take me now that they know I'm coming, and seek revenge. Also, people on teams are very confident. Last night, a level 60 and 90 kept seeking revenge to try and defend the ammo depot. Eventually, they gave up. Not everyone submits immediately. I would hazard a guess that 40% of players will seek revenge at least once after they die. That is from my experience.
---
That's been a big question since patch 5 updated vendor plans. Mist common thoughts are completing BoS events or the Forbidden Knowledge quest. You can learn the mod by scrapping combat armor, but the RNG for that is a massive pain, but learning it that way will also unlock the bos paint for the combat armor helmet. The guaranteed way with the least effort would be to either find a reddit trader with the plans for sale or to find someone you can trust to mod them for you
---
Mini gun isn’t a good gun to prime to much ammo needed it’s alright normal with the right legendary stats.
---
Who is this legendary grahm?
---
Thanks for the offer anyway
---
&gt;They don't care, they don't want to fight you, the scrap is just scrap. No one does it. It's not part of the game.
---
That's funny I always defend the workshops I claim. Just because people you play with don't is up to them. I absolutely lock up the fusion core machine when I claim that workshop so I can get all the fusion cores I could ever want, same with the ammunition factory. 
---
&gt; the scrap is just scrap. No one does it.
---
So you don't know about the good workshops, like the ammunition factory, the junkyard with titanium, or the power station fusion core factory.
---
&gt;And it shouldn't happen. The workshops don't provide any significant tangible benefit. 
---
So it keeps boiling down to you not knowing how to utilize the workshops to actually get good items like fusion cores, unlimited ammo, and black titanium. Got it.
---
&gt;No one is going to stop looting/crawling through whatever they are in the middle of because you went and touched their workbench. Why would they? 
---
Because unlimited ammo is nice, 100% fusion cores are nice to have if you use PA, and black titanium is used for most end game crafting. All things you can get from the right workshops.
---
&gt;. Why would they? PVP itself has little to no benefits as well. I'll be glad when survival mode is implemented and the PVP twats toddle off to their survival servers to hang out with the rest of the PVP twats. 
---
As I pointed out, because there really isn't anywhere in the game you can farm fusion cores or black titanium as fast as the workshops create them...
---
Also I won't be swapping over to survival, I'll be sticking to the regular servers and I'll claim those workshops and I'll defend them, and if someone has taken them already. Yes I'll fight them and take it off them.
---
Idk why you’re downvoted because you’re right 
---
Man I was scrounging for the skulls. Totally forgot about this area. Thanks!
---
Bandolier makes 5mm weightless. I just sold 5k of it and used 5k in Watoga. 
---
Nobody wants workshops as they are now. Anyone can contest them, then fast travel to go hunt the owner, bypassing the slap system completely. Workshop PVP should take place ONLY at the workshop. If a contester fast travels away, they should automatically lose the contest and PVP flags be reset.  
---
[https://youtu.be/RIZwk-\_FfuA](https://youtu.be/RIZwk-_FfuA)
---
I will start checking. Any certain place within the camp?
---
I mean to craft it your wasting your flux on it.
---
Shit I’d love to buy that too 
---
With player vendors coming soon I really hope we get some more budget, just a 20% would do the trick. I would love to put messages according to what I'm selling like "cheap disease cures &amp; stims", "rare outfits" and stuff, but if the vendors cost any budget at all and they don't increase it I'm afraid a lot of players just won't use the feature.
---
I finally saved enough caps to buy the expensive signs and letters, but there's no point if I don't have the budget. Also wanted to buy the fireplace, but I guess it counts as a light so not enough budget.
---
All you need on that is the Rapid effect to make a tiny bit faster and gg
---
Would be especially helpful for the lower levels still trying to spawn those golfer ghouls 😂
---
Has anybody here seen a bone hammer?
---
I think it should tell us on the map before fast traveling to an event that only has a minute left. There goes 20 caps to waste. 
---
Nope sorry 
---
They seem pretty active on this sub. My friend made a post about a bugged tamed Deathclaw and someone from Bethesda commented within a day saying it’s something weird with certain tamed enemies and electricity in your base that they’re aware of.
---
Lmao that’s been all of my gaming experience on console up until now. I used to play on pc with people from Australia, Japan, and France but once I transitioned some 4 years ago I just got grouped up with West Coast People or East coast people. 
---
Ah. Sorry. Dyslexia auto corrected prime to primary. My bad. And point taken. 
---
Yeah I noticed the 90% reduced weight doesnt realmy effect it. I have another regular sniper rifle and it's the same weight 🤷‍♂️
---
thanks. 
---
It’s a bug. I had a Lever Action that weighed 2.5 with effect and later weighed 10.6
---
Stash was full, and they were wrecking my Camp.
---
I like it
---
It depends on the time as well, i play at very inactive times for PST so I get matched up with people that are Japanese and people from the UK. 
---
I sure it all comes down to load balancing and creating the best experience for the most players. If all the players on the server are in one area, the server can focus all its resources on filling that area with enemies and good stuff. You going off on your own, it does the bare minimum for you since it's focusing all its resources where everyone else is. The converse is true on an empty server. All the focus is on you, baby. Legendaries for days at Watoga and the like. I've found that during a nuke is the best time for me to go complete storyline quests as I don't have to worry about someone triggering enemies to respawn on me and most of the loot is untouched and mobs are smaller.
---
When I take my weight reduction things off all my weapons only come to 955 pounds so that’s nowhere near 100,000 
---
Blunderbusses are old forerunners of the shotgun. The barrels are flared to promote a very broad spread of the pellets, bits of metal, junk, rocks, or chunks of wood that were loaded. The barrels being flared also acted as a funnel, making it easier if you were on horseback to pour powder in the barrel. 
---
Most blunderbusses were rifle-like but they did exist in pistol form, and were (ironically) called "dragons" Horseback cavalrymen who carried them into battle were called "Dragoons"
---
And I'm up for that running with a crew and serving justice sounds good but how long till there are people using the APD kill players? Or act like those dup hunters
---
I play as mother nurse of the Wasteland.
---
I love wandering around the Forest region helping out low levels :)
---
We didn't the time I wrote this post. But did one time about like what u mentioned. 
---
The mods add the weight
---
I wasn't aware you could put stuff in the overseer's caches. 
---
Thank you very much for the advice.
---
Pretty sure the circle jerk thing is "fallout 76 bad" so...
---
Awesome! Thank you! 
---
I don’t have a mule ! 😩
---
Oh wait I just re-read your post, I missed the console part. I'm on PS4, that's probably why I only meet people in my time zone. 
---
I’d say just level and perks affected by that. Keep in mind plans are level gated to when you can craft them. 
---
That’s very cool 👍
---
I’m pretty sure this is caused by the server closing out. Not a computer geek but I assume servers need to periodically clear everyone out, clear their cache and generally refresh and reset. Servers probably close off from public matchmaking after x amount of time but continue to operate until all players vacate. 
---
At early levels I made my camp with just 1 foundation, 1 crafting table, and the stash. It was quick and easy to move my camp to wherever I was and just drop-down the automatically blueprinted block and scrap &amp; store everything.
---
I also had a quick Blueprint for a 1 block foundation that a friend had built 3 turrets on, so if I found myself in a situation where I was getting constantly harassed I could drop that block to give me a little cover fire too.
---
They need to give your time....you guys have a really great concept here.....but FO76 had a lot of problems at launch that obviously made building an audience for the game, and your podcast, a bit difficult.  Now that the game is coming together, with a roadmap for 2019......I think cutting the show now would be a mistake/premature.  Subscribed to the youtube channel...good luck man.
---
It also would be great if you could set that price with a level cap.
---
I.e. set it so that any stimpaks in there are free, but only to those &lt;lvl 15 for instance.
---
Would reduce the “risk” of a higher level taking stuff for free that they don’t need
---
I'm around 600 hours and have put some money into the Atom shop as well so I feel that
---
Watch the video you wanker I address everything 
---
Where was this taken
---
Is that gt
---
That's what I was worried about. I am a solo player so had no way to test if the bag stayed for a bit. Looks like suitcases and garbage cans from here on in. 
---
Yes! This here. Still do able ya just basically need to overencumber  yourself with ammo and stims to kill her lol! Still fun fight. 
---
Wasn't expecting to laugh. Laughed.
---
As well as I think it could be a multiple thing. At 50, 100, 150 etc... Each time it could grant a passive %X damage or move speed xyz. 
---
Clearly I’ve said multiple times I recorded it on the 14th of feb, and I waited to post it to hear back from Bethesda which they never replied to me so I figured I’d post
---
I figured as much :/
---
A super mutant with a heart of gold
---
On Xbox, and have lots of friends to help, but thanks for the offer.
---
One friend always stays in pacifist mode, just to be able to call out locations of the bogeys.
---
Another to remove bounties, and provide coverage if needed, very proficient Task Force.
---
For sure. I have an idea of how I would like to set up some vending machines along with some signage as well, but that's not going to happen unless I get rid of things or they increase the budget. I'm just imagining the vending machines taking up large amounts of budget...
---
Really? What does he do?
---
I've been going after 2 sets of lvl 15 raider PA. That new river gorge bridge spawn does seem to be capped at 15. Have 2 sets with helm torso right arm left leg. That left arm and right leg are ridiculously hard to get lol. 
---
Follow first few quests, it's keeps you more to the left side of the map. Game has some zones where you'll work with quests an then move towards center area an then top right and later bottom right. Enemies tend to get higher in those areas. You should be well in the 25 or higher range if you follow quests an work map in order.
---
Lvl 12 player here. Started just this week again after the BETA. Up until now I needed to run away from other players because they cause the scorched to respawn shortly after I kill them or because monsters see me due to other players just walking away.
---
I'd buy that!  I've been farming for legendary hunting rifles since they came out and have yet to see anything that sweet!
---
Distant thunder events.
---
I have a t51 left leg and right arm learned
---
For the record, using human waste for fertilizer is dangerous. It can cause a wide variety of diseases in people that consume them, and it’s a huge problem in developing nations. 
---
all rise or maybe grognak's axe
---
I had that problem on PC last night.
---
At low levels I made a raised platform with a bed and a crafting table.  It's easy to move and you can use it to get rested bonus, scrap and store material, and as a free fast travel point.  I would put it near whichever town I was currently exploring.
---
Yeah how the fuck would I know a ban wave is coming??????? Nobody did?????? As I said in the video, fuckwit, I recorded my whole inventory on the 14th of feb as insurance to see if I’d lose any of my valuables during the dupe deletion patch 
---
You can try putting your foundation outside of the area you actually want to build in. [Witness](https://i.imgur.com/apsclWL.png).
---
The game won't let you build three foundation squares underneath the overpass. Instead, you have to start putting foundations where the couch is, then the game will let you [clip additional foundations through the wall](https://i.imgur.com/y5GewC5.png).
---
Start with three or four foundations as building blocks. Put the first one outside where you actually want to build, then put down the others like a stepping stone path to see where the actual clipping limit is.
---
Because it is extremely useful and powerful and the developers deem it worthy of two slots.
---
And here’s no paper bag????
---
But how do we now this is the character that caused the ban?
---
Ok. I prefer my slightly less perked Instigating Lever Action myself. ;)
---
I addressed that in the video , fuck people love to watch 30 seconds of a video then make a judgement 
---
The issue is not amount of adds. I didn't mean to imply that. Just something is going on here. It makes fight exciting but the damage to queen seems effected when the adds are present. Last night was most fun I have had doing queen battles since my first one. 
---
If you do decide to recruit me as your own, my PSN is Cabbage_Cultist. I can’t wait to be part of the police...
---
In an inverted sense we could have mail boxes just as a fun way for communication this can also be linked to the mr. messenger missions for a bit of immersion  
---
That reasoning is beyond stupid!
---
I have never felt the need to use the Power Patcher perk card. I would swap that out. Also, you REALLY need to be using the Enforcer perk with a shotgun build. It makes most enemies a lot easier. Mirelurk Queens and Deathclaws are feeble when you take their legs out from under them. I also have an explosive shotgun.
---

Dude did you watch the whole video? I said I have weapon weight reduction Armor and perk cards on at all times to allow me to hold all my weapons, they all weigh less than a pound and when I take all the weight reduction stuff off my weight goes to 955
---
I was just defining the word, I wasn't insulting you
---
90% reduced weight and its still 12 Lbs wow
---
I know :/
---
the first is that this game is still under crap in terms of playability. Even if they make it more fun, they used an ancient dinosaur game engine which has incredibly terrible server issues
---
I also use suitcases and garbage cans but was looking to leave stuff right outside the vault.
---
What perks you have on it? I love lever actions they look so cool

How many frag grenades do you think you collected farming that xp exploit in Morgantown High School? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFIbgx6uIn0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFIbgx6uIn0)
---
But that's none of my business...
---
Any luck fixing this? I know someone having the same issue as well as a "World Found CONTROLS HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY DISABLED".  He is using a 42" ultrawide curved monitor so I wonder if that has anything to do with it.

That makes sense.  I was genuinely curious, by the way, not being a smart ass.  Re-read my comment and noticed it could have been interpreted either way.
---
I have tried this many times with no luck. This gives me hope, gonna have to try again. 
---
I think I ran into OP.  All signals where there but I (noob) did not understand and chickened out. New emotes and I would certainly understand.  I’m on PS4.

Switchblade also to my knowledge doesn't have mods and has a lower base damage. I mainly just think they need mods. Right now it's get sneaks and crits in fast or get one shot if you can't one shot them.

I love the idea of an arcade camp. If this kind of thing were to be implemented, my CAMP would permanently be an arcade. 
---
Come to think of it, they could probably just reuse the arcade games from the Nuka-World DLC. 
---
I don't use turrets, either. 10%? I get not wanting people to have a million turrets, but come on. Most of the time they don't even engage when your base is being attacked. 
---
Good lord, doing literally anything when below level 50 is a pain when high level players are on a server. I'm level 30 trying to do the Watoga quests but the rooftop fight is borderline impossible due to people frequenting the area so much, pushing the Gutsy level from 22-38 to 50-68.
---
And which has lower damage than the unmodded .308 for unfathomable reasons.. just chalk it up to another one of those things that make no sense.
---
It happens on any monitor that's wider than 21:9. No fix for it yet. I haven't opened a support ticket because I'm sure I know what they will say: unsupported resolution / aspect ratio. But still, having those two notification boxes not close since patch 5 is a bugger. They could just fix them to work like before patch 5 and those of us with very wide displays would have everything working. I'll keep you posted.

 Just Instigating for the Legendary. Bought it from Wallace and felt sorry for the guy who did not know what he had.

 Its perked out fairly well. I have not put points into all the Rifleman stuff, just the main cards. Hits at 128 these days.
---
 So Its Hardened and I run a Reflex sight.

 They do not drop there anymore. Just the costumes.
---
It's fine. Someone already explains what you meant.
---
when i have tried to use them they don't actually engage at all - its useless.
---
So I have my Pro (living room) that I currently play on...
---
Bought another disk for my OG (bedroom).
---
Just tried logging in to my mule account on the bedroom PS4 and it asked me to purchase PS Plus...

So I'd use my new account on my Pro, login to the bedroom with my PS Plus account and both would be able to play?

---
It was on one of the Bethesda forums the the admins didn’t call bullshit on the guy who said it so I am assuming it’s true and it does track with when I have taken in the queen it’s only while she is airborne the explosive affect doesn’t seem to work 
---
**edit sorry I don’t have the link to the forum chat I went looking again and couldn’t find it 
---
Server hop server hop server hop

---
Yes you are obviously right, I wasn’t sure with the assault. BUT all of my Marine armor is modded and none of it says assaulted. But i don’t know why. But you’re obviously right and it’s not a tier like heavy combat f.e.
---
Yes! Lol
---
Do the explosive shotgun damage scale up with explosive perks too?
---
Ya.  I've only seen BOS Underarmor plans, Marine Tactical Helmet and Wetsuit, and Marine Torso/Leg/Arm spawn there.  Lots of times.  No BOS Combat Armor mod plans at all there.  It was sad.
---
Luckily I was able to get BOS Torso and Arms from vendors prior to the patch.  And I was able to find someone who sold me a BOS Leg plan for a reasonable price.
---
There should only be two modes.
---
Adventure (PvE)
---
Survival (PvP)
---
The majority of Fallout players do not want PvP. Let the ones who do play on survival servers.
---
We only need two default modes.
---
There will soon be a survival mode with unrestricted PVP.  I you like that sort of thing, but want to  to keep fucking with people in adventure mode,  that means you are the one ruining the game. Not me.
---
Biggest tip I can think of is: when you level up and pick a special attribute to increase, you don't have to get a perk card from the attribute you increased. In other words I can increase my intelligence stat but get a strength perk card. I didn't learn that until very late into my playthrough.
---
Man I had forgotten about the guitar sword. That was a fun weapon 
---
Nope didn't have time to listen to all the whining. Thay is why I asked if I was missing something. Ok then have a nice day. 
---
Yeah, every so often I will find one Golfer Ghoul but I’m only up to 3 out of 10.   I do check the map and if I see a low level in the area then I fast travel, but even those are getting scarce as more PVP guys have started hanging out there. 
---
I usually go to the West-Tek Research Center, its filled with muties and will often times have a couple 2-3* legendaries. Its a good place for leveling up as well with 150+ xp a kill
---
The heating coil is the only mod for the super sledge 
---
There are so many things from Fallout 4 that we need in this game!
---
You need to know which account is designated as your 'home console'. That's the one the person without ps+ needs to play on.
---
I noticed that also...surely it’s bugged?
---
They’re not great. Worst combination of black powder rifles and shotguns
---
I have been playing since the launch. And I have never seen that or a blunderbuss. It's pretty wicked looking, plus you can put two more mods on it. I've also never came across x-01 calibrated shocks either. Which sucks!!! 
---
I ain’t saying make the game easier I just want a level playing field when it comes to some weapons in fallout 4 and new Vegas some of my fav guns were energy based (the recharger one for instance) but to use them in fo76 would be a joke as they are next to useless.
---
as for “Keeping reddit fun”  the tag on this is discussion and some people find it pretty “fun” to talk about the game instead of being a whiny so and so and talking about downvoting why don’t you add something constructive or just leave 
---
Sure then
---
I am if you play in ps4 i can donate some
---
\^This. I usually take them and get everything running, and when I get over 100 cores saved up, I just leave them unlocked and I assume if someone needs cores, they can get them.
---
The problem is the workshop can be contested from anywhere within it now.  It used to be that someone had to approach the workbench and remain beside it until it was claimed. 
---
Which means you could surround the workbench with turrets and traps. And you could shoot him from a distance.  He couldn't pull that stealth melee shit on you. He was stuck in that spot until the workshop was claimed. 
---
So it isn't even a question of PVP vs. PVE. It's about a PVP system that gives  all the advantage to invaders with stealth builds. The defender is at a disadvantage no matter what. 
---
Yeah, like the other guy said; there's only heating coil. Before you farm loads of the same weapon for mods, you should prolly check a wiki to see mods are available
---
What system are you playing on? I'll hop on if PS4 to help out.
---
As a YouTube livestreamer who streams FO76  content (unironically, I might add) you've got a sub from me. I'm going to experience your podcasts on my plane ride home tonight and over the weekend!

300 .44 is not remotely close to worth 100 caps, just so you know.

---
This is a great spot. Generals Steakhouse, too. I've got a small loop I'll run between these 3 places, usually with a pit stop to get more lead at the Lucky Hole, ammo craft, then back in the loop again.  
---
We are working on something for this situation because of the growth of popularity. 
---
I'll definitely give it a shot once they fix how fast they break! I hate having to have a bunch of the same gun
---
So I'm currently signed in on my level 144 in my bedroom...
---
If I signed in as my new character in the living room (primary console) that should work? 
---
Thanks that's what I thought 
---
In the middle half, where the Scorched are defending.  There is the room with the level 3 locked cage area full of goodies.  The barracks with the beds and kitchen.  And the Command Center with the level 3 locked door and passworded access terminal.
---
Inside the level 3 locked cage area are random weapon / PA mod plans / mods.  I found a Calibrated Shock mod (Excavator Armor) on the table next to the weapon's bench with the oil can and 2 miltary grade circuit boards.  As well as various NV Scope and Headlamp mods.  Small metal shelf with the tray and two hide bundles can have a weapon mod plan / weapon mod on it as well (right under the two hides).  Underneath that shelf can spawn a Magazine.  Usually an Unstopables.  Unfortunately sometimes the magazine is clipped too far back and/or thru the floor and you can see it but can't actually pick it up cause you can't get your cursor on it.
---
Inside the Barracks, there are two rusty metal shelves to the left leading up to the kitchen.  Most of my Sturdy/Heavy Robot Armor plans have spawned on the shelf to the left of the fridge.  Sometimes it is Marine Armor plans (Torso, Legs, Arms).  On the first shelf as you turn left there is also a plan spawn.  It has been a bit rarer for me, and last thing I remember there was the Marine Wetsuit.
---
In the Command Center (level 3 locked door with optional password terminal) right across from the door is an Armor Mod plan spawn location.  Last few times it has been there it has been a Robot Armor mod plan for me.  Ultra-light or Biomesh, can't remember which.  A US Government Operatives magazine can spawn on a shelf in the middle of this area too.  The ones that tend to be PVP focused bonuses. 
---
In the room where you actually turn in the Tech Data, the shelves below the point you turn in the data can spawn weapon mod/mod plans.  And in the Storage Key locked room just next to it, you can get a Weapon Mod or Power Armor Mod (I found Excavator Calibrated Shocks there).  Same shelf with the Missile Launch and all the ammo and grenades.
---
There is a bunch of other random loot and junk to be had.  A couple ballistic fiber locations, etc.
---
It's a gold mine if you actually find it untouched.  And the plans actually spawn for you and haven't been looted by someone else already.
---
Thanks I thought .50 cal was the damage dealer but wanted to check. I dont like the mini gun all that much, breaks way too fast
---
I have no facts to back this up, but I think low levels might be put onto servers with other low levels. I just started a new character so I could play with a new player who got the game, and we saw a couple low levels like us. Maybe we just got lucky.
---
Correct. It's all rad damage.
---
Well shit, I think I sold my Scorched Dragon to a vendor. Was that a huge mistake??? I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure it was at least level 45 or 50, especially since thats usually what I've been looting where I picked it up and I'm level 53 or something.
---
Yes and no. I’ve seen fully modded rifles with 1.8 pound weight. It’s said that pre-patch weapons are affected by the bug but post-patch weapons aren’t.
---
Yeah once u start throwing in the rifle perk  points the DPS will get crazy 
---
Thank you so much for taking the time to write this out. Between you and everyone else that has responded I think I have a route to run. Thanks to all
---
I'd like my 60 seconds back thanks 
---
That's really decent to especially if you've not got all the perks.
---
I think I have 1 of each rifleman equipped and this still gets pretty decent damage.
---
Beggars can't be choosers 
---
I love it.  Your story made me laugh.
---
Surely not. The All Rise has a different mod, and that's a super sledge.
---
What platform do you play on
---
That's strange. How does the All Rise have a different mod then?
---
Yes.  It’s a place to cook and respawn, as well as scrap junk to store as soon as you can afford to build any of the crafting stations.  Don’t be afraid to pay to move it around as you level, it won’t become semi-permanent for a while.  Keep in mind it’s also a free fast travel spot.
---
Also don’t be afraid to contest public workshops in low level areas.  It’s great rewards and I think also teaches you lots of basic camp items the first time you claim one.  Don’t worry so much about holding them after the first defense wave,  but it’s a place to build things mostly for free (if the cost for a component is in green it’s coming out of the workshops resources and is free to you) and is another free fast travel spot.
---
Hope this helps 
---
Assuming that your lvl 144 has ps+, yes.
---
That's exclusive to the all rise, trust me I've even made a post about this before.
---
I'm on PC and although not usually very helpful, they seem to be gone. So I would mod your stuff.
---
It's a legendary+unique

As a podcaster myself (although not for gaming, but Wrestling) I know all of the feels you are going through.
---
Subscribed and downloaded a couple episodes to listen on my flight in an hour.
---
I love people like you! I've had so many awesome people give me great plans before and I always pass the buck because of them. I've only had one guy/gal/synth?? attack me and as soon as I hooked up my mic and said hello they stopped attacking me and waved just before exiting the server.
---
I mean, explosive radius wise they seem way weaker than the non-hydrogen bombs we dropped on Japan, so solid idea.
---
Sorry I should’ve noted XB1.  😀
---
Your forgetting the whole time period thing, its not so much that you had 100k of something AT ONE TIME, its that you aquired an abnormally large amount of something over "x" period, say 30 days. And I also said different items probably have different thresholds, they say 100k instead of 1000, because if they used the actual threshold, dupers/cheaters would just stay under the known threshold to avoid detection.
---
You carry/have 955 lbs of equipment, but that doesnt include all the other legendary drops you received in the last 30 days, or all the other legendary items given to you, or bought from vendors.
---
I have 400 hrs in and if we exaggerate the amount of 3 star god roll equipment I have and set it at 1/4 of the amount that you do ( ie I have 4, you have 16+) you would need to have played 1500 hrs or more to aquire those items legit, even mr 900 hrs guy didnt have as many legendaries as you.
---
You may not have 100k legendary items, but you do have hordes more than an average player would have, which is probably why you got flagged and banned. If you never had been *gifted* all those god rolls, you never woulda been banned.
---
And a side note, being given multiple god rolls for no/little caps is probably a red flag aswell, it either means all your friends/viewers are leprechauns, stupidly lucky, or at worst are dupers.
---
Except its not fun now either. Instead its easy kills for griefers who can sneak into any part of the workshop area, start contesting the workshop, then immediately drop you with a VATS crit to the head before you even know you're in a fight. 
---
And here I am just praying for respawns all the time, to the point where I want to get my alt account character to a high level so I can just use it to constantly respawn everything in Whitesprings.
---
That aside, do we have confirmation that Survival Mode is going to be exclusive to newly created characters only? I really hope it is, and I know BGS said they would take our feedback on it (which was thousands of people on here saying to NOT let existing characters play on the new modes), but do we have actual confirmation?
---
Personally I'm not going to follow the story much if we have the opportunity to roll fresh. I'll get the few quests done that give me all the workbenches, then focus on taking workshops, defense quests, and grinding certain spots (not just Whitesprings since that will be utterly flooded with people). Being a full PvP server, the race to become powerful will be brutal.
---
I dont have plans for power armor frame do you know where they can be found? Or should I take out chassis from stash and place it then attach everything, then place it back in stash? I have a lot of power armor pieces, only a few are level 50, but I have no cores because they die so damn fast. Anyone know where I can find cores for power armor?
---
Found the plan for the marine lead lined chest mod if you want it.
---
"Don't put it out with your boots, Ted!!"

Bumped into one walking south towards Point Pleasant. It was surprisingly easy to kill, one .308 shot sand it went down.
---
Uncanny caverns!
---
Thx bruh 
---
&gt; first impressions are actually pretty good, in spite of the mass of negative coverage the game has got.
---
That's how social media and sensationalized society works. Things are either amazing or terrible. There is no in between.
---
Me and some of my mates have alt characters we have set up as raiders full gear and all and we will go and take workshops around the map when we are bored and don’t want to do the queen we try to keep it reasonably civil we will only kill you once unless you seek revenge and then we leave if you take the workshop back we will give you time to collect your resources and stash em in a box normally about 20 mins but then we will take it again we don’t really take junk maybe a bit of plastic here and there so asking as you don’t seek revenge and appear red you can come and collect your stuff. We have found it’s the only way in game to really farm caps other than your once a day vendor run plus the defend you get straight after always give some decent stuff but we don’t really build anything on the workshops if you were low enough we might build some stuff for you for when you retake it (normally a fusion generator) but that’s about it 
---
Camp McClintlock is my go to place! Plenty of clipboards to scrap!
---
Definitely fucking something up... Still asking me to purchase ps plus.
---
They max out at I believe 50% dmg boost. Maintaining addictions is actually surprisingly hard though, and that requires 5 of them IIRC.
---
thanks for the info. If you play on PC add me infinitehrzn
---
Horizon's Rest and Helvetia make up a really good Screw run at low levels.  Easy enemies, and if you get there with all the loot intact and take everything, you can hit both areas (they are side by side) with about 40-60 screws depending on your container luck.  Lots of Fuel Canisters, Typer Writers, hot Plates, etc.
---
Horizon's Rest will be full of either Scorched or Super Mutants.  Helvetia is full of Scorched (never seen anything else spawn there).
---
A good amount of other loot to be had as well.
---
It is a popular run, so you may have trouble finding it unlooted.
---
Sorry no can do
---
I thought we were on Pacifist?  I mean we never engaged in fighting them, though since I left the front door unlocked I guess they were able to just walk in and destroy everything. 
---
At first the grenades were just destroying items around us though when we fell, I actually seemed to start taking damage from their hits (which was why i finally engaged).
---
A little messed up that anyone can essentially waltz in and go to town on your camp.
---
Why can't there be more people like you working at Bethesda? A nuke mine going off on a looter would be so great...

---
thanks for everyone's help, using the map with vendors, would be nice if they weren't all tied to factions, would be nice if they had more than 200 caps, would be nice if when I buy stuff off them they put more than 5% of it in their cap stash.... so many tedious things.
---
I'm a weirdo.
---
You should be able to pick up a sledge (level 10) from a super mutant and then later a super sledge (level 30).  The mutants that run at you, rather than firing a gun, usually have some sort of melee weapon.   But, the sledges are heavy so you need to invest in strength early and you’ll be stuck with a melee build for a while.  
---
Alternatively, you could stick with swords, etc. which are lighter and would let you build towards more of a gun or assassin type build, as you wouldn’t have to focus as much on strength.  
---
But yeah, pick up the first one you find and then swap it out with better ones as you go.  I started off with a Chinese officer sword.  I found it much better for dealing with bugs, roaches, and radrats     
---
What the hell am I doing here?!

You can server hop at Charleston and farm the two Grafton monsters you get from 30 to 50 caps for killing both no fast  travel required plush all the acid you could ever want 
---
Only problem was he was inside but I do like this.  Next time I can lie in wait and do some sniping :)
---
You know I would sacrifice the use of one of the arms if I could use that gauntlet
---
Imo the major fuss was server stability, and Bethesda mostly fixed it. It lags a bit when the nuke goes off, and it's laggy in nuke zones, but otherwise the game runs well. Rarely are there random disconnects.

Hm, the more you know. Is it a problem because it is not being composted properly? I use Chicken manure in my garden at home, but I need to mix the poop and allow it to compost for 1 year. If it is not composted then the poo is too "hot" (too much nitrogen and will essentially burn your plants) and it carries diseases that can be spread to the food.
---
I'm on PS4 thanks for the offer
---
how much is a bunch?
---
If you get caught there should be a penalty, maybe a bounty to the value of said caps. Should make it real.

Hmm...ok.  I havent really done much of the story yet.  I thought I'd kind of get setup first.

To me griefing is when a player goes out of their way to mess with and try to ruin another player's game experience.  I've encountered quite a few players like that.  
---
These are the type of people who just destroy other people's camps for no good reason(not talking about the people who go after the Whitesprings or Charleston camps that screw with players), who attack you for pvp and keep attacking when you make it clear you aren't interested, and the people who just keep messing with you just to get their kicks.

I apologize I’m not looking to pay for them just need someone to craft them for us.  Was throwing in the caps for the time!

You gotta check it hourly it's maxed at 200 rounds.  I get more 5.56 from uranium fever then the factory.

Get fireproof maxed and a dense mod on your chest armour. Makes scorchbeasts way easier.....

Find a tactical marine helmet plan (sellable for 27 cap each for 1 glass 1 plastic and 3 rubber), a top hat plan (sellable for 32 cap each for 1 cloth) or skeleton costume plan (sellable for 54 caps each for 5 cloth and 2 plastic) and craft many of them.

I recommend using super duper when you craft them.

 Glowing Meat is very good, farm those Molerats and glowy stuff. I've taken to picking the Legendary guy from a Mutie pack and murdering him. That's not that effective really they usually drop crap. Fun though.
---
 Water and drugs make a lot of my money. I don't do any but they pile up. Just walking the world which I do a lot, brings me stuff to sell. 
---
 I did farm for 40 levels on my present so its second nature for me.
---
Interior is affected? But that's not the case with Whitesprings ...
---
I wanted to stop in point pleasant when we drove through west Virginia, but my coworkers said no. Lol
---
* Golf outfits from white springs \~14 caps a piece
---
* Bulk junk (using tinker's bench)
---
* Sell drugs you don't need/want
---
* Purified Water (sells for 3/each and you can farm like 20/hr with a medium water purifier at your camp)
---
* Sell extra weapons, food, etc.
---
I usually do a run or two through high enemy areas, then craft a ton of bulk and sell it along with all the extra weapons I don't need. Can usually go through my cap limit with all the vendors (so like 800-1000 caps) in one big run. Takes a bit of time, but usually do this every couple of days.
---
It would be great if they lowered the prices across the board and gave everyone who purchased atoms a rebate to account for the difference. If they also dropped a ton of stuff for people to buy, then those that got a rebate wouldn’t feel so cheated if they’ve got nothing left to buy. Also, you’re right on the point that the atom shop is what keeps people playing. Once you’ve gotten all of the quests done, what’s left? Aside from grinding for better gear and trying out new builds, it’s going to be the challenges. Those give Atoms of course, and having some sweet skins and C.A.M.P. items to aim for is what makes them rewarding in the end. 
---
Nuking the General in the Mire, and catching the cranberry farm, pops decent mirelurks and their queens, sometimes legendary. But not necessarily any more frequently legendary than random mirelurk queen encounters in the same area. However, it is a guaranteed queen encounter, which doesn't otherwise happen in that area. I wonder if this applies to other areas you commonly find mirelurks.
---
A PA arm mod that allows fitting of fist weapons would be cool
---
 Its called a mike. Mine is on.
---
Didnt notice heaps of it there, do you know any other places bro? 
---
So your wife doesn't have a psn account? Is that what I'm fucking up?
---
Currently logged in to PSN on my mule account... 
---
Didnt notice heaps there, do you know of any other places bro? 
---
The ratio of legendary spawns and hardened/glowing mass drops is low in Monanga compared to Whitesprings, the General, or Harpers Ferry. Especially the masses.
---
I would hit up Grafton Steel in the Far East of the toxic valley and claim the workshop.  You get good xp from the waves and there are a lot of mutants in the factory itself - which are a good source of xp, caps, gunpowder and grenades.  Watch out though because claiming the workshop makes you a pvp target.
---
Leaving the area and returning leads to a pretty quick respawn of the mutants.  Traveling up the hill to the power cables should be far enough to trigger the reset.
---
The ash heap is the big black area in the far south - and if you do go make sure you bring a gas mask because the air is toxic and will give you disease.  You can reliably find a gas mask in one of the armored transports in the parking lot of Poseidon energy.
---
Why does Lone Wanderer 3\* take 4 slots, penalizing the anti social, oh mah outrage, it's non inclusive, where's my safe space. It's not really that strong a card in my opinion 20% less damage +30 AP regen, maybe I'm wrong.
---
Not a tab, but a way of sorting that also labeled how it was sorted by the sort button would be more appropriate. 
---
I don't have them all, but most and willing to help out if you want. 
---
Exactly!
---
 I actually see the most Robot stuff on Wallace at Harper's Ferry.
---
Two shot sometimes has VATS and accuracy problems.  (I had one test case where it would only hit 95% Vats shots every other time.)  For stealth sniping an Instigating is great, more predictable.  
---
The build looks good, but Tormentor is  better with an auto/Commando build than with Rifleman.  It procs well with a large mag semi-auto handmade, but with slower rifles isn't as useful, at least in my experience.
---
Even if I am a 'bit' late : Another function of the terminal is as kinda masterswitch. You can set all connected switches to on or off simultaniously
---
yeah, I might try at least once. Thank you very much.
---
Look for the trees they are everywhere. But yea if u bomb the farms in the forest u can get a ton the problem is then you don’t get any mass 
---
Checked a few times. Will keep checking. Thank u

He's a wise wandering trader.

He's a traveling vendor who wanders around the map.
---
Looking suitably badass for the task at hand.
---
I would welcome this, I hate leaving plans and ammo in random cases at train stations... I plan on building a verandah at the front of my camp where I intend to place the upcoming brewing station, kind of like a communal space for entertaining; a gift container would be a perfect edition. 
---
Lol just so you know stealing by picking a lock gets you a wanted tag. It sounds like it was unlocked so it doesn’t count as stealing. 
---
Fusion cores are not that rare once you know all the power armor spots. Consider doing the powering up Poseidon event as that will give you plans to make different generators 
---
You monster! Lol

I have them all and can help you out later. GT HiddenMayhem

Isnt that the violet furns or something

What do the printers actually do? (Enclave)

If you're cold he's cold. Let him in!
---
Several quest legendaries have unique mods. Perfect storm, Bunker Buster, hell even the gun from Mistress of Mystery. 
---
Yup ,many. Use one every day I play on my level 41 alt. 
---
Only to the flares I'm afraid. It also won't fire very close to your camp. Not a very good anti sb device. May he usefull to set up in a blast zone on sbq when she lands for a ground phase tho. They should about cover a whole nuke zone in range if you drop camp just out front.
---
I &lt;3 my lvl 50 All Rise, the only thing that could make me part with it is if I could get my hands on a Bloodied Super Sledge...
---
Ok if  you are going to use your materials, figure out how much you will need to make however many you want I'd be happy to do the crafting at no cap cost. My payment will be whatever the super duper perk card makes as a bonus. If that works for you, I'm online and available to do it now.
---
Wait different categories, those have unique LEGENDARY effects. All rise has a unique mod. My bad.
---
My tip - try an limit the number of guns you carry, take a long range an then medium to close. Then hopefully you can stick to say only .308 and 10mm. Use a melee too. Kill the robots around Flatwoods to get things like Steel, Aluminum, an Lead. Look for other resources/deposits too. Red Rocket in Flatwoods has a tinker station too. Don't pick up ammo your not needing. All of this will help you with weight management too.
---
He looks so sad doesn’t he? 
---
If you're only putting three points into a weapon type get one point in basic/expert/master instead of three points in one card. That will give you +30% instead of +20%. 
---
3\* Shotgunner =20%
---
1\* Shotgunner/Expert/Master =30%
---
Same with other specializations.
---
Bone clubs have been in the game since release. 
---
thanks for that. I will probably remove it. I have a place on a cliffside and something attacked it from just beyond the cliff (only stuff on that side of my camp had damage)  I was hoping it would secure my place while I was not there. will just put in more rocket launchers I think.
---
thanks again
---
It would actually make the flare gun useful instead of just a gag 
---
I know that which is why it should be increased to 5 pounds instead of 1 pound
---
Lol very clickbaity and looks a little staged but still funny 
---
With vending, you could just put it up for zero caps.
---
Hey heavy laser if it's an option. Add spotlights near them in the direction you want them to cover. Works fairly well.
---
Awesome what is your gamer tag!  We’ll invite you.  
---
The robots kicked people out because of a scheduled renovation. That renovation is now complete so they aren't going to kick people out.
---
phishntrips
---
I wonder if this could be used to access out-of-bounds areas or anything similar... Hmm
---
Depending on the time, I'm down. 
---
put your junk away next time, and harvest your ammo often, lesson learned
---
I've seen Camden Park nuked. It was uneventful :(
---
As other have stated, if it's not locked, it's fare game. I always leave resource collectors in my workshops unlocked because I don't care if people take stuff from them. Sometimes I even write "Free fusion cores!" on the side of the FC generator.
---
On rare occasions I am low on something, I might lock it, otherwise, have at it.
---
Robots are unaffected by nukes

Oh that. I just assume those folks are 9 year olds venting their aggression for lack of a better outlet.
---
it's so much better now, plus there is loads of content
---
Try up by Morgan town l,the George junkyard has a couple of giddy up butter cup parts that give screw,as for you stash try building you own
---
She does have a psn account. Just not ps+.
---
Fuck. That was a depressing read. But you're not wrong. It would certainly lead to a separate branch of the Brotherhood, but there's no reason they couldn't /wouldn't be reintegrated at some point down the line. 
---
Not true, go to Watoga after the city itself is nuked. Plus robots in all blast zones drop hardened and I believe glowing masses.
---
I checked this out! Pretty awesome.  May try to place my camp there. Most of my friends end up coming to my camp anyway lol
---
Launching on PC, soon?
---
Invest in the hard bargain perk and sell bulk junk, chems and weapons you don't want or need. 
---
Why didn't you put your junk away
---
didn't have time 
---
ayo u got a gf? i would like her now ty
---
Do what I do. Run T60 legs with calibrated shocks 
---
I have a stash box in my little shack by the river.  At the workbench, I cannot scrap anything that is in my stash box, I have to move to my inventory first.  Is this the way it's supposed to work?
---
I have been farming lead, acid and steel so have built up thousands of rounds of most ammo types.
---
Am on xbox and happy to share some for free.
---
Xbox: RebelsAdvocate
---
I "accidentally" take/-all'd an entire junk bag once at the golf club while there was still Danger. Realised about 0.3 seconds later and felt bad
---
Oh, okay then. Well, drop a nuke at Morgantown or Charleston and check out the interiors, interiors are definitely affected by nuke zones
---
Also, I just logged in, went to my shack, there's a two headed calf in here.  All my walls are up, roof, and my door was closed.  How did it get in there??
---
Its top 3 must have workshop. Bethesda expressly stated you have to defend workshops. Get the "ammo smith" perk if you you don't want to PVP
---
I've done Morgantown, didn't see this to be the case, but then again, I'm not sure I went inside the airport or high school during that run, because of Whitesprings experience.
---
Yes! This is so annoying
---
Move it to your junk to your inventory and scrap it all
---
The last laugh perk card should put the grenade in the dropped bag!!! That would be awesome 
---
wtf?
---
No that’s straight up psychopathic behavior. Your “coworker” has serious mental issues that are the hallmark of real life criminals. 
---
I'll find a vid to link, hold on. Think you've been missing out lol
---
Do you have any mags besides stinging?
---
Will contact you tomorrow 
---
This is bugged for sure. My BE Harpoon gun lasts ages, even with Flechette mod on it. Gatlign Plasma has the same issue if it's explosive.
---
I mean you can earn close to 600 a week with dailies and challenges. I still have over 8k banked having spent 4k.
---
Hunt super mutants at Harper's ferry, top of the world and sunny top ski lanes. Most have caps on them &amp; you can make decent money selling assault rifles etc. 
---
All locations have a vendor near bye so becoming over encumbered isn't an issue. 
---
When you can't get any more caps from this vendors jump to white springs or watoga to get rid of extras..
---
Plenty of Xp to gain &amp; amusing mutant quotes.
---
Even if location has scorched or mole men you can still make profit from their gear.
---
Not spending another penny until the camp budget increase that’ll probably never happen. They need more military and survivalist style skins and outfits too, most of them are novelty items that I have absolutely no interest in. 
---
Sorry, Xbox one 
---
Well, they still fire a physical projectile.
---
“...if someone wants to contest it... I’ll hand it over.”
---
so i’m asking, u got a gf? i would like to have her. plz hand her over.
---
Please add your show to Stitcher and other podcast apps.
---
Ammosmith plus Super Duper and they would be like "What Ammo Depot?"
---
If you are xbox I'm happy to give you some 5.56 as I've made thousands over the last few days. 
---
Don't engage in the only PvP mechanic in the game is you don't want to PvP.
---
Crafting ammo is way more efficient than taking the factory anyway.
---
I do Farming Resources is for shotgun shells and Ammo factory is for 556 it dosen't matter because pvp shouldn't even be in the game as broken as the combat system is I have to use the ammo factory though because efficiency this game is all about resource and time management I play this game based off of time and resource efficiency Xp should only be farmed at white springs via server hoping and nukes and SBQ should be avoided at all cost as they cost more resources than you can farm for doing the events   
---
What platform are you on me when are you playing? I see low level people pretty much every day. 
---
“I got memed “ hahahaha 
---
*Immersion shatters*
---
I believe i have 4 different mags
---
You launching now as I'm XBox and am fully tooled up
---
only if your making for 1 type of ammo 
---
What does ISO mean?
---
Good to know, thanks a bunch!
---
I subscribed in Google Play, but I prefer Stitcher, so please add your show there. Love the fact that you talk about bugs and how the game could and should be improved. The other FO76 podcast I listened too, was so stupidly optimistic I had to stop listening.
---
Yepp, junk items need to be scrapped from your inventory before being put in your stash, just keep broken down components or bulked items in your stash. Breaking it down before you put it in will help reduce the weight in your stash too. Junk weighs more than the components it  breaks down into most times.
---
When using the crafting bench, try to craft and item that needs screws, if you dont have any it will be greyed out, and if you look at the bottom of the screen, there is a button you can press to mark that missing item. After you mark the missing item(s) any item you find in the world will have a magnifying glass next to its name, if that items breaks down into one of the things you have marked.
---
And just keep trucking, by the time you hit your high teens your box will be almost full of junk.
---
This right here I have never had a need to actually take a workshop for anything you can easily get the resources from other places and much faster imo 
---
Taking workshops is a reasonably speedy way to farm XP, 250 for taking the workshop, another 250 for defending it... take two or three per session and that's 1000+ XP. Additional it may not seem much but craft every opportunity you get; collect the meat from every kill, harvest every soot flower and bloodleaf you come etc etc, it soon adds up. And then there's the events, however trivial or stagnant they might get, it's another 250-350 XP in the bank. 
---
An atomic shop post I thoroughly agree with for a change. Well stated!
---
Sneaks and criticals do not multiply off the same damage number. Criticals use the damage of your gun before any bonuses. Sneak attacks and likely headshots use the damage your pipboy tells you. They call these two Paper and Base damage. Formula looks like this for criticals:
---
Paper + Base(critical mods)
---
Presumably for a sneak critical you would apply the sneak and headshot to Paper damage, then do the critical calculation for Base damage, and finally add the two together.
---
Yes, 30% more effective ghoul healing
---
I'm sorry I'm being such a pain in the ass...
---
On her console, she signs in to her psn? Or just logs in as the "user"?
---
Nevermind simultaneously playing, I can't even get just my secondary account (no ps plus) to play on my (ps plus) Primary Console
---
Do get a pop-up saying (confirming your licenses for using content on this ps4) then nothing...
---
Press any button to start and it brings up the ps plus sub screen lol
---
It's frustrating because obviously people are able to do it... 
---
I gave you an upvote because I'm level 240 and didn't know. Yes, 2-4-0, didn't know. Done plenty of trades too.
---
Harassment for it's own sake. Attacking for no reasonable reward.
---
He is a vendor that wanders around with a brahmin, he usually doesn't have much stuff in him or caps but his dialogue is funny. 
---
  He is aware he is a supermutsnt and talks about before times 
---
 That makes no sense at all. I run only first person and have never used VATS in thousands of hours of 3D Fallout play. Immersion. 
---
 Talking to the guy in front of me makes immersion better.
---
I agree. Workshops would be so much nicer if I could take them, let them churn for a few hours, and come back to them with a few hundred metal ores, 20-30 fusion cores, etc. No one wants to hang around them all day - you take them then let them do their thing while you do other stuff.
---
The acid extractor limited to 10 hurts as well, I like to take hemlock holes for the acid, but it doesn’t actually even produce enough acid to smelt the other ores that you can get at the workshop 
---
Thanks for the tip. I'm definitely gonna try this out tonight.
---
That too. But I’m not mistaken the renovations are still in limbo as the bot are waiting the renovations to be confirmed by a human official. You read/heard about that part during tiny quest it gives you. 
---
 But also why after 25 if the renovations are completed can’t we rent a room. The bot says that they aren’t accepting new stays at the resort but guest can still use the shops and the golf course. 
---
Agree but it shouldn’t be Abel to be used in player trading
---
This one is easy- involving someone in your entertainment without their consent or against their will. Forcing or fooling them in to PvP or interrupting their gameplay for the sole purpose of interrupting their gameplay.
---
They weren't near me, looks like that's where I went wrong.
---
Idk
---
You probably built on its spawn point.
---
You mean you hope they fix the entire game right?
---
Murder, stalking, theft, sabotaging quests, destroying camps.
---
Are you certain that console is set as your primary? Try your mule on the other ps4 and see what happens.
---
That’s the thing:  players shouldn’t need to be assisted by higher levels as often as currently required.  Lower levels are either on regular corpse runs in areas we’re being sent to by low level quests or we’re being packed around by end-gamers.
---
Occasional assistance is appreciated, but I’ve felt
---
ripped off a couple of times when a high-level tears in and clears the area. 
---
I enjoy the challenge, but it needs to be achievable.
---
&gt; It's crazy, everytime I've been attacked by someone with an explosive gun I enter area chat and, without being angry or insulting, politely ask if they paid caps or traded for it...everyone including you got them as a legit drop! 
---
So because you think, with no evidence, some people are lying, I am too? [https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal). Do you understand how annoying it is for people who farm legendary weapons to have people always accuse them of getting them Illegitimately? I've gotten three two shot explosive handmades from drops (usually with one random effect like +1 Agi), and I don't even use the explosive handmade because I don't want to kill myself.   
---
Also, while I didn't buy mine, the idea someone buying a gun also somehow makes their progression invalid is fucking ridiculous. The game is DESIGNED to have trading. I'm sure a lot of the weapons floating out there probably came from dupes, but since there's no way to prove it, and people buying weapons for caps aren't exploiting, you trying to imply their progression is invalid due to no fault of their own is not only wrong, but pathetic.   
---
Its pathetic this kind of "I've decided that you're a cheater so your progression isn't valid" mentality. Its people like you, gatekeeping this game, that really stunt the growth. The idea that if a weapon is "Op" in your opinion, it can't be legit, and that it somehow means the reason you're dying isn't because you're unable\\unwilling to properly gear yourself.  Get good, or accept being bad. Don't blame other players for your own inadequacy. 
---
Just to add to my earlier post. We didn't shoot first. An SOB level 266in a golf outfit just came up and attacked me with a Deathclaw Gauntlet for no reason. We left the area and the next thing I know he comes up to me and I flash him the WTF? emote. He then flashes the heart sign and then kills me again. I have met many really good people in this game, but this guy was a total douche.
---
Take mine in return. I learn something new almost every day, at least it feels like it. 
---
No. I'd say it might be the radiation symbol. Or it might be a hydrocarbon. 
---
Agreed, though I find it hard remembering a time when they were :(
---
Must be so cool to see irl the things in the game 😊 Hope you and your wife had a great trip and thanks for sharing! 
---
Probably balance for ammo since it costs less to make 180 .50 than 100 .308 rounds
---
I can help im just getting on
---
I had 10+ pre L10's on my server earlier this evening (GMT) a handful of 100+ and the rest ranging from L20 through to L70 and no wanted. I'm unsure of how many of those pre L10 players are genuine newbies or alt characters? 
---
Heck yeah. Not sure how long they stay, but I figure people might see the items quicker. 
---
I was actually thinking about doing this in my vending machine at my camp when released. Set the price at 0 for some things. 
---
I don't know the exact location name, but the giant satellite dish you see on the map (on the border between the Savage Divide and The Mire) has like... Forty desk fans, five or six globes and a few typewriters, which are a great source of screws. 
---
If that's too risky for you, most office buildings in Appalachia have typewriters and fans, so basically go to any pre-War office building. 
---
I disagree that workshops are designed for pvp. I agree pvp is part of owning a workshop, but it's not designed for it. That's like saying your new cellphone was designed to go on to Reddit.  Yes you can go on to Reddit with your cellphone, but that's not what it's designed to do.
---
In search of, I'm looking to buy. 
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
Super Mutants drop a lot of caps. My go-to method of cap earning is just looting every single loose item in the Whitespring and then selling it to the vendors. If all factions run out of caps, I than just scrap whatever's left to use for crafting. Muh immersion isn't broken, doing this, since I don't need to server hop or nothing.
---
Says the guy who took opinions personally and attacked me. :D
---
You should use the pressure plate to start the chain reaction
---
So far my favorite power armor to roam around in. I love it. 
---
Farm Mothman eggs. Made into an omelette they fetch 22 caps each with Hard Bargain. You can get 28 per run. 
---
Straight jackets from Fort Defiance make 44 caps each, with Hard Bargain.
---
Sell excess Chems.
---
Craft and sell Healing Salve.
---
Yeah. That'll certainly slow down recruitment. 
---
But I do kinda see their point. There's a lot of fucked up people out there. I'm sure some would be eager to sabotage. 
---
I'm the OP and I ready used this analogy but here it goes again. Saying that workshops are designed for PvP is like saying your cellphone was designed to go on to Reddit. Yes you can use your cellphone to get on Reddit, but the phone was designed to do so much more. If you are using workshops solely for PvP then you are missing a huge part of what workshops are designed to do.
---
Darn it, I’m on pc and have the red outfit 😕
---
Toy cars and trucks are a good source
---
I use pharma-pharma and sell the extra simpacks and chems I get. This lets me easily clear out all of the vendors, as bathrooms nearly always have first aid boxes, and there are always a few chem containers at each location.
---
I can help in 6-7 hours if need be
---
Hint hint
---
They probably shouldn’t have made it so easy to take their access cards.
---
True facts to be sure 
---
There the town above the Monogah power plant. Is Wavy Willards any good? What about Lewis Town?
---
Haha oh but I do!
---
It'll only flag up if the owner has placed a lock on the extractors/resource generators. I always leave mine unlocked and the only way I know that another player has taken from them is when I return to collect the harvest only to find there are no resources to collect.
---
I can help whenever 
---
It’s funny how every faction you join wants the BOS out of the picture
---
The best armor is polished Heavy metal for DR, studded heavy leather for ER, BOS heavy combat overall, and trapper armor for rad resist.
---
Just don’t use it right now 
---
My ps4 username is Jakers_ginger. Just let me know when you're on should take less than 30 min
---
I just don't random trade anymore at all. 
---
I have only accepted an trade request a couple 3-4 times and each time it is some lowish level player wanting my lv 50 all rise or a key piece of armor I am currently wearing, all while having zero items of value or interest themselves. 
---
Just... no man. Player vending hopefully is a nice path forward. 
---
I will be on in about 10 mins
---
Yes I will take one War Machine suit please
---
The train car just north of watoga station has them sitting on a crate next to a skeleton, but its a random spawn and is one of only a few places to find BoS plans since the patch broke them.
---
Anywhere that spawns plans in the cranberry bog area around watoga has a small chance to still have these plans. Aside from that its just the very rare chance from the forbidden knowledge
---
😭😭😭 danng it 😭😭
---
I think Nuka Crypt explains the process.
---
The problem is, even if you know the process, there's still potential ambiguity.  You have to translate the keys into a scrambled word, and there is often more than one word they could unscramble into.
---
Right?  
---
I've played for about 10 hours and have found one, saw what ammo it used and thought that'll be hard to find so scrapped it, 30mins later I see I'd picked up 50 balls for it somewhere along the way..
---
Try nuking morgantown. There's plenty more ghouls there, i dont know why people still nuke only whitesprings.
---
It's an aoe weapon. The lightning arcs. While it's not particularly good against one target, it's great against large groups
---
Of course they do. 
---
They are powerful adversaries and they arnt going to take orders from anybody that isn't Brotherhood. 
---
They explain how to decrypt things. We can do that no problem. But I want to know the actual quest steps or in game mechanisms. Does the printer spit out the code at some point?
---
I don't want to circumvent that stuff my first time by using a site or figuring it out outside of the game 
---
Yep... My main works on both...
---
Mule works on neither...
---
Also confused as to which psn needs to be logged in and switching users on the console and whatnot 
---
Whoa, I'm having to make do with my crafted L50 sniper  built with the hunting rifle plans and that's a poultry 96 damage. 
---
"confirming your licenses for using content on this ps4"
---
Got that message to pop a few times... No idea what that's about
---
I saw the Flatwoods Monster there 
---
I don’t like the idea to be honest. As of right now, bot PA and regular armor have their own benefits. PA has a very high DR and rad res, where regular armor shines due to the legendary effects. 
---
PA with legendary effects like sentinel, vanguard or something would be waaaay overpowered. If they ever decide to put legendary effects on PA, it should be passive effects which benefit the player in situations where PAs are mostly used, like in nuke zones.
---
I can’t think of a good example-perk right now but think of it like the special raid armor effects in games like destiny. These effects are only usefull in raid encounters. 
---
This would be something I’d support. Regular legendary effects on PA – not so much.
---
 how big is aoe?
---
Yeah I get what your saying however, we shouldn’t have to no be able to use something because they can’t fix their game.

I have learned to be very wary when I see a high level with a low level on the map. It could just be a guy with his noobie girlfriend, but you never know until it's too late. Except for last night when a LVL 266 next to a 50 killed me for no reason. And I'm wearing an X-01 packing some serious heat. Snapped me like a twig.
---
Non-existent.
---
Instead, it jumps between close target to chain damage through a group.
---
Ladders would require a new animation or load screen and for a camp item I don’t see it. But for a world thing yes. 
---
Yeah this happens with lockpick. Now it's just annoying at lvl 200+ to hear the level up noise then search through for the three perk cards just to get tongs...
---
True but that’s the situation right now unfortunately 
---
Rifle Gaming hit the water park in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saHaGl2D_JI) but he didnt say anything special about it other than its a good place to get flux
---
Your mods are causing it. 
---
Don't do Mayor For a Day until Level 50+.  
---
The quest reward (All Rise) scales to your level. A level 30 All Rise sucks. A level 50 All Rise rocks.
---
If you fully repair the nuclear power plants for the events you get 100 caps. I do those events every time I see them.  It takes less than 15 minutes, and you get rewards you can sell too.
---
Quite true, but one can hope.
---
I feel so dumb for not making that connection having done the "One violent night" event or w/e it's called only this morning :(
---
Yup. But worth it for new content 
---
Sugar Grove and the National Radio Astronomy place are both good targets.
---
Good work! The community needs more of these tests.
---
Followup tests:
---
What happens when a player steps on a mine planted by another player? I'm going to guess no damage, based on the other tests.
---
Long-term sustained attack. Lock on with a full auto and fire for 10 seconds. How much damage?
---
Does being in power armor affect the amount of damage given in slaps? Does the slapped player being in power armor reduce the slap damage? It shouldn't, but you know Bethesda...
---
Tesla rifle arcs?
---
Fire damage...ie molotov cocktails?
---
I agree. it's way overpriced. the flash sale item prices are still steep, imo. 
---
also  ...just one example: charging full price for each color of wood laminate is gross, I bought 1 bc it was the only one and to have another released so shortly after for same price was frustrating. 
---
and limited time items for sale make me want to uninstall on principle alone. it's not very nice for paying customers. it forces people to purchase atoms with real money because they may never see it again or punishes people that may not even have logged in for a day to miss out on content.
---
lower prices with everything available all the time would not only sell more stuff but shift the feeling  to more of a company actually wanting to make the customer happy.  it just feels like greedy predators right now...
---
I have not bought atoms in awhile and don't want to spend them, instead focusing on challenges to get free atoms and still not spending them. 
---
From the photo gallery, one can choose any picture taken to be the character card photo for that given character. Simply take/choose any picture of your liking that the character in question has in their photo gallery, and set it to be the “ID” photo. 
---
?
---
Nice thanks!

---
1. Punctuation 
---
2. Don’t claim workshops if you’re not ready to defend them.
---
3. I’ll keep attacking every claimed workshop i can find.
---
I don’t have a mic btw so u will have to just pass me stuff also u will have to note down what you gave me so my stuff isn’t mixed up with yours.
---
Great advice but I just want the robots to stop shooting at me, and the character i'm running on is a vats-focused pistol/shotgun build, not a melee build. 
---
Plus i'm honestly not sure how i'd even level up fast. I've gone up about 7-8 levels in the past week from doing nothing but main story quests. That seems a bit slow to me
---
Why not just one card for all of it but it’s specialized so you can change the ranking 1, 2, 3?   I guess that would mean changes to artwork but I also can’t stand having to switch through all that all the time. 
---
Or just change them to being base perks, that you always have without expending a point one you’ve unlocked them. No one wants to play this way, do they? Lol
---
Glad I wasn’t the only one thinking it
---
I wouldn't mind PVP if it wasn't broken
---
It’s best use to me is tagging all the enemies in an area so you can be sure to get xp and loot from them if other people are fighting in the same area. It’s especially good to use at whitespring or during uranium fever event for that reason.
---
Got some good memories with one of those, it was my very first legendary. Got me from level 15 to 30
---
heheheh, if this happens to you, dont panic, just fast travel!
---
I’ve seen 3 and I’m only level 30
---
Like others I really just used as a mobile stash. One foundation with a bed and stash.
---
If you launch nuke to blast zone whitespring then youre entitled to farm it for legendarys. Then there are players that show up to blast zone to farm glowers but dont collect the loot from dead glowers. They dont understand how to farm for legendarys.
---
And I'm assuming you've tried changing servers several times by now?
---
*checks for Bethesda reply bot.. COME ON!
---
AFAIK, it doesn't. You complete a silo and it expects you to input the code.  Nowhere in the game will you actually discover what the code is.
---
r/market76 
---
Haha aww. Yeah I avoid bags unless they have weapons in them. Then I know it's on purpose 
---
Is that a joke? I don't get it.
---
It has been. From what I saw Harper’s Ferry fron the air looks just like the game trying to see if we can swing through tomorrow on our way back home.
---
Also, if you're playing on consoles, you get to experience the joy of having the charging barrel (the one thing that really ramps up the damage) have a chance to crash your game every few seconds after the first time you shoot it, and this will last until your game crashes, even if you unequip it.
---
IMHO it was a slow transition so it's hard to pinpoint and exact time it changed. Every year rating systems get more and more rare in favor of like/dislike systems. That's all many people can wrap their heads around anyway. Users just vote 0 or 10 based on what they've heard about a game, rather than playing it themselves and forming a reasonable unique opinion.
---
I think you're dead wrong about Bethesda not caring for player requests. The roadmap they just laid out is like 95% major player requests...
---
That aside, I completely back your original request. I have a suspicion that more budget is coming, but that Bethesda didn't announce it in the roadmap because that's all free content, and budget increases could be cash shop purchases (which I would be OK with if the price is right).
---
Anyway, I guess we'll see. If it's going to happen at any time in the near future, it will likely coincide with the release of the 'place items from stash' feature.
---
I did the same thing once, just followed him around while he talks to chally, it was great. 
---
I love how games such as FO76 can inspire players to create and even add to the lore of the original game. This is the community spirit the devs were hoping for.
---
Who kins, perhaps a crime faction will flourish to bring balance to the PD presence. 
---
Good effort folks! Bravo. 👏 
---
Sadly not a bug :( the weapon itself weighs less- the weight reduction affix doesn't apply to mods added to the rifle.
---
What does the printer do and what is this solution paper that people end up with?
---
Why are some guides saying you get a solution from Mama Dolces? 
---
Lots of conflicting information and most of it is drowned out by people who took short cuts and / or solved it on their own 
---
I can shit out more bullets with max rank Ammosmith and max rank Super Duper in five minutes, of every kind of ammo, than the ammo factory can make in one hour.  
---
The only downside is resources, but the resources you use to make are fairly common (you practically drown in steel, and if you somehow dont have enough gunpowder you can turn cloth into it. lead might be a slight issue at times I guess?)
---
Reminded me of a nicer version of Strong from FO4. 
---
You can hit things without having an actual line-of-sight to them by rebounding the shot off a wall.  It also seldom, if ever, misses when you do this.
---
How much would something like that sell for? That's my dream Rifle
---
Xbox.
---
I always feel like, somebody's watching me, and I got no privacy! Oh-oh-oh! https://youtu.be/7YvAYIJSSZY
---
this. and id like to add, base destroying also.
---
for me, anyone that seems to kill or destroy people or things solely because they can and especially if they aren't even benefitting are griefing. 
---
I've not idea tbh. Someone on a fb group offered me 10k caps :/
---
Anyone attempted to drop a Nuke on the sons of Dane complete while one violent night is going on?
---
My favorite area in the game!
---
Too true, man. Too true. Had the issue with Astroneer. I played it since it came out in beta. My buddy said it looked like garbage, and all his friends hated it. But now I started playing it again, and he actually say and watched me play. Immediately bought it. Hah. Funny how that works eh. 
---
That's not enough caps. I would drop 25k on that in a heartbeat
---
This is with one of each rifleman perk equipped. I can definitely get it to stupid damage with the right stuff
---
I forgot you could craft it. Now I sure feel dumb. 
---
"Did I forget a type of meat, moo moo?"
---
Charleston capital building..clipboards galore
---
 Defiantly get the perk cards Fortune Finder - (Perception) and Cap Collector - (Luck). You will find all kinds of stashes that you'd never see...I almost made 400 caps at the Eastern Regional Penitentiary off stash boxes that I 100% missed the first time I went there. 
---
At level 8, no need. Use all of the resources around flatwoods. There is a sleeping bag at the very top of the church, I never caught a disease. All of the benches are nearby and you can access stash at red rocket or overseer camp.
---
Early on, if you build a camp, make it truly mobile, if you need a bench or fire, as you explore an area of the map. Don't worry about a permanent camp. 
---
I built a nice spot at top (the very top)  of Seneca rock around level 12 but spent all of my time traveling back to the forest area. To much game time traveling.
---
If the title isnt true to the content thenbwhy are you clickbaiting
---
Yes and I have repeatedly had this glitch so I have quit until I have found a solution 
---
A griefer is equivalent to a troll-- willfully going after people, generally in a PVP context, with the intent to cause a negative emotional response.
---
I first saw the term originate playing vanilla WoW over a decade ago. It was used interchangeably with 'campers' to designate people who kill someone in a PVP context and then 'camp' their body until they respawn, just so they can either kill them repeatedly or force them to log out. Neither of which would give you any tangible reward... only the knowledge that you shat on someone's day, hence why they were effectively trolls. It also frequently came with /spitting on people after you killed them repeatedly. Fun things like that. :/
---
I'm pretty sure the definition (though these types of online words are always flexible) started to shift when non-PVPers picked up on it as a way to express their feelings about being attacked by PVPers in games they didn't actually want to PVP in. In that sense their response to the attacker is much the same as the response of someone being camped in WoW... screw off, I don't want to PVP with you, just let me play... but that doesn't mean the PVPer is attacking just to upset you. There has to be some substantial reason why a person thinks the PVPer is trying to get a negative emotional response.
---
Haha that's a way to do it,  utilizing all available aspects  and "gaming the game" so to say. My group,  we just charge in,  blind fury.  
---
Many different ways to skin an octopus. 
---
I’m with you, OP. Workshops (building, resource collection) and PVP just don’t go together.
---
All the people who have challenged my workshop since the patch don’t bother to build or repair a thing - it’s purely sport. (Or not, considering most people contesting my workshops are 200+ levels above me). 
---
A previously enjoyable part of the game has been destroyed. 
---
I"ve nuked the waterpark. NADA. Ditto amusement park. Nothing there. 
---
Dental hygiene doesn't stop being important just because there's no more dentists to remind you about it! 
---
Is that a legendary variant?  I have a Dragon, but it's vanilla.
---
Oh I havent sold it, I figured if he was so quick to offer 10k it's worth more than that.
---
Are you doing the back to basic quest as part of the enclave story line?
---
I do that. It works. It would be nice to have more protection tbough. I have the plans for T-51 calibrated shocks, just need violet flux to make. 
---
We want bananas in game
---
No? I didn't realise they were in the game it's for the Box.
---
I can understand wanting companions but with how dialogue works in this game they would repeat the same lines over and over with no input from the player
---
Do you turn Mike on often?
---
What does it say exactly in the top corner of your monitor when you mark that quest as active?
---
We honestly just need more people with enemies...
---
I mean Whitesprings is so popular because you have a small area with 2 or 3 floors filled with enemies that basically respawn the moment a new player enters.
---
There arent many places where there are even 5 or 6 enemies total, while at whitesprings you have around 20 just in the club house.
---
In general there are way too little enemies in the world to actually feel threatening.
---
It was honestly one of the most disappointing things when playing for the first time, how empty the world feels, not because of the missing npcs or low player count even though that really didnt help it either, but 90% of enemies are just set at their mostly interior areas where they spawn and then you have like 5 enemies and thats it.
---
Survival should also have a combat component which seems highly lacking, especially for high level areas :(
---
I know it's anecdotal but a while back before the TSE nerf I saw a level 230+ while out and about and they fired one shot at the ground next to me and it took half my health. There was nothing explodey near me, the shot didn't hit me directly, and pacifist was on. Not sure what happened there but I figured shenanigans were afoot.
---
I love Last Laugh enough already with my Molotov cocktail build. This would be amazing. Even if it just put a surprise Molotov "in their pocket" to go off I'd be happy. Lots of times if I'm in a nuke zone I just loot everything I see and don't actually care about the junk at all so I dont mind losing it.
---
If it gave me the opportunity to run around dropping fireballs everywhere I went, I would absolutely try to take on the acorchbeast queen with just a full set of leaded and lined life saving armors and underarmor I am 100% on board. 
---
If anything like this happens, I'll be the guy that keeps exploding and setting everything on fire while yelling "ITS JUST A PRANK BRO"
---
I didn't know this until two days ago when I find a good miner claw and I went to try and put it on.  Good thing i hadn't scrapped my sword yet....
---
Yeah I was watching YouTube footage of Far Harbor recently..and with all of the NPCs it goes to show how lonely 76 is
---
&gt; With a Gamma gun, in case the mechanics work differently with that weapon.
---
​You're going to end up having to make a whole post about the Gamma gun, none of my Gunslinger pistol perks work for it and neither does Demolition Expert according to the pipboy. Maybe make it automatic and try Guerrilla or see if the Pipboy is lying but it didn't seem to be.
---
To return to mr gutsy
---
It's really the only good energy weapon available.  I don't count the gauss rifle only because it's more a ballistic weapon than anything else, and it doesn't deal energy damage.
---
In terms of max-damage per ammo, it's the most efficient fusion cell weapon you can use, it does pretty high damage when just a default semi-automatic, and it's only like 17 or so damage below a lever-action rifle, which needs constant reloading, and fires somewhat slow.
---
Also, maybe mine is bugged, but I've fired well over 600 rounds, and the thing hasn't broken yet at all, in fact, it hasn't even broken through its extra durability bonus from crafting a new one.  Every other energy weapons breaks down fast, and this thing is still holding together pretty well.
---
I'd say you're wrong about levels above 50 being pointless. Every level allows you to optimize, and it's safe to say that the majority of players in this game are not min/maxing to level up. So for example I'm level 60, and am noticeably more powerful in PVE than I was at 50 because I started to swap stats for better combat-oriented perks, being comfortable with less QOL at that point. Similarly, someone could go from a total PVE experience to farm levels between 1-50 to optimizing their spec completely for PVP at 50 (which could take another 30 or 40 levels for all the right stat switches and perks).
---
In a kind of meta theory bubble, what you said is correct, but in the reality of so many different players experimenting as they level, it's quite wrong. xD  And because of that a level 100 could absolutely have a big advantage over a level 50... and that's not even talking about the odds of a level 100 having way better gear (including more pieces of Assassin).
---
Perhaps they intentionally removed certain plans so they are no longer craftable forcing players to buy, sell or trade mods. Now with that in mind I have been finding a lot of weapon and armor mods spawning around the world lately. Perhaps it's just me. 
---
They said they are "retiring" some things from the shop this month, so maybe we'll be seeing more new items in their place.
---
Happy Cake Day siftingflour! Wherever life plants you, bloom with grace.
---
And the floating quest marker takes you back inside and upstairs to him?
---
good boot
---
I miss the branching dialog, and Nick Valentine in particular 
---
Yeah, I don't care for PvP either so now I never claim workshops anymore since everyone just uses them for an excuse to initiate PvP.  Seriously, if somebody wanted the factory that bad, all they'd have to do is hop servers and find an empty one.  
---
good bot
---
This was exactly the solution I was looking for, thank you!
---
I mean, its west Virginia. I'm not really sure that's realistic 
---
People aren't getting banned for modding. They got banned from using 3rd party apps ie Cheat Engine and some using shaders (re-shade) as it's a .dll injection which changes the code and causes the flag. 
---
Repeating false information is even more circle jerky.
---
Awwww look a future hoarder welcome to the Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Club otherwise known as Fallout 76.
---
Seriously though you'll eventually learn what's worth keeping selling etc. Early in game pick up wood from the ground frequently. It's an easy resource for builing a camp. Screws, springs, black titanium and lead are valuable resources. 
---
Always scrap junk at benches there is a scrap all option it drastically lowers the weight. 
---
The west side of the map has lower level enemies. If you explore start there. If you check the map and see an event. You can click on it to fast travel to it for caps. This is very helpful to unlock fast travel points on the map.
---
Weapons and armor are leveled. Power armor starts at level 15 however if you take the pieces off the frame you can wear the frame and it provides excellent early Damage resistance. FYI you need fusion cores to power it.
---
You will not learn plans and recipes unless you read them found in the notes section of the pip boy. (I was level 20 before I found this out)
---
Hopefully these tips help!! Have fun in the wasteland
---
Ok, I see. But that must be a lot of heavy mods...my sniper rifle doesn’t weigh that much!
---
Most of the enemies at wavy Willard’s are scorched, but there are a decent amount of ghouls too so it might be worth a shot 
---
I wouldn't want to have to turn off pacifist mode to claim workshops and then turn it on again. Is the suggestion to give people more ability to defend themselves? I'm just speaking for myself alone but I don't want to PvP and toggle pacifist on and off and on and off,etc. I'm there for similar reasons (plans) and if I get successfully jumped and killed it's not a big deal as I don't carry junk around while claiming unclaimed workshops for plans and I'd prefer the experience to be of as little entertainment value to the attacker as possible.
---
Why cant a *Power* Fist attach to *Power* Armor has been my biggest gripe
---
Just looking to buy any level 50 3 stars on PC
---
Now That sounds fun :D May I ask what your perk cards look like for this?
---
Try talking to him without your fatigues on and then put them on and talk to him again. See if that does anything
---
Why are death bags even visible/accessible to other players? Death bags should not be public.
---
I once dropped all the ammo and legendary weapons I don't use in a random CAMP. The owner wasn't home, but I like to think they enjoyed the gift. 
---
I also recently dropped all my chems, useless ammo and weapons at the Overseer's CAMP, along with two PA frames. I realize now that no level 2 character will have need for any of that. But. It's good to collect for later?
---
... I needed to clear some stash space so I could horde more junk I'm sorry, me giving stuff away wasn't out of kindness, it was just spring cleaning
---
Ok I shall go on and try that right now.
---
Honestly, there are 2 schools of thought on this controversial topic.
---
1) DO THE PLOT QUEST CHAINS.
---
Free States (The Mire) -&gt; Brotherhood of Steel (The Mire -&gt; Cranberry Bog)  -&gt; Enclave (Cranberry Bog / Whitesprings Bunker) are DESIGNED to take you to level 50+. [Spoilers avoided]
---
2) Don't give a rat's ass about plot, and just find a good group to grind Whitespring Golf Club. Level 62 / 42 non-glowing Ghouls are ~100XP each. And Legendary drops are common.
---
are legendary enemies from nukes only ghouls?
---
I’ve always though Power Armor in general looked silly with a tiny gun in your hands, most the weapons actually. Aside from the gatlings and such. I mean, they could’ve really ran with the Power Armor idea with some bad ass weaponry. Arm cannons, shoulder launchers, eye lasers, rail guns. Bethesda needs to get some anime level weapons going. These suits are a marvel of technology, so where’s the crazy weapon attachments ?
---
Indubitably.
---
I was thinking about using the flare gun at whitesprings next time there was a nuke zone.  That way if I located a group of ghouls, I could signal people so everyone could get a piece.  So many times I'd shoot a goul and get swarmed by the whole group and be finishing off the last one when other players started running up.
---
1) Sell extra flux that you can't make into stable flux. (i.e. you ran out of masses and fluids). Nuked Whitesprings is good for this.  And before they turn into inert flux.
---
2) Create industrial water purifiers at your CAMP.
---
No, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a legendary scorched. 
---
I had a player claim one of my workshops the other day, didn't think much of it since that's the risk of taking ownership of one. I wasn't overly interested in reclaiming it so I moved on and took another workshop. Again it was contested by the same player, at which point I thought huh. Again I didn't contest it but took on a third workshop and predictably that same player appeared whilst I was defending it and took me out with one shot after I'd cleared the area of enemies. And that's when it clicked, this particular player was using the workshops as a means of legitimately initiating PvP so as to avoid becoming wanted, but clearly that player was spoiling for a fight. 
---
Whilst I don't consider this as an example of griefing, it is nonetheless irritating. That said I learned two important lessons; 1) always place a stash box at the workshop, that you way if you are killed by a player trying to contest it, they get sweet FA but a handful of caps and 2) don't bother wasting resources or budget placing turrets because they're almost entirely useless! 
---
Are you sure its not the pip boy bug where it doesn't show but you still get the affects? Also I read strange in numbers causes problems with it. 
---
... Andddddd randomly it just started working....
---
Hahaha
---
That's still not griefing. It's a dick move, but mechanically encouraged and is to a degree the point of a PVP server. Following them had they switched servers would be griefing.
---
Not getting to do what you want, when you want on a PVP server isn't griefing.
---
At first it was but then it took of all my damage buffs that it should be doing my damage went from 947 to 597
---
I love bone chimes and my last build had a bone chime curtain as the "door" to my partially enclosed outside spawn spa bathroom.
---
I have been known to portopotty team mates builds or build tons of Christmas trees (back when you could...)
---
I try to dump ammo I don't use when I come across a camp.
---
Gather your own NPCs with blackjack and slooty women/men. Recruit players to fill a permanent squad. 
---
Do something like Ocean’s eleven but in fallout. 
---
Good point possibly. I honestly don't know what sentinel, or vanguard do. Because it's armor, and therefore useless to me. I don't think there should be an advantage to power armor, I just feel like not using power armor, is an advantage to using it.
---
The people that one shot kill me with death tambos are not in power armor, and I doubt they could even do that in power armor, because all the op weapons like the deathclaw gauntlet, tambo, and stuff can't even be used in power armor.
---
Power armor has too many disadvantages. 😕
---
It's not a gold mine but at lower levels, I used to clear out Hornwright Industrial and Charleston Herald and get quite a few screws.  The n would go clear out Summersville and then go to Summersville as both were a gold mine for springs but also had screws as well.  I just repeated those 4 a few times and got all my weapons, armor and excavator armor leveled up 
---
I saw that damn magnifying glass icon on some stuff, I didnt know what it was!  Thanks!  I feel like I need a hour or two long tutorial on this game, lol.
---
A suppressed, level 50, perfect storm, with receiver/stock mods, maxed commando x 3 and bloody mess would be a kick ass sneak/VATS weapon.
---
Here's some good early-game advice: Make a point of laying claim to as many workshops as possible. All the time. There's a number of reasons for this: 
---
The mere act of claiming a workshop will give you some plans and some treasures. Useful healing items, armour, stuff like that. 
---
Once you own a workshop, you can always fast-travel to it for free from any location. They become like teleportation nodes, allowing you to save a fortune in terms of fast travel costs. 
---
They'll frequently come under attack. You fast-travel to them, complete the defense and you'll get MORE rewards: More plans, more healing items, more everything. They're like a fountain of infinite resources as long as you put in the time to defend them. If you own four or five at once, there will basically always be one that's under attack, so you'll have this never-ending flow of loot. In the early game, it's a great way to get a solid footing in terms of plans and healing items. Later on, it's obviously less-necessary and worthwhile. 
---
Also, while you own a workshop, they become great places to farm food and water. The most important use of which in the early game is this: Grow mutfruits, corn, tatos and purified water, and you can use any cooking station to make them into vegetable starch, which can be used as adhesive. Adhesive is ALWAYS important, since any repairs, crafting or upgrades to your equipment requires it, so it's to your benefit to have a huge, huge stash of the stuff. 
---
I'd recommend in particular [workshops 3 and 4 on this map](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2018/11/fallout-76-workshop-locations.jpg). #4 has a spot where you can set up a fertilizer extractor which can be used to generate infinite free fertilizer, which will enable all that food farming. Planting crops at #3 produces some of the richest, fastest yields of food in the game; the place has a very high "food" rating, which means that the crops will come in like every five minutes or so. It's great. 
---
I'd also suggest getting the "green thumb" perk which doubles the amount of plant and fungus stuff you can harvest, and the "butcher's bounty" perk, which will often double the amount of meat from any dead animal. You can buy both at the beginning of the game, and they are never not useful: My character is level 191 and I still keep them equipped almost all of the time. 
---
Thanks.
---
Laughed so hard I farted. 
---
Because u equipped a hat or helmet that u have two of..put one in your stash or both.problem solved 
---
Can we get the game in a bug free state before we start asking them to add more crap?
---
Hhoollldd up. I thought that the Tesla wouldn't be that great BUT points wise it does as much damage as a lever action rifle and so I used it for a couple of battles. I like to use the vats From far away and I can get pretty good hits in an a pretty good rate of fire. I can burn thru a clip of idk 12 shots? I think that's how many are in there?  I read in this thread some dude said its aoe was non existent, that's not true. You can see the arc connect to another enemy off screen. 
---
Okay now let me paint a picture of my usual experience with my Tesla rifle ; I approach an area that will have many enemies. I find a single enemy standing by themselves. I enter vats an unload as many shots I need to kill that enemy while noting that the arc is reaching of screen to another enemy and THAT enemy is getting 2x sneak damage as well. Let's say that the enemy has found me and are now bum rushing me; with the alright fire rate and its (nearly as good as a lever action) damage, I unload into the group. Even when I miss and hit the ground, it hits an enemy. 
---
Its versatile and viable. I can be a silent vats assassin an I can also panic button into a group rushing me. With my new experience with this weapon, I've been petty hyped that I can now set down my lever if I have to in battle an pull out a weapon that uses a pretty common ammo type. I was surprised by its handiness. I'll be looking for any mods and any legendary versions of this weapon.
---
It is pretty loud... So.. There's that. 
---
Thanks 😂 
---
I have one with the charged lobbing barrel I can carpet an area with orbs. Mostly good for softing up the mobs for other sources of dmg. 
---
welcome 
---
I have no clue how im going to be able to decorate my base with stash items when im already at budget limit. I want to be able to put Nuka/Beverage Bottles, Teddy Bears, Telephone, Bobbleheads, Magazines, Vases/Plates, etc all on display to give my camp more "life" but at the moment I dont see that possible unless we get a 25-50% budget increase. 
---
I Have no turrets. Im still wanting more signs/lights. My Garden eats about 25% of budget so I guess that will have to be removed :(
---
Yep thanks for all your tips!  I have a little camp, little one room shack...got a campfire, now just need somewheres I can scrap.
---
Thanks wrt: West, I'm at flatwoods now and just got a quest for some place, havent looked at map yet.
---
I have a bunch of fusion cores I got somehow, I saved 'em, figured they'll be useful at some point.
---
Yep been learning all recipes I can...Thanks again!
---
No problem
---
No Problem
---
Need at least 9k
---
I’d love to see legendary effects that affect travel or the power armour directly and not you the player.
---
Its crazy hat i haven’t seen it till now
---
Fawkes from FO3

Form a Whitespring Farming Coop. Friend each other. Take turns relogging on the same server to respawn the Ghouls.
---
The whole quest seems to be broken as I am no longer able to complete the agility test as when I press the button after the mud trench with a roof it doesn't count and won't let me progress
---
Tremendous work, nicely done! I think once you complete your retaliatory damage tests we'll finally be able to put this "killed through slap damage" nonsense to rest.
---
Not sure what you mean by this. Crafting is more efficient for all types of ammo.
---
Nukes don't affect Scorched from what I've read, and they make up the bulk of enemies in the interior cells in Morgantown.
---
ill take them if you still have them in 45 minutes 
---
That’s why the ft is so important 
---
Sorry, I shouldn't have said cities. Just towns with interior areas. You don't think a place like Harper's Ferry would have any buildings to go into?
---
Not maxed out even? Just one of each card? 
---
And we shall name this rifle "The Saucy Minx".
---
Let it be known.
---
Must be an auto-pistol, not the SMG.
---
My gt: Miz Ragnarok 
---
Just shoot me a game invite!
---
Not bad though. Mine's just perfect for going through Whitesprings. 
---
Hey are you on now and still in need of fusion cores?
---
If it's funny, it's not griefing. Griefing is when people ragequit, not when they post big ol' victory boasts on Reddit.
---
that sounds like it might work, ill try it out, thanks.
---
Right! Ad Victoriam, brother! 
---
[When I had the same problem around the same level I watched this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E-4rfeajBM)
---
the point I was trying to make is you have to get double the resources to craft same amount of two ammo types Like I said If I craft Shotgun Shells and 556 thats more lead I need which means more farming vs take Ammo factory grind lead other crafting components make shotgun shells than go to ammo factory that has been making other bullet types besides what im crafting for those saving time because the ammo factory passively generates ammo so I can run and do my dailies and everything else and I don't need to spend even more time than I already do getting even more resources    
---
I rarely find actual clipboards.  Always battered which don’t have screws. 
---
Vanguard for example gives you up to +35/35 dr per piece, the higher your HP is. Sentinel gives you -15% dmg per piece while standing still and not moving. Imagine that on a PA. Legendary mods on PA would need to be tailored to PA so it wouldn’t overpower them. Like faster movement or something. 
---
Regarding your one-shot point. You’re right to a certain amount. When I’m in PVP and see my opponent is wearing PA, I’m pretty sure I’ll kill them 9/10 times without a problem. (Rifle build, no melee) That being said, I also get one-shot by melee builds from time to time, despite being in full sentinel assassins armor (-8% dmg from players per piece, -15% dmg while not moving per piece), so you won’t be save from that even with the best non-PA-armor.
---
At the end, they’d have to balance it so no side has an advantage over the other. 
---
FTFY. Adrenal Reaction. Adrenaline is a perk. 
---
And we need to open up Vault 76 and let that be a social lobby. 
---
I have no clue why but it seems to have worked, thanks!
---
Yeah totes.
---
What does a good one hit at. My Heavy Combat ignores fire and explosives. ;)
---
Battereds have screws regular have springs and screws..I'm not sure which ones are at the building but they def have screws
---
every time im near the giant bridge i can't help but do the superhero landing lmao
---
i remember once i landed and there near flatwoods tavern nd some dudes saying WTF THIS GIRL JUMPED WITH A FKING SWIMWEAR OMG 
---
??
---
I’m lvl 218 and it’s equally frustrating for us when noobs come in and spawn low lvl enemies that do absolutely nothing for us except waste our ammo. Or they’ll set up their little turrets behind white spring golf club and make everything run outback. Their needs to be more places like west tek that are too difficult for anyone but end gamers
---
At least mothman fights ..the monster just vanishes
---
The mutation is called Adrenal Reaction. Not sure where people have been getting “Adrenaline Reaction” from. 
---
please! with more budget too!!!
---
I'm sure he's just waiting for you to wake up, so sleep well, see you in the morning.
---
Oh right ok then ...
---
I assure you that this was definitely not staged. And I figured people would think that do to how perfect the reaction was. I do not know this guy and have not talk to him cents. I haven sent him the video on PSN but he did not reply.
---
Luckily, if needed, I have the 15 minutes leading up to this point from when I pressed the share button on my PlayStation. It definitely proves that I did not have fire association with this guy.
---
Also, you’ll notice that I don’t have any videos on my YouTube page. I specifically uploaded this video for the purpose of sharing it with the world. I’m not a typical YouTuber.
---
Good to know, thks.
---
Watoga isn't bad for legendaries but that's even higher level than whitesprings.  Yeah, I wish legendary enemies we're a bit more spread out, especially lower level legendary enemies for low level players.
---
Top notch trolling. I hope it all works out.
---
This may or may not be true but.. I feel like Modders are extremely passonite when they spend their own time without pay to create something, they do it extremely well. Bethesda on otherhand, I feel like they have no passion towards this game. The atomshop items so far have majority been just retextured laziness cashgrab. They just dont have the creative passion likes modders do.
---
My other guess is they're throwing out these extremely easy/lazy to make designs early on to drain us of our 6000-9000 atoms we get from non-repeatable challenges. Then come later in Summer or Fall they start releasing some high quality work forcing us to buy atoms if you haven't saving them.
---
 If you overwhelm the Flatwoods Monster he dies, just like the Mothman.
---
How about they *fix* the game instead of just changing one bug into another?
---
He always leaves
---
I've got 2 comments on here but can't see them! Could whoever sent them kindly DM me :) Thanks!
---
So it only does damage to domesticated birds?
---
Something like that would be cool as hell and a welcomed addition. I’d be leaving little presents all over the place 
---
People are really trying to get sophisticated in this pvp stuff huh 
---
Yeah, there's mirelurk Kings in there that are pretty tough even at level 50.
---
As soon as everyone reports all the bugs they encounter, yeah it might happen. So just report any bugs you come across
---
I just got yet another Jet Pack and still no 2nd Calibrated Shocks
---
I thought that’s what he said! What does that even mean? Lol
---
I like it when your around people sensible enough to let everyone hit the legendary once, taking turns so everyone gets the drop. 
---
I can actually see you or your friend in the silo we are currently in...??
---
Yep, slugs would be great.
---
WV Lumber, Grafton, Grafton Dam, the penitentiary and Grafton steel
---
 Screenshot coming right up. ;)
---
All I want is a slightly increased spawn rate for the Flatwoods Monster. I've been playing since the beta and have only seen him once
---
This is great work, thank you.
---
But...
---
In the interest of scientific, “no more confusion and false claims” intentions, this is far too late to justify labeling previous claims as wrong, false, lying, or whatever motivational intent people want to project onto them. You would have to dig through every previous patch in painstaking detail to determine what Bethesda has changed, and find out if previous iterations of the game made exceeding slap damage possible.
---
TL;DR - My husband and I know what we went through. All the proof in the world that it’s not possible now doesn’t change what we experienced in the past.
---
Your mutation is working if you check your damage. After reacquiring it and logging out and back in, the positive text will disappear but your weapon damage will be correct. I have tested several times in several characters and it definitely works. It is frustrating though, I know.
---
if you read what u wrote ..it doesn't really make any sense
---
Not sure myself, I can only guess being made a fool of. PMSL
---
If you open your map and hit L1 on ps4, LT on xbox, idk on pc it should open the menu where you can exit, check challenges, see the atomic store, that kinda stuff. Right near the bottom, above there exit option there is #Help, this menu selection has a ton of great info on many of the aspects of the game, hope you can find some info in there to help you out.
---
Check out r/fo76filthycasuals too for a less salty more discussion based fo76 sub.
---
I always leave stuff like that in cash registers or suitcases by the vendors, as well as ammo/junk/known recipes I don't intentionally collect and end up with anyway.  It's a fairly common thing, and reflects well on the player base.
---
k
---
I wish you were on PC.  😖
---
Sarcasm is a thing you know... nevermind.
---
I get what sarcasm is..but it was worded terribly 
---
I don't think they're being soft, as far as I've heard, Anthem is underperforming quite a bit, and a lot of people were really not expecting anything good from Bioware because there has been a noticeable decline whether or not you like some of their last games.
---
I guess the thing is people don't really have many high hopes for anything published by EA, they have a long-standing stigma and I guess mediocrity, and building games to suck money from your wallet is expected by now.  Bioware releasing another lackluster game after the whole Andromeda debacle was probably expected to a point where people don't even seem to care anymore and probably wanted the game to underperform.
---
Bethesda on the other hand (contrary to whatever some people loudly cry on the internet), have been releasing some pretty successful games for the last few years.  Fallout 3 and 4 were successful games, and no loud minority can change those facts.  76 on the other hand was the first time in a while one of their modern projects was not well-received for more than a few reasons.
---
It's easier to jump and hang onto with ire than Anthem, which probably didn't have high expectations to begin with.
---
If you get the perk card (forgot the name)where you can press y at first aid boxes to get a chance to find more chems, you really start collecting a lot of extra chems.  Morgantown airport seems to have a lot of first aid boxes, that's where I used to go load up.
---
 Do you see his dead ass on the ground?
---
It worked
---
The forum narrative has turned into “everybody is a liar”. Good luck getting people to believe you.
---
I’m glad these things have been getting fixed. I’m annoyed that people are rushing to think that all previous claims were false.
---
Was there no cost?  I asked my friend and he said it was "less" than a new build to repair but still was out like various junk
---
Haven’t used one in forever so I might be wrong, but I thought it was literally a carbon copy of the pistol but with pants range? 
---
Either way they should make it more powerful but with a wide hip spread. Similar to the blunderbuss in some cod games
---
So I recently re-built the room. Now, the “victim” is responsible for their own life.
---
I installed 4 switches.
---
One will open the door if chosen first.
---
The other three activate the trap.
---
Fallout: SAW edition 
---
WOW!!! A suggestion on this subreddit that I 100% agree with!!!!!!
---
That would be an amazing thing to add. Hopefully something that would really stand out so people would recognize it instantly.
---
 The difference with the FM is that I always ambush him. I hear him first and then stalk his ass. The Mothman always jumps me. ;) 
---
But its an awesome idea. I now moved my prison camp behind the golf course and put 6 turrets there to attract griefers ;)
---
I'll leave an egg and a bottle of wine.
---
I just finished the deathclaw part and nothing else is popping up for me to do. It's getting pretty aggravating.
---
Ahhh gotcha
---
I haven't seen a legendary at whitesprings in about a week. I don't know if it's just me or what but I stopped farming it for them after the last patch because I was lucky to see one legendary there after sweeping the whole place. Same with Watoga and Harpers Ferry. I have better luck with legendaries just wandering the roads and deep in the woods on the map edges now.

Hi! On Xbox Clubs, please join us in The RGG Group. We're a small but growing collection of various leveled players. Some chatty, some quiet, all generally nice and helpful. Profanity optional 😁

---
From this very sub. But okay.
---
What did you expect after radiation therapy? 🤪
---
😂 
---
Yeah... and maybe read the post. But okay
---
&gt;Edit: please ignore my original post text. It was childish and stupid. Those of you who watched the video will know we're not 100% sure what's causing the bans. It could be cheat engine being on your computer (even if you're not using it in game), but keep in mind one of the people who got banned didn't even have cheat engine installed. It could be ReShade (some multiplayer games that deal heavily in PVP combat make ReShade a bananable offense), or it could be specific mods from the Nexus like the lock picking cheat. We just don't know yet.
---
Again, sorry for the original post and title. I literally just wanted to share this video with people. Didn't expect to get so many up votes. 
---
my fear is the npcs start picking up on this trick , like a wounded mister handy asks for a quick repair and while we are reading a full text log his assualtron buddies spam their death beams from their hiding spots "Ctrl alt defeat ....noob! " 
---
Do you mean "paltry 96 damage"? Or does it shoot chickens?
---
You should post your platform and timezone so people know. Good luck
---
Let's refer to them as either a base or turret farm.
---
I don't even put walls up on my base, just benches, stash box, bed, cooking station crammed on 2-3 foundations.
---
I am trying to learn if it would be beneficial to drop my camp with a single foundation with 4 turrets to assist me when I am attempting to clear an area with higher level mobs solo. For example, if I run into trouble, I have an area to retreat towards.
---
I’m not a native speaker. Sorry that English is not everbody’s mother tongue.
---
There is quite few alternative answers....a cheat that allows others to bypass slap damage (totally unconfirmed but possible), lack of knowledge of pvp mechanics from the target (most likely answer).  I've also seen quite a few people with pacifist OFF and quite unaware that it was off.
---
Yeah. I was just there the other day. The number of them there creates a bit of a challenge. Kind of a nice change of pace considering most things I do are the easy things.
---
Bruh it's cool..I don't care..I'm just saying I couldn't tell if you were serious or joking
---
Yes. Plus I was probably hovering around 50% health so adrenal reaction was probably helping
---
They do effect scorched because they only drop ionized meat, glowing mass, hardened mass, and high radiation fluids when they're in nuke zones.
---
When Bethesda adds weapon naming I'll repost haha
---
I nuked the water park, and it *sucked*
---
I got a rolling pin with the same effects but it was a suppresor's instead of vampire's, so it reduced damage output by 20% for 3 seconds.
---
Rifle has a bayonet but you can’t get it from scrapping. 
---
I’ve noticed a good number of new players on the servers. Price drop has definitely provided a larger player base. 
---
We'll just have to wait, see and hope I suppose
---
 I was looking at a page of Combat Armor, all heavy by the numbers, with several Legendarys I wanted and while I was deciding ... my kitten steps on one of the special kitten keys, and drops me from the screen. I load it back up and its a new load, all generic. I tell my kitten he is bad, but he just looks at me.
---
Jgourley
---
Yesss, i just sneak up on him and it always works. Never just run full ahead in sight he'll just vanish usually same with Mothman sometimes.
---
i sent you a game invite, if like the grenades alone, i don’t have a good missile launcher 
---
I don't have a second account to hold them, so no. But it's not hard to fill up on crappy legendaries though...
---
