When you eject the "empty" core and reload with the one with 20% left charge, does it show 130 shots (650/5)?

I've played this game for over 400 hours so far, and I'm level 141 ... and not once have I ever been hard up for screws.  In fact, screws are one of the most vendor'ed items I sell from my stash every 3-4 days.  What are you missing in this game to be so aggravated about screws?
---
Level 80, 200 hours in, I'm overflowing in screws.  Screws everywhere.  But I'm constantly out of steel.  That's ok though, because scavenging is the purpose of this game.  You remove the need to scavenge and you're killing an essential part of the gameplay loop.  Feel like a broken record having to make this comment.
---
The AA is great, don’t get me wrong.
---

---
The fire rate does nothing on single-shot between reload weapons. 
---
I was the only one on my server last night. Made ammo, fusion cores, steel. It was glorious lol almost launched a nuke myself just for a the hell of it.
---
I cannot fault your logic. 
---
I consider myself neither a troll nor an idiot. I’m just kinda tired of hearing such absurd complaints. Wanting more varied atomic store content is one thing, but complaining that Fallout 76 doesn’t have content from other games?  Gimme a break. 
---
And if you’re pretty sure Bethesda wants your input on a game, you may as well contact them directly instead of hoping they come across your reddit post ;)
---
that works. I had to figure out at some point though that I had a huge chunk of excess weight from picking up cigs. I skip them now but still have plenty of plastic around.
---
Now if we could only get ghoul mob summoning working properly.. 
---
I agree that they need persistent servers. When the premise of the game is rebuild America, then what we should do C.A.M.P wise should stay. 
---
Btw Because I feel I have hijacked this thread and have gotten off base of what the post is about, I am going to move this discussion to a separate post. 
---
100% agree. Double at night regular during the day makes sense. Negative with no way to lessen it (like class freak to mutations) is stupid and makes the whole nocturnal effect essentially useless.
---
Alternatively if they had something like a drug or something that you could take to make your character act like it’s night for a period of time would make it a little more interesting/appealing.
---
Only playing at night .... aint nobody got time for that.
---
Wrote up a response to these types of posts, if anyone wants to check it out ..

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ay5xus/just_my_thoughts_of_the_wasteland_of_this_game/
---
It happened. LadyDevan and Jurassica played for a while. 
---
Sorry meant that IF BSG would allow me to scrap * legendaries for 4 screws I'd get banned for having too many screws. Bad joke... 
---
I just drop into bag on floor. I then shoot it and wave to get their attention. 
---
You literally just summed up my FO76 experience. I bought it November. Binged it. Made level like 68. I haven't even explored the entire map I feel like I've seen it all already. I haven't touched that game since like early January. I'm a huge fallout fan. Honestly the whole state of the game rn makes me genuinely sad. Like you said "its very hard to enjoy" like it almost feels forced at times 
---
I go to the three screw farms every time I log in. Most of the time, I get lucky.
---
Well, l have to go check it out then. I assume you aren't taking about the railroad?
---
YOU SPIN ME RIGHT ROUND BABY, RIGHT ROUND
---
Because they took a game engine where ranged combat centered around a slow time mechanic, and stripped said mechanic out of the game. So ranged combat doesn't work great. 
---
Certain aspects of melee combat seem to be unaffected by the change however. 
---
Fancy Jew nails. 
---
&gt; Please, go make me a screw in real life. I would LOVE to see this. Do it. Prove me wrong.
---
Right after you build a fusion reactor and some mini nukes.
---
Oh wait, we were talking about characters in a video game.
---
Some folks launched a nuke on prime last night, lowest level was 84. 6 of us firing non stop and we still couldn't manage the kill in the time limit. But the SBQ didn't fly off, assuming she was crippled, and we killed her maybe 2 minutes after getting the quest failed notification. But it took over 6k rounds of .50 and 2k rounds of 5mm, as opposed to the 3.5k of .50 it used to take. Total waste of time.
---
Yes but we all make mistakes
---
My dream weapon is a vampire explosive Radium Rifle. Never seen one. 
---
I mention the plasma gat all the time...but I think I am the only one who loves it. They are great weapons IMHO, but break really fast, so I carry 6 of them.
---
You realize thats one of the most overpowered weapons in the game right? You can charge that weapon 20 times. If it wasnt broken and worked you could 1 shot Scortchbeasts. It has the same stealth damage bug the guass rifle had and the ammo bugs. 
---
He was their to test you. He sends his children to test us of our will to live. This doesn't show that Mothman hates you, but he sees greatness in you.
---
Just keep in mind 
---
1 vampire won’t help you if the other guy is firing rads at you. 
---
2. Explosive isn’t proximity safe, and if the orher guy gets close, you can hurt (and even if you’re dense and fireproof, irradiate!) yourself dead. 
---
It does have a bug where when you equip it the rounds in the chamber are equal to the number of cores you have. So just remember to reload immediately after you equip it and then it is pretty great. There was a bug early on where all plasma weapons when they turn the enemy into a puddle of goo you couldn't loot the goo. That has been fixed.
---
% mitigation doesnt stack additivly like that. sentinal is applied first, then assassin to the remainder, then your DR following. 
---
Merely making conversation based on the traffic in this group versus what I recently experience. 
---
Just maybe they were not lying as some people imply. 
---
Just maybe. 
---
That’s what I said. 
---
No Man's Sky is a permanent fixture on my playstation, I'm utterly captivated by VR and  have enthusiastically spent more money on VR games last year than flat games, and I honestly haven't been able to put FO76 down since I started playing it. According to the mainstream, I *must* be an idiot. But I'm beside myself with the experiences I've been able to provide for myself thanks to these otherwise would-be failures. 
---
I suppose it could be because I was weened on Nintendo Power as a kid, but I have always preferred reviews that focuses on the *positives* of any given game rather than the negatives. I want to know why I should play a game rather than why I shouldn't.  I sometimes even read old reviews of games just for a good laugh at the ridiculous things they choose to criticize.
---
If you are on PC, somehow I have witches outfit plans read 
---
No... I panicked. I admit it. 
---
I immediately thought I fell victim to flaky programming as others implied they have. 
---
where do you say that exactly? 
---
IKR!!! 
---
This would be cool. I could see a lot of people wearing a hockey mask, straight jacket and wielding a chainsaw.
---
I knew id be melee in this game because if i dont have proper vats i cant aim for shit
---
I find screws every where when I scrap. Weapons , fans, lamp, other junk. How hard is it to just loot a place then bring the junk back and scrap 
---
Wow! I gotta try those places. Some places  I didn't realize would have legendaries or had possibility of ***.
---
well, if you're on PC and want a level 25 one you might as well have it, I'll be getting one from the quest eventually anyway
---
Ah, I remember on PS4 the WWW mod would crash the game sometimes, but almost always for me when I put explosive legendaries on these weapons.
---
The plans or a built suit, if you're on Xbox I could help out
---
how is that bad? thats pretty baller. put multi-barrel mod on it and you can fire 12 cannons. 
---
I don’t really have a problem with anything you have said. 
---
I personally would like berserker to be extremely high, but 300% is a pretty high amount. 
---
Seriously, I sell screws and springs in hundreds every couple of weeks. What the hell you guys using them for?!
---
Low key thinking about it rn I might have to just start a new game just so i feel I didn't waste $60
---
I gave some 11 year old kid help the day after Christmas and I finally had to block him because he was sending me voice chat requests and invites to his game as soon as I would turn my X Box on despite me telling him to stop it.
---
I hope he met some other people to be a kid with. 
---
The nerf was to stiff... and although I agree to an extent, the whole argument about tse guys kill stealing now applies  to the bloodied build guy who runs in to 2tap the 3star legendary.
---
So to an extend I understand the “without one your doing half the damage as anyone else” the OP damage still exists in the game , just as a different build.  And for clarification I’m not crying nerf bloodied... I understand the HP trade off... but all guns , tse included ,need a buff and all weapons in general need a rebalance.
---
Too late, that's why I'm now here...
---
Other guy’s bullet goes through 4, not 3, phases: 
---
Phase 1: if you got suppressor working on them. A 100 damage bullet can become, say, 80%. 
---
Phase 2: did it entirely miss you? This is the evade-the-whole-thing you get from emergency protocols or serendipity + sentinel/cavalier 
---
This can be made 100%.
---
Phase 3. Percentile Reduction. Assassin, dodgy, done wanderer, empath, empath+SIN. 
---
**This too** can be made 100%. 
---
Phase 4: DR. 
---
I wasn’t adding up phase 2 and phase 3 stuff as you suggested. I was saying **each one** can be cranked up to 100% independently. 
---
I myself had around 20 hours in the game before I gave up on it. This was at launch, I didnt pay money to play it (friend bought it) and am not previously already a fan of fallout so my stance differs. However, I have always been interested in fallout, love the ideas they had for how the game should play, and adore the environmental storytelling and open loneliness the map inspires. What I didnt like was constant crashing, the map not rendering, buildings not rendering while I'm inside them, and AI running through walls or spawning right next to me. I dont know if these issues have been patched since launch weekend, but as someone who had every reason to love the game and was not yet invested in money it turned me off the game permanently. I'm not sure who is at fault for the state of the game at launch but I refuse to support that kind of game release behavior.
---
Got about 150 hours in. Had quite a bit of fun exploring, finding random events, completing the storyline, etc. After that, it seems like I have completed just about everything that seems interesting to me. I am currently on a break from the game until the expansions come out. I had a good time, and got my money's worth out of the game already. Looking at the coming content, I see maybe another 100+ hours of playtime for me. I guess if I came in expecting a full-fledged MMO like Guild Wars or Warcraft, I would have been disappointed... I was expecting FO4 with some light MMO gameplay elements. I got what I was expecting, and I am very happy with it.
---
Holy shit! This guy actually looks like you'll go there to sell a rare 3 star weapon and he'll say:
---
"Best I can do is 50 caps."
---
Looks awesome though mate. And great business model! 
---
Junkie would work great if it was 10% damage per drug you were under the influence of.  Could add in addictions too to make it more universally appealing.
---
I started one r/fo76xboxone
---
That's negative sir, I fired it towards lvl 22 major gutsy and it took only small amount of his health, like less than 10% and I wasted over 900 ammo to that shot...
---
I started a subreddit for Xbox only r/fo76xboxone
---
Effective? No, the prime receiver bonus dmg vs scorched and the innate bonus dmg vs scorched stack for a nice chunk of extra damage. Economically it much better to run non prime. The cores take violet flux which is the most coveted flux(correct me if I’m wrong). 
---
If you really wanted to be more effective a furious GL w/prime would do better.
---
&gt;	I have approx 700 screws in my stash right now. I wish I could bulk them! Just waiting for the vendor to have caps so I can sell them
---
r/madlads 
---
Sorry, yeah, I didn't mean effective alone, I meant when considering that FCs that you find in frames all over the place don't require you to have to use the most valuable flux to craft into UFCs.  My logic is that if I have to craft a limited number of UFCs vs not caring about using up all the FCs I find, then I would have more ammo to use vs the queen vs the limited number of UFCs I craft.
---
If you’re on Xbox, I’d buy some from you. 
---
My Dense armor seems fine with fireproof. No self detonation. On vampire if he is firing rads, yeah I am screwed. If it’s ballistic, every bit helps. 
---
Damn. Me and my boyfriend love playing it and never get bored. I got the game in December for both of us when it went on sale. I get the part about logging in to get your atoms for the day but after seeing the roadmap and what’s in store, it just made me even more excited. I mean yeah sometimes I run out of things to do so I just go to a different game but then I end up coming back to fallout after an hour or so. Idk if you would call that bored? I have seen bugs with this game and yes it gets somewhat annoying but what can you really do? I just ignore it and try to find positives. Like I said, that roadmap has a lot of things I love and I can’t wait for it to come out. 
---
I have only played fallout 4 (bf got me into it as he has played quite a few fallouts) and I loved it. Loved the building and etc. This game has had little moments for me and him to enjoy and remember when he would watch me play fallout 4 and how we both wanted a multiplayer/or coop fallout. Fallout 76 was it. I stay away from reviews on games and wait for them to hit the sales before I spend my money on them. I don’t regret playing this game 
---
Yeah I agree with the rebalance and I LOVE some of the suggestions OP made for the changes to the legendaries. 
---
Tin pitchers have 2 lead in them.
---
I think by finding another one on a mysterious woman will let you back in.  Game just crashed so i cant be sure, but im gonna reload and try to find one.  Google places to find her, there are several locations in the SW.
---
only one thats 100% is serendipity. but i see what your saying in general now that i read your other bullets. carry on. 
---
Cobalt flux seems to be the hardest to get unless you purposefully nuke spots with it. So the ammo might be more expensive imo and a handmade will give you better damage anyways, and violet flux is easy to get from fissure site prime. 
---
I’d say if you could prime a handmade that would be better as far as rifles go. 
---
It’ll be your own rads that kill you though, not his ;)
---
Oh and yes, its been 3month and Bethesda still hasn't fixed this. Shouldn't complain because it's first and only bug during last 60h i have played but it was quite a bummer...
---
How many screws do you need. There are a lot of good places to loot
---
Lol. Good to know. I'll check it out tonight and see if I can catch the bugger.
---
Sounds great. I am checking it out!
---
Empath + strange in numbers = 31%
---
Dodgy = 30% (as long as you can keep up AP; 5 powered pieces and well-tuned and well hydrated  go a long way).
---
5 assassin = 40%
---
31% + 30% + 40% &gt; 100%.
---
Full suit and sorry im on ps4 :(
---
Becky! Look at her butt!
---
Carnivore is 1000% better btw. You can still use cranberry juice, and cobbler, as well as the best food% foods in the game. Not to mention grilled radstag is amazing. Not to crap on your choices, just of the two, carnivore is way better.
---
That's fine, good luck though
---
is there anything you need? if on PC I could use some
---
I'm a newbie, I just need radaway :(
---
Yeah... But I don't want to try to get rid of the other mutations that I have trying to get rid of herbivore...
---
Alas... The mutation is not the problem. It is the removal of my food when the game crashes.
---
... to get past the “phase 3” 100%, you need the quad radium rifle. With each hit taking 30AP and 10 hits per second, dodgy falls off. Also, I think you’ll be doing rad poisoning damage even if 100% of ballistic is nullified. 
---
... to get pst serendipity/sentinel, you need to make them **move**. 
---
&gt; Almost all toys have lead in them too
---
This is one of the details in the game i find hilarious
---
There must've been a typo in the description, you get *screwed*. Not screws.
---
Im not sure what you mean by lazy but if my build doesn't have certain things i start to 2 shot super mutants. Usually i can one shot them. A bud of mine uses lever action sneak and never has a problem with one shotting things. I'm not making his point I'm giving him options to actually try to increase his damage. Because seeing people actually call ranged weapons weak because of TSE nerf is just funny lmao. I feel like some people don't even try to increase their damage, they just wanted free damage from TSE.
---
My problems as someone who jumps in every and then to see how it’s progressed are the graphics and the performance. They frankly just look very outdated and performance is awful for me and I have a 1080ti and 8700k.   :(. Therefore it’s hard to get passed this.
---
Use the cap faucet to buy screws from the vendor's?
---
No BS here, but my track record with mods on Reddit isn't good. I have more posts removed than I can remember and a few subreddits I'm banned from for arbitrary rules bring broken. FO76 is one subreddit I've never had any issues with, so please new moderators, please be kind and only remove posts that are going to cause problems.
---
Only thing I need is stable violet flux lol. But no one has any. I am willing to give some screws away if you want to come get them, I'll be on in a while and then into the night probably. IGN wheeldogz
---
I think this is honestly a problem with how the game was marketed and promoted. If this game was just stealth-released in November, with no major promotional campaign, no months of speculation over every word Todd said at E3, I think the reception would have been a lot more positive. It wouldn't have the same expectations placed on it as a main series entry (because it's not one), we wouldn't be worrying about no human NPCs and being nuked by other players (because we'd just find that out as we go!), and I think it would have gone a lot better.
---
PC, sorry
---
Lol!!  At least 100 caps!  Thanks for the complement!!
---
The inability to scrap/craft screws is inexorably tied to why energy weapons are literally the worst weapons across the board: it's a balance issue. I could go into details, but as you're just some who plays games for fun you wouldn't understand the intricate interplay of metrics that underpin the top down decision making of game design. Anyway  here's a non-technical PR person who really (squee!) loves playing this game as much they love talking to the fans to explain how much they'll pass this on to the dev team.
---
Grew up in Finneytown, moved to Denver 6 years ago. I'm on xbox and PC with this username, feel free to invite if you see me online.
---
You don't want to know how many bulk adhesives I have 
---
If you use the Fletchet attachment you get 1-7 harpoons back after each kill, essentially giving you infinite ammo  
---
Yeah but you don't find that a bit silly?
---
Camo armor should definitely have a camo headlamp.
---
delete them and ban the posters. /solved
---
If you post in the market you could sell them off!
---
Haha but you know what i mean
---
😂👍
---
I see what you did there
---
I tho exactly this same. I didnt even wanted to touch this game, cause at some point i was fed up with negativity around it. Lucky me, my streaming partner (a buddy, not partner-partner) found a f76 for £10, then we bought another one at tesco for £30 and we dive deep. OH MY GOD! its nearly 3 weeks of streaming f76 day by day. OFC this game have a lot of problems, old engine, old mechanics etc. (weirdly bethesda didnt let f76 monsters grow with us in lvl) But god damn, right now i cant listen anymore to bad reviews about it...they sound like those people reading some kind of bullcrap and never been playing it. It might be though game when u are solo, but if u doing coop like us? SO MUCH FUN, LAUGHTS and waiting for new DLCS....
---
If you ever met me at ps4 please dont come too close... (name) i spread rot... -cough-
---
Lmao definitely!!! More of a family friendly place and we only served beer! Can’t wait to link up with all you guys and start playing together! The southern Ohio guild!!! Lmao we should start a page dedicated to it with everyone’s GTs so they could see if any locals were on before they started!
---
WTF. These used to be instanced, right? Like anyone who accessed the box would get their own loot.
---
Yeah but I have plenty of other stuff to sell. If giving screws to someone makes them  happy, that's what I'mma do
---
 Not at all. The Pistol is reasonable. The Dragon ridiculous. ;)
---
I also managed to find them on Grahm pretty randomly 
---
I'm using an xbox one X, Fallout 76 4K HDR , on an excellent UHD HDR LG TV,  and even four months after release this game LOOKS HIDEOUS!
---
Its a real step down from playing Fallout 4 on my Xbox One X.
---
I have played and studied the HDR and graphics with XB1X and I can confirm with all honesty, it is boxy, dull, grey and greyish blue (VERY BAD HDR coding).
---
If anyone says Fallout 76 looks good, they lie.  It FPS stutters always, even on XB1X ...it is straight up bad coding, bad game making ...its a lazy husk of a game ...extremely disappointing.
---
I agree, I got the game played through the beta made it to level 76 but now there’s nothing to do I’ve explored the whole map I’ve got good weapons and armour I’ve done all the quests and I’ve killed the queen multiple times for shit loot, is it a bad game? No it’s not bad, there’s a lack of content and some of the design choices in this game make no sense (we really should have text chat by now for pc) I’m mostly looking forward to the wastelanders expansion which is still a while off. 
---
For sure!
---
Screws are literally everywhere. I have like 100 without farming for them
---
Also some less obvious items with screws are hot plates and portable fuel tanks. I'm suprised at the number of times I see a place cleared out of fans but still having some of thoses laying around.
---
Your Vault-Tec simulation pod must be malfunctioning. 
---
Why not just scrap the money for cloth and sell it as bulk?
---
Single Action Revolver also needs more mods. It only has an ivory grip which doesn't even apply properly. At least, give it a hardened reciever to make it a good contender for .44 and Western Revolver.
---
my buddy and I find caps, not much tho.  we we're hoping to find some notes or story but eh.  still it's easy to hit the button running by, you don't have to loot it.  the caps are auto added for interacting.
---
I just bought the game yesterday and getting ready to load it up for the first time tonight. I barely know what this game is and didnt follow the bad press other than "its bad and you shouldn't like it". I'm just going to give a spin and see what it's like.
---
Screw is 2000 years old not 7000.
---
Nah, it won't. 
---
My Lvl 35 FE pump action is sitting at 205 base damage with roughly half the appropriate perks levels before the furious effect kicks in on the 2nd shot I take. Under the buffs I suggested I'd be doing 615 base damage. If I had all the perks maxed out for a shotgun build it'd easily be over 1k. If it happened to be a max level weapon it'd be closer to 1500. That's more than adequate compensation in exchange for running around in nothing more than a vault suit and Lvl 5 light leather armor in the Cranberry Bog. There's no way that's more than 50 Dmg or Eng res. That's what you'd call a highly specialized build.
---
Sent you a PM
---
I actually bought 4 and NV 😁 Dtarted playing 4 and I love it!
---
IGN? 
---
The Brotherhood could make use of your services. 
---
Would love to see a photo of your shelf stairs
---
Go through the BoS questline to get the plans, level up to 50 to be able to craft it @ 50.
---
Assuming you're on Xbox here,
---
 The audio has been screwy for months and the only way to get good levels out of speakers is to have your headphones plugged in at the same time. Stupid, but it works.
---
Empty servers? I'll have one of them please.  No idea what's happening there, sorry.
---
Yeah I dig it. 🤙🏻 
---
Life is too short to work a job you hate.  You can change your position.  It will change how happy you are trust me.  I thought I was stuck and changed where I worked after 7burs.  The grass is greener on the other side! 
---
Preach! You took the words right out of my mouth. I too, feel like we're being punished. The game was designed to be a free for all but it can't be because we've got weaklings demanding the game be watered down in hopes they can make it something its not. Fallout 5.
---
A UGL usually lasts me 4-5 cores(with gunsmith 5 and a decent amount of Luck of the Draw). I don’t use anything anything else that requires violet flux so I don’t mind investing all of it into the gun. If you use another Ultracite weapon that requires violet then I wouldn’t bother with the ultracite fusion cores and it would be more efficient to use regular ones.
---
Try that isolated radio array above wes tek for screws. Now days I have so many, maybe close to 1k. But when needed them that was the farm.
---
There's a lot of fans and a couple globes in that place, plus a legendary assaultron for loot. Bunch of clipboards in that control room for springs. Also a bunch of fans you can get in the enclave military wing.
---
Eh, sometimes you're just really overencumbered and nowhere near a crafting table.
---
Plus a lot of people, like me, like to leave their CAMP where it is. For me, it's for the fast travel point, for others it may be because they want it in a high traffic area for others, or they just put a lot of time into decorating it and moving it all the time would defeat all that.
---
I would buy atoms to get an inflatable Deathclaws with \*crazy\* moving claws.
---
How do you flush with caps when the limit is only 25k? Serious question since I have a bunch of items that I wanted to unload but I’ve reached 25k so I don’t know what to do. Bethesda if you’re listening could you increase the caps limit so the in-game economy could flow better? I’m sure this is much easier than stash size increase on the tech side. 
---
&gt;Feel really jipped.
---
Maybe even *screwed*
---
Lol love for all Ohioans!! Too bad of tho!!
---
Im level 50, but i dont have the enclave quest done yet, so, im asking for a favor haha
---
I would love to see mods for the crossbow however I would like Bethesda to take a good look at ALL weapons and make an effort to balance them, fix bugs (like the charging tesla rifle causing players to crash), and possibly balance some perk cards related to weapons.
---
I have a furious Minigun. For the most part, you can see the damage start to increase as you continue to hit your opponent. But also, yes, if a stray bullet hits another then you start over.
---
Good idea; or adding a more simplistic method for trading.
---
That is pretty frustrating. The jukeboxes in Fallout 4 play different types of music. Also the radios. and the neon signs can be different colors. I don't know why we get so few choices in this game.
---
I sold one the other day so it definitely exists 
---
&gt; Carlisle Typewriter

---
where can we find these good typewriters?
---
Ya nah. You dont need help finding out how
---
Thanks, I had no idea what building supplies they wanted.
---
What do you mean?
---
Lol I just thought, I might have a hoarding problem because depending if my perk cards are working, I’m usually around390-450!! Lol don’t know if I can get that weight from t60!!?? 
---
I too disagree with the zero expectations, but im going to take your 0 as hyperbole, and assume i need to lower or set aside my petty ones. Done and done. Agreed fo76 is great now.
---
Vats i mean is what i use. Lmao
---
:)
---
Are you on PC? Care to mod mine for materials and some Caps?
---
A level 53 killed me after I save and made the heart symbol. He teabagged me, when I returned to my corpse he waved and did the heart.
---
That was my first experience with another player in this game :(
---
Yeah the roadmap looks very interesting indeed ! Not so much the brewing one, looks like a whole-lotta micromanaging. But future stuff looks cool.
---
Placeable junk in camp &lt;3
---
But it's entirely reflective of the state of the game. People want them to pay attention to their requests, which is funny because they never have in the past.
---
If you select the challenge, it will collapse out into a list of all the different components that will count. Same goes for other challenges that are worded vaguely like "kill 5 huge creatures"
---
Agreed. I don't have many hours in FO76 because my pc went belly up right after I started it. The pc is better now (after replacement of HD with a 2TB hd, a 0.5 TB and another 1TB ssd). My kid is playing the hell out of Overwatch on the pc now. But i expect sometime soon I will pick up 76 again. And I know I'll visit every location, read every document, listen to every tape, and do every quest because that's what I do with Bethesda games. They promised there would be ongoing development for years ahead, under the warframe model, so there will always be content. 
---
The boo crowd seem to have forgotten that 76 is both a Bethesda game and a MMO, and there is not a MMO out there that launched with no major problems. This is no different. 
---
Tesla rifle's actually good. Others nah. Every single one of thems got some issue with durability and break after 30 seconds of usage
---
I leave mine in place because it’s right next to a shrine in the woods. Creepy place, and I love it!
---
Text to voice, would keep with their current ideal and allow us non mics to communicate.  Other games do it, wouldn't be hard.
---
Has anyone gotten unbanned yet it’s been almost a month and I’m still not able to get in
---
Oh cool, never figured that out. Thanks.
---
If Bethesda ignored the "Bethesda please" post, and didnt do anything to address the players concerns, undoubtedly y'all would certainly be even more butthurt about the lack of feed back or effort. 
---
And certainly complain about that too. 
---
Things are improving, And Bethesda game developers have shown they care about their product and fans.  
---
Let the wheel keep turning. 
---
damage-wise: they’re ok-ish
---
break way too fast though, with gunsmith 5, my laser rifle breaks after ~600 rounds
---
There's a mod for Fallout 4 that has the reloading benches already made. Fallout 76 wouldn't even have to design them, just take them from the mod. Pay the author. Easy. they look GREAT too
---
Has anyone that got soft banned been able to get back in it’s been almost a month...
---
Awe I’m ready to hit up some bars and get wasted! No but really I mean it’s something to do and I might make a bar at my camp. But YES placeable junk is everything! In fallout 4 I loved decorating my camp by dropping items and placing them around in my settlements. Player vending is what I’m most excited for! I’ve been collecting different things I’m going to sale at my store for cheap!  
---
On PS4, sorry 😐
---
I'm often totally flabbergasted at how some people just don't check containers. I check everything lol. I put so much mats and ammo and aid into the cash register at WS at Artisan's Corner and/or the canvas bag at the WS train station next to the tinker's bench...  and see people drop their ammo in bags next to it, and leave. They really missed out on a ton of good mats and aid. I gotta start getting on the mic and telling them to look in the cash register etc
---
There’s 50 songs on the main radio.
---
Even taking out the repeats from the other games it’s still more than any other Fallout game’s main radio.
---
Though I wonder what is the theoretical minimum. If a radio had 100 all-new songs, would people still feel it repeats too often? 500?
---
Sadly, no Fallout DLC has added new licensed music that wasn’t heard in the main game. Fallout 4 had new original songs, but even the Mysterious broadcast had songs already heard in the casinos.
---
With weapon artison+master scientist does the base duability shoot way up? Master Scientist says "craft energy weapons with more durability". So, without gunsmith lv5 i should be using balistic guns until then?
---
I found the tesla plan+a tesla charging shotgun, i'm tempted to build around it.
---
Think you’re going to struggle to find someone to make a full suit for free.
---
So if you have aa on your melee weapon, should you only use 1 rank of incisor, or just drop the perk all together?
---
I'm pretty shure there's a subliminal message from beth in the whole "needing screws and getting screw" Idk, pun intended on there part right😅
---
Yes that would be why it works for you. Last patch broke it for players that already had it
---
I believe they are nerfing all weapons hell last night I got a level 50 Harden Combat Sniper Rifle and it did barely any damage to a scorched at Harper’s Ferry they are needing the weapons and increasing the difficulty of the enemies it’s crazy and Bethesda side note players can still use explosive bullets to one shot you thought you fixed that eh? Guess not...
---
https://discord.gg/T5jNp5 filthy casual Discord but it has a ps4 section 
---
Thanks for the advice, I'll give that a try.
---
It's just that in Fallout 4, you could sell pre war money for 1 cap per dollar. I kind of miss that
---
We really should get ballistic fiber from things that require it when crafting or repairing. Heck, I'd even take an off-chance if getting it from those things.
---
Put it all in the cash register next time. The Cash register at Artisan's Corner has infinite storage, and the contents won't go away until the server resets. Paper bags can dissapear when you leave the cell or leave the game. 
---
JANE, get me of this crazy thing!!!
---
You didn't say "Bethesda Please"
---
I wish there’s an emote that says ‘not now thanks’. I’ve got people wanting to trade with me all the time, esp in Nukespring, I don’t have a mic but I wish I could tell them in the politest way that I don’t want to do trade at the moment. If I have anything that I don’t want to keep, I simply drop them in a paperbag in front of the vendor’s counter. 
---
Thanks mate :) appreciate it. Like most here we don't really give a RadRat's ass about the comment votes but the downvoting does seem indicative of those who can't stand anyone liking the game.
---
There were at least a dozen running at one point, I would bet at least a few are still online.  I played FOnline 2238 (the predecessor to FOnline: Reloaded) for two or three years - massively addictive.   There was a decent one set in Eastern Europe, one set in Phoenix, one in Oregon, etc.  You need a copy of Fallout 2 to play any of these - the games all relied on the two main asset files (master.dat and critter.dat) from Fallout 2 that you'll need to copy into the game directory if you do decide to try one.
---
I poked around and it looks like at least these are still online:
---
* [FOnline: Reloaded](https://www.fonline-reloaded.net/index.html)
---
* [FOnline 2](https://forum.fonline2.com)
---
* [FOnline: Requiem](http://forum.fallout-requiem.ru/)
---
Nice one, should have done it for the nuked flora alone :)
---
Sent request! Upvote this so maybe more will see and link up with us🤷‍♂️
---
Thanks!
---
Yes, we only think of them as that lock picking tool that’s not a bobby pin. 
---
There was a specific flatwoods monster episode
---
I can provide the mats, is just a suit without mods, why that would be so crazy?
---
That made me smile... "at work has been brutal".  When I first read that, I thought you meant that you weren't getting any good drops while playing at work.  :)  sometimes I'm slow.
---
I think it's only fair that however many stars you put it is how many you should get out. 
---
Post didn’t say you’d help with mats, thought you just expected to get a suit. I understand now.
---
Sorry men, my bad :/
---
As a matter of fact, when I read something apart and put it back together, I am absolutely GUARANTEED to end up with more screws than I started with, somehow.
---
But that's the challenge though! Any more and people will complain it's not enough, just like the stash space. 
---
I just hoard it until I have a couple thousand rounds, then post it on Reddit for someone to come buy
---
Tesla Rifle benefits from Rifleman perks. Hits like a freight train with maxed out Rifleman, Expert and Master. The only other "mandatory" perk would be Batteries Included for ammo weight reduction. 
---
Put songs on the atom store. No but really if we expect bethesda to add real content they need real money to make it happen years down the road for this game. 
---
This.
---
My muffled .45 pipe revolver will 1 shot (to the head) a level 68 mutant/scorched/ghoul at night time as long as I'm close enough and it's easy when sneak doesn't bug out on me.
---
Once the rest of the mob start looking for me it's usually 2-3 headshots (this is where gun fu &amp; focused fire shine) unless they have really located me (danger!) so I run off to get back into sneak.
---
Daytime is harder because I am specced for night but it is not impossible.
---
I mainly only use Crits against scorch beasts, assultrons and sentry bots ( mainly because I forget unless the enemy is soaking damage) 
---
Play TTW. Graphics are so much better for FO3 and NV with that mod. 
---
Thats my opinion to,  but I also feel the same about the current "slot machines" if you kill a 3 star Legendary you should get 3 star loot. 
---
 But thats not the case, and I hope they don't replicate this. 
---
How do you "coke" with a headlamp?.. you know what, forget I asked. 😆
---
Less than a month in I accidentally dropped my all rise in a nuke zone and it instantly despawned lol
---
Ive been thinking about these types of ideas a lot lately. What I would like to see would be an offline (not in game) vendor/trading mode.
---
Lets say I open the “FO76” iOS/Android App, I could deploy my CAMP to an available world. Maybe the items Im selling would be registered in the “Vendor List” section of the app, and users who need a particular item would get a push notification that your store is available with the item they are looking for.
---
The vendor section of the app would allow users to peruse/search and purchase items all through your mobile phone. They could manage their own inventories, harvest crops, junk, water, craft etc to make these commodities available in the vending machines.
---
This concept would take this game to a whole new level of player engagement &amp; interactions, not to mention role playing immersion.
---
Add me. zombiemann77. It might be like 9:00pm central before I can hop on, but if you've got the mats I'll hook you up
---
IKR
---
Can u tell me the mats when u online? To check
---
Oh shit thanks for pointing that out
---
It’s totally fine, it’s on me too. I’m on Xbox as well I’d help out if I could.
---
He's not. Key word was if. 
---
You could also finish the quest line and get a complete prototype suit for free no crafting required just have to repair it when you complete the quest
---
Thats the ultracite PA
---
The oft requested ability to save decks would solve a lot of problems.  
---
Most complaints stem from the fact that we need to swap cards in and out depending on the fight style, crafting, fixing, etc.   If we had the ability to save decks with different names it would make things a lot easier.  
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/18/fallout-76-prototype-x-01-power-armor-crafting-guide/

I don't have powersmith. So plan on the full list. 
---
Oh yea my bad
---
I have 600+ screws in my stash AMA

Look around this game. Do you really think there's any chance of them doing anything else?

Turn right, go all the way down hallway, turn right and go down this  hallway and straight through the theater. Up the stairs 2 stories up, turn to your right and go to the end wall. Hand scanner is there.. And yeah, had noticed the bunker entrance being at a higher level than the service entrance;)
---
If you XBOX1 I got plenty of screws to sell. I've been hoarding them most of the game because I heard they were rare. I got over 300... almost 400... just hit me up if interested... I tried selling them on reddit in the past but nobody was interested.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Right? I usually see people downvote that are talking horribly about the game. Strange they’d downvote you.. your post wasn’t saying anything bad at all. Just talking about people getting back into it which is cool! 
---
Never felt so good killing an Npc. 
---
I struggle with this on Xbox as well. Instead I just go pester someone with my commie whacker or protest sign, 80% of the time solves my problem.
---
I have only 300 and don’t feel secure in the slightest
---
All we need is a cnc or even a metal lathe to make rods, then a tap and dye kit and we can make threaded rods. Would definitely need a metal lathe to actually make screws. Flat head screws would be the easiest to make. 
---
There is nothing more aggravating than that. Also, if you are over level 100, you should get a level 50 piece. I'd be all for less 3 star enemies if it meant that when you found one, it guaranteed a level 50 3 star piece drop, even if it had not ideal rolls. It should also scale to your level as well. No level 15 guy should get a kernel 50 piece. 
---
Ok will do!! Great idea!
---
A trick that a lot of people are using us to place a round carpet on the ground and then place plants around it.  When you pick up the round carpet, the plants come with it and you can place them anywhere, even on a tile floor. 
---
Another trick is to use potted plants as the base. 
---
But yes, they should have the same type of planters that you find in greenhouses in the game.  
---
I wish we could trade them player to player
---
Then is it an oversight that the SS doesnt remember them during that dialog with DEMA?
---
You are 100% correct sir. Agreed 76 has its issues absolutely no doubt. But this game can still be fun. My favour part about any of the new fallout games has just been exploring the wastelands. The notes and holotape do an amazing job of telling a story in lack of NPC story telling.
---
This game is still fun, definitely not a 10/10 but still a strong 6 with maybe potential to be a 7 with DLC, updates and fixes. 
---
We're hoping for an 8 one day but let's not get a head of ourselves. 
---
I’m on PS4 but my advice would be wait till you’re lvl 50 and go in alone if you take a group you create more enemies the more people you’re with. Just my experience. Also watch some videos on how they run the silo to get a idea of what’s to come.
---
If you don't have hundreds or thousands of spare screws right now, then you are doing something wrong. Well if you are just starting out then that is a growing pain. After like level 35, screws should not be an issue. 
---
I played this game like a single player game and I loved it.  I did a few pvp stuff along the way but for the entire story I was by myself and it felt just like Fallout.  It done if the reasons I still play it from time to time cause of then dlc hopefully.  The end game pvp stuff got boring quick but hopefully they add more 
---
I was very disappointed when I took scrapper and it basically did jack and also shit.
---
The "camp fire" under lights will let you plant on it 
---
I think I have 80-100 and it gives me night sweats
---
We need to start saying u/Ladydevan
---
You sure you are not wanted? It would show as if there was no one else
---
i know its an exotic weapon..but i dont think there are any perks for that..so i guess they just classify as a rifle???
---
I think it’s enough and you can move points around you see fit.  I think we need the ability to have separate builds for different situations without having to move points all the time 
---
PS4 bröther
---
I know what you are saying, but forgive me, as mentioned I've had a few, I look at the vastly complicated programming effort to needed to allow people around the world to play simultaneously  in this graphically (imho) stunning and immersive world and I am genuinely in awe. Then as a Level 260 player I get a drill from a 3\* Level 62  Mutant, and the sad shake of head auto kicks in. 
---
Thank you I'll be on at midnight to get it much appreciated 
---
Thanks everyone I'll check those places out! Need the plans to craft one for my buddy as well 
---
I am most definitely wanted lol that explains it
---
Screws...are not that hard to come buy lol. I've got like a thousand. Bulked up with extras. 
---
I’m online now if anyone else wants to check the stairwell out.
---
PS4: GoofyOnSafari 
---
When playing in groups with someone that has magnetic personality 2 and at least 6 charisma they can give you the extra 6 you need (with a full group) to reach 15 charisma so you can share makeshift warrior 5 and gunsmith 5. 
---
I sopped playing and honestly don't feel like getting back on anyways. They need to fix PvP, bugs, and the lacking endgame content before I am coming back.
---
The "I don't get the haters, the game is GREAT" posts are wearing rather thin.
---
I'm glad that people whose endgame is puttering around the camp, doing an occasional quest and maybe even hitting up a vendor are having a great time. That might sound sarcastic, but this sort of game can truly cater to a very wide base.
---
But chalking the months and months of bugs, server crashes, massive loot lag, seemingly intentional omissions/changes (scrapper and the whole weapon/armor mod system comes to mind) and near radio silence for weeks on end until very recently... entirely to angry Youtubers with some sort of evil mission to take down Bethesda is both asinine and naive. There have absolutely been far too many YT channels that have gone apeshit over the slightest issues, but they're aren't the problem here.
---
Releasing a AAA priced game that felt like an early invite alpha is the problem.
---
I hear you! Last night I had a fantastic 2\* Shishkebab drop, think it was anti-armor and +50% limb damage. Thought to myself "sweet! time to try out 1H melee". Then I saw the damage on the item, laughed heartily, and into the stash it went. Fingers crossed that devs notice your post and I can bring it back out for some fun someday.
---
The peanut gallery always has ideas for improvement.
---
I think we should have resource bags like the one you find in Vault 76 at the start of the game accept these resource bags will now spawn all around the world like cap stashes and you can obviously loot them for components but with the scrapper perk you can "search" them for more stuffs.
---
Cheers mate. 
---
Hmm, is this where the moon monkey got his name??
---
Yep. I built an amazing tavern and finally just scrapped the jukebox out of it today after getting tired of my usual routine of "fast travel to camp and run into my bar to turn off the same ol' classical track again". I don't even 100% care if the jukebox plays music at all, just let it have pretty lights in my bar and be silent!
---
&gt; ce you've performed the perfunctory task of scrolling through the vendor mods and lo and behold: 3 Vaultboy light mods, there's some ammo on an end table just to the right of the armor/weapons workbenches.
---
&gt; Just when you've thought you've brought meaning back into your post-apocalyptic life, you realize there's an unintended consequence. The bobby pin boxes, which spawn the most consistently, are a good measure of how many times you've done this. When you come to the horrifying realization you somehow have more bobby pins than you ever did in Fallout 4, you are back to feeling utterly useless again.
---
Thank you, this helps a bunch, I'm hunting them down with no luck, things are bad, camp can't be placed on some worlds...
---
That seems so ridiculously sensible it beggars believe they have the current system instead. 
---
 I'm max capped and stashed, I do the WS/WT/Watoga Loop and end up with a ton of legendary I can neither scrap or sell. Or even give away, the majority of "Lowbies" are alts who also do not need L40 wood anything and know that a instigating 10mm is as much value as a ordinary 10mm.
---
 So dropped and lost. Frustrating.   
---
The reasons why we can’t make screws is because Robco and Vaulttech co own the patent on screws, and are locked behind drm. The authorization keys to unlock the screw plans have long been lost to the war.
---
Genuinely can’t say which are the rarest outfits, (I appreciate that doesn’t help much), but a couple of days ago I got the bos engineers outfit and it looks brilliant with the medical goggles.
---
And life preservers, hah. They do weigh a bit though.
---
I dont mind seeing them, I personally find them a ot easier to see the different ideas that come about as opposed to having a big thread where everything is just lost to the abyss
---
They do? I've heard the perk sometimes doesn't work with any energy rifles. How is the charging shotgun affected?
---
I need the compound bow it's in the damn files everything sounds, animations and models I need this 
---
Okay...   that explains things.  I had the same thing happen to me.  I knew that I had done the supply drop event before without getting wanted.   I was also confused.  I dropped everything in my stash and went to White springs, insta-kill...   
---
I don’t feel bad about an empty drop for the bounty hunters because they get easy caps.  I had to spend more than the 10 caps in traveling just to get the bounty off.  
---
I really wish they add a way to pay off bounties, perhaps at a vendor. 
---
It cant work that way, otherwise you would just sit there and keep rerolling until you get what you want. More likely you will need ti scrap/sell 2 or 3 legendaries to get a new one.
---
I don't know about the shotgun or charging lasers. I put away my lever action in favor of a suppressed Tesla
---
How does it make me an idiot for not being above human error? Please explain that. Like i’ve said easy fix: favourited items become undroppable/sellable etc.
---
If you played on pc you would know that the control scheme is terrible (but you don’t because you just hop to conclusions), “r” is the drop key its very close to “awsd” keys to move around very easy to hit (but you resort to calling me an idiot) and that the trade menu is broken you can select one item for trade, but if you nudge the mouse over to another item before hitting confirm it will sell the item you nudged to not the one you initially selected, I’ve played the console versions of beth games and the drop item button is chosen to be far away from where your thumb rests making this mistake much less likely. But I don’t expect you to comprehend that for multiple obvious reasons.
---
One more headache inducing flying fuck gone, thanks 
---
I think I have over 1000. 👍
---
Alright, sweet. I'll give it a chance.
---
I just linked you the page to show what the studio is. My claim is widely known, only fucking morons like yourself don't know whats happening. The studio literally doesn't have anything else to work on, what would they move on to? Fo76 needs more work than this studio has been able to put into it during its time so far, why would they move on even if they did have other shit to do? Considering BGS's claims of continued support and development your ideas here seem pretty stupid.
---
Great post!!  I agree with all of this I'd like to toss in the expanded plantable plants like add them all so I can have massive gardens and proper indoor garden boxes 
---
That's a great idea. I saw one with a farm inside. 
---
I do the floating house thing. It keeps ghouls and supernatants from tearing my CAMP apart quite so bad. 
---
Really? I never knew that. I have an instigating tesla that has been just taking up space in my inventory. Maybe I'll move some points around and play with it for a while. Thanks for the info.
---
I don't see why they never added a two star scrapper perk at 50 that improved the chance to get screws etc anyways. Seemed like the next step in leveling up.
---
Dang it, I wish there was someone like this on ps4. Would love to find someone with pure violet flux. Just got the plans for t51 calibrated shocks and found out I need the flux to craft it.
---
I've played since the beta all my friends left the game :(
---
You are right of course, but just to continue the negativity train I am on, they could just add a chance of getting nothing. You know, like they currently have with legionaries. (go Drill!)
---
I sort of let my 4 year old play this, he just wanted to see what I was doing and have a go himself, was his first time using a controller or playing on a computer so he was sat on my lap while I showed him what to do.  
---
he played it for about 20 mins, managed to kill a couple of the liberators at the vault then went off to go play with his toys again.  
---
I dont mind my son playing like that where he was literally on my lap and I could see everything that was happening, but I wouldnt let him roam around unsupervised on it
---
I've seen a few with a farm inside.  I might try that one day.  The floating house thing is interesting but not my personal style.  I use a missile turret to deal with super mutants and ghouls.
---
Well, they are obviously coming eventually? Weapons have slots for up to 5 stars but no one has ever found anything better than 3.
---
I had a flamer with Explosive Shot. It shot bullets instead of flames.
---
My first character was a rifleman, got to 74, but unlike you I was weak and joined the dark side.
---
Oh lord. I could see that happening and then waiting weeks for a fix.
---
I am level 270 ppl under lvl 50 run, some people around level 50 and 60 with sentinels armor come up and attack me so that they can rave over defeating a high level player get one shot by me despite their op armor, literally everyone at lvl 100 and above just spam emotes at me and people around my level seem to no longer exist. 
---
Why not?
---
Okay, God of Screws over here
---
I'd give my left arm for an instigating Tesla. I do a lot of stealth play. Instigating + sneak bonus = splat
---
Can we do something about this kind of post?
---
I feel like you’re not actually understanding my argument. I’m explaining why nerfs are sometimes necessary. 
---
http://imgur.com/a/SpmfjR1 here is am image of it. I couldnt get a super clear shot because the camera wouldnt go inside. But I did use the stairs successfully.
---
I always thought that it would get exponentially and prohibitively expensive the more you rolled. 
---
*Bethesda please* deal with it
---
Just for all of you with copious screws I'm interested in trading for them. PSN lordskorb.  I have a lot of other bulk stuff, some aid, and can get quickly the Nuka cola paint for a t51b. So yeah
---
I have numerous characters that I created just to store inventory and caps.  Sometimes these are referred to as mules, but for me they are my banks and warehouse.   As they get full I go and create another character.  The pain is transferring inventory to and from them, so I have associated that I've hired to be the go between my main character and any of my mule characters. 
---
Agree.  I dont mind spending the time and effort tracking down rare ingredients...but if I do they BETTER not spoil in 30 minutes wtf is the point?
---
Don’t you need screws to build most that stuff?
---
I got an instigating me handy buzz blade.
---
Not as handy as I would have liked it to be.
---
Mutants should go up the more mutations you have with a cap 
---
I’d have to leave that decision up to you after reading more of the comments below. Depends on what you want to do and if you feel the points used are as valuable or more valuable as combining other perks. A lot depends on your play style and how much damage you want to do. 
---
Hey, I've got a Legendary Hunters crossbow, if you think you'd want it. Xbox1
---
Haven’t had the chance to do it myself, but I believe I read where you place X’s across where you want your letters and overlay your letters and then remove the X’s?  Sounds half-way plausible. 
---
You forogt the part where you dont have to play the game with 30 hit points.  It's not easy.
---
Then people would just lock up prime real estate with their main camp and still have all if the tools for traveling. There is should be a cost of building permanent mansions.
---
At my level, I do not use a permanent base. I cram 4 benches, a bed, and campfire on 3 foundations. A water pump and 2 turrets nearby. No walls, stairs, doors. I set up where I plan to explore and pay a few caps to move it every few days.
---
In fallout we only know how to insert screws with all those screwdrivers laying around. Evidently 'lefty loosey, righty tighty' is knowledge lost in the great war. 
---
It can be nice to have multiple tiers for build flexibility, so there is a functionality to it, but it would be nice to be able to trade in stuff you really don’t want or need.  A 1:1 system wouldn’t hack it in my opinion though, because then you could just use the system to change whatever you want whenever you want, which seems counterintuitive to the game.  I know, I know, but it isn’t Borderlands.
---
I feel you.  Do you have the materials or are you offering caps?  Are you asking for a gift?
---
Screws are not hard to find...
---
Im offering the mats but im afraid i dont have all of them, so, how much caps?
---
Even adding crafting as a high level card would be fine. 
---
When your CAMP has everything except a tap and die set.
---
Totally agree, like the syringe rifle 
---
Nice how you don't respond to the fact that you are lazy. Keep whining and see what that gets you
---
It's because you played other survival games. You have higher expectations. I played every single survival game out there. Started playing f76 since BETA. Started out boring, reached peak excitement at around lvl 50 and lost all excitement at around lvl 110. Played the whole game with my best friend who also likes Fallout and this made it not a chore to level up and grind. I play it every two weeks nowadays. It's honestly such a broken game. Some game-breaking bugs still exist for me and they are far too slow with bringing in meaningful changes to the game. I also have a feeling that the roadmap updates will be buggy messes. 
---
While I still think f76 is a good contender when it comes to multiplayer survival games (as I hated rust and ark official pvp servers and pve was not as fun as f76 for me), it comes nowhere near games like Subnautica or The Forest. F76 is simply average bordering mediocre.
---
I could try that, it's a bit of a resource drain but if it works I will let you know.
---
Strange in numbers makes some mutations work in reverse sometimes
---
I'm actually glad I preordered it for this very reason. I still can't go into Charleston without the game freezing after the first patch and since I didn't farm xp I not in the hundreds level wise so leveling is stupid slow. I used to be able to kill things 10 levels over me and now shit behind the whitespring resort are nothing but bullet sponges. I now spend more time making ammo than killing stuff. It's just no fun. 
---
Nah, just responded that you seem to be confusing a video game with real life.
---
Also, thanks to working some in a machine shop when I was younger, I can make a screw.  But my character is not me.
---
...omg that name’s familiar, pretty sure I’ve been bs one-shot by tacocat before as well. Sorry to hear that asshat got you too.
---
As for the letters, seems kinda random to me. I have a blueprint for workshops that’s like the Filthy Casual sign but with “Public Workshop” in neon letters, and half the time I place it and the S is backwards. It’s definitely annoying, I think I wound up starting from the middle of words to minimize the jank.

Reddit moderation should have nothing to do with knowledge of the subject. Reddit is about people having a place to chat, not about someone on high deciding whose opinions deserve to be heard. Even if people are talking crap, provided they're not harassing, trolling, spamming or being abusive, their comments should, in no way, be filtered or censored.  The whole point of Reddit is discourse, inclusion and free speech.  It's not a show-place for know-it-alls, people with control issues or those who want to push their personal agendas as to what comments they consider acceptable. 
---
Not here. Go on Twitter, no one is going to stop you there. 
---
Range that has damage fall off in less than sprinting distance, and recoil, the advantage of 'range' doesn't really matter much when melee weapons typically do more damage over time, doubly so when ammo is accounted for (as the hard hitting weapons tend to have rare ammo for a baseline, not getting into legendaries as they break everything, both melee, and ranged)and again, guns seem to weigh more then melee, and then also have bullets driving that weight up more
---
the cons of guns MASSIVELY outweigh the pros, doubly so when compared to melee
---
Yeah, he has a habit of being a douche canoe.   
---
That does not bode well for me and replacing my camp LUL
---
There are loads of images on the FO4 Reddit. It's much better than this one - less wankers, too. 
---
Silver is used in some armor mods. Aluminum in some weapons I believe. Not sure about gold but it can be sold to a vendor without bulking it. I set my base on one foundation. Only resource mining and water purifier is separate. Five minutes and my camp is set up. Makes moving to a desired resource or farming area easy.
---
if it wasn't for dadgum EVERYTHING needing boiled water I wouldn't mind it so much, but 'wanna craft juice or tea, that's two wood, 2 dirty water, and one plant thing per, for simple/basic things'  It get's pretty rediculous, pretty fast, and honestly the mid/late tier teas are so much better than purified water that there is really no reason to build a damn water purifier.
---
And with cooking: thistle tea is the only cooking item in the game I've yet to craft and it makes me sad as I've spent the entire game (200ish hours iirc) with a chef hat on.
---
+1 for “Cheesers”...
---
Get them whilst they still have that atomic glow!
---
...wow.  My [strategy guide for SwarmSim](https://redd.it/3t0drr) comes to 5672 words.  This one comes to 4234 words.  It's a pity you weren't doing this back in the 1990s, you could probably have published it with Prima and made a couple bucks.  (I never wrote a strategy guide for a game Prima would have published one for, so meh.)
---
Legit service. Found all 3 items I wanted within 12 hrs. Prices were good and fast to make the trade. Highly recommend seller. 
---
I would love to build a tree house out there. 
---
Yeah I feel your pain, I actually LOST items when I transferred items between my main and my alts (mules). I put a few items in a box and logged out when my friend stayed on the server, just when I logged in with my alt, server crashed and kicked everyone out. Several pieces of my Legendaries was gone forever. Anyone found a paper bag near vault 76 with an All-rise, a Daisycutter and an explosive 50 cal, those were mine, enjoy 😭
---
"I like PvE and PvP and I shouldn’t be forced into a hardcore survivalist PvP server where no one cares about PvE just because I enjoy the risk of player interactions that can go south." 
---
But I should be forced into PVP? ...? No, plenty of games have survived with a pvp system where it allows players to opt out if they want too. Passive mode should be just that .. Passive.
---
I got mine in watoga on top of one of the buildings. 
---
Would love this for cranberries as well
---
BOOM!
---
I would try the market, someone would definitely buy this.
---
You're literally proving my point. The game is broken. Don't try and defend it. Hell, I went on playstation live yesterday, and ONE person was livestreaming this
---
Speaking of screws
---
What’s the best location for them, I need to make the excavator power armor
---
and distressingly true to life, you can still find a ton of lead in toys from barely twenty years ago. yellow paint was a major culprit, but the further back you go, the more common lead was in everyday life. 
---
Clearly the vendor bots use the same pricing strategy as GameStop.
---
I like the covered bridge idea. I might have to steal that!
---
Block them, and their derpy little helpers too
---
I haven’t figured out how to transfer caps between alts and mine character though, so far my alts are only for junks, weapons and armors storage.
---
[removed]
---
What sign?  
---
;)
---
I only find battered ones :(
---
I never had issues with screws hahah I have always and still have like 600 screws at any time, you want them? 
---
I wish you were on pc. I Need the witches dress. ;)
---
I have never been short of screws. Just mark them for search and you’ll find them everywhere. Seriously I have been selling bulk screws 
---
I swear, before it was adhesive, but now I have the crops for vegetable starch, and now it’s THE GOD DAMN SCREWS THAT ARE LIMITING ME
---
\+++1 for whopitmusPrime

\+karma
---
That's what I'm talking about. I'll have to check that out!
---
Haha yeah, today at work was busy. Because of the drops last night I got very little sleep "just one more crate" "just one more Scorchbeast" and then I was like "oh cool, I can still get 3.5 hours of sleep if I fall asleep after this next crate"
---
Imma direct you to r/Fo76FilthyCasuals for that
---
It would be effective if he couldn't just see me while I'm streaming find my server.  Now I leave him unblocked so I have a heads up when he's around.  
---
At launch scrapper did give screws. It was one of the 1st things that got stealth nerfed.
---
That sux as he's done it to multiple people oh well, ill continue my hate campaign on xbox then :)
---
&gt;I was expecting FO4 with some light MMO gameplay elements
---
As soon as they removed NPCs (essentially), the FO experience I knew and loved was gone.
---
Using the mod: [RatMonkeys Easy Sorting and Tagging](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/55)
---
Apart from sorting tags for your inventory to make life easier, this mod reveals all the scrap parts you can get from an item, before you pick it up.
---
They have already effectively taken away perks that took work to obtain by nerfing them. Once they opened that box it created a lot of issues with the perk system and this is one of them.
---
With legendary respecs coming eventually I dont see the problem with implementing this now.
---
What age do you think is too young?  I think 5 is a little too young myself but I don't have a problem with some of the preteens playing as long as their parent are aware and know what the game contains.  I guess it comes down to maturity level and what the parent feels is right for their child.  Only the parent really knows what a kid can handle and what they can't which is why I said up front that this is not a problem for Bethesda or xBox to solve or address.   But 5 years old?  Come on, that's kindergartners.  Do you really think kindergartners should be in the game?
---
Game ratings are a guide for parents to make an informed decision, and to be quite honest I stopped paying attention to ratings on purchasable media when Tipper Gore tried to force that junk down our throats for music.  But I know when my girls were young I would watch and pay attention to what they were doing before I would allow them to play by themselves.  
---
honestly thought player vending was one of the main selling points of the game pre-beta ? Shame it wasn't released with it, huge oversight for them.
---
A lot of people focus too much on coming up with a solution instead of really thinking through what the problem really is.
---
No dice, the x's lay just as funky as the rest of them.
---
That is a fair complaint. I still find the Fallout experience in audio logs, notes, computer documents, etc. Would I prefer if there were more NPCs? Yes. Does the fact that there are fewer ruin the game for me personally? No. It is a  little disappointing, though. Maybe with the coming expansions we will get more.
---
The base near glass cavern regularly spawns t60 parts. That's where I've gotten most of my set.
---
Where on the map is that?
---
I never use bags or containers to transfer.  Everything is done using the trading mechanism in the game.  For CAPS, I just sell a bobby pin to my alt or vice versa.  It's a pain, but the only way to assure none of my goods will disappear in the floor, etc.
---
That’s amazing
---
Yës
---
They mentioned that it will be customizable. My bet is that you can pick a workbench and it will function as a portable workbench.
---
Just sell a bobby pin or something for the amount of caps you want to transfer to your alt or back to your main.
---
Isn’t royal jelly a specific honey meant for hive queens?
---
What plätform
---
I feel like Sneaky Stealth Snipers had to nerf themselves by going bloody/Unyielding ;)
---
Basically any item that requires a screw to make, you in return gain 1 screw on dissemble. Or 1 of each item that it costs to make.
---
Crud. Wish I had seen that
---
You ever open a toolbox and see all these different screw driving attachments now imagine a more paranoid Fallout universe with unchecked scientific development and see all the limitless possibilities of being completely screwed over in your pursuit of screws.
---
Get naked and crouch. Universal at this point.
---
Iv seen people just strip naked and crouch down at the clubhouse. 
---
Am I the only spazzola that has difficulty climbing the spiral stairs?
---
Far southeast corner near site prime. 
---
Whoosh.  :)
---
In the churches? No way. Those things are evil. Always faceplanting into the wall.
---
And I would probably be ok with that, but there is a chance they could simply "cut and paste" the current method of loot drop and I would be a sad monkey if that happened.
---
Realized I'm being super negative without the current trend of offering a solution (thank-you Never-a-true-nerd) My preferred option would be have the Legendary Vendor as a vendor, (with 200 caps), with a "work bench" where you can scrap Legionaries for weapon mods and scrap, and finally as quest giver, trade in legendary loot for the location of a  3\* legendary. 
---
 I believe I have found 2 now, in 160 combined levels.
---
I mean...does it look like a bug? 
---
Mostly joking, sort of not.
---
I know not all bugs are insects and that scorpions and ticks are arachnids, but I’m pretty sure all bugs in fallout fall under “insect” although if biological classification factored in than mirelurks would technically be evolutionarily closer to the “insect” creatures than “animals.” But I doubt the devs cared about being taxonomically accurate in their perks for fictional monsters
---
my 5 year old logs in and tries to climb mountains. then she gets bored and builds in minecraft. so it's a non issue. 
---
I agree with everything you said, completely. my 8 year old "plays" which usually means he and his friend (same age) log in and run around exploring together. they don't play long and usually go play something else they like better. my older teen had no desire for this type of game and my adult son played for all of about 5 minutes.
---
the point I'm trying to make all along is that parents should be responsible and know what's going on and what their kids are playing. ALL online games have adult content based on what community could be hosting said games (like Minecraft) with incredibly adult content out there so my younger kids (anyone under 16) is supervised and monitored. there is no voice chat with strangers ever. so that means no chat on fallout. and no teaming up with strangers.
---
I know we played very violent and gorey games as kids (mortal Kombat was pretty gross, and comically so for me anyway) and listened to "troubled" music and we are fine, without adults breathing down our necks.  I find limiting stuff only builds rebellion so I'm realistic - this, when monitored, is an acceptable game for my kids to play in the very short doses they play within those confines of no chat, no strangers etc. there are online Minecraft games flat out banned so it's on a case by case basis. I just pay attention and do what parents should do.
---
other fallout games and other games similarly dark and bleak with very linear story driven quests are NOT appropriate pre teen IMO. this game is an exception for the hard to come across quests that my kids don't really do. if that makes sense?
---
It’s a random,  I had it by the tracks by white springs 
---
Thank you so much! I went there and I found both level 50 legs!
---
So is building a fusion generator...
---
Or let OP do the mission at level 50 so he gets the level 50 version and still have a versino to use to level 
---
Thanks Bill Nye for that easy to understand, but sciencey explanation!  
---
Updoot.
---
Omg same bröther
---
I've had far more crashes with 76 than with anthem personally
---
Need this service on PS4 
---
RemindME! 6 days
---
!remindme 6 days
---
Would love to see some customizable mods for the Powder Weapons as well. Also plz bring back the Paddle Ball mods! I love the paddle ball...
---
Haha, that öne happened to me except it was 3 scorchbeasts and a möthman
---
Those empty cans make for good lead scrap, y'know...
---
Dangit! Whooshed!
---
Seen a few of these posts.  It's so funny to see people lying to themselves in an attempt to eek out some sort of 'goodness' from the game.  But hey, it it's working for you.  I say go for it.
---
It may not fit your plan, but supposedly arranging the letters vertically rather than horizontally is a workaround for this.
---
Same. And since you can't hide from Bethesda I know they haven't been sneaking on. 
---
The dart gun in fallout 3 was super OP. I loved crippling legs of things and dragging whole herds of slow monsters behind me.
---
There are 3 really easy to reach spawn points in Watoga.  The downed vertibird, the top of the civic center and top of the medical building, plus a fourth inside the transit hub that requires lock picking or hacking.  Just hop a few times and you have a full set.
---
Yës, bëautiful
---
Dude can you not fucking read? 
---
I’ve already said that i agree with that two times. I’m saying don’t *remove PvP from the general mode when PvP servers come out.*
---
You at work sir?
---
The tinker bench actually is a reloading area. We just cant reload. Just make fresh ammo.. which hurts my brain. 
---
Once we start separating ammo into brass primers powder and bullets.. 
---
Yeah.. then yer gonna see some shit. 
---
Maybe we could get öne extra every fïve levels
---
But if I hadn't preordered I wouldn't have gotten to have fun for a week. 
---
I dont underatand how we can find radios all over the map yet can never bring one home. I even bought the plans for the console and tried hooking them together. Nope. I could understand if it was filled with mods and custom music like Fallout 4, but we need to be able to choose between the few stations we have.
---
ESPECIALLY WHEN JUKE BOXES PLAY ACTUAL MUSIC ELSEWHERE!!
---
I've found that gold is a good medium for player trades.
---
I agree, if you're pitching your CAMPs mainly to extract resources, keep it flexible (i.e. one foundation).
---
No you see, if you are a man you are a creep for talking to her. Since ofc you somehow had the mental powers to know it was a woman.
---
/s
---
Seriously, some people... it was just a player helping another random player. Keep up the kindness though, don't let assholes discourage you OP
---
I had my camp at that tower by 76 for a while so I could use the Jew's Harp there with other instruments. I've also seen washboards as part of the scenery- those should be playable, too!
---
you can get at lease 3 in white springs while killing ghouls and if your server hoping its easy to get a nice stack.  They are in the strip of shops to the north and the building next to the parking lot that has about \~8 ghouls.  
---
Maybe they should get a partnership with IKEA?
---
Kinda makes you want to blow up their wntire base.
---
They should add a L A Z E R  S H O T G U N. That would be an epic weapon
---
They understand the only thing keeping players playing is the hunt for screws, and because hunting for screws breaks all of your gear it requires you find more screws after using the ones you just found in repairs/crafting.
---
I stopped playing about a month ago because I realized the only reason I got online was to get that days caps and hunt for garbage on the ground. 
---
Word
---
I know what I’m trying later. I’m so tired of fixing my plats...
---
Most of my screws are used up by building and scrapping weapons to learn mods on the rare weapons (lever, gause, handmade). 
---
Been nearly 3 weeks for me. I've heard nothing back in a couple weeks. I expect this last months based on people who got banned in other waves. Regardless of innocence or not they don't seem to care about us.
---
What the hell
---
Nice!  Just checked out the image but this is solid IMO.
---
A few notes:
---
Is there a reason you’ve used different words for the up and down actions?
---
Could there be signifiers that there’s more to see if you scroll?
---
Most actions are labeled with buttons, why not fast travel?  Conversely, It’s a little ambiguous what happens when I press A.  Might it buy the item I have selected?
---
Hope this helps!
---
This is where a strike is almost mandatory. 
---
I just bought it today, knowing absolutely nothing other than the insane criticism the game has garnered, and the 6 hours I spent walking around exploring were some of the most peaceful and immersive moments I've had while gaming
---
So you are the person that blocking the line. I am sorry to say this but well done kitty. This person deserve this. 
---
Joke aside please don’t research while trading with the bot. Do it while you are not trading with the not. So people don’t have to wait for you. 
---
That’s nice, on PS4 I have to log out before I could log in as my alt, so my main and may alt can never meet each other face to face lol 
---
Aluminum is useful throughout the game - it's often a repair or build element for a bunch of weapons and armor, along with items you can craft. Likewise, pretty much every good ammunition type requires lead. There are plenty of other sources for both, along with perks that can reduce your need for either, but they're both materials that are always nice to have. 
---
Silver and gold, I haven't found as much use for, but they are useful for selling to vendors. They don't bulk, but you can sell them individually for (I believe) 1 to 3 caps per unit, depending on how much Charisma and what perk level of Hard Bargain you have. For silver, gold, fiber optics, and a couple other things that don't bulk, I basically sell any number over 100 that I get. (Even that's probably too much for most of them.)
---
Where a u?
---
Those plans have been MIA since the last big patch.
---
Well only if you equip perks that grant limb damage, I use the one for shotguns, you can slow enemies to a slow walk or even leave them crawling on the ground, then finish them with Melee if you want.
---
Although I really think a shotgun to the face should kill most anything making shooting legs a waste, but it is what it is in this game, and at the very least adds some variety to fights. You can do a hip fire spray at a croud of ghouls and leave a couple stumbling or crawling so you can focus on  fighting the rest for example. Then go finish the mamed ones.
---
It’s a game filled with murder and animals getting absolutely destroyed. I don’t think FO cares one bit. 
---
You know what? If I didn't just find out how good they can be I would give it to you. If I ever find another one I'll let you know.
---
Depends on the mutation and how you play 
---
Solid statement. Shame all Bethesda heard was Nerf the deathclaw gauntlet. Lol
---
2 + 2 = 
---
What are you looking for I have a full set of sentinel  assassin  marine I'd trade
---
 You did what I saw there. 
---
Cranberries require a bog.  Brain fungus needs a wall.  Blood leaves and snap tails only grow in water.  Bleached dogwood requires a dogwood tree.  I think the plants listed here should only be able to be planted when your CAMP is in the right area.  That of course will push too many people to the sane areas though.
---
Silt beans are found growing in beds and greenhouses in some towns there is no reason why we shouldn’t be able to cultivate them. 
---
I pick up everything and scrap it...everything. I wish you got screws for scraping guns, though. 👍
---
My thing is, screws should b a hell of a lot more plentiful when scrapping certain items; all toys, lamps, EVERY piece of a Giddy-up Buttercup, ANY pipe gun usually has 2 in its model (iron sight and trigger)...there’s plenty of items that could provide screws that don’t.
---
Some people are just insecure.
---
I'm really sorry dude. My moms godmother died today so I was at her funeral. I'm gonna need to pass unless you can do 7 days from now. I'm out of town for something until then.
---
While I am tired of the radio I'm grateful for being introduced to the genius that is Tennessee ernie ford. Dont think dark as a dungeon or 16 tons will ever get old for me.
---
I'm lvl 59 and I run out of screws on a regular basis. Because EVERYTHING needs screws.
---
Double checked and don't have that equipped.
---
PETA would actually approve of that 'joke' though.
---
That relationship is doomed.  Don’t let it get to you, you did the right thing.
---
Now you know to be prepared for subsequent attacks.
---
Knowledge is power!
---
That would be a workshop worth fighting for. First you get the screws, then you get the power, then you get the women.
---
I've been scrapping the marine chest piece. So far I've gotten the brawling and hardened mod. But they dont show up when i try to modify them. Only welded, standard, ultra light and pocketed are showing up.
---
I'd be happy if I could just scrap it to make other ammo, even if the rate was terrible it would be better than just dropping it.
---
Munitions factory’s relationships never do last. I say sanitize with a launch from bravo
---
Hey if you’re on pc I’ll help you do now
---
Hey it’s been a while since i last played, but i believe that scrapping any piece of armor can give you those upgrade for another piece of armor (i.e if you scrap a chest and get the hardened mod, you may have gotten it for the legs or arms instead) try checking the other pieces because I believe this has happened to me too. 
---
It literally took me almost all of them to get marsupial. I wish I could get rid of the empathy and herd mentality because I can never find anyone to play with. When I do, my special is off the charts. So I'm always running negative on my stats it seems. Im gonna scrap and start all over. They sell them cheap enough these days for 100 caps. So unless you play with a team, stay away from those two. Egg head and bird bones I could also do without. 
---
Seriously, people can be endgame grinding and not know what junk items break down into the things they need?  This may be a bit snarky, but screws are abundant in literally *every* location if you know what you're looking for.  Maybe it's because I have a zillion hours in FO4 but from the moment I walked out of 76 that was never something I had a shortage of.  They're great to sell too with day tripper and grape mentats for any low charisma characters like me. 
---
I usually use the overseers caches. Or a random place at a train station.. lunch box, suitcase.. etc. 
---
Agreed. I'm over lvl 100, and keep getting duplicates from card packs. Have multiple cards maxed out that are duplicates.
---
Well I got the crossbow. 3 star quad with 50percent critical damage and plus 1 perception. Now I just need the outfit. I was gonna go with preacher vestments. Lol
---
would be true if only desk fans gave screws
---
Way to young
---
My 7yo loves to watch me play, he has even spotted things that I have missed, and helped me build my CAMP. The only time I let him pick up the controller is to let him wander around my CAMP, while I have to duck off for a minute. Now this kid is a crack shot on battlefront which I am more than happy to let him play. And very articulate at minecraft, but I don't believe he has it in him to manage the game, for starters the inventory Knowing what he really needs with junk, ammo, weapons etc.. 
---
So yes OP, 5 is way to young to even grasp the mechanics of the game let alone the story and then the graphic content and especially chat. I will teach my son soon he will be turning 8 shortly, but under supervision. 
---
I’m just drinking irradiated water and taking them as they come randomly. 
---
Whoosh
---
Thanks for the update.  Saved me from server hoping. 
---
I want infrared or night vision
---
Nope.  Starched genes 2, rock em!
---
BOS plans have been out of the gam since patch 5 (or was it 6?). They haven’t been in rotation at the vendors nor dropping from events.
---
It sucks I got the plans for BOS arms, legs but not torso. Btw the same plan works on light, sturdy, and heavy variants.
---
If you’ re on pc I can craft the legs and arms for you. I have a friend to the chest for me. 
---
I think binoculars should be a craft requirement for putting into scope on the handmade.  Of course they could give us a mod options to make them into a hand held recon scope independent of a weapon.  That would give melee characters a recon option without having to carry a rifle.  That opens up the Distant Thunder event quite a bit.
---
Ah, a Big Bang Theory fan
---
Yeah, they fit nice that way, which is weird to me.
---
am using legendary ones so cant answer your question tbh
---
with weapon artisan lv3, my automatic laser rifle can last ~1200 rounds (still breaks too fast though..)
---
I've come to believe that this was added in at some point in development to give them an "out" essentially. A lore excuse to completely change and/or re-structure the game. Or to take it places narratively that make no sense with the rest of the fallout timeline.
---
Like in a future patch, we could see the simulation break down (cough, much like the actual game, cough), but then the simulation aspect turn into something completely different. Like everyone at the same time, across timezones and servers are randomly teleported to a strange place. Like the memory den chairs, or I dunno, the moon. "Simulation concluded, you are now clear to leave the vault". How effing crazy (lazy?) would that be?
---
And suddenly, all game issues are fixed, there are NPC's, dialogue options, etc. (not that I had an issue with that specifically, but it'd be kinda neat!). It'd be the one of the biggest twists in gaming history if it 180'd into a popular title!
---
I’ve been kinda wondering the same thing. Especially with the posts on this sub talking about under age people. This is not a game I would want a younger kid playing. 
---
You need to wait til the game fully loads or suffer the consequences of being frozen. If found if I just wait, all is well in the world until the game freezes again or the Xbox just shuts off while farming white springs. 
---
Did you hear about the overachiever who died giving blood? She gave 110%.
---
Yeah I don't lock pick anything anymore because I have to don't only go through all the effort but has have to here that frickin level up sound. 
---
Bloodied Melee build with adrenal same issue. She will turn around and focus me all the time although theres many players in power armor trying to ‘tank’ her.
---
So basically insects are anything without fur or human like, like scorch, mole miner, mutant etc.
---
Animals are everything else besides scorchbeast  guessing?
---
Came to say this, glad I am not the only one to notice.
---
I feel your pain.
---
Scrapper needs two levels.
---
First one give you a chance all extra scrap from weapons and level two can give things like oil, screws, springs and all the little tiny junk.
---
This is what got me thinking about it. Im not a fan of scopes in general. Just use dot scopes on my rifles because normal scopes block out too much going on around me. But just for distant thunder events I started carrying a light pistol with a recon scope just for those events. If binoculars come in at 1lb vs 3lb for the gun, Id like to save 2lbs if I could. 
---
Good point lmao
---
Heavy weapons stagger with Perks too.
---
I'd say that we need a perk called: Emergency Shelter.
---
A single level unlocks at high to mid levels.
---
You can build basic supplies and crafting stations.
---
(The resources needed are higher can only use the items a set number of times before they break. 
---
I’ve had to start over a few times to get marsupial, and no really bad ones like herd mentality or the one that reduces gun accuracy. I use the emmet waste site because you can stand next to the barrels for the quick rad bath and if you dont get a mutation, only 1/4 chance I think, you can use the deacon shower to get de-rad —saves on Radaways. 
---
And if you get a bad mutation the shower will zero it out. 
---
Just make sure you put starched back in before cleaning up.
---
Also, you can only get one mutation per session. So if you get a mutation, and keep it or don’t, you’ll need to server hop to try again. 
---
I left the game once I got tired of an average of two disconnects every session (and once the Resident Evil 2 Remake was released), but I recently started playing again and the game is in MUCH better shape. This game had a high update curve, but it's working pretty well now.
---
Well, legendary pipe pistols can spawn and those can be modified into rifles. Just an FYI.
---
And a resounding "yes" to the rest. Have my upvote.
---
Right!??????
---
Go to Emmit Mountain Disposal Site. In the mine there is enough rads to get a mutation and a rad shower to clear your rads for free. Easiest way to farm mutations. 
---
Sent you my info. 
---
And thank you! 
---
Username, sir? I'll pay you a visit.
---
Add me, too - Steeltownerick
---
I got over a thousand if anyone on ps4 wants some. 
---
It would only be viable in pvp, and when you get above level 95 nothing will ever be a higher than you other than other players giving people an obvious disadvantage for being a high level.   
---
It just wouldn't work. But Giant Slayer as in Increased x amount of damage when fighting boss monsters like Scorchbeasts, SBQ, Behemoths, Deathclaws and etc. would be a great concept for the effect. 
---

---
I'll pay you a cap to SHUT THE FK UP!!!, I can seriously hear the promotional scream as I read this, complete with voice tone changes, thanks a lot dude PMSL
---
Oops, pipe revolvers*
---
Nah, unless you have empath  
---
# 😔
---
Ballistic fiber is torturing me.
---
I like the idea but I can see it become way too OP quickly.
---
How's this: Giant Slayer.
---
When fighting enemy mob that is 25/30/35 levels above yours. You have a chance to fire a rock with a slingshot that can deal massive damage to the target and inflict cripple or reduce the targets damage by 60%.
---
The chance is based on the lower your Luck is.
---
In Xbox1 as well. GT: GardenZombie.
---
It was the workshop. All the player needs is a team mate to challenge the workshop and you're fair game.
---
I don't understand why they aren't/weren't part of either game from the start. Realistically, pipe shotguns are magnitudes easier and more efficient to make than a pipe pistol or rifle when you consider you don't have to factor in rifling the barrel or even necessarily a perfectly straight barrel at all. Yet another missed opportunity.
---
Your's does *shit*? Lucky!  Mine only does jack.
---
That's awesome. Pretty rare to find two at the same time.
---
Toy factory workshop!
---
Do you have marsupial and speed demon? If so, looking to buy two of each.
---
I take frequent breaks and it helps.
---
I wish you could use the accordian wherever, and it wasn’t just junk
---
My go to rule is: if it has four or two "legs" its animal.
---
And more than four its insect. 
---
At least thats how i go about it.
---
Speaking is a Fog Crawler an animal or mirelurk, being a shrimp of sorts?
---
If I’m not mistaken the weapons workbench has a lathe, probably the most versatile machine tool every created. With the right raw materials you could use a lathe to make the tools and parts needed to make another lathe. 
---
But the precision needed to make a box of machine screws with tolerances measured in thousands of an inch (or micrometers...) That’s a tricky one. Precision is one of those modern miracles we take for granted but is essential for our technology. 
---
So I’m on the fence. Maybe an advanced workbench to make it fit properly, or advanced workbenches at one of the bases. 
---
If you haven't realized by now that was a joke, they did stream when they said they were going too and there wasn't any scorchbeast lol.
---
Yes I do Ima be home in a hour psn ? 
---
Like others are saying, better than how the sub was for a long time. It's clear that Bethesda is trying to listen to people here, but we're not doing ourselves any favors by not having active stickies. Imagine being one of those poor fucks who has to sift through the entire subreddit looking for legit suggestions and bug reporting? God forbid we have a couple weekly threads to help guarantee your topic doesn't get buried by 50 bethplz posts without being acknowledged
---
If you are going to ask, you should specify the issue as well.  This is wicked vague.
---

---
If you scrap something with screws there isn’t a logical real world reason why you shouldn’t recover every screw in that item, so any limit on the screws required to make an item vs. screws obtained scraping the item is dubious. 
---
It’s not like my corn, mutfruit, tato, and water based adhesive is on par with Locktite. :)
---
Give everyone a non-tradeable You're Special book and grant a single Special point. While not that big of a deal one point can help.
---
lol :)
---
100% agree. I want this so much!!!
---
Give us planter boxes but make the plants take longer to grow and have chance at giving an extra crop. &amp; require you to water it with purified water.
---
And once we have the scews, for the love of God, can we please bulk them...
---
The door won’t open even when you punch the key code. Also, you can’t open it from the other side. 
---
You had me in the first half not gonna lie😂 great post
---
They don’t think it be like it is but it do. 
---
Yes but you always get vents when killing the queen
---
How do you guys feel about adding a fellow vault dweller from Louisville? I'm usually on nights and definitely need some people to team up with!
---
It's not the damage that makes them so nice. The gun can be modded auto or semi with a 35 bullet mag.
---
What?
---
Thats what do. My laser rifle lasts a really good time. I started using it to ease up on my .45's while working in Watoga. I have to repair it roughly twice a day.
---
Why don't we start using screws as currency, who needs caps, I'll trade screws from now on.
---
I wish we could send that person a message and let them know it’s a game where we help others. 
---
THANK YOU! I thought I was the only one irritated that I’d always have like 2k steel and only 15 screws. Almost everything I scrap should contain them since most things aren’t without screws, anyway, so even if they did that I’d be happy. 
---
My word. Simply incredible.
---
There was a change in the patch. If your anywhere on the workshops property, another player can contest by shooting you from anywhere on the workshops property. You don't have to go to the bench now.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/8irVM62
---
Yeah that was changed early on. Now its governed by rifle perks.
---
Reminds me of the message board you can find on one of the terminals in AMS
---
I wish we could warn others that, I, timmy30274, has been ripping people off or whatever. 
---
But if we can’t warn others that I’m a cheat or a ripoff or whatever, then basically, we gotta let others find out the hard way???
---
Note: I was using my own name as an example.  
---
I did not play the beta. I got it after the beta and stopped playing last month after all the freaking issues. 
---
I saw that one
---
I won't give away where (what fun is that!), but there are two spots in high level places where you can pick up 20-30 screws each in about two minutes. Piles of fans and typewriters. One is guarded by a quartet of snallygasters and the other a pile of high level supermutants. That's how I've accumulated enough screws that I plan to open my own shop when player vending comes around. It'll be called Big Richard's Screwing Palace and Corn Soup Emporium.
---
Yup, you must be too to pick that one :)
---
No clue, not sure how anyone can test this lol
---
Abbey's  bunker, there's a pond just due west. My camp's there (on the rock above the road north of the bunker where the crab lives.. I have a fence around him and a sign encouraging travelers to feed him), I know the  area like the back of my hand.   
---
The pond just due west has a Mirelurk queen, a king, 2-3 mirelurks, and 2 (maybe 3) egg clutches. Like in F4, collecting eggs from the clutches gets half of them to hatch into mirelurk spawn, the rest you can keep. I can rake in those eggs in any quantity (especially if you hop servers a bit), and so can you. 
---
That's unfortunate - I guess I'll have to be more careful when I've got workshops claimed. Thanks for clarifying!
---
It should show up the negative half after the serum wears off. The positive stat doesn’t show but is affective.
---
I have found a way [here(just the first min or  so)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vMoklmizEI&amp;feature=share), it only works with the "I" as a base letter though, and hard to place just right for the rest to stick. I also learned it only will extend the width of the section.
---
I think I got it up to 7 caps per dollar with my charismatic character ... 
---
I wasn't on the property of the workshop on subsequent respawns, but another comment clarified that if he had a teammate in the workshop, I'd be vulnerable anywhere on the map.
---
Are you on xbox? I have 75 ballistic fiber I could give ya. I was just about to drop 200 gears and 190 springs and various other junk. 
---
Oh damn that's pretty good!
---
You should get screws and springs every time you scrap a gun. I was surprised in 76 when I found out you didn't. You can't tell me all the gun pieces are held together by makeshift glue 
---
Yesss. I have an AA quick reload +50DR three star crossbow and it still needs... something. It needs perk card buffs. I'm pretty sure none apply to it (or am I wrong?). It's still not powerful enough to compete with my hunting rifle despite reloading faster.
---
&gt; The non-constructive whining, the "I'm quitting because x" posts.
---
You realize how important those posts are, right?  If so many players are quitting then there is probably a reason to be concerned.  Even I quit.  I just stick around the subreddit to see if any rebalances or fixes come out.  I don't even care about the new content coming out next week since it doesn't matter if so much of the game is still broken.
---
IMO food items in this game shouldn't even spoil. The stash limit is so low, that it will prevent people from stockpiling large quantities of good food even if the food never spoils.
---
You have to third person so you get the aiming dot. It's pretty much the only reasonable way to do it.
---
Shroud from twitch had the same reaction after he downed a guy in pvp. I's kind of a weird rule to stay in pvp after the fight is done. You can block him in the social tab though.
---
Switching in and out of pacifist is wonky too. Like if you're farming and a guy drops bombs on your base. By the time you switched, he already got away. The survival mode should be fun if they make it where you have to start a new character and current weapons are only used in adventure. Otherwise it's just going to be assassins cav sets playing god.
---
It's a good thought but screws are something I usually have alot of in the stash anyways. I run out of springs more often then screws. Maybe add springs to the craftable items along with screws. 
---
They’re held together with duct tape. Don’t *you* want to fire a gun made of 20+ year old duct tape, rusty metal, old and worn springs, and splintered wood? I mean, that sounds like a recipe for a *perfectly* safe vessel for launching miniature explosions from right next to your face, right?? 
---
lol, calm the hell down pretty sure you are all worked up over a simple conversation. Go take a shit or something to clear them pipes. I was simply adding to my initial point. But hey insults make you feel better. 
---
How would allowing players to sell their ammo negatively impact the economy when vendors have a fixed amount of caps every day?
---
It's a pain in the ass for sure, but just put ur head down and deal with it for a little bit. Ive had the game since launch, only get to play like 3 or 4 hours a night, and still haven't reached 50. I dont do a lot of the quests tho, just wander around and explore, lol, so I don't rack up too much xp. But as I get closer to 50 (45 now) it's been getting easier every time I log in.
---
I’ve **heard** folks say rifle perks apply... have you tried those?
---
Guild Wars had some of the best PVP of all time. I miss that game.
---
Yeah, illiteracy is a serious issue. It upsets me when I see people struggle with reading. 
---
Now I want to see there IRL reaction!
---
And accurate since most toys from the 1950s *did* have lead of some kind in or on them.
---
All of the ideas are good but three is meh. I think adding a progress bar to an even quest that you get went entering the zone is what is needed. You fill the bar by hurting the queen and killing the adds keeps the bar from dropping. if you keep the bar high your loot is better and if you have it too low you still get loot but not at good as the ones that  got it higher. 
---
This way the people that started the event are given a fair chance to earn their reward. &amp; people that showed late or dont do anything are only getting minimal loot.  
---
Tie mobs to every % of her health for a chance to keep your bar from going too low. 
---
The faster she's bursted the more mob spawn
---
Ive only owned the game for a almost two months now I've had only two times I've ever experienced another player attacking me. Once after I bought a two shot explosive pump shotgun from the White Springs train station for 200 caps (a level 140+ attacked me after I bought it) and another time I was repairing armor at my base as 4 dudes showed up destroying my base (which I just logged out). Other than that every experience has been good. I've received much help from all levels. Now I just reached level 101 and yes I get the boredom part and seeking PVP can reduce some of that boredom. 
---
As for being unfair to lower levels, well you can't expect to come out the vault with as much experience as higher levels. Life doesn't work that way. Just take your L's when it happens and move on. 
---
My keys to not being a Target at lower levels is keep your base small. No use in spending the resources if you can't protect/defend it. Also, get in the habit of stashing your junk often. Less of a reward for those that may attack you. 
---
If you don't want to engage in PVP, when attacked just log out. That really seems to piss them off. You'll have plenty of time unless you engage. 
---
Go into third person and you get an aiming dot that doesn't disappear.
---
Simple we bash the guns and armours on the table still stuff falls off. &amp; in the process screws and springs break and fall through the holes in the floor.
---
I get what you mean but I just didn't go into a ton of detail about it, it was a very quick thing, I wasn't taking like 30 seconds to research it. Like I looked away for 4 seconds max. And I made sure nobody was around first. I had a list on my phone I was checking against what I had while selling because you can't mark things for sale, etc, so I wanted to make sure I wasn't selling what I wanted to put up for trade somewhere.
---
Also hi gigaking :)
---
Yep I checked and I don't know how I missed that. I'll have to try it out again and see if the extra damage makes it any more viable.
---
Also found the Handmade Gun.... Vendor bot Wallace.  First time too, didn't need to server hop
---
Also, Dilbert doesn't know how to make his own Sunshine Oil. The recipe you get is drastically different from the recipe he has on his terminal.
---
Exactly. I've been buying up lower level All Rises when I see them at vendors to have on alts and give to friends before hitting 50.
---
Daaaammnnn. 75 Fiber. Thats like 8 full repairs for all my armor! 
---
Depends on who is asking and why lol
---
LMAO
---
Correct me if I’m wrong.
---
Doors once into power grid will open and close with keypad but not with switch , and when connected to a grid plus a terminal I will open and never close unless used the promo to turn off all in the terminal at this point all lights will be killed
---
THANK YOU
---
The best thing to do is switch worlds or sit and wait to see where they go. If they go to the location you need to be at, just chill and go after. 
---
Maybe they could make it cost an absurd amount of lots of things to make an upgraded Tinker workbench where you could make not only screws but some other shit too
---
How exactly are you making something that's not even out yet more efficient?
---
And they really left the game...
---
Agreed
---
This is a terrific, terrific idea. Absolutely why wouldn’t a person save all the valuable components from a tear down? Hardware components are even collected from deathclaws for fuck sakes.
---
And I agree so much with the OP. My questing momentum always goes like this: 1)run a couple legs of the quest, 2)get tuned up by the mobs, 3)take a several day break from questing to loot the same old shit with a 1 in 5 chance that someone didn’t beat me to it.
---
IGN: zilch3raven
---
Well thought out. I like it. 
---
If it spits out canned coffee I'm down. Also anything to do with my comrades to the east is great!
---
I find them ok mostly for lore reasons. but maybe makes some piles of ash we can search for caps or junk and have them disappear from the world.
---
It’s an event ( forgot the name ) close to a mine , description of the event said breach and get goods before mine collapses or something along those lines 
---
Good luck man.
---
My version of that is a nice fat stack of red solo cups that I can’t convert to plastic. Or traffic cones and wet floor signs.
---
85 bullets with the drum mag
---
That's what I was wondering when I read about the backpack. I wonder if gives you more carry weight. I think it's the brotherhood field scribe outfit that has the backpacks attached - that one should give you extra carry weight now. If your carrying extra bags, you should get extra carry weight. 
---
Thumbs up then, thanks!
---
Dang I just saw your video. I would’ve hit each creature at least once then retreated inside the office and let them kill each other
---
Left a comment on your Twitter Tim_sanford1981
---
if anything they need to get rid of the burnt books and magazines they are completly useless and have to put a drain on the server
---
or where a blunderbuss or hedge clippers are even in the same ball park
---
I’m hearing impaired and want that.  
---
But, a few days ago, I was in a group. I message instead of talking. 
---
After my brother told me someone speaking to me, I spoke up. 
---
Brother explained I’m hearing impaired
---
Everyone immediately disconnected from me. 
---
Lol
---
Really? So do you think it will give you extra carry weight?
---
I love this game. I find myself wandering around looking at everything finding out as much as I can about what happened to all of the people that lived in it.
---
If you play it for what it is you're bound to get lost in it. 
---
Imagine it's not a f/o game....it would be a great game if it another title. 
---
But do you have any *Barbed Walking Cane mod* though?
---
Just outside the north wall of the Whitesprings is a good spot for silt beans IIRC.
---
I second that. "What"
---
Watch this be on the gaming review sites.
---
Pepperthyme84. 
---
What i usually do is sell a piece of junk for how much the person wanrs to buy and sell the actual ammo for free, its easy ive done it twice!
---
“Pay the author”. Yah okay. How’d that work out for the (known) plan/recipe tag? Lol
---
'Talk is cheap, said no lawyer ever.' I like this one, and no, it's not disturbing.
---
I too ran into this particular issue, the whole (higher level people spawn higher level enemies) conundrum seems like the kind of oversight in need of a 'one-tamriel' style redesign. Or at least reimagining. 
---
If you decide to stick with it my best advice would be to start server hopping. It's less than ideal but remember, you just have to be the first one in the area. 
---
Oh and just stay away from Whitesprings. I'm the unlikely scenario that you find it uninhabited you'll just find out that regardless of it's temperate surroundings the golf course is a special kind a hell all in itself. 
---
Under challenges there are player challenges that show you’ve played xxx/xxx many hours 
---
No, it just makes the item last longer before it breaks.
---
Part of that is the lame damage being done making you have to mag dump into some things heads.
---
I've said this before, but I think everything should do more damage and be less tanky. I'd rather fight hordes of enemies that go down easy but can also take me out quickly, than large tanky creatures that just take multiple magazines and can't hurt me faster than a stimpack can top me back up.
---
As a PS4 player I'm thinking they're PC and Steam is tracking the hours for them.
---
press options then press L1 if your on ps4 or the equvilint once in that menu go to challenges and look at characater and the first option should say explore appalachia for... 
---
Ah yes thank you for the insightful discussion 
---
That doesn’t fix the problem though..
---
How about a micro transaction for screws instead? Pack of 1000 for a tenner? 
---
I read the “Negan” in the Drake and Josh “Megan!” voice.
---
That style is a thing. BUT you have to be in PA to be able to get anyplace. I die right away unless I jump in  a suit.
---
Got a 3* if you want it
---
Wow that's pretty solid system you've created. I like that you have the ability to see the stats of the item. If it's legendary, being able to see the add-ons would be helpful too. Right now, even when trading, you cant tell what they are. The person has to leave the trade, check, and re-initiate the trade. Being able to see what the player has available for trade in the map would also save thousands of caps in the long run; as your not running around Appalachia, trying to figure out who has what. It streamlines your purchase time, allowing you to get what you need and spend more time using them then looking for them. 
---
They should hire you. 
---
War... war never changes.
---
TBH why did we even need boiled water in the first place. I think adding toxic water was enough. It should be that all water taken from the wild is toxic and boiling it makes it dirty water (boiling doesn't clean particulates or radiation out), and finally purifying it makes it perfectly safe. The should have just made all cooked recipes (ones that use wood) use dirty water and any others use purified.
---
We need power creep so bad though, this might be the first time I've ever said that about a game. In Fallout 4 I think it was called survival mode, where the enemies dealt 250% damage and the player did %200, and stimpacks were much slower, I really miss that.
---
I went back and did the unmarked "quest" to check out Lucky Hole Mine tonight. I haven't really been playing because my friends bounced to play BF:V, but man when we were all playing...This really summed it up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IcqE8kT3KA. They are all coming back for the next content update and I can't fucking wait.
---
&gt; But the precision needed to make a box of machine screws with tolerances measured in thousands of an inch (or micrometers...) That’s a tricky one.
---
I’m literally pulling the screws out of a children’s toy.  I don’t think precision is an issue.
---
Well there are 2 things you can do:
---
1. Ask Bethesda to allow you to sell it to vendor bots for pitiful caps or deconstruct it for pitiful amounts of materials.  BOO HISSS!  Nobody wants this!
---
2. Go to FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits and get TONS OF CAPS selling the ammo to other players like yourself.  You can even buy ammo there if you need it!
---
Don't feed the greedy vendor bots!  Sell that ammo to real players and keep those caps in the community!
---
Pipboy chat is better.
---
You spelled it wrong. His name is thrEEE dOwWwWG.
---
His reviews are criticizing the games when they were first released, and if you review whatever he said to what the game states were you would see that what he said was right. 
---
Yeah I dont even repair PA anymore. There are enough spots to find it why even waste the scrap?
---
I have an explosive tesla gun... just as bad lol
---
Wow. You were right. The weights are definitely inaccurate. I bulked everything and despite the weights suggested I dropped 20lbs in my stash after I stored all my bulk. Maybe because I used so much plastic but I didn't care. Plastic is easy to get. 
---
Also has little to no recoil 
---
game is on the bethesda launcher, not steam.
---
I think it would a great way to add a new faction
---
It's a dumb perk card. They will be killed or die before you know it. 
---
Ouch... And another one bites the dust. Sorry for your loss. 
---
yea but even a casual player can easily scrap excessive amount of screws. Desk fans are everywhere. 
---
Run happens to me all the time except they take the workshop and leave just to be dicks 
---
I'd love a channel that plays the tapes at random
---
I've never understood the purpose of these in any fallout. The only thing that I could possibly even think of is the burnt book sometimes can be confused for an overdue book, but even then it's just there to piss you off. 
---
So annoying, how does someone get to be level 250 anyway? And we never shot him back!
---
At max sniper build I can shoot down SQ in about 5-6 shots from my bloodied lever action without ever being seen. If I catch them coming out of a fissure they're usually dead shortly after taking flight. I don't consider it cheap and doesn't feel immersion breaking. People say farming them are just a waste of resources, but I suspect that sentiment comes from melee players that tank them until they land and get their armor chewed up quickly. When I'm running heavy weapons/pa it's certainly more expensive on my resources.
---
Yes they would have survived, but frames would have ran out of power in the cores. I think the frames would have been picked clean. So the armor bits would have been taken, and later on the frames would have been picked up by raiders. Then build to fit with the waste.
---
I’m 101 and it’s annoying when I die because I lose 101 caps they do it because thy get a lot of caps was talking with someone today and he made 10k in a day just server hoping killing people going after mainly 100+ player 
---
Sad 😐
---
Yes.
---
Resource deposit*
---
I think it’s pretty dumb tbh
---
Right now I just run the raider helmet, and what what ever other bits of armor I find that has a dull rust look.
---
I like it. Players should be able to set up an old dial up style BBS on their terminals. 
---
Need to be wise my friend.
---
Whenever you see a guy come into your workshop always be ready to engage never ever let your guard down.
---
It's most people's way of initiating PvP as you don't need the other players to shoot u back.
---
Because you took a workshop it's essentially like shooting every player on the server and anyone can come back at anytime and just claim workshop and shoot you down.
---
Starfield, eso 6 to name two massive projects. You have no actual source, so unless you do it’s safe to assume they are sticking to common practice for game and any software studio and reassigning a majority of the dev team after launch.
---
Also, only a fucking moron sources Wikipedia.
---
&gt; Increasing the defense budget for the seller’s C.A.M.P. will allow greater protection against griefers and discourage destructive or toxic behavior. 
---
As someone that spends all their time taking workshops, I'll tell you turrets don't stop me at all. Turret AI is a meme. 
---
Oh see I didn't know that! I thought you still had to shoot back. Thanks. This was the first time we have ever taken over a workshop, and several level 100s dropped by simply saying hi then leaving.
---
This, I understand that Bethesda were forced to rush FO76 out the door after it was leaked too early, and I'm trying to not force too much work/make my requests reasonable. Hence why I'm just asking them to import the CC pipe-shotguns instead of my ideal.
---
Ideally, the Pipe-Shotgun would be based on a 12-guage (4-winds) slam-fire shotgun. They are so fucking easy to make IRL, and If they could make firing animations for flint-lock pistols, a slam-fire shotgun shouldn't be a problem.

Just a screw, and a few pipe pieces is all it takes to make a single barrel. Or just roll a flat bit of steel around a shotgun shell as a inner-pipe, and have an outer-pipe with a screw as a firing pin/outer-barrel. Maybe make it 3x steel, a screw and some adhesive.) and then you can add optional stock for 1 wood (a 2x4), 2 cloth (string) and 2x adhesive (one wonder-glue packet).
---
Add threading onto the end, cut the pipe edge into 8, and screw on a round aluminum ring, and you now have a choke! 
---
The cheapness to make is offset by the poor durability, unless you have full licensed plumber perk tree.
---
Also make it take as long as a flint-lock pistol to reload because the shells have a nasty habit of sticking.
---
That said, the Pipe-shotguns from Fallout 4 are good too!
---
They have springs, not screws. 
---
Oh come on, every female Fallout character is played by a man. Everyone knows that.
---
I refuse to do it anymore. But one hit White Springs last night. First time in two weeks. I suit up and start my run. The loot was amazing during the first couple chalet buildings. As we got to the last group of buildings my game froze. Of course I was solo because the three fellas I was with didn't want to team up. 
---
End note: I did get two three star weapons and multiple armors despite not seeing a single * legendary enemy. Never has the loot been that good. Wish I could have made it to the golf course that time. 
---
Wow I feel sorry for you to have to make this kind of joke my man.
---
A certain community manager.  Come on we know who u meant and that's unfair on that person you can't make quips about that sort of shit and expect people to go oh yeh he was just joking.
---
No that has meaning behind it and it's not right man, I love the community managers and wouldn't stoop to joke about sexual innuendo about them.
---
Sorry for rant but these guys help the game alot by providing feedback we give them, cut some slack and let them work 😊
---
This. This is the easiest way to earn screws. 
---
I too wouldn't want it to be 1:1,I think it should be trade in two and get a random card, or trade in four and pick a card yourself. 
---
Well, on Xbox the game disconnects from the server less but now the game just freezes or shuts off the Xbox altogether. Happens several times during my play time from 4pm to around 11pm regularly. 
---
Lock and Load isn’t working with Harpoon gun. The reload is faster but then you can’t fire until after a while, it’s just silly. The animation got the effect but doesn’t help with firing rate. 
---
Super Duper doesn’t work any more after the latest patch. Sometimes when I craft 30 stable fluxes I only get one extra even when I equipped all three points of SuperDuper, it’s just frustrating. 
---
Handmade silenced best to have chameleon mutation or amour piece, run sneak perk and ninja and you'll be able to one or 2 shot alot of things especially if you have adrenaline perk too.
---
I prefer alopecia radio...all the best songs to go bald to.
---
It has been great up until this week.. I was just about to put a post up. I've been getting huge lag issues and disconnects, especially today.. 4 queen fights and every single one has DCd before she's down to half health.
---
Upvote for use of the word dingus.
---
Yeh most of them would be scoping you guys out. 
---
It sucks but it's the way of Appalachia lol. Just beware of you are in a team then whenever you go back to the workshop have one team mate travel away from you and they can come to the workshop from another direction.
---
He can be your eyes of you get back and people come to claim, you'll have at least one guy hiding outside the workshop ready to shoot the person who goes to claim the shop as soon as they start to claim it that guy and you can team him and kill him before he can react 
---
It’s IN GAME
---
Thanks for the tips! We'll be ready next time 🔫😎
---
It’s not even a fully-realized asshole. Probably more of a cringy, 12-year-old who totally hates being in the friend zone and is super threatened by any random person coming up and having any interaction with ‘his’ girl. 
---
Yes
---
As long as the game technology permits expanding our storage I am all for separate storage types and containers. Or, at the very least since our last, very appreciated stash size increase I would be more than willing to have 100lb or so chopped off of general storage for "dedicated" storage of special types. For instance, Magazine Racks that only display our stored magazines as contents, or refrigerators that only display food items. Indexed stashing for a bit of immersion if true separate containers are hard on the servers. However, something I think it is very important to realize about this game is that it is as much a test bed as a finished product. Bethesda told us as much publicly, and said the game would be an un-finished, evolving product before release.
---
That is a double-edged sword. On one hand, we get an ever-changing game as Bethesda's devs push the boundaries of what they can do with their technology and creativeness within it's bounds. We are getting a Fallout experience that is a working experiment, constantly in flux, and will stay fresh in a way a truly finished single player game just can't, which I find very exciting. A lot of people hate on the game, calling it an un-finished product, or some kind of rip-off because of it's incomplete, buggy, and unpolished release, but I think they fail to see it for what it is. It's a product that keeps on giving, FOR FREE (While I am sure they are simultaneously spending time and resources on new projects), and will provide years of enjoyment if the plan Bethesda has laid out for it's future comes to fruition. On the other hand, there will be things it just can't do because of the nature of online play, the limits of current tech (Mostly consoles, as we near the time of next-gen consoles, while PC's can do things they can't, yet all platforms must do the same things), and engine/server dating. I would be very interested to ask the devs what they think their technology and coding ingenuity is able to do, and if an idea we have as players might be possible/how before just demanding it be done. That's why I try to either be pretty sure a change is well within the reasonable abilities of the devs, their tech, and practical business time before I ask for it, or ask IF something could be done or suggest HOW something might reasonably be done before advocating for it.  :)
---
That's where I get mine. :)
---
I found it about an hour ago in the Watoga mayors office steamer trunk.  I'm sure it was a random drop, but worth looking into.
---
Yeah exactly my point, it's not like some revolutionary new feature, it's basic functionality in any online game, standard accessibility features Todd Howard hasn't seemed to ever heard of. I also usually turn on subtitles in any game as I may just be playing with sound quite low or off at times. 
---
I *like* seeing the various suggestions, and reading people riff on them in the comments. 
---
Bethesda, pls NO
---
I feel like the game does this to me as well, I have a ton of good loot then some op enemy kills me and camps my loot bag. But when I don't have incredible loot and bam they kill me and quickly move on
---
I don’t know the exact numbers of fo76 for berserker but if it’s anything like fo4 it something along these lines. 0dr gives 100% increase. Even 1dr drops it to 75% increase. Anything over 100dr drops it to 25% increase. I don’t know if the increase continues to drop as your damage resist goes over 100 but from what I can see the increase is pretty low. My mutations give me 50dr without armor so I can’t even consider using berserker weapons due to them registering my damage resist from my mutation. Wish they’d ignore that and only measure from armor items 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
The bos asylum in the bog, easy 50-100 aluminum 
---
Awesome I’ll check it out, thank you!
---
Power Patcher and Fix it Good are awesome once you start modding power armor.
---
Go robot hunting is usually my go to when I run out, especially when once you have done the mayor of watogo quest so robots don't aggro at you in Watoga until you shoot them first. 
---
In real life it is a special bee secretion that triggers the development of a bee larvae into a queen. Not like honey at all, more of a hormone paste. Gross. Haha (I grew up around some bee-keepers, lol.) It's mostly useful for selling to dumb, rich health nuts at exorbitant prices who believe it has some magical ultra-nutrition powers. Truth be told, it's just bee gunk unless you are a bee larva. 
---
Watoga is where im getting mine from, I get chems, legendary items and everthing between.
---
I actually totally forgot robots can drop aluminum, I’ll be running watoga tomorrow for sure, thank you! 
---
I’d love to see your camp. My Xbox camp is a simple inside out brick house but on pc I want to do a cool house with a pool and I’d love some ideas/solutions. When are you usually on?
---
Some wastelanders work for their caps while others would rather steal them.  
---
Accurate 😐
---
The higher your level the worse this issue becomes.  I use workshops to add some resources, as a nice open canvas to make CAMP blueprints, and to have a few defend events.  If someone else wants it I let them have it without trying to stop them.  Recently I've just given up on workshops.  I'm lvl148 and the last 4 times I've claimed a workshop some crew of dudes was trying to steal it within a minute.
---
Not with high enough Agility, the right perks, food buffs, and proper legendary armor. I can power attack all day. 
---
Ah, gotcha. Sometimes I move just a teeny bit to get the sights to pop for a moment. Will try this. 
---
Man that sucks, I just wish there was a way to fix it. I've only ever played together with people I know in real life. Just doesn't seem like the "community" they we're aiming for when making this game.
---
Congratulations on the level by the way, that's badass.
---
That's extremely wrong of them. I have no problem if somebody chooses to message and if someone is hearing-impaired I would just message back. It's really not that hard.
---
For me it's honestly not even the complicated ingredients that bothers me.  It's that if I have a couple ingredients in my backpack, I have no clue what else I need to know I need to grab before it rots. 
---
Honestly, I hate to say it, but especially now, don't trust anyone at your workshops. There's always one who will take advantage.
---
As soon as i saw him standing next to the workbench, I would have popped a psychostat and lobbed a pumpkin grenade. Then don't stop firing.
---
And **never** let them see you go into your pip boy. As soon as he saw the PB animation, he knew you were defenseless.
---
I think overall a “cap” or “standard” damage output for fine tuned builds needs to be established, and weak guns need to be buffed to this capability. People you play with need to be mindful and carry an extra weapon for tagging legendaries or when running in nuke zones. Balance should not be defined by sharing hits on legendary enemies. Or 1 guy killing everything before you get there. That’s just a player with bad taste. 
---
Definitely!!! I tried to add everyone’s name tonight but skipped a couple!! That’s close to tristate area!!! Lol
---
nah, buff the Assaultron Blade, it looks way too cool to be only a so-so weapon
---
See I had no idea they were able to kill me without me hitting them back until now. I assure you lesson learned!
---
Seriously, we get huge notifications when we accidentally walk into an event location, or when a nuke is launched (which may or may not effect us) but nothing really when it comes to attacks on our base. 
---
Mutants isn't the best prefix, but it's certainly not useless.  10 percent dmg to everything if you are mutated is definitely worth something.  My Mutant's 40 power attack meat hook does the most damage of any weapon I have.  I also have a mutants explosive combat rifle, TSE is 25 percent, mutants is 10.  Not as good, but still better than nothing.
---
Riflemen perks effect the Gauss, as well as most energy weapons outside of the Gatlings as those are considered heavy weapons. You're going to want Batteries Included because the ammo is considered energy weapon ammo, and Gauss ammo is freaking heavy! 
---
Someone needs to start an official faction, like how the have those official bos groups, or Appalachian mafia or whatever! Lol. One of the more expert players on here see if you can make that happen!!!
---
This would take away from the content that is being developed  &gt;.&gt;
---
A lot of these legendary effects are simply useless in any reasonable capacity. The build requirements necessary to take advantage of their effects is far outweighed by the self imposed handicaps you're required to endure in order to do so. It's not like it's just a highly vocal minority expressing their displeasure with getting 3* Nocturnal Tire Irons w 40% Dmg res while blocking &amp; 33% less AP cost from the SBQ. It's pretty much the general consensus among nearly every member of this game's community.
---
It is also usually required for the pocketed armor mods. 
---
It takes a couple minutes to pop up in the main menu, or if I’m too impatient I’ll just hop in a server and access it through the menu. 
---
Let us place a single bench at it as well! Even just a tinkerers.
---
Workshop PvP mechanics can be brutal. It makes you vulnerable anywhere on the map to teams. 
---
I usually hold at least 1 workshop at all times, so I spend a lot of time crouched to hide my position.
---
Much better than before but you still get DCs every now and then...
---
For some reason I cant access it at all not really a huge inconvenience just curious if it's just me. It wont pop up no matter how long I wait.up vote for responding thank you
---
After I looked around and found that the first three files were already in the directory (not modded files) and added them I'm happy to report that all is right with the world and everything works. Initially when I started adding mods none of the info I found referenced specifically loading the three "seventysix" files, only the actual mod files, after going through this thread and not finding any actual mods with the file names I started looking in the games data directory and found that they were actually bethesda files, added those first in the sResourceArchive2list= line and everything worked.  I'm now a "Happy Camper" and have even spent some of those Atom Shop points that I previously couldn't use.
---
This was my biggest disappointment. I was so excited to use the lmg. Such a shame.
---
Chances are you won't even see that guy coming because he's got stealth boy on and cavalier armour.
---
this.    
---
lever will do more damage per shot, but vastly smaller magazine and no armor piercing mods.  
---
They are different use cases: handmade is the superior weapon for cqc, lever is better for sniping.
---
Most recent meta of this game, and common fan theory, is that the events of 76 are part of a simulation being run by a PAM or MODUS like computer. There's a great terminal entry on it in one of the Archive terminals in the White Spring bunker. Plus graffiti signs warning "Nothing is real" all over the game world.
---
It's never to much. 
---
I had this encounter once but it was when a level 10 was attacking my level 60 rifle build and obviously I had the upper hand and one shot him after he charged my C.A.M.P and started lobbing grenades at it. Not 30 seconds after the fight here he comes just spamming grenades. I don’t what the motive was, but let’s just say. I got my kill 20 players and revive 20 players trophies within 10 minutes. 
---
I would have been kiting scorchbeasts to the munitions until he cried.
---
It happens every now and again. Sometimes fast traveling away and back again fixes it, sometimes it's just gone.
---
Healing factor? On RN 
---
The other night...my mate was crouched, stealth killing ghouls and a shopping trolley got stuck on him. He ran around for about 20 minutes stuck under this trolley.
---
I wet myself laughing...
---
Yes. 
---
My favorite memory from this game was when me and my friends (who have now quit the game) were all between level 8 and 25, and we took on a scorchbeast with Grahm himself on our side near the pumpkin house. We died a lot doing it but it was a lot of fun, sadly just a week later my friends all began to quit playing the game altogether. Now I just play solo
---
I love when that happens thanks for sharing.
---
What do you mean blue suitcase? 
---
Yeah a lot of my friends also stopped play kind of sucks to play alone, but hey thanks for sharing.
---
Player feedback being taken into at least a bit of account is necessary for the health of the gaming industry. Glad you aren't a gaming company. Or a customer service rep. And if you were, your business wouldn't last long. Game companies try to please and entertain players. When they get rigid, too greedy, or political you get what has happened to EA recently. 
---
Also, practice what you preach:   
---
"Could the mod team maybe implement a daily/weekly "Game Request Thread" where the top ideas actually get suggested and discussed as top level comments?"
---
\^So everyone else's ideas are harebrained (you used that wrong) but yours are valid because...? Oh, because you're special? Go soak your head.
---
Hell yeah
---
I think so they have done so much since the game was released, sure people are still hating it but as long as you ignore them your fine
---
There seems to be no problem Vendor is available and looks OK
---
If it shows up on the map you could always place a marker at it and then walk to the marker
---
Commando as the 10mm SMG is classified as a rifle despite looking like a pistol lol. I use it for my stealth commando build and find it pretty useful.
---
Sleeping is extra 5% as well! Took me 3 weeks to reach lvl 77. Had all experience buffs at almost all times.
---
Vendors refresh caps every 24 hours
---
First hour into the beta, my friend and I found ourselves killing Mirelurks near Grafton Steel, and then suddenly a Queen pops up, just as Country Roads comes on the radio. Underprepared and only like level 5 each, we knew it wouldn't end well. We proceeded to just scream, run around, and hide in the half-sunken house until we eventually died. Since then, we are always wary when that song comes on. Best fun I've had in a videogame.
---
A lot of certain locations are nuked because they give good loot
---
Yes get it
---
For the other ones I’m not entirely sure sorry
---
A better question is, why should any of us have to bulk anything in the first place? The game files should just have a "number of duplicates" attached to it, and that'd solve the issue right there. Instead of basically doing database management for them as part of the game!
---
Wow, I find myself really torn about this game now that I've realized this...
---
free fusion cores at the power plant
---
Country roads goes well with a lot of stuff in this game. I once had it play while I was running away from a scorchbeast. Thanks for sharing.
---
Yes I’m on in 5 psn ? 
---
I seem to have over 500 screws. A way to bulk them would be nice 
---
Hey that's cool, I've never had that happen!
---
Thank you, I’m lvl 6 and get chased and killed by lvl 100+ assholes 
---
Sleepz2184
---
their is one but it takes forever to find all the clue to put a story together, but I do agree the story is very dull, I specially dont like all the fictions started with the differrent ideas and at the end every wanted to use the nukes to get rid off the SB plague. it would had been better to uncover the different possible solutions to get ridd off the plague. but thats just me
---
I find stuff mainly in watoga suitcase.
---
Players get in through your windows.  If you have a chair/couch/work bench close by you can click it and appear inside.  Kind of like vats teleporting.
---
yeah I saw a video about it a few weeks or a month after the game came out.
---
Marsupial?
---
I had 1604 when I checked yesterday
---
Yes sir psn? I’ll be on in 5 
---
I'd love it :)
---
Especially since you can upgrade their level :)
---
It's actually marked as a miscellaneous quest and sometimes not active. Also say you die then come back can't pick it up and die again it will still mark to the 1st bag. 
---
I keep the enclave bunker clean of desk fans every day
---
Farm white springs lots of screws there. I used to play for 6-9 hours a day and get about 1000 screws easily 
---
yes  I can understand that, and it crazy how some off us paid full price for a broken game at lunch, but it has gotten a lot better and I hope it keep going on that dirrection. I cant wait for the new content will give some quests to do. 
---
MattyMo1
---
1. Vendors reset their caps 20 hours after you sell stuff. When you buy anything, I think 1/6 of the value goes to their available caps.
---
2. Usually what I, and my other high level friends do is just leave "care packages" outside Vault 76, but I guess the starter train stations would be a good spot as well.
---
3. Mothman is just a random spawn, he will just attack you, using various ranged attacks. Not sure too much on the lore behind him.
---
4. Maybe shooting through windows, using a roof entrance?
---
5. Certain locations have benefits to being nuked. Whitesprings, for example, has a lot of high level spawns and Fissure Site Prime for the Scorchbeast Queen. 
---
There is a blue suitcase in a bunch of the railway stations / trading posts. Throw stuff in there and people might pick it up. 
---
Also check there ;)
---
Well I think the game's goal tonight is simply to just push me off.  Never showed up tried to fast travel, went to the location and it is t there..
---
Said to hell with it.  Went to kill more, killed a 3 start level 50 legendary, Protectron and the corpse vanished. Didn't lose it cause I was within sore range the entire time. Yay this love hate relationship I have with this game....
---
- Vendor caps reset every 20 hours, I don't know the specifics.
---
- All train stations, but the one at Whitesprings most frequently as far as I can tell.
---
- You'll learn what Mothman is about the more you play. 
---
- Enemies can spawn inside your camp. If a player got in there.. Well there's a couple of ways to do it... If you have a work bench near a window a player can access it and the animation will pull them inside your camp.
---
- I won't spoil too much for you, but the two areas you see nuked the most are because one is a good place to farm legendary weapons and armor, the other is for main story reasons.. You'll understand the more you play.
---
&gt; Starfield, eso 6 to name two massive projects
---
Those are bethesda projects not bethesda austin projects. They've announced what projects they're working on. No one sourced wikipedia you fucking moron, again I just linked it to show that it is not bethesda's main studio that has been working on fo76. Only a fucking moron insists on putting things in someone elses mouth, then argues against that thing. It's called a straw man argument.
---
Guess I will check site alpha next time I play!
---
I still prefer Temporarily Erected Nomadic Tepee
---
The blue suitcase in Watoga station (not the phoenix vendor) is almost always used by higher level players to offload their unwanted crap, such as plans, recipes, ammo, materials, trash legendaries, etc.
---
Just the other day I dumped 3K .308, 6K .45, and 2K .44 rounds and a whole bunch of plans into that suitcase.
---
In turn, I occasionally find some nice stuff I've been looking for in there as well.  Just the other day some guy kindly put the Vault Suit (the under armour) plans in there, which I have been looking for since I first started playing.
---
Well at level 94 a bunch of level 60 super mutants can kill me in a couple of shots, so for me I want them to at least town down the damage they do so I don’t keep running out of stims as fast.
---
Thats why I ignored the game for so long lol. The shit storm when games aren't perfect always pass.  Any tips for someone getting into the game like a good youtube guide or something along that line? Or just personal experience 
---
Best fallout game I’ve played since NV, frustrating as hell at times. Wonderful sense of exploration 
---
I honestly don't care about either.
---
  
---
I've used other people's bases to kill stuff for me, pop a bullet in everything in a group, then run to the base and have their turrets take them out verses wasting my bullets. I can see getting upset if the bases pulled the spawn over there, but that's not happened for me.   
---
I've been a hopper, normally only when I accidentally agro those super sensitive bots. Sometimes because I'm lagging like crazy and am hoping a new server will be better. And a hopper is going to cause everything to respawn, so why complain about more mobs to kill?   
---
There's enough there for everyone, imo. 
---
Do you have a workbenches near a window? If so anyone can get your house that way. Some Nuke zones are good for flux. 
---
Oxhorn normally has a bit of stuff to help. What I would recommend is to figure out your build and then start making it because if you don’t have your build finished it will be a bit harder for you.
---
you going somewhere bud?
---
Interesting, but do I get to wear spurs that jingle jangle jingle?
---
I don't understand how... I haven't died in like weeks.... Are you just running at all of them head on with no plan? If so, try being more tactical or put points into defenses or better stimpacks healing
---
Gross don’t like the guy but if his guides are good I’ll try it out haha
---
No i just wanted to tell everyone how much I appreciated their accompaniment during my fallout experience thus far. Its a mechanic I’ve come to take for granted. 
---
She messaged me about him, wasnt even her bf it was a guy who thinks she’s his property...
---
Constantly changing cards around isn't a "challenge" it's a waste of time. 
---
I’m not a melee build I’m a gunslinger and I almost always hit them in the head. I normally will go for cover but sometimes they shoot through it. Not to mention a lot of the times I fast travel to my base I’m already at half health because they are always where I spawn
---
Fudge muppet helps and so does juice head.
---
As I spawned to Charleston Station I watched the bot and Brahmin killed by dogs.
---
But I would just enjoy the game for yourself.
---
This would be so nice. I know there's a mod on Nexus to do this, but I'd rather have the ingame ability. 
---
Awesome man Im glad ur still sticking with it! The reason why I wanted to thank everyone, including you, is that the reason why I still play is because of the awesome community (for the most part) this game has.
---
I didnt want to punish them for thus butthole’s rudeness. Kind of was tempted to steal the base not gonna lie. 
---
I was on the sunny side of level 100 and focused my build before I wasn't dying frequently. It required some RNG blessings and buying weapons and armor from other players though. What's your build look like? Perhaps I can offer some tips.
---
Nah xbox sorry. 
---
I just realized how stupid that previous reply sounded lol “the reason why is the reason why” haha, would change but whatever.
---
Let me go and get it real quick
---
Thank you I got it working now thankfully
---
Person told me an hour later that they were female and that its just her possessive friend

No Man's sky has kind of a barebones system like this. You can't leave lengthy messages at your comms terminal, just a brief message. 
---
It could be quite useful in 76.
---
Ok cool Ill try that I just want to get a basic build so I dont get murdered every second lol. Thanks for all the tips I'll check out fudge muppet
---
No problem. See you out I. The wasteland 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
When I started playing the game I met two players like 3 or 4 times and each time I was making little sign and they were responding it's not very interesting but it made my day
---
You have to be in game, and actually on a character. Hit ESC, then Z to get to the Menu. Go to Challenges, then Character. It should be the first item on there. I'm at 465.
---
Yo man I right when I went to accept I got booted lol be back on in a second 
---
Well I think building is always interesting. Thanks for sharing have a great rest of the day. :)
---
Ohhh Bethesda lol all good 
---
I've ran multiple characters now. 
---
I've had this happen one time when I got too close to whitesprings at a lower level. 
---
Otherwise I almost never encountered high level players in the Forest. If you're wandering out of the forest at level 12, that's likely your problem. 
---
I sort by new and only follow this game. Have seen it three times. Not trying to be a dick.
---
What u play on? Maybe I have some stuff you might wanna buy 
---
&gt; go for cover but sometimes they shoot through it 
---
Yeah second this, yesterday I was crouched down behind a thick stump and it was a waste of time as the bullets were going straight through it.
---
It’s full. And I was at plaza not station. 
---
A pipboy BBS that's server local would be hilarious. 
---
LOL - the same thing happend to me a couple of days ago... though I think I got bait'ed as two other players killed me as soon as I had looted the supply drop and 'stole' all my junk... luckily they didn't log off, so i got my revenge and my (and their) junk back...😂
---
You do if you want free adhesive. 
---
Just eat spoiled meat. 
---
Or, camp somewhere else
---
Jeebus
---
Once you get a mutation and cure it then you need to go to a new server. You can’t get another one until then. It should be pretty quick to get one.

I'm hoping the PvP servers coming out this month will help. Some of the guys doing this(I always try and talk after) dont seem to be particularly mean spirited, just bored.  I agree that the self-described "raiders" are willfully ignorant of a lot when they dismiss all of this borderline harassment behavior as "it's a PvP game, they designed it this way"
---
I've only had one character since BETA so not super impressive, thank you though!  They reduced the XP gains from quite a few different sources since launch so it was a little easier to level up in November
---
It's not players. Everytime I've met a player they haven't attacked me. It's the fact that higher level players spawn higher level enemies. It is made difficult when I have a main quest in an area where a high level player is, so the enemies are like unstoppable forces to someone like me who is comparable to pancake batter. I can't do anything to them which makes the quests impossible to complete unless I get the lucky chance that a high level player isn't in that area. It's killing my motivation to play.
---
They refresh every 18 hours actually 
---
Thanks Chapo!
---
i would say the only way to find out if you like it or not is to play it.
---
I have been playing from the beta, game still has issues but not remotly close to were it was.
---
I play 85% of the time solo and I enjoy every second of it, and I personaly have been getting more and more encounter with other players
---
I will keep you in mind! Looks useful to have a perfect late game weapon, but my level 24 with 400 caps isn’t interested yet...
---
yeah its annoying, but like everything you will lvl up and once you start fixing and finishing your build it will become easier. 
---
Do you play in a team often? There's way too much in charisma! You don't need Ammosmith equipped all the time, just when you're making ammo. Same with all those locksmith perks, you only need them when you're picking locks! Don't just run around with those card equipped, they are situational and only to be used when you're doing those specific tasks. Mysterious stranger is cool, but consider replacing it with Bloody Mess, and get some good mutations and use starched genes and class freak instead. Home defense is useless as well...
---
It looks like you're going for a hand gun build, try to focus on things that will compliment that ... When you're doing your perk card load out make damage output and damage resistance your primary focus... The extra stuff like lockpick and Ammosmith and most of your charisma stuff are not the cards to keep equipped, just swap it in on a situational basis.
---
Tried to play again last weekend, quit very fast because of several oversights of basic gameplay mechanics, technical issues and a mission progress rollback, topped off by a final "disconnected from the server" message.  
---
This game still feels like a fucking alpha and there is no excuse for that.
---
You just copy pasted my post ?
---
Uh no I actually posted before you lol
---
Well I’m almost always on a team so I use my charisma a lot 
---
Easiest place is Blackwater mine. Stand on the bridge for good rads then run up to the entrance and use the decontamination showers to cure rads. Rinse and repeat till mutated. If it's not one you want, Decon shower to remove, hop servers and do it again 
---
Or just buy the serums on Reddit and save time
---
How's it work on other players? Deathclaw resistance means nothing compared to a fully cavalier sprinting at you.
---
And some of the card I had equipped I. That I changed a bit
---
I do agree that some things need to changed. Only for a small and I mean like 1% more easy. 
---
Other things should be hard. This is a survival like game. 
---
Yet some of the suggestions are really good and deserves some high fives.  Most of it is just ideas to help the immersion. 
---
A couple of weeks ago I spawned into Whitespring golf club nuke zone. There were 5 other players there, each one showing up just in time to spawn a new set of glowing ghouls. After about 20 minutes we all gathered in the parking lot and, one by one, paper bags started dropping. Each person dropped 15-20 legendaries.
---
Everyone moved round-robin from bag to bag, taking what interested them and leaving everything else. It was like a co-op or a food pantry for legendaries.
---
I was, and still am a bit of a hoarder in-game, but the camaraderie was impressive. I was the last one to leave, and fought the urge to just run off with the rest.
---
I DID pick it all up, but just to drop it off in a train station suitcase. 
---
You can move your camp to repair it. It sucks but 40 caps is often easier than repairing most of a base.
---
Im about to do the same. Any tips for a stealthy commando?
---
That’s awesome I wish I had that experience once. Thanks for sharing have a great rest of the day. :)
---
yes. 
---
There is going to be a drink that gives you explosive rounds, and I use firecracker juice for that sweet crit bonus for my sneaky crit sniper build. 
---
I think headshots with high perception and stealth are pretty op. I one shot almost every super mutant and ghoul from a safe distance in my ultralight legendary armor. It may not be as op as melee, but I think it's viable for sure. In the future pvp, I think ranged builds done right will own most melee players as I can get in legal hits before they can close the distance
---
How does it apply to other players though? Death claw resistance means nothing compared with a full cavalier suit sprinting at you. You get one shot and you are dead
---
Check out many a true nerd. Did both a playthrough series and a fair minded video on what went wrong and his ideas on how to fix it
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwH1xJhcXG0eUA6WUpXltIDyhPJnNUv1Y
---
I think it’s more like you can squeeze off 4 shots
---
If I'm running a bloodied lever with adrenal reaction and get a sneaky headshot (which I always can get) I'm dealing easily 700-1200 per hit in rapid succession
---
"My wife loves a man in uniform. His name is Roger."
---
So that stealth builds can run around nuke zones in hazmat suits literally one shoting everything in sight with zero chance of dying?
---
Ah ! That's you! I always find that bunker emptied to the ground! 
---
Is there anything you won't complain about. 
---
No.
---
What the specs of your PC? 
---
Stick to the forest and explore Charleston and do some resource runs to the capitol building. You’ll level up quick enough
---
Why are you buying screws in the market if they are so easy to get? 
---
Temp erected nomadic tent lol
---
Xbox?
---
His what went wrong video was alright, and had some fair points... But I just thought it was a little too much of having his cake and eating it too. He constantly bounces back and forth between 'make it harder' and 'make it easier' and 'make it single player oriented' and 'make it multiplayer oriented' and doesn't once acknowledge the game was designed to be something to evolve over time based on how people are playing it and feedback from from the community.
---

---
Not your idea.
---
If you look at the patch notes you will see a distinct trend since release:
---
- Nerf all the things.
---
- You will PvP and you will have fun with PvP because I command it.
---
However 'sketchy' the game was at release It was significantly easier to level up before the devs went Ophrah on all popular mobs, workshops and events: 'you get an exp cut, and you get an exp cut and a loot table ~~nerf~~ 'rebalance', and you events? You get a longer cool down timer and a triple exp nerf! Stealth nerfs, blatant nerfs, resource production nerfs, damage nerfs, all the things get a nerf!... but we have doubled your stash space over a 4 month period so be grateful.... worms.'
---
I am leveling "specialised" alts now rather than trying to have one single toon that can be everything from stealth sniper to heavy gunner and exp flows significantly slower.
---
Made it effortlessly to 250 with my first toon even though for 5 weeks I focused heavily on acquiring plans and unlocking mods rather than lvling up... the alts is taking more cunning, time and resources to reach the point where the build is 'complete' - usually lvl 65-75.
---
Said that there is a 'perk' now that is new - at least to me: ending up the 'last man standing' on the server.
---
If you experience this you can get 3x the progression/hour easily.
---
You’re not looting properly unless your FPS in the bunker goes up by a few frames!

Can confirm. Even with steel walls around everything, including my purifier and farm, and a locked door, I will still bounce sessions as soon as I notice my camp has been discovered by a random player. Too often players get destructive when I don't respond to their incessant pestering.
---
I had one so bad yesterday it almost ruined the game for me. It was the first time I had made it to watoga and was at a vendor. This person one-punch kills me right as I leave the robot and try to go to the storage box and the only place the game will let me spawn in is back at the vendor. Well, guess who was waiting?  The same person, who spawnfragged me over and over.  Oddly, they didn't take my loot, and I didn't want to lose the ballistic fiber I had just gotten to fix my armor, so I resisted the urge to jump servers in the hopes they would realize they had already gotten all my caps and leave me alone. Finally, after what seemed like the 15th time, they stopped killing me, so I stuck my junk into the vendor's storage trunk and  wandered back to my camp that was somewhat outside of watoga to start repairing my armor.  
---
The next thing I know, this person shows up at my camp and starts to destroy it. I tried to fight back, even managed to pull my Fatman out of storage before they broke that too, took some drugs for the buff, and hit them straight on with 2 mini nukes. It barely moved their health bar, but it did manage to piss them off and then they started screaming at me like I'm the asshole and then proceeded to finish completely destroying my camp. That's when I noticed this person was at a level more than 3x my own. 
---
I had never even had anyone try to engage me in PVP before, and it really left me feeling frustrated with the game, and the experience.  Prior to this, the other players that I came across either helped me battle whatever I was up against or gave me a wide berth.
---
Best tip for using energy weapons is don't. They don't do nearly enough damage and break incredibly fast. Until this gets fixed you're sadly better off using almost anything else
---
Great pics, how did you find the periodic table in the doghouse??
---
I stabbed your mom.
---
But it's just a joke, brah!
---
This only painfully points out that the interface for trading needs to be redesigned.
---
&gt;Chez Vivi Typewriter - 4 screws
---
&gt;MiniNuke Stabilizer Fins - 2 Screws
---
&gt;Restored Desk Fan - 2 Screws
---
Wtf. I've never seen any of these after like 200 hours play time.
---
Hahaha. Exposed.
---
Me too :)
---
That's what I've been doing. My base blueprint doesn't work and I have to do it all over anytime. Takes about an hour 
---
So, you can no longer think of yourself as above the average person? 😂
---
Honestly dude, never fight back. Those dicks are always in asaasins sentinel/cavalier armour and their whole build is dedicated to being a PvP dickhead.  Regular players enjoying the game have literally no chance against them. Even if you swap in all the perks and get the fancy weapons and armour, those douches will still win because they've been training at an entirely different game than you've been this whole time. Not worth it. I'm hoping survival mode will drain them out of adventure mode.
---
It won't. They'll be unable to kill each other because everyone is in the same ridiculous gear, so they'll come back to adventure to screw with people who don't like PvP lol
---
You're probably spot on. Whenever i see a youtube video of pvp, its a dude having so much fun in assasin sentinel bashing up on a dude in power armour. 
---
Can we get a tutorial or perhaps a redesign of the trade interface to make it more intuitive?   Many  players cannot use the trade screen and this impacts the whole economy.
---
True enough.  But this can be mitigated to a point as well.   Bolstering armor pieces, you can make it much harder to die and other perks also increase defenses with lower health.    But yes, its definitely a bit more difficult at lower health.
---
Hmm, Ok, I falsely assumed it was zero because that would make sense.  Sigh, I guess I will have to visit the stash and drop off all 10 of my keycards.  
---
Just wait until he gives up. Then look for him on the map. Chances are that they went back to their base. Fatman it.
---
Seems pretty normal to me.
---
In my experience, and probably in most, some of these people tend to remember your usernames (we do when we’re HUNTING griefers, so just know there’s a lot of people who like to take out the jerks).  I know it can be a pain to appear offline but it does give the opportunity for them not to find you or join your game when you’re playing.  If you’re on XBOX and you want, DM me your username and you’re welcome to join our big group.  We serve, protect, teach &amp; share everything we have together.  
---
Including the distilleries?
---
I kind of like the stories their poses tell, but would quite happily give that up.
---
The horrible explosion they do when something touches them has taken years off my life!! 
---
But you did source it, you’re just trying to talk you’re way out of it, not gonna happen. 
---
Just because they’re Bethesda Austin doesn’t mean some of their developers aren’t working on eso 6 or starfield.
---
Don’t give up. Some days are going to be rough. 
---
Even if the songs are from a list that Bethesda has been given the rights to for the game.
---
Yes, I can see your point here, but I do usually stop off at my camp and drop all that off plus cook food, get water, sleep in bed, play instrument all before heading into the silo.   Perhaps there are more people that would check their camp before heading into silo because the silo takes me around 45 minutes.  
---
I understand that there are people who are pretty good at them and know all the shortcuts and can do them in 15 mins solo.  
---
So all in all I guess there is support for having one at the silo for the few that are experts at it.
---
Have some too - GT Leha_Blin
---
If there was this option In the ATOM store, I would totally buy this guy!  Even if he kept killing me.  That would be awesome!
---
Just realized I have zero caps after that last incident. With no caps I can't even take the workshop if I wanted to. So I'm out of ammo, caps, and resources again. I'm not having fun anymore.
---
Yeah. Sounds like fun to me. This game's PvP is so unbalanced you don't need to cheat hahaha
---
distilleries don't really strike me as *potential* upcoming DLC.
---
Keep in mind also that once the Survival mode kicks in a lot of these guys and gals are probably going to become a bit less interested in bugging people.  They seem to get off on killing players for the fun of it.  Once the other opportunity happens I think they might disperse a little and flock to PVP land.  
---
What system are you on and what ammo do you require?
---
Yeah I've noticed more griefers recently to. Never had much of a problem then a level 5 guy and a level 96 guy show up to my bad near white springs. I've only just hit 40.At first I thought the higher level was just showing him around until the lower level started attacking me and the high level is giving me the thumbs down for not fighting back.
---
The high level has TSE weapon that killed me in two shots. I followed them back their base saw the higher level hiding to snipe me while lower level was getting wanted attacking me. So I lured some enemies to slow them down. With that explosive shot weapon it didn't even do that as he killed everything instantly. So I moved around out of view of higher level, killed the lower level because it felt good then server hopped to avoid the higher level killing me. Extra work for me but damn it felt good haha 
---
1. Go to nearest train station with a vendor.
---
2. Dig through your stash box and take the 1000 excess wood and steel you don't need.
---
3. Sell them to the bot for all the crap you do need.
---
4. Rinse and repeat.
---

Distillation is coming to fallout 76 on the 12th tho, it says in the roadmap :)
---
Well its not that great as others pointed out.  They actually pop up on a screen like a legendary when found too, as if to point out their awesomeness or rather awesome-less.  
---
LOL P2W much?
---
Sunday brothers were big moonshiners.
---
They have their own sudequest and story.
---
Level 31 now and DC'd 1 time. So, yes
---
I'm on PS4 and I use 10mm, 5.56, and .44. I don't expect anybody to be able to help with the ammo thing, I'm just venting my frustration I guess. So annoyed with this situation. It took me forever to take Grafton Steel today and when I did I couldn't make a fusion gen without more nuclear material, so I took the power plant for that and waited, then went back and went to finally set up the ammo production. Finished and immediately murdered. Blegh.
---
I can't wait for them to be able to kill each other as nuch as they want and lose valuable loot in survival mode.
---
Bad experiences stick out like a stubbed toe, but I have to remember that 99% of my encounters have been friendly or neutral.
---
I am guilty of engaging in PvP sometimes. A few days ago before I was about to log off I came across a player with 5% health, so I killed them and didn't take their loot. I did them a favour, they could respawn with full health. The next time I logged in I wanted to be able to run around naked with a bounty. Sometimes I RP as a bounty hunter.
---
No worries, happened to me to when it came to lead farming Charleston Fire Department but I think with exploring areas you normally don't, you'll find secrete areas that are better farming spots (ex. Toxic Larry's for acid, Hornwright Testing Site 3 for Steel and Lead, Lucky Hole Mine for a lot lead (easily 1000+ lead scraps from there) and it just makes playing the game a lot easier.
---
REEEE CRITICIZING A SHITTY GAME IS BEING ELITIST 
---
You will find it at the last floor (fourth floor) of forth defiance in a room protected with laser, to pass the laser you need to do the brotherhood quest that if I remember well start at abbie bunker in mire 
---
I'm on PS4 unfortunately. Whoever kills those guys is going to get a *nice* bounty though.
---
Yes indeed.   There are many achievements that don't work in the game.   The most annoying is the death by nuke achievement.  I went to whitesprings right before it hit and stood dead-center on the spot where it lands.   Kills you instantly... yet no achievement.
---
BTW, that spot is usually by the corpse with the TNT plunger on the hill near the tree.
---
Thanks for pointing that out. I was playing with friends who already beat the game so I breezed through some parts of the quests. 
---
That makes me less optimistic about it all but it doesn't exclude the possibility of beth reusing the location as an asset. I had seen smaller stills before but none that I remember doubling as a container so I was interested 😁
---
Yeah I've noticed more griefers recently to. Never had much of a problem then a level 5 guy and a level 96 guy show up to my bad near white springs. I've only just hit 40.At first I thought the higher level was just showing him around until the lower level started attacking me and the high level is giving me the thumbs down for not fighting back. My turrets wouldn't even shoot them but it did glitch do my own turrets were attacking me. 
---
Im betting you are not on PC. Ive heard consol is more toxic. If you are on PC we can team up and go crafting ammo together. Crafting ammo is real easy, if you know where the lead and iron ores are. Really no need to use the munition factory! 
---
Just post: “H: screws, W: “a thank you”
---
Yeah ive wanted a base, their just for the easy water access, current location would be fine minus the rad toad infestation. 
---
Lolol
---
Hmm.. Good point, I can see that. I usually Fast Travel to camp which uses up about 30 seconds.  You don't have much time left to get to the boundry of the nuke zone then.   
---
They do, although I've noticed that sometimes they can desync by a split second.
---
Get a ssd, or go to it in game.
---
Maybe that's why we never get screws back when scraping weapons, they're all striped.
---
You only got rad toads?? You lucked out because I spawned high level blood bugs twice 🤢 
---
They're easy enemies but I wouldn't want them chewing on my potential camp lol
---
No, the game is shitty. Acting like you’re the only one with the right opinion is being elitist. Go troll somewhere else bud. 
---
Trust me. Make way for Watoga and work from there for a few days. Resources ammo weapons and whatnot are bountiful.
---
You’ll bounce back. 
---
Weird I would have thought the horrible game would drive you away 
---
Oh you mean the way it should've been from the start?
---
Yeah I haven't even started the brotherhood quest yet so I'm nowhere near being able to get it from Fort Defiance.
---
Is it nowhere else anymore?
---
I really like the LMG look, but I never had the heavy weapon perks to compare the damage right.  I guess I could have removed all my current perks and compare the current weapons to the heavy ones for a good basis.
---
I did have a plasma gatling for a while because it was hefty looking and liked the design.  Sadly it melts after 1-3 mobs. So had to get rid of it.   just did not want to carry around 5-8 of plasma gatling just to go through a single area.
---
Yeah but they are such a pain since i always for get to put my armor back one before getting off, come back to 4 or 5 toads inside
---
It's not coming on the 12th sadly as it will be dripfeed. Most likely it will be the new quests 'shear terror and ever upwards' that are coming on the 12th. 
---
They most likely have already killed each other.  I can tell you now though about your ammo problem, there are very very easy ways to craft a ton of ammo a LOT faster than that workshop spits them out.  Go on the Lead &amp; Steel ore run through the ash heap and lucky hole mine and farm acid and boom, you’ve got a ton of base ammo resources.  We’ve stopped taking over munitions cause it’s a lot more fun and rewarding crafting stuff.  Ammosmith &amp; Super Duper maxed out are the best. 
---
i have 500 screws, never really run out (routinely sell them in blocks of 200), so, for my friends out there that do run out, if you could answer these 4 questions:
---
1) do you use power armor?
---
2) do you use perks like luck of the-/whiteknight (or power armor equivalent)?
---
3) do you spend any downtime on runs/roaming/farming low level areas, and if so, how much?
---
4) do you know what junk contains screws?
---
thanks in advance!
---
It's springs for me v-v
---
Darn handmade rifle, why does it need so many springs x-x
---
No sorry it's a static spawn at fort defiance. Are you on ps4? 
---
Who pays market price these days?
---
Thanks for the info, I'd rather know that now than on the 12th.
---
That serves no more purpose than current Discord. Point of text chat is that I can communicate people I meet on the road, if I can't do that then there is just no purpose to it.
---
NOOOOO NO NEW SONGS THERES LIKE 57 I NEVER GET THE GOOD ONES WE DONT NEED MORE
---
They could just removed any song with pete in the name
---
No bethesda said it's coming on the 12th, shear Terror is coming April. Did you even Look at He wild appalachia Releases? 
---
AMAZING 🤣
---
there are 4 toy stores at wavy willards water park (10-15\~ screws per run)
---
Oh your *current* location. I need to read more thoroughly. I get radrats, super mutants, and scorched at my camp but they always spawn across the water from me so I can usually finish them before they do much damage luckily.
---
It’s not perfect, but more than playable. Might get one disconnect in a 4 hour session. Sometimes I have issues with stuttering when indoors. I just jump servers and usually that will fix it
---
feudal ~~rice~~ screw kingdoms
---
No, xbox.
---
My fav memory is when we finally decided to quit the game, because even after 2 patches, we couldn’t see each other after a loading screen. 
---
Don’t you ever tell me that this piece of shit game is a multiplayer game, because Bethesda didn’t even care about the most MP-killing bug of FO76. 
---
Hey bud. I always avoided the workshops for this very reason.
---
With a tinkers workbench you can make ammo with lead. Plastic. And steel.
---
Any basic melee weapon will help kill enemies. And they usually have a bit of ammo on them,
---
Do you spend time trying to hit the vendors to scrape caps together? A few luck perks could help you too. There's scrounger or pharma farma. They both help with finding extra in containers. One is ammo. The other is meds
---
Sucks ur having a rough time with some guys. But really I'd avoid the workshops. 
---
We had screws around the days of Christ??  Next thing you'll tell me is India had nukes around that time too!
---
Here's what I think the legendary effects should be at for a few
---
Two-Shot = 1.75x or 2x dmg 
---
Instigating = 2.5x dmg on first hit (favors slow single shot guns)
---
Furious = 10% dmg increase up to 2.25 or 2.5x dmg (favors full auto guns)
---
Honestly, gears have been my biggest problem.
---
from last time I read it said content coming on the 12th and several weeks after. Where does it say 'shear terror' comes on april?
---
Sorry I'm on ps4 today I will go farm fort defiance because a friend need the brown asylum cap if you was on ps4 in meanwhile I was farming i would have picked up the plan for you if it hasnt been picked by anyone. Sorry if my grammar is incorrect but English not my first language
---
&gt;you wouldn't understand the intricate interplay of metrics that underpin the top down decision making of game design
---
I AM NO JOKE SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN LEARNING THIS
---
Please, go into detail, I want to know!
---
That's really all I want. 
---
I have like 2,000 10mm rounds. I'd love to do anything with that
---
Yes, you are correct.  I never farmed whitesprings until I hit level 129 because... Nothing else to do.  Most of the legendary spawn places are well known and half the time, they are dead when I show up.  So just to have something to do, go to whitesprings.
---
But with the amount of ammo spent on SBs, its best just to run away from them because it will not further your progress and will only cause me to take a detour to the mines to get more steel/lead again now.
---
Whats the point of playing the game anymore when cannot progress somehow?  I have done everything (except PVP).  
---
Every quest, every location explored.   The only things I have not done yet is find the two remaining Pip-Boy games.  When I am positive are probably in places not marked on map, small places.   While I tried finding all of those little places, I guess I missed a bit.   But do I just wander around aimlessly now on the already explored map trying to find these?   Becomes a chore now.    
---
Note:  I loved playing the game and got 200+ hours out of it.  So I consider my money well spent.  I just got to the point in the game where there is nothing left to do but try and increase ability of character.  Not min-maxing, just trying to feel "accomplished" by increasing character now.
---
Crafting guns to learn mods.
---
It's all good. Thanks for the help anyways! 👍
---
Oh yes indeed.  I got lucky and had just finished killing everything and he showed up.  So nothing for him to charm.
---
Others have posted screenshots of him charming SBs and stuff though.  Flatwoods guy can be really easy (in my case) or just a trip to fight.
---
I feel like a broken record having to grind just to play the game.
---
I miss when games didn't require you to grind to play them.
---
Np good luck a d have a good day 
---
That person is wrong, on the official roadmap for the dlc it has all the dates listed and on March 12 there will be “Welcome to Appalachia, A mythical beast a lost generation of scouts and the strongest brew this side of the wasteland” also releasing that day is “Brewing and Distilling, discover the secrets of the forbidden brew Nukashine and bring new brewing and distilling systems to you C.A.M.P”
---
[here is a link to a page that goes in detail and has the official pictures](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vg247.com/2019/02/22/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-release-date-2019-roadmap/amp/) 
---
That blows. I've never build a decon shower simply because people like to destroy them. Had someone shoot up my base to try and get me to pvp a few days ago. I think a lot of people are really bored and looking for the laziest ways to get caps.
---
Oh! I see. Thank you for the explanation.  As you can tell, I never knew this happens.   
---
I would encourage streamers only because they provide some entertainment for others. I don't like them or watch them, but some do.
---
I've got 1k in .44 if you want them. Been saving in case I get lucky with finding a legendary revolver but that's low chance so I will most likely get that many again before I find one worth while.
---
Psn is smeg_n_ell if you're interested.
---
Level 175 and what the heck is the Cat Lady House?????
---
Try to record it. I haven't experienced anything like that.
---
When I need ammo I tag the base materials (lead, steel, plastic, acid.) Equip a decent Melee weapon and just farm the lower level areas for an afternoon. That paired with the previously mentioned ammo smith and super duper gets me as much ammo as I need. The game is a grind but if you stick to a routine you'll keep yourself flush for a while.
---
Oh wow it literally says brewing and distilling comes March 12 100%.
---
SMH this guy insta downvoted me too so idk if my post will be seen by many people. I was really hoping to talk about this. I've got my fingers crossed the location is used because I've taken a liking to it but I wouldn't mind brand new locations either 🤗🤞
---
Or just make a radio station that will play any music on your own computer...
---
Obligatory pun about screws........
---
Screw that.
---
That sounds screwy.
---
No steel or lead?  Sounds like you're screwed for ammo.
---
Guess you've been screwing around too much.
---
Maybe I just have a few loose screws, guess I better rotate this here tool to the right a bit more.
---
You sound, screwed!
---
I hope you're getting screwed, get it eh? Eh? Eh, eh, eh eh eh?  Eh heh, but seriously, I hope you find love &lt;-&lt;
---
Don't mind me, I just have a few loose screws. (Wait, crap I already said that one...)
---
...uh.  uhhhh.  Screw it, I'm done.
---
Personally the nuclear waste resource at Monogah power plant was my go to. its 100+ rads a second so once or twice a day id go there and pick up a mutation
---
OwWWWWwwWwwO
---
You're new to the game?
---
Now that I'm storing my decon I don't have to worry 
---
So because they're called loose screws, does that mean they're like, partially stripped or something?
---
https://www.vg247.com/2019/02/22/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-release-date-2019-roadmap/ thats luterally the first site on Google when you type wild appalachia Releases. There is the bethesda made Release photo with all New Features and dates
---
Well written and wholly agreed with. Take my upvote!
---
THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS???
---
I missed that tree completely...  mystery solved.
---
I've see one as well, on xbox. He was standing just outside my camp. 
---
I ran, my camp needs no help thanks all the same!
---
"Meet the overseer"
---
already edited my original comment. 
---
Unmarked house south-east of Morgantown High School of follow the road north when you spawn at Bolton Green - essentially the assumption is that a crazy cat lady (or rather person) was gathering cats and killing them, to make them as plaque trophies. You can find about 15 or so catbowls in the house that scrap for a good amount of plastic each.
---
Yeah sorry didnt See that 
---
They buffed the magazine size on the handmades.  The perforation magazine used to be 10 bullets, now it's 20.
---
I am shooketh and finding this tomorrow.  Thanks! 
---
I don't know any other builds that can 2 shot people with slap damage though.
---
I have 1800 10mm rounds for my Perfect Storm SMG which I almost never use, I’d be happy to give them to you. I also have a few hundred .44 rounds that I can give you if you’d like. The Scrounger perk for Luck is very helpful as well.
---
Also for the issue of losing caps from being killed, being at your workshops automatically flags you for PVP,  so it might be best to try to spend as little time at them as possible and/or stay in sneak mode so you don’t appear to people on the map.
---
Sadly man your playing the game wrong. Workshops are pvp. If the players that want to do pvp see an owned workshop they are assuming you may want to as well. Your basically putting a target on the map menu by having a claimed workshop. Forgive me for being blunt but you're asking for it 
---
As for the ammo you're better off getting the perk cards mentioned in other comments and crafting yourself. Way easier and will take less time and effort in the long run. Or think about trading for it. 
---
Personally ive only taken 2 workshops in my 127 levels because i realized it wasn't worth it to me and i just didn't like doing it. 
---
let the guy try out energy weapons, he might actually enjoy it and only enjoy it more when its finally fixed
---
Sounds like a plan lol, there are videos out there that show where it is if my description of the location wasn't too much help.
---
I mean, he was almost right.  Look at Charleston, that place got flooded bad after tge bombs fell.
---
Seems like PS4 is the worst platform for griefing! I’ve seen so many posts from PS4 players saying the griefing won’t stop. It definitely is more toxic on PS4 across games, unless you’re playing privately with friends.
---
PC seems so much more chill in my experience! People have never griefed me in the time I’ve played, and I’ve earned some pretty nice items from players who have gifted me some of their old stuff.
---
If you can, try blocking griefers or remember usernames of players that do it. If a name keeps coming up and they’ve killed you before, maybe report them? If they’re ruining your gameplay frequently and pushing you away from the game then it’s definitely something to talk to PlayStation about.
---
I hope you find a chill server soon that sparks a pattern for finding servers that aren’t full of assholes. 
---
Daily reminder that all cults are equally manipulative and dishonest, at least in real life they are.  Would know, was in one until I realized what it was.
---
This is nice but it sounds like you have no idea what you are getting into.
---
I once shot a mothman and caused it to stagger off a cliff.  It fell to its death.
---
I don't know how though, since they can fly...
---
Ooo, good to know, thanks for that 👍
---
I hope this is sarcasm. But if it's not boy will you be suprised when you find out robots are like the only people to interact with and you can't meet the overseer or any other human npc.
---
Heya, still have some serums?
---
Collect golf balls around Whitesprings.  Or scavenge enamel buckets in fort defiance.
---
Why thank you kind human person, much appreciated.
---
&gt;Same. Just can't get anything from the Atomic Shop to generate. I deleted all files, uninstalled, reinstalled and still can not get them to show up
---
I never even considered myself on the average level :(
---
How is it possible to run out of screws? I got so much I’m always selling them or throwing them away every few days 
---
But i really need springs lol everything else is easy to get
---
Stealth builds can do that anyway so it really wouldn't matter much. There's only so many perk cards, weapon/armor types, chems, etc to begin with and stealth builds still potentially do a greater amount of damage than almost any other. Like I said though it's a high risk, high reward duality. They could possibly one shot almost any enemy but potentially get caught slipping and get one shotted by a Lvl 9 Feral Ghoul Roamer if they're not careful.
---
Yes sir which do you need ? 
---
Just trading with someone, I’ll let you know shortly if that’s alright, thank you
---
Agree with this. If at first it’s not showing go to miscellaneous in quests.
---
Exactly my thoughts mate.
---
You can't call out someone like that and expect it to blow past like the wind lol
---
I use a quad Tesla rifle with an automatic barrel mod. It's only a one star but it's one of my favorites.
---
Well thought out post with tons of information.
---
I really do hope they plan on making some of the new brewed drinks to be used in cooking recipies.
---
I also wanted to do some food creations and discovered that the only valid ones I could really do is the ones that need Salt, Pepper, Spices.   Those do not spoil and I can usually use 2-3 of the final products before they spoil.  Don't make more than this as the final result will spoil way before you can use it.  However, I feel they take up way too much room in the stash to really store that many. I typically limit to 10 of each of those; which sometimes run out because don't find any just wandering around.   I am not going to go on a Salt-Gathering loot expedition because the food spoils way too fast to be of much use.
---
If you spend tons of time to go out of the way to successfully make a crafted dish, please don't make it spoil in 10 mins.  You really cannot plan for stuff like that especially in groups; so it discourages grouping or ignoring cooking.
---
Make salt, pepper and spices 0 weight so we can store them when we are exploring throughout the game and can plan on making/using food when we need it.  Reduce the bonuses of the food if needed, but increase the spoil times dramatically.
---
I liked making the Vegetable Medley Soup because could grow all the stuff except the Salt... Which I run out very fast.
---
So what I tend to do is make 10 Corn soup and 1 Vegetable soup.   Gotta use the Veggy Soup right away or risk spoiling and hope enough of the corn soups last.
---
Yes, I know there is Perk to make food last in your inventory longer.   No one equips this.  No one.
---
What platform u on i can make all 3 jumpsuits im on ps4.
---
The game is not unfair for lower levels, it is tho a tad difficult.
---
My advice would be to invest in strength early on, with at least 12 points moving further and get the below cards as fast as possible:
---
Martial Artist rank 3 (becomes available at level 16)
---
Blocker rank 3 (level 21)
---
Incisor rank 3 (level 34)
---
And Slugger or Iron Fist (depends which weapon types you find, Slugger is for 2h and Iron Fist is for unarmed).
---
Also get 4 points in Charisma and run Lone Wanderer, if you're playing alone.
---
The rest of your build you decide how to do it. Personally, on my alt I run a weird unarmed - vats crit build (I don't min-max and I like the best of both worlds). At level 30 I could clear out high level ghouls from the Whiteapring golf course easily, wielding a non-legendary mm gauntlet and crappy armor.
---
If you're playing on PC I still have a level 15 1-star anti-armor baseball  bat with the rocket mod which literally rocked when I was low level (even without incisor, due to its AA effect). Could easily kill 2 max level ghouls with it, more of them and I would've become overrun cos of the crappy low level armor and lack of proper perk cards.
---
Until maybe level 30 try to avoid going head on to the golf course, tho you can easily clear out the other ghouls, just try not to get overwhelmed by them or avoid running into the deathclaw if it spawns. Anyhow, even if you do get overwhelmed run towards the boys at the entrance and they will take care of the swarm.
---
I've leveled alot in Whitespring using the above tactics. I didn't even attempt the main quest until I got to above 30. Once you get Incisor maxed out (around level 37) you can pretty much go anywhere and fight anything short of SB and the big game hunting, especially the deathclaws.
---
Overall, I managed to get 65 levels easily in less than 1 month playing very casual. And still have "I am become death" and virtually all sidequests to do.
---
I did the same with Firecracker Berry... But its too difficult to make those recipies anyway.  There was something else needed in the recipes that made it tough to make without some of the components spoiling first.
---
My name is my psn. Add me.  Lvl 66. 
---
I have a TSE Tesla rifle with the shotgun barrel. Yes, it doesn’t have the arcing effect, but you don’t even need to charge it up all the way and can knock out fairly strong enemies with less than a clip.
---
I've encountered random damage while sprinting and suddenly stopping as if I was staggered but without the screen wobble. Never seen anything though.
---
If you go in with zero expectations, Chuck E Cheese pizza is an enjoyable experience.
---
Ohh this is intriguing, if its okay I will add you and stop by to have a look, been looking for something to spend my caps on :D
---
IGN same as here :)
---
I play on ps4 and have never had a problem with griefers.
---
I think it makes sense for them to dissapear over time. Imagine if time in the Fallout 76 world is continuously moving forward. Its been what? 4 months now. And those corpses always break up and fall apart into dust when we bump into them. You would think eventually they all go away. 
---
And if Fallout 76 is to survive, the wasteland needs to evolve with the playerbase. Like ESO we can't be stuck on the whole "scorched" storyline forever. There needs to be a conclusion and new threats (proper NPCs/Raiders) at some point. 
---
I’m xb1
---
I always have my tv on mute if I'm not wearing hearing aids late at night.  
---
Also because my brother asleep on couch.  
---
The flicker woke him up. 
---
He said to turn on the volume because otherwise it seems like I'm trying to sneak and hide.
---
Says the marines is never quiet so you gotta sleep thru anything
---
And that the tv volume won't bother him
---
Avoid the workshops, make ammo yourself - there are plenty of materials everywhere, use ammosmith + superduper perks  and you have no problem with ammo.  As for build - try stealth commando/sniper - you'll use small amount of ammo, because you'll be stealth critting almost all the time, which result in killing most enemies with few bullets.
---
I used my damn tesla rifle when defending a person's workshop, of course I got a bounty. I was going to creep off and hide in RobCo and decided that is just putting off the inevitable. So I took off all my armor so it wouldn't get damaged and went back to the owner of the workshop.  First I waved him down friendly like, he returned my wave. So I walked up in front of him calmly and did the finger guns emote. He was silent for what seemed like was forever when he came on the mic. He asked "Do you need a bounty removal service?" I gave him an enthusiastic thumbs up. He obliged and even left my dropped junk for me to recover. 
---
Sorry, someone sorted me out with all of them. Thank you very much though
---
Get the construction perk in intelligence.
---
Marsupial + jump jets exist so if your plan is to keep them out make sure they are high
---
Screws can be quickly farmed hitting residential areas. Junkyards also yield loose screws when doing junk piles. There's 2 junkyards and a bunch of junk nodes, some with workshops sone without but tbh you can farm them faster.
---
Work your build out before you level up using nukesanddragons (Google it).
---
I have 7 characters over level 60, all with very different builds, it's best to pick one build and work towards it.
---
In the current game, stay away from:
---
Any pistol build
---
Non automatic rifle builds unless you're building into sneak plus a little crit.
---
My view on my top 3 builds:
---
Heavy gunner - probably the best all round end game build. By best I mean effective at both farming and killing the scorchbeast (it's excels at this), combined with fun. Power armour is a must.
---
Unyielding / bloody melee build with a little heavy gunner added in (bloodied harpoon or something) - you combine sneak, gunfu, mutations and a powerfist and pretty much everything dies in one shot (other than scorchbeast). Because of gunfu it is beyond fun farming places like whitesprings and you're so fast you feel like a super hero. My most fun build, I do it in a manta man outfit.
---
Unyielding / sneak automatic weapons build: throw in lots of demolition for your explosive weapons, adrenaline and tenderizer are a must have. Plays and fits somewhere between the two above builds. I do it in a silver shroud outfit
---
There's also shotgun build which is ok but struggles to down scorchbeast, pure melee build which can get a little dull and medic build which is really just for group play and not needed in the current game.
---
If you're on pc then feel free to add me under 'hoffmeisterr', I play Friday nights, most Saturdays and some Sundays. I'd be happy to show you lots of tricks, make you ammo and help you with builds.
---
Do you have speed demon, carnivore and electrically charged? 
---
Most "parents" can't be bothered to parent, they just want their kids quiet so they can stare at their phones and post on facebook. Why do you think 99% of the player base of the CoD series are kids. 
---
Its lead to a massive rise in entitled asshole kids. 
---
Any chance you could share a picture? Never heard of it before and really curious what it looks like.
---
I feel more and more this game is work. Things are made hard for the purpose of making them hard, not to enhance the enjoyment of the game. You have lost your way Bethesda and the only folks enjoying it are the PvP griefers.
---
I grew up in a culture were if you had nightmares as a child, your parents would hire a witch and she would pour molten hot lead over your head (with some "safety net" between).
---
I'm NOT joking. I've had this done to me over 30 years ago and my body is probably still detoxifying from the lead.
---
Yes I do psn ? 
---
I always play this exact way in any RPG I play, no matter if it's solo, coop or MMO.
---
I think the answer is; no one knows.
---
I think getting a mutation is random. I usually get a mutation after my health bar has almost been completely covered by rads. Sometimes I’ll be almost completely infested with radiation and receive no mutation at all, no matter how many times I try.
---
Serving hopping is all you can do, and even then there’s no guarantee you’ll get a mutation at all 
---
Much better than the sell nothing mod. 
---
Fans too?
---
I grab every typewriter and fan i see. I sell excess scews from time to time. 
---
And cans have lead as well the tin can alarms are great as they give 9 cans everytime you disarm them.     
---
I try not to spawn in at my camp. It takes ages for everything to load  lol
---
Dont forget the gaussrifle is a balistic weapon that uses energy ammo to fire it's shots. Rifle an works 
---
Already got me on your list dude, I bought marsupial off you. I will message you online when I’m on.
---
I'm gonna be that guy. The nuclear plants in the Fallout universe appear to be Nuclear Fusion based and as such wouldn't catastrophically melt down. At worst they would stop working. Think of it like a fusion core, it just stops when it runs out of fuel.
---
So you've just uncorked a bottle of wine (in the process of which you almost stabbed yourself in the hand) - first impression: nice bottle, awesome looking label, famous winery, description on the back sounds promising. So far, you've only had a few sips and it tastes kinda good... but if you keep drinking you might end up with quite the headache... and paying attention to the finer nuances might leave quite the bitter aftertaste... amounting to a rather underwhelming experience.
---
But, in all seriousness: just play the game for as long as you enjoy it and move on if you start to feel bored or annoyed. Forcing yourself to like the game just "because it's Fallout" might probably be not worth it.
---
I've never been into min/maxing a character. I like to be flexible even at the cost of damage/resistance. But so far I've alway reached my goals. 
---
Lolz
---
Or, to say it in the words of a similar thread that was about Gears:
---
I can craft a nuclear reactor from scratch, but i can not form metal into a shape that is round?
---
okay.
---
If you died near another player. They could have picked up your loot. Then you will not see a marker for you bag location. When someone picks up even one item for your loot bag a notification will pop up at the top of your screen. Saying that your loot was picked up by another player. 
---
Both, two types i believe.
---
I got scared halfway up and put my pa on. I did indeed fall off from a great height about 3 seconds later!
---
The arseholes have always been there lol. Its just boredom making then come out of the woodwork. Idle hands and all that.
---
Mjesticbattlecat
---
Well, I was mainly talking about the weapons before any Legendary effect is taken into account. With the right combination of Legendary effects I'm sure even a Pool Cue could end up being useful in some situations, but speaking generally it's not really up there on the list of good gear. 
---
That said, congratulations on the laser gun, Vault Dweller! 
---
Negative impacts on the economy???? What economy?  It is worse than zero sum as an economy.  200 cap limits on 24 hour timers.....there is no economy in this game.....just grind.  You either PvP or exploit to progress for those of us who play the game normally we are economically disadvantaged because of your "economy".  And while we are at it, why the hell does the weight of an item have anything to do with server workload.  One would have thought it had to do with the number of items, not the weight of them.....lol.
---
Also, does that mean that serum recipes can also be found on regular SBs too? 
---
What's the deal with the giant head in the caves? Anyone got an explanation for that?
---
I just posted a possible solution.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ayakcm/powered_door_keypad_access_how_to_make_it_work/
---
My friend watched run and fail the miltary obstacle course quest multiple times. He was yelling at me like a drill instructor because I kept falling off the beams. Took 4 tries but was hilarious.
---
Also when we discovered the helipad after taking over Grafton steel mill, very cool.
---
I used the build for efficiency. 
---
A whole water farm , crops and a junk extractor. 
---
Then it got old. I had more water and junk and food than I needed. 
---
So I started building on existing in game structures. I find it more satisfying. Plus incorporating existing structures allows you to build compounds, which I'm fond of.
---
Get this all the time
---
I had this thought the other day while I was working (I Work in a workshop type place) and realized that FUCKING EVERYTHING has screws in it.... They should make most junk include screws, because in real life, most things are held together with screws...
---
Are you too stupid to understand context? I don't understand how you can take me saying it's a studio and linking the studio's wiki page as trying to source something related to that studio as a fact with wiki as proof. I'm firmly convinced you're one of the most ignorant people I've ever spoken to on reddit in my 6 years of being here. Congrats on that award.
---
A bench on which you can scrap things could be welcome too.
---
Too rapid spoiling of the components and finished products is also a key problem here.
---
Components should spoil after 2-3 days, not 20-30 minutes of playing
---
Finished products should last at least a week
---
Yes, I know there is a Perk to slow down the decay, but with all the other mandatory Perks just so you can play why make everything about Perks. We have no Perk packs to quickly shift for combat and having way too much mandatory QoL perks is just poor planning.
---
Also if I kill a 1000 pound flying bat I should get more than a single slice of meat. I'm no butcher, but even I could carve at least 20-50 pounds of usable meat from that size carcass.
---
Two generators are not needed. Here is my method. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ayakcm/powered_door_keypad_access_how_to_make_it_work/
---
I collected every crossbow I saw hoping to get mods. 
---
After breaking down 10-15 of them, I figured there were none and my little bubble burst.
---
Never actually a legendary crossbow either, myself anyway.
---
Here is a possible solution. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ayakcm/powered_door_keypad_access_how_to_make_it_work/
---
So the situation here is that Fo76 players just can’t get screwing to happen, and it doesn’t make any sense to them?
---
Not necessary.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ayakcm/powered_door_keypad_access_how_to_make_it_work/
---
Glad I am not the only one who notice this and it is really pathethic how hard they push it. I guess this is another reason that Bethesda is going down the drain (with Bioware) in comparison to developers like CD project red who has the integrity to put their actual game before idiological politics.
---
Don't keep your purifiers outside. They're easier to be destroyed by mobs/griefers/etc. Also, if you build them inside, you only need to lock a door, instead of multiple purifiers. 
---
Do NOT claim workshops. They're nothing but killboxes for griefers. 
---
This would be great. I love camp building and hate having to choose between a beautiful, permanent home in a nice location or the many conveniences of a mobile base.
---
Sure. And you can actually do that, if you want... it's entirely possible to play as a gray hared old person. 
---
You choosing not to do that is on you. 
---
You have _insanely_ good luck so far? I've had a never-ending issue with griefers in this game. 
---
Maybe a Hand-Crossbow (single handed) that can shoot grappling hooks?!   
---
I can easily say this would be heavily used.   Not sure what could be done for potential exploits using this though.  I understand the fast travel mat for camps was removed due to exploiting though.
---
my camp is a large tent with utilities around it :)
---
better yet, would be a flag so you could return to the place you were before fast traveling to your camp; also scrapping/vending ammo, scrapping weapons and armor returning the components used for building them, recovering used mods ...
---
Don't. Claim. Workshops. They are NOTHING but killboxes for the lowest form of shit-heal griefer. 
---
Find a lead node in the world and put your camp on it. Farm locations with a lot of lead. Go to low level areas where mobs use bullets you use and farm them with melee weapons/junk guns. 
---
The workshops have ALWAYS been garbage, due to the absolutely insane decision to make them a PVP mechanic (It removes pacifist mode, it removes the slap damage. You claim a workshop, you're signing up to be murdered by some bored sociopath who probably has some dead kittens in his basement). 
---
And it's gotten less and less worth it. less stuff, harder to defend...it's a joke. 
---
and they never really played the game...
---
I wanna make a mixtape of all my favorite songs so I don’t have to hear “I didn’t know the gun was loaded” all the god damn time 
---
This is an absolutely nutty assumption. These people don't do this because they enjoy PVP. They do it because they enjoy torturing people who don't WANT to PVP. 
---
I reported every one of those posts with using the rules of "Bethesda Pls", but I doubt anything ever happened.
---
This is actually so common of an issue that I refuse to play with people who don't get on the mic to prove to me they aren't a child. So many kids try to lie in messages because I'm sure they get denied quite a bit by adults. I just don't enjoy the immaturity and the recklessness that kids tend to display. Plus I shouldn't have to sensor myself on the mic just because someones parent ignored the esrb. 
---
"for the first time" you don't lurk much, do you? And super mutants don't drop like "5 each". I can take out a pack of five and be lucky to get twenty screws. 
---
While you are at it, tell them to include Purified Water in the cooking list. It makes no sense at all that we can use boiled water but not the purified stuff. At the very least we should be allowed to turn it into boiled water.
---
Plus, the amount of food and water we have to chow down in a single in game day is insane. Yes, yes, survival and all that but anyone having that much food and water would explode after a day, tops.
---
Plus as a buyer, there is no guarantee you will receive said ammo.  You just bought an expensive piece of junk.
---
Can't imagine it's luck. I'm right by watoga station, setup like a BoS camp. Easily seen in a high traffic area 🤷
---
People frequently drop spare ammo/crafting items at watoga and whitesprings, and just about anywhere else they happen to be. 
---
So you get troll messages like all over this reddit but inside the game?  Awesome!
---
"Bethesda pls", "TSE Nerf", and "I quit" messages flooding me more invasive inside the game itself?
---
As long as they have a "block everyone" ability, but then whats the point of the terminal?  Decoration?
---
Watoga station I think gets most "donations". But it would be level 35 up. Still worth checking out but do' Mayor for a day quest' asap then most of the robots will be friendly to you. Most - not all.
---
Be sure to tag it for search, too. You'd be shocked at some of the junk you walk over that has it for some reason. Check out highschool cafeterias for trays, and kitchens for baking pans and aluminum cans. Look in garage type areas for the various oil containers, a couple types are aluminum. Coolant caps from AC units. 
---
   
---
I fell (and died) three times .. 
---
So whats to stop someone from "borrowing" the caps, blocking all 3 of you guys and then changing servers?
---
I'm more remote than you and I get semi-frequently. 
---
There is *MASSIVE* room for expansion and rework of cooking, including adding perks for it.
---
You can hide the quests. Pipboy-&gt;Data, main, side, daily, and click them on/off.
---
It's easily fixable. By bethesda. They choose not to. 
---
You remove quest display by clicking the quest in the quest section of the pipboy
---
ty
---
Awesome Thank you! Gonna be doing some serious scavenging later today 
---
Go into pip boy, select quests. Then simply select each quest that is marked with a square next to it . This means it is active. By clicking on it and removing the marker it makes it inactive, and wont show on your screen.
---
Just keep the quest you are working on active, or have all inactive if you are not questing.
---
I tried fruitlessly to get as high as possible for maybe a hidden achievement.
---
They'd have to license new songs and that's expensive. I doubt they'll do that any time soon unless the game takes off and sells enough to make them a net profit.
---
I'd be fine with Beth just allowing us to play mp3s or whatever from our comps/consoles. Sure, I could just stream a radio or run a player of choice in the back but I prefer to have nothing running in the back when I'm gaming. 
---
A large metal bucket/car door attached to a wheel pulley that shows your character pulling on the rope as you go up would be a good addition!
---
This is the new PvP meta currently.
---
Griefing workshops is easy because you don't have to have the other player shoot back, as long as the player owns the workshop he is open to PvP anytime if someone wants to just claim and run and hide then shoot you when you
---
Oh least expect.
---
Or they will wave and stand next to the workbench act cool and when your not paying attention try claim and instant shoot you dead.
---
Sorry to hear man if you need ammo I always have shit loads I'm on PS4 😋
---
Can we just have the single foundation with central stairs as in FO4?  
---
I currently have a 2 foundation base with stairs up to a second floor, which is 3x4, with all crafting stations, bed and various other extras (including the Mothman statue!).
---
I mean, honestly, 1 cap per round is a terrible deal
---
You see there?  \*That\* is the type of stuff this game needs.  Useable decorations like improvised stairs like this!
---
I say nice work (even though I have not seen it).
---
You do know you can't sue over a joke, right? Like, you'd get laughed out of court, and then get counter sued for legal expenses? 
---
It would be a complete waste of everyone's time and you'd be traveled to and 1-shot killed the second anyone saw you typing.
---
The top is pretty cool, not much up there though. 
---
I’m on Xbox unfortunately! :(
---
I've had a few of these health drops without any enemy or toxic source nearby, but I haven't noticed any figures.
---
One thing I noticed since the last update though is, that sometimes I don't see other players - even if they're in my team. Like, no, player model, no name tag no arrow indicating their, position etc.
---
Maybe it's something like this, where you have that 'invisible other player' bug, and some of them just attack(?).
---
All DLC announced will release on the 12th.
---
There is no need to "drip feed" content, all DLC is free and released in full on the dates announced.
---
It's regular free updates to keep the community keen and wanting more.
---
Going into this game I read so many people say they never dealt with griefers, my experience has been the complete opposite. I finally moved my camp all the way out in the mire, done dealing with people.
---
Heh, I do this all the time, bulk and realize it would be better used to make armors instead for learning mobs.  So... De-bulk them.  Bye bye plastic.
---
Thank You. Time to cash in those 30 plus maps i got
---
It reminds too much of the Destiny subreddit, every other post was 'Bungie plz' it gets annoying.
---
Build a cave base using concrete foundations as you can stack them.
---
Put your valuable stuff inside the base and benches and shit outside that you don't care bout.
---
Concrete foundations are indestructible 😋 there's YouTube vids on how to stack and use them.
---
Happy camping mate 😊😎
---
You can't use the word that the acronym is based on IN the acronym!! That is just.......

*autism intensifies*
---
&gt;There actually is things you can get up there.  If looking for a Power-Fist, there is guaranteed one to spawn on the desk at the top (leveled up to your level).  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Plus there is a note (or two) about some guy living up there; little bit of story.
---
Meh. That's what workshops are for. 
---
Yep, if you get one, it will glitch and reward you with them all 
---
If he ever just stops all you have to do is go up to him and push the Interact button and he will greet you and then continue his route.
---
I've never failed to complete one, I have to do that maybe 6 times each event with him. He's super buggy.
---

---
I would love to see that.
---
I found lots of little things the dev team put in but I wanted to get all the way up. Like into the trees. Like a leaf on the wind.
---
Problem is moving a CAMP.  Mine is complex because I crafted it around the landscape.  I know I will never be able to move it. I would have to move it once to get it all stashed, then break apart everything to get all the components and rebuild the whole place.   
---
Er...  I don't want to waste an hour of my time because some jerkoff wanted to grief someone.   
---
Yes, I know you can place a single foundation down and build ladders up from that and have a "Floating" base basically.  But I really dont like that option.  I like nice looking bases.   I should not be forced into doing this all "janky" to prevent griefing.
---
I've found some glowing frogs around flatwoods/overseer camp area, they give uranium (turn to nuclear material)
---
&gt;We want to be sure any direction we take does not have negative impacts on the economy
---
Well that's a first. Also a bullshit excuse unless you have a few economists in there arguing over it. 
---
I see.  I was not brave enough to try that.  I had to go up 3 seperate occasions to look for the power fist... by that time, I was done with the climbing exercise.
---
Hornwrite testing site#03 (next to vault 63) has a load of iron nodes. Excavator armour, supeduper Perk you can get 400-500 steel in amount 10 minutes. 
---
Instead of a Pylon switch, place a floor trap/trigger.  It will open the door and close automatically right after.   Its way more than enough time to exit though.
---
It's worth climbing about. I was able to get up into some trees with flatter branches but couldn't navigate to an actual treetop.
---
Avoid the munitions factory, you WILL have the workshop contested all the time. 
---
Getting ammo yourself is really not that hard.
---
Clear out the Lucky Hole Mine (preferrably in the Excavator PA since it's lead ore), Charleston Fire Station and the Hornwright Estate for lead. Run the Big Bend tunnel and scrap all the weapons the scorched drop for steel. Go to West-Tek, the Generals Steakhouse, Summerville or any other place with a high mutie population for gunpowder and more steel from scrapped weapons. Dropping muties also nets you caps, so that's another benefit.
---
Do this, equip SD and Ammosmith and you'll easily have a couple hundred rounds of the ammo you need.
---
I do this run every couple of days and it takes an hour tops. Plus, West-Tek the Hornwright Estate and the Generals Steakhouse have high level enemies and a chance for legendaries, so that's another benefit. Be careful in West-Tek though, the mutie population is dense and if they gang up on you it's bad news. :)
---
Also, don't let assholes ruin your game. They are the minority and if they annoy you, hop servers. 
---
All working as Bethesda intended
---
Where is that? 
---
I found it funny. Took low level and myself to top of world. Rock climbing to make it quicker. Scorchbeast appears as we are 20 stories up on a foot wide ledge. Jump or get killed. I jumped n died. Also I'll be damned if that scorchbeast is going to get me. Showed that sometimes the game is a cunt, at least went out on my terms. friend just shit himself and got murdered by beast. Fond wasteland memories
---
You are playing the game wrong, at least regarding ammo. Do not capture workshops at all but hunt for low level enemies in The Forrest and then scrap their weapons. Go to the *Lucky Hole Mine* and mine Lead Ore with Excavator Power armor. Find Abraxo and Cloth all around. Use Ammosmith 2 and Super Duper 3, and craft ammo.
---
I haven't been griefed because my camp is unremarkable (Also I'm on PC so they can't just follow me around.) No turrets, no walls, no floors, no signs; nothing that could attract attention. It is close to a strategic farming location so I can fast travel cheaply between certain major zones. 
---
This is happening because for Melee builds it’s already the case that things are super easy. Everyone else just wants to bring the rest of the game in line with Melee.
---
Either make is as easy for ranged dps. . . Or. . . . NERF MELEE
---
Really loved reading this mate, so glad you're enjoying the game like this. The holotapes are undoubtedly one of my favourite things too. Just listening to stories while soaking in the atmosphere - it helps me relax.
---
Look at his post history guys, he's lying.

I got them from the sons of Dane compound event. 
---
Two Shot is still overpowered!  It multiplies everything!
---
If the damage was purely calculated based on the \*base\* damage of the weapon and then \*added\* to the total, you would be correct.
---
Thus Two Shot calculated as 100 base damage X 0.25 = 25 dmg.   Then added that to 100 for a total of 125.
---
Then calculate Rifleman Perk as 100 X .10 = 10 dmg and Add that to 125 for a total of 135. 
---
This would fix everything!   TSE would be scaled down again to be more competitive to other weapons.
---
But that is not currently the way it works.   Its 100 x 1.25 x 1.10 = 137.5 dmg.
---
So you see just with this very simple difference, that the Two Shot already added 2.5 more damage off augmenting the Rifleman perk alone.
---
Good side you got to keep all you looted. The side I'm going to sound like an asshole, you should have leveled up more. That cave was big and I'll be going down it again one day but that mission wasn't that hard and I failed it the first two times because of the level I was at. So I did it three times, yes my choice, but still.
---
Great post! Am I the only idiot that runs Good With Salt level 2 consistently just to keep my food aaround?
---
Agreed!   Nocturnal is pointless to have really.  You are already penalized by not having the bonus half the time where every other legendary effect gives you something all the time.
---
Its insulting to make it \*worse\* than player crafted weapon when you do not get bonus.
---
[https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
That's far as we can go at the moment.
---
Hey man, totally understand your frustration, there are certain moments when a DC hurts more than thousand other less critical disconnects.
---
If you are on PC, I can provide fire support. I am 100% sure we will get it done in 30 minutes. The scorchbeast room in that cavern is one of the best sources of high quality meat in this game. I frequently farm it for meat. It takes me around 5 minutes to reach the final room now.
---
I also understand that people might want to finish their quests on their own, without any form of taxi, but frankly, I do believe you already kinda finished it and the only thing you should do would be to play the beacon that is placed around 25 meters from the scorchedbeast spawn.
---
The true Chu-ko-nu roleplay!
---
Plans can easily be farmed by completing events....
---
Just scroll on by...
---
I used to always have problems getting screws and springs. Here's what I did to fix it: Find an interactive online map. website. Disable all markers EXCEPT junk piles. Find one near the center of the map and build your CAMP on it. If you can find one with a nearby source of water, take that in preference over all else. Also, when you login to a server, grab the two junkyard workshops. 
---
Well, it's easier to make ammo with lead and iron... Just server hop 2-3 times in the Charleston fire department building, farm the weight in the gym room and that's it.
---
Nah I'm not that worried about griefers lol
---
I beliebe I got mine from the vendor with the bearskin rug at Whitespring. He usually has a lot of plans. 
---
I am level 265. I have an exorbinant amount of duplicate cards from packs. I just want hem gone to organize easier. IDC if we just had a delete option. That would be better than all these extras
---
Back during the BETA a friend watched and listened to me repeatedly die trying to 1v1 kill a Level 50 Legendary Glowing One when I was only like Level 17 myself. 
---
Both of us just laughing our asses off in our private voice chat trying to come up with different ways for me to try and kill it. 
---
In the end I think I died like 6 times before I finally managed to kill it. 
---
The winning strategy was every explosive device I could get my hands on, a shotgun, and prayer. 
---
That was the most hilarious and fun experience I’ve had in the game. Sadly had to quit playing shortly after that due to irl stuff but hoping to get back into it now. 
---
I heard that shotguns are unique for the Two Shot due to the number of "shots" that the penalty is more severe, but I have no proof of this.  (i.e. for more chances for shots on primary and two shot to miss)
---
Im wiriting this from a perspective of experienced player who does not have any issues with gathering stuff to repair his weapons and armor.
---
The detoriation of items is completely unsatisfying. I think the default rate of item detoriation should be as currently is with maxed out related perks. I think that having these perks should mean you are sacrificing some of your raw damage output for the QoL improvement that allows you repair your guns once or twice for week of gameplay. Alternatively, add 5% damage/armor bonus for each level of the perk card that currently only influences detoriation rate. As it is now - you either have perks, or you repair your guns every 15 minutes. This is not a survival challenge. This is forcing particular, boring build choices.
---
I managed to get my door working, I just have wired everywhere making my camp look shite.
---
I really need to find the plans for the connectors so I can install some decent lighting.
---
Ran out of game to play a long while ago. 
---
Great idea but  I am sure at most 25% of these ppl will ever come back. Much like the pawn shop business IRL
---
If they had private servers on release this could all be fixed (only playing with other filthy casuals).
---
At least in Fallout 4 the Overdue books had a purpose
---
I had a campsite I loved, but an asshole decided he didnt like it. I killed him a few times, so he started destroying it when I was away, until I finally moved it.  Assholes are a pretty significsnt component of this game, as with any MMORPG, aparently.
---
I've been there a few times and he only has 3 Plans. Bearskin rug, walking cane and like baseball bat or something like that. 
---
Look for the Brick Building Set (brick walls) at the Harpers Ferry vender.
---
Nothing up there except a dead NPC and a note stating how glad she was to reach it. Another useless adventure in my book
---
I also want/need to be  able to place common items as deco like FO4
---
I suggested being abke to make screws a little while ago and got barrated by some guy who said i just "didnt know how to play the game" his argument was that he goes on a 15 minute screw/spring run everyday and gets his 40 screws from it and everyone else should just do exactly the same becuase thats how your supposed to play the game
---
Thank you for taking the time to suggest this mate. I'll make sure the devs are aware of this thread &amp; the suggestions you raised.
---
My prediction is that it will be a 3-for-1 roll system. Put in 3 guns with the same base type and 1 star, you get a random reroll on prefix. Put in 3 different guns, get a random new gun. Put in mixed star items, you get a chance to get a 1-3\* item back. Put in mixed item types, get a random item.
---
Irrelevant question
---
Scrapping Ammo for lead etc. is surely the best option and helps solve two significant issues with the game loop currently.
---
yeah they are a few asses out there, but I have say for the most part it has been a nice interaction with other players. the next time you have a problem like that just change the server you are on. 
---
You can, if you like recursion. 
---
It takes about 30-60 seconds for another player to actually kill you without doing anything.  Just standing there.
---
Use a stim every 20-30 seconds and it becomes almost impossible for them to kill you.   Problem is your expending stims.
---
Do what I do, block them and change servers right away.
---
There is no defense right now against griefers targeting CAMPs.   I saw in the in the notes somewhere, they are looking at the problem with CAMPs being damaged while people are in pacifist mode.   Perhaps this might be a good change for the future, as long as CAMPs are forbiddden from the whitesprings golf course.
---
Or dropping an item on accident and the bag poofs. 
---
I think somewhere close to the Mire, or where that big tentacle monster is.
---
The community needs to be jailed for the sake of me.
---
The only two issues I care about are the freezing non responsive thing and the disconnects. Fix those and IDGAF what they do. 
---
Still fuckin banned and still no response:/ no new content for me..
---
These ppl have ruined the game. PvP servers can't go live quick enough. I have certain players blocked because of this but still they seem to find me and my CAMP quite often. If you are PC maybe you have come across TacoCatRacecar or Ooonce
---
Is this not the Powered Door Plans? I bought mine from Grahm. The Brick Building Set should be available from a few Vendors though.
---
I like it, lest hope the fallout gods are listening and the do stuff like that, and we all know that we have enough places on the map that can be used as future content
---
Yeaaaahhh.. I was trying to read that above as well and finally just gave up.
---
I personally love the crossbow as well. Thank you for sharing baldchow - the dev team has been made aware of your suggestion!
---
So you're ok with being bullied to leave the sever?
---
Agreed.  I don't even let my 12 year old daughter play it.  Even though I technically consider her "mature".
---
Its a dark/depressing/apocolyptic game.   Rather have her playing SIMS 4 (if they removed the sex/baby) stuff.
---
i throw screws away because i have hundreds and my stash needs to store harder to get items.
---
Farm Whitesprings, the lockets/lighters that most of the ghouls drop are a good supply of springs and screws
---
make a floating base it will halp you move your base, I have the same problem about 2 months ago I couldnt move my base or I would had to build it from scratch, but after i did a floating base i haven had any problems to move it.
---
Just fucking normal text chat... How can text chat be detrimental to game play?? 
---
Wow.  Can you imagine the 250% damage resistance on say... The Dragon?
---
Living hand to mouth on screws. Grim times.
---
Thanks for replying! Most definitely, actually understanding the quest because I’ve listened to the holo tapes has made the game way more immersive for me. 
---
its a combination off things, perks, mutations, food. I have and super sledge that does 360 with no mutations or food just perk cards and im not finishing my build yet. 
---
I'm an engineer in training and screws are so easy to make, easier than a gun so I completely agree.
---
It's dumb but these players are a small minority. I don't think you should have to leave to deal with their shittiness, it's just the best way to deal with it right now. I thought I'd read somewhere they were changing pacifist to be 0 damage instead of slap though so you might have that to look forward too.
---
I own one. You can charge it to 20. The quad does nothing if you don't charge the weapon and only fire's once. 
---
I'm lvl 92 and here is [my all around build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7a3798c&amp;d=c72cu0cm0cr0ic4i12ip0sd0sa2sv0s01pd0pk2pl1pp2p00el1ep0as2a72a80a00l30lv0lt1l10ls0l71lr0l40la0lu0&amp;w=&amp;n=Normal). You can use basically all kinds of weapon because you have enough special points to equip all kinds of perk cards. But to use meelee you will probably want to use Power Armor. And still, it is good for lower lvl areas. Not likely you're going into a Silo only with a Super Sledge. For your hi-dmg needs the build is best used with rifles (you can swap rifleman for the automatic perks if you need). You can tweak the perk cards for better dmg by upgrading better criticals, bloody mess,  and etc.  
---
I always carry with me my .50 cal machine gune, a Gatling Plasma, a handmade rifle, TS Hunting Rifle, All Rise and a TS Tesla Rifle (for shooting through packs). Of course for that i need Excavator PA with 2x Calibrated Shocks heh  
---
The only thing you won't be able to use properly with this build is Power First and etc because of not as much strength (without PA) and low Endurance.  
---
If you don't care about you can get some mutations. I mostly use Marsupial+Speed Demon and since i've been using less and less melee, Eagle Eyes.
---
Thank you for the info.
---
No I am not.  I think its horrid game design.
---
I am just giving option and what I do because I know its pointless to try and fight them. Wastes your time and resources.
---
Since the game at its current situation is what it is... I do that as the quickest way to resolve the issue and know that I will never see that player again.  (PC allows perma-block and session block)
---
Side Note: I don't like PVP. 
---
Yeah on the day the game released I started a new character and saw like 3. 
---
Pacifist mode point is that you can't trigger PVP mode accidentally in crowded events. If you decide in life to turn vegan mode on, that doesn't mean world now stops producing meat. Why the f\*ck you stay and wait, jump server if you already know you aren't capable handling the situation. Even better, block player and then jump server. There is reason why they gave you blocking option.
---
Or being able to mod them so its like attached to helmet and can use them with a hotkey instead of equipping them to use.
---
No sarcasm here, just number one Fallout 76 fan in USA :)
---
Not a perfect solution but I made a guide on how to do this without using campfires: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ar31ca/my_rooftop_garden_how_to_place_crops_indoors/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Happens all the time to me
---
That does piss me off but players boosting levels in the huts really pisses me off
---
Everything Is good but xxT0ddH0wardxx is too much for me xD
---
Suppose that was an after thought for me as I was finishing up my post. I realised this would have been common in the early Game. I guess I was just excited to be back in the Vault after being outside for so long.
---
How you know dat?
---
Depends on your build
---
Which perks do I need for a bloodied buildt?
---
Should have saw the cluster in the vault that was beta day 1.........good times
---
I bet those servers were mighty stable /s
---
Anytime buddy :) Love to interact with you all here.
---
I’d say his location is a little clue how he got to that level lol 
---
No, I think you do have a point. Being more prepared to go faster through something like that does mean fewer chances for the game to crash. So I probably will do some leveling up before returning. I guess I’m just getting a little tired of the disconnects happening during such critical moments, and they just throw off all of the immersion and wonder involved with such a rich world that I wish I could spend more time in.
---
That would be beautiful!
---
Toss in phreaking to avoid the long distance cap surcharge, classic modem beeps and static before logging in, ASCII art, and host pirated holotapes for download by the non-leeches.  And then my dreams of gleaming the cube and hacking the planet might live again.
---
Dude the single player games froze all the time, not to mention save breaking bugs that would require reverting many saves back... (i barely disconnect nor do all my friends)
---
I couldn't honestly tell half the time, sometimes I was able to play the full beta time, other times my junk ISP dropped me.
---
Hello Kitty Adventure Island is that way
---
Maybe there are good and bad servers? My internet is pretty strong and most servers I'm on are stable. Sometimes I get a duff server and it gives me hell until I finally discon.     
---
Are the servers more stable now since the BETA?
---
I sold my favourite weapon once. I had a mild heart attack and lost 1000 caps.
---
And spings!!! 
---
With enemy type specification gear they should introduce raids that actual need these. Like in old times in WoW, where you had to actually invest into elemental defense armors to take down monster that had specific elemental attack . With current game, even if they boosted these armor to 1000% I wouldn't use them, there just aint point to use them. 
---
I think you might be on to something there. 
---
 I definitely had less server related disconnects back in beta. But from then till where we are now it's greatly improved.
---
Shoot, I’m on Xbox, though that does sound fun! I personally am more of a lone wanderer myself though, and I do like to be challenged by taking on things a little earlier than I am perhaps meant to. So maybe it did take me longer than it could have. I wouldn’t have any problems if it would just spawn me back where I was instead of outside the cave with all my progress reset. The disconnects don’t really even bother me too much otherwise. Just these moments make it hard to keep coming back.
---
Blocking doesn't mean anything if they knew where your CAMP location. Blocking doesn't even guarantee you that you wont end up in the same server as them the next time you play. All blocking does is hiding you from their map. I just noticed this after blocking some people and then one day I was looking through "SOCIAL" list on my map and saw some people blocked (their names greyed). I remember their names because they were attacking me for no reason in Whitespring Bunker. And wondering why we are in the same server...
---
When I went up there the items weren't worth it to me personally. Made it a goal to get on top regardless. 
---
Apparently changes to how PvP works are planned at some point in the future:
---

---
So negative. 
---
might have done the grenade XP exploit to get there.....only way to be sure is to get a screenshot of the total hours played.
---
make it stack with SuperDuper.
---
Me and my mates climbed up there once. It was hilarious watching them fall and die while I, power armour had better parkour skills.
---
IT'S such a nice place at the top. I wanted to make a boss up there, took a nice screenshot of the tire swing
---
Yea , during the beta period ! There were always 3 - 5  ppl in the vault.
---
I might be supportive of a single-use perk respec in cases where a perk was adversely affected. However, to totally upend the existing system because one or two perks were balanced seems extreme to me. 
---
The legendary vendor/respec system is going to be a lot like the special respec and the perk card system. It will not be free, it will require work to obtain the desired result.
---
So quad capacity loads all four bolts?   Yikes
---
Dang, I'm going to be honest, I'm all for the game being easier but I think I see your problem. Bethesda level scaling is made to scale with your level and a lot of perk cards are combat based. With your distribution of perk cards and S.P.E.C.I.A.L points you aren't completely combat focused but Bethesda's leveling system assumes you are. Also pistols aren't as viable in the late game as rifles, I suggest switching. My summary is switch to rifles and take more combat focused perks.
---
Might help if you said which Platform
---
I forgot about that one. It would solve the falling odf the side problem, and still only need to be a 1x2 if you did multiple flights.
---
Got it, thank you. I'm aware of my current options, but would prefer to see changes made, the sooner the better.
---
Shhhhh. Todd solved the PvP problem. He said do in the making of documentary.
---
Melee needs that extra damage since you have to be right in your enemy's face to do anything. With ranged weapons, you've got the advantage of.. range, duh... 
---
And besides, the time-to-kill when it comes to tanky enemies is much better on an automatic weapon than on a melee weapon. And then there's flying scorchbeasts... good luck melee users...
---
Any turret camp directly behind the golf course is a valid target, especially if the player it belongs to isn't even in it.
---
You're not the only one trying to farm the WS and your turrets are effectively luring the ghouls out back, ruining it for stealth builds. 
---
I really wish Beth would get their act together and expand the no build zone at the WS to make it impossible to build these annoying things right at the top farming spot.
---
Yesterday was the first time since beta that I received the "Server not Responding, Controls have been temporarily disabled" message.
---
Although I’ve probably only put 20 hours in, maybe not even that, the 8 or so people I’ve come across we’re all either nice or just ignored me. So that’s a pretty good statistic haha. Also one dropped me a couple of plans and other random shit.

Being honest, I was at first finding it very hard to get any enjoyment out of the game. Sure it’s nice to wander, but that became boring fast. However last night I was doing to quests up the top theme park area, and found myself more interested. Not to mention I collected myself my first set of power armour. I don’t know, it’s got some positives, and for me if I’m in the right frame of mind then I can find enjoyment. I just wish there were human npcs alive, that would really take the sense of loneliness away, which I think is the heart of the problem for me.
---
Still, I’m early days yet, a mere level 9 trudging about completing the odd quest here and there. 
---
http://imgur.com/a/SpmfjR1 he had me take a picture. Though because his setup is in an existing tower, it's a top down through the entry hole in the roof.
---
Sure!  I'll post a picture when I'm out of work.   Its pretty cool
---
Boosting levels in the huts?
---
Agree completely.
---
And I just bought the Vault-Tec skin for leather. Makes it look shiny purple. Not only on myself but on everyone elses characters. Known bug?
---
I've never once set out to farm legendaries and I'm only at Whitesprings because you people won't nuke anywhere else.
---
Swing and a miss at the condescension.
---
I know this will generate tons of hate.
---
my favorite memory of this game was at the height of the duping.
---
It was all about the game PLAY not the GRIND.
---
You know, that's fair.
---
Yes Mr. Moth man I can build you a lamp to if you want
---
I only take Mentats, I'm classy!
---
Yeah I'm hearing it now and you've got a point.
---
After getting every perk card at least once, is a main goal for me when it comes to level. The Platinum Trophy is another goal. 
---
Stopped reading at the 'set up base at whitespring with turrets' part. 
---
I've only been moving my base to repair my decon. Now I have it stored so never moving my base lol
---
Sooooo... a raider?
---
Incredible post, really. This is amazing stuff.
---
I think a number of fixes can be made to the crafting/repair mechanic, many of which you've covered. For me, combining the current system with that of Fallout 3 would sort so many issues. If I have a combat shotgun I should be able to use Another Combat Shotgun to repair it. By all means, retain the ability to use resources to repair items too, but make it marginally more prohibitive than using a duplicate item. On top of that, it adds a dilemma - do I scrap these guns I just looted at the tinkers bench I found, thus saving weight, or do I hold onto them to fix my own gun in a bit when I find a weapons table or return to camp?
---
Second, as you say, let us craft supposedly common items like screws, springs etc. I am sick of crawling the wastes looking for clipboards and fans, it's a detriment that instead of hunting a big beasty I'm running through the same areas over and over looking for the same few items, it saps the fun from a game where crafting plays a huge role. Also, let them drop when taking stuff apart. If I'm stripping a gun down, I'm not going to somehow destroy all the screws holding it together, am I?
---
Perks - scrapper especially - need tweaking. Steel &amp; wood are the most abundant resources around, there's no need for scrapper to give more steel at all. Have it affect "rarer" drops like screws, springs etc.
---
How about Y.U.R.T.S for the middle class, vegan single white, middle-aged women?
---
Your ultimate righteous temporary shelter.
---
This is the third time I've ever had anyone screw with my camp.
---
Fuck that guy and his lil bitty penis he rode in on. 
---
No I used the right one. They are PC while I'm ps4
---
Oh, Him?  That's Joe.  Cool guy.  
---
I'll have to start upping my perk cards for that. I just got to level 50 last week and it seems like I level up faster and care a lot less about it now that im maxed on my SPECIAL points. 
---
You'd be surprised how many grown men act like this. It's not a 12 year old exclusive thing
---
The stupidity of complaining about someone wrecking their WS base amazes me. You have ZERO valid reason to setup your base there UNLESS you use it kite the ghouls once they spawn. I bet you're the kind of person that complained about other people's bases there before, until you decided to become one of them. 
---
I have no idea why women continue to hang out with men who do this tbh
---
Would you mind elaborating a bit, I've only recently put my base there and don't really understand the issue. Do players not get experience if a turret kills the enemies, even if they got a hit on them prior 
---
Kids play this, Friday the 13th (I know because I've personally had the displeasure of listening to them gaining control of Jason on mics and trolling/calling people the n word non stop), GTA, Mortal Kombat and just about every other non kid friendly game you can think of.
---
Parents don't have to deal with parenting and the little shits leave them alone for a couple of hours so they can desperately attempt to save their sanity and crumbling marriage so I'm not entirely against it. It's sad for sure and non optimal but teaching your kids to read is a hell of a lot harder.
---
Link doesn't work. Regardless, player vending needs to be implemented sooner. Most people drop out of the game cause they can't interact with the others. Using reddit to buy and sell is just plain stupid and lazy.
---
Would would she message you an hour later to inform you she's a girl though? Maybe she saw this post?
---
No i don't, and that's exactly why I put it there, my build is pistol vats so I don't do crazy damage, having the turrets there helped me kill them easier. 
---
Happened to me today too. Lets just say..."It just works..."
---
Yeah floating camp isn't an option for me either. Mine is built like a BoS camp
---
Vault-tec had computers controlling certain vaults, the enclave could access the data and records, so could the Brotherhood of a Steel and eventually so could the player.  
---
Bethesda just chooses to ignore their own established lore. . . Or do they?  Nope everything wrong with fallout 76 is because we are all in memory loungers either in a place like vault 112 or Goodneighbor.
---
You can't complete a single quest in under 3 hours - you shouldn't be playing this game.
---
I don't know. I don't pvp and have been one shot killed while in passive mode, while at full health. I never take workshops. It is claimed that something flagged me, but no one can offer any explanation of how. This has been in the last week, so it was not explosive bobble head stacking. I will just be glad when they make the change that passive mode makes the player and their base totally immune to player damage. 
---
Does it work now? 
---
That sucks bro. I have had nothing but positive interactions with high level players so I feel for you man.  
---
&gt; I don't care if it's put in Two INT cards and get a new card, or put in five cards for a random card back, but there needs to be a way if getting rid of unwanted cards. 
---
Hell, I would be happy to get rid of unwanted cards even without nothing in return. 
---
Stopped reading at WS base guy.
---
You're not going to get much sympathy here being the exact type of player almost universally reviled by the community. Matter of fact lemme get your tag so I can wreck your base and you if I ever catch you on my server.
---
Yeah, but...then I’d have to deal with other players.  That’s the part of the game I like the least.
---
Still going to have to use Reddit. How often does someone find your camp and visit it? People will use Reddit to advertise, they just won't have to meet people in person to finalize the trade.
---
Nocturnal should be stripped. It is pointless, even if you boost it, players are now bound to server hop so that they armor could be useful-"Ohh this server has day, my armor is useless in day, let me switch servers. Ohh f#ck another day server, switch again".
---
They should go back to drawing boards and stop thinking with "Ohh, lets just import armor from our previous game and hope it works" and start thinking with "Ok, this is online game, we are bound to have group content, means people should fit different roles. Means different roles look for different attribute in armor and not all are bound to look for how to get best damage"... So when you play as melee in group you get high defense as you are in front lines to keep mobs away from ranged and as for that with full set you also gain some effect that slows mobs movements speed when being hit with melee. Those who want to play melee but do damage gets somekind of AoE swing instead of slow, or every 5th swing AoE pushes mobs back. Ranged gets mobility, lower defense and higher damage than melee, because it is melee job to crowd control mobs while ranged job is to do main damage. Support set maybe get bonuses from marking the targets and everyone who attacks market target does bonus damage to it or heals himself. 
---
It's too late, man. He's seen you.  He's marked a settlement on your map.  I hope I don't run into him. Yikes!
---
Yeah ok that makes more sense lol thanks.
---
I'm lucky enough to have the majority of mods unlocked for all the weapons I use and am slowly finishing off the remaining ones.
---
Getting platinum is a good goal to go for. I have this already. My routine when logging on is to do the rounds to all vendors then on to the daily challenges and then off to Camden Park for those Mr Fuzzy tokens.
---
Find a secluded lead deposit and build your base around it, then you won’t have to worry about griefers or ammo.
---
It does now
---
Hopefully once a vending machine is placed, the camp becomes visible on the map. 
---
You can only be under the influence of one drug at a time. Chems don't stack in 76.
---
Maybe if a person just stands still and lets someone with a sledge hammer wack them.  The guy running around in heavy armor and carrying an excessively heavy weapon would stand little to no chance against someone in light gear using a pistol or rifle.
---
But I suppose that’s why most modern militaries use heavy mechanized armor with rocket powered sledge hammers as weapons. . . . Oh wait.
---
Me too.  I can make all the jumpsuits and have the plans to upgrade them.   Won't be on until after work  4 est.  If you're still looking by then my gt is Abinsursec2814.   
---
Like I said numerous times before, there should be a trade network established via terminals at our camps where you can advertise your goods
---
If you think my base is bad I don't know what to tell you. Am I not allowed to level up my character ? Like I said I've had many randoms come along and game with me, some low level some high level and not once has anyone made a complaint. It clearly wasn't about my base killing things for him because that's just b's. Have you tested how long it takes a mg turret to kill a ghouls. My base was set up so you could run circles with the ghouls and hit them while the turrets plinked away at there health 
---
as it is right now, either change server or kill him
---
pacifist more should exclude all forms of pvp to make things fair
---
Hey bud. I'm xbox and I have the artillery plans. You can have a copy if you want. 
---
IF they get a hit in they get XP and loot. If they arrive while your turrets just finished up the last ghoul they get bugger all. 
---
And if a stealth build arrives, those friggin turret camps just ruined the chance to effectively clean the house and might even lead to them getting swarmed and overrun by the ghouls kited outside due to all the noise.
---
You have a choice. You build there and accept that we'll level your camp. You build there and use no turrets. You don't build there at all.
---
Beth allows building there. They also allow levelling camps.
---
You don’t need to heal yourself, just use radaway to get rid of radiation and let the bar fill up again. I recommend Emmet Mountain disposal site. You can stand by the nuclear waste barrels and get rads really fast, then use the decontamination arches to heal your rads. Gotta play smart not hard sometimes.
---
There is no real benefit to having your camp so close to whitesprings and both you and I know there is a high chance you’ll be ‘griefed’ if you park up there. 
---
They only listened with this game because as with vats, you can’t slow time in a multiplayer game.
---
You only get up if you personally tag the ghoul. If the turret does everything you get no xp. People do not like the bases because it lures all the mobs out of the building as they spawn. Your base basically screams that you are a selfish dick who thinks that all the mobs at that location are yours. 
---
I use a stealth build. I sneak through the building killing ghouls. Your base ruins that location for me. Thus, I have a TS Fatman for your base and a lack of around 30 mini nukes.
---
In the words of. Will Wheaton "Don't be a dick."
---
Using the fix all option with broken crops was a huge pain. I tried fortifying the garden every way possible. The final solution was a rooftop garden using the rugs. Never going back. 
---
Look up GNU
---
Lol, point taken ;)
---
&gt; . I'm really considering quitting, and I know, nobody cares
---
Well at least you know your pity party is inconsequential.
---
Every time someone complains about ammo I have to wonder what the hell they're doing. Ammo is made using the cheapest, most plentiful materials in the wasteland. Are you people standing in place, using no sneak or crits or vats or legendaries or anything besides throwing thousands of bullets at everything? This isn't Call of Duty.
---
Just quit already and find an easier game. 76 isn't for casuals apparently.
---
Maybe you abused the block so much that there just was no longer left server where wasn't people who you had not blocked.
---
Yeah wtf does that mean?
---
Yeah, that would be cool. Assassin's Creed origins did this for your main character which I always thought was interesting. More games need to explore that route.
---
Bring on the hate and downvotes.......but I don't get the problem with PVP. To me, it is just like finding a high level enemy.
---
If you were walking around the map and accidentally set off a scorched beast...you can't just turn on pacifist and say '*screw you scorchbeast you can't hurt me*' and just continue on your merry way. You have to use your wit and skills to get away from them.
---
**My tip for escaping PVP situation**: Get yourself 1 piece of chameleon armor and if you are getting harassed by a player, you switch to the Chameleon armor piece and run away out of site of the hunter and then crouch and go invisible and just wait for them to go away.
---
How do you even turn on pacifist mode? I’m pretty new and can’t see an option. Is it even an option? 
---
You knew what this game was before you got it. You knew that someone, if persistent enough, could kill you.
---
You should know that you can just block people, so they cannot see you on the map and I believe not get joined with you anymore on a server.
---
You complain about being 'bullied' out of a server, as if servers really matter. As if there is any sense of belonging to a server in FO76.
---
Agree with your points.  But let’s say your coming at me with your sledge hammer at full force, and I shoot you well before you reach me, the bullet penetrates your armor, do you thing your still coming at me with your full force?  I’ve never been shot, but from what I see in the news, when someone is hit even in nonvital areas, they tend to be out of commission, not still running around like the hulk.
---
Stay away from workshops if you don't do PVP.  There used to be bug where you can get PVP'd if away from workshop, not sure if that still exists or not.
---
Not sure why you want to lock up everything?  No one can take anything except from Water/Resource nodes.
---
Block his GT 1st, THEN server hop.
---
Yes, but if this was actually the wasteland OP could hire someone to kill that raider and bring them their head on a spike, problem solved.  
---
Not really any way to permanently deal with the issue in 76 rn.
---
Cranberries! We can plant Blackberries but not Cranberries? I NEED CRANBERRIES! Anything we can go pick from other places, we should be able to plant.
---
I don't think griefers will switch to PvP servers... :/
---
Launching a nuke is boring at best, although I'm having fun trying different guns in the silo lately. PC. You spend at least 15 minutes, 500-1000 rounds per run, a bunch of weapon condition; then just hit Prime and fail the queen, hit Whitesprings to get your kills stolen or glitching the club house out.
---
Also nuking for flora is somewhat unrewarding. I can harvest plants to get at best 18 stable violet flux and craft about 4200 ultracite 5mm rounds. The queen gives out 1 stable violet flux worth 180/230 ultracite rounds and you may harvest mats for perhaps one extra stable violet flux. Last time, I spent 800 ultracite rounds on her.
---
I have been one shot killed in the last week by a melee player. I run pacifist and never claim workshops. It has been said that I must have been flagged somehow. I am just interested in knowing the other ways one could be flagged. I did read a recent bethesda post that they are looking at pacifist make the player and their base totally immune to damage. I cannot wait for this to happen. I think they will have to do something like this for player vending. I have a lot of items that sell for a lot of caps on the market, but I would rather drop them in the high grass of cranberry bog than run a flag up at my base so every jerk in the game could locate me.
---
Rather then sell, please let us CONVERT ammo.
---
I am.  Never had any problem with it.  It happens rarely enough and the costs for leaving a server are minimal.  I'm happy to change servers if it means I no longer need to play fight with an agressive twelve year old.  
---
your link doesn't work.
---
so.... I don't think it is a Zetan.
---
Wonderful, thanks!
---
or cross server trading town
---
Yes, but you are still relegated to the 20 or so players on your server having the person looking for that particular item. Much better to advertise on Reddit and then have the person join your server to shop.
---
Disconnects in that cave are unfortunately common. But if someone hasn't already told you. There s no need to do entire quest chain from point to point again. You can ft to the cave and boogie to the end. I usually trip that one at v9 just for good measure. 
---
It's too bad there isn't an app or something in which I could view your inventory offline. I'll try to make it on sometime you're on, because I would love to check out your inventory of heavy guns. Thanks for accepting my friend request (I'm kesa0003)!
---
Griefer's paradise. People showing their camp's location willingly. I'd much rather have this idea that covers both questing and trading: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asvydu/simple_implementing_players_as_questgivers?sort=confidence
---
I get it sometimes, most likely due to temporal anti-aliasing problem I believe the game uses by default. Try changing/disabling AA.
---
Yeah I’m sitting on 500 screws at this point and my base isn’t on a junk extractor or anything. People that use ranged weapons wanna complain about guns being more expensive to fix but melee players armor gets damage more since they’re up close and personal so it’s pretty even imo. I’m a rifle build too. 
---
The problem is some of these people would play on beginner settings if it was a single player game and can’t cope with the medium difficulty of this game. 
---
Sure, both 
---
You can hit up watoga emergency services for a bunch of surgical trays which will probly help. I usually after that hit up AMS in the middle of watoga. I've just had experiences of finding tons of aluminum canisters in there as well
---
In reply to a post about making screws from steel you say:
---
&gt; I'll make sure the devs are aware of this *thread*.
---
Just couldn't resist, could you.
---
That'd be great. My gamertag is CurlyFreys.
---
Oxhorns a scrub 
---
Fair, what platform you on?
---
Try lowering the GPU core/memory frequency by 50-100 MHz.
---
Went in and saw two new players running around trying to play football on the ground floor. Miss those guys 
---
Yes. Go to the options, it's under gameplay I think.
---
Do you just need the plans for the power armor paint? I don't understand if it was armor you are looking or the paint plans. Let me know because I have it !
---
Do I though? 
---
lol, ok your win that one ;)
---
Sounds like a good idea but the same people who are likely to use this type of workshop are the same ones who will come crying once they get PvPed. 
---
Just seems like this would make the game too easy, it’s a survival game after all..
---
Pvp servers not fix this the chicken shit bastards that do this will spend 5 min in survival, get their shit pushed in and go back to adventure to be assholes again. 
---
There’s something that mole miners drop that gives you aluminum, I usually have 40+ after clearing black water mine during a Uranium Fever event.
---
Really good suggestions!
---
Oh I have that one. Just a lot of the quest ones were bugged too and I’m not replaying for them. The game should be able to recognize a completed quest and give access to the achievement. 
---
I’m sure they’ll implement that if you pay 9.99 in the shop 
---
^THIS
---
that's the reason why PvP mode won't change anything...those that actually want PvP already keep to the rules but griefers aren't interested in actual PvP they just want to ..well... "grief"
---
Seeing as how the DLC starts in just a few days it's probably now or never if you're wanna get back into it and have a decent amount of content coming on a regular basis for yourself. Hope you decide to join up with everyone again!
---
Wow people really need the /s. 
---
Are we still allowed to make fun of "moooom! pull the plug!" because this is next level rage quitting - begging the Dev's to completely change their art direction.
---
Obviously you're posting in bad faith and you're going to belligerently bring this up daily so i'm downvoting you for REEEEEposting this over and over and over.
---
A smart player would make friends to protect himself. You'd beg Bethesda to completely change their art style like "mom! Pull the plug!" LOL
---
Somebody's having a bad day. For the record I use mostly SMGs and automatic weapons, so that's why I have trouble holding onto ammo. You can shove the casual talk, I've probably been playing Fallout longer than you've been alive.
---
Umm actually I use it. Level 1 and it helps quite a bit. I use herbivore because soup is the bomb. I did not want to give up a spot for it so I just use level 1 and swap it out to pharma when I am indoors looting. 
---
I understand the whole nature of the game and I suppose pvp is a part of it to make it more realistic, but I am know I am not alone with hating pvp, never been a fan and there is a lot of content to enjoy without some asshole griefer killing me over and over just because they think it's fine. 
---
I very recently restarted playing the PC version and I am only level 7 right now, I do like the game world, but what I don't want to happen is be killed over and over again by some asshole. I'm not all that bothered right now if someone destroys my camp as I don't really have a build I use and it just a place to access my stash, but as I get further into the game I would like to think that I may come up with something.
---
They should have made PvE and PvP servers, where you can't kill someone on a PvE server at all, or damage their camp. 
---
Or just use a soundcard with voice modulation ;-)
---
Is the PB animation distracting enough that you’re defenseless or can they find your camp ?
---
Is that why you never PB while pvp?
---
Check the Warframe forums and you'll see it's the PETTIEST crap you can imagine. This is the danger when Bethesda sends reps to reddit - just endless whining. Expect it to just ramp up.
---
You met those oblivious idiots who are posting daily to bring down PVP and the ones who don't understand prestige will "fix" the perk cards? Welcome to their karma farm, this sub is going to suck.
---
On launch day when I woke up in Vault 76, I heard someone showering over the audio, but saw nobody in the entire vault. I heard footsteps too but saw no other player inside.
---
Just thank them for destroying your shit and tell them it means you get to pick up junk again, act happy about your things being destroyed and they usually fuck off
---
You’re gonna die in this game just try not to let it get you down and move on. There’s a starter zone in this game for a reason so I’d recommend staying around the forest area until you feel comfortable moving on, it’s okay to run away too no shame in that, pick your battles.
---
I just pick up things that gives screw, gear and plastic that's how u can fk around the map without worrying about it and when u need them u will have 300+
---
Queen raid : 10% with PA emergency protocols
---
Normal hunting : 10\~20% with any armor you want 
---
Prestige will change this it's been reposted 1000X please read the forum you deserve downvotes.
---
You're kidding, I thought psycho, mentats and buffout were all three different classes you could stack.  Well shoot.
---
I thought the vendor at the watoga train station had all the building plans. Those and the walking cane, for some odd reason
---
Others here have already said this is sorted out in 30 seconds by changing server.
---
It's also amazingly rare. 500+ hours here and I was griefed once. The massive majority if players are overly nice and hunt down low levels to give them items and help them.
---
Basically it's not important enough to prioritise over bug fixes or the roadmap that's already been provided.
---
Sucks its not powerful in 76, in 4 it was my preferred melee weapon until I found Krehims’ Tooth. That is a great weapon + poisoning dmg I think. 
---
There’s an acid “node” at the bottom of a pond south east of pleasant valley station. There’s a flower on the map basically right on top of it. If you aren’t looking down on the pond from the cliff next to it, or actually go underwater, you’d never see the acid node. I’ve had an acid extractor and two industrial water purifiers in that pond for the last 20-30 levels. It rarely gets attacked by anything other than a couple of dogs or the occasional lone ghoul. It’s a nice spot with some blood leaf and blackberries, and actually quite picturesque. 
---
I feel like it would just make more noise, not less. We'd still see the frequent requests and then I'd have to deal with a day of just that.
---
I see where you're coming from, but the CAMP was already made for this, you're meant to constantly move it. Having a static camp for too long is a recipe for repetitive gameplay. 
---
You’re ignoring everyone’s advice and repeating your mistakes.  Don’t take a workshop unless you’re prepared to PvP.
---
Also, since you’re always short on materials, I suspect you’re turning each workshop you claim into a Cadillac of workshops, with every bell and whistle available.  This cuts deeply into your personal inventory of materials!
---
If you insist on claiming a workshop, build only the bare minimum.
---
I'm gonna be honest....I have no idea who "came up" with the idea (aka brainfart) for the game to not have a text chat on PC...even after so many weeks after release
---
Even shortly after release a mod has been published which adds a better chat than what Bethesda could possibly bring...if only they would give their official ok to some QoL mods
---
&gt;Fact is, "Bethesda please" posts are the most constructive posts that occur. They have been effective. They got the dupers banned, they got us the stash size increases, among other things.
---
&gt;I get it, there are problems, and people want solutions. The reality is, they have a plan for the game, and probably won't be swayed by every dingus with a 'bright idea'.
---
OP and i disagree with you. Having Beth on this forum amounts to being babysat. Reddit has provided absolutely nothing of worth that the official forums haven't already.
---
Where are this sub's mods? They should simply delete "perk card" suggestions for being resposted. This is just a daily karma farm.
---
Cap unanswered slap damage and make bases immune to player damage.  Or add a challenge system.  Makes no sense to please the very few griefers in this game at the expense of the majority.  Doesn't matter how the game was presented or marketed at this point.  It's almost entirely a pve game.  
---
WS isn't that great for EXPing anymore. That got nerfed a while back. People just go there out of habit. The mob density is still good though.
---
I like to visit West Tek for my exp and legendary drops. There are number of other places people swear by. But it all comes down to mob density it seems.
---
West-Tek - lot's of supermutants, always some legendary inside.
---
What are physics.
---
Thanks, I see someone already there on my server, so I'll switch before I try it.  Don't want to cut in on anyone else's peaceful grind!
---
I claimed the Munitions Factory once in my mid-twenties in the hopes of plentiful ammo.  I kept it for the entire afternoon, and still spent more ammo clearing the enemies than the workshop produced.
---
Thanks, I'll check it out!
---
Exactly, it’s  sad to see this game lack so many basic features that have been standards in PC Games for 20 years. Hell am i the only one that finds a lack of a vsync option baffeling? 
---
What the actual fuck?
---
It's my first and last post related to this issue. I am myself PvP oriented and I am not interested in playing this non-PvP mode at all. I am just trying to look further than the tip of my nose and I do believe that a game franchise with twenty years of history is a problematic thing to do revolutions in - as we can see by the backlashes related to this particular topic.
---
Sorry dude but bad faith should be your nickname. What you wrote has no connection to reality.
---
If you have done Mayor for A Day then Watoga is my XP farm of choice. It's not the best on loot or XP but constant respawning mobs make for a steady flow and ready access to cranberries make for easy access to an XP boost.
---
No, it doesn't.
---
You - or anyone for that matter - can check this by opening the .esm in xEdit.
---
The condition 'IsSneaking' has to have a value of 0 \[FALSE\] for the damage mitigation to apply.
---
The clue is in the description: 'Standing' which is to say 'not crouched'.
---
It is solicited; read the title.
---
Thx buddy :)
---
Watoga, Huntersville, sometimes even a quick run through Welch and its train station depending on who else has been through there recently.
---
I can't check, I'm on xbox
---
I am not escaping PvP situations myself, I am actively searching for them. My motives in this post are not to make MY life better. On the contrary, I want it less frustrating for people who do not share the playstyle with me.
---
You can deactivate them by selecting them in the map and clicking the yellow diamond icon....I think. 
---
Mooooooooom! Pull the pluuuuuuuug! I accidentally bought a PVP game!
---
Just putting it out there that we also need a way to plant things needed for chems, like firecaps.
---
Stop whining.
---
I’ve heard they can drop from treasure maps even after the patch 
---
You not seen this guy's sitting in the camps killing each other boosting levels 
---
As far as the pinning health goes I have to I have healing factor mutation so if I don't pin it with rads it will fill when I'm out of combat and for that reason I use more diluted radaway than stimpacks.
---
Good to know, means this topic could be closed.
---
Reading your post was a useless adventure.
---
i intend to come back and have a little play again but ive been away all of february with work, then with apex, and anthem being checked out i haven't logged in in some time.
---
there is a post in this thread that describes how to get other lining blueprints/upgrades from events, but the events in question are bugged, so the item basically wont drop. but this is an old thread and maybe it has changed since, which under armor were you after?
---
The problem I see here is that Bethesda is an "old" company keeping to an old way of development with strict and tight deadlines and planning which ..ok point given...brings your roadmap forward "faster" (as it's the only focus) but isn't flexible enough to give you any spare time for QoL or other unplanned changes.
---
That's why I see "official" chat not before 2020 after they completes the current roadmap as every addition is probably already set in stone
---
Seriously?
---
I am seeing a bug when fast travelling to one particular location while in power armour and I should start messing with my clock speeds?
---
Same thing happened to me in Fort Defiance. I've been savoring this quest from the start and was finally sinking my teeth into the Brotherhood. I'd just cleared the place and before I could log into the terminal to finish the quest my connection crashed. Switched servers, went back inside, immediately got swarmed by jacked up ghouls and died, losing hours of junk. It never rains but it pours. Respawned, sneaked back in to retrieve my junk and decided to go play with Rose instead. LOL, she's such a bitch. I think I'm in love. Look, I wasn't gonna eat that ghoul like some kinda schnook, but nobody fucks with me and gets away with it. Sorry about your spirit, bro. War is hell. Have fun waiting for it to change!

And btw. Mr self-righteous taking their data out of their arse, it appears that bethesda confirmed working on this particular issue, which means there will be no more reason for making these types of posts. I am seriously disgusted by how your comments and your worldview are disconnected from reality. 
---
The multiplayer mode killed the otherwise beautiful game, simple as that. Not only they allow players to slap others to death, they also believe it’s a good idea to reward the aggressor with the caps from the victim. Essentially a system that encourages virtual murder and robbery. What kind of dumb criminal on their dev team came up with crap like that. I told my friends how it works and they were like ‘wtf’ and weren’t interested in getting the game. 
---
Oxhorn covered Tanagra Town the other day:

---
shielded for both raider and casual.
---
Westek is a good farming spot. Its super mutants and theres a good legendary chance. Also much rarer to see people also there so its a fairly clear place to loot.
---
I would love to be able to sell to a vendor.  I had at one point 20 or do fusion cores that were 50% or lower.  What player would want those?
---
You also need to be level 5 to enable it. So if you are not Level 5 or higher you won't find it.
---
I have had this happen a few times this week. Mainly in nuke zones.
---
Easiest way I have found my baggy is to move to the skull marker from when I last died. Keeping in mind if you die again it will move the location.
---
As far as I can tell the weapons of the future (energy weapons) all suck stick with your black powder guns and go full pirate!
---
No, they are not important. There's no reason to announce your exit from the game with some long-winded post, because no one really cares.
---
Proper feedback here and on the Bethesda forums is important, standing up on a soap box and announcing you are not playing the game anymore is pointless.
---
I'd like this to happen. If you can't damage someone, then there's no point in attacking them.  You'd hope.
---
You may need to rely on the accuracy of third party reports in that case.
---
And that's where you come along lol, what your saying does make sense.
---
&gt;finishing the game 
---
I'm still not sure what that means in a Fallout game that can go on forever. Will you stop playing now and move on to something else?
---
Actually the radio seems a bit buggy. I'm on xbox and sometimes in teams other players will leave their radio sound on. Usually I've heard the song before, but on at least 5 occasions, their radio has played songs that I have never heard before or after. In addition, mine will often play the same song or two songs on repeat for half an hour to an hour - which drives me nuts but not as much as playing in silence. And I think I only have 8 songs in total on my radio. Do you guys have more? 
---
I mean finishing the main quest line
---
somehow, there's some griefers who can kill you with slap damage in under 10 seconds, even some that can 1 shot slap damage kill ...
---
The guided meditation event is a good one for xp, as others have stated Super Mutants give great Zo so really anywhere you can find a group of them.
---
Why has no one given this man a metal?
---
Pleasure. 
---
Thank you!  I haven't had to deal with as much griefing as I anticipated but when it happens it is extremely frustrating.  It will be nice to go exploring without worrying about "drama".  I get enough drama in the real world.
---
All the time I end up with 2 options: Drop all junk (except for nuked flora) or spend INSANE amount of time to keep what I eventuelly need.
---
Btw I pick up stuff a lot faster then I need them.
---
Only time I actually need a lot of stuff is when building camp.
---
They should change the name of the game to ”Fallout: over encumbered”
---
My camp is similar. I stuck it up in the lil train and built a tower from the ground up 8 stories. Although a big target for scorchbeast attacks.
---
True, i haven't even seen a 45-70 in game in fallout 76. Not complaining about the lever action being chambered in 45, im complaining about it having only 5 rounds capacity. For a long barreled, long tubed lever action chambered in a pistol cartridge theres no reason it should only hold 5 rounds.
---
Is being bipolar an insult now?
---
Please keep us updated on it if anything ever comes out of this.
---
There's a thoughtful player :) I also hate when I'm happily swiping away at my mobs and someone fast travels in and begins to TSE the enemies right from underneath me, I just always just walk away and leave them to it.
---
Healing factor, reduces chems enough that rad away doesnt destroy your rad build up and once out of combat you heal every thing back up.
---
Blocker and Serendipity, plus bolstering armor makes you a bit harder to kill. 
---
Well, i miss BoS arms and chest, and also BoS shielded lining for the under armor on my pc character, have the all on my xbox char.
---
So what happen'd last night, BoS shielded lining droped for me again on my xbox by delivering technical data, normal technical data only gives me some ammo and water, was a bit surprised.
---
To bad it wasn't on my pc char / alt, but at least it seems that event can still drop them... 
---
Going to deliver a lot of technical data on my pc char today, lol
---
I think you're right. If I could start up this game without the prior 'knowledge' of what it was going to be and other people's opinions influencing me, I would have a very different experience.
---
The polite ones would only tag the enemies so everybody gets EXP and loot
---
40% whiskey means 60% water. Practically healthfood
---
Id love for recon scopes to flag mobs for my team mates.
---
Anti armor doesn’t effect energy resistance so it would be a standard Tesla rifle at the moment.
---
If someone harrass you, just switch server. It’s that easy.
---
What's so meta about this? First off, such a  suggestion/problem thread already exists, so thanks for the genius idea, genius.
---
Secondly, if not for the Bethesda please posts new issues would never come to light. 
---
What kind of content do you prefer? I feel like Beth Please posts are one of the most important functions of this sub
---
&gt;treasure maps
---
Did 9  treasure maps i had stored, didn't get any BoS related stuff :/
---
What do you Mean by lazy
---
I'm against global chat. Local chat is okay, but not global. I don't want to see all this: "OLOLOLO KILL YA MOM!!11" in FO76
---
We need a PvE ONLY mode.
---
We shouldn't have to be watching our backs constantly, it's not enjoyable
---
Fair enough haha, at least want to see local chat
---
I have a level 195 melee specialist and a level 130 ranged/sneak character and while I do play a fair bit I am not at 600 hours or anything like that.   The melee character was leveled at a time before the exp nerfs and that character packed on the levels quickly.   The ranged character less so.   The one thing they do have in common is they don't have a lot of idle time in the game.    Something is always being killed so exp is always being added.    It is a bit grindy but that is just how I play.    That level 409 could be the same way.
---
I will add one more thing to this.   With my ranged character I have been much more diligent when playing to have the rested exp buff and the exp buff from cranberry relish.    That extra 15% helps.
---
Care to explain the method you used to get: Wooden Screw = Nuclear Bomb.
---
Lazy design by the devs. Forcing people to use 3rd party way to trade effectively.
---
This is like going into Rust and complaining that some guy shot you with a shotgun.
---
I'm launch nuke three times and all three bombs NOT in Whitespring or SBQ. 
---
yeah, there is a lot of washing machines around in Appalachia ;)
---
Looks really good, grungy and fits in well with the surroundings.
---
Imagine though if we could have actual brightly coloured Lego bricks, big ones to build with, that would fun :)
---
Actually, looking at the promo images on the roadmap, they look different than the stock vending machines. 
---
That’s why then. It was one of the first things I looked for and not looked since. Thanks.
---
Yep, local chat desperately needed
---
Well do you think it was because they were lazy like they sat on the couch and watched tv or like they were busy doing something more important
---
&gt; give great Zo
---
Zo is now officially the term for for XP gained via meditation. So sayeth the Mothman. May your pants be eaten last.
---
A steal, cheap at half the price, absolute bargain. Giving it away. Comes with a free teddy.
---
What system?
---
Praise be giveth to The Mothman who bestows us the unworthy with His Zo.
---
OK bud. I'm uk gmt I'll be on in a few hours. Maybe about 4pm
---
no im not ok with it, and some ppl will take advantage off the little guy. with that i wouldnt let anyone ruin my playing time, so you can stay and keep taking the abuse or leave up to you........
---
Take out the 10mm submachine and you’ll burn through it in 30mins tops!
---
lol I said the same thing like 30 times already and I always end up moving my base. 
---
 ^(Zoinks! You've taken a wrong turn.)
---
Even grafton steel has tons of mobs, and if you take the workshop you can do the defend events as well 
---
I love the idea of being able to see what the player/vendor has before you get there. ESO has guild vendors rather than an auction house and finding things on consoles is abusive as there is no way to know which vendor has a specific item let alone knowing what it will cost. 
---
be advised that pacifist mode only renders you unable to deal any damage to other players. you can still be damaged (i.e. killed) by other players.
---
If you were walking around the map and accidentally set off a scorched beast...you can't just turn on pacifist and say '*screw you Mr Scorchbeast, you can't hurt me*' and just continue on your merry way. You have to use your wit and skills to get away from them.
---
**My tip for escaping PVP situations**: Get yourself 1 piece of chameleon armor and if you are getting harassed by a player, you switch to the Chameleon armor piece and run away out of site of the hunter and then crouch and go invisible and just wait for them to go away.
---
If you CAMP is getting griefed ==&gt; Fast travel to a new location and move it
---
Ah ok, thanks for the extra info ^ ^ nice to know what it actually is because I remember hearing about royal jelly from that one futurama episode with the giant space bees
---
Quite simply they should use the Pacifist setting as a filter if its on you get put in a world with other people that have the toggle on if its off then world matching is just the same as it is now.
---
Wonder if they will actually ever fix this broken lazy game.  
---
For people that I don't know directly or indirectly through his or hers friends, I require they take an image of their Social screen in the game which lists all of their game friends in Fallout 76.  If the customer skips out on paying and we can't find him or her, my "collectors" will go after the customer's friends.
---
Waaaah? Noice. What a weird decision by Bethesda to not provide any form of protection. Why the hell isnt there a 2 way no damage option? I never realised this. 
---
That is absolutely bonkers.
---
**I love you and upvoted**
---
Yeah. Like a bayonet. Also, legendary binoculars. Reduced damage while aiming.
---
I have my base set up as a BoS camp right by watoga station. Since I first built it I've moved it twice. The past 2 nights to fix it because of asshats screwing with my decon shower. Never moving it again. Takes half an hour to rebuild it.
---
That is your own opinion 
---
So far, for the past two months I've been doing this, I've had 100% payback of all loans.
---
I scienced this just the other day with a brand new character. I contracted it from a ghoul, then it was up and working, success! Right? WRONG after server hopping  I discovered it was back to its broken -50 HP. 
---
It might be overwhelming on the server, but it would be really cool if a player could see what's for sale by looking in their camps own vendor. It's a really exciting mechanic, but I have a bad feeling most of the things I put in there won't be taken. 
---
yeah it would be cool to hear EM playing in the apalachian radio!!!!!!
---
I really don't understand why people expected an online action role-playing game in the Fallout series set in a dark apocalyptic wasteland filled with drugs, raiders and genocides to be a game where nobody can touch you or your stuff.
---
Anyway, killing someone in pacifist gives you a 50 caps bounty, and destroying a big camp can bankrupt you.
---
I won't say that caps are that much worthless, on the other hand rebuilding with contractor requires few resources (except for the decontamination shower and maybe the fusion generator) and server hopping it's not a big deal.
---
The easiest way tbh 
---
Not going to happen I’m good with gunslinger and switching would take forever 
---
*Sigh* so... It's awesome when people think about the same thing. Two months ago, I didn't see this post and I didn't comment on said post that I didn't see. Thanks for sharing here. To all that have replied, Thanks for sharing thoughts too and please note someone had similar thoughts before me.
---
I thought about this!  I can sprint around and use my power fist to take them down pretty fast, tbh, I may just head there instead of West Tek.
---
This is a good UI for vending, I dig it.
---
Surely if pvp servers went live then they will overhaul the whole pvp system etc? Oh wait. Bethesda. Sorry 
---
Oh cool, I’m embarrassed to say I hadn’t noticed those images.. hah
---
i have over 180 hours play and I havent seen him once.
---
Main quest, OK understand.
---
That would be fine with me too.
---
I had just finished respecing my build before the nerf. Then I had to start over and it was a major turn off from.
---
"They played us like a damn fiddle."
---
I have tesla coil armor, so I don't actually hit anything when I first sprint through.  I just have to run past mobs to tag them.  After a circuit, I circle back around and *then* help take them down, that way everyone's give a chance to tag.
---
They didn't even bother putting it on their priority list for a release. Only after people started complaining about lack of text chat communications and no way of trading other than randomly annoying strangers with trade invitations, did they realize it was an important feature to have in a MULTIPLAYER game.
---
At least they are working on it I suppose...
---
I have an idea to solve this as I had an asshole the other night harass me. ... Keep the what system they have but ADD after 2 slaps turn it back on the aggressor, make it full damage on them or better yet, they 3rd slap they kill themselves.  They die and drop all their junk. If they try to snipe like a coward then they effectively die and do no damage. That I think will deter the jerk offs who think that it is fun. They can go to the survival mode or what ever the fuck turns them on and leave ppl who refuse to engage the fuck alone.
---
Ooohh, that would be one expensive crossover! xD Thanks muchly!
---
Yes, the OP should not he able to just enjoy his game he should be wasting his time trying to find a stable server with no griefers. 30 seconds? Do you work for Bethesda? I've never had the game load a new server in less than 1 minute. If it doesn't freeze up on me. 
---
Lol but what if fallout 76 was on the TV? 
---
Same boat but on level 11 but still getting trashed at times or coming back to my camp destroyed.  I’ve now taken to not even bothering to rebuild.
---
Will people be able to opt fully out of the new survival pvp game mode coming soon? Seems to me a lot want pve but that new mode will encourage more pking.
---
They still are able to one shot, TSE still have some punch it seems, post nerf.
---
I have about 1 disconnect a day which isn't too bad but still annoying

Never seen anything even remotely resembling 1 shot kills to anyone thats *not* flagged PVP.   Any claims otherwise is dubious at best without a video to prove that. 
---
The only thing that can come close to this is if someone has mutation/mod that does reflect damage that kills someone else and therefor that person becomes wanted.   Not even sure this would work on someone that is pacifist though. I assume the reflected dmg would not work.
---
Someone did a video where slap dmg is 5 dmg period.  Regardless of any damage buffs.     Someone had stacked bobbleheads to insane damage numbers in the 70k+ range and tried to do slap damage on his friend and did 5 dmg total.
---
Slap damage is capped at 5 damage.  I cannot see any way to get killed under 10 seconds at all.   Currently level 140 and never been killed by any player, but I do not engage in PVP.  I have been shot at plenty of times, but always had way more than enough time to go to inventory, cure radiation, then use stim pack.   Easily 20+ seconds.   Even then I was 80% rads during nuke in Whitesprings.
---
So unless you want to provide link to some video showing proof of any 1 shot kills, not possible *IF* you are not wanted nor flagged for PVP.
---
Noooo!
---
The slap damage is capped to 5 hp/second. It takes a minimum of 40 hits over 40 sevonds to kill someone who don't fight back. You can literally just walk away. Don't worry. If you have a few spare stimpacks you can let them spend a few minutes letting them waste ammo, and then walk away.
---
I dont think the problem is with PvP, per say (however, I think there are some major changes to base destruction that should be done). I think it's the fact that there's nothing else to do for end game players other than to grief and find enjoyment in the 'dark side' of the game.
---
I’ve done few trades, but still, most if not all were very excellent. 
---
Hardcore buying and selling isn’t really the focus of 76, it seems. Doesn’t make the devs lazy. 
---
That's what I'm reading from people is that you should just accept the bully is attacking you and you should waste your time finding servers that are both stable and free of griefers. How dare you spend your money on a game and expect to enjoy it. 
---
The sad part is that the people who enjoy griefing won't necessarily head to PVP servers, because the whole point of griefing for them is making other people unhappy, and PVP servers will be filled with people who actually fighting other players, and not people who just want to be left alone.
---
It's a daily thing now where I'm running past a vehicle and some other player will shoot / toss a grenade at the vehicle just to make me take damage.  They don't know me as far as I can tell, they're just basically being casual asshole, because the game mechanics allow it.
---
I have pacifist turned on, and try not to damage other players, but there are so many melee builds who engage mobs at Whitespring near vehicles that it's unavoidable blowing stuff up while they're standing next to something explodey.
---
Ah yes, Artificial Scarcity
---
I played herbivore quite a long time.  I found it better to spend the first 5 minutes making soups and then going out.  Never needed to waste a constant perk slot though.
---
Fair enough, though clearly people are taking on that challenge of being massive dicks even with that ltd damage.
---
I can't believe people have such big problems finding screws.. the only time this should be the case is when you are low level.. and even then just doing a lap around whitespring should be enough to get enough for repairs..
---
Anyway, i'll give a few good locations that i have found after some 600hrs of playing fallout 76.
---
-Head to pylon v-13 (close to abandoned bogtown in the far west of the map)
---
Head to the 3rd floor of the building next to the red rocket station.
---
(use the scafolding to go through a hole in the wall.)
---
Drop down the elevator shaft.
---
You will come into an office room with about 20 typewriters and fans.
---
-Sugar Grove, lots and lots of fans.
---
-Whitespring bunker military section, lots of fans around here as well.
---
-Whitesprings, a fan can be found in almost all of the small security rooms found around the premises of the hotel.
---
Random items to watch out for when exploring:
---
Toy Cars, Silver Locket, Globes, Hot Plate, pepper mill, type writer,giddy up buttercup complete, giddyup buttercup body, violin, portable fuel tank.
---
Do you avoid Class Freak to keep the cap on the chems? I admit not even considering NOT doing Class Freak - I tend to look at those as a 5 point joint-buy.
---
Interesting
---
That was actually fixed a while back, many players have tested &amp; debunked that myth.
---
Slap Damage does a maximum of 5hp per hit no matter what type of weapon or player level.
---
How many rads does the FEV water add?  And you keep Sunkissed - does it not drop your rads too quickly? 
---
They probably took the time it would have taken to implement features such as this and worked on something more important instead
---
Then don't, I don't care. Try your luck with Bethesda support, or your card manufacturer or whatever.
---
Separate PvP and PvE servers is how it should have been from the beginning.
---
Yeah bro just change server every 5 minutes.
---
A youtuber named Oxhorn just uploaded a video on this place. He talks about it. Cant remember what he said about it though. I think it's an Easter egg.
---
16k caps what are you on?
---
Flamers are shite anyway even with tse. I wouldn't pay 160 for that.
---
Multiplayer is fine - this game should have been coop PvE multiplayer from the start.
---
Problem with Grafton Steel is that the mobs there are a bit low level
---
I only have blocked 4 people so far. I'm talking about the full block feature not the block in this session. I blocked those 4 people because they were attacking me for no reason, even though I didn't want to retaliate they still attacked me until I logged off. And I think 4 is a small number of people &gt;\_&lt;
---
&gt; Anyway, killing someone in pacifist gives you a 50 caps bounty, and destroying a big camp can bankrupt you.
---
Every griefer I've ran into has a buddy close by that will swoop in, claim the bounty then hand the asshole their caps back. 
---
It makes me giggle if they lock the door but put the workbench directly next to a window meaning I can glitch inside the building anyway.
---
Obviously I only do that when I am ready to go offline soon anyway.
---
I seriously doubt that. I truly believe that feature was simply overlooked. It's their first online game and they are learning as they go along. Nothing wrong with that. But there's also nothing wrong with constructive criticism.
---
Don't use the auto for everything, save it for the tougher mobs, up close.
---
Thanks for the clarifications..this helps!
---
I see. Hmm interesting.   My social screen lists nothing in game at all.
---
I only group with 1 real life friend period.  Too many trolls/griefers/pvpers in FO76 for my tastes.   Since I use Steam for chatting, there was no point in adding him to game.
---
So I recon that some people would not be able to use the services you provide if there are others like me.  I was just curious to how this would work.
---
Because every living human was chosen to rebuild the wasteland and then lived for decades together? Pvp makes zero sense based on that. The only living faction is “vault 76”, and everything else is basically archaeology. 
---
So dosnt that mean its a broken system and your solution of blocking and hopping does not work? Lol.
---
I got a second account from a digital code buy site that stated to activate the code they sent me through the launcher. I did that and my account name appeared as a ransom string of numbers and letters. I guess this is what you are posting for. No idea why it happens and how to fix it
---
Thank you for that!  It seems much more realistic than the other options in game actually.  That would probably be exactly what happened.
---
Set up a camp on a junk pile, plopped a harvester on it, BOOM. I haven’t worried about screws since.
---
No, it is not.  
---
No expectations is literally impossible. At least you expect that the game is working on a technical level even if you do not understand, or disagree with game elements like gunplay, etc.  
---
There is no "correct way to have fun" in Fallout 76 and you might be a lucky one that simple misses all the frustration from the bugs, bad systems, and overall boredom.  
---
I myself enjoyed the game for about 12 hours despite the problems, after that the ratio of new\_exciting:frustration turned and the more I played the more stuff began to irritate me. There just is not enough content to keep you invested for a longer time and the frustration builds up.
---
lol... that's what I thought too, my CAMP looks ugly with wires connecting everywhere. 
---
It's 2076 and people still use wire smh. Should've thought something like WiFi power connector or something like that.
---
Someone should make a mod for FO4 that turns all the raiders lvl100 player character equivalents with full legendary gear and fully modded X-01 power armors from the start of the game. Then make them actively seek the player at all times and trash all their settlements by fast travelling between them. Would nicely parallel the FO76 "raider" experience.
---
I don't really mind people playing raiders, but they should be like them, not just act like them. Leather/metal armor, Raider PA, pipe weapons and raider melee. Also to be more tolerable to play with, target different people, not the same one time after time.
---
Seeing as you didn't read / understand my comment I shall paste some again in the hope you'll do better this time:
---
*It's also amazingly rare. 500+ hours here and I was griefed once. The massive majority of players are overly nice and hunt down low levels to give them items and help them.*
---
Apparently I work for Bethesda because I said bug fixes were more important than wrapping OP in cotton wool. You're a massive twat if you're being serious. 
---
Also, over a minute to load into a server? TF is wrong with your system? FFS that's on you or your connection because it's 30 seconds for me.
---
Fireproof level 3 will help with that problem. 
---
I've noticed that the servers are a bit more of a mess right now. I know they implemented some things that was supposed to fix it but they don't seem to be helping much.  That being said, some days I can go hours without any noticable hiccups.  It's such a mixed bag of how the connection is going to be. 
---
No - someone who, like your character, was chosen from a pool of highly-qualified people to rebuild the wasteland and then spent many years living together with you in close quarters. 
---
And now... somehow has to shoot you for entertainment? 
---
I have no friends that play FO76. :-)
---
Take a cue from fellow unpopular-on-the-internet game Battlefront’s sub...  
---
It has a stickied weekly wishlist thread and all wishlist posts are removed 
---
I'll paste that again to help you. 'Every 5 minutes'. FFS lol
---
Exactly which piece of what I said defends anyone? Except people who preorder. I'm saying nothing about devs responsibility in releasing a game. Stop assuming my meanings, and read my words.
---
Due to the reduced Durability of weapons, all screws and springs fall out randomly after 3-6 shots, leaving only Duct tape holding it together. 
---
Maybe it’s rare for you.  It’s a daily fucking occurance for me. 
---
Amen.   Unless there is some sort of benefit per-level would rather get the reset over earlier. 
---
Awww crap.  I never take Workshops over at all because I don't  like PVP.  So this is a game "feature" that caters only to the PVP crowd in a PVE centric game.
---
Nice one. /s
---
Well they showed it in the noclip so they clearly did not overlook it
---
Why should I waste a stim on a systemic flaw in the game?
---
What is? What's another player doing to you that is griefing?
---
No, it's nothing like that. It's more about you being incapacitated for a second or more. Between the open/close animations, the time inside, and the time to transition back to first person, they would have more than enough time to kill you.
---
The problem with "full auto knife's" is that the target can hit you back while you are sawing them in half which mostly stuns you. I guess they would be a little OP one on one if they stun locked the target.  
---
I do have bother the PS4 and PC versions of the game (I bought the PS4 version first) and I suppose I have put an average amount of time into the game and I have only been shot at twice, one guy tried to keep shooting at me when I was at the first overseers camp, but as I didn't shoot back he got bored and left.
---
So I know that it's a small risk of getting ganked, but it's something I could do without, at least I am confident in playing that I fancy going around and dipping my toe into pvp. Also this game needs clans and being able to group up to rebuild towns etc. 
---
Im just about done trying to do some form of interprative dance to convey just what i mean if its not in the emotes!!  Had a dude get annoyed with me and start shouting "WHAT DO YOU MEAN" at me as my dance was clearly sub-par!! I use my weak laser pistol as a laser pointer towards things, but sometimes they get enraged and run away as thinkling im attacking! GAH!
---
To start brotherhood quest line go to Abbie's bunker on her computer look up fort defiance. That should trigger it. 
---
Im also also in this field, but on the Web &amp; Mobile side. This is a solid idea that is well executed, so nice work. If I could give a suggestion, it would be this: when you design something as part of an existing ecosystem, it’s important to stick with the UI patterns already existing, especially the branding.
---
That being said, I would not deviate from the established black/yellow color pallette. Also, I noticed you used “Navigate Up/Navigate Down” with D-Pad icons— in all the interfaces a simple up/down yellow triangle arrow is used.
---
Of course I understand the negative implications of iconography without labels, but deviating from the main branding &amp; patterns in an established application can be jarring when it’s so disjointed.
---
Food for thought. :)
---
That challenge is the Flatwoods Monster and yes it's a Zetan
---
And stuff for it.
---
For crafting stations
---
- let us craft items in bulk instead of one at a time
---
- perks that aid crafting should show as buffs in the bottom right hand corner, replacing well rested/mutated etc.
---
 So if you go to a chem bench, you should see chemist/superduper as buffs if they are equipped.
---
It absolutely is not rare. I have 500 hours in and I have personally met fuckhole griefers probably 100 times.
---
Now that I'm 170 and I've got decent armor and weapons I make XP loops where I kill everything.
---
One loop is the General's Steakhouse (Super Mutants - bonus points if a SB erupts out of the nearby fissure and they fight each other as I pick them off - then head across the way to RobCo and clear that out then follow the gravel path to a downed monorail train turned into a ramshackle fort and kill 'em all - it's usually Scorched V Super Mutants there as well.
---
Another is to start at West-tek and go up the line of road killing every Satellite Dish lovin' Mutie at all the sites.
---
Happy Hunting!
---
or just keep your camp bare and utilitarian, they will have little to grief
---
I built my entire level 50 set from fast travelling to Surface to Air event, the reward is 51b parts but there is always (for me so far) a frame with multiple 60 parts in the camp
---
This is really good, mind if i put in my post so it might get more attention? I will credit you :)
---
I agree there. It's crazy to me. This subreddit is getting such a hive mind about everything. 
---
Have you tried this route yet? [https://imgur.com/gallery/xOGes0a](https://imgur.com/gallery/xOGes0a)
---
"My family are billionaires so every family are billionaires" Sound logic. 
---
It defend your rad resist. As i remember Non rad res +150 rad point and T-51b Power armor +61 rad point
---
Yeap Sunkissed is quick down rad point. When it reach hp 10 or 20% point i switch perk to Good doggy or Rejuvenated
---
I am level 80 and still haven't searched out more than a couple of the treasure maps.  I keep saying I'll reserve a weekend for looking for them but it never happens.
---
Not sure it will make you feel any better by when I was lower level I routinely got griefed and had my camp destroyed several times over.  At the time it really annoyed the shit out of me, but to some extent it’s almost a rite of passage as you get more experience and level up.   Now that I’ve lvl 127 most players don’t mess with me unless they have numbers and team up to harass or grief.  
---
The plan is called “powered gates” or “powered doors”. It includes brick and warehouse doors both with and without the keypad. Pre patch it was only on graham. Since then I’ve seen it in Watoga, Harpers Ferry and some of the raider vendors. 
---
I don’t believe you’ll find it in the forest, ash heap, or toxic valley. 
---
It's pretty bad, because it's all over the place. What weapons are you trying to use? Martial artist/incisor/radicool suggest a melee sneak, but then you get mr sandman which is for ranged silenced weapons. Radicool and rad sponge collide - one nerfs the other.
---
This.  I've done it.  It works, and the peace is serene.
---
You gotta be kidding, right?? “People kill all legendaries meh it has to be a exploit meh Bethesda do something meh” Jesus fucking Christ..... 
---
Hey! This is great! I think that tweet would've made all the difference. I spend a lot of time with various fallout 76 communities and social medias and I don't think anyone knew about this. Maybe if I checked Reddit more often I would've seen it. Although, everyone was super distracted by the roadmap that day. Im sure  that's a big part of why. 
---
The game was advertised as a wasteland in which every encounter with a human being was a player, and you'd always have to be thinking on your feet as everyone could be a friend or foe. 
---
I see these posts every day and I am always amazed by people that bought this game without actually bothering to read what it's about and then blaming others for playing the game as it was intended.
---
It's already a cop out that stuff like pacifist mode/bounties exists in the manner they're currently implemented.
---
There are two easy solutions:
---
1. Jump servers and block the player. You can easily heal through 5 points of slap damage while doing so.
---
2. Post a message somewhere asking for help. Either here or if you happen to be on XBox just post looking for assistance. I read through a bunch of trade posts last night out of boredom and my friends and I helped 4 people deal with griefers.
---
Don't get me wrong though... I'm a raider. I love PVP and I server hop to contest workshops nightly. However, I don't consider myself a griefer as I want "consensual" PVP. If I slap you and you don't fight back I'm leaving. If you don't come to contest your workshop I'm going elsewhere and you can have it back.
---
I'm offering to "assist" you because I want to fight in a cap rich environment. All you have to do is point out who it is and we will initiate the fight. You just stay in pacifist, collect loot bags and enjoy the fireworks. Also, my group can't be the only ones that feel this way.
---
What platform do you play on? I’m on Xbox and would be happy to play with you. I also have it on PC but haven’t really played there much. 
---
Go for it
---
That's a legal issue.
---
Because of an american law, if a game is proposing a text-based chat, it HAS to propose a text-to-speech variant.
---
That's why new games are using direct coms over a text chat. Easier to implement, no legal issues. 
---
I always preemptively blow up cars in whitespring.  As soon as no ones around, boom.
---
I'd say West Tek, Harper's Ferry, General's Steakhouse, Watoga is a good circuit, but if you want a single spot with the most spawns, then West Tek itself.  For events, when it appears, always do AWOL Armaments, but be prepared for a ton of gutsies.
---
The whole SBQ nuke cycle is actually good but its hard to get people to do it now.  Because her scaling is broken, there's more adds that spawn, and the silo run has tons of robots so between the two, you'll gain a ton of XP.  Just don't ignore the adds when fighting the SBQ, I get them anyways just to boost up adrenaline before I focus on the queen for a bit.
---
Sorry man I hope they resolve this issue of yours soon. That actually sucks. We miss you, all of us.
---
I've had the invisible bug after an software update where the 60th Level Annihilator Sentry Bot near the 98 NAR Regional was completely undetectable and was killing the scorched around him. This was due to a programming fault (flagging an encounter) as I've seen this before in other PC games.
---
This phenomena is slightly different, the appearance is similar to a player character using a stealth boy where it's immediately apparent their location as the area shimmers. I check immediately the map to see whether a PC is in the location and there is nobody in the vicinity. 
---
It is rather disconcerting and rather ominous. So unless it's a player sneaking and following my character, highly doubtful as it's easily detectable the only conceivable argument it is the input lag, ghosting, or server lag (I'm getting double loading in White Spring). I've played FO76 for hundreds of hours, and came across all the old FO4 bugs and glitches but this is bloody strange and rather off-putting!!  
---
I'll try to capture this phenomena if time permits but this occurs only for a split second.
---
I’m hoarding points from leveling up cause I simply don’t know if my perk cards will be gone and the investment in new perk cards right now will be sense- and useless in summer... a little bit of info on how it will work would help immensely!!! 
---
You’re a massive twat actually the moment you reposted your comment as a quote because you assumed just because someone disagreed with you, the MUST have comprehension issues.  
---
Just because you’ve been griefed once or twice in 500 hours doesn’t make that the standard for us all.  Some of us have shit in our lives that prevent us from plopping our fat asses down for 500+ hours in the last 4 months like you.  
---
Personally, I have a GF and a job and friends that I hang out with (in real life, not FO)  That means I only have 150 hrs at most— which puts me in the SWEET spot for gridding.  At level 65-70, I am sweet delicious fruit for people like you who have 500 hours logged and have lvl 150 + characters .  So for me , griefing happens almost every 5-10 sessions.  
---
Nice! If I was tall enough I’d do it.
---
I wouldn’t assume people shooting cars are doing so to harm you.  Some people just like shooting and blowing things up.  It’s almost an addiction for me.  I can’t help myself.  There’s a car or truck or bus and it’s going to get blown up.  Sometimes I take friendly fire in the process but it’s all good times. 
---
Wheres the invisibility coming from? Cant they just run in and killed only the legendarys?
---
You're being fucking retarded lol. That's not what you said and that's not what was being discussed. You didn't just move the goalposts you changed the entire game. You were talking about, "The amount of kinetic damage imparted on a target by ballistic weapons should far outweigh anything a human can do with mere strength and an edged weapon or via blunt force object." And that is straight fucking untrue. Primarily because you don't understand words well enough to use them properly(kinetic damage), but even then a two handed edged weapon can truly cause ***substantially*** more damage than almost any gun except the biggest caliber rifles (we're talking .50 cals). Of course it all depends on the situation, a gun that doesn't cause mass carnage like a sword or axe might, can kill just as easily and from a range if properly aimed. But if you're talking just physical damage done to a body, the melee weapons cause more carnage end of story.
---
Furthermore, the reason modern militaries don't use melee weapons (just kidding they do you fucking idiot, knives are still very much a part of modern weaponry) is because that isn't a game. In real life, it's not about doing the most damage as fast as you can do it. That's a game concept and when you try to justify in game design choices with real life examples it only further justifies my opinion that you're a fucking moron.
---
That's very kind of you. But sadly I'm on PS4.  I don't know if Fallout 76 has global servers and we in the UK use different servers than in US. Whomever I meet wants to play on their own. There are very few people interested in team play. But then again, I'm not a heavy gamer. Level 52 playing since launch. :-D 
---
If you think thats a valid comparison then you're beyond help.
---
More like spending 500 hours painting, then somebody says you can only paint using a ladder or it won't work. Then argues it with you that you're wrong and need a ladder.
---
There's no fucking ladder. There's more important stuff to do with this game that put OP in a safe space.
---
There is a WiFi power glitch in Fallout 4 and I think part of the glitch exists in Fallout 76 not sure
---
Post apocalyptic world should be filled with happy camp dwellers?? Raiders arent in the game?? Lore doesnt state people were killing each other for supplies?? 
---
This real issue is people are used to the single player fallout with no real human interaction. Guess what folks...mmos have people who kill other people *gasp* yes its true... throw on 
---
I'd drop the 1 point in ninja. 
---
You're right, they won't. When griefers get killed they either A) turn on pacifist and stand around trying to trade with you or B) send you salty messages and leave the server. They don't want their target to fight back. Most of the people playing survival will want to fight.
---
The wasteland I guess is supposed to be a happy minecraft game
---
Your post is bullshit. Pacifist mode prevents damage from you so you don't accidentally damage somebody. That's it. Stop crying and shoot them back for free caps or press one button and change the server.
---
have heard about this law too...but never seen a game actually do something about it..well
---
but that shouldn't evem be a problem...just pass the chat texts to an external service and feed back the audio narration, just like voice chat
---
I'm not saying it's aliens....but it's aliens.
---
PvP brings out the worse in humanity, is all.
---
Unfortunately, right now, your best bet is to block them, and switch servers. If you see your camp is under attack, move it. Wherever you are, place it down there. You can build your house again later, and this way, you still have your whole camp minus whatever item(s) they destroyed.
---
It sucks, it's bullshit that we're the ones who end up 'punished' instead of the griefer, but right now? That's what you got to deal with them. Move your camp, block them, and switch servers.
---
Another stupid false claim. You get no exp from kill
---
No it’s not fine. You don’t allow a pacifist to be killed and base destroyed and in-game currency robbed, period. It really exposed the criminal mentality of certain key individuals on their dev team. 
---
They don’t even need a dedicated pvp server. It’s an afterthought from the backlash of their pro-crime system. Just mark players with different dots on the map, green dots PVEers red dots PVPers. PVEers can’t be harmed and can’t harm others. PVPers will automatically seek out other PVPers and have their fight while PVEers go about their own business nearby. How simple is that. And the rewards should come from the system like all other multiplayer games, not from the victims. 
---
I want one if you are selling :).
---
How much.?
---
I’m delighted to see your reaction to this encounter.  Rather than rant about the unfairness in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, you offer some of your hard-earned resources to anyone willing to help you exact sweet revenge on the person that wronged you.
---
You, sir, are part of the solution.
---
The lack of friend references may prevent us from granting you a loan.  It depends on how much of a loan you are seeking, if you are financing a weapon, etc.  I require all potential loan customers to use the game chat at the time we're discussing business and this can sometimes help me determine ones credibility.  I may also require that one leaves other items with us as collateral until the loan is paid as well.
---
High?  I built a 5 story building with fencing around the roof. I thought it was not enterable. I was wrong. Marsupial, strange in numbers, jet pack and a Nuka cola quantum got my friend in. 
---
So I gave up and just left it open.

All hail the Mothman!

A bloody shotgun
---
I agree completely but I think I am a bit different. Even in morowind and elderscrolls I just went exploring. I dint really do the quests in order and I enjoyed the crap out of the game. Kind of doing the same thing here. Lvl 78 now and still have not launched a nuke, been very close and know how too, just havent yet..I have been all over the map and seen it all. Still finding things and really love it!
---
No. 
---
I don’t want shades of pvp. There’s NO DIFFERENCE when a better geared and taller toon bullies a lowbie or someone not wanting to pvp. 
---
Folks who maybe taller who don’t pvp, should not suffer because a lowbie asshat griefer got greedy and kite the system
---
Asshat behavior is universal and should be treated the same, whisked off to pvpland.
---
No ifs ands or butts.
---
I destroyed a turret camp at WS golf club last night.  After several warning shots and annoying missiles lighting up the golf club I lit up the player and their camp.  My reward?  A 260 cap bounty. I gladly let a lvl 210 player in the area take it.  That’s the way the game works.   
---
just point your melee at it or throw legendary rolling pins at it....oh wait
---
Yeah cook that meat so you don’t get any diseases, id say get the perk to search for extra pharmaceuticals (Pharma Farmer?) to find loads of extra stimpacks / antibiotics / disease cures (when you have it you have to press space bar to search for extra loot and it can take a few seconds to proc) Also you can get diseases from the diseased creatures too, some of which give a buff as well as a negative! Happy Hunting!
---
I’d imagine you ask to speak to the manager a lot in real life.
---
How common is this really? In all my hours of play through, I've never been greifed. My camp is just open platforms with all work benches, a bed and some instruments. Oh and windchimes.  Gotta have those. 
---
Bah the one system I don’t have it on :( Pretty sure UK folks play on the same servers, at least that’s how it is on Xbox. One of my buds that a regularly play with lives in the UK. 
---
Additional costs, not wanting to use external tools, there's a lot of parameters that makes a text chat unappealing.
---
Plus the fact that a lot of people are playing on discord, etc
---
yeah...just like a predator they want easy prey not an (possible even) fight
---
You don't seem to be able to comprehend that multiplayer doesn't need to have any PvP elements in it.  Coop PvE is a multiplayer game model and would have been a much better fit for this game.
---
Hi There! 170ish Bloodied Unyielding Sniper checking in :)
---
I use the aforementioned Sun Kissed to lower my Rads ( very underrated Perk! ). I have 2 points in E so I run Radicool and Good Doggy 99% of the time and slot in SK when I do my Cap Stash run.
---
My food is Dog Food, Purified W, and Blight Soup (+20% Critical).
---
The Point investment for Class Freak/Starched Genes doesn't bother me (15 Luck ) as I have plenty of room to play with the dps cards like Bloody Mess. 
---
My Armor atm is all Combat Armor 4pcs Unyielding, 1 Chameleon and I rarely need to repair it because well..  I don't get hit :)
---
Unless they have a melee build. Although I have solar powered so no slapping me to death in the sun! 
---
Shit really thought you did haven't liked other players so don't know it just looked like it my bad 
---
If you use a terminal to open the door from the inside instead of a hard switch, you can close the door from the outside by inputting your code. It overrides the terminal signal and starts the close timer, closing the door after a while.
---
Its a completly valid thing to say, You managed to avoid 500 hours of getting killed by people but not everyone can but their points or opinions dont matter becasue you didnt have to deal with it so clearly they are not. 
---
You painted 500 hours without a ladder but there were a set of boxes (everyone being new and not being able to 1 bang you with a slap) OP has gone to paint the samething in the same place but has been offered no ladder and they have removed the boxes (Everyone else being stronger and being able to 1 hit him) making him have to stand on his tip toes whilst people walking past also punch him in the kidney from time to time. 
---
Players will still be here complaining about the same griefers kiting mobs into you or building rocket turret farms at Whitesprings. They might even take every workshop on the map with no way of contesting it. There's only one way to deal with it... kill them repeatedly and track them back to their base and destroy it. You get satisfaction plus the bonus of having a bounty that attracts **actual** PVPers.
---
they are already using a external service for their voice chat (the url to it is in one of the FO76 inis)
---
Don't feel bad. I have noticed an uptick in people doing that at the whitespring. I hope Bethesda removes the ability to setup camps that close to the country club. Also if they are going to kill everything without waiting for people at uranium fever, don't feel bad. This is why I keep a tesla rifle on me so that I can get tags on the mobs
---
The game is fun.  I put 200+ hours into the game before I ran out of things to do.
---
Some useful hints:
---
Loot everything, but do not stash everything. -- Stashes do not get weight reduction benefits from perks.
---
Break all junk down before storing.
---
Set self-imposed limits on junk components to keep.  (i.e. 100 of most items, 1000-1500 steel, unlimited for Screws/Springs, 50 for ceramics, 30 for asbestos)
---
Bulk-sell extra junk.  Some junk cannot be bulked, those you can sell without bulking.
---
If planning on playing rifles, remember no weight reduction perks for those.  
---
If using ballistic ammo types, get the weight reduction one for those.  Some ammo is zero weight!  Meaning you can carry around 1 million of those bullets and be fine.
---
I recommend you go and find a web site that allows you to build out your character based on what perks you use.  -- You \*can\* just wing it and adjust later, but it is taking me about 30+ levels to move stats around and get extra copies of perks to do the builds I want to do.   
---
If plan on doing PVP, then take workshops.   If don't stay away from them.   In the past, there was bugs/glitches that could allow you to be killed without even being there.  If you join someone's defense event for a workshop against PVE mobs, you still get free plans.  Also turn on Pacifist mode if not planning on PVP.
---
Griefers can and will destroy your CAMP at the moment.  Just be aware this happens.  Most people are happy to just use the stash/workstations.   Best thing to do in a case of griefer is to calmly block the person then log off and log back on.  Dont shoot back.
---
If having problems surviving, find a Bandits Power Armor and use that, it has tons of defense built in.   If you want to go without PA, just remember to get all the extra perks needed to survive with just armor.  (Evasion, White Knight, Blocker, Adamantium Skeleton)  -- I may have mispelled those.
---
Weight reduction perks are fantastic to get early on -- You will struggle most with being encumbered at early levels.
---
Eventually you want to pick a style of play and specialize into that.   Rifleman, pistol user, heavy weapons, melee, grenade launcher, or just a puncher.
---
Ill take a poorly shot picture, so you can see for yourself lol.
---
pc
---
\+1 Prestige System followed by Legendary Vendor. Skip the PVP server lol it's a waste of time and resources.
---
And speaking about these people; lv888, Mr banned 900 hours, etc. I realized that lot of people already have lvl 100+. 
---
BTW It makes me think that we NEED a 2 step login authentication to secure our account. Because i don't wanna hear that Bethesda can't restore our character (account hacked, character / stuffs deleted by the hacker) I laughed when they suggested to start over and make a new character because they dont have the tools to restore deleted items / character, etc.
---
I mean look at us; we have spent a lot of time and money (for people who have bought atoms) for this game, even though it's been 3 months since release day. We deserve a better way to secure our accounts.
---
To be honest.... I don't know if I wanted to continue playing; IF my account somehow got hacked, deleted all my character and stuffs, and Bethesda can't do anything about it because they don't have the tools to restore my account.
---
Yes it's definitely possible to go on top, I did ;)
---
I wish there were more place like this  in the game
---
There goes all hope of having protections we could place as vendors :(
---
almost 6 months since release
---
Honorable raiders? Such a thing exists? :p 
---
Luck on drops
---
Of course it doesn’t need to have pvp element, I was talking about the ways to implement it not to avoid it. It would be a waste NOT to have pvp in this game. But Bethesda managed to turn it into a pro-crime system. 
---
100% true. 
---
No they don't. We just don't want to waste time fighting people who don't fight back. Their deaths just aren't as sweetly satisfying. ;)
---
Well if you kill the legendary without letting others get a hit them you are an asshole in my opinion. Some disagree. I always let other get a hit so everyone gets a drop. Otherwise why did I waste the time for the event just to get all the legendary enemies killed before I get a shot. I assume this was why he was mad at you. But you do you, I prefer to have a good night of farming where nobody seeks me out to cause me problems because I snaked all the legendaries in uranium fever. 
---
ok thanks
---
I purposely put my camp on an acid deposit. I’m not just gonna move my camp if someone decided to shoot it. It defeats the whole point of me putting it where I put it. 
---
Congrats bullies... Bethesda is okay with you ruling their servers and ruining the game for PVE players.
---
And this is why I am praying for a tiny stash to transfer some plans and a few low level legendaries over to my next pc Goliath.
---
Ditto, maybe 2,000 spread around on 5 characters. It's now all about acid.
---
PvP is fun when it's equal. When a level 250 with gimmicky weapons and build slap damage a level 27 to death, it isn't.
---
I play on PS4 and noticed recently there is always a 1 under "new world found".  I've been wondering if that means I'm in world one.  Which has lead me to wonder if there are enough players to support multiple world's?
---
Nope. The way you get mods for a Handmade is to made several of your own and scrap them
---
Did you craft your handmade from plans? I've never seen the suppressor for sale but I had good luck scrapping them for that mod. I got a hardened receiver, a piercing magazine, a drum barrel (not used), a suppressor, a long scope (not used), and a reflex sight, simply by scrapping seven of them. Yeah, it takes a bunch of screws, but it was worth it. If you didn't craft it, and don't want to pay the caps for the plan, ask someone to mod it for you. Takes five seconds, and I would think most people would do it for free (I would; on pc with limited game time on weekends). Hell, I'd craft a whole new modded rifle for someone for nothing except the screws needed.
---
&gt;Personally, I have a GF and a job and friends that I hang out with
---
No need to start lying to impress people.
---
I see thank you.  I was mainly curious to this unique business you are running inside the game.  Its a huge risk on your part and was curious as to how you mitigated the risks.
---
Yeah they better keep the characters seperate when they roll that out
---
My theory is the backback will fill this role essentially. It will function as a mobile workbench that you can customize 
---
Yep 
---
Seems like the game shouldn't be more difficult, forcing server hops, for players choosing to mind their own business and not do pvp. How about the player that takes out the player with the bounty gets to take one of his weapons rather than caps? 
---
Have you tried this [fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af9qav/fix_for_0_fps_or_crashing_to_desktop_in/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=fo76&amp;utm_content=t1_ehfsaem)?
---
PvP is only really fun for me against friends.
---
Its not a waste not including PvP - implementing PvP in a builds based equipment dependent game with fundamentals taken from a former single player game is a recipe for disaster and a waste of resources.  They should have focused on coop PvE instead for the multiplayer Fallout experience.
---
PvP will always be broken, and if PvP ever gets balanced correctly, the whole PvE aspects of the game will feel terrible to play and not fun.
---
Wondering the same thing.
---
I use Instagram so it's simply a picture or video maxed at 1 minute
---
Then post the link
---
This has happened to me too.  Before the last large patch I helped with a SBQ and got the plansiterally at level 20.  My new alt character helped kill the SBQ 4 times in the last week (was not on the team that launched the nuke for successful kills) and every time I managed to loot her there was no decontamination shower plan.  I have enough pure flux and ultracite to build 2 shower at this point, but still no plan and it's getting frustrating since I dont know why. Its. Not. Dropping.
---
Dude you are obviously lying.  You know we can all see your post history 
---
It was a rhetorical question
---
What
---
You shouldn't need to, but better than being killed by a player.
---
I'm not endorsing the PVP in this game at all. I would rather have it removed.  I am only stating using a stim is the least impacting way to deal with the current state of the game.  Plus you get flooded with those especially after "Mayor for a day" quest.   I am often selling stims/super stims constantly on a daily basis because taking too much weight.   So really a stim is only worth like 3 caps to me, nothing more.   
---
Using Super Duper and Chemist has possibility of turning 1 stim into 6 diluted stims. (I think, have not played in a while)
---
My father uses stealth boys more often than buffout and has the armor that makes you invisible if you don’t move so it is probably a combo of those two. Just because someone’s farming it doesn’t mean they need a ban, many players farm off of WS, you just have bad luck and bad patience. 
---
&gt; I often find corpses or piles of legendary mobs inside and they alone are the only piles 
---
What platform? The game despawns corpses/meat piles for saving memory. Legendaries may stay simply longer due to recent patches made some adjustments. The club respawns in about 30 minutes or when a player (re-)joins the server and enters that location. Sometimes mobs die unexpectedly as part of client-server syncing.
---
&gt; someone is using super high sneak and glitching 
---
Why do you think so? Chameleon armor and Escape Artist perk may help a lot with stealth kills legitimately. Also there are Ghoul Slayer weapons and quite a lot of perk cards that can buff a weapon to one-hit kill ghouls.
---
*It just works.*
---
Is this compatible with the Better Inventory mod?
---
I always share the wealth at events if other Vault Dwellers are present and call out legendaries. When I am alone it's smashy time with the instigating sledge hammer. 
---
Not everyone plays fallout wanting PvP though, it's something thrown on that isn't required to enjoy the game
---
Get to be a dick and ban what you don't agree with. Sounds fun. 
---
There are other Acid deposits, and if you put you CAMP in a mineral/junk deposit location, or course you are going to get people to visit
---
I think it's a countdown, because it'll go 3-2-1 under the load icon after New World Found for me.
---
Have you tried building a raider proof CAMP? 
---
Legendary farming is a addiction, people should seek help. It's the same sociopathic behaviour as during these Black Friday sales, people leave all human decency at the door and become animals fighting over a kill.
---
I would ask if you are an idiot if you already haven't proved that twice.
---
If you were given the gift of understanding what you read, you wouldn't spam this post with your irrelevant bullshit. I am all about PvP. This game is not PvP enough for me. But I am able to do something you are unable to even think about - mainly, to consider perspective of other people.
---
You are a shitty person. 
---
First scorchbeast queen kill. Killing a level 75 player in pvp, I was level 30. AA dragon with a critical....
---
I’m not going to scour the map looking for a suitable place to put my camp after I already did that. I placed my camp away from everyone. If someone came shooting my camp I’d leave. I’m not going to waste my time moving it and editing it to make it work at the new location. 
---
I feel like they designed laser weapons primarily for use *against* the players rather than *by* the player. Also suspect that, because of this, buffing energy weapons would make energy weapons wielding ads annoying to deal with.
---
Nice that fight back that was chaotic because of all the stuff that spawns.
---
Well done on your gf and having a life. Weird flex but alright. I pasted the same thing because it was already covered as far as my experience goes.  I could type it out with different words but no... because it's already been said.
---
Being a level 65 doesn't make you griefed. 1) I have characters of different levels. The 1 griefing experience was on the highest. 2) a lack of time in-game doesn't mean you're griefed more. The more time you're in game the more chances any
---
Body and everybody has to do it. Having less time doesn't give more chances for griefing. If anybody feels that less time = lower level: most likely. If you feel that means you'll be griefed more: I hugely disagree. 3) people like me? Lol I'm a griefer now apparently.
---
Just upload the pic to imgur and then post the link in the text box of your post. 
---
We should be able to hang our photos in our camps as decorations 
---
I just recently went to Grafton steel to explore saw a bunch of super mutants just sitting but they were not real lol
---
My invisibility isn't a glitch! I have Bird Bones, Chameleon, Marsupial, Speed Demon and all the stealth perks, shadowed armour, muffled legs... I worked hard to be able to casually walk through groups of mobs without them noticing me! :)
---
Heres my build. Let me know if you have questions. I swap out cards based on situation.

---
I survived in one of those before 
---
Was gonna commit this I have a generator and terminal inside of my locked room
---
Well then there is nothing that can be done, you will just have to accept that someone might want to build where you have unfortunately.
---
What do you want all the acid for anyway?
---
That makes sense.  I've noticed a 2 flash for a second before the 1.  Thanks
---
Yeah that’s sometimes a good strategy.
---
You know what I think about when hearing there is a level 888 player? I NEED to murder him for those sweet caps!
---
There was 2 exploits that I know about for gaining xp that has been patched already.
---
1)  The tesla trap at one of the towers never disarmed when you disarm it.  Thus you could repeatedly click for xp.
---
2)  Kill whitesprings ghouls, server hop and repeat.   They used to give you huge xp 600-700+ xp each.   With a TSE weapon that one shots everything, you could gain quite a few levels in like 10 mins.    
---
Might have something to do with the interloper, the giant squid thing in lucky hole mine, there are like 6 of those faces in there
---
West-Tec + Armaments Event = 2 to 4 legendaries.
---
Each one of the three waves have chance of having legendary mob.  Guarantee of 1 at end.
---
1 legendary is usually inside the building.  
---
Well for me I enjoy working for my stuff just because it makes it a bit more fun but I can see where your coming from
---
Ok that is your own opinion thank for responding to what I said have a good one
---
I agree with this. I've only encountered one "griefer" in 150+ hours, PvP and contesting workshops is **not** griefing. Always on PvP was the dev intent with FO76 from the very beginning.
---
If people want to be invulnerable when in pacifist mode, then they shouldn't be allowed to hold workshops or participate in some events. Seems fair, as these are specifically for PvP.
---
Ugh this happened to me twice!! It’s really the worst! 
---
That sounds like fun.
---
Isnt that was a camp is for?
---
Even if Beth makes it I wouldn’t trust it for awhile. I feel like weapon cases would be Mama Dolce’s weapon/armor eater all over again.
---
You’d have t pvp AND WIN.
---
No, if you’re pacifist and just playing any griefer that pvps gets whisked to pvpland survival mode.
---
No legal pleading or excuses. Just go.
---
I fully understand that you'd not want to PvP. Yet the game was advertised as it being an intrinsic part of the experience.
---
So when you then buy said game and complain about one of the main characteristics of said game I can only come to the conclusion said person is entitled or dumb. 
---
If you don't like how a game is setup, don't buy it. 
---
Why are you so adamant you’re correct in what you’re saying? That’s your experience, you can’t project that to everyone else and expect them to agree with you, because the majority won’t. 
---
I wasn’t saying play the game how I do, I was making a suggestion as yeah first time round I had a difficult time but this save it’s been fantastic to play. 
---
Your frustrations don’t apply to everyone, I hope you enjoy the game once you find a way. 
---
Some are a bit overzealous when killing legendaries, especially 3\* ones. I try to share kills as much as I can, but I often have to chose between sharing and not dying when mobbed/overwhelmed. Some players don't pay attention, not even to the "Come here" emote. I had a few players emoting me angry faces, then they completely ignored me when I dropped the legendary loot at their feet.
---
Reread my comment. Listen to comprehend not to respond.
---
I’m going to pretend like the water Purifiers make sense there, great job, might consider moving my camp now
---
I added Armor Piercing with Tank Killer - I love my Bloodied LA!
---
What platform are you on? One of the guys in my discord server was talking about getting a slap damage kill earlier...
---
Did you miss where the person be was responding to "please make it yoir last" in response of him saying it was the first time he ever posted here. Yeah that absolutely is telling him what he can say.
---
You shut your mouth about that.
---
“Consensual” *forces pvp by contesting workshop*
---
I actually have been doing exactly this. I even waited to after level 50 to get the highest level full Raider PA from Rose.
---
I’ve heard some say it’s a praying mantis and it’s classified as an insect. 
---
It was advertised as a part, yet isn't massively pushed and mostly avoidable. The game isn't broken without it, so people just not wanting to take part and play either solo or coop without dealing with other people is fine.
---
As it is, pacifist simply stops accidentally attacking someone, so is the same as just never opting in to PvP.
---
Exactly, I could be convinced to pvp if its a fair fight, but being probably the lowest level player on the server, the prospect of being killed by someone much higher level than me, isn't my idea of fun. 
---
Well you do realize if you let someone shoot the legendary just once, they can get loot as well as you do.
---
Killing it completely without letting them hit it once is considered rude now.   This is yet another reason why those with TSE got such a bad reputation.  They one shot legendary and no one else could get loot.
---
There are those that went the opposite direction and got a Tesla rifle that does minimal damage and shoots AoE.   So they can hit all the mobs yet, not kill them.
---
TLDR all of it but I like what I did read, it took some brain cells, have some Silver.  
---
They make me uneasy just looking at them! I don't think a C.A.M.P. was ever supposed to be here, so some of the placement is odd... suits me perfectly though as I only have to go down to ground level to harvest my adhesives :)
---
If a toxic game like GTA5 can have a functioning passive mode and that game is basically grind, grief or gtfo then FO76 a game that is supposed to be based on community, cooperation, and rebuilding should have one too. Or at least give us seperate PvP and PvE servers. 
---
It would certainly make the comprehending part go smoothier if it were comprehensible. I read it three times being unable to decipher the point of it before writing 'what'. Since then I read it four more times and I am yet to guess what it says.
---
There's nothing more consensual. You're warned before taking a workshop that it can initiate PVP. My clicking yes you are agreeing to be murdered. Thank you for the caps and why the %&amp;\*# do you have 800 cloth?
---
i would say animals behave better, I have seen some shit that not even animals would do for a TV or a game console
---
You don't need a large amount of damage to stagger with melee. I can stagger things with a freaking level 5 combat knife on any of my ranged builds. It is a guaranteed stagger with a melee power attack regardless of damage.
---
I'll do it for free on XBox.
---
How do you harvest adhesives? Is there like a glue stash or something?
---
How do you get a tissue to dance?
---
Put a lil boogie in it :)
---
lots of stuff in the public  domain  though  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF7dVuP9SsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF7dVuP9SsE)
---
There was a conelrad mod for fallout 4 
---
that would fit in 
---
Agreed.  The exception was if I saw TSE wielder 1 shotting them, all bets are off and I would demonstrate that a  Exploding The Dragon could kill legendaries just as quickly as they could.   Plus the long wait between legendary spawns give me just enough time to finish reloading that thing once...
---
I mean just put yourself on pacifist mode,and if you server hop ur base is rebuilded instantly
---
I enjoy it, certainly :)
---
High level enemies are usually something predictable, and not take your look once you die. Plus, scorchbeasts right now are annoying anyway, especially with my build
---
Oh that's interesting, I'll have to try that.
---
I don't think anyone gets just how much of an advantage being the one being attacked puts you at, in the current PvP system unless they are in full assassin's sentinel if your both over 50 the defender should just one shot the attacker then hop server with the free caps.
---
for the daily quest : remove squatters from kernwood mine :
---
you fall into the huge  hole straight in front as you enter the mine
---
then you swim in the general direction of the quest marker
---
it will take you up and it ends when you see concrete building again
---
you just have to pass through the gate of the security office, it is not a building inside the mine. this got me confused.
---
Good luck, it took me two rad x as a complete newbie !
---
u/TVxStrange plz
---
dueling back from WOW days.... challenge a friend, they accept, countdown to begin, fight until someone gets stopped at 1hp, fight over.......i mean, that's usually when i would gank somebody with my rogue (from the other side of course)
---
Yeah you can get them from any of the savage divide events. 
---
If you want to use caps instead of resources to rebuild, just move your base. When you move your base, all camp items get repaired automatically.
---
True but depends what tse they have my handmade isnt a one shot so have mercy. Lol.
---
Sorry, I just mean the Corn, Mutfruit and Tatos I have in that little garden. Two of each and a boiled/purified water for Vegetable Starch, which scraps to two Adhesive :)
---
Oh wow I didn’t know that, thanks for the tip
---
Besides eating and drinking the “realistic” nature of the game ends there. I don’t think realism was even considered when two shot exploding weapons have been around forever or how I can carry 90 cans of dog food along with 15 big weapons in my vault tech shirt pocket. Pvp is trash in this game. Either the aggressors should lose ALL the items on their person, or pvp shouldn’t exist. Clearly this medium they’ve invented  isn’t pandering to either side.
---
That's not true, exp for ghouls was around 400, not 600-700.  
---
if the person doesn't come to defend, they arent consenting ;)
---
This is a good solution, wish they had essentially opt-out of PvP servers in general
---
Power armor frame naming.
---
Perk loadout saving (I feel very spoiled on PC having Perk Loadout Manager)
---
Much more obvious “your camp is under attack!” Messages. I’ve come back to camp too many times with my turrets toasted and half my walls gone. 
---
Able to drop keys. Seriously. Given that you can pick up duplicate keys (and some quests make you; Battle Bot for one, and those keys don’t even stack!) my Misc inventory is getting ridiculous.
---
Oooh bake-in Better Inventory’s features (again, I’m spoiled on PC)
---
Watoga is now how Whitesprings used to be early on in the game.
---
I've been (unsuccessfully) jumped in Watoga more and more often these days.  Usually it goes something like:
---
*  Random guy asks to trade.
---
*  I walk away.
---
*  I hear explosions and see loads of white "you're being hit in pacifist mode" rings.
---
*  Pacifist comes off, I pretend like it's still on, he hits me again, and then he dies when he pauses.
---
( Player vendors  \* Players looking at vendor list \* items returned ) = you really want more spinning arrows? 
---
Hey Bethesda replies to a post 2 days ago saying they are fixing pacifist mode to where if you have it on no one can kill you, you can’t kill others, and no one can destroy your camp. Definitely what I’ve been wanting. 
---
When you move your camp all your camp items are repaired automatically, so you'll even have the ones they destroyed.
---
I'm not hot about people being rude,  but this game is ment to be played how you want to.  If raiders want to raid,  well get good or server hop. But you are also right in that pvp  should have a stronger negative outcome. 
---
I was in this same boat before, and this is exactly why I was skeptical of PvP in a fallout game.
---
I mean killing the legendary enemy before letting others tag it is kinda a jerk move. I wouldn't yell at you in chat, but maybe give you a thumbs down emote while grumbling to myself in my room. Let others get in on the loot bro!
---
Wait so your camp will be rebuild instantly if you put on pacifist mode and server hop or just server hop only? 
---
Understood . 
---
You don’t understand what I’m saying. You’re either intentionally ignoring my points or not capable of understanding the logic.
---
This confirms my suspicions you’re another entitled griefer looking to push your agenda. Not looking to debate and educate you. Not my job. Downvoting and blocking you.
---
Because I always have the shits and need it for tp. 
---
&gt;While I understand your frustration on this subject, you would be well served to accept the fact that this version of Fallout is fundamentally different from the past ones in that other players, that you don't know and can't control, will be in there with you.  I always loved the "venturing the wasteland alone " aspect and play this version as close to that as I can.  That's my  style.  It isn't for all.  As others have replied in this post to you, there are tools available to you to minimize and avoid the adolescent griefers and 20 year old punks that can and do and will play this game.   Heed their advice and make use of the information, it's all there is.  Or fight back the best you can until you win. If it feels like you are being "bullied off the server", then maybe you need to find a different game to play that fits your style.  I wish you luck and hope you can learn to enjoy this game for what it is and I will promise you one thing: You will meet more good, honest players who will always help you and a lot of others who, at the very least,  just leave you alone to do your thing in peace
---
Man this is crazy. That never happens to me. When I asks me if I want to join a new world, it puts me in one and my camp is placed. Weird. 
---
888..how is that even possible. The highest ive seen is 280 or close to that.
---
 Im 160...i think....and the last 50 levels have been spent doing basicly nothing, and picking up legendarys when i feel like it.  New coooooonnnttteennttt please...
---
So I leave and find someone who does!
---
Ha.  I was just referring to mainly the TSE Shutgunners who were quite popular in the past. Since patch 5, the TSE have been greatly reduced and ability to 1 shot everything has been greatly scaled back.   Bloodied and Melee can do it, but normal TSE have trouble doing that anymore.   
---
I am just basing this off prior experience as I have not played since patch 4.    Even then, I ran into at least 4 seperate people 1 shotting legendaries in Uranium Event.  One of those took out the TSE when legendary showed up just to be jerk about it.  But used other weapons for the normal mobs.   He did not want anyone to get a hit in.
---
Nope.  Just keep building them and scrapping them.  Eventually you'll learn the suppressor mod.  Remember that you can build the lowest level guns to save materials, and to use Super Duper to get extras, and Scrapper to get more materials back.
---
Me: why are you attacking me, level 57 person?
---
They: I like your 280 caps after your level.
---
Me: Do you have steel? I'm willing to buy a lot, 1-2 caps each. You'd get way more caps that way.
---
They: That's not fun.
---
Me: I don't PvP and the fact you challenged me as a level 57 tells me you think you can one-shot me somehow. I don't have to interact with you at all and stay safe. So care to trade?
---
They: \*\*\*\* you.
---
Ikr. I was so happy when I got my first one. Then I looked at the stats and thew it down. So pissed off.
---
I'd have spent hours longer looking for Wonderglue if someone hadn't told me! ;D
---
This would be awesome
---
Too bad, because this comment you wrote is actually completely understandable.
---
The trade menu needs to be overhauled to show offers on the same screen as everything else. I think more people would trade if it were more user friendly. I swear people just walk away from trades sometimes because they didn’t look at the “offers” screen.
---
Yeah it could be done, and other looter-shooters like The Division do it. New Vegas and 4 both got a survival/hardcore mode post-release. Hopefully Fallout 76 gets something similar, where the fundamental rules change to make the game more difficult, the risks higher. Though I don't know how it would work without being a separate game mode that splits the player base.
---
I picked a bad day to stop hoarding my ammo...
---
Custom holotape games would be awesome. They could bring back BASIC programming and slap it in game.
---
Well Rested is what gives you the extra 5% exp ; Well Tunes gives you +25% ap regeneration
---
How will it change it? Ive read about the Prestige system, but of the posts are speculation.
---
If I run into a kid, they get blocked.  My own kids are enough for me.  I don't want to tend to other people's kids as well.
---
Misleading.
---
If you server hop once your base is destroyed your base - with the exception of the turrets that somehow often fix themselves - will remain destroyed.
---
If however you move your base it gets 'packed' and the individual broken items fixed.
---
You still need to relocate though and in most cases rebuild the base unless is one of those designs that use a single foundation piece at ground level.
---
Why don't you people just make friends? You drop goods but they don't reciprocate, you don't talk or plan or protect each other? You're being used like a tool.
---
Bethesda is the tough mother pushing you out of your house; yes you might have to deal with bullies but it's also an opportunity to make friends!
---
Yeah I'll just try to get splash damage on big groups with tse then switch to melee. Works good for me, sometimes you just get that one asshole you has to ruin it for everyone.
---
Very First day of BETA, lots of people. It was so cool and exciting. We all just stood around for awhile emoting at each other after we figured it out, and I even teamed up with a few of them!
---
I love this game, but I don’t have a problem with criticizing design decisions where it’s warranted, and the emphasis on PvP is a definitive miscalculation, considering the demographic the game appeals to in the first place. 
---
totally understand... im not a "raider" but I'll still contest a workshop for funsies if i get bored exploring/farming for the night. Sometimes it's an epic back and forth, sometimes I 1 shot them in the head....either way, if they are good sport I'll drop a baggy of whatever type of workshop it is so its worth their while ... keep up the good work spicing up the game
---
I deleted my custom, and normal ini files and it fixed it
---
Wait and see, in the meantime down vote reposts.
---
I think we can sell it in the player vending machine that's coming in the vending dlc, if we can't people will be mad.
---
OwO
---
That's a nice one, but doesn't the explosive remove the visual effects of the flamer's flames?
---
Tldr: If you can't take the rads, stay in the vault. 
---
The best thing you can do is store your junk. Killing players is very rewarding. I make thousands of caps each day in casual pvp exchanges. In most cases, thousands more because people tend to carry salable junk with them. One tends to forget that this game is designed to promote both positive and negative interactions between players. I hunt players over lvl 100 because they most likely know what they're doing and the payout is amazing. Nothing is more satisfying than watching a fool with tse weapons die repeatedly trying to salvage whatever junk and pride they can manage. 
---
Pvp itself doesn’t, it’s the pro-criminal rules set up by Bethesda. 
---
Almost anything you can search in the game is instanced.  That means that if you look in a safe or crate, you will see loot and can take it.  I will see other loot and can take it.  Legendary enemies work the same way PROVIDED you have hit the enemy.
---
The normal protocol in events like uranium fever is that when a legendary appears, each person hits it once.  After everyone has tagged it, THEN you finish it off.  That way everyone gets legendary loot from it.   Those guys were mad because you killed it before they could get a hit in.
---
Raiders should have a Metal station! 
---
Might be a future "dlc". . .
---
Passive mode will make it so if you accidentally hit a player it will do nothing to them
---
I've always thought it should be level dependent. Meaning you can only PVP with someone if they are the same or a higher level than yourself to initially start a fight. So if I'm level 20 and want to try my hand at taking down a level 50, then it's my risk. But once I hit him/her once, they can totally attack back at full damage because I'm the one who started it. But as a level 20 wandering around I shouldn't be worried about a level 50 player attacking me just for the "fun" of it.
---
Bases could be tied to the players level as well so that the pieces don't take damage from players if their level is higher. Though I wonder if this might be too tricky to incorporate because of creatures being able to do damage to camps even though their levels vary.
---
I’ve been farming to for my player vending. What’s wrong with people just wanting to play their game and do what they want? 
---
Also if you see no problem in killing a legendary AT an event WHEN people are considered on YOUR team then don’t whine about them farming for things. If you killed a legendary at whitesprings durning a nuke then that’s fine because very man for himself. 
---
I tried to set up the minimum viable camp. It was an in-tents experience. 
---
You sometimes maybe will get griefed but if that happens just join another server
---
A way to save and quickly change out perk builds. 
---
Prestige will fix this, stop reposting!
---
Educate me, ridiculous, earn to write an asshat sentence without asshatting asshat asshateverywhere. Lern2spek
---
I dump stuff there or the vendor cash register in Flatwoods. I've dumped thousand of rounds of ammo and only keep the two types that work with my weapon. Now I'm thinking I shoukd have kept them all stashed? I will now.
---
My response when hearing of a lvl 888 is bruh, do you even KNOW what a vagina feels like?
---
I would say the game is enjoyable by yourself just a bit more challenging 
---
I tired that, it just wasnt showing up on the compass...
---
And these guys sound great to be around because you can just tag along and share in the spoils.  Not sure why you're upset, unless you think they are keeping you from getting things (they aren't).
---
Yeah this forum loves it when they put out half baked patches.
---
I'm level 207 I worked my ass off fighting players who did just that. I rooted myself in the situation and adjusted my base to be as basic and inexpensive as possible, I made friends to call for assistance and learned how to defend myself.
---
I suggest you do the same and stop crying about it like a baby. You can deal with it and get better or cry/bitch/moan and leave the game all together.
---
Good luck buddy. Been looking for weeks. Seen one for sale on reddit. Guy was wanting 7k for it. That is ridiculous. Before the last patch they were easier to find but now they are a rarity. If you happen to find one let me know where, I'll do the same. Good luck

It was fun until the bugs wear you down.
---
I play solo - having a blast. Getting griefed is luck of the server draw, really - I've had a few random encounters with people following me around shooting at me. Thumb's down emote has come in handy. Leaving the server also works - had to use that with a couple scorchbeasts circling my camp like buzzards, too...
---
Ok, perhaps your right, but it was insane xp.  It was boss-level xp being giving out for mobs capable of being 1 shot.  
---
The problem is those little scumbags tend to go in groups, like rats do, so you have to be aware to block all the kids of the gang…
---
btw, I would like the Bethesda's workers patrolling this sub enter to say something in these critical threads. Apparently they only intervene to comment photos, stories, "soft" posts... 
---
The screw bottle neck is why I stopped playing.
---
Is this a religion now? Are the people that don't like the game just corrupted and lack "clear heads"? Do you need a specific thetan level to like this poorly reviewed and badly selling game? 
---
You represent the most toxic of players.
---
You like gambling?
---
Man, don't listen to the haters. The games got it's issues sure, but what Bethesda games doesn't? They're working on it. At least fallout isn't bricking consoles. If you like fallout, you'll probably like fallout 76. It's just more fallout, with friends.
---
Yes. It is.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
I had a guy sell me the torso plan last night for 1.5k but havent found someone with the limbs yet. I been going to all the locations it supposedly spawns but the RNG hates me. Lol
---
Use the tools available to you, block them and server hop. Sorry that you lost something because someone wanted to PvP you. You knew what the rules were when you signed up.  
---
That or take a break from actually playing the game and lobby incessantly for Adventure mode to be Care Bear eXtreem and Survival to be a gritty death match. Start a campaign on reddit about it. That's what this is, right?
---
On occasion. I don't make a habit of it though.
---
I would totally pay 7k
---
&gt; but this game is ment to be played how you want to
---
The OP and I want to play the game without PvP.  Thank you for validating that we should have that option.
---
They shouldn't be able to raid with impunity, though. Totally agree with the negative outcome suggestion.
---
Yeah I was going to tell that person they are wrong. My base has been attacked and when I got the message, I left instantly and found a new world. My stuff didn’t not get fixed and I had to repair it myself. 
---
Show me somebody 1 hit killing another player in pacifist with slap damage (as you say above).
---
I didn't 'manage to avoid' anything. I've accepted almost every friend invite and team invite I've ever had, bar several times I've been busy. I blocked two players because they would not shut up or stop shouting over chat when it was a crowded area. That wasn't the griefer but was just somebody really annoying. That's pretty much it. I've traded with dozens of people. I fast travel around vendors and events where there are other players. If there's a nuke going on I might jump in. I've not avoided contact or chances to grief me.
---
The other day I wanted to get a level 7 character across to Harper's ferry. That was going to be a slog. So I put down a map marker, checked the map and invited a level 200+ that was most of the way there already. They accepted and it turned out it was there camp they were at. I gave a wave. They did. I ran off I to the wilderness. What I didn't expect was for them to follow me and babysit me the whole way. Once I got to the vendor; they waved goodbye, left my team and went on their way. Never saw them again.
---
For the record: I'm totally **for** the change you describe. No PVP in the existing mode would be very reassuring. I just don't see it as being more important than the upcoming DLC though.
---
What system are you on that's got so many griefers? And what are they doing to grief you?
---
We really need more songs and radio station when you play by yourself it's sad to hear the same songs over and over again 
---
This would be horrible.
---
Million plus players uploading images to Bethesda so that their photos can be seen by other players. I am very doubtful Bethesda could pull that off without major issues.
---
Yeah, there are probably LOTS of meat piles there from the previous players (all empty for you because you didn't shoot them) and as they vanish from the server, the legendaries go last so that people have more time to grab the valuable loot.  
---
Its' not invisible players, it's just how the game works.  When you kill a bunch of ghouls, their bodies will become meat piles too and the meat piles will eventually vanish one by one - probably leaving the legendaries for last.
---
Dont let the bad reviews sway your decision. The internet is full of assholes. The stability was crap at first but it has greatly improved, not perfect but much better. And with new dlc coming this game is only going to keep improving. Look forward to seeing you in the wasteland.
---
I usually let players alone around the cars but get some ghouls next to them and boom! 
---
Yeah its doable.....my melee 1 shots gouls all day. If i wanted to go stealth and use all that stuff im sure i could do the same thing. I doubt its a glitch
---
Yeah, I'm glad, but even then I need either a megaton of fuel/acid.
---
Flamer and Cryolator ammo are extremely rare(Even more so the Cryo Cells), and expensive to make even the slightest amount of either ammo. I feel like that should increase how many rounds are made by default, it's kinda unbalanced of how fast they shoot for how much ammo you can obtain.
---
Unfortunately no opinion. It’s my experience with the game. I’d love to play it, but this is a gamebreaker. 
---
PS4 just use Spotify. That's how I do it for now. 
---
Ah I see what you mean. But hey thanks for chatting with me. Makes me happy that people will not just complain about the game
---
I don't think you're aware of the purpose behind most of the Vault Tech vaults. None of them involved happy time puppies and rainbows.
---
It's every bit as likely that VT was lying about the entire thing, and vault 76 was filled with psychotic mental cases, you know, for "science".
---
Im level 10 and it happened once. Some level 60 guy stole my gov supply drop and followed me to my camp afterwards. Destroyed it 2 times and killed me a few times -.-
---
I play solo mostly and I really like thoroughly exploring locations and the map. The game is perfectly fine solo, just challenging, and the map is really awesome. Take your time leveling up and don’t rush through the quests. It’ll be fine. I’m on pc and Xbox and only met a few asshats but plenty of good people. Never had my camp attacked. (Knocks on wood)
---
Well that's why they become wanted. But it should be no dam 5 caps. It should automatically be 1000 caps. Caps aren't hard to get and of u want to go be rudely should be ready to pay up like in real world. It would make people think twice and still allow u to be raider 
---
What system are you on and what are they doing to grief you?
---
I won't lie to you, random internet stranger. I find it hard to believe you have been griefed 100 times in 500 hours. I hope that doesn't come across as too rude. I know these dicks exist (wouldn't it be nice if every pay in the world was nice?) but that's crazy.
---
As a bit of a sideline... FO76 is plenty happy to reuse assets and code from older Bethesda games (I have zero problem with that), so I’d love it if we could get bows and arrows at some point. The animations and much of the code is already in place; you just need some more contemporary-looking bows. 
---
To me it’s simple - either you hold your ground and fight or you bail which may or may not include a server hop. 
---
I typically never instigate unless it’s some tool camped out at WS with their stupid missile and turret camp out back.  They are just asking for it. 
---
r/fo76 is more focused on issues of the game and more technical discussions
---
For photos and a lighter atmosphere visit r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
lots of absurd nonsense can be found through many cultures I suppose lol
---
Well if you abuse the block and block so many that there is no longer server where aint player who aint in your block list, then solution ins very simple... Fallout 4- If you arent capable of handling other player, then play a game where is no other players.
---
Thanks for the correction. Mixed those up. I just do both when I run back to camp. 
---
ain’t passing judgment, just simply saying I don’t 
---
Shhhh don't tell everyone.
---
So my fault for hanging out in my workshop then.  Okay.  I didn’t know I was asking for it dressing this way. 
---
The game is all about it once past 50+. If you wanna be able 2 solo you need good tier weps, that mean trading or hours of gambling/farming
---
You can't steal a supply drop unless it was junk and you dropped it when killed.
---
I think he was referring to in game screenshots through the photo mode lol.   
---
Not just any old pictures 
---
Which platform? PC is relatively safe from griefers as they can't follow you explicitly, unlike on consoles for some reason. If you remove yourself from PvP (i.e., not capturing/holding workshops, not having certain PvP-glitching items) then it is great for solo/co-op. Note that it is a bit grindy (especially when solo) and many mechanics are not well explained in-game. I'd say you can even ask for help from mid-levels (70-120) to get you level up faster at certain locations as they are usually also trying to level up (but don't hit as hard so you have a chance to tag too). If you liked Fallout 4 and you were a big looter/hoarder, you'll enjoy Fallout 76 a lot (and curse a lot too).
---
I have played hundreds of hours (PC) without being griefed at all. Solo all the way. If you like exploring, looting, shooting and leveling it’s very good. If you need a story driven game to have fun this one is not for you.
---
Don’t know where the “judgement” part came from or why even reply to a post from 4 days ago but alrighty then 
---
Amen I don't pvp to much, but when I do, I wreck and make friends. At the end it's just a game. 
---
Yes, finding ammo should be one of the most valuable trade items, instead with the ammo we collect inadvertently, we end up dropping it on the ground at Whitesprings.
---
It would be great to be able to at least break it down to lead, steel etc, a potion of what would be needed to make it.
---
Right now I do not bother picking up ammo I don't use,  plastic pumpkin heads are more useful in the post apocalyptic wasteland apparently.
---
Ammo is also way overpriced for how effective guns are, I have never bought ammo, not even in a pinch.
---
Criminal mentality?  Okey donkey! 
---
I also dislike the threads that are posted as if the suggestion is a new implementation. 
---
I was like oh cool, such and such sounds nice! Only to click on the thread and it says suggestion. 
---
Rimmer would disapprove of your PSN.
---
How would they determine this. Photomode just adjusts the screen to make a nice pic. The your comp takes a screenshot of the screen. The photo doesn't come from a Bethesda server. It is generated on your comp and never leaves your comp.
---
replied because I’m only ever on reddit maybe once a week, secondly it seemed you took offense to my original statement 
---
no. OP asked the community for their thoughts on age of children playing. you specifically replied to me (a parent) saying "you shouldn't be letting your kids play it." that is unsolicited parenting advice directed towards me (and i'd assume any parent) not a general comment towards the OP and your opinion towards this discussion as a whole.
---
I think he meant photos from the in game photo mode. For example screenshots of you and your team exploring and posing next to slain creatures like in the trailer. Or a photo of you launching your first nuke. Or a photo of past camps. Would give the new upcoming camera item a lot more value.
---
I lock picked it and while I was browsing through the goods they disappeared because he stole them and walked off before following me.
---
I’m playing FO76 as a large FO4 DLC. The multiplayer stuff, I can take or leave. 
---
Eh, being able to sell it to vendors would make caps even more useless than they alrady are. Someone brought up an idea to be able to "bulk" ammo in say ammo boxes of 100 rounds each, and the boxes have a value of aaround 50 caps (sell to vedor for around 30 or whatever, depends on ammo. I think that is the absolute best solution. No one buys 1 round for 1 cap. That's stupid expensive. 
---
if ypu can see it you can climb it - todd howard
---
Moby Dick would want one, but he's on xbox.
---
What the hell are you talking about? 
---
People like you have commented like I've said something that defends the game when I haven't, I just said my experience this time around is more enjoyable due to this play style.
---
I don't care about sale figures and reviews, you listen to that then you're a sheep. Form your own opinion, and if you still don't like it, don't attack other people who enjoy it.
---
It’s fun. Don’t understand the salt. Taking my time and just exploring everything.
---
I think it would be great if there were a dedicated PVP server but don’t assume all of the assholes and griefers would automatically gravitate to that environment. 
---
It’s part of the game.  Kind of like the badass radscorpion you don’t see and he jumps out and stings you in the ass.  
---
That's an acceptable idea, probably should have been something in game already. Unfortunately, I don't think it would cut down on the number of people complaining because they died to another player, or the overuse of the word "griefing".
---
I've never had a bounty, is there no indication outside of a text box you have one? 
---
There is - you're dead since most everything is a 1 shot. It's intended to provoke multiple matches, have you ever actually PVP'd?
---
Why don't you people just make friends, and try to win?
---
I’m not but I have to admit for me griefing has been super rare and I’ve only had to change servers once. One of the things I really like about this game is in my experience the playerbase has been really good. Keep in mind my basis of comparison is rockstar games and they really attract assholes (I have to regularly change servers if I play gta online though their new anti griefer measures in red dead make it easier to avoid assholes. Funny how they won’t implement them in gta where they make most their money...). 
---
Anyways, I do agree bethesda should have private servers (plus then people can form strict rp groups that way and that would be awesome). But I haven’t found it to be a big problem thankfully. 
---
It's also great seeing the people who raid get wrecked after. But your 100% right bethesda isn't here to hold ur hand. It's hard on these streets. Team up and join a group or dissolve into the background and get wrecked. Most people who complain are the ones with useless tse weapons and crap builds. Why doesn't my tse/anit armor handmade kill u. Cuz u ain't got no dam skill. 
---
Claiming a workshop could give everyone in the team the notification that they are entering PVP and not just the person taking it. I've killed team members before who had no idea they were red. I have a rule... "you're red you're dead" when contesting workshops because when I ignore red people just standing their watching they invariably shoot me in the back.
---
It would also be nice to be able to forgive another person or team when you accidentally enter combat. We frequently have 8+ people in party chat with multiple teams killing ghouls and pretty much every time we're flagged red to one another.
---
I had someone do that to me last night while I was playing with some friends.  We took bog town and the asshole sniped all of us. I was just about to transfer 100 screws to the stash when it happened. Luckily one of my other friends logged on and killed him. He raged quit shortly thereafter
---
I understand. Photomode is nothing special. It just let's you move the point of view around then tells your comp to take a screenshot. The photo never touches a Bethesda game server. It is generated and stays on your comp. Thus any implementation of this idea would require uploading files to share across players on the server and would be open to posting non photomode images.
---
Exactly. My boyfriend band I both have 2 characters (after getting bored with the 1st and wanting to replay the game a different way) and we both help lower level players even on our second characters which are under level 20. We've both had players who are always 4x our levels or more come and grief us. 
---
Why would anyone punish themselves like that the boredom must be intense.
---
Bandit power armor? Where do you find that? Just hit 60 and haven't see any of those. 
---
This.  I drop frag grenades at my feet when I get swarmed by ghouls now and stim pack immediately after.  All good.
---
My friend who played the BETA and hated it has been playing and enjoying the game. He likes taking his time and exploring and doing quests with me.
---
He's also really into building and enjoys the camp systems.
---
His main complains are
---
-The console UI, controls, setup, etc. This stuff shouldn't exist on PC.
---
-Camp budget/not being able to place items you find in the world in your camp
---
I honestly think that's it. He seems to like this game. He got it for less than 15$ and that's definitely a more than fair deal. 
---
Not really. It's actually for forced pvp.
---
What system are you on? 
---
solicit: ask for or try to obtain (something) from someone.
---
Little kids in the game? Who thinks that's right?
---
I think it's wrong because super mutant meatballs are nightmare fuel that will disturb your kids.
---
Are you one of those small vocabulary nerds who say literaLEEEE 100X a day?
---
I hope so. I want artillery to be worth it.
---
Also I want to add. The Caps bounty doesn't work because your friend can actually kill you and take the reward for killing you and then just trade you and buy a bobby pin to give you all your money back
---
Ditto. The ones who aren't salty are invited to team up and I mod their stuff or talk strategy. You as well!
---
Would agree its pretty rare, now on my 3rd character and have had maybe 3 pvp experiences. 1 griefer, 1 wanting to duel with black powder pistols (fun roleplayer), and 1 annoyance. Maybe 300 hours for me?
---
I think that 1/100 hours is a reasonable level of muppetry to deal with, but others seem to have ratios nearer to 1:10 than 1:100.
---
Look. Bethesda said only 2 days ago they were going to change pacifist mode. Making it to where you can’t kill other players, they can’t kill you, and your camp can’t get destroyed. If someone “with pacifist mode on” killed someone, then they obviously didn’t have it on and now they have a bounty on their head. If they took a workshop without reading the messaging saying that they were agreeing to pvp then that’s their problem. But sure if a better notification system will help people that want to stay far away from pvp then go on ahead. 
---
But if that person claimed a workshop and failed to read the message then that’s on them. I don’t do workshops anymore because I hate pvp in this game. 
---
If you like a exploration and adventure experience you won't have to worry about the rng. That's for people who play it like a mmo lite. Bethesda did a good job kinda allowing for multiple play styles 
---
Ha, funny! I bet you a poor pitiful person in retail that is not even a manager. 
---
You seriously confused me with the GM1 &amp; GM2 haha I was thinking what they could stand for? but hope your experience gets better!
---
yes there are level 1 hazmat suits. power plants have them, some mines do as well.
---
If you look at the Mire from the Savage Divide you'll see a small patch of trees elevated much higher than the woodland around it, it's there. For a while I thought it was just a draw distance error/graphical glitch but it's the spot pictured, Tanagra Town. East of Harpers Ferry. 
---
Well kinda hard to tell through text huh? No. What you do is what you do. Simple. I’m my own person so are you. Who cares. I get annoyed with wiki pages for this game because their info can be completely wrong sometimes. That’s all. 
---
You should have left when you realized what was happening.
---
Im not familiar with how it actually works in regards to where that screenshot file comes from when you take a in game pic. If it works like the way you say it does I can see how that could become a problem. But I think if they were able to make it work the spirit of the idea is a good idea.
---
Yes, they exist. There is a level 10 damaged hazmat suit in the locker room of the Poseidon Nuclear Power Plant I know for sure as I had to fetch one for a level 15 teammate.
---
pm'ed
---
I looked through this page a while ago to find one. I actually got 2 from the power plant next to the Charleston train station.
---
https://www.shacknews.com/article/108564/hazmat-suit-locations-in-fallout-76
---
It is irritating to have to stop what you are doing and load into a new server. Not to mention if you were fighting a legendary mob that you were enjoying or in the middle of an event, yes leaving the server matters. Now I have only been griefed once so far (minus the beta but it seems the beta chases away a lot of the assholes), but that doesn’t mean I can’t understand why telling some one just change servers is just excusing Bethesda for not making better anti griefing measures. They really should have at least pve servers (better yet private servers so people can also do things like group up to do a strict rp server) or make pacifist so that player bullets also don’t hurt you or your camp. 
---
Honestly this happens the other directions as well. 
---
I had 3 players all lvl 60-70 team up and take me out while farming at WS a few days ago.  I wasn’t paying close enough attention and got ganked.  125 caps down the crapper.  I took out 1 of them in the process and was taking down another when their buddy got me.  I went back for some revenge and they had already bailed.  So is life in the wasteland. 
---
Smart raiders be raiding.
---
Getting the same issue pretty frequently.
---
I tend to always Stay on This World now so I can go checkout what someone else built in my location.... the majority of the time I cannot find ANY CAMP overlapping my build site.
---
Yesterday I decided to start up a fresh character in order to easily get the weekly level up challenges done.  As soon as my new Level 2 toon stepped out the vault door.... I got the PopUP for Your Camp Can Not Be Placed.  I don't have a CAMP... I just set foot out of the vault.  
---
I ran down to the river to get a Beer Hat (remember this toon is trying to level up fast with the Beer Hat challenge), no Hat on the corpse.  OK I'll log out and hop to another server.  Took two hops to find the Hat, each time I logged in I got the Your Camp Could Not Be Placed popup.  Again, I am a fresh out of the vault level 2 character that has never set down my camp and still has the Misc. Quest objective showing to place my camp for the first time.
---
&gt; not being able to place items you find in the world in your camp
---
Have your friend glance at the [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) ;)
---
Praise be!
---
If you allow ammo to be traded to a vendor, that immidiately sets the value of a single round to 1 cap minimum. If you participated even a little in the economy this game DOES HAVE then you would know, no one buys ammo for 1 cap per round. It's usually ..5-.7 caps per round. Negatively impacting the player economy if allowed to sell to vendors for 1 cap each. no one would ever buy ammo from another player again because no one would be selling it to other player. They'd all be selling it to vendors. 
---
The two people here complaining about how this game "has no economy" clearly have not participated enough in the actual player economy that does exist.
---
I use a Furious Combat Rifle and four mirelurks spawn near my CAMP. I usually kill them twice every gaming session. The bug has been fixed and has come back. Now this health regeneration bug has been quite consistent, making me spend a full clip per mirelurk almost every time when I otherwise get away with 2-3 headshots.
---
"level 5"
---
Drinking is radical at first until cirrhosis wears you down! 
---
...like the Harvester from FO4: Far Harbor, which has the Staggering effect ;-) 
---
I'm a noob on XB1 and the FO76 community has been insanely helpful and kind to me. I hit level 8 last night and am going to get back into the story missions for a bit. 
---
Could you elaborate on the weight reduction perks? Are those cards? I'm aiming for a rifle/sniper build right now so a lot of points in P I A &amp; L. 
---
For my point distribution, should I spread it out across all of them or go heavy on one and then move on to the next. 
---
Since this is my first fallout game, I have 0 expectations for it. I played for 3 hours straight last night fighting super mutants and scorched after I lit some torch at a meditation center(?). Sooooo much loot and exploring - I cant get enough. I need to learn the weight management a bit more and learn what is keep/stash/sell/drop. 
---
Any tips are greatly appreciated! See you out there! 
---
You purposely misinterpreted his statement. If you want to play game with rainbows and sunshine, why are you playing a post apocalyptic survival game that **has always been promoted as a PvP** game?
---
Some guy was trying to grief my boyfriend (on his higher level character) and the guy was even higher level. My boyfriend fought back and killed the guy (who I'm assuming didn't expect it). Guy dropped all his shit of course and turns out he was a duper. My boyfriend picked it all up and then the guy started messaging him about wanting his shit back. 
---
I just started playing SWG a few weeks ago and it has become my all time favorite mmo
---
Then wait until the next single player fallout because that is not, never has been, and never will be the intention of 76.
---
If you can find a player willing to part with it there is a quest that gives a level 0 prototype hazmat suit.
---
I have occasionally seen them get vendored, I snatch them up when I do. They sell well.
---
Well... I’m not sure how to break the news to you, since I’m just a stranger on the internet, and this really should have been explained to you by your parents when you were little, but I’ll do my best: 
---
**People are different from each other, and it’s possible for other people to be entertained by things that are not the same as what entertains you**. I know it’s a hard concept to grasp if exposed to it late in life, but once you internalize it, a lot of things that previously seemed strange will become clear. 
---
I was playing solo and just recently deleted the game from my hard drive to make room for Fallout 4... Which was deleted to make room for Fallout 76. I’m a huge fan of exploring in the series, but was getting bored quickly with FO76, my last few logins being 15min or so at a time.
---
 The many bugs/issues that the game has are no big deal to me. I know that sooner or later Bethesda will address major problems in some capacity. The thing I couldn’t get over is the lack of human NPCs. None of my friends are into the series and in past titles, interactions with NPCs were a driving factor in my immersion into the games. Reading terminals for glimpses of story only leaves me wondering what these characters were like. 
---
If you’re cool with the known issues and don’t mind a rather lonely solo-play, then go for it. If not, you may want to hold off, but keep an eye out and fingers crossed for update announcements. 
---
You are just in a traffic zone. I had the same experience myself, then I moved and now no sb problem. Just other mobs. 
---
Anyone that uses PA? Just because it's 50% or lower doesn't make it useless... You know PA now picks the lowest Fusion Core from your inventory to use when your current one runs out? Someone (me) would be glad to use hem up. I'd buy them from you. 
---
This kinda of ruined my day because I don't play on PC. 
---
Here's how it would go down I would get jacked up on some Fury eat some glowing meat steak I have the twisted muscles mutation and a Lvl 50 instigating sledge hammer. They probably don't have pacifist mode on so I would offer up a trade emote and as they walked up to me I would say "war-hammers sends there wasteland love" then drop them exit my power armor and feast on there corpse. That's what I call Appalachian Justice.
---
This. The penalties and bounty system needs to be reworked to actually mean something.  If someone wants to be a raider, that's as BGS seems to have intended. But, there should be **actual consequences** for when they're taken to task by us good guys.
---
Maybe you should be playing FO4 then...
---
It's definitely just a marketing gimmick to get us to spend our fake electronic currency, but there are a few items that are on sale that I actually want.
---
Ahh there’s the hang up.  
---
I play on Xbox.   
---
So can you screenshot something on pc that isn’t from the game and have that added to your one-game photo album?
---
Voice to Text and Text to voice with out any stupid interface other than normal chat to be compliant with the  Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act 2010, Bethesda just barely made it under the waivers which expired on Dec 31st 2018. [https://igda-gasig.org/additional-information/cvaa/](https://igda-gasig.org/additional-information/cvaa/)
---
all it takes is one of y'all to raise a complaint with the FCC to get the ball rolling, you could even argue that the game has " receive substantial updates after " the expiration date considering there is a patch almost every other week.
---
Microsoft has even gone so far as to provide voice to text and text to voice capabilities on xbox so this is technically not out side of adding for that platform.

Here is the complaint form one of you that have an issue with the lack of communication accessiblity could go and file your said complaint against Bethesda : [https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/filing-informal-complaint](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/filing-informal-complaint)
---
I personally do not have any issue with the lack of an implementation that ensures fallout 76 is in compliance with the CVAA, so therefore i have no complaint, but any of you players that find challenges in communicating with other players should know that at least in the US there is a law that requires companies at least try to fix it or come up with some big bullshit reason like "it would cost to much for us", which for the purpose of at least xbox is 100% bullshit considering Microsoft has already made the tools available to the developers: [https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/ease-of-access/use-game-chat-transcription](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/ease-of-access/use-game-chat-transcription)

Played for over 170 hours and luckily i got attacked only a couple of times. Last time, a couple of days ago, I was in the whitespring resort trying to figure out what to sell and what to scrap when i saw a level 140+ killing a level 110.  I  was thinking what an odd place to start a pvp fight when the 140 started attacking me (level 60 at the time)  and doing a fair bit of damage even if I am in pacifist mode.  Seriously, whats the fun / honour in attacking a player who is off guard and not even half your level? I did not want to waste my energy on scumbags like that and logged out.  Would prefer not have to  leave the server but it's the only option I had.
---
Caps are worthless? How are people making their caps? I got to level 80 and never felt like I had enough caps. I'd make runs to each vendor to clear them out, and still wouldn't have enough.
---
Bethesda is changing pacifist mode. Idk if someone already said it because of how many comments there are but yeah. 
---
In this week alone I've had my camp damaged three times by low level characters. They blow up my door, I guess they can't pick the lock. When I get back to repair , I'll see the little folk all red and wanted , so I shoot them for breaking my stuff. Then I'm called the griefer. Lol. You blow my stuff up , I blow you up. Otherwise I'll leave you in peace. But almost every day while I'm out helping friends with quests , someone decides they want to mess with my stuff then give me caps.
---
Well, there are a few ways of balancing this, I think. 
---
Make robots with built-in lasers pretty weak, and make enemies using handheld laser weapons pretty scarce. That way you won't be surrounded by them and insta-melted. 
---
Also, give us more ways of improving our energy resistance - or, actually, we already have some ways besides leather armour. There are aid items that temporarily raise resistances, for example. They would suddenly be a lot more useful. 
---
By doing some or all of these things, they could safely buff laser weapons without making them completely overpowered. I don't need them to be *more* powerful than the corresponding ballistic weapons, just to be a reasonable alternative. 
---
Except for the fact that Bethesda is changing it so if you’re in pacifist mode no one can destroy your camp :) 
---
Air was also advertised to have checks to keep it so that people who really didn’t want pvp could have a way of not participating and those that kept insisting got punished. So yes, Bethesda also was trying to appeal to us players who hated pvp. Probably because there is a large chunk of is playing their games as they are known for single player and people who don’t like pvp also tend to prefer single player games. 
---
The PvP can be mitigated by 1) making sure the require base mats for running the processor **aren’t** available at the workshop [requiring either multiple WSs or a stockpile of mats] &amp; 2) by making it a fairly defensible/larger build budget [also a further mats sink]
---
There are always people that just want a single player option that are going to bitch about any form of PvP whatsoever; there are no multiplayer suggestions that will ever stop that.  
---
I personally encountered my first major PvP WS theft on day 4 of the game’s release (was left alone for the duration of the beta), and all that did for me, instead of making me angry &amp; embittered, it made me go, “Hey, *this* is why this is multiplayer...”, and I sought out a team. Now if I get someone attempting to steal a WS, they have to work for it. 
---
Yep, that's the assaultron head...  Blew through about 1600 fusion cells the first trigger pull. 
---
Now they're scrapped asap.
---
Bethesda is changing it though so you can chill :) 
---
there's actually a button in the player-to-player trade window that lets you respond to sell suggestions other players make, e.g "price too high" and "not interested". havent seen it anywhere for some reason
---
it might not exist on consoles, i've only used it on PC
---
Agree..!  BGS needs to up their trading game as the player trading, people doing their own inventive things (medical centres, quiz nights,
---
CAMP designs etc.) and the various subreddits are the things that are keeping the game alive for now...
---
It seems to be all location based. My previous base was in the same spot outside of Harper's Ferry for months and I never had any beast problems
---
Bethesda is changing it :) 
---
Well that is just stupid if they do this....but we shall see
---
If they even gave a specific day for pictures/video. 
---
People post to imgur anyway, why not give 1 day of the week for them?
---
Well that is just stupid if they do this, but we shall see
---
I wish more people would party up for these types of events. Being in a party doesn't lessen the XP you get and you'll get 100% of the loot as long as someone in the party tagged the monster. Doesn't matter if you hit it or not.
---
That was some of the first styles I built and totally agree with that. My thought goes back to some of my Minecraft exploring, I'd always take a Bed, Stove, Chest and would pop up a small little camp in places while I farmed for stuff. I've been in some small out of the way places, headed towards a mission in Fallout and thought, how cool would it be to just pop down here for a bit an take care of some stuff. Like in Red Dead Redemption 2, you build a camp and you always go back to the main camp later. I'm not the FIRST person to think of THIS at all.  8-) 
---
missions? like seriously i got to level 60 something doing the quests in the games. 
---
On PS4, the window with those options comes up when you reject the offer.
---
I logged 500+ hours and probably 98% of that has been solo play and have had a blast.  Something to keep in mind with scavenging is that inventory management is very important in this game.  Stash space is limited, so you can't necessarily horde all the junk you come across, which takes some adjustment for some people, I think.
---
Griefing is a tough call.  If you have pacifist mode on, it keeps you from accidentally initiating PvP by shooting another player.  However, it *does not* remove their ability to destroy your camp, etc.  I play on Xbox and in all my hours can count the number of times I've been griefed on one hand.  However, I started playing at launch while people were still exploring the world. By the time people got bored enough to start griefing others, I believe my level was high enough to deter it.  Wolves, for the most part, don't hunt other wolves; they hunt sheep.  I do see topics posted here about players who have been griefed, however I see *more* about how great the community is.
---
I saw him on day one just outside of flatwoods - now months later i have never seen him again...
---
I'm guessing you must have a specific height of the thing you put it on to work with the "hacking" animation so it would have to include the table or handle that in some way.
---
I’m a lawyer dipshit.
---
If you really like scavenging and exploring solo, you will get your money's worth out of the game.
---
Will you get griefed?  If you play long enough, sure, someone at some point will be a prick.  The same thing goes for interacting with humans in any format.  
---
Pacifist (not "passive") Mode makes it so that (1) you cannot harm others and (2) they can only harm you a tiny bit at a time.  Someone could use their most powerful weapon on you and it'd be like slapping you.  Eventually you can be slapped to death, but they usually get bored before long if you don't attack back.
---
If it won't hurt your budget, buy it.  
---
100% stacks, we had a team of 4 last night with it, the damage was so minimal, alone is almost unbearable. Them col/Maj Gutsy's mate, they're NASTY Solo W/Empath.
---
They already replied to a post 2 days ago lol they are changing it. And it’s not stupid at all. If I don’t want to kill anyone, then I certainly don’t wanna be killed. Plain and simple. 
---
agreed...though they need an auto filter to delete anything relating to chuck norris...
---
I sure hope so that isn't abused by wanted players.
---
yeah there should be a combination of perks that allows *any* of the weapons to be viable, e.g. against the SBQ.
---
Im sure you won’t be able to turn it on if your wanted. That sounds ridiculous. 
---
GTA’s passive mode is a joke. It’s basically if you have thus on you can only do 10 percent of the game (driving and shopping). You can’t even hurt npcs in passive mode and that really ruins it (especially as npcs can hurt you). 
---
Rockstar actually recently did some decent anti griefing measures in red dead (which interestingly enough they won’t put in gta... but gta is their real money maker where as from what I’ve seen they really need to convince people to play red dead online). 
---
Don't half go to the server?
---
Unpopular opinion: the game is bad and you should play new vegas instead.
---
Yes. The intent is all that matters. 
---
I actually don't think any kids should be playing any games without guidance and supervision, fwiw. 
---
Ladders are hard because Bethesda hasn't taken the off mesh link tutorial in unity. which is funny because indie game devs have been working with ladders for the last 7 years. 
---
Yeah, sure don't want to tie up prime real estate and I'm not sure if this should really take up space at all and the places I'm thinking about are out in the middle of nowhere. I'd even say it would be cool if you could drop this near a friends camp, like parking an RV in the driveway. My though is this only takes up two squares max and limited what you can bring. NO BIG bed. Sleeping Bags/Cots, One Bench, One Cooking. That's all I was thinking at the time.
---
Basically its asking you to kill different cyptids, and it asks you to both "Kill a flatwoods monster" and "Kill an alien"
---
The reason it is stupid is as follows:
---
Trap Grahm + MooMoo and then charge extortionate amounts for people to come visit him.
---
Also when letting people visit my CAMP, I will change the door to a wall and then permanently trap any overencumbered players for ever Unless they pay extortionate amounts of caps to get out.
---
I lose my sound every time I take my main to Harper's.  Strange thing is I dont think my others lose sound.  Unless it's my power armor.
---
Good to know.  It's just weird as attacks for me are common now but were not before.   Oh well, packing up and moving soon anyway.
---
I love the fo76 community, its like everyones a pal and everyone likes fallout. And, I think the survival mode thats coming out will make pvp more open so maybe there can be more shenanigans 😂
---
Explain to me how one kills another player with slap damage without that player being negligent in their own defense, and by that I mean staying unarmored, at low health, and ignoring the slaps?   In all my experiences slap damage has been so minimal my healthbar barely registers the hits and I would have to had to be a extremely low health with no stimpaks/food/etc and taken no defensive action for it to have killed me. Please explain.
---
Yeah. It's always been weird that ladders equal loading zones in Fallout and TES.
---
Aluminum deposits
---
I do PvP actually, and I don't personally think I need the notification. However, I've seen enough posts complaining about it that I thought it might be something Bethesda could implement that would help those folks out.
---
WTF does scrapper even do? Give me a little more steel and wood? I couldn’t really tell a difference when it was on vs off. 
---
If you think that pisses you off imagine wanting to repair your lvl 50 armor but you can't because it requires ballistic fiber that only comes from 2 different sources, so instead you craft the lvl 40 because it doesn't require ballistic fiber, BUT when you go to repair that it requires ballistic fiber. WHY DO I NEED BALLISTIC FIBER TO REPAIR SOMETHING THAT DOESNT NEED BALLISTIC FIBER TO BE CREATED? BETHESDA, EXPLAIN!
---
A tip for taking down cargobots: Aim for the booster rockets. Taking out 2 diagonal from each other pretty much holds it in place and does more damage to the cargobot. 
---
This is one of the main reasons I stopped playing. Can't stand the asshole griefers.
---
The increasing price cost &amp; usual inability to place already exist blueprints makes constant movement of you C.A.M.P. extremely onerous, especially in the late game. 
---
Something like this would be a nice compromise (set cost, temporary to server, limit on what is in it, the time limit), without having to make some major changes to the C.A.M.P. system (which already needs to be fixed to work as *intended*). 
---
Will this just be for players to buy misc stuff like ammo, or to sell to other players? 
---
It's functional art. 
---
Or we could just have someone make a mod to add our own songs...
---
*oh, wait*
---
Thx dude
---
The server doesnt track those objects because they exist on the map that is already cached to the disk of what ever platform you are playing the game on. 
---
Things that dont exist when you aren't/can't connect to the server are what would slow down the server. if i had to guess the number one cause would be all the meat piles everyone doesnt loot. Each one of those is a container that holds X number of items for Y number of players that can loot it. 
---
I cant tell you how many times i killed a ghoul at white springs only to have its corpse pile not despawn. that tells me some one is tagging and running off or they have a camp with turrets setup OR the server thinks some one else has loot rights... 
---
Pvp servers are coming but I def will still be heading into regular servers for pvp action as well. Bethesda better not turn this game into a pity party for the cry babies
---
Lol, I am experiencing deja vu.
---
Ha!  I never pvp so I have no idea how it would work.
---
Their will still be ways to kill....we will find them
---
Maybe thats what it was, I do have a TSE and shot it with that..I dont think being called names and being yelled at was called for though. I dont take the game that seriously...
---
By taking a workshop you consent to pvp.  If you want pacifist mode to exclude you from pvp then it should exclude you from taking workshops as well.
---
Definitely on the lucky side here: several hundred hours (I’m actually terrified to look up the actual amount) and no encounters with griefers. I wonder if being on PS4 has something to do with that. 
---
people are too cheap to have more than one game 
---
They lose half and it messes with their fast travel for a bit too. It's not like you explain  
---
Most people are just bitches on here who want to build camps like this is minecraft.
---
I have had my camp in the same place not in a high traffic area or near any roads and yet at least once a day I get Ghouls or scorched attacking from the same place. I like my spot too much to move so one well placed missile turret solved that problem. 
---
Well, whatever, I still hate them. I was hoping for a legit reason to get rid of them, but I’m happy with them going away just for the fact that they are lame.
---
Not like he was letting any of us get a shot in on the others, him and his buddy were blowing through on their own. There were 6 or so of us there and they could care less if any of us got anything out of it. So why should I care about them? That wasnt my point going into it, I was just doing my own thing, I didnt really think about it until it was over. I dont really care what others do in their game, I think someone else posted this. To each their own I say as long as it isnt impacting others!
---
&gt; **power armor breaks too slow** 
---
wtf r u drinking
---
Same here. They are also the last two things I do before logging off for the night; that way I start my next session raring to go :)
---
Only if they claim a workshop or they never activate pacifist mode :) that’s your only options. 
---
I have seen this guy around a couple times messing with people.   i ran into him tonight.   was taking workshops to get my "20 Workshops" 80 Atoms achievement and he came by and 3 shotted me with the powerfist.     second time he came by i managed to land 2 shots on him and got him down to 75% health about before i got fisted again. 
---
Please explain how he took all of your stuff. Where you in passive? Did you hit him? Did you own a workshop? 
---
Now you made me wonder how much i've thrown away just to increase space.
---
Agreed, but again they were not letting us do the same on the ones they were hitting. Was hardly a two way street...Again I didnt set out to kill it outright. I was an asshole, yet he and his buddy could give a crap less about the other 4 of us getting hits on the other legendaries. So yeah Karma is a bitch I guess....
---
But then they can be reported and banned. That changes everything.
---
It really depends on the spot.  Some spots tend to get more enemy attacks than others, as a result of foot traffic from other players spawning nearby enemies.  But I think having your food on the outside increases this chance of the game randomly spawning enemies *just* to attack your CAMP.  I used to get periodic attacks from enemies until I moved my Corn inside my house.  For as long as I had that particular house, I was never attacked by enemies.  But when I redesigned it a couple days ago, and had the Corn on the outside, the attacks started again.  I've since totally surrounded my Corn with a fence and other obstacles, which makes it pretty obnoxious for even me to collect, and I haven't seen anything sense.
---
Me too!
---
Battlefront reddit has “sithpost saturdays”, the one day a week where shitposting and memes are allowed.  
---
This sub could maybe use something like that
---
I have always resorted to smart use of crouching...and chameleon armor if you can  get it.  It sucks but it works.  I just enjoy the game at a slower pace than others.  :-)  When doing this I have only been bothered ONCE..and ironically I was forced out of crouch mode to do a quest.
---
Exactly this ^.
---
.The world is a karmic playground. Whatever you do to others will come back to you one way or another. 
---
Try sending them a message. 
---
Well the first two, you switch servers. Either that’s person is being an ass or you are, I’d just leave the server. Simple. 
---
To the next thing you said sure, if you don’t have pacifist mode on. But since they are changing it, I don’t want my stuff destroyed at all. So no. 
---
Last thing you said is a complete no. That’s why workshops are a thing. Your camp is your safe haven (for some) 
---
I have not experienced it. Does regeneration work during slap damage, or are you considered in combat for that mod/mutation?
---
I think there's something on your map too when you're wanted.
---
As far as the notification thing, I was thinking in particular of moments like your team member engaged someone in PvP or someone has attempted to take your workshop while their teammate has fast traveled to your location to surprise attack you. 
---
There is one in the trailer on the roof of the Poseidon plant next to Charleston. If it isn't there someone already grabbed it, just try a different server. 
---
As others have said, the one at the top of Poseidon is probably the easiest to get. There's ramp/fire escape type walkways on the western end of the plant (outside, not inside), patrolled by a few scorched. Head up there and there's a small structure, kind of like a camper office. There's a perfect condition suit that spawns inside. I got it at level 5 and I've yet to use it in 30 levels! Someday, someday, . . .
---
yeah, that is helpful, but the point is we shouldn't have to find a new server.  pacifist should be reworked so you deal no damage *and* you take no damage
---
The world has a lot of assholes in it. It has far more good people, but we tend not to notice them as much. We see the assholes and the angels, and forget the rest are there.
---
There is no reason why you can't collect 1400 caps per day.  Kill low level enemies and take their weapons to sell and/or scrap.  Pick up junk as you find it and sell or scrap it.  Make your own ammo at tinker's workbenches.
---
Abraxo cleaner and cloth make gunpowder.  Pencils, tin cans, toy blocks, cans of paint and almost all toys contain lead.  Steel is everywhere.  There are the ingredients for your ammo.  You can mine lead ore in the Lucky Hole mine.  You can scoop up acid from the three pit at Hemlock Holes.  (If someone has placed an extractor, you can scoop up acid from next to it without stealing from the workshop owner.)
---
If you run pacifist, don't take workshops and don't have reactive plates or plague walker, it's pretty hard to be hurt by griefers.  The most they can do is damage your camp.  If you are attacked you have plenty of time to run away or to hop servers.  If you see them attacking your camp, hop servers.  
---
there are solutions, but they are workarounds, pacifist should deal no damage *and* take no damage
---
Guys just immediately server hop when situation like this arises.
---
I was wondering the same thing. I had to plant razorgrain so I could repair my poor dead brahmin every time my base is attacked. I gave up on my turrets as they hardly ever fired at anything.
---
I picked up a level 1 and subsequently a level 50 prototype hazmat suit. Both had the same rad protection stats but the level 50 had higher condition value
---
&gt;No comments for an hour then 6 in 5 minutes.
---
Or, perhaps, it is morning and more time zones are becoming active.
---
I like to blow up most cars I see now for fun. Though I try not to do it when players are near. I especially blow them up at white springs as it draws all the ghouls out of the buildings.
---
That's because you're new and think the game has meaningful content.
---
I though about that but the only person that was showing up on the map was my RL friend which I was grouped with at the time.  Additionally, it isnt just that I could not find the bag, even after ensuring that it was an active quest it would not show up on the compass.  So I could not find which direction it was in, when I was near it.  (Yes, I know that it kinda disappears when you are standing on or very near the location.)
---
Unless you take a workshop... agreed.
---
I have around 2 dozen, I save them up and then plow through, that I will try. But really,   When it comes down to it, BOS over polymer only adds like 7% to your stats iirc.* So the real tragedy is not having the cool look. 
---
* I’ve looked up the supposed stats for what each armor’s base and subsequent mods should be, they’re all similar but I’m not sure which is correct. For example the most common numbers I found showed that Polymer added 20 points to DR and ER on the chest while BOS adds 25 to DR and ER on the chest’s base 61 (for heavy combat armor). 81 is 7% more than 76. 
---
1000 caps?  So Player A shoots Player B to become wanted, then Player C kills Player A to earn 1000 caps.  Player A respawns and collects 500 caps from Player C as their share of the deal.
---
Player B still complains about the inconvenience to their game.
---
You don’t see the problem with your idea?
---
Yes, he does. 
---
the literal second you take a workshop you are consenting to PvP, doesn't matter where you are on the map, that is how workshops work.
---
I agree that the CAMP issue is a big one.  My solution is to avoid building a complex CAMP for now until this griefing problem gets fixed.   I just have a single platform with workbenches on it.   Nothing else.  I will revisit CAMP building later on.
---
Good for you, I am a businessmen, and I have exhausted all the effort I am willing to on this matter. I was just trying to be nice and do a little improptu investigation. If the community is going to shit on it, whatever, I am just gonna do like normal, and pay my nephew or some Asian farmer to get me the items I want. Have a nice day.
---
I don't have any problem with people who want to do that, it's just a different way to play the game. Meanwhile, I'll be taking as many workshops as I can in hopes someone tries to come along and contest.
---
it depends on the process used for boiling, as the type of boiling being done has a 50% loss rate, making me think your boiling the dirty water off, and collecting the steam, which is pure water
---
It’s normally level 10 to boot with a 1000 rad resist. 
---
Even the legendaries do it. I didn't have the problem in FO4 on PS4. I won't pick it up unless it a legendary to put away for our new vendor. 
---
solution: when a company sells an online game don't buy it if you wanted to play a single player game
---
Because they have already replied to a post like this 2 days ago. And it wasn’t no “soft” post either. 
---
right, you just shouldn't be allowed to be in pacifist to take a workshop, it's stupid you can take a workshop in pacifist, you literally have to consent to PvP to take one...
---
It is getting reworked. Bethesda already made this statement on Reddit 2 days ago.. 
---
Hmm...as I recall it, the game was pitched as a 'lets rebuild the wasteland together'  game ( i.e. - co-op )....NOT PvP.   Seems like PvP was added as an afterthought.
---
Yep shoot the engines not the body....
---
* My brotherhood character must remove all mutations ASAP. Only US Government/Brotherhood approved combat drugs. No alcohol. The roleplay on this character is he is a chaplain thus he must give PVP opponents an option to surrender/disengage.
---
* My gunslinger is limited to four pistols, one melee weapon, and only 2 ammo types. No chems, but will drink like a fish. Will shoot you in the back in PVP.
---
* My mutant/melee character can only use weapons and mutations that support a "Kung-Fu Hero" playstyle. Only eats dog food or vegetables from his garden. No chems or alcohol. Must always wear goggles or sunglasses and a hat since he is an albino.
---
* My sniper will only wear outfits that are "Victorian/Edwardian-ish" but if engaged in PVP will switch to "Work clothes". Must act as slutty as possible since she is a whore, literally and figuratively. Must use every chem she finds the moment he finds it.
---
Those BF brawl vids are very telling. Only two-legged animals behave like that. 
---
Oh, sorry, I never knew! Thanks!
---
item 1+2 - People don't want to be 'forced' to server hop and that is the only way out if overencumbered
---
Item 3 - If it is free to repair the damage when a vault dweller destroys your base = items 1 and 2 are resolved and CAMP greifing becomes pointless.
---
Item 4 - I am referring to if supermutants etc. came to destroy your CAMP which is totally possible in this game. Not sure why these events don't already take place. If you want to keep your CAMP/Workshop you will have to go back and defend it at some point.
---
If someone hits me at camp I jump server, no big deal. I get a lot more thumbs up than sneak attacks in this game than I do in red dead..you should not play that game!
---
This I’ve encountered rattles of, but in my 400 (Current Levels: 91/39/24/18/14) hours i’ve only been outnumbered and robbed of a workshop one time, and though they did claim it from me once i got every resource set up(Mega RR)- i did attack first. This was also before the ‘Workshop Claim Buff/Nerf’ depending on how you look at it, came into play. In this particular situation I had to get TO the red workshop bench to re-claim, but 3 on 1 pvp was a bit much on me, i think that was my level 39 @ around 30-35 against a few 40’s. If i were able to have done things with the way it is now i’d have been able to claim from a corner and maaybe pick them off 1by1 but you know, that one seemed unwinnable, with respawns and all. Didnt feel like a raider raid it felt like perhaps an unexpected boss fight like right after making it through the story to the top of the mire there.
---
good, link?  I must'v missed it...  
---
You can sell them for 1 cap apiece to any vendor.
---
That's fair, I didn't know they were just mowing down legendary enemies themselves and not sharing the loot. 
---
Either way, if you are killing the legendary enemies at events as fast as you can so nobody else can tag and get the potential loot, you're a jerk. If you are doing it because they are intentionally doing it to you, I can let that slide.
---
Thank you! I’be wondered why it takes so long, is so hard, to get that little crap drone out of the sky. I mean I fly drones and they fall out of the sky all the time without anyone shooting at them!
---
Seriously. My first attempt, with a suppressed combat rifle was just not enough range, I was missing half the time and would have to fast travel to catch up to the thing. That time I finally brought it down with a hunting rifle, after a painfully long amount of time. 
---
I’m playing it as a large, NPC-less FO4 DLC, and it works fine as such. It has the same “Explore, Collect, Build, Shoot Mutants” gameplay loops as FO4, so it scratches the same itch. 
---
If you’re looking for a deep main quest narrative; however, it may not satisfy in that regard. 
---
It's not a game for kids in other words.
---
Drug use is rampant (as well as opiate abuse as med-x is morphine, it was only renamed to med-x so the original game could be sold in Australia)
---
The levels of blood and gore can, at times, be pretty darn excessive
---
Quite a few moments of blatantly portraying racism towards ghouls as being something fairly common/not seen as bad by most of the populace (could be seen as an homage to segregation in the 60s, but it's still a thing young children aren't really mentally or emotionally equipped to deal with or understand)
---
Clear acts of genocide (see the Tracking Unknowns quest, or the whole synth issue in 4, hell the enclave in 3 did the same thing too by essentially trying to poison the water supply)
---
It’s each player’s responsibility to tag a mob if they want the loot.  Nobody is obligated to wait for another player to do so, however.
---
Sure they could do that until one of them loses all their caps. Or until a better player comes and takes their caps. Not a perfect system but what I want to say is that their needs to be a higher risk for destroying or griefing a player who isn't trying to pvp. 
---
Why report them? Its not like they broke any rules
---
While you are letting the devs are aware of it, how about giving us the ability to bulk them as well.
---
If people are doing something out of your control like keeping a vendor to them selfs or you eat trapped in someone’s home then why no leave the server. No saying it’s their fault because it obviously isn’t. It’s yours or the person that’s doing it. 
---
And when is it free when someone destroys your camp?? I’ve had to repair my stuff at a cost coming from 2 greifers. Don’t know if you have had your base attacked before but you’re wrong. And I shouldn’t have to move for it to be repaired. That’s ridiculous. 
---
And yes enemies show up at your camp but why make it an event? I’ve heard of some people finding the perfect camp spot where no enemies spawn... 
---
Camp and workshops are different things.......... 
---
Maybe I’ve never rejected an offer. I don’t remember how we’ve left. I’m on XB1. I don’t recall anything like this but I could have missed it.
---
If everyone could post screenshots anytime they wanted anything important or major improvements to the game would be harder to find. This reddit being so proacgive is a big reason why the game is trending the right way
---
LA has pretty horrible durability. My Intelligence is only 7, I think Intelligence affects durability and repair but Im unsure to what extent.
---
Any chance you can clarify where in the trainyard you found the plans? Trying to test out some theories.
---
Props, at level 38. I didn’t even attempt the enclave story line until level 50. I didn’t even think you could do the quest until lvl 50. But yeah, always bring at least two nuclear keycards. I think everyone I know, including me has once punched in the wrong code.  
---
Killing any mob before others get a shot in is by no means a jerk move.  
---
If you're in Uranium fever you are essentially joining a team.  Teammates help each other.  They stimpack each other and they share legendaries.
---
It's not mandatory, but it's polite practice.
---
Where’s the link?
---
If your on PC I could maybe help you find one, I know a few places or I maybe even have one to give you.
---
Yes, of course that’s possible, but an in-trade negotiation would be much more helpful and makes more sense. Going back and forth by message is messy.
---
Killing a mob without letting others hit it is the problem of other players.  Shoot faster.  
---
I just saw it earlier! I can’t find it now.. if I can find it I’ll link you it! 
---
We are getting screwed on screws? They are tight it's true but it's not insurmountable:
---
* The two radio dish buildings (National Observatory I think). Run the west one first, waddle down to the east one, run it, there is a bench in the basement.
---
* There is a pickup and a horse trailer on the road north of Watoga with three Buttercups.
---
* Silva Homestead has a Buttercup and a goodly number of toys.
---
* Willy's Water Wonderland has toys in most of the carnival booths.
---
This will get you 20-30 screws.
---
There is also the building where you get the Excavator power armor, DMV and I hear about Sugar Grove but I don't go there.
---
They can do it even if you are passive, i meat one of this new type grifers last night, the type that waits for you after doing a successful SBQ fight, they are after your flux.
---
Walked up to me at the watoga station and started swinging his sledge, he was a lv200++, 3-4 blows and my health was down to about 50%, stimed up and could probably have stimed up for 1 hour, but he gave up and walked away.
---
Have good weapons and PA / Normal armor, but didn't want to risk my flux and be sure, he hadn't engaged me if he diden't have a "Ace" up his slews, probably wearing full assassin armor.
---
We should have a way of sending out a msg to everyone on our friends list to deal with players like this, but next time i will do the same as the OP, put out a bounty on him :)
---
lol weak
---
I saw it earlier today. I’ll have to find it again. I’ll link it. 
---
The idea is good but the backronym is pretty bad.
---
Instead of using a pylon switch can you use a pressure floor switch? That way it will open when you step on it and close when you step off of the switch to the outside?
---
I thought it required alot of repairing. I guess I should start on handmade then :(
---
I agree.
---
The players who fancy being Raiders forget one key thing: most Raiders end up with a bullet in their head.
---
If they are raiding with total impunity, and brag that its far more profitable than anything else, that suggests to me that there isn't nearly enough risk in what they do.  They apparently do not fear the broken builds that make the rest of us skeptical to engage, likely because they are running one themselves and know they are practically invulnerable to anyone who doesn't have a specific counter to it.
---
Another reason normal people don't engage is that we know these "Raiders" quit the moment they get their butts kicked.  And when they do this, they deny you the bounty and can simply hop to another server and continue their charade.  There needs to be some kind of punishment for that.
---
I hope weapons will be changed to last as long as PA. Why the hell world you want PA to degrade faster?! This is the most unfun mechanic in the game, by your own admission when you describe your guns... 
---
 While you are letting the devs are aware of it, how about giving us the ability to bulk them as well. 
---
just wait for player vending.  i am already stockpiling stuff.
---
I'm not saying any mob, I am saying **legendary at an event with other people**, and it is a jerk move 100%
---
When they implement the player vending machines, I hope they build in something like this. I set a price I want, and a minimum price I’m willing to accept. That way I can sell more stuff. If the other player doesn’t like my price, they can counter offer, and if it’s at or above my minimum then they can still buy it. If a person wants to make their selling price and minimum acceptable price the same, then they can.
---
Except the in-game lore says vault 76 was a "control vault" where they did not do any experiments.
---
I have an alt that I role play heavily. He’s based off Dog, the Bounty Hunter. He uses syringers (since Dog normally carries a pepperball gun), but if that fails he switches to a hunting rifle of .44 revolver. Being a former alcoholic, he never drinks, but he does dabble in the occasional drug if he’s feeling down. He lost his faith after the bombs fell, so was an atheist while he was in the vault, but upon leaving, he found a shrine to the Mothman and worships at it every chance he gets. He only cooks his own food, so is forced to hunt/gather whenever he is out and about. Any other food or weapons he finds either gets sold or broken down for scrap. 
---
Hopefully the PVE and PVP servers will make a big difference by keeping the hardcore players and casual players apart from each other. I think the main problem is that everyone has completed all the missions and PVP is the only thing left to do for now as a challenge. 
---
Lots of weapons can 1 shot all enemies except scorchbeasts, so there is no challenge anymore. 
---
And just to confirm, I only engage in bounty hunting, I do not greif :)
---
I was in pacifist, no workshop.  I had 80% radiation because I dont want to  use radaway till I have starched Genes.  So I was low health.  I was facing a ghoul in the corner killing him and this fool slaps my back with a DC gauntlet and kills me.   Took my huge bag of junk that I had because I was farming ws for a while at that point.  
---
I completely agree with you. My idea was just a bandaid until they come up with a permanent solution. 
---
imo LA is good for stealth when u can pull off a one or two shot kill. Handmade is better when you’re more operative. 
---
If you have a legendary LA then my suggestion is to hold on to it and figure out how u can mitigate repairs because its an excellent rifle!
---
I most definitely disagree.  I’ll help others out, but it’s not my responsibility to wait for them to get a shot in.  Either they do or they don’t; that’s their problem.
---
Yeah I love the pvp aspect and it definitely seems like people are getting more hostile. 
---
I run security for my friends who operate shops. For some reason shops attract both good and bad attention. Makes from some fun fights and decent pay
---
I found that the existence of a custom ini file causes this even if there is nothing in it.  I removed that file and the paints behaved as expected.  Created a new blank file and the problem returned.  So I am running without a custom ini.
---
How often do you repair yours? I have never repaired my X-01 which I've had since lvl 50, (lvl 91 now) I didn't always use all of it, but I've had the torso on for most of that time and it's still above 100%
---
Is there even a need to equip the Power Patcher perk other than for the reduced repair cost for the rare times we repair?
---
Also, did you not read about the repair cost reduction suggestion for PA to go along with faster breaking?
---
Is this also on xbox where you're seeing this?
---
He probably means raider power armor. You get a set from Rose's quest line and can buy it from the vendor in the ski resort (possibly other raider vendors too but I don't know for sure). It can also be found all over the savage divide.
---
It could even warn you that if you take the workshop, pacifist mode is turned off.
---
Yes. I replied to another use above about this. With vending there needs to be a method to sell stuff below your advertised price that way you can sell more stuff if you have a price in mind but are willing to accept less to get rid of it.
---
Last couple of nights? What are the chances you get put on the same server two or three nights in a row? Even server hopping you have a pretty low probability of finding the same person again. 
---
thanks, I typed pacifist into the search function and found no post that Bethesda has responded to in the last few days
---
The weapon degradation is likely bugged or simply calculated wrongly, (Mmy Gatling Gun lasts for about 1700 rounds, used to last 2500 rounds pre Patch 6 with the very same build and Gunsmith 5.)
---
I'm glad the power armor breaks pretty slow with Power Patcher 3 and when repaired to 200%. Who wants to farm for Black Titanium/Ultracite every hour? I don't.
---
I don't get why there's slap damage at all. It would be better to have the first hit highlight the attacker for no damage, and you need to attack back to initiate pvp. Damage shouldn't happen until the fight begins.
---
Once you've bought all the plans you want, the only thing left to spend caps on at end game is fast travel.
---
This is what I'm looking for
---
Level really doesn't dictate much. I got attacked on my level 7 character by a level 85. Instead of being upset, I liquefied him with a plasma grenade and took a picture with his junk pile and green goo body. It was amazing.
---
ah.. that makes much more sense.. I've run into that a lot. 
---
Well hopefully this makes it more official for you 
---
use the block feature, no need for these  histrionics. 
---
curious, do you know what the limit for upgrading is? Seems to be 45 so far. 
---
If you're on PC, [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/126) does what you want. :)
---
I fall for this ruse 100% of the time.
---
if you are on ps4, I played with a deadpelican and danielocean and moonpie, we had some good times, but then my nephew decided he wants to play fo76 and hasnt given it back since, he is now higher level then i was when i lent it to him heheh
---
I think it is going to be an option to enter the prestige system, so you can keep you 100s of levels if you want.
---
I'll be on XB1. Yeah, I just like exploring, scavenging and building. Thanks.
---
I completely agree with you there. I really want to get deep into FO76, but how completely imbalanced the pvp is, makes me just want to give up and give Fallout 4 a try instead. 
---
Sadly I dumped them in a train station the other day.  
---
I'm not so fussed story wise. I have plenty of Bethesda titles for that. 
---
Every 20 hours, not 24.
---
The road map said theres a new main story.
---
Thanks! That cleared some up for me.
---
There are several at the emmet waste disposal, and I think they scale with you. I got a level 20 there when I was a level 20 but found a level 50 when I was level 50
---
This sounds fine to me.
---
&gt; Bethesda, this is bullshit.  
---
They don't give a single shit about this game, they thought they were gonna start raking in PUBG money from the Atom Shop.  All they care about is selling hats.
---
There's a mod called "Save my loadout" on Nexus (if you are PC) that does something like this.
---
That's cool. Thanks!
---
Ammosmith isn't available until level 34. And Super Duper isn't available until level 50. OP didn't say their level, but I'm suspecting they aren't at either of these levels.
---
That said, it's best for OP to adopt a good melee weapon for certain types of encounters and a less ammo intensive weapon. Also, probably staying away from the ammo workshop might be good for now. 
---
This is right up my alley.
---
I stick to light armour, (I used to do medieval re-enactment... no way I would wander the woods wearing heavy-ass steel gear).
---
I stick to "rigs" as opposed to costumes. Jeans, flannel, with gear over it. If I'm going to wear armour, it's visible, right? And I generally pick stuff that makes sense. I'm not gonna wear a skirt while running through the woods, or shorts, or t-shirts.
---
Cosmetic stuff is picked for practicality... toques, brimmed hats, etc, sunglasses/ goggles.  
---
Weapons, I stick to stuff that I could realistically carry. One .308 rifle, one sidearm ( a .44 special), one close combat weapon (that makes sense!... ever carry a sledgehammer any distance?) I tend to stick to things like knives, axes, knuckles, etc. Axes are my favourite... it's a survival game, an axe would be essential.
---
I keep my camp mobile. A sleeping bag, a cooking station, a stash box (the stash box makes zero sense in a realistic context, but impossible to play the game without it), I use benches as I find them, and remember their locations. I drop a LOT of junk during the game, due to weight limits. I leave behind a LOT of gear.
---
I limit my gear to what I see as realistic limits. A grenade. A couple days water. a couple days food. 4 dozen rounds of ammo for each weapon. Etc. 
---
I backpack... so I try to envision the stuff I'm carrying, and whether or not I could carry it all with a 50/60L pack, and stick to it. That's why I limit myself to the sleeping bag as opposed to a bed, and my cooking station is the "cast iron pot on the ground". 
---
I pick perks that seem to make "sense"... being more effective at gathering meat from hunted animals, for example, and avoid the more "wacky" perks.
---
I 100% know that I am hobbling myself, in terms of character development (IF you gauge character dev. only in terms of endgame power), but I find that playing this way makes the game so much fun, for me.
---
Now the question is does he have long blonde hair and a beer belly?
---
Otherwise I love what you wrote there!
---
I don't think maintaining equipment is unfun, as long as it's not a ridiculously common chore it adds immersion in the game world.
---
For power armor, it allows your defenses to be worn down after prolonged fighting. Topping up your equipment for a big mission would only make sense, but weapons always breaking in fights is very annoying.
---
Imagine if your PA actually showed visible damage near the end of an SBQ fight?
---
I don't mind being out in the wastes alone. Thanks!
---
I don't mind a challenge. Cheers!
---
yes, ballistic fiber seems to be the hardest thing to get, you have to go out of your way to get any at a military place
---
I don't think it's based solely on whether or not another CAMP is nearby.  I have a feeling it takes into account whether or not a player, or potentially even a monster, is within that radius too.  Because, like you, when I get blocked, I go over there and see what's there.  Sometimes there is a legitimate CAMP.  Other times, there's absolutely nothing.
---
Ok, thx for the answer, I made a rework of my build because I prefer non-automatic riffle, i don't want a vats build ( I use vats but I love learning to aim too) so this is the new one
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwIOBQMEDgcBAQEJAgQFCQoNEg8DJHgDuwEDpgEDbAOnAQMQA4ABA+gBAwsDbwVPA0AFxQEDPwPNAQE2AsQBA/ABAzcCDQEDTgEECwEFEgEGIgEHDQIITgIJDwEKCwILIgIOdwEPrQEBELIBARGzAQEMDQMNTgMTXAEV6AEBEg8CFAsDFiIDF3cCGKMBARmtAQIaLQEbsgECHLMBAh0PAx6CAQEf6AECIHcDIX4BInkBI3YBJK0BAyWyAQMmswEDJw8EKF0BKYIBAirwAQErfgIseQItdgIu8AECLw8FMKQBATHoAQMyggEDM34DNHkDNXYDNvABAzeCAQQ4ggEF
---
&gt; OP didn't say their level 
---
"I never have enough ammo to deal with anything 50+, and damn near everything is now that I'm above 70".
---
&gt;You’d have t pvp AND WIN
---
you dont. his suggestion is that the player who collects the bounty gets a weapon. that doesn't force the pacifist player into pvp. it rather raises the risk of the griefer by being killed and actually looted by an other player on the server who is able to kill him.
---
Get the plans for the cooler and use it as your stash. It's a little more immersive if still less than logical. Maybe the small tent too?
---
Put where is raiders freedom? I mean sure they can attack, but non raiders have magical shield that reduces raiders attack damage and raiders get 0 gear from you. Ok, lets give raider more harsh penalties on attacking/killing you, but that also means lets give none raiders more things to lose and remove slap damage. Right nowm raiders have to go many miles more than none raiders have to and for what? Few pieces of junk. 
---
It does stop you from accidentally accepting a pvp 'challenge' though, so there's that.
---
there is a workshop with 3 acid resources, i think its the one near the water park, hope that helps!
---
I'm seriously motivated to hunt down high level players right now and don't care about their loot.
---
As someone mentioned, oxhorn did some videos with this recently.  Lucky Hole Mine and The Interloper as well as this town itself.  But the first two really are the ones that go into more depth about it.  His theory iirc from the videos are that these are basically cthulu type of old God deities and these heads are from worshippers or something of these gods from long ago
---
If you have someone to practice the interface with, check it out. It definitely is not a user friendly interface. I do find that, on PS4, it is easy to exit out of it before you're ready. I kept doing that accidentally with a friend and we were only trading things for 0 caps.
---
If you genuinely mean to help, thanks.
---
Where's griefing explicitly mentioned as a bannable offense in Bethesda's rules?
---
I had a similar fight like this on tuesday. 2 griefs killed my friend and his wife at their base. So my friend tracks them back to their base, I log in, travel to them, kill them both and destroy their rad shower. I figure payback is payback. We then had a close fight back and forth for over an hour at Rob Co. It was awesome.
---
Best part is that after the long fight the 2 guys come thank us for fighting back and actually being a challenge. It was the most fun I have had in a while on 76. Very satisfactory 
---
Good idea. Just… gotta find the plans.
---
Hemlock Holes is my second home along with the acid node my base sits on. I even have a perfected method for setting it up each time I login and take it. In the past 30-60 days either my friends or I have claimed it whenever we login.
---
p.s. Thanks for the tip even though I already knew. :)
---
The game is awesome. When better now with all the updates. Not getting bored yet and I got over 500+ hours in. Been playing since beta
---
Concur with others - at L12, you should spend your time on the forest, gaining levels and perks.  couple more levels and you can venture into toxic valley.  
---
in the 20's, you can start path of the wind and perhaps top of the world, IF no high levels have been through lately.
---
Most of the ashheap will likely also be too difficult until you reach the 30's.
---
Whitsprings and most points on the west side of the map - you'll die frequently, and quickly.
---
I think the "high level critter spawn if a high level player is around" does not necessarily apply in the Forest.  I'm a 35, - teamed with a 13, 32, and 112 last night. When we were in the forest/flatwoods/gorge/airport area, critters were no more difficult that if I was in the forest solo.  Once we passed  grafton dam and headed west, that changed.
---
Yes, I do.  Farming ammo and caps is easy.  Taking workshops is not necessary.  You CAN enjoy the game and ward off the griefers.
---
Its a good easy spot to save yourself the hassle when low level. I still have that suit if I don't want to waste the fusion core on my power armor. 
---
Both are at Sutton station if I recall correctly.
---
That's awesome... I would thank you as well!
---
Just sad we have to do it. It’s like Bethesda doesn’t even understand the definition of Pacifist.. if we put the mode on, we shouldn’t be able to be involved in any PvP action nor should our bases. (I personally don’t use it as I’ve never encountered a griefer on Xbox but I could understand how annoying it would be &amp; truly if it kept happening it’d push me from the game) 
---
You're forgetting that we're all from the same vault, have worked closely together for 20 years, and were specifically selected because we'd work together to rebuild the country.
---
Except for the one asshole you can read about in the vault's security office.
---
So, if you want to discuss it via lore, we shouldn't be shooting each other.  Like the BoS or Responders don't shoot each other.
---
If you want to discuss it via "all multiplayer games have PvP", you're forgetting the vast majority have some sort of consent system where you can't damage someone until they do something to turn on PvP/Travel to the PvP zone.
---
Believe it or not I got 3 over a 2 hour period about a week ago and forgot to put on starched genes and ran thru a Decontamonation shower... thankfully they weren’t great mutations...    however I’ve heard that even starched might not protect me from being cured.  Anyone know if that’s true?
---
Oh thanks. Didn’t see that. Up too late playing Fallout. Ha. Comment retracted.
---
Where on earth did you find a plasma grenade at level 7?
---
Pretty much, there are instances where coating the broad side of a barn is useful but most of the time you don't want to be firing that many bullets.
---
yeah, but 7% is 7% , lol
---
My BoS chest is above 100 in dmg when over repair'd, very nice armor :)
---
I will. However, I still envision a “counteroffer” button for both sides where you hit it, the current offer price comes up, you change the price and submit. The other side would get a popup with the modified price and an option to reject or counteroffer again. It would be much more seamless than messaging.
---
Yeah they’ll only get half of the bounty. Do some research before bitching.
---
Bethesda response about this a few days ago: “We are looking to make changes to Pacifist mode that, when enabled you will not be able to take damage from other players. The plan is for this to also carry over to your C.A.M.P. as well.” 
---
Didnt we have ammo stations in FO NV?  Liek you could break down ammo and repurpose it into other types of ammo
---
And on the METRO series of games, bullets you create are less effective than factory produced bullets, i kind of like this idea
---
I noticed I had a dozen fusion cores in my stash so now I walk around in PA full time, it takes a lot less Black Titanium to repair Excavator than it took ballistic fiber to repair a bunch of chunks of metal that I polished.
---
Ooooh. I know where I'm heading this evening. Thanks!
---
It's sad and Bethesda should have picked a different word to use here. All Pacifist does is protect you from harming someone else. It's truly what the word means, you don't believe in War and Harming others, but it doesn't wrap you in a shroud of protection and keep you from being harmed. As soon as people understand that, they'll know what is going on here. Still it would be best if they just turned off PVP in Adventure mode. The only area to consider is Workshops and the High School events. If PVP was turned off they'd only be wasting bullets and annoying people. I can deal with that more than dying and having to repair a base over an over.
---
Your extortion racket has a flaw.  They can leave the server.
---
50% chance to be either cooked or burned.
---
Oh I’m a melee build with what I do anyways.   Scorchbeasts (when I’m alone they love to land), mutants, deathclaws, glowing ones, etc - all get the hammer so to speak.  But sometimes when I’m farming for things like Stimpacks and such up north, the lower level creatures don’t always need a 240 damage swing to take em out.
---
def, I have been sniped at workshops and also had help defending workshops, thankfully more of the latter...
---
I'm at about 300 hours in. I wouldn't call them all griefers, but I know for a fact I have over 70 player kills. I know I have more, just no way to track them. My friends ofteb call on me when someone is stealing their workshop or just being a jerk. I love the pvp and don't expect it to change anytime soon
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
it was 600-700 before they nerfed them. all ghouls were giving "crowned" exp. i remember getting 700 exp if you had inspiration lvl 3 and well rested. 
---
I'm on PC, I'll take the job. PM me
---
YUSSSS!!!!
---
You only get caps for winning, 200 I believe. Just going off of what my friend says about it.
---
THANK YOU, but also THANK BETHESDA!!
---
Even happened last night. I blocked the guy and went somewhere else on the map. I think something fishy was up. The guy was in powerarmor but the graphics for it were all screwed up, like the way some scorched hold weapons all wrong, but his armor pieces were like that too. Is there some new bug or exploit going around?
---
Well he obviously stuck around and probably didn’t remove himself from the area then takes to reddit to complain that getting hit 400 times with slap damage killed him
---
a lot of people exp exploited and deny it. wish bethesda made some examples of the players who specifically did this and ban'd them or reduced their level. 
---
ive got almost 900 hours now, i got a lvl 208, a lvl68 and a lvl35 character. So if you play 1 character, level 400 is possible depending how much you took advantage of the whitesprings ghouls giving crowned exp (700 exp a pop) awhile back. thats how my main character got so high leveled was because everyone farmed whitesprings hardcore like it went out of fashion. 
---
you could just be dedicated to farming exp. even though i got 900 hours or so, im pretty lazy and was never trying to level specifically. 
---
It said something about resetting your character with all new more powerful abilities, if your above lvl 50 
---
I know what pacifist means, and yeah, it works the way it should, but I think the other function is better, if you have to change the name then do it, but dealing *and* taking no damage is how it should work...
---
Just make offers.
---
I love this kind of effort
---
Agreed. 
---
Anyone build a camp up there yet? I'm wondering if you'd spawn at the top or bottom when you fast travel to it
---
I would really like this option. I am not very good at building camps myself.
---
Its not like your levels mean anything other than how much youve played. Wait and see how it works before you get mad. It just seems like a way to give high level players more tools 
---
Yeah idk how realistic it is for the only survivors to  be vault 76 ppl and after x years living peacefully in the vault everyone goes homicidal on each other 5 minutes after reclamation day. 
---
Idk are the other players supposed to represent survivors from the other factions? Bc the storyline doesn't mention survivors. 
---
We see each others points just fine, we just disagree that a game that isnt online only should be compared to one that is. Its no big deal. 
---
Glad you are excited as much as I am!!
---
There are two power connectors.  One is the blue switch-like thing.  That is the power for the door.  Give it constant power.
---
The other connector is just above the middle of the door.  This one is the "open door" connection.  
---
So, wire power to the door and now you can open it from the keypad side.  Put a pressure plate on the other side of the door.  Run power to the pressure plate and then from the plate to the middle of the door.  Now when you step on the plate, the door will open.
---
I'm on PS4,  a 95% solo/gather as much junk as humanly possible kind of player too. Been playing from Beta, just hit lvl 75  and I pretty much play it exactly like FO4. Had to deal with jerkoffs 3 times, the only stuff you loose is junk you were carrying, everything else you have stays safe. I have a total blast and 100% recommend picking it up.
---
Thanks for the reply :). Thankfully I have never been slapped to death. If someone slaps me, they get 1 hit lol.
---
Craft and scrapping is the only way
---
Workshops and the High School PvP areas should be the only places allowed in Adventure mode. If you claim a Workshop and someone decides to contest this claim, you have a choice, you can PvP to keep it or simply let it go. If you leave the circle of PvP, then your giving up your claim and damage is not taken. If you want to have a full PvP experience, then head to Survival and have a ball over there.
---
That is true, but they will lose any workshops they have.
---
There are endless arguments for and against this topic....all we can do is wait to see what Bethesda implement and go from there
---
PC 
---
May I have a link to this info that has made me so happy 
---
Up the rewards for them, make it HUGE, and make it a personal reward **from that player's stuff**. Also, make it impossible to collect if you're on that player's friend list.
---
Make bounties matter. Make them so incredibly valuable that players with bounties on them will find zero peace.
---
Also, remove slap damage from all pacifist players, entirely. "Pacifist" should remove those players from PvP entirely... have pacifist/co-op worlds, it's the only logical choice.
---
The highest I've ever seen was something like Lv. 550.
---
Morgantown 
---
I like to see what other people have done with the same space. I wonder if the player currently occupying the space logs out if our camp would be loaded in...Anyone tried this?
---
Im at 285.  Gained a ton of levels at Whitespring before they nerfed XP there.  Early on, I was always sure to be well rested and have the appropriate charisma cards in place to maximize XP gains.  I don't bother with it now, but I run pretty much exclusively in the Mire and the Bog, so I still pick up 3 or 4 levels a night just by farming for legendaries.
---
Make friends with melee players who don't power armor. I give my gun toting bretherans thousands of screws a week
---
If you want to be tankier, you can max blocker, evasive, and barbarian. If you’re bloodied then you most likely should have a couple unyielding armor pieces which really boost evasive and barbarian 
---
That’s not a bad idea actually.  I have more than enough fusion cores at the moment.
---
I leave so many mats laying around it really really makes me wish thrre was a donation box somewhere that everyone knew about 
---
Not true, not even that high when nuked.  At lvl 257 I know this for a fact.  find me a youtube video proving this and I'll give you 15k caps.  
---
Yeah, that is no longer prestige system. When resetting your levels brings new abilities, it becomes mandatory. 
---
I've supported fallout for along time. They never have implemented one before, I don't see why now. You could just as easy say get to 120 to unlock a new thing. That way players will try to have the highest lvl aslo it make lvl mean something again. Also I'm not as mad as the post came off. 
---
Will they tho? if the only way to get on the same world server as a  Pacifist is to also be a Pacifist then who will bother to go to all that trouble when they cannot hurt anyone? doing all what you listed would be boring for someone who wants to pvp.....what you listed was pure griefing and thats a different issue...
---
No - on PC! Where do you find so much if it?
---
You get a sort of ‘nuke zone’ type marker on the map and then have to move to that location and start your killing spree. Mine was in the golf course at WS, not sure if the locations change.
---
I won the battle, but didn’t not notice what I got as a ‘prize’ unfortunately.
---
Which has exactly what to do with what I said?
---
Diseases are shown with a little red picture under your AP, it's a toxic sign. And you can see what you have and what it does in the pip boy, go to the section with fallout boy on it and go to the next one.
---
If he was attacking you and you killed him you'll be fine, also your bounty amount is shown near the AP bar also.
---
Have fun :D
---
Your diseases are shown in the STAT section of the pip boy under the Special tab. 
---
Vault Tech isn't known for it's honesty to vault residents...
---
Both, enemies spawn to the lowest level player in the area. But are capped in certain areas. The Vault being the lowest level and the further you go outwards from there the tougher they get
---
I couldn’t agree more, global chat in MMO’s is always a toxic waste of screen space.
---
Local chat, sure.  I prefer voice chat, but local text chat is okay.
---
See, I’d rather see them up the effectiveness of the turrets so they do some serious damage to pvp.  I understand not wanting to be raided or pvp but it would be better if you had a badass base that you could fall back to and it could clobber them. 
---
Kind of like luring them into white springs and running around the robots hoping they’ll hit one, except if someone shoots you, your turrets take em out automatically. Would make base building more interesting. 
---
Do you meed to wear the responder uniform to open trade with the vendor?
---
Not furious, just a bit disappointed. 
---
All the time!  Never a meat mad mutant to be seen
---
i think the problem you described had something to do with a change in the atom store files.
---
the bug with the paint is fixed for a while now.
---
Power armour needs to be durable enough to last through an entire SBQ fight and beyond without the perk power patcher being compulsory for that. It’s perfectly o.k exactly as is. There is no fun in breaking an excavator leg etc and becoming instantly over encumbered. Add to that the fact you can still find no place to spawn if you die over encumbered and have to leave the server so you would not then be able to finish the SBQ fight. I can think of lots of reasons why changing P.A durability would be a bad idea so I have to disagree
---
That's what I'm worried about. Glad I'm not the only one. I wanna hope they do it properly but.. Will see haha 
---
Yes they typically scale with you, but there is the phenomenon of a lower level player causing enemies to spawn at a lower level. 
---
You don’t have to use materials to rebuild your camp. Moving it even an inch fixes everything. 
---
Also: Block offending player(s) then jump servers. 
---
Amen to that !! that guys view is naive at best , it’s becoming so frequent as to be seriously annoying !! From white springs to uranium fever I encounter griefers , I go by work shops you see stealth builds perched while the bait tries to instigate a fight!! And as far as slap damage I’m in power armor 24/7 fully modded x01 or ultracite and I been one hit killed by slap damage!!, so the argument of you can walk away is bullshit  !! I’ve had assholes that I’ve ignored in PvP see me on the map and target my base after I leave . I’m either involved in a quest or don’t pay attention and return to rubble !! It’s so bad that I’ve built my base on cliff you need power armor to jump to and I spend all camp time crouched !!! But I love how some people call this Bethesda abuse and continue to no fault them for any of the problems in the game !! Pvp is broken as hell and for the majority of us that are pve and generally love interacting with players and doing quests or missions ,dealing with griefers it’s a goddam drag . Now don’t get me wrong the workshop /raider faction element is cool and adds that level of excitement that you willingly accept by taking over one, but when you can’t defend yourself,  even remotely from ungodly damage builds,  it’s one sided and total bullshit!!
---
This happened to me the other day, if im in pacifist mode and cant kill you, you should not be able to kill me.  
---
I still havent found a gourd I can plant in my place even though I have picked up several in farms. I am also sad that we cannot plant crops we find like starlight berries, brain fungus, etc. Even if those plants are specific to where your CAMP is located so the region matters would be acceptable.
---
Everyone else mentioned it, you know Interloper and that, but another redditor here compiled some cool clues in this [thread](https://reddit.app.link/tyURpZ6KRU).
---
That's what I'm not sure I fully understand. He had never hit *me*, nor my buddy from what he said... He was just standing around us machine gunning all our crafting tables into the dust.
---
I wasn't even sure that my first R1 would connect for full damage, but it did, so he was definitely somehow "hostile" to me.
---
I got cussed out on area chat because I was in the bottom of the golf club collecting all my loot when another player loaded in and they all came for me and it was kill or be killed. Just bad timing on his part. 
---
It isn’t not click bait
---
I've just started playing on PC too had 1 pvp fight in the last 2 weeks (my fault Pacifist mode wasn't on and tagged someone in an event)game feels very much like playing fallout 4 with other people around no need to worry about the pvp crap that fallout fans didn't want.... 
---
With max Gun Nut and Weapon Artisan, I maybe have to repair mine once after several hours of solid use. Seems to be working fine for me?
---
When the changes are implemented there will be a new reason for these posts...
---
What do you do about pacifist mode turret farms at White Springs or elsewhere? Someone kiting mobs into your base or just into you? Someone one-shotting all the mobs you're trying to kill? Server hop and hope for the best? 
---
You're going to see the level of griefing go way up when there are zero consequences. Those players don't want to PVP so they will stick around in survival mode for a death or two and come right back to adventure. At least now I can light them up and hope they are dumb enough to shoot back.
---
As others have noted in the replies here, we are looking into changes. [We commented on it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ax6ll8/comment/ehsgjgt/), but here is a direct quote if you don't want to click to a new thread;
---
&gt; We are looking to make changes to Pacifist mode that, when enabled you will not be able to take damage from other players. The plan is for this to also carry over to your C.A.M.P. as well. 
---
There's a workshop in the very far, far, South of the savage divide with 3 nuclear nodes.  It might help a bit with this.
---
I think they did it because many players want a full respec.
---
Never knew about this. Awesome idea. CHanging my CAMP tonight for sure.
---
So, If I see one of these in the world, should I shoot out a couple jets? Will this be helpful for some rando?
---
On point.
---
I have a lvl 1 hazmat suit and lvl 50
---
What if it tracks your prestige level too? Like your character is lvl 50 and prestige 10 or something (could show as a small badge next to the name)
---
yes pretty much. max adamantium means your limbs will never be crippled so pointless to have strengthened.
---
High rads means that your Max health is capped, hence lowering your health. 
---
So let's say your health bar is 100HP in full ( i know it's more but let's just go with it because it's easier). And you have 60% rads, then it makes your max HP just 40%. This is more than enough to start seeing effects of Bloodied. And the damage stat on your weapon gets higher if your health drops down even more.
---
RadCool also indeed buffs your strength and melee damage. You may also find that the damage stat on your weapon changes when you toggle between equipping it and not equipping it. I think this is because it is looking at all your perks and other factors only when the weapon is equipped, so it recalculates. 
---
Also, do you use the Adrenaline perk? Because even having just one point of of 5 in that will increase your damage for 30 seconds. Potentially up by 60% for 5 kills in 30 seconds. 
---
Mutations will significantly change your damage output, but so will some chems and food. They all add up, specifically on that Fire Axe. There are chems that give you 25% extra damage
---
Lucky guy, I've been server hopping for hours with no joy. They need to just make the plans for sale like all the other power armours. Server hopping is a ridiculous game mechanic
---
I like people that think a like. I don't agree with the Stash Box. I think you should not have a magical access to all of your stuff. I think that Train Stations and Red Rockets solve for the Stash Box. I think it should be sleeping bag/cot (small bed only), the tiny cook stove, and one type of workbench only. You can sleep, cook, scrap and repair/create one type of item only. You should not be able to Fast Travel to it and it should not take up any space like a real CAMP does, its a tiny spec on the map an limited to only two squares max. It's just a mini camp is all.
---
It sucks that happened to you, but I don't think the game should be altered based on your experience.  I'm sure it sucked, but the setting is an unforgiving wasteland.  If anything, pacifist is a bonus.  I remember logging into Rust to find weeks of items gone, with a sick feeling in my stomach.  At least Fallout is kinder in comparison to other games in the genre.
---
After hearing how resetting levels after 50 brings more powerful abilities....Before hearing it, my interest to play was 0, after hearing it, it is now -81. I am sitting on level 131, I am already losing 81 levels on reset and now if I was to play I lose even more. So basically if you are past level 50 and now keep playing, you are just digging your own hole deeper.
---
Agreed. It would also be good to be able to trade item for item instead of caps. 
---
Played it since launch, no regrets. Best to have some friends for good times! 
---
I have noticed that the bullies only go after my workshops when I have my low level friends take them (like 40 or below). They just see the low level guy and dive in, not realizing I own 2 other characters with reset buttons (Nice 1 hit builds).
---
It can be frustrating at times, but I have more fun crushing pvpers then giving in and server hopping.
---
I have haha. He's super excited for the camp changes.
---
Tbh I have really high hopes for this road map. As someone who's always liked 76 but has been extremely critical of it. I've had a a hugely different and fun experience playing with a friend. And sometimes it really does feel like a normal Beth games with a friend. I think this summer will enhance thah even more. 
---
All BoS locations. Each of the Firebases have 1 or 2 rolls of Military Grade Duct Tape and 2 to 4 Military Ammo Bags. I have a Ballistic Fiber giveaways. Each BoS location (for me) is a must hit everytime I log in so at the end of a 7 day period I have around 250-300 Ballistic Fiber
---
I love the franchise but this game is so empty. Nothing drags me into it, the quests are a complete bore and the storyline has to be the laziest one yet. Every time I log in it feels like more of a list of chores than a game I can lose myself in. I find myself constantly spending time looting the same areas for fusion cores and hitting grafton to make more .50 cal rounds only to spend a few hundred downing a SB for more food to cook.
---
Kill yau guai
---
Got so many screws I sell them to robots when I run out of Chema to sell
---
Does Luck of the Draw make a difference here, or not really?
---
Just make it so that those of us that dont want to PVP, if attacked that attacker instantly dies if they attacki and vise versa. Seems simple to me...
---
*If*, and this is a big if, your base can be placed again.  Unfortunately, due to whatever bizarre logic Bethesda uses to detect "floating" foundations, many bases refuse to be replaced.  That's why you see bases that try to minimize the number of foundation pieces - because if you can place that one foundation, you can place the rest of it.
---
Yeah if they weren't trying to get along it's a free for all then.
---
Level 888 people very likely just used one of the experience exploits
---
Great idea also.
---
I really want this functionality. as it stands I have to build around any spawn point or anyone visiting me gets stuck in my foundation. furthermore where I spawn in is never the same either. I have spawned under foundations, under water purifiers, outside camp proxomity, under water, down a cliff, the list goes on. it's absolutely frustrating and very poorly designed to not allow a custom spawn point for ourselves and any visitors.
---
Lol I have level 140 and 74 characters also. I was on my new toon and had my mate transfer some bombs for me.
---
Psa grenading hordes of ghouls is a great way to tag the whole group.
---
Including the entire list of screw-containing junk would make the comment a tad unwieldy.

---
I really enjoy it. I went in with lowered expectations, due to all the online salt, and I have been nothing but pleasantly surprised. 
---
The game isn't without bugs, but no worse than any Bethesda FO game since 3, and better than some of them at launch, for sure.
---
I like it. I like the sparse wasteland, with the only other humans being players... it FEELS more like a post-apoc game doe this reason. I like the setting, I really enjoy the lore to be found in holotapes and the little vignettes set up all over the place, I find myself actually invested in some of the quests and storylines, and persistent "background character stories" that pop up all over the map.
---
I am 100% happy with the game. Would I make some minor changes here and there? Probably. I find the hit detection a bit wonky sometimes in close combat, 3rd person mostly, and that can be frustrating.
---
I like the players I have encountered for the most part, they've been a welcome addition to the game, and most stick to the "feel". I especially appreciate the players that are obviously "playing a character". My two favourites thus far have been the creepy skinny dude in the t-shirt and jeans and a  porkpie hat, that emote "follow me" to his camp where he tried to sell me drugs, and the skinny, leapy, sword-wielding, black-clad ninja that never stopped jumping, and kept showing up to help kill things before leaping away.
---
I find the cartoony "emotes" are a FANTASTIC way to play a social game, and enjoy them more than actual chat.
---
I love it. I really do. I'm super happy I decided to check it out myself and ignore the online bitching.
---
As in you have to log off (switching server) and back on to change it? I think that's a bad idea. Give it a cooldown to turn off. Don't make it so we have to change servers to turn it off or on. WoW has a method that works well. You can turn PvP *on* at any point, but can only turn it *off* if you haven't participated in PvP for 5 minutes.
---
They don't reliably have screws on sale, and they don't have many to sell.  It's faster to blitz through some buildings than to server hop until the vendor has screws, and you get more.
---
I haven't even made it that far, I do like the setting though and I can understand the whole "no npcs" thing as its only 25 years since the bombs dropped, so it kinda makes sense, but I think adding the ability to create clans and settlements that require upkeep would add more realism to the game. 
---
Why do you want more levels? It only increases the caps you lose from getting killed. You aren’t being forced to do anything and frankly it’s way too premature to start crying about a feature that hasn’t even been described in detail 
---
Yeah, I love the game to but took a month long hiatus since I got AC origins and odyssey on sale in the steam store. I have come to the realization that odyssey will be nowhere near finished by next tuesday and will have to put it on hold while i enjoy the new content.
---
Because speaking from experience, they rarely want to die. They want easy kills and as soon as you take their caps a couple times they change servers. 
---
Think about what pacifist mode really brings. There will be zero consequences to poor behavior. 
---
Why wouldn't I just build a rocket farm at White Springs? You can't do anything about it and think of how fast I can level. 
---
Why wouldn't I one shot all the mobs instead of sharing the loot/xp? You can't do anything about. 
---
Oh my base won't load... I'll just kite mobs into yours until you quit. 
---
Been like this since day one. If you equip it and put all your ammo in your stash and then take it out again you can charge it up like normal.
---
Also the gun still gets the enemy health regen glitch constantly as seen here: https://youtu.be/9-AFywI188A
---
Thanks mom but I'm not gonna do what u tell me.

Right I'm at 242, I'm a lil worried haha they need to think things out better. 
---
Lol I just have fun. I feel like it comes off as "bragging" when I share my stories. I just share the good ones where I get lucky XD
---
Wait, concrete foundations *stack?*
---
Yeah. You could put photos in your Photomode folder and they will appear as loading screens in game.
---
Pick 2 grenade types and use them only. I run frags and plasma grenades only because that what I pick up the most then sell the rest. I also carry 2 heavy guns (.50BMG and 40mm auto launcher with 40-60 rnds) then the res of my wheel is sniper rifle, shotgun, melee weapon, drugs. Narrow the window down, stack perk cards for the heavy guns and explosives and you'll be good.
---
Bro im level 62 and i havnt even done the first quest line yet, this game is great.
---
The first person into a spawn zone causes mobs to spawn at their level range. So if a lvl 14 person runs into a zone first, the lvl 100 person behind them will be fighting lvl 14 mobs until they're killed and start to respawn.
---
The same, adverse affect goes for the unfortunate lvl 14 who happens to be the 2nd person into the zone after the lvl 100.
---
This is why high level players get upset with low level players running through upper zones, and also why low level players are upset with high level players in lower zones.
---
Dude, this is exactly the type of response I was looking for. I agree with the light armor and costume. The only exception I've made is using the mailman costume and that's only because of that costume having the mailbag attached so that I can act like that's how I'm carrying my gear and junk. I also made a corny joke with my wife that I wear it because I'm here to "deliver the pain"...
---
I agree with your stance on weapons, too. I usually try to keep a pistol, a rifle, shotgun, and a melee.
---
I'm glad you added the bit about keeping your camp mobile. I meant to make mention of that in my post as well. That makes me wish we had two camps: one we could build a stationary home on and one that's just mobile, like a tent/sleeping bag.
---
I like your suggestions for how you limit gear. Is there an exact number you shoot for when determining a couple of days worth of food/water? And is there a set amount of carry weight you try to limit yourself to on chems or junk?
---
Blimey, wish I had that kind of dedication!
---
Deliberately instigating PvE is a perfectly valid tactic, and it has the pleasant side effect of preventing them from fast traveling too.
---
Gee who could have predicted it would come to this?
---
I mean besides everybody?
---
Other players as in NPCs? Cuz every faction member I ever find of any kind is always dead upon arrival. 
---
And the perk that puts you back in stealth when you crouch. Forget the name. 
---
So if I told you to eat dirt youd do it if it was in a few months and I said it will be cool
---
Am I the only one concirned that they cut it to add it later as "DLC" to make it look like they were working?
---
try the discord my dude
---
... what?
---
Sugar Grove is probably the fastest for getting a small pile.  There's a few globes and fans inside, and doesn't take long to clear.
---
(It'll take about three hours for the fans and globes to re-appear, even if you change servers.)
---
Beyond that, most "office" locations have some screw-bearing junk.
---
I use diluted stims and radaway, never really have a problem. Just hotkey them
---
As in you have to log off (switching server) and back on to change it? I think that's a bad idea. Give it a cooldown to turn off. Don't make it so we have to change servers to turn it off or on. WoW has a method that works well. You can turn PvP on at any point, but can only turn it off if you haven't participated in PvP for 5 minutes.
---
As usual a childish response. Does it make you feel like a big boy now?  Maybe you should take your own advice and learn to read as I have not refuted anything you have said. Only reiterated my original point HAHAHAHa .. but typical response from a 12 year old little boy.
---
I'm not saying wait too long, most legendary enemies are dead in the first 30 secs they spawn, on uranium fever. It ain't hard to wait 10 to 15 secs after you already got your hits. 
---
Wrong side of the bed for this morning?

'The cost of rebuilding is much more punishing'
---
 I've always thought the rebuild cost was pretty nominal. The only things hard to fix are crops and Decon showers. With the contractor perk is practically free.
---
My base is a single platform to a staircase to the house so it’s easy to place anywhere. 
---
To the people that have been using the campfire glitch or some other glitch to build their camp, I give no fucks. 
---
Fix the broken level system you have before you complicated even more, make being a high level of blessing not a curse. Hopefully that's what will happen ya know. It could be a good thing but I just don't care for idea. 
---
I don't need em, but I still check the armory for calibrated shocks and jetpacks... I havn't seen either since the patch that put "all" plans at vendors...
---
Well the person I responded to plays on PC. So you're more than welcome to it when I get off work tonight.
---
It’s true. I used to farm there and would remember some that even hit over 700 a little with exp modifiers (inspiration, bobble head, and food)
---

Go to 3:44.
---
So how bout dem caps :D....
---
Why would you admit to that on a public forum?
---
Some people have no shame.
---
There is a building exploit that lets you attach foundations horizontally to floors no matter what is or is not under them.  There is another that lets you put 1x2 stairs onto non-foundation bases (allowing you to stack them).  There is a third that allows you to place objects that would normally be placed in dirt onto rugs that are then moved indoors.  (That's why there are water purifiers and water pumps and crops on the 5th floor and a rad shower and pressure plate on the 4th floor.). 
---
I've since rebuilt that base and put the 5th floor on stilts.  Why is everything up there? So the local enemies don't destroy everything.  I'll post pictures tomorrow.
---
The dude *is* a griefer.
---
I guess I just enjoy the chaos of it all. It's definitely more fun in a group than solo. And I will agree that many aspects of the pvp are broken. I'm just working with the "canvas" I was given to make my own fun. 
---
I really enjoy the pvp aspect of this game. Getting to be a bodyguard/security is so much fun for me. I understand the need for separate servers and a re-work. Let's just hope they give us a free perk reset also hehe.
---
Oooooh pics of the naughty nurse build!
---
That'd be fine I'm just worried about them making it like something that you have to do to get these good new things
---
Level 145. 500+ hours in. Never found a TSE of anything. Never found the X-01 Calibrated shocks. And I've farmed, grinded and server hopped. A lot.  The RNG gods clearly dont like me...  
---
I find that more fun too, although I try to accomplish all goals - efficiency, ease of replacement, and blending with the environment.
---
The first two kind of work together.  Efficiency means using few floors, and ease of replacement means having minimal foundations.  It's the blending part - how to make a "floating" house not look like a floating house, that's the fun part.
---
K cool congrats
---
I lost doing that as well. You see someone running up on you randomly you know what time it is
---
I am already part of a discord server that we run we stay killing the queen and dropping nukes at WS
---
Yeah I played for about two weeks after beta and then quit. Came back a few weeks ago and enjoy it much more now. It's a much more stable experience for me.
---
I'm ready to brew some alcoholic beverages.

Property damage is the same as attacking you :)
---
Good... maybe there's more of you than I realize.
---
I think the problem for Bethesda is that the fix requires a major rework and 3 separate types of servers. One type of server for PvE and co-op play only with no pvp at all. One type of server with options the way they are now. And one type of server dedicated to PvP.  It doesn’t seem like an easy fix.
---
First of all, this experience is shared among too many to be just a fluke. My imagination. And it works both ways. In times when any content is consumed by millions, you can literally make a shit and you will find people who will eat it and ask for seconds.  
---
Secondly I do acknowledge that there might be people, who have very different expectations not about the game, but the product overall, that they might find enjoyment in Fallout76. Some people like S&amp;M practices in bed, some like them in game.  
---
The frustration is with people who are praising Bethesda for clearly inferior product. This only encourage the same behavior in the future, which is not good at all.
---
&gt;	your thoughts?
---
I’m thinking that if the game bores you, you really should be playing something else.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯ 
---
Just let use make bases and playermade towns! 
---
While I applaud your dedication the middle part seems designed for their forums though and the rest more likely applied to their communication rules.
---
Maybe we can expand the interpretation of those rule to apply to griefing too but I guess if that was possible we already would have a "meme-recommendation" for every "I was griefed" post with people recommending reporting that person.
---
Also as long as Bethesda doesn't change the way of how this griefing works at the moment there'll always be players/griefers complaining that they only used what the game gave them so it's on Bethesda to just disable griefing at all in PvE (if we want to make it dependent on the PvP mode)
---
seriously those instigating weapons are great for sneaking solo at whitesprings
---
This is impossible. Slap damage does not allow that. I can confirm with videos of testing to prove this slap damage rumor wrong. 
---
I was trying to explain why pvp doesnt make any sense storywise. In my original comment "other players" was referencing actual players not NPCs (all dead). 
---
It doesnt make sense that v76 ppl would venture into the wasteland and start killing each other.
---
The only reasonable narrative for pvp is that some of the player characters are from different factions, but that doesnt work either bc, like you said, all the raiders, bos, enclave, etc are supposed to be dead. It also doesnt work since everyone clearly starts their character as a vault dweller.
---
Man, the other day, someone was selling 20 x-01 shocks for 250 each. I snatched all of them up, equipped them on mine, passed out a bunch to friends. Sold the rest for 1k each. Probably my most profitable day on 76.
---
Captainoob has a weapon spotlight series that's actually pretty informative about weapons and what perks work the best with them. 
---
It's a game changer dude. I am really considering picking up herbivore and moving points out of endurance because of it. Soups cure hunger and thirst.
---
Because these mods own every Bethesda related sub and always enforce their weird rules on all of them. Not to mention The Outerworlds. They did the same thing for that sub too. FeelsBadMan. 
---
You know prestiging is the solution to the high level problem right? The new system does turn the levels you got into a blessing. I agree being a high level sucks right now but keep an open mind because nothing has been announced yet 
---
To be fair, it seems like the BoS and the Responders were actually getting ready to shoot each other (according to the holotapes).
---
This doesn't quality as grief if they left after a done deal, tbh. Only way they had caps from you is if you were wanted. 
---
I server hop looking for PVP opportunities and judging by some other replies here I'm not the only one. There are always people ready to fight. They might be be altruistic though... some of us just like the combat and the caps. ;)
---
Ah, thanks. I was wondering if I had missed something obvious. I sort of miss the tall stacks from FO4. 
---
At 80% rads he would have had to hit you 4-5 times. In all honesty ghoul may have actually downed you and he finished you off while you were on a knee
---
Also this is my I don't know what the fuck build, I just picked shit randomly and I'm only dying rarely so yay
---
I was SO excited when I made it to the top that I [took a video jumping down](https://imgur.com/a/fjN37pw) off it! (Also man I had to dig back on my xbox captures to find that. Apparently that was taken November 18th ahaha)
---
can confirm 600-700 is a little steep. may of exaggerated a bit but with good reason. you kill 2 ghouls quickly, the 377 exp x2 is like 750. so when were clearing whitesprings as a team i always was 750 750 750 over and over. guess i assumed 750 each but it wasnt. 
---
i got video of myself in nuked whitesprings back in November and they were giving 320, 377, 520 exp (for crowned). im not sure if i was using Inspiration in the video or the rested buff though. 
---
Ok
---
Oxhorn for *generally* unbiased gameplay and lore. He is also pretty wholesome and all ages friendly.
---
It's kind of like finding Dense Combat Armor.
---
There are so many damn permutations of mods and armor that landing on that specific one has only occurred once for me.  It is absolutely stupid that mods like these are locked off from scrapping.
---
Back in the old days, of player kill MUDs and such, you could only attack people with a level range of you (+  or - 5). Even that would help dissuade griefers.
---
1) you will notice a red diseased icon underneath your AP in the right corner of your HUD. You can check what that specific disease is under the status tab of your pip boy. You need to scroll over to the second status screen to see what the specific disease is.
---
2) You can kill any wanted player without becoming wanted yourself. Workshops are a little different. Anyone who takes a workshop is essentially fair game and can be killed. You can retaliate without becoming wanted. If you become wanted your bounty will be displayed in caps on your HUD. You can also turn on passificst more so that you don’t accidentally attack others players. They can still attack you, but won’t do much damage unless you retaliate or have an active workshop. A bit of advice: if you don’t want to participate in PvP then don’t take workshops.
---
Do mods keep working after the game updates? 
---
Also the raiders pretty much washed up the responders
---
If somebody won’t stop “slapping” you, lay down in a bed. You’ll heal from resting faster than they can kill you. Eventually they’ll go away.
---
I am level 181 myself, and I don't have a problem with a prestige reset, as long as it doesn't me reset to level 1 and makes me unable to use my high level gear and weaponry. We need something like this (and/or higher level loot) to keep endgame players in the game.
---
A high level number just for bragging rights is meaningless.
---
In other subs, it causes a influx of content. Which sounds good, but a lot of the content is lazy and bad. It’s hard to moderate. But if they allowed one day for it, it would be nice 
---
There’s an SMG in the men’s bathroom by the indoor pool at Bolton Greens golf course.
---
No I mean the official fallout network discord that is linked here. They have rooms specifically for trading on all 3 systems.
---
I didn't mean the armor would break down after an hours time, I mean after an hours worth of prolonged combat. There are stretches of time between every fight, you are never actually fighting waves of enemies constantly for 1 hour, thus this would effectively last for many hours.
---
They could also change the cost to repair to reflect the actual damage to the armor, so a light touch-up might only need a little steel. You shouldn't need much ultracite or blacktitanium for repairs, I also suggested that. They could make light damage just an armor repair, while if you wait too long you have internal structure damage needing the ultracite/blackT
---
Being wanted makes them vulnerable to any attack, from anyone, without repercussion.
---
Thanks so much!
---
It's not perfect.  You can get stuck to the walls because of the automatic step-up feature that foundations have.  So you can't have the 1x2 surrounded by foundation or you won't be able to climb the stairs.  I put stash boxes inside to keep you from getting too close to the wall as you round the stairs from floor to floor.
---
&gt; But I should be forced into PVP? ...? No, plenty of games have survived with a pvp system where it allows players to opt out if they want too. Passive mode should be just that .. Passive.
---
You reiterated what point? That passive mode should be stronger? 
---
I already said I would support a stronger passive mode in the *first* comment you replied to. 
---
Your entire reaction here has made *zero* sense, which is why I'm assuming you can't really read well.
---
It’s not just a Bethesda conspiracy. A lot of subs do it because it quickly becomes over saturated with lazy “look at this” pictures. No real added content or ideas. 
---
Cross-faction.  The responders weren't about to shoot responders, and the BoS weren't about to shoot BoS.
---
Huntersville sucks, that's why I put my camp outside there because it's no good farming and you should stay away and leave me alone and I'm not there farming it's just a coincidence.
---
Seriously though, decent density of mutants, legendary ones aren't that common but they do show up, bonus power armor spawn (if you're still looking) and a small herd of creepy-as-hell gnomes/cement fodder if you need it.
---
There is a key bit that he didn’t explain. If you own a workshop then anybody can attack you without being wanted. Once you take a workshop you are essentially automatically engaged in PvP even if you leave the workshop area.
---
For sure. Im not super upset but I have a bad feeling. I've had the game since beta play a lil almost everyday. Also I'm tired of not having a voice about the game. My hopes are that maybe someway some how by us talking we can help Bethesda make the game better. Free focus group! Haha 
---
This guy is on my block list because hes pulled this before.  He tried killing me on my main.  I took 2 stims and finally turned off pacifist and killed him.  Then I blocked him.   Ran into him twice since then though counting last night
---
Aww man, it would have been great to have the mic on making puking noises lamenting how you partied too hard and how it's going to suck heading outside with a massive hangover.
---
More like bored
---
I know, just letting you know which one worked for me.
---
Word, bored of the meta. Show me them roleplayz.
---
Was lucky and got the jetpack the same day I got the armor, built a torso just for it and the Stealth too later on.  It was just those damn shocks.  I run across the jetpack alot, be glad to snag them if I come across them again, or I'll trade you the whole torso w/ mod if you want.  I never use it since trying it out for a week or so. I like my reactive plates.  I'm XBOX platform.
---
I'm curious what you think you're losing, apart from the high number next to your name.
---
On my part, I kinda felt like I stagnated after level 100 or so.  I would have felt it sooner if I had paid more attention to my build and not spent a lot of level-ups moving stat points around.  I like the idea because it would bring back a sense of progression.  And maybe put stars next to our name, like Legendary mobs.
---
Eh it’s I’ll keep it here chances are there is so many people there I’d have to wait 1000000000000000000000000 just for someone to respond because of other people here it’s just easier
---
I know I read your other replies... 
---
Even with 5* gunsmith I get about 30 mins or less camping ws. Server hop 3 times, do the whole map, then on the 3rd time, gotta repair. 
---
Never been griefed but I always plan on blocking and server hopping. Genuine question about this though - if you have blue printed your camp can you move camp to save on materials and just pay a few caps instead? 
---
Yea man  I'd love to find out, because I've never heard anyone mention getting more than one. I specifically hunt for outfits and almost never get them. Felt like an actual reward for once in this game!
---
How much for the hunters/exterminators armor?
---
I finally made enough lever guns to get a suppressor mod for it. Now… if only that path was open for the extractor and X-01 PA mods! 
---
I figure a days water is about 3-4 L. I shoot for about 8 containers of boiled or purified water. I'll add more if I find it to get it back to CAMP.
---
Food? "enough to get my hunger back to at least 3/4 FULL, to me, is about a day's worth. So, about 3-4 meals worth per day, somedays, I go hungrier than others.  IF I need water, or need to cook, and am too far from home... I spend the caps, move my camp, and set up the cooking station.
---
As for the rest of it, it's more by my "pack size" estimate. 
---
"Would I reasonably/realistically be able to carry this in a 60L Gregory backpack?" is kind of my rule of thumb. I break that rule for some larger stuff that I want to junk, but only if I'm heading "home" shortly. (Kind of a "ooh, this is nice, I wanna keep it, better head for home with it" sorta thing).
---
I know it's ridiculous. I just think it's silly to imagine walking home with 24 Mr handy Fuel containers and a dozen desk fans, while also carrying 4 rifles, a sledgehammer and 3 dozen grenades.
---
I sell all mutation serums for 150 caps each but wont be home till after work.
---
Or just make the extractor loot appear individually to each player so there’s no need to compete. 
---
Yeah the hardcore looter shooter pvp lovers are all mad that it’s not like other pvp looter shooters. But it was never going to be. Don’t get me wrong, Bethesda dropped the ball in a lot of areas. But I think speedily focusing on leveling and getting gear is the wrong way to play this game for the most enjoyment.
---
Not JuiceHead 
---
sounds about right. 
---
Even though levels are meaningless now I've still enjoyed collecting them I always have. I don't want to play a Fallout game where the farther I get the more I have to reset my characters levels
---
Not break from the SBQ fight alone from 100% condition, no. but you shouldn't really come out unscathed as you do now either. It's supposed to feel epic, and it really isn't.
---
It would also add some cost to melee, where currently you save on ammo. You'd be taking more wear and tear on your armor in melee.
---
I agree totally with that.  The old gods and the new just managed to smile a bit on me yesterday.  I wish you the same.  
---
I’m not opposed to the NPC only deal either but everything quest wise feels empty AF.  Clans. Settlements and add ons will help but I’ve had it since launch and I find it’s lost its luster fast. I never seen a strive for realism aside from making me pick up and consume many of the items I typically leave laying around because my character got hungry or thirsty. Having any TSE weapon in game makes the reach for realism impossible IMO. It’s an extremely lame concept to me in general, never been a fan of them. 
---
Mines "I just the pick perk cards with the best pictures" build. :)
---
He does! He wears patrolman sunglasses as well. I haven’t really found any clothes that fit the character yet, so for now he’s wearing the duster from the atomic shop. Thanks for the response!!

Maybe they rotted.  Fast travel and server hops really hit item CND. 
---
Great Idea, A tent with 2 sleeping bags, (so you can have a friend sleepover), a small Stash box (Backpack), and a little Campfire Cooking station.
---
This could be done with a predetermined layout, and allow them to be placed close together, so teams can stay together in dangerous locations.
---
Ok that is fine hit me up on PlayStation

 Nothing like running around Appalachia with a straight jacket on, a skeleton mask, asking people for psycho, chowing down on a ghoul, before running off switchblade in hand singing “wouldn’t it be niiiiice”
---
Thank you. I made my main character just to get a general lay of the land, then created the alt. I love role playing in this world!!
---
I have no idea how that relates to my comment, but okay.
---
Is it possible when he hit me my Tesla armor damaged him ?
---
If I'm in the mood for PVP I'll go play a game that's been well designed for PVP. My preference would be PVE &amp; PVP servers so everyone has the choice for PVP or not. I'm not interested in forcing  people from doing PVP. I resent others forcing their PVP will on me.
---
I agree, I want more songs.  But first, camp radios would be even better.  I know they exist, I had one in the beta.
---
Ok I'll send request now and will send you a message through psn when I get home this afternoon.
---
There's a lot of great feedback in this!
---
We have addressed a few of these already in our [Known Issues and Feedback List](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/). A few notable things are Event Timers, Naming Power Armor and Weapons, and more. I'll look into more of the suggestions on this thread and see if I can get any answers to add to that list as well.
---
I'm cool with them doing Prestige as long as people that Prestige don't get anything special. The only thing player should get from prestiging is just like a little icon next to their name with like a star a crown or something  
---
I had my first griefing experience the other day, and I'm still feeling raw about it.  Dude seemed to be chilling in my pad, and when giving him a thumbs up he wasted me.  And when I came back for vengeance,  saw that he was trying to destroy my CAMP.   
---
Maybe there is some faction of assholes forming...
---
Ok sounds good to me
---
Just running around in only a nurses hat, stimpaking every downed player you find. 
---
lol, are you saying i am lying ?
---
I went from full health two half in a few blows, had just returned from a SBQ fight so passive was on, i have it on probably 99% of my full game time and i never claim workshops ...
---
So belive whatever you want, it's real, no ider how they do that...
---
Screenshots are low effort.  You will get an influx of "Look how pretty this game is" from people who are simply Karma farming.  It eventually will turn into people memeing and the whole sub will just go to shit. 
---
You can see it on many other game subreddits.  People upvote pictures because there is nothing controversial going on in them. This leaves actual discussion in the dust. 
---
This would be a decent way to use steel, it would give me a reason to look for steel resource nodes instead of junk resource nodes and expand the currently low amount of places I can currently build while I’m trying to make and destroy enough guns to learn attachments.
---
Add to that the coming addition of player vending machines and I might be able to do what I always wanted to in this game and be a gunsmith.  
---
Nope didn’t miss it. But that isn’t my comment or opinion. I don’t believe he should not post anymore, we need more people critical of the game so that Bethesda will get their shit together. 
---
Half a point to a game like Fallout is your building your character overtime you know and your levels are part of your character it's almost like the age of your character.
---
Thank you! Any word on these PC specific options like Vsync and disable motion blur? 🙂
---
Every time I have logged in fpr the last 4 months, I have visited that vendor.
---
Every.Single.Time. 
---
Nothing.
---
Renaming Power Armor and Weapons is coming in a future update.
---
shotguns have 7 pellets and two-shot only add's 1 extra pellet. that is why. 
---
also anti-armor does indeed stack. theres no such thing as 100% armor piercing in this game. its not additive but multiplicative. 
---
Duper? Had to be.
---
Or maybe Bethesda could fix the game and those posts wouldn't be there? :\^)
---
a nice mod, is this like whitelisted? Can I use the mod without having a chance of getting banned by Bethesda?
---
Is it possible your character is suffering an addiction that reduces their strength? That would account for the damage drop...
---
I mean if people want to start a new character they can just do that
---
Thanks a lot... Looking at my HUD I don't see any bounty, so looks like I'm in the clear!
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I'm okay with PvP--I put something like 1000 hours into the original Dark Souls build-crafting and doing PvP--but I was really surprised that a level 89 could just open up on us like that. Maybe a bit *less surprised* than he was when a level 12 almost one-shot him.
---
^_^ 
---
Does adrenaline work with melee weapons?
---
Strictly solo play?
---
The ritual mask is epic. 
---
“Weird flex but alright”
---
Why does it not surprise me that you also speak in memes? 
---
I like rifle games content.  Lots of lore and experimentation.  
---
I get where you’re coming from, but I feel for the most part, this game is what you make it! The group I play with love to grind events and Whitespring, which I also join in on. But then, I see a wanted player, cop uniform on, and I’m off to collect that bounty. 5 cap bounty, 20 cap fast travel? IDGAF, it’s about respecting the law! 
---
I'm 187 currently and stopped caring about levels a long time ago.  I currently have a point pool of around 25.  All the cards I want are where I need them.  So yeah, levelling feels pointless to me now.
---
nope i checked, no addiction or effects
---
That’s definitely true. It would be nice to know if they are adjusting future things based on our ideas now. Cheers! 
---
incisor and anti-armor stack. its anti-armor only giving you 12.5% though because it follows the remainder of incisor. which is why anti-armor is not the best for melee compared to bloodied. 
---
My son has a cultist dagger with faster reload speed. 
---
Please do, i don't mind PvP in workshop area's and sometimes do PvP with friends taking over each others workshops. But majority of the people i know who played fallout 76 are all PvE players who don't want nothing to do with PvP and have since left the game. Maybe once those changes to pacifist mode have been implemented i can talk them into getting back to playing fallout 76 again. 
---
Ah I get it now, yeah it seems PvP is there only really there for aggravation. The premise of rebuilding America can’t happen if everyone’s shooting their neighbors from the past x amount of years.
---
Luck of the Draw helps out a lot when maxed out. I use it on a TS lever action and rarely have to repair it.
---
I accepted a trade invite from a Reddit user,  fast traveled to the WS train station and as we instigated a trade some clown started attacking him , I pulled out of the trade screen he jumped in the air hit me with a rocket sledge and I was done !! One fucking hit!! I was in passive mode,  I did not  instigate a fight , I was going to leave but never got the chance !!! excuse me but that sounds like a one hit kill to me!!! And seriously what arrogance !!! A player disagrees with a comment and he is automatically fabricating a story, right???!!! This discourse is seriously  becoming trollville!!! 
---
Build it as you want, make a blueprint, next time us the blueprint and that’s it. Instant minimalist camp!
---
Also 6 months worth of bugs at least
---
There are some really good unarmed weapons - 
---
I tried the mole miner gauntlet.  IMHO it is effective, but heavy...12#. 
---
War drum is good, slightly lighter than the MMG.  At 90 damage, slightly more than the MMG, plus speed perks and incisor. 
---
Last night I picked up a 1\* guitar sword that deals 89, double damage if the enemy is uninjured.
---
I've been using a L25 death tambo with 79 dmg.  about the same as the MMG, but at 3#, lot lighter.  Also does not need as much repair or as often.
---
Thought that was good until last night, when I found a L35 death tambo that deals 101.  Combined with 2 melee swing speed perks and 2 incisors, I;m really liking that tambo.
---
That said, I'm still mainly working the fringes of the divide and ash heap - fathest NE I've ventured is the munitions factory and red rocket.  Haven't been to Whitesprings in about 10 levels....so for most of what I have been up against, the weapons I cite have served me well.  
---
I am on the very last part of my nuke quest and almost solo launched it but failed at the last step. I'd be happy to give it another go. 
---
I remember when I used to have shotgun that did 900+ damage, now it does 250.  Good times.
---
Wasn't there a bug where your character could have a disease but it wasn't showing in the pipboy?  Try taking a disease cure and see if it fixes it.
---
I think I resent being the person getting inconvenienced by having to server hop. I would prefer the choice of doing pvp or not when I log in to play.
---
I see those plans at the WhiteSprings Station sll of the time.
---
I would go on Twitter, Facebook but I don't really use those so oh well. Cheers bud 🍻
---
Yeah, I've seen offers to sell from time to time and without implying anything negative towards anyone, always assumed they were duped because of the rarity of the drop.  Like I said, I'm the unluckiest drop recipient there ever was but there are people who are super lucky and some don't run the X-01 and this guy could have picked them up for a song and then that good old trade thing kicks in and you get a super deal.  I'm glad you hooked up your friends and had a good game payday to boot.
---
LOL that was never the core intention of this sub. This is about all aspects of the game, both fun and  technical alike.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals though is much more fun driven and avoids any and all topics that involves dramma, since that community was tired of seeing the negativity here (not that most of it wasn't warranted, but still was annoying to come to Reddit and only seeing people bashing the same topic on 8000 posts for days on end)
---
Furthermore. The filthy casuals also help with technical issues and workaround when you ask for help, so this two subs are not mutually exclusive to one of those two trends of posts.
---
This is the only response on using any mods that we've see so far from Bethesda:
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/kw/mod
---
As you can see it says nothing about banning, but it does state "may result in Fallout 76 not functioning properly".  Which, personally, I find quite funny given some of the issues these mods fix.
---
Not a bad idea, just give yourself a quick place to rest and carry on without moving your whole camp. 
---
Limit it’s actual accessibility (just a cooking station, box and sleeping bed... no workbenches or defenses) and it would serve as a decent place to regroup on long expeditions without negating the whole point in moving your camp. 
---
I think I found the plan on a random spawn trick or treater in a witch costume.  I do not recall where it was.  Lately me n GF have been exploring the East/Northeast corner of the map.  Good luck!  It is too bad we are not able to have a double date in Appalachia.
---
I have a junkie-trash build... don't play her much. But she devours every drug she finds, RIGHT NOW, when she finds it, I put almost all her perks into charisma, and she carries a knife.
---
It's a really tough game to play. Pretty much all she does is scour the wasteland looking for her next high... there's not a lot of longevity to the playstyle, but once in a while she's fun to fire up.
---
My main build is in the other "roleplay" thread. He's just "a dude in the wasteland, trying to survive". No meta build, just as "realistic" as possible in the context of this game.
---
I accidentally either sold or scrapped mine, I just have the Rital Bindings! I do that a lot I unfortunately! I need to make my way back to the Mothman Museum to get one! It’s been a while since I visited! 
---
That's "Tanagra Town", over in the Mire.  It's quite funny.  There is a note left on a porch on the top about one of the guys looking forward to peeing off the porch from way up there.
---
There is also a few buildings down at ground level a little ways away.  One has an unpowered keypad and door that we can't open (yet).
---
And a bus-stop that has the graffiti "Darmok + Jalad"......a nice in-joke with the name of the location for sci-fi geeks.
---
Let's rock'n roll. Keep posting before devs Ramone the glitch

Thank you +karma 
---
Agreed, thank you for announcing that, I missed it.
---
You, sir, are a shining example to us all.  I applaud your amazing outlook on the game.
---
Yeah, I shouldn’t say that it’s wrong. It’s not. If you have fun you have fun. But I see so many posts from people saying they beat the SBQ and have unyielding armour and they are asking what to do. I feel like the obvious answer is to take your time and explore and take in the world. It’s what bethesda is best at and I think the fact that this a “online pvp” game, a lot players are missing out on that. 
---
Yeah, it's the foundation I don't like. A tarp would give the "Roll this thing up every night and move on" feel. 
---
These things you mention are exactly the reason why I am preferring open PvP where dick moves are met with consequences.
---
No problem. Just making sure everyone knows
---
Plants are instanced to each player so the person that's been there is you. The silt beans are coming from inside the house!
---
Double check that the little Fallout dude on your Pipboy display isn’t frowning. If he is you have some effect lowering your stats. There have been bugs where effects don’t display under your status / ailments list.
---
I am too but I won't have to deal with those people because they will all go back to pacifist mode to grief.
---
I'd like to add one suggestion:
---
**GIVE ME A PRESSURE CANNER**
---
Something that can preserve foods for long shelf life.

How about real 21:9 support? All menus, all interfaces. And finally solve the fisheye that you still get at FOV settings that are appropriate for 21:9 resolutions.
---
What if it was like ESO? 
---
1. No such thing as slap damage
---
2. Shooting someone would equate to a duel challenge. 
---
3. You’d be prompted to Accept or Decline. Accepting the dual would empower your damage dealing, and of course receiving.
---
4. There could be a 3 second countdown 
---
5. During the duel your property and your person can receive damage. This would mitigate hiding out from the cover of your structure. When not dueling, your property can’t be damaged.
---
6. If the duel was declined, a cooldown would start until the next challenge 
---
Most likely objection: “it would kill the realism to have zero damage to person or property except when dueling.” Okay, and deconstructing gear and leaving the most valuable components behind is realistic? Or getting building material drops from deathclaws? Or weapons from legendary rats?
---
“Too big of a change. Just make Hardcore servers.” Okay, I like that idea. Ignore what I said above.
---
I know but the trend is that. Things changed from the first days of FC
---
My newest character will (hopefully) use the robot companions coming later, it's speculation but could be coming so I'm making a mechanic.
---
I use a pipe wrench as my main weapon and switch to a pipe revolver that's kitted with speed instead of damage. Using robot armor mostly and wearing the mechanics outfit i'll go around and sell junk mostly to vendors but sometimes to other players. 
---
Well, it was walking time from Slocum joes to Flatwoods, and I have Better with Salt perk... plus, no rotted veg.
---
I leave all my donations at Watoga 
---
wow, this is great, thanks for sharing these tips, gonna have to  try them out tonight
---
I loved watching Oxhorns fallout 4 videos! Definitely a cool guy!
---
#shootquicker
---
Added it to the main post :) 
---
Uneven terrain is the problem, but good luck!
---
this happened to me too! ...It is SO STUPID!!! ....all that work i did, wasted! ...what is the point in making a claim, yet again Bethesda does something stupid!
---
Yes I agree to this also. He’s the only one that confirmed some rare outfits that are in the game when I couldn’t find it anywhere on the fallout wikis 
---
ark found a way
---
Because they are both primary effects and you cant have 2 primary effects on the same weapon
---
This sounds really interesting. I'll give this a watch latwr. Thanks!
---
Haha not funny
---
Yep. My missile turret does a great job - even gets mole rats. It still startles me when I hear it go off when I'm inside. Lol. I usually run up to my roof to see if I can get in on the action. But by then, it's usually taken care of things. I just have to try to find the bodies.
---
Last night, I don't know what it was shooting at though - one off shots. I couldn't pick up anything on VATS. But I figured it was doing its job.
---
It is safe.
---
I usually drop some small goodie when i used other players camp.
---
And I wouldn't want other players wpns att all if not given to me.
---
Meh. Pick better terrain... just like you would if you were actually camping. Besides, it would only be of interest to minimalist players anyways, so it's not like they'd be big sprawling camps. Maybe 3-4 items. 
---
If you were in pacifist no, out of passive yes. Out of passive this is how I get ppl to engage pvp. In passive though it wont work BUT it will still hurt you. Maybe that's how you died
---
nice, thnx for the response.
---
What reaction ?  it was a statement not a "reaction" .. LOL I was having a conversation. You act like I was attacking you or something. The way you're are all over my nuts has me Laughing at this point .. 
---
Stop acting like a child. I see you can read but you can't comprehend. "You reiterated what point? That passive mode should be stronger?" Exactly!!!!..Good boy, I do see where you supported it and I never insinuated once that you didn't. 
---
Since I'm not the only one who feels this way, Its good to have the debate. You have somehow turned this into an argument and you have got it all wrong. I Can only laugh at you and your stupidity at this point. Now I am going to leave this conversation .. I am 100% sure you will yet again reply with some idiotic response that makes you feel better for some imaginary argument you started, but hey its the internet so it's expected. Oh by the way ..

We are looking to make changes to Pacifist mode that, when enabled you will not be able to take damage from other players. The plan is for this to also carry over to your C.A.M.P. as well.
---
Conversation is OVER we both will win, I will get a real pacifist mode and Your lovely PVP/PVE servers will be untouched. ... good luck to you and yours. 
---
Me? Yeah, I'm the original Lone Wanderer or as I like to call it; grumpy, yet friendly. old hermit in the hills sort a guy.
---
Il probably get some down votes for it haha but thanks for the kind words! 
---
Yeah the durability is definitely off. I have max INT and gunsmith
---
Buddy you have emotional issues.
---
Right? With how much these toons need to eat and drink i'd image they would need that much tp.
---
I'm 100% saying you're lying. I PVP daily. I'm 167 spec'd for pvp with another guy who's 250+ spec'd for pvp. Their is NO WAY in 4-5 blows you went from 100% life to 50% if you were in passive. The days of bobblehead stacking and tse overpowering are over.
---
Honestly if I tried to have a character where I’m only doing a certain build I’d get anxiety. I’d feel too out of my comfort zone. I play how I want lol. Like some people never step foot in power armor and I cant do that. I have to have every single power armor type. And actually use power armor. Idk if I’m making sense. I just have an odd way of playing but it makes me comfortable and I enjoy it 
---
Thanks guys - copy that on the "build and scrap" to get the mods for handmade. Guess that will give me something to do this afternoon.
---
Yea same, the enclave one clips through a lot, hunters long coat too. The bos underarmor clips through but only the gloves on the manta suit
---
JuiceHead is ok isn’t he? Not for lore or weapons, but for game update and community news.
---
What kind of gear are you using?
---
Griefer.
---
Juice head's videos are very informative, although he does give a clear bias that he dislikes the game
---
It's a survival game. I don't see there being a "win"
---
 to it, other then enjoying the (incredibly silly waste of real world time) wandering and exploring. I don't care if I ever see endgame content.
---
That was me.  Everyday without fail and if the server disconnected me I would get anxiety if I hadn't been to the vendor yet.  I guess when I quit obsessing about them, I found them.  Hang in there!
---
Can we JUST get a drop down selection choice for Normal PvP, FULL PVP, Pacifist, and JUST LORE servers. 
---
Normal PvP: would as it is now with small damage that doesn't build up until you react back. FULL PVP: is no react back just in and KILL!. Pacifist: is NO PVP (also known as the "Builder Server") and LORE: is no PVP, no (maybe) building and no seeing other players (as known as single player). LORE is great for YT video makers but no experience can be gained here.
---
I dunno man. Maybe that's the trend. But even now I saw a post about a guy talking about a mod on nexus regarding scrapping and another whos made a list of some game related stuff (I think it was vendors and modlists or something)
---
So trending or not, the less fun part of the filthy casuals is still as present as the fun part of this sub, so maybe this sub should also allow the posting of screenshots and videos, (hint hint)
---
So wouldn't you say pvp is cross faction??
---
#that failes
---
The Photomode images are saved on your local computer in C:\\Users\\\*username\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76\\Photos\\\*hash.
---
When your loading screen comes up, it grabs a random image from that folder to display.  All someone would have to do is take an inappropriate photo and replace an actual photo in there (and it's thumbnail image); that's what he was referring to by posting non-Photomode images.
---
I did, 400ish is/was the norm, a few specials would go into the 600's but definitely not the norm.  What platform you on, I'll give you 7,500 and call it even since IMO we're both right, if your not on Xbox then I'll drop some gold on ya.  
---
yes please buff this awesome wep that is completely useless in fallout 76 :(
---
no idea why they made it SO WEAK EVEN WITH ALL ONE HANDED PERKS ITS JUST SO TRASH
---
I just blew through 2748 cells last night. Not that I was saving them, but still sucks because I wanted to see what it looked like firing. 
---
Don't you love that the system meant to stop griefers doesn't do a goddamn thing? Typical Bethesda logic at work.
---
Probably, yeah.
---
You are really funny, lol
---
What ever would i gain from making this up ? i am not fresh out of the vault, lv150 on xbox and lv100 on pc, not sure if i can still find the gt after i turned off the xbox last night, but if i can i will provide you with his gt and you can have a go at him, lol :)
---
This was a first for me as well, never seen it before... just a "normal" super sledge and he was in full PA at the time..
---
I think it would be good idea if there was a cap cost to placing it that was something like 200 caps to counteract the caps you would normally need to spend to FT across the map a few times.
---
Turns out they're being extremely predatory with this tactic. At first I thought it was just sales but now it turns out they're permanently discontinuing and/or creating artificial demand for otherwise valueless materials.
---
Either way, my point was this mod team does this everywhere except on r/BethesdaSoftworks
---
Your post is full of holes and misinformation. 
---
* Two shot empowers all stagger/cripple perks as it adds another projectile. Needs no buff. Still the strongest PvP legendary effect to kill Sentinel/Cavalier builds. 
---
* Nocturnal and Beserk both do 50% increased damage and 50% reduced damage depending on time of day or armor value. These need buffs to 75% or 100%
---
* Anti-Armor does stack. Its just melee incisor reduces AA effectiveness to 12.5% since it applies to the remainder. Next is heavy weapons for 2nd least effectiveness with AA because of Stabilized (50%), then Rifles (36%, rifles magazines apply after AA). Handguns and Shotguns get the most bang for your buck because they have 0 anti-armor perks. 
---
* All the other things you talk about are good. 
---
Here is a thread where i talk about the same sort of idea's. 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aoeib9/we\_want\_your\_creature\_feedback\_my\_opinions\_after/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aoeib9/we_want_your_creature_feedback_my_opinions_after/)
---
Here's what i said inside above thread:
---
**^(Additional feedback on balance below:)**
---
^(To add to this creature feedback list id like to include my own list of changes id like to see after playing 675 hours. Its going to be a mass overhaul of the legendary affixes.)
---
**^(Prefix modifier (new):)**
---
* **^(Anti-Armor:)** ^(Ignores 50% of your target's armor.)
---
* **^(Assassin's:)** ***^(+25%)*** ^(damage to players.)
---
* **^(Berserker's:)** ***^(150%)*** ^(Deal more damage the lower your Damage Resistance.)
---
* **^(Bloodied:)** ***^(50%)*** ^(Does more damage the lower your health.)
---
* **^(Double:)** ^(Double ammo capacity (Only found on ranged weapons))
---
* **^(Executioner's:)** ***^(75%)*** ^(more damage when your target is below 40% health.)
---
* **^(Exterminator's:)** ^(Does) ***^(100%)*** ^(more damage against Mirelurks and bugs.)
---
* **^(Furious:)** ***^(75%)*** ^(Damage increased after each consecutive hit on the same target.)
---
* **^(Ghoul Slayer's:)** ^(Does) ***^(100%)*** ^(more damage against Ghouls.)
---
* **^(Hunter's:)** ^(Does) ***^(100%)*** ^(more damage against animals.)
---
* **^(Instigating:)** ^(Does double damage if the target is at full health.)
---
* **^(Junkie's:)** ***^(50%)*** ^(Deal more damage the more chem withdrawal effects you currently have.)
---
* **^(Medic's:)** ^(V.A.T.S. crits will heal you and your group. (Only found on ranged weapons.))
---
* **^(Mutant's:)** ^(Damage increased by) ***^(15%)*** ^(if you are mutated.)
---
* **^(Mutant Slayer's:)** ^(+)***^(100%)*** ^(damage to Super Mutants.)
---
* **^(Nocturnal:)** ^(Does increasing amounts of damage as the night grows longer, but less damage during the day.)
---
* **^(Quad:)** ^(Quadruple ammo capacity (Only found on ranged weapons))
---
* **^(Stalker's:)** ^(If not in combat, +100% V.A.T.S. accuracy at +50% AP cost.)
---
* **^(Suppressor's:)** ^(Reduce your target's damage output by 20% for 3 seconds.)
---
* **^(Troubleshooter's:)** ^(+)***^(100)***^(% damage to robots)
---
* **^(Two Shot:)** ^(Shoots an additional projectile at 25% base effect. (Only found on ranged weapons))
---
* **^(Vampire's:)** ^(Gain brief health regeneration when you hit an enemy.)
---
* **^(Zealot's: +100)**^(% damage to Scorched)
---
**^(Here's my explanation for the following changes.)**
---
* ^(We need to have more balance when it comes to which is best in which scenario. Currently nobody uses enemy specific weapons, which is why im boosting the damage from 30% to 100%. Now you may need to swap your weapon depending what enemy you fight.)
---
* **^(Bloodied)** ^(is way to strong, needs a nerf in my opinion. Its to easy when paired with Adrenaline Reaction.)
---
* **^(Furious)** ^(needs a buff to make it worth the "wind up". Can still be 5% increments up to 75% total damage.)
---
* **^(Executioner)** ^(should be SCARY once you hit that threshold.)
---
* **^(Beserker)**^(, if your walking around ARMOR LESS, let that player do 150% more damage. They are a true glass cannon.)
---
* **^(Assassin)** ^(buff is to make it compare-able to bloodied or anti armor but not just be "Free damage".)
---
Basically some nerfs and buffs where they are needed. 
---
Definitely not odd! The whole point of the game is to have fun and be/do what you want! IMO there is no right or wrong way to play! Be who you wanna be in Appalachia! I’d rather be out there, than stuck in that damn vault forever!
---
The queen scales health the more players in the area. You’re hurting more that you’re helping by buffing the queen. You should wait until you’re at least 60 to try again buddy.
---
Whitesprings is fair game to most levels though, it’s a great place to level up and potentially get some sweet gear for your end game build! 
---
Thanks for being helpful, but trust me and stay away from the SBQ until you’re a little stronger
---
There is no singular win as in an end-game per se, but many small victories along the path of exploration.  Im excited to see all of the new content, there is plenty planned on their road map.  I do wish there were some more interesting faction affiliations in the game, that could make things interesting too.  I bet that is part of the long-term plan.  It would be cool if we could affiliate with the brotherhood, raiders, or other factions, which would help determine our responses to other NPC's in the game.  
---
Reading out the patch notes isn't news.
---
If you want to claim a Work Shop you are gonna have to enter the PVP world .. that's the risk you are taking in order to have a workshop.  If you don't want to PVP  don't claim one.  Pretty sure anything in the Work Shops you can find else where ? Might be more time consuming but then again that would be the advantage of taking one and then defending it. IMO this is how it should have always been 
---
"We are looking to make changes to Pacifist mode that, when enabled you will not be able to take damage from other players. The plan is for this to also carry over to your C.A.M.P. as well. " 
---
Bout time... Please let this happen soon.....
---
What are you even talking about. How does player vending relate to PvP in the slightest?
---
I do too but had no luck so far.But a guy posted a post just like yours some time ago,that's why i'm starting to think it works like that.
---
I've dabbled in pacifism myself. Not in 'nam of course. 
---
"Vault 76 is one of our seventeen control Vaults. It will operate exactly according to the plan dictated in the marketing material produced by Vault-Tec and precisely to resident expectations. This vault will open automatically after a period of 20 years and the residents will be pushed back into the open world for study in comparison to the other experiments." 
---
So it was revealed conversationally and not exactly....
---
Bethesda own the lore so they get to do with it what they want, if it makes you angry when they change it I would suggest getting a sense of perspective and not to tie your own self worth to a video game story.
---
And the mods on a lot of other gaming subs do it too is my point. So we shouldn’t be entirely surprised. But I’m all for one day where it’s allowed. 
---
I wish the atomic shop clocks would keep track of the time of day. Then I’d know when certain night perks/weapons activate. As it is I don’t use any of them. But if I have a clock other than the pipboy I might!
---
wanted to post as just a heads up.    so i made another character and "SOME" of the old challenges i did on the new character would get credit and count as being completed.   i managed to get the The Forest Locales done finally.   but the mire and cranberry bog still didn't work for me.     also managed to get the "Max out a perk card" one done finally too on the ALT Char.
---
While the energy weapons changes are intriguing, I don't use them now and don't see myslef using them in the future.  That being said to me the most interesting update to me is to the Challenge tracking update.  I can see a lot more Atom Cash coming my way with this one :).
---
People also dont get that being in pacifist doesnt mean you take 0 damage, so they go into circumstances that initiate pvp and call it going through slap damage 
---
He killed me for sure that's all I know.  I got the get revenge option.  Plus he likes to harass.  On my main I told him to knock it off as I was in pacifist and he was irritating me.  He said good.  I'm glad
---
Those masks look cool 
---
I found enemies are drawn to crops/power sources
---
a friend of mine has a camp with no crops or power and has never been attacked by enemy mobs
---
It looks like it shoots flame balls, so I suppose. I havent used it on a mob. Only on the SQ once.
---
I don't know if 'oversight' is the right word, exactly? I think Bethesda deliberately crafted your available responses at that point so no matter what you chose, there would be enough ambiguity so that DiMA would get to do his little "gotcha!" moment.
---
Doesn't work! I reapplied adrenal reaction and it just does not show up on my list of mutations at all!
---
Text?
---
This is the kind of build I love to encounter in the world. Players that pick a "career" or "lifestyle" and stick with it as much as possible.
---
Turrets And lights
---
This is the most balanced way to do it. If you have been in PvP, wanted, or in a workshop boundaries in the last 5 min, then you can't turn off pacifist. This might seem like a lot of time, but it really isn't that bad. I don't world PvP in WoW much, but have done plenty of PvP dailies, and the 5 min timer isn't a big deal once you are out of the area.
---
Same. I avoid whitesprings at all costs because some douchebag will slap damage me to death everytime. I just need the golfballs, damnit! 
---
True she might have. 
---
Weird. Maybe a bit different if I'm on PC? I'll go through all the Whitespring vendors again later tonight and follow up if I see it at anyone of them
---
"Twitch"
---
I roleplay as a character that is forever over-encumbered and constantly messing with his inventory to try to get light enough to run
---
There really isn’t any honest YouTube person in regards to fallout 76 because they’ve all shamed it and talked shit for likes and views at one point or another, and change their tone to remain relevant.

INSIDE THE VAULT: FASNACHT SEASONAL EVENT AND PATCH 7 PREVIEW
---
Welcome back to Inside the Vault! As Wild Appalachia draws nearer, we’re traveling to the town of Helvetia to preview the first seasonal event in Fallout 76, which will be sure to shoo away those winter blues: Fasnacht Parade! Next, we’re going to share a few highlights with you from Patch 7, which we’re planning to release next week.
---
NEW SEASONAL EVENT – FASNACHT PARADE
---
Each year, since the founding of Helvetia in 1869, the townsfolk celebrated Fasnacht by donning fantastic masks and parading through the decorated town. The festivities culminated by burning an effigy of Old Man Winter on the bonfire to signal the end of winter. The townsfolk may be long gone, but dutiful bots have kept the party rolling every year—and they welcome your participation!
---
Fasnacht Parade is a repeatable, limited-time event quest that will be available for one week, starting on March 19. You and any other dwellers who wish to take part must speak with the Master of Ceremonies in Helvetia and then divide and conquer to find and aid the town’s robotic shopkeepers in setting up for the annual parade. You and your compatriots will be asked to assist with a variety of party prep duties that may have you stepping on stage to play a cheery tune, choosing the perfect decorations, or exterminating some buzzing pests, among many other activities.
---
If you find and aid the Protectrons quickly enough, they will be able to march in the parade. Be sure to remain vigilant! Times have changed since the pre-war days, and all that commotion is sure to attract some party crashers. Defend your marchers as they traipse around town, and then set Old Man Winter ablaze to banish the biting cold, earn some sweet loot, and even claim a festive Fasnacht mask of your very own. The more marchers who survive the parade, the higher the chance you’ll earn a mask, some of which are exceedingly rare. Here’s a look at just a few that you can get by completing this event. There are many more, and masks can be traded, so put your Charisma to the test by haggling with any Dwellers who have a mask that catches your eye.
---
Remember—No party lasts forever, and neither does this seasonal event quest. Complete Fasnacht Parade as many times as you like, grab as many masks as you can, and score new Fasnacht-themed C.A.M.P. plans before the celebration ends on March 26.

PATCH 7 HIGHLIGHTS
---
We’re gearing up to release Patch 7 next week, and it contains the first wave of Wild Appalachia game content—including the new Brewing and Distilling crafting system and quests we [previewed last week](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1vtgqSxLlbipZyHOA19tT5/inside-the-vault-wild-appalachia-preview-brewing-and-distilling)—as well as balance and design changes, and a ton of bug fixes. Full patch notes will be available on patch day, but here are a few highlights we’re excited to share with you:
---
Energy and Heavy Weapon Balance: In Patch 7, we’re making some adjustments to greatly increase the durability of many energy and heavy weapons and increasing their damage so you can take down enemies more easily, spend less time repairing, and more time looting. Here are the details:
---
Energy Weapons
---
For heavy and semi-auto energy weapons, we’ve greatly reduced the amount of condition damage they take per shot. Your heavy energy weapons should now last four to five times longer, and semi-auto energy weapons should last twice as long before needing repairs.
---
We’ve also given semi-auto energy weapons an additional damage boost of +10% so they have a little more bite.
---
Heavy Weapons
---
We’ve reduced the fire-rate for high rate-of-fire automatic heavy weapons across the board and increased their damage by +10%. Adjusting these weapons’ fire-rates gave us more room for a damage increase, which will help them punch through armor more effectively without increasing their baseline damage per second too high.
---
Weapon damage for all other automatic heavy weapons has been increased by 10% to 20%.
---
Like energy weapons above, we’ve significantly reduced the condition damage that automatic ballistic heavy weapons take per shot, and they should now last about four times longer before they need to visit a weapons workbench.
---
We know that many of you have also been asking for weight changes for heavy weapons. While we haven’t addressed this in Patch 7, we do plan to make improvements with a future update and we will let you know as soon as we have more details to share.
---
C.A.M.P. and Workshop Budget Adjustments: In Patch 7, we’re planning to make adjustments to the C.A.M.P. and Workshop budget system that should allow you to build even bigger and fancier Wasteland abodes.
---
The amount of budget space that some buildable objects consume, such as Turrets and Lights, has been reduced, but they now also have a maximum amount that can be placed in your C.A.M.P. or Workshop. The build menu recipes for these objects will show you how many are already present in your C.A.M.P., including the ones you have stored, and the total amount of each you can place.
---
There are several important aspects of C.A.M.P. and Workshop budgets we must keep in mind when making adjustments, including how objects are used by players, overall structure balance, and even game performance. While the above changes aren’t a direct increase to budget size, they should give you more overall budget space to build lots of cool stuff, while also allowing us the flexibility to further refine and improve balance and performance.
---
C.A.M.P. Placement Adjustments: Occasionally, when we bring new content to the game, it may need to be placed somewhere that was previously usable as a C.A.M.P. location. We can't have C.A.M.P.s and quests occupying the same space and while we do our best to limit these cases, sometimes it’s unavoidable.
---
Starting with Patch 7, and in future updates, we plan to add a few new “no-build zones” to the game world that will prevent players from constructing C.A.M.P.s in those areas.
---
However, it’s possible some players may have already built in these locations before they became no-build zones. When this happens, affected players will be notified upon joining a world that their C.A.M.P.s can no longer be placed, and they will be given a free C.A.M.P. placement as a result. We don’t expect this will impact most players, but we hope this free move will help you find a new home for your home.
---
Challenge Tracking: With Patch 7, we want to make challenges easier to keep an eye on as you make progress toward completing them, so you always know when that next reward will be on its way into your pocket.
---
We’re adding a new challenge tracking interface to the Map, which you can use to quickly access the challenges menu whenever you’d like.
---
As you scroll through your available challenges, you can now select and add them to the tracker, which will update as you make progress toward completing each one.
---
Additionally, you will also receive a notification in-game whenever you make progress toward one of the challenges you’ve added to the tracker.
---
We’ll see you again next week as we cover even more of the new game content we have in store for you in Wild Appalachia. Until then, we’ll see you in the Wasteland!
---
Yeah that’s definitely true! I sometimes feel like I don’t do enough damage like the bloodied builds lol but I don’t want to be 1 hit away from dying either 
---
I'm not saying its perfect but take it for what it is. If I want to go play barbie in ponsonbys without getting killed for minding my business it works. GTA passive isn't meant to for killing NPCs and all of that other stuff. It's meant to make you untouchable without allowing you to cause damage. 
---
That's a hell of a stretch for a joke. "Twitch skills" has meant "quick response in games" for longer than the streaming site has been around.
---
Found the brown one there today. Still looking for blue and pink
---
Theyve already said that characters can go back and forth between.
---
Which is some hot garbage to tell the truth.

We can't have C.A.M.P.s and quests occupying the same space and while we do our best to limit these cases, sometimes it’s unavoidable.
---
Challenge Tracking: With Patch 7, we want to make challenges easier to keep an eye on as you make progress toward completing them, so you always know when that next reward will be on its way into your pocket.
---
I don't sit around circle jerking at other people's thoughts on games though.  I normally base my purchases around what I see with my own eyes, be it through E3, Pax, Gamescom, blizzcon (i pre-ordered warcraft 3 remaster right when i saw it) or through playing alpha/betas.
---
I dont need to sit around on reddit saying "uh dur this personz said game is bayd, Im not buying it cause of dat durrrrr!".  Come on bro.  Think for yourself for a change.
---
I like this idea.  Attachable to a combat helmet so they act like the NVGs that we see in our military soldiers IRL. They could be NVG, Recon, magnifying or any combination of those attributes.  That would make a lot more folks interested in wearing the combat helmet. And of course the Legendary versions that would add Perception and enhanced VATS targeting.
---
I've gotten adrenal reaction to reappear after getting it as a natural mutation. But then as I was trying to get marsupial I got empath, so had to erase everything and start over. Got adrenal reaction again, and bought marsupial. 
---
Logged in this morning and no adrenal reaction! At all! Anywhere!
---
Bought a serum from someone, and I get the serum's suppressed effect but not the mutation itself!
---
I see this guy maybe every other day I play but this could just be me being lucky.  I'm camped on his route, but that's only paid off a few times.  Usually I see him when I'm walking down the major roads.  I try to avoid fast traveling in general, and mostly navigate using roads on the map, and I think that has a lot to do with it.  I've also had good luck seeing him when I'm camped out at the Lakeside Cabins workshop.
---
It sounds like you're being baited. Someone in your friends list must know this person and that's how hes following you. Its happened to me before since I pvp a alot. They were friends with a trader I know and followed the trader into games to find me.
---
Actually thought this would have been a feature when the game first launched. Muffled voices for bandanas or masks, radio voices for distance team calls and power armour.
---
I think arma has that feature or some other that is similar enough. This would be cool to have here.
---
Do you have marsupial? Will pay 200 and a moderate number of Ammo of your choice, and if I don’t have it, I will pay normal price
---
as in what system i play on? ps4
---
tried an adictol and disease cure but no difference :'(
---
Unless this was a PC hack that's new. Its BS. Again I personally attack everyone daily. I'm an asshole by trade in fallout so yes I'm calling this BS.
---
5 damage per second is the cap. For most players it will take close to a minute of continual damage to kill them if at full health.
---
Survival is all ready super easy we don't need even  easier access to our boxes
---
Energy gun and heavy weapon buff! YEEESSSS!
---
Also, challenge tracker!? Alright!!
---
I am aware of that.
---
This is extremely predatory. Like if on occasion the stuff that they discontinued came back every once in awhile it wouldn't be an issue but from the looks of it there permanently discontinuing said things, and this is an extremely unfair marketing tactic, basically forcing you to use all your atoms as soon as possible by bombarding you with all these "deals" giving you no time to earn more atoms they're for forcing you to buy atoms if you want to get every single thing on sale. This is incredibly infuriating if the stuff they are putting on sale is permanently discontinued and not on hiatus, at least if it were on a hiatus I could understand the scarcity rather than permanently removing something from a shop. They haven't even fix the vault-tec weapons work bench yet, imagine if they put that thing on clearance before discontinuing and I think doesn't even fucking work properly.
---
Ah, I was going to say that there are groups of people that would totally mod your stuff for ya. I do armor and weapons and I'm currently in the process of trying to purchase all the T-60 plans first. I generally only charge the materials it costs to make whatever but donations are always welcome 
---
WOOT!  Energy weapons getting love and durability!!!!  I can finally whip out my legacy exploding laser rifle!!!
---
Personally, I feel that making an area level (more or less) and/or removing obstacles like trees, car wrecks, guardrails, rocks, even entire buildings, etc should involve more work than just a click of a button. To quote president John Henry Eden from Fallout 3: "Restoring the greatest country in the world to its former glory, well, well, heh, heh... Well, that takes time, even for the Enclave."
---
I'm not sure how this could be best accomplished though... shovels, pickaxes and hatchets are already in the game - so why not put them to use as they were intended? There could be a lengthy quest to find, repair and reprogram a construction protectron. 
---
Also, let us plant trees and patches of grass to cover the soil. Grass could grow over time and could require to be cut back with a lawnmower occasionally. Or just let us cover the area with concrete...
---
This is what I had originally expected when I heard the phrase "rebuilding America" repeated to often...
---
I'm sure that for many players finding their perfect spot to build an awesome base is their personal endgame instead of min/maxing their damage output or fight other players in PVP.
---
Nice that the game has been fixed to the point we can complain about insignificant details like this. Wait...
---
Yep. I can barely use the tools to arrange a trade with another player.
---
Anyone try to put a C.A.M.P. up there?  Not sure if that a buildable site or not
---
Yeah,  I think you have to have a Cool down system.  Like a 10 minute timer hahah.. You take a work shop. You now are flagged for PVP. You set up your resource collector and then the "raiders" come. You need to decide to stand or fight, if you fight and are killed you can decide to keep fighting or you can run ... if you run, you have to wait out the timer before you can toggle passive again.  
---
You don't plan bugs in advance...
---
Why shouldn't I be able to take an unclaimed workshop? You're free to take it from me.
---
It's a hoax, I went there after this post and found nothing but napkins, honestly what a waste of time.
---
How can you possibly know this.
---
I'm kind of guessing here that certain parts of whitesprings "cough" golf club "cough" will become no build zones
---
No, your armor. What are the effects of your armor on your stats? Are you using Unyeilding, Bolstering or have you recently started to use power armor?
---
For Crafting QoL - 
---
Keeping track of what mods are still available for unlock for which weapons/armor, as well as how to obtain said mods (vendor only, scrapping, etc) is a real pain. 
---
I would love to have the option to see all available mods for items so I know how many I have left without keeping a friggin excel spreadsheet open while I play. If you don’t want to “spoil” what weapon mods there are then perhaps it can be a “show mods” setting you can toggle on or off, with default being off. 
---
Patch notes with positive changes? I believe I might get a little excited for this one. 
---
I do know it's  "only game" but this sure made this a crap day for me :( :( 
---
invested 170+ hours, level 66 to end up with crappy weapons :(
---
for example a berserker hardened combat shogun, level 50 that deals 100 damage.
---
(using bloody mess , scattershot, enforcer, shotgunner 20%, master shotgunner 10%) etc :(
---
thanks for those who tried to help. \*sigh\*
---
Pushing me out of my house? I get out of my house a lot in real life, so I don't have endless hours to devote making an awesome PVP build for my Fallout character.
---
After a day of dealing with people in real life, I like to log in and tune out. I'll build a cool-looking camp, complete a quest or two, kill some super mutants and ghouls, explore the map, and so on. I like keeping to myself after a day of dealing with real-life people. It's a great way to relax and unwind. When I pass others I'll wave hello or give a thumb's up, and give help if needed. (Although once I was looking at my keyboard to wave back to someone waving at me, and his friend attacked me from behind.)
---
I respect that you want to do PVP, and have no interest in it being stopped. It's too bad many PVPers aren't willing to afford non-PVP players the same option.
---
nope looks normal
---
The problem is you need to be in an area with relevant PvE. 
---
So, are we just all pretending that Adrenal Reaction ISNT broken? Also, I've still got a character with PERMANENT 'caution' status, so his Health Regen doesnt work anymore.
---
I can't be the only one. 
---
Times?  
---
 I’d be interested but I’d need to know what time and I will need to check if I’m working that day I don’t know 
---
They already gave you an option to avoid them, block them, hop servers.  
---
I actually don't feel screws are a problem at all in this game.
---
*(It may or may not be affected by the fact that I don't play Fallout 76 anymore.)*
---
Yep, I've tried second character, but was able to do only 1 challenge - mire and cranberry still bugged.
---
Imagine this thing with durability:
---

---
Being a pacifist in a post apocalyptic world is bullshit. 
---
Yeah , Agree ... they should never have been able to set up so close to white springs .. is should be red when they set camp. I would hope they resolved this at the same time. 
---
I know
---
Odd that you all are having issues.  My LA is the gun i have to repair the least.  And I use it the most.  
---
Essentially more camp space. This is great!
---
All good news to me! 
---
They spend the last 6 months fixing bugs with No time for vending machines
---
That's a game-changer right there
---
Can't remember what the other effect was on mine, it's 2 or 3*.  But I'm going to be whipping it out next week!!  WOOOT!
---
I feel like they could pretty easily digitally sign photos when they're generated by the game to prevent that issue.
---
They're making no build zones for quest stuff now, so I guess Whitesprings is safe for now, as Fasnacht parade is in Helvetia.
---
I wondered if that was the case, I may just be being greedy lol, I have found one plant that plays by its own rules though, I walk past it when I’m going somewhere from my camp, there was 3 days where it produced nothing but then yesterday morning it had a bean which I grabbed on my travels and then had to fast travel back to camp an hour later, when I set out again it had grown another bean so nothing in 3 days then two harvests in an hour?? It might just be an anomaly but il have to start paying more attention to the times I pick the flatwoods ones and see when it’s worth spending caps to fast travel there and when I need to hang on a bit longer
---
I've had someone try to slap-kill me during a queen fight. I was level 23 (2nd character) and they were 300-something. I blocked them, but leaving the server means no reward.
---
I noticed I get that occasionally.. was wondering what that was..
---
I don’t believe the crit gets wasted. At least that’s what I have read. If you miss your crit shot you crit bar stays full.
---
Some good improvement how about increasing back some of the legendary weapons they buffed into nothing. I d say + 50% for 2 shot and + 50% for explosive is about the right balance. 
---
Also the need to fix what is going on with some of these weapon, the damage seems to change every time I long in normally swinging up and down by about 20-40% damage. Some days my weapons are more powerful than other days.
---
I had the same exact issue at least 3 times in the last 2 weeks. 
---
For some reasons, my weapons, and I mean all of them, where showing at least 50-60% less damage. I noticed it yesterday again on a furious lvl 15 laser rifle that I looted on a legendary low level mirelurk. It was showing a DMG of 7. Today I logged it again and it shows proper dmg, like 40ish don't remember exactly.
---
I don't know if it was just a visual bug. Logging out seems to fix the issue for me.
---
Oh, and what I know for sure is that I had no diseases/addictions/broken arms/weird cards/etc, I went crazy looking for something that was causing this, but my pip boy wasn't showing any weird effect.
---
On the other side, 4-5 days ago, I noticed my weapons were doing a good +25%damage. All of them. I had no explanation for that. It stayed like that for a few hours, then I logged out and in. Everything went back to normal.
---
In conclusion, I think something is wrong with mutations. These problems started after-patch when adrenal reaction got bugged. 
---
Finally I can use my two shot LMG!
---
Workshops are specifically **PvP** zones. I don't believe "PvE only" players, or griefers, should be rewarded for playing outside the games intent.
---
There need to be higher penalties for people abusing PvP mechanics, and less benefits for someone who purposely avoids them altogether.
---
As far as I know, it works on all the cargobots that aren't tied into quests like collision course.
---
The Adrenal Reaction bug has been around for weeks, it breaks half my characters, and NO ONE is talking about it anymore?
---
They are important.  They're showing the game failed.  If players are quitting then the game is failing in some regard.  It's important to realize why.
---
Agreed lol
---
Most of the stuff on sale is definitely shit I could do without. The little banner on the main menu says the things that are going on sale are heading to the vault once the sale ends. I don't know if that means they're going away permanently or not, but the price of the items is definitely more than fair. If you're like me then you probably never spend any time in the atomic shop so you have a bunch of atoms saved up.
---
 It's also an incentive for people to complete daily and weekly challenges since they do give out atoms for free. 
---
Specifically to irritate raiders going after me for loot
---
I don't know how many times this needs to be said.. Say it with me now, the Inside The Vault newsletter is not a comprehensive patch note, those happen the day of the update.
---
I'd like to buy a few. Three at the moment, and will be in the market for more at a later date.
---
PSN - chakra_bender 
---
cool, you're fun. What if you're a melee build? run and swing faster? Thanks for the tip B R O
---
Don't try to justify trolling/grieving. running around screwing with uncombative people in (any) game is childish and a sign of being a loser
---
Play a other game 
---
I mean, I used to play every day but that's kind of not the case anymore so I don't earn atoms as fast as I used to but you're right most of the time things aren't really worth buying, the only things I've bought were the vault-tec themed objects, cleaned purifier, modern door, and like the nuka cola quantum light.
---
Your writing style is like the ghetto version of train spotting.
---
You’re welcome to add us on Xbox and we can all play together. It’d be nice to play with another girl. 
---
Any Fusion cores? Or high level power armor mods? My PSN Is erickj75
---
Hey I went back and found the printer you were talking about!  All it does is print out the keyword that pops up in the bunker when it is complete on the board and can be kept in your inventory.  It has no other instructions or how to solve the launch code.  It also expires and disappears from the inventory the same time the codes reset.
---
How about a perk to reduce rifle weight?  My sniper has two rifles that weigh a combined total of 45-50lbs.  His max carry weight is 180.  About 25% of my carry weight is taken up by two rifles alone.
---
No build zones will take care of whitesprings golf course XP farms.  Nice.
---
I wonder what other areas they are going to label as no build zones.
---
I am also surprised at the weapon buffs. Automatic heavy weapons have 10%-20% Dmg increase with 4-5x durability too? Damn that’s awesome.
---
Yeah being a introvert who doesn't talk much it's kinda hard to talk with players I don't know. I'm trying to be more forward with people I come across.
---
Out of curiosity, a lot of things the players hate you said have "been noted" or "passed onto the team" in many threads, when can we expect these changes to be implemented into the game? 
---
More personally, when will the energy weapons re-balance come into effect? I've been off of 76 for 2 months now but if energy weapons become usable that's all it will take for me to come back.
---
Sure, but not one mention of it, it's a pretty game breaking bug, and I haven't heard anyone on this sub even mention it, lately. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. And when I bring it up, I get ignored or down voted.
---
Hasn't been mentioned in the last 2 Inside the Vaults, and it's not part of the master list of bugs and glitches post that went up a month ago.
---
I had a level 43 guy attack my teammate and I after we killed the sbq. Appeared he was hoping we would donate some flux. I was kind of surprised how fast my health was going down but like you said, I would have to just stand there and let him kill me.
---
Energy weapons durability buff! Excellent news!
---
Time to take that Gatling Plasma out of my stash box at last! I just hope they fix Adrenal Reaction as well.
---
Honestly, hope we don't have to have multiple machines to sell stuff.  Just one with all item types.
---
Hopefully the meant whitesprings, I know they forsure meant near helvetia, but hopefully there too since they know its a common complaint. And yea, they also did the buff in a way thats not OP, they reduced the fire rate a little
---
Good stuff, weapon-wise, but... I'm wary of the proposed light cap, since I use a fair number of lights throughout my camp. I guess I'll have to see how it actually plays out. I'm also wary of the non-build zones, since my main's camp is quite a ways up from most typical sites.
---
That's an asset copied over from Fallout 4. Nothing really to it in Fallout 4 so I don't think there's really anything to it in 76... other than decoration/environment building type stuff.
---
Solo player as well. Definitely focus on your build and mold it towards one type of play style. I made this mistake and when I got about halfway through the story, I was having extreme difficulty with some of the quests (Especially in the higher level areas like Cranberry Bog and the Mire). Almost felt like you had to have friends to get through the quests easily. I relied on meeting up with random players to get through some of the harder quests. Eventually I tailored towards a melee build which I still use. 
---
Why on earth would someone make a comment about a game on a subreddit about the game itself? Ass
---
Are the turrets any better or is this ultimately a defense nerf?
---
You don't even have to grind for upper tier equipment if you understand the game mechanics around PvP.
---
I still have crap leather armor pieces, and mid range guns and am able to more than hold my own in PvP.
---
Save crits, stock up on med-x and psycho buffs, make pumkin grenades, don't keep charging back if you die.
---
The worst is when you spawn stuck in the foundation with a bunch of enemies also spawning into the foundations attacking that then proceed to destroy everything inside of your home whilst you can’t move or fast travel. Lol
---
Fast Travel Mats would be very welcome in C.A.M.P. As would not allowing anyone or anything to spawn stuck inside of foundations and not allowing enemies to spawn within your building. 
---
Ok I will add you and get with you when I get home I am currently at work.
---
The cap encourages trading, and keeps the economy accessable to newer players. They could raise it, but inside of a week it would be back to trades only anyway. 
---
You sound like a fair and generous player/vendor sort. I can mod most of my own armor and I have all the plans and mods for most of the PA out there, and unless I'm sadly mistaken, the X-01 plans cannot be "found" anywhere, only available through quest and the mods are only sold through the Enclave vendor and the inventory is random with only 2-4 items (that"s all I've ever seen).  
---
I just wish more people would tag their posts so the filters would work well enough
---
Thank you 
---
Just because a percentage of people on Reddit, which is only a small percentage of all players, quit doesn't mean the game failed. Again, the people who think the fact that they quit matters are just self-absorbed.
---
A lot of people are just taking a break until there's new content because they did all that stuff that was available at launch. That does not mean the game failed.
---
You'll know if it failed if/when the servers shut down.
---
I'd like the ability to find tapes in game we can add to our Jukeboxes.  While I like the classical music mine plays, I would like to be able to have it randomize music
---
I lol’d at this. :)
---
I tried to post a pic of the perfectly preserved pie I won yesterday, but "TeXt PoStS oNlY"
---
What time and time zone? I’d be in if I’m free
---
Downvotes? Really? My comment is more relevant than "Energy weapons! Woot!"
---
I agree. Block and change servers if you are being greifed and don't want to fight back. But this is Fallout, humans kill humans. It's your job to leave if you can't or don't want to fight back. And no being from the same vault doesn't make every one friends, there are many, many vaults in the wasteland that can attest to that fact.
---
I wandered all over on that side of the map. No enemies, but there are some safes to be opened. Also a shipwreck with over-sized Nuka-Colas.
---
We still need a fix to anti armor and other perks that reduce resistance. None of them effect energy resistance so energy weapons are still gimped!!!
---
That energy weapon buff alone is gonna get me back into 76.
---
yep!
---
great job!
---
I thought of that, although I'm guessing that many people wouldn't go through the trouble, and consoles would be left out.
---
Why does it not surprise me that you avoided my points and tried a vague insult instead?
---
Jk. It didn't surprise me.
---
I think their should be some indication both on the map and while viewing another player if they are in PvP or Pacifist mode, as well as our own Icon in the HUD (Lower right with everything else).
---
As it stands now, a player in pacifist mode can harass (Damage but not destroy) your CAMP, which will not allow you to retaliate, but their buddies can Hide nearby waiting for you to switch to PvP mode and then kill you before you can even get back out of the cumbersome menu.
---
There should at the very least be a way to toggle PvP/Pacifist mode quickly in the PIP Boy menu.
---
Before someone tries to educate me on how PvP works, I fully understand the mechanics, and certainly know how to Revenge, but most of the A$$hats initiating PVP (Griefing) are teamed up with other players, and exploiting the mechanics to their advantage, so killing them very seldom rewards the caps it should, or gets your junk back, since a buddy most likely took it &amp; bounced away, not to mention their other friend waiting to snipe you for more caps when your spawn back in again.
---
The only way I have found to effectively combat Griefing &amp; the sorry PvP mechanics of the game are to play with other team mates regularly (safety in numbers) as most griefers don't have the intestinal fortitude (Guts) to face anyone on even ground.
---
I’d love the elevator so I wouldn’t have to lock my doors to keep the mole rats from eating my couch
---
But the game doesn't. You can side load in whatever you want for custom loading screens right now.
---
TRDL .The entire game
---
This awesome considering I got a TSE minigun from a bloated glowing one last night!
---
It does not
---
Duuuude thank you!
---
Yes. See here.

---
If someone jumps on the mic and says “hey” I’ll immediately pick up my mic and start a diologue... I only say this to further ease you into being more open. Nice things can happen! ;)
---
Yeah I can understand that. If you feel you can try it at some point you should ^_^ 
---
So only semi auto energy weapons are fixed? Or did I read that wrong? I thought auto energy weapons had it just as bad. My auto laser rifle breaks in like 3 reloads still.
---
Perfect. Thanks. 
---
As others said, block them. This is what I do: they kill me (with pacifist on! ) and I die. I lay there, I Don't respawn immediately. I lay there a while as I search for their name and block them. this freaks them out a bit for one thing lol. Then once blocked, I just leave the server. 
---
All energy weapons, each just has different buffs, auto had a diff buff that was mentioned
---
I have Sun Kissed on one character - does that not drop your rads so fast that you often stay under the 20?
---
Or are you not running Nerd Rage / etc.? Or has it really not been a huge problem for you?
---
People stopped mentioning the Adrenal Reaction bug because it's just a visual bug. It still works even though the positive effect doesn't show up on your status screen. As for getting stuck in CAUTION, that's been a thing for awhile. Usually a fast travel or server hop corrects it, but if your permanently stuck like that you should open a support ticket with Bethesda. That is something not effecting everyone.
---
Such is your opinion but they added pvp features for a reason. People want to pvp. People like to fight other people. Just because you dont want too doesnt mean other wont. Survival of the fittest has been a universal constant through out history. This is the wasteland only the strong will survive. And guess what theirs a passive mode gasps!! Yes that's right put in passive and if someone tries to grief you leave. 
---
You’re only lvl 66 of 170 hours of play time?
---
Bethesda did reply, see above. And I agree, they often roam in packs, so when they kill me, I take my time to block them all before I server hop
---
Exactly. It is super easy to do. The requirements for format are pretty simple (correct size, png file, plus thumbnail).
---
That's... That's a griefer and you blocked them?
---
I love the game but it's buggy AF sometimes. Sounds like the graphics bugged and went weird. What did they do to grief you though?
---
Good stuff. I do hope the event is not another chore quest though.
---
With all the Perk swaps ... you’re on PC right? Not a console? Or do you do the full menu to swap?
---
No stashbox
---
but yes to a bedroll and cooking stove
---
I have been using power armor for most of the time since a couple of weeks. for the rest my armor is rather crappy.  1 star effect (chameleon, less weight, stuff like that)
---
You mean if I just go straight to the cave and run to the back and find the person that I’ll finish the quest even if I don’t do the transponders again?
---
It was actually done to increase the building budget.
---
Where? They only seem to specify semi auto.
---
I’m all about the “witch doctor” build atm lol, obviously green thumb, butchers bounty, and super duper are essential 😂 I’ve found the perfect outfit too....
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/wrpWj6r
---
Yes, you are.
---
I don’t think it’s too nutty.  I believe they do like to torture peeps but that doesn’t mean they’ll stick around and keep doing it forever.  It has to get a little boring after a while.  Not to mention the survival mode has a lot more rewards and those guys tend to also like to make caps so legendary items are probably going to be more plentiful and better.  It’s gonna be interesting to see what happens.  
---
If an exploding car can take you out or harm you, I advise either staying away from WS or getting up high and blowing them up before you get near them. I blow up cars at WS no matter who's around, it's just a thing I do. I assume that people around WS know that cars explode. I explode them for fun and to make it ok for lower levels to be in there without worrying about cars. Just be really cautious around the cars, don't blow up any near robots, pre-blow them up from far away etc. 
---
Again, these are not patch notes. I know this bug is frustrating, and even game breaking for you, but it's not a priority for Bethesda right now. Maybe not many people aren't experiencing the bug, so Bethesda would rather focus on bugs affecting more people? In any case, wait for the patch notes, submit a ticket, blah blah blah. 
---
Reading this just made my day. I think a counter is definitely a must (we all know why), but this no player/camp damage option could really be a boon to Adventure mode.
---
Plus I just noticed all of my holograms tapes are gone except the overseers..... WTF
---
They said “all energy weapons”. The. Specified an additional buff for semi auto.
---
A 10% damage boost to semi-auto Energy Weapons, huh? That's .. not really enough. Plus, semi-auto EW weren't the flavor that really needed a condition boost. Not as badly as Auto EW. Semi-Auto should have gotten at least a 50% damage boost, while Auto EW should have gotten a 10% damage boost and at least Quadrupled Condition bonus.
---
And it's great to see Heavy EW get a GREAT Condition boost! But only really the Gatling Plasma is usable. Damage on the Gatling Laser and Ultracite Gatling Laser is WAY too low. Unless the Flamer and Cryolator are truly considered "Heavy" EW. They could definitely benefit.
---
And there's also tons of OTHER problems with EW, like how they don't benefit from Anti-Armor perks and legendary effects at all. Or how Ultracite Gatling Lasers and Enclave Plasma guns aren't in the pool for Legendaries (Just like how Hunting Rifles were). We also can't learn ANY Enclave Plasma plans or mods, besides the Prime receiver, which makes them useless when they don't do anything different from normal Plasma weapons which can easily be modded AND be Legendary.

This is a great start, but it should only be the tip of the tip of the iceberg for making Energy Weapons viable.
---
That might be it. I will check my workbench
---
at white springs I stood in a car and blew it up I fired straight into the air and all the robots started shooting me like I was a clay pigeon.  Before I even hit the ground I was dead. 
---
Had a good laugh at that one 
---
That crossed me mind but only works if everybody sets their alarm for the same time. Then checked Reddit at the same time. Then found this thread and my comment at the same time. Then I get a dozen messages in half hour and nothing again. Wow people have specific timetables. Makes me feel inefficient with my time.

Darmok and Jilad, at Tanagra...

Anyone but juice head.

Was it vague? People who speak in memes are fucking stupid and spend too much time on Reddit.  Is that better? 
---
My server crashed in Fort Definace to! Exactly what you just said also happened to me! All that effort to get to the top, I got the military ID so I could use the elevator, and I got disconnected! Then, when I logged back in, it told me I hadn’t done all that and I needed to register for the Brotherhood AGAIN! It’s the same thing!
---
Are you on PC? 
---
Having done so many times, I understand someone can come contest me while I'm claiming it.  I also understand that someone can readily come take it from me.  As a pacifist I make no attempt to defend either way.  I'm just using a resource that's there that nobody is using or has interest in using.  If I had a button to just relinquish it after I set it up, I'd push it immediately.
---
Thus far the only times I've been engaged in PVP related to workshops was when a griefer exploited the claiming mechanic by starting the claim process, interrupting it by leaving the area and then chasing me all over the map until I ignore/block them and leave the server rather than just taking the workshop.
---
I'd rather not have to keep turning pacifist back on after taking a workshop.  I'd much prefer they close the exploit that allows griefers to chase players all over the map, over a workshop that isn't being defended.  The pvp flag shouldn't be enabling if I'm outside the workshop area.
---
Also I seriously doubt OP was able to be killed by slap damage.  There's been incredibly extensive testing on that.  It'd take someone with only 200hp 40 whole seconds to die from slap damage.  It's far more likely OP did something to get pvp-flagged (like get contested for a workshop, be in a team with someone who was, or hit the person back with pacifist off).
---
As to broken camps, having lived in areas that are frequently nuked (scorchbeasts are fun), it is always cheaper to move a camp than it is to rebuild it.  That's probably an exploit too, but lacking some more effective defense options (and it basically affects everyone rather than just people that want to pvp versus those that don't), I'm not so bothered by it.
---
I've only gotten the light blue skin for my Pip-boy and the tie-dye for my metal armor and I have almost 3,000 atoms. I'm sure if I played everyday I would definitely have more atoms. 
---
Gonna dig that 1* AA Gatling Plasma out of my STASH to give it a try next week :)
---
I would think AAE if every hit or shot ignores the armor whereas instigating would work only on the first hit. Both might be a small difference though since enemies are easy to kill. 
---
I'm okay with PvP for workshops as well, although I wouldn't be upset if that went away as well. Zero interest in PvP myself, or being targeted by camp griefers, both of which seem to better suit Survival mode.
---
Hi! 
---
We have bug fixes for Adrenal Reaction coming in patch 7, to address its positive effects not applying, and also to restore its original damage bonuses. 
---
We're also fixing an issue that could cause you to get stuck in [Caution] while stealthed even when no enemies were nearby.
---
This isn't the full patch notes so just because it is not mentioned does not mean we aren't getting it.  Perhaps they didn't want to reveal everything today.
---
Or recapping controversies started by blatant lies and misrepresentations he helped perpetuate in the first place.
---
The entire trading system is a bit confusing. Being able to see your trade partner inventory, is vastly complicated, and even the way to pick items from your inventory and set prices is a mess tk deal with the first times you use it.
---
I suggest that we select the items we wanna trade, put them in a trade window and set prices there. Then if the player just agrees is picks the item for the price he agreed or if he wants to counter offer something else he puts his items or different prices up. Then you either click a button to agree with their offer, or one to imply that you prefer the asking price. If both agree, both lock, and confirm. And go about their life's. 
---
Adrenal Reaction fixes are also coming in Patch 7!
---
Maybe they are deleting duped items somehow.
---
Did you re log and check if you got it back ?
---
What system are you on, must check later today, but think i can make shielded lining for the Officers under armor on both pc and xbox..
---
But the marine wetsuit has better stats ;)
---
I agree with everything you have mentioned in this post. However I would like to elaborate on the melee damage component in this game. This does need to be balanced with ballistic damage. I would never want to suggest decreasing melee damage output, but instead increasing ballistic damage in some weapons for general gameplay. 
---
I believe Bethesda has taken the right steps in terms of PVP with the TSE weapons, however I wish these weapons were only nerfed while in PVP. If they did something similar with some of the Strength Melee perks and nerfed them for PVP only, I would be okay with that. For me and other players like you mentioned, melee is the best option for just playing the game/damage output after the nerf to the TSE weapons.
---
I havent played in a bit but I was playing as an alcoholic. Was pretty bummed to find out everytime I would log back in I wouldn't gain a debuff for notdrinking in 12 hours.
---
Thanks! That’s what I have been looking for! 
---
More detail about mothman? I encontered him twice and those were VERY different encounters 
---
Once he was lvl5, friendly, gave me a buff (and scared the shit out of me)
---
Then he was lvl45, agressive, tp in my base while I was in (not the cause for #4) then I abused is ai to kill him an got crap rewards
---
Yes, I'd like actual planters.  Both ground level ones and the standing ones you can find in some locales.
---
I think different consoles have a different experience. PC is so calm it's silly but I've asked several of these commenters what they play on and what griefing they've had (to see if I'm right) but they all stopped replying. Best I got so far is "I blocked somebody with glitchy power armour".
---
&gt;As would not allowing anyone or anything to spawn stuck inside of foundations and not allowing enemies to spawn within your building.
---
While I agree this should probably be fixed, for the past few days robots have been spawning in my foundation in a position where they're just stuck and can't hit anything, and it's been a great source of aluminum lmao.
---
Interesting. Maybe I'll finally try out some energy weapons. Ever since tried out my first laser pistol I've never even thought about using them.
---
Also, it's nice to have cosmetics put as rewards into the game instead of the Atom shop. 
---
Finally, challenge tracking is nice, but what about the broken exploration challenges? I've stuck on maybe three of them despite having all the mentioned locations explored. Can we get a fix, please?
---
Well you're getting a debuff to your strength from somewhere. They haven't shut the servers down recently so they couldn't have nerfed anything on you.
---
The number limits of lights and turrets was a common idea, very glad they are running with this!
---
It's nice that energy weapons are getting some attention, but without armor penetration they will still be useless, and there's no mention of whether or not this has been fixed. And 2x health for semi-auto energy weapons still seems low, my combat rifle lasts *far* longer than 2x as much as my laser rifle.
---
I can make the marine, but no upgrades. Do you need the plans or learn by scrapping. 
---
Yea. Logged out and back in still naked...lol 
---
That’s awesome lol. Thanks for sharing have a great day. :)
---
If you've got any mods and use the custom ini, you'll need to update the ini.  Tell-tale sign is atom shop items are sometimes invisible.
---
I've killed with slap damage plenty of times.
---
Atmosphere. that's it.
---
Lights taking less budget just lights up my world y'all.
---
Can we squad up so my Johnny sins build can meet your naughty nurse build?
---
anti armor by far. For the hand made. If you can get an anti armor crippling or anti armor explosive you are good for pretty much anything not a scorchbeast, hermit crab, or mirelurk queen.  
---
For those you are better with something like an instigating Gauss which can just wipe the floor with them. 
---
+karma 
---
My damage fluctuates a lot up and down, I drink a lot of random juicies in game, so that could be the cause. Confirm of you drink up juices a lot instead of just water.
---
You’re right, it’s just weird that they’re only specifying semi-autos.
---
Thank you! Building a C.A.M.P. takes a lot of time and planning. People do it because they love to build and want to enjoy looking at and moving around a cool space when they are done. It takes hours to build a new C.A.M.P., but only minutes to destroy one. Even rebuilding a C.A.M.P. from blueprints takes longer than its destruction does. That seems like a biased system that heavily favors destruction over creation. Creation, I might add, that Bethesda should want to encourage because many Atom Shop items are C.A.M.P. items. I've been holding out hope that Adventure servers will remove PvP and finally provide the PvE experience I'm looking for in FO76.
---
Oh, I don't need to imagine. My TSE Laser is going to be awesome!!!
---
Thank you!!!
---
I’m not trying to be an arse, but they didn’t say “all energy weapons”. They said many energy weapons, then went on to specify that “for heavy weapons and semi-auto energy weapons..” they’ll be increasing durability and damage.
---
I basically abandoned my sniper for the time being, because he'll get into a perma-danger state that only goes away with a relog.  (persists even inside the whitesprings hotel or bunker)  No health regen and no sneak attack damage.  On top of that, his whitesprings nuke tesla farming rifle stops doing damage after a couple reloads, and I get 0 loot.  Yeah, it's not fun.
---
Hey, thanks for reply! That's excellent news and puts many of my frustrations to rest.
---
I LOVE this game, but I haven't played since these two bugs showed up. Now, I'm stoked fo4 next week!
---
I'm honestly not certain about X-01 mods or plans to be honest, you are probably right in terms of availability. For me though, I'm lvl 175 on my main, have done all quests and events and my endgame now consists of seeing how far I can jump across rooftops, and helping people get what they need. 
---
Is it, though? I can count on one hand the times I've been 'forced to pvp' over a workshop, and I've taken lots of them.
---
Things don't get fixed unless you speak up.
---
Forgetting to equip Super Duper/ Starched Genes is the bane of my existence. I don't mind the Picklock/Hacker perks because it's never a nasty surprise. I do wish you could upgrade all three cards in to one card though. It's just more micro for no obvious reason. 
---
This should have been included in the ITV, I know so many people will be ecstatic for this news!
---
Yeah that's fine. We can trade insults directly if you prefer: you're an idiot that has nothing to back up their BS and pulled any serious conversation down to insults because that's all you can do. Is that more along the lines you needed?
---
Let me try rebooting. Thanks
---
If you have the perk that automatically uses a stimpack when hurt could you still get killed by slap damage while AFK (assuming you had a bunch of stimpacks)?
---
If you use vats stick to the AAE
---
There were 2 really popular posts not too long ago each claiming one Weapons was better than the other, their points were
---
TS scales up base damage so any % Damage increase you get from modifiers like Explosive is larger than with AA 
---
AA damage boost is higher than TS by a few percentage points
---
naked, lol :)
---
You need plans for the upgrades and for the wetsuit you can't find them at vendors, but they do drop from delivering "technical data" :)
---
Excited to see my .50 Cal back in action. 
---
I spent the past month acquiring the following:
---
* TSE Laser Rifle
---
* TSE Tesla Rifle
---
* TSE Cryolater
---
* TSE Gatling Laser
---
Oh my...
---
Beth responded to my comment.
---
Both bugs are addressed next week.
---
Boy I'm glad I commented on post I'm not 'supposed' to, and got downvoted to the bottom.
---
Gotcha. Thanksooks like I will be going to fort defiance alot....
---
Challenge tracker will be super helpful! 
---
Beth replied, my friend. Both glitches fixed next week.
---
You haven’t played hard mode until you do “average joe” build. You just need to make sure every stat has 8 points in it. 
---
No thank you. That’s a cosmetic change. If you want to retain the hardened veterans give them more stash space/increased carry weight/reduced thirst and hunger/increased damage resistance or AP/increased SPECIAL capacity. Heck even a legendary gunsmith or armored PERK card where you can add legendary effects. Anything but stars by your name. 
---
 Any fix on the caution bug? Been 2 months now
---
You can also get both the mask and bindings from lucky hole mine. Ya know, in case you also need lead
---
Excellent news about the Laser Weapon durability and damage buff! I can finally take my Medic's Laser gun out of storage and make better use of it on my Medic BoS Scribe! And I may jsut use my .50 Cal Machine gun now that it's gotten a decent buff.
---
CAMP budget increase and turret budget space decrease means I can build and decorate to my hearts content! I recently built a nice symmetrical cabin and may just celebrate the increase this coming update and post it on the reddits! Looking forward to seeing more Inside the Vaults!
---
I had this happen to me last night. This guy came right into my base, invited me to trade, and then hit me when I didn’t want anything he had. He kept trying to taunt me, but I didn’t want to. I’m level 20, and he was level 47. I had to leave the server because he would not leave me alone. People like that are the worst part of 76. 
---
or in MODUS's bunker, there are 2-4 there every time i check :)
---
" Weapon damage for all other automatic heavy weapons has been increased by 10% to 20%."
---
Ironically getting a NPC to chase you between those loading zones requires the exact sort of functionality to get a NPC agent to go up and down a ladder..
---
Cool. For sale or laying around?
---
I HATE HATE HATE seeing the clown suit and fastnacht mask combo, especially when the player has an unarmed build with a deathclaw or mole gauntlet.  It's just beyond creepy.  A friend of mine in game wanders around like that, and I make him change into something else when we play together.  Wear a ladies swimsuit, a filthy suit, a fedora, bottlecap sunglasses, a leather cap, anything but the mask and clown suit.
---
This really made my day. My tse gatling laser finally gets to shine. I see a lot of fusion core farming in my future. Luckily i have a 2 shot plasma gatling and a ton of plasma cores to play with while i build up fusions. I think i might even still have a 2 shot plasma rifle buried in my stash somewhere. 
---
For the friendly "Wise" Mothman, he spawns during the event, the Path to Enlightenment, at the lighthouse near Vault 76. He gives you a 5% XP boost if you "commune" with him, after you complete the event.
---
Other than that, he's just a dick, and attacks you at random. My first encounter with him was 100 levels into the game, somehow I always evaded him before then haha.
---
Praise be unto The Todd.
---
Very interesting. 
---
as you can see by the number of upvotes, Ladydevann has for this comment, no one gives a fuck about this game anymore.
---
Possible. I’ve done the same, no camp there.
---
I’ve also deliberately reloaded to the same server (join a friend) and had it subsequently place my camp. 
---
The reason I don’t think it cares about players in your camp space is I run two accounts; I’ve loaded one while the other is in the space of the first’s camp; it appears around the second player
---
I don't think they're reducing the number of lights and turrets you can build, I think they're reducing the cost to the budget.
---
&gt; I just picked shit randomly and I'm only dying rarely so 
---
so your first character? the one that knows how to build everything but doesnt have the stats to match :P
---
I had a terrible, wonderful idea today for a "Brave Sir Robin" build... not just pacifist, but actively running away from all combat. I may never get past Lvl 5, but who cares? Now to find an outfit with a chicken on it.  
---
If someone could follow me around with a banjo, I'd owe you one.
---
Whatever happened to great single player games?
---
They’re pve/pvp servers. 
---
&gt;"technical data"
---
i was talking about  "technical data" , in the room full of desk's right before the weapon vendor there is usually 2-4  "technical data"  laying around..
---
To a different game. 
---
That's how it felt to me also.  Once I hit 50 it just felt like the levels came faster and faster.  The Home Defense card is worth getting to level 3 for the turrets and the ability to disarm traps.
---
Yeah, a 10% damage buff still puts a laser rifle at lower damage than a hardened combat rifle. And the handmade still absolutely dumps on it. This just doesn't seem like enough.
---
Yes but that technically wouldn’t cover an automatic plasma rifle because it’s not considered a heavy weapon.
---
Thank you. Will start keeping my eye out. Appreciate it 
---
Block works for only the session..
---
People say the plan only drops once and only once you have completed a nuke launch. Can't confirm what you are saying because not a single plan dropped for my alt character before the changes, but I hadn't dropped a nuke. Also it could be registering my primary characters already got the plan. I also haven't seen too many people selling the plan, so I assume there are not too many out in the wild and excess plans floating around.
---
I use a spotify playlist full of songs I thought should be in Fallout and songs from past Fallout games. 
---
Just because a percentage of people on Reddit, which is only a small percentage of all players, enjoy the game doesn't mean the game succeeded. Again, the people who think the fact that they enjoy it matters are just self-absorbed.
---
Yes! We do take suggestions and feedback into account. Unfortunately it takes a bit of time for us to implement and code everything into the game, so these suggestions do not show immediately so it can come off as us not listening. We do listen and do add that feedback in :)
---
Depends on the update. The last update broke several major mods (perk loadout manager, the text chat mod) because they relied on internet access API’s that Bethesda has now limited. Perk loadout has been patched to provide most of the same functionality, although not QUITE as convenient as before. I don’t think the text chat mod is possible now. 
---
Yep, and it stops people from doing things like running up, destroying your camp, going instantly passive and dancing in the ashes while laughing because they can't be hurt back.
---
Hahahahahahaha. 
---
Not one to usually comment but what a fucking arrogant and flat out rude response.
---
“Care Bear eXtreem Adventure Mode”?
---
Who even talks like that? Lol.
---
I was just trying to explain why you were getting downvoted.
---
So, I am confused. How does one make another build. Like, start a new game? I am on ps4, so maybe that’s why. So far, I just kinda go out into the world and try to survive. Am I playing the game wrong? Sorry, 1st online game that I have ever played.
---
Aw man. Sad they limited that. 
---
But why does it only specify semi-autos and heavies? Are auto plasma and laser rifles going to stay broken? :(
---
It puts a little wanted badge on your HUD that looks like the ones you see on the map (I believe near your health bar, but it's been a long time since I've been wanted so I could be wrong).  However, it was still easy to miss.  I didn't realize I was wanted until random workshop turrets started opening fire on me as I passed, which prompted me to take a close look at what was going on.
---
I hope that there is a flag or some kind of visual indicator of who is in pacifist mode, that way people that actually want to engage in PVP won't have to guess.
---
Heavy Weapons durability! Thank you!!!
---
C.A.M.P. s that have turrets shouldn't be effected. If you build a C.A.M.P. with turrets and then switch to pacifist it should disable the turrets. 
---
The reasoning behind this is the Whitesprings issue. Say someone is using their turrets to take out the ghouls and preventing other players from having a go, but the owner is on pacifist. No one can damage the turrets because the C.A.M.P is protected. 
---
Connect the turrets to the players pacifist settings.
---
Your conditions are accepted.
---
You didn’t even read it did you.
---
Um, you might be misunderstanding what a pacifist is. A pacifist doesn't fight back. That doesn't mean that others can't beat the crap out of them. In fact, getting attacked is kinda required to be a pacifist because people you have to be attacked to prove you won't fight back. 
---
Pacifist mode is just stopping you from mistakenly engaging in PvP, but what is really needed is no PvP servers if enough players don't want any PvP. 
---
XBox
---
No build mention is probably about the white spring turret bases
---
Logging in now [eclecticbill], meet me at overseer's camp for the Marine wetsuit and Tac helm.
---
Your second character sounds like mine. Just trying to survive, taking one day at a time. Sure, his playstyle is centered around being cautious and sneaky, using a sniper rifle a lot, but his hatchet is good for small critters and he likes to use a shotgun for ghouls and such. 
---
Are you suggesting someone should make special accommodations for your style of play?
---
Is the patch out today too then? They release notes on the day the patch is released.
---
I hope this expanded no build zone includes behind the golf club at whitesprings... don't mind folks building on the course here and there--it is a nice flat space to build a camp and get your design down before moving.
---
"Say it with me now"
---
You were being condescending. 
---
Thanks. Will do
---
Fingers crossed, that Queen of the Hunt and Heart of the Enemy finally get fixed this patch.
---
There's one in lucky hole mine too in the secret cave.
---
Might as well go grab some lead while you're down there.
---
I'm defibitely going to try this. I just lpgged on and had to fix my entire farm lol
---
I'd keep concentrated fire on 1 if you're not using vats that often and add Glow Sight. Under agi I'd swap Dodger for sneak. Lower end and add luck for serendipity and/or tormentor. 
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one that isn’t a fan of power armor. When I play FO4, I only donned it for the Glowing Sea. 
---
Isnt the super white, washed out bug because of alt-tabbing? It happened because of that for me. I would need to restart the game to fix it. 
---
Yes, energy weapons are getting buffed! [Read more info here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Pt0vzS8LLqzvSsNw3n98/inside-the-vault-fasnacht-seasonal-event-and-patch-7-preview)!
---
The other day a daily challenge was: take a picture of yourself drunk and naked. Your character would have loved that one! 
---
I have so many fusion cells I saved up just for this! A+. Thank you Bethesda!
---
Oh no. I love power armor 
---
Fits the personality profile. Some people just suck. 
---
Darnit 
---
This is a whole bunch of nope for me.

These are not patch notes, just the weekly newsletter they put out.
---
Oh buddy! [Coming to you next patch](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Pt0vzS8LLqzvSsNw3n98/inside-the-vault-fasnacht-seasonal-event-and-patch-7-preview) :)
---
Find the plan and build one to hang on your wall.
---
Someone pasted the text into a comment on this post.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aye9tv/inside_the_vault_is_out

I personally dont like them because they aren't real "petrified corpses" they are just character models with a dirty skin texture. 
---
&gt;Heavy Weapons
---
&gt;We’ve reduced the fire-rate for high rate-of-fire automatic heavy weapons across the board and increased their damage by +10%. Adjusting these weapons’ fire-rates gave us more room for a damage increase, which will help them punch through armor more effectively without increasing their baseline damage per second too high.
---
so the LMG is still going to be garbage it seems. 10% increase to 16 damage (with perks iirc) only makes it do 17.6 damage, that is not really a buff. even if they drop the godly RPM to something closer to the 10MM SMG, it is still going to be chewing through ammo and doing cotton ball damage.
---
Just found when it's coming out. Next week.
---
You could try not being a dickhead, maybe that will help with the downvotes
---
Then don’t comment 
---
Is there a casting couch?
---
You were just unlucky.  I use it sometimes.
---
Sometimes you can also find that even though the list is populated, no one in it is connected anymore.  That's a sign that the entire server crashed.
---
Did a full reboot. Nada... still tighty whities.....lol 
---
UH did you read it? Cause yes they are it says it there in the notes. 
---
Lol k
---
And INT of 3 but can hack the shit outta stuff just by dumb luck.
---
Just server hopping whitesprings.  He was doing the same.  Every once in a while we hit the same one
---
Insteed of a hour you just have to grab it to move it
---
It is not encouraging trading in caps, which is the only in game currency. You will have people hoarding caps at whatever limit they set, but setting it so low has caused the bottom to drop out of the "cash" market wherein the people putting in the hours to farm the legendary gear that is seeding the market are unable to accept caps in exchange for items. You could say these people could spend caps to reduce their stash and start accepting more, but they (we) are by and large trading among one another for end game gear. Once you reach the min/max phase of this game its exceedingly difficult to *do* anything with the caps you have amassed. 
---
Raising the caps limit is a bandaid on a larger issue: there is no worthwhile cap sink for end game players. If you fix that issue, by way of say a legendary vendor system that lets players utilize caps AND unwanted hoarded legendary items, you fix the larger problem and an increase to the cap limit becomes a more valuable solution for all. 
---
To be frank, the economy isn't for newer players; it's an end game system. 
---
You just wanna play dodgeball
---
I meant something like: oh you are level 100 now it means you are level 50 prestige 5 and you get the equivalent rewards for the 5 prestige levels (whatever they are, prestige perks or I don't know what)
---
I like the energy weapon buff but I think it was to little, I think the should have gotten a 30% increase as they are nearly worthless, I still have a instigated laser rifle and my normal handmade still dose more
---
From this post, I can gather you’re just not very effective in PvP. 
---
Healing in combat, not that hard.
---
Melee, not overly powerful when up against an AA Handmade.
---
Sentinel and chameleon armor is not nearly as powerful as you make it seem. People with sentinel take major damage when staggered.
---
Only truly broken system right now is Stealthboys.
---
The problem with "encouraging trading" is also that they discourage trading by not making even/fair trades across the board possible. There should be a "trade window" where both players put the items for a trade, then both have to confirm the trade. The current system is counterproductive and only encourages mistrust and bad behavior. 
---
It takes a while to load.
---
Thank you for your reply.
---
Thank you, glad to hear it. Looking forward to the upcoming update. *Vault boy thumbs up emoji*
---
Yes, some people tend to make multiple characters and use perk cards to have them as different builds. I’m on PS4 also and know a few people who have a couple characters out there. I believe you can make 5 different characters. 
---
As long as it’s just not stars and an actual reward, I am ok. 
---
GT is NeilP99. I play on my husband's GT.  Won't be on until Saturday. Look forward to seeing you all in Appalachia!
---
feels more like my perk cards are not working anymore
---
It get stored as it was built. Under the Stored tab you'll find the blueprint, which actually contains more than you can put in an individual blueprint.
---
Berserker does increased damage if you have no armor on. I would check that first.
---
Yesssssss
---
They stored, but unless you built on a 1x1 platform, you unlikely to be able replace your house, so you going to have to break down the blueprint and try rebuilding it. If you built on a 1x1, you should be able to replace it almost anywhere but yes it should be on the stored tab.
---
yes. i am not competitive. wander around a lot and don't do a lot of quests.
---
I traded for the items so I hope they were not duped, but I am not totally naive either..... If that is the case there will be a lot of naked people running around........
---
There are basically only two points in a playthrough where that would make sense: crafting your first excavator armor and crafting the X01 prototype (OK, maybe if you make level 35 and 45 excavator armor, 4) unless you're crafting to give/sell to others. That's some rather specific coding for a very rare occasion.
---
ob right i forgot over repair
---
who wouldnt want to

With no actual raiders to wonder and kill you making the game more exciting, they depend on real people to do so. This is one of the most friendly communities in an online game I've ever encountered. There are those that get bored and look for people to prey on. I spend most of my time in pacifist and I get mad at people who are looking to mess up what I have going on. Just as I did in fallout 4 when AI disroyed my base. We get it its annoying. yet just another way to play in the wasteland. I suggest hiking up the skirt, build a safe base, and maybe consider a location that is discreet to camp. If that doesn't help, get better at the game or buy better weapons and armor.
---
I understand that, but it caps the number of turrets. So there's an increase of budget, but it may come at the cost of decreased defense overall. However, if the turrets gain a small buff in damage out to compensate, it wouldn't make a difference.
---
The biggest reason I didn't use them was specifically because of how quickly they lost condition. A modded Two Shot Laser goes from full condition to &lt; 25% in 4 clips. Since repairing it requires reasonably uncommon crafting items it was literally unsustainable even if I kept near a workbench.
---
Hopefully the adjustment to condition loss is significant. If it's a 10% adjustment that's still not workable.
---
Excellent post McChug, I agree with everything you mentioned, but I am currently sitting on 7 royal jelly at the moment  I farm 3 locations routinely for  honeybeasts and server hop at least twice for respawns.  It's part of my daily grind.  There are two spots that royal jelly can be found outside of honeybeast drops. The one you mentioned at Middle Mountain and there's one more on the south fork of the split road just north and west of Twin Pines cabin which is just north and west of Vault 76.  Head west on the lower fork of the road, there is a skeleton with a bicycle in the road and usually there is a jar of RJ.  It too is on a daily respawn cycle.  I have gotten 2 aid category royal jelllies from honeybeasts, so unless it's been a glitch, they will drop the right kind, but out of at least 50 -60 kills I've only ever gotten the 2.  The Middle Mountain spawn has given me the other 5 , (it spawns junk RJ about 75% of the time for me) , and the Twin Pines road has only dropped junk grade.  I just recently came across that spawn point, so I don't have a usable percentage stat. for the drop rate.

&gt; No build zones will take care of whitesprings golf course XP farms.
---
You know what happens when you assume...
---
This isn't patch notes
---
It's 5 damage per second max. If you're a melee character that means you could be killed in 10 seconds.

Do energy weapons benefit from anti armor perks like stabilized now?

---
I mean, I guess the limit makes sense. Who needs 20 turrets on a camp? Also, everyone hates the Whitesprings turret Camps.
---
I will try testing that on the next build.  I hope this post is not seen as a whine as I have plenty of mat for rebuilding.  It just seemed like a logical theory to discourage taking over one spot for too long.
---
I can help lot it with you but can't helo lunch too low of a level
---
This could easily be done by allowing players to bulk ammo, so that it's balanced and worth less than a cap per round.
---
Only if they make wrenches throwable first!
---
Too bad you can't animation cancel the way you used to be able in Fallout 4.  That was something I don't think too many people knew about in 4, but Bethesda either intentionally, or intentionally was able to fix it by making the third person camera the way it is.
---
No, but I got a sweet race car bed. 
---
Their just trying to entice folks into spending before next week when new stuff comes out. 
---
There is no wrong way, some ways are just more effective and you learn as you go.  
---
Are you having fun?  If so, DING! Winner.  
---
Slap damage is limited to 5 hp a sec
---
Sounds good
---
I'm saving caps for the acoustic instruments. I've been going for the "Me, in game!" build... and I need a banjo.
---
I downsized my cabin, which was lore-friendly and not some huge box, for a large tent, and I love it. I do have a steel bed and all my crafting tables arranged inside. When I relocate, I just imagine my character packing up a brahmin, maybe with a small cart in tow. 
---
Yeah, make another character.
---
How's the player base? I'd consider coming back! 
---
"If you can dodge a wrench, you can fuck my wife!"
---
Did I get it right?
---
No sweetie :) I pop on Sun Kissed when I'm a little too irradiated to go back to about 120 HP when I'm in the Forest doing my thing and then take it back off and put Good Doggy back on. I don't leave SK on for more than a few minutes. :)
---
Okay I'll try I played this game for around 120 hours loved it while I was playing it but the bugs and the non pvp player drove me away the should just put the people who don't want to pvp on a other server but they won't do that and that just kills the fun for me in this game 
---
i actaully raised my int to 5 cause i needed to craft a spiky stick hitty thing
---
Sorry, but the statements and actions of Bethesda in implementing Pacifist mode, and now working on Survival mode and making pacifist mode disable damage completely (to both the player and their camp) says otherwise.  You are trying to cherry-pick early promo statements to support your desire to continue either griefing or to rationalize your anti-social chosen boredom relief method.
---
There are posts from people holding him on the market and bazaar subreddits all the time. I don't get the appeal though, he never has any items worth buying.
---
Last weekend i spent forever collecting flora from a juke zone and when i got back to my camp after crafting into stable flux i saw a 430cap wanted dude destroying someones camp. Like an idiot i ran over without drooping my stable flux in my stash and got mowed down by this dude and his friends. 
---
My fault for being an idiot but they were destroying someones camp

Yes, it's my understanding that the Patch 7 weapon balance adjustments also affect guns like the Alien Blaster, Laser Gun, Plasma Gun, etc. 
---
(Shameless copy/pasta from Valseek on our forums [here](https://bethesda.net/community/post/1954363)!)
---
Have fun continuing to be disappointed that fo76 will never be a pure PVE experience just because you whine loud enough.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I picked up the tricentennial edition for $25 (for some reason it was cheaper than the regular version) and keeping fingers crossed the code works the first time around :) 
---
Bethesda, take note of the fact that this Post is:
---
# "92% Upvoted"
---
That means you probably need to take it more seriously than just "we're looking into it".  Do something like let people run their own server with the option to simply turn PVP OFF.  
---
If I don't want my base destroyed, and other players can destroy it, and just laugh at me, with no reasonable means for me to disincentivize them enough to make them even think twice about it, it's simply ***not fun.***  
---
Why haven't you played any other Fallouts? I suggest you do ASAP.
---
250 caps? If so do you have marsupial, adrenal reaction, twisted muscles, and healing factor?
---
Thanks for the Challenge tracker, I love those additions!
---
Btw. are some challenges going to be fixed (namely the discover location challenges, which won’t complete no matter how often I visit a location)?
---
You’re not alone in your unlucky server hops. Somehow I did get my first calibrated shock almost immediately after crafting my X-01 and nothing since then. 
---
However, my dad happened upon a jet pack and didn’t want it so he gave it to me, so now I don’t have to hop for that anymore. I was waiting for that or the stealth torso, whichever came first. My son found the stealth torso and I told him to keep it. Neither of them are server hoppers so they were incredibly lucky.
---
I’m still searching for my second calibrated shock. I found the Tesla torso mod and was excited until I found out it also damages friendlies and can turn them hostile so it sits in my stash.
---
I agree the trade window needs to be more intuitive, but I don't see how it encourages bad behavior. The 'mistrust' is just a hold over from the trade stealing "bug" that turned out to be complete BS anyway. 
---
*nerfed
---
But yeah, my go to was a two shot .50 cal and I stopped playing after it got too grindy trying to keep it fed and maintained. I'm planning on getting back on to check out the new events and my hopefully less sucky giant machine gun.
---
This. Nearly every time someone posts about getting killed by slap they mention something that initiates pvp after some discussion about the circumstances. I think it’s misunderstanding of the process... hell, I’ve been playing since beta and didn’t realize I could be killed anywhere on the map if I owned a workshop. I thought I had to be back at the shop again until Reddit educated me on it. 
---
I don't think a 10% boost is enough to fix lasers anyway, still no armor pen fix...
---
As a female character, hopefully
---
I've just had bad luck out in the boonies and get attacked 2 or 3 times every time I'm dawdling in camp ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
No flamer fuel fix? Come on, man.

The map should be big enough that, if you want, you can avoid other players.  If that were the case, then I could agree with your post.
---
I used both. Damage is not much different just the accuracy of hip fires. 
---
The Enclave underarmor is the worst, it clips through so many things. But it has the best shielded stats so I continue to wear it.
---
I do know in your CAMP, where you decide to place your CAMP machine is what determines where you spawn in.
---
So, once you place your CAMP machine initially, and it sets the border for your camp area, you can pick it back up again and re-place it anywhere within that border 
---
I had an issue at my new camp up on a mountain when i created it, it would place me each time waaaaay below it when i spawned in/fast traveled
---
so, i moved my CAMP machine to a different spot, and now I spawn in within my camp- much better!
---
so, i hope this helps you until they create an actual fast travel mat for our CAMPS
---
My character is just trying to survive the harsh apocalypse. While he prefers sneaking around and being cautious, picking off enemies from afar with a sniper rifle, he also carries a pump shotgun for ghouls and close encounters, and a hatchet for small critters.

Great video, thanks for sharing!

I feel like we are one step closer to Minecraft's melee system now. 
---
i did not change the stuff that I drink. always a mix of water, soda and the alcohol
---
Thanks that is much better than I thought.
---
This is great can you confirm if we will have to re apply again or will it update our current mutation. 
---
I think his issue is that you can simply outheal any damage dealt to you, practically making you invincible. Sentinel chameleon however should not be really good either as it would promote camping.
---
You can message people...
---
Do you have a Bloodied Explosive 10mm Pistol or a Anti Armor Explosive 10mm Pistol?
---
so close....
---
Wait you mean I shouldn’t have 15 INT at level 30?
---
Based on the fact that it broke in like 5 minutes, I think it's going to need to be under the 5-rank gunsmith effect, plus the 2x durability buff.  Swap to a semi-auto barrel, and you can still shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger.  With the better base damage of the semi-auto reciever, it should perform just as well or even better.
---
Why wouldn't energy weapons fall under the gunsmith durability blanket?  They're guns.  Do science perks need to have buff effects for energy weapon durability?  Seems like a major oversight.  Maybe they could rework the Science/Expert/Master perks to a 5 rank Science! perk that falls in line with Gunsmith and Makeshift Warrior.  The science perks are confusing and annoying.  Want to make Gauss rifles?  You need one rank of Science.  Want to make Plasma rifles?  You need Science Master.  However, Science Masters can't make Gauss rifles.  It clearly needs to fall into the same 5 rank system as ballistic and melee weapons, and recon scopes should be switched from requiring Science perk to just being a rank 4-5 gunsmith mod.
---
Also, why does licensed plumber exist, aside from stacking it with gunsmith for a [pipe bolt action](https://imgur.com/VgPjaHf) that only needs to be repaired once every two weeks in real time, and requires common components to fix anyways?
---
Im just going to scrap/store every thing before the update to avoid any problems. Was thinking of moving anyway. 
---
Hmm hopefully I’m not over my light budget. I’ve placed quite a lot just because I like the warm feel of it.
---
Thank you fellow traveler. 239 hours in -- and I also never knew what challenges would pop up -- thought they were somewhat random. I'm sitting on about 4K atom points; and I can still acquire a bunch more.
---
During beta there were 2 or 3. We all heard each other talking 
---
Until the event time runs out 
---
Damn it...
---
This logic is what I call yellow 
---
I would ask you give people a second to turn theirs on. Mine is off to avoid the random noise generation, but I will turn it on to talk.
---
That's cool, really.  I enjoy sightseeing and exploring the nooks and crannies of the place.  For the longest time I was really underpowered and had to take my time, and ran away from a *lot* of things, but as I got more upgraded I started spending less time worrying about advancing and spent more time having fun.
---
Lately my time is limited, so I'm actually doing mini-grinding in small bursts, which means my level goes up quicker, but I'm exploring less (and having less fun).
---
You play however you like, don't worry about what others think.
---
Nah, just wondering what your genius answer would be to that, since your other 9000 IQ answer of **Shootquicker** was a real hit of great advice.
---
Like IDK man, I meet plenty of asshat players in this game that have no etiquette, I guess you're just another one. I'll give you a thumbs down emote, and mumble some shit off mic when you do it to me, nbd. I'll get by, there are plenty of great people that play this game, so I won't let one turd spoil the broth.
---
And 2x durability is still pretty low, I don't think a lot of people realize how ridiculously fast these things break...
---
Actually I don't believe it would be that hard to do. I say this because I have experience nodding games on this game engine.
---
That's nice.
---
A 10% boost in energy weapon damage isn’t going to do the job alone. Are there any plans to address how energy weapons are seemingly not affected by perks such as tank killer? The DR and ER of most enemies are what make the guns seem weak
---
I have on too, 3* (I think weight reduction and less vats cost are the other 2). I have it set up as an auto pistol with a beam splitter. It's so much fun to shred enemies with for the three mags it lasts.
---
I have an idea!!!
---
After so much slap damage done it starts reflecting back at the pvp harasser. Ensuring that a passificst will never die, and if  they are lucky enough will get free caps from the bully killing themselves
---
Good bot
---
Rush hour exists because lots of people start work at the same time.
---
So you are saying if someone is poor and is not able to buy a headset you won’t deal with them
---
Just a bump since nobody else has posted. Feel free to share your characters.
---
Very true. There's also the possibility of a hearing or vice impairment, language difference, etc..
---
It's definitely frustrating to have someone just walk up and ask to trade, completely out of the blue, because sometimes they are trying to determine if you're worth attacking for scrap. 
---
 Oh I do. I will stand around for a bit a talk but just for a while.
---
You can rebuild your base with the only cost of 40-140 caps by simply moving the base even an inch. This method will cost no resources beyond caps.
---
No word if they will make armor penetration perks effect energy weapons, that would be a nice buff also.
---
It seems like most people who run up to me and offer a trade just want to see my weapons. I wouldn't mind if Bethesda offered an inspect option of another player where you could see their gear.
---
I just don't want to have my time wasted because they want me to stop playing long enough for them to have a good browse.
---
I agree that players should not avoid talking if they can. Like you, I have given away a lot of stuff to players who were nice over chat. Good on you for being generous.
---
I will only turn on my mic if someone messages me and tell them what they want, else no .. I rather not listen to jerks in the game berating me forever reason ..
---
Any news about getting suspended accounts back?
---
Oh, I read your comment wrong. You’re talking about people like me that never (rarely) use power armor, but you’re the opposite, lol.
---
Some of you would never make it in rust. 
---
I am a high level player, and I faced this same issue the other day! No game balance. At first I left the situation alone and then the player kept taunting me, so I made an effort and was killed in one swipe, full health X 01 power armor, - 15% damage armor, not even a fair fight, this continued twice, and I left the area and he followed me around and kept attacking me! I didn't get the balance here? My son said he was hacking or using a bot? Not sure how that works! 
---
That all sounds pretty good. The only time I really want to try to loot everything for junk is when I'm within a 50 yard radius of my Stash or a crafting table. I also only try to pick up smaller items too. Like, I can imagine carrying a screw driver or two or a roll of duct tape. But I feel the larger stuff like type-writers and buckets are a little much.
---
 I'm 72 and survive on a pension. There are few people poorer than me and I managed a $20 microphone. You don't need a headset, just a mic.
---
Lol yes! God in fallout 4 I had too many displayed but I loved it so much. And I love power armor but I do like being out of it too. So it’s half and half for me 
---
The only, only issue I will have will be wanted players hidding in their friends bases who are passive mode or people putting up indestructible camps at the golf house preventing people from getting kills
---
The amount of budget space that some buildable objects consume, such as Turrets and Lights, has been reduced, but they now also have a maximum amount that can be placed in your C.A.M.P. or Workshop. 
---
So they will cost less in you budget as I said. There will be a new maximum but they haven't said what that is yet.
---
what if you could take over a machine shop as a workshop and it produced screws and springs
---
I have all of them now (except herbavore since I got carnivore first). I usually play this character with my roommate, so I'm fine with herd mentality but I'm going to be trying to strip off empathy. Currently I equip a lvl starched genes, build up some rads, then take quick little dips into the decontamination shower at emmitt disposal until a mutation is cured. If it isn't empathy, I take off startched genes and run to the nuke barrels and require the lost mutation (server hopping as needed). Only had time to do it twice this morning before work. Lost then reaquired twisted muscles and chameleon. Going to try some more tonight.
---
Kept trying to slap kill me in the Whitesprings Mall. Typical douche. I had to waste a couple of stimpacks to stay alive to finish crafting before leaving.
---
 Why would I make a deal with anyone I cannot communicate with? Especially when its built into the game.
---
The only time I can return to the same server is when I do not want to return to the same server. I can get the same server repeatedly if I want to go to a different server.
---
Not sure how Bethesda knows my intentions....
---
I am usually fumbling around my menu trying to turn it on when that happens. What I appreciate is a message for a trade or a team invite. I will team with randoms if they send me a note asking for help or leveling. Just a random ping is meaningless to me. 
---
But even then some people still can not afford that. That’s all I am trying to say lol
---
yes seems so, i guess it's really a bug. no way a level 50 combat shotgun only does 100 damage with bloody mess, master shotgunner, expert shotgunner etc.   
---
Which system are you on?
---
Oh Well ..... I appreciate the thought 
---
Was gonna reply myself, but you basically nailed it for me too. I wish some things were different, and  I feel I'll probably burn out in endgame, but I'm getting way more enjoyment than I expected right now.
---
Xbox 
---
Not sure if you noticed but they are working on this in a future patch, I believe that when you enable pacifist mode you, your C.A.M.P. and possibly your workshop cannot be hurt with pacifist mode on or that’s what my friends are saying at least
---
I don’t trade with randoms - if you want to ask me something get on the mic.  But I’m not sharing my inventory with you unless it was a pre arranged trade meetup.
---
Make sure you get Super Duper (luck) at level 50 and max it out. Very very handy! I swap it for Bloody Mess when I'm crafting. Sorted!
---
Try playing Red Dead online for an hour.  Even the worst griefers in fallout pale in comparison.
---
Best wishes, friend.
---
Also just read in another post that Bethesda is changing pacifist to be completely non-pvp?  As in no slap damage or camp destruction... can anyone confirm that? 
---
thanks for your reaction. you did give me some hope that it's a temporary problem :s
---
Thanks, you as well
---
Also White Knight! (Agility).
---
They have made no mention of this no. Said it would be taken under consideration due to people complaining, but nothing from the officially 
---
Yeah, it's not likely they we'll be no build zoning remote areas. More likely it's for high player/quest traffic areas. 
---
You are correct. I get a public employees retirement disability, and even 20 bucks can be hard to to spend. For some people, gaming accessories and systems are a luxury that they save for our make payments on like I had to.
---
I don't think you understand what pacifist means. It means you do not fight. If I was a pacifist and someone wanted to start a fight with me in a bar, I might walk away with a black eye never having thrown a punch. It doesn't mean you are invincible, and it shouldn't mean that. I know you want to be invincible, but that is not how it works nor is it how it should work. Luckily for you, you had options. You could fight back, you could let him destroy your stuff, or you could have just left the server. Instead, you refused to swallow your pride to just leave and instead made a whining post on the internet about it.
---
Which platform?  I don’t think you can do this on PC ever - join must be a friend.
---
I try to do what I can, give a modded out weapon to someone lower with ammo, gave rad-away, red-x, stims, food and water, a shotgun (lvl5) and ammo to a level 4 last night. I think Players, if they can help should, BUT they don't have too, I do what I can maybe not all the time but a lot and, who know if that lower Level Player starting out, that you just helped turns into a F'n Dick.
---
I have an explosive 10mm submachine gun.  Not sure if that interests you but I really just don't want to scrap it.  It's a 2 star.  Forget the other perk...
---
I love the game! I will say also that for the most part the fallout community seems pretty helpful. Not at all what I expected from an online experience.
---
I'm like this, I won't trade unless I can talk to them and they talk back.
---
InnovSurvivalist has some great farming vids and her accent is adorable.
---
I can give you some if you are on ps4. I've accumulated like almost 300.

I wanna see someone roleplaying Shooty McFace.
---
BE is best but you gotta build for that.
---
hallelujah! 
---
Reminds me of that thing you were sposed to do in ESO where you'd mash the buttons in a certain way to cancel animations and increase DPS
---
I think the no-build zone is largely going to affect Whitesprings turret campers and possibly expanded areas around Helvetia and the Vaults so that there's not a camp in the way of potential pathing or quest related stuff regarding those areas.
---
If they remove the ability for lvl 18's to create those grotesque, gravity defying turret camps at Whitesprings, I'll be incredibly happy.  I server hopped a dozen times farming for legendaries at the golf club yesterday, and at least 5 servers had some shitball flying platformcamp set up behind the club with a handful of turrets owned by someone under level 30.  It's a plague.  I tried to offer caps, building supplies and free ammo if they would just take down their camp and place it somewhere else, but apparently this type of player doesn't use or acknowledge microphones.
---
Nope. Big, buff, bearded, and still in the naughty nurse outfit.
---
Lol.
---
I hope not for another 2 weeks minimum. Just long enough to miss the start of all the new content. 
---
Ey, I give a fuck.  I might bash but it's out of extreme frustration for turning the fallout experience into a broken cash grab mmo experience without the massive part of mmo, the balance of an mmo, the polish of an mmo, or the fun and rewarding experiences of unlocking stuff in an mmo.
---
We have bugs and glitches that are facetiously called exploits against players who don't even want that shit happening to them.  We have environments that aren't even fully made (nuka cola factory's giant red bottles aren't solid for one instance).  And the worst part is they TOLD THEIR PLAYERS TO BREAK THEIR GAME, THEN BANNED THEM, including innocent players.
---
That's after their endless debacles from ripping off players with false advertising to their security putting their consumers private information at risk.
---
So I'm highly salty that we went from the grand immersion and story of NV to the too dark, bland overly focused on guns 4, and now the completely half assed 76.
---
Still it is a fallout experience and when the game and servers aren't fucking up, it can be very fun, the story telling is subpar lazy writing because it's an mmo ripoff cash grab, and the strongest monsters in the game are useless to farm.  But when things come together into an unforgettable experience, I can put all of that aside and push onward to my next point of interest because this game is fun in its own way.
---
But if it nerfs anything else like red dead did I'll just be on my way back to Dying Light.
---
It's like a game developer forget what tge purpose of games are for.  Fun.  Nothing more or less, if the story telling, game play, and environment aren't fun wholly, you've failed at your job as a game creator.  Harsh words from a nobody but the numbers speak more than I.  $30 after 2 weeks, places giving away 2 copies in one bundle.  Universal negative reviews.
---
Even the official strategy guide has inaccurate information...
---
But the game itself CAN be fun, the maker or breaker will be them to stop listening to just reddit, and to take a huge step back, make the game actually fun to play and not a flipping endless grind, give us real quests, not this daily event crap, and real stories with real information, real lore, and an actual worldbuilding environment that isn't just oh noes scorched killed everyone!  Really?  Then why are all these vault dwellers kicking their collective asses??
---
We got a husk.  Give it some meat and bones.  Why is that asking for too much from a AAA game development team?  And if you're only going to listen to reddit then give redditors what sounds fun, and yes, easy.  Give us back screws, springs, and gears when scraping, let us build wherever the hell we want whether it's in a cave or in the air.  Debug your game and QUALITY CHECK/PLAY TEST YOUR NEW VERSION BEFORE RELEASE, don't lay off your testers then make your customers fulfill that role, we aren't a fascism ffs.
---
Make weapons make sense.  Make crafting recipes, plans, and overall in general make sense!  None of this getting a fraction of your stuff back or needing ridiculous stuff to craft food.
---
A fun game is a played game, when dlc comes back with proper full implementation or basically adding more content that isn't just some new area but new items, mechanics, and game play, you'll pull in the people who you've basically spit in the face of at this games release.
---
It's really not hard to just listen and make a game fun and worthwhile.  Give us a reloading bench.  Let us sell all ammo and junk to vendors.  Give us more wandering vendors than just grahm and a deathclaw merchant.  Up the cap limit on players and vendors, ban characters, not accounts.  Make antigriefing tools not be usable ny griefers, or give us more server options instead of one clusterfuck.  Make the social menu work.  Give us an in game chat system, how can Monster Hunter have a better system than fallout, wtf?  Give us more emotes and don't pull a Rockstar and make each one cost 500 atom.  Give us more styles and just more everything in the atomic shop, stop your sleazy sells tactics and act with some respect and pride.
---
Tldr; actually make your product fun and sensible, not just a broken sleazy cash grab.
---
It's fun getting lost and all in the post apocalypse, but it isn't fun dealing with the endless bullshit that this company has thrown our way, we just want to enjoy the fallout experience, not work for it...
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
No need for dedicated pvp servers. Just changing the rules in current game will make it a classic instead of the disaster. When people login they should be able to choose between Pacifist (zero damage give or receive) and full on PVP (no ‘slapping’, each bullet counts). Fancy perks and weapon levels shouldn’t affect weapons’ damage when PVP, as a survival game it should rely on skills and tactics, not ‘standing still in this magic armor and never die’ garbage. 
---
I have accumulated about 300 screws. I literally just server hop white springs.
---
What system are you on?  I have a torso w/ stealth attached which I don't use, and it routinely spawns that one for me at the vendor so if I ever decide to get it again I'm pretty confident it'll show up.  I'm not a stealth guy in this wasteland.  It's my first Fallout series melee/tank build and I love it. Ill be happy to make a fair trade for the torso and mod if you want.  I'm on XBox.  I also think they fixed the Tesla so it doesn't promote PVP if you are running passive.  I run reactive plates and I just recently learned it was fixed in the last patch.
---
Well said.   
---
Isn't it awesome when you get a legendary that fits the build? 
---
Each of the Nuclear silo bunkers has several level 3 terminals to hack to control the turrets. If you find a better place than that, please share!
---
I hear ya. Since you were asking specifically about the 10mm I thought it might be an ammo concer. I do have a 3 star western revolver you might be interested in.  Quad ammo, 90% reduced weight and 33% vats hit chance.
---
I've had mixed results with this.  I've moved the unit and still never consistently spawn in the same spot. its better than nothing though but I wish they'd make a real fix.
---
Are you too special to have read any of Bethesda's previous replies on the subject explaining exactly what was wrong, additional problems with the perk people hadn't even complained about yet AND when they were going to fix it?
---
It's really fucking hard to do a search and look for that "Bethesda replied" tag huh. 
---
If someone can't afford a $20 mic maybe they should spend there time doing something more productive than gaming.
---
Yeah That did it. I was using IE because a lot of stuff I need for work doesnt work in chrome. Looks like ill just have to use chrome for reddit Thanks
---
Nah I’ll pass I got a good western revolver on my character right now.
---
Unfortunately no.  Items are bugged regardless whether you've gone back to the desktop.
---
If you plan on getting mutations, starched genes and class freak are good.
---
Block works for both, session and always.
---
I am with you. I had every type of armor, and one of each paint jobs on display in the Red Rocket.
---
I think your a bit sensitive.  Then again I used to play Eve Online.   You had choices.   Block him for one.  Leave the server..   There are plenty.  Rebuild your camp.  Ignore him.     
---
There are dicks in games who do this.  Could analyze why but simple put they are what they are.   Stop taking it personally and move on.  
---
Nothing in this game cant be rebuilt or regained.  You don't loose anything but caps or junk.  All of it is quickly rebuilt and it is designed that way.
---
So people are not allowed to have fun
---
Challenge Tracking is something I've been wanting since Day 1. I made a vow not to spend any money on atoms so I spent 90% of my playtime just grinding challenges for them. Having this will help instead of having to check every 10 minutes how close I am to the achievement. 
---
The event seems cool. Definitely gonna collect as many masks as I can.
---
Parts of Raider Power Armor consistently spawn in the shack outside Blackwater Mine.
---
Way not to judge.
---
I don't think I would ever use it. But I'm sure some players need it.
---
Oh? Ok. I will check it next time when I encounter such occasion..
---
Hey, you do you boo boo!  At least you're still wringing some fun out of it until some DLC shows up.  I'm lvl.186 and I havn't gotten bored yet, but I'm running out of things to do too.
---
Bears need love too. 
---
[](/flutterkay)
---
You're getting down voted because you're acting like an entitled prick and literally whining that they don't care about something they've already addressed in previous threads dedicated to the fucking subject. Don't be a little bitch just because you're too lazy to actually look for an answer instead of demanding they repeat themselves just for you. 
---
Dude people make foundation camps specifically so they'll never need to move it to fix it from a griefer.
---
Every puke I’ve always blocked never shows again. And it’s easier for me to block them on pc then it is for them to get a new GT to grief. 
---
IMO, the high budget for turrets was intentional, to limit the number so you wouldn't be too invincible.  The fact that they're reducing the footprint while limiting the number seems to back that up (in theory at least).
---
I'm OK with this, as much as I hate hate the idea of having to defend your base from mole rats, I see the point, and I never expected for them to be able to defend against a determined player.  This effectively frees up budget while still reinforcing the 'defend yourself in the wild wastelands' theme.
---
Also, I didn't read a new maximum in the notes, I don't believe that's in the plan.  "While the above changes aren’t a direct increase to budget size..." is definitely *not* saying there *won't* be an increase, it hints to me that the only budget change is in lights and turrets, not in teh overall number.
---
Cool man 👍 great comment being an ass. Must feel good being so damn amazing all day long. I bet you take a picture when you give money to homeless people
---
&gt;heal spam can now consistently outmatch the weapon damage dealt by a single player.
---
Not really. If stims are outpacing your damage, your damage sucks. It's pretty easy to kill someone healing and the animation disables you from shooting and sprinting. It's already pretty balanced.
---
&gt;Melee and VATS combined
---
Yet you want to nerf chameleon when that's a huge counter to anyone using VATS. 
---
&gt;As a side note, which is however REALLY important to mention, there is some sort of glitch/exploit around currently, which allows people to extremely boost melee damage.
---
With an unbloodied build I can one shot most people with most of my builds (rifles, shotguns, melee). At 15 endurance you get 320 HP. With life giver only a bit more. It's not hard to stay above this threshold. 
---
&gt;There are no counters to this.
---
berry mentats or a cryolater. There is a counter.
---
&gt;as long as the person does not move, getting a kill against them is practically impossible
---
You stagger them and it pulls them out of sentinel. You use a crit, use a staggering perk, etc. Once staggered, there's a half second where they take full damage. That's when you get your damage in.
---
I kind of like how PvP is balanced currently since it's more strategic. I think blocker should definitely be buffed, but I'm not sure what other balance changes are truly necessary. Usually when I find someone I can't take down it's because there's a mismatch between build types. His build is perfect to kill mine and mine isn't set up to kill theirs. I think this mechanic is great since it challenges you to do PvP in teams of varied builds.
---
To your first point:
---
Bring back the Fallout 1/2 mechanic of being addicted to stimpacks.
---
Fix that *real* quick.
---
Why don't you make some suggestions for those who have a disability that renders them unemployable? Or someone who lost a job and can't find employment? If something stimulating and entertaining like gaming is off the table, then what do you suggest?  It's narrow to assume that someone who can't afford something shouldn't be allowed to do something they enjoy.
---
Take the story somebody posted here as an example. A guy tried to scam a trade from him, saying "you have to trust me". The guy had negative karma on a trade platform, so the poster obviously thought something was up. Eventually they agreed to place the items in bags a small distance apart, and OP didn't trust the guy saying "trust me" because of all the red flags and attitude the guy was sending up. So OP placed an inconsequential item in the bag. As they walked to each other's bags, the other guy called OP a "noob" implying he intended to scam him, then acted like a jerk and accused OP of "scamming him".
---
Of course mr. Untrustworthy had put a piece of junk in his bag as well. 
---
That's what I meant by "bad behavior"
---
Did you really just go all "REEEEEEEE" on me? That's hilarious. You're adorable
---
Easily after a SBQ fight, highly radiated/low health almost no stimpaks left and ran out of radaways, overencumbered and have most of your main weapons broken. Happened to me with 3 guys slapping me in my X01 with their auto weapons it didn't take em that long, i thought i could just ran away and stash my junk, obviously that didnt work out. Though these guys weren't smart, they should have bailed with my flux and hardened mass after they took me down but instead they got greedy and thought they could farm me for caps, sorry i just needed out of my PA, bloodied assassins/cavalier build got them farmed for their flux and caps.  
---
So anyone that does something you don’t like is an asshat?  Makes you wonder how many people think of you as an asshat.
---
My holy trinity of mats are screws, springs and gears. Gimme the option to craft those through plans, I’ll be happy.
---
I'd like in game text chat for consoles if possible. I have no mic and have to take myself out of the game to properly message people.
---
I'd also like to see them add crops. No reason slit beans aren't part of the regular crops.

I was using a 2S aim bonus laser rifle at max level, and it couldn't kill a single scorchbeast before breaking. They'll still be made of paper

---
Would be good if setting it forced you to disconnect and move to another server. That way users can't use it just to escape retaliation any more than just logging out would do.
---
no actual budget increase for camp but turrets and lights take up less but you will be restricted to how many you can use.
---
...restricting how many lights can be used? I...
---
depending on how this pans out, I may be done. I  was hoping for improvements to building (which is what I do as my end game) and this is just being more restrictive. I'll wait and see but this is not something to make me want to keep playing. sad. at least I enjoyed those almost 800 hours while it lasted. :/
---
It’s been like this in 3, 4 and NV as far as I know, this game however actually gets updated so who knows
---
That's what the harpoon gun is for!!!  Practice first on lvl 91 Death Claws and Yao Guai just make sure  he doesn't take you picnic basket.

You tell them don’t stand up for people hating you
---
&gt;From this post, I can gather you
---
 From this post, I can gather you have not yet fought somebody stacking 15-20 Stimpacks in a fight. As I said, your rifle is not going to outmatch so much heal. Way fewer Stimpacks are needed if combined with Sentinel Killer. I can ensure you, I have a lot of PVP experience in this game, I unlocked the 20 Kill achievement on day 1 and PVP (as well as collecting resources to maintain PVP resources and gear) is pretty much the only thing I do in the game at this point, as I have done everything else months ago. My group of players has pretty much all relevant weapons available across the group and regardless of Anti Armor or not, you will need a team focusing fire on a single target in order to outmatch spammed heals and you regularly need to spam heal as well, once your opponents do. Justifiying poor game mechanics by stating that there are things to make them slightly more bearable is not making the game better or wholeheartedly enjoyable. Reworking them does.
---
Spam heal is easy to outpace with damage. If it isn't, it's because your build sucks for PvP and you need a new build. 
---
Sentinel is easy to break. Every weapon can stagger with a crit. Most weapons have staggering perks. Chameleon has an easy counter. You just use a berry mentat or hit them with a cryolator/flamer/sacrificial blade so you get a frosted/burning/poisoned outline.You just need to learn how to counter everything.
---
It seems that the middle path to court different play styles is causing grief. With all due respect release PvP mode as planned and then remove all PvP initiation and player base damage from Adventure mode except for workshops. Much like the division dark zones you can conduct the majority of risk vs reward resource gathering here. 
---
Wonder if these buffs will affect the Gatling Gun, which already does decent damage (even more with the Martial Artist perk, which increases fire rate for some reason)
---
Do you need a certain level Of into to hack stuff? I just guess the first 3 and exit out and repeat. New to the game but fallout veteran. 
---
Lol what is this post supposed to do? 
---
Yes! A trade window where you only see what the other player has offered. It would speed up trading and prevent someone from losing an item they didn't see the other player requesting for zero caps.
---
I'm level 187 with close to 300 hours.  I've fought many other players, I lost some and won some.  Sometimes in self defense, others I attacked.  My house has been blown up more times than I remember ( 6 times during the beta alone ).  I've lost tons of resources from dying or rebuilds.  But I fought my way through all of it and the game experience was better for it.  Video games are supposed to challenge you, sometimes it's from another player being an asshole.  That's part of the experience.  
---
They need to touch base with the people who were banned. Period end.
---
I tried this, and it worked fine.. Until around level 60. Suddenly, I ased "Why am I not doing any damage? Why does it take 16 shotgun shells just to kill one ghoul? Why is my sniper rifle completely useless against the enemies I'm meeting that aren't in beginner zones? Why is everyone else in nuke zones mowing down enemies and I'm just trying to stay alive long enough to kill one?"
---
Because I role played and paid no attention to my build. So now, when levels are harder to come by, I have to slowly and patiently try to aggragate the cards I need to make things function.
---
It's not just hardcore players. It's players who have played and enjoyed the game and suddenly find themselves very frustrated after level 50. 
---
Though the damage output on the Alien Blaster would (taken the numbers we are given) still be abnormally low. 
---
The ‘griefers’ will not go to pvp servers, they can’t survive. The current system and rules are fully protecting them so they get to prey freely on the unprepared. 
---
There are buffs to Energy Weapons and there are buffs to Heavy Weapons. Exactly what buffs are applying to Flamers which are both?
---
Lol, whatever you say you dolphin gendered bastard
---
The martial artist affecting the gatling gun got fixed last patch
---
I agree with you.  The communication aspect of this game is poor if you don't have a mic. The Emotes just don't have enough detail to get the point across sometimes.  I don't know how many times I've dropped items for low level player and announced over the area mic about it and they don't even look at the bag.  Conversely, I've had folks walk up and try to trade but say nothing which makes me wonder about their motives.  If you want to trade have the courtesy of at least trying to get your point across before you start a transaction.   
---
Rest assured folks I'm not trying to paint a picture with a broad brush here.  I'm sure most folks are just trying to improve their character and not attempting some nefarious act.  What I'm trying to say is that the communication aspects of the game make it difficult for you to properly communicate with other players your intentions and add a level of distrust and suspicion.  Think about this.  If this was actual real life, you would walk up to someone, say hi, then ask if they want to trade goods.  You can do that to some extent with the emotes but I've seen that scenario play out all to end up with the seller being attacked once they see that they have "Junk" in my inventory that would make it worth the bounty they will incur. 
---
As for people who don't have mics (or don't have them turned on), that's your problem not the sellers. Just know that its going to be a little more difficult for you to gain someones trust with the equipment structure you're playing the game with. 
---
Ive seen so many people not reply to the question "What platform are you playing on?" Im just gonna guess that  a lot of it is consoles. Ive been on PC since the Beta, haven't been griefed once and my base is in the same spot since day one, never attacked once. I know griefing is def an issue but Im thinking its mostly on consoles. Having said that, I am all for PVE only servers.
---
Whats wrong with them? I've done them both since the last patch.
---
Happy cake day.
---
Hi thanks for the heavy/energy fix however will there be fix to the flamer fuel production rate ? As a fast firing weapon producing 5 ammo / craft Is way too low
---
I know you're slightly less new here than the other guy, but the up/down vote system for relevant comments is almost entirely ignored by Reddit users. 
---
They are far more likely to use it disagree with an opinion, or in your case point out the bitchy spouse tone of your original comment. Storming in. Makin some noise. Assuming your issue wasn't being addressed in this patch because it wasn't in the super comprehensive list that isn't a ITV post. 
---
It seems Bethesda rewards jerks like that because they get caps anyway and your junk. Last week this happened for the last time to a friend of mine. As I have built a squad that shreds through any jackass like those that attack people just to destroy bases and loot. Not true PVP players at all.
---
Boohoo. 
---
I blow up cars around the robots especially the sentry bots.  Their xps are basically 750 each and they store a lot of loot.  
---
What’s funny is it’s easier for me to blast a sentry bot than a Gutsy.  
---
Thanks for letting me know! :)
---
I would've left the server and found another.  It's a pain, but has worked once for me.
---
The budget hasn't been increased, the budget consumed by turrets has decreased. Either way, this is a welcomed change. I believe I saw that suggestion in this sub somewhere.
---
Makes me regret vendoring my 2 shot gatling plasma after the 2 shot nerf.
---
Challenge Tracker is nice but would it be possible to get it so that we can see what the daily/weekly challenges are in the main menu? I have two characters and sometimes it's nice to know what the challenges are for the day before deciding which one to play. 
---
Where is this?
---
I’m just saying it gets annoying to see hate about this game but yeah replying by calling me a dolphin gendered bastard makes sense lord knows you can’t treat people with respect anymore 
---
I found the x01 jetpack and one calibrated shock the same week. Haven't seen them since.
---
My buddy plays more than me and has never seen either. Weird how that works.
---
I"ll launch the nuke for you if you want, but you'll find it more gratifying to launch yourself.  I can help run you through Enclave &amp; Silo if you'd like.   GT is xx Dinkles xx
---
Juicehead....  you're kidding, right?
---
I too am big on the base building, and I pretty much think you hit the nail on the head. With the legendary vendor coming, people won't need another stash increase imo. Give us more budget. It only makes sense to do this considering the atom shop items push their revenue. I'm less interested in purchasing atom shop items if I have nowhere to put them. I bought the red rocket with real world money(over 500 hrs. I don't mind dropping $20)and at the moment, I'm not even using it. It's like 3 lights worth of budget, so at least this will maybe help with that 1 item for me.
---
 Some players are really good with camp building and significantly add to the ambience of the game world. There needs to be a way for those of us that want to focus on camps to do so. Whether that be through static perk cards or opting in some other way. Am excited to see how it all turns out in time. I don't blame Bethesda for being cautious after the launch issues. 
---
Question, do you have any ideas on when they're gonna work on armor piercing working with energy weapons? I know that we're getting a buff next patch, and all the info in the ITV isn't the final patchnotes, I'm just curious. 
---
Agree - I'm PC and I run area mic all the time. I pretty much play solo but like you I'm always will to trade and help out another player if I can TALK TO THEM. Seriously, it's not awkward or uncomfortable to speak. I'll work with any language issues the best I can and I'll still be glad to help.
---
If you see me speak - screen name is same as on here.
---
Yeah, I get that.  When I played WoW though, I stuck to one main and had a few alts only to support him.  I tend to get attached to the one I've put the most effort into, so I like that there will be a way to grow the character outside of meaningless levels and collecting perk cards I never intend to use (hey Woodchucker!).  I hope the prestige abilities are QoL improvements (higher stash limit, cheaper travel, crafting perks baked in, new skins) rather than combat or survival bonuses.
---
Yes. You can VATS target through them too.
---
I bet you where sitting on that info just waiting till you could say something lol
---
Inside the vault arent patch notes. They wont say everything fixed
---
I have, it's not very reliable though. Sometimes there are legendaries, sometimes there aren't. 
---
Should I do the most horrible thing possible and check the game's files whether this is possible?
---
Ugh, assholes will always find a loophole 
---
Yes. I'm an ass because I think people who cheat/dupe/exploit should be punished in a slightly harsh way? Missing the new content for a week seems more than fair. 
---
I love when cheaters try to take the moral high ground. 
---
When I am 72 I hope that I will still be gaming. My Grandmother did enjoy her Wii Bowling but there's no way she could play Fallout. You are my new hero!
---
also, once you are wanted, you stop seeing ALL other players on the map...but they can still see you..
---
Happy Cake Day FritoZanzibar! Today you are you, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is youer than you.
---
Pacifist doesnt stop someone from taking damage from others though lol
---
White knight makes it cheap to repair body armor and fix it good under intelligence will repair it to 200%, very helpful cards
---
Don't assume just because someone makes a mod, that it's safe to use.  While Bethesda hasn't come out against mods, they haven't endorsed them either (and I have no faith that they can absolutely prevent mods from being able to abuse the game).
---
I will say this - if a mod doesn't give you any significant advantage over other players, or in no other way exploits the game's intended functions, I wouldn't worry about it.
---
If the mod gives you a better looking map, changes the texture quality or recolors your armor, or reorganizes some of the mundane features (like sorting things differently in your inventory), I'm sure you're fine.
---
If the mod gives you a slight advantage, like highlighting rare or desirable objects to make them easier to see, or somehow 'sees into' a mob's inventory to tell you what it might drop (what it could drop, not what it has currently), I'd say you're probably OK, but those are a little grey.
---
If the mod highlights other players or reveals hidden players on your map (an advantage in PvP), shows you the contents of a locked box or a monster's current inventory/drops, or changes anything about a weapon's damage or hit chance, or adds/duplicates items...yeah, if a mod does any of that, I'd expect an incoming ban, and some quick changes to the code to prevent it happening again.
---
Yea it's important they don't fubar the server performance. I just don't want to see them offering great new ideas like detailing camps with world items, only to release them alongside a glaring fun block like camp budget limitation. &gt;.&lt;
---
In the end I don't think there are many gameplay-based solutions to this. I'm still 100% into the idea of a Roleplay Mode server type-- half the population cap (12 players max) but double the building budget.
---
Yeah do that in open PVP, fun times, try to spot and get close to some invisible guy to use any of those weapons, while he is shooting you. Let´s see how often you need to die, respawn at your camp in survival and get back there to find him. Oh yeah, right, he may change positions, good luck. Hey, even if you find him, he will just outheal your damage. I think you have not yet seen, how much damage can be healed with a build focused on tankyness and healing. Put power armor on to avoid the Stimpack animation and spam the fast heal key, with a build designed around it and no single rifle in this game will damage you significantly. Instead the opposing player will stare at your health bar, as any amount of damage dealt, is fully outspammed immediately.
---
All awesome to hear! Nice to see Adrenal is being fixed, any idea if there is something on deck for the spotty workings of Speed Demon? Seem to only work when it wants to.
---
They do not need to touch bases with anyone. 
---
These people were not innocent until proven guilty. 
---
They violated the ToS. BGS banned accordingly. 
---
I just hate to think of all the bloodied weapons I scraped when two shot and explosive were all the rage. 
---
There are a number of people, including myself, for which the quests 'broke' at some point, meaning they are no longer showing up to be done as Dailies.  For me it's been since December.  Using Heart as the example, the notes nor the terminal in Ft Defiance don't trigger the quest any more.
---
Laser Turrets can shoot through them too
---
oh wow!!! it is indeed, thank you!
---
time flies on reddit when you are posting at work hehehe
---
Yep, but that change will indirectly increase the camp budget in a way because if lights go from taking 2% budget each to 1% budget each well that can add up to a 10% increase in a way really quickly. Especially for people wiht 10+ lights. 
---
You literally can't do anything to them too. I seen them destroy the whole base, literally every part. They were there like 30 mins the base was destroyed and they took no bounty, no damage from player and nothing. All they did was go look for more bases and destroy them.
---
It's almost like I didnt read every single Beth replied comment ever. Or only peruse this sub on occasion. Or god forbid, didnt use the search function!!!
---
I'm just glad I got a definitive answer from someone who matters and not vomit string of condescending unhelpful comments from a bunch of neckbeards.
---
This is some kind of bug with their website, IMO. I get the same thing pretty frequently when I follow links to news updates-- the link will instead send me to the page for downloading the launcher. I have to hit refresh before it'll show me the actual page I should be looking at.
---
This is likely something Bethesda needs to investigate and fix, as it's happened to me several times in the last week. And I use firefox so it's not just an IE issue.
---
How often does that happen? I don't think I have ever met a downed player. I must say I am not specifically looking for other people though.
---
I thought it did, I seen people trying to shoot that guy and he was just emoting.
---
Seems better? Roughly the same damage hopefully and use less bullets? 
---
I've had days where I have to check that I hadn't swapped it out for another perk, due to it not looking like it's working at all. Then I get days where everything gets me extra meat. RNGesus at his best ;)
---
I hate that esp in whitespring. I'm wanting to help good robots kill monsters but they are one of the targets.
---
Also, quit losing ap each time we are hit 
---
Yeah they will fix the stealth if you go on reddit on post about inside the vault someone from Bethesda reply to someone asking for the same bug
---
Will this also affect the anti armor perk not reducing energy resistance? Right now anti armor on a laser gun does nothing for it.
---
You can always drop server and reload before much damage is done.  I've done this in the past to avoid people who only want PvP.  
---
It was your tone. 
---
You could have just asked 
---
"Will these two issues be addressed in this patch?"
---
But no, you went into illiterate Diana Ross mode. 
---
I'm so lonely...
---
Tank killer
---
Bloody mess
---
And just remember you can swap out those passive cards when you aren’t using them.  I ran around with weapons artisan loaded for about 35 levels until my dumbass realized I could just use it only when repairing weapons.
---
Without debating the rightness or wrongness of their actions, since it is allowed as the game stands, a group of 'raiders' saw a limping wounded mark and pounced and said mark, probably distracted by thinking about the fight/loot, did not immediately log out when it started.
---
The lesson being that everyone needs to ensure you have more than enough healing items for those events so you are less obviously a target.  FT'ing on a whim to a SBQ event is asking for trouble on many levels.  
---
If you don't take on the appearance of weakness, you are less likely to get treated like prey.
---
Its nice that in this case you were able to take advantage of their greed and punish them for their acts.
---
Good improvements but there is still nothing to do in end game. 
---
50-75% for two shot is ideal. 25-50% on explosive is also ideal.
---
The problem was frankly put: shotguns. Rather than balance the prime offender there was a blanket nerf that hurt everyone across the board. I still think two-shot could be 100% like original and it wouldn't be overpowered with explosive remaining reduced.
---
Is there an update on the Favorites Wheel hug where multiple weapons of the same type, but different prefixes, un-assign themselves?
---
Also, is there anything about the issue where periodically can't attack in melee until you switch to a different weapon and back?  Seems like it's related to getting staggered - the player's torso is just locked in a static pose.
---
You take a berry mentat and you use something with a high rate of stagger if they’re fighting outside of power armor. It’s easy to counter. If they’re fighting in power armor, they aren’t a serious PvP player and they’re going to die. PvP power armor builds are viable within a narrow range and are otherwise paper tigers to most builds 
---
It’s yellow because it’s a cold play 
---
 OK. You left out the poor oppressed deaf people. That usually rears its head sooner. ;)
---
Yup. Everyone talks about the ammo bug, but they forget it also has bugged damage. It never does as much damage as it says.
---
Its a more high stakes type of escort atleast, because the number of robots still alive at the end will correlate to what rewards you get at least
---
Thumbs up to that, I have only done two trades through game player trade mechanics, the other 2 or three have been floor drops.  Don't trade, borrow or buy from other players very often.  
---
&gt;  asshat players in this game that have no etiquette
---
no etiquette = being an asshat. u/flatwoods76 clearly doesn't have time for that junk, they need gear for #1.
---
&gt;Makes you wonder how many people think of you as an asshat.
---
I mean you for sure now, right? It's what I get for calling out greedy players usually.
---
That thing finishes the game for you
---
If it is then I hope it won't turn out like The Messenger where that shitty robot just stops midway and refuses to move anymore
---
You are correct.  We'll have more budget leftover from our current builds, since lights/turrets will cost less.  But the 'maximum' budget won't change, in that if I maxed my budget with 72 concrete foundations and a bed, I'll still be maxed out.
---
I've got 3 turrets currently, so I'm expecting a pretty decent jump in building ability. Although I may decide to go with a more mutant-proof concrete build, I haven't quite decided yet.
---
Any new on the bugs with creating/joining teams being fixed?
---
&gt; Melee, not overly powerful when up against an AA Handmade.
---
Especially if ambushed from a spot you cannot get to easily. You have to play to your strengths and exploit the weaknesses of your enemy. Spend the time working your way up to that roof before you engage the melee build. By the time they reach you, they are dead.
---
Melee person- damage reflect is your friend against ranged builds. Break line of sight while they take damage too. Make them come to you or disengage entirely. 
---
I agree with this because I imagine like every other ban wave in other games there are innocent people. Also they stated that they would un ban. Its only fair they give an idea of when. Im pretty sure there will always be dupe glitches.
---
Ahh. Perhaps that OP thought it was confirmed vs still investigating. Thank you for the clarification 
---
well whether it’s duped or not it’s still the same weapon, you wouldn’t be able to tell if ones duped or not (except for the tse with the exact same effects) it is possible to have these drop naturally, not very likely but still possible. if you get your hands on a tse from the marketplace and you suspect it may be duped, it won’t matter because it is extremely unlikely that you’ll get banned for having a duped weapon 
---
Not a fan, especially when the escorted gets in the way and fails the mission due to they're own actions. 
---
Are you *really* complaining about OP complaining about people complaining?
---
(complainception)
---
Can't you be hardcore and have a fun viable build?
---
My bloodied Bowie knife &amp; crossbow build fits nicely as a surviving mistress of mystery. 
---
And when I want to be "hardcore min/maxer" I can bust out a mole miner gauntlet or gatling gun/PA.
---
Yeah I do psn ? 
---
Tank killer in PER as well for the 36% armor pen, and 9% stagger chance. I think it's actually more important than maxed rifle perks.
---
Bloody mess in LCK gives a 15% dmg boost. Fireproof in End is almost necessary against SB sonic attacks and explosive player weapons.
---
As many levels as you can manage in Gunsmit in INT (mine's maxed at 5) will save you from having to repair your guns constantly.
---
If you want to run with mutations, you'll have to allocate an additional 5 points in LCK for max Starched Genes, and Class Freak.
---
Only my opinion, but if you were going to only add with the next 10 points, Tank Killer 3* and Fireproof 3* would be the most important, raise Gunsmith to at least 4*, and that would give you 2 more slots to play with. Maybe bloody mess for the 10% dmg add?
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who realizes this. 10% of 15 -20 dmg is laughable 
---

Pretty quick to assume, he didn't dupe just received duped items. 
---
You're probably just as salty because you've been perma banned. lmao. 
---
Get the stick out of your ass bubby.

I have all of those psn ?

---
Congrats dude this doesn't even pertain to you at all but I appreciate you going out of your way to serve justice lmao. I didn't do either and I don't really give a fuck about your opinion man. Thanks for automatically assuming shit.
---
Pretty neato! keep up the good work my guy!
---
I mean...if a guy wants to squat invisbly in the corner of whitesprings to get a kill every 30 mins is that really so bad?
---
You first complete multiple set up steps and then escort the parade through town. The "escort mission" is only a fraction of it so labeling it as such is a little disingenuous. 
---
This act was/is harassment and you should be able to report them and get them banned from the game.
---
I don’t get this either. Made a comment a while back where I got trashed from fanboys with downvoting because they seriously accused me of lying when I was telling I’d been killed/ grie*ed by slap damage, because to them it wasn’t possible anymore after the patch where bobblehead stacking got fixed. But it still is and it drives me nuts... from the start on this system with the „minimal damage“ you get from being attacked is plain stupid. WHY not no damage at all? Would be working the same way to initiate pvp, just without the possibility to being grie*ed 
---
Uhh so what? It would be trivial to implement if they wanted to offer players that feature. 
---
Thankyou! We have plenty more stuff like this planned!
---
Honestly 5 ranks of endurance with ironclad for the +50 boost isn’t really worth it in my opinion. You could re allocate those perks to better endurance cards like solar powered for the melee boost in your secondaries and also carry capacity during the day. When you hit 50 you could even move endurance special around. 
---
Wait what does dolphin gendered even mean or stand for?
---
Why don't we all wait until Tuesday when the patch is released and we get the full patch notes rather than the tiny little snippet they put in the ITV
---
There is a push-to-talk bind, at least on PC (don't have a console to check).
---
I don't usually run with voice on (very rarely), but I set that up first thing just in case.  Mine's bound to middle-mouse, since I don't need that to switch to 3rd person (V works fine for that).
---
Also, I dropped using a shotgun. You can get more consistent "oh sh*t" damage when mobs hordes close with a  decent melee weapon without the added weight/perk requirements.
---
What was the Adrenal Reaction fix / issue?? I've had that mutation locked in with Scorched Genes for a while?! I never even paid attention?!?
---
Then u can’t turn it on and off at will maybe a box u would need to talk to to do it would work tho
---
He was taking 5 damage with each hit.
---
not anymore supposedly. during the whole TSE update and removal of dupes they removed that from the item creation options when drops are rolled, they stated this in one of their announcements that TSE wouldnt roll together (that being said i remember it being said specifically for like the flamer, cryolator, and tesla, but dont remember if it was just those or all of them). I know since updates ive only found either one or the other, never both. 
---
[There was a discussion at Bethesda forum](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/324830/did-they-break-stealth/25) where some felt stealth was broken but some didn't, including myself.  Someone posted gameplay video of stealth shooting at West Tek and I saw nothing untoward.  Stealth is still the same for me as it has always been.
---
Someone had to find it to dupe it originally so SOMEONE found one at some point. As for me personally, that's a no for me dawg. I  have found a furious powerfist, that's the best legendary I have found so far.
---
No.  Workshops should still be contestable.  Someone goes to take it from you and your choice is either to enter PvP and defend it OR the ownership reverts to the challenger after the challenge timer expires.  Simple.
---
Now, claiming and contesting a workshop shouldn't automatically bring teammates into PvP mode, just the players that opted into it.  If you are on a team and they don't defend you (no hits fired at workshop contenders) then it is just you and the contender.   No more setups where a whole team is targeted by just because one person is farming acid or some such thing.  If the teammates choose to defend you or choose to retaliate, that should be their option.    PvP could be so much more nuanced and more fun so that people can choose when to participate versus choosing "holy crap I have too many loose screws on me to screw around with this nonsense".
---
False.
---
I'll send it to you in a message
---
One reason why I do not have turrets of any sort. Not a full solution as I can think of ways around it. However, if I am at my base when it happens and I am not with friends, I will just swap servers. It means nothing to me to do that but removes the fun that the griefer is getting.
---
Finally some love for energy/heavy weapons to bring variety, could always use more events too. Keep up the good work!
---
Oooh. +10% damage boost! Now my high tech, ultra advanced laser rifle will do 40 points of damage.
---
Hey Bethesda, energy weapons need to be doing far more damage than ballistic weapons. Stop pretending to balance this game and start making it fun. 
---
...and it wont be until mid summer.
---
Yeah!
---
I was super pleased to get a TSE Handmade after a last minute decision to run through a Whitesprings nuke zone. 
---
Granted, it was after they nerfed them, but it's still cool to have!
---
Oh I'm sorry I didnt pre-package my frustrations into a nice chicken tendy shaped comment for you guys to easily digest. FFS with you guys lol.
---
Instead of a cooldown for stims, I'd like the hp regen to be slower so you have to spend time recovering. 
---
I'm glad to hear this.  I don't mind PvP for keeping a workshop that is being challenged, but I should have a pacifist option of just letting the workshop be taken over by the person that wants it without being dragged into a battle.  If I choose to defend it, then it is open season on me and me alone.  My teammates should not be dragged into PvP automatically.   They should be able to choose to help or not as they see fit.   Player choice and not being forced into PvP would make for a much more fun game mechanic to play around with.  The people that disagree with are the ones that want to steal players junk hoping that they have a bunch of valuable stuff on them.   Letting the player choose how to respond should be the de-facto standard.
---
Yep hence the "indirect" for most people they will see a small bump in what they can build for some they will not get any change. 
---
They did mention “a bunch of bug fixes, with full patch notes on patch day”. Patience.
---
That arguably makes it worse. XD
---
Maybe they should let you build a safe space at your camp. You could have rad puppies, rad kitties, and a Grognak coloring book. Then when you start feeling like you should post about how unfair life is, you can go sit in your safe space instead. 🙂
---
I'm playing right now, feel free to join me. PSN Mootsmcboots
---
Then maybe just change it so the Retake Event is instead a publicly advertised Event that everyone could jump on and snag before you. It would actually give us more reason to jump back and defend them, because otherwise anyone could snag the Workshop from you really easily.
---
I’m a pretty hardcore player, I have a sniper build, a melee build.  I also had a pistol and no power armor build, until I realized how under utilized pistols are in endgame, although having the alien blaster shooting little blue spheres is pretty cool and different; it does next to no damage. 
---
&gt; Oh yeah, right, he may change positions, good luck. Hey, even if you find him, he will just outheal your damage. I think you have not yet seen, how much damage can be healed with a build focused on tankyness and healing
---
I literally 2 tap people who try this.
---
&gt; Put power armor on
---
lol
---
I'm up for joining in. Just let me know what time EDT. GT: TheSlaptyback
---
War drum and Guitar sword aren't unarmed, the Death Tambo is decent but I know there are good unarmed weapons but literally like 2 that are really good. More variety would be nice is all I'm saying.
---
Very good issue this week, as someone who is already a heavy weapons build this is excellent news for me, extra CAMP space since lights wont take up as much room now and just today i was wishing how i could mark the challenges on my map to do
---
Power Armor has no Stimpack animation, you can activate Stimpacks as fast as you can press the fast heal key, what does not kill you in 1 hit, will not kill you at all. With the right build, power armor will have similar % reduction as a killer set, while also providing almost limitless heal. The heal is really limited to how quickly you can press the button and the amoutn of Stimpacks you are willing to use. Your balance does not exist.
---
I find it amusingly clueless, that you say Chameleon counters VATS in the context of a melee opponent, yeah, sitting still will CERTAINLY help against someone who needs to get close. Definitely. Stealth Boys counter melee VATS spam, not Chameleon. By the way, you can actually ask yourself, is PVP full of constantly invisible people fun? I don't think so. 
---
There is another clueless statement from you in regards to the damage exploit, as your bloodied weapon can certainly not 1 hit kill people outside of combat by regular means, which is what takes place currently. Aside from that, some people do not even require to be on low HP to deal so much damage, it is clearly not some sort of intended game mechanic.
---
Justice lol. 
---
I'd love to hear why a non impacted player would be concerned about the suspended accounts of dupers/cheaters/exploiters?
---
dogs barking in background, mom yelling at the kid to clean up their room, eating potato chips while on open mic.... 
---
what?  did I say workshops shouldn't be contestable?  I said you shouldn't be able to claim a workshop in pacifist...
---
I enjoy doing this to the White Spring turret camps it can be tricky getting ghouls to follow you up stairs but worth it.
---
there should just be a cooldown to turn it back on after turning it off
---
Absolutely magnificent🤩
---
Nothing in that activity is related to Pacifist in any way shape or form.  
---
You can drag creatures to player camps without Pacifist.
---
You can take only slap damage from other players without Pacifist, so long as you do not return fire.
---
I think theres also one in the basement of the mothman museum
---
All of these things are great to hear. I honestly wasn't expecting "We're just flat out making camp budget bigger", but not having 50% of it being taken up by a few turrets and lights is very welcome. Can't wait for Fasnacht.
---
I'll help.
---
Asshats are here to stay, we're in your game, deal with it instead of trying to make it fair.  I like it that way because I'm as asshat too.
---
You certainly 2 tap idiots, but that´s about it.
---
PS: NO GRIEVING OR HARMING OTHER PLAYERS. There can be accidents, but I want to help other players. If you join, there will be some benefits, including companionship. All levels allowed to join, but at least one level 30 or higher player. Reply to this comment if you're interested.
---
It was recently proven that even nuclear vehicle explosion chain reactions still only deal 5 slap damage.
---
I'm 1000% okay with the removal of Whitespring turret camps. :-)
---
I like Captainoob. Some good reviews of guns and things. 
---
&gt;also you shouldn't be able to take workshops in pacifist
---
I think you should be able too.. it just should turn off pacifist mode?  And you have to wait like 10 mins to be able to toggle it back on.
---
That's micist.
---
 I'll only speak to someone through a series of emotes, mic or no.
---
The AAE does more damage against more heavily armored creatures such as super mutants, deathblows, etc. so go with that.
---
thanks for this 
---
This is why I role play as a BoS Knight. I can be both a hardcore, ultra optimized build that absolutely wrecks everything in the game, but I scream "AD VICTORIAM!" while shoving the barrel of my Bloodied .50 Cal Machine Gun down the throat of every abomination I see.
---
Can't wait for PvP servers so I can accost strangers and demand supplies for the Brotherhood.
---
Other than the BOS one what are the other two you can make? How much are they? I’m interested &amp; I’m on PS4
---
Right? Like just make them separate, because there's clearly two separate communities here that are at odds with each other about how things should work. They've said we'll be able to switch freely between Adventure and Survival, so why not just fully implement that as "non-PvP" and "unrestricted PvP".
---
Starched (Level 2!) will definitely prevent you from losing mutations to Decon arches.  I run Starched 100% of the time and walk through the decon arch at my house and the one at Enclave bunker multiple times a day, never lost a mutation.
---
I think the issue is that the griefer is doing it during times when everyone is at a nuke event or something not paying attention. I loaded to the server and seen  that he had a trail of monsters. yao gui, mirelurks, Scorced, robots and he was in power armor laughing at their damage. 
---
I'm fine with everything perceived wrong in fallout 76. BoS, supermutants, needing flux for things things like power armor mods, the nonsensical pip boy being less advanced than models from the same geographic region.  The hundreds of nukes being fired off on a daily basis that would destroy the world.
---
Anything and everything is because it’s not real, just a memory lounger simulation.
---
Cate is that you?
---
XBox.
---
i literally just logged off from the most infuriating session because of exactly this. i've taken a workshop, i am modding a chest armor (need my dailies, right?) and i get one-shotted. i sit there in shock, listening to this dude and his friends dividing up my junk, then respawn. i live again long enough to climb into my power armor, and get one-shotted again, by the same dude, having done nothing to engage him. 
---
thoroughly pissed now, i respawn again, equip the strongest weapon i have (auto grenade launcher), sneak up around the workshop and start raining fire down on the bastards. i survive for a few seconds, get killed, then have to listen to these assholes talk about how surprised they were that i came back, and what a loser i am for attempting to take them on. 
---
i have been defending this game since it came out. i still believe it's a good game, but gods DAMN do i hate the people who play it. 
---
Buncha whiny cowards.  It’s fallout online what did you think it’d be.  What fallout game doesn’t have npc’s trying to kill you, actively hunting you.  Y’all need to toughen up stop whining and learn to survive in the wasteland.
---
It would still be a good time to push out the boundaries a bit. I imagine there will be some new players with the updates, and they will get ideas when they learn about whitespring. Horrible, misguided ideas.
---
I think that's true but the other problem is that if you're not paying attention they can literally destroy your base with no consequences. 
---
More INT makes less choices appear pretty sure.
---
Have you considered a public issue tracker? Example:
---
https://developers.google.com/issue-tracker/
---
We can likely guess where one will be...Hey, WS jackass, I'm looking out the back of the clubhouse and laughing at your turret farm!  
---
Not you, OP.
---
Am learning to just accept it and do what you are suggesting .. Cause when I instantly server hop I forget their names .. 
---
Please tell me that these new no-build areas include the area behind the golf course clubhouse. 
---
That was great! Hope to see more stuff like this in the future.
---
Bethesda can just simply disable your camp passive mode if you plant it in any objectionable spots.
---
if someone is "Wanted", they should not have access to Pacifist mode, full stop. 
---
Because any feature that allowed for identification but also allowed us to openly share the pics wherever would probably be open to hacking. It's not a simple thing in implementation if Bethesda wants any say in what we would post on the walls.
---
 That says nothing of the fact that Bethesda would have to host all of these pics and screen them for content.
---
Yeah I kill the sentry bots for the fusion cores 
---
You can also wire through them!
---
I like to wear a vault tech jumpsuit or power armor, and meet new players outside the vault. Before they come out I drop a bunch of low level gear, chems, and food, then pretend to be an NPC.
---
When they come out I do the wave emote and yell "happy reclamation day!" and usually follow it up with something about how vault tech thanks them for their patronage, and to accept these gifts from vault tech. Then repeat the same lines over and over until they leave.
---
I don't think anyone had really bought it, but it makes me smile. 
---
Glad you enjoyed it! We plan on doing some more videos soon!
---
Can people join the community?
---
Hi man, we need to get you back in the game
---
my PSN id is FritoZ, hit me up anytime, we can do whitesprings loot and junk runs server hopping and should be able to get you back in caps no problem
---
i can share some ammo as well, i run melee on one of my chars so she never uses ammo, got a nice stockpile built up
---
I think what I mean is you can't do anything to them because they're in passive mode. If they weren't than you can just kill them. 
---
I don't think they meant anywhere a camp overlaps with a quest area. I think it's more about areas that are going to be used for future quests that having a camp in the middle of would interfere with it. Also probably places where people build their camps in order to exploit, like a golf club turret base.
---
Basilisk always has a lot of people online. Legends is even more populated, but I prefer pre-CU. I recently started playing on Empire in Flames which is less populated, but hosts weekly events, lots of roleplay and has a great playerbase. Of all the servers I've tried, EiF is the most fun.
---
Sadly I'm the rare HetroBear. All plump and furry and married to a lovely lady. 
---
I'm sure once your cocoon opens in spring you will emerge a glorious leather daddy and find a twink to love!
---
Seems like a suuuper easy fix, just mark off more of it as an "existing build location" so people can't Camp so annoyingly close.
---
People generally have multiple characters tailored to different builds. They just start a new game, yes :).
---
We will be opening up recruitment soon! I'll be sure to let you know when we do!
---
My other post is how the hell do you use advanced power connectors smh 
---
That's what I thought also but I think it would be good to have some clarification on it.
---
It depends. Are you on PS4, over 18 years old, and into RP?
---
What a dick. I'm of the opinion that if there were more quests or just something to *do*, people wouldn't get bored so quickly and resort to being a complete asshole as a means to entertain themselves.vcvc
---
    
---
Sorry that happened to you, dude.
---
I'm perfectly okay with this.  Workshops are pvp zones essentially.
---
Please do through a PM if you can remember. Finding RP was all I ever wanted in fo76
---
In my experience with MMOs, week long holiday quests are all chore quests dressed festively. Which I don't mind. I love doing dailies personally. Finding how to do one thing super efficiently is kinda my shit. 
---
good point hahahah .. "You ever had you shit pushed in " #trainingday
---
 I kill it on  a regular basis. I get acid among other things. ;)
---
Why is that not a popular opinion?
---
I'll wait till I try it before I write it off. Could be a fun! 
---
I followed you on here so I can find you again :)
---
Like if you go AFK for a couple of minutes to take care of, *ahem*, something.
---
yeah this is great way to get lead! good call
---
And whatever bulk stuff you just used all up crafting with.
---
Me!  I'm kidding, my videos are terrible, infrequent, and certainly not informative. 
---
Well, comparable damage.  But hey I want to be able to shoot lazers at things, even if it's not the same thing as my more damaging weapons at least I can fire off more than one Fusion Cell before it breaks!
---
It's still going strong though! Just started playing last week and am having a blast
---
...maybe you should actually read the definition of Pacifist 🤣 being one doesn't make you untouchable, quite the opposite
---
You are forced into pvp, but it doesn’t force pvp in general.  In two hours of gameplay, if I have at least three workshops, at least one gets attacked by a player.  This is a rough estimate though.  Sometimes the server is dead and I’m lucky.  Generally, when I’m attacked, the player keeps coming back or waits for me to retake the workshop.  Players can fast travel in when I’m defending, hide and then one shot from behind making it insanely easy to pvp a lower level player.  If you are experiencing something different, I can only assume that you aren’t using workshops as much as “the rest of us” or your build is more imposing than “the rest of us.”
---
Exactly, shouldn't have to server hop to play the game the way it was intended...
---
I have several characters for player Vendor Activities, weight limits make this a necessity.
---
Sgt. Gunny: Sells Shooty, Sticky, Slicey, Choppy, Pokey, Burney, Freezy &amp; Wackey things.
---
Blacksmith: Sells Armor, to protect against all the stuff Sgt. Gunny sells
---
Nurse Red: (My naughty nurse) sells all sorts of Aid, To Heal you from all the stuff Sgt. Gunny sells
---
The Professor: Sells Plans &amp; Magazines
---
Mr. Ed: Is my work Horse, Please don't call him a mule, he is trying to lose weight, and if everyone would buy more stuff it would help a lot.
---
My main Character carries several outfits so I can dress for whatever occasion seems appropriate, since the ritual Bindings seem to scare newbies, I sometimes wear a Tuxedo, which they find more friendly looking.
---
i dont know, that 3 acid workshop by the water park really helped me when i was low on acid
---
Bethesda seems to disagree

I had [caution] inside interiors where no enemies can spawn (unless you anger them, which I hadn’t). The issue is that it gets stuck. 
---
I agree. It could go either way. Trying to stay optimistic. We’ll see when it’s released. 
---
Working here with radstags with all of the eccentricities of rng in place.
---
The block from session option is similar in that you can block an entire team, then have a friend in a party tell you where that team is at and attack them in stealth and they'd never know where you are but your friend can relay their positions to you.
---
It's a griefer tactic nonetheless, an antigrief mechanic used to grief...
---
Another way is to farm tin cans at raider/ super mutants camp, 2 iron and 1 lead each
---
youre right - you wrote unarmed and my brain defined it as melee.
---
Its what I get for staying up way too late playing this game last night, and getting up way too eary to come to work ...and read these threads :)
---
Darmok and Jilad, on the ocean.
---
Yes that makes complete sense and I'm totally aware of how paranoid conspiracy theory it sounds. But.. my point was it's weird that those people: *get up* (let's go with that but it wasn't my point) at the same moment because that's the time that time zone sets their alarm for. Then they all log onto Reddit at the same moment and look at this thread at the same time because that's the amount of time it takes for them to perform those actions, read my comment and reply to it 2 minutes apart each time. It's just weird and stinks of one person spamming from alts, which I've seen before (not on this sub). Never mind though. It's just a thought.
---
What is your PSN?
---
I think I just found someone else who built two left arms of utracite power armor.
---
Same here just have a build or random perk's does mine does what I need 
---
His arms.  Open.
---
 I can do BoS Heavy Combat Arms and Legs for that one guy in your group. ;)
---
It's going to be fixed in the next release on the 12th.

Damn right it's still happening .. I never engaged and when the Jackass is Spam hitting me I have to Stim pack to get myself enough time to get the hell out of dodge.   This shit ain't even "raiding" cause after my first death I don't have anything on me of value to you.. WHY the hell are you still on my nut sack ? You know I don't have anything!!  
---
Don't worry we'll remember! -Proctor Rivelli of the Woldpack
---
I actually haven't noticed assholes as much, I find that most players are totally cool. You might want to consider building your house in a remote location.
---
Yes and then players create post like "Remove PVP","I am being bullied","Beth lets 'Bullies' rule their servers", "Pacifist should make me invincible","PVP has no place in Fallout"- instead of actually trying to learn the game.
---
Hardcore players be like:
---
I'm still banned for having too much ammo.
---
Got a medics exploding laser rifle the night before they removed exploding laser weapons. Was super happy until I learned it would break in literally one magazines worth of ammo. Now it just sits in my stash, taking up space and taunting me. 
---
SaltySpitoon187 I added you on wrong account srry 
---
Haha yeah we have it all! Just wanted to vary the outfits a little! But thankyou anyway!
---
If they weren't in pacifist mode, then you wouldn't know, unless they returned fire or actually shot the camp. 
---
To be honest this is basically true. There is a big issue with these type of people that have bad behavior that enjoys ruining other people's day for no reason at all which goes to show that there are problems in this world with the issue of sin. I already went through this same problem before but honestly, I find it really crazy that you would lose so much caps unfairly after being defeated by someone that wants to PVP. Honestly it is very toxic and Hopefully, the new PVP mode that is being created will be in DLC 1 and also will take away the whole PvP problem out of the category of PVE. I'm not the type of player that really enjoys PVP in Fallout 76 and I really find it more fun to play along aide other players against the real hostile which are the mutants and monsters alike in the wasteland. Survival games are better off being PVE and focus more on making the battlefield against monsters more enjoyable. Going against another player is a gamble, to be honest, and especially against players that focus more on being melee built. Which needs to be nerfed right away if a player in power armor could easily abuse these abilities and take advantage over other people which is also unbalanced and unfair. I tried PVP yesterday and the only thing that really got me upset was losing Caps on that behalf which was plain idiotic. Bethesda if you are taking the time to read this, Please understand and consider that there are those that enjoy Players vs NPC and players that enjoy Players Vs Players when it comes to open world survival games.
---
You should have made PVE and PVP separated from the start at release. Please take consideration of this. Players Vs Environment Vs Players will never work, it would just make things worse.
---
As a "plant-arranger" (guilty as charged), I'm with you on this one. All in, or all out. Provide a mode for both player types. Truly separate the two modes.
---
Hallelujah! Thank you :)
---
Comically enough if the basic servers were full PVP you'd have a lot less griefing instead of this stupid fucking slap system. Anyone would have told them that this system gives griefers a tool rather then a restraint. 
---
When the PVP mode rolls out the other mode should be strictly no PVP, since there's no casual overlap. 
---
I have the same worry.
---
In that case this patch is the best patch ever with the new content, energy/heavy buffs and this fix.
---
Is the actual season in-same going to change? 
---
Yes.  You said that you shouldn't be able to claim a workshop in pacifist.  I disagree with that and provided the mechanism I would like to see.
---
Perhaps it is a semantics problem:   Pacifist mode shouldn't prevent someone from taking your workshop.  Pacific mode shouldn't prevent someone from attacking you for trying to take their workshop.  These things I would 100% agree with.   The blanket statement "you shouldn't be able to claim a workshop in pacifist" is wrong and I explained what I would like to see. 
---
There is room for people that don't want to be hassled with PvP (pacifists).  These people may on occasion decide they want to do something that would open them up to PvP (taking a workshop, stealing from another workshop, challenging an already owned workshop) and thus they enter PvP during that time.   It doesn't turn their pacifist off, but they can be PvP'd while they are in one of these statuses.   It was their choice and by making it convenient for them to enter into those PvP situations without having to turn it off and turn it back on, they would be more tempted to give it a try sometime.  They might even like it.   Pacifist mode should NEVER allow someone to enter PvP and then turn on Pacifist to get out of it... if a person triggers an active PvP session and turns on Pacifist, that Pacifist shouldn't take effect until whatever PvP session was triggered has completed and THEN Pacifist takes over... or at least if they disconnect or server hop then the PvP engagement that they started to partake in is properly broken.    
---
TL;DR:  There is a way to PROPERLY balance pacifist and pvp within the context of the game so that pvp is purely opt-in and ONCE it has been opted into, it pacifist won't save you from the consequences of your actions when you triggered the PvP session.  Only AFTER the PvP session is over will the Pacifist protect you again.   (Example: Contesting a workshop, Defending a workshop, Stealing from a locked container, etc.)  While a Pacifist who has a workshop could be challenged for ownership and they would have to choose to fight / defend or allow the ownership of the workshop to carry over to the challenger.   
---
It all boils down to choice.     
---
No. Energy weapons need to do more damage than ballistics. Why would a war-like, high tech society like the U.S. before the war make energy weapons if they are less effective than hitting someone with a pipe wrench? If energy weapons suck ass, then they would simply build catapults that throw pipe wrenches at their enemies. They built laser weapons and plasma weapons because those weapons are devastating. 
---
Bethesda needs to stop balancing this game against some MMO game theory bullshit and work toward making the mechanics fit the lore. It's **terrible** game design.
---
Shaka!  When the walls fell!
---
What if , for example a pacifist claimed a work shop ,PVP could only happen with in the bounties of the work shop.  There is no unclaim... and if said player dont show up to contest /PVP , then its yours.
---
That eliminates have to toggle pacifist on and off and keeps griefers looking to exploit the contest mechanism in line.
---
Knowing how to play the game doesn’t make someone a ‘hardcore’ player. 
---
I signed up for what was advertised, a fallout experience.  This was negligently that at best.  That's called false advertising, no one signed up for that.
---
Antigriefer mechanics (That griefers use to their advantage!)
---
A world 4 times the size of Fallout 4's (and 4 times as empty as well!)
---
Multiplayer mode that's balanced (so that players can one hit kill each other with slap damage with certain builds.)
---
I could go on, I'm sorry you don't understand though, so I won't bother wasting more time explaining things to the equivalent of a brick wall.
---
I agree \*IF\* it is optional.  Let people have that sound effect if they want.  I would keep it turned off, for me, but by all means let it be an option for others to play with.
---
No. They aren't underarmor like the protective suits.
---
I don't believe so. However you can get BoS fatigues that can. They look similar, but are grey and black.
---
Will there ever be new content?
---
Fun or not; I want those masks! 
---
Ok thx for this, I left concentrated fire on 1 in order to take glow sight² and swap dodger for sneak in agi. I really want to have 3 endurance at least for adamentium skeleton or fireproof 3* ( depends on the situation) so i take tormentor 3 * with the 3 remaining stats points .  Anyway thx , your advice was very helpful. 
---
This perfectly mirrors my build. I didn't die, so success!! Also, now that I hear about all these builds, can I get a re-do on perk cards at L26.
---
Did you not see the roadmap two weeks ago?
---
yeah i have those shielded..just wondering because it is considered under armor and u can wear under other outfits
---
The prestige system will probably work like this.
---
Survival Server.
---
Hahah all good I feel you, one-handed and two-handed has a nice variety of weapons to have fun with, came across a bone club a few days ago. I think it's a Scorched arm or something it's pretty interesting.
---
I read that it’s type of mantis shrimp or something like that. 
---
I mean the thousands of resources is probably a bit exaggerated. Also most of those resources aren't priority resources like screws, springs, ect. It doesn't take that much to repair the camp. If the resources are to much you can move the camp and the stuff will be repaired. 
---
yea it would be terrible if people actually came back to the game...
---
GT?
---
Oy, I'm more tired of the "bullies!?!" posts, in a much shorter time, than I was with the whiny banned duper posts after the last patch.
---
What are you looking for and what type of stuff are you looking to sell?
---
Guess I don’t need all those orbital strike beacons anymore 
---
Made me laugh.  I'm one of the hardcore and you pretty much nailed it (but no mention for my heavy weapon specialist!?!)
---
I feel ya.
---
People who wanna trade and/or follow me around all the time without talking kinda creep me out to begin with.
---
Well hopefully the new survival servers coming up will eradicate the b holes
---
I use it to check out what players are doing, then exit it to help protect them from other players or npcs on missions, then reenter it and continue my personal guard duties.
---
Yeah, what a concept, helping randoms enjoy the game instead of hurting them.  I must be a fucking monster or something in GTA.
---
Ok that's sounding more like a blocking offence. I was like *What? Blocked for being buggy?!*
---
Did it stop after you blocked them?
---
Dude. You got 800 hours of entertainment out of the game. If you don't like the changes or think they aren't coming fast enough just put the game down and play something else for a while.
---
Can I offer him 250 caps to let me kill him and get a screenshot?  Sounds like  a win-win at that point?    (I kid, just messin' with you... enjoy your bounty hunter hunting revenge thingy)
---
This is true - Problem is If you have tweaked your camp in a Difficult building area - You cant get it exactly placed just perfect again in some instances .. So this option Sucks for me - I just drop servers as fast As I can and reload to see the dmg done!!! Oh man the Rad Showers!!! .. I gotta re think having 3 of them for cosmetics .. cause it sucks rebuilding them!!
---
That I did not know!
---
But it opens up some interesting new opportunities imo. \^\^

---
I may have but cant really remember.  I quit a couple months ago and check back in once in a while to see if theres new content.  One can only slay the entire game so many times haha.
---
In a workshop scenario? Sure, okay. Outside of that, I'm in full-PVE 'Lone Wanderer' mode most of the time. And when I'm with friends, we want to use that time to explore and combat \*PVE\* enemies; not fend off bored ass-bags deliberately hacking at us, tossing grenades, blocking quest objectives, etc for whatever goofy reason they do so.
---
Do you have a TSE shotgun?
---
That particular problem has occurred to me too, but rarely, and it occurred even before the recent patches, even in Fallout 4 (maybe 3 too).  But now some are saying that *stealth itself* is broken, to the point where they want to move to a non-stealth build like the OP said.
---
"Behind every successful raider, is a former noob who built himself up"
---
Uhm literally every every networked application is "open to hacking" to one degree or another but I'd be interested in what specific vulnerabilities you think there would be in a modern digital signature algorithm that would somehow trick their servers into permitting a user to upload and subsequently serve unsigned images.
---
Also, yeah they'd have to host the images but it isn't 1999 anymore. Storage is dirt cheap, bandwidth is dirt cheap. They don't have a huge playerbase to begin with and it would be easy to implement a cap on uploaded images if it were really a concern.
---
As far as filtering for content, if they're only allowing images generated by their binaries, why would they even have to screen them for content? I mean at worst they'd be screening images of paper bags arranged into penises. Big deal.
---
RCInvictusX
---
Yeah I think when u have high tier items like  Rad purifiers, all crafting stations, those electric generators, water purifiers, terminals, lights, turrets and so on. It can add up but maybe thousands is too much it's a lot though lol. Also if u move it like I seen this done with junk extractors won't you lose that also?
---
This can't be good for the shoulder. 
---
whats there to argue its def broke. its not always broke but it happens.
---
I think one of the design reasons behind no Legendary PA is that Bethesda is trying to establish a solid baseline for player stats for end game content.
---
It's not working out to well at present, but hey this game is allowed to have one or two bugs in it right &lt;/s&gt;
---
So, my theory is that for fighting the Queen we were always supposed to fight in the Blast Zone with full radiation.  Learning how to fight outside the zone was not considered.
---
Based on that, the developers could say End Game content/raids will take place in a Radiation zone.  Therefore players must be in either PA or Hazmat suits.  Knowing that, then they do not need to worry about their content being trivialized by Min-Maxed Legendary builds (I'm looking at you full suit of Sentinel!)
---
So, while getting Legendary PA would have a cool factor, its probably not best for game longevity.
---
Platform? 
---
Thanks, If that were what subOP tried to say, then it still is irrelevant as it'd indicate his message to be mocking me for wanting it easier for myself, when in reality all I want is to reduce the overall amount of whining. Its also worth noting I am 100% PvP focused. 
---
What kind of legendary effect?  Like 2 shot tickle fart?  
---
One of the most useless weapons in the game.  Commie whackers do nearly the same damage, if not more,
---
I'm a high level player and have dealt with this nonsense as well. It sucks.
---
Your arguments are farflung scenarios that spit in the face of more plausible, probable, and possible situations that far outweigh you trolling other players.
---
Example: Not many people will be even looking for grahm, if you trap him you first off undo your camp, pay to trap him, then lose him upon leaving the server.
---
Not to mention this isn't russia, you think you're extorting players but really they can fast travel to their own camp and leave, server hop and spawn in the same area, and also call in their buddies to gank you and your little grahm prison to access him and get some caps off of you.
---
And the same applies to your camp trapping methods.
---
&gt;Power Armor... what does not kill you in 1 hit, will not kill you at all.
---
Not really. You just need something with high DPS. There's alot of trade offs with PA since they don't have legendary effects and you can't have the dense torso mod. That trade of comes with higher DR/ER/RR. PA is easily destructible, so the advantages you get are pretty short lived. It's not hard at all to kill people in PA and PA just isn't very viable in PvP. Plus seeing people's power armor fall to pieces in the middle of a PvP fight is one of the most gratifying things.
---
&gt;I find it amusingly clueless, that you say Chameleon counters VATS in the context of a melee opponent, yeah, sitting still will CERTAINLY help against someone who needs to get close.
---
There's so many counters to chameleon and stealth. I mentioned berry mentats, the cryolator, anything that sets you on fire, and a machete with a poison mod. All of them increase visibility. Melee is hindered the most by anything with invisibility. It's a tactic, but it's easily defeated by the beforementioned counters as well as anything with a high rate of fire or area of effect. Explosives are viable (especially mines and nuka mines/grenades), heavy weapons are viable, shotguns are viable, etc.
---
&gt;By the way, you can actually ask yourself, is PVP full of constantly invisible people fun? I don't think so.
---
If you find something that's incredibly powerful, easily countered, but is an expensive as a resource, you use it. If you find someone that can easily counter it, why would you continue to waste resources? 
---
&gt;There is another clueless statement from you in regards to the damage exploit, as your bloodied weapon can certainly not 1 hit kill people outside of combat by regular means, which is what takes place currently.
---
I have yet to see any proof that people can be killed through slap damage. I know people can be forced into PvP if the aggressor is wanted and the victim has certain mutations, but that's not occuring through slap damage. It's an exploit to pull people into PvP. Further, your post is about changes that need to occur with survival mode, which do not have the current restrictions for PvP engagement, so that exploit is moot. It's something that needs to be fixed for adventure mode. 
---
TBH, it just sounds like you haven't played PvP much and don't understand how to easily counter basic things like assassin+sentinel, spam heal, and melee. Not every build is viable to kill all builds and it's an interesting mechanic that encourages varied teams. There are certainly things that need to be balanced, but I don't think you've identified them.
---
&gt;Lately, I have been getting stream sniped a LOT by Tacocatracecar and  Oonce. They will server hop until they find my house and blow it up \[...\]
---
The comments in [this other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/axr0lh/i_killed_a_german_bethesda_streamer_mid_stream/) mention stream sniping is prohibited by Twitch. And if they're server-hopping to target you specifically, that would cross the line into harassment, which can and should be [reported to Bethesda](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44235/kw/harassment).
---
I'd like to be able to throw baseballs and cheer into the mic, "Grenade out!"....."Oh, shit...a dud."
---
Bethesda has much money 
---
&gt;...I got trashed from fanboys...
---
Just because people have different opinions doesn’t make them fanboys. Not trying to be mean about it, it just gets really tiresome when people call everyone they disagree with a fanboy or shill or whatever the term of the month is.
---
Berry mentats should show you someone using a stealthboy, dont they?
---
I hear the Messenger is fun, I dunno I never do it
---
I'm sure there are others on PC that would come to assist.
---
I use the food for adhesive and I'm going to sell the water. I've always built for efficiency on games like Ark and rust so it's more fun to me then decorative crap
---
Music, tuneless singing, judicious use of racist insults that have no place in polite society, basic behaviour that they'd never do face to face with another human being...
---
yeah, I much prefer emotes.
---
Seems pretty good. Hopefully the Plans for the BOS and some deep-pocketed can be brought at the vendors again too.
---
First of all I'm probably a higher level in the game than you and better. It's obvious that I am the more mature one here. You're obviously so childish you can't tell the difference between an intelligent discussion, a difference of opinions. Don't be butthurt because your character sucks at you want to start over just figure out how to fix your character in the first place pal. 
---
Theres gonna be new content every week starting tuesday for all of 2019 pretty much
---
Top of Seneca Rocks, no enemies ever.  Unless a wandering scorchbeasts happens upon you while you're there.
---
[imagine *this* thing with durability](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_B5E5HPIKKBY/TCgENnaXouI/AAAAAAAAAZs/JHip18_p03M/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-06-27+at+10.08.28+PM.png)
---
hah. I do that with one of my characters. Juuuuuuuust far enough away to be sneaky about it, juuuuuuust close enough so you know I'm there. 
---
Just... following. Looking for scraps. It's fun.
---
So on pve servers no workshops?
---
Catch him while he's moving or use AA stuff on him. Chews thru that sentinel gear.
---
Yes! Pacifist mode is almost fucking useless, it should be where you don't take damage from players, players shouldn't be able to destroy your base, and obviously you can't do damage to them or their base. 
---
THIS!!!! This Is Half the problem YES. And is getting abused on the Daily .. Guy A and Guy B - Guy A destroys your entire base and gets a 350+ cap bounty on his head. Has his Friend, Guy B kill him and the bounty is gone. = your base is gone , your Mats to repair gone  and no Punishment to the cheap piece of Shite that just griefed you. 
---
They are also drawing you in by them getting a team mate to get a huge bounty on themselves and when a bounty collector comes to get them their team  kills the "bait guy" for the bounty and then they jump you.  I watched this happen to a guy near my base and then they decided to tank my base cause I was in the area (witness to the murder?) .. hahaha 
---
Westek is a good spot, but team up because it’s loaded with super mutants. Also AWOL Armaments is good, but that has the OP Gutsy and their armor piercing player destroyers so teaming is good and dying is frequent. Appalachian Antiques is good once in awhile, and Uranium Fever is doable at level 50 but I would partner up there too. 
---
I will message you when I get on
---
Then acid becomes the bottleneck.
---
I find it faster and easier to do the powering up Poseidon event and scrapping the hundreds of shit guns and melee weapons from all the scorched. Plus, there's a slim chance of getting plans I don't have and/or a low level legendary thing I can pass off to a newbie.
---
That challenge tracking is a great idea, fliping back to check the challenge menu was a pain.
---
Buffs for energy weapons is awesome news, I really wanted a hard hitting plasma rifle comparable to my handmade.
---
I'm not big into heavy weapons but they really did need something to make them worthwhile
---
Would like to see a buff to all ranged damage and durability though.
---
There's just not enough Workshop space to do it all inside. I need the lines of crops inside so that people can't pick them
---
Does bethesda know that fasnacht day is before ash Wednesday (which was yesterday)?
---
I usually have mine off due to having a three year old who loves running up to tell me things while I'm trying to play. But as long as you're giving someone a minute or two to get their mic and turn area chat on, I don't see what the big deal is. It *is* annoying to communicate without one.
---
Naughty nurse build!
---
I must torment my friends with this persona now!  I will make them recoil in utter fear of my 'healing capabilities' :D
---
My loop is Huntersville, West Tek, Generals Steakhouse, Harpers Ferry.  
---
Leveled from 187 to 188 in about an hour and a half doing that the other day. 
---
I think it's based on the server and not a particular location. Whitespring is good because of the large mobs of ghouls that spawn, watoga is robots and west tek is super mutants. You arent guaranteed to find legendary's and sometimes won't. If you are finding a high rate of legendary enemies, especially multi starred, its worth it to stay on that server for awhile. You tend to find that even in areas you wouldn't normally farm, legendary enemies are more likely to spawn. 
---
Honestly when I did play I usually looted my scrap from workshops maybe one time and forgot about it... Really not something that would bother me either when people take it
---
Because apparently game balance is making one class of weapons far superior to another? If energy weapons were made as amazing as you want, there's never be a reason to use a ballistic weapon. It's not like fusion cells are hard to come by considering robots and supermutants tend to carry them. 
---
I don't want people taking my water or crops, what's not to understand about that?
---
Can you not read? The guy was following me around doing slap damage from station to station. I gave him the angry face and he kept doing it until I had stimmed twice, at which point I blocked him and fast traveled away. I get it. You ARE a griefer. You’re just like those duper assholes who claimed up and down their actions were impossible or didn’t happen etc. 
---
I don't really have as many experiences as others I think but the last time I saw him I did have some random plans that I just happen to not have so it was relatively exciting. Knowing my luck I'll finally find him and he'll just have stuff that I've had for months haha
---
Yeah, it's already been reported. And he just makes a new account on twitch when it's banned.
---
The easiest point of reference is to find the traincar with the power armor station. The adjacent car (eastward) has a white shelf (guessing 8 ft long x 3ft tall), that plan will spawn on one of the bottom shelves.
---
If you fast travel, go forward and to the right. I think you jump over one row of cars, the row w/ the plan is the next one
---
I skipped patch 5, but I dont see plans as often in patch 6 as I did in patch 4. Maybe that spot became more widely known, so it get raided more.
---
Fixed this for you 
---
 "Asshole people are a pretty significant component of Life" 
---
hahaha :)
---
I am worried there is no mention of flame throwers :(
---
okay,thanks for the info.I have strong weapons that I can't use until level 45
---
I disagree with a few of your points. Sentinel armor sets are countered by staggers, criticals, and radiation damage. Anyone can use a gamma gun and everyone should carry one.
---
Melee is not that big of a threat. Crouching breaks their vats and allows you to marsupial over their sprinting attack. You do have to crouch before they target you, however. They are also extremely vulnerable when running in a straight line towards you.
---
My build absolutely obliterates anyone in PVP. There is no way you will outheal 2200 DPS. An ideal PVP build, whether guns or melee, should be killing within one second. If it is not, you should reconsider your build.
---
I cannot speak too much against invisibility. I use the chameleon mutation and often perch myself on high ground with a recon scope. You can mark people before they go invisible and possibly also while invisible. I would like to test that out. The main thing is, if you have a permanent source of invisibility, you can outlast their consumable supply.
---
Pretty legit. That BoS reveal had that one guy moving tho lol.
---
The mic technique might need more work. Maybe add reverb? Have it facing 45°? The spacing/breaks in the lines is a bit off. Esp the first line.
---
maybe this challenge tracker will bring the issue of incompletable challenges to light. I regularly have challenges that don't register the activity it is asking me to do. they are often daily/weekly challenges, but some of the game's main challenges are bugged as well. for example, the challenge to max out a perk card for each SPECIAL has been sitting on "2" for as long as i can remember. I have several perk cards maxed in each SPECIAL category.
---
You still have to guess the password, but you can't even try it unless your hacker level is high enough. I think if you're higher than the level required though  there are actually less letters in the password. I always felt more letters made it easier though. If the password is like bing or something short, there's a ton of possibilities that are just one letter off.
---
Its not like I am implying that plant-arranger lifestyle is anyhow inferior. I love my plants properly arranged.
---
And by new content I pray you're talking opening up the other vaults, new missions/storyline advancement?  Hopefully not just a new event here or there.
---
I've seen the restored fans, but I can't remember where. Then again I just found "Company Tea" for the first time yesterday, so who knows what else I haven't seen.
---
Can you not read? I agreed with you, you fucking moron.
---
K? It’s a joke. 
---
I have had players come up to me and start stabbing me with a very fast serrated combat knife. I have Pacifist on and I'm using about 6 stimpacks a minute to keep from dying until I decide to leave the server because of this douchenozzle.    I didn't own a workshop. I was just standing at a vendor.  I wasn't even in the vendor screen tying up the vendor, I was just standing there.   
---
I suspect that the worst combination would be a a legendary with speed boost, melee speed perks, and a very fast weapon to begin with.   The health bar was melting away rapidly.   
---
I suspect the same thing is quite doable with an upgraded. Mr Handy and the right combo of perks.
---
Yup. Just search up the roadmap
---
To much to list. Really maybe some cool explosive lever and pistols maybe some unarmed stuff
---
List it's funny that you don't realize how much you fast travel until someone brings it up. Looks like I'm gonna be doing some hiking for the next couple days
---
Yeah, one day text will be able to convey tone.
---
Nothing wrong with camping IMO. If people want to sit around for hours waiting for that one kill I say let them
---
&gt; Since you are clearly more educated about my group of players,
---
You are complaining about not being able to outdamage people healing in PA 
---
Your entire group is trash if that's the case.
---
Yeah the "buffs" seem pretty weak.  I think the reality is they want end game creatures to be grindy.  Emptying a clip to kill a few super mutants is A-OK by them.
---
Isn't ironic how the community is asking for screws when Bethesda won't stop screwing up said community?
---
Also tatoes so you can properly boo poor stage performance!
---
The quest Tracking Unknowns give you a legendary flamer at the end of it. Can’t remember the effect off the top of my head 
---
What are you playing on?
---
About what exactly?
---
Two shots are so last season. You want a bloodied explosive or anti armor explosive... 
---
As far as Chameleon goes a good recon scope marker can counter this too. I am a stealth sniper I dont want any of my mechanics nerfed because Heavy/PA users dont like sneakers
---
Yeah the game makes it hard sometimes with it's little issues. Mic work was done pretty quickly but in future we'll be sure to take our time! Thankyou for your feedback! 
---
Yeah, considering it's supposedly the rarest enemy in the game the loot is kinda boring, I agree.
---
If you want mods for alien blasters you can easily get your hands on them though. Pick up one alien blaster per day and scrap it. Also don't forget to pick up the conversion mod plans in TNT Dome 2.
---
I wish I could remember. Found it one day and haven't since
---
This has nothing to do with disagreement. I assume you can read, so where did you miss my point where they accused ME of a lie? They simply said „no, our god Todd howard patched griefing, you’re lying“ and downvoted me into oblivion. I deleted my comment at -8 karma, it was insane. I totally agree with you that we shouldn’t call each other names so fast, but there are people on here who are toxic fan boys and simply witch hunt you when you’re stating a fact. I get it, there where/are many trolls on here too who simply riding the hate train, but there are equally as many deluded folks who can’t/ don’t want to have a serious discussion about their beloved game. I love it too, but the gri€fing is still a big problem. 
---
Once read on some conspiracy thing a friend on Facebook shared that India has a radioactive crater that may have been the result of an 'ancient nuclear bomb' or something.
---
History is pretty fascinating, I seriously did not know we had the screw 2000 years ago.  Really makes me wonder what else we had that'd be surprising to common history deficient folks like myself.
---
well they've already laid out when that is coming, so idk why you would expect anything else.
---
So pointing out that Bethesda agrees that PvP mechanics in the game are being exploited to grief people.....is "whining".
---
Did I say it needed to be a 'pure PvE experience'?  No.  But nothing should FORCE a player into PvP.  Sorry, if you want pure PvP, go play Fortnite.
---
It’s not that hard to figure out that somebody who is saying sell screws for a real tenner in a video game is probably not serious. Because literally nobody anywhere like micro transactions. 
---
I find hard to believe you can't outstimpack the damage someone deals to you while they waste their time attacking you. That's exactly what I did when someone attacked me. Now your base is another thing, they'll surely be able to destroy it and then you server hop. No problem at all
---
I'll be on PS4 \^.\^
---
I suppose if some of the new distilling/brewing items use flux then that is kinda sorta "endgame"...
---
But you shouldn’t have to hop is the issue 
---
I wasn’t insulting him or anything, i was just surprised as I have less playtime, have done barely any quests and haven’t farmed XP since the tse nerf but I’m still lvl 149, but I agree play the game however you like
---
Awww, as always, I'm already looking forward to it. \^.\^
---
Having a bloodied build does you fucking powergamer.
---
This is a fantastic idea.  I am wishing for a way to organize inventory and fix my characters items, as well as shuffle my perk cards around while on my phone and away from the Xbox. As you know, it can take quite a bit of time to manage that in-game.  Adding a vending option would be even better. 
---
I don't know .. Farming for good weapons to trade for things, Farming materials for future content .. there is a PVP mini game at the high school and a radio station to tune to, if you want to PVP .. or help other players ?  And I know this is gonna sound like a dumb suggestion cause it wont matter to them idiots that are doing this stuff .. but hey, IMO if you're bored go find a different game .. taking enjoyment in others misery that don't deserve it, is sick.. Why ruin my gaming experience  because you're bored, is what I would say to them.
---
I have a double gatling plasma and the double legendary effect doesn't work and I was wondering if anyone else has this issue 
---
&gt;Bethesda agrees that PvP mechanics in the game are being exploited to grief people
---
If mental gymnastics were an Olympic sport, you'd win gold.
---
Thanks for posting, I can't access Beth site from work.
---
I'm glad to see the Heavy Weapons Durability &amp; Buff, now i can go to a Queen battle with the 50 Cal, or the Gatling instead of taking both and returning with 2 broken guns.
---
Pacifist mode has one purpose and that is to prevent you from accidentally engaging in pvp. It is not intended to make you bulletproof. Block the player and relog and you wont be on a server with them. This complaint comes up all the time and its not a real problem. There are mechanics to get around pvp that work and the game is a pvp game. I dont understand how people can complain about pvp in a game that is already so accommodating to them.
---
Yep that's me haha.  Fun times indeed. 
---
That is my feeling as well.  They are a public resource that can be taken over for private gain, and due to the unique rewards associated with holding a workshop there is the potential for other players that may want those rewards so if a sharing agreement cannot be reached, then other measures may be employed to secure said rewards.  Then again maybe some people just want an excuse to pvp and workshops provide that.  Either reason is fine by me.  Frankly I can gather all of the resources I need without using workshops, sometimes more quickly than they can provide it, sometimes not.
---
Also, forgot to link you to a possible solution for your neon letters issues!

Heh. I was camped there for a while too, but I relocated to the junk pile just north of the substation near Watoga. My camp doesn't get attacked very often, but there's a guaranteed Death Claw spawn in the substation.
---
TBH he's not wrong about your team not being well informed. It seems to me you haven't figured out all the mechanics for PvP or identified all the counters to everything your suggesting is broken. PA isn't very viable for PvP unless you're fighting PvE players that don't know any PvP mechanics whatsoever. I don't think you're in a position to suggest changes to a system it appears you don't fully understand.
---
I'm able to craft flamers, I'm sure someone on here could help you out. 
---
I would on XB for free, but won't get my console back from service until Monday.
---
Just an FYI when you are leveling you don't have to get a card in the SPECIAL that you select. For instance, if you picked Strength, when it takes you to pick a card, you can scroll through the different cards (it should say at the bottom of the screen which buttons scroll to different perk category).
---
Sorry if you already knew this but just figured I'd let you know. On topic, definitely get Tank Killer if you are using rifles a lot.
---
Finally something new to farm. I hope we can participate more than once a day, though.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Would make nomadic builds possible!  Let us place at least one workbench at a time or only one kind (even if it's just a cooking station, I was just hoping we could place a workbench down to scrap stuff).
---
Make the budget extremely limited, I would utilize this a bunch.
---
And maybe instead of waiting an hour without compromise we can place it down within an hour but at the cost of caps with an hour being when the cost is free.
---
I don't see what you said in your first comment that justifies all those people insulting you like that, you just vented a little. People can be nasty lol.
---
Fair enough, my camp is on an a acid node and I run Melee, so, yeah, the odd time I need steel I grab that stuff.  
---
the cake is a lie...
---
I have a feeling that they mean they are adding no build zones to areas that are going to serve as quest locations - like the upcoming Fasnacht seasonal event in the Helvetia area.  Unless they are adding "events" to Whitesprings, I don't know that it includes that location.  I have no insider information - I just get the feeling that it is this way.
---
&gt;This has nothing to do with disagreement.
---
The disagreement is in whether or not what you stated occurred is what occurred.
---
&gt;I assume you can read, so where did you miss my point where they accused ME of a lie?
---
No, I caught that. But nonetheless, it doesn’t make them fanboys.
---
You know they moved the INI files from the application folder to documents\\games at some point? That threw me for a bit.
---
&gt;Energy weapons need to do more damage than ballistics. Why would a war-like, high tech society like the U.S. before the war make energy weapons
---
Ammunition, armor and maintenance.
---
The ammunition of an energy weapon would weigh less per shot, and theoretically could be "recharged" in theater.  Ballistic ammo can't be recharged and weighs more.  (May not be reflected in the game, but it's one reason they'd do it even if ballistic has comparable damage).  Larger platforms could have effectively infinite ammo due to on-board generators.
---
Armor was made to stop ballistic projectiles, and troops in the Fallout universe were pretty heavily armored (even when not wearing power armor).  Energy weapons caused heat damage that was not as affected by the ballistic armor.
---
Ballistic weapons need to be disassembled and cleaned regularly in order to continue functioning.  They've got lots of small but incredibly precise moving parts.  Energy weapons are solid state, reducing the amount of stuff you'd have to maintain.  You probably wouldn't need to disassemble a laser rifle in the field at all, just clean the lens.
---
Wait, you mean coding takes time?!! Since when lol 
---
Thanks for all the changes you guys have done so far though. 
---
There's also a static spawn of one on top of the day spa building in Berkeley Springs.
---
 Here's a sample poem:  
---
There once was a man from Watoga, 
---
and for 50 Caps he would blow ya. 
---
I'm not usually a payer, 
---
but he used to be mayor, 
---
and power just makes me explode-a!   
---
I'm constantly running out, but it's only because I like to build pimped out guns for low level players. A level 5 hunting rifle with hardened receiver, recon scope, and all the other mods requires close to 20+ screws.  Also, adding deep pockets to leather armor takes 4-5 per armor piece.
---
There's no reason *not* to sneak in a wider no build zone around Whitesprings, as that's where the nightly ghoul parade is taking place.
---
I'd just change it so pacifist mode PVE players can only take unclaimed workshops. That way they don't have to deal with griefers when they want or need to take one, but at the same time people can't abuse pacifist mode to safely take a workshop from somebody else.
---
Quick question:  
---
I know the brewing/distilling system will have some at least minor quests, any new quests beyond that?  
---
The road map seems to mention something about "the pioneer scouts, a mythical beast" etc associated with March 12th patch, but I'm not sure that was a reference to future patches or this one coming up next week?  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/SiTmvsP.png](https://i.imgur.com/SiTmvsP.png) for reference.
---
In short: What Rust has. I imagine this is already what they are going for, otherwise there is no point of having vendors.
---
&gt;C.A.M.P Receives Increased Damage Resistance When Set To Public
---
Easily abused. I want my camp be stronger, just sell items for price no one is going to buy and your base is gonna be stronger. 
---
&gt;Competitive Market
---
How many of you actually know how much item cost? I have seen prices being sold for 10x higher price than they are worth. In traditions AH, yes you open up items and check what is the lowest price item and you can put estimate value, but you don't have that kind of luxury on vending machines. The market price will be from one end to another, where thing is being sold for 100 caps and the moment later there is one who is selling for 1500 caps, and both of them get sold, because buyer has no idea of market value.
---
&gt;Advertise Offers On The Map
---
Basically you are painting big target on your camp.  I like it. Would be about time someone attacked my base, but I imagine non Raiders get even more frustrated, when they already are and right now their bases are hidden.
---
&gt;Reduced Fast Travel Costs
---
Fast Travel cost is already pointlessly low. Last time I played, all I did was fast travel between events and my cap stash didn't lower at all. 
---
They should have just implemented traditional AH.
---
This is a fair comment! I sometimes get envious of people who can pick locks straight away, instead of changing cards.
---
That place would be a constant bloodbath.
---
Why do people keep insisting on this? Bulking doesn't save weight (with rare exceptions like lead), and if you want to sell them you can sell them as loose screws. 
---
Hah!  Next thing you'll make a pun about weight-ing in-tents experiences.
---
I'm ready to be underwhelmed.
---
Board of the Meta: 5\* Legendary: Two shot, Explosive, Instigator, +1 Luck, 90% reduced weight.
---
Kill dozens of robots for Aluminum, and collect every single desk fan, clipboard and typewriter you find in the world. Also remember to pick up canisters and paint for the oil component.
---
You should find all you need for free in around one or two days like that.
---
Tell that to my lead and junk extractor at my camp.  They won't move with me!
---
I have about 350 screws taking up space in my stash, can’t seem to get rid of the damn things, keep picking them up, they are everywhere
---
That'd be fine too.  I simply object to the workshop-related pvp happening well outside the workshop.
---
junk piles in lots of workshops produce screws, albeit at a random rate.
---
Wasn't plasma gatling already one of the most favorable weapon for SBQ? I remember one saying:"Great, my Plasma Gatling will melt SBQ even faster and it already was melting it fast"
---
I made this mistake and am now respeccing slowly lol
---
Darn that's a bummer
---
They do. It sounds like OP has just been fighting PvE players in PvP and hasn't fought any serious PvP teams. Serious teams know all the counters to all the tactics
---
There's also an node at Poseidon, along with lead and aluminum. If you don't feel like capturing the workshop there are a bunch of uranium nodes scattered around that you can camp on and have a steady supply coming in.  Check this map and find one that isn't occupied.
---

Then use another term, Jesus. Why are you so triggered by that word? What would be your definition for such people with such an exclusive behavior? In my opinion that is exactly the definition of a „fanboy“. Denying a fact and trashtalking/ witch-hunting someone over a minor statement. It happened a lot on here, as well as simple hate comments towards the game. Both „parties“ are extremely annoying in they’re way of „discussing“ things. 
---
1k for a low value plan 2k for a high value plan!? I think that's generally what I've seen.  Maybe even 500 for like crossbow or what have you. 
---
Shotgun is good for Enforcer on some enemies.
---
Hmm well I play Xbox UnsafeSin HMU if you wanna farm a bit
---
Till pvpland survival is deployed, You have 2 options fight or run.
---
It’s that simple. 
---
For you handwringers and whiners, You can argue and debate about the pvp vs pve roles and responsibilities till you’re blue in the face, it’s not going to stop griefers from (being asshats) killing you and looting your corpses for loose change and mats.
---
Of course you can kill them.  There are literally hundreds of threads on this forum complaining that Pacifist mode does NOT protect the Passive player from griefing.
---
You kill them and you will accrue a Bounty.
---
If they do NOT have Pacifist mode on, and they do NOT return fire, and then you kill them... you still get a Bounty.
---
Pacifist does one thing and one thing only:  If a Player has Pacifist On, they cannot shoot and damage other players.
---
For me, its ‘This is my CAMP build, I wish I have enough budget for the roof’
---
Not sure if this is actually true or if it's just me, but I've found that when it stops, and I interact with it again, it starts up again.
---
This wasn't true a few weeks ago when I had someone with a combat knife melting my health away.  It took many stimpacks per minute to stay alive because his attack was a LOT faster than 5hp per second.     He was doing 5hp per attack with about 4 or 5 attacks per second or about 20hp per second (rough estimate based on the number of times I saw the knife flashing in my face.)   No I didn't have a workshop. I wasn't on a team.  I didn't initiate PvP.  This guy's build, perks, weapon choice, legendary effects (if applicable) all allowed him to far exceed the 5hp per second "limit".
---
Usually 500-1k, not much since theyre not too rare
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c914a9b&amp;d=sb2s40ss2sm0se2sn0pd0pl0pk0c72i44ic4an2a00a72lk2p02pp2a30lt2e60l71lu2ao0&amp;w=&amp;n=Melee%20sniper
---
I personally found this to be the best all rounder build. For the damage cards, it takes 3 cards for a 30% bonus or 9 for 60%, which I find unreasonable as there are many other great cards to supplement your build.
---
What this allows me to do is add a strong melee capability for when shit really starts to go down. It's worth noting for for the SBQ in particular it's much more efficient and powerful to mash her with a melee weapon when she lands, than to waste trillions of ammo and resources.
---
I find Travelling Farmacy to be absolutely mandatory as chems offer the best weight to money exchange for vendors, and chems are everywhere.
---
The INT allocation is debatable, but I find it to be the most utilitarian SPECIAL stat and worth a heavy investment. For example I often just run with Gunsmith 5 Batteries included 3 and Power User 2 for infinite power armor usage in general exploration, if I'm doing a Whitesprings farm I can swap that for melee durability etc. INT also has the repair perks which are super important for repairing things to 200% durability, but these perks can be picked up after level 50 so I would recommend filling out INT last.
---
If you're not running mutations you could swap those for some crit perks. 
---
AFAIK there isn't a single weapon in the game that yields screws when scrapped. As for fans and whatnot, a lot of times I find that the prime farming spots are picked clean, and I don't want to server hop looking for an instance of Sugar Grove that hasn't been completely looted. 
---
Being able to craft them would be helpful for lots of people, even if you don't need it.
---
Yes, they will accept the casual underarmor mods. I mod and hand out to new players. 
---
Yeah pacifist is dumb. It should just be full PvP, or none.  
---
Did you launch yet?
---
I hate to say it... but did you reboot your computer?  
---
Welcome home.
---
Who are all these people that needed a hyper specific SPECIAL spread that only works with TSE?? 
---
Respecing is easy if you play the game. You can farm out 3 or 4 levels per session even with those horrible nerfed explosive weapons.
---
Aw man I wouldn't pay money for that.  If you just take your time, you can acquire quite  a bit. 
---
My advice:   
---
1. When someone drops a nuke,  places a priority on collecting hardened mass, high radiation fluids, an glowing mass.   Don't even worry about the flux yet
---
2. When someone drops a nuke, go and collect the flux.    But sure to equip the green thumb perk.
---
3. Go back to your camp (or a crafting bench elsewhere) and craft the stabilized flux.  Be sure to have all there levels of  "super duper" perk equipped while crafting. 
---
People are nuking white springs all the time.  You can get about 20 raw cobalt flux there.   I find in around the outer edges not far from the power station.  There could be other places. 
---
2 pure cobalt flux shouldn't take much time or effort to acquire. Save your caps. 
---
Mine is a crafting build, although I'm almost finished with getting the perks I need for heavy guns, but I play in a group so my Strength is 18-21 depending on the time of day with all my gear being Deep Pocketed or Pocketed, and having my Strength stat filled with weight reduction, plus Batteries Included and Thru Hiker.  My carry weight is about 360 without power armor.  The only reson I can kill things is because I've got decent weappons.
---
I'd rather a cool down period just so somebody who normally plays in pacifist mode can still turn it off if they want to hunt down a wanted player. 
---
did you play Survival on fo4?
---
Suggestion:   
---
Thanks for working on energy weapons! But the plasma rifle/pistol right now does terrible damage because it's damage is split between energy and ballistic damage. This means perks don't affect it right and enemy armor reduces it's effectiveness way down.     
---
This should be an end game weapon...because it's harder to get and upgrade than a laser rife. (Which works better currently.)    
---
Fixing this would make pistol builds more viable, which is a big deal in my opinion.
---
thx!! do u know how much +STR +END it gives?
---
don't rebuild your base.  Pack it up and then replace it in the exact same spot.  It costs 40 caps and everything is rebuilt with no further costs.
---
well yeah, hence my "let's wait and see how this pans out but having hoped for changes this sounds disappointing." 
---
been playing very casually since beta and playing other things also, I rarely get more than 2-3 hours a day (not every day, just averaging) in this game it feels like. I like it, in fact I love it and it literally is one of my favorite games of all time! it was just disappointing to read something I had hoped for less restrictions and more content on considering "rebuild America" was one of the selling points.
---
session wide auctions, server wide / cross session auctions, caps for atoms (at a very steep rate), caps for legendary effects, and the list goes on...   it wouldn't take much to give the highest levels something to do with their caps and as well give them some help in offering their stuff for sale to a wider base.
---
Guess no one realizes it but in a way animation cancelling is exploiting. It would be cool if fo melee had real combos but this isnt it, and I hope they get rid of any animation cancelling.
---
watoga is my go to ive tried there as well as tons of other areas one place i found is thats amazing from time to time is the big observatory, hit that once and had 5, 3 star gutsys at one time.   
---
and have to ask, since its not mentioned in watoga are you just killing the robots? if so you are missing out. i usually find about 6 to 8 legendaries in a run  most being 1 star but hitting the ams building and the convention center will give me a 3 star more often than not. but also check the roofs there are sometimes legendaries up there.  
---
my normal route depending on the end i start on, like if i hit/start from train station, go south check around school, head to diner, check diner for recipes, head to coffee shop, check for legendary/comics/recipes/pie. go around corner check pheonix area 4 bots, head to bus station check those three, then hit ams go to floor above squatter bot, hit boss/legendary then hit roof for bot up there, jump down to heli pad, jump across gap to convention balcony. go in run around to stairs go up and check top floor for legendary/boss, back out and scope high areas again. jump servers and work my way back to trainstation. when i get back to trainstation i scrap and stash, then sell and jump servers again.  (could also add in municipal center (mayors office i used to till they stopped stimpak safe) if ya wanted to but never had too much luck finding much in there myself).
---
out of all the other places besides a ws nuke zone watoga seems more consistent for me hittin/finding legendaries and usually have about a 70-80% rate on getting atleast 2 3 stars a run.   
---
then if i get low on food i can run west of the train station to the lil cranberry swamp/house kill a mirelurk queen, 2 kings, and about 5 mirelurks and hit the cooking station in the diner to fix the food. also deathclaw at the power station to the northeast and the quarry next to it if i want a break from all the robots for a few minutes.
---
I think it would be nice at every dlc launch day we get an item that lets us respec for one-two days. Make it a non trade item we are good. 
---
He just happened to go explosives build.  And we get maybe 4-6 hours a week as a group.  
---
1. Making you first 50 hours produce different results than expecting is demoralizing.
---
2.  At 4-6 hours a week respecing would take months. 
---
3.  Because of point one he lost all motivation to play and despite your opinion that's really not unreasonable.
---
If you don't mind server hopping you can find "bundles of resources" fairly easily. Pick one of the spots that act as random spawn points and keep hopping. The crashed satellite has a wide array of high tech scrap, the dead responders always have a duffel bag full of building materials, the busted tank has 3-4 ammo crates, the bomb it has a bunch of stuff (if you can defuse it), and the "Fresh grave" usually has a toy and a couple of wooden blocks in it along with some less useful stuff like bone.
---
I sold my last arms and torso copy a week or two ago, but id be glad to mod any pieces you need.
---
As far as misc mods go, I know everything but dense torso and ultralight limbs for combat.
---
Wait, what?  Cause...that's totally my build (not kidding).  Frankly, for the sea of cards and the way the game plays, it works very well.
---
Or when they make major nerfs to exisiting builds...I wasnt alienated like my group but I understand why they were :(
---
It’s the suppressors effect. 
---
I hate you.
---
That's a good one I never thought of. I think the current mechanics for sneak builds need to stay. It's a great build type to fight using and fun to fight with
---
What level is he?
---
filthy casuals allows photos/vids. Don't really understand why they're not allowed here.
---
Yet we don't know how this reset will play out, and I guess they will make it worth it. What if we are going to exchange 50 levels for moving to the next tier? That way your accumulated (meaningless) levels can buy you multiple tiers in one go, and you would go from tier 1 [grunt] lvl 350 to tier 6 [legendary] lvl 50 at once. 
---
You just made me want to re-install... not sure if I should be happy or mad..
---
48 and 61 IIRC.  We havent logged in since that patch.
---
That's annoying though. Also imgur sucks for videos.
---
Nah. Tbh if you make a build and it gets nerfs. Then on you for doing so. You either know that it’s gonna be nerfed or go invisible. 
---
I am with you....I think things are slowly but surely coming together.  
---
I think the damage of energy weapons needs to buffed another 5 or 10%
---
You're play a online survival PVP game. Tf do you expect? 
---
I like this idea. Technically C.A.M.P. is soposed to work this way, but it doesn't. for example not being able to lay down a blueprinted camp in a new place for some unknown reason (bugs) ect. There is a skyrim mod called "campfire" that I use in that game. Every time I see the "tent plan" in a shop, I think of how cool and immersive it could be to have that in fo76. 
---
Probabaly only 5
---
Is this sarcasm?  Surely you're not blaming somebody for not being a psychic?
---
If you think it's so OP, post what system you use and IGN. Challenge people to prove you wrong. 
---
Yes please. I hate having to back out of the pick perk/ move point menu *every* time.
---
Im saving up levels incase I decide to go crazy and do a big respec, also I dont want the perk card screen any more cluttered than it already is.
---
If you're building/scrapping weapons to learn mods you burn through a couple hundred in a matter of minutes.
---
Yup, I lost nearly a month of progress because I got raided while at my day job.  It was a gut punch, but I moved on.  Fallout 76 is way safer than any other survival game out there.
---
And here I thought I was the oldster at 59, soon to be 60.  Kudo's to you!
---
I find it weird that this game's community feels like its in a position to split its population up.
---
PlayStation 4. I'm able to get online any time over the next 6 hours.
---
You can rack up two levels an hour easy. It wouldn't take months to tweak it into something else, just a few sessions. You're friend just doesn't want to play anymore, plan and simple.
---
Hmm never had a problem having screws so never really paid attention to what exactly gives it to me besides fans. I’m on Xbox which seems over all Xbox users are having a better experience like more people on it, haven’t had a lot of problems with bugs, crashes, or whatever there’s a lot of complaints about the game. Which I guess is why I’m one of the few that love the game. . So I don’t know. But I feel like if you can craft junk that’s just making the game easier than it already is and defeats one of the reasons why you go exploring in the game. 
---
Pre-CU all the way. The CU is what ruined the game.
---
The unintuitive complexity of pacifist, slap and workshops in a consumer game is like a bad joke. 
---
If you have to explain it, it didn't really work.
---
Expecting consumers to read complex stuff is not a successful market growth model say my starving kids.
---
The legendary loot system in Fallout is trash as a concept, and somehow even worse in practice. What have any of you seen in the past  4 months that makes you think Bethesda is capable of balancing legendary effects to make PvP even remotely competitive?
---
Fallout 76 was a decent experience as long as I had quests to do. For PvP, there's no shortage of games out there that do it better.
---
Shhhh, you're bringing easy solutions to a whinefest.
---
Out of curiosity, was your base a turret base in Whitesprings?
---
Bro! I would hug you right now!
---
Thank you for the offer. I'm on PS4 so maybe someone else.
---
Ive had that happen to me a few times, but as soon as the fuckery starts I just bounce servers and block dudes that grief me. Its not that hard to avoid people like that. But i agree the PvP as it sits NOW, is shit. Supposedly the new survival servers should fix that problem, i believe it will be a choice for players to either choose a co-operative server or a PvP server. And i assume in co-op other players cant damadge anyone or thier shit.
---
Fireproof, Super Duper, Cap Collector, Gunsmith &amp;  Weapon Artisan would all be good to have
---
I'm wondering how big the light limit is, I have quite a few lights in my camp right now but was thinking of downgrading because during the day it's too bright, and during the night it looks like the day.
---
Go make a run through Blackwater Mine (or Welch) and kill mole miners. A single trip through the mine will get you 30-50 gears from scrapping their suit pieces.
---
That's the Pyrolyzer. I wanted to wait until I'm level 50 to get it. Also I tend to get smashed around Harper's Ferry at my current level.
---
I am heavy weapons guy. And this
---
*pulls out gatling laser*
---
Is my weapon
---
It's definitely not perfect. I wholeheartedly accept that fact and am in no way saying this is a perfect game. But there is definitely something here that I feel a lot of people overlooked on first glance, myself included.
---
Apparently to be coddled. 
---
Since no one has suggested it I like Rifle Gaming. It's informative, not spammy, and overall the videos are helpful.
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/RifleGaming
---
He really does though.  Your odd assumptions aren't helpful or accurate man...
---
I feel like we don't need any temporary content for a while - anything they're willing to add like the Fastnacht robot parade might as well be permanently added to the game.  We're starved for content - it's not so overflowing that we can have pop up events with super short timelines yet.
---
Screws are def a scarce resource when youre crafting weapons and armor, but like a few of the guys said, workshops with junk piles are a good way to get them. Nor even gunna touch the PvP issue...
---
And that's when I pull out either my two shot fatman or two shot missile launcher.  Or maybe my new bloodied fatman if I'm low on health.
---
&gt; Nah. Tbh if you make a build and it gets nerfs. Then on you for doing so. You either know that it’s gonna be nerfed or go invisible.
---
LOLOL bruh this made my day
---
Too many game types that are slightly different will just fracture the player base into separate modes.  
---
Do you remember the player's name? We can start shaming these people for griefing. I'm all for PVP, but killing someone who doesn't want to fight you is lame, as is destroying their base simply because you're bored. Lame ass people like this deserve to be called out.
---
This. I have stuff to do. While this guy squats around not improving, I'll be farming legendaries and becoming stronger.
---
Also, Berry Mentats hard counters Chameleon.
---
This is why i love the community so much! I have had so many people offer to mod my armor for me. I appreciate the kindness but inreally want to be able to this for myself :)
---
Not sure if your still checking this, but ill drop a bit of info, and Im on ps4 if you want another duder to play with, and I have a whack of ammo too taking up stash space.
---
Low lvl scorched + super mutants are a great place to farm caps and ammo. And they can be taken down fairly easy with weak melee. I always keep a back up melee weapon on my rifle build.
---
Poseidon Power plant is great for scorched, so is the washed out area in Charleston. Wade Airport usually spawns quite a few super mutants, and can be farmed by running around the outside edge.
---
Perk into armor pierce as much as you can, after you get into your 30s most mobs start getting high DR values which negate a lot of damage. Im kinda gathering you use automatic weapons, and with their low base damage and high RateOfFire, a good chunk of your damage is being negated by armor. You also might want to look into a single shot, high base damage rifle, to plink enemies at range and for the higher DR mobs, and keep the automatics for swarms of squishies.
---
Get to know soft spots on your targets, and what has higher DR values. Scorched and Ghouls have low ish DR values, while Super mutants, SB/SBQ, and robots have much higher DR values. There is a perception perk that shows DR/ER if you have a point to waste.
---
There is also a trigger point around lvl 30s where enemies dont drop the lower ammo types as much like .38, .308, 10mm and start dropping more 5.56, .45, 5mm, I had issues keeping up with my hunting rifle, so I picked up a lever action and now im flush in both ammo's. That kinda leads into another point, try not to corner yourself with only one ammo type, I use my .308 at range, while stealthed, pull out the lever/handmade when being rushed, and whack all the squishies to death with my Ski sword.
---
Stay away from workshops, they open you up to PvP. I still like to cap them and do the first defend for plans, but I make sure I stay crouched any time I own a workshop. Staying crouched keeps you off the map and makes it harder for PvP'rs to track and target you. If you see someone start claiming your workshop, exit the server or become hyper vigilant on your surroundings. There is/was a bug that while someone is contesting a workshop, their team mate can hunt and kill  you anywhere on the map, slap damage doesnt apply while a workshop is being contested, once the site is claimed or no longer being contested, normal pvp rules are back in effect.
---
You've already got a bunch of good info on where to find ammo materials, and to use ammosmith + super duper, so ill leave that alone. The only other thing I could say is work towards a balance in your weapons/perks/items, we all want to be a fallout Demi-god, but it seems in 76 that a more balanced approach than your usual min/max glass cannon, helps out immensly. Try to rock 2 dif ammo type range weapons, and keep 1 melee weapon you can use in PA to fall back on if they break or get squishy.
---
Remebered one last thing, the damage increase perks for each weapon type, if you get each to max lvl and perk all 3 that takes up 9 perk slots and gives you a 60% increase to damage of the weapon type.
---
But, if you use the 1* version instead of the 3* version, you only use 3 slots and get a 30% boost.
---
Hope some of this helps, hit me up if your looking for another mature player, and good luck out there.
---
Check for windows updates/video driver updates and reboot..
---
Or, allow someone with the scrapping perks to get screws and other componenets off of rifles and various types of armor. 
---
And make the tougher robots also drop screws and gears. 
---
Does this guy have any credentials other than "Youtuber"? Why should I care what he has to say? What's the point if he doesn't actually say anything worth remembering?
---
Yeah but I’d love for a tse version, or a quad capacity for an automatic load out. 
---
Hopefully with it’s upcoming damage buff it becomes pretty usable. 
---
Yea, the fact that it is temporary sucks
---
Where do you find yours?
---
How you know dat?  (But seriously, I haven’t been able to pin down this information)
---
I hope it's more than 2x Durability on semi-auto energy weapons, I can only get through a little over 1 clip with my laser pistol before breaking, which is 30 rounds. And that is being repaired to 200% and having level 5 gunsmith equipped
---
Nice work my man keep her lit
---
&gt;Why are you so triggered by that word?
---
I’m not “triggered" by that word. I’m “triggered” (I wouldn’t call it “triggered”, just a minor irritation) by the apparent need to insult everyone who has a different viewpoint than you. It’s not unique to this subreddit, it happens all over reddit on a regular basis. So, sometimes I call it out.
---
I preferred the pacifist option in GTA online.  You couldn't take damage but you couldn't damage anything.  Perfect trade off.  That way it forced you into big boy mode if you wanted to fight others or even just draw your weapon.
---
I am not a big random talker either, but for the most part everyone I have dealt with talking in the game has been great. 
---
It's quite helpful for multi-level houses! sometimes you have to do some maneuvering but it seems to work most of the time
---
Thankyou!
---
still wish I had been able to help out on it lol
---
I was never raided to be honest, I'm like level 170+, but the video I saw really kinda made me go mad, I was thinking about it all day today, so decided to kinda give my thoughts on this. 
---
I even build a camp next to overseers camp to help new players with guns, melee weapons ammo water and other supplies. Helped only 2 so far, mat don't come easy from me. :) But after watching that video, I started to think to move my camp so a safer position and not build like crazy. More destruction equals to more materials for repair. 
---
If he has chameleon on, chances are his defenses are very very low, which means that if he DOES move, he's toast. And dude just.. berry mentats. I'm a power armor user, I dislike chameleon builds, but I don't really have an issue with them.
---
When I play games I only play one at a time. All I have played since Christmas day is fallout 76. I just really enjoy it, and have found a solid group who stuck around after all the nerfs. Friends make or break it for me :)
---
Yes, they give charisma and luck when modded
---
Let's not get too excited before it's actually fixed. With gunsmith my gatling plasma breaks before the 2nd clip is emptied. Make that last 5x as long (the biggest amount stated by the notes) and suddenly I might get 9-10 clips before the gun breaks. I'd be **pissed** if my gatling gun broke every 9 clips. It still doesn't last long enough if that's the case. It could use 15-20x the durability.
---
Hopefully this is a dry run for having a new weekly event each week.  That should be the goal.
---
I believe you are in danger anytime but not 100 percent sure. That’s why the workshop shows your name and icon 
---
There are a number of places where you can get ballistic fiber. 
---
Only repair legendary items. Also, get the perk thay allows you to repair to 200% durability. 
---
Craft new armor rather than repairing any non-legendary item. 
---
Oh god, please don’t ignore me. I was so dying to play with a 72 year old lonely pensioner. I guess I better quit this game now that my dreams have been dashed. Sigh.
---
There's always next time!
---
It's my personal opinion that there need to be strict pvp only servers and strict pacifist servers.  If you're playing on a pacifist server, no damage can befall a player or base from another player.  PVP servers can be all bets are off.  I can't see why it isn't already this way.
---
Go on the official wiki and look at legendary effects. There is a comprehensive list so hopefully that'll answer your queries 
---
Been there. Done that. Got a canned response from Bethesda when I reported it as griefing - Hopefully it will be addressed in the future. There’s a line between being a jerk and harassing a player. I’ve run into both - the jerks who shoot/slap you and run off don’t bother me. The individuals who follow you across the map with their buddies are a real issue for me - that’s not fun anymore. 
---
Being told to “switch servers” is a terrible response - and I’m looking forward to the changes. I’ll finally log back into the game once I can play pvp/pacifist on my terms. 
---
There it is!  The inevitable slander of shouting "Micist".  I swear, everytime someone tries to say something, here come you damn mimes and your "emotes" to ruin it for everyone.
---
If only there was a snowman outfit to go with the cryolater...sigh.
---
Respec every time there is nerf to to build??? So basically we would get a respec on any patch day, solely because (for example):bloodied is too good let’s nerf and refund??? 
---
That’s foolish and a waste of time. 
---
Clearly my words fall on deaf ears. 
---
It doesn’t take a lot of thought in seeing if a specific build or legendary is op.
---
I need to keep that in mind for future experimentation.
---
I find the seethrough floors kinda ugly, but that, quality might make me use them more often. ^^
---
No your right, it's not, I'm just saying that the literal meaning of Pacifist is that you don't fight back, not that you can't be fought at all, that's all I was saying
---
The come under the casual faction underarmour, what I've been told though is that there is no shielded plans for casual yet. Maybe there are the lesser strength plams though. Need clarification.
---
I know.  It's okay.
---
I took zero offense. :-)
---
Again, I enjoyed your post because it hones on what I sense is the best way forward: provide too very distinct modes for PvP (all-in) and PvE (all-out; at least outside of Workshops).
---
I do question the original design push toward any kind of PvP for 76, e.g. how many folks truly wanted this (outside of Todd "Tension")  in the first place, but that's a separate topic. ;) It's here now, so let's deal with it in way that benefits two distinct experiences.
---
We definitely should make more! It was so much fun. We did miss you Convict
---
I still just can't wrap my head around people feeling justified in attacking golf course bases on the grounds that they're farming, when the people finding and attacking them are literally always there to camp the spot and kill all of the ghouls for loot themselves.  If someone was in the spot fighting on foot instead, are they pretending they would share?  They wouldn't.  There's no doubt there - they came to do exactly what the turret base owners are doing and are just whining because the base owners used in game mechanics to simplify the process.
---
Workshops make you a huge PVP target now.  If you're at your camp while owning one, crouch so no one can see where you're at it.  I know it's not possible in cases of crafting, you'll just need to rethink how you're doing things when you capture one.  Plus, outside of flux, junk is stupid easy to get.
---
That would be kinda cool. The current AB is probably one of the most useless weapons in the game, and I only ever use it for posing tbh.
---
Better link, looks like that one had nothing on casual. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Scared these new no place zones will scrap a couple awesome placement areas. Hopefully they're just around whitesprings and heltiva.
---
I would say the point of pacifist mode is to prevent a player from "Accidentally" initiating PvP slaps during group content.  I keep mine turned on as well.  
---
I have also had to, deliberately, while being slapped, go into my menu and turn it off, in order to retaliate appropriately.  
---
Some people are just jerks.  Block them, and go about your day.  You'll be better off for it.
---
So doubling down on the 'Be a psychic' suggestion...cmon dude...
---
Crap. I lucked out and got one purely by chance, I'd happily give it to you, but I'm on Xbone.
---
Need more players like you bud
---
Better than I thought it would tbh
---
Am I the only one that had full metal jacket going through my head?
---
Cheers for the offer. Pity about the different consoles.
---
Nah dude, you had it all planned out that's why it looks so well put together! 
---
Since last patch the damage buff was gone but the HP drain was still active.
---
😑  🐑 🧦  😶
---
If you are on PC shoot me a friend invite username is same as my Reddit username. 
---
spoken like someone who strokes themselves to completion listening to kids getting upset outside Vault 76.
---
Pacifism was supposed to keep PvP from bleeding over onto people who didn't want any part of it. if it did not exist, i would agree with you. the fact that Pacifism exists and fails indicates that something is wrong. 
---
what is your handle? i'm gonna go ahead and block you now, so i don't have to worry about running into your troll ass in Appalachia. 
---
Not get up. get to their desks and log in. Showtime for work tends to be pretty well set. In corporate life you check emails, then browse the web while you sip the coffee.
---
I loved this mod in fo4. I wanna wear a sack hood with my batting helmet.
---
The person that holds the item has to set an item to 0 caps before the other player can get it  requesting an item only shows a seller what you're interested in. That's the only way it works. If you give someone an item for 0 caps that you didn't want to give away, *That's your own fault*.
---
Yes....happening a lot more this week to me....but I just moved so i was not sure if my was my new ISP.  
---
Way cool! Well put together! Look forward to more stuff from you guys maybe!
---
I've got to disagree with your edit. I like taking workshops, but I don't want to become wanted because I accidentally shot someone.
---
Meh, im on xbox1 but thanks tho
---
Cheers for the offers. If anyone with a spare flamer/ plasma flamer is on PS4 I've got loads of bulk lead I can trade. PSN is BaronGrivet. I can get online.
---
That mostly happens when people take workshops. Workshops are PvP zones. People who fight you are workshops are playing the game as intended. Bethesda has said specifically that they are intended to be contestable. 
---
Now you’re being ridiculous... where did I „insult“ someone? You’re just bored and trying to get on my nerves. As I stated in my first comment and copied it for you in my second reply, I say it again: I was RIDICULED for lying, which is exactly what you described, hence you shouldn’t call ME out for describing what happened to ME. It is not a view, it’s not a different opinion, it’s just stupid to accuse someone for lying when he clearly isn’t. Stop trying to make a point against, I get what you’re saying but IAM the wrong person you’re calling out here. You’re making a fool of yourself... 
---
I've got a ton of stuff in my stash box, I keep solely for giveaway... I'll never use it with my build. I especially like hitting up "fresh outta the vaultl" characters with "loot bags".., a couple cosmetic items, a range weapon, some ammo, and a melee weapon". 
---
Yeah if you own a workshop, you have 2 expect pvp from anywhere
---
It's never enough for some of ya huh
---
Considering that this mode is respawning you at the vault or your Camp getting killed within a second seems a bit too much. In other shooters such as with CoD that would be somewhat alright because there is barely any penalty. And having auto aim which even works with Melee (VATS) doesnt seem to fit in PvP overall. At least imo
---
I'm sure they will come up with thinking. Maybe another mode like Raiders and Minutemen choose a Faction and let the party begin. :) Love this game, you take care and stay safe. Nuke em those Raiders :D 
---
My first toon was like that. 
---
What they need is a pacifist server like their pvp servers they're going to make. As in no one pvp's, no slap damage, no destroying bases. We work together and rebuild the world as we see fit with no assholes like the high lvl OP ran into to stop us.
---
We all had a blast making it so he doesn't have a choice lol. We all want to make more 
---
Yeah, Documents/My Games etc. Though I thought that's where they'd always been, at least since I started editing. :(
---
I like where your head is at!
---
Bethesda has responded to other threads  -it is being worked on.
---
Edit 2: Nuh-uh. NOPE. Y'all dont get to go OFF and INSULT me for bringing up 2, HUGE and legit bugs, and NOT cite a single conversation or thread in the last few weeks that address my questions. I dont doubt I may have missed them, but not a single one of you linked anything. Also, I DID make a post recently that never caught traction, but we gonna sit around and upvote the same tired ass QoL requests and bug posts week after week. PUH-LEASE. Case and point; see edit 1. Somehow BETH managed to answer my question without "ackshualy" explaining the "visual glitch" or trying to go "troll-to-lol" with me. So, yeah I CAN be a dick, but only when provoked, so why dont you ADD to the conversation? Or c'mon with your lazy-ass downvotes.
---
"outside of flux" is part of the key, here...i've only just started taking on blast zones, so such junk was new to me. 
---
also, while easy to get, things like ballistic fiber are still precious enough that i am extremely salty about losing a stack of it. 
---
after this and the Red Rocket incident from last week, i'm not even gonna bother with workshops anymore...just capture it and leave. do my crafting in trainstations and hope they don't become the next hot target...
---
Slap damage caps out at a MAX of 5 damage, regardless of *anything*. You can't be hurt more than once every three seconds. 
---
How long were you letting this person hit you? To deal just 100 damage, they'd have to repeatedly hit you for one full minute. 
---
I'll be there, whats the PSN name so I can join?
---
Hope they will deliver something quick :D 
---
They would have had to initiate PvP against you by claiming your workshop, then travelling to you to take attack you. (Although I'm not sure the PvP is meant to continue when they leave the workshop)
---
Even if they're in your workshop area the PvP doesn't start until they attempt to claim. 
---
Great idea for the sentinel armor to use AP, that would actually balance without nerfing them to the ground.
---
Naughty as in 'Silent Hills' naughty or as in "Hellooooooo Nurse" naughty?
---
I would really love masks to not count as hats in general. 
---
There were named power armor pieces in FO4 iirc, you got them as quest rewards but not outright legendary pieces.
---
I'd love for them to redo that in 76. Give us a few quests where you can get 'legendary' power armor pieces, limit it to say chests or helmets only so that you only have one legendary piece. But either way, make them worth having but not game breaking. 
---
Dear u/Grimey_Rick
---
You are rebel scum.
---
That is all.
---
This is why I play 5x servers with a 1 week wipe. 
---
I’m not into the bloodied build unfortunately,  I am really into finding an AA explosive but even then I’m having trouble!
---
Yeah, I do the same.  Only capture for challenges and leave once I do.  I bank rarer junk asap.  When I fight the queen, I loot her once she hits the ground then port away.  Ballistic Fiber can be found in Fort Defiance and Camp McClintock via military ammo bags.  I keep about 80-90 on hand.  I also keep white knight and lucky break equipped so I rarely repair armor.  I do melee 40% of the time and play frequently.
---
I disagree with the "there aren't any NPCs" point.
---
They're *everywhere*… just dead. The holotapes and notes and stuff have painted pictures of characters in my head far more detailed than any in-game talking head could ever do. I find I'm way more invested in the stories in this game than I was in the previous Bethesda installments, simply because I inject so much of my own imagination into the bones they give me. I feel more "attached" to this world than I did in 4, for sure. 
---
I like the handful of other human players in this blasted world. Makes it feel more "post apoc" than 3,NV and 4, where there was someone over every hill, around every corner. I like the way they *drip* details about mysteries to you... who are the scorched? Why? What exactly is going on in the mountains?  Who is this recurring name I keep seeing in notes and tapes? 
---
Yeah, in my opinion, this game is LOADED with NPCs, just... they're all dead.
---
Haha sounds like a decent plan to me. Im not all mad at the game just hopping they dont mess up the lvl system more. I have some faith still haha 
---
OK, so, I'll throw in my 2c :) Here is my current build, at level 184, after many MANY changes.
---
Couple of points:
---
- You won't have the perk cards you need at 50. More like 60, and that's if you're certain about which ones you need.
---
- Fallout 76 is NOT a min/max game (yet). Do NOT concentrate on damage to the detriment of QOL - you want to ENJOY playing, right?
---
- "Bloodied" is the current meta for both melee and rifle. Playing at perma-low-health for a big increase in damage. However, Bloodied is not necessarily enjoyable at max damage, and I want to point out that 50% health (LOADS) is also +50% damage (this may be inaccurate).
---
- Power armor is, contrary to popular opinion, NOT just for schlubs.
---
- Swapping in cards is OK, when you want to craft. Just as long as you don't end up doing it every 5 minutes and ruin your mojo.
---
So here ya go!
---
- Gear: Power armor. The defense and rad resist, as well as the increase in Str are just too nice to pass up. Plus no fall damage. Plus it weighs zero when you're wearing it. Or 10 lbs. I'm not sure, but who cares. You can add QOL to it with Calibrated Shocks (carry weight, a no-brainer, and a Jetpack (woo, flying) or Emergency Protocols (woo, impossible to kill!)). Any weapon. Some are nicer than others, sure. I personally DO use Bloodied weapons, but that is mostly because that is what I have. It DOES help on how often you have to farm ammo, but you certainly don't have to live your life in the danger zone. See:
---
- Playstyle - Unsophisticated. Best word I can find. You see the mobs, you blow their heads off. We're in power armor, so no stupid changing out of nice legendary gear to get into a poxy hazmat cos you want to farm a nuke-zone. Just go in. Be grand. No worrying about low/high health. Shoot the stuff and stim when you need to. No sneaking around hoping nobody sees you. Feel the power of being a 7 foot tall metal madman with glowing eyes. If you use Bloodied, yes, you'll get nastier as you get lower, but I tend to play somewhere between 80% and 20% health. Honestly? I don't tend to pay attention unless my sound goes funny and I figure someone just shot me in the ear. Then I stim.
---
- Mutations - Grab the whole damn lot. There's very little that hurts very much when you use Class Freak.
---
- Str (3) - 3 will give you the ability to LOL at hammer-muteys and ghouls, with max Blocker. 45% DR against melee? Eh, yes please. I personally like Travelling Pharmacy (maxed) because chems are bloody heavy. Oh don't get me wrong, I don't bother to actually USE them, but they're handy for selling to merchants for the 1400 caps per day. If you INSIST on having a melee option, get Incisor maxed (3 points). No, you don't need melee perks. This is all you need.
---
- Perception (6) - Rifle, Expert Rifle, Master Rifle - all rank 1. It's plenty. 3 points in Tank killer though, that's really not optional. That's 6. On a rifleman. Max em out if you want (a bit) more damage, maybe slot in Picklock if you like it? Anyhow, it's minimal.
---
Endurance (1) - The LOL-stat. I mean, you have to have one point, but there's only 2 contenders. Cannibal (which I use) lets you eat mobs for no more hunger. Uh-huh. I can embrace this wasteland-jive. The other optiion is Radicool, which if you INSISTED on the melee option is the one you should pick. You don't need a Bloodied weapon with this, FYI, you'll be a wrecking machine regardless if something hurts you. You'll just wreck twice as fast with a bloodied. Again, you do NOT need perks in melee damage.
---
- Charisma (5) - Lone Wanderer maxed is 4 points, and I don't think I need to explain. The other point? Travel agent!! It's my favourite card, I think :) FUCK fast travel costs.
---
- Intelligence (6) - 5 points in Gunsmith (guns break too often) and 1 point in....SCRAPPER! Yes, because you will need a shitload of ammo, and it's a pain in the arse to get Steel after a while. I used to think Lead was my limiter....it isn't. Lucky Hole Mine showed me otherwise. Take Scrapper.
---
- Agility (11) - Action Boy and Dodgy will make you ridiculously tanky. Try with and try without, and make your own choice, but yes. Adrenaline lets you stack damage up to 60% as long as you keep moving and killing. You don't need to max it. One point here, for a total of (7) is also OK. I personally like it maxed.
---
- Luck (8) - The only kinda non-negotiable one, tbh. Class Freak to minimise mutation penalties. You said you were solo....you want this. Starched Genes to make them stick. Bloody Mess is simply +15% damage, thank you.
---
But WAIT IST, I am sure I hear you shout in my fevered imagination, this is only 39 of the 56 perks we can have!!
---
To which I say, yes, yes it is. And it's plenty. You can fill in the rest as you see fit and you'll do very well. I personally choose to have the melee option and a pile of weight-reduction perks, as detailed here (my actual build):
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwgIAAQKDAcBAQEMAQMFBwkKDQ4PEBMCLE8DQAUlAngD8AEDxAEDPwOmAQF+A3AFeQMLA6cBAfEBA8IBAWwBrAEBNgK7AQMkAtcBARkDAA==
---
I fleshed mine out with:
---
- Incisor, for when I need to get out the axe. I only do this when my gun breaks. No, I don't need melee perks, everything dies in one hit. Bandolier is also a great choice if you're a hoarder (I only recently swapped this out).
---
- Travelling Pharmacy - I have at any given time hundreds of stims, rad-x/rad-away, chems....all they are to me is money at the vendors, right? But I like to be able to loot shit without analysing it.
---
- Glow Sight, for when I choose to farm Whitespring, which I do not choose very often at all. I typically replace it with higher level Rifleman perks or Picklock. I frequently forget what I have equipped, and it doesn't matter at all.
---
- Batteries Included - Power armor uses Fusion Cores, and these are HEAVY. I like to carry 10-15 and then refill em when I hit about 5. At your discretion.

- Thru-Hiker - goddamn I love this perk. Food/Drink stuff is heavy!

And here is me clearing West-Tek:

(Will add when uploaded!)
---
You can see I DO make use of Bloodied, but I've done this as a full-health build with a "Not Special" gun, and it works lovely-jubbly, just takes more bullets. Hence the QOL recommendations.
---
Hope this helped :)
---
Ist.
---
I've been pretty luck other than this past week. It got so bad a few days ago I just gave up after about 7 disconnects in  less than hour. Seems to always get like this right before they apply a "patch" it seems.
---
&gt;Now you’re being ridiculous... where did I „insult“ someone?
---
Most people take being called a fanboy as an insult.
---
&gt;Stop trying to make a point against me...
---
I’m not really trying to make a point against you. All I’m saying is that fanboy is generally considered/used as an insult, and we can have discussions about issues without throwing insults around.
---
Maybe you’re justified in insulting these people. Maybe you aren’t. I’m not really making a judgement on that. I’m just saying, insults aren’t really useful in discussion.
---
Yeah I can’t directly confirm this but a couple friends of mine told me they’ve found the plans after doing a bunch of cranberry bog maps.
---
1v1 you're only in danger while around the workshop build area, and only by anyone contesting.
---
The problem is with the way team mechanics work with workshops. Basically, a team member (tm1) can go to your workshop and contest it, and *anyone* in their team can attack you without consequences, anywhere you are on the map. Then all they (tm1) has to do is leave the build area to stop contesting, re-enter, contest again, and his teammates can again kill you. 
---
The real problem, is that 2 or 3 teammates can fast travel to you first, have the first teammate contest your workshop, and then immediately kill you before you're aware of the workshop being contested.
---
Rinse, repeat ad infinitum...
---
Lol, you pretty much have to.  That game is rough.
---
" In previous Fallout games you had to grab junk and scrap it why would this be any different? "  Exactly, I'd like to be able to get some screws when I scrap 50 guns from killing a ton of scorched.    10 screws from 50 guns isn't asking for too much here, LIKE IN PREVIOUS FALLOUT GAMES where you could get screws for scrapping when you had the scrapper perk for it. 
---
Thanks.  I’m still keeping my eyes out.  I just like to know that when I pay caps for something it was found by that person.  And it would really suck if I spend a bunch of caps and then when they do the dupe wipe officially it’s gone.
---
Yeah. There was a fist you got from a Gunner chick in Quincy. 
---
I just want to throw my support behind the idea of workshops being area PvP. If you're not in a workshop area, pacifist mode means no damage to or from other players (or friendly bots). Entering a workshop area with pacifist on prompts a warning message that you're eligible for PvP but DOES NOT TOGGLE PACIFIST so that your C.A.M.P. is still protected and when you /leave/ the area pacifist mode is still engaged. This way, anyone in a workshop area is automatically eligible for PvP regardless of settings and in order be immune from PvP, you have to leave the workshop area. That prevents any kind of abuse from the pacifist system and it will also make the workshops infinitely more dangerous and gives raiders a number of fair and open targets at any given time. PvP had always been the choice when you take a workshop. Bethesda has come out and said that's part of the /point/ of workshops. 
---
I've always felt the reason your C.A.M.P. stash is protected but extractors (even at your C.A.M.P.) aren't is because the extractors are what raiders are /meant/ to target. This would really drive that home. I know there are lots of PVE players who like PvP sometimes. This would quickly generate hotspots for PvP activity around certain workshops and make the more valuable workshops /much/ more difficult to hold.
---
It also becomes sort of self-regulating because if holding the Charleston Landfill becomes impossible, or even just not worth the effort, then the raiders have to back off if they want to get paid. Simple, really.
---
It would also be made significantly more effective if servers could be segregated by player level. Level 1-30 on a server, 31-60 on another, 61-100 on another maybe, 100+on the final group? I dunno, that's just pulling numbers right out of the air, but it's a thought. This way you can't have a pair of level 200+ players making a workshop impossible to hold for the rest of the server. 
---
How big a farm do you NEED? 
---
Guess it depends on how many chems she decided to consume that day. 
---
I’m keeping my eyes out that’s for sure!  I’m finding the horde events actually drop great stuff too but with all this PVP bloodied build nonsense I feel like all the weapons that drop seem to be for that build for some reason.  
---
Seems to me if he wanted to play he would be playing and not whining about a mountain that's actually a mole hill.
---
I do same, except with people who don't communicate with me through text chat.
---
i full time: 4 str for 3 star traveling pharm, and 1 star bandolier, 15 per for rifle, tank killer and the concentrated fire, i only have 3 end to use fireproof perk, 6 chr supressor, tenderizer, int is 10 for demolition exp, gunsmith, agility 9 thru hiker, sandman, gunfu, 1 star in actiongirl, luck is 9 for starched genes, class freak, good with salt, and 1 star bloody mess.  
---
weapons i use are an AA lever, exp lever, tse lever, tse handmade (set to semi auto, 35 rnd armor pen clip). i stopped carrying a shotgun and went with handmade since it falls under rifle perks as well and can work faster than a lever in certain situations.. but sneak/sniper build i dont need to bring it out that often. (still carry my all rise though just no perks to up its damage).  
---
so since i use explosive weapons needed 10 int for lvl 5 demo, and for reduced weapon breaks i always run lvl 5 gunsmith.
---
since low str build i use traveling pharm at 3 and thru at 3, so most all that stuff is weightless, add in pocketed and some armor with +str and weight reduction to weapons i usually have about 100 free carry weight to pick stuff up with.  
---
i run marsupial, bird bones, eagle eye, speed demon, healing factor for mutations.
---
there are very few things in the game i cant 1 shot kill to a headshot. (like scorchbeast queen, mirelurk queens and such, ya know the really big tanky things).
---
Yeah! The Tesla rifle is straight out of Automaton FO4 DLC. Might as well include the +energy damage PA arms. They looked really cool too!
---
I've never attacked another player's base. I think some of the issue that others feels is that it's a passive way at gaining XP, rather than working for it. In most cases, turrets in camps are to protect, not act as an agressor. Plus, I think it might interfere with some spawn points/quests.
---
Thank you man! Ill take that into consideration 
---
So I did that, but nothing states that effects can’t double up, only that some appear only at certain tiers.  
---
I’m not one of those assholes that can’t fucking google.  I legit cannot find exactly what you’ve claimed.  I can draw the conclusion, but I can’t prove it.  Your earlier statement makes someone out to be a liar and I just wanted some objective quality evidence.  
---
Ok, that's what I was thinking, but wasn't entirely sure from what some people were posting.
---
I was wondering what would happen if, for example, I own a workshop but I'm over at Whitesprings killing ghouls with others - could one of the others present (who are not doing the team exploit you outlined) kill me accidentally with accidental friendly fire.  From what you are saying it sounds like that is not the case.
---
Try this:
---
This subreddit has singlehandedly changed many things about the game and is a large reason the game is trending for the better.
---
Blackwater mine, by the Whitesprings, where the Uranium fever event spawns is easy to get too, the decon shower is on your right as you enter the mine from the world map. There is a wooden bridge 500 ft ish into the mine which is a good disease free source of rads.
---
I've gotten a mutation after &lt; 50 rads and had it take 5x 80% of my hp bar to get the next one.
---
I read ages ago there is a 1% chance for every 5 rads/sec your taking, i usually try to stay around 15-25 rads/sec when Im farming mutations.
---
Just make sure if you get a mutation, you clear/keep it, than swap servers, you can only get one mutation per session.
---
And always double check you have starched genes on BEFORE you hit the decon show or you'll be back at square 1 in no time, you can remove multiple/all mutations in one session.
---
I just grab what I think is useful.. and outfits? I tend to just wear what looks weird and fun...
---
&gt;I tried to post a pic of the perfectly preserved pie I won yesterday,
---
This is a perfect example of why they aren't allowed. The sub would get flooded with "look at &lt;random thing&gt; I found" and "look at this glitched out long dog!!!1!"
---
Can confirm a reboot... no luck unfortunately.
---
I did not misinterpret his statement.  I merely pointed out the hypocrisy of his statement.
---
Video driver update and reboot was done as well, unfortunately.
---
I actually think booze is OP in FO76. Alcohol is everywhere, it is so easy to find. And there are alcohol perk cards. And now moonshining is being added to the game. I’m thinking there are some serious boozers on the dev team. 
---
Edit: The above comment is the most condescending, unhelpful, non-answer, to a legit question and you lot have upvoted it almost as much as Bethesdas ACTUAL, helpful answer. TF?
---
I hope they change the perk Stabilized, I hate wearing power armor but love heavy weapons.  
---
Why are you being such a dick about this?  Why do you insist your assumptions are accurate?  You're being unhelpful, wrong and an asshole.  So good luck with that approach...
---
I feel the same way. Instigating only benefits high damage/shot weapons not really the handmade
---
Adrenal reaction currently has an issue where the upside does not appear. and only the downside exists. using a serum applies the mutation but does not show it at all until it expires and only gives the downside. if the same issue is going on with talons that would suck.
---
My own personal issue is that healing factor won’t kick in because of it, and I didn’t see it before this last patch, or at least didn’t notice it. 
---
Honestly, I get so many armor drops that I'm just surprised and pleased when I get any weapon at all!
---
That's not something you have to worry about. If someone kills you outside of the workshop, they're in a team and doing it on purpose.
---
The real broken part of this, is that you can't release the workshop, so they can literally contest/kill you/repeat, and there's nothing you can do about it besides hop servers or log off.
---
The one unique mechanic the fallout series is known for is VATS. 
---
There are ways to combat it, like crouching, invisibility, and indirect fire like explosives or grenades.
---
Though Vats is the counter to the melee playstyle and sentinel armor. The thing is, this is not call of duty. This is not an arcade shooter. It is an RPG. It is about your build, not twitch reflex aiming.
---
I've only had one since last patch though I'll admit I haven't played as much the last couple months. Just waiting on new content and playing Forza Motorsport 7 lol
---
My Gatling sometimes breaks on the 1st magazine, from 200% own to Oh! Crap!  of course it does have a 500 round Mag.
---
This is what Fortnite "Save the World" does.  Seasonal limited time events for seasonal limited gear.  
---
I love this kind of thing.  Happy we are getting it in 76
---
Ah so the description in that image is meant to cover a few of the things coming in Wild Appalachia and say that March is when Wild Appalachia begins. We've got more quests and all kinds of new stuff in store over the coming months. Next week's patch is the tip of the iceberg. :)
---
thxxxx
---
Well that is exactly what I was asking for clarification on.  I haven't really claimed any workshops since the recent change.  But I've been seeing a lot of posts saying *exactly* what you just said and wanted to know how it worked.
---
So does that mean I can own a workshop, go about my day wandering West Virginia, and someone can just walk up to me and kill me without having visited my workshop to start the process?  From what u/Mo0kish above said, that is NOT the case.  It sounds like a team could make a workshop owner's life miserable, though.
---
I'm usually in a party chat, so I'm only leaving that party chat if it seems like its worth it. 
---
Its survival. Again SURVIVAL. SURVIVE OR DIE. get out of the server. Why be bullied? You let them win lol
---
We have a [Known Issues and Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/) list that we update. It used to be pinned but I think reddit can only pin so many things at once. We have another update to it with more current status that I believe will happen Monday.
---
fight back lol...
---
jesus fucking christ
---
So what happens is they have 2 cap before attacking you
---
Hope they change the perk Stabilized, I dislike Power-Armor but like heavy guns.
---
LMAO YES! I got so excited when I saw this post I've been WAITING for this article to go up so I could be the bearer of good news!
---
but how is someone supposed to contest it if they can't kill you?
---
We have a timeline for the next nine months. Babies will be conceived and born by the time we're done with this Roadmap. Let's let Bethesda do their work, ok?
---
Pretty stable for me, XB1
---
As I first time reddit user id like to say I agree. Seems like a good group of gamers here, with good helpful info 👍 glad i downloaded reddit!
---
So from the scenario that  u/Mo0kish stated above, it sounds like it requires a team to do this.  My question was more geared toward getting killed by an individual while out exploring (not at the workshop) - and would that individual have needed to visit the workshop first (either intentionally or otherwise.)
---
Thanks man! Thats why im lookin for AAE now since TSE is basically same dmg but with worse accuracy 
---
The release said that the masks are very rare, so I just hope it doesn't turn into a thing where everyone is grinding that same mission for a week straight over and over and over again in order to get all the masks.
---
I do want those masks though!
---
if it turns of pacifist automatically then you aren't claiming it in pacifist, which is what I said...
---
Where on earth is fanboy an insult... seriously, if there are people who feel offended by that word, then they have no other problems.  And I just call people a fanboy who act like one, as I explained numerous times by now. If you don’t believe me that such overly reacting folks who are „defending“ this game against everything, even humanly directed criticism, exist, then you’re pretty new to this subreddit. 
---
Gimme gimme gimme
---
I literally have zero screws. I can't even repair my armor right now.
---
Let me know how it is, lol
---
I need to give Anthem a break at this rate...
---
Post Pics!
---
If they leave the build area, the workshop isn't contested anymore, and they can't PvP you. They have to go back into the build area, pay the caps again, and wait for you to come to the workshop.
---
“This is my melee build” - OP.  
---
I’m nowhere near a power-gamer, but… thanks? 
---
Also I can hear 2 mouse clicks at the end of the vid.
---
K? It was a poor one. 
---
We used to get this kind of thing in Runescape for every ‘holiday’ and this is going back ten plus years ago, so the concept is nothing new. Holiday event items became ‘rares’ and those rares now sell in game for millions and millions of in game currency. 
---
You on PC? I’m online right now
---
I stick to my Brotherhood Energy Weapons build. In 6 months, I'll be able to say "I remember when Energy Weapons would break 6 times during a Queen fight. I'd have to hop out of my PA, repair in a nuke zone, and do to going uphill both ways."
---
There are LOTS of reasons (lore-wise, as well as in reality) that a less "powerful" weapon would be preferred to something with a huge 'punch'.
---
Remember, when these weapons were being mass-produced, they were not looking at them to be used against Deathclaws, or MegaSloths, or Scorchbeasts.  Those didn't exist.  They were produced to use against humans.....primarily humans that were unarmored or lightly-armored.  The damage they did was more than sufficient.
---
Second is ammunition.  Energy cells are easy to produce, recharge, etc.  Ballistic ammunition is much heavier per-shot, produces casings as waste, etc.  Most energy weapons are very quiet....no need for surpressors.  Though it's quite obvious (usually) where the shot came from, so it's not a snipers go-to (unless you use a non-visible wavelength).
---
They built laser and plasma weapons because they were cheap to operate, and ammunition was much more efficient.  Not so in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but that wouldn't have been their concern.  The "power" of each shot isn't as big of a concern, due to the targets they were designed for.....the US military primarily uses .45 and 5.56 ammunition currently, but there are much more powerful rounds available.  Why aren't they using "more powerful" ammunition?  Cost and efficiency.
---
However, the "power" of energy weapons definitely needs a buff.  Whether or not the amount they gave them is enough or not, will be seen soon.
---
I agree to a point.  Bethesda gives us the option to opt out of PVP with the pacifist toggle. The issue being brought up here is that if you have chosen to be a pacifist, other players shouldn’t be able to smack you and still do damage. And to be honest it sounds like this dude was out right griefing anyways 
---
I am but my internet is out right now.
---
Not quite. Got to the end and the game shut down. Had no team so could not get back to server. Oh well, at least I know the layout now.
---
:(
---
Yeah that's on me not the voice actor, I missed it when doing my final look over...oops.
---
Damn you really *YEETED* that OLD MAN. 
---
BET YOU FEEL REAL COOL NOW 
---
Talons isn't showing up at all unfortunately, it's not the worst since I don't use melee too often, but I still wanted it since I've got everything ekse other than Herbivore.
---
I thought for whatever reason they were removed from the last patch or two and not yet put back in. 
---
Yeah I still agree that's very fair and reasonable... but also maintain it's weird that multiple people find this thread from roughly the same browsing /reading speed and habits (which subs they open and browse in what order), open this post, see my comment, and all reply to it 2 minutes apart like clockwork. It's just suspicious to be bombarded like that taking turns.
---
It has definitely gotten better. A tweaks here and there and we will be on par with a BGS fallout game. 
---
You could impart some knowledge though: while I wouldn't mind a small "donation" of a few dozen screws, teach a man to farm screws and he'll repair armor for life.
---
Exactly! I should have worded in better, by that I meant living NPCs and dialog choices. The trade being real, natural interaction with those who inhabit the world with you (those who opt-in to voice chat at least, though emotes sometimes get the job done.) I like being able to make my own story without being shackled to the archetype, or archetypes that are written for me.
---
&gt;Where on earth is fanboy an insult.
---
You clearly are using it as an insult. Your own definition of what these people are doing ("overly reacting folks who are „defending“ this game against everything, even humanly directed criticism") makes that clear.
---
&gt;...then you’re pretty new to this subreddit.
---
I’ve been here since it was created.
---
The only problem I can see with this line of thought is that if you are playing pacifist and pay caps to take a workshop, you most likely are playing a character that can play against in game enemies, but not necessarily against a real person.  All that person wants to do is get exp, fight enemies and get matetials to craft. So a low level 25 character, for example, can take a shop and then a level 125 character can come in all perked up with thier explosive weapons and just cream the level 25 over and over and over (tea bagging and all).  There is almost no way this comes out as a positive in game experience except for the greifer.  This is a severely flawed/unbalanced game mechanic that is far from a level playing field.  It will continue to deter a lot of new/low level people from returning to the game and continue to play it.  There needs to be distinctly different types of game servers.  Hopefully Bethesda realizes this and will do something about it... soon...
---
Come back and give it a shot. I started last week and I've only actually crashed once. There's definitely bugs but nothing seems game-breaking.
---
From what I can tell from the people who have been playing since launch, the main issue right now is lack of end-game content.
---
I can help if need be
---
Have you toggled the search for them on? X I think? Basically I pick them up without thinking now.. typewriters, globes, hotplates, fans, for starters
---
Bethesda is extremely active here and a lot of changes we suggest are directly implemented into the game.
---
Depends if it's all the people complaining about every patch or balance. Unless they are spending money to fund our DLC I suppose.
---

We lost btw.  Dead server, no one attempted to help 
---
for other cards, of course ammosmith, super duper, white knight, power smith, power patcher, weapon artisan and all the crafting support cards.  
---
situational cards rad sponge, ghoulish (for parties in a nuke zone), other weapon repair perks, also the camp construction perks and so on. good doggy for when down to eating canned dog food, cannibalism, and other stuff to make qol a lil easier.  
---
I will say, it is a survival game. Yeah it does suck to get annihilated, but that is part of the game. Personally, I think it was nice of them to have the damage significantly reduced until you hit back because that does give you the opportunity to disengage and world hop.

From the description page:

Compatibility
---
This mod is fully compatible with Better Inventory.
---
This mod is not compatible with any other mod that modifies securetrade.swf, pipboymenu.swf, or pipboy_invpage.swf.
---
Game updates may require an update to the mod for continued functionality.
---
How long have you been playing? Did they update the terms of policy? That's right they did....after they banned people. Are they being sued several times over for various mal businesse practices? Oh shit wait they are!
---
So if you find a fifty dollar bill that someone dropped on the street. You're not guilty right? Even though that belonged to you? Ha. Please don't ever try and run an industry.
---
I have them tagged but I don't seem to find enough. To be fair I repair stuff quite often too. I don't have that many perks to cut down repair costs. Guess I should get White Knight as soon as I hit the level.
---
Let’s say I’ve got a couple workshops that I’ve put time and caps into? Should I have to server hop and lose everything because someone else is an asshat?
---
I'm the same way.
---
yeah, if they don't cover the top of the head, they never should
---
I usually go it alone, too, but the other day is was at the west end of the tunnel and had cleared the place out when all of a sudden I was knocked but a high level scorched. It dawned on me it was because a high-level player had just showed up, so I called for help rather than just give up and thankfully the high-level player revived me. 
---
Solid.
---
I've got a lever action you'd probably be interested in. May have a few pistols.
---
We have content this whole year so we don't need information on anything after that yet. 
---
It's been pretty bad for me this morning, too. I was disconnected two or three times, lost some stuff I had bought from a vendor, but nothing major.
---
Plasma flamer benefits from rifleman perks. You can mod any plasma rifle/pistol into the flamer with the mod and you buy the mod from the enclave bunker.
---
Me too. Most of the time, I just want to be left alone. I will help lower level players anytime I can. And I will help fight enemies. But I really have no urge to PvP. 
---
Is stealth getting fixed? This problem has been around a long time now and I’ve stopped playing until it’s fixed, updates on this would be awesome!

Not a totally complete list, but the one I most readily have access to via bookmarks...  [Fallout 76 Apparel Guide](http://dulfy.net/2018/11/23/fallout-76-apparel-and-outfits-guide/)

This. I mean it's cool and all, but yeah, this is all definitely unintended exploitation of animation cancelling and server-client lag.
---
I saw a guy wearing a bathrobe and a beer hat standing in the field outside the asylum, I sooo want that in a poster titled “Escape to the Wasteland”!
---
The crux of the problem is that most enemies are simply copies of existing FO4 enemies, and their DR for both energy and ballistic are just equal.  They shouldn't be.  I don't care what kind of hide an animal has, a laser is still going to burn it.  Leather isn't the same, it's been tanned and treated.  When it's still on the animal, the laser is going to do a LOT to it.  A robot?  Not so much.  All that polished chrome and glossy paint?  It would reflect a lot.  But aside from military combat robots, ballistic damage should be a lot more effective.
---
Enemies need to have WEAKNESSES.  And they should be significant.  Most don't, they are simply bullet-sponges.  If they have a weakness, it's very slight.  Learning what creatures/enemies have what weaknesses, and having the weaponry to exploit them when you need it, should be part of the game.  It isn't.  
---
Thats good. I had a feeling. Tons of friends are on here that i game with also so its cool we have a place to connect and get voices out there

Ammo Exchange - The only true way to farm Fuel.
---
I am level 101 and it didn't pop for me. Any luck with yours?
---
That really is a shame, too.  I play with pacifist mode turned on so I don't accidentally "friendly fire" anyone.  I used to take some workshops often - mainly the poseidon yard (for fusion cores) and occasionally some others (for fast travel locations.)  However, I would usually build it up and leave everything unlocked for passers-by to benefit.  I'd even put up the vault-boy cardboard standups to point people to containers where I'd put extra stuff (plans I already knew, extra ammo, junk I didn't want/need/couldn't carry, etc).  I have the "small letters" plan, so I'd usually put a sign on the fusion core machine saying "Help Yourself!"  The hope was that people would see that everything was available to them without having to own the shop, so it usually wouldn't get contested - and I was always able to get more than enough fusion cores/other resources while keeping everything open and unlocked.  And if someone decided they *needed* to own the workshop, so be it.  The only thing I really lost was a fast travel point.  And that only happened to me once.  Now, though, I don't think I'd like to have to deal with a team who just wants to grief me.
---
Then go play fortnite then and let fallout be an immersive rpg.
---
well i dont see em doing too big a dupe wipe and unless you were standing next to the person when they "say" they found it how would you really know? bethesda just ran a dupe wipe a few weeks ago, but left atleast 1 in the inventory of whoever had one. so if you were to buy a duped one i dont see it ever disappearing on you but then again it goes back to the person ya buying something off of. if they did dupe it they not gonna admit it to ya in the first place and youd only really know if they had 20 other ones to sell in the trade screen too. 
---
as far as people going "oh no this is legit, i found it" again going on trust here how do you really know some anonymous person possibly on the other side of the country..
---
and i think thats why bethesda didnt do a full wipe of everything. they didnt want to hurt those of us who traded for things, in good faith, that may have very well ended up with something they traded for that was duped.
---
word up, ur last point is why I'm starting to despise my tse handmade
---
those power core plants put out ten per hour. They're fully charged, but..10. I can easily get that volume of power server-hopping in watoga in about fifteen minutes. 
---
As for acid..yeah, absolutely, they're great. If you need to buck down a bunch of lead ore or make insane amounts of gunpowder, I can see it. But it's more risk than I'm comfortable with. 
---
what's the point of pacifist mode, period?
---
how do you respec? Just keep leveling?
---
  Once I found a compatible mic (i couldnt find the one that shipped with my PS4, and Apple earbuds dont play nice on the PS4) it stays open all the time, usually in area chat.  
---
 Lets me announce my intention when I am approaching other players - hello playername, just passing through, not here to take the workbench, just to help with the defend event, etc.  Hey level 2, dont run, I have (stuff) for you/left stuff in x container for you. 
---
Fully understand OPs position.
---
How few people don't have mic+earbuds for thier phone?  
---
Most likely, they'll work, regardless of platform.

If you are just standing in front of me totally silent - I can't read your mind, and don't know what it is you need/want, or if I even have what I think is excess to give you.  Note I said give, not sell.  And I can tell you if I have it faster than you can scroll my inventory.
---
I mean of course they won't stick around and do it forever. Eventually the target base will disappear as people give up on the game. But until then, no, they aren't going to bugger off to the PVP server. 
---
To my knowledge, again, there's absolutely zero basis for your assumption about better legendary items. 
---
Nice to see a durability buff but that 10% damage buff is not going to be enough.
---
A laser sniper rifle for me sits at 67 damage, where i need to wait 3 seconds for it to recharge back to full damage after each shot. 
---
By comparison a Hunting Rifle sits at 125 damage WITH additional armor penetration, and the rate of fire is greater. Compared to the Lever-Action it looks even more bleak.
---
Comparing the regular semi-auto laser to the handmade we see that the laser rifle sits for me at about 52 damage with the handmade at 81.
---
These numbers are for me and my build so you might see different numbers, it just serves to illustrate how far behind the Laser weapons are and how a 10% damage buff is not going to really matter much.
---
The Laser Sniper Rifle could have its damage doubled and i'd still take a hunting rifle over it.
---
Cool. Not really arguing either. Just pointing out how I got here, and that was shortly after you made that edit. 
---
I do not open reddit to /all, so top stories of my subbed groups are right there. Your post was at the top then.
---
In that case maybe bring them into the tennis court and use the net as a kite zone. I usually use my flamer in the same way. Just burn everything in site.
---
Thanks, I've been wondering what perks to shoot for. 
---
Whoa really? I have totally missed that quest apparently 
---
Yeah good luck man. I'm not in the middle of nowhere (I'm near a couple things) but I'm not near major merchant stops or anything like that, still have the occasional griefer. 
---
Just started playing a few days ago with my girlfriend, her sister, and brother in law. Every time we run into someone lvl 30 or higher they just kill us all. I have learned to fear others and run away XD
---
Whol....wholesome?
---
To some people I suppose? Eh, can’t make everyone laugh! I’ve had more positive than negative feedback. Had some laughs listening to other people’s stories so, I’ll tick it off as a win on my battered clipboard. 
---
You do not consider that this post is related to open PVP. Sure, you can use berry mentats now, when you notice a guy uses Chameleon. But in open PVP you will be in a fight before you even notice the person exists. You will be Stealth Crit sniped to death probably, so unless you intend to be constantly drugged, good luck avoiding such a thing. I predict both of you will quickly realise how game breaking this gets, when your aid inventory is lost upon death by somebody campingf a popular location or vendor. Somebody who reached the final state of gear in this game has no desire to farm legendaries or get stronger, he has what he needs already. Chances are you will not farm legendaries in open PVP, so why even bother commenting if you do not intend to use the new mode, unless you want to farm in open PVP of course...for whatever reason.
---
Mental gymnastics?  LOL.  If Bethesda thought PvP was fine as it is, they wouldn't be making those changes.  There wouldn't be a Pacifist mode.
---
That's not mental gymnastics, that's just straightforward logic.  Sorry it seems to escape you.
---
its a fuckin nuclear death filled wastedland there should be no pacifist mode at all makes 0 logical sense gtfo this game
---
why would you drop your stimpaks upon death?
---
Welcome :)
---
The nuka cola one sounds too exploitable. I could log in and leave the game on while I'm at work or asleep and come back to a ton of free nukas to sell...
---
Try firing the flamer in short bursts. The projectiles seem to have slow travel speed, and you often end up using more fuel than you need to kill enemies.
---
Good job Bethesda this is what i think the community likes to see
---
I'm also a HeteroBear...hence the lonely lol
---
Oh yes, that’s a must have!
---
People would rather the world change around them. If what you are doing does not work, do something else. 
---
Yup, every lvl after 50 let's you respect a single point
---
At level 51 you either choose a new perk card or your reallocate special points.
---
So say you have 15 points in strength but only 5 in perception, you move one point from strength to perception. Now you have 14 S and 6 P.
---
I also completed the main story at lvl 40, the silo was brutal.  After all missions were finished, I was a little bored, until I decided to farm for legendaries.   Good luck and keep leveling!
---
Nice I'm ps4 that match up with u?
---
I like to use them for porches or certain rooms that look alright with them, otherwise yeah they aren't great in a lot of houses
---
They should keep it a tickle weapon with unlimited ammo and a chance to instantly kill an enemy by turning them into a pile of green goo.
---
I haven't played since the first few days of the new year. I ran out of quests in mid-December and my enjoyment of the game just nose-dived, but I kept at it a while longer because I had a group of friends I was playing with and we kept trying to squeeze a bit more fun out of it. I'll come back to the game but not until there are more quests to do, so help me Jesus if I never farm fucking Whitespring again it will be too soon. 
---
You want to buy the flamer plans, flamers are very rare, and many of the mods can only be found by scraping. Additionally, 50 fuel is added to your inventory when you craft a flamer, so it’s a good source of fuel.
---
Also kill super muties.. just killed one who dropped 5 caps and 3 screws 
---
Can I put up a Dross Toss in my C.A.M.P?
---
I look for the players location, contest your workshop, fast travel for the kill then build it up for materials and defend it. 
---
I only take workshops that people use for fast traveling, I kill the player for a cap bonus but never take dropped junk. I hardly come across caps so anyway I can get them I will. 
---
That said I don't repeat it, I'm a solo player and half the time I don't find the player who workshop I took, due to the fact there location disappears one I contest it. 
---
I disagree. You should not be able to turn off Pvp in a survival Pvp game. That's the point of them game. The guy was certainly not griefing. He was playing the game as intended. 
---
Hila-REEEEE-ous, amirite?
---
You're actually crying after throwing 800 hours into the game? 
---
Think it's time you found another game to play.
---
The spawn rate in certain zones alows for higher legendary enemy chance then when you nuke those zones they increase the difficulty with higher level enemys so the high lvl legendarys are more likely in a nuke zoned spawn area
---
Pretty sure if someone claims your workshop, you can pvp from anywhere not just there. 
---
image isn't working for me, whats the outfit?
---
If not mistaken you have higher chance of get better legendary items and more of them in nukes. Assuming you can hit each legendary mob. 
---
Whereas in the normal non nuke it’s the same just not as high chanced. 
---
It's definitely better than launch.  I used to crash and lock up constantly, no longer.  The game does "hitch" pretty frequently but at least now it recovers instead of crashing.  
---
It's far from perfect but at least it's playable and playing the main quest + sidequests imo makes the game worth it.  My main gripe atm is lack of end game but with new content coming hopefully this will change.
---
Basicaly its a crap shoot to find the specific one you want
---
Thanks! Any place to farm loose screws? 
---
Nice try, Bethesda.
---
During the first week of this game PVP was pretty fun actually. It was decently varied and would have been even better without the restricting engagement rules. Back then I really wanted open PVP to be implemented, that was way before the entire PVP legendary meta established itself. Given that, I would agree that legendaries are somewhat problematic to balance, but on the other hand those provide long term motivation and without legendaries the healing issue would be even worse. I like the existence of PVP in 76, it creates tension and especially in the early days of this game fullfilled a certain power fantasy, when two People in Power Armor fought against another.
---
Certainly not trying to accuse you of it - and I haven't had a base there myself.  I just don't get how people are taking it on themselves to decide what the turrets are "meant for".  They shoot things.  Why wouldn't thousands of people eventually figure out that they could build a funnel for mobs to go through a player made shooting gallery?  Turrets aren't in the defense menu, they're in their own menu.
---
Still takes parts, takes time to operate, and you have to get a shot or two in on each enemy for a chance at loot/xp.  People can always server hop for quests (though none are affected by farming the clubhouse) or if they want to farm the same space.
---
What's more immersive than an event that is limited time. Not like events happen every day of the year.
---
Also, go make your own game that covers every little thing you want.  The world doesn't revolve around you.
---
If you promise things too far into the future, and plans change, then everybody gets mad. 
---
Better to keep the roadmap shorter. 
---
My biggest problem is that during the evenings I'm normally in a group chat with mates. Talking shit while often playing some different games.
---
Unfortunately I only recently found out that this turns off any in game voice conversations so I probably appear anti-social.
---
This is exactly the issue. The way mod authors got around it in FO4 was by including a chair.
---
There are quite a few more that don’t work. :( For me,  Top Of The World and multiple other locations that I’ve visited many times will not “discover”. I’ve killed many big creatures and the challenge for that won’t mark off SBQ, Sloth, or .. there’s another on there I can’t remember off the top of my head, but I know I’ve killed plenty.
---
I’ve been doing a lot of challenges trying to get ATOMs this week, and have noticed how many are bugged. :( Very frustrating.
---
You da real MVP
---
For reals though, anyone with a disability related to hearing that plays this game should get the ball rolling!
---
It would be fine for those of us who don't like pvp if they would just let us shoot npcs with it. But it's pointless for stopping griefing cause it's either passive and barely be able to do much in the game or change servers. It's not a solution to stop griefers like the comment I replied to implied. Even their parley option in red dead is better than their passive mode for that. 
---
That's what I've found! Pretty much found everything I don't want haha.
---
While this is possible, it is also very rare for most people.  I have been playing since beta and it has never happened to me.  It is probably more common at certain workshops than others (munitions factory comes to mind).  If you are the type that has enemies among other players this mechanic could be a problem for you, but if not you might never have it occur.
---
Yikes. The start of the news sounded promising only to specify there is no budget increase at all and just an adjustment to costs of items with restrictions it felt misleading. alas...as I stated I'll wait and see how it translates in game ...
---
Glad to see durability getting buffed for energy and heavy weapons, but the damage buff on the other hand is a little worrying. 10-20% should work well for some, but others need a much larger increase in base damage to make them worth a damn in the slightest. The minigun and LGM should be doubled at the very least. I'm also curious about the wording used here. They specified heavy and semi-automatic energy weapons, but the weapons as a whole are too weak save a few. Are energy weapons in their base form considered semi-automatic, or are they being left out on the buffs? Where do flamers (regular and plasma) fit in?
---
So it is just a higher spawn rate of legendary enemies. I can live with that I guess, spent 30 minutes in a nuke zone earlier and found about 10 enemies total, not a single legendary though! Just seems a great way to drain all my rad away and stims haha
---
They already do because Ive had a TS gatling laser for some time now and the damage definitely increases with Stabilized on.
---
You say no one wants to farm legendaries... how do you get legendaries if you don't farm for them? I was under the impression that this mode would be exclusive to new characters, not current "adventure mode" characters. Is that no longer the case?
---
Maybe something like:
---
* "Powerful Fusion Mag" mod: The Alien Blaster now deals 200% base damage and uses Fusion Cells.
---
The basic one can be explained as an effort by Earth scientists to make use of the weapons and failing, while the "Powerful Fusion Magazine" can be explained lorewise as a Flatwoods Monster/Zetan alien adapting their own weapons in lieu of not having access to their usual Alien Power Cells.
---
Ad this and putting the Alien Blaster into the Legendary pool and you've got yourself another potential 4\* Legendary like the Scorched Killer Receiver mod and Sacrificial Blade mod.
---
this is true but in my experience it rarely happens.  There's a lot of people who loath PvP that play this game and thus these players are very vocal about this but I've never had it happen to me.    
---
Think of it like a yelp or amazon review.  People are WAY more likely to post negative reviews than positive ones.  So it might seem like it's a huge out of control problem but its really not.  
---
Just be aware and don't carry a bunch of junk you can't afford to lose.  It's not like the death penalty from PvP is meaningful unless you just collected a bunch of flux/fluids/masses etc.
---
I feel ya. I can on good day when I feel like dealing nukes and nuke zone tactics I can on my own get 10ish items and what ever people drop. 
---
My digital was over 100 gigs 
---
I'm the pvper man lol
---
Game gets better bit by bit. Still lurking around half-assedly playing casually, just enjoying scavving. Keep it up.
---
Actually no :/
---
Being able to exchange for a different type of ammo would be great.
---
its @#$@#%^ ridiculously big, i know that
---
i think my footprint for fo76 now is over 100 gigs
---
4 months after release I am playing Fallout 76 on Xbox One X and it looks ugly!
---
Blocky, glimmering, fps stuttering, HDR lighting looks like it was coded by beginners.
---
I can honestly say, Fallout 76 on the Xbox One X is terrible ...the graphics have been degraded, for what reason I don't know!
---
NOT 4K ...and not really HDR, its disgusting really.  Its made me so angry, AGAIN, at Bethesda.
---
Something is very wrong in the ranks of Bethesda game studios, something criminal is going on.
---
Ah cool, thanks for the clarification.
---
You can find quite a few in Morgantown in the workshop that the police bot comes out from for Back on the Beat
---
Also ammo is much cheaper/more common than flamer fuel. Get a decent plasma gun and add the true flamer barrel, melt faces.
---
And I hope you stub your pinky toe on the kitchen chair tomorrow morning. 
---
wow, that's a great tactic.  Thanks for the advice
---
But you can sell ammo, there is an entire sub/reddit devoted to selling things.
---
I frequently Buy and sell ammo with other players, and trade ammo with friends.
---
Not everyone uses the same weapons, but we all tend to pick up every little bullet we see, so just find a few in game friends, or customers, and sell to other players.
---
Is there one that will send you into a rage? Cause that's be dope. An alcoholic berserker melee class would be hella fun
---
It should. Unless energy weaps get a perk for that very effect. 
---
Dont know if this works solo but yeah you can do that just to make someone hostile 
---
Holy shit, yes. We had a problem with someone who was 30 levels below us, one shot killing us with a power fist while we were in decked out power armor. Yes, this was before the last big patch but even going into pacifist mode wouldn't stop it. It just meant that he could keep killing us and we couldn't touch him. So it was pretty fucking pointless. And yes, we could have server hopped. But we were just trying to get all of our junk back to a storage box because we had just spent hours grinding for things we really needed. And the fact that pacifist mode was that useless almost made us stop playing. I understand that things need reworking but what was the point of even putting pacifist mode into the game if they can still kill you?
---
Thanks. I'll check it out when I log back in.
---
Also I feel that armor and guns should definitely give screws when scrapped. 
---
I find the mire and cranberry bog drop better legendarys regardless of a nuke. Maybe it's look but I've found more 2 and 3 stars there than anywhere else, enemies and weapons I mean. The mire has mirelurk queen's and the bog for super mutants... Only get shit one stars from, 2 if I'm lucky for nuke zones and events... That being whitesprings and fissure sites...
---
I have better look when stumbling on legendary enemies out of the way, weirdly. Really random places.. 
---
I have a cook build. Mostly soup and tea.
---
Just the paint. What do you want for it?
---
Absolutely yeah. There's 2 holotapes from 'human' Rose. The cutesy one with David that's in the observation deck with robot Rose and that one in the Cap building. I love that one in the Capital:
---
Responder: "What's your name?"
---
Rose: "Fuuuuuuuuuuck you..."
---
lol.
---
I always figured that if one of us looked around hard enuff we'd find some term entry or holotape about one of the previously wealthy guests at Top Of The World (who we know became the raiders) who was a robco engineer or something.  :Shrug
---
Nice. Thanks.
---
Seems like damn near everything is "found in Whitesprings".
---
I see a lot of folks who started out in group had a hard time appreciating the story delivery . The holotape nature of having to pay attention to non-chat dialogue, which on occasion is very long, is contrary to running with a team. It's less fun because you want to get back to your team and not listen to the tape. At the same time you want to listen to the tape to get the story. Both feelings take away from the enjoyment.  
---
Maybe  quality of life change could be a TLDL button option for the tapes you pick up to tag them for listening later. 
---
Agreed, there is something missing more than just a little punch.  Lasers are dramatically behind ballistic.  A 10% is not only half useless, but it still leaves the RP lacking.  Lasers were supposed to be some of the latest/greatest weapons.  My guess is they'll still be lame.
---
It's so hit and miss, I guess that's makes it exciting when you do get a good haul though. Thanks man
---
I'm no developer, but it seems like it would be easy to add that area to the "no build list". Wonder why it's taking so long. 
---
exactly why we don't play rust - Though I would not mind diving into to dabble .. 
---
There is zero evidence that they will be changing current servers, beyond a change of name to "adventure". Grifers will not move to PVP servers, this change will do nothing positive. 
---
I am not associated with Bethesda in any way. 
---
Others will disagree, but in my opinion the 2/10 patch made workshops essentially worthless for gathering resources and they are just PVP zones now. 
---
They can be contested without having to interact with the work bench, which makes them impossible to defend with turrets and traps. 
---
Considering how much they produce, they simply aren't worth fighting over.
---
Before the patch, the idea was to take over, say, grafton steel, then leave it and let the machines do their work while I went out to go  farm steel and lead elsewhere.    So when I  got done farming elsewhere out in the world, I'd come back to grafton and the machines would have  little extra steel and lead and I  could make a pretty hefty supply of ammo. 
---
But since it's so incredibly easy for someone to start a fight over the workshop now, I don't even bother with it anymore.
---
I can see what you mean. This game, in my opinion, is a sol player's dream. So much to discover and explore.
---
But as a group? Yeah, I can see that. I have a buddy that plays everything in a "Leeeeeeroy Jennnnnnnkins" playstyle. He'd hate it.
---
Any new information on the bugged stealth mechanic? 
---
get lost raider scum
---
Damn I am on PC.
---
Of course armor was made to stop ballistic projectiles; nobody needed to worry about the energy ticklers.
---
It’s a numbers game. I can farm Watoga every 20ish minutes and walk away with 4-5 for selling and whatnot. But the nuke is a risk reward. 
---
Im the same way, glad I grinded my ass off before they broke armor mods, as much as I hated every minute of it. 
---
That isnt the only mod thats missing from vendors (by far the most talked about). I kept track of what I found where over the course of a week server hopping before patch 5.  I found roughly 80 different armor mod plans at select vendors. Now, there are only 5 across all vendors.
---
This is my WV white trash meth-head build.  
---
This is my kinda dumb cowboy-wannabe build.
---
This is my Annie Oakley sniper build.
---
I think the slot will eventually be for a power armor/melee/heavy weapons build...and I will love him and hug him and squeeze him and name him George. :P
---
Bah, the wasteland knows only one law...survival.  That's why my group formed the Bowler Hat Gang. 
---
If you want to join we have two rules, you have to have a bowler hat,  and you gotta step in the ring for some fisticuffs with one of the gang. 
---
You don't have to win, you just have to prove you've got moxie and can take your licks. 
---
Seriously though, I think people forget that Fallout is an RPG first, shooter second. 
---
yeah no I'm not super psyched. "some masks are super rare" is also a kick in the dick. It's a week long event with a fucking _boring_ sounding event, that has to be mass-farmed to get quality loot.  
---
I guess the reason people predominantly use whitesprings is for the ease of enemy then? The only experience I've had with mirelurk queen's was traumatic haha! But then it would make sense that for the better drop chance you have to work for it!
---
&gt;this is true but in my experience it rarely happens. 
---
I find that workshops get attacked by other players way more often since the 2/19 patch. For me it isn't rare, it's more or less the norm. 
---
Ouch
---
I think around level 30 was my hardest to play. It eventually got easier. 
---
Okay the other issues are probably down to input lag as I've noticed the silhouetting and shimmering when a scorch died when doing the quest at Fort Defiance. But when you've killed a charred scorched, the body disappears (this happens a lot as the body especially legendary scorched is transported to it's original starting point) but a few moments later the mutilated animated corpse minus the arms starts walking off the picture through the wall. *&amp;^*%$* this is taking the proverbial p*ss take!    
---
The drop rates need increased a “little” bit!
---
I found the mask, one time, right down the road from the High School. In the blocked off, middle-of-the-street Responders camp. I haven't played in a month so I'm forgetting the names of places. :P
---
Yeah... I have spreadsheets.  It can be a problem. On the other hand, I save a lot of "valuable role-playing and story participation" time by not having to sit at the level up screens for very long while my teammates are trying to get to the next quest locations.  I glance over at the sheet, look what level I just got, and then choose my perk by what the spreadsheet tells me. :)   
---
\#slavetothesheets
---
Working on my melee character so this is super helpfull for me! Thanks!
---
Boo
---
What's the point of turrets at your base if it doesn't protect? If someone comes and attacks your base, your turrets should defend it! Also you should get an alert popup on the screen starting your base was under attack. The other night my base was getting attached and I didn't know until I went to the map to fast travel and saw the horror!
---
I get that this is an online game, and PvP is a large part of it, but kids will be kids. Ive been asked to trade and because I want to play the game with others, I chose to engage in trade, and when I refused a trade I was attacked and killed. I'm the kind of guy who these guys would walk around in real life and I find keyboard cowboys to be immature and mildy pathetic.
---
It's not compatible from what I can tell
---
You have now inspired my new characters support build...
---
But he's gonna be a party boy and do shots to wake everyone up.
---
Nice! Any chance the railway rifle is going to benefit from perks now with patch 7 too?
---
I might actually join as a Raider Leader.
---
Maybe the programming is messed up or not enough peer to reach terminal that controls it. 
---
I thought the same thing. 
---
I'm all of that except a terminal bachelor. :P  
---
\#HeteroBearHighFive
---
Lol anytime glad I can help 
---
I love this idea, and have privately hoped that it will become a reality. I can understand that, for balancing purposes, it might not be practical to include, but with the new content coming, especially the vault raids, I'm hopeful that the difficulty will increase, thus leaving room for legendary power armor to be a balanced way to play late end game content.
---
Imagine thinking "utterly disappointing" is constructive criticism. Yikes.
---
Much luck with your building bud.
---
Funny you mention it. Our next story arc is based around the Wolfpack going up against raiders. 
---
My digital says 53.75 GB
---
Better have your quack surgeon perk card equipped! 
---
Xbone
---
Damn right! 
---
Coming soon to an atom shop near you.
---
The bog is so good. Watoga itself is treasure trove of things to be had. 
---
If you wanna add another one to your list wandering the wilderness between haven church in the mire and the chemical plant I've found at Least 6 legendary enemies over the past few weeks. Not an event just out there hanging out
---
&gt;P.S - This is my first post, sorry if haven't followed any protocol. Please guide me where to find if this group has any !
---
In every subreddit you find the rules and guidelines for posting on the right side bar, just scroll down a bit. Also, when your are creating a post directly from the links in the subreddit, there's usually a link or a window pointing to the rules, depending in which subreddit you are posting from. 
---
Screws are everywhere.... Seriously. I struggle to use them. If your Xbox I'll give you 150 for free! I do use them but always find them.
---
Nice to see even a slight buff to the alien blaster but ultimately I think the community would love to see it buffed to the epic level from past games. With the limited ammo it should be devastating and the fusion mag should be around ultracite gun levels of damage.
---
Just my two cents
---
I will take your advice but i have a knack for regaining caps fast somehow
---
Which part of watoga? I normally loop the streets and have occasionally found them. I'm guessing it's inside the buildings which give more chance?
---
Notes that the atomic shop will never give a gameplay advantage item.
---
If they add real combos then i am all for removing animation cancelling but as is i see it like the bxr from halo 2. If you have good enough timing and skill these sorts of exploits should be allowed as its more of a reward for good coordination that can help seperate you from everyone else.
---
Tbf havent watched the vid or tried this so idk how much skill this cancelling requires.
---
You’re inviting PvPers when you take workshops. That’s why he could just “open up” on you. I’ve been in lobbies where that’s all someone will do; go hunt people who take workshops. They get a caps reward equal to that player’s level. It’s advantageous to kill someone who owns a workshop because, unlike you would if you initiate a PvP, you don’t automatically incur a wanted bounty. Workshop owners are fair game.
---
10 STR at level 12 means that you’re just sinking points into STR. If you’ve taken the corresponding melee perks then your swings are going to do almost as much damage anyone else’s. Youre a slow glass cannon, but you hit hard. Keep in mind that stats stop advancing at level 50. Level 50 could have the exact same build as a level 200. From the sounds of it, you’ve also been building on nothing but STR/melee and essentially could have the same melee power as a lvl 50. You’re lacking in other areas, but by focusing on one thing you do that one thing well.
---
I put on adrenal reaction after it disappeared entirely from my mutations list... I'm pretty sure it's working but neither the positive or negative effects are listed. Very strange.
---
Fingers crossed the railway rifle might now benefit from rifleman perks
---
I love this game. I'm just ready to leave WV!
---
I use to always repair the auto doc in vault city (fo2) always cracked me up when you'd inspect it and it would say it was filed with dust. I love FO76 but there are a ton of little things like the auto doc  we can't us that bum me out.
---
I've seen offers all over the place on here but I do it for a 1000 because that seems like the middle ground
---
I found 2 recipes there but maybe I’m looking in the wrong spot?
---
Then you didn’t read the announcement. 
---
They specifically said you’ll be able to use existing characters. 
---
Legendaries, Vats, and Stealth need Uber nerfs or should be removed for survival mode, else things will be an open instakill gankfest. 
---
Oooh. Could I join?
---
I'll try adding that to my daily route! Thanks!
---
The whole in general. I normally run the streets shooting all the bot tubes. Then hit the transit hub, emergency services, municipal building, civic center and then AMS. By the time I complete that I’m over encumbered and the street bots respawn. Clear any city events. Kill the deathclaw in the power substation and the Mirelurk queen in the south. 
---
Handle my loots and repair. Rinse repeat and gg
---
What system are you on? This is something that actually has me posting on reddit, rather than lurking. Great work, btw,
---
Eh, I don't have one. I'm sorry. :c
---
Yeah. Pretty much. Is there a particular outfit you're on the hunt for?
---
Pretty much the same thing with Talons then, except I never had it before I took the serum, it's strange and annoying but I enjoy the game too much to let that ruin it for me.
---
Honestly, are you dumb or really trying to ignore what I am saying? How do you intend to kill a player, power armor or not, if you can not one shot kill him and he immediately heals all damage taken? Are you really so ignorant? I seriously doubt you ever fought a coordinated team, but you instead were the one fighting PVE players. One guy in Power armor acts as a support for the reast of the team, he has team medic and heal perks on. He heals up the players without power armor, as he has no Cooldown and prevents his team from ever being killable. You can not counter this heal, so stop acting like I am the fool here, I have obviously embraced the BS PVP Meta in this game to a further extent than you, but apprently I am the only one here to point out the BS by its roots and wants to see the game improve, rather than arguing for stagnation, you god damn caveman.
---
Theres also a cave inside at the top w/ open gold and crystal deposits and its full of cave crickets
---
When a PvP noob makes a post.
---
I’m not sure we’re playing the same game. I have a 250 character with full sentinel assassin, a vats crit will 1 shot me, a rifle with tank killer will take me down fairly quick, a strong melee build will one shot me, that hardly sounds like god mode.
---
And wtf is this spam healing bs you’re talking about, cause it’s not a thing, if you really think you can out heal a bloodied handmade smacking you for 250 damage a bullet in the head you are high on meth. And no matter what heals you have, even if it’s a ultra heal stimpack that doesn’t exist and gives you 100% health instantly and 200% health over time, I could still kill you in one shot with my bloodied gauss or a second or two with a strong handmade.
---
Not to mention like I said before, a vats crit with a power rifle will 1 shot almost any build in the game.
---
I suggest you git gud and stop complaining and whining, because me and a lot of other players will be taking all your stimpacks, chems, and junk in survival mode.
---
hmmm, i was sure just my last patch was that much
---
That or using a doorway as a choke point could work.
---
Looking for a lever action lvl 45
---
Restore it’s original damage bonuses?   I am going to buy Atoms in celebration. 
---
Crazy. Never happened to me but I heard about some teams doing this to steal a players caps.
---
&gt;If you allow ammo to be traded to a vendor, that immidiately sets the value of a single round to 1 cap minimum.
---
Easy solution: use the tinker bench to bulk the ammo in chunks of 100/250/500 (whatever), and have the vendors buy them for pennies on the dollar. If someone wants to take the time to find another player to buy their shotgun shells for .5 caps each they can do that, and people who just want to get rid of it can sell them to the vendors for 25 caps per 100 shells.
---
BAM! Economy maintained for traders, and a small cap faucet for everyone else.
---
I absolutely agree that nobody should be doing 15,000 damage with a golf club and killing some guy in and advanced suit of power armor with one hit (extreme example).
---
And, nobody should survive a "Mini Nuke" going off 10 feet away either.
---
Melee damage should just never be a "1 hit kill" unless it's a "critical hit", say from behind, by surprise, etc.
---
When two players are facing each other, and see each other any weapon other than a nuke should take multiple hits - every fight should be like a dance and not drastically lopsided (unless one player just has no clue, can't aim, and doesn't use VATS).
---
Having the game setup so that players that "min max" and research how to exploit "perks" and flaws in the game to get insanely high damage - yes, you're absolutley right, that simply shouldn't apply to PVP.
---
At most, the best player should kill the other guy in 3 hits, instead of four hits, except for headshots and "sneak attacks".
---
Perhaps a headshot from stealth, or a sneak melee attack from behind should be able to take away 90% health no matter how tough your enemy is?
---
I hope so! I have a 3* ultracite laser rifle just waiting to come out. 
---
I'm such a hoarder that on 4 I put together a wasteland museum at Egrets even in survival without mods. But yeah I collected power armor too, with all the different upgrades. Most of them were in Hangman's Alley but then I started putting purpose built ones in strategic settlements. Super mutant slayers over in Country Crossing, rad based ones, T60 and Raider, over in Somerville Place, 2 in every community with an extra repair station in case I visited there in PA. And this is of course with ones I found because purchasing framed felt like cheating. 
---
Excellent post. I LOVE people who pvp in power armor.  There’s no easier target. I can VATS headshot crit and never give away my position. Chameleon and  especially stealthboys are a tough combination to fight against and this is from someone who uses them liberally. I fear stealthboy melees more than anyone else because if they’re good in a big team fight it’s hard to keep track of them. Berry mentats don’t always work either.
---
Everything has a counter especially on team vs team situations and I love that aspect.
---
if you're on pc i can spare some screws for a modest fee. 
---
This was pretty cool. Shame you guys are only on PS4. I'm on PC,and haven't had any luck finding rp groups. But, great work, a neat little trailer.
---
If we have a rad shower for camps, we should have this as a way to cure diseases in camps too
---
Your points are mostly good. I made a couple threads in the past month or so discussing these issues that never got off the ground unfortunately. 
---
Melee is only OP due to legendaries and VATS enabling instakill - teleporting builds that have no counter. 
---
Ironically, legendaries, vats, and stealthboys/chameleon are the 3 biggest issues facing PvP. If they just removed these features from Survival Mode, we’d actually have a fairly decent time PvPing. 
---
Melee would be a huge gamble, but you wouldn’t be able to teleport behind someone and instantly kill them. No one would be an unkillable tank that could stand still. People could still hide and sneak attack, but would have to strategically use cover and such. 
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info
---
Well, I never bothered to actually do any story on my way to level 100andsomething
---
So that might be worthwhile, haha
---
I don't understand what you're saying ? 
---
If I am in pacifist mode and I decide I want to claim a Work Shop. I should be able too and when I click to claim it, it gives me a warning that I can now be attacked and have entered PVP mode. Now once in PVP mode I should be stuck in PVP mode for the entirety of me being in the Work Shop area or 10 mins after I exit the area where I could then toggle off of PVP and back onto Pacifist 
---
 "also you shouldn't be able to take workshops in pacifist
---
I think you should be able too.. it just should turn off pacifist mode? And you have to wait like 10 mins to be able to toggle it back on.
---
if it turns of pacifist automatically then you aren't claiming it in pacifist, which is what I said..."
---
Maybe I am not understanding you .. but yeah .. I'm not understanding you. 
---
Np
---
I am usually on around 5 to 6 ET and then again at like 8-10.  And then a little more on the weekend.  My gamertag is same as username here.  Stop by sometime, currently at the driving range at whitespring!
---
I love this! Nice job! The pantless raider at 1:13 caught me off guard though, he meant business
---
Even at 75%, it would be better than anything else in the game by far, and it requires nothing of the player. Consider that Berserker requires the player to have no armor to do good damage, and bloodied requires you to sit at 9% for max benefit or 19% for very good benefit (still not as high as 75% though). 
---
Two Shot has an accuracy penalty and recoil penalty, but I think we can all agree those are far, far less of a penalty than Berserker / Bloodied. Explosive costs the player nothing. So unless they intend to buff Bloodied and Berserkers, I really can't see TSE needing a buff. TSE weapons are still good, and they don't have the huge drawbacks that Bloodied / Berserkers have, or the limits that things like Instigating, Ghoul Slaying, etc. have. TSE is the most situationally agnostic set of legendary affixes there is. You could argue for Mutants I guess, but that's a mere 10% boost.
---
Personally I'm fine with it, and I'm very glad that all those duped TSE weapons are no longer "top tier".
---
Hey! Great information here! I knew about the twin pines jelly spawn (the one by the skeleton wearing a dress and bicycle) but when I checked it out it spawned the junk version, so I just figured it ALWAYS did and I never even brought it up. Seems like you are encountering the same thing. I did NOT know the Twin Pines cabin version could spawn the junk item. That makes the stuff even rarer! And I have never seen a honey beast drop the food kind, but maybe it is possible, although so rare as to be practically useless to try and farm. :) Thanks for sharing!
---
Update: it was updated today!
---
Hey all it takes is one person to make a Discord and get people together!  
---
And thankyou! I'm glad you enjoyed it!
---
I've suggested this myself. Many others have also. I think it's a great solution.
---
This is what they said to address Heavy Energy weapons: "Your heavy energy weapons should now last four to five times longer". Hope that helps!
---
I think this is exactly how it works! I claimed a workshop, got some stuff from it but as Inplayed on I didn’t care if it was taken or not. A few hours later I still had it anyway and I was roaming around and encountered a camp that fired on me as I strolled by. The player popped out and sure enough he was tagged for PvP! 
---
This player was NOT wanted so it caused me to wonder if they perhaps triggered my workshop but left before they took it over. 
---
This guy video games
---
I absolutely melt everything in the game with my Blooded 1 star .50 cal. It's not as absurd as TSE was pre nerf, but it's damn good. You can get a 1 star bloodied .50 cal for next to nothing, and it's only going to be better with the patch.
---
I think your ideas are trash. u/Imgur_Lurker thinks your ideas are trash. u/Robinson1002 thinks your ideas are trash. Either all three of us are incredibly stupid or your tactics are very easily countered.
---
I'm not trying to get into a pissing contest here, I really think you just haven't encountered a team that's seriously into PvP and could figure out counter you. 
---
The PvP system is broken and does need work . I am also a player that plays in pacifist mode. I have no interest in losing my caps in unfairly manner.
---
I have been killed while trading with a vendor before ( before bobble stacking patch came out ) a lower level player stood behind me while trading with the vendor and killed me 3 swings . I couldn't even exit the vendor window before they wasted me .  This should never happen .
---
I have also had my base attacked twice now and both times I couldn't even defend myself because it was a 3 on 1 and no matter if I killed the guy destroying my base or not his teammates would just waste me right after . Another flawed design in the PvP . Should be player on player opened PvP not protect yourself against a player and have to deal with his whole squad...
---
There is definitely work to be done. As a player who just wants to play the game it can be frustrating when these things happen .
---
Hang in there man , I feel you're pain.
---
Watoga. The bots drop 80% of the time. 
---
Haha originally we were gonna fix it but decided it was kinda funny! He's just asserting his dominance!
---
At least they get tagged. Would be super lame if they could just stroll up to you all casually, give you a wave, then one shot you. 
---
I won't be able to help much, if at all, but I'd edit in your PC specs (processor, graphics card, etc) as sometimes there are hardware specific solutions to these things.
---
In other words, if you're trying to run this on a Timex Sinclair, you'll get one set of suggestions, but if you're on a new high-end rig, they will be different suggestions.
---
I want to see Grahm and Moo Moo join the parade. 
---
well if you are looking forward to increased budget and they make it sound like its going to increase but actually won't be increasing it *is* disappointing and yet I still stated I'll wait and see how that impacts things in game. 
---
I noted also that other games do allow budget less building so I know it's possible. that is voicing disappointment and making the observation that it doesn't have to be that way. I could quit quietly but I'd rather have improvements made. I'm sure my criticism could have had more suggestions but I just don't have them currently. hence my wait and see statement.
---
I want this game to succeed, so badly, because it really is one of my favorite games and I love it but it's fair to want improvements on the thing I do mostly in game. just like it's fair for people to point out legendary loot rng sucks and the queen fights are buggy etc etc... those thingd don't matter to my game play but they matter overall and I hear their valid concerns also. we all want a better game, right? 
---
I had a 2 story “garage” on spectacle island with all of my power armors at stations. It was connected to my huge house I made that was 3 stories with a little museum of every cool weapon in the game. Makes me wanna play fallout 4 again. 
---
I got my gourds from a tiny greenhouse behind one of the mansions beside the Summersville dry lake bed. Either the Hornwrite Summer Villa or Torrence House I think. Good luck! Just picking up the gourd should let you plant it.
---
You know what, no.  I want no part of your grinding legendaries, min maxing bullshit.  I've never needed that shit in Fallout, the closest I've ever come to that in fallout is the fast firing/better crits build that was just ugly op in the old fallouts.  
---
I don't wanna play that game or be around people who wanna play like that.  I'm not interested in investing shitloads of hours into online games to get an edge over other players, on any level, and I like that Fallout 76 doesn't force that on me.  GTFO to your survival servers and don't come back.
---
Aaaaahhhhhh IVE BEEN WAITING FOR COOL VIDEOS LIKE THIS!!! This is so awesome, dude!! I seriously love this so so so much! You guys did an amazing job and I can't WAIT to see what you make next!!!! 
---
i believe the master rifleman perk card is avail after 40? do u have the glow sight ones maxed? rifle-build here..my alt is level 38
---
Now we’re talkin’! This would be amazing. 
---
I've spent about 99% of my playtime so far building my CAMP so I'm with you on that haha. 
---
Aside from tagging along with a high-level friend of mine to grind for plans/power-level a little bit, I've pretty much only explored within a 5 minute walk from my CAMP.
---
I will say, the people who have been posting saying things about how it's just a bit of a different way to experience the world than we're used to, so it's easy to feel like it's empty are totally right. 
---
If you let yourself get into the mindset of someone who's literally just exploring and trying to figure out what the hell happened, the environmental storytelling and clues really start to come together into something cool.
---
I *seriously* hope NPCs are added eventually, but there's definitely still great lore without them, and imo (I started playing with FO3), it *does* feel like Fallout. Vastly more-so than ESO feels like Elder Scrolls.
---
Also I'm really, really, bummed out about the lack of roleplaying/property/etc. in RDO, so this is scratching my itch pretty good.
---
Gahhhh I'm so excited and worked up over this it's so epic!!!
---
Ah and this is why I will never buy another Bethesda product
---
Replies like this!
---
This is my Adolf Hitler build, he is a cannibal.
---
if you could send me the audio file I will make it sound better.
---
For me, the higher the enemy level the higher the drop level. It's frustrating because I have killed soo many 3\* and gotten some 1\* mutant slayers rolling pin. Hit or miss either way I think. 
---
I'd love wearing the black cowboy hat with this.  Badass.
---
Holy shit! I never thought you guys would see this! Thankyou!
---
To power on lamps and lights in the area you need to connect a power radiator to the conduit that’s connected to a generator.  It’s a circle that will glow when powered on.  
---
use all the heavy weapons perks you can, including one gun army. only mod that is worth it IMO is the Napalm canister 
---
Raiders represent! 
---
Were the recipes on the white shelf cabinet thing?  I dont recall recipes spawning in that same spot, but I could be mistaken. 
---
I'm with you there.  My luck with weapons (at levl 75+) has been abysmal, to the point that I'm checking Whitesprings/Watoga for hand-me-downs as much as I'm "farming".
---
I can generally take a 3-star without a lot of trouble, but even in power armor I get demolished in a nuke zone, so my farming isn't particularly efficient.
---
Ash Heap - Breach and Clear event ... You will run out of acid from all the smelting. It's just a few mole miners and the odd explosive rat which you will hear coming.
---
You will need a Hornwright executive key card to unlock some boxes. Also, it really helps to have marsupial.
---
Recipes in 2 different locations there. First one was where you described. I walked around and the second was very nearby
---
haha. pretty much!
---
I don't pvp because it's just one shots even with decent DR.
---
I like it
---
I would quit if they degraded PA durability. I mean, it makes sense for PA to last longer than a gun, it's essentially a walking tank. If I have to repair my PA like I do my weaponry I'm done. 
---
I know about them, but dont you think it is kind of unnecessary in a multiplayer? Why should I improve myself if VATS can handle everything for me? CoD Aim works this way due to the low TTK, which wouldnt even be this way in Fallout with guns usually since their TTKs are relatively high. 
---
I see it, I shared it with the group, and I freaking LOVE this! Pleeeeeease let me know when you make more I LIVE for player-made videos like this! Ever since I saw photomode on my first day here I was like "Our community is going to make some badass videos with this!" And have been waiting for them!
---
Ohhhhhhhhh! Emmmm Barrasssiiinngggg!!!!!! Call me a dumbass who doesn't understand what I'm talking about, will you? Well lookiee here, dickhead:  
---
Upcoming Patch 7 notes, quoted fucking verbatim:  
---
**"The amount of budget space that some buildable objects consume, such as Turrets and Lights, has been reduced, but they now also have a maximum amount that can be placed in your C.A.M.P. or Workshop. The build menu recipes for these objects will show you how many are already present in your C.A.M.P., including the ones you have stored, and the total amount of each you can place."**
---
Eat crow,
---
With love and smooches,
---
McChuggernaut
---
Is "VATS targeting on Liberators" a thing anyone is looking at? It's basically useless on them and they roam in large, fiesty, fast-shooting packs. Run Mama Dolce event as a firearm build and you'll see it at its worst.
---
Oh well, 76 is kind of similar to survival on 4. 
---
You still might like 76 based on the fact that you really liked 4.
---
I’d suggest having a friend help walk you through the basics of 76 if you do get it. Which platform are you thinking? 
---
i'm honestly shocked you're still playing this shit game
---
I didn’t know they fixed the Tesla issue, thanks for that info. Now I have even more choices. I really hate you can’t swap them out or get plans. 
---
I’m also on Xbox and appreciate your offer to trade sometime. If I ever get anything to trade, I’ll consider it. I have 3 awesome melee weapons that I hold onto for dear life, a dragon and only one other good gun. It’s sad really. I’m level 74 and been playing since Beta. 
---
I really only wanted the stealth because my son gets griefed at his camp fairly often. It’s in a high traffic area and he refuses to move it. I just want to be able to kill some of these assholes who show up without them seeing me.
---
True. Munitions is usually the first place I take if it's unclaimed when I log in. I thoroughly enjoy workshop defense, so it's a normal part of my gameplay.
---
I've gotten experience with tactical teams, and have had teams a few times try to exploit contesting since the update. I spend a lot of time crouched, and am always conscious of people nearing a workshop I have.
---
I wasn't trying to make workshops sound scary, just trying to explain the way it works.
---
Now I'm even sadder that I missed filming for this one lol
---
I'm out then. They said they would reconsider after we had like 5 different posts reach front page with thousands of upvotes each begging them not to do this, and it sounded like they were going to separate.
---
This means that literally the only reason to go to the pvp server is to grief other people, since there's absolutely no reason you would go there to actually play the game. May as well just add a Battle Royale mode. it's going to be nothing but players who duped and got away with it with full min/maxed gear and top tier builds shitting on everyone else. It's already a fail. The only hope for this was if it was a fresh start.
---
I'll be sure to let you know as soon as we start work on our next video! 
---
Shit man I just sold a level 40 anti armor napalmer and junked a beserker’s flamer. If I come across any more I’ll keep you in mind.
---
As for getting the plasma flamer, check vendor bots Chad and Greg. They sometimes sell mods for the flamer barrel. Also you can learn a few by scrapping plasma guns but they’re kind of rare so you may have more luck shopping for mods. 
---
I just got a furious one that I put the barrel on and am eager to try it out. If it ends up not being for me I’d consider selling it
---
&gt; I really think you just haven't encountered a team that's seriously into PvP and could figure out counter you.
---
I'm a high Charisma build and I can one shot some people in PA with my midtier 2star assassin+Sighted dmg revolver, have plenty of better weapons nevermind the 15Luck boys 
---
.I'd love to see someone useless trying to spam stims instead of actually fighting.  I bet his team has literally no burst damage or Melee boys. 
---
I've got a 3star gamma gun but maybe he'd be better off with it since healing is such a big hindrance for him. 
---
Eeeeeek! I love this!!! I'm definitely going to tune in! Will you stream it on Twitch or Mixer? And what channel?
---
Really glad you gave it a chance... Personally, Fallout 76 has that very real solo experience to it that people miss. The Vault sets you out and says, good luck, survive. When you start with a group of people, it drastically changes that survivalist experience.  Which is interesting to me as well, because late game this game is all about the friends you play with and enjoying the game with. The players MAKE the game. I feel like they did a great job on making Fallout 76 feel exactly like a realistic, apocalyptic experience. 
---
I've been playing Fallout since Fallout 1, and I can say while yes, the game isn't perfect, it's been an experience I've loved for every moment of it. 
---
They seem to be (slowly) fixing the bugs.  
---
Also, they're making special "PVP Servers" soon, right?  Is it called "Survivor"?
---
What are mats?
---
Not a mine but grafton steel has a multi-floor conveyor belt with a decent amount of iron ore.  Can grab all the weapons from all the super mutans and break down for more steel.  Take the workshop for 2 iron extractors.
---
actually an excellent idea. Or a giddyup buttercup factory.
---
I'm lvl 185 and I always try to swing by that camp to drop useful plans off for new players.   Unfortunately because of the actions of some the reaction low levels get from me is akin to a Turkey seeing Thanksgiving on the calendar.  
---
I thought you might ;-)
---
I did in another post, we have 1 medic spamming heal in power armor to support those without power armor with 15-20 healspam, so they are healing all damage, other 2 people using heavy to stagger and one rifles/shotguns for additional damage. I will not go into further detail, as I have no desire for people to copy this strategy and setup widely.
---
If I need a resource from a workshop, I'm doing everything crouching 3\* sneak, claiming, harvesting, travel to camp to offload, then back to workshop to defend event and harvest again until I have what I want I then disconnect and relog. Constantly looking at the map, I've become paranoid.
---
Yeah when I had chat ban it did the same thing. 
---
thanks, didn't see it. Will check now :)
---
I forgot the high school. But not during the monster mash. 
---
Not really. Wouldn't mind a trucker hat. I just like knowing where stuff is so when the mood strikes me to fire up one of my alt characters, I know where to do.
---
In my case, you see a level 279 running up on you randomly named knight\_wanderer, he's probably going to give you free legendaries and plans.
---
I'm on XB1 and in character creation now 😀 yeah, I get the aspect of survival games. It's what has me interested. I'm just looking to scavenge and explore. See what happens...
---
Alright now I can use energy weapons, this is the kind of update I needed.
---
No worries--I didn't think you were accusing me. You bring some good points forward. For me, I'm partial to the old kill 'em yourself grind. I will say it is a smart place to place a base if you want to farm XP.
---
 He shows up on my trip from the Mire to The Whitespring I do quite often. I hear him usually and sneak up on him. ;)
---
The range is limited and you need to take the drug in the first place, which some very ignorant people here seem to ignore. They specifically ignore the way open PVP ambushes may play out, in which drugs do not have as much utility, as you may be dead by 1 shot before you get to use them.
---
lol ...you are either very mistaken or not very observant.
---
Fallout 4 on xbox one X , even when using an external SSD , on a perfect system and setup, still has fps stuttering, it looks great, but its not 'fine'.
---
Saying a Bethesda game has "no issues at all" is laughable, because their games are notorious for bugs, glitches and anomalies. ...even 12 year old games like Oblivion, do NOT perform well on Xbox One X - Bethesda are lazy, they don't fix bugs ...I'm so surprised that gamers still buy their games, or support them.
---
They are the most disreputable game publisher in the entire world.
---
Well I’m on xbox too. I have two characters; one at level 135 and one at level 77. If you want some help lemme know your gamertag 👍
---
I don't play too often, but I have a 'Heavy' character and a 'Ranger' character. The first just focuses on Heavy Weapons and Power Armor usage, while the other is a Sniper and 1Handed-Melee hybrid without PA.
---
Thank you! Those BoS plans not appearing at vendors would be nice to have the "patch 7" edit too :)
---
Do you spam people with invites like you spam post the same subject? 
---
Pretty sure (90%) I have flamer plans on PS4, I'll have to check later tonight. Wouldn't mind making you one if I have them.
---
We're on PC, we'll dream for cross-play
---
Wow, still hasn't been fixed...
---
There is ALWAYS a seat at our "Palace of Mediocre Arts" for the home office. (Seen here:  https://twitter.com/HoaWasteland/status/1103469263795314688 ). In fact, Box 1 is yours. Max occupancy 2. Please message us here or at @HOAWasteland, and we'll make sure you get all info.
---
The Wasteland Estates Homeowners Association is looking forward to having you. Comped, of course. 
---
Have you logged in and out?
---
I've hardly ever ran into players that are toxic, but yeah just block servor hop it takes like 30 seconds
---
It's not a feeling when, with 29 AGI (unyielding, mutations, armor etc) and all the sneak stuff (perks, more difficult to detect while sneaking), you're always in caution or just changing from hidden to danger in 1 second. Also it's a problem for me because i'm using instigating and bloodied weapons with very low health. I remember before patch 5 everything was fine, it started since then
---
I just hope that it also aplies to tesla rifles, since I never hear them noted
---
that's what I'm saying
---
Great, thank you. Let me know.
---
Ive found i enjoy it most when i set it in a paper bag in the ground.
---
I think it's rumored to be for future content, specifically some sort of king-of-the-hill type event where the winner of an "election" gets access to that room. I'll find a link with more details. 
---
If I could put a photo in the comments I would show you
---
Y'all are makin' my eyes red
---
Fair enough, but I would go a bit farther and say when you go to turn PvP on, it makes an announcement and gives you a 30-60 second warning before that person is able to start attacking others. I've got zero patience for passive/pacifist mode metagaming, it's not for anyone except jerks.
---
Should also be a pretty good run for xp and junk as well then. I'll give it a go!
---
Im gonna go build a CAMP on your cliff.
---
Oh, it will be streamed. I read that eagerly as though you were looking for a spot in the stands. I'll make sure you get the Twitch info. :)
---
&gt; no one gives a fuck about this game anymore.
---
That's wrong, man.
---
"no one gives a fuck about this PvP anymore."
---
That is.
---
Yeah I think I’m done claiming workshops. Farming routes seem to be more profitable. Currently I’m going white springs, west tek, isolated array, sugar grove. Seems to provide what I need right now (legendaries, caps, screws, springs, respectively). Then jump around to the vendors and sell loot/buy plans. 
---
What resource do you usually get from workshops?
---
&gt; If I am in pacifist mode and I decide I want to claim a Work Shop. I  should be able too and when I click to claim it, it gives me a warning  that I can now be attacked and have entered PVP mode. 
---
yes, that is a great idea, I never suggested you have to manually turn off pacifist to claim a workshop, the way you suggest is exactly how I imagine it should work, all I was saying is when you claim a workshop you are no longer in pacifist...
---
Looks nice!
---
I'm honestly shocked you waste the time to post your inane bullshit about games you dont like. Get a fucking life. 
---
What assumptions. You say he wants to play so why not just play. It's not difficult to level up and you just work towards your final spec. No build is totally useless so there is no reason to not incrementally adjust your spec by just playing
---
Why smelt? Scrap all the rifles you find from dead scorched and supermutants. I typically gather 5-600 steel scrap in an hour-long run - frequently have to dump it for space.
---
Yeah I am indeed. Overwatch with gf, and new Metro for myself (amaze-balls game can't yes it enough, absolutely recommend) but there's nothing to scratch that multiplayer survivor/quest itch atm. We thought about anthem but noped after the reviews. Division 2 maybe but don't want a copy-paste of the first one as she didn't love it. I even installed fallout 1 to have a re-run.
---
Won't be on till around 7:00 CST tonite, but I would be glad to just give you 2 Cobalt pures if you can wait that long.
---
best fucking item!! Nothing more to say
---
If you havent at least encountered spam healing in the past you might as well start now. They exist. One would think that a TSE Minugun could do some damage since its a fucking heavy weapon but you'd be wasting ressources against a heal spammer. And dont you think that a Oneshot would be a bit more problematic in survival? One shot and you are will find yourself in the next camp or Vault 76. This would be somewhat alright in the Fallout 76 we know today, but keep in mind that you cant just jump back in the action like before. Just think about it: One moment you are at the vendor and within the next you will look at a lovely loading screen till you can even think about revenge. Even Rust might be a bit more balanced than this.
---
 At best it should be a Two tap under certain conditions.

 So if you were there I could have got all three?

---
You can get around 5-10 steel by scrapping weapons, id just go kill a bunch of scorched in morgantown or low level super mutants in grafton, or grafton steel mill.
---
Ive been chronically low on steel since ~ lv 100, (170 now) after i lost around 1000 from dying. I Couldnt figure out how I got so much so easily early on, and why I couldnt maintain a stable supply now. Then I realized it was bc i stopped scrapping weapons (really because I stopped picking them up after learning most of the mods)
---
They didn't, when this post was fresh.
---
Glad it became popular and they had to show to say something...
---
You will know. 
---
You dare incur the wrath of Gumbo?!

I REALLY need it so my tin foil hat stays on regardless of other clothing.  Sick of aliens reading my thoughts when i change clothes.

It's a fucking video game. You should be able to enjoy it, not have to deal with insufferable twatwaffles.
---
I'm thegunguyinc on PS4, I'll keep you posted.
---
sounds pretty r/fo76FilthyCasuals to me!
---
Let me be more clear. I talking about a system of dividing the servers into two modes. One with PVP and one without. You could chose which server to enter at the main menu. This would prevent griefing all together. Some players just want to play the game with friendly people, others do not. I’m not saying people who want that PVP experience are wrong but that isn’t the experience that I am looking for when I play this game. I would rather help others than fight them. Again, this is just my opinion and the experience I’m looking for in this game.
---
God tier patch for me.
---
I figured we were on the same page .. I just was not understanding you fully !! Plus I am doing 10 things right now so not as focused as I could be hahaha 
---
i'll do whatever the fuck i want bitch 
---
I've never had any luck placing blueprints of large scale houses. Even when I'm successfully able to place it, I always get disconnected within minutes and it's gone when I reconnect. It seems like the game really does not like highly complex blueprints.
---
The game logs you out after a few minutes of inactivity 
---
PlayStation?
---
I can't imagine how someone can roleplay in this game. There is no foundation for it at all.
---
that doesn't help me in any way...
---
There should be a bleed effect too, right?  Possible to observe that?
---
Maybe if little dipshits like you didnt downvote posts before they were answered i wouldnt have to repost just to get a question answered . seriously take a big step back and FUCK YOU OWN FACE.
---
&gt; and semi-auto energy weapons should last twice as long before needing repairs.
---
So...the laser rifle will now take four magazines instead of two to break?
---
Whatever you say chief, I'm sure pure PvE will come any day now...^any day now^ any day now
---
Health and diseases are mostly irrelevant. Particularly if you're able to get to your camp without dying.
---
This. Light budget cost reduction is huge for those of us who like to really build our camps up.
---
I don't have turrets, but I have a shitload of lights.
---
Yep....the vast majority of people heading there are doing it for one reason and it ain’t killing 10 ghouls dressed as golfers.   I don’t mind the turret camps tbh.
---
It doesn't show up in my mitations list at all, so I never remember what it does, I haven't really noticed a bleed effect but with my Furious Deathclaw Gauntlet I kill most enemies I use it on in 1-3 hits anyways.
---
You can have up to five characters on an account. If you're only 50 hours in, that's only a couple of dedicated weekends from getting back to where you were with the new specs you want. Heck, an hour a day since the nerf would have you with a pretty darned playable character today. Sometimes the solution you want isn't available and you have to work with the solutions you have at hand.
---
How did you get 2? Nukes overlapping such that the first SBQ didn't get hit?

Idk man, that thing could shred through some of the weaker mobs, but nothing can withstand [THIS one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

You've never lost progress because you forgot to save?  How you have to remotivate yourself to jump back in?  Amongst the bugs and general lack of content maybe having his efforts undermined was just a bridge too far.  Im not saying you have to agree with him but thats how he feels.  And the assumption is he's whining when he doesnt even mention FO76 unless its repying to my patch notes post in our discord channel.  It's not unreasonable or uncommom to get a respec when major aspects of a build have been changed.  Id imagine hes not alone.  
---
Im not demanding anything or telling other people to stop playing or the game sucks.  If you dont agree just move on dont start assuming shit and accuse people of lying.  Especially when you'd never act that way to a persons face.
---
Take it from someone with exactly the same reaction as you:

It wears off rather quickly when you realize there's nothing exciting out there.

You'll realize this after going up to empty location number 50.

bad bot
---
who cares gaylord no one asks you what you do . 
---
I agree it is a logical counterpart to the Rad Shower; it would be a nice little self-care addition to camps.
---
Rad Shower removes radiation and cures mutations, Auto Doc heals lost HP and cures diseases.
---
I'm pretty sure there are already animation assets in the game from when you use the one Auto Doc for applying the Scorched Vaccine - but I could be completely imagining it. Its been so long since I did that quest.
---
no one asked for your opinion idiot ass. 
---
I mean, specifically regarding pacifist mode, I don't see the issue with giving people who use it full protection from PvP. 
---
They just shouldn't be allowed to capture workshops.
---
Shut up queerbait. 
---
Wrong. 
---
Just uninstall the game it is terrible.
---
Wow now I want to make one of thess
---
Yay you spent how many hours to consensually pvp with someone?

Me too. I work afternoon. Next time do it on a weekend maybe

True but its like losing progress by not saving.  Yeah time can fix it but damage is done to motovation.  He doesnt want to do that and I dont blame him.  Id like to play again with my group its unlikely to happen unless this occurs so I figured it wouldn't hurt to politely repost this for my dudes.  If not so be it.  We'll keep playing Ark and likely the next game that catches our eye.  FO is my favorite series but I like my friends even more so here we are.  Dont know why this is so baffling and offensive to the people replying but to each their own I guess.
---
Also were in our 30s with kids.  That makes it even morw difficult to commit to rebuilding charactera fwiw.
---
This is so awesome!! I can't wait :)

Admantum skeleton, maxed means you take ZERO limb damag
---
I have only partaken in PvP when I have been attacked or my base.  I am a level 155 and I just enjoy the Fallout game. Not the PvP potion. 
---
I feel that Bethesda should have two types of servers for the two types of players. 
---
Server type 1 should be for the people that want to play the game. Story line, crafting, etc. 
---
These players can enjoy the game without having to constantly rebuild their camp or watch over their shoulder. 
---
- if someone is on this type of server and provoke another player into PvP the person doing the provoking should be kicked from the server automatically. 
---
Server type 2 should be for those PvP players that just want to go around killing other players. 
---
With this type of server anything goes. 
---
With these two types of servers everyone can enjoy the game the way they want to enjoy it. 
---
There has been a few times where I had to jump servers because I was doing the story line and a group of PvP players destroyed my base. 
---
When this kind is stuff happens it really makes me not want to play the game. 
---
Read the "Roadmap" and come back when the major content patches comes around.
---
What I do is go Grafton steel kill the mutants and scrap all their weapons. Normally come out with 100-200 steel with scrapper(doesn't do much though). Also the mutant respawn pretty frequently and I just use the power armor station on the second story for scrapping.
---
All I can say is if someone can “spam heal” and out do your damage, which has NEVER happened to me, then you must have some pretty pathetic damage.
---
Keep in mind I have 1k hours in this game, I know wtf I’m talking about.
---
Awww, someone got butthurt and is spam replying to all my posts. 
---
I have the same problem with stealth since patch 5, I think people downvoting or insulting you are crying kiddos tired of being raped by stealth builds :P
---
Had a dude break into my base with his buddy the other day while I was editing it. Entrance is second floor so I removed the first floor so they couldn’t escape. My buddy and I were wrecking them so they hard quit the game like 1% from dying.
---
The people who grief are just douchebags that find ways around in game mechanics to avoid repercussions. 
---
Too bad it doesn't look like they are doing enough to bring them up to par though.  Only time will tell.
---
This is the update I’ve been waiting for. I have no turrets due to the amount of space they take up, and it’s getting quite annoying constantly having to go deal with a couple of pesky radrats whenever they attack my melons, so this is great news! 
---
Agreed. This would make it 100x better! They did it for elder scrolls so why not find away to put it in this game even if it cost 3000 caps per reset or give 1 freebie
---
All that will be in my camp is a cardboard cutout Vault Boy giving you a thumbs up.
---
What he is saying is you SOL, you need to rebuild. I have yet to have this happen to me and I have 9 permanent camps, but it can happen. So when it does, it sucks, but you going to have to break down the blueprint and rebuild. The camp system is far from perfect and can glitch out ..
---
Not to mention, that half the griefers use passive mode to sneak up on unsuspecting players and deactivate it before killing.
---
Or activate it when you're about to kill them so that they can save their precious k/d.
---
It really is a joke.
---
That is a great idea a mail system would be a good thing.
---
Ive found one, maybe two dense mod plans for sale ever before patch 5 (not that I was always looking). Now there arent hardly any mod plans for sale.
---
Dense is chest only.
---
I know I bought dense trapper at camden park (before patch 5). I know dense metal, but I dont remember how I got it.
---
I'm doing a bum build, no nice clothes. And can only live under a bridge even if I build the world's fanciest bridge haha
---
On Tuesday next week we are getting our first huge update ( free DLC) it's a lot better than launch. Very few to no crashes anymore weight isn't a problem for me with the 800 lbs now.
---
We haven't heard anything. If I were a betting man I would say that based on the content of the last 2 ITVs that we will found out more in next week's
---
I hear you. Approaching 50, I've got a lot more liberty to ignore my kids (especially since the oldest turned 17 and can play chauffeur for her sister instead of me having driving duties). And I totally get how demoralizing losing progress due to not saving can be, and that's a pretty good analogy here. I nearly stopped playing FO3 after finding out that finishing the mainline quest meant you couldn't do any DLC on the same character. Even though it autosaved before the battle, it seemed like such a nuisance to have to do that again.
---
That is so much like my playstyle. Rifles, no autos to conserve ammo, always recon and soften them up from a far but have a melee on the swap for when they close distance or get over ran. 
---
Unfortunately it's nearly impossible to place large blueprints back down.  
---
One thing you can TRY (don't get your hopes up) -- hold down X (ps4.. whatever your 'place' button is) and use L1 &amp; L2 and it will raise and lower your item/blueprint vertically.  There's a chance you may be able to get it to go green.
---
Also while still holding down X, you can use your stick to move it around as well, without moving your body -- this sometimes helps get things to go where they need to as well.
---
Good luck though.. I hate losing a nice house.
---
I.E. on Tuesday
---
Hence the cop outfit?
---
Hold on. There's a 4 barrel mod for the broadsider?
---
BAD BOT you took all the fun out of it
---
I forgot about that...well have a good one man and thanks for the feedback.  I appreciate the helpful suggestion!
---
If you receive Mail in the system you should be unable to access it until completing a Mr. Messenger event.
---
Muhahaha!
---
Restarting the Survival with fresh Chars does not solve the problem, it only delays some, but once people are maxed out and equipped properly, the same problems will return. The game will once again revolve around 1 shots, invis or outhealing others. While healing and Chameleon will likely be a prominent issue from the get go. So really, some changes need to happen, which is the point of this post.
---
Its chest only. That is certain.  For plans/mods I think it depends.  I found multiple Marine chest mods in my travels but never heard of a plan for it.  I scrapped 100s of Marine pieces and never got it.  I did find a robot dense plan though.  Btw if your on PS4 I’ll give you one of the Marine dense mods.  PSN is the same as here. 
---
I really, really hope they reconsider. Personally, I don't want a server that's "just for pvp". I want a server that has the RISK of pvp, as well as the potential REWARD of it, that requires me to play the game normally and also deal with the risk of running into other hostile players.
---
That would actually be fucking hilarious.
---
&gt; So a low level 25 character, for example, can take a shop and then a level 125 character can come in all perked up with thier explosive weapons and just cream the level 25 over and over and over (tea bagging and all).
---
No.  The person you describe has a choice:  He either chooses to give up the workshop (no combat) or he battles it out and either wins or loses.  There is none of this "over and over and over again" that you are talking about.  If he wins, he is still in charge of the workshop and anyone can challenge him, yes.  If he loses, he loses the workshop and that's the end of it.

I generally do the daily and weekly challenges as well as gun runs for caps. Lately I've been puttering around my camp (also playing a lot of AC odyssey) but wouldn't mind a silo run, maybe this weekend.

I'll hop on tonight
---
My IGN is ascott38, I too need a group for fasnacht.
---
 The Dense mod for Combat Armor does not seem to be available since 6 dropped. The BoS mods for Combat Armor also seem to be AWOL.
---
The Armors except Marine come in Light Sturdy and Heavy. 
---
 I have the best myself but was lucky to score what I needed before 6 dropped. So my BoS Heavy Combat Armor with Dense on the chest and Strengthened on the limbs takes no Explosive Damage and runs about 325b 325e 3r depending on my level of Over Repair.
---
As you level up, any highly-trafficked spot can be farmed for legendaries because if someone else has cleared the area previously on that server the respawns will be levelled for you personally. I've had level 68 legendary scorched jump me at Morgantown Airport.
---
Just block the guy
---
Oh yeah? I never noticed they weren't on the legendary list!
---
I'll have to look out for one, the two shot was great before.
---
Maybe Garrahan Mining HQ, there are some T45 pieces there, not sure tho, it's been a while. Also any power station can spawn the armor pieces provided you're the first one in the area so the mob/loot pieces adjust accordingly to you, just server hop repeatedly.
---
Pretty sure, based on past experiences, that they are going from Zip drives back to 5.24" Floppies... you know, back when Floppies were actually consider Floppy.
---
I dont know if just a 10% buff for energy weapons is going to be enough, but its a start. We'll have to see how it works in game.
---
If you don’t understand how I could pair those two when they were written one after another then you lack basic english writing skills and comprehension. 
---
You linked wiki as a source, like a complete idiot, now man up and own up to your stupid mistake and stop acting like a child throwing out insults and crying because someone called out your bullshit.
---
Also it’s extremely surprising you haven’t encountered many idiots on reddit, likely because it’s hard for you to identify said idiots because you are one. It’s ok buddy, I sympathize with your lack of intelligence, maybe you should lay off the internet, it’s likely too complicated for you.
---
I think the whole follow the overseers quest needs to be fixed. I have all holotapes and still the quest isn’t complete. 
---
I think that is the intent of survival. You will be able to do all the same quests and events without any pvp restrictions such as pacifist and slap damage.
---
Like I said, wait until next week.
---
we're showing our age now. half the kids in here are probably reading this confused.

What's coming on tuesday?
---
I played fallout 4 on my original XBOX but am playing 76 on XB1...and the graphics are noticeably better....more vibrant.  That said...it is still the Bethesda engine, so you could argue the graphics are still not where they should be.
---
For me being able to make the subtitles and notes bigger and bolder in settings would be a great help, ive only got a small screen and crappy eyesight! 
---
Agree, I look at the box as a storage garage at home and already question it being at every Train and Red Rocket. I do like the idea to scrap an repair a weapon though and cook 
---
No problem. I made a post about that spreadsheet the same day, I guess nobody saw it, lol. Wasnt a catchy title ill admit, and it was a friday late afternoon.
---
[Heres the post that has some more explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/awa2wy/spreadsheet_vendor_inventory_plans_in_patch_6/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Do you want Preston Garvey in fallout 76? Cuz that’s how we get Preston Garvey in fallout 76. 
---
But it would something. Maybe the Messenger sends you extra loot or scraps every now and again while you are online and only for that current session. 
---
Good suggestion! Adding it to the main post
---
I don't recall where it was marketed as a PVP game? .. I thought it was marketed as Fallout 4 with Multiplayer. Which is exactly what we wanted. There's PVP aspects, but that is not the entirety of the game. This is not RUST. 
---
It's simple, allow me to opt out/in of any damage for me and my base. Slap a timer on it so I can't just go in and out of PVP .  Claiming of workshops automatically puts me in PVP mode until I exit the area and then the Timer starts before I can toggle it off. 
---
And judging by the size of this post and ones like it it .. I am guessing this seems to be a important subject right now.
---
I've seen raider and t-45 spawn in the Rusty Pick or whatever that bar is called.
---
I love how that screenshot shows the lovely toddrays shining through the solid BASEMENT. 
---
But yes I imagine the auto doc in Harper's ferry was or is part of a cut quest.
---
I'm on ps4, but not 18. Few more years too go and ill join in.
---
Head back to a lower area and farm a new weapon or two. And make sure you are scraping your junk. 
---
Thank you, i feel like I'm missing out on lore because I just cant get through some of the notes with incredibly thin fonts
---
Eh, that punishes sneaky/sniper builds that come across a situation where they realize after the fact that they want to PvP. I'd be fine with a "participation timer" of 30 seconds, but even that almost seems a tad much.
---
Request sent.
---
Then don't make your suggested changes at all, or make a completely different mode for what you suggested. I don't think I should have to give up talking workshops because of a few griefers slapping people to death. Especially because they'll just find another way to grief like kiting enemies to your camp. What they need is a real way to punish the griefers, not something that puts the burden on regular players. 
---
I’ve seen lower level PA at the Nuka Cola factory on the west side. Up the road to the north is a little garage/workshop with a greenhouse.  Another PA is there. 
---
It's sad how quiet it gets when a nuke is launched these days,I've seen 3 all week and post 2 patches ago it would be that a day.
---
When I came on today there was a event to kill the Sq and got all excited and joined and we fail as most of the players where going after the other things.
---
That’s a real shame man! Hopefully the see this :)
---
So did I, pick all the cool cards vs the proper build cards, in most cases you can't go too wrong. I knew immediately melee was it even though I never played melee before.
---
Tell us what cards you have especially in your strength tree or send us a screenshot.
---
I focused mostly on my strength, charisma and luck trees. You still got 17 levels to correct some of it and by 50 you can respec if you need.
---
A lot of high-level areas are meant to be avoid even if you do follow the main quest line, take a timeout and level up some more, mess around with camps, kill some enemies in the middle and west of the map, then tackle the high level areas when you ready, it's not the end of the world so don't worry. Get a friend to assist and you can tag enemies to try level up. If you a solo player, follow above advice, for my first character I stuck to the centre of the map until I was ready and still had a blast ..
---
I was in need of copper to craft a whole load of Handmades to scrap and learn all the mods, I wanted a suppressor so I claimed Dabney Homestead with the 3 copper deposits, it was quite fun while harvesting then defending the extractors from three waves of RadToads. So mostly I agree there is plenty of junk about, but the Workshops can be a fun distraction from time to time.
---
It *should* punish them, or at least remove the unfair advantage of being invulnerable until you're ready to attack.
---
SIDE NOTE I feel like you and the Wolfpack RP community [that posted a video here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ayfruf/my_roleplay_community_made_a_trailer_to_keep_us/) would make an epic team if you guys combined your powers! 
---
Good news was one wasn’t tied to the nuke timer so we killed the one that didn’t leave 😺
---
I usually assume people are on PC if they don't specify. Good luck with the hunt. Hopefully you can find something good.
---
Yeah I just can't see anyone other than people looking exclusively for pvp to join that though. I miss the days of playing WoW on a pvp server, where yes, PvP happened and it could be brutal, but everyone also had to level up and work for their progress. It was for that reason that PvE to PvP server transfers weren't allowed.
---
Need to know more about it too, like if we can see other players on the map, how / if bounties will work, etc.
---
I have to say that it would be better through the Pip-Boy.  Another tab, labelled COMMS, that lets you select channels.  Global, local, LFT, WTS, WTB, etc.  Turn them on like radio stations, but allow multiples to be selected.  The bottom half then shows the messages (with the channel name and player name prepended.)  A small amount of scrollback.  Given it would be strictly server related, there's never going to be more than about 24 people at most to type messages.  So it's not going to get real busy.
---
This would allow communications with people without too much messing about with voice, and doesn't require knowing where they are or travelling to them, etc.
---
Just picked up a 3\* AA Rolling pin you don't want?  Offer it up on the WTS channel.  Really want a 2\* Furious Meat Hook?  Put a quick message on the WTB channel.  Having problems completing some mission because of spawns from a level 180 running past the area?  Post on the LFT channel.
---
Have a notification on the main screen that 'turns on' when new messages have been received on the channels you are listening to.  Something simple and non-intrusive.
---
About to nuke FSP?  Put out a call on LFT for help in turning the SBQ into BBQ.
---
Roleplaying?  Send out something on global.  Want to do one of the events, but need help?  Global text about it.  Found something odd, need help testing a bug you think you found?  Ditto.
---
This would be a GODSEND to player interactivity.  Voice-only is only really useful in team-based small-map games.  For encouraging interaction between players who would otherwise never even interact?  Text chat is NEEDED.
---

---
Bad bot
---
Sounds interesting but I think they are bring new stuff in the game so they don't bother fixing the bugs.
---
Fair enough, but that can be accomplished with a timer alone with no announcement. The announcement is just a bit over the top and doesn't do anything except punish sneaky builds.
---
Okay I'm not a noob *per say* but I keep seeing tse and slap damage terms being tossed around, help a brother understand ! &lt;3
---
No they do not! 
---
Just equip awareness and look at any mob. ER does not change regardless of what perks or mods you have on. +10% damage isn't going to do much when you still need to hit 250 base damage just to match the ER on most max level mobs.
---
All over, top left hand corner of the map at the lumber mill, morgantown should all have t45 .. I assume you are at least level 25
---
I commented on this before. But I guess my idea was worse than the op idea. 
---
Every dlc release we get a non tradable item that resets special points but not cards. 
---
 But having heard we are getting prestige system there’s no way of knowing if that will come with a level reset. 
---
Considering the fact that PA isn't good late game, I really think it needs more of a buff to make it more viable in the late game. Adding a legendary piece to it would be awesome and I think offer the balance it needs. Nobody at the higher levels uses PA, and for good reason; most weapons can bypass all that armor. If we had some legendary gear to fix that, that would be awesome.
---
^THIS, so much!
---
That's what I had under my "Not Original" Mini C.A.M.P post, you select the one bench you want to take. I'd say you should pack this Bug Out bag before going. No option to say, I'm going to pull out a Tinker Station now, when I took the Armor Station.
---
Yeah was waiting for some one to notice that. 
---
And this is why I won't play it... I don't want to deal with other people... It is why I game in the first place 
---
Yeah, there's 100% animations for it, because you use a very similar device in the nuke silos to scan your biometric data, and it has an animation

Invest in one or two carry weight redux perks. Make sure you are scrapping all junk items into their base components. Certain ammo types, specifically explosive and energy are heavy and you may consider dropping some, if not all, or investing in the aforementioned perks.   A last resort would be to craft excavator power armor for that sweet +100 to carry weight. You really shouldn't be higher than about 650lbs in your stash, if you are managing successfully. Good luck to you!
---
Honestly I just wanna build on that giant bridge. Make a bridge community and whatnot :(
---
In a party? Use Adrenal Reaction? And Strange in Numbers? 
---
I’m guessing this isn’t the problem since you mentioned relogging,  but SiN and the new Adrenal are bugged to fuck if you are in a party.
---
Gladiator is for 1h weapons. You wand slugger cards for a super sledge 
---
ayyyyy
---
Vendors only have a 200 cap limit. If you sell them 200 caps worth of stuff they will be out of caps for 24 hours. They refresh every 24 hours. Certain vendors are linked. The responder vendors for instance. If you sell 200 caps worth of stuff to one ALL the responder vendors will be at 0 caps for 24 hours. 
---
None of these weapon damage buffs are going to be sufficient.  10% is goddamned peanuts. Especially after the 40% reduction in explosive damage. What the hell is the design philosophy behind these changes? You are just going to have to change it AGAIN when it becomes extremely clear 30 minutes after the patch dropped that Energy Weapons still suck and Heavy Weapons remain incredibly underwhelming.
---
What platform are you on?
---
20-35 is really difficult for some reason, it was for me at least, basically had all the same problems you just described. After 35, things started getting easier. I did a few whitesprings nuke zones and flew through levels.
---
All the vendors have titles. Responders, raider, whitesprings, etc... they  all share caps and not items. 
---
Check the titles before hand.
---
All of the bots on the western map are responder bots minus the Sutton bot. All of the middle map bots are raider minus the whitespring and whitespring train station. 
---
And the free states have the one. And the Watoga one and Graham share if I’m not mistaken. 
---
I personally rock a tophat, but yes I agree ! Mask does not equal hat lol
---
Distillery update. Read last week's Inside the vault
---
&gt;it's not the end of the world
---
That had me chuckling :)
---
All good advice, it is temping to move East to quickly and get out of one's depth.
---
I'm not so sure, only time will tell though I suppose.
---
There are 7 vendor factions and each one has a total of 200 caps each. You might be going to vendors on the same faction.

The excavator armour is a pretty good leveling power armour that increases carry weight while not weighing much. Id recommend using it until lvl 45/50. 
---
So you can be a jack of all trades but most ppl focus on a certain play style. Pretty much you pick two complementing specials and run with it. Currently strength offers a diverse playstyle choice (melee, shotguns, heavy weapons) while perception and agility focus only on mostly 1 (rifles and pistols respectively). I suggest maxing str as you level up until you know what you want to do. 
---
Now the real question is what type of gun do you like? Realistically you want to carry 2/3 weapons only outside of certain scenarios. I am a melee/heavy weapons user so i usually carry 1 gat and 2 fist wepons. Your wepons determine your play style.
---
Once you pick your wepons you pick your armour.  It's pretty much power armour vs non power armour. If you go non power armour carry a set of power armour anyway.
---
Now that you know your wepons and armour find out what their repair cost are. If you carry junk that is not needed to repair it, get rid of most of it. Always try and keep enough materials to repair each piece ten times. This comes out to like 100-200 pieces of junk for each thing. Any misc junk keep at like around 20.
---
The rest of your inventory should be dedicated to food and water, drugs and meds, and ammo and ammo crafting materials. 
---
If you follow the above steps you shouldn't have any issues with storage.
---
After that its just upgrading your wepons and getting the correct perks.
---
You have speed demon?
---
not powerless, server hop the moment it starts or suspicious group incoming to your camp. the workshops- pvp not griefing. don't claim them.
---
I just wish Bethesda allowed a full respec instead of having to do so, slowly level by level after level 50.
---
Wendigos and Molerats among others drop screws.
---
Robots do not drop srews.
---
Bethesda pls
---
Sure, I am a fallout foodie myself and appreciated your post as it addressed nearly all the issues I've seen with the ingredients right to the letter.  Hope you didn't think I was contradicting you on the jelly, but my very first RJ I ever got in the game came from a HB and it was food.  The second I found in the box at Middle Mountain and when I went to add it to my aid I couldn't find it.  I had hit scrap all without looking and scrapped it.  It wasn't till the next one I got as junk that I realized what happened to it.  Anyway, glad to contribute if it helped. 
---
Let me put it this way. My 1 star bloodied .50 cal is about 2x as effective at killing as my TSE .50 cal is, assuming I stay below 20% HP (tested using both). People are sleeping on it. I think the biggest thing is that with a bloodied weapon, it's all one single shot. TSE has multiple shots that all go through DR, and on high armor targets, that isn't too great. I'd say bloodied + 25% fire rate would be the best, since the 25% fire rate is just a straight up 25% damage boost. Explosive won't be.
---
Was thinking that myself.  An awful lot of shots miss at 95%.
---
Maybe announcement isn't the right word. I think there should be an icon next to the name of people who are PvP-active, and people who are in the enter-PvP timer should have a little countdown that shows.
---
Super sledge is a one handed weapon though.
---
This sounds exactly like me! I’m level 31 and whenever I head to the other side of the map I get annihilated because all the enemies are much higher level than me. I’m melee and my weapons (and my armor) seem to be breaking really easily now. On top of that I’m struggling to find the components I need to fix everything 
---
I am by no means an expert at this game and my builds are probably pants, but here are my go to melee builds I'm currently using. Hope it helps.
---
[Melee 1 handed](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f38478b&amp;d=si0sj0sf2sg2se2ss2pe2e52ej4c72i11i44a04au2l22lu2lt2l71s50&amp;w=&amp;n=Melee%201-handed)
---
[Melee 2 handed](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f38478b&amp;d=sf2sg2se2ss2pe2e52ej4c72i11i44a04au2l22lu2lt2l71s40sm0sn0&amp;w=&amp;n=Melee%202-handed)
---
Its 2 handed it just looks like it's one handed for power armor
---
Yes PSN? I’m on for a hour then off to work 
---
haha no worries
---
if you are on ps4, look me up, PSN: Silune  
---
can meet up in game i can help you get back on track, and get your shit repaired, and help you with advice on inventory management, take ya around to some specific farm spots for needed materials and go over perk cards and build suggestions for what ya envision doing.   
---
If not on ps4 tell us your platform ya play on and i am sure someone on your platform will be happy to meet up with ya to give ya a hand in the right direction.   
---
i just find it easier to talk in game with everything infront of ya so questions can be answered back and forth on both sides.   
---
but anyways give us your platform and name so we can find ya and help ya get back on your feet and moving in the right direction.
---
But doesn’t switching servers cancel out any workshops you’ve claimed? Seems kinda messed up to have to give that up because someone’s being a dick. 
---
You can obtain plans to make a fusion mag for it. 
---
This may be technically correct, if that is the way Bethesda wants to go for the future- it should be easier for someone in pacifist mode to switch over to PVP so they can defend themselves.
---
Right now it's "Oh, someone is trying to kill me.. I better go to the menu and switch so I can defend myse....   
---
 Nevermind." Totally lame.
---
If an Opt Out is not in the plans, then a toggle INTO PVP should be there. (And keep going into Pacifist in the menu)
---
no, you don't get it, you can still take a workshop, but when you do a notice pops up asking for consent to PvP, as it does already, and it automatically takes you out of passive
---
I guess I'm going back to waiting on the Harpoon Gun to get better.  
---
Played a week or 2 ago and it just completly sucked when I compared it to launch month memories.
---
why are you here then?
---
And now a straw-man argument.   You're just hitting the bad argument checklist and trying to get a bingo, aren't you?  
---
Keep thinking Bethesda is going to leave 76 to become a post-nuclear-apocalypse Fortnite.  
---
And nice that you notice the echo-chamber your standing in.  Not too many agree with you.....just a few griefer diehards.
---
I feel like this is one of those things that if it picks up enough steam theyll forsure add it, its very similar to what they have in nuke silos
---
Unequip, reequip weapon and perk cards should fix it. Sometimes just hotswaping the weapon will fix it.
---
^ What he said!
---
ok , but 90% of the time this is not raiding though, In that I look at raiding as going out and killing , pillaging for needed resources. Okay first Kill .. you now got my stuff, its over and its my fault for not dropping off my stuff sooner. But to constantly attack me .. and then come to my base and destroy it (which gains you nothing) What is the real point here out side of just enjoyment at ruining my gaming experience.  Not you as in You .. but I think you get it hahahah 
---
It seems like there is a delay for it to lock on.  If you shoot immediately after locking on a target it misses almost every time.
---
Validation my friend. Validation. You? 
---
I would take it:) I'll add in an hour. Psn im-_-butt-head
---
Timdiv362
---
Different people will play different ways. I have never been a griefer myself, so Im not sure why you brought such a terrible attitude to an overall positive conversation.  Fallout 76 isn’t a solo game, they told us that from the get go. There has also been a grinding component to previous Fallouts with legendaries, perks, and cap grinding as well.  Best of luck to you buddy- I always try to help out others but tbh - your approach doesnt seem to warrant it. 
---
as long as its not 2shot weapon i have never noticed a change  and been playing since beta in regards to vats accuracy. however, i do run a sniper build and have close to 30perception
---
Ideally, you could have access to it, but also be able to mute it whenever you wanted to. That's pretty standard.
---
Explain then why my damage increases on the gatling laser with Stabilized.
---
**That** would be awesome. It would solve so many problems on *both* sides of the issue. If you wanted to be a sneaky sniper you could hunt people with the PvP icon. If you wanted to avoid PvP entirely, you could. If you wanted to join in, others could see you changed it but if you were careful and sneaky you could get away with hiding and joining in. I like that idea a lot.
---
This is super true.  Granted I have asked some people and they’ve been pretty straight up with where they came from suprisingly!  
---
Two Shot Explosive - nerfed an really is a 1 an 1/4 now. Dealing 100% dmg, plus 25%. But if it really fires twice and should do 100+100. Now nerfing Explosive I could see.
---
Slap damage is supposed to be tiny little damage that doesn't hurt or kill you and if someone fired enough they should break a weapon first more than likely. Sadly, people have died from Slap Damage an some exploit of over powering on the attacker side.
---
It’s the “ritual bindings” outfit teamed with a civil war top hat instead of the ritual bindings mask and the background is the painting in wall decorations of a chicken picking over a skeletal carcass. When we get camp decorating I’m going to pop some skulls next to my stove  too lol
---
Yeah I came across the lookout tower last night that had three different types of planter boxes.... Oh god how I would love them
---
Oh yay, because Melee needed more DPS.
---
I'm still totally trying this.
---
You really don't need blood build damage unless you need to kill SB queen.  
---
I was on for 20 minutes lol consent in the wasteland? I didnt know that was a thing 😂
---
This confused the hell out of me at first as well 
---
Your literally my favorite person on Reddit you beautiful soul 
---
We miss having you on GSTV!
---
Yeah agree. I mean after 500 odd hours I should've had at least one type of TSE. I do think GOOD Legendaries should only drop as rewards for quests. Whether that be random , dailys or weeklies.
---
Yeah I got confused as well but after 9 wasted points I finally realized 😂
---
Try identifying where mob spawn point is, so you can attack them before they attack your camp.
---
Disagree on the chameleon armor, if your patient enough to wait then you've earned the ambush
---
I managed to score a Furious AA handmade auto, if only I could lock it so I don't accidentally sell it I'd be a happy wasteland wanderer.
---
if you have 12+ perception, you don't need a 20lb rifle. Most of the mods add a ton of weight for minimal benefit. you should be able to shed \~10lbs on each of those rifles by slimming down to standard long barrel, stock, and a medium NV/Recon scope, as opposed to a stabilized/true barrel/stock and long NV/Recon scope.
---
additionally, you can't even hit enemies past a certain range, even with a long NV/Recon scope, despite them being big enough in the FOV that you should be able.
---
Yeah, that's why this thread confuses me. Push to talk was on by default for me, and they keybind is backspace. So I will never turn my mic on by accident, and don't need to disable it... I can respond just fine to anyone who wants to chat.
---
Although in 120 levels I have only ever seen two people use their mics, and had one conversation only because someone came into my CAMP because there's wouldn't spawn because of my placement. They were chill about it and I offered to move. 
---
AHH fuck. Oh well, I've finally found my first bug in the game.  
---
Power armour animations (1st &amp; 3rd person) have this as a one handed weapon.  
---
Actually, is this a bug or just a fuck up?
---
Actually, given the lore around 76, all raiders ended up either as you suggested, or as Scorched.  Has anyone seen any living NON-player Raiders on the map?  No?  Wonder why that is?  Between turning into ghouls (ferals) and scorched and infighting, the various "Raiders" in Appalachia are all GONE.  Same with the Responders, and every other surviving human aside from the people who came out of Vault 76.  They've all become feral ghouls, scorched, or corpses.  The Vault 76 survivors have all followed along (eventually) and gotten immunized against the scorched plague, so they won't have that issue.
---
This is why I have issues with those claiming to be "roleplaying" as raiders.  Any living raider would be getting the hell out of Appalachia.  WAY too much risk for the reward.  They're noted for liking easy targets.  The Sierra Bravos pretty much nix that in the bud.
---
Vats for me has never really been than much of an issue. But tbh I think VATS does not belong in an online game..
---
I hear “better rewards” from Bethesda’s 100 days survival server roadmap and to me that speaks better legendaries, better drops, and better event prizes.  What does that speak to you?  The risk is losing more but more risk means more rewards. I’m just curious why you’re saying there’s no basis for my assumptions when the word “rewards” could mean a bunch of things, including legendaries.  
---
It was in fo4 so prolly just them being lazy
---
The nuke pieces arent necessary to launch a nuke, so theyre pretty pointless since the codes get posted online so I think you can feel free to drop them/not worry about them!
---
The late 20s and early 30s are brutal. But you've done a lot more questing that I have. I'm 94 and haven't done half of what you're doing, so you're doing pretty damned good considering. There is no point where you cant "recover" and get a build that works for you. 76 doesn't have eq2 or wow's problem of cookie cutter builds which is a nice change. Be you, have fun. 
---
Or you lose players based on constant unhappiness of harsh griefing like there is now. Splitting the base may be what is needed. Giving an all clear for those to play a game. A game mode based not on imaginary athletic abilities who meetup too prove ping superiority and luck and are smart enough to use Discord to harass others. (Like what usually goes on in mmorpgs with PvP) Or you could just have only Nuked zones be PvP. Either Way they screwed up the idea and presentation of this game from the beginning. I'm ok with no Humanoid NPC's. What bugs me (besides the bugs) is no real insight into long term PvP players that just get bored with the game and grief. SAD!
---
My fiancé and I have a “shh, dialogue” system that works pretty well. I tend to do story quests and listen to holotapes when I’m playing solo though; it’s just easier that way. 
---
My perk cards were a real mess at around level 45, so I spent time at WhiteSpring and power levelled for a week or two and completely rebuild my cards to reorganize my builds.
---
I needed to change down many 3\* to 1\* (so I do have duplicates now) to add flexibility to my builds and change my Special Stats, moving points, that all used up allot of levels, but got there in the end, now I have a good card library to pull from.
---
Sooooooooo many armor drops.  SO MANY.  And never what I’m looking for.  I’ve stocked many people’s armor sets from my drops haha!  
---
400lb stash at beta was the worst.. but the move to 600 made it more manageable but week or so ago they raised stash again to 800 and its gotten to where it is really easy to stay well under that amount even with adding in some armor and weapons to the stash..   
---
best advice i can give you weight wise and having to drop things is keep all your scrap/junk at 100 except for a few things (springs, screws, steel, lead, acid, gunpowder, wood, ballistic fiber, adhesive, plastic if using shotguns) most all of the other items are usually situational. most of my suggestions above are used in repairing weapons, armor, building camp stuff, and making ammo. if you sit at 100 on most things it should put ya round the 400lb mark, then having more of the extras can hit 5ish, carry alot of steel and lead possibly hit 600. but its alot more manageable than it was couple months back
---
I'm east coast. Play mostly between 5 and 11 every day. Level 95
---
I found a couple pieces there right as I was building my Excavator Set down in the lab there.
---
thats to many lights my dude.
---
Alright sounds fair. You wanna send me an invite or what?
---
IMO most are not doing it for the "Junk" .. they are doing it for the enjoyment of ruining someones else experience. 
---
A few Examples
---
They offer to trade with you , but I have nothing of value to trade for and if I don't trade they get mad and slap damage me to oblivion. 
---
They come to my base they wanna trade with me , I don't .. they get butt hurt and start shooting my base and then slap dmg me to oblivion. 
---
I spawn into white springs , I want to kill the set of scorched that have spawned for me, for showing up there. I am slap damaged into oblivion for having the gall to show up to "THEIR" farming area ..
---
I am at a vendor, trying to toggle through my Inventory to sell .. Yup you guess it .. slap dmg into oblivion hahahah 
---
My base is where there base is , So they are mad that I am there on their friends server , the get the ole gang together and come on down and force me to server drop because they are gonna blow up my base and yup .. you guessed it again .. Slap dmg me to oblivion 
---
I guess I was lucky to only waste 3 then 😳
---
Send a request my way! I hope to have a bunch when i log on next
---
Yeah I messed up😅
---
I’m in
---
Yep it has aways been that way for me too, it's part of my game play now I just wait a second after switching targets. What ever this new bug is it's crazy I'll even reload at 95% and miss 3 shots in a row.
---
\^\^This\^\^
---
The camo military fatigues are Casual Underarmor
---
Gotta say, likewise.  I've been needing something fun to do in the game.  My gun merchant lady needs some work to do.
---
No but I like crafting armor and weapons for lower level players and sometimes I round up 2 or 3 people and it takes forever to craft multiple full sets of armor or power armor, especially if putting mods in them. 
---
If you’re generally following the main quests, you run into this problem.  They take you to areas higher than the natural corresponding progression of levels, skipping other areas.
---
Add to this the tendency for Whitesprings to be nuked and flooded with high-level mobs, despite Whitesprings being an area lower-level players are directed to.
---
Take a run through Camden Park and down to Welch, then when you have plateaued there head back through the Toxic Valley to Grafton Steel and area.  Eventually you can head back to Whitesprings, Harper’s Ferry and Huntersville.
---
I’m on PC. Some players have them. I didn’t ask how. 
---
New char is only usefull for the first 2 months. After that diehards will have level 200 characters that can hop onto servers with new level 1 chars thier friends made. 
---
I do want new chars only for pvp... but honestly only people playing now get any real advantage from that. People starting for the 1st time a year from now will have to deal with everything we are complaining about right now in regards to high level characters and the weapon economy.
---
Well I’m just talking about damage in general. The guns I have don’t do as much damage as my melees so it would be nice to have a powerful gun 
---
can anyone tell me if power armor protection stacks with the *under*armor you might also be wearing?
---
95% of the time it misses every time.
---
Gun fu works great though.
---
tbh it was a first attempt at a multiplayer its the pokemon lets go of bethesda 
---
I usually play from 11-6 gt is XGN 1NV1CTUS
---
This is what i'm afraid will occur. They really need to overhaul the damage and AP usage of energy/heavy weapons considerably.
---
I don't think any of the Devs understand how the damage equations work. once you're in Danger or Detected, your weapons do 1/2 damage. Nearly all the energy weapons, and all heavy weapons are loud as hell so you're always in Danger.
---
so if all your testing is against AI-less ragdolls with no danger, yeah the damage looks great.
---
You can definitely launch a nuke at lvl 40 I launched my first nuke at around level 37
---
Fortnite 2.0?
---
I still don't see the level of briefing being as bad as people.  Sure some random person here and there.  I'm near 300 hours in and every player I find either minds their business or waves.  I'm on PS4 so I can't speak for xb1 or PC.  It just feels like some people have a bad experience and think everyone is like that.  I also see commonly majority of griefing reported here always has to do with workshops.  You capture a workshop, you take the risk.  The game shouldn't be fundamentally altered or split because you had a bad session.  
---
Also, I've said it 1000 times, play red dead online for 1 hour if you really want to know what true griefing is.  Fallout is Disneyland in comparison.
---
Might be a bit like Disney and other animators only drawing a thumb and three fingers to avoid hands looking weird clumsy and too large, maybe animating a 2 handed weapon with two hands makes the whole animation look strange?
---
I've never played any other games so I'm probably talking out of my \*ss
---
At least duper post died out, these "PVP == Bullies" post just keep poping up. 
---
LOL .. it was never marketed as a PVP game .. it was marketed as a Multiplayer game with PVP aspects. We should have the option to opt out.  And its coming ... All the little griefers gonna be butt hurt.  Bunch of little wimps that wont make it in survival mode anyways .. 
---
Stockholm syndrome is a bitch isn't it
---
Cool. I probably won’t be on for a few hours tho.  
---
your misusing the word 
---
I'm almost back to my house from doing a quick errand. I'll send you an invite when I get back. Should not be long!
---
Yes, never had an issue before. Now I have it a bunch
---
Often when you visit a vendor their cap balance shows as 0 but actually if you sell something like a bobby pin the balance will jump to 199 caps. Its' a *glitch.*
---
Oh really? I thought you needed the pieces in order to do it. I’m still rather new to the game.
---
The bombs just didn’t drop in Appalachia. Every other place likely was. Like Vegas. We know that House stopped some. There are several tapes saying that the bombs didn’t hit the region 
---
This.  Most of the "raiders" aren't looking to play as raiders.  They're having fun being a thorn in other players sides.  They aren't so much interested in the caps or the junk.  They just want to mess up other peoples fun so they can feel better about themselves.
---
The one "raider" who has posted about playing it where he demands food and only attacks if they refuse?  THAT's at least reasonable.  Why?
---
1. Victim player can server hop right then if they have no desire to interact at all, or fast-travel away and crouch for a while.
---
2. Victim player can contact friends over team chat to come help (if they aren't there.)
---
3. Victim player can barter "I haven't got any food to spare, but I've got plenty of purified water, will that do?"  This also gives the victim time to select weapons/armor/etc....
---
4. Victim player can simply refuse and let the "raider" initiate PvP.
---
This makes things a bit more even-footed, and I wouldn't consider it griefing at all (well, depends on how long the "raider" waits for an answer.....a few seconds isn't enough.)
---
Real "raiders" are about RAIDING.  Getting food/supplies via threats.  NOT simply psychopathic killers who just kill for kicks.  There were some who seemed that way, but even in Nuka-World in FO4 those didn't get much respect and were more used as weapons by the more cunning leaders in the Raiders.
---
Are you on bro?
---
And while wearing a cool hat :)
---
In theory yea, since if you get all pieces you can decipher the code yourself, but its kinda tricky so people just go online and get the code each week, I thought the same as you did when I started too
---
This is a horrible idea, what if its a small crime, I get bounties for destroting turrets in workshops I'm taking over when im not supposed too. Its the wasteland and some people have to be raiders.
---
As a sniper, you probably dont benefit too much from luck except tormenter, but for a sniper that one isnt necessary, but it's a game and you can play however you want. You'll be able to change stuff later. Intelligence is good to have at 5, as there are a lot of intelligence perks you'll want, but wont need every second, and gunsmith is arguably one of them. Perception is definitely needed, but not so much at early levels. I'd say pick up 1 concentrated fire, and a rifleman of each type until the juicy stuff appears like tank killer. Agility is also great. You'll definitely want alot, as it makes you stealthier. I'd recommend sneak, covert operative, and maybe mr sandman. But only sandman if you're planning on using suppressors and doing lots of attacks or supply runs at night (it only gives sneak attack bonuses on silenced weapons at night). You'll probably want pack rat when it appears to carry lots of junk to build, so that's just up to 3 points in strength. 
---
I know I’m not restarted I’m just mean the one(s) that affected Appalachia.
---
This!
---
Iirc 
---
I got it yesterday, all it does is reduced my health by 12, tried all the fixes, no dice.
---
Wait for them to come back around?
---
Wouldn't call it anything major. Its just consumables afaik.
---
Because they are in the aid category and everything in it will be dropped upon death in the new survival mode.
---
 "**has always been promoted as a PvP"** wrong **..** 
---
Same
---
Something I wish for is the ability to re-repair to 200% even if the armor has not broken below 100%, I hate the waiting and reduced resists.
---
Literally nothing about what he did has anything to do with passive mode. The only “trick” on display was training mobs to attack a payer base, to avoid a bounty. Whether or not he had passive mode on had nothing to do with it.
---
IMO 100% correct!!!
---
I think they're already working on the whitesprings issue. Enough people have yelled about it.
---
That other point though, yeah that seems like it could.be an exploit of the system. But I believe the pros out weight the cons in this situation.
---
No one else seems to be reporting any issues. If you've found a bug, you should probably let the mod author know in the comments on the Nexus page. 
---
I play PS4 and have never once experienced the level of griefing that I've seen people complain about. Not to start a console vs PC fight but my best guess is these are PC players and I can't say I'd be surprised if their are a bunch of trolls rolling around those servers. 
---
It happens.  The process for making suoer mutants isnt perfected and sometimes we get these special ones.
---
Technically every 20 hours pretty sure!
---
you do you boo
---
GT: TonyCowboysFan Hit me up this weekend!  I’m lev 100
---
Yeah, I had to learn this too. They made the codes so tedious to find and the cypher so frikkin complex that someone online will just do it and post them all every week. Makes sense, since the more launches, the better for the whole community. 
---
The only thing YOU need is a nuke keycard.
---
I shall, now if only my scorched yao guai would go in the room I made him so that he'd be safe.
---
Quests or events.  Either way, yes 
---
Go back to fallout 4 if you don't like pvp,  I can 1 shoot a 200+ on my level 20, 
---
As a ranged sniper the whole idea of slap damage and having to both hit each other before ovo is just inane to me. 
---
Melee again has the upper hand,  as I can't do pvp sniper - everything has to be in the melee sandbox or it's shit. 
---
Such a badly designed mess all around. 
---
I miss the wastes and yall aswell :'(
---
I’m in.   GT: TonyCowboysFan.  Hit me up this weekend.  Level 100 here.
---
LOL.  I just described a scenario I went through as a low level.  So, yes it happens and you're delusional if you thino it doesn't.  There's not much of a choice when some asshat one-shots you over and over again.  At that point, there is no choice but to give up.  That's an unbalanced game when one person has no chance of winning. 
---
I fully agree. People want mindless and easy. That’s not what this game is supposed to be. 
---
You have  to pack it up and then resettle it .. and your stuff will be fixed .. Not server hop. I've done this once, but it's not helpful or Ideal for me to do this when I am settled in a difficult building spot where things are in the way .. my blue print never fits just right again.
---
the server Hop part is just to get away from the guys killing your base . You don't have to server hop, just move your base 
---
k
---
I take pictures and videos of every glitch I’ve come across since Day One. 
---
We (me and my brother) also found one doing this, we had just wiped out Harps Ferry and assumed he was sureendering, so after yelling some movie quotes about him not offering us mercy, we killed him too.
---
The very first showcase showed the same clip of players shooting each other 50 times. Its a PVP game. Every single response from Bethesda has proven that they don't care about making a PVE section for people, and they are even decided the game needs a less forgiving PVP mode. I get its not what you like, but being killed by a player even once is on you, not the game. When someone shoots me more than one time and I don't want to bother with PVP, I block them and relog and the problem is gone. Being killed multiple times by the same person only shows your ineptitude, not a flaw in the game. 
---
You are the only person that mentioned rust, and its stupid to even bring rust up at this point. Everyone has heard the comparison drawn before anyone knew anything about the game, and everyone knows the game is not like rust.
---
...and anyone who turns Pacifist mode on  shouldn't be able to attack any Wanted player for 24 hours after turning it off.
---
Why even bother with sniper/shotgun as a HW user? I carry a couple light melee weapons as backup weapons (hey, I’ve got 15str for HW perks, my melee weapons are good!). The hell do I need a sniper for? I’ve got a missile launcher. Shotgun? I’ve got an LMG. 
---
Thanks guys. Im at lvl106 I think. I've been trying to solo it but to no luck. I'll send you guys messages this weekend
---
nicely done! I have a bunch of good ass guns in my weapons list, as long as u have a good eye and remain aware it wont happen, dont worry too much. Worst case scenario u can buy it back. Worst Worst case scenario u dont notice til later and hopefully when u go back u can buy it again. 
---
Ive never had this issue :/ then again any time someone has tried to pvp me I one shot them in the head or backpedal and repeat as slow power armor melee dude dies a slow mediocre death
---
Really good to know, thank you. I’ll plan some builds but this helps me a lot with my distribution while I level. Loving the game so far. Really feels like I can play however I like which is really unique. 
---
is it permanent?
---
Depends on your build. 
---
If you have no imagination and need a game to tell you exactly how to RP then no, there is no foundation. But we create our own stories.
---
&gt;You probably wouldn't need to disassemble a laser rifle in the field at all, just clean the lens.
---
LMAO. That's what the Army said about the brand new, high tech, M-16 when it was introduced. Didn't even give a cleaning kit for it. It didn't make it far in SE Asia without said nonexistent cleaning kit. Don't believe that all high tech wizardry is superior to tried and true OG gear. 
---
I was told that pending a new patch it would be reactivated but two weeks later and no response so I'm just kinda giving up on my level 103
---
Bloody mess is needed for all builds
---
Yeah, we got to keep the quality of this sub high! How else are we going to see 30 suggestions to expand Appalachian Radio each week?
---
I’ve tried it with a bloodied Ripper, it was capped at 5dps. (I did that Slap Damage testing post a week or so ago).
---
I also tried it with a 25% fire rate LMG.
---
I haven’t tried a 2star swing speed combat knife, I’ll give it a shot if I can find a fast legendary swing speed melee weapon. 
---
If you take VATS out of the game PvP becomes really unbalanced. As it's implemented now, it makes sense. Further, it's a faithful update of previous fallouts' VATS mechanic given the game has gone from isometric third person to first person. Fallout needs to become more like other FPS games about as much as it needs to become the next battle royale sensation. 
---
&gt; Spend the time working your way up to that roof before you engage the melee build. By the time they reach you, they are dead.
---
In my PvP experience a lot of people don't have the patience for that. They like to blunder around the area looking for me. I think a lot of the shitty PvPers are so used to walking up to enemies and face-tanking they have a hard time dealing with somebody who puts a little thought into PvP.
---
yep solo or teamed they can do this anytime they want to.
---
its the easiest form on pvp as requires no 2 person authentication as whomever took the workshop is like shooting everyone on the server and waiting for them to come after you anytime they want.
---
started playing myself 2nd day of beta, and just about the week before christmas, my friends and i were above 50's and i started gathering christmas presents for myself and friends was able to grab quite a few TSE's i wasnt really heavily into the reddit forums here yet and spent most my waking hours in the game so wasnt really clued in to how widespread the duping was (except cussin em for server disconnects) and never asked if what i was getting was duped or not, but got myself a few nice items and picked up a few things for my friends for christmas presents.
---
they all survived the dupe purge, looking back were they duped? more than likely i mean all of em were pretty cheap at the time, and when i started getting into the reddit forums and paying more attention to the vault and so on when the dupe wipe came up i was understandably nervous but bethesda was nice enough to allow me to keep my stuff and my friends their gifts. 
---
but my opinion on it would still be if ya want something go out and trade for it. its an online game and things change daily there could already be new exploits being taken for granted and things being "quietly" duped still (because there is always someone looking to exploit a game) but us average users/players would never know it, chance ya always take in an online game with random item generators and a player trading system. 
---
For sure! We are shooting to have another stream next week. 
---
"Legacy"?
---
This is bad. Why don't then take Adventure Mode and turn it completely offline mode. Then people are alone in server and don't have to worry about other players. This is exactly where game is going, except it is online, yet you play like there are no players. You said "We want little drama", watered survival experience to non existing and now you decide to remove it completely. Where is the drama? Instead of turning pacifist mode into God Mode, why not remove slap damage. 
---
This happens a lot to me also. I think it’s because that player is already in a team. I’m assuming it’s not because of your ban because I have never been banned and it happens to me.  
---
I’ll investigate if I can find a swing speed legendary combat knife/switch blade/other fast melee. I already tested a bloodied ripper and a 25% fire rate LMG
---
\&gt;! doesn't the main quest have a part where you use an autodoc to innoculate yourself against the scorch plague? !&lt;
---
&gt;Melee is only OP due to legendaries and VATS enabling instakill - teleporting builds that have no counter.
---
They have a counter, it's called staggering. Every weapon can do it. Calling it teleporting is a gross misrepresentation.
---
&gt;legendaries, vats, and stealthboys/chameleon are the 3 biggest issues facing PvP
---
Stealthboys and chameleon are counters to VATS. Given that, it's balanced. 
---
There’s a very small local quest there, just tracking down holotapes locally
---
Just wasted 2 hours to build house from the scratch (rebuild - I've stored all the components), I don't know how I stand that again. Hope that won't happen again...
---
Just found 3 t45 level 25 pieces at the morgantown railcard .. you can have them if you on xb1
---
I'm logging in now.  My gt is Abinsursec2814.   Shoot me a message when you're in and I'll invite you to the team to trade
---
Garbage and meaningless. I already have best looking mask, best gear, what does this content give to me? Nothing.
---
Yup, agreed.  There really isn't an ideal solution.  I think allowing you to transfer characters in gives you the ability to recoup losses.  But at the end of the day decreases risks on the pvp server, defeating some of the point for a harsher mode.  They're going to upset people no matter what they do. 
---
This. Different areas have different level ranges they will spawn based on the level of the “first arrival” since the cell reset. 
---
I have a technical bug to report. When playing FO76 using a 144Hz FreeSync monitor the game's performance is very, very poor.
---
I have two PCs in my household with the same specs and this happens on both of them:
---
* AMD Ryzen 2600
---
* 16GB DDR4-3200
---
* Asus Radeon R9 290 4GB
---
* MSI G27C2 27" 1080p 144Hz FreeSync
---
If I set the monitor's refresh rate to 144Hz and launch FO76, the in-game FPS runs at around 10. If I set the monitor's refresh rate to 60Hz the in-game performance is normal, which for me means usually 60 FPS.
---
I reported this with a ticket and haven't had a response.
---
I would be happy to provide all the technical information from my PCs via PM or a new ticket if it would help.
---
I just looked up a site that listed &amp; pictured the locations of all the treasure spots. Fast travelled to each one, in most instances I had 3-4 maps for each location. Took about 3 hours to get through about 20 maps.
---
You did a great job! Wow!
---
Adrenal works, ignore the tooltip.
---
It’s broken with Strange in Numbers, though.  
---
Maybe they are just scrolling through your inventory? I’ve done that a number of times...
---
there was a pretty in depth post detailing slap damage mechanics. AFAIK, there is no way to kill through slap damage other than slow attrition. Pulling people into combat is exploitable, but this isn't an issue for survival mode since everyone is PvP enabled by default.
---
You mean five hours of looting for 12 seconds of flamer use isn't  a good balance....
---
I agree. Or at least a quick command on the menu screen like photomode has. 
---
If they're wanted you can kill them.  
---
Bro, nobody wants to improve themselves. They want to complain on Reddit and beg the devs to remove what they don't understand.
---
You think 7000 caps is a lot Ive been saving for weeks and I still can't buy 1 serum plan 
---
Same. WS grind really isn't bad at all since the amount of junk you get is nuts. I still grind it when I'm feeling lazy.
---
No there not wanted
---
It gives you cool collectible masks that could sell really good on the market, gives you a new event to grind out and enjoy, and gives you a reason to come back and play the game.
---
Plasma gatling or gatling gun? Distinction needs to be made, because I don't see how it's possible for a gatling gun to break in 1 clip. Mine (1*bloodied) lasts for ... idk 20-30 clips or something along those lines? I honestly don't even know, I can play for an hour or two before even thinking about repairing.
---
A lot of time people are just looking or want to make a quick sale. You can sort by requested and see if they want anything. I carry tons of plans on me for those occasions and tend to give people a bit of time to look them over, but never wait more than a few minutes to get back to what I'm doing. Don't feel obligated to engage in a trade at all or wait around if people aren't requesting anything or setting prices on what you've requested. Some of my best purchases and sales have been to random players in servers I'm hopping, so can be good to be patient.
---
Some of the events that spawn there give you tokens
---
There hasnt been a patch for three weeks which is abnormal cause there’s supposed to be one weekly. Next patch should come friday or next friday depending of they skip a week again.. dont give up just yet brotha
---
Variety my friend, lol. I like to scope things out before diving head first into situations plus a sneak shot gives bonus damage. Silenced Gause Rifle with Night Vision scope is choice. Basic lvl 50 combat shotgun does 120 damage per shot so 3-4 rounds kill most all of the mid-level bishes vs 20-30 rnds from the BMG or 100 from a LMG (as fast as that thing shoots, lol)
---
Today was really bad...really frustrating when using a Gauss Rifle....*charge*...95%...miss...*charge*...95%...miss...etc.
---
5 shot mag and I get one or two hits.  :-(
---
Yeah you don’t understand the economy at all and you can make caps by selling and trading as well..server hopping for caps doesn’t work anymore 
---
Majority of griefing cases boil down to workshop capturing and not reading the clear message about pvp being opened.  However, a clear pvp notification on screen is a better solution than trying to nerf pvp in a post apocalyptic wasteland.    
---
Crossing my finger, thanks for the love tho man it really bummed me out putting 200+ hours into a game and not even being able to boot it up anymore:/
---
Can't say for sure without seeing all your build etc. However armor piercing would not effect the damage shown on the weapon's info tab. So how exactly are you so sure that your damage is being increased?
---
Repeated tests here and on the official boards have shown that AA perks and mods do NOT change a mobs listed ER when viewing them with Awareness, though you can quite clearly see it working for DR.
---
I assume they fixed the Tesla because they fixed the reactive plates.  I don't have the Tesla torso to test it out, so don't get yourself a bounty without testing or confirming this.  As far as trading for the Stealth, I have the weapons I need and don't need mega caps to make a fair trade.  You know how much material goes into a torso, so equal components plus a little would make a trade.  I collect food grade Royal Jelly and irradiated Sugar Bombs too.  Maybe a Royal Jelly and 6  or 7 irradiated Sugar Bombs on top of material match and we could have a deal.
---
TIL you can wear a hat with the gasmask.
---
I use sun kissed at level one all the time to manage rads and it works well with mutations. 
---
I could work with that, but there needs to be a risk/reward balance.  For end game stuff like nuke zones then pvp should be enabled. 
---
Yeah you should be fine, i think u probably got banned after the patch so ull just have to wait whenever the next one comes out
---
Super duper and Pharma pharma gety votes.
---
I've encountered plenty of idiots on reddit, just none as big as you. You put words in my mouth, made assumptions and totally ignore the possibility that you're wrong. Few take all of those cakes. Thumbs up captain dipshit, you're an amazing specimen.
---
The scorchedbeast queen boss fight her health is glitched fix it Bethesda 
---
1 Calibrated Shocks Plan:  5600 Caps... you are not rich.
---
There are some craters though, like they irradiated one near the Monorail Elevator.  Just not the BIG bombs, I'd imagine.
---
they did say 4 to 5 timea durability
---
You can definitely do this one more than once per day! The reset timer on the event is 1 hour after the last time it was started, which will hopefully give you lots of opportunities to play through it during the week it's available.
---
&gt;its coming
---
Zero evidence but ok
---
Let them scroll through your inventory for a little while, then change your trade list to 'offers only' then jump through your tabs to see if they have offered to buy. If that's clear then there's either nothing they want, or they might be looking at the fact you have 5 furious knives and have decided  against trying some PVP with you. I've had people after random stuff, nurses hats &amp; blood flower blooms, that I would never have noticed otherwise 
---
You do lose workshops, yeah. That's why I'd still look at it but it's not significant to put above the DLC that's been announced. IMO anyway.
---
Exactly .. 7000 is nothing, you can't buy squat with that .. well almost nothing .. there are people that have over 100K in caps from trading weapons, 7K is not rich, it's small change. I rarely come close to 7K before spending it .. yeah server hopping doesn't work and stashes were broken with the last update, I rarely get the option to search stashes any more, so don't bother. I am left hitting up vendors every now and then for a measly 200 caps a day.
---
I enjoyed this backstory A+
---
i switch servers when if it keeps occurring. I assume its some kind of desync issue.
---
On my Hw-PA bloodied build I don’t use class freak. So I just use diluted stims and diluted rad-away to stay in the 10-20% health range. If I die and my rads get reset above it, I’ll usually just eat high-rad food or stand at a rad source until I’m back in it. Queen fights are a bit trickier. 
---
On my vats sniper Bloodied build I mostly don’t use class freak (I think 1pt?) mostly because I have 1 str 1 end baseline anyway, and my sniper mutations mostly reduce those, so it doesn’t matter. The worst is the max health loss from Adrenal.. I just cope.
---
Both use healing factor which means I rarely use stims anyway. 
---
And I’m over here like: How do people manage so many characters? Then again I’m so bad at playing other characters than my main that I’ve managed to rack up ~500 hours on Fallout 4, with at least 400 on a single character. I play rpgs in my own special way...
---
The staying below 20% health is my biggest hang up. I like having full health. I agree on explosive though, I have a couple that are fun, but I like getting up close and would die so often if my .50 was explosive.
---
Usually you can server hop in Welch (towards the Southwest of the map, slightly southwest past that massive structure thingy on the minimap) and kill about two dozen each time you load in. Just a heads-up, though - usually it's a mix of diggers and foremen, the foremen are tougher than normal super mutants, and usually you'll be fighting five at a time
---
I tried in game, but I couldn't get the invite to work "player could not be found" Try adding me next time you are on. Foxsable is pretty easy to type. 
---
Same happened to me with the spear, which in PA you swing it like a fucking hammer. Outside you jab it like... well, a spear.
---
My guess is its not so much a bug as it is a limitation of making the character model's 2 hand animations look right inside PA. The models arms would clip through their chest in pa if they used the same animation. Seeing how much people complained about underarmor clipping through outfits, I can see why they used different animations
---
Done. Btw I can build all power armor, Tesla rifles with all the mods, and much more. I have a spare x-01 jet pack too. I'm working on collecting all the pa mod plans starting with excavator calibrated shocks.  Not to mention many 3* pieces just sitting in my storage im dying to give away. 
---
If you are going low-health, bloodied all the way. AA is like, 30% more damage. Low health at 20%, bloodied is like... 69%?
---
It's more of the fact that if u wanted to initiate pvp to kill him you could. He they wouldn't be any recourse or attacking because he's passive. He can train mobs to kill your base and you can't do anything about it. Just watch it or leave 
---
So if they leave the workshop area they are still in PvP? I’ve been hearing conflicting reports on this, some day when you leave the workshop area and your claim fails you exit pvp, which is why they need a team to kill you if you aren’t at the workshop. 
---
They announced PvP mode and Survival mode. Why not just a PvE only mode (server) and the "fan"base hasn't split over this besides the normal questions.  
---
i've noticed more griefers recently but not by an overwhelming amount.   Had two incidents within the past month (similar to the OP's).  the first time, i just jumped servers, problem solved.   The second time, i didn't want to leave the server for whatever reason, so i just made the griefers experience as boring as possible and they left within a minute or two and was actually kinda fun.   
---
This second time, there were 5 people attacking/killing people then resolving each others bounty's.  after they hit me a few times,  i just walked away from them backwards, watching them and making sure i kept their interest. My goal then was just to see how far they'd follow. Never attacked back and stayed at a "we almost got him" distance. I used maybe 3-5 stimpacks while letting their slower team member catch up.  Once they figured out I was playing with them, they left.   
---
Anybody remember DeadRising?  I want to hit golfballs at shit with the golf club haha
---
Yes! I forgot I even had one!
---
Damn! I have like nothing! But if I start playing with people hopefully it will speed up my legendary obtaining! 
---
Dude just a few nights ago I got a 3* Vampires Gatling Plasma on my heavy gunner/melee mashup character.  Felt so good.
---
Lol I’ve done none of those things, but go ahead and lie to yourself. I haven’t been here even half a year and I can tell you that you sound like many of the morons perpetuating false information everywhere, it’s a plague to these forums.
---
I can appreciate that being left in: the video as a whole looks really tight, and that little underwear piece just gives the video a tiny speck of humour and identity of some sorts. It works well!
---
thank you still some grammar i see but i think the topic has been delivered properly :D
---
Eh ... one rank to reduce by 90%? No way.
---
They need to not reduce weight of heavy weapons and instead look at rifles - which often weigh much much more
---
Oh I burn vendors everyday for a total of 1400 caps..and we also forgot pvp is a viable money source as well I often make at least 500 to 1000 most days just in pvp
---
Will it be fixed while we still have the mutation? 
---
Because this isn't an mmo, this is a survival game.  Pve only doesn't make any sense.  How would workshops work then? 
---
 I meant further divide player counts, making servers less populated overall.
---
Also since the Story is not done yet im picking up puzzles of this ( just discovered that supervisor in one of the main mines was aware about the ultracite digging ) And i need your help im looking for holotapes / plans / refrences / maps / pictures / screenshots of everything that is connected to ultracite with detailed information where you get it. If you want to help in person in discoveries i will be much happy to have a indiana jones style companion that will take some time and start digging with me ( i have finished the contect in 2 chars and i have nothing to do so..... yeh ) im on playstation
---
I heard about it before and kept looking. One day I ran across it by accident, but I can't remember where exactly. Somewhere in the Forest region, I think.
---
I don't accept trades with Players I don't know. Too often people are scrolling through my inventory to see how to exploit a win in PvP based on what I have at my disposal. Just roll the dice dude, you win or you die. Everyone would buy a lottery ticket if they knew they would win, it's about the "risk". Anyway, just my 2 cents. Gotta watch out for PvP Inventory snoopers.
---
Or maybe I can just keep *not* playing with other players, smart guy.
---
&gt;I will not go into further detail, as I have no desire for people to copy this strategy and setup widely.
---
I don't think you need to go into further detail. I think it's pretty obvious what you're doing and it's pretty easy to counter. While you spam heal you're vulnerable. Your armor is easily destroyed with any explosive shotgun build or heavy weapon build, so the advantages of PA are short lived. Furthermore, anyone with concentrated fire can target your fusion core. You only have level 3 flameproof to lean on so you can only negate 45% damage from explosives without a dense torso mod. Even if you are tanky while you spam heal, you're an easy target for people to charge their crit meter off of, so all your buddies are going to die to crits built off of you. Sure, you could be killed easily, but I'd probably keep you alive just for that aspect. You'd be just as responsible for keeping your team alive as you would be getting them one shot to death. Your strategy is easy to counter. That's why they don't need to fix it - its wholly non-viable and easily countered. but if you want to waste your resources fighting PvE players that don't know how to PvP to feel good about your tactics, knock yourself out. Once survival hits I imagine you're going to have to pivot.
---
&gt;Also, to add to that, there are a lot of people here, who apparently consider VATS to be the solution
---
VATS is a solution and there have been plenty of informative posts about how VATS and crits deal incredibly more damage with every weapon. Your spam healer doesn't need to become a focus of everyone's fire, just the right person's. A decent rifleman can take him down easily. An explosive shotgun build, heavy gunner, or melee user could do the same. Anyone who takes your spam healer down once can probably switch out after the first kill since your PA will be destroyed and they'll be an easy target for anyone. You better respawn quick or they'll destroy your PA while you lay there dead.
---
&gt; leaving another two damage sources which will cut you down, as the luck builds lack proper tankiness.
---
assassin+sent/cavalier/blocker and a team stacked with empaths. There's more to tankiness than perk card distribution. If you ever want to do a team v team fight on PC, I'll fight you. No malice, just a fun fight. I think your strategy works for small engagements, but I don't think it fits an extended fight at all. 
---
Seen a picture of a gas mask being worn with a tattered hat. It's a random image from Google from number 4 and u can't wear it in 76 at all. Was disapointed
---
XcQ, link staying blue.
---
Lots of mods and repairs use Aluminum. Virtually all ammo used Lead. Silver and gold are much more infrequent, somewhat common in energy weapon/ammo crafting but people aren’t using those much right now ‘cause they suck. 
---
There arent many "must haves" at any given time, but there are a lot of must haves in certain situations and builds.
---
Ive never unequipped born survivor (1*). 
---
Travel agent. 
---
Hard bargain (always equipped unless I know im not goin back to sell stuff for a long time).
---
If you do mutations, starched genes.
---
Personally, I keep makeshift warrior and the ranged one on all the time, it takes real life days before I have to repair.
---
You can't really go wrong with any build in FO76.
---
because damage mitigation is better than DR. DR is kind've a last resort, that's why alot of the PvP players are laughing off a PA build for PvP
---
Even more reason to add it.
---
Huh. I couldn't seem to be able to wear any hats with the gasmask in FO4. Wonder if they used a mod. 
---
&gt; Legendary chameleon armor:
---
I have the feeling this will be broken in open PVP, with way too many people camping at various spots invisibly to ambush other players.
---
There are no counters to this.
---
Berry mentats is a thing. And you can craft tons of them if you know plants spots. i eat about 25-30 per day and craft 50-60 every 2 days. it's pretty simple
---
Also i'll never play survival mode on my level 391. i don't want to lose 391 caps any time i die. reward should be capped at 50-75 caps
---
Did a fat nut when I found my bloodied explosive lever action off of a hard-killed deathclaw in WS
---
I think they could stand to lose weight, but in particular, the ones given as quest rewards should be lightened, like the Pyrolizer or the Bunker Buster.  No one expects a 40 lb. quest reward.
---
Captain Cosmos PA was sweet, i liked the CC content!!
---
I'm disappointed in the players that bash the game because of knee jerk YT'ers, a frivolous "nylon bag", and the ilk. No quarter for the impatient. Go play Anthem or whatever with your friends.

Phillipi cemetery has civil war outfits, Dolly Sods Wilderness (northern building) has a molerat costume behind a lvl2 lock upstairs ( or go through a hole in the ceiling). Most vendor bots have something wearable too

Plz Beth, difficulty slider needed. Keep getting killed by haxxors
---
I’d turn off motion blur and depth of field if you haven’t already, not only does it use more resources but it makes the game look like a blurry PoS 
---
Energy weapons have some major issues across the board. One of the biggest is that currently they do not benefit from any sort of armor piercing effect. Laser and Plasma weapons have pretty bad durability as well. 
---
I really dont like that theres 5 levels of crafting for spiky stick hitty things. It really should be only 3 and maybe 1 in science I guess would make sense for the energy mods. And since I living in my power armor I need another 6 in INT so the cores and condition drain is manageable

Scorchedbeast queen health bar is glitched 
---
I’ll give it a whirl. That’s my struggle right now playing. On PC it seems still way buggy and just plain crappy looking. 
---
I am probably thinking of the wrong ones then. Thanks for the info.
---
Agree.  So odd that they decided to go that route.  New characters only. 
---
Turning off depth of field alone will make a world of difference. Trust me on that. With it on it looks like the whole screen is blurry outside of a circle in the middle of the screen. Idk who tf programmed their DoF but it’s actual garbage lmao 
---
I carry a recon .44 revolver for that. Lighter, similar damage if I actually want to use it for that.
---
But I also run a low health build and have 1* Bloodied variants of most heavy weapons (still want a bloodied 50cal...). My instigating Gatling gun 1shots most weaker enemies (ghouls, scorched) and my bloodied one makes short work of supermutants on up to scorchbeasts.
---
Bloodied builds work really well with PA/heavy weapons because you can run Emergency Protocols torso and be really tanky.  
---
Thanks but I play October PS4 
---
Do you know which ones in particular or is it just the ash in general?
---
Sometimes I think they are just like “Why is 90% of your inventory just costume items???”
---
The fact that you have not yet encountered the damage exploit yourself goes to show that you are not as experienced as you present yourself to be. Sure it is not super common, as the issue is relatively new, but common enough for me to have seen it three times in a week now. Just today a Scorchbest Queen was 2 hit killed by someone using it. Anyway the great thing is, I just have to wait, the day will come when you stand around in normal Fallout 76 and a guy walks up to you and instantly kills you. Maybe you will remember this post then, to recall how wrong you were or maybe you quit the game before it happens, because Survival will be pretty bad if things are not adjusted by then. Or MAYBE I shoudl try to spread the exploit, to ruin the fun for everyone and by the time survival comes around, half the people will invis camp and the other half will be a heal spamming full tank with glitched instant kill melee, only killable by others using the exploit. Yeah that sounds like great fun.
---
That’s not the same 
---
I only have a "This is a pretty nice weapon/piece of armor" build
---
What in the hell are you talking about? Someone can stand 15 feet away and instantly appear on top of you and simultaneously strike you with their weapon. 
---
That’s teleportation. What the fuck else would you call it? And how would you stagger someone who is invisible and you don’t see? You’re just going to have to constantly walk around in stealth to avoid getting ganked?
---
Why not just remove both of these mechanics that break any remote semblance of balance? Make it so that if you want to crank someone with a sledgehammer, you need to actually figure out how to effectively close space instead of teleporting onto them? Or that if you want to ambush people you have to, you know, actually use stealth (bushes, trees, buildings, etc) to hide yourself?

I agree. Can’t believe it left whatever terrible QA BGS has. I’ll try that. Thanks. 
---
Honestly they should bring the damage up to make the weapons more useful rather then lighter. If your middle launchet actually functioned in killing multiple enemies in its blast radius you wouldn’t need to carry like 5 heavy weapons. And weight of a heavy weapon on a non heavy weapon user should be irrelevant in my eyes because they don’t carry a heavy weapon outside of trying to sell it. 
---
Something you may not be aware of yet, but which is invaluable at around your level: You should be getting into the habit of picking up and scrapping EVERY weapon and armour you find which you don't plan on using. ALL of them. Every time you scrap one, you have a good chance of learning a new mod for that type of weapon or armour, and gradually, after scrapping a few dozen of any given type, you'll know all the mods and be able to craft or modify weapons and armour of exceeding quality, allowing you to keep ahead of your enemies. 
---
As to inventory management: I find that a good rule of thumb is to never keep more than 150 of any given type of scrap in my stash. You will very seldom need more than that for any purpose, and it will just be taking up space that could be better filled with more immediately useful stuff. 
---
As others have mentioned, you should be looking into some perks which reduce the weight of items you're carrying. The agility perk "Through Hiker" and the strength perks "Bandolier" and "Traveling Pharmacy" in particular are extremely useful in terms of keeping the vital stuff - food, chems and bullets - nice and light-weight so you can carry a good number without getting over-encumbered. 
---
As to ammo: Get in the habit of farming lead, steel and gunpowder. Learn what items have lead in them. Hint: If an item definitely should not have lead in it, it almost always has lead in it. Children's toys, like toy trucks, wooden blocks, rocketships and such all have lead. Food containers like tin cans are largely made of lead. Things like that. Take it to a tinker's workbench and craft the ammo you need. Having the agility-related "ammosmith" perk is definitely something you should aim for so as to get the most out of your materials in this respect. 
---
Proofread. I have no idea what you mean by your reply. 
---
Passive mode doesn’t keep you from hurting him. Slap damage still exists. He could have passive mode off and do the exact same thing. All he has to do is not shoot at you/your base himself. He doesn’t need passive mode for that, just trigger control. 
---
TBH a stealthboyed melee is hard to take down even if you're a stealthed melee. Shotguns and explosive heavy weapons seem to be the best answer as far as I can tell, but you could also use a tesla since shots at the ground will arc to them. It's damn essential to have 1 melee person on a team, but it's not like running more than one increases how versatile the team is. 
---
You just quoted me for the first two months of this games release lmao. Just me going “how tf did this make it past QA/beta” lmao 
---
I disagree. The game has some pvp elements. It’s supposed to be slightly inconvenient. Some enjoy some pvp and it’s adds a small element of danger that makes the game more interesting. 
---
Probably not, because that would make them usable. Even with the “buff” coming up, the plasma rifle will still be a total piece of shit. It’s almost as if they don’t understand the DR factors that make so many weapons unusable in their game, and somehow think a 10% damage increase will make those weapons viable.
---
Probably the dirty army fatigues. Those are an outfit

Very nice camera work, use of music and voice over. &lt;3

Are you guys looking for members right now? Because i am looking for a group to play with, and i always wanted to try an RP-like playstyle.

---
Any places with a good amount of enemies should work; Whitesprings, West Tek...
---
As for playing solo or with someone, it's your choice. Whatever makes you more comfortable while playing.
---
Energy weapons are still going to be absolute garbage. It’s like they didn’t really even listen when we pointed out it was enemy DR, and the energy weapons having no way around it, that made them shit.
---
And now 5 months since release and still looks terrible. I don’t get it. Any NVIDIA Control Panel settings to change?
---
Just so we're clear, I have the BOS Initiate paint, but I'm looking for the Paladin paint job. I would also except Sentinel or Elder ones too.
---
I'm sorry to hear this happened to you. I too have had bullies do the same to me. Even recently, and I'm a level 137!  I think the P.V.P. is one of the games many faults. And the fact that they are catering to these immature players troubles me. Fallout players are mostly people who want to be left alone, that was the magic of the previous games. Now a person has to deal not only with the A.I. but compete other players for resources and deal with their adolescent behavior. Just know you are not alone in your frustration.
---
tell us more about the naughty nurse.
---
Agreed, this isnt PVP, its griefing.  There should be beaucoup penalties for that because if you're pulling shit like this, you shouldn't be allowed to play a multiplayer game because clearly you dont know how to not be a knob when griefing like the jerk did to OP here.
---
Personally I lost interest in the game shortly after launch because of griefers.  Griefers are typically fat, lazy, ignorant and shunned by society they wish to be party to.  Their reaction is to instead be a fucking troll online, because they have all this anger and they feel it's the Worlds fault that they never got their shit together and learned how to be a decent human.
---
So again, I say fuck griefers, zero their chars back to level 1.  That would be fucking amazing.  I'd come to the FO76 thread just to read all the bitchy whining from those losers because they cant be lil cunts online anymore, haha.
---
&gt;What in the hell are you talking about? Someone can stand 15 feet away and instantly appear on top of you and simultaneously strike you with their weapon.
---
That's called sprinting.
---
&gt;And how would you stagger someone who is invisible and you don’t see?
---
Any staggering perk. A tesla rifle doesn't even require you to hit the target, just the ground near them. There's plenty of options.
---
&gt;Why not just remove both of these mechanics that break any remote semblance of balance?
---
Because if you understand the game's mechanics there is quite a bit of balance. It's all about counters and there are counters for the issues you're bring up.
---
&gt;Make it so that if you want to crank someone with a sledgehammer
---
Most people don't use 2H in PvP. That's more of a PvE thing. Things are much faster in PvP, so you usually ditch the slower 2H weapons. 
---
&gt;Or that if you want to ambush people you have to, you know, actually use stealth (bushes, trees, buildings, etc) to hide yourself?
---
How about a stealth boy? Oh wait...
---
Yes to all of that. 
---
I don't normally use PA, just the perk cards that give DR. I don't really have assassin's gear and I've never bothered to collect it because PVP is so annoying. It was fun at lower levels when the game was still brand new but when every encounter turns into some jackass jumping around with a stealth boy and shotgunning my face off if I get close enough to melee then it stops being fun real quick.
---
Furious Anti Armor? Or armor piercing? Cause furious anti armor cant exist (theoretically), since theyre both prefixes. You probably have a stinging, piercing, or perforating mag on a furious handmade 
---
Lone wander( if solo), hard bargain, gunsmith/makeshift warrior, armorer, hacker perks, picklock perks, white knight ( if you aren’t constantly in power armor) bloody mess, Starched genes+class freak ( if you plan on using mutations), and perks for whatever weapons you use ie: commando, heavy gunner, etc. If you are using weapons with a low rate of fire, perks like tormentor and stabilized are not worth it. Additionally, perks that increase accuracy or range are terrible.
---
This is my "i want your organs" build
---
If you want to make caps, spend one day a week concentrating on trading, look for bargains &amp; then resell for a profit.
---
You can hold out for decent prices or just add enough on top to quickly sell. 
---
You could turn that 7k to 10k in 10 to 20mins if there's a bargain to be found or if you hold off for a decent price up to 20k.
---
&gt; We have medical  devices in the game that can easily cure and heal anything... and we can  not use them.  
---
Except those arent really "auto" docs, they are the same pod and you use them to get the bio metric data..... If you didnt skip directly to being able to launch nukes you would have done the other quest where you use the same style pod &gt;!in the basement of that one building!&lt;, &gt;!where you make the vaccine.!&lt; However in both cases they are programed to do one specific thing. the one in the bunker is for taking bio metric data and the other one is programed as part of that quest line before you encounter the pod. 
---
Mine is like that too, can someone give us the crash course on basic SPECIAL prioritization? Don't wanna min max just not do something dumb..
---
TBH PvP isn't fun until you learn the mechanics and set up your build. Spending perk points on DR perks is really a waste and not fit for a PvP build. I have to make PvP specific characters because what's effective for PvE and PvP are pretty exclusive. You can make a character that can do both, but you make too many compromises.
---
I went to level 60 before I figured this out. If you have a stored extractor, it may be set up as a junk extractor or a iron extractor. If they don’t match what your pit is, you need to build a new extractor and it will set it up for the mineral you have.  Under resources it only shows one, but if you already built one, in your stored items it will be specific like junk extractor and will only work on junk.  I tried to place my junk extractor on a bunch of aluminum pits before I figured that out.
---
im pretty sure you can.
---
you might be correct on leaving the workshop area its disengages the pvp but i think its possible as a month ago or so i had a guy at the big earth digger in the ash heap and i went and took it to initiate pvp and he was out of the workshop area and i went to him and we battled.
---
so as soon as i try to take it you'll be in pvp for a while i presume. 
---
At least my personal experience is you are right at peak difficulty, it definitely gets a lot more manageable once you get above low 40’s. A couple of mutations will definitely change things up for you too (but make sure you know about starched genes perk etc)
---
You could play it and see for yourself.. how’s anyone supposed to know if you’ll like something? Don’t save items that you’ll never use and then complain about the stash size 
---
Can I enroll in this course too? 
---
What kind of build and perk choices are good for strictly pvp? I would consider making a secondary character if they made survival servers exclusive but if I'm going against level 200s right out of the gate then that's no good.
---
Absolutely yes. I’ve been talking about this with my brother for ages. It would be such a cool addition. 
---
Sorry not off the top of my head..
---
Well that's up to you. I think hes great. I was cooking while watching him so when he talked about the head it slipped my mind. He goes though a LOT of little detail in his videos more then other people I find.
---
But you do you. Hes a youtuber. Not sure what else your looking for.
---
Yaaaas
---
I sold a AA handmade last night. I keep telling myself it was only a level 30, still feels bad. I really liked that gun.
---
Seems like some people here are giving permission to where and when we can say what we think, even if it's good intentioned
---
People will just dupe on the survival servers and give their friends the gear so I don’t think it’ll matter much. Maybe you should have to prestige to join the survival mode so everyone starts at lvl 1 but you can still bring gear over. 
---
Melee should honestly be the baseline you all ask to be buffed to instead of asking for nerfs....This isnt Apex so every weapon should be viable. even the asshole that wants to use the paddle ball. 
---
Don't know if you were trying to make me cry, but you did. 
---
I think most of the hardcore players only have one character at level 376 and rising. I'm on my 6th character and the highest is on level 46.
---
I mentioned this in a post of my own. Bethesda has allowed trade exploits to exist for far too long. Old trade exploits need to be fixed before we start adding new trade content to the game. 
---
I’d second that. 
---
Sorry to hear that. I know I’m not the first person to suggest this, but I feel this is a major QOL issue that at least appears to be an easy fix. The roadmap is nice and all, but things like this are infinitely more important to me than being able to brew beer in-game.
---
Eh, sort of. It’s a massive grind to get if you want to force it, but it’s a guaranteed grind. Lots of other items are vastly harder to even try to grind for, and aren’t even guaranteed then (there’s a number of quest-only outfits that are super rare drops)
---
You all know this isnt fortnite right?
---
Like you can actually "trade" with another person you don't need to drop stuff on a promise like you do over that game and then get kicked.  
---
Thanks for the offer however I am on xbox
---
Your title sounds like a haiku. I like it.
---
Well what I mean is it should come with some special headlamp just like the mothman power armor not necessarily a camo headlamp
---
I see depth of field but not motion blur in the PC settings. 
---
I know many people say just around 5/6 INT, and max STR. Probably for carry weight and melee stuff, as shotguns are really heavy, require ammo, and less dependable as a melee for close quarters. 
---
At least, this is what I do, I only have the necessary things for INT but that's just me. Never needed 15
---
alright, ill check around for one
---
Uranium fever will get you a lot of steel from scrapping all the weapons and whatnot.
---
Thanks for the info! Ill check around
---
Don't play fortnite &amp; don't drop items on the ground
---
I've noticed that "ignore" or, "block for session," literally do nothing but hide the perpetrator's location on the map and, mute them...
---
I mean, it is PETA, they'd try. Tod is a pretty big joke atm too, it'd be funny to hear.
---
If you got to harpers ferry you can get the quest “ tracking unknowns”. There is a prototype hazmat suit that is level 1, but has the same stats as a normal suit. The suit is next to a holotape you need for the quest.
---
I found them both at emit waste disposal site 
---
Thanks I'm melee with 15 STR so this is good. I don't have 15 INT but I got a lot for repairing and hacking and crafting. 
---
So what's the best secondary stat for melee/shotgun build? Agility? 
---
Uh No, they are auto docs, mark IX auto docs. Bio metric data is one of the many things they can do. Read the lore bit. 
---
Yeah- that’s pretty much what I’m talking about :)
---
/u/Valseek
---
This would have been a great time to fix durability damage from non-shotguns that have shotgun/splitter/flechette mods, and for each projectile they fire, they deal durability damage. At the same time, shotgun mods on guns should turn them into shotguns for perk usage. I would love to be able to use an energy weapon with my build someday.
---
I am NOT talking about "current state of this game". I am talking about the proposed changes.  You're taking something that is meant as a future tense, "it should work this way" and saying "but it doesn't work that way right now".  I know.  I don't care.  That isn't the point.   The point is that it should work in a way where the Pacifist can engage in combat that is centric to key elements of the game  already mentioned and explained above.    If they engage in PvP and are killed they wouldn't be able to be damaged again unless they choose to engage again.   Also, on the flip side, they wouldn't be able to use "switching to pacifist" as a way to avoid damage from shit that they started just before that.   If they switch to pacifist it should let their current engagement continue on until it either expires (due to a timeout , disconnect, server hop) OR until one of them ends up dead at the hands of the other.   If the Pacifist ends up dead, they wouldn't be eligible to be killed again.   Stop applying what I'm saying about how the game SHOULD work to how the game has worked in the past.  It should be a given that the game is undergoing changes in how the PvP dynamics play out.
---
My original disagreement with you has to do with what the future state of the game should be and with what I am saying, your scenario simply isn't possible, but you have to actually follow what I am telling you.  I am NOT saying that it isn't possible in the game now.  We are talking about proposed changes here.
---
I'm none of those things and don't even PVP currently but I'm going to check out the PVP server. I'm sure I'm not alone in not being a cheater.
---
Thanks  
---
I had no idea I did poetry. 
---
I don’t even know how to write poetry. 
---
So it happened by mistake. 
---
alot of people who dont voice chat, will want to trade and if they are just standing there looking like they are doing nothing maybe go check your inventory while in trade as many people will be requesting items and waitng for you to put a price on them or visa versa.
---
Thanks! My base is near there so Ill go check it out!
---
The best way to get xp until you're level 50ish and can hold your own better in places like whitespring and west tek is to do quests. If you don't want to do the quests try to make it to watoga and do the mayor for a day quest, it will make the robots passive towards you and you can easily farm the whole city. 
---
I play solo, but it can be fun to tag along with randos sometimes. Try looking on the map for events with other players already there. It's a good way to meet other players and maybe make a friend.
---
Usually when you confuse a whipper snapper they make it known.  Thus, they self identify and I can tell who I am dealing with.  Since you didn't flinch at the zip drive or even older Floppy Floppy reference, I can tell you are a person of experience.  :)
---
I would love some type of in-game mail system. One of my friends was looking for concrete and disease cures. I was carrying the weight around for days until we were finally online at the same time. I should just be able to mail him stuff, within reason.
---
If they need a cap sink or are worried about people storing hundreds of pounds in the mail, then make it like the *real* postal service and charge by weight. So immersive. 
---
Flight helmet + bomber jacket. 
---
Engineer outfit + welding mask
---
Senior scribe + medical helmet.
---
Trust me ;)
---
If directly trading(nil caps) they should bring in that both people have to set &amp; agree on the items before any items can be transferred &amp; nil cap value has to be set.
---
No u can use the beanie gray knitted hat with it as that's what I wore. And wear in 76. It's so dumb that I can't wear it with the scout mask too. 
---
I hate pvp I have never thought it is cool to attack and kill other players who have spent hours finding materials then along comes some jerk 49 levels higher then u with a gun that shoots explosive ammo and kills u with one shot.Then takes all the junk u were carrying.Pvp should not be aloud at all.
---
 Right? I can only imagine what kinds of towns people can string together. I wonder if they should limit it to just the four player squad or instead just make player community zones with building areas for everyone's C.A.M.P
---
I have come sooo close to scrapping my BoS jumpsuit simply trying to scrap a beer bottle on MANY occasions
---
Why doesnt legendary  scout armour drop off enemies as well?
---
See I take issue with that I don’t mind that PvP is a thing, I more dislike the design of Bethesda. Punishing the person who spends hours farming and forcing them to spend more time if they want their shit fixed or keeping known exploits in game allowing people to have god-like dps. 
---
That was awesome. Good use of animations for the “we have the technology” section. Those few shots after that looked very cinematic
---
I took a break to play through Metro Exodus and Far Cry New Dawn. Big mistake. When I went back to 76 it looked like an xbox360 game. 
---
Probably would have to be limited due to stability, but still a four person colony would be much cooler than my little camp. You could just do so much stuff with that extra budget too without causing that much of an impact. 
---
Good point and be sure to test with animation skipping movements / key combinations.  They may be cheesing the extra dps through odd timing bug means.   Also, the combat knife has the serrated mod which does bleeding damage as well.  Not sure if that is part of the same 5 dps limit or part of how they are going over it.  I didn't stick around very long to ask them how they were draining my health over and over again so quick and I decided that 10 stim packs was more than I was willing to spend on trying to outlast them hoping they would get bored and go away.   I didn't want to run away because then they would just have fun chasing me.  :/
---
Yep. Good to be wrong when it helps people out lol.
---
Me and my boyfriend were wanting to live together. Now we have 2 separate houses ;( 
---
Nope sentinel is only when standing still.
---
you want assassins legendary effect if you want damage reduction and being able to move.
---
i have 4 out of 5 x -8% damage from players. so just that is 40% add perks that reduce melee damage and fireproof perk, you'll be pretty strong in pvp.
---
You can get -10% damage from players assassins legendary effect armour too.
---
happy hunting  
---
I suspect it means more caps, possibly aid items, ammo, etc, when killing people in PVP. 
---
Your tone sounds like you're a PvE player since you equate PvP to griefing. Not to be too obtuse, but I think PvP players should get what they want in PvP servers. I don't think PvE players should dictate what happens on servers they don't intend to play on. And to be clear, PvP is a minority of the community and while this is necessary to get more separation between the camps, it really isn't providing much in terms of new content to PvE players. Hopefully the more toxic PvP players will stick to survival mode, but for the ones that really enjoy aggravating others it's probably safe to say they'll stick to the servers where they can antagonize people the most.
---
&gt;if a "safe" pve mode exists, there will be no reason to ever play the pvp mode unless you want to grief
---
This is a false equivalency. Just because someone enjoys PvP doesn't mean they're a griefer by default. I want to fight people who are willing to fight. If you join a PvP server, I assume you want to fight. If you go to a PvP event, I assume you want to fight. And if you take a workshop, you're informed that it opens you up to PvP, so you better be willing to fight/forfeit.  
---
Other than that, what PvP players want to be forced to start over? I've already made 2 PvP builds for the upcoming survival mode. If you made it so my PvP builds couldn't go to survival mode, I'll just do PvP in the PvE server. I can't be the only PvP player that would make that choice. I'm certain neither the PvP or PvE camps want this. 
---
There is actually an unmarked location near South Mountain Lookout that looks very much like a bomb drop site. I just discovered it for the first time yesterday. It’s a huge crater with the remains of a few buildings. So -something- definitely dropped. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Are you on PS4, and if so would you mind giving your psn? As a former cop I'd love to come visit you guys sometime, haha
---
Numbers dude. Why do you need that much GLUE. I don't care about physical area, I'm curious at the need for that volume of output. 
---
i got legendary one 3\* and def keeping until they patch it.
---
Will be a beast when it works well
---
Thanks for sharing! This is awesome and makes playing melee a lot more interesting! 
---
I wonder if that was intentional on the dev side
---
Just on condition and durabillity I think
---
What about assault rifles, submachine guns, and handmades??? They all need a better damage output. I'm tired of burning through ammo.
---
Yeah, seems fairly straight forward. If you favorite something you have to unfavorite that thing to sell it. Or at least make a very noticeable delay where you have to hold the button down for like 5 seconds before it goes. Right now it only takes a second of mindless distraction to lose a favorite item.
---
If you use vats a lot yes, it will give you extra AP. Perception will give you some extra shotgun accuracy bonuses. Otherwise yeah agility is a great all rounder
---
Inside out

Probably not significant enough to put in patch notes.
---
Omg this happened to me. A guy showed up at my camp and asked to trade so I accepted it. He got on his mic and said “why do you have so many outfits” lol that’s like most of my inventory. I can’t just put up the witch outfit... sometimes I wanna be a witch, sometimes I wanna be a badass BoS Knight... let me live dammit! 
---
Theres the option now that you can just rejoin another server without having to replace it though
---
I tested Talons + Bladed Knuckles, so two bleed effects in one. Still stuck at ~5dps on a naked target. I'm not sure about animation skipping. Seems unlikely that would affect the system since it should be unrelated but I've no idea how it's actually programmed. Hard for me to test though.
---
Ign?
---
True but it is how I have to do it till they upgrade the songs or new stations. 
---
just look at the messenger event,   NO ONE does them the ai gets stuck, stops randomly for 5 minutes, goes into a town and then immediately turns around and goes back the way he came to go another way through the same town ahhh.
---
lol rant over

You know how this works?

I have been playing solo but it is frustrating when I run into a scorch beast and die about 10 times before I can get my dropped loot and run away

You do realise that Survival will lack extended fights right? Once you are dead, you respawn at your camp, so unless you have two direct neighbors fighting each other, no fight will play out with continued revenge as it does right now. Revenge is no option anymore. That´s why tankyness and heal spam matter a lot here, you can not crit down the entire team and once you are out of the first wave of crits, you will likely die without heal spam to people staggering and focusing you to death. Also, focusing our healer is possible, but also difficult, the Stealth Boy mod helps to conceal his very existence, while the DPS and Stagger tanks will eat away your health. Well, too much detail already, but you get the idea, in the heat of battle you may not even realize how those guys constantly shooting you heal so much and that you are not actually fighting 3 but 4 people. Also, I play on PS4 and Xbox, but not on PC, so no luck in getting a fight going. The frustrating part regarding this approach is that you will sometimes encounter teamfights, in which no single player can actually kill another player of the other team, but instead both teams waste resources without really getting anywhere, as nobody can really overpower the other due to percentage reductions pushing weapon damage below heals. You may get one kill here and there and stomp on people that have no functionally tanky or burst damage oriented build, or you may be picked off while you are careless with drugged up stealth 1 shot kills, but that´s it. It is not going to be fun. That´s why the mentioned mechanics need to be adjusted, in order to improve the basic gameplay.

Interesting. Thanks for confirming!
---
This is the crap that gets blood into our game from other franchises like battlefield, and call of duty. Just sucks...
---
What is your reason for having more than one character? I'm just curious.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I will make my way there as soon as I get on
---
Didn't see mb dude. 
---
Not at home, so can't  confirm, but will check and see when home ...
---
no, please explain, I am curious.
---
hey man this was a cool read, thank you for the tips I am gonna build my next character with this in mind! 
---
also, happy birthday!
---
***Many*** of us use pacifist mode to avoid accidentally attacking random players.  I only turn it off occasionally, strictly to claim bounties or engage in legitimate PVP against griefers.  Why would you suggest that we shouldn't we be able to do that?
---
i got one from a vendor after the banwave/item purge.
---
3\* tse combat shotty with 3rd \* being +50 damage resist while aiming.
---
Idk. I’m excited to be a part of the first annual parade. :)
---
one has to hold him by stying in his inventory while the other force-quits the game and relaunches. then he s hould have new items.
---
I wear a cowboy hat with the gasmask now
---
when the one player has all items we can do it the other way round
---
so who wanna join me?
---
Wait blunderbuss  counts as shotgun perks? If so u need to get one
---
I wear a cowboy hat with the gasmask currently
---
Hmm. I think you're right, and they added that. Was not the case in FO4. 
---
It's great for fighting groups of enemies and not hitting other players. Like idk....SBQ. 
---
I have to do that several times per session though. It would be better if house placement wasn't so glitchy instead
---
My advice, take your time while exploring around, as that's really the best part of the game so far. They really went all out with the locations and layouts of things, every spot has a little story to it with hints and clues with how things are positioned that you can figure out if you really pay attention. Don't feel like you gotta blow through it and rush to 50, you'll have way more fun taking it slow.
---
Yes it does
---
Just use a melee or something easy to kill with and take down a whole place, leave, rejoin, and repeat. Melee doesn’t waste ammo so it’s efficient at mass genocide. A more philosophical route is by attending events that usually spawn legendary enemies and on top of that give awards at the end for completion. You could also just build passively but that takes way too much time.
---
 I dunno I always take 2 points in GunRunner in Agility for +20% Speed. That's actually quite huge in this game. There are very few things I can not run away from.
---
I had a Grenadier build but it was nerfed far beyond recognition.
---
Im in, GT : xecutoiner
---
Por que no dos? 
---
Except mostly on my bloodied sniper.
---
This is my Enclave Officer outfit with a silenced 10mm pistol, a nasty 10mm SMG, and a nice sniper rifle with a recon scope.
---
This is my Nuka Girl with a Plasma Sniper, a Tricentennial colors, stock-looking Laser Rifle, and Alien Blaster sidearm.
---
This is my Scrounger, with auto pipe-rifle, bolt-action sniper pipe rifle, and a ski sword.
---
This is my Forest scout with a Tactical Handmade Rifle, and automatic 10mm
---
This is my Starlet Sniper, with nice lever-action, Western Revolver (I want to use the single action, but god that thing is a pain in the ass to reload), and Bowie Knife.
---
I mean, none of them actually use their melee weapons, but I've got perk swaps for pistols and semi-auto or automatic rifles.
---
&gt;You do realise that Survival will lack extended fights right?
---
You realize fast traveling to a friend is still an option, right?
---
&gt;once you are out of the first wave of crits
---
Four leaf clover and crit savvy makes it so every other shot is a crit.
---
&gt; focusing our healer is possible, but also difficult, the Stealth Boy mod helps to conceal his very existence
---
Once your chest piece is destroyed, you no longer have stealth.

It sounds like you chose a defensive build. If anyone has a direct counter to your play style, you're stuck with no way to respond. My team just got a tank that functions like yours and while it's nice it doesn't work for serious teams. With serious teams that person has to switch to their other PvP build. It's easily countered if you know what you need to counter.
---
Usually the hardest people to kill have the most expensive builds to sustain. I can't imagine you can easily sustain that. I knew a PvP player that survived with dodgy, cola nut, and chugging nuka quantums. He'd server hop to buy his one quantum for a day then be fit to fight. He ended up quitting. It's almost like the constant need to farm for resources pulled him out of the game. Likewise, he wasn't solely invincible and could be killed with the right build.

I bet ya its todd

Is it retrievable on ps4 do you know I haven't seen it once.

DreddedOne in game if you don't get my invite
